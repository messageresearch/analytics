TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ephesians chapter 3 verses 14 and 15 for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ and then verses 16 and on he expresses that cause but then he says of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that's bower heads in prayer now gracious heavenly fathers we stand together today we are humbled by your greatness lord we know your presence is amongst us and father we know that if you've come amongst us it's be to do something and that lord your spirit could be poured out in a way that generally touches many different people but your presence always has a very specific purpose and there's a general purpose and there's things you can accomplish even by way of healing and uplifting and deliverance but lord your presence has a very specific intent and lord we avail ourselves to your design today we humble ourselves to whatever your intent and purpose is and we pray that you would come now and bless the word which has been read those thoughts that may be shared from our hearts may they be your thoughts lord the scriptures and quotations may they be harnessed by the holy spirit directly to the believer's heart we ask all these things named lord jesus christ amen you may be seated i'm going to withhold giving my title just for a little bit but i want to just look at genesis chapter 1 verse 1 because this is where we started in in july when we held our first services together and the scripture we know by heart now but in the beginning and of course you it's something that's very very easy to learn and uh to memorize in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and we took several parts and looking at in the beginning and then we took several parts on god created and through those 15 different services that we've ministered on this subject of in the beginning god created we're looking at how that in this beginning or at the beginning uh different elements that were represented there in the beginning and how that god would in his creation god's creation was reflecting himself and something about his nature it was something reflecting something about his desire and purpose even though he may not have been very explicit even though he wasn't verbalizing what he wanted to do you could look at his creation and an artist or creator is known by his works so when we see that god created the heavens and the earth there was symbolism represented in that heaven and the earth and then when we look at how god made creation and brought forth man he was representing things about himself so it came into existence and uh and really we're there's gonna be maybe some principles that our uh review and maybe some principles uh that we've labored on before but we just wanna go through very quickly but this is this right now as we go forward you don't need to have heard anything else to this point so don't think oh great we missed the first 15 so we might as well just check out and and go to chipotle not yet they're not open but i want you just to begin to think of it this way how god existing by himself in the beginning everything that he was going to create was first in god's heart so whatever came into existence in creation first was in god's heart or in his thoughts so god had something in his mind and then there was a condescending order there was a way that god was descending and condescending from the invisible god with thoughts and the first step where he condescends he creates himself informs himself into a logos and brother battle makes the statement that from that moment that god formed himself in the logos he was always moving towards flesh so god wanted to be in didn't want to just stay in that theophany and that logos he wanted to become flesh but from that he begins to create and and god first establishes a supernatural dimension and in that dimension there's uh there's host and there's different arrangements of angels and there's different categories of supernatural beings and god created a great order in heaven before he created earth it says in psalms 11 4 the lord is in his temple the lord's throne is in heaven so when this is being described there's many other scriptures that speak of this but god now when he first created there was a throne in heaven there was a there was a temple in heaven and so in this supernatural dimension there were certain elements that are being represented and we can say perhaps they're symbolic and maybe there's some literal expression of it but that we use a human language to describe something in heaven the lord is in his holy temple the lord's throne is in heaven this is describing another dimension that we don't exist in and so the creation of earth mirrored what was in heaven brother makes the statement for everything in earth is just a pattern of that which is in heaven so when god begins to create on earth it had already existed first in heaven and before it existed in heaven it existed in the mind of god so what is in the mind of god he then lays out in a a supernatural dimension in a dimension that's not bound by time and light and space as we are now but in that dimension and even those different orders of dimensions uh that are unseen to us god establishes an arrangement and an order in hosts and spirits and angels billabong said the spirit of god made nature and all god and nature is incontinuity so there is something he says in continuity so god and nature in continuity so there's a continuity with god's creation and what we see naturally and then what is in heaven so there's an agreement there's an accord there's something where what we see in heaven we also see we can see an earth as it says in first john chapter 5 verses 7 and 8 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one so we see these things that bear witness bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one so what you see the three being one in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and then we see a reflection on earth the spirit the water and the blood and there's a so there's a mirroring of what's in heaven and what's on earth you're often the phrase the natural types the spiritual and that may have application to um to our spiritual lives and spiritual things that take place here on earth but it's also even in creation that what was spiritual and supernatural and what related to another dimension higher than that of earth that it's now being mirrored and expressed on earth so god's creation on earth reveals a heavenly objective well god what god begins to do on earth is mirrored in heaven what god begins to unfold has a reflection in heaven in exodus chapter 25 verses 8 and 9 and there's a number of scriptures we could have used here but we wanted to be sure to uh just try to stay very focused and it says in exodus chapter 25 verses 8 9 and let them make me a sanctuary god is speaking to moses now on the mount and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them according to all that i show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it so god was going to show him a tabernacle god was going to show him instruments and he's telling them whatever i show you i want you to make it after that pattern so when god begins to show him something and reveals this to him and shows them the this tabernacle and all the instruments and then you begin to read and all the different elements related to it he's saying make me a sanctuary after this pattern that i show you and so moses made the earthly tabernacle after what he saw in heaven and in many different jewish writings and i was reading several of them and i found several statements i'll just read two of them to you this is in the uh outside of their their their bible but these are rabbinical writings and things in history and they say the structure of the tabernacle corresponds to the structure of heaven and earth amen then another place the right the tabernacle below was likewise made after the pattern of the supernatural tabernacle in all its details and brother branham enforces this time and time again that god showed moses a tabernacle in heaven and when moses saw what was in heaven god wanted him to make upon earth a tabernacle reflecting what was already in heaven and so the what we're using this to emphasize is that there's something that exists in the supernatural heavenly realm but then there's also a reflection of it here on earth and as it unfolds on earth it's showing what god wants to achieve even in the tabernacle we can see the triune nature of man and and how the even in the the three that agree in heaven and the three that agree in one on earth and the bible says in revelations 11 19 and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament so this is just one of many scriptures we could share with you of how that there's an image in heaven and now it's being reflected literally in a tabernacle on earth a temple on earth but it shows there was something there first that is going to be expressed and portrayed here upon earth as it says in hebrews chapter 8 verse 5 who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things talking about the temple worship and the tabernacle and order of sacrifices as moses was amongst when he was about to make the tabernacle foresee saith he this is god speaking see that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount and so the things that god showed him in heaven moses then took what he saw in heaven as a pattern as a blueprint and reproduced it on earth that it might be as it says an example in shadow of heavenly things so even in building the temple and the tabernacle in the wilderness or the temple of solomon and the way that god expressed those things and showed those things they were to be a shadow and a type of what was in heaven not the complete fulfillment of it so what was in heaven has to have its ultimate realization its ultimate expression and the tabernacle in the wilderness and the temple that solomon built these are a reflection of something in heaven a heavenly objective and so i use that as an example to to make this point that what god establishes in genesis chapter one in genesis chapter two we can say a creation of everything in chapter one and then a bringing out of seeds and unfolding of things in genesis chapter 2 what has it has a heavenly representation that we're seeing a shadow or type as an example in shadow of heavenly things heavenly things that must become real heavenly things that must be perfectly realized so if we can if we can look at creation that way especially the original creation it gives a supernatural significance to the original that whatever god has set and placed in the original is a shadowing type of heavenly things and we know that we're not just to remain here even in this earthly tabernacle and in this cosmos as we know it but it's going to come back into the eternal then whatever is heavenly must gain full expression and so there's great supernatural significance to the original creation and the climax of god's creation in genesis chapter two if you ponder that think for a moment how that in genesis chapter 2 we see that god has done creating god's done bringing forth of these seeds the climax of creation was not just a man and it's very important to see this image and also see to see the image of god in creation in genesis chapter 1 verse 27 let us make man in our image and then he says in man so he made man in his image and after his likeness but man is not finished because man at that point brother says is a supernatural being or a spiritual being he is just a spirit then in genesis chapter 2 verse 7 god forms man out of the dust of the earth and what he brings is he brings flesh so man is a spirit and he's not finished but now he brings forth flesh and the spirit now indwells the flesh and you say the man himself is complete but still it's not mankind's final expression it's not the climax of creation in genesis chapter 2 verse 4 before it god even forms them into flesh and before god further unfolds mankind in this chapter says these are the generations of the heaven and earth and this generation it means a begetting a product it comes from word to bring forth this is what's brought forth from the heaven and the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens now by this phrase there's a foreshadowing that takes place by introducing god now in using this phrase in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth now there's a different phrase that is used not just the earth and the heavens but it says the lord god made the earth and the heavens lord is jehovah god is elohim in the beginning god elohim created but now it's the lord god elohim is the one who exists by himself this would be the god before there was anything all alone dwelling with his thoughts he exists by himself he is not dependent upon any other he has not originated from something else he exists by himself i know you can't get your head around it don't try he just always was and so here is this god who always was but now it's not just it's not just elohim the god the strong one bound by an oath but now it's jehovah god and that jehovah speaks again of the self-existent one but it's adanahi which comes from which means it's the becoming god one that becomes one that exists so you have elohim a strong one all by himself and now jehovah's still the same self-existent one but now he has a name lord god which means he's becoming amen the god that is being expressed in this name change placed god this change of his name to lord god lord god places god in relationship to his creation without creation without anything else existing he's only elohim but now that creation is coming forth in a particular representation it's now god becoming its lord god so now god is placed in relationship to his creation and creation is being placed in relationship to god and brother branham takes picks up on this phrase lord god in the message adoption part 1 and he's talking about how he was el ella elohim the all-sufficient all-powerful almighty self-existent one but in genesis 2 when he made man and he says he says he calls himself jehovah you see that he spells it he says jehovah he says what did it mean i am the all-existent one who has created now notice this now that it's jehovah comes into the picture and it's jehovah god i am the self-existent one or all existence one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine so this is what makes him lord god now this is god becoming because we see this son that comes forth then he uses an interesting phrase or a temporary or amateur little one of mine now i used to read that and think temporary what he just meant was amateur but yet we see adam's full sonship was temporary because he lost the holy image of god and enters into a fallen state he's still a son but he lost something now he says jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur god because he is father god and he made a man an amateur god so he's isn't self-existence anymore he exists with his family i want you to catch that part now he's jehovah god before he's just elohim he's by himself but now he calls himself not just elohim but jehovah elohim i am becoming and now he exists with his family as this image comes forth ella ella elohim now he is jehovah jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family i like this definition amen jehovah god is one who now exists with this family he says god made man to predominate over the earth he had dominion and the earth was man's dominion is that scripture then if that's his domain he was god over the earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so there is god jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little one's with him and he says there you are you're expressed in that image so now jehovah when he says that the lord god made the earth and the heavens he's foreshadowing something that's coming forth because this designates him not just as a being who exists by himself but one who's now going to exist with his family and little ones with them so the image we have now of god is that god as a father is together with his children so this is where god expresses his primary goal and culmination in the in the culmination of creation god is expressing his primary goal and this is where we come to what my subject is god expressing what he was ultimately trying to achieve or become in the culmination of the original creation it's not man it's not just man and flesh but it's a family and as we've been looking at as we began this series it was in the beginning and then it was god created and now it's a family in the beginning god created a family you can see it in genesis chapter one verse one in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth what was it heavenly bridegroom earthly bride you see man and woman there was god the father is going to have something where he's no longer by himself he now exists with this family and so this is the title you could write it down now you can go back and put it at the top if you don't write anything else you can at least put the title that way if someone says well what did he preach you go oh where's my notes can you flip say family and it's always really easy so now god then takes this expression and he brings creation to one particular representation and what it is it's god's ultimate purpose and it's a family bill of ram says adam was the son of god eve was a daughter of god so now it's the father expressed in and as a son and daughter but now it's god is still now he's becoming and he has a son and he has a daughter it's god painting a self-portrait it's the first selfie and and what you see is a man and a woman and brother brandon makes this statement everything on earth reflects heaven so when it comes to man man is a reflection of what's in heaven and then he says it was when he gets to the creation man he said it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven and i want you just to catch this so there's something in heaven that's got to be reflected upon earth when man comes forth he was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven but we know that god's picture is not fully developed when adam is there in flesh but the negative is being formed the negative is still the image is still coming into the negative what is it it's a shadow that's being expressed it's a type being expressed as he said it was an example in shadow of heaven heavenly things adam is an example in shadow of what's in the heart of god an image that god has in his mind an image that was being expressed in heaven but an image that god ultimately wants to fully develop as he works his way to flesh now i'm not going to read through this but i'm just going to put it up there the purpose and vision of arizona believer's church and it's on i put it on our website and it's been there from the beginning and i just want to if so if you if you want this i can provide it to you but what god establishes in the beginning gives us direction even as a church and as a local church and i was going to take time to go through that but i just want to move more quickly as a local church i could i express this as a burden and a vision that i have as a local church we desire to become a church family you don't want this just to be a gathering of card players and where you know this person and and all you have in common is when you get together to play cards uh but you want it to be something where there's a there's an affection that grows and a connection and you understand one another and you're burdened for each other and you look after the needs of one another and we see how paul teaches how that local body should be in unity and the way that it functions to serve one another just even on a local level so we desire to become a church family be our desire to build a church home not just a home church but a church home it's a place where you feel that you belong in on a church level on a spiritual level and then begin to function as a family that you function as as a real family of god and as a a harmonious unit and i remember one time before i preached somewhere the brother was introducing introducing me and he was saying oh brother aaron's like family and he's like a son and we just think we love him like fam and he kept going on so much about family and then when i took over the pulpit i said you know the more he considered me family the more i kind of begin to flinch because you don't know my family and some of us have kind of have that that you know that a flinching and we get a little bit afraid oh family well i know what family means family ain't no fun but we're talking about real family we're talking about true family we're talking of family that isn't completely dysfunctional although all families have some dysfunction but a family which is not narcissistic a family which isn't abusive or controlling a family which can humble themselves and apologize a family that's always working to through differences and regardless of where you're at you're still family let's work things out let's acknowledge differences let's acknowledge offenses let's make them right a family that's willing to work and that's what we want to be as function as a true family as a family ought to but even though that would be what god would desire for a local church is that it would be a family and that it would be a church home and that we would be able to function together let me say this church does not replace your family church itself is not greater than the family unit therefore the church leadership if church doesn't replace family then church leadership does not replace family leadership just because there's a pastor of a church doesn't mean you're not the pastor in your home husbands because that's what brother branham taught brother branham taught that the husband is the pastor in the home otherwise scriptures don't make any sense when it says women if you have a question learn at home ask your husbands why spiritually he's your pastor and that's what the message teaches us and so just because there's a local church and it's a good church and it's a dynamic church and god is moving and god's vindicating his presence with the church and you have a local leadership within the church that does not replace the leadership of the holy spirit through the members of the family through the husband and wife and over their children you have personal responsibility and you have a spiritual anointing as a husband as a wife as a father and a mother to guide your children and you do not forfeit that to the church the strength of a church is a family that's what makes a church strong is strong families so substituting the family with church brings weakness when we just forfeit our family leadership and the individual leadership of the holy spirit in our lives and we we forfeit it all to church and we make church the end all and we make church the most important thing then that's where there's disorder and that's when there's weakness therefore if that's uh if if uh if a family unit to something that god has or recognized and blessed and something that god wants to enrich and it's something that we don't forfeit now we'll get further into this subject because i know people's minds start going different places family is not greater than the word but church isn't greater than families and so you can't just take church and substitute it for family therefore i believe a church exists to strengthen families by the word and those individuals within the family and and i know that uh i'll say this because i realize and i i'll say this and hopefully come to it at the end if if your family's out of order then god can bring order something's missing there's something broken god that's what god is all about he's a restorer he's a healer he's a redeemer so if things haven't been done right or you've moved past that stage or whatever and maybe even grandparents say well what do i do now or we don't have a family at home you're still a family husband and wife and then you can say well what about and as grandparents i believe you have a responsibility to encourage uh your children and your grandchildren in the right things and be there as a support and not as the one who's like hey whenever your grandpa's house there's no rules you get to do everything you're not supposed to do at grandma it's your parents house and there's some people that try to position themselves as the cool the cool grandparents when you're here you can do whatever you want you drink all the coffee you want have all the soda you want i know mom and dad don't like you watching this but when you're here you can watch it and listen some professing message believers act that way and they don't realize what a die what a landmine what a bomb they're building right there within this child's heart so even as grandparents there's a responsibility to encourage parents and your grandchildren in the right thing but then you say well what what about someone who doesn't have any family at all a church home can provide a family dynamic that they can operate within can actually provide them opportunities to be to be motherly opportunities to be fatherly opportunities to to teach and encourage and assist so there's actually within the local church when it becomes a church family and a church home those without families have a dynamic and different relationships to which they can serve and function and i believe it's important to understand very significant to understand the importance of family we need to understand the importance of family to understand its purpose its function what it what it means to god even the role of individual members within the family the duty of individual family members and the relationships among family members all those different things are so deep and i'm using general terms but they're so rich you could just take one family relationship and teach on it and never stop what because it's a reflection of god in heaven because parenthood originated in god he was the first parent so you could preach on parenthood from now until the change of our body why because it's something that reflects god's nature and god's character something about who he is so these relationships among family members and and the purpose and function of family the duty and responsibility of individual family members they are important and so if you want to turn to genesis chapter 2 i want to continue to look at what god created what he established what he blessed to see the family in god's plan and the family from god's perspective and genesis chapter 2 verse 22 because this is now man's not the ultimate creation man is not the ultimate expression and what god created beginning what he the climax of god's creation was not a church i'm going to say it again can i get an amen the climax of god's creation was not a church i know there's a there's a story told one time where a man was stranded on an island and there was when they found him there was three different huts and they said well what's up with the three huts he goes well that one's that's the he's all by himself he said that's my house that's where i lived so what's the second one it goes well that that's uh that's a church that's where i go to church and say well what about the third he goes oh that's the church i left and started a new one and so it's just it's just in man to do it you they'll split a church when they don't even they're the only one but there's a when god builds his creation it reaches its climax he hasn't established a church with the pastor associate pastor deacons and trustees and a board and musicians and god says i want this to become the figure i want this to become the likeness that i'm going to achieve ultimately no church only reflects and is only a type of the ultimate that god is wanting to achieve and maybe just throwing breadcrumbs out there that we could express in greater detail did you know that church order is just a type of family order and that within the church there's no one office that fulfills all the offices that a husband does within the family but only through pastor deacon and trustee do you actually have enough function to where you you feel the role that a husband does naturally within his family because it's just a type it doesn't replace it doesn't usurp it doesn't overthrow it doesn't inject itself and insert itself and try to disrupt and overthrow and cause a mess listen the worst thing you could do to a son of god is take away the leadership of the holy ghost and so there's a there's so a church shouldn't exist to try to tell you everything you need to do and what you need to wear and how you need to dress and how you need a vacation and where you need to go and what you need to celebrate what you can what you don't just preach the word and let the word lead and guide individuals and the and the elect will not be deceived the elect will be quick into life the elect have the inside teacher the elect will walk in the word so teach the word if the words corrective teach it if the word takes a position teach it but don't meddle that's not what church is about and so the ultimate now that god is coming through it's not man but there's a further expression and watch how this unfolds because i want you to see a family in the beginning god created and our title is a family and it just opens up a subject that i trust we can explore for for this year in genesis chapter 2 verse 22 and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man this is a very significant act brother man said here portraying the bride that's coming from the rib which is the side of man he takes this rib and this word means side or even chamber and this very same word is used of cells and chambers inside the temple so god was not just arbitrary when he chose the rib but it was something he put in man that he knew he would use later so even in choosing the rib like we mentioned before about uh and who is my neighbor it could have just said and then the samaritan came by and he helped the man who was wounded who which one was neighbor to him that was wounded and i believe the lawyer still would have got the right answer even though he's a lawyer he still would have been able to say well it was the man who showed mercy but jesus does not just stop and say well he saw him and helped him he gave very specific details as to how he helped him he went down to him and he bound up his wounds pointing the oil and the wine and he set him on his own beast and brought him to the end and stayed the night with them and carried with him to the morning and then the morning gave two pence to the the inn keeper and said here whatever he has need of pay for it if you need more i'll repay more when i get back jesus used all that because it has significance and god just did not just say well he caused a deep sleep over adam and he took a bone and he made a woman or he just took something from adam and made a woman but he's very specific does it seem odd that god was very specific god wanted to express something he took a rib from his side it wasn't from his heel it wasn't from his head it was from his side she's gonna go be co-equal with him and now this word is used later in scripture and it's used to describe chambers or cells inside the temple and the use of the word is they it is just translated for b as beam or plank a plank of wood like a plank of cedar wood a plank of fur and it actually is used to describe building materials of the temple now why because he takes a rib from adam to make a tabernacle that the spirit that was in adam will now dwell in so the rib he takes a rib and it's a word that now has significance it's building materials for a temple it's building materials for a tabernacle and he takes it from man and the man where there's adam it's adam he's he's it's he comes from man and from adam he takes this rib this beam this plank this material and he makes a woman isha so now you have adam and esha and he introduces the woman isha unto the man adam he introduces the woman esha to adam that's the word that's used adam the man. so now adam when this woman is brought to him he now begins to speak and give utterance in verse 23 and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she will be called woman because she was taken out of man now who's reading from a king james bible show of hands well a few people are you notice the woman is capitalized and the man is capitalized very peculiar very odd it doesn't happen anywhere else but in the it tran it's now capitalized woman and man is capitalized here and this is and i believe it has significance where the woman now isha because she was taken out of the man now brother brahm takes this phrase and he uses life of life power of power and says about the bride she is him and you'll find brother branham is just he is bringing and amplifying the real meaning of this verse because to be flesh of my flesh i'll start with the second phrase he uses she is flesh of my flesh that means she's from my physical body basar is the hebrew word there she the word that she used it comes from bizarre she is part of my physical body she is flash of my flesh my physical part has been now multiplied there's another part of me he took my rib a beam a plank material from me from my side he took this chamber and he's now formed a body she is flesh of my flesh and the root word that's used there bessar and the hebrew means to publish or show forth and we say she is flesh of my flesh the woman was published from man she is a flesh she's a publication she's a multiplication of man she is now expressing man in physical form an expression of man but this phrase bone of my bones i used to always read it like you have the flesh and you have the bones like sticking sticks and stones may break my bones and we think bones is like the bone part but that's not what it means flesh of my flesh would be the physical body skin bones organs all those things that are material but bone of my bones the word there that's used is essence of my essence substance of my substance self of myself she is me she's she she's essence of my essence she's substance of my substance he said this is the self of myself she is flesh of my flesh materially but now who she is completely who she is as a being who she is in spirit she is the essence of my essence she is the substance of my substance that's what we teach all the time about the bride that's what the woman represented in genesis 2. it says because she was taken out of man now this is this is awesome stuff sorry if that's an old word this is lit okay i hope this is okay to say it but i mean is it yet is that what we say now i wanna i wanna stay connected with my young people i'm gonna find out later that that's a really bad word and uh you'll find uh on on the archive it says blank spot on tape e.d but now that the woman is taken out of the man now that the woman capital w woman has come he's no longer just referred to as adam but says the woman was taken out of man and it capitalized it as man the word that's used there is ish and that is husband it's translated to husband in genesis chapter 3 verses 6 and 15. my desire should be to your east to your husband so now what has happened it's not just adam the man who exists by himself but now the designation that god that adam even uses of himself and that it's expressed even in some may view as god speaking that god is now speaking it's prophecy it's written and there's an utterance from god adam says this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman that's adam's job to name he had named everything else in creation he named it after certain characteristics something that struck him and now the woman is represented as being from man so she shall be called war men because she was taken and he doesn't say out of man adam but out of husband because now that there's a woman his relationship changes it's just not adam but now it's easy he's now husband when the woman is formed notice this his office changed because he steps into a new relationship adam all by himself but now that there's a woman that's come from him and now this woman represents something to him so because of relationship his office changes and now mankind has a different designation he calls himself ish husband and it's a designation that's essential to god who's in heaven because now adam who reflected the highest in heaven when he was adam is now reflecting the highest in heaven when he's now husband and verse 24 as we continue therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh adam had been used for man prior to this but now therefore shall in ish a man each husband leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife isha husband and wife in the beginning when god created man in his image and after his likeness he says male and female created he them so that's a reference to gender that could be referred to as even adam as a man mankind there was male in representation there's female uh hidden as a mystery inside of him but male and female are just genders that have an ultimate purpose and an ultimate expression so now it's just not adam and it's not just male and female but it's husband and wife because male and female are made to be husband and wife god had a specific purpose in them in the beginning it's setting forth god's image an image something that god is reflecting and you talk about a very uh weighty and significant scripture therefore a man here is he is adam before he goes to sleep he wakes up and now he's ish could you imagine going to sleep and some if you want to claim it brothers go ahead you go to sleep ellie and you wake up in the morning your husband i mean how awesome is that talk about an eliezer you didn't have to try and so he wakes up and he's not just a man he's a husband there's something been changed about him and so now notice the rich language that comes forth in this very significant scripture a woman is brought forth from the rib of man he makes a woman an isha from adam's rib and now she is essence of his essence self of his self she was taken out of the husband she his wife husband and wife and now he says that a man a husband shall leave his father and his mother this is the first time fathers mention ab the head or founder of a household the head or founder of a family it comes from the word the producer the generator so now already adam as he prophesies is expressing something essential to the character of god god is not just going to have male and female but he's going to have husband and wife but it's not just going to be husband and wife it's got to be father and mother because there's there's something that's unfolding about god as this is as this is being expressed a man shall leave his arm his father the producer the generator in other words god here already is envisioning a family not just a man and a woman not just a man not just a man and a woman but a family because mother there's m and the word actually literally means point of departure or division now this is something that would deserve a lot of attention but now that a man and a woman come together and he becomes father she becomes mother she becomes the point of departure through which a son establishes a new family and a new family identity and so it could be said about any one of us but somebody could say well he look at look at as my sons grow or my daughter goes they say well he looks just like a mcgeary and they would be referring to my family they wouldn't be talking about my brother david i hope not right because why the family identity has changed because there's a representation of mcgeary in david and leslie mcgiri and that's what a magiri looks like and amigiri acts like and that's why you pray very hard for a new birth and you can see a certain representation there in that family but then once the man marries a another woman the child of that changes the dynamics of that family it has a different expression as a different nature different uh nurture that's going to come forth and so there's when it says the woman is the point of departure she is another division and it doesn't have to be a tremendous variance as you'll see in the original it just would have produced another son of god in the same image but yet she becomes the point where sinus the birth of a son to a family it establishes a new family identity and this is something that god desired therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother in genesis chapter 3 verse 16 it says thou speaking of the woman thou shalt bring forth children because now that she's mother she's this this point of departure where another branch it's like a branch coming off don't when you think a point of departure or division don't think something being cut off or or variance it's just another branch through that mother comes another branch of a tree through the mother because another point of departure from the same tree the same life now it establishes another branch off of that with children it's exactly how you draw the tree up the family tree up amen it's through these unions so the woman shall bring forth children that word there is bane it's sun and in the hebrew son means the builder of the family name because you have the father who has a name then through the wife she becomes mother and a son comes forth and now he's a multiplication of the father therefore he's a builder of the family name he's an expression of the family character thou shalt bring forth a son thou shalt bring forth children so this is what's being expressed here you have a man who leaves father and mother and cleaves to his wife and they shall be one flesh and we'll just i'm just trying to look at where we are and just how much time we're going to have here now that scripture shows to us in one sense you could say spiritually that adam's prophesying that he leaves father god and even mother garden of eden to follow his wife out in sin so he came from god as a spirit being he came from the earth mother earth as a as a fleshly being and he forsook the garden of eden he forsook his relationship with god to join to his wife so that she would escape punishment to portray christ but there's a family picture being expressed here it says for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother so it paints a picture where there's a man who has a father and a man who has a mother and he now as a son marries and he becomes husband and the woman becomes wife and now they have children and now they are father and mother and there's a son and it's just like a family tree or the the hierarchy of a family everything is branching down and that's the expression that's given in this so it says a man shall leave his father mother and cleave that means to be joined together to stay with to stick to so he's going to leave he's going to be joined to his wife and they shall become one flesh again that word the root word there and the word that's used as basar that publication they shall be one body they are now one expression one publication and so when this says for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother therefore shall a man leave his father and mother that they shall be one flesh it points to the purpose of the union it points to the purpose of being husband and wife you have male and female that's wonderful but male must become husband and female must become wife it's wonderful to be husband and wife but what god's desiring will is is that husband becomes father and wife becomes mother and i know that can be very difficult to those who are unable to have children or those who desire to have children it's very complicated but i love to mention this as a way of encouragement that when you go to the bible every single woman in the bible who was ever barren eventually conceived and had a child every single one now you might say well that's discouraging because i'm barren and i haven't had a child think about it god did not want to give one representation in the holy scripture of a barren woman who didn't conceive so that you wouldn't misappropriate your faith and say well i just must be her he made sure that every womb that was barren eventually conceived and brought forth life so that you would have no other place to plant your faith than a barren woman conceiving and being fruitful he wants you to believe for that he wants you to to look to that but we are looking to the the the ultimate purpose and the perfect image that god desired the purpose of the union was to produce another son in the image of the father and they too shall be one flesh how through the union when that son comes forth can the father claim it more his own than the mother it's just like solomon's saying a husband and wife they're getting a divorce they have one kid they're fighting over who gets possession of the kid and the and the king just the judge like i got it let's just cut him in half you can't do it it's one flesh so then in genesis chapter 3 verse 20 this is very significant after the fall and woman has conceived not just of adam but of another seed adam called his wife's name eve why is the name changing because it changed adam's the one that names he's the one that gave names to all the animals he's the one that named woman capital w now she is woman because she's taken from men but now her relationship changes because now she's not just woman she's going to be mother and he changes her name but not his she becomes eve because she's the mother of all living and in that it speaks to what to what the fall was because now the family is broken in genesis chapter 2 verse 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother that means the man is the product of the union of father and mother he is the expression of father and mother he is their genes he is their dna he is their nature he now comes and as a man he is to marry a woman and they're to be joined together they're to cleave together in there to be one flesh and so the child that's to be produced from them any sons that are come from them are to be of the man but now when eve becomes the mother of all living they are not all one flesh and that's when the image of god leaves adam because oneness is lost the family is broken we understand what the original sin was the children born the first child born to adam and the woman is not adam reproduced it's not one flesh there's been a this unity now that's been formed within the family and so now you have adam and the woman and the first son that comes forth is not of adam and the second son is so what do you create you've created a hybrid you've created a mixture so the creation of god was no longer in the perfect reflection of heaven the original held the image adam held the image of male and female and in that image he was commanded to be fruitful and multiply to fulfill god's commandment they had to become man and wife we're just trying to recap this so you follow where i'm going they had to become man and wife that's a family man and woman together as a family and then bri the bringing forth of children would be the completed image why because you would see a cycle of life you'd see a cycle of the image being reproduced you have god the father who brings forth the son brings forth the daughter and now god now adam and the woman to bring forth the sun they would bring forth the daughter there was a way of multiplication where now this would be replicated over and over until the purpose of the earth is complete and finished i don't know perhaps we'll rely on a lot of things that have already been said but it would have been a cycle of reproduction according to the law of god's reproduction so then you have male and female now it's man and woman and the woman was to become a further expression of this image and then children would be the completed image and the cycle would begin again but this perfect picture is marred and the perfect picture before sin marred the image was a family that's it that's what it was husband and wife as god's children father god adam a son the woman a daughter brother bram says in the identified masterpiece of god let us turn our thoughts from michelangelo understand the parallel he's drawing now michelangelo created this masterpiece of moses he said to the great sculptor oh my god almighty who in the beginning before there was a day or dawn of day for there was an atom of or molecule god in his mind had man what a man should look like what he should be and what he should act like and he wanted that man to be a part of him so he made man in his own image and in the likeness of god created he man oh when god in the beginning made this masterpiece something that reflected his thoughts so we saw how creation evolved and even how adam was perfect but yet there were still things he could do to become more like god man has become as one of us lest he reach forth his hand and live forever let's stop him there so we see that he's a masterpiece now this then the masterpiece is a picture that's unfolding and a masterpiece it's a work that surpasses excellence but when i went and i found it in the original where we get the word masterpiece from is from dutch or german and it's a work by which a craftsman attains the rank of master so you could be a you could be a craftsman and you could do something and do something but finally one day you create something and by that work you were acknowledged as being the master you acknowledge as being the ultimate so this is when this brother says god he made this masterpiece this is something where god expresses his true craftsmanship his true excellence this is the work that exceeds everything else that had been done before in his creation that was good that was good this is very good but now god through adam god through each god through esau this is his masterpiece in genesis chapter 2 verse 25. because now this is the masterpiece is initially reflected in adam but now at the conclusion of chapter 2 and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed this is the conclusion of god's creation not just one man but adam and his wife adam with his esha this this this wife that's with him so adam was a was the beginning of the masterpiece as the sculptor was bringing it forth but now notice this is a masterpiece man and wife so brother bam says in the message the masterpiece now we see them as a masterpiece family in the garden of eden how beautiful it was it so pleased him until he took rest then he said i'll rest but while he was resting and trusting to his masterpiece his enemy come in and found this great masterpiece now i read that to emphasize this broadband is calling the family unit husband and wife the masterpiece so it's not just a masterpiece man but it's the man and the woman together are the masterpiece and he's calling it a family and what he's expressing here is a particular arrest wherein god at the end of genesis chapter 2 husband and wife are together as god a king and queen upon earth ruling in their domain and he says i'm going to leave it to hint them i've commanded them i've given them everything they need given the word i've created everything so now god is going to let them the word express itself and the word unfold that's the rest that brother brown's talking about he kind of just took a step back and he was going to let the word unfold and that's when satan came in and marred the masterpiece abraham uses this phrase notice the great masterpiece of the family it's in another place in masterpiece the great masterpiece what's the great masterpiece the family a few paragraphs later same message this masterpiece was walled by the word god's word and the masterpiece itself of the family was fortified by this word again i'm just using this to emphasize that brother branham identified the masterpiece not just adam but man and woman husband and wife family and they're walled by genesis 1 28-30 right be fruitful multiply replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish and all the living creatures and these things you can eat and this is the commandment that god gave them they're walled by the word now look in the bible at genesis chapter 2 verses 16 to 17 or look over my shoulder at the screen behind me but genesis chapter 2 verses 16 to 17 because this is part of the commandment that man has placed behind and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat this is the this is the wall of the word that they're behind but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat is thereof thou shalt surely die so a man receives a commandment when they're male and female spirit being genesis 1 28 to 30. now that he's in flesh because now he can actually eat and partake of these things he says of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat and now because he's in flesh in his certain physical attributes this next commandment becomes more relevant but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die now it was in violating this that caused the fall now just think and i want to go quickly because i realize maybe for some i'm getting i'm getting passed past that alarm that alarm clock in their heads but the wrong what happened here is there was trees that they could eat from and there was trees that they weren't supposed to eat from so in the fall what happened the wrong tree was partaken from and it created the wrong branch or another tree in other words the wrong when they took of the tree of knowledge of good and evil it was the wrong family tree they were a tree they were family they were to branch off and remain one tree but now when they partook of the tree of knowledge and good and evil it's a different family tree because look in the scripture trees do what yield fruit after its kind this is the law of reproduction genesis 1 11 a tree is to yield fruit after its kind in genesis chapter 1 verse 29 it says a tree yielding seed trees trees yield seed trees having seed will yield seed and bring forth fruit so when they partook of the tree of knowledge of good and evil it was a mixing of family trees and what dude what did it do it produced a hybrid and so this is wherein the fall takes place they were wall behind the word as a tree bring forth of your kind but now that the tree of knowledge of good and evil just speaks of the wrong kind of tree now just think of it whether you just want to take this symbolically when god wanted to multiply adam he took his rib genesis chapter 2 verses 22 and there was a law of reproduction genesis 1 11 that a tree adam as a tree he has seed within himself he has something in himself that can bring forth of its kind god took the rib and was able to take a body and make it and put the woman in it when he takes the rib remember that it means a beam or plank of wood and the very same word of rib is used as of a beam which comes from wood which is a tree in first kings chapter six you'll find that it's the word ribbons uses boards of cedar which represent purity in planks of fur which represents nobility so there was this purity there was this nobility in the rib there this was it's spoken of a beam spoken of a plank of wood that represents purity and nobility and genesis 2 17 refers to a tree and that word for tree it means wood timber plank so listen i'm not trying to get complicated here i just want you to think very how the scriptures back up time and time again what happened in genesis chapter three what happened is the wrong building materials were used to make a sun do not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil a tree which has fruit after its kind a tree which is yielding seed do not use the wood and timber of another tree do not use of different building materials of good and evil that word their evil just means not agreeable don't mix don't bring them together it mix the family tree and that's where the fall was but the original masterpiece walled behind the word of genesis 1 28 genesis 2 16-17 it was a family bill graham continuing the masterpiece the great sculptor when he seen the fall of his family the masterpiece he wasn't willing to leave it lay there face down and ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish and lay there like that all the time because he's god and he will not be defeated so what is he going to bring back his family he's not willing to leave the masterpiece of his family laying their face down because he's god and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately he began to build again unto his own image so what he what he's going to redeem is his image now i'm going to go quickly through a few of these quotes here and identified masterpiece of god he beca he talks about how the prophets were a reflection they were the foundation but then when christ comes he's the expressed image once again you he's seen his own reflection when one man was born on earth from the womb of a woman that was god's masterpiece remember adam at one point was god's masterpiece it was the son of god jesus christ the reason he was because he was perfectly the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us skipping to paragraph 84. now we find that it reflected him perfectly the sculptor now had the word reflected in the masterpiece again called his son god emmanuel what god wasn't just going to leave it there the masterpiece we find him the entire handiwork of god we find him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word the fullness of the word now again god has the perfect masterpiece again and i'll just read these spots he says my masterpiece behold my servant my masterpiece there he is in his own image reflecting god reflected in the masterpiece in his own likeness god back again in his own likeness the word form being reflected in the image of a man the masterpiece paragraph 70 all the prophets had flaws all the ones was a portion but here at the last coming up through finally comes the masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all so perfect reflected of the builder himself in his own image was reflected in his work god and christ are one in so much until he put his own spirit into him and even the image and the builder became one god and his sculpture work his masterpiece wow this is what god makes god who he is but remember it's not just the man that's the masterpiece because he was just a reflection of the highest in heaven but in ephesians chapter 3 verses 14 and 15 for this cause i bow my knees into the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named there's a reflections there's got to be a reflection on earth of family just as there is in heaven and i'll say this because i'm hoping i can finish what i have before me this morning but if not let me say this your earthly family is a reflection of a heavenly family for this cause i bow my knees unto the father the generator the male ancestor so now god is the father bowman is to the father the generator the father of who the lord jesus christ he's the son so what's coming into view the family again just as he had father god and adam the son of god now the very image is coming back again the father the generator the male ancestor law of the lord jesus christ the son the builder of the family name says of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named of whom and i was just studying this recently and i found that there's actually a big theological controversy over who the whom is and i thought it was interesting because really either way it's the same name amen it's coming from the same essence it's it's they're one either way it's the same name either way it's the same family whether you want to say it's of whom the whole family is named after our lord jesus christ or it's named after our father well who's the lord jesus christ named after amen right i mean if a equals b and b equals c a we'll see it's it's the same in this what did god do he exalted him and gave him a name which is above all names the son is the builder of the family name it wasn't his own name but it was the god's name that was given to him jesus said in john 5 43 i come in my father's name so what did you come and he came in the name of his father it was his the lord jesus christ is the name of god the lord jesus christ is the name of him lord god is jesus christ that's his name he says if another shall come in his own name you'll receive him what does it mean to come in your own name no divine origin no passing down you have not gotten it from your father you have your own name it's of their own will it's not a name given but people just give themselves a name and people believe them i'm this i'm that i'm so and so eighth messenger i'm a prophet i'm the successor i'm jesus christ whatever and people believe that wasn't given to them by god but of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named beings are grouped together by relationship to their father and what happens they get a name even the tribes of israel bore the names of the father the progenitor the beginning of that tribe the children of who israel they're grouped together by their originator by their father so by whom when it says the family is named it derives its origin and being from god the family in heaven earth derives its origin from god just as children derive their name from their father the father of the family now i know different cultures that may be a little bit different but just bear with me as an american and god's only provided place of worship he had in his heart noticed this before the foundation of the world a son because he is a father now notice where the sun is but it was still in the genes of his word that's where the son was and he created a man and he put him on freemore agency but that man fell but the great sculptor god who made man from the dust of the earth he didn't settle for that he started making man again and he made noah he died drunk he made moses that failed to keep his word he made prophets that run in the time of trouble he kept building and molding until after a while he wanted a masterpiece to reflect him his nature what was in his heart what a son should be what should a son be he is the father again that's why jesus expressed oneness that's why he talked to god as his father this is what god had in his mind in the beginning he didn't want to just have a family he wanted to become a family he wanted to become a father in order for him to become a father he had to become a son but it's god be coming what a son should be one day down on jordan after that masterpiece had been formed and made here he comes sending down on the wings of a dove this is him he was so enthused with this masterpiece until he struck him on calvary that he would die for the rest of us was imperfect that through the shedding of his blood listen he might bring many masterpieces being a bride to his son he had to take the masterpiece and strike a blow in his side and take a rib the beam the plank the building material from the same family tree and bring forth many sons the bible says in bringing many sons into glory the bible says for whom he did for no he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren that word their brethren is a delphos and a is the the the prefix a which means joined and delphas which is womb so what does that mean if you're brethren you were joined in the womb same originator same genes the first born among many brethren that means you have to come from the same womb jesus christ came from he said what do you mean mary no the womb of the word amen the spoken word of god amen you have to come from that same mind the same place that jesus i come from god i go to god your brethren you share this unity whom he did for no he predestined to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among what many masterpieces to his son he predestines you to be conformed that word the greek word is sumorphos which means what is the essence and character thus it is complete and durable not just a form or an outline when you've been predestined to be conformed you're not just in the likeness you do not just resemble but you are the essence essence of his essence substance of his substance life of his life power of his power he has predestined you to be the very essence of the sun the very life of the sun the very power of the sun this is what the scriptures teach us that he might be the firstborn among many brethren why he was the image of what a son should be and god wanted more brother man said god foresaw and predestinated a world of sons and daughters this is what god saw he saw and predestinated a world of sons and daughters and he connects it with the commission of genesis 1 28 gone to the beginning commissioned adam and eve to multiply and replenish the earth says now in this god foresaw and predestinated a world of sons and daughters james chapter 1 verse 18 of his own will beget he us with the word of truth that which should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures what is james referring to himself now christ was the firstborn now james being born again by the word of god says we're the beginning of the next masterpiece we're the we're kind of the first fruits of his creation because it's not just a man jesus christ now it's a family this is what's being reflected now i'm only going to share these statements very quickly here to to emphasize this to because we've we emphasized the bride part but we mentioned last time it's got to become more individual and more personal so brother bam says in the masterpiece now we could go on with that but i believe you have a picture of what i mean god building back his masterpiece but let us not forget that in the beginning when he smote the side of adam because we could see adam and now christ the first man the second man the last adam first man's a living soul the second man's a quickening spirit he's like don't just stop with christ the masterpiece he says now the smiting of christ was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride he might take him a bride so when his masterpiece was perfected then he had to smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but of the same creation it's the same material it's the rib it's the beam it's the plank it's the same family tree paragraph 157 he's going to bring this little bride that's smitten right back to the side of the original word and there he is there's the masterpiece the family back again in the garden of eden paragraph 174 the great masterpiece of the family the second adam and the second eve now ready for the garden now this catch the language that he's using then it's the masterpiece of the family again that family had been broken now god's bringing it back he's someone in the form of a bride to the son christ so you have god with the son and now you have many sons and daughters that he might be the firstborn among many brethren and you see that now god's becoming more than just christ he's becoming in his family of sons and daughters that he foresaw and predestinated to be essence of his essence to be the essence in character not just to form an outline but the but it the way brother branham said it's perfect she is him and let me say this then to make it personal family even in a natural way is a reflection of god's first masterpiece it's part as sons and daughters of god come forth and they are the further furthering of the beginning of the creation of god now we as a family are part of the creation of god we have a role to play that we're facing the completion of that word spiritually as the bride we're fulfilling god's desire to become a family but that's that's the ultimate but how do we achieve that there's something that god's doing in us naturally to bring us to that the supernatural becoming flesh uh well in us bill braun says in the message identification i've got two quotes on this slide i if it would encourage you just to kind of find that unction maybe to to wake up i'm here and this is the end and that's just a few inches we're almost there really without context that means nothing because i could preach an hour on what's there but identification brother says the whole thing is god becoming material that's what's happening it's the rib it's a materialization it's god becoming these things unfolding but then he says like a husband and wife becoming one together god and his church becoming one so that's the spiritual that's the supernatural we can say that's the ultimate if you're part of that that's the ultimate but then god also wants a reflection of it now in a husband and wife that's god becoming material and sirs we would see jesus it's god becoming tangible your own wife you and your husband is just a shadow and a negative of god and his wife the church so you are then the negative not in in a photographic sense not a negative in a good versus evil sense but you're the negative in others god is taking the picture and you're the picture you're the negative and what god wants to do is he wants to bring that image to a place where he can develop the picture into his image where you can express a relationship as a man to a woman as husband to wife and a husband love his wife as christ loves the church and the wife references her husband as the church references christ and they become a family as god desires himself to be a family you realize your relationships mean something whether they just with the relationships we have in the church relationships we have with our neighbor the relationship we have with our wife and to our children to our spouse they mean something the condition of the family the order of the family means something it all has meaning otherwise the bible wouldn't teach about it the bible would be very very short but this bible from the very beginning is dealing with relationships from the very beginning it's a family and the family dynamics and what unfolds and the and the mixing in the family and everything's related to a brother aaron it's people they're part of family this is what's expressed then you say well it's kind of a big dub well that's just all done together but that's what's being portrayed relationships families disagreements findings and then when god calls abram what does he call me says i see it and i see it after and the old testament becomes all about what a man in his family god is expressing something in this ephesians 3 15 of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named the every family in heaven the whole family in heaven there's a family in heaven so god has set a pattern in heaven of a family there's order there's arrangement there's responsibilities there's duties there's relationships among the different angels there there's all sorts of responsibilities in this great tabernacle in heaven and so there's a family in heaven with order and an arrangement of hosts and when one got out of order what did it cause a fall and it's cast down to earth and then we see the same thing reflecting itself here but there is a family in heaven named after the lord jesus christ and therefore your family on earth has a divine appointment and a divine anointment to manifest god on earth we say well i'm in the likeness we're just deranged i'm the father i had a son through my wife so we're just by name and by dna where family know look beyond just the carnal natural arrangement of having a children and living in the same house and sharing a mortgage or whatever it might be but i want you to realize that as a believer as a son and daughter of god you have a divine appointment but don't just look at it as well i've been called to do this i've been called this but you've been anointed to do it there is provision to make it in that placing your family on earth is called to reflect the highest in heaven it's called to be a representation of that family in heaven but god will also give you what you need to manifest his image and i believe in this age the climax of god's creation is going to be expressed in families under the word families becoming the word token families third pool families and that doesn't mean we've memorized all the songs out of trinidad or it doesn't mean that we could type everything about the seventh hill but it means we live the life amen the life lived by the word would be the word expressed is the if the third pool is the word of god unfolding the word of god being made manifest it's the word full word being born into manifestation then a life lived by that is the expression of it so brother banner makes this statement this is where i'm closing the musicians would come and the masterpiece paragraph 176 you'll see there's maybe a tight grouping of a lot of these statements he says notice the great masterpiece of the family what we saw in the beginning in the beginning god created a family and then in the beginning of the creation of god what would it be again a family yeah that's what it would have to be it's another family so the great masterpiece is the family the husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they are one so there's something that's being expressed here that is beautiful that requires more time that we'll we'll come back to it as the lord leads brother brown begins to describe what a masterpiece family is they're not truly a family unless they're one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family what's become a family tree of good and evil he says a wife pulling one way and the husband the other that would make an awful family you don't think this message deals with these things why is why is there such a a knee-jerk reaction for people to kind of put a scarlet letter on anybody that wants to preach or teach or do something for families i preached a sermon one time on the original marriage covenant and the restoration of the original marriage covenant and i was making the point that it's we always get out of that he can she can't and so the guy always has this card in the back of his pocket said i'm going to divorce you because i can get married again but you can't and i just you could see in the open of the word that god's restored us back to the original marriage covenant where there ought to be more of a nature of christ in men why did god grant a rid of divorce because the hard hearts of men that's why i gave you divorce because you men have hard hearts if god has turned our hearts maybe we could have softer hearts if you want to talk to me about it later i'm more than happy to talk about it but someone texts me said i'm listening to sermon you preached i'm really enjoying i'm like well how far into it are you he said 20 minutes i said well hold on you might change your mind because well i'm only listening to it because a brother told me to listen to it he hated it i said let me guess he's been married twice he goes twice looking for a third and so sometimes i wonder why people hate it when you bring things out of the word that talks about family don't hate it yield to it embrace it recognize it as part of god's word brother i'm preaching the masterpiece the masterpiece and he stops and he starts talking about the harmony within a family and he says but in agreement with love one to another that's a family and that's what it was in the beginning and that's what god desires in his church he says and that was god's masterpiece what was god's masterpiece a man and a woman together in agreement in love a family was god's masterpiece and he makes this beautiful statement and all the true family here portrays that and that beautifully brings it right down to where you're sitting today in this courtyard by marriott he brings it right down to husband wife father and mother that a family here portrays that family in the beginning and portrays the masterpiece family of christ and his bride sons and daughters of god all true family here portrays that and now the masterpiece family has come again christ and his bride ready to come the second adam the second eve ready now to return back to their home now before you get discouraged because we can look at families that are broken up listen the the the hurt that comes from family estrangement is so deep it it'll shatter one's emotions to the very core because when there's an estrangement with father and mother it comes right down to even the identity of the son the very ones that birth me the very ones that i bear the name of if they would be willing to do this and do that and we can't achieve harmony and we can't have forgiveness and we can't walk together that will break somebody down to the very essence of who they are as a natural person and bow them down to the earth and we have you've got broken families and sons that go wayward and daughters that don't that aren't in fellowship anymore and there's a lot of circumstances that intervene and then as we bring this picture up you can start oh a heart can be broken and you become discouraged but brother brown says the masterpiece family has come again and notice it was broken one time it got separated but god redeemed it so he says they're coming back to their home and the whole picture has been redemption from where it was bringing it back just exactly bringing it back again then if god brought that family back again then i believe god can bring your family back again that's a promise you can stand on it doesn't matter how long 25 years abraham wants to testify it doesn't matter how long noah wants to testify it doesn't matter if it seems like it's dead lazarus wants to testify god can bring it back why because it's about redemption i believe god can do it for you i believe he wants to do it for you and all you can do is your part and trust to him let's stand to our feet [Music] praise the lord [Music] if you have a need today i god has dealt with my heart to to take the subjects we've been ministering on even on wednesday nights and on sundays and it's just climax too this subject of a family pray for me as i desire just to follow the will of the lord to minister those things that will be edifying to you as a church not just make great material but something of substance to you god didn't just take any material of adam he took the rib because it represented something and those are the kind of things i want to express is something that can be built into something pure something noble so pray as god leads us as we continue but i believe coming to this will make it personally relevant for every single one of us whether you're a daughter or a son a husband or a wife a father a mother a grandparent or a member of a church there's something we can learn from this with their heads bowed i'd like to specifically pray if you'd want to lift your hands if there'd be someone that said lord i want my family to be one i don't want to be an awful family lord but lord give me the spirit and nature of christ to do my part to pull together with my husband to pull together with my wife in agreement and love to another he said that's a family and that's god's masterpiece and you say lord i want my family to portray that and if your hands are raised desiring that your family would portray that if there's anything broken in the relationships then i challenge you to take god in his word he's a redeemer he's a restorer he could bring prodigals back he can bring way ruins back he can mend things that are broken just commit it to him our gracious heavenly fathers we stand today as a bride as family as a local church that's a family a family with we call them sister churches gathered together lord we look to you now as a son of god as daughters of god and we come boldly before the throne of grace knowing that if a son would ask his father for an egg would he get a stone for his fish would he get a serpent no we could come asking knowing that you as our heavenly father are desirous to give us the right things [Music] and lord we ask today that if the climax of your creation was a family arranged by the word a family in agreement in harmony and love then i lay my pride down i lay my flesh down i lay my wants down and i make myself subject to that that my family could be in agreement be in harmony and be one lord i pray that our families here whether it be families of three or just a couple or a grandparent a father and mother lord whether it be a family of six seven twelve doesn't matter whatever it may be lord may our families even for any widows and widowers lord even those who are single lord may they portray christ so what do i do i'm a single man christ was a masterpiece what i do i'm a widow that you can be that masterpiece that expression of the bride lord help us to do our parts and let our relate let us express christ in our relationships let us remind ourselves that everyone we come in contact with we ought to treat them as if they're christ let us remind ourselves that it's eternal life to live for others lord let us do those things which are right in your sight lord i pray that you would help us to be better husbands and better wives better fathers and better mothers better children for your kingdom that this church arizona believers church could be a powerhouse for you an end for lost souls for the hurt and wounded i pray that you would give us a clear vision and may we walk in it lord bless your people today and as i before i say amen lord may i rehearse once again to believe in the power of redemption to never dealt to not fear but just as that father on a daily basis came and stood on a particular pace on a front porch knowing that if my son started his journey this morning this is about the time that he would come back if we have an expression in the parable of the father that was always looking for his wayward son to come back may we by eyes of faith look down that dusty road believing that one day we'll see them come may we not doubt or resist and certainly lord may we not get in the way with arrogance and judgment and harshness but may we become so sweet and salty so christ-like that it draws the christ out of them back to the word we commit this to you now father we love you we praise you lord bless your people in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
