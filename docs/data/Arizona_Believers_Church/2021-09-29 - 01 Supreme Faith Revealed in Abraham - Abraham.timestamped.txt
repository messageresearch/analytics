[0:00] i'm going to be reading in romans
[0:02] chapter four
[0:03] i'm gonna start with verse one i
[0:04] originally wanted to start with verse 12
[0:07] and then just realized
[0:08] um
[0:09] and kind of getting very focused on just
[0:11] a few verses there kind of might be
[0:13] cutting off some things
[0:14] and so
[0:16] i wanted to start a subject on abraham
[0:19] examining abraham's life i'd been
[0:22] reading in it and it just struck me just
[0:24] some simple things and in a way of just
[0:26] demystifying his faith um there's just
[0:30] may even touch on it just a little bit
[0:32] and then i mentioned to the children
[0:33] that this is where i was going to be
[0:34] going i kind of test they're my test
[0:37] case first i mention it to them and
[0:39] uh if they can at least some get gained
[0:41] some interest no i don't test them but i
[0:43] just mentioned having to mention it to
[0:44] them this past week and they said it was
[0:46] really exciting because that's what they
[0:47] were doing in sunday school so the the
[0:49] continuity i think will be nice as a
[0:51] church if there's some parallels romans
[0:53] chapter 4 verse 1
[0:54] what shall we say then that abraham our
[0:57] father
[0:59] as pertaining to the flesh hath found
[1:01] for if abraham were justified by works
[1:03] he hath whereof to glory but not before
[1:06] god for what saith the scripture abraham
[1:09] believed god and it was counted unto him
[1:11] for righteousness
[1:12] now to him that worketh is the reward
[1:14] not reckoned of grace but of debt but to
[1:17] him that worketh not but believeth on
[1:19] him that justify the ungodly his faith
[1:22] is counted for righteousness even as
[1:24] david also describeth the blessedness of
[1:26] the man unto whom god imputeth
[1:28] righteousness without works saying
[1:30] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[1:32] forgiven and whose sins are covered
[1:34] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[1:36] not impute sin
[1:37] cometh this blessedness then upon the
[1:40] circumcision only or upon the
[1:42] uncircumcision also we say that faith
[1:44] was reckoned to abraham for
[1:46] righteousness how was it then reckoned
[1:48] when he was in circumcision or in
[1:49] uncircumcision not in circumcision but
[1:52] in uncircumcision but he received the
[1:54] sign of circumcision a seal of
[1:56] righteousness of the faith which he had
[1:58] yet been uncircumcised then he might be
[2:01] the father of all them that believe
[2:03] though they be not circumcised that
[2:05] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[2:07] also
[2:08] and the father of circumcision to them
[2:10] who are not of the circumcision only but
[2:13] who also walk in the steps of that faith
[2:15] of our father abraham which he hath
[2:18] which he had been yet uncircumcised
[2:21] for the promise that he should be the
[2:23] heir of the world was not to abraham or
[2:25] to his seed through the law but through
[2:27] the righteousness of faith for they
[2:29] which are of the law be heirs faith is
[2:31] made void and the promise made of none
[2:33] effect
[2:34] because the law worketh wrath for where
[2:35] no law is there is no transgression
[2:38] therefore it is of faith that it might
[2:40] be
[2:40] by grace to the end of the promise might
[2:43] to the end the promise might be sure to
[2:45] all seed not to that only which is of
[2:47] the law but to that also which is of the
[2:50] faith of abraham who is the father of us
[2:53] all as it is written i've made the
[2:55] father of many nations before him whom
[2:57] he believed even god who quickeneth the
[2:59] dead and calleth those things which be
[3:01] not as though they were who against hope
[3:04] believed in hope that he might become
[3:06] the father of many nations according to
[3:08] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[3:11] be
[3:12] amen you can take your seats this
[3:13] evening
[3:14] i have my title before you it's supreme
[3:17] faith
[3:18] revealed in abraham supreme
[3:21] faith revealed in abraham and it's
[3:24] looking at it from the standpoint that
[3:26] by looking into abraham's life
[3:28] and in examining his life and looking at
[3:31] his his stories we can grab it from the
[3:33] scriptures
[3:34] that there's something that the believer
[3:36] can begin to identify in his life that's
[3:38] going to disclose or unfold or reveal to
[3:40] us what supreme faith looks like
[3:44] and as we've been ministering on blind
[3:46] trust bad faith i think some of these uh
[3:49] things kind of dovetail and fake
[3:51] work into one another but i just felt
[3:53] very moved even though some things i had
[3:54] in my heart in speaking on blind trust
[3:57] that we i just didn't feel that unction
[3:59] to deal with i just feel god's moving me
[4:01] um to look at this subject but there is
[4:03] some kind of tie-in and connection to
[4:05] some of these themes i feel like we're
[4:07] just taking a step further that we
[4:09] wouldn't just look at blind trust and
[4:10] bad faith but really just look at
[4:12] supreme faith and begin to recognize
[4:14] what that looks like and i want to use
[4:17] this statement that we have
[4:19] used over the few a few services here
[4:21] recently from baum and gilead where
[4:23] brother graham says the one thing that
[4:24] we have to move up to now is a supreme
[4:27] faith to what we have had
[4:29] he says you cannot have that faith until
[4:32] you know perfectly what you are doing so
[4:34] that
[4:34] that as we mentioned before that put
[4:36] some of us make us a little uneasy uh
[4:39] maybe some of us who are very
[4:40] presumptuous and very bold and think we
[4:42] know everything that's like oh good i've
[4:43] got this licked i've got supreme faith
[4:46] but remember brother brahm said if you
[4:47] do have supreme faith then what are you
[4:49] doing up here for and there's a way that
[4:50] we kind of measure where we're at in
[4:52] terms of our faith growing but he says
[4:54] you cannot have that faith which is
[4:56] supreme faith until you know perfectly
[4:58] what you're doing so
[5:00] notice how he talks about we're trying
[5:02] to move up now so he's not saying you
[5:03] haven't been anywhere you don't have
[5:05] anything but he's recognizing this uh
[5:08] this gradual progression and trajectory
[5:10] of real faith that grows and increases
[5:12] and it doesn't stagnate or fall away so
[5:15] he says we have to know perfectly what
[5:16] we're doing to be in that realm of
[5:18] supreme faith
[5:20] and then
[5:20] we could take that and just immediately
[5:22] say oh well i want supreme faith and by
[5:24] supreme faith i'll be able to create my
[5:26] lattes in the morning uh or my filet
[5:29] mignon in the evening and it kind of
[5:30] just puts it in this realm that man
[5:32] those who have supreme faith can just
[5:33] always shoot a squirrel at 300 yards in
[5:35] the eye with the 22 and that's what we
[5:38] think that's what we think supreme faith
[5:40] is but then he just approaches it
[5:42] in such a simple way you just say well
[5:44] i'm going home i'm going out and start
[5:46] the car that's all an act of faith
[5:48] and it starts looking at just daily
[5:50] routine everyday life things that we do
[5:51] every day tomorrow i meet you at a
[5:53] certain place that's all act of faith
[5:55] because you've just done it so much
[5:57] because it's a regular routine with you
[5:59] now he's saying that we ought to move up
[6:01] into supreme faith and instead of him
[6:04] kind of berating us saying well you're
[6:05] not spiritual enough you're not fashion
[6:07] enough you don't understand the seals
[6:08] enough
[6:09] and kind of going down this angle where
[6:11] we've got to figure out all the types
[6:12] and we have to know all the revelations
[6:14] we have to be so deep in the word that
[6:16] uh that these everything makes sense to
[6:18] us he starts talking about
[6:20] an approach in just a daily life and he
[6:22] says
[6:23] you've just done it so much because it's
[6:25] a regular routine with you well that's
[6:27] the way the things of god are
[6:29] that's how we're going to get into
[6:30] supreme faith
[6:32] he says after you've trusted him and
[6:33] watched him do so many things till it
[6:35] becomes just like a regular routine
[6:38] not where it becomes common to you and
[6:40] it doesn't phase you and it doesn't
[6:41] matter it's kind of like
[6:43] i i have a kind of a saying that when
[6:45] god does something we shouldn't be
[6:47] surprised so i say i'm not surprised but
[6:49] i'm still amazed
[6:50] and
[6:51] and it's because it's always it still is
[6:53] amazing even if it's not surprising so
[6:55] after you've trusted him and watched him
[6:57] do so many things till it becomes just
[6:58] like a regular routine it's habit
[7:01] it's in it's something that's taking
[7:03] place and that's the condition i think
[7:04] the church will be in just before the
[7:06] coming of the lord
[7:07] and then this statement so the rapture
[7:09] will just go right on that way
[7:11] all an act of faith
[7:13] it'll just be a regular routine of
[7:15] following the scriptures and the plans
[7:17] of god so instead of getting our eyes on
[7:20] some sort of supreme faith that is uh
[7:22] you know pie in the sky and extravagant
[7:24] and beyond uh just the daily life of the
[7:26] daily routine we're kind of looking for
[7:28] this this climactic moment where
[7:30] everything the whole world is turned
[7:32] upside down and everyone goes oh the
[7:33] branhamites were right we're all doomed
[7:35] it's just a regular everyday life liv
[7:39] hidden in christ
[7:40] serving him walking in the
[7:42] the pattern of the scripture to the
[7:44] cadence of the holy spirit it'll just be
[7:46] a regular routine of following the
[7:48] scriptures and the plans of god so i
[7:50] still want that statement to be before
[7:51] you as we look at the supreme supreme
[7:54] faith as he said this is what we have to
[7:56] be built up to now supreme faith
[7:58] revealed in abraham
[8:00] now this supreme faith we could use it
[8:02] we could use different uh terminologies
[8:04] to describe it it's rapturing faith
[8:07] and when we know where that rapturing
[8:08] faith is contained and where it comes
[8:10] from we also recognize that brother ram
[8:13] talked about a perfect faith
[8:15] and there is a sense where we can
[8:16] identify perfect faith being the faith
[8:18] that is necessary for the moment that
[8:20] you're living in to meet the challenge
[8:22] that you're living in but we realize in
[8:24] the time that we're living in there
[8:25] could be this moments and instances
[8:27] where faith is operating perfectly but
[8:30] there is a promise in this hour of
[8:32] triumph over all sin and even over death
[8:34] and so the faith that meets that mark
[8:36] and the faith to meet that challenge is
[8:38] going to be a perfect faith
[8:40] and if we use terminology supreme faith
[8:42] rapturing faith perfect faith it can be
[8:45] made to seem so mysterious
[8:47] that we sometimes wonder if we even have
[8:49] it
[8:50] and it can be made to seem so
[8:51] unreachable
[8:53] that we almost feel like we haven't even
[8:54] started
[8:56] and we're in and certainly the word can
[8:58] be preached in such a way to where we're
[9:00] just always questioning whether or not
[9:01] we've ever had the holy ghost and then
[9:03] not only are we not questioning we
[9:04] either have the holy ghost now we found
[9:06] out that some people say that you could
[9:08] that you're born again and have eternal
[9:09] life without the holy ghost you start
[9:11] wondering which ball am i juggling and
[9:12] where am i at in the scheme of things
[9:14] and life can get really really confusing
[9:16] very very fast uh with the way the uh
[9:19] sincere people can pervert things and
[9:21] the devil not being sincere wants to be
[9:23] sure that it's perverted and we just
[9:25] always seem unsettled
[9:27] and so there's a
[9:29] there's a i believe even being sincere
[9:31] and i can say i'll just say it for
[9:33] myself even being sincere
[9:35] you can preach mysteries and revelations
[9:38] and doctrines and teachings that are
[9:40] very true and there's no in them they're
[9:42] pure and they're true but you could
[9:43] preach them in such a way to where in
[9:45] the the attitude of it and the purity of
[9:47] it the force of it and the supreme power
[9:49] of it that you can create the wrong
[9:51] picture for people where they start
[9:53] thinking oh well i don't have a chance
[9:55] in the world and i wasn't raised in it
[9:57] and i i was in the world for a while and
[9:59] i doubt it or i backslid or different
[10:01] things can be said to where it just
[10:02] seems like this is a faith that's only
[10:04] for those uh who got
[10:06] got the holy ghost when they were 12
[10:08] never spent a day in the world and and
[10:10] second or third fourth generation
[10:12] message believers everything just lined
[10:14] up perfectly everything in order but
[10:16] what i'm trying to say is this supreme
[10:18] faith isn't always what we think it is
[10:21] it doesn't always manifest itself the
[10:22] way that we think it's going to manifest
[10:24] itself and maybe it's not achieved in
[10:26] the way that we think it's going to be
[10:28] achieved because it's going to come
[10:30] about as an act of faith as we go
[10:32] through the regular routine of following
[10:34] the scriptures in the plans of god
[10:36] not because we can tell you all the
[10:38] horse riders and all the seals and the
[10:40] church ages and which ones overlap and
[10:42] which ones line up and which one when
[10:44] one started and the other one started
[10:45] and it's not getting a quiz right when
[10:47] we're asked questions about what was the
[10:48] name of brother branham's horse and what
[10:50] year did he do this and when did he do
[10:52] that
[10:53] uh those things aren't what builds the
[10:54] supreme faith
[10:56] so if we look at the example of abraham
[10:59] this is what the way it struck me it was
[11:00] just so startling
[11:02] that it was uh just a very overwhelming
[11:05] inspiration that gripped me last week
[11:07] to where i thought oh it just seems such
[11:09] a clear
[11:10] clear channel and this is why i very
[11:11] excited to minister in this we call
[11:14] abraham the great patriarch
[11:16] and the he is the bible mentions a few
[11:19] times we read today already our father
[11:21] abraham
[11:22] and he's also called the father of faith
[11:26] and so if you look at just looking at
[11:27] abraham the abra
[11:29] religions that are derived from abraham
[11:31] the abrahamic religions if you look at
[11:33] there's three major religions in the
[11:36] world that stem from or believe it as
[11:38] abraham being their father and there's
[11:40] over 4 billion followers in the world of
[11:42] these of these religions that's
[11:44] christianity judaism and islam
[11:47] and so you have three these three large
[11:49] religions and
[11:50] what's really remarkable when you think
[11:52] about is pondering that this afternoon
[11:54] how that when it comes to israel
[11:56] there's less than 20 million jews in the
[11:58] world
[11:59] so really you could just take them them
[12:01] out of the number and it's still
[12:02] something like 56 percent of the world
[12:04] fall it believes abraham to be their
[12:06] father
[12:07] christianity and islam themselves
[12:09] together
[12:10] but yet look at how the jews seem to
[12:12] dominate the conversation
[12:14] just at the heart of it israel and all
[12:16] the controversy less than 20 million
[12:18] people
[12:19] and so when you think about that in
[12:21] terms of over 4 billion followers of
[12:23] these abrahamic religions and believe
[12:25] abraham is their father christians
[12:27] muslims jews
[12:29] all look to this one man as being the
[12:32] father of their religion and where their
[12:34] faith tracks back to it's over half 56
[12:36] nearly 60 percent of the entire world is
[12:39] saying hey we believe that abraham's the
[12:40] father of our religion the father of our
[12:42] faith
[12:43] and so he looms so large
[12:46] as a legend of faith right himself
[12:48] having a legendary faith
[12:50] and when we look at within our bible
[12:53] about abraham we look in the old
[12:54] testament or even understand the rich
[12:56] tradition of the jews and judaism and
[12:58] then even understanding islam and their
[13:00] their faith and their belief
[13:03] in in abraham that he has such an
[13:05] unshakable faith
[13:07] think of the influence that that abraham
[13:09] has had to to have over four or over
[13:13] four billion followers and that would
[13:14] actually put him in a more unique
[13:15] category than jesus
[13:19] right
[13:20] in the sense that
[13:22] uh so many uh so many of the billions of
[13:24] the islam and so many of the the
[13:26] millions of the jews don't even regard
[13:28] jesus as being the messiah
[13:30] uh though some would in the jewish faith
[13:32] believe that he could be a prophet and
[13:34] islam believing him to be a prophet
[13:36] um this is something that abraham then
[13:39] has like such a
[13:41] a powerful
[13:42] figure in religion and in the world
[13:44] today and he has the faith that seemed
[13:46] to have been he's the father of faith
[13:48] he's the patriarch he's the founder he's
[13:50] the originator and so we think his faith
[13:52] is unshakable his faith is uncompromised
[13:55] and if we're not careful it seems
[13:56] unreachable
[13:58] he's like it's abraham right i i i can
[14:01] believe that i'm a son of abraham but i
[14:03] can never be a like abraham and i think
[14:06] there's a little i don't i don't want to
[14:07] use the word mythology as it relates to
[14:10] abraham but his legend can become myth
[14:13] when we start looking at the wrong way
[14:15] and we start attributing certain things
[14:17] and and building certain stories in our
[14:19] minds to where his faith seems as if it
[14:22] is so far out of reach that we just some
[14:24] we have some sort of connection to him
[14:27] but yet really we're not walking in the
[14:28] same faith and so my goal is to to make
[14:31] the faith of abraham's practical
[14:34] and make it so practical that it can
[14:36] work in us to the supernatural
[14:38] that we come back even as we've been
[14:40] identifying in blind trust and bad faith
[14:42] the whole point was to get us to stop
[14:45] mixing things in with our faith that
[14:47] faith ought to be pure into the word we
[14:49] don't want to mix anything with our
[14:51] faith we don't want to take that faith
[14:52] and put it in anything else
[14:54] any any kind of diet or medical approach
[14:56] or anything that faith that is to the
[14:58] word is to the word alone so we take
[15:01] that trust and that conviction and we
[15:02] keep it firmly planted in the word and
[15:04] then we don't add anything to the word
[15:06] that our faith is being projected to
[15:08] because that'll bring disappointment
[15:10] and so we were trying just to take a
[15:11] step back and realize reckon ourselves
[15:13] to be true christians genuine believers
[15:15] in the word of god who trust in god who
[15:17] have a reason for our faith
[15:19] and that there's a process of god making
[15:22] a promise fulfilling the promise that
[15:23] builds our faith and that's us fallen in
[15:26] the regular routine of scripture and the
[15:28] plans of god so we want the faith of
[15:31] abraham to be so practical in our lives
[15:33] that it works into the supernatural
[15:36] and that we begin to see the supreme
[15:37] faith it works into supreme faith to
[15:39] supreme faith and it's exercised in our
[15:42] lives and we can see the hand of god in
[15:45] our in our walk
[15:46] in this world
[15:48] in hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 just
[15:50] referencing this very quickly
[15:52] it says looking under jesus and i'm only
[15:54] using this scripture for this phrase the
[15:56] author and finisher of our faith
[15:59] he's the author he's the he's the one
[16:01] that leads the chief the one that in
[16:03] being the first affords the example but
[16:05] it means the leader or originator he is
[16:07] the author he is the beginner he's the
[16:09] originator of our faith and then this is
[16:12] comforting because even in the language
[16:14] that's being used he begins your faith
[16:16] but faith begins as a seed and it grows
[16:19] and it increases and it matures and it
[16:21] gets better and better he's the author
[16:23] and finisher or perfecter
[16:26] there's many translations that could
[16:27] even render it as as you look at the
[16:29] greek and commentators that would say
[16:31] that is the perfecter of our faith
[16:33] so identify this in this scripture faith
[16:36] has an origin but it also has a destiny
[16:38] amen
[16:39] it has a beginning and it has a
[16:40] completion it has a fullness and there's
[16:43] degrees of faith and there's levels of
[16:45] faith and there's faith that can grow
[16:46] and i think that all of us can
[16:48] fellowship together in this that no
[16:50] matter how long we've been serving god
[16:52] how long we've believed the message or
[16:55] or what we've been through what we've
[16:56] experienced if we have genuine faith
[16:58] it's a faith that grows
[17:00] and that we all can say we're in this
[17:02] growing process together unless i just
[17:04] happen to be missing somebody who's
[17:06] sitting here in a glorified body and if
[17:07] so i apologize
[17:09] you might want to check it because it's
[17:10] not as glorious as maybe you think it is
[17:12] but if we're not in that state if we're
[17:15] still breathing
[17:16] i still have breath and we realize
[17:17] there's got to be more practical
[17:19] outworking of this faith that gets
[17:21] stronger and gets more robust and then
[17:23] i'm taking a step back and realizing
[17:25] that supreme faith doesn't mean i'm
[17:26] going to be able to go over to some
[17:28] everybody who's sick and anybody who's
[17:30] doubting and everyone's just like did
[17:32] you notice the halo on his head isn't
[17:33] this amazing this guy's really really a
[17:35] real christian it's not going to work
[17:36] out that way
[17:38] and and i could say this as i study his
[17:40] life abraham's example is really
[17:42] refreshing in that way
[17:44] that you don't just find that abraham
[17:46] was born perfectly and abraham never
[17:48] sinned and abraham did this and abraham
[17:50] did that and the faith of abraham is a
[17:52] man walking on water and raising the
[17:55] dead and and doing all sorts of mighty
[17:56] works and everything it's like man
[17:58] abraham did that jesus did that i don't
[18:00] have a chance but we look at abraham's
[18:02] life and realize that there's something
[18:04] that was working in his life and it's
[18:06] the same thing that's working in you
[18:08] so our faith has a beginning and that
[18:10] we'll have a completion it will have a
[18:12] finishing
[18:14] and as i've mentioned before sometimes
[18:16] when i look at a subject i just have to
[18:17] get started and what i'm doing tonight
[18:19] is maybe me reading a lot of different
[18:21] scriptures that
[18:22] that um i i see as being a part of this
[18:24] overall
[18:25] thought and we will probably revisit a
[18:28] lot of this again
[18:29] hopefully in a way that takes you a step
[18:30] further not just repetition
[18:32] but in james chapter 2 verses 14 to 24
[18:37] we look at a little bit different
[18:38] perspective as paul is saying that
[18:39] abraham
[18:41] was not justified by works and he kind
[18:43] of challenged this notion if he was
[18:45] justified by works
[18:47] then where where's the glory it's not
[18:49] from god
[18:50] and we are taught and we understand
[18:53] in this beautiful parallel of how
[18:55] paul teaches that abraham was justified
[18:57] by works that he was justified with god
[19:00] or before or was not justified by works
[19:03] he was justified before god by faith
[19:06] and that when james when james is
[19:08] looking at it he's not stepping in this
[19:10] position of posit of placing before god
[19:13] in your position in christ but rather
[19:15] your life in the practical outworking of
[19:18] that inward justification and what
[19:19] everybody else sees so when you say
[19:21] you're justified by faith but you're
[19:23] still a rank reprobate heathen denying
[19:25] god denying the lord and he's saying man
[19:28] you could tell me you have faith all day
[19:29] long without your works though what good
[19:31] is your faith on you and he's gonna and
[19:33] he's taken it from the standpoint that
[19:35] then faith then once justified before
[19:37] god and with that standing before god
[19:39] there's works that follow
[19:41] and brother branham deals with that
[19:43] quite often in such a way to really
[19:44] bring great clarity so we're looking at
[19:46] romans 4 in our text we'll come back to
[19:48] it in a moment but let's begin with
[19:50] james chapter 2 verse 14 here what does
[19:53] it profit my brethren though a man say
[19:55] he have faith and have not works can
[19:58] faith save him
[19:59] if a brother or sister be naked and
[20:01] destitute a daily food and one of you
[20:03] say unto them depart in peace be you
[20:04] warmed and filled
[20:06] i think that describes religion today
[20:10] he says notwithstanding you give them
[20:11] not these things which are needful to
[20:13] the body what doth that profit so
[20:15] somebody who has faith that doesn't do
[20:17] anything for them is no better than
[20:19] telling someone who's hungry oh be be
[20:21] filled or somebody who's cold will
[20:23] yourself warm right
[20:25] it says then in verse 17 even so faith
[20:29] if it hath not works is dead being alone
[20:33] and that's a very a striking statement
[20:35] to say that faith without works is dead
[20:38] being alone so if you just have
[20:40] faith but there's no
[20:42] there's no impact or work related to it
[20:46] it's almost like saying check its polls
[20:48] if it's not doing something for you
[20:50] check its polls he says yeah a man's men
[20:53] may say thou hast faith and i have works
[20:56] show me thy faith without thy works and
[20:58] i'll show thee my faith by my works
[21:00] thou believest that there is one god
[21:03] thou doest well the devils also believe
[21:05] and tremble in that sense maybe the
[21:07] devils are doing better
[21:09] it says but will found no old vain man
[21:12] that with faith without works is dead
[21:14] just emphasizing that coming back to
[21:16] what he said in verse 17 emphasizing
[21:18] this again that faith without works is
[21:20] dead now
[21:22] this is the part
[21:23] i want to really focus on in verses 21
[21:25] and 22 was not abraham our father
[21:28] justified by works and that he's been
[21:31] very precise and very specific within
[21:33] the timeline of abraham's faith when he
[21:35] had offered isaac his son upon the altar
[21:39] so we could say that we have faith right
[21:42] now
[21:43] right
[21:45] you're believing you have faith and we
[21:46] believe that we're going in a rapture
[21:48] now wouldn't you say that once you went
[21:51] in the rapture that
[21:52] that vindicated the faith you had that
[21:54] you were going in the rapture all along
[21:56] was kind of in the sense that james is
[21:57] saying it that there was an instance and
[21:59] a point in his life that it came to this
[22:01] part where he says when he offered up
[22:03] isaac his son upon the altar
[22:05] this justified vindicated proof that
[22:07] abraham had the goods that he claimed to
[22:09] have had all along
[22:11] and he phrases it this way see us thou
[22:13] how faith wrought with his works
[22:16] that faith is
[22:17] now is is bringing forth these works and
[22:20] by works was faith made perfect
[22:25] and i want to come back to that phrase
[22:26] in a moment by works was faith made
[22:28] perfect and thou
[22:30] and this the scripture was fulfilled
[22:32] which saith abraham believed god and it
[22:34] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[22:36] and he was called the friend of god you
[22:38] see then how that by works a man is
[22:41] justified and not by faith only
[22:44] so very very interesting uh contrast
[22:47] between romans 4 and james chapter 2.
[22:50] both writers referring to the same
[22:52] scriptures
[22:55] but there's a point in this
[22:57] in this viewing of abraham's life that
[22:59] james is looking at and another point
[23:02] that paul is looking and says was not
[23:03] abraham justified without the works of
[23:05] circumcision because what is was he not
[23:07] called and recognized by god before he
[23:09] was even circumcised in circumcision was
[23:12] given as a confirmation of the covenant
[23:14] that he already believed in so he's
[23:16] saying that that work and even this act
[23:18] of circumcision it's not because you've
[23:19] circumcised yourself and it's by your
[23:21] works that you find the grace of god and
[23:23] paul is looking in his life at a
[23:25] particular instance now james is looking
[23:28] later on
[23:29] and he's saying that we could say that
[23:30] he had genuine faith that yes was
[23:32] confirmed by this covenant in the in the
[23:34] flesh but now it comes to this place
[23:36] where he offers up isaac upon the altar
[23:39] and he says this is is this not when he
[23:41] was justified by works and he was
[23:43] justified not just by saying he had
[23:45] faith but by something made manifest in
[23:48] his life that spoke of his faith
[23:51] and he says by works was faith made
[23:53] perfect that means reached
[23:55] i it reached fully consummated
[23:58] development
[24:00] faith made perfect it was fully
[24:02] consummated fully developed it reached
[24:04] its uh highest point it actually means
[24:07] that it attained supreme expression
[24:11] that when abraham offered up isaac upon
[24:14] the altar his faith was made perfect or
[24:18] his faith by works was faith made
[24:20] reached its full and supreme expression
[24:24] this was the supreme faith of abraham
[24:27] and yes it was a remarkable thing that
[24:29] god had asked abraham to do to take his
[24:31] son his only son isaac and there's very
[24:34] striking language in the use of that
[24:36] phrase to take him this one through whom
[24:38] the all the world is going to be blessed
[24:40] and take him and to sacrifice him and so
[24:42] abraham is doing what god asked him to
[24:45] do and this is ultimately an act of
[24:48] faith upon which which manifest his
[24:50] faith in the most supreme way this is
[24:53] supreme faith for abraham
[24:55] but yet we could look at it in one sense
[24:57] that he had for abraham had just become
[24:59] a regular routine
[25:01] of following the scriptures and the
[25:03] plans of god
[25:04] to when it came time for god to ask him
[25:06] to do what would have been the the most
[25:08] dramatic difficult hard thing to do by
[25:11] then abraham was in the routine of
[25:14] hearing that voice and doing what it
[25:15] said
[25:17] and if we believe that one day even if
[25:18] we had some kind of conception in our
[25:20] minds that we're going to have to have
[25:21] shovels and go dig out our relatives
[25:22] from the graves or we believe that we're
[25:24] going to have to walk to graves and be
[25:26] the voice of the resurrection speaking
[25:27] people back to life or there's going to
[25:29] be a prayer line and we're going to be
[25:30] restoring limbs and we're going to be
[25:32] doing things like that if that's going
[25:33] to be what happens in the end you better
[25:35] be in the regular routine
[25:38] of the scriptures fulfilling the plans
[25:40] of god if you're ever going to walk into
[25:42] a meeting like that and the gift be used
[25:45] we can't just think that we're just
[25:46] going to be laying around doing nothing
[25:48] and not doing any anything to really
[25:50] grow our faith and then one day just
[25:52] wake up and be like oh i think i feel
[25:53] that honey i got rapture and faith
[25:55] i'm gonna go i'm gonna go to the
[25:56] graveyard today or i'm gonna start
[25:59] looking for my dead aunt or whatever it
[26:00] might be it's it's gonna be just living
[26:02] everyday life again i'm not wanting to
[26:04] get in your mind that every day we're
[26:06] practicing creating squirrels but just
[26:08] living every day abraham was living
[26:10] every day and was in that routine of
[26:12] scripture that when it came to something
[26:13] that was very dramatic very profound
[26:16] and very heavy he trusted god
[26:19] he'd done it so much it become a regular
[26:22] routine with him
[26:25] and so as abraham lived
[26:27] it says his by works was faith made
[26:30] perfect as he lived his faith received
[26:32] its realization
[26:35] as he lived it was entirely exemplified
[26:38] and manifested and filled up
[26:41] as abraham lived his faith was filled up
[26:44] as he lived his faith was exemplified as
[26:47] he lived it received its realization it
[26:49] it saw the promises made
[26:51] made to him come to pass
[26:54] in philippians chapter 2 verse 12 is
[26:57] we're wanting to take that phrase his by
[26:59] works was faith reached its full and
[27:02] supreme expression
[27:04] in philippians chapter 2 verse 12
[27:05] wherefore my beloved as ye have always
[27:07] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[27:09] now much more in my absence
[27:11] work out your own salvation with fear
[27:14] and trembling
[27:16] we could use this to suggest that
[27:17] someone who's just not certain about
[27:19] their experience with god they got to
[27:20] work it out and i i'm not saying that
[27:22] that application is not true there's
[27:24] this uh
[27:25] there's a thought and a meaning behind
[27:27] it to where we always want to be
[27:28] challenged that we've worked out our
[27:30] salvation and we know who we are and we
[27:31] know that we're saved and filled with
[27:32] the holy ghost and those things but when
[27:35] he says work out your own salvation with
[27:37] fear and trembling it means to carry it
[27:38] out to full perfection
[27:41] i mean just think about it tonight if we
[27:43] believe in our hearts that you have
[27:44] salvation you're holding salvation in
[27:46] your heart you've got it in your heart
[27:47] and you've got in your heart we all have
[27:48] salvation in our hearts he's saying work
[27:50] it out
[27:52] work it out i mean get it out
[27:54] let it live let it do something for you
[27:57] if we if we all have some salvation
[27:59] tonight it's like okay think about it
[28:01] you never have to worry about hellfire
[28:04] you never have to worry about damnation
[28:05] you never have to worry about rejection
[28:07] you never have to worry about white
[28:08] throne judgment you never have to worry
[28:09] about an endless fall you never have to
[28:10] worry about god saying depart from me
[28:12] your workers of iniquity you have
[28:13] salvation you have eternal life you say
[28:15] work it out
[28:18] live it a little bit enjoy it like work
[28:19] out your own salvation she says with
[28:21] fear and trembling so there's a humility
[28:23] that go with goes with it but if we've
[28:24] been justified once for all then faith
[28:27] is worked out until it's perfected
[28:31] work out your own salvation
[28:33] until perfection
[28:36] seems that we've had this
[28:37] this grace given to us and we've
[28:39] received this justification knowing that
[28:41] i'm justified once for all in the sight
[28:44] of god by faith then that salvation
[28:47] which is by grace which is through faith
[28:49] is worked out
[28:51] just as it was in abraham's life by
[28:53] works was faith made perfect
[28:55] paul teaching the philippians work out
[28:57] your own salvation
[28:59] in hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 to 10
[29:04] it says
[29:05] and i'm just checking it because i had
[29:07] several more scriptures here originally
[29:09] noted but i think i just have it to
[29:11] verse 10 hebrews chapter 8 verse 10
[29:14] excuse me hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 to
[29:16] 10 by faith abraham
[29:19] when he was called to go out into a
[29:21] place which he should after receive for
[29:23] an inheritance
[29:24] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[29:27] whether he went now
[29:29] i'm going to continue to read but let me
[29:31] just
[29:32] pause for a moment i'll maybe pick back
[29:34] up in verse 8.
[29:36] now
[29:37] as we've already began to just begin to
[29:39] pour out my heart and express these
[29:40] things as i'm viewing the life of
[29:42] abraham
[29:44] we're wanting to take a realistic look
[29:46] and just identify supreme faith revealed
[29:48] in abraham
[29:50] and this legend and this
[29:52] this father figure within the gospel and
[29:54] within other religions and just how much
[29:57] of a peculiar person he may be and
[29:58] mysterious he may be in this great faith
[30:00] that he had and father the father of the
[30:02] faith and the faith of abraham and all
[30:04] the things that we're taught that he
[30:05] experienced and things that he went
[30:07] through in the scripture
[30:08] just even being able to look at them and
[30:09] place them chronologically would is
[30:11] important and to know which juncture
[30:13] certain things happened and and what god
[30:15] was doing in his life i want you to
[30:17] notice this about abraham
[30:19] as it's kind of getting into genesis
[30:21] chapter 11 and chapter 12
[30:23] this is how it's written of in this by
[30:25] faith abraham which is going to look at
[30:26] him as a father of faith and one of
[30:29] these great heroes of faith by faith
[30:31] this one and by faith that one by faith
[30:33] abraham when he was called to go out
[30:35] into a place which he should after
[30:37] receive for inheritance obeyed now
[30:39] notice he's called and what does he do
[30:41] he obeys
[30:42] and it says and he went out not knowing
[30:44] whether he went now think about then
[30:46] think about abraham now
[30:49] and the faith of abraham and where we
[30:51] kind of place him in terms of oh abraham
[30:53] this legendary father figure the father
[30:56] of faith
[30:57] he walked because he had it all figured
[30:59] out
[31:00] and he was able to do this and when god
[31:03] spoke his name and in genesis chapter 12
[31:06] when it said god called abram
[31:07] immediately he said i'm not just abraham
[31:09] i'm abraham and he changed his body
[31:11] young again and he had a son in in nine
[31:14] months
[31:15] it says that he went out not knowing
[31:17] whether he went by faith he sojourned in
[31:20] the land of promise as in a strange
[31:22] country dwelling in tabernacles with
[31:24] isaac and jacob the heirs with him of
[31:27] the same promise
[31:28] for he looked for a city which hath
[31:30] foundations whose builder and maker is
[31:33] god
[31:34] do you realize the city he looked for is
[31:36] the city we're going to
[31:38] the city he looked for is the city that
[31:40] you reveal
[31:41] in your placing as the bride of jesus
[31:43] christ in the end time the new jerusalem
[31:44] the habitation of god for he looked for
[31:46] a city which have foundations whose
[31:48] builder and maker is god
[31:50] the bible is saying in these verses by
[31:52] faith abraham when he was called to go
[31:54] out into a place which he should after
[31:55] receive for inheritance obeyed he went
[31:57] out not northern where he went he had
[31:59] not fully even received his promise when
[32:02] he left
[32:04] he said get up and go to a land i'm
[32:06] going to show you hadn't even fully
[32:07] received the promise it wasn't even
[32:09] explicitly given till later
[32:11] so think about this when god called him
[32:13] and even when he obeyed he knew not what
[32:16] land he was going into
[32:18] he just knew god spoke to him
[32:20] now truly we could say that of ourselves
[32:24] that that there has been as i look out
[32:26] on the people here tonight that god has
[32:28] spoken to you and in speaking to you you
[32:30] didn't know everything then that you
[32:32] know now
[32:34] and and probably for all of us we say
[32:35] it's a good thing
[32:38] though we sometimes say man if i could
[32:40] just start all over if i could just do
[32:41] this all over again you know i i would
[32:43] mess it up again so i just want to stay
[32:45] where i'm at
[32:46] and just trust god that we're going to
[32:47] keep going further in his graves
[32:50] and so there's abraham when he's called
[32:52] and he begins
[32:54] he he god calls him and he has this
[32:56] faith and conviction that this is god
[32:59] i mean if he went to his his uncle and
[33:01] he goes to his dad and he goes to
[33:03] different ones
[33:05] and he says hey you know man i had this
[33:07] dream or had this vision and it told me
[33:09] to do this now
[33:10] oh hell no and there could have been
[33:12] some debate he said i just know this is
[33:14] god leading me
[33:16] and this is the this is what is
[33:17] happening with abraham
[33:19] is before when god calls him he obeyed
[33:23] i want you to catch it even before he
[33:25] knew exactly where he was going as it
[33:26] says in genesis chapter 12 verse 1 now
[33:28] the lord said unto abram get thee out of
[33:30] thy country and from thy kindred and
[33:32] from thy father's house unto a land that
[33:35] i will show thee
[33:37] he doesn't say get away from the father
[33:39] and you're going to go to this place and
[33:41] there's going to be the address and
[33:42] these are the directions you're going to
[33:43] take and he'd go oh you're taking me
[33:44] there let me get on google earth let me
[33:46] get a picture of it yep i know it's
[33:48] there let me search this out let me
[33:49] figure this out let me get some sources
[33:51] let me get look at some reviews run it
[33:53] to the fake review website make sure
[33:54] these aren't just all fake reviews and
[33:56] say hey this looks legitimate it's got
[33:58] an a plus score and everybody likes it
[33:59] i've looked at the pictures everything
[34:00] looks good we talked to people who've
[34:02] been there before let's go
[34:05] none of that
[34:06] he couldn't even google it
[34:09] because it wasn't google
[34:11] he couldn't he
[34:13] he couldn't even ask around hey do you
[34:14] guys know if there's well watered planes
[34:16] and where am i going again oh you didn't
[34:19] tell me he couldn't even ask
[34:21] and this is what some of the jewish
[34:23] commentators say this is the phrase god
[34:25] did not immediately make known the land
[34:27] to him
[34:29] so that it might be lovely in his eyes
[34:32] and god has a reason in it doesn't quite
[34:34] show it to him yet that it might that
[34:36] that he's hiding this he's not showing
[34:38] it and so he's not being drawn by the
[34:40] wrong thing
[34:42] hey get out of this uh pest house and
[34:44] get away from this and get away from all
[34:46] these situations and these clammy
[34:47] neighbors and all these different people
[34:49] because i want to show you something
[34:50] look at how beautiful this land is and
[34:52] it's like then it's not faith anymore
[34:54] it's like yeah i hope that's right i
[34:55] hope he's telling me the right bill of
[34:56] goods i mean i i really want to be there
[34:58] as another in the jewish tradition it
[35:00] says abraham came from mesopotamia and
[35:03] its companions and he knew not where he
[35:05] was as a man that is in the dark
[35:09] he was leaving
[35:10] and following
[35:12] and in abraham we see something to where
[35:14] it is the characteristic of faith to
[35:15] follow god when we can't cannot see the
[35:17] way
[35:18] this is a characteristic of faith to
[35:20] follow god even when we haven't seen it
[35:22] has not appeared to us exactly where we
[35:25] are going it says we walk by faith not
[35:28] by sight we are not walking to the
[35:30] appearance of that new body as it is
[35:32] struck the eye one day we will realize
[35:35] the realization everything around us
[35:37] will be eternal but by right now it's by
[35:39] faith that we are walking into a promise
[35:42] of god even if it's not an appearance
[35:45] that we have seen with our natural eyes
[35:48] and so this is this i wanted to share
[35:50] that to express this to you how that
[35:52] even in abraham he was asked to go in
[35:54] the beginning of his faith he went
[35:56] he began upon the unction of god and
[35:59] gone speaking to him and he says i want
[36:01] you to begin in this process and leave
[36:03] and then i'll show you where you're
[36:04] going later and so he just left
[36:07] trusting god
[36:09] and in that there's no doubt in that
[36:12] that speaks to how he is the father of
[36:14] our faith
[36:16] in verse 12 of romans chapter 4 as we
[36:18] read in the beginning as part of our
[36:20] text it says in the father of
[36:21] circumcision to them
[36:23] who are not of the circumcision only
[36:25] speaking of abraham he is the father of
[36:26] circumcision to them who are not of the
[36:28] circumcision only but who also walk in
[36:31] the steps of that faith of our father
[36:34] abraham which he
[36:36] had being yet uncircumcised
[36:40] he had
[36:42] steps of faith
[36:44] before he was even circumcised
[36:47] and it says that we also walk in the
[36:50] steps of that faith of our father
[36:52] abraham
[36:53] that having not even been circumcised
[36:55] and receiving that covenant of
[36:57] circumcision when he god called him to
[36:59] go out and without even telling him
[37:00] where he was going abraham just believed
[37:02] god took him at his word and began to
[37:04] walk and he says that there are a people
[37:06] who call for abraham their father and
[37:08] who are of the faith who walk in the
[37:11] steps of this in this face that faith
[37:15] so that faith has steps it has progress
[37:18] when we look at those those steps of
[37:19] faith they're not just going in circles
[37:21] and round and round and round and round
[37:23] and go in circles there's steps to that
[37:25] faith and it has a trajectory and it has
[37:27] a height and it has a depth and it has a
[37:29] a has a progress to it what those who
[37:33] walk in the steps of that faith of our
[37:36] father abraham
[37:37] it's two things i i think we could just
[37:39] grab a hold of and and and really anchor
[37:42] within our hearts and i love that paul
[37:44] wright wrote it this way and he's
[37:45] writing it to uh
[37:47] many degrees in these dozen or so
[37:49] scriptures we read at the outset
[37:51] in romans chapter four but the one thing
[37:53] i really want you to catch
[37:55] is we have the same faith he had
[37:59] oh he's saying we have the same faith
[38:00] who also walk in the steps of that faith
[38:03] of our father abraham when the bible
[38:05] talks about the faith of abraham and
[38:07] he's called our father and referred to
[38:08] him as a patriarch and we begin to look
[38:10] at this legendary faith that abraham had
[38:13] we should not in any way begin to think
[38:15] that the faith that abraham had is
[38:16] different than the faith that we have in
[38:19] that his was superior and it was greater
[38:21] and we can never have it paul is saying
[38:23] you have the same faith that he had
[38:27] that's the first thing we could just
[38:28] recognize and accept that we have that
[38:30] faith of our father abraham and the
[38:32] second thing is we follow in the
[38:34] exercise of that faith
[38:37] that abraham it's not somebody we read
[38:39] about says abraham believed god and he
[38:40] bragged about it and he lived all his
[38:42] days in the land of the chaldeans
[38:44] can't
[38:45] it's not said of abraham
[38:47] that's not said his name does not remain
[38:50] to be abram but his name is changed and
[38:52] he has a testimony of faith and he's
[38:54] walking and he's progressing and so he's
[38:57] saying that we who walk in the steps of
[38:59] that faith of our father abraham we are
[39:02] then also part of that faith and part of
[39:04] that testimony and part of that life
[39:07] because abraham is called the parent
[39:09] believer he's the patriarch he's the
[39:11] father of our faith he's the parent
[39:12] believer he's the model of justification
[39:15] by faith
[39:17] he's the example he's the model after
[39:19] his type is the first example of it we
[39:22] are molded after it
[39:24] so if he's the father of our faith it's
[39:25] not he's the the role model of our faith
[39:28] or like the idol of our faith like we
[39:30] all daydream we all wish that we were uh
[39:32] patrick mahomes and we all wish that we
[39:34] were a joey gallow we all wish that
[39:37] we're somebody else and we just kind of
[39:38] oh they're my idol they're my idol and
[39:41] you ain't ever going to be that
[39:43] right
[39:44] yeah you don't you don't have the hair
[39:46] for it at the very least you're never
[39:47] going to be these guys and so it's not
[39:49] like this idol where it's just
[39:50] daydreaming and oh i just wish i could
[39:52] be abraham's not an idol of our faith
[39:55] he's a model of how the faith that you
[39:58] have is exercised and what it will do in
[40:01] a person when you yield and give into it
[40:04] and you trust god and you take him at
[40:05] his word he's the model of justification
[40:07] by faith and he is our type as the one
[40:10] who gave the first example of it of how
[40:12] that we also are molded in this faith
[40:15] that is in us grows to supreme
[40:17] expression
[40:20] in isaiah chapter 51 verses 1 to 2.
[40:24] we had read this recently in our family
[40:25] devotion and it was part of just this
[40:27] confirmation
[40:28] and struck my heart
[40:30] very profoundly this confirmation of to
[40:33] look at abraham as an example it says
[40:34] hearken to me ye that follow after
[40:36] righteousness ye that seek the lord it
[40:38] says look under the rock once you were
[40:40] hewn look at the quarry and the pit you
[40:42] were dug out in the hole of the pit when
[40:44] you were digged the rock you've been
[40:46] hewn out of look at what you've come
[40:47] from look at the
[40:48] if you even want to say the pedigree or
[40:50] the source material look what you've
[40:52] been taken from because it says look
[40:54] under abraham your father
[40:57] because it says look under the rock and
[40:59] and what you've been pulled out of
[41:00] abraham was the rock
[41:02] look where you've come from look at your
[41:04] stock look at your pedigree look at your
[41:06] legacy look what you've come from look
[41:08] what you're following in look under the
[41:09] rock once you are hewn look under
[41:11] abraham your father and unto sarah that
[41:14] bear you for i called him alone and
[41:16] blessed him and increased
[41:18] now we could look at in the context of
[41:20] isaiah and his alternating prophecies of
[41:22] blessing and then curse
[41:24] and how he's dealing with him in this in
[41:26] this this prophecy at this time to see
[41:29] that what you come from and though you
[41:30] may be small and though you may be cast
[41:32] down and though you may be rejected and
[41:33] you may be torn and you may
[41:35] and you may feel that you are nothing
[41:37] look unto abraham who god called alone
[41:39] and blessed him and increased him when
[41:40] he was just one man
[41:43] and look at you now maybe you're more
[41:44] than one and you're many even though
[41:45] you've been into uh you've been in
[41:47] bondage and you've been brought into uh
[41:49] slavery and you've suffered the loss of
[41:52] many things if god could call one man
[41:54] and bless him and increase him look at
[41:55] you as a nation i can also bless you but
[41:58] what god is telling him to do is use
[42:00] abraham as your example
[42:03] look to abraham the rock that you've
[42:05] come from as your example who we walk in
[42:07] the steps of that faith of our father
[42:10] abraham we can look to him as being the
[42:12] father of our faith the parent believer
[42:14] the one that we can become even a dear
[42:16] follower of beholding his example look
[42:19] under abraham your father unto sarah
[42:20] that bear you and we can see that he is
[42:22] an example
[42:24] but the faith that i have is the same
[42:25] faith that abraham had
[42:30] the message possessing the gate of the
[42:31] enemy after trial
[42:33] but the man says and the patriarch was
[42:35] faithful to his call and the promised
[42:37] word
[42:38] he was an example to what we should be
[42:42] notice this he was an example to what we
[42:45] should be he was an example of what we
[42:46] ought to be
[42:48] as a patriarch he was faithful to his
[42:50] call into the promised word and he's an
[42:52] example that we ought to be faithful to
[42:54] our call into our promised word
[42:56] we have to be faithful to that that if
[42:58] we're to look at his example and say oh
[43:00] well i want to leave my family and i
[43:02] want to go live in canaan and i want to
[43:04] i want to i'm going to have a a child
[43:07] from my serve my wife's
[43:09] uh servant and just to try to do
[43:11] everything abraham did no it's not
[43:13] trying to mimic abraham or impersonate
[43:15] abraham or or become change your name to
[43:17] abraham and i've changed my name my name
[43:19] is abraham aguirre
[43:21] and and and try to just become abe
[43:24] right but the the example is be faithful
[43:28] to your call and the promised word for
[43:30] your day
[43:31] he's an example to what we should be
[43:35] continuing in romans chapter 4 verses 13
[43:37] to 18
[43:38] for the promise that he should be the
[43:40] heir of the world was not to abraham or
[43:42] to a seed through the law it was a
[43:43] promise to abraham and to a seed but not
[43:45] through the law but through the
[43:46] righteousness of faith
[43:48] for if they which are of the law be
[43:50] heirs faith is made void in the promise
[43:52] made of none effect because the law
[43:54] worketh wrath for where no law is there
[43:56] is no transgression therefore it is of
[43:59] faith that it might be by grace to the
[44:02] end the promise might be sure
[44:04] to all the seed not to that only which
[44:06] is of the law
[44:08] but to that also which is of the faith
[44:11] of abraham to those
[44:14] you
[44:15] the jews are those that are of the law
[44:18] you could even say that there are some
[44:19] there were some gentiles who had made
[44:21] themselves subject as being prophetized
[44:23] to the jewish faith
[44:25] who observed the law but now he's saying
[44:27] but to that also which is of the faith
[44:29] of abraham not in the honoring of the
[44:31] law or the circumcision but who are of
[44:33] the faith of abraham who is the father
[44:36] of us all
[44:38] as it is written i've made thee a father
[44:40] of many nations before him whom you
[44:42] believed even god who quickeneth the
[44:45] dead and notice abraham's this great
[44:47] remark about abraham's faith who calleth
[44:50] those things which be not as though they
[44:52] were
[44:54] why not because he wanted them but
[44:56] because god told them
[44:58] he didn't have a habit of naming it and
[45:00] claiming it
[45:02] he said god didn't promise me a mansion
[45:04] but i'm going to go ahead and claim one
[45:05] i want 7 000 square feet on eight acres
[45:08] name it claim it fake it till you make
[45:10] it
[45:11] all the prosperity nonsense that gets
[45:13] preached today but he had a promise from
[45:15] god
[45:16] and he could call those things that were
[45:18] not as though they were because he's
[45:19] faith went back to what god said
[45:22] who against hope believed in hope
[45:25] against hope believed in hope that he
[45:27] might become notice that who against
[45:29] hope believed in hope we can read about
[45:31] abraham and other places who staggered
[45:33] not in hebrews 11 who by faith abraham
[45:36] and we see this one who could get up and
[45:38] go and not knowing where he went and he
[45:39] was such a bulldog and everything worked
[45:42] out for him and he grabbed his farmers
[45:44] and his you know his yard lawn keepers
[45:46] at the around his property and went and
[45:48] chased after armies and was recognized
[45:50] by kings and we just have this
[45:52] image of abraham but you know what he
[45:54] had things against him who against hope
[45:57] believed in hope
[45:58] that he might become the father of many
[46:00] nations according to that which was
[46:02] spoken
[46:03] so shall thy seed be
[46:06] he believed in the spoken word
[46:08] he believed in the word that was
[46:09] directed to him given to him
[46:12] and even when it even when it wasn't
[46:14] given to everyone else
[46:16] i i'll express this in maybe a more
[46:19] personal way
[46:20] that as i've been thinking about it i
[46:22] think abraham abraham abraham
[46:24] none of us are the first then
[46:27] because abraham's already done it
[46:30] christ is also referred to as the
[46:31] captain the leader the forerunner of our
[46:33] salvation
[46:34] and so none of us are going on this we
[46:37] this is exactly what's meant in hebrews
[46:39] chapter 11 and as we mentioned it i
[46:41] think yeah i mentioned in hebrews
[46:42] chapter 12 seeing that we have this
[46:44] cloud of witnesses
[46:46] like we have witness we have testimony
[46:49] we uh
[46:50] our our testimonies today are not well i
[46:52] was laying in bed and all of a sudden a
[46:53] voice spoke to me said go to the hilton
[46:55] garden in at seven o'clock tonight i'm
[46:56] gonna speak to you there and that's kind
[46:57] of like the genesis of our faith i
[46:59] didn't even know there was a god i just
[47:00] thought maybe i had too much to eat i
[47:02] thought it was my phone but my phone was
[47:03] dead and i thought what do i have to
[47:05] lose i called an uber here i am
[47:08] worst case scenario i get to go to salad
[47:10] go salad or whatever salad to go and get
[47:12] a cheap coffee on national coffee day
[47:15] and you showed up and we all kind of
[47:16] have the same origin story i was just
[47:18] sitting there i had this premonition
[47:21] abraham did that for us
[47:23] right
[47:24] like abraham said hey some dude spoke to
[47:26] me told me to go somewhere where are you
[47:28] going i don't know he's going to tell me
[47:29] later like listen this is a scam trust
[47:31] me
[47:32] right
[47:34] do they tell you that your tax you have
[47:35] a tax debt and you immediately begin to
[47:37] tell them you know
[47:38] all the red flags about a scam but
[47:40] that's but abraham does it and now he
[47:42] affords us an example that when nobody
[47:44] else was serving the one true god and
[47:46] all his relatives were reprobates and
[47:47] heathens and he was a gentile which just
[47:50] means nations and people he wasn't a jew
[47:52] and before there was ever any
[47:53] circumcision before there was ever any
[47:55] vindication he believes god and begins
[47:57] to walk
[47:59] and everything that god said he would do
[48:00] for abraham he's done and we can look
[48:02] back and say he did for abraham
[48:04] everything that he said he would do and
[48:06] now you in a very supernatural way god
[48:09] speaks your name and when everyone says
[48:11] abraham i didn't hear it abraham i
[48:13] wouldn't follow him do you have any idea
[48:14] what you're doing and we'll look at it
[48:15] maybe more closely and you can see the
[48:17] pattern in his life you can be
[48:18] incursional i'm walking in the steps of
[48:21] my father abraham
[48:24] i'm walking in this
[48:27] according to what was spoken
[48:30] in the unconditional covenant that was
[48:31] made with the people preached in 1954
[48:34] brother bram says abraham was the
[48:35] example
[48:37] what all he was going to do to abraham
[48:40] he was going to do to him
[48:42] and his seed
[48:45] abraham brought isaac through isaac come
[48:46] christ
[48:47] we being dead in christ take on
[48:49] abraham's seed and are heirs according
[48:51] to the promise
[48:53] so when he says what he was going to do
[48:54] to abraham he was going to do to abraham
[48:56] and his seed it's not just jacob
[49:00] it's not just the children of israel
[49:01] it's not just isaac jacob the children
[49:03] of israel but we also being dead in
[49:05] christ become the royal seed abraham
[49:07] seed heirs according to the promise that
[49:09] was made to abraham therefore abraham is
[49:12] the example what he was going to do to
[49:14] abraham he does
[49:16] to his seed
[49:18] because you have the faith of abraham
[49:21] and having the faith of abraham we must
[49:23] follow in the exercise of that faith
[49:28] in the message jehovah jireh part two
[49:29] and god wants his church to read between
[49:31] the lines he's referring to maybe a love
[49:33] letter that is written and oh honey i'm
[49:35] thinking about you it's the end of the
[49:36] night and here i am away he says that
[49:38] god wants you to his church to read
[49:41] between the lines i love this not read
[49:43] anything out of it now
[49:46] right
[49:47] you want to read between the lines but
[49:48] don't write something in the white space
[49:50] which a lot of people do they feel like
[49:52] reading between the lines is licensed
[49:54] just to come up with whatever you want
[49:56] well i was just reading between the
[49:57] lines
[49:58] now i mean it means picking up what was
[50:00] being laid down it's like i feel you i
[50:02] know what you're saying i get what
[50:03] you're trying to say wink wink yeah i
[50:04] get it he's saying that he god wants us
[50:06] to catch what he's trying to share with
[50:08] us you have to read between the lines to
[50:11] see what it's meaning
[50:12] now watch and see find out if it doesn't
[50:14] now what god done with abraham and sarah
[50:18] he's showing them an example of his
[50:20] church
[50:22] we see them as it says look at this rock
[50:25] that you hear now now look unto abraham
[50:26] your father and unto sarah that bear you
[50:28] what god did with abraham and sarah he's
[50:30] showing them as an example of his church
[50:33] abraham and sarah are going to exemplify
[50:35] something their faith their life their
[50:38] path their instances their circumstances
[50:40] their ups and downs their wrestlings
[50:42] their fightings their wars are going to
[50:44] express something as an example of what
[50:46] the church is
[50:47] what she goes through whether you want
[50:48] to look at it on the level of a church
[50:50] age or even you as an individual who's
[50:52] an individual seed he said he did for
[50:54] them notice he says he turned them both
[50:56] back to being a young man and a woman
[50:58] sure he did put them back young again
[51:00] just like he's going to do every seat of
[51:01] abraham
[51:05] he was an example to what we should be
[51:09] he was an example in that what he god
[51:11] did to abraham he does to his seed
[51:13] abraham and sarah were an example of his
[51:15] church the church of christ saying that
[51:17] even in the very end if you look at this
[51:19] example of how that they were made young
[51:21] again he's saying is that not what's
[51:23] going to happen to all those who are
[51:24] dead in christ
[51:27] and all those who are hid in christ
[51:31] abraham's seed according to the promise
[51:34] in genesis chapter 17.
[51:38] so we were reading about i is he even
[51:41] thinking about tonight he said if you do
[51:43] if you do anything without faith
[51:45] walk through a prayer line walk to an
[51:46] altar no matter what you do if you don't
[51:48] have faith you're just going on a walk
[51:51] i know the bible says that abraham
[51:53] walked with god
[51:55] enoch walked with god
[51:58] but it wasn't just a walk
[52:00] it wasn't just burning calories
[52:02] he wasn't trying to see if he could get
[52:03] his steps for the day
[52:05] but it was working something out in his
[52:07] life
[52:08] the translation
[52:10] as we've been looking at how that we
[52:12] must work out
[52:13] our own salvation it hasn't works was
[52:15] made reached its full and supreme
[52:17] expression
[52:18] there's this faith that he has
[52:21] and then it's made perfect
[52:24] genesis chapter 17 this is we first have
[52:27] abraham mentioned abram mentioned in
[52:28] genesis chapter 11
[52:30] he's given the genealogy and some of the
[52:32] background and characteristics of sarah
[52:34] and abram
[52:35] and their family and their journey
[52:37] genesis chapter 12
[52:39] the lord called abram as we read a
[52:41] moment ago he called them
[52:43] he says in the lord had said unto abram
[52:46] get thee out of that country and from
[52:47] thy kindred and from that father's house
[52:49] unto a land that i'll show thee
[52:51] so now we're
[52:52] several chap five chapters later
[52:55] we're looking at
[52:57] there's a lot that's happened
[53:00] it says abraham was 90
[53:02] years old and nine 99 years old
[53:06] the lord appeared to abram and said unto
[53:08] him
[53:09] i am the almighty god walk before me
[53:12] and be thou perfect
[53:15] this isn't genesis chapter 12
[53:18] it's not even genesis 15.
[53:19] this is much later in his life
[53:22] 13 years after ishmael was born 24 years
[53:25] after the lord had called him and given
[53:28] him a promise
[53:29] that his seed would become
[53:32] that in him through him the earth would
[53:35] be blessed and have a seat after him
[53:37] 13 years after the birth of ishmael 24
[53:39] years after being called by god and it's
[53:41] in this chapter says i am the almighty
[53:43] god walk before thee and be thou perfect
[53:46] this is a walk that expresses something
[53:49] walk before me and be thou made perfect
[53:52] and express this faith and let it become
[53:54] expre a supreme expression he's wanting
[53:57] abram to be an example
[54:00] and i'm getting pulled into just all the
[54:02] things i've been reading and studying
[54:03] and the things in the word of god
[54:05] there's if we look at abraham there was
[54:07] nothing that distinguished him and we're
[54:09] all sitting we're reading resumes right
[54:11] we want to pick the hero the fight we we
[54:13] have to pick the patriarch of the faith
[54:15] we are it's called the faith not the
[54:16] voice we're all the judges we need to
[54:19] pick who's going to be the one that's
[54:20] going to be the father of our faith and
[54:21] we're looking at resumes and listen
[54:23] abram's resume didn't make him stick out
[54:27] yeah
[54:28] next next
[54:30] i i there's nothing about abram that
[54:33] really would have stuck out and it's not
[54:34] like he had this pedigree of
[54:35] supernatural things and he was the big
[54:37] wise one and everybody asked him this
[54:38] and he had a lot big family now he
[54:40] couldn't have kids
[54:43] so he's just an ordinary man
[54:46] and god calls him and speaks to him
[54:49] and he's gonna he's gonna express this
[54:51] this in his life it's going to unfold
[54:53] and unfold and unfold and it's in this
[54:55] chapter genesis chapter 17 he's given
[54:57] the covenant of circumcision
[55:00] five chapters later 24 something years
[55:03] later he's given the covenant of
[55:04] circumcision it's in this chapter that
[55:06] his name is changed from abram to
[55:07] abraham it is in this chapter that
[55:09] sarah's name is changed from sarah to
[55:12] sarah with an h and it's in this chapter
[55:14] that god finally says listen it's not
[55:17] ishmael that's going to live before me i
[55:19] know he's a 13 year old child and you've
[55:21] had this son and you want him to be you
[55:23] but when i said you'd have a son in your
[55:24] own house it's then that he says the
[55:26] promise is through sarah and she's going
[55:29] to have a son and he gives the name
[55:32] it's in this chapter that it happens
[55:34] it's in genesis chapter 17. it's not in
[55:37] genesis chapter 12 that abram went to
[55:39] sleep one night and in that dream god
[55:41] told him his name was abraham his wife
[55:43] was not sarah it was sarah they were
[55:45] going to have a son named isaac it was
[55:46] going to be through sarah and it was
[55:48] going to do this and he was going to do
[55:49] that and when he woke up he had all like
[55:51] these pictures right from the future
[55:54] like a time traveler just left him a
[55:55] photojournalist yep this matches yep
[55:58] this message if everything's just
[56:00] happening exactly like the almanac said
[56:01] it would
[56:02] that's not how it happened with abraham
[56:06] and so genesis chapter 17 is a very
[56:09] pack packed chapter but then in verse 18
[56:12] it says and the lord appeared unto him
[56:13] chapter 18 rather verse 1 and the lord
[56:15] appeared to him lord just keeps
[56:17] appearing to him
[56:19] why because that's the steps
[56:21] of abraham's faith
[56:24] the lord appeared unto him in the plains
[56:25] of memory and he sat in the tent door in
[56:27] the heat of the day
[56:30] and in this chapter he reveals himself
[56:31] to abraham before judging sodom
[56:34] and he confirms his promise that sarah
[56:36] will have a son i'll revisit you
[56:38] according to the time of life and next
[56:40] year she's going to have a son just like
[56:42] i said he would she would
[56:44] this son isaac
[56:47] and genesis chapter 18 and then the
[56:49] preceding chapters which expressed the
[56:51] judgments of sodom and the days of lot
[56:55] and then even the conception and the
[56:56] bringing forth of this son this promised
[56:58] son isaac hold such significant things
[57:01] to our faith
[57:03] because you realize this seeds isaac
[57:05] even then is just portraying
[57:09] apart because he wasn't even the seed
[57:12] the seed of abraham will we we know but
[57:14] we'll even examine it lord willing in
[57:16] greater detail
[57:17] is or maybe not greater detail we'll
[57:19] just examine it that the seed was christ
[57:22] when even isaac
[57:23] the seed was christ and these chapters
[57:26] are so significant when you begin to
[57:28] look at i hope you do this on sunday
[57:30] just quickly look at the chapters of the
[57:32] bible that this is such a tremendous
[57:35] portion of scripture such a tremendous
[57:37] passages that are here and we want to be
[57:39] able to look at them in such a way that
[57:41] we can identify with them and relate
[57:43] with them and feel that we are a part of
[57:45] it because it expresses something to us
[57:49] and the lord appeared to him and made
[57:50] himself known to abraham before he
[57:52] judged sodom but not just because there
[57:54] was judgment coming to sodom but because
[57:56] he wanted to reveal himself to abram and
[57:58] bring all these promises he believed in
[58:00] to pass and bring him to this expression
[58:02] and this birth in his life so he could
[58:04] handle it
[58:06] but it's this chapter chapter 18
[58:08] where he appears in human flesh
[58:12] to abraham
[58:15] brother branham refers to it in the
[58:17] message influence and he says he was
[58:18] showing an example
[58:20] of what he was going to do in the last
[58:22] days
[58:25] so we who also walk in the steps of that
[58:27] faith of our father abraham
[58:29] and we look unto abraham our father he
[58:31] was an example of what we should be
[58:34] and we are who are of the faith of
[58:36] abraham he is the father of us all
[58:38] he's an example of not only what he in
[58:41] what he was an example of what god did
[58:42] to him
[58:43] he does to his seed
[58:46] and he's showing us the example of his
[58:48] bride
[58:50] an example of what he was going to do in
[58:52] the last days
[58:54] it's it's there in the life of abraham
[58:58] what he's doing in the last days
[59:01] and the message god is identified by his
[59:03] characteristics and one day when god
[59:05] seen that a servant was determined to be
[59:08] an example for people of today
[59:12] we begin to identify in genesis chapter
[59:13] 18 leading up to even these portions of
[59:16] scripture where he's going to come
[59:18] and even in this and when he says and
[59:20] one day when god seen that a servant was
[59:22] determined to be an example for people
[59:24] of today he's referring to genesis 22
[59:26] when he offers up his son isaac he's
[59:28] referring to james chapter 2 wherein his
[59:30] faith reached its fullest supreme
[59:32] expression when if abraham's faith
[59:34] became supreme faith he says he was
[59:37] determined he was set forth to be an
[59:39] example of the people today
[59:43] his life and even an offering up isaac
[59:46] becomes an example of the faith of god's
[59:49] elect in this end time
[59:51] why because supreme faith is the faith
[59:53] of this hour
[59:56] and this is why we can look at abraham
[59:58] and begin to identify with him in a much
[1:00:00] more
[1:00:01] personal way
[1:00:02] abraham is our father
[1:00:05] he is our example
[1:00:08] i encourage you to get into the word of
[1:00:09] god and begin to read in genesis 11
[1:00:12] chapter 12 all the way to even through
[1:00:14] you could read all the way to chapter 50
[1:00:16] you could just read of the story of
[1:00:17] abraham and his family
[1:00:19] because that's what genesis the genesis
[1:00:21] story we think genesis oh creation
[1:00:23] genesis in the beginning well
[1:00:26] it's abraham
[1:00:28] that's where you begin to look into this
[1:00:31] and identify your faith and the father
[1:00:34] of the faith
[1:00:35] and musicians if you could come
[1:00:38] i i'm i'm thinking of this right now as
[1:00:40] i close
[1:00:42] we have a phenomena
[1:00:44] in the world today
[1:00:47] that people
[1:00:48] live their lives in a particular family
[1:00:50] setting and they love their their
[1:00:51] parents and they love them dearly and
[1:00:53] they're nurtured by them and they have
[1:00:54] very full lives
[1:00:56] but they come to a place in their lives
[1:00:58] where they find out
[1:00:59] that they were adopted
[1:01:02] and to find out that they're adopted it
[1:01:04] can it can create i haven't experienced
[1:01:06] this myself maybe not yet i don't know
[1:01:11] am i prophesying
[1:01:13] uh there's something about me that
[1:01:14] sticks out where i doubt that that's the
[1:01:16] case but anyways
[1:01:17] um
[1:01:18] but there's
[1:01:20] when they come to that spot
[1:01:22] it may maybe they're okay with it they
[1:01:24] say well you know what i was adopted i
[1:01:25] had loving parents i've been nurtured
[1:01:26] i'm fine with my life but then they
[1:01:28] begin to have
[1:01:30] medical issues
[1:01:33] and it becomes very important at that
[1:01:34] point to understand their genetic
[1:01:37] history their dna and they realize you
[1:01:39] know what if i was just merely adopted
[1:01:43] by these parents i can't look to him and
[1:01:44] say well dad did you have colon cancer
[1:01:46] at 56 uh
[1:01:47] no but that doesn't mean anything to
[1:01:50] if you've been adopted
[1:01:52] mom did you ever have this in your
[1:01:53] family history no uh-uh but it wouldn't
[1:01:56] really matter you couldn't really answer
[1:01:57] the question to a degree
[1:01:59] of of necessitating some kind of
[1:02:01] follow-up or or understanding what may
[1:02:03] be taking place in a person's body
[1:02:05] because they're adopted they don't share
[1:02:06] the dna
[1:02:08] they don't have the history
[1:02:10] and and it becomes important to go back
[1:02:13] and look at the at the family history
[1:02:17] to resolve and answer some question and
[1:02:19] sometimes it becomes such a huge issue
[1:02:21] in a person's heart i was adopted and i
[1:02:23] don't i i feel this longing and this
[1:02:25] missing part and i always wondered about
[1:02:27] it and these things are never resolved
[1:02:29] so they can go back and find out who is
[1:02:30] my real dad who is my real mom
[1:02:32] where did i really come from and it
[1:02:34] means no disrespect at all to those who
[1:02:36] raised him and nurtured them but it's
[1:02:38] just something that they really need in
[1:02:39] their hearts and if i could just say
[1:02:41] this we could have the wrong concept of
[1:02:43] adoption preach to us as believers do we
[1:02:46] kind of just feel like we're all orphans
[1:02:47] in god's orphanage
[1:02:49] man we're just so glad he's taking care
[1:02:51] of us and we all just kind of we just
[1:02:52] kind of given abraham's name because
[1:02:54] we've been adopted into the family but
[1:02:57] listen what you do when you begin to
[1:02:58] look at abraham you begin to identify
[1:03:00] your dna you begin to look at your
[1:03:02] family history and you could recognize
[1:03:04] the way that i have behaved with my
[1:03:06] faith and the thing the way that i have
[1:03:08] had been against hope and suffered these
[1:03:10] things and had these things happen and
[1:03:12] why i am the way that i am as a believer
[1:03:15] i can go back and trace it through this
[1:03:17] lineage and this history and go back to
[1:03:20] the dna the rock that i've been hearing
[1:03:22] out of and i can see it in my father
[1:03:23] abraham
[1:03:26] i begin to realize well that's why i am
[1:03:28] the way that i am
[1:03:31] and i believe that we have the we should
[1:03:32] do this
[1:03:33] and if god would lead me to do it if
[1:03:35] it's just two services i've called this
[1:03:36] part one tonight
[1:03:39] i think even if it's just
[1:03:40] only one part and you just took time now
[1:03:43] on your own
[1:03:44] and said i want to read about our father
[1:03:46] abraham
[1:03:47] i want to learn from his life i want to
[1:03:49] look at it in such a way to where i'm
[1:03:51] not just cherry-picking these stories
[1:03:53] of god veiled in flesh turning his back
[1:03:56] to the tent and
[1:03:57] and you just think that this is these
[1:03:59] remarkable instances of him running off
[1:04:01] and after his nephew and rescuing him
[1:04:03] and we don't just
[1:04:05] understand it following it in its
[1:04:07] progression
[1:04:09] i think you'll find that his story is
[1:04:10] your story let's stand to our feet
[1:04:13] tonight
[1:04:15] supreme faith
[1:04:18] revealed
[1:04:20] in abraham
[1:04:21] our heavenly father tonight
[1:04:26] i have experienced a great joy in
[1:04:28] ministering the word of god
[1:04:32] i'm especially grateful for lord as i've
[1:04:34] wrestled and
[1:04:37] fought and felt so
[1:04:39] overwhelmed with how to begin
[1:04:42] i'm thankful lord that there was
[1:04:44] believers praying that there's hearts
[1:04:45] that need to be spoken to and it's that
[1:04:47] need that's met
[1:04:49] when things become clear
[1:04:52] and lord tonight i feel such an
[1:04:54] inspiration to look at this life of
[1:04:56] abraham
[1:04:59] and being guided by the message of the
[1:05:01] hour that identifies him as an example
[1:05:03] to us
[1:05:05] it places him before us as an example
[1:05:08] of what you're going to do with the
[1:05:09] church
[1:05:10] in the last days
[1:05:13] i feel that there's a great mystery that
[1:05:14] his life unfolds
[1:05:18] and we don't want to miss it
[1:05:20] as a church we took time to look at the
[1:05:22] book of ruth and in doing it we found
[1:05:24] that there's so much in that
[1:05:26] there's a revelation that brings us
[1:05:27] close to god
[1:05:31] lord i pray that as we spend any more
[1:05:33] length of time together in this in our
[1:05:35] church services that you would harness
[1:05:37] it take control of it and use it
[1:05:40] to bring your seed to births
[1:05:43] and to mature birth seeds and to a
[1:05:45] greater level of faith and trust than
[1:05:48] we've ever had before
[1:05:51] and i commit the people to you tonight
[1:05:53] desiring that it be you that works
[1:05:57] maybe you that gets the glory
[1:05:59] for by looking at abraham there's not a
[1:06:02] works program that we can outline
[1:06:03] there's not a to-do list that we could
[1:06:05] set before any of the people but in
[1:06:07] looking at abraham we have to come to a
[1:06:09] place where say abraham believed god and
[1:06:12] that's what we must do
[1:06:15] and may we get in the habit of working
[1:06:16] out our salvation on a daily basis to
[1:06:18] where we trust you and you fulfill your
[1:06:21] word and keep your promise so much that
[1:06:23] it just becomes a regular routine
[1:06:25] of following the scriptures and the
[1:06:26] plans of god so that the supernatural
[1:06:29] supreme faith can begin to manifest
[1:06:31] itself in our midst
[1:06:34] lord we believe in the movement of the
[1:06:35] spirit we believe in the gifts of the
[1:06:37] sphere we believe in divine healing we
[1:06:40] believe lord that you can do tremendous
[1:06:42] magnificent things in our lives but what
[1:06:45] we want what we want is the daily faith
[1:06:48] of god's elect
[1:06:50] and may it be in that daily living
[1:06:53] that we gather together in instances
[1:06:55] like this on wednesday nights and sunday
[1:06:57] mornings and special services where the
[1:06:59] power of god can move and fall upon an
[1:07:01] individual and they can find that back
[1:07:03] pain is eradicated that limbs are
[1:07:05] restored cancers are healed salvation is
[1:07:08] wrought not because we worked ourselves
[1:07:11] into some sort of phenomena but we're
[1:07:12] just in the routine
[1:07:14] of believing you and taking you at your
[1:07:16] word
[1:07:18] may we see
[1:07:20] supreme faith revealed in abraham
[1:07:23] may we see it unfold in our own lives
[1:07:26] bless your people tonight maybe go home
[1:07:29] full in our hearts
[1:07:30] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:07:32] pray
[1:07:34] amen amen
