[0:01] continue on the subject of the
[0:04] seven seven bad habits of highly
[0:07] ineffective parents and we um will just
[0:11] take a few moments here at the outset to
[0:13] touch on uh I actually just want to take
[0:15] a couple couple moments to kind of recap
[0:18] that whole subject and I'll say this if
[0:20] you're here and you're not uh you don't
[0:23] have uh you don't have children or
[0:25] you're not married I would say these
[0:27] principles that we're exploring are
[0:28] instructive for all relationship ship
[0:30] not just uh parents to children but it's
[0:33] instructive for all relationships it's
[0:35] for individuals it's for uh for other
[0:38] relationships we might have to other
[0:39] people even single people can draw
[0:41] things from it uh maybe to use the bud
[0:43] word buzzword for today it's TurnKey
[0:45] it's scalable uh it's relatable however
[0:48] you want to look at it these things are
[0:49] not just isolated to parents and we were
[0:52] looking at these uh seven bad habits of
[0:54] highly ineffective parents and we see
[0:57] them here in this slide that it's
[0:59] overemphasizing ing carnal things uh
[1:01] inconsistently instructing and
[1:04] correcting improperly judging
[1:06] inappropriately using voice wrongly
[1:10] disciplining not being an example and
[1:13] withholding Grace what I've done is I've
[1:15] given my children a template to call me
[1:17] out on numbers 1 to 7 if I engage in any
[1:20] one of these uh bad habits but as we
[1:23] looked at these last time we saw that
[1:25] each bad habit had a correlating uh
[1:27] characteristic in the stature of a
[1:29] perfect man and it provided a contrast
[1:32] so you could see these things are the
[1:34] bad habits but there is an inverse there
[1:36] is a good habit uh there is a positive
[1:39] trait or attribute and so you could look
[1:40] at this and say with number seven
[1:42] withholding Grace is a bad habit then
[1:44] showing Grace is a good habit so there's
[1:47] a way that you could express this in the
[1:49] positive uh I characterized it this way
[1:52] because I like to make the point that
[1:54] I've learned from my mistakes not so
[1:55] much my uh god-given wisdom I've learned
[1:57] more from my mistakes in the ways that I
[2:00] fought against uh certain things or done
[2:02] things in my own mind or own my own
[2:04] ability and I could say I know what the
[2:06] bad habits are Lord let me learn from
[2:08] these to identify the good habits so
[2:11] tonight we're going to look at
[2:12] overemphasizing carnal things and that's
[2:14] our maybe even our title tonight could
[2:16] be even phrased as overemphasizing
[2:19] carnal things and we look when we looked
[2:22] at this on uh last Wednesday we were
[2:26] contrasting these uh these carnal things
[2:29] by faith that if if you're
[2:30] overemphasizing carnal things then then
[2:32] what's the contrast to that what
[2:34] correlates to that in a positive sense
[2:36] and we were saying that we ought to be
[2:38] families focused on the word and one
[2:41] thing that uh I I like to use a little
[2:43] bit of a play on words as we hear focus
[2:45] on the family you've heard that before
[2:47] now now this you don't need to email Dr
[2:49] Dobson after this but I think um that
[2:52] it's good to focus on the family but a
[2:54] family ought to be focused on the word
[2:56] and and so we could focus on the family
[2:58] to its own detriment just by pouring
[3:00] ourselves into family and doing things
[3:02] in response to family but doing it apart
[3:04] from the word or forsaking the word and
[3:06] we want our kids to be well fed we want
[3:08] them to sleep we want them to get a good
[3:09] education we want them to do all these
[3:11] things a a and have well-rounded hobbies
[3:13] and be social and these different things
[3:15] but if we do it at the sake of the word
[3:17] or risking uh forsaking the word then
[3:19] it's just a detriment to them so we
[3:21] ought to be families focused on the word
[3:24] now the quote I drew from in that is
[3:25] from the statue of a perfect man he says
[3:27] now you're going to build a house and
[3:29] and you pour the foundation and say booy
[3:31] I got her what's he pointing out if you
[3:33] have the foundation you don't quite have
[3:35] the house yet he says you got the
[3:37] foundation to build your house on now
[3:39] you got to build a house now there's
[3:41] where the big the thing comes in this
[3:43] morning we're going to talk about now a
[3:45] house this Foundation is first what is
[3:47] the foundation of Christianity faith in
[3:49] the word of God that's your
[3:52] foundation then you begin to grow then
[3:54] you start you begin to add to this
[3:56] foundation so the foundation of our
[3:59] spirit spiritual house even us as
[4:01] individuals the foundation of the the
[4:03] home that we have with our families it
[4:05] has to be and it must be faith in the
[4:08] word of God that's the foundation we
[4:10] build if you're going to go build a
[4:11] house uh in the just in the natural
[4:15] you're going to make sure you have a
[4:16] good foundation so the most important
[4:18] things you can do in the beginning is
[4:19] finding out what kind of foundation you
[4:21] need to build and what does the dirt
[4:22] look like underneath and is their good
[4:24] bedrock and will the foundation hold and
[4:26] so this is where a lot of the work goes
[4:28] in is in this initial stage of have
[4:29] laying the foundation and it applies for
[4:32] our lives naturally or or spiritually as
[4:34] individuals and it applies to our
[4:36] families we need to have some sort of
[4:38] Bedrock some sort of foundation that
[4:40] this is what our family is based upon
[4:42] this is what it's built on this is what
[4:43] determines uh what we do is the word of
[4:46] God now I've used the phrase
[4:49] overemphasizing carnal things I did it
[4:51] on purpose uh because I realized that
[4:54] life demands attention to carnal things
[4:57] that was going to be my biggest amen I
[4:58] thought tonight was
[5:00] that was that part there so I hope it
[5:02] just gets better from there but life
[5:04] demands our attention to carnal things
[5:06] and you don't have to be evil it's just
[5:08] this is what life does and we know even
[5:10] scripturally that we cannot disregard
[5:13] carnal things Bible tells us a man who
[5:15] provides not for his family is worse
[5:17] than an Infidel and it's not just
[5:19] talking about spiritually it's talking
[5:20] about even in the natural to provide the
[5:23] things that are necessary the Bible even
[5:24] tells us he that is married careth for
[5:26] the things of the world how he may
[5:27] please his wife so it's a natur thing to
[5:30] give attention to carnal things even
[5:32] from a sincere heart and even in being
[5:35] obedient to the word and so the emphasis
[5:38] is on overemphasis it's not that we
[5:40] would give any attention we shouldn't
[5:42] give any attention to carnal things but
[5:44] it's when we overemphasize carnal things
[5:46] and because life demands attention to it
[5:49] we must be careful not to overemphasize
[5:51] it and to also emphasize spiritual
[5:55] things and that could just be the
[5:56] reverse you say what what would be a
[5:58] good habit emphasizing spiritual things
[6:01] now in Colossians chap 1:
[6:03] 18 just going to we're going to lay some
[6:07] principles in to
[6:09] support uh this uh just to build the
[6:13] thought on a bad habit is
[6:15] overemphasizing carnal things in
[6:17] Colossians 1:8 speaking of Christ it
[6:21] says and he is the head of the body the
[6:23] church who is the beginning the
[6:25] firstborn from the dead that in all
[6:27] things he might have the preeminence so
[6:30] Christ is the head better be the head of
[6:32] your life he's the head of the church
[6:34] and it says that he is to have
[6:36] preeminence that means to be first to
[6:38] hold the first place on Sunday when
[6:41] we're preaching about our family tree we
[6:43] wanted to spend a lot of time showing
[6:45] that Christ is that body Christ is that
[6:48] tree he is our family tree he is the the
[6:51] vine we are the branches and it's what
[6:53] all that we are part of he must have the
[6:55] preeminence he must have the first place
[6:57] he's the head of the body of the church
[6:59] he is the beginning the firstborn from
[7:01] the dead that in all
[7:03] things right all things he might have
[7:06] the preeminence not just some things but
[7:08] all things that means to hold the first
[7:10] place now we could emphasize this
[7:13] through scripture and we could certainly
[7:14] use a lot of um support showing that
[7:16] Christ is to have preeminence in his
[7:18] church and this is the pattern for his
[7:20] church but it also establishes the
[7:22] pattern for our family order establishes
[7:25] the pattern for our home life you could
[7:28] ask yourselves well the church church we
[7:29] have to put Christ first in the church
[7:31] Christ has to be the first thing at
[7:33] Arizona Believers Church we need to put
[7:34] Christ first but if none of you were
[7:36] doing that in your personal lives how
[7:38] successful do you think we would be in
[7:40] allowing Christ to be first here am and
[7:43] we could have a picture of them we could
[7:44] call it Christ First Church H and we
[7:47] could do all sorts of things to try to
[7:48] make Christ the center and have them let
[7:50] them have preeminence but if we're not
[7:51] letting them have preeminence in our
[7:53] homes and our prayer life and our
[7:54] natural lives and the way that we
[7:55] conduct ourselves um Beyond these four
[7:58] walls then it's Greater Life likelihood
[8:00] if not probably an impossibility for
[8:02] Christ to have preeminence in this
[8:03] church let and even think of in terms of
[8:06] the bride of Christ if we as individuals
[8:08] and families aren't letting him have
[8:09] preeminence then how can he have
[8:11] preeminence in all things and so it
[8:13] establishes a pattern for your family
[8:15] structure for our home life now in 1
[8:18] Corinthians
[8:20] 11:3 he said but I would have you know
[8:22] that the head of every man is Christ and
[8:25] the head of the woman is the man and the
[8:26] head of Christ is God
[8:29] we know that this establishes an order
[8:32] of relation to one another an
[8:34] arrangement of each part to each other
[8:36] and among each other and it says we we
[8:39] kind of the head of the woman is the man
[8:42] and but then it says the head of every
[8:43] man is
[8:44] Christ and so if we looked into family
[8:47] the husband being the head of the wife
[8:48] or the husband the father being the head
[8:50] of the family uh that we can say well
[8:52] he's the head in the family but who's
[8:54] the head of the father it says here the
[8:56] head of every man is Christ and so in
[8:59] every home Christ has the headship there
[9:02] may be a there may be an arrangement to
[9:04] where the husband is considered the head
[9:05] between a man and a wife and within a
[9:07] family but then his head is Christ and
[9:10] Christ's head is God and that
[9:12] establishes establishes the proper order
[9:14] and arrangement of things so a man in
[9:17] his family say I'm the head I'm the head
[9:18] but you better be subject to Christ and
[9:21] it's through that that Christ has the
[9:23] preeminence in the family when we let
[9:25] him have headship in our lives and
[9:28] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[9:29] brother Bram said he should be the
[9:31] Principal theme of our talking of our
[9:33] thinking of our singing of our walks he
[9:37] should be the Principal theme of our
[9:39] life if he's the principal theme of The
[9:41] Bible and the Bible is in us then he
[9:43] should be the Principal theme of
[9:45] everything that we do say or think
[9:49] that's one of the outstanding quotes in
[9:50] this sermon Christ having the
[9:52] preeminence is in his bride it's he must
[9:54] be the Principal theme in everything we
[9:57] do say or think
[10:03] the principal theme of our talking
[10:05] thinking singing and of our walking he
[10:07] should be the Principal theme now if you
[10:11] look at Psalms chapter 16 and I'm
[10:13] realizing now that I forgot to make a
[10:15] few announcements but I don't mind
[10:17] making them now uh the Jenkin family is
[10:19] still sick we hope trust that you're uh
[10:22] still praying for them and then also the
[10:24] Rubik he mentioned I think brother Ian
[10:26] was not feeling well this evening I
[10:28] think sister Jennifer's still not
[10:29] feeling well they're not calling
[10:30] nobody's calling it co anymore but man
[10:32] there's a real nasty bug that's going
[10:34] around and inflicting people and also
[10:36] keep for failing to mention that brother
[10:38] Micah has gone on a three three-week
[10:40] vacation and so that's why he hasn't
[10:42] been playing the piano he hasn't been
[10:43] fired I know loyal thought he was going
[10:45] to be fired nobody's getting fired Mike
[10:47] is just on a little bit of a trip we
[10:49] miss him very very much so pray for him
[10:50] he should be coming back next week Psalm
[10:53] 16: 8 and9 notice what David says and I
[10:57] want to draw draw very deeply from these
[10:59] phrases he uses here because there's a
[11:01] tremendous principle he says I have set
[11:03] the lord always before me that's putting
[11:06] him first I've set the lord always
[11:08] before me because he is at my right hand
[11:11] I shall not be moved why is he unmovable
[11:14] because he because he is set the lord
[11:15] always before him and he's at my right
[11:18] hand I shall not be moved and there's a
[11:20] therefore here's a causal connection
[11:22] therefore my heart is glad and my glory
[11:25] rejoiceth My Flesh also shall Rest In
[11:28] Hope now look at these verses and think
[11:30] of how he how he says I'm putting the
[11:32] Lord first and because I put the Lord
[11:34] first I'm unmovable and being unmovable
[11:37] being steadfast in the right things by
[11:39] letting him have the preeminence and him
[11:41] being the principal theme and letting
[11:43] him be the head therefore my heart is
[11:46] glad here's the source of my joy my my
[11:49] glory rejoices this is the source of my
[11:51] strength he's talking about strength and
[11:52] fortitude a Happy Spirit a strong body
[11:55] in my flesh is at rest this is a
[11:58] tremendous uh scripture I think all of
[12:01] us could say that's what I want when I
[12:02] wake up on a Thursday morning I want a
[12:04] glad heart I want a strength that
[12:05] rejoiceth and I want my flesh to rest in
[12:07] hope this is a this is a a peaceful
[12:10] feeling right and so Ponder this as we
[12:13] compare think about and I just want to
[12:15] share my thesis with you at this point
[12:17] because we're comparing spiritual things
[12:19] with carnal things and in this there is
[12:23] and I'm wanting to emphasize this in
[12:25] such a way and I would say this is what
[12:27] I'm wanting to bring out tonight is that
[12:31] if you emphasize spiritual things it
[12:33] brings depth spiritual things provides a
[12:36] deeper connection carnal things it's
[12:37] really really shallow but spiritual
[12:39] things it brings depth as David is
[12:41] saying here there's a security in it I
[12:43] shall not be moved so there's a
[12:45] stability and he says my my heart is
[12:47] glad so there's happiness in it my glory
[12:49] rejoiceth there's strength in it he says
[12:51] my flesh shall rest in hope there's
[12:53] Comfort it's a comfortable peaceful uh
[12:55] uh feeling whenever you are emphasizing
[12:58] spiritual things you sow to that you're
[13:00] going to reap stability you're going to
[13:01] reap security you're going to reap death
[13:04] it says when the Bible says that you
[13:05] know if you let the Lord uh seek the
[13:07] Lord and put him first and there's
[13:09] certain things that says then no weapon
[13:10] formed against you shall prosper no evil
[13:12] shall come nigh thy dwelling why because
[13:14] you let him have the preeminence you've
[13:17] let him be your habitation you're
[13:19] putting him first there's Security in
[13:21] that there's stability in them and so
[13:24] with carnal things the inverse is true
[13:26] carnal things just feed shallowness it's
[13:29] always fleeting it's very it's very
[13:31] short uh what it does if you find that
[13:33] you can't feed to the Flesh and then the
[13:35] flesh be all right that's
[13:36] enough right you ever have you ever told
[13:39] your children go ahead you can play you
[13:41] can play Madden 22 uh uh for 20 minutes
[13:44] and is that ever enough It's never
[13:46] enough maybe that's going to be my
[13:48] biggest amen there's always got to be at
[13:50] least one more game one more play
[13:52] because the the the the flesh is never
[13:54] like Ah that's enough right until the
[13:56] flesh doesn't know what's going on right
[13:58] and that's why it's it's it's uh it's to
[14:01] be noted that whenever people do the
[14:02] things they do in the world on Friday
[14:04] and Saturday night they generally wake
[14:05] up in the morning say I don't ever want
[14:07] to do that again right and then they
[14:09] forget 12 hours later because they're
[14:10] right back at it again but I've never
[14:12] been drunk off the presence of God and
[14:14] ever said I don't want to do that again
[14:16] amen never been in the presence of God
[14:18] never been in a meeting never been in a
[14:20] prayer line I've never seen the power of
[14:21] God move never seen the gifts manifested
[14:23] never felt wept in his presence and
[14:25] rejoiced in his song Service never sat
[14:27] hearing the word of God and left it said
[14:29] well I don't ever want to do that
[14:31] again why because when you sew to carnal
[14:33] things it's fleeting it's shallow and
[14:36] carnal things promote
[14:37] fear when you feed to carnal things it
[14:40] promotes fear it promotes frustration
[14:42] and I would even challenge us as parents
[14:44] to use some exercise some discernment in
[14:47] watch that when the when our the Flesh
[14:49] of our children is being fed how it
[14:51] leads to them being fussy short-tempered
[14:54] a and their tension spans have to be
[14:57] kind of dealt with in a particular way
[14:59] why because spiritual things breed one
[15:01] things carnal things breed
[15:03] another and the message lifting him up
[15:05] out of
[15:07] History brother Bram says we have a home
[15:10] life crisis this phrase home life I
[15:12] think I was pting it today that maybe it
[15:15] would be worth it just to maybe Define
[15:16] it in a
[15:18] service but I think you could you can
[15:20] pretty much gather what he's meaning
[15:22] here we have a home life crisis it's all
[15:26] encompassing the our homes our
[15:28] relationships and what it's like even
[15:30] within our houses as we know it doesn't
[15:32] take a house to make a home that home
[15:35] has something to do with the feeling of
[15:37] it he says it seems like the home life
[15:39] is running out into shallow
[15:41] water it used to be in a home I trust
[15:45] you're all listening tonight I like how
[15:47] God just he makes up the the
[15:49] congregation and he makes up the
[15:51] audience in a particular way uh just to
[15:53] accomplish just to accomplish the right
[15:55] thing as the word Goes Forth I think
[15:57] it's just it's a it's a great makeup
[15:59] tonight of people to hear this he says
[16:01] it used to be in a home that father the
[16:04] head of the house would sit down in the
[16:05] morning and would speak with his family
[16:07] and they would all take out the old
[16:09] Family Bible and just read a little bit
[16:11] and gather around the table and have
[16:12] prayer he saiding that's the way that it
[16:14] used to be and we all said amen because
[16:17] that's the way that it used to be and uh
[16:19] we don't even know what an old family
[16:20] Bible is anymore it's like is that an an
[16:22] app you haven't updated yet uh but it's
[16:25] an old we take out the old Family Bible
[16:27] and you read it for a little bit and
[16:28] everybody have prayer so now he's wants
[16:30] to think of the way that it used to be
[16:32] we might say well the good old days well
[16:33] it was a day when Christ was still in
[16:35] the
[16:36] church he says you don't see that
[16:38] anymore and when they the day was done
[16:41] and Ma had the dishes washed they'd all
[16:43] gather around re Gather in and read some
[16:46] more the Bible and pray before going to
[16:49] bed so they started their day reading
[16:50] the Bible entered their day reading the
[16:52] Bible and in prayer he said this is the
[16:54] way the days looked like and I'm just
[16:55] wanting you to ponder these days versus
[16:58] our days or even our own lives he says
[17:00] juvenile delinquency certainly was a
[17:02] hard thing to find in them days the boys
[17:05] went to the fields to work and the girls
[17:07] help Mom with washing down at the creek
[17:09] but today we push a little button and
[17:11] the dishes are all done and M's in the
[17:13] car and gone to the card part a card
[17:15] party or out she's riding around over
[17:18] the streets and the work's done by a
[17:20] tractor and we just don't have nothing
[17:23] but just a bunch of lazy Idol
[17:26] people they you could put these in more
[17:28] even in modern terms in the sense that
[17:31] all the all the things that we've done
[17:33] to try to make life easier hasn't bought
[17:35] us more time we don't have any more time
[17:38] now than when you had to wash the dishes
[17:40] by hand or go down to the creek to get
[17:42] water we've lost time even with having
[17:45] uh infrastructure with plumbing and
[17:48] water inhouse and everything that we
[17:50] have and push a button and wash the
[17:51] dishes he says but people he's saying
[17:53] people have by The Virtue that become
[17:55] lazy and where where is it they've
[17:58] become lazy he say home life is so
[18:00] neglected until the Bible's laidback
[18:02] till they have have to hunt for an hour
[18:04] to find one in many homes in America now
[18:08] you may laugh at this but I was in the
[18:10] home of a minister one time who who who
[18:12] was being critical of the word of God
[18:15] and he and he was trying to refer to a
[18:16] scripture and I just said well what
[18:18] scripture are you referring to and he
[18:20] goes well I I don't have my Bible I'm
[18:22] like well brother you're a pastor of a
[18:24] church surely there's a Bible in your
[18:25] house somewhere and I guess there just
[18:27] wasn't one with Within Reach cuz he
[18:29] didn't want to go there and get
[18:30] scripture with me but he says till the
[18:33] Bible's laidback and they'd have to hunt
[18:35] for an hour to find one in many homes in
[18:38] America I wonder just how applicable
[18:40] that is for some homes that we might
[18:42] visit where's the
[18:44] Bible and he makes the statement just a
[18:46] little bit later he says home life is
[18:47] running out now I just want you to catch
[18:50] this contrast that he's identifying in
[18:53] these things that seem to be competing
[18:56] uh for time we don't we don't have have
[18:58] to handwash the dishes but what has that
[19:00] bought us time to do what what what's
[19:02] taking up our time and he says home life
[19:05] is neglected how is home life neglected
[19:07] to the point to where the Bible's not
[19:08] even able to be found he says it's it's
[19:10] just running out makes this statement in
[19:13] the sermon unwelcomed Christ he says we
[19:15] failed to entertain Jesus after we've
[19:17] invited him to our place he's drawing
[19:19] the parallel of how Simon had invited
[19:21] Christ and he was the unwelcomed Christ
[19:23] and he sat there with uh Dirty Feet just
[19:26] a Wallflower in a party that he was was
[19:28] invited too he says many time you're too
[19:31] busy at home in your home
[19:33] life you've got so many things to do you
[19:36] can't take time to pray just too
[19:40] busy is this is this true yes I remember
[19:43] when I was doing a youth uh a youth
[19:46] convention in South Africa and on one of
[19:49] the morning Services I think they had
[19:50] like five services in a day and their
[19:52] first morning service was really really
[19:53] early thankfully I didn't preach very
[19:55] many of those but um uh I remember one
[19:58] particular one uh brother kidan had
[20:01] asked all the young people and brother
[20:03] villy that church there in Johannesburg
[20:05] was the host church and brother Gideon
[20:07] running it and he's the pastor there now
[20:09] he asked all the young people uh what
[20:12] their typical day or how much time they
[20:14] spent in prayer and how much time they
[20:16] spent reading their Bibles and in the
[20:18] word of God and and he kind of got an
[20:20] aggregate of everybody how much they got
[20:22] and then he kind of went along a little
[20:23] bit further and he said let's map out
[20:25] your days and said what do you guys do
[20:26] what time do you wake up and you got a
[20:27] consensus of when they wake up then
[20:29] what's the next thing you do and
[20:30] everybody went through and as a few
[20:32] hundred young people charted out what
[20:34] would have been like the average day of
[20:37] of of these these young people and when
[20:39] it was all done they had their entire
[20:41] day mapped out from the time they wake
[20:43] up to the time they go to sleep and when
[20:44] they did their schedule there wasn't one
[20:46] place in there where they said they
[20:48] actually prayed or read their
[20:49] Bibles even though they had said well we
[20:51] do it 20 minutes we do it 30 minutes
[20:53] we're doing it for an hour but when it
[20:54] came down to actually filling out the
[20:56] schedule there really there was no place
[20:57] in it where they were actually doing it
[21:00] you just get too busy you've got so many
[21:03] things you have to do I've been
[21:05] pondering on it too maybe use it as a
[21:08] principle that's instructive to us but I
[21:11] I actually am trying to be more
[21:12] disciplined even in the language I use I
[21:14] don't even say I'm busy
[21:16] anymore because I'm I have time I'm the
[21:18] master of my own time to say I'm busy is
[21:20] to say well I I maybe I'm too important
[21:22] for you or or it even means I'm subject
[21:25] to whoever needs my attention and I'm
[21:27] bound to my schedule and I'm bound to
[21:29] appointments and I'm bound to all these
[21:30] things that demand my time I'm not too
[21:32] busy I'm not even busy I have things I
[21:35] need to do and and I'm the master of my
[21:37] own time and even in a way start
[21:39] changing the language we use about
[21:41] ourselves so that we say wait a minute
[21:43] I'm not subject to this world I'm not
[21:45] subject to its demands I'm not subject
[21:46] to its economics and I have time to make
[21:50] time for
[21:51] Jesus so you got so many things you have
[21:54] to do you can't take time to pray just
[21:55] too busy too busy in your home life
[21:59] in Deuteronomy chapter 6 this was our
[22:01] text I really like how um there many
[22:05] different principles in this and I think
[22:06] I'm just I just have time maybe to read
[22:08] it to you and touch on some of these
[22:10] things but let's uh let's look at
[22:13] verse well just verse six and he says
[22:16] and these words which I command thee
[22:17] this day shall be in thy heart so the
[22:21] word must be in our hearts it's where it
[22:23] must be as parents the word must be in
[22:24] our heart now the word in our heart
[22:27] notice what he says and thou th shalt
[22:28] teach them diligently unto thy
[22:30] children now there is a
[22:35] a there is an inference here at least
[22:38] that we could at least make that the
[22:41] word is in our hearts as the parents and
[22:44] it's not they our our children having
[22:46] not experienced the same birth we have
[22:49] need to be taught the word which we've
[22:51] received says Thou shalt teach them
[22:53] diligently unto thy children what what
[22:55] the word in your heart and shalt talk
[22:58] them when thou sest in thy house you're
[23:00] like okay good we'll just we just won't
[23:02] sit very often in our house and when
[23:04] thou walkest by the way when thou liest
[23:07] down and when thou risest up I would say
[23:10] it's probably even just a figurative
[23:12] language to express talk about it
[23:15] rehearse it don't let it ever become
[23:18] unfamiliar I've been studied on the the
[23:20] the the concept of the word is NY and
[23:23] and how that in in that very meaning
[23:25] it's you're familiar with it yes you
[23:28] know it this isn't unfamiliar to you
[23:30] it's not like all of a sudden it's not
[23:31] riding these things on day one well we
[23:33] hear there's a strange guy come as a
[23:35] delivery while they're in Egypt no they
[23:37] had been around it so long it was
[23:39] something familiar to them and so we
[23:41] must teach the word to our children talk
[23:43] about it to them when we're walking when
[23:45] we're standing when we're coming when
[23:46] we're going it says Thou shalt bind them
[23:47] for a sign upon thy hand and they shall
[23:49] be frontlets between Thine Eyes what is
[23:51] it trying to express this is something
[23:53] that has preeminence the word is
[23:56] something familiar the word is something
[23:57] that are our children know it's
[23:59] something we talk about it's something
[24:00] that we are identified with and thou
[24:02] shalt write them upon the post of thy
[24:05] house and on thy Gates there has to be
[24:07] constant
[24:09] reminders a and o opportunities to lift
[24:12] up the word of
[24:13] God write them upon the post of the
[24:16] house and on thy Gates talk about it to
[24:17] your children teach them diligently unto
[24:20] your children I would say this is not
[24:22] just an Old Testament precept but this
[24:24] is a present day commandment to us
[24:26] within our families that we the word
[24:28] that is in our heart we ought to teach
[24:30] diligently to our children talk to them
[24:33] about this word when we're in our homes
[24:34] when we walk in the way when we lay down
[24:36] when we rise up there's the morning
[24:38] there's the evening there's everything
[24:39] in between there's somehow that the word
[24:41] of God is having
[24:43] preeminence and he says and it shall be
[24:46] when the Lord thy God shall have brought
[24:48] thee into the land which he swear un thy
[24:50] fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob
[24:52] to give thee great and goodly cities
[24:54] which thou buildest not and houses full
[24:56] of all good things which thou fillest
[24:58] not Wells dig which thou diggest not not
[25:00] Vineyards and olive trees which thou
[25:02] plest not when thou shalt have eaten and
[25:04] be full what do you have good goodly and
[25:07] great cities you have houses full of
[25:09] good things you have wells you have
[25:11] Vineyards think of all the things God
[25:12] provides by his word and he says then
[25:16] beware then beware lest thou forget the
[25:19] Lord which brought thee out of the land
[25:21] of Egypt from the house of bondage taken
[25:24] out of the house of bondage the word of
[25:26] God provides all these things he he's
[25:28] saying teach them diligently under your
[25:29] children rehearse them to them talk
[25:32] about it keep it always fresh in their
[25:34] mind what God did for you to bring you
[25:36] out of the house of bondage let the
[25:38] supernatural always be something that is
[25:40] expected amongst in your family believe
[25:42] for the supernatural believe in the hand
[25:44] of God believe in healing how many
[25:46] parents can testify how wonderful it is
[25:48] when someone's sick and something's
[25:50] wrong and it's one of your children that
[25:51] says how about we just
[25:53] pray I remember one time there's a maybe
[25:56] a very uh terrific event in a terrifying
[25:59] way taking place in our in our lives and
[26:02] Elizabeth and I were just concerned
[26:03] about it in prayer Elliot was really
[26:05] really young and maybe just even four or
[26:07] five years old he walked in the room he
[26:08] said well all things work together for
[26:10] the
[26:13] good like whatever that means to a
[26:15] 5-year-old that's wonderful but that's
[26:18] the that's what you want sometimes is
[26:19] just that reminder hey we can always
[26:21] pray right Dad we can always do this and
[26:23] that's a way that we can it's even
[26:26] what's beautiful about it is if we could
[26:28] share the word of God to our children
[26:30] they're going to take it and just accept
[26:32] it by faith accept it in its Purity
[26:35] accept it for just the way that you've
[26:37] presented to them and they don't have
[26:39] all the Decades of doubting that we do
[26:41] well I don't know about this and I don't
[26:43] know about that well I had this
[26:44] situation one time they just take God
[26:46] his word and they can believe and they
[26:47] can actually be a mirror for you
[26:49] sometimes when we really need
[26:51] it teach them diligently and it says
[26:54] beware lest thou forget the Lord
[26:58] so I think there's a connection there
[27:00] even to the great and goodly cities and
[27:01] the house is full of all good things
[27:03] it's coming from these people who have
[27:04] the word in their heart who teach it
[27:06] diligently to their children and they're
[27:07] sure to never forget the Lord but if you
[27:09] do what happens you're going to go right
[27:10] back to a house of bondage again a home
[27:14] can become a house of
[27:17] bondage I love how brother brandham
[27:19] tells the story in
[27:21] perseverance and just the I think this
[27:23] is paragraph 25 in paragraph 16 he's
[27:25] talking about Noah now he sat down he
[27:27] read his Bible to family he rehearsed
[27:29] these things to his family then he uses
[27:30] David as an example he says look at
[27:32] David Little David no doubt raised in a
[27:34] lovely believing home his father Jesse a
[27:37] great man no doubt gathered all those
[27:40] boys around at night and had family
[27:42] prayer before they went to bed probably
[27:44] read the
[27:46] Scrolls and talked about great Jehovah
[27:49] that had opened up the Red Sea and a
[27:51] great prophet Moses had brought them out
[27:53] following the pillar of fire all these
[27:55] things that created faith
[27:59] when David is out there in the
[28:01] field tending his father's sheep where
[28:05] did David have the background and a
[28:08] resource how did he even have it in his
[28:10] mind to believe that he could defeat the
[28:12] lion he could defeat the Bear in family
[28:15] devotions where is it our children are
[28:18] going to gain the the confidence to
[28:20] withstand Temptation at school family
[28:23] devotions where are they going to have
[28:24] the confidence withstand pressure within
[28:26] family gatherings amongst unbelievers
[28:28] where are they going to withstand it
[28:29] when they're in their own private time
[28:31] on their computers or their phones where
[28:32] are they going to draw Str when we in
[28:34] our homes have lifted up Christ and put
[28:36] the put the right things before
[28:41] them he says faith cometh by hearing
[28:43] hearing of the word of God Little David
[28:45] got to thinking on that of course he was
[28:46] kind of the smallest one of the family
[28:48] so they put him out to watch the Sheep
[28:50] watch a few sheep and he was responsible
[28:51] for those sheep and one day a lion came
[28:53] in and got one he thought now what am I
[28:55] going to say to my father about this
[28:56] sheep being missing and he happened to
[28:59] remember that my father read from the
[29:02] Scrolls and told me that God was a great
[29:04] God to deliver his people and that he
[29:06] would bless Israel and he was with
[29:08] Israel and I am one of them and all that
[29:10] circumcise circumcised and in the
[29:12] Covenant God's blessing is upon them and
[29:14] I'm one of them I'm circumcised and
[29:16] God's blessings upon me I have a right
[29:19] one of my father's sheep is gone so I'm
[29:21] going after that
[29:23] sheep where's David drawn the strength
[29:25] we could say well he was ordained do it
[29:27] and he had the Heart Of God well God
[29:29] committed him to a father named
[29:31] Jesse who cultivated whatever God had
[29:33] put in him by election or by natural
[29:35] makeup it took this time of the father
[29:38] reading the Bible Gathering the sons
[29:40] together he says and having family
[29:42] prayer before they went to bed and he
[29:44] says very plainly that created
[29:48] Faith think about that that created
[29:52] Faith through those family gatherings
[29:53] those times
[29:55] together where we just kind Maybe be
[29:58] hinting at it right now but I believe
[29:59] one of the best ways we can as a family
[30:02] guard against overemphasizing carnal
[30:05] things is by having time around
[30:07] spiritual things specifically in family
[30:09] devotions prayer time before we go to
[30:11] bed reading the Bible there's so much uh
[30:14] access to good uh to the message of the
[30:17] hour and and the in the word of God and
[30:19] the right things that we should be
[30:21] taking time for
[30:22] that in Psalms 127
[30:25] ver1 except the Lord build the house
[30:28] they labor in vain that build it except
[30:32] the Lord keep the city The Watchman
[30:34] waketh but in vain is everybody heard
[30:38] that scripture before very very uh
[30:40] familiar
[30:44] scripture except the Lord build the
[30:47] house they labor in vain that build it
[30:50] it's important to note that you still
[30:52] have to
[30:53] labor because they you have to be
[30:56] laboring but except the Lord build with
[30:58] you and labor with you all your building
[31:00] is in vain it's important for the
[31:03] Watchman to continue to watch and to
[31:05] wake but except the Lord keep the city
[31:08] he's waking in vain so the labor is
[31:11] necessary the waking is necessary but
[31:13] it's all worthless unless God does it
[31:15] with
[31:16] us so unless the Lord build the house
[31:19] except the Lord keep the city as we read
[31:23] in the very beginning brother B saids
[31:24] now you're going to build a house you
[31:26] first lay the foundation you got to have
[31:27] a found Foundation to build your house
[31:29] on I believe that as men we are called
[31:32] to be home builders and as ladies you
[31:34] are called to be home
[31:36] makers so there's things that we we
[31:38] ought to be building things we ought to
[31:39] be doing and it relates to the home the
[31:41] home life the things that we're called
[31:43] to do as man and woman and but except
[31:45] the Lord build the house you're going to
[31:47] labor in vain even if you're building
[31:49] except the Lord keep the city the
[31:50] Watchman waketh but in vain so the Lord
[31:54] has to be have has to have
[31:56] preeminence and the sermon believest
[31:58] thou
[32:00] this brother bradam
[32:03] says when Jesus goes away from your home
[32:07] sickness and sorrow will come
[32:09] in just a very uh very simple
[32:13] formula when Jesus goes away from your
[32:15] home sickness and sorrow will come in
[32:18] you can say well this family's sick did
[32:20] Jesus leave their home well they may be
[32:21] sick but I know there's no
[32:23] sorrow it's the despair that comes if
[32:26] Jesus is in your home and you're sick
[32:28] then there's a different attitude and
[32:29] approach that you take it's not just wow
[32:31] people who suffer calamities have
[32:32] rejected Christ but it's the sorrow it's
[32:34] the despondency it it's the despair he's
[32:37] saying when Jesus goes away from your
[32:39] home this is the principle it's trouble
[32:41] that's on the way when Jesus leaves the
[32:43] home he says if you turn Jesus down at
[32:45] your home how do you turn down Jesus at
[32:47] your home quit having family prayer quit
[32:50] having Bible readings and so forth in
[32:52] your home look for trouble to come
[32:55] in I I if you are a believer I this is a
[32:58] simple principle that you ought to
[33:01] always remind yourself that if trouble's
[33:02] at your doorstep ask yourself are we
[33:05] doing the things that we know we ought
[33:06] to be doing as Believers because if not
[33:09] it's probably the explanation as to why
[33:11] trouble's there and you know then I
[33:14] better address these things to deal with
[33:16] the trouble and then if you're doing all
[33:18] these things and troubles at the door
[33:19] then you got you have confidence amen
[33:21] you have confidence you're prepared you
[33:23] you know how to prepare yourself you
[33:24] know how to face the trouble when Jesus
[33:26] goes away from your home you turn him
[33:28] down by not having family prayer not
[33:30] having Bible readings and so forth look
[33:32] for trouble to come in why if you're
[33:35] sewing de carnal things and you're
[33:36] sewing you're you're going to reap bre
[33:38] uh breed shallow things Hollow things
[33:41] empty things and there's going to be a
[33:43] fear frustration and Trouble on its
[33:47] way this one will be a fun one to try to
[33:50] figure out what in the world brother
[33:51] man's talking about here but in the
[33:53] message
[33:54] influences he says then we find other
[33:56] things it used to be wrong long for the
[33:58] Holiness people to attend bioscop or
[34:01] movies you know says now they got all
[34:03] the time now they go all the time and
[34:06] then Satan pulled a fast one on you and
[34:08] put the television right in your house
[34:10] and fixed it in there he says but all
[34:13] these things that it used to be
[34:15] wrong
[34:17] now it might be peculiar to some people
[34:19] you might think oh well here it
[34:21] goes but just give an honest look to
[34:24] it give an honest look even today
[34:27] there's a lot of scholarship there's
[34:29] even a lot of you'll find it even with
[34:30] the what's being expressed by The Poets
[34:33] and by the writers is all the ills of
[34:36] media and the influence of Hollywood and
[34:39] the influence of Television the
[34:40] influence of movies and there may be one
[34:43] side that tries to blame every mass
[34:45] shooting on video games or every time
[34:47] there's violence they try to blame it on
[34:49] on rap or something like that there's
[34:50] all sorts of platitudes on either side
[34:52] but they can all agree that there's a
[34:54] lot of stuff that's coming from these
[34:56] channels that's in influenc in the way
[34:58] that people think and the way that they
[34:59] act you can see the wisdom of having
[35:02] these an arms length relationship to
[35:04] these he says well what is it it comes
[35:06] in so gradual until the first thing you
[35:09] know it's just got you it's like a Vine
[35:11] growing around you now if you'll keep
[35:13] that vine away from you and just keep
[35:16] wrapped around Jesus around the word and
[35:19] stay with that you'll grow
[35:21] straight that's crooked and it pulls you
[35:24] off the road but these other influences
[35:27] the these the carnal things it's just a
[35:30] simple principle the all the channels
[35:33] and the outlets that you can that you
[35:35] can get carnal things through all the
[35:37] markets all the means whether it be the
[35:39] cell phones the tablets the video games
[35:41] whatever it is you can just think about
[35:43] it in your own way what conduit the
[35:46] carnal things comes through if you want
[35:48] to feed on that you can expect a
[35:50] particular result and said it's going to
[35:52] grow you crooked it's going to pull you
[35:54] off the road it's going to cause you to
[35:55] think about things and lust for things
[35:57] and desire to do certain things and it's
[35:59] going to pull you off the road he says
[36:00] but if you stay wrapped up in Christ
[36:01] you'll grow straight he says Christ
[36:03] pulls you up that pulls you
[36:06] sideways how do people get bent how do
[36:08] they get sideways it's by the things
[36:10] that you feed on the things that have
[36:12] preeminence right job said it in job 48
[36:16] even as I have seen they that plow
[36:17] iniquity and so wickedness reap the same
[36:21] job had it right they that plow iniquity
[36:25] and sow wickedness reap what iniquity in
[36:28] wickedness you can't expect to uh um to
[36:31] sew to the Flesh and get spiritual
[36:35] things what do they say is it the
[36:37] definition of insanity is to continue to
[36:39] do the same thing and expect different
[36:42] results and that would be Insanity I
[36:45] keep I keep banging my head against the
[36:46] wall and I keep having
[36:47] headaches and he's said that there's a
[36:49] you got to ponder if you're Soul plowing
[36:52] iniquity sewing wickedness you're going
[36:53] to reap iniquity you're going to reap
[36:56] wickedness so the right the right
[36:59] emphasis as we're saying we do not want
[37:01] to overemphasize carnal things because
[37:03] of the the the the detrimental impact of
[37:06] these carnal things and yes we have to
[37:08] give attention to them but an
[37:10] overemphasis will spill us over into the
[37:12] wrong way pull us sideways as it says
[37:15] then we realize that the right emphasis
[37:17] will bring the right
[37:19] atmosphere the right atmosphere will
[37:21] bring the right
[37:22] results the right the right emphasis
[37:25] will bring the right atmosphere you have
[37:27] you have remarkable power within your
[37:29] homes and among your relationships with
[37:30] your children even your spouse you have
[37:33] a remarkable power to emphasize the
[37:36] right thing and in doing so create the
[37:37] right atmosphere even in conversations
[37:40] and when difficulties come up there's a
[37:42] way that things could happen immedately
[37:43] can just focus on the negative but
[37:45] there's even a way to approach very
[37:47] disasters and calamities and differences
[37:50] and and struggles and problems even with
[37:51] our children and waywardness whatever it
[37:53] may be there's a positive approach and
[37:55] there's a right emphasis that can bring
[37:57] the right atmosphere that's going to
[37:58] bring the right
[38:00] results in the message his wonders to
[38:04] perform I'm almost done tonight isin't
[38:06] that
[38:07] wonderful I'm glad you laughed and
[38:09] didn't say Amen real
[38:11] loud but in his in his message his
[38:13] wonders to perform this statement is so
[38:15] profound the reason we don't have the
[38:18] spiritual blessings all right take it
[38:21] off let's just think about that what's
[38:23] the reason we don't have spiritual
[38:25] blessings should we break out into some
[38:28] uh discussion groups right why don't we
[38:31] have spiritual blessings and I could
[38:32] imagine if we had just presented this as
[38:34] a a subject amongst ministers breakout
[38:37] session why don't we have spiritual
[38:39] blessings well you see brother Aon we
[38:41] haven't placed the seven Thunders just
[38:43] exactly where they need to be the reason
[38:46] why we don't have spiritual blessings is
[38:47] not everybody is speaking in tongues the
[38:49] reason and all these things we can come
[38:51] up with why we don't have spiritual
[38:53] blessings and I'm telling you what I'm
[38:54] about to read you it may be in the
[38:56] language of the 19 60s but put it in the
[38:58] language of 2022 and you'll find the
[39:01] principal is the same today as it has
[39:04] ever been go ahead and show that brother
[39:06] John the reason we don't have the
[39:07] spiritual blessings we have too much
[39:09] time to watch television too much time
[39:12] to read the newspapers those are things
[39:13] that they used to throw on your lawn
[39:15] they printed it out today it's just on
[39:16] websites the newspapers are listen to
[39:19] something that we ought not to be
[39:20] listening
[39:21] to they've just made it too easy haven't
[39:24] they whether it be podcast whether it be
[39:28] uh
[39:30] YouTube Spotify Apple music You Name It
[39:33] Whatever it might be it's just too easy
[39:35] these days to have at our
[39:37] fingertips so many things to listen to
[39:41] to read and to keep our
[39:44] thoughts and he says and we're not
[39:46] Redeeming the time but we are giving it
[39:48] to the things of the world instead of
[39:50] our time to the Lord
[39:52] Jesus and the Bible said that man shall
[39:54] not live by bread alone but by every
[39:56] word that proceedeth from the mouth of
[39:59] God Christians live on the word amen the
[40:05] reason why we don't have spiritual
[40:06] blessings we're given too much time to
[40:08] the world and not enough time to the
[40:11] word it's that simple enough to where if
[40:14] someone said I I just don't believe I
[40:16] have any spiritual blessings the
[40:17] spiritual blessings have dried up just
[40:18] do an
[40:19] audit do it an AIT in your life and ask
[40:22] yourself how much do I give to the world
[40:24] how much do I give to the word and and
[40:27] I'd had these notes and I I kind of
[40:28] pushed them off thinking we could
[40:30] expound upon it at another service to
[40:31] Greater depth but I'll just make
[40:34] reference to here we might think in our
[40:36] minds well if I need to give equal time
[40:38] to the word or more time to the word we
[40:40] think that means kneeling and praying it
[40:42] means reading our Bibles or you know
[40:44] being some Franciscan monks or something
[40:46] like that and and fasting and just
[40:48] transcribing the scripture on uh paper
[40:50] towels or something but it it it's not
[40:53] it's not those kind of things alone if
[40:55] you want to write the Bible on a paper
[40:57] to that's fine but it's not those kind
[40:59] of religious sacrifices and reading and
[41:02] praying alone and I'm not making light
[41:03] of reading and praying because we think
[41:05] in the terms of I want to spe feed on
[41:08] spiritual things we I think I'm going to
[41:09] pray to Christ I'm going to read my
[41:10] Bible I'm going to listen to the word of
[41:12] God those are all part of it but you can
[41:14] sew to the spirit and you can do uh
[41:18] emphasize spiritual things by doing
[41:19] things for
[41:21] others by living for others by by by
[41:24] finding out what the needs might be by
[41:26] giving yourself to serice I I I I I want
[41:28] to emphasize this now because it's going
[41:30] to be one of the points of emphasis on
[41:31] the series of our family tree that this
[41:34] church is becoming a place is a place
[41:37] for you to serve it is a place for you
[41:39] to give it is a place for you to find
[41:42] things that are enriching and fulfilling
[41:43] and say well I want to I want to stop
[41:45] sewing to carnal things well there's
[41:47] things that you can do to sew to
[41:49] spiritual things and it doesn't just
[41:50] evolve being alone and praying and
[41:52] fasting but there's a way that you can
[41:54] be looking out on the needs of others
[41:56] and mindful of the things that are
[41:57] taking place around you and in doing so
[41:59] you're sewing to the right things
[42:01] Christians can live on the word not just
[42:03] by only reading the Bible and praying
[42:06] but that being translated into a life of
[42:09] service remember for sister Elizabeth
[42:11] and I when we we lived here in Phoenix
[42:14] before our neighbors were brother Robert
[42:16] and sister Jill McGary and one of the
[42:18] things that stood out to us that we
[42:20] loved so much is they were teaching
[42:22] their family to serve and it was
[42:25] something they did it was something they
[42:26] did as a family it was something that
[42:27] they their home was always
[42:29] welcoming and and still is and and their
[42:31] Spirits just just free in that regards
[42:34] and it was something that inspired us
[42:35] and even to this day we use uh those
[42:38] mcgar without an e I'm not going to say
[42:40] it represents Elohim or anything like
[42:42] that but they spell their names a little
[42:44] bit differently but it was it's still an
[42:46] inspiration to us that we want our
[42:48] children to be servants we want them to
[42:49] serve other people we want them to give
[42:51] and I'd say that's something that uh the
[42:54] mcgar were doing and and to so to
[42:57] spiritual things and I bet they could
[42:59] testify they've benefited from it and we
[43:02] are the recipients of it as it became a
[43:03] tremendous example to
[43:05] us in Galatians chapter 6: 7 8 and N
[43:09] this is my last scripture that I'm going
[43:11] to read
[43:13] tonight he says be not deceived God is
[43:15] Not mocked that should get our attention
[43:18] for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he
[43:20] also reap for he that Seth to his flesh
[43:24] shall of the flesh reap corruption Paul
[43:28] is very deliberate in the way that he
[43:30] phrases this he wants us to understand
[43:32] that if we that if
[43:34] we're if if we think that we can bypass
[43:37] this law we're deceiving ourselves
[43:39] because God will not be mocked you can't
[43:41] seow something and not reap it you reap
[43:45] what you sow is the phrase that we might
[43:46] use succinctly but it says whatsoever a
[43:48] man Seth that shall he also reap so he
[43:50] brings it and he's very deliberate in
[43:51] his language he that Seth to his flesh
[43:53] shall of the flesh reap corruption if
[43:56] you go to carnal things you're going to
[43:58] reap corruption in carnal things because
[44:01] of carnal things there's going to be a
[44:03] detriment there's going to be a loss
[44:05] it's going to be carnality that you
[44:06] begin to experience he says but he that
[44:08] Seth to the
[44:10] spirit shall of the spirit reap life
[44:14] Everlasting this in no way places it
[44:17] within our power to seow seeds of
[44:20] eternal life that we could be saved or
[44:21] somehow if we sow to the spirit we're
[44:23] going to reap eternal life but this
[44:25] speaks of our spiritual condition
[44:27] and even the fruitfulness of Our Lives I
[44:29] could say now God is Not mocked as
[44:31] Believers filled with the Holy Ghost if
[44:33] the word is in your heart and you sow to
[44:36] the spirit you're going to reap
[44:38] spiritual benefits a fruitful life but
[44:42] if you sow to the flesh you're going to
[44:43] reap
[44:44] carnality it's going to tend to
[44:46] corruption it's going to be what erodes
[44:47] the atmosphere in our homes it's what
[44:49] breeds fear and causes
[44:51] frustration and it just seems maybe you
[44:54] could fellowship with me a little in
[44:55] this it just seems that we're always
[44:57] living on a Razor's Edge right right
[45:00] where things just seem really really
[45:01] awesome and things are going really
[45:03] really good like you know what this is
[45:04] the happiest day of my life this is
[45:06] awesome God you're so good and then one
[45:08] moment later it's like oh my goodness
[45:09] what
[45:10] happened right you know how it feels
[45:12] sometimes brother Travis where it's like
[45:14] everything's great next thing you know
[45:15] it's like hey I didn't even have to
[45:16] travel down the hill I just fell right
[45:18] off a
[45:19] cliff because it just seems like a
[45:21] Razor's Edge it's just there you're just
[45:24] always so close to frustration always so
[45:27] close to hurt always so close to pain
[45:29] always so close to the bad all the more
[45:31] we ought to be more careful and
[45:33] deliberate in the way that we step
[45:35] because we're on this precipice now
[45:36] where it's just not easy anymore for
[45:39] Christians Christians don't sin
[45:42] cheaply we don't doubt cheaply there's a
[45:45] cost there's a detriment there there
[45:47] maybe there was a time when it seemed
[45:48] like we had this great huge buffer in
[45:50] this great huge gap but we're living in
[45:51] a time where Satan has pressed himself
[45:53] right up to the precipice he's right
[45:55] there waiting to catch you and to snare
[45:56] you and we have to be more deliberate
[45:58] and on guard than we ever have in any
[46:00] time because it's just a Razor's Edge
[46:04] amen and I love verse n and let us not
[46:07] be weary and
[46:08] wello let us not be weary and well-doing
[46:11] what a tremendous admonition do not be
[46:14] weary and well-doing for in due season
[46:16] we shall reap if we faint not in other
[46:18] words continue to sww to the right
[46:20] things there is a
[46:22] payoff I would even say this to parents
[46:25] if you sew do the right things with your
[46:26] your children don't fret there will be a
[46:28] payoff in our own families if you're
[46:30] doing the right thing and doing the
[46:32] right thing and things just don't seem
[46:33] to be rewarding things don't seem to be
[46:34] coming upright stick with it sew to the
[46:37] right things and don't be weary in
[46:39] sewing to the right things because there
[46:41] will be a harvest amen there will be a
[46:48] harvest say it with me there will be a
[46:52] harvest all right the message influences
[46:57] just two statements to close
[47:02] on I think this one will get our
[47:04] attention I think today our great
[47:05] problem of what we believe to be
[47:06] juvenile
[47:08] delinquency is parent delinquent a home
[47:11] delinquent I've noticed this in some of
[47:13] the news stories as of late or just
[47:16] several the last over the last many many
[47:19] years you'll find that there seems to be
[47:22] something broken in the home life behind
[47:24] the headlines right
[47:28] and you say well it's juvenile
[47:30] delinquency but there's it may not all
[47:33] the I wouldn't want to generalize not in
[47:35] every case but you often find the Home
[47:37] was
[47:38] broken he says I know there's sometimes
[47:40] the schools and things he says and and
[47:44] now it making the hes broken he says I
[47:47] know sometimes there's schools and
[47:47] things but notice what he says here and
[47:49] Sunday school about a half hour or an
[47:51] hour on Sunday morning so we get put the
[47:54] kids in Sunday school and the world has
[47:56] the kids the rest rest of the week and
[47:58] cram into them more than a
[48:01] teacher and many times too many times
[48:04] the teacher's got a little quarterly
[48:05] that she teaches out of while she paints
[48:07] her lips and fixes her hair lets the
[48:09] children do the best they can and then
[48:12] at home they get no Christian training
[48:15] at
[48:16] all now to me the two most the two most
[48:19] important phrases
[48:21] here is they come to church on Sunday
[48:23] morning and the world has them the rest
[48:24] of the week and then when at home they
[48:27] get no Christian training at all you you
[48:30] following that they come to church on
[48:32] Sunday morning then they go out in
[48:34] school and they're in school for several
[48:35] hours a day five days a week and then
[48:38] what's happening at home brother bram's
[48:41] not saying what happening at school is
[48:42] the
[48:43] problem it's what's not happening at
[48:46] home that's the
[48:47] problem says that the world will cram
[48:50] into them everything they can the rest
[48:51] of the week and the det real detriment
[48:53] is there's no at home they get no
[48:56] Christian training at
[48:58] all I if if you feel led if you do not
[49:01] feel led to homeschool your kids then by
[49:04] all means don't force yourself to
[49:05] homeschool I think sometimes there can
[49:06] be this pressure that's put on uh people
[49:09] you got a home school you got a
[49:09] homeschool you got to do what God wants
[49:10] you to do you got to do what you know
[49:12] you can do you got to do know do what
[49:14] you have faith to do and my
[49:17] mother-in-law had this Faith to send her
[49:19] kids to public school she knew that in
[49:21] doing so she could honor the Lord and I
[49:23] believe that if we are in a situation
[49:25] where we either feel led to sin s our
[49:27] kids or we have to send our kids there
[49:29] should there I understand the fear and
[49:31] the fretting but remember home life has
[49:34] the ability to inoculate them against
[49:37] school
[49:38] life because it's not so much oh don't
[49:40] send your kids to school he's saying
[49:42] just be sure they get Christian training
[49:44] at home just be sure they're being
[49:46] taught the right things at home it's the
[49:48] training that you do not just in Sunday
[49:50] school on Sunday morning but it's the
[49:52] training that you do throughout the week
[49:54] with your children by teaching them
[49:57] diligently talking to them and when
[49:59] you're walking when you're Rising when
[50:00] you're sitting when you're coming and
[50:01] you're going by binding these things
[50:03] about towards before them that's the
[50:05] kind of training that strengthens them
[50:08] against the rest of the
[50:13] week we have an obligation we have a
[50:16] duty to train
[50:17] them my final statements from The Sermon
[50:20] Just One More Time
[50:22] Lord It's just asking some questions
[50:24] we're closing here so we're just asking
[50:26] some question
[50:27] questions he says you
[50:29] fathers you
[50:31] mothers are you ready to establish an
[50:33] altar in your
[50:35] house and take that television out I'm
[50:38] I'm not asking I'm not the one asking
[50:40] all right ponder it are you ready to
[50:43] take that deck of cards off the
[50:46] table now just think of the equivalent
[50:48] right just think of the
[50:50] equivalent this phrase here should get
[50:53] our attention them comic books that your
[50:55] children's reading
[50:57] preparing their little mind for a blast
[50:59] that the devil's going to give
[51:02] them what do these things prepare our
[51:05] children's mind for a blast that the
[51:08] devil's going to give them we're either
[51:11] preparing our children for Spiritual
[51:12] things or you're going to be preparing
[51:14] them for carnal things you're either
[51:18] going to be developing an appetite for
[51:19] the right things or an appetite for who
[51:22] knows what else and even in the comic
[51:25] books he says it's preparing in their
[51:27] mind for a blast that the devil's going
[51:29] to give them it's laying a foundation
[51:31] for future
[51:33] temptation is that what we want to be
[51:35] doing in our homes laying a foundation
[51:37] for future Temptation I had a brother
[51:40] sharing with me an experience that he
[51:41] had just as a teenager where he was
[51:43] reading a a book that we might think is
[51:47] completely ah well it's just all fantasy
[51:49] you know what's the harm minut it but
[51:51] there was a seed sewn in that that
[51:54] pushed him in a direction it in in in a
[51:57] in in a in a bondage that was terrible
[52:00] very very horrible for
[52:02] him and and and it was something so
[52:05] would seem so innocent oh that's just
[52:08] harmless and I'm not trying to get us
[52:10] all suspicious well what was it brother
[52:11] Aaron what was it uh I I want you just
[52:14] to think of your own experiences because
[52:16] this brother gained something from that
[52:18] and now today he's very circumspect
[52:21] about influences and the things he
[52:22] allows his children to feed on because
[52:24] he realizes as just a young teenager
[52:26] just one little example uh opened up
[52:29] something to him that brought great pain
[52:30] and hardship to his life and we have to
[52:33] realize that there's things we can
[52:34] expose our children to now that's laying
[52:37] the foundation for future Temptation
[52:39] only making it easier for them to say
[52:41] yes to the devil all by the things we
[52:43] expose them to now brother Aon this is
[52:46] real legalistic preaching this is really
[52:48] Clos line preaching what's legalistic
[52:50] about it I haven't told you one thing
[52:52] that you should do right I'm getting you
[52:56] to think about it and if it's if it's
[52:59] making you get a little bit defensive
[53:00] maybe you need to lean into that a
[53:03] little bit and ask yourself hm why am I
[53:05] getting so
[53:07] defensive why is the devil whispering in
[53:09] my ear that guy's oldfashioned he
[53:10] doesn't know what he's talking about oh
[53:12] my goodness he's another stick in the
[53:13] mud you know no fun no good guy and
[53:16] you're over there going this is awful
[53:18] this is horrible we're living in 2022
[53:20] we're free really are
[53:24] you on he says are you ready to
[53:27] establish the old family altar
[53:30] again or do you just want to continue on
[53:32] the way you
[53:36] are I'd like to be able to do it
[53:38] Brothers we have a altar that was given
[53:40] to us from Cornerstone Christian
[53:42] Tabernacle I think we have enough room
[53:43] to put it here there there's a shorter
[53:46] one I almost brought it in here
[53:47] tonight and I believe we ought to have
[53:49] that place we could
[53:51] pray here we may not have a lot of room
[53:53] but I think we got room to pray and and
[53:56] I want you to think about it tonight as
[53:57] we close are you ready to
[54:01] establish the old family altar again
[54:05] does that phrase mean anything to some
[54:06] of you tonight the old family altar did
[54:09] did you have a concept of that brother
[54:12] Wes the old family
[54:14] altar brother Manuel is our concept the
[54:16] old family altar you know some of us
[54:19] were raised in homes where we didn't
[54:21] pray at night as families we didn't do
[54:23] devotions we we we didn't have we didn't
[54:25] have any kind of Str structure within
[54:26] our families where there was some point
[54:28] during the day in our time together at
[54:31] some point even though it could have
[54:33] been very very small some of us don't
[54:34] even have that at all in our history
[54:36] family history to draw from and so I'm
[54:39] going to tell you right now that this is
[54:41] a tremendous principle that we can gain
[54:44] as families to find some way on a
[54:47] consistent and regular basis to have a
[54:50] family
[54:51] altar brother Aaron does that mean we
[54:53] have to have a big huge Bible and a
[54:55] place with a doily underneath it and a
[54:57] little table and we all get together and
[54:58] we kneel down and we pray doesn't have
[55:00] to be exactly structured that way but
[55:02] just find some way as a family to get
[55:04] around the word and talk about the
[55:06] things of God and you know what's so
[55:08] beautiful about that that creates
[55:13] Faith with our heads bowed tonight I ask
[55:17] you are you ready to
[55:20] establish the family altar again I'll
[55:22] ask it this way are you ready to
[55:24] emphasize spiritual things
[55:28] or I you just want to continue
[55:30] overemphasizing carnal
[55:32] things our heavenly father as we stand
[55:36] before these people
[55:38] tonight I'm praying for them
[55:42] Lord I'm praying Lord that in this dark
[55:47] day with so many pressures and so many
[55:53] uh feelings in our spirit Lord
[55:57] we may not say that we are but in so
[55:59] many ways we're the very least dependent
[56:03] upon technology if not just outright
[56:06] addicted to
[56:07] it we reach for it Lord and we are drawn
[56:12] to it it's so easy to get a hold of so
[56:16] easy to let it have the prees
[56:21] Lord but father tonight we're just
[56:24] stopping we're just slowing down even in
[56:25] this moment we're just pausing and I'm
[56:28] asking the people tonight if they'd like
[56:30] to take inventory of their
[56:33] lives and find some
[56:35] way to bring you back in our homes some
[56:39] way to let you have the preeminence some
[56:41] way to purpose in our hearts that as a
[56:43] family we'll gather together we'll pray
[56:45] we'll pray at least we'll read a
[56:46] scripture at least we'll we'll testify
[56:48] we'll talk about things we'll we we'll
[56:51] obey this uh command in Deuteronomy to
[56:54] speak about these things that you have
[56:55] done to tell our testimonies to lift up
[56:58] the great things that you've
[57:01] done and Lord I pray tonight that
[57:04] there'd not be one both here part of
[57:06] this church streaming that would say
[57:08] they just want to stay the way they
[57:10] are that no matter
[57:12] how to this point something inside of us
[57:16] is I want to do
[57:18] more I want to do more I pray that you
[57:21] bless these families and bless these
[57:23] people we commit them to you tonight in
[57:25] the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ
[57:27] amen amen God bless you let's Stand
[57:30] Together
