[0:00] first corinthians chapter 8 verses 7 to
[0:03] 13
[0:04] how be it there is not in every man that
[0:06] knowledge
[0:07] for some with conscience of the idol and
[0:09] to this hour eat it as a thing offered
[0:11] unto an idol
[0:12] and their conscience being weak is
[0:14] defiled but meat commendeth us not to
[0:17] god for neither if we eat
[0:18] or we or are we the better neither if we
[0:21] eat not
[0:22] are we the worse but take heed lest by
[0:24] any means this liberty of yours become
[0:26] a stumbling block to them that are weak
[0:29] for if any man see
[0:30] thee which has knowledge sit at meat in
[0:32] it the idol's temple
[0:33] shall not the conscious of him which is
[0:35] weak be emboldened to eat those things
[0:37] which are offered two idols
[0:39] and through thine knowledge shall the
[0:40] weak brother perish for whom christ died
[0:43] but when you sin so against the brethren
[0:45] and wound their weak conscience
[0:47] ye sin against christ wherefore if meat
[0:50] make my brother to offend
[0:52] i will eat no flesh while the world
[0:54] standeth lest i make my brother to
[0:56] offend
[0:57] amen you can be seated my title today is
[1:01] not too vegan or not to vegan
[1:04] my title is continuing on the subject of
[1:06] pure joy
[1:08] and in particular a clean conscience
[1:12] and we're going to be drawing quite a
[1:14] bit just from this particular passage
[1:16] here
[1:17] and we welcome all the visitors that are
[1:19] with us today it's so nice to see the
[1:20] house of the lord full
[1:22] and we trust that the lord would be your
[1:23] portion
[1:25] just uh i'll just cover a few things at
[1:27] the outset um that a review
[1:29] picking up from some the prior services
[1:32] we're looking at this statement in the
[1:33] church age book where brother branham
[1:35] says our spirit is clean
[1:37] it is fresh it is real it is sober and
[1:41] serious
[1:42] but nonetheless full of the joy of the
[1:44] lord
[1:45] the christian ought to be just as
[1:46] exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[1:48] the lord
[1:50] as the world is when it savors and
[1:51] delights in its pleasures now that's
[1:54] quite a standard
[1:55] when you think of just how zealous the
[1:57] world can be for worldly things and the
[1:58] passion
[1:59] that is exhibited for air and the
[2:01] passion that is exhibited for
[2:02] unrighteousness uh ours ought to at
[2:05] least
[2:06] match if not exceed the zeal and
[2:09] enthusiasm for error ours for truth our
[2:12] zeal for truth ought to exceed that
[2:14] both christians and the world are human
[2:16] the worldly perhaps may be a way to
[2:18] think about it both christians and the
[2:20] worldly are human both have emotions
[2:22] the difference is the christians hearts
[2:25] and emotions are purely on the lord of
[2:27] glory and his love
[2:29] while the world satisfies the flesh
[2:32] and so the joy that we're talking about
[2:33] is not a joy that we could derive from
[2:36] focusing on the flesh or even being able
[2:38] to meet all the needs of our flesh and
[2:40] and provide things related to pleasure
[2:43] and provision and our flesh being
[2:44] clothed
[2:45] that's not the joy of the lord and one
[2:48] thing that we're
[2:48] identifying is that if a christian does
[2:50] not experience
[2:52] joy this is a state of mind not the
[2:54] state of the soul
[2:56] if you're sealed by the holy ghost then
[2:58] then that's permanent
[3:00] the seal of god cannot cannot fail so if
[3:03] you're not experiencing joy
[3:04] what the devil would want to do is take
[3:06] this disconcerting emotion or just a
[3:09] lack of
[3:09] uh maybe emotional uh balance and try to
[3:13] play just thinking well you're not a
[3:14] christian or not much of a christian how
[3:16] could you be a daughter of god and
[3:17] stress out
[3:18] and how could you be so worried and how
[3:19] could be plagued with anxiety to the
[3:22] point of physical problems if you really
[3:23] had faith
[3:24] and so the devil targets us in that area
[3:27] and i'm wanting just to emphasize this
[3:30] if there's any lack of joy in our lives
[3:32] as a christian that's a state of mind
[3:35] not the state of the soul and as soon as
[3:38] you can kind of take that weapon away
[3:39] from the devil
[3:40] then it's going to help you to achieve
[3:42] the experience of joy
[3:44] and drive away that sadness much more
[3:46] easily
[3:47] and so we looked at how our hearts or
[3:49] minds hearts and minds i like to use
[3:51] them as synonymous
[3:52] and then refer to the soul as the soul
[3:55] and
[3:56] um but there's different ways that we
[3:57] can use semantics a little bit
[3:59] differently
[4:00] but our hearts this bible says can
[4:01] condemn us
[4:03] and if our hearts condemn us that'll
[4:05] keep us from fully walking in
[4:07] god's love for us because the condemned
[4:09] heart it creates this fear towards god
[4:12] and the threat of punishment and well i
[4:14] i know that i love him and i want to be
[4:16] his child but he's mad at me or he's
[4:18] going to withhold blessings from me or
[4:20] maybe i've sinned past the day of grace
[4:22] and maybe i've crossed the line and
[4:24] there's all sorts of fear that tries to
[4:26] come in or well i know i'm his daughter
[4:28] or no i'm his son but you know i've
[4:30] probably lost all my rights and
[4:31] privileges
[4:32] that's just how the heart can work
[4:34] against us and then we're reluctant
[4:36] we're reluctant to walk fully in god's
[4:38] love for us
[4:39] and so as we're looking at this subject
[4:42] of a clean conscience
[4:44] this is a mind at peace despite any
[4:48] emotional pain
[4:50] this is a heart that is at rest despite
[4:52] any
[4:53] any other feelings or emotions that we
[4:55] might say are negative
[4:58] and a component of this clean conscience
[5:00] is a conscience that is clean
[5:02] has no is uh does not have guilt
[5:05] hovering hovering over it to have a a
[5:08] free conscience or clean conscience or a
[5:11] clear conscience
[5:12] means i know that my sins have been
[5:14] forgiven i'm not
[5:15] under the threat of punishment and with
[5:17] that being released from guilt i'm
[5:19] released from condemnation
[5:21] so a clean a clean conscience is one
[5:24] that could say yeah i know you reap what
[5:25] you sow and i know that maybe i'm sad
[5:27] right now i know this is a
[5:29] difficult situation and my nerves seem
[5:31] to be a little bit on edge but i know in
[5:33] my heart i know my standing with god i
[5:35] know that he's gonna see me through
[5:37] and that's that's a part of our human
[5:40] makeup that once it can be
[5:41] just clear with god and connected with
[5:44] that power of god that's in our souls
[5:45] then that has the ability to take
[5:47] anything else and bring it into harmony
[5:50] and so it's uh um it's a
[5:54] it's a lie it's not the absence of
[5:57] sadness that
[5:58] but it's this uh this pure joy within
[6:01] our souls that connects with our
[6:02] conscience
[6:03] that begins to help us to override
[6:05] anything negative that would bring us
[6:07] down
[6:08] so conscience as we're using this phrase
[6:11] conscience
[6:13] is the faculty of knowing what is right
[6:16] and if you have a conscience it's an
[6:17] awareness that whether or not our
[6:19] conduct
[6:20] aligns with or agrees with what we
[6:22] believe
[6:23] so you can have a belief of something
[6:25] that it's wrong to do this
[6:26] and then if you do it your conscience
[6:28] tells you you shouldn't have done that
[6:30] or as you go to do it your conscience is
[6:32] telling you don't do that you know that
[6:33] it's wrong or
[6:34] you know there's a particular outcome if
[6:36] that happens or there's a consequence
[6:38] and your conscience says oh buddy don't
[6:39] do it you know you know you know better
[6:42] and you kind of go against your
[6:43] conscience then when you're done it's
[6:44] that conscience that gives you the
[6:46] feeling of guilt and so that's
[6:48] that's our conscience so it causes us to
[6:50] feel guilt when we've done wrong
[6:51] but it actually commends us when we've
[6:52] done good something in your heart pricks
[6:55] you says that's the right thing to do
[6:56] when you do it it's your conscience
[6:58] that kind of says attaboy you did a good
[7:00] job way to go so that's
[7:01] it works in both ways and so conscience
[7:05] now
[7:06] as we've done this is kind of review
[7:07] from last sunday it's different from
[7:09] consciousness
[7:11] so conscience but this is different from
[7:13] being conscious
[7:14] and conscious uh consciousness relates
[7:16] to our feelings
[7:18] our perception in the awareness of the
[7:20] things around us things that we can
[7:22] identify through sense and so our
[7:25] consciousness
[7:26] is our ability to live and it just
[7:29] allows us to live in the world that's
[7:30] around us
[7:32] and well i know that there's there's a
[7:33] door here there's light there's things
[7:35] around me that's that's what my
[7:36] consciousness do
[7:37] it does but my conscience our conscience
[7:41] is our ability
[7:42] to live as we should in the world that
[7:45] we're aware of
[7:46] our kind so there's a there's a there's
[7:49] a consciousness of the situation there's
[7:51] a consciousness
[7:52] of the circumstances but then our
[7:53] conscience allows us to live as we
[7:56] should be or live as we really are
[7:57] called to be
[7:58] in the in the situation that we're in
[8:01] it would even be the appropriate
[8:03] response for the circumstance conscience
[8:05] allows us
[8:06] to do the thing that would be right
[8:07] based upon the situation that we're
[8:09] facing
[8:10] and because if you if you don't have a
[8:12] consciousness then
[8:13] then really you could do something but
[8:15] oh you were not aware of what was
[8:17] happening
[8:17] you should have that that was not the
[8:19] right thing to do uh because you just
[8:21] weren't
[8:22] aware of a particular situation there's
[8:24] some people in my life i've defended
[8:26] people say man they're mean and they're
[8:28] rude
[8:29] and they're insensitive and i've said no
[8:31] they're just clueless
[8:34] because if they knew if if they knew
[8:36] then they wouldn't have done that
[8:38] and so are to have a conscience is
[8:41] together with this to be conscious of
[8:43] things allows us to do the right thing
[8:46] and one thing that we uh even on
[8:48] wednesday nights
[8:50] uh it's it's been kind of emphasizing
[8:52] this area
[8:53] a laodicea is conscious right she's woke
[8:57] right at a girl she's woke but it's lost
[9:00] any moral
[9:01] conscience to know what to do with her
[9:04] wokeness
[9:05] okay yeah oh that's awful that's
[9:07] horrible what do we do with it
[9:08] what would be the right response what's
[9:10] going to bring a remedy how are we how
[9:11] are we going to
[9:12] choose the right thing to do and without
[9:14] a moral conscience
[9:16] then you cannot properly do good and so
[9:19] this is
[9:19] those are some of the themes from the
[9:21] last time now if you'll turn to matthew
[9:23] chapter 22
[9:24] 37 i'd like to begin to
[9:28] look at a particular aspect of our our
[9:31] human makeup
[9:32] as it's outlined in the scripture and in
[9:35] doing
[9:36] so um you just kind of lead to the
[9:40] something that's just a real real thrust
[9:42] in my heart about a clean conscience
[9:44] jesus said unto him thou shalt love the
[9:46] lord thy god with all thy heart
[9:49] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[9:52] now this is jesus now provoking
[9:56] him to love god with all his heart
[10:00] and to love him with all his soul and to
[10:02] love with him love him with all his mind
[10:05] well it suggests that there is some
[10:07] ability in each one of these areas
[10:10] to love to have to have an affection
[10:13] and in the in the greek heart is cardia
[10:15] and it actually kind of is
[10:16] almost referring to the physical heart
[10:19] the the soul is
[10:20] is suke and the mind is dionya
[10:23] and so there's a different words that
[10:25] are used for each one of these different
[10:27] aspects heart
[10:28] soul and mind and what i'm wanting is
[10:30] just to begin to think about these are
[10:31] three different things
[10:32] within the individual person these are
[10:34] three different things
[10:36] now let me say this emotions and
[10:38] feelings
[10:39] are not without consequence so jesus is
[10:42] saying love the lord thy god with all
[10:44] thy heart with all thy soul with all thy
[10:45] mind
[10:46] so you say well i love god with my soul
[10:48] and that's that's the part that's
[10:49] redeemed and born again i love him with
[10:51] my soul but then it says you should also
[10:53] do it with all your heart and all your
[10:54] mind
[10:55] so this is this is a unique commandment
[10:58] this is a unique demand
[10:59] and so it it begins to help us to
[11:01] understand and although many other
[11:03] scriptures do as well
[11:04] that emotions and we understand emotions
[11:06] and feelings are not without consequence
[11:09] we realize that our emotions that how we
[11:12] feel when we do something
[11:14] actually characterizes what we're doing
[11:16] that if you're angry when you do
[11:18] something the act
[11:18] in itself may not not be one that is
[11:22] of of anger but if you do something in
[11:24] anger
[11:25] you can actually sow frustration or so
[11:27] anger
[11:28] in your action and the way that we're
[11:30] feeling at a particular moment when we
[11:32] experience something
[11:33] can actually color our memory of that
[11:35] particular activity
[11:36] for the rest of our lives if you if
[11:39] you're really anxious one time and
[11:41] really bound or having a panic attack in
[11:43] a particular
[11:44] area and then you you go on and years
[11:46] later you find yourself right in the
[11:47] same
[11:48] place again just geographically and also
[11:50] in your heart starts racing
[11:52] you start getting really nervous why
[11:53] because the feelings and emotions that
[11:55] we have
[11:55] have consequences and what we'll begin
[11:59] to identify
[12:00] is they're not beyond god's concern
[12:04] they're not beyond god's care he doesn't
[12:07] just ask us to love him within the soul
[12:08] but he says
[12:09] your heart and your mind so these
[12:11] elements of these aspects of our person
[12:13] are not beyond the purview of the word
[12:15] the word looks at them it addresses them
[12:17] and is concerned about them
[12:19] so god commands us to love him with all
[12:21] of our minds
[12:23] this is a faculty of understanding this
[12:25] is this speaks of our feelings
[12:27] this is actually our desires this would
[12:30] relate to the human spirit
[12:31] to love him within that realm paul
[12:34] writes in first thessalonians chapter 5
[12:36] verse 23 and the very god of peace
[12:39] sanctify you
[12:40] wholly this is so it's a complete
[12:42] sanctification of your person
[12:44] and i pray god your whole spirit
[12:47] and soul and body so let's say the
[12:49] entirety of your spirit the entirety of
[12:51] your soul the entirety of your body i
[12:53] pray that your whole person
[12:55] spirit body and soul would be preserved
[12:58] blameless a blameless body a blameless
[13:02] spirit
[13:02] a blameless soul this is a this is a
[13:04] lofty prayer but let's just think for a
[13:06] moment
[13:07] this was the prayer of apostle paul this
[13:09] speaks to the heart of god who would
[13:11] desire that your spirit be
[13:12] preserved blameless desire that your
[13:15] bodies would be made whole
[13:16] unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
[13:18] so the there's
[13:19] the word spirit pneuma with in the greek
[13:22] it speaks of the spirit the suke again
[13:24] is the soul the body the greek word is
[13:26] soma
[13:27] i just use those not to impress you with
[13:29] my ability to click a link and find out
[13:30] what the greek is
[13:32] but rather to just identify that these
[13:34] are particular things with a different
[13:36] word and it's identifying
[13:38] separate parts of our one being
[13:41] it's separating you as a person into
[13:43] three components
[13:45] a soul a spirit and a body
[13:48] as it says in hebrews chapter 4 verse 12
[13:50] for the word of god is quick and
[13:51] powerful
[13:52] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[13:54] piercing even to
[13:56] this is what the word can do now divide
[13:58] between divine asunder of soul
[14:01] so the word can make a difference and a
[14:03] distinction between the soul
[14:04] and spirit and in doing so the word
[14:07] knows how to address the soul for its
[14:09] benefit
[14:10] and it also knows how to address the
[14:11] spirit for its benefit
[14:13] because no no you don't you got to do
[14:15] this this way you got to do this that
[14:17] way
[14:18] it causes me to think about when you're
[14:20] when you smoke the brisket which we
[14:22] we do that right here i
[14:25] often hear the phrase my dad's a smoker
[14:27] and i have to quickly say of meats
[14:29] i'm a smoker of meats without paper
[14:32] i do it on a smoker and when you and
[14:36] brother maybe brother travis is just
[14:37] itching to get here and set me straight
[14:39] but when you when you smoke a brisket
[14:41] when it's all done you go to cutting it
[14:42] you need to find the right way to cut it
[14:45] you're going to be on the point there's
[14:46] a particular way you're cutting it
[14:48] because you want to cut it across the
[14:49] grain
[14:49] and that's going to yield a more
[14:51] tendency these are the things you learn
[14:52] in church i'm telling you they pay
[14:53] dividends
[14:55] and it's going to allow that brisket to
[14:56] taste but then you're going to get to a
[14:58] certain point
[14:59] no pun intended where you're going to
[15:02] have to flip that thing around and cut
[15:03] it a different way
[15:04] because if you keep cutting it that way
[15:07] it's not going to yield the same result
[15:10] and so the word of god is a sharp knife
[15:12] and knows
[15:13] this is how you treat the soul this is
[15:15] how you treat the spirit
[15:17] that the same word the same knife has a
[15:19] way of treating different parts of our
[15:21] being
[15:21] for the benefit and the wholeness and
[15:24] the completion
[15:25] of these parts of our bodies so it
[15:26] divides asunder of soul and spirit
[15:28] and of the joints and morrow and is a
[15:30] discerner of the thoughts
[15:32] and intents of the heart so we have now
[15:35] soul spirit and then even a reference to
[15:38] joints and marrow
[15:39] so you have body spirit soul all within
[15:41] one person
[15:43] the body now these are things that i
[15:44] know you're um
[15:46] you you understand these things but i'm
[15:48] wanting just to bring them into the
[15:49] picture
[15:50] as we view it and paint it today the
[15:52] body has five senses
[15:54] and we would see taste smell touch
[15:57] and hear and these would be the five
[15:59] senses of the natural body
[16:01] that help us to understand the natural
[16:03] world around us
[16:05] in terms of spatial dimension and smells
[16:07] and sight and feelings and those things
[16:10] the physical part but then as the bible
[16:13] says it divides us under
[16:14] of the spirit and paul's writing saying
[16:16] that you be your whole spirit be
[16:18] preserved blameless the spirit which is
[16:20] your mind
[16:21] we know that that's a separate entity
[16:23] from your fingers that touch
[16:25] your ears that hear your eyes that see
[16:29] your nose that smells this is a
[16:30] different sense
[16:32] and in that spirit there's different
[16:34] channels or different senses of
[16:36] imagination
[16:37] memory reason affection and conscience
[16:42] these are five and these are this is
[16:43] just a way you can say oh there's more
[16:45] there's more well
[16:46] absolutely there's probably a way that
[16:47] you could begin to break these things
[16:49] and divide
[16:50] these things up to describe more
[16:52] completely the body
[16:54] and the spirit but these are just ways
[16:55] to quickly grasp and understand
[16:58] that there's ways that our physical body
[17:00] contacts things and knows that they're
[17:02] there
[17:03] i can see something i know that it's
[17:04] there i touch something i know that it's
[17:06] there i smell something i know that it's
[17:07] there
[17:08] these are different ways i taste
[17:09] something i know what it is even if i
[17:10] have my eyes closed and can't smell it
[17:13] so these are different ways to contact
[17:14] physical things and then within our
[17:16] spirits we know that even though we
[17:18] don't see something we can imagine it
[17:21] and even though that we and and we may
[17:23] not be touching something but we can
[17:25] have an affection for it
[17:26] and so there's different aspects to our
[17:28] spirits of imagination
[17:29] memory reason affection and also within
[17:33] this
[17:33] mind or spirit there's a conscience
[17:36] this is just the human person that we're
[17:38] talking about
[17:39] and we could call these things channels
[17:42] so it's something that passes through
[17:44] this
[17:45] and another way of thinking about it's a
[17:46] chamber within our spirits there's
[17:48] chambers
[17:49] so there's things that are stored
[17:50] there's things that can be recalled in
[17:52] our imagination and our
[17:54] our memory and our affection and our
[17:55] reason and then
[17:57] deep down on the inside of the inside is
[18:00] if you even took the temple of the outer
[18:01] court the inner court and the holiest of
[18:03] holies you could see kind of this
[18:04] blueprint of the person body spirit soul
[18:07] so in the soul that's the holiest of
[18:09] holies
[18:10] that is uh within the deepest part of
[18:12] the man and
[18:14] it is the nature of the spirit so before
[18:17] you're born again you can say that in
[18:18] there wrestles doubt in faith
[18:20] you got a dove seed and you've got a
[18:22] serpent nature and what the baptism of
[18:24] the holy ghost does the new birth kills
[18:26] out the any unbelief
[18:28] and seals the soul with a dove nature
[18:32] way down within your soul now i guess in
[18:34] some ways it would be really really nice
[18:36] if all sudden
[18:37] bodies gone spirits gone and all we
[18:38] become is soul beings
[18:40] and kind of existed in this soul realm
[18:42] and that's kind of how oh you made it
[18:44] welcome soul brother and uh and you're
[18:47] all you're happy but there's
[18:48] your soul is born again and sealed but
[18:51] you still got this spirit
[18:52] that remembers things you still have a
[18:55] body that gets sick
[18:56] and achy and this is what the scripture
[18:58] is identifying
[19:00] but within that soul there is that which
[19:02] is the nature of our spirit
[19:05] when you're born again then there's a
[19:06] nature of christ that lives on the
[19:08] inside of you
[19:09] and then the only sense for that is
[19:11] faith
[19:12] and it only feeds on the word
[19:16] so when your soul is born again it has
[19:18] one sense faith
[19:19] and the only thing that can feed that is
[19:21] the word
[19:22] but in your spirit you've got memory and
[19:25] you can feed that with spotify
[19:28] right and in your in your in your spirit
[19:31] you have affection you can feed that
[19:33] with netflix
[19:34] there's a lot of there's things in our
[19:36] spirit that have different channels
[19:37] different ways of input
[19:38] and so the spirit can begin to get a
[19:40] little bit more robust and maybe a
[19:41] little bit more excited a little bit
[19:42] more deterred and
[19:43] moved and what you need is a word to
[19:46] feed your soul
[19:47] so the word could come over there and
[19:49] take that imagination and shake it a
[19:50] little bit
[19:51] and get it in line and so our sense is
[19:55] faith and the stimulus the only stimulus
[19:57] to our soul is the word
[20:00] now the this triune being this
[20:03] body which we see spirit which were we
[20:05] use in our emotional realm
[20:07] and the soul it all this person exists
[20:10] within dimensions and again this is just
[20:12] a simplistic way to ponder
[20:14] how we are existing exist within light
[20:16] time and matter
[20:19] we exist within time because you're
[20:20] already thinking brother aaron's been
[20:21] preaching so long
[20:22] uh it's light because it's what gives us
[20:24] the distinction of the things around us
[20:26] and that's all things are comprised of
[20:28] matter maybe a little bit over
[20:30] simplistic
[20:31] but it's just a way to identify the
[20:33] dimensions that we live in within time
[20:36] with light in matter and these things
[20:39] light time and matter make up the
[20:40] natural world that we live in
[20:43] so we live in a realm of dimensions we
[20:45] live in light time and matter
[20:47] and then our body and spirit exist fully
[20:50] within that natural realm
[20:52] right your body and your spirit exist
[20:54] within light time and matter
[20:56] the soul can be raised already seated in
[20:59] heavenly places in christ jesus
[21:01] so it has a representation in eternity
[21:03] it's actually
[21:04] not tethered to anything that takes a
[21:06] place around here it is our but it is
[21:08] our body and our spirits our souls
[21:10] existing deep within us
[21:11] but our body and our spirits exist
[21:13] completely within this natural realm
[21:16] and the senses of the body and the
[21:17] senses of the spirit allow us to live
[21:20] in this physical world if you had no
[21:23] physical sense and you had no emotional
[21:25] awareness
[21:26] you wouldn't be existing in this world
[21:28] you may have you may have a heartbeat
[21:30] you may have a breath
[21:31] you could be artificially kept alive but
[21:34] it's these senses of the body and the
[21:36] senses of our spirit
[21:37] that allow us to live in and move within
[21:40] the physical world
[21:42] we learn we understand we move we
[21:44] interact
[21:45] in the natural world through the senses
[21:47] of our body and spirit
[21:50] amen there and that was an easy one
[21:54] but then again if there's a debate we
[21:56] can talk about it we could talk about
[21:58] whether or not it's actually we may all
[22:00] be brains in a vat right
[22:02] isn't that one of the philosophical
[22:03] arguments we're really not here you're
[22:05] just a brain in a bowl somewhere
[22:08] with a bunch of wires hooked up to it
[22:10] and they're running the church program
[22:12] this morning so guess what
[22:13] you feel like you're in church but
[22:15] you're really a brain in a bowl
[22:18] just having the experience of going to
[22:20] church
[22:24] now just a few scriptures to
[22:27] highlight some of these uh the emphasis
[22:30] in the word about spirit and and
[22:32] and body in proverbs 18 14 this is a
[22:35] very
[22:36] a precious scripture to me it says the
[22:39] spirit of a man will sustain
[22:40] his infirmity this is actually
[22:44] identifying the relationship between the
[22:46] body and the spirit
[22:48] and saying that a man's spirit
[22:52] can lift up and strengthen a man's
[22:56] weak body so this would be to any person
[22:59] this is
[22:59] this is how a mom when she's sick she
[23:01] gets up in the morning the kids get
[23:03] dressed and stuff gets done
[23:04] right it's her spirit that allows her
[23:08] to pick her body up and move through the
[23:11] pain and push past the pain
[23:12] and get things done that need to get
[23:14] done now if the dad is sick enough
[23:16] and has an excuse he's going to lay in
[23:18] bed and rest a little while
[23:20] but the man still has the ability and
[23:22] this is how you see men
[23:24] who ache and are sore and and maybe even
[23:27] have really really bad
[23:28] uh physical conditions but their spirit
[23:31] picks them up they put their boots on
[23:33] and they go to work and they work their
[23:35] 60 hours a week not because their body's
[23:37] strong enough
[23:38] but this motivation this and this this
[23:40] passion this desire
[23:42] the spirit will pick up a weak body and
[23:45] move them and motivate them to get the
[23:46] job done
[23:48] so it's identified how the spirit holds
[23:50] a very
[23:51] strong position with the within the
[23:53] nature of a person that the body can be
[23:55] broken but an unbroken spirit
[23:57] can actually lift it up ate it and mend
[23:59] it in a sense
[24:01] right until such a time the body is made
[24:04] well
[24:05] and they've even or there's they're
[24:06] documenting this to some degree with
[24:08] even certain individuals how that just
[24:10] the mental
[24:11] uh discipline can actually regulate body
[24:14] temperature
[24:15] or endure very difficult things and it's
[24:18] not just a function of a dial on the
[24:20] wrist you know look at this body
[24:21] modification i put a thermostat here and
[24:23] i can just move it around
[24:24] it's something in your mind that they're
[24:25] able to do and the scriptures
[24:27] identifying a relationship
[24:28] between the spirit and the body and this
[24:31] is the one
[24:32] that is very enlightening it says but a
[24:33] wounded spirit who can bear
[24:36] it's asking the question of when the
[24:39] body's broken when the body's wounded
[24:41] your spirit's what helps you through it
[24:43] actually a a positive attitude and even
[24:46] the
[24:48] i'm not really wanting to get into this
[24:49] effect but the placebo effect
[24:51] really is a function of the spirit being
[24:54] confident that you took something that's
[24:56] going to remedy
[24:56] your physical ailment and guess what
[24:58] happens the element gets remedied
[25:00] like they took nothing more than water
[25:02] why because the spirit
[25:04] has a very unique function within the
[25:06] body but wound the spirit
[25:08] and the body can't re in reverse
[25:11] men the spirit a well body cannot reach
[25:14] into the spirit and say i'll pick you up
[25:16] when you're down
[25:17] the body when it's when it's wounded it
[25:19] relies upon the spirit
[25:20] when the spirit gets broken what does
[25:22] the body do it hangs down too
[25:24] and it looks at the spirit and says oh
[25:26] i'm well but i'm unable and
[25:28] i'm right there with you i i if you're
[25:30] not motivated i'm not motivated i can't
[25:32] get you out of bed i have health i have
[25:34] strength but
[25:35] if you're broken i can't move
[25:39] in proverbs chapter 14 verse 10
[25:42] it says the heart knoweth his own
[25:44] bitterness
[25:45] and a stranger does not intermedal with
[25:48] his joy
[25:49] it's speaking of the inward griefs and
[25:51] inward joys of our heart
[25:53] they're not known anyone else but
[25:55] ourselves
[25:57] and so a person is aware and conscious
[26:00] of
[26:00] his personal feelings the heart knows
[26:03] its own bitterness
[26:05] it's aware of its its harms its wounds
[26:07] its anxieties its fears
[26:10] and a stranger someone else is not
[26:12] actually
[26:13] able to experience your feelings
[26:18] now they can have their own feeling of
[26:19] happiness
[26:21] they can have their own feeling of joy
[26:24] but they cannot it's just it's just
[26:25] there's something very unique about your
[26:27] feelings something very unique about
[26:28] your emotions something very unique
[26:30] about what you're experiencing
[26:31] and only your heart knows your own
[26:33] bitterness it's only known to you
[26:36] it's not known to anyone else and
[26:38] somebody else does not cannot really
[26:40] know truly how you're feeling
[26:42] and again this scripture is identifying
[26:44] a relationship even among our feelings
[26:47] that now that you see as the body and
[26:49] the spirit relate now within the spirit
[26:51] realm there can be a consciousness
[26:53] of a feeling of pain and you know your
[26:55] bitterness and you know about this and
[26:57] there's a
[26:57] now a relationship and an interaction
[27:00] among our feelings
[27:02] within our spirit
[27:05] maybe a way just to help you to
[27:07] understand the point that i'm trying to
[27:09] make
[27:10] that when it comes to tasting food
[27:15] it's remarkable just how much smell
[27:17] plays a part in that
[27:19] all right maybe it's not as remarkable
[27:21] to some of us who smelt some pretty foul
[27:23] food before
[27:24] and weren't willing to taste it but it
[27:27] all it plays a part
[27:28] it's not just the taste it's texture and
[27:31] the smell
[27:32] and then even to the point to where if
[27:33] it's plated correctly and
[27:35] even the color foods they use a lot of
[27:36] food coloring because they say if you
[27:38] serve that the way it looks naturally
[27:40] the mind's going to tell you don't eat
[27:42] that gray stuff
[27:43] right that doesn't look natural and so
[27:46] there's these all of our senses with it
[27:47] with respect to the body
[27:49] have this interplay and interaction it's
[27:51] the same within our spirit
[27:53] our memory our reason and affection and
[27:55] i i have to skip now
[27:58] and make this connection now without uh
[27:59] belaboring this point our memory our
[28:01] reason
[28:02] our affection and imagination they work
[28:04] all work independently
[28:07] and they work even independently or can
[28:09] they can be a channel or a chamber or be
[28:11] sensitized
[28:12] apart from our conscience so these
[28:16] other chambers because they can move and
[28:18] they can be influenced and they can have
[28:20] data input
[28:21] they can weaken or cloud our conscience
[28:25] the heart knows its own bitterness so
[28:27] bitterness and these disconcerting
[28:29] feelings and these different things
[28:30] can now begin to influence your
[28:32] conscience or i can say this way there
[28:34] can be a conflict between your
[28:36] conscience
[28:38] and your emoting emotions
[28:42] and and so i i i i need to i need to
[28:45] press i need to press further so a clean
[28:47] conscience
[28:50] is the function of aligning our spirits
[28:52] with our souls
[28:55] so despite the presence of other
[28:57] negative emotions despite the presence
[28:59] of disconcerting feelings and
[29:01] i have bitterness and i have anxiety and
[29:03] i have this memory and i have this
[29:04] affection and i'm reasoning and i'm
[29:06] doubting over here
[29:07] the the to bring harmony with a person
[29:10] isn't necessary to say well you don't
[29:11] have to be sad anymore you don't have to
[29:13] do this you don't have to do that
[29:14] it's taken by conscience and aligning
[29:17] all these things so that they're in
[29:19] harmony with god's word
[29:21] even to the point where i'm very
[29:23] sorrowful and your conscience tells you
[29:24] jesus was a man of sorrow acquainted
[29:26] with grief
[29:26] and it takes whatever sorrow that is and
[29:28] it aligns it
[29:30] and if there's some memory that tells
[29:32] you that haunts you say you know what
[29:34] the blood of jesus christ is forgive me
[29:35] of all sins
[29:36] and it aligns it if there's some reason
[29:38] you say well you know what
[29:40] i'm not sure lord i believe help thou my
[29:43] unbelief and there's a way that you
[29:44] begin to take different things
[29:45] and you begin to line it up correctly
[29:48] the bible says in first timothy chapter
[29:50] 1 verse 19
[29:52] notice it says holding faith we hold
[29:54] faith and a good conscience
[29:57] so there's something this faith which
[29:59] exists within the soul by virtue of
[30:00] being born again i have a renewed faith
[30:02] i have a sealed faith
[30:03] it says and a good conscience well this
[30:06] relates to the person
[30:07] your spirit and your mind you want to
[30:09] hold to your faith with a good
[30:11] conscience
[30:11] says which some having put away
[30:13] concerning faith have made shipwreck
[30:15] they put aside their faith therefore
[30:16] they they are fallen first timothy
[30:18] chapter 3 verse 9
[30:20] holding the mystery of the faith in a
[30:23] pure conscience
[30:24] well that's a that's a real deep deep
[30:27] statement
[30:28] so it's a there's a there's a mystery to
[30:30] faith there's a mysterious element to
[30:32] faith
[30:32] if you're not quite sure what it's
[30:34] talking about just tell somebody what
[30:35] you believe sometime by revelation
[30:38] and that look on their faith face that's
[30:40] the mystery
[30:41] right they're like what because they
[30:43] don't understand how could you believe
[30:44] that where do you see that you're like
[30:46] well it's just right here in the bible
[30:48] and and that's the mystery of your faith
[30:51] there's an element that's
[30:52] hidden until it's revealed to you but it
[30:54] says it's held in a
[30:55] pure conscience now there there could be
[30:58] an
[30:59] application of this will refer to the
[31:00] soul awareness and this man on the
[31:02] inside of the man
[31:04] that's deep down inside there this pure
[31:06] mind of christ deep down within our
[31:07] souls
[31:08] and you say well that's your pure
[31:09] conscience but you have the faith of god
[31:11] which is in your soul
[31:13] but now the bible wants us to also have
[31:15] a spirit that's clean
[31:18] a clean spirit so it says holding the
[31:21] mystery of the faith in a
[31:22] pure conscience this is how conscience
[31:24] now is going to
[31:25] interact and relate to a pure soul
[31:29] now titus chapter 1 verse 15. so it took
[31:31] me a little bit but now
[31:33] i'm wanting to use a very specific
[31:34] subject
[31:36] uh as an example of what we're talking
[31:39] about of a
[31:40] clean conscience and and how that works
[31:43] with even a born-again soul
[31:46] in titus chapter 1 verse 15 it says unto
[31:49] the pure
[31:50] all things are pure but unto them that
[31:53] are defiled
[31:54] and unbelieving that kind of helps us
[31:56] understand who he's talking about now
[31:57] when he says pure
[31:59] he says unto them that are defiled and
[32:01] unbelieving is nothing pure nothing is
[32:03] pure to those who are defiled and
[32:04] unbelieving
[32:05] but even their mind and conscience is
[32:08] defiled now he says under the purity
[32:11] talk about the born again
[32:12] under the pure the christian those who
[32:14] are christians all things are pure
[32:16] now if we had time we could back up and
[32:18] we could look at how that paul is
[32:20] referring to jewish fables
[32:22] and so he's saying that talking about
[32:23] jewish fables and the the jewish fables
[32:25] he's referring to
[32:27] are the regulation of food and
[32:29] purification
[32:31] there's certain things related to the
[32:32] jewish faith and certain things related
[32:34] to judaism
[32:35] that are trying to be mixed and blended
[32:36] in with your christianity and somehow
[32:38] don't be
[32:39] these jewish fables and he's referring
[32:40] to how food was regulated the
[32:42] purification of food
[32:43] and even the purification of things and
[32:46] so he's saying
[32:47] essentially that it's not food that
[32:48] makes one impure
[32:50] not the food that's going to make you
[32:52] impure because to the pure
[32:53] all things are pure but when one is
[32:55] unbelieving and defiled
[32:57] no food can make him pure see this is
[33:00] kind of the point in the emphasis that's
[33:01] being made
[33:03] that if you're pure all things are pure
[33:05] but if you're undefiled eating food's
[33:07] not going to purify you
[33:09] if it doesn't matter what you eat that's
[33:11] not going to accomplish purification
[33:14] and so it's talking about how a defiled
[33:16] mind
[33:17] and conscience causes a person to be in
[33:21] air no matter regardless of what they're
[33:23] doing with a defiled mind and defiled
[33:25] conscience
[33:26] they're constantly in airing and
[33:30] the way if you read this more holy and
[33:31] as i go into maybe the next uh
[33:33] the next scripture these are the things
[33:35] that paul is trying to bring out that
[33:36] every man
[33:38] and we remember remember now the
[33:40] difference with perception and how
[33:41] perception forms your own reality
[33:44] but doesn't necessarily mean that's
[33:45] what's true or what is paul is showing
[33:47] that every person is kind of a creator
[33:50] of their own world and that they um
[33:53] they walk in a universe of their own
[33:55] creation it's informed by senses and
[33:57] their spirit their interpretation of
[33:59] these things
[33:59] so the mind creates a world of itself
[34:02] this is the way things are
[34:03] this is the way things are going to be
[34:05] and if that being the case
[34:06] even as we've read already that the the
[34:08] heart knows its own bitterness and
[34:10] another man can't necessarily
[34:11] inter-meddle with it and
[34:13] get in there and actually feel what a
[34:15] person is feeling they can be
[34:16] sympathetic
[34:18] and even empathetic but not know truly
[34:20] exactly what that individual is feeling
[34:23] and so as a person creates a world into
[34:25] themselves the visible world can
[34:27] present itself differently to each
[34:29] person
[34:31] you're saying and if we have to even use
[34:34] just the natural
[34:35] attitude today of how where brother joel
[34:38] has a front row seat
[34:39] he's seeing things from a different
[34:41] vantage point than somebody who's
[34:43] sitting at the back
[34:44] and so based upon where you are you're
[34:46] going to see things
[34:48] differently and so every person the
[34:50] world presents
[34:51] itself differently to every individual
[34:53] so he says unto
[34:54] the pure all things are pure those
[34:57] who've had their soul renewed by the
[34:59] word and their heart purified by faith
[35:01] to the genuine christian
[35:04] to the food proper food
[35:08] which they for nourishment is pure like
[35:10] if you're eating something that's for
[35:11] food and for nourishment
[35:12] it is pure it's lawful to a christian
[35:16] someone whose soul has been born again
[35:17] if food is properly for nutrition
[35:19] and you eat this for nutrition then it
[35:21] can be eaten without doubt
[35:24] can be eaten without hesitancy it can be
[35:26] eaten without guilt
[35:28] and so paul is saying the distinction of
[35:30] the old testament law is being removed
[35:32] then in the old testament law there had
[35:34] been a distinction among the meats and
[35:35] different things
[35:36] that if you ate it there would be this
[35:37] offense but now with the distinction of
[35:39] the old testament law being removed
[35:41] one can eat without the food with the
[35:44] without the food having some sort of
[35:46] weight of immorality
[35:48] you know if that eat you eat that you're
[35:49] sinning against god right
[35:51] you know some people try to make us feel
[35:53] guilty when we're wanting to eat like
[35:54] you know how many calories isn't that
[35:55] don't you
[35:56] and for the sake of a clear conscience i
[35:58] don't want to know
[36:00] right you know they should make uh
[36:04] uh labels uh voluntary like don't show
[36:07] me a label
[36:09] have a label section in the grocery
[36:10] store for those who want to read labels
[36:13] i identify as labelers and i want to be
[36:15] able to have a section in the store
[36:17] where i don't know how many calories are
[36:18] in it
[36:19] that way if as long as my this is a good
[36:22] point to be picking up on because this
[36:23] is exactly what paul's saying
[36:25] that with that distinction removed you
[36:27] can eat without guilt
[36:28] isn't that what they call some of these
[36:29] calorie-free things guilt-free chocolate
[36:35] and so the conscience then paul was
[36:38] saying the conscience should not be
[36:39] burdened
[36:41] the country should not be enslaved by
[36:43] the things which have no moral character
[36:47] if you eat meat it's meat
[36:52] amen father's day yeah red meat
[36:55] medium rare rare rare plus blue
[36:58] just cut off its horns wipe its nose and
[37:01] send it out
[37:03] that's how i want my meat right he said
[37:06] if you eat meat eat meat
[37:08] you should not be burned you should not
[37:10] have your conscience now
[37:12] weighing you down and cause you to feel
[37:14] as if you sinned
[37:15] and you're defiled because you're eating
[37:17] catfish
[37:19] so these distinctions have been removed
[37:21] these things have no moral character
[37:23] themselves
[37:24] by doing it it is not righteous by not
[37:25] doing it it is not a sin
[37:27] whatever these distinctions are they've
[37:28] been removed so therefore the conscience
[37:30] shot ought to be
[37:32] released so he's saying unto the defiled
[37:35] or the unconverted
[37:36] those who still have a dark soul and a
[37:38] polluted mind
[37:39] their mind is contaminated with impure
[37:42] things
[37:44] therefore their conscience is defiled
[37:46] and guilty
[37:47] and so when he's using this when he says
[37:50] the very statement here their mind and
[37:51] conscience is defiled he's describing
[37:53] the intellectual side of a person
[37:55] and even the ethical or moral side of a
[37:56] person their conscience what's right
[37:58] what's wrong
[37:58] how do i behave how do i act he's saying
[38:01] both of them are stained
[38:02] that's what defile means it's polluted
[38:05] and so the mind observes the form of
[38:08] things
[38:09] i'm beholding a piece of meat and then
[38:12] the conscience draws conclusions
[38:14] and then explanations for it i see meat
[38:17] this is red meat and then it and then
[38:19] it's informed that this is
[38:20] you know this is a corn-fed beef i'm
[38:22] gonna get myself in trouble now
[38:24] and the conscious tells you you
[38:25] shouldn't do that it's gonna kill you
[38:26] within four days
[38:28] right and this is how the mind then
[38:30] draws these interpretations and these
[38:32] conclusions
[38:33] he said if both are defiled then
[38:37] if the mind and the conscience are
[38:39] defiled
[38:41] then what character does the do your
[38:43] thoughts have
[38:45] what character do your words have
[38:49] what's the character of your actions if
[38:51] your mind and conscience are defiled
[38:53] then everything you do is defiled
[38:56] it doesn't matter what you do it doesn't
[38:57] matter what you abstain from it doesn't
[38:59] matter what you touch taste
[39:00] smell or hear all of it is send to you
[39:04] with a defiled mind and a defiled
[39:05] conscience so paul it's just amazing how
[39:08] in one statement he just
[39:09] very succinctly declares that purity
[39:12] consists
[39:13] in mind and conscience in not on the
[39:15] external things alone
[39:18] that this purity exists within the mind
[39:20] the purity exists within the conscience
[39:22] and not external worship and external
[39:24] elements and washing this and
[39:26] abstaining from that that it's something
[39:28] it's a condition of mind it's a
[39:29] condition of conscience
[39:31] and now catch this if you kind of say
[39:33] well you kind of lost me on corn-fed
[39:34] beef there brother aaron
[39:35] if i've lost you in the last you know 10
[39:37] minutes
[39:38] just recognize this part the word is
[39:41] actually addressing
[39:43] mechanisms that burden our conscience
[39:47] very specific here very specific here
[39:50] but notice how
[39:51] paul believe it or not is taking time to
[39:54] talk to the believers about what they
[39:55] eat
[39:56] why not because a moment on the lips is
[39:59] a lifetime on the hips
[40:00] he's doing it because of their minds
[40:04] he's doing it because of something in
[40:06] their spirits the word is actually
[40:08] addressing things that burden our
[40:09] conscience and it does it in order to
[40:12] free our conscience
[40:13] so that we can have pure minds and a
[40:14] pure conscience to serve god perfectly
[40:18] it's not even related to the nutritional
[40:19] value
[40:21] and the next chapter paul's not debating
[40:23] the merits about whether or not red meat
[40:24] reduces inflammation
[40:26] right it's not the natural benefit
[40:29] it's him addressing something that had
[40:32] worked its way into the church and was
[40:34] causing people's minds to be burdened
[40:36] and he was wanting them to be liberated
[40:38] in their conscience
[40:40] so that's the point i want to make the
[40:41] word wants to liberate your conscience
[40:44] if we could just leave the meat issue
[40:46] alone in terms of what what does this
[40:48] mean for us today brother aaron what it
[40:49] means for us today
[40:51] is the word is actually addressing
[40:52] something that hindered people's
[40:54] conscience
[40:56] so in first corinthians chapter 8 verse
[40:58] 7 and i'd like to read
[41:00] all of what our text was it says howbeit
[41:04] there is not ever in every man that
[41:06] knowledge
[41:07] now what he's referring to is in verse
[41:09] four it talks about how
[41:11] eating things that are sacrificed to
[41:13] idols he says we know that an idol is
[41:15] nothing in the world paul saying we know
[41:19] that there's nothing to an idol right
[41:22] there's nothing to this and and he's
[41:25] taking something that might have been
[41:26] really really big right people have been
[41:27] really really fanatical and let's start
[41:29] a movement against this and let's all
[41:30] get caught up in this
[41:31] and paul said there's nothing to this
[41:34] nothing to it at all to even where later
[41:36] in romans he's saying hey if if he even
[41:38] invites you over to his house to eat
[41:41] eat what's served to you don't ask what
[41:43] farm it's from
[41:45] right he says don't ask just eat it
[41:50] and maybe that's teaching us good
[41:51] manners but it's also saying don't ask a
[41:53] bunch of questions that once you find
[41:55] out where it comes from
[41:56] it offends your conscience
[42:00] and it causes you some consternation and
[42:02] some some difficulty
[42:04] and so hey you know i don't need to go
[42:05] into some department store and say
[42:08] i have you guys guys file the 10k i want
[42:10] to know what you're uh where you stand
[42:11] on pride month i want to know what your
[42:13] policies are with respect to
[42:15] um to this and um did the ceo vote for
[42:17] decriminalization of marijuana and what
[42:19] what's their platform you know i just
[42:20] need to go in and get a hammer and leave
[42:22] right and not burden myself with whether
[42:26] or not the two cent margin on the hammer
[42:29] is going to go to change some boy to a
[42:30] girl hey
[42:34] he's saying let's not have our
[42:35] conscience burdened by these things
[42:39] so says that some do not have this
[42:42] knowledge that an idol is nothing it
[42:44] means nothing there's no there's no
[42:45] implication to the soul in this
[42:48] for some with conscience of the idols
[42:50] very very
[42:51] specific here but then the
[42:52] generalizations i want to pull from this
[42:54] remain true for some with conscience of
[42:57] the idol into this
[42:58] hour eat it as a thing offered unto an
[43:01] idol
[43:01] and their conscience being weak is
[43:04] defiled
[43:05] that's established this is what this is
[43:08] this is true
[43:09] paul is not preaching teaching this to
[43:11] the unsaved
[43:13] paul is not talking about the heathen
[43:15] he's not talking about the jew hasn't
[43:16] been converted he's not talking about
[43:17] the sinner
[43:18] he's talking about born again christians
[43:21] okay that's his audience and he's saying
[43:23] some christians lack
[43:24] full knowledge that there's no power or
[43:27] no life
[43:28] in an idol
[43:31] and if it's hard for you to understand
[43:32] this you talk about gentiles who fell
[43:34] down on their face
[43:35] and worshiped idols and offered things
[43:38] to idols and spoiled things to idols
[43:40] and they actually believed i mean think
[43:41] about the links that gentiles went to
[43:44] to bury kings and and pharaohs with
[43:46] things that they could
[43:47] use and enjoy in the afterlife thinking
[43:50] in their minds that there was some way
[43:52] that they articulate with these things
[43:53] there's some life and power in it so
[43:55] when a person is converted
[43:57] and they had a duplicity of dog dogs
[44:00] yeah they
[44:00] dog worshipers and isn't that what a
[44:02] dyslexic insomniac
[44:04] agnostic does they lay awake at night
[44:06] wondering if there's a dog
[44:09] there they had multiple gods with
[44:11] multiple powers and multiple
[44:13] uh ways of worship so whenever they
[44:15] converted to the one true god
[44:17] they could still have some idea that
[44:19] this is the bestest of all the gods
[44:21] right but yet there's still some power
[44:24] and influence
[44:24] in these gods they're not the true gods
[44:27] these are false gods
[44:28] and so there could still be some
[44:30] influence to these idols in these images
[44:33] and he's saying that a christian without
[44:35] the full knowledge that there's no power
[44:37] there's no life
[44:38] there's no influence in these dead idols
[44:41] with that in their mind with conscience
[44:43] it says of idol
[44:45] what is it old associations a
[44:47] misdirected conscience
[44:50] with this lingering idea it impacts the
[44:53] conscience
[44:55] so some former idol worshipers may still
[44:57] hold to the belief
[44:59] that some meats differed from others
[45:02] because of the relationship to an idol
[45:06] can we can we accept that that's that's
[45:08] how paul is outlining this he's saying
[45:10] that
[45:10] here's some meats that have been offered
[45:12] to some idol you having never been an
[45:14] idol worshiper no there's no difference
[45:18] there is no difference than what's being
[45:19] sold at target versus being what sold at
[45:21] walmart
[45:22] except the vip points you get at target
[45:24] or whatever
[45:25] or maybe the label sometimes we're
[45:26] buying something that targets something
[45:28] at walmart that's just a white label
[45:29] product at the same place as
[45:30] manufacturing
[45:32] no difference and so some can one can
[45:34] have the knowledge hey you can get that
[45:35] it's the same thing as this
[45:36] right and but then there's someone else
[45:39] who doesn't know
[45:40] right don't know all i know is that
[45:43] target at one time was supporting gender
[45:45] neutral bathrooms and so i never want to
[45:47] shop at target again
[45:48] because there's that's going to be power
[45:50] to the antichrist and i want to shop at
[45:52] walmart
[45:53] right the whole concept of a
[45:56] gender-neutral bathroom should not
[45:57] stumble on any of us right
[45:59] isn't that what we have at our house
[46:06] let's just not get distracted that's my
[46:07] point
[46:10] and so now paul is saying that someone
[46:12] else who
[46:13] has never worshipped idols we're going
[46:15] to is going to look at that
[46:17] and think differently but somebody who
[46:18] did worship idols is going to
[46:20] immediately ascribe
[46:21] something different to that meat because
[46:24] their conscience
[46:26] okay and again i'm not trying to make a
[46:28] big deal about meat
[46:30] i think i know what i'm doing for
[46:31] father's day
[46:36] micah can you make me a reservation at
[46:37] fleming's for two o'clock please thank
[46:40] you
[46:42] their conscience being weak he says
[46:44] could be defiled
[46:45] it was vulnerable some sort of
[46:48] exploitable part of their conscience
[46:50] could be polluted again the word they're
[46:51] stained
[46:52] it could be a weak conscience then in
[46:55] this area this vulnerability
[46:57] could be defiled if they act against
[46:59] that
[47:01] so they believe that the idols had an
[47:03] influence on the food that's offered up
[47:05] to it
[47:07] making it unclean therefore in their
[47:09] minds they believed that it should not
[47:11] be eaten
[47:13] and believing that it should not be
[47:14] eaten to eat it would burden them
[47:16] i'm just trying to explain what the
[47:17] scripture is saying and taking some time
[47:19] to do it
[47:20] because i feel like i can actually use a
[47:22] harmless example as a way to get us
[47:24] thinking before we look at where this
[47:26] really counts
[47:28] so even though their conscience may be
[47:29] weak it's binding
[47:32] that interesting even though it may be a
[47:34] weak conscience that had the ability to
[47:36] to take them and bind them and then if
[47:39] offended it clouds and pollutes their
[47:41] spirits
[47:43] so oh well that's just a weak he's just
[47:45] has a weak conscience but a weak
[47:46] conscience if offended has the power to
[47:48] take the whole person and bind it
[47:51] paul writes in romans chapter 14 verse
[47:53] 14 i know and am persuaded by the lord
[47:55] jesus
[47:56] that there is nothing unclean of itself
[47:59] but to him that esteemeth anything to be
[48:01] unclean to him it is
[48:03] unclean so this is where
[48:06] this is where even you could say well
[48:08] brother aaron that scripture rebukes you
[48:10] when you're a little bit flip it
[48:11] flip it about a gender neutral bathroom
[48:13] and i say absolutely
[48:15] if it offends somebody it offends them
[48:19] and we wouldn't need to be very
[48:20] sarcastic or demeaning and upset about
[48:23] it
[48:23] that if he's making the point that if a
[48:25] man esteems something believes something
[48:27] to be unclean
[48:28] to him it is right because he lives
[48:31] within the world of his creation
[48:32] the world presents itself differently to
[48:34] this person this is why some people can
[48:36] do something
[48:37] and they do they're not burdened in
[48:39] their conscience but somebody else
[48:41] themselves they cannot do it because
[48:42] they know
[48:43] too much
[48:46] that's why some people can do things go
[48:48] places even some people can go to
[48:50] uh have relationships with certain
[48:51] people some people can even be benefited
[48:53] by certain ministries
[48:55] because they don't know certain things
[48:57] others can know certain things very
[48:59] specific things
[49:00] and not that they think there's no
[49:01] ministry or not that they think evil if
[49:03] somebody's like well i know that and it
[49:05] i can't get over that part it could be
[49:07] something very personal
[49:09] there's nothing unclean of itself but
[49:10] it's the person's esteeming that makes
[49:12] it unclean
[49:15] if you were unconscious that the meat
[49:16] was offered to idols he's saying there'd
[49:18] be no defilement of conscience
[49:21] if you were unconscious of it but being
[49:24] conscious
[49:24] and without better knowledge so you're
[49:26] conscious and you're aware without
[49:28] better knowledge that there's really
[49:29] there's nothing unclean in itself eating
[49:32] causes them to sin
[49:34] against their conscience those are the
[49:36] dynamics
[49:39] so i'd like to just i'd like to just
[49:40] read verses 8 to 13 completely and then
[49:42] and maybe back up and go back over there
[49:44] so we can see how paul
[49:46] is sensitive to a person's conscience
[49:50] because really if there's no moral
[49:52] character in it he's going to say if
[49:53] there's no moral character in it
[49:56] and doing it would actually offend your
[49:58] brother's conscience
[49:59] maybe you shouldn't do it
[50:02] very very very simple commandment he
[50:04] says but meat commendeth
[50:06] us not to god a meat's not going to
[50:08] prove your disapproving before god for
[50:10] neither if we eat
[50:11] are we the better neither if we eat not
[50:13] are we the worst neither eating or
[50:15] eating meat approves us or disapproves
[50:17] us
[50:17] before god amen
[50:21] vegans and carnivores alike we can all
[50:23] say
[50:24] amen isn't that awesome then it doesn't
[50:27] matter if you
[50:28] if you like soy burgers it doesn't
[50:29] matter if you like you know 80 20 blend
[50:31] in your burger it doesn't matter to god
[50:34] so he says but take heed lest by any
[50:37] means this
[50:38] liberty of yours become a stumbling
[50:40] block to them that are weak
[50:42] for if any man see thee which has
[50:44] knowledge sit at me in the idol's temple
[50:47] before you try to make it
[50:48] you know religious that you have a
[50:49] preference when it comes to certain
[50:51] foods
[50:52] there's a specific tie into religion and
[50:54] in faith
[50:56] and purification and righteousness that
[50:58] paul is alluding to
[50:59] so this this doesn't won't translate
[51:02] over right
[51:03] so that we have our keto camp in the
[51:05] church and you're the more spiritual and
[51:07] the more pure
[51:08] and more in harmony with god this isn't
[51:12] creating counts based upon nutrition
[51:13] these
[51:13] these ideals have been torn down and
[51:15] don't should not exist within our
[51:17] christianity
[51:18] but again the generalization is dealing
[51:20] with the way man feels
[51:22] his thoughts if you sit at me in the
[51:25] idol's table
[51:26] shall not the conscience of him which is
[51:28] weak be emboldened
[51:30] to eat those things which are offered to
[51:32] idols your example what you are doing
[51:34] now gives occasion to them who would are
[51:36] weak in their conscience to think oh
[51:38] well if he's doing it then maybe i
[51:40] should and through thy knowledge shall
[51:42] the weak brother perish
[51:44] for whom and i love how paul wants to
[51:46] remind us for whom christ died
[51:49] this just isn't some dude who hates meat
[51:51] this is the son of god
[51:54] that and christ died for him and your
[51:56] attitude in the way that you're acting
[51:58] about something
[51:59] is creating a situation to where they're
[52:01] emboldened to do something that causes
[52:03] him to perish in
[52:04] and christ died for him but when ye sin
[52:07] so against the brethren so the offense
[52:10] is not necessarily a transgression of
[52:11] god's word
[52:12] he's saying you've sinned against the
[52:13] brother and
[52:15] wound to disquiet it means to disquiet
[52:18] one's conscience to
[52:20] smite them with the heaviness or weight
[52:22] and you wound their weak conscience it
[52:24] already being weak now it's smitten or
[52:25] wounded he says you actually sin against
[52:27] christ
[52:28] not in transgressing his word but in
[52:31] wounding his daughter
[52:32] not in transgressing the commandment of
[52:34] the of the word of god but in
[52:36] offending his son man that's powerful
[52:39] he says wherefore if meat make my
[52:41] brother to offend i will
[52:43] eat no flesh while the world standeth
[52:45] lest i make my brother to
[52:46] offend what a integrity on paul's part
[52:51] when someone with doubt in mind eats
[52:53] against his conscience he says it
[52:55] destroys his peace they're smitten
[52:57] in their weak conscience and those with
[53:00] more
[53:00] knowledge is actually alluding it to a
[53:02] liberty
[53:03] ought to give great care that they don't
[53:05] stumble the weaker
[53:08] so it's a very beautiful principle that
[53:09] i'm i'm not giving enough due
[53:11] time this morning but this is what i
[53:14] want you to see
[53:15] paul is freeing the conscience
[53:19] irrespective of the subject matter okay
[53:22] i want you to recognize that he could
[53:23] have been using something else
[53:25] but he's taking great going to great
[53:27] lengths
[53:29] in titus in romans and corinthians
[53:33] to free the conscience he's wanting to
[53:36] clean the conscience of guilt he's
[53:38] wanting to liberate it from the weight
[53:39] of heaviness he's wanting to take a
[53:40] smitten conscience
[53:42] and and soothe it and heal it and mend
[53:44] it
[53:46] so he's telling this is be something
[53:47] that we we ought to recognize
[53:49] paul is saying that the believer's
[53:51] conscience can become unclean
[53:54] they're in christ they're christ's seed
[53:56] that's how they can be offended
[53:58] and that offense against them is offense
[53:59] against christ but he's saying that a
[54:01] believer's conscience can become
[54:03] unclean so a clean conscience is a free
[54:06] conscience
[54:08] and he's identifying that god cares and
[54:11] is concerned
[54:12] about your conscience because as we
[54:16] already looked at in the scripture
[54:17] and i hope that this part can become
[54:18] more clear there's something about
[54:20] cleaning our conscience that relates to
[54:22] the perfection of our being
[54:25] and and the robustness of our faith and
[54:27] the liberty that we have to walk in his
[54:29] truth
[54:30] god wants to liberate our conscience so
[54:32] that we can be completely free to serve
[54:34] him
[54:35] without fear an unclean or defiled
[54:38] conscience keeps us from the confidence
[54:40] that we need to release perfect faith
[54:45] we've got a faith in our souls that
[54:46] wants to just burst
[54:48] out to a point to change this
[54:51] and there's things that are standing in
[54:53] the way of it and so the word
[54:55] not being able to do any more to perfect
[54:57] your soul
[54:58] since it's already perfect is going to
[55:00] preach and preach
[55:01] and preach to your hearts and minds to
[55:04] the point where you can in your spirits
[55:06] have complete and absolute confidence to
[55:09] release the perfect faith that's inside
[55:11] your souls
[55:13] and that's why the word is preached the
[55:14] word is preached and then subsequently
[55:16] revealed to the individual
[55:18] in order to liberate and free your
[55:19] conscience my soul has been sealed
[55:21] by the preaching of the word and the
[55:23] confession of my faith and the baptism
[55:26] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[55:27] the baptism of the holy ghost to seal my
[55:29] soul into kingdom
[55:30] that's what the word accomplished for my
[55:32] soul now the
[55:34] word continually preached and
[55:36] subsequently revealed to my spirit
[55:38] where my heart releases me of any guilt
[55:41] and condemnation
[55:43] and it's cleansing and liberating my
[55:45] conscience
[55:47] and so first corinthians chapter 8
[55:48] teaches us
[55:50] now this is where i'm not
[55:54] now this is the that's the foundation
[55:59] this is a foundation in in a specific
[56:02] area
[56:04] to make a point that was the very
[56:07] the the the inspiration for the
[56:11] entire this subject of pure joy
[56:14] and i'm so grateful that i'm able to
[56:16] come to it to this morning
[56:17] because it just seemed like it was
[56:18] getting further and further away
[56:22] but first corinthians 8 is showing us
[56:24] that things that are not true
[56:27] that there could be a life or influence
[56:29] to an idol
[56:31] conduct can defile a believer's
[56:33] conscience
[56:35] it cannot defile his soul but not having
[56:39] full knowledge
[56:40] something in the partaking of it or
[56:44] in some element of it it can defile a
[56:47] believer's conscience
[56:48] so understand not the soul but his
[56:50] spirit
[56:52] and what the scripture is showing us and
[56:55] we could use other examples but it's
[56:56] just so clear to me and perfectly placed
[56:59] we can be influenced by certain ideas
[57:02] we can be influenced by memories and
[57:04] associations
[57:06] that we can we're influenced by our
[57:07] consciousness of certain feelings
[57:10] it influences us so this is what first
[57:13] corinthians chapter 8 is telling us
[57:15] that there's things known things unknown
[57:20] things in our minds and our spirits
[57:22] whether true or not true
[57:24] that can burden our conscience and the
[57:28] word is willing to say hey
[57:31] that should not burden your conscience
[57:34] you're free from it because if it was
[57:36] burning your conscience
[57:39] and there was a remedy in the word the
[57:40] word would show us you feel that way
[57:42] because you've done wrong make it right
[57:46] and so if the word was saying you
[57:47] shouldn't have eaten that so stop eating
[57:48] it repent and move on
[57:50] that's how the conscience is going to be
[57:51] unburdened but actually the word comes
[57:53] and says instead of saying you know what
[57:54] why don't we just all go
[57:56] in on these jewish rules as it relates
[57:58] to the purification of foods
[58:00] and just establish the standard and just
[58:02] abide by that to remove any confusion
[58:04] paul is saying no
[58:05] no no no no no let's not invent
[58:08] something as a remedy to this situation
[58:10] let's expose it for what it is and call
[58:12] it out there's nothing to it
[58:16] for the purpose of what not so much
[58:18] telling the
[58:19] the the the person who was making it in
[58:21] the issue to be quiet
[58:22] but to liberate the person who was being
[58:24] smitten by it
[58:26] he cared enough to release the
[58:28] conscience of his son or daughter
[58:30] he cared enough to clean that to purify
[58:33] and liberate it
[58:37] praise the lord so now let's just think
[58:40] of ourselves
[58:41] as we were not formerly jews nor were we
[58:44] formerly heathens necessarily for
[58:46] some of us or idol worshipers
[58:51] but we're all sinners
[58:55] we all have a past
[58:59] and in the message mighty god unveiled
[59:03] statement is one time there was a boy he
[59:06] got in some trouble he was a good boy
[59:07] but he went to court
[59:09] and the judge says i find you guilty i
[59:11] must punish you to life
[59:12] in prison so we could we could come to
[59:15] the conclusion that
[59:16] there had been an obvious uh
[59:19] offense and activity to the point to
[59:21] where beyond a reasonable doubt this
[59:23] judge could find
[59:24] that the person was guilty that their
[59:26] the evidence indicated guilt for these
[59:28] actions
[59:29] so brother graham says i that he says
[59:31] and the boy said i want to try my own
[59:33] case
[59:35] i want to go in upon my record
[59:38] now i think it's just marvelous that
[59:41] that he's going to try to make the point
[59:42] like let's put ourselves in his shoes
[59:44] right
[59:45] and the boy has just committed a crime
[59:49] and and he's gonna he's facing life in
[59:51] prison and he says i want to go
[59:53] in upon my record and the judge says you
[59:55] have no record
[59:57] your record is what condemned you
[1:00:00] like you're trying to go in on your
[1:00:02] actions you're here because of your
[1:00:04] actions
[1:00:06] you you can't you can't refer to your
[1:00:08] past
[1:00:09] as the evidence of your lack of guilt
[1:00:12] it's your past that condemns you it's
[1:00:13] what you did that condemns you
[1:00:15] you don't even have a record to go on
[1:00:18] but then he says and there's a
[1:00:19] that's the way it is today the reason
[1:00:21] the church is not advanced
[1:00:22] like it should it's the record
[1:00:26] and then he says it's the lie
[1:00:30] here's a boy who was in fact guilty and
[1:00:33] was wanting to go on his own record
[1:00:36] and he says that's the problem with the
[1:00:38] church today
[1:00:40] they're wanting to go on their own
[1:00:42] record
[1:00:44] church history works all these whatever
[1:00:46] it might be what their record but then
[1:00:47] he says it's the lie
[1:00:50] because the boy in his mind might have
[1:00:51] been thinking i'm a good boy i've got a
[1:00:54] decent record but
[1:00:56] all it took was a mistake to sully the
[1:00:58] whole record
[1:01:01] and so we could say well i want to go in
[1:01:02] my own record brother says well
[1:01:05] the record actually condemns you but
[1:01:07] then he says it's the lie it's such a
[1:01:10] powerful statement
[1:01:11] so he says we must become more dedicated
[1:01:14] we must become we must believe
[1:01:18] every word of god we must seek him until
[1:01:22] that word is made real to us
[1:01:25] the record is what keeps us from
[1:01:27] entering in
[1:01:29] so he said there's something we must
[1:01:30] seek
[1:01:32] and it's the record that's holding us
[1:01:33] back there's something that we must do
[1:01:36] there's something we must be desirous of
[1:01:38] we must seek his word until it's real we
[1:01:40] must believe every word we must become
[1:01:42] more dedicated
[1:01:43] but the record and the lie hinders us
[1:01:46] from becoming more dedicated it hinders
[1:01:48] us from believing every word
[1:01:50] it hinders it from it becoming
[1:01:52] personally real to us
[1:01:55] keeps us from entering in it's your
[1:01:57] record that condemns you
[1:02:00] just as one eating meat a sacrifice to
[1:02:02] idols who had
[1:02:03] conscience of idols it offended his
[1:02:06] consciousness
[1:02:07] your your his conscience your
[1:02:09] consciousness of your past
[1:02:12] and even your present troubles your
[1:02:14] hearts
[1:02:18] and notice how it isn't the record alone
[1:02:20] wherein you observe the record
[1:02:23] that holds us back but it's the lie in
[1:02:25] other words the conclusions draw from it
[1:02:29] so you can observe the record and say
[1:02:31] well the record's very clear but what's
[1:02:32] your interpretation of the record
[1:02:34] remember the difference between
[1:02:35] observation and explanation
[1:02:38] and that where the the problem often
[1:02:40] lies is not in the observation but the
[1:02:42] interpretation the explanation
[1:02:46] so then paul in first corinthians
[1:02:47] chapter eight was using the present
[1:02:49] truth the further revealed truth
[1:02:52] to deal with people who are coming out
[1:02:54] of a former age a former ideology a
[1:02:56] former way of thinking
[1:02:57] he was using a presently revealed truth
[1:03:00] to tear down
[1:03:01] anything that would hold the believer
[1:03:03] back from fully entering into peace and
[1:03:06] relationship with jesus christ
[1:03:08] he said this is the these are the facts
[1:03:10] these are the issues these are the
[1:03:11] things now you may look at it and say
[1:03:12] well i observe this and i observe that
[1:03:14] but where you're wrong
[1:03:16] is not in the record maybe it is in fact
[1:03:19] offered to idols but the truth is
[1:03:22] there's nothing to an
[1:03:23] idol and the conclusion he's drawing
[1:03:27] is that you're not any more unclean
[1:03:29] before god by having eating it
[1:03:31] then you are pure before god by not
[1:03:33] eating it
[1:03:35] and this is for the sake of releasing
[1:03:37] somebody using the present truth
[1:03:39] to bring them out of what was holding
[1:03:41] them back
[1:03:43] and let me say this the source of the
[1:03:46] believer's pure joy
[1:03:47] isn't found in god fulfilling his
[1:03:50] promised word to us
[1:03:53] like what he's promised to us the source
[1:03:55] of the bride's joy
[1:03:56] is found in god bringing to pass his
[1:03:59] promise
[1:03:59] to us in this time and in this day
[1:04:03] now in in the remaining moments that we
[1:04:05] have together
[1:04:07] i i'd like to i'd like to just do this
[1:04:09] very quickly if i could
[1:04:14] with and i hope that you're able to hold
[1:04:16] these things
[1:04:18] in your in your mind all these different
[1:04:20] principles because they were
[1:04:22] they're just building blocks and and
[1:04:24] principles that we're wanting to build
[1:04:25] upon
[1:04:27] now in revelations chapter 3 behold i
[1:04:30] stand at the door knock
[1:04:33] and it's an invitation to the bride to
[1:04:35] open up
[1:04:36] and then there's an entrance there's a
[1:04:37] door opened in heaven
[1:04:40] and and john is raised up a little
[1:04:43] higher this is the believer's invitation
[1:04:44] in this hour
[1:04:45] that we're brought up we're wraps it up
[1:04:47] quickly to meet the word for this day
[1:04:49] and we're lifted above these things now
[1:04:51] chapter 4
[1:04:52] is setting the scene for the throne in
[1:04:54] heaven
[1:04:55] in revelations chapter 5 there is a book
[1:04:57] that is sealed in the right hand of him
[1:04:59] that sits upon the throne
[1:05:01] and and the statement is essentially
[1:05:03] made or the question is asked who's
[1:05:04] worthy to open the book
[1:05:06] no one being found worthy it says in
[1:05:08] verse 4 john's saying i wept much
[1:05:12] this is a converted born-again sealed
[1:05:14] filled son of god
[1:05:15] who's already seen a lot through the
[1:05:17] first few chapters
[1:05:18] right he's had a lot to witness i mean
[1:05:21] he ought not to be questioning
[1:05:24] his experience and his standing he has
[1:05:26] just through
[1:05:27] three chapters seeing the future
[1:05:30] the rest of the church in its existence
[1:05:33] and he's been brought up
[1:05:34] into heaven into heaven to see a scene
[1:05:37] in heaven
[1:05:39] and then all it took is for someone to
[1:05:40] say nobody's worthy to open the book
[1:05:41] john starts bawling and crying
[1:05:44] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:05:45] the book and to read the book neither to
[1:05:47] look thereon
[1:05:50] what happened it wasn't his soul that
[1:05:53] was broken
[1:05:54] but something in john's conscience was
[1:05:56] wounded
[1:05:58] something disturbed his rest something
[1:06:00] began to disturb his peace
[1:06:03] now we understand that this book
[1:06:07] had it remain closed
[1:06:11] then the reality that begins to dawn
[1:06:13] upon john is he's like look
[1:06:15] i know that the lamb purchased my
[1:06:18] redemption
[1:06:20] and i know that i have been baptized
[1:06:22] with the holy ghost i am his son
[1:06:26] but there's something contained in this
[1:06:28] book in this scene that he as he sees it
[1:06:31] and john when he looks at this he's he's
[1:06:34] thinking
[1:06:35] if this is sealed then all i have is my
[1:06:39] testimony
[1:06:41] if this is sealed then all i have is my
[1:06:43] record
[1:06:45] if this book remains closed then all
[1:06:46] they can do is open up these other books
[1:06:48] and judge me by it
[1:06:50] because in revelations chapter 20 verse
[1:06:51] 12 i saw the dead small and great stand
[1:06:53] before god and the books were opened
[1:06:55] and another book was opened which is the
[1:06:57] book of life and the dead were judged
[1:06:59] out of those things which were written
[1:07:01] in the books
[1:07:01] according to their works john know
[1:07:04] there's going to be books open one day
[1:07:06] that aren't necessarily sealed
[1:07:07] these are the books of works these are
[1:07:08] the books that judge all men that had
[1:07:10] natural life
[1:07:11] and they're going to be judged not
[1:07:12] according to the work of the lamb
[1:07:15] this is not those in the lamb's book of
[1:07:17] life this is a record of life
[1:07:19] that has all natural life and they're
[1:07:20] going to be judged
[1:07:22] by their works
[1:07:27] so when john is what is he told oh don't
[1:07:30] cry
[1:07:31] don't cry you you you
[1:07:34] you're missing something here he says
[1:07:36] the lamb hath prevailed
[1:07:38] or the lion of judah hath prevailed
[1:07:41] the line of judah have prevailed to take
[1:07:43] the book and loose the seals thereof so
[1:07:44] john's weeping but now
[1:07:46] there's been a prevailing in the interim
[1:07:48] and something was happening it wasn't
[1:07:49] just merely a rhetorical question it
[1:07:51] caused something to happen
[1:07:53] it was the impetus to something
[1:07:54] happening this book being taken now
[1:07:56] and the seals loosed and john says he
[1:07:58] turns to look
[1:07:59] look expecting to see a line and what
[1:08:01] did he see the lamb which had purchased
[1:08:03] his redemption
[1:08:04] so now he sees the blood connected with
[1:08:06] the taking of this book
[1:08:08] and then we know that when the seals are
[1:08:10] open what does brother branham teach us
[1:08:12] he says john must have what seen himself
[1:08:17] john saw something in that record john
[1:08:19] saw something in that book
[1:08:22] and it changed a man who in verse 4 was
[1:08:24] crying and weeping
[1:08:26] tree says in verse 13 every creature
[1:08:28] which is in heaven and on earth and
[1:08:29] under the earth and such as are in the
[1:08:30] sea
[1:08:31] and all that are in them heard i saying
[1:08:34] blessing and honor and glory and power
[1:08:36] be into him that sitteth upon the throne
[1:08:39] and unto the lamb forever and ever
[1:08:42] because what did john see not his own
[1:08:44] natural life
[1:08:46] not even his own passion his own
[1:08:47] experiences but he saw his true self in
[1:08:50] the book of life
[1:08:51] he saw it written in permanent ink he
[1:08:53] saw it written and read
[1:08:54] he saw it written in a way that it could
[1:08:56] never be removed and by him now having
[1:08:59] that further
[1:09:00] vindication it transformed weeping into
[1:09:03] joy
[1:09:05] though he was the son of god there was
[1:09:07] still a weakness in his conscience
[1:09:09] that until that book was taken john
[1:09:12] could still
[1:09:13] be defiled but once the lion of the
[1:09:15] tribe of judah had prevailed
[1:09:17] and opened the truth of that book it
[1:09:20] released something to that
[1:09:22] individual where once he had fellowship
[1:09:24] with it
[1:09:25] once it became real to him it took that
[1:09:28] part of his mind
[1:09:29] that was weak or wounded or vulnerable
[1:09:31] and it changed it and transformed it and
[1:09:33] now john could scream and worship so
[1:09:35] loud he says anybody in the sea
[1:09:37] anyone on the earth whatever creatures
[1:09:39] existed heard me saying
[1:09:40] blessing honor glory rejoicing power
[1:09:46] and brother branham says this and a
[1:09:49] question and answer is part three
[1:09:53] but now this picture is the main thing
[1:09:57] i'm wanting you to connect victory ahead
[1:09:59] is victory now
[1:10:01] remember this that then in the
[1:10:03] resurrection those gases and acids and
[1:10:05] things come right back
[1:10:07] into the place and develops this picture
[1:10:09] again
[1:10:11] so this body that is going to be
[1:10:13] glorified
[1:10:14] picked up even as he would say by the
[1:10:16] theophany
[1:10:18] this picture he says was not taken when
[1:10:21] you were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at
[1:10:23] your best
[1:10:26] now it gets better when was it taken
[1:10:29] before there was a foundation of the
[1:10:31] world it was put in god's great file
[1:10:35] so he took a picture of you he put it in
[1:10:38] his record
[1:10:40] so you have the a record of natural life
[1:10:42] but then you have a record of the lamb's
[1:10:44] book of life
[1:10:45] you have a record from which names can
[1:10:46] be removed then you have another record
[1:10:48] which can names can never be removed
[1:10:50] and saying we have we have very deep
[1:10:52] intimacy with the record of the wheat
[1:10:53] plant and our natural lives right
[1:10:56] memory reason affection conscience these
[1:10:58] different things
[1:10:59] uh they they're so aware our imagination
[1:11:01] is so we're so conscious of it it's a
[1:11:03] different record
[1:11:05] but now there's a picture put in god's
[1:11:07] photo album in god's file
[1:11:10] he said the only thing it did was
[1:11:11] feature yourself
[1:11:13] it was featured here for you to make
[1:11:15] your choice so now there's a
[1:11:16] representation on earth you've made your
[1:11:17] choice
[1:11:18] then you become a servant of god him for
[1:11:20] knowing it makes him a redeemer
[1:11:22] and we've been through it the negative
[1:11:25] part of life
[1:11:26] is where you're living now hey man
[1:11:30] the negative part of life is where you
[1:11:32] are living now
[1:11:33] in anything if there's a negative
[1:11:35] there's got to be a positive
[1:11:37] before there can be a negative and if
[1:11:40] there's a negative there's got to be a
[1:11:41] positive before there can be a negative
[1:11:43] therefore
[1:11:43] if this is a negative there's got to be
[1:11:47] a positive somewhere
[1:11:49] it's got to be inverted we're looking at
[1:11:52] life in a negative and the colors don't
[1:11:54] make sense and things don't seem to be
[1:11:56] sharp
[1:11:56] and it might seem to be a little bit
[1:11:58] spooky but the life you're living now is
[1:12:00] negative but if there's a negative here
[1:12:04] there's a positive somewhere he says
[1:12:06] that this ain't the real thing
[1:12:08] this is only a fourth shadow of the real
[1:12:09] thing that is to come
[1:12:11] he says now you got it now i i hope this
[1:12:14] is the part that you can truly catch
[1:12:16] i don't care what they would do with you
[1:12:20] they cannot destroy that profile
[1:12:24] that picture in god's great gallery up
[1:12:26] there
[1:12:28] now it may seem to uh to to narrowly
[1:12:30] relate to what could
[1:12:32] be done to this body but i want you to
[1:12:34] think about what could be done to this
[1:12:36] body what could be done to this spirit
[1:12:39] because god wants to preserve you wholly
[1:12:41] and he's saying look they could wet it
[1:12:43] he's going to make the point there's
[1:12:45] nothing they can do to this body to keep
[1:12:46] you from coming up
[1:12:47] but there's nothing that could be done
[1:12:50] in this negative
[1:12:52] there's nothing you've done since birth
[1:12:55] that can
[1:12:56] change the picture in god's great file
[1:13:00] you don't experience a hurt here you
[1:13:01] don't make a mistake here
[1:13:03] and somehow that impinges and ruins and
[1:13:06] mars the picture in god's file
[1:13:08] no he took the picture before you made a
[1:13:10] mistake so that it would be blameless
[1:13:13] so it would be pure so that it would be
[1:13:15] a record that one day could be used to
[1:13:18] defend you
[1:13:20] because you couldn't go on your own
[1:13:22] record but you could go on his
[1:13:25] hallelujah think about it it's not even
[1:13:27] his testimony well
[1:13:28] he's the the blood of jesus christ was
[1:13:32] sinless no he's got a record of you
[1:13:35] he's got a record of you i don't care
[1:13:37] what they would do with you
[1:13:39] it cannot destroy the profile that
[1:13:41] picture in god's great gallery up there
[1:13:43] it cannot destroy it it's in heaven
[1:13:48] you could burn it up feed it to the
[1:13:50] lions do anything you want to it
[1:13:51] it'll come forth again just as sure as
[1:13:53] the two twos is four
[1:13:55] just as sure as god spoke it it'll come
[1:13:58] forth
[1:14:00] i think about that
[1:14:04] this is the word of god meeting us
[1:14:08] in our guilty conscience this is the
[1:14:11] word of god
[1:14:12] trying to address things that exist that
[1:14:15] linger that harm that impact
[1:14:17] that bring us down just as paul was
[1:14:19] taking something as we emphasized was a
[1:14:22] lie
[1:14:22] and not true now the word of god when
[1:14:26] the book is taken and open it reveals
[1:14:28] what you're perfect
[1:14:31] we've got to accept it because the fact
[1:14:35] that you're not perfect
[1:14:36] is actually a lie because that's just
[1:14:40] the negative
[1:14:41] there's a positive that's perfect and
[1:14:44] the only problem is is they're watching
[1:14:46] you in the development process
[1:14:48] and in the development process there's
[1:14:50] moments where that doesn't look good
[1:14:51] that seems really really dark that
[1:14:52] doesn't make any sense just wait till
[1:14:54] he's finished it's going to be perfect
[1:14:56] just wait till he's finished it's going
[1:14:58] to be perfect
[1:15:00] and so there's a there's a what i'm
[1:15:03] wanting to
[1:15:04] let me just say it again a clean
[1:15:07] conscience is a liberated conscience
[1:15:10] that our souls if you haven't been born
[1:15:12] again all
[1:15:14] i implore you to repent i implore you to
[1:15:17] accept jesus christ
[1:15:18] there is only one god there is only one
[1:15:22] truth and
[1:15:24] a man is brought into this world as a
[1:15:26] sinner and he must acknowledge himself
[1:15:28] and rected himself as a sinner
[1:15:30] and realize that as a as a man i was
[1:15:32] born into this world by sin
[1:15:34] and he must repent of his sins be
[1:15:36] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[1:15:37] he must call upon god to be sealed
[1:15:39] and be saved by the baptism of the holy
[1:15:42] ghost sealed into the kingdom of god
[1:15:44] that's going to do something for your
[1:15:45] soul if you have not experienced that
[1:15:48] and implore you
[1:15:49] to yield to that and to give into that
[1:15:51] and to accept that
[1:15:53] but let me just say something to the
[1:15:54] devil that's trying to hold you back
[1:15:57] he can't touch your soul so he tries to
[1:15:59] meddle in your conscience
[1:16:01] he has a medal in your mind meddle with
[1:16:02] your memories meddle with your
[1:16:04] imagination
[1:16:05] and it's really a cruel thing that the
[1:16:06] world does to us and really at worst
[1:16:08] what we do to ourselves
[1:16:14] but if god has something in a file
[1:16:18] wouldn't it help you to see it
[1:16:22] if he if he had a record and and your
[1:16:25] spirit's telling you all sorts of things
[1:16:28] and brother bran said the reason why the
[1:16:29] church can't progress because it's the
[1:16:30] record
[1:16:32] and the record the lie the record's
[1:16:34] trying to tell
[1:16:36] not merely just the record because we
[1:16:39] could agree to
[1:16:40] facts there's even in in litigation
[1:16:42] there's
[1:16:43] there's ways in which you can agree on a
[1:16:45] set of facts
[1:16:46] and all the parties agree but you still
[1:16:48] have to go forward and figure out what
[1:16:50] the facts mean
[1:16:51] what does it represent at the end of the
[1:16:52] day what is it what is it that's gonna
[1:16:54] what is it that's gonna um impact
[1:16:58] the uh we can all agree on the set of
[1:17:02] facts
[1:17:03] but we have a different we form our own
[1:17:05] views we have our own opinions we're
[1:17:06] informed from different things
[1:17:07] it's in the explanation interpretation
[1:17:09] of it
[1:17:11] and so god has something in his file
[1:17:15] vindicate us let's look at deuteronomy
[1:17:19] chapter 22
[1:17:21] let me read something
[1:17:28] and i want you to see yourself portrayed
[1:17:30] here in type
[1:17:33] in deuteronomy chapter 22 verses 13 to
[1:17:35] 17 you'll have to just be
[1:17:37] um real mature with me now as we read
[1:17:40] this
[1:17:42] if any man take a wife and go in unto
[1:17:45] her
[1:17:45] and hate her then subsequently hate her
[1:17:48] so married the marriage is consummated
[1:17:50] but then he turns against her
[1:17:52] and give occasions of speech against her
[1:17:54] so now he's
[1:17:55] accusing her and through the accusations
[1:17:58] brings up an evil name upon her
[1:18:00] and says i took this woman and when i
[1:18:03] came to her i found her not a maid
[1:18:07] so do you understand what's being
[1:18:08] alleged here what the accusation is
[1:18:11] i married her and i found out she
[1:18:13] basically she'd been married before
[1:18:16] that she was no longer she was not a
[1:18:17] maid now this
[1:18:19] is it says an evil name it's occasions
[1:18:22] of speech against her
[1:18:24] now here's a man accusing a woman
[1:18:28] and the woman is not
[1:18:31] is not asked what do you say
[1:18:35] notice what happens then shall the
[1:18:37] father of the damsel
[1:18:40] and her mother take and bring forth the
[1:18:43] tokens
[1:18:44] of the damsel's virginity under the
[1:18:46] elders of the city
[1:18:47] in the gate and what was this this was
[1:18:51] something
[1:18:52] that was given to the man and the woman
[1:18:53] that they would take with him
[1:18:55] when he went in unto her and it would be
[1:18:57] there in the bedroom as it were
[1:18:59] and then after the marriage is
[1:19:00] consummated it's given to the father for
[1:19:02] him to keep
[1:19:04] so he keeps this and it says and the
[1:19:06] damsel's father shall
[1:19:08] say unto the elders i gave my daughter
[1:19:10] unto this man to wife and he hated her
[1:19:13] and lol have given occasions of speech
[1:19:15] against her saying
[1:19:16] i found not thy daughter a maid and yet
[1:19:19] these
[1:19:20] are the tokens of her purity
[1:19:23] this is the evidence of her innocence
[1:19:26] these are the tokens of my daughter's
[1:19:28] morality her integrity her perfectness
[1:19:32] her wholeness this is the token of my
[1:19:34] daughter's virginity
[1:19:35] and they shall unfold or spread out or
[1:19:38] unroll the cloth
[1:19:39] before the city and as they do it the
[1:19:42] blood is a testimony
[1:19:44] against the lies of her first husband
[1:19:47] and so i want to see yourself portrayed
[1:19:49] in type here
[1:19:50] her husband of the flesh the husband of
[1:19:52] her flesh
[1:19:53] took her innocence
[1:19:56] and so it's her flesh even as they say
[1:19:58] well they're one flesher joining
[1:20:00] it's her flesh that condemns her
[1:20:03] and the very man that's accusing her is
[1:20:06] the one that had defiled her
[1:20:08] so if she stands there she doesn't have
[1:20:10] any evidence
[1:20:11] she doesn't have any proof she has no
[1:20:13] defense
[1:20:15] she has no testimony she has no standing
[1:20:17] to defend herself
[1:20:18] so she stands there she may have this
[1:20:21] sense well i'm innocent
[1:20:23] and i'm free but she's overwhelmed with
[1:20:25] the sense of guilt and fear
[1:20:27] for the consequences of the lie
[1:20:34] she stood there they're not even asking
[1:20:35] was it true is it true she just stands
[1:20:37] there
[1:20:37] feeling condemned her own flesh
[1:20:41] condemning her
[1:20:42] her mind condemning her feeling trapped
[1:20:45] feeling the weight feeling the burden
[1:20:46] feeling
[1:20:47] the fear there was only one thing that
[1:20:50] could expose the lie
[1:20:52] there was only one thing admissible as
[1:20:54] this is the law that's being unfurled
[1:20:57] there's only one thing her father
[1:21:01] her father held the record of her purity
[1:21:04] so she stood there she only had one hope
[1:21:07] that her father would show up
[1:21:09] she only had one hope that the one who
[1:21:11] had the token the one that had the proof
[1:21:13] the one that had the file
[1:21:14] the one that had the evidence could come
[1:21:17] and defend her
[1:21:18] i want you to see yourself portrayed and
[1:21:20] type here your first husband is dead
[1:21:23] i want you to even see how your flesh
[1:21:24] condemns you condemned in the flesh
[1:21:27] but her father had the token of her
[1:21:29] innocence
[1:21:30] and it was a token of her innocence that
[1:21:32] would vindicate her it was the token of
[1:21:34] her innocence that would release
[1:21:36] any condemnation let me say this to the
[1:21:38] fathers on
[1:21:39] on father's day fathers you are the
[1:21:41] keepers of your family's purity
[1:21:44] you are the keepers of your family's
[1:21:46] virtue you are the protectors
[1:21:47] and the defenders of your family purity
[1:21:50] that is what we're called to do as
[1:21:51] fathers as a father
[1:21:52] i am a keeper of my family's virtue as a
[1:21:55] father i am the protector
[1:21:57] and the defender of my family's purity
[1:22:00] that's what this father represented in
[1:22:01] deuteronomy chapter 22
[1:22:03] he had a go he had a an office he had a
[1:22:06] responsibility
[1:22:07] though it seemed as if he had given her
[1:22:08] away and she had married a man
[1:22:10] and in this marriage falling apart oh it
[1:22:12] would seem as if she was ruined
[1:22:14] he still had a responsibility to her
[1:22:17] why because he had in his possession
[1:22:19] something that would free her
[1:22:21] and vindicate her and set her free
[1:22:25] and this is exactly what we could say we
[1:22:27] see in revelations chapter 5
[1:22:29] when john sits there weeping he's
[1:22:31] condemned in the presence of what
[1:22:32] in the presence of the elders he has to
[1:22:35] go on his record
[1:22:36] he has to go on a lie he feels condemned
[1:22:38] he doesn't know what to do i know my
[1:22:40] sins have been forgiven
[1:22:41] i know the lamb paid the price but
[1:22:43] unless that book is opened
[1:22:44] i fall short of the fullness of
[1:22:46] redemption but our scenario we see in
[1:22:48] this very image
[1:22:49] that there in the hand of the father he
[1:22:52] held the token of our innocence
[1:22:56] and what happens in revelations chapter
[1:22:58] five you know the book was not a book
[1:23:00] like this
[1:23:02] but it was a scroll and could you
[1:23:05] imagine the token
[1:23:07] this cloth rolled up and held in the
[1:23:10] bosom of the father
[1:23:12] for the day that he would need it and
[1:23:14] now a book is sealed a scroll
[1:23:17] and in revelations chapter 5 the lamb
[1:23:19] unfolds the scroll
[1:23:21] and lays it out in the presence of the
[1:23:22] elders for our justification
[1:23:27] this is the source of pure joy
[1:23:32] the bible says he shall appear to your
[1:23:34] joy
[1:23:37] do you know what the very last words of
[1:23:38] the church age book are
[1:23:41] in may his coming rejoice your heart
[1:23:45] this is the source of the believer's joy
[1:23:48] not what the world can give but it's
[1:23:52] what
[1:23:52] christ has done for us
[1:23:56] musicians if he could come let me just
[1:23:59] try to provoke
[1:24:00] one last thought in this way
[1:24:09] if you were charged
[1:24:12] with the crime you didn't commit we
[1:24:15] could say on one hand
[1:24:19] there is a sense of i didn't do it i
[1:24:20] didn't do it i didn't do anything wrong
[1:24:24] but we know and we've seen it happen
[1:24:26] time and time again where people who are
[1:24:28] innocent of crimes can be coerced and
[1:24:30] admitted to them and confessing to
[1:24:32] things they never did
[1:24:34] and that's why there are certain rules
[1:24:35] and laws in place to uh
[1:24:37] to protect those who are accused but
[1:24:40] innocent until proven guilty
[1:24:42] so that they don't give a an admission
[1:24:43] to something and under coercion or
[1:24:45] duress
[1:24:46] admit to things and and say things but
[1:24:49] if you did something
[1:24:51] and you know you were innocent
[1:24:55] but yet you're facing trial
[1:25:00] how easy would it be to rest
[1:25:03] before the trial is over
[1:25:07] we could look at the criminal justice
[1:25:08] system be like well mistakes are made
[1:25:11] innocent people are put to death
[1:25:14] what if somebody lies and i said i
[1:25:17] didn't do it i wasn't there somebody
[1:25:18] else says yes they were
[1:25:19] they were there we saw it so you have
[1:25:23] you don't necessarily have a guilty
[1:25:24] conscience
[1:25:26] but now you have a weakened conscience
[1:25:28] to say i know i didn't do it
[1:25:31] but what if i'm what if something
[1:25:33] happens and they find me guilty
[1:25:36] and that scenario you would not rest
[1:25:39] fully
[1:25:41] you would not be able to experience
[1:25:44] the the benefit of innocence
[1:25:47] until the sentence until the judgment
[1:25:49] came
[1:25:51] right not until the time that the judge
[1:25:54] would say or the the jury would say we
[1:25:56] find the defendant
[1:25:58] not guilty even though you knew on one
[1:26:01] hand you were innocent
[1:26:03] you were still waiting for the final
[1:26:04] adjudication you were waiting for the
[1:26:06] judge to declare
[1:26:07] you're waiting for the jury to declare
[1:26:09] to say i find him
[1:26:10] not guilty and then that would be yes
[1:26:13] yes i knew it all along this is what i
[1:26:15] believe this is what i stood for
[1:26:17] this is what i confessed i told you i
[1:26:19] was innocent
[1:26:20] then any threat of punishment is
[1:26:21] released
[1:26:23] i i meant to reach out to brother mario
[1:26:25] chua this past week to ask him about it
[1:26:27] because he shared at one time a very
[1:26:29] similar experience where he had been
[1:26:31] wrongly accused
[1:26:32] of a crime and he testifies that he was
[1:26:35] though he knew he was innocent he lived
[1:26:38] under the weight of the charge
[1:26:40] he lived under the weight of the
[1:26:41] indictment he lived under the weight of
[1:26:43] the trial
[1:26:44] thinking i know i'm innocent but what is
[1:26:46] the judge going to say in the end
[1:26:49] because at the end of the day that's
[1:26:50] whose opinion matters
[1:26:52] after the day it's the final judgment
[1:26:54] that's what's going to prove everything
[1:26:55] and vindicate everything
[1:26:56] and i thought oh my if that's not the
[1:26:59] exact state of those of us
[1:27:00] we believe in our innocence we've
[1:27:02] accepted the blood of jesus christ
[1:27:04] we we've heard that we have not done it
[1:27:06] in the first place but listen
[1:27:07] what this message represents to the
[1:27:10] bride is not
[1:27:11] merely the scripture telling us by faith
[1:27:13] to believe it and accept it
[1:27:15] but this word opens up to us the
[1:27:18] unfolding
[1:27:19] of the book that says you never did it
[1:27:22] in the first place and it's a
[1:27:25] declaration of the wig when the
[1:27:27] righteous judge said
[1:27:29] that now is the time of your freeing
[1:27:32] now is the time of your liberation now
[1:27:35] is the moment when i judicially declare
[1:27:37] that you are perfect that you are pure
[1:27:40] to do
[1:27:41] do what cash down any doubt cast down
[1:27:43] any reason
[1:27:44] cast down any thought that would oppose
[1:27:46] the word of god
[1:27:49] and it invites us then
[1:27:53] to take the pure the pure record
[1:27:57] and eat it that's where your pure joy is
[1:28:01] only by eating this word can our
[1:28:05] conscience be fully clean that's where
[1:28:08] you'll find your joy
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:11] this is paul wrestles with the truth
[1:28:15] that there's nothing to an idol
[1:28:18] and he took time with a corinthian
[1:28:20] church
[1:28:21] to liberate their conscience how much
[1:28:24] greater then
[1:28:26] does this message want to free and
[1:28:28] unburden us
[1:28:29] from the thing that would hold us back
[1:28:31] the most
[1:28:33] you're not living under the threat of
[1:28:34] punishment
[1:28:36] we can't even take the truth that you
[1:28:37] reap what you sow to somehow pervert
[1:28:40] god's love
[1:28:41] that he's going to condemn us in the end
[1:28:44] you have been
[1:28:44] liberated the only way this conscience
[1:28:47] is ever going to be clean
[1:28:49] is you feed on the word that liberates
[1:28:51] you
[1:28:52] as paul took time to write a letter to
[1:28:54] the corinthian church to release those
[1:28:55] who might seem to be
[1:28:57] of a weak conscience i'm so glad that in
[1:28:59] this hour
[1:29:01] the message reveals to us
[1:29:04] the unfolding of a scroll in the
[1:29:07] presence of the elders
[1:29:09] and that bleeding word is the evidence
[1:29:12] of your innocence and anything in our
[1:29:14] minds that
[1:29:15] you remember this and you imagine that
[1:29:17] and you have this reason and you have
[1:29:18] this affection
[1:29:19] just remember none of that no matter
[1:29:22] what they try to do to you
[1:29:24] this flesh condemns you you could come
[1:29:26] right back to the final vindication
[1:29:28] the revealing the scene of yourself in
[1:29:30] the word of god to cast down
[1:29:33] to cast out let's stand today
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:46] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:29:53] [Music]
[1:30:17] hey let's power his word
[1:30:24] [Music]
[1:30:34] if you need a special touch from the
[1:30:35] lord i believe he can touch you
[1:30:38] [Music]
[1:30:44] wouldn't it be just wonderful to see
[1:30:46] your father advancing from glory today
[1:30:50] not with a record that condemns you
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:54] but one that'll liberate you and say
[1:30:57] don't worry honey
[1:30:58] all is well don't worry my child
[1:31:02] all is well but but my my body did this
[1:31:06] and my flesh did that and the world took
[1:31:08] this away from me and it world took that
[1:31:09] away from me and
[1:31:10] i can't ever have this back and i can't
[1:31:12] have ever that he says no
[1:31:13] no daughter it's okay i'm here to
[1:31:16] vindicate you
[1:31:18] i'm here to defend you
[1:31:22] i've held it all this time i took the
[1:31:23] picture before the devil could get to
[1:31:25] you
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:26] so that no matter what happened to you
[1:31:28] here we can say it's not true
[1:31:32] it's part of the lie trying to hold you
[1:31:33] back
[1:31:36] a gracious heavenly father i pray
[1:31:40] today that in this presence which we
[1:31:42] feel so sweetly now
[1:31:45] conscience can be unburdened
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:31:52] and as we acknowledge as a society as a
[1:31:55] nation
[1:31:56] a day for fathers
[1:31:59] what a beautiful picture
[1:32:01] [Music]
[1:32:03] of how that father's duty did not cease
[1:32:05] once he had
[1:32:07] allowed her to be joined to another
[1:32:09] union
[1:32:11] he kept something safe
[1:32:15] and he just waited
[1:32:19] for a time that a false accusation would
[1:32:20] be brought
[1:32:24] lord may we see ourselves in type
[1:32:30] may we see more perfectly why this act
[1:32:32] of revelations 5
[1:32:33] is so sublime
[1:32:38] may we understand more perfectly that
[1:32:41] what we might call the theology of the
[1:32:43] message and the historical
[1:32:45] elements related to seals being opened
[1:32:47] and
[1:32:48] swords coming into hands and books being
[1:32:52] taken and these things and these
[1:32:54] different elements and these fulfillment
[1:32:55] scriptures made me realize that
[1:32:58] it it goes so it's so much deeper
[1:33:02] than history
[1:33:06] it's so much more than even just
[1:33:07] vindicating the prophet he was
[1:33:09] vindicated for decades prior to this
[1:33:11] great
[1:33:12] commission to preach these seals
[1:33:16] and what in the simplicity of paul's
[1:33:18] message to the corinthian church and to
[1:33:19] the romans and
[1:33:20] the other things that he referenced how
[1:33:23] that the
[1:33:24] mystery of the faith ought to be held in
[1:33:26] pure conscience
[1:33:28] if paul went to great lengths to preach
[1:33:30] a word
[1:33:31] to those with weak conscience being
[1:33:34] defiled
[1:33:35] could be smitten and be wounded and be
[1:33:37] harmed and
[1:33:38] and brought into bondage and he he tried
[1:33:40] to bring all truth that would liberate
[1:33:42] them from a prior understanding and
[1:33:44] a lack of knowledge then lord do we not
[1:33:47] see the same thing happen on even a
[1:33:49] greater level
[1:33:53] that this message wants to liberate and
[1:33:55] free
[1:33:56] our conscience and in doing so lord
[1:34:06] sets us free to worship you
[1:34:09] bless us today lord we are in type your
[1:34:13] daughter
[1:34:17] who has been lied against who has been
[1:34:19] accused
[1:34:22] and if we were asked we would have to be
[1:34:24] honest yeah i
[1:34:25] i did this yeah i i did that and i i i
[1:34:29] made this mistake but
[1:34:32] we don't have to speak blood speaks
[1:34:37] i don't have to defend you are my
[1:34:40] avenger
[1:34:41] and i say oh god come speedily to your
[1:34:44] bride's defense today
[1:34:46] come to their aid and relieve them of
[1:34:48] their burden of guilt relieve them of
[1:34:50] this sense
[1:34:51] of shame relieve them lord from this
[1:34:54] feeling that one day their past is going
[1:34:56] to catch up to them
[1:34:57] lord if it cannot destroy this body then
[1:35:00] it can no more destroy this spirit
[1:35:02] may it be strengthened by the name of
[1:35:04] the lord jesus christ may be liberated
[1:35:06] by the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:35:08] may it be covered by the blood of the
[1:35:10] lamb and may they be set free
[1:35:13] we ask this in the name of the lord
[1:35:16] jesus christ
[1:35:18] amen amen
[1:35:22] just think of that father
[1:35:25] obviously raised his daughter right
[1:35:29] and was faithful to his calling
[1:35:33] and how we ought to see the symbol of a
[1:35:36] god that loves you
[1:35:37] oh how he loves you
