[0:00] And with all with many of the visitors
[0:02] here, I feel kind of a little awkward
[0:04] continuing on a series that the church
[0:05] is kind of on the same page and they've
[0:07] already overcome some of the uh
[0:09] headscratching they did when they first
[0:10] saw this slide. But we've been speaking
[0:12] on when the youngans don't grow up. And
[0:15] this is part seven in this particular uh
[0:18] part of this series on the house of the
[0:20] Lord. And we're looking at the process
[0:22] of Christ's image being formed in us and
[0:25] how that we go from birth from a word
[0:27] birth to the very image of Christ being
[0:30] formed and the very character of Christ
[0:32] being shaped in us. A phrase that
[0:33] brother Brandon used was coming of age.
[0:35] Another phrase that's really good is
[0:37] maturity. And if we could begin in
[0:39] Ephesians 1:5, we'll just start here and
[0:42] hopefully uh be able to review a little
[0:46] bit and go forward with some things. It
[0:47] says in love having predestinated us
[0:50] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[0:53] Christ to himself according to the good
[0:55] pleasure of his will. So God has a
[0:58] perfect will, something that he designed
[0:59] in his heart from the beginning.
[1:01] Something that he desired to see come to
[1:03] pass. And it was in love that he
[1:06] predestinated us to adoption by Jesus
[1:09] Christ. And this adoption we know
[1:11] brother Ben Brandham identifies is not
[1:13] the same as an American idea of adoption
[1:16] but rather this is the placing of a son
[1:18] as the word speaks of an establishment a
[1:21] fixing or a making and it is one showing
[1:24] fully what they are and there may be
[1:26] glimpses and certain things that
[1:28] manifest in a person's life but when
[1:30] they come to maturity you see them for
[1:32] what they are they've shown you their
[1:34] character and what they're going to be
[1:36] and we know this is the goal of the word
[1:37] according to Ephesians 4 that we grow up
[1:39] into him and that we no longer be
[1:41] children tossed to and fro. And Sunday
[1:44] we looked at how Jesus Christ expressed
[1:46] the plan of perfection for God's all of
[1:48] God's children. And brother Brandham
[1:51] taught us that God adopted his own son.
[1:53] So it's kind of a remarkable uh thing to
[1:56] do that God would adopt his son already
[1:58] his son already his uh his word has
[2:00] brought him forth. He was already um a
[2:03] babe in a manger with the blood of God
[2:05] flowing through him. But God put him
[2:06] through a process of suffering and he
[2:09] was made perfect through obedience. And
[2:11] so we are to grow from babes to this
[2:13] place of adoption. And we're it's born
[2:16] sons who grow to maturity. And this was
[2:18] expressed in the uh life of Jesus
[2:21] Christ. And we see it in the scripture
[2:23] and we see it in the message of the hour
[2:25] that Jesus proved by obedience to be the
[2:28] right kind of a son who was worthy of a
[2:31] full inheritance. He was worthy to
[2:32] receive all that had been appointed to
[2:34] him. And we saw in the scripture that
[2:37] whenever it spoke of him being made
[2:39] something and being placed at the right
[2:41] hand or receiving a name greater than
[2:42] all names, it's preceded by obedience
[2:45] and suffering and becoming obedient to
[2:47] death and doing the father's will. That
[2:50] was God's plan and Jesus yielded to it
[2:52] and it came to pass. In Hebrews 12:es
[2:57] 2 to8 it says looking unto Jesus. This
[3:00] is our instructions to us looking unto
[3:02] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[3:04] faith. He is the beginning. He is our
[3:06] foundation. He is also our capstone.
[3:08] He's the one that starts it. He's the
[3:10] one that finishes. And praise God, he
[3:12] starts what he finishes. And it's the
[3:14] perfecting. He's the beginner of our
[3:15] faith. And he is the perfecting, the
[3:17] maturing of our faith. Who for the joy
[3:20] that was set before him endured the
[3:22] cross. So he was forwardlooking. He had
[3:24] a vision. He looked to what God had
[3:26] promised him. and so he could endure the
[3:28] suffering through obedience, despising
[3:31] this shame, and as a result sat down at
[3:33] the right hand of the throne of God. For
[3:35] consider him, look to him, his he is
[3:37] your example that endured such
[3:39] contradiction of sinners against
[3:41] himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in
[3:43] your minds. Don't give up, keep
[3:45] pressing, keep persevering. As Christ
[3:47] humbled himself to be obedient, we
[3:49] likewise, as sons and daughters of God,
[3:51] should humble ourselves to be obedient.
[3:53] Ye have not resisted unto blood striving
[3:55] against sin, and ye have forgotten the
[3:58] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[4:00] unto children. My son, despise not thou
[4:03] the chastening of the Lord, nor faint
[4:05] when thou art rebuked of him.
[4:07] This is why I said, if you're being
[4:08] challenged, if you're being rebuked, if
[4:10] you're being corrected, if you're
[4:11] suffering, then we bear it. We take it
[4:13] patiently because this is the process
[4:15] that Christ went through and was set
[4:17] down in uh in his father's throne. And
[4:19] if we will go through the same process,
[4:21] he'll share even his own throne with us
[4:24] who also overcome. So don't faint, don't
[4:26] be weary, but endure the chastening. For
[4:28] whom the Lord loveth, he chastneth and
[4:31] scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. I
[4:34] know chastening and scourging sounds
[4:36] real medieval, but it's correcting. It's
[4:38] disciplining. It's instruction. It's
[4:40] disciplehip. It's these those it's a
[4:43] training that's taking place. And so
[4:45] chasing and suffering isn't always
[4:47] losing something or physically being
[4:49] beaten. But it's just it's uh being
[4:52] corrected. It's being taught. It's being
[4:53] trained. It's making difficult decisions
[4:55] to obey the Lord. That is suffering. For
[4:57] suffering is the process of character
[5:00] development. So there's got to be a
[5:01] portion where you're taught and there's
[5:03] got to be a portion of application. So
[5:05] but if you be without chastisement
[5:07] whereof all are partakers.
[5:10] And I don't know if I finished that. If
[5:11] you endure chasting, God dealeth you
[5:12] with you as as with sons. For what son
[5:15] is he whom the father chasteneth not?
[5:17] But if you be without chastisement
[5:19] whereof all are partakers, then you then
[5:21] are ye bastards and not sons. Now it's
[5:24] quite a a statement. If you be without
[5:28] this chastisement, then you are
[5:30] illegitimate. And one thing we could say
[5:32] is that if you are not responsive to the
[5:35] correction, if you are not being changed
[5:38] and moderated through the discipline and
[5:40] correction, he says if you be without
[5:41] chastisement, then you're illegitimate.
[5:44] You have the wrong attitude towards the
[5:45] word. You you if you're not being
[5:47] corrected, if you're not learning,
[5:48] you're not being trained. He says then
[5:49] you're not you're not in the channel of
[5:52] the word and you it's you're not sons
[5:54] because this is what God does to sons.
[5:56] And brother Brandham even in commenting
[5:58] on this scripture says, "Is it strange?"
[6:00] And he's referring to Peter as well. Is
[6:02] it strange that God wants to develop a
[6:04] Christlike character that comes through
[6:06] suffering? And the answer is no sir.
[6:09] It's not strange that God wants to
[6:10] develop a Christlike character that
[6:12] comes through suffering. Christ
[6:14] character was made perfect through
[6:15] suffering. He's left a measure of
[6:17] suffering for us that we too through
[6:19] suffering could come to a place a place
[6:21] and a fix and an establishment of
[6:23] maturity or perfection. Says, "And we
[6:26] have trials. We're all tried and
[6:27] chasened as sons. not one but goes
[6:30] through that. The church that is not
[6:31] suffering and is not being tried hasn't
[6:34] got it. It isn't of God. Now, there may
[6:38] be churches that suffer and there's
[6:40] churches that maybe get burned down or
[6:42] they suffer mass shootings or there may
[6:44] be people that are that feel that
[6:45] they're really going through difficult
[6:47] times, but the suffering here is the
[6:49] word of God challenging them. the word
[6:51] of God, correcting them, chastising the
[6:53] spirit of God, discipling them or
[6:55] disciplining in a church that's not
[6:56] suffering by taking the word of God and
[6:59] making application isn't of God
[7:03] because God has left this process for
[7:05] the true believer. All sons must come
[7:07] through this process. If he births you
[7:10] in the word, he wants you to grow up
[7:11] because as children, you're heirs. and
[7:13] being heirs. There's a process of the
[7:16] cultivation of character and the
[7:17] bringing forth of the character of
[7:19] Christ individual so that you can
[7:20] rightfully inherit a full inheritance.
[7:24] Now, if you could turn to Galatians
[7:25] chapter 3, I'd like to read verse 16 and
[7:28] then a few verses later in the same
[7:30] chapter. I've got a few long scripture
[7:33] readings to go through right now. If I'm
[7:36] unable to
[7:38] uh get to them, get through get through
[7:41] these in a long enough short enough
[7:43] time, we'll just pick up maybe on
[7:45] Sunday. But I'm hoping that tonight I
[7:48] have a little bit of grace in your
[7:49] attention to bring out this theme in the
[7:51] scripture of some children of God and
[7:54] this process that God brings his
[7:56] children through through training and
[7:59] tutorship and the government of the Holy
[8:00] Spirit to bring them a pla to a place of
[8:03] inheritance and how that there's others
[8:06] that seem to be closely related to that
[8:08] process who are not responding to it who
[8:10] don't have the right attitude and come
[8:12] to find out that not everyone who's
[8:14] around and not everyone who has the name
[8:16] and not everyone that looks the part is
[8:18] actually an heir. But God divides among
[8:20] them by election. Galatians 3:16. Now to
[8:24] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[8:26] made. Now he's Paul is being very
[8:29] precise with his language.
[8:32] The promises were made to Abraham and
[8:34] his seed. Paul says he saith not into
[8:37] seeds as of many, but as of one and to
[8:41] thy seed which is Christ. Now that's
[8:44] quite a statement. quite a statement
[8:46] especially to Jews and even those that
[8:47] were converted to find out that when he
[8:49] said unto Abraham and his seed that he
[8:51] wasn't necessarily speaking about Isaac
[8:53] but he spoke about the one that would
[8:54] come which is Christ so Christ is the
[8:58] seed of Abraham that was promised he is
[9:00] the promised son and Paul piggybacks on
[9:03] that in verse 26 and says for ye are all
[9:06] the children of God by faith in Christ
[9:08] Jesus for as many of you has as have
[9:11] been baptized into Christ have put on
[9:13] Christ there So there now you're in his
[9:16] nature. You're in his life. There's
[9:18] neither Jew nor Greek. There's neither
[9:19] bond nor free. There's neither male nor
[9:21] female. For you are all one in Christ
[9:23] Jesus. And if you be Christ, then are
[9:26] you Abraham's seed and hes according to
[9:28] the promise. Notice how he's kind of
[9:31] turned it around in terms of how a Jew
[9:32] would look at being the seed of Abraham.
[9:34] That you had Abraham, you had Isaac, and
[9:37] then you had Jacob, and then all those
[9:38] children of Israel. They were the seed
[9:40] of Abraham. And the promise belonged to
[9:42] them. And they were heirs of the promise
[9:44] that God had given to Abraham. And now
[9:46] Paul says, "No, Christ was the one who
[9:49] was the seed. And now you who have put
[9:52] on Christ, you who by the spirit of God
[9:54] have been baptized into Christ, now you
[9:56] are the ones that are heirs of God. You
[9:58] are the children of God. You are the
[10:00] seed of God." And this is the this is
[10:04] the body of Christ. That was the part of
[10:06] the mystery of God. And it's a contrast
[10:08] to those who are children after the
[10:10] flesh, but now the children that are
[10:12] after the spirit.
[10:14] Now, we could we could take the time,
[10:15] but we'll just point to it. In Acts
[10:17] chapter 2, we know that the elect who
[10:20] gathered into that upper room on the day
[10:22] of Pentecost became children of God
[10:24] through the quickening power of the Holy
[10:26] Ghost. Because they were sons, because
[10:28] they were seed, God sent forth his holy
[10:30] spirit. And this was a capstone to the
[10:33] Jewish church ages. Christ had been with
[10:35] them leading them to this place of
[10:38] receiving the promise that they had
[10:40] always looked forward to. And so that's
[10:42] a it's a unique event in terms of the
[10:44] gent the Jews and then it's the
[10:46] beginning of the the body of Christ that
[10:49] the Gentiles are going to be brought
[10:50] into. So it's an interesting overlap uh
[10:54] in a time where there's certain things
[10:55] that are taking place. But those who
[10:57] gathered on the day of Pentecost and
[10:59] when the day of Pentecost was fully
[11:01] come, it was a time appointed of the
[11:03] father wherein he sent his holy spirit
[11:05] and began to birth sons and daughters of
[11:08] God into the body of Christ. And we know
[11:11] that only the elect have a seed. It's a
[11:13] germ of life which the baptism of the
[11:15] Holy Ghost can bring to life. So there's
[11:17] no eternal life outside of this there.
[11:19] There's no relationship to God outside
[11:21] of this. Brother Brandham says, "And
[11:24] spoken word is the original seed." And
[11:25] this I think this would be a good sermon
[11:27] uh to maybe go through for supplemental
[11:29] uh material. It says when the Holy
[11:31] Spirit comes into that germ of life
[11:32] that's laying there, it produces another
[11:35] seed just exactly. Another son of God is
[11:38] born. Another amateur God, son of God.
[11:41] So Jesus Christ was the only begotten
[11:44] son, but now he is the firstborn among
[11:46] many brethren. Being the firstborn, he
[11:49] is heir of all things. And he he stands
[11:51] to receive certain promises. But
[11:52] according to the word of God, he's made
[11:54] us joint hes with Christ. And he's going
[11:56] to divide his inheritance, the spoil
[11:58] amongst the strong. So there's an
[12:00] inheritance for us in this who now are
[12:03] also born direct from God. And as
[12:05] children of God, we're hes of God, joint
[12:07] hes with Christ.
[12:10] And so we are not uh we are the seed of
[12:13] Abraham.
[12:14] We are heirs. He says according to the
[12:17] promise. If we're Christ, then we are
[12:19] the seed that was promised to Abraham
[12:22] and we are heirs according to the
[12:24] promise. The promise is to us.
[12:26] So this power of the Holy Ghost that
[12:28] comes on the germ of life, that is a
[12:30] person's conversion.
[12:32] That's a change of nature wherein you
[12:33] become new creatures in Christ. If there
[12:35] has not been this process, you're not
[12:38] converted.
[12:39] As as Jesus told Peter, when thou art
[12:41] converted, strengthen thy brethren.
[12:43] Didn't matter how much he had operated
[12:45] signs and wonders prior to that. It
[12:46] doesn't matter how much the anointing
[12:47] may have been on his flesh prior to
[12:49] that. But he says when you are
[12:50] converted, strengthen your brethren.
[12:52] Your conversion takes place when the
[12:53] Holy Ghost comes upon a germ of life and
[12:56] produces another son of God. That's the
[12:58] change
[12:59] that takes place. That that's what makes
[13:02] one a child of God, children of God by
[13:05] faith in Jesus Christ.
[13:07] The seal of God is a seal of your faith.
[13:10] Now in Ephesians chapter 2:es 1-6, and
[13:14] then we'll skip to verse 10.
[13:16] And I'm hoping that these scriptures in
[13:19] themselves would will stand as certain
[13:21] principles or truths to you. But I'm
[13:24] wanting to use this in the context of
[13:26] babes growing up and maturing to Christ.
[13:30] Says, "And you hath he quickened who
[13:31] were dead in trespasses and sin sins
[13:34] wherein in time past he walked according
[13:36] to the course of this world, according
[13:37] to the prince of the power of the air,
[13:39] the spirit that now workketh in the
[13:41] children of disobedience." That's a
[13:44] mouthful. a lot to really begin to
[13:46] picture and put your your mind around.
[13:49] But he's saying you've been quickened,
[13:51] but one time this quickening is you were
[13:53] dead in sins and trespasses. When you
[13:55] were born into this world, you walked
[13:56] according to the course of this world by
[13:58] the nature you received through a
[14:00] natural birth, according to the prince
[14:01] of the power there. You were subject to
[14:03] the influences of the world, the
[14:04] influences of Satan. And it's a spirit,
[14:07] he says, that now works in, notice this
[14:09] phrase, the children of disobedience.
[14:12] So you'll see in the scripture that
[14:14] there are children of God by faith in
[14:16] Jesus Christ. And now there is there are
[14:19] children of disobedience. And Paul is
[14:21] saying you have been quickened out of
[14:23] the world into a body into a new nature
[14:27] and you're different than those that are
[14:29] called children of disobedience. Now, if
[14:32] I can say this about the elect, I feel
[14:33] comfortable saying this that the elect
[14:36] can be disobedient children, but they're
[14:38] not children of disobedience because
[14:40] they are elect to a new nature.
[14:43] Among whom also we all had our
[14:45] conversation in time past in the lust of
[14:48] our flesh, of fulfilling the desires of
[14:50] the flesh and of the mind, and were by
[14:52] nature the children of wrath, even as
[14:55] others. There is judgment that comes
[14:57] upon the first birth. Being born in sin,
[15:00] we are are sentenced to death as it
[15:02] were. And we are subject to punishment
[15:04] as a result of sin. But through the
[15:05] process of a new birth, we have been
[15:07] covered in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[15:09] We're born a new. And the Bible says,
[15:10] you've passed already from death into
[15:13] life. You'll never come into judgment.
[15:15] There can be no condemnation because the
[15:17] soul has been sealed and it has been
[15:19] forgiven. You will not have to stand
[15:20] before white throne judgment to answer
[15:22] for sin. But before you're born again,
[15:25] before you're quickened, according to
[15:26] verse one, you're by nature, by your
[15:29] first birth, children of wrath, just
[15:31] like everybody else.
[15:33] But God, who is rich in mercy, for his
[15:35] great love wherewith he loved us, even
[15:38] when we were dead in sins, hath
[15:40] quickened us together with Christ. By
[15:43] grace ye are saved, and hath raised us
[15:45] up together, and made us sit together in
[15:47] heavenly places in Christ, already
[15:51] passed from death and alive. already
[15:52] quickened by the new birth. The seal of
[15:55] God has placed you as a son or daughter
[15:57] of God into the body of Christ. And now
[15:59] you're not by nature the children of
[16:01] wrath. You're not no longer ruled after
[16:04] the course of those that the spirit that
[16:06] works in the children of disobedience,
[16:08] but you are children of God by faith in
[16:10] Jesus Christ. You're Abraham's seed and
[16:13] heirs according to the promise. You're
[16:15] children of the promised.
[16:18] Verse 10 says, "For we are his
[16:20] workmanship. We are his creation, new
[16:22] creatures in Christ Jesus. He has made
[16:24] us and not we ourselves. Created in
[16:26] Christ Jesus for the purpose of good
[16:29] works, his workmanship. He's still
[16:32] working on us. He's cultivating us. We
[16:33] are God's building. We are God's
[16:35] husbandry. As a building, he's laid the
[16:37] foundation. He's building us up to
[16:39] completion. As his husbandry, he's
[16:41] pruning us. He's uh uh dunging us. He's
[16:43] working us up to bring forth perfect
[16:45] fruit, a full bow. were created in
[16:48] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[16:50] hath before ordained that we should walk
[16:53] in them.
[16:54] So this is progress. This is uh making
[16:57] uh uh advancing and continuing in
[16:59] something a manner and a course of life.
[17:02] So being created a new in Christ Jesus.
[17:05] It's done so that we can become new
[17:07] creatures in Christ who are created for
[17:09] the purpose of good works ordained that
[17:11] we should walk in them. Amen.
[17:14] This is the children of God by faith in
[17:16] Jesus Christ. It's these children that
[17:18] Hebrews chapter 12 says endures
[17:20] chastening. They are the ones that are
[17:22] scourged. They are the one that are with
[17:24] chastisement. They are not illegitimate
[17:26] but they are sons. These are the ones
[17:28] that brother Brandham says will have to
[17:30] suffer in order to have this character.
[17:34] Because it's only through that that
[17:35] character is made.
[17:37] Now it says by nature you were a child
[17:41] of wrath or children of wrath.
[17:43] And by nature, it's according to your
[17:45] first birth. And the very reason why we
[17:47] do the worldly things that we do and we
[17:49] lie and we cheat and we steal is because
[17:50] of our parents, right? We receive that
[17:54] nature from our parents. It's a worldly
[17:55] nature. And so by your first birth, you
[17:58] express express the attributes of sin.
[18:01] That's all you can do is express a
[18:02] fallen nature. And some people have
[18:05] better parents than others and a better
[18:06] nature and a better nurture. So they
[18:08] might not be as wild, but it is still
[18:10] subject to sin and subject to death.
[18:12] That's why Jesus told Nicodemus in John
[18:14] 3:7, "Marvel not when I say unto thee,
[18:16] you must be born again from a beginning,
[18:19] a new beginning. You must be born from
[18:22] above." That's that is how we become
[18:24] babes in Christ, born by the
[18:26] incorruptible word which is the seed of
[18:28] God. A a word birth, that engrafted word
[18:31] which is able to uh perfect us and
[18:33] complete us.
[18:34] Amen.
[18:35] And I realize now I may not have
[18:37] provided this statement from adoption
[18:39] part one, but brother B makes this
[18:41] statement, election looks back to
[18:43] fornowledge and predestination looks to
[18:45] destiny. He's taking that um from his
[18:47] Scoffield notes, but he he's endorsing
[18:49] it. He's saying this is he sees this in
[18:52] the scripture. He says, don't forget
[18:54] that el election looks back here. Here
[18:56] it is. And he quotes this. I was a
[18:58] cockleber. I was born in sin, shaped in
[19:01] iniquity, come into the world speaking
[19:02] lies. He's just put a bunch of
[19:04] scriptures together there. Uh, born
[19:06] among sinners, father and mother and
[19:07] all, my whole family sinners. I was a
[19:09] cockleber. This is how we were all born.
[19:12] That sticky nature, cockleber. He says,
[19:14] "But all of a sudden, I became a wheat
[19:16] grain. How did it happen?"
[19:19] That's remarkable, isn't it? I'm human.
[19:21] I make human mistakes. I do human
[19:23] things. I'm a cockleber. Got a cocklear
[19:25] nature. But all of a sudden, I became
[19:27] wheat. He says, "What happened?" He
[19:29] says, "What is that election? God before
[19:32] the foundation of the world elected that
[19:34] that cockleber was to become a grain of
[19:36] wheat.
[19:37] That's a that's what God does. That in
[19:39] the same within the same humanity, the
[19:42] same clay, God has pre has elected a
[19:45] seed, a germ seed inside of you. It's
[19:47] down in there somewhere. placed it
[19:49] inside of you that the word of God when
[19:51] the light can get on that word which
[19:52] sometimes it might take a while but
[19:54] usually brother Ram said it happens
[19:56] pretty quick but if the light can flash
[19:58] upon that seed in that right moment in
[20:00] those right conditions in the right
[20:01] atmosphere it's that germ that was
[20:03] always there transforms the life inside
[20:06] of the soul from cockleber doubt to
[20:09] faith and faith only
[20:11] and that's how it happens you're
[20:12] cockleber one day and he says all of a
[20:14] sudden you become through election a
[20:16] grain of wheat That's election. That's
[20:19] what election looks back to. So he's
[20:21] saying that as a a a grain of wheat, you
[20:24] can say now that you were elected to a
[20:27] new birth and you looking back knowing
[20:30] that this is what happened now that I'm
[20:31] a son or daughter of God. That happened
[20:33] because I'm elect.
[20:35] Only the elect can be quickened.
[20:37] That they're the only ones that can be
[20:38] quickened to new life.
[20:40] And so even in the the aspect of
[20:43] fornowledge of God, God knowing
[20:45] beforehand that's how he can elect. But
[20:47] now predestination is different. He says
[20:49] it's destiny. We were elected to a new
[20:52] birth, but now predestinated to
[20:54] adoption. If I can say it this way, we
[20:57] have a destiny. So God elected us to a
[20:59] birth to bring us to our destiny because
[21:01] our first birth couldn't do it.
[21:04] And we're wheat. See, we're wheat. I'm a
[21:06] germ of wheat. I'm a grain of wheat. So
[21:08] then it's the image of from a seed to
[21:10] harvest.
[21:12] And being elected, election requires a
[21:14] change. It's this compelling power in
[21:16] the word of God to be quickened. And
[21:18] even in an election, we're in an
[21:20] election year. It makes it one of the
[21:21] unique markers of this year. When
[21:22] there's an election, uh there is it's to
[21:25] decide on a change in administration or
[21:27] who's going to govern. So even in our
[21:29] own election, there is a it means that
[21:31] by election, we have a new tutor. We
[21:33] have a new governor. We have a new
[21:34] government, a new nature. This is what
[21:37] election looks to. This is how we become
[21:39] grains of wheat. This is how we become
[21:41] children of God by faith in Jesus
[21:43] Christ. This is how we become children
[21:44] of the promise. But then Jesus also told
[21:47] Nicodemus in verse 6, that which is born
[21:49] of the flesh is flesh. So now you have
[21:52] those that are born after the flesh and
[21:54] those that are born after the spirit.
[21:56] You have children of disobedience and
[21:58] you have those who at one time were in
[22:00] the world but now have been quickened
[22:02] into Christ.
[22:04] And brother Brandham says in spoken
[22:05] words the original seed, except a man be
[22:07] born again. Why must he be born again?
[22:10] He's dead in the fashion he's in. He's a
[22:13] hybrid. He's got to be born again.
[22:18] A hybrid indicates the wrong kind of a
[22:20] birth.
[22:22] The wrong kind of com combination. Now,
[22:24] Brother Brandham traces this all the way
[22:25] back just to the the mixing of seed in
[22:27] the beginning. How we all are born uh as
[22:30] hybrids. None of us are coming direct
[22:31] from God. None of us are direct
[22:33] descendants alone from Adam and the
[22:35] woman, but rather everything's just by
[22:36] one blood. We've all come to populate
[22:38] the whole earth. So, he's saying we're
[22:40] all hybrid. We're all fallen nature.
[22:42] We're all fallen creatures. So, we must
[22:44] be born again.
[22:46] Now, if you're thinking about this in
[22:48] terms of uh election,
[22:51] which is just a it's it's a truth in the
[22:54] scripture that you cannot deny.
[22:56] Uh I I read it somewhere. It's one of
[22:58] those things where I don't know if it's
[23:00] uh like the bears bears and things like
[23:02] that where you always remember it one
[23:03] way, find out it's another, but uh the
[23:06] Mandela effect. But I remember reading
[23:09] one time that Luther had made the
[23:11] statement that uh you you'll lose your
[23:13] mind trying to figure out predestination
[23:17] but die denying it. You'll lose your
[23:19] soul denying it. And uh like I said, I
[23:23] don't know if he I could never find it
[23:25] again. Uh but I think it is sometimes
[23:27] people say it in a way about the trinity
[23:29] which you'll lose both your mind and
[23:30] your soul trying to figure that out. But
[23:32] there is uh there is a an idea that
[23:38] in in this process
[23:41] I I just want to acknowledge that
[23:42] election it's it's so plain in scripture
[23:45] you have you just have to accept it.
[23:48] As hard as it may seem to be this
[23:50] principle of election is an absolute
[23:52] necessity. And this election means that
[23:55] there's a group of people that God has
[23:56] ordained to a birth. There's a group of
[23:58] people that God has ordained to be
[24:00] baptized by one spirit into his body.
[24:03] And this elect number is going to fill
[24:05] up the body of Christ. And there will
[24:06] come a time when there'll be no more
[24:08] seed to be quickened.
[24:10] That there it's going to be made up.
[24:12] God's going to be finished. His spirit's
[24:14] going to leave the earth
[24:15] and all that will be left are those that
[24:17] were not were unable to be quickened.
[24:19] Now, there'll still be many that are
[24:21] saved,
[24:23] but they weren't saved. Brother Bam said
[24:25] being part of the body of Christ are
[24:26] part of the bride of Christ. They come
[24:27] in another way. And I say grace
[24:29] nonetheless. It's going to be a grace.
[24:32] So in this group of people that have
[24:34] been elect to a birth, then you have
[24:37] this other group of people that may
[24:39] claim to be born again, may claim to be
[24:41] religious, claim to have the Holy Ghost,
[24:42] claim a lot of things, but we know that
[24:44] in reality there's only one group that
[24:46] actually is
[24:48] no matter what one's confession is. Now
[24:50] in Galatians 4:es 28-31
[24:55] he says now we brethren because he said
[24:56] we are as we've already read in
[24:58] Galatians chapter 3 we are Abraham's
[25:01] seed if we're Christ we are children of
[25:03] God by faith in Jesus Christ we are hes
[25:06] according to the promise now we brethren
[25:08] as Isaac was are the children of promise
[25:12] but as then he that was born after the
[25:14] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[25:16] the spirit even so it is down.
[25:20] That which is born of flesh is flesh.
[25:22] That which is born of the spirit is
[25:23] spirit. That which is born of the spirit
[25:25] is born from above. They're born again.
[25:27] They are they are the ones that have
[25:28] been elected. They are in the body of
[25:30] Christ. But then those that have not
[25:31] been born again, I'd say even yet
[25:34] there's those that are children of the
[25:36] flesh. He says those that are born after
[25:37] the flesh will persecute the true heirs
[25:41] will persecute children that are born
[25:43] after the spirit. He says as it was with
[25:44] Isaac and Ishmael, so is it now.
[25:47] Nevertheless, what saith the scripture?
[25:49] Cast out the bond woman in her son. Cast
[25:52] cast out Hagar and Ishmael. For the son
[25:55] of the bond woman shall not be heir with
[25:57] the son of the free woman. So then,
[25:59] brethren, we are not children of the
[26:00] bond woman, but of the free.
[26:03] The seed is not heir with the shuck.
[26:06] Even in the life of the wheat plant, it
[26:07] comes to a place where each one has its
[26:09] part in the process. But once you come
[26:12] to harvest time and seed time, the shuck
[26:15] has to pull away. And unless it follows
[26:17] the life into the seed, it can't it's
[26:20] not heir with the seed.
[26:23] We are not children of the bond woman.
[26:25] We are children of the free. We are not
[26:27] children of disobedience. We are
[26:28] children of the promise. But children
[26:31] after the flesh, children after Hagar,
[26:33] ch and Abraham, the the wild child which
[26:36] is Ishmael will persecute the elect.
[26:40] Now, I want to say something very
[26:42] shocking to you. I don't know if you
[26:44] knew this, but Abraham, excuse me,
[26:48] let me say it this way. Abram fathered
[26:50] Ishmael, but he didn't father Isaac.
[26:54] Right?
[26:56] Abraham.
[26:57] Fathered Isaac.
[26:59] Abramathered Ishmael, but Abraham did
[27:01] not father Isaac. What did God do? He
[27:03] changed his name. Put an H in there. Put
[27:05] himself in there.
[27:07] And so, there's a lot of things that
[27:08] were done under his first name. After
[27:10] his first birth, first birth, there was
[27:11] things that he did in doubt. There was a
[27:13] child that was produced through the
[27:14] impatience of his wife and it brought
[27:17] forth Ishmael and Abraham fathered Ish
[27:20] or Abram fathered Ishmael but it's
[27:22] Abraham that brings forth Isaac the
[27:25] promised son
[27:27] and these children of disobedience are
[27:29] the ones these children that are born
[27:31] after the flesh born after human desire
[27:34] represents the church the the will of
[27:35] the church alone the the impatience of
[27:37] Sarah but then you have the children of
[27:40] disobedience but then those that are
[27:41] born after the promise
[27:43] to be born after the promise, to be
[27:45] children of the promise is to be born a
[27:46] second time by the will of God. You'll
[27:49] find this over and over again in the
[27:50] scripture that it's always it's the
[27:52] second born. It's the second born, not
[27:54] the firstborn because the firstborn is
[27:56] going to represent our flesh. Cain even
[27:58] represents our flesh. And then you have
[28:00] the the firstborn. Um Ishmael represents
[28:03] our flesh. There's got to be a second
[28:04] birth. There's Isaac. And even coming
[28:06] down to Jacob and Esau, Esau represents
[28:08] the first birth, but it's the second
[28:10] that gets the birthright.
[28:11] Amen. Because the second birth is after
[28:14] the will of God,
[28:15] by the second Adam, not after the first
[28:17] Adam.
[28:18] Born after the promise. It's to be born
[28:20] a second time, not by flesh and blood,
[28:22] but by the will of God. In John, it
[28:24] says,
[28:28] okay, I hope this is pieces are just
[28:30] kind of getting we're turning over all
[28:32] the pieces, getting the border pieces
[28:33] together. Maybe we'll start snapping
[28:35] things together here in a moment. In
[28:37] Romans chapter 9:es 1-13,
[28:40] I say the truth in Christ, I lie not. My
[28:43] conscience also bearing me witness in
[28:45] the Holy Ghost that I have great
[28:47] heaviness and continual sorrow in my
[28:48] heart. For I could wish that myself were
[28:51] a cursed from Christ for my brethren, my
[28:53] kinsmen according to the flesh. Romans 9
[28:57] uh expresses some very great truths,
[29:00] especially after we've built in Romans
[29:01] chapter 8. But now he's looking at his
[29:03] brethren after the flesh and he's
[29:05] he'savy for them and and to see that
[29:08] they were the ones that ought to have
[29:10] received the Messiah, but they reject
[29:11] him. So his kinsmen according to the
[29:13] flesh, he says, who are Israelites
[29:16] to whom pertainth the adoption and the
[29:19] glory and the covenants and to the
[29:20] giving of the law and the service of God
[29:22] and the promises. This is who everything
[29:25] was given to was Israel first. And it
[29:28] says whose fathers and of whom as
[29:30] concerning the flesh came who is overall
[29:33] God blessed forever. Amen.
[29:37] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are their
[29:39] patriarchs. Paul, even all of his
[29:42] kinsmen according to the flesh. And then
[29:44] he says concerning the flesh of Christ,
[29:46] even Christ himself followed the lineage
[29:49] of Abraham's seed and with Joseph and
[29:52] Mary. So he's saying Christ comes as the
[29:55] seed of David. He comes even as the seed
[29:57] of Abraham. Just as you are all kinsmen,
[29:59] Christ after the flesh is in that
[30:01] lineage and in that that channel. Not as
[30:05] though the word of God have taken none
[30:07] effect. Now even though they have
[30:08] rejected him and all these promises
[30:11] pertain to them, but it's not that the
[30:13] word wasn't effective. He says, "For
[30:15] they are not all Israel which are of
[30:17] Israel."
[30:18] Basically saying it's not everybody
[30:20] who's Israel is Israel.
[30:22] And you're thinking, well, wait, how can
[30:23] that be? But Paul is narrowing down the
[30:26] definition of a child of the promise.
[30:29] Not everyone that is Israel is of
[30:31] Israel. Not all Israeli are Israel which
[30:35] are of Israel. Neither because they are
[30:37] the seed of Abraham are they all
[30:40] children.
[30:41] I think he ended up having um many more
[30:44] sons by Coutur and he had many uh many
[30:46] more children from these different
[30:48] women. And so you had Ishmael, you had
[30:50] Isaac, you had these other sons, these
[30:51] other princes. But it says, "Not just
[30:53] every seed of Abraham are all children,
[30:56] but in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
[30:59] Do you realize the scripture actually
[31:00] refers to Isaac as Abraham's only
[31:02] begotten?
[31:04] Even though he clearly had Ishmael, but
[31:06] God doesn't even acknowledge him
[31:08] according to the promise.
[31:10] And so here it implies a a election. It
[31:13] implies choice. It's this doctrine of
[31:16] election that's even shown in the birth
[31:18] of the nation of Israel, shown in the
[31:19] election of Isaac. than even Jacob that
[31:23] God is dividing amongst the children. In
[31:25] Isaac shall thy seed be called. That is
[31:27] they which are the children of the
[31:28] flesh. These are not the children of
[31:31] God, but the children of the promise are
[31:33] counted for the seed. Not all
[31:36] descendants of Abraham are children of
[31:38] God. Not all descendants after the
[31:40] flesh, after Abraham's seed, are the
[31:42] seed.
[31:46] Not all Israel is an heir.
[31:49] And he's showing that God is always
[31:50] divided among children by election.
[31:55] And it's the children of the flesh
[31:57] versus children of the promise. Now, can
[31:58] you see two sides here?
[32:00] Children of the flesh, children of the
[32:02] promise. For this is the word of
[32:04] promise. At this time will I come and
[32:06] Sarah shall have a son. And not only
[32:08] this, but when Rebecca also had
[32:10] conceived by one, even by our father
[32:12] Isaac. For the children being not yet
[32:14] born, neither having done any good or
[32:15] evil, that the purpose of God according
[32:17] to election might stand, not of works,
[32:19] but of him that calleth. It was said to
[32:21] her, "The elder shall serve the younger,
[32:23] as it is written, Jacob have I loved,
[32:25] but Esau have I hated."
[32:27] Amen.
[32:28] So in these different phrasings, that
[32:30] which is born of the flesh is flesh.
[32:32] Children of disobedience, children of
[32:34] the flesh, the bond woman, children of
[32:36] the bond woman, those born after the
[32:39] flesh that persecutes those born after
[32:40] the spirit. Born after spirit, children
[32:42] of the promise, children of the seed,
[32:43] children of God. There's these two
[32:45] different sides. What do you have?
[32:47] Church natural, church nominal. And then
[32:50] you have the church spiritual,
[32:52] the faith seed. Brother Brandham called
[32:54] it the royal seed.
[32:56] those that are church nominal. All you
[32:58] need in order to be um child of the
[33:00] flesh is just to be born. You can be as
[33:02] religious as you want. Religion doesn't
[33:03] change the designation of being a child
[33:05] of the flesh.
[33:08] To be a child of disobedience, that's
[33:10] just all the requirement for that is to
[33:12] be born after a man and a woman.
[33:15] But to be part of that spiritual body of
[33:17] Christ the bride, to be part of the
[33:19] royal seed of Abraham, to be a faith
[33:21] seed, there has to be a germ of life.
[33:23] And that German life is is ordained to
[33:25] be quickened.
[33:28] And I hope that you can see then that
[33:30] even in the language of the scripture
[33:33] that there can be babes on both sides.
[33:38] That there's children
[33:40] and that the children being born, God
[33:42] knows amongst them who's elected and
[33:44] who's not. And it comes in the process
[33:47] of time. Character manifests itself. And
[33:50] it's by their fruits that you know them.
[33:52] And we see this in the example of uh the
[33:56] seed of Abraham wherein the right seed
[34:01] of Abraham in the wrong womb of Hagar
[34:03] produced a wild man. So you said
[34:05] Abraham's the prop Abram was the proper
[34:07] father but Hagar was the wrong womb and
[34:10] so it brought forth Isaac or excuse me
[34:12] Ishmael who was a child of the flesh not
[34:15] heir of the promise.
[34:16] Abraham was old that Ishmael would live
[34:18] before him. God said no. Uh-uh. He's not
[34:20] the one. And Abraham, Abram's like,
[34:22] "Well, why? Why not, please?" He says,
[34:24] "No, it's got to come through Sarah."
[34:27] And then the right seed in the right
[34:28] womb, Abraham and Sarah produced an heir
[34:31] to the promise, which was Isaac.
[34:35] And then I I acknowledge just even maybe
[34:38] the paradox of it, but then when you
[34:39] come to Isaac and Rebecca, it's the
[34:42] right seed in the right womb that
[34:44] produces twins. And the firstborn, Esau,
[34:47] is a child of doubt. He's a child of the
[34:49] flesh. The Bible says he was a profane
[34:52] person. He despised the birthright and
[34:55] he ultimately marries, no surprise, a
[34:57] daughter of Ishmael.
[34:59] Why? Because that is who he affinity was
[35:02] with.
[35:03] His attitude towards the word, his
[35:05] attitude towards the promise kind of
[35:07] revealed what was inside of him. And
[35:08] even though Jacob was the shyer in
[35:10] pulling deals, it pleased God that he
[35:13] loved the birthright.
[35:15] He saw something special. And God set it
[35:17] forth again as an example that after
[35:19] your first birth, you're nothing but a
[35:21] child of the flesh. The flesh, that
[35:22] which is born of flesh is flesh. You
[35:24] must be born again
[35:26] according to a promise. So then you have
[35:28] Jacob who is the seed of faith. He is
[35:30] according to the promise Isaac and
[35:32] Jacob. It's through Jacob who becomes
[35:34] Israel that you have the seed of
[35:36] Abraham. And if you're not born through
[35:38] that, you weren't considered a part of
[35:40] Israel.
[35:43] There's these distinct
[35:46] children coming forth, babes that are
[35:49] born, and you'll only know who they are
[35:51] by their life.
[35:54] Now, I' I'd like to read a number of
[35:56] lengthy statements from one sermon, the
[35:58] invisible union of the bride of Christ.
[36:00] I encourage you to go listen to the
[36:01] sermon. I've told you uh last month just
[36:04] how much might even been before that
[36:05] just how much I've been drawing from
[36:07] this sermon and that series that whole
[36:10] series he preached that Thanksgiving
[36:11] weekend in 1965
[36:14] for this particular series on when the
[36:16] youngans don't grow up. Some of you
[36:18] probably already have uh keyed in on
[36:20] this but this I'm not I haven't been
[36:22] hiding this. We're just now coming to
[36:24] it. This sermon as he opens the meetings
[36:26] with this sermon it is a rebuke to
[36:29] Leodysia. It's a correction of Leodysia
[36:33] and it's a clear rejection of
[36:35] denominationalism that the days of
[36:37] denominationalism are over. God's no
[36:38] longer working through denominations and
[36:41] you can claim all you want to, but if
[36:42] you hold your organization, you're dead.
[36:45] And he's making this point over and over
[36:46] again. So, he's saying this and it's
[36:50] more towards the middle. I think it's
[36:51] around paragraph 130. I didn't write it
[36:53] down, but he's talking about a modern
[36:55] woman who doesn't want children, but yet
[36:57] it's in her nature. And so what she'll
[36:59] do is she'll mother something.
[37:01] And he says, "Neither does the modern
[37:03] church want any of these here screaming,
[37:07] shouting, tongues speaking." Acts 2:38
[37:09] youngans around around her. This is the
[37:12] modern woman. She looks at she looks at
[37:15] these youngans and she looks at these
[37:16] babes and she looks at their screaming
[37:18] and shouting their tongues and she's
[37:20] offended by them is what brother show.
[37:22] The modern woman, the modern church
[37:24] doesn't want these kind of babies.
[37:27] doesn't want kind of these children. He
[37:28] says, "Amen. Hallelujah." Why? He says,
[37:30] "She don't want any of them whooping and
[37:32] crying and screaming, "Amen.
[37:34] Hallelujah." Why? Such a child would
[37:36] immediately put her out of her
[37:38] denomination.
[37:39] So, it it's it's this image of how a
[37:41] modern woman doesn't want to have
[37:43] babies, but it's in her nature. So,
[37:44] she'll buy a cat, a little chihuahua,
[37:46] whatever it is. She's going to have her
[37:47] pet, and she's going to find some way to
[37:49] mother something, maybe even her
[37:52] boyfriend. Whatever it is, it's in her
[37:54] nature and she wants to do that. He
[37:55] says, "But if she was to actually bring
[37:57] forth a child then and it's screaming
[38:00] and it's crying and it's shouting, they
[38:01] that they would put her out of the
[38:02] denomination. That church wouldn't be
[38:04] received anymore. They had like if they
[38:06] had one like that in one of their
[38:08] churches, why they'd throw her out right
[38:10] quick."
[38:10] Right?
[38:11] So, this is this is where it's very
[38:14] Here's 1965. This is November 25th,
[38:17] 1965. Brother saying the modern church
[38:19] does not want Acts 2:38 youngans
[38:24] born by the spirit of God, born again,
[38:25] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[38:27] and then they're screaming, they're
[38:28] shouting, they're praising God, they're
[38:30] whooping and crying. He says the church
[38:31] doesn't want that.
[38:32] But then he makes this statement about
[38:34] this modern church. She's pregnant with
[38:36] something cuz she's bringing forth
[38:38] members all the time. So, she's still
[38:40] having babies,
[38:42] but she don't want none of them
[38:44] screaming, hollering, blabbing. Acts
[38:46] 2:38, what does he call them? Youngans.
[38:48] But then he says, miserable creatures
[38:50] that she thinks they are.
[38:52] So there's this intellectual modern
[38:54] church that would look at these these uh
[38:58] Pentecostals, they might call holy
[38:59] rollers or whatever they might call
[39:00] them, but this screaming and holling and
[39:02] blabbing, these Acts 238 tongue talking,
[39:05] shouting, whooping and crying, amen,
[39:07] hallelujah, uh, youngans. He says, she
[39:10] says those are miserable creatures.
[39:12] It would certainly embarrass her. it
[39:14] would ruin her and her educated ethical
[39:17] scientific society church that she
[39:18] belonged to here. They'd throw her out
[39:20] at the next council. She can't have it.
[39:24] So she so she don't want to be pregnant
[39:27] with the word because that's the only
[39:29] kind that the word can bring forth.
[39:31] And I will say this that the word can
[39:34] only bring forth word children. But
[39:36] brother Brandham is saying that the word
[39:38] can only bring forth these kinds of
[39:40] children that they may be screaming,
[39:42] they may be crying, they may be
[39:44] whooping, they may be speaking in
[39:45] tongues. It may be according to these
[39:46] things that happened in Acts chapter 2.
[39:49] He says she doesn't want to be pregnant
[39:50] with word because that's the only kind
[39:52] that the word can bring forth born of
[39:54] the spirit of God. It has to be the
[39:55] spirit of God in it. No intellectual
[39:58] church joining creed going bobbed hair
[40:00] painted face. There's no such a thing as
[40:02] that in it in all of it. You don't find
[40:04] that in the word of God. You find an
[40:06] old-fashioned, sanctified, Holy
[40:08] Ghost-filled child born of the spirit of
[40:09] God screaming, hollering, shouting,
[40:11] praising God.
[40:13] Amen.
[40:15] This is what the Holy Spirit will do to
[40:16] somebody. Brother Bam teaches us that a
[40:18] birth is a mess. That it's that there's
[40:21] a change that comes. I think there's
[40:23] some that can make a doctrine out of it.
[40:25] Brother Bam said you can receive the
[40:26] Holy Ghost without sensation, but some
[40:28] people want to kind of bring it back in
[40:29] and say that you have to receive it with
[40:31] sensation. Brother Abraham's not
[40:32] changing his teaching on anything else
[40:34] in his scripture in his teaching
[40:36] throughout his ministry. He's saying
[40:37] that there's an attitude within the
[40:39] modern church that looks at those things
[40:41] and rejects them outright.
[40:43] Rejects them outright. What is it? It's
[40:45] that intellectual cold formal side which
[40:48] when he indictes them, he indictes the
[40:50] emotional fanatical unhind side too.
[40:53] Because both emotion and intellect
[40:55] reside in the mind and in the spirit.
[40:58] But he's saying this is what the Holy
[40:59] Spirit will do. You take somebody who's
[41:01] been a hardened sinner, the spirit of
[41:03] God fall on them, they may weep, they
[41:05] may cry. Even when when they're born
[41:06] again, they may shout, they may dance,
[41:08] they may speak with tongues. None of
[41:10] those are the evidence that they've been
[41:12] born again. But it can be the Holy
[41:14] Spirit working upon an individual, even
[41:16] just to work in their flesh.
[41:20] And even if we just reject those
[41:22] emotions and the the human response to
[41:26] spiritual stimulus, we could be
[41:27] rejecting the Holy Spirit.
[41:29] So he's he's really calling these things
[41:31] out. He continues, "This is very close
[41:33] to where we just were in those
[41:34] paragraphs. Notice what she loves. This
[41:36] church has been impregnated by
[41:38] something. Watch what she loves. It'll
[41:40] tell you what she's been impregnated
[41:41] with. Watch her lover. You want to see
[41:43] who she's in love with. The word says
[41:45] this, but she said, "My church says
[41:47] this." Then who is she in love with?
[41:50] She in love with her pastor. Is she in
[41:51] love with the the word? Or is she in
[41:52] love with her church? Who is her
[41:54] husband? Her own fruits prove what she
[41:56] is. Exactly. Right. shows what she is.
[42:00] And then his language in this is I find
[42:03] it fascinating because when we think
[42:05] invisible union of the bride of Christ
[42:07] and then he begins talking he's talking
[42:08] about a woman and her husband and your
[42:10] first husband being dead and this new
[42:12] spiritual union
[42:14] and he's talking about your first
[42:16] husband
[42:17] and that husband being dead. He's
[42:19] talking about children. So he says she
[42:21] was born first to Adam because that's
[42:23] her natural birth. So it it's showing
[42:25] that the church using Adam as the
[42:27] father. There's a church that's born
[42:29] after the flesh after Adam. And it's a
[42:31] this is just a natural church. Not
[42:33] church spiritual but church natural. And
[42:35] she never left that. She never left the
[42:38] natural way of things. That's a lover of
[42:41] the world. She claims that she's born
[42:42] the second time to Christ, but her lover
[42:45] is Adam yet because she loves the world.
[42:48] That's where her loyalty is to. And
[42:51] another thing, notice what kind of
[42:52] children she's bearing. Now, that to me
[42:54] is the real focus because now you have a
[42:58] woman who's bringing forth children.
[43:00] Says it tells what their papa is,
[43:02] whether it's the first Adam or second
[43:04] Adam.
[43:06] If the church brings forth a child of
[43:07] the second Adam, he acts the second
[43:09] Adam's way of acting like they did on
[43:11] the day of Pentecost.
[43:13] That's the really true second Adam's
[43:15] children. Their nature is like his and
[43:17] hers.
[43:19] Now, as I've read over that, listen to
[43:21] it, that church, a a true church, if a
[43:26] if a child is brought forth by the word
[43:29] of God as a child of the second Adam,
[43:31] then it's a product of Christ and
[43:34] through the word through the right
[43:35] channel. He say it's going to produce
[43:36] like he did on the day of Pentecost.
[43:40] Now, this is brother Brandham's going
[43:42] down a line here and I've skipped some
[43:43] of these other things where he says, you
[43:44] know, people
[43:46] not wanting to speak with tongues and
[43:48] not wanting to be embarrassed and what
[43:49] would they think, what would the
[43:50] neighbor think, what would the Joneses
[43:51] think? And so, he's covering a lot of
[43:53] ground in here and and he's he's set
[43:56] this up very plainly and I I cut out so
[43:58] much just to be able to read these
[43:59] statements where he says, "The modern
[44:01] church, which is born after the flesh,
[44:04] doesn't want babes that are born by the
[44:07] word of God. All right.
[44:09] And it may be because they scream and
[44:11] they shout and they speak with tongues.
[44:12] They say al hallelujah. They're
[44:14] whooping. They're crying. They're
[44:14] blabbering as brother Brandham said.
[44:16] There's all these different things he's
[44:17] saying that they don't want these
[44:19] screaming children that are coming as
[44:21] we'll read here in a moment. But brother
[44:23] Brandham, he's he's as he's making this
[44:25] point that's an amen to us.
[44:29] And it's an amen to who he's preaching
[44:32] to in a way.
[44:34] And he says this continue on much later
[44:36] in the sermon. At the end, both trees
[44:39] are coming to the seed and proving
[44:41] themselves because he's talking about
[44:42] the way someone acts. And he says, "Here
[44:44] we are right today. Leysia
[44:47] and the bride."
[44:50] Now he's really brought a distinction.
[44:52] He's rebuking and says, "If you do this,
[44:54] you're Leodysia." There's a certain
[44:56] characteristic of Leodysia. There's a
[44:57] distinction that he makes between
[44:58] Leodysian church and the bride.
[45:02] Here we are. Two trees growing up. The
[45:03] Leodysian tree and the bride. just as
[45:06] clear and pretty as it pretty as it can
[45:07] be in the scripture and right before
[45:09] eyes. You can't serve God and mammon.
[45:12] You can't be a virtuous bibleelving
[45:14] Christian and associate yourself in a
[45:16] the denominational affair. You just
[45:18] can't do it at the same time. One has
[45:21] got to be dead and let the other one
[45:23] live.
[45:25] Neither can you bear God's word son.
[45:28] So if this if it's denominational, if
[45:30] it's still if someone is still if it's
[45:34] the first atom, all you can produce is
[45:36] more first atoms.
[45:37] Neither can the church bring forth. They
[45:40] don't want one of them screaming
[45:43] children, shouting and speaking in
[45:45] tongues and all them things. This is
[45:47] what they don't want. The modern church
[45:48] doesn't want this. You can't do that in
[45:50] a denominational church. They won't have
[45:52] you. They don't bring them like that.
[45:56] They take them up and shake their hands
[45:57] and say if you believe you've got it and
[45:59] as long as you put your name on the book
[46:01] that's all you have to do. He says
[46:03] illegitimate. It's illegitimate children
[46:05] to the word still claim to be religion.
[46:08] There's that cold formal intellectual
[46:10] just accept it just ascent to it shake
[46:12] hands. And he's really calling that side
[46:14] out that reject an Acts 2:38 experience
[46:18] that reject the baptism of the Holy
[46:20] Ghost that reject gifts and signs and
[46:22] wonders and and even emotions, screaming
[46:24] and shouting, speaking in tongues, call
[46:26] them things holy rollers and cast them
[46:27] as a dirty name. He says, "Oh, that
[46:29] would be embarrassing." Calls them
[46:30] miserable creatures.
[46:34] And if you'll take the time to listen to
[46:35] this and then especially the next
[46:37] morning
[46:38] or the next evening, then the next
[46:40] morning he preaches this sermon. He
[46:42] preaches the next evening. He preaches a
[46:43] men a brother's breakfast full gospel
[46:45] business. Then he preaches another. And
[46:46] in this whole series, you listen to the
[46:48] whole thing. I just want to say this.
[46:49] This was a setup.
[46:52] Brother Brandham knew how to approach
[46:54] the church.
[46:56] He knew how to speak in such a way.
[46:57] You'll find that he does this often his
[46:59] ministry. We may take time here in the
[47:01] near future to show how that brother
[47:02] Bram says that the angel speaks to the
[47:04] church natural and the church spiritual
[47:06] because the church claims to be. They
[47:09] claim to be the church. So, he'll
[47:10] address them. He'll speak to them. He'll
[47:12] correct them. He'll give them a message
[47:14] that they need to be rebuked. And if
[47:15] they change, they prove themselves to
[47:17] actually be church spiritual. He said,
[47:18] "So, he speaks to both of them just the
[47:20] same because they claim to be
[47:22] something."
[47:23] And so, here, Brother Bradom, they claim
[47:25] to be Pentecostal. They claim to have
[47:27] the Holy Ghost. They claim to be born
[47:28] again. And he's actually setting them up
[47:30] because he's saying things that they
[47:32] really like.
[47:35] If you take time to listen to the
[47:36] series, you'll see how brother Brandham
[47:38] uses this.
[47:40] He's already established he's for a new
[47:41] birth. He's establishing he's for the
[47:43] restoration of gifts. He's establishing
[47:44] that you can't reject these things that
[47:46] you can't even denominate. You got to
[47:48] these are certain things that are sacred
[47:50] to the scripture.
[47:52] If you listen to invisible union, go
[47:53] listen to it again. You probably already
[47:55] see this. Uh but I just want to point
[47:57] this out tonight that it's more about
[47:59] the fruit of the union than it is about
[48:00] the union itself.
[48:02] Amen. The invisible union of the bride
[48:04] of Christ is more about the children
[48:06] that are coming forth and the fruit of
[48:08] the union than it is about the marriage
[48:10] itself.
[48:12] It's about the nature of the children
[48:14] coming forth, the nurture upon those
[48:16] children, the raising and establishing
[48:18] them and then what they what they're a
[48:20] proponent of and what they endorse and
[48:22] what they lift up. Because he says this
[48:24] nominal church is training children,
[48:26] having children, teaching them, raising
[48:28] them up. And we know then that if the
[48:30] children of disobedience and children of
[48:31] the flesh and children of the modern
[48:33] church have their teaching and have
[48:35] their doctrines and have their patterns,
[48:36] he's saying that the children who are
[48:38] born again, Acts 2:38, youngans, they
[48:40] have to have a Holy Ghost training, too.
[48:44] And he's pointing out that we we can
[48:46] claim to be married, but what kind of
[48:47] fruits are you producing?
[48:49] This invisible union is more about the
[48:51] fruit, about the children, about the
[48:52] babes, about the youngans, than it is so
[48:55] much about the union. But it is union
[48:57] time. Amen.
[48:59] And let me point this out. We'll soon be
[49:01] closing, but his audience was Life
[49:02] Tabernacle in Shreveport, Louisiana.
[49:05] Their pastor was Jack Moore. He was a
[49:08] Pentecostal, believed in the gifts,
[49:09] taught healing, didn't claim to have a
[49:11] healing ministry,
[49:13] but he was
[49:16] uh one of the beginners of the Voice of
[49:17] Healing magazine and also the herald of
[49:20] his coming. Became Christ for the
[49:23] nations later on and Gordon Lindseay was
[49:25] involved. But he was somebody that was a
[49:27] great figure within the Pentecostal
[49:29] movement. One that supported brother
[49:30] Brandham and opened up his doors.
[49:33] And brother Brandham in making reference
[49:35] to Herald of his coming. This is just
[49:37] the summer before 1964 actually. So the
[49:39] two summers before in recognizing your
[49:42] day and its message, he's talking about
[49:43] this great publication herald of Coming.
[49:45] And Jack my says they want a great
[49:47] awakening. They're crying believing that
[49:50] there'll be an awakening. They're good
[49:52] people. Why is it? What have they done?
[49:54] They have not recognized the awakening
[49:56] of the bride. So here he is a year later
[49:58] saying there's le oysia and there's the
[50:00] bride.
[50:01] There's the modern church and there's
[50:03] the church of God. There's a church
[50:05] natural, there's a church spiritual. And
[50:06] he's not just going to sum it all up in
[50:08] one service, but he's going to go
[50:09] through a whole series to try to shake
[50:10] them and get their attention. He says
[50:13] they have not recognized the awakening
[50:14] of the bride. Being a Christian, they
[50:16] feel the pull of the hour, but they
[50:18] haven't recognized what's been done.
[50:20] That's what's making them feel that way.
[50:22] They know something's supposed to
[50:24] happen, but they're looking for it way
[50:26] off in the future to come when it's
[50:27] already happened right by you.
[50:30] That's the same thing they did in the
[50:31] old days. They were believing in the
[50:33] coming Messiah. Think about what he just
[50:34] said. It happened before. They were
[50:36] believing in the coming Messiah. They
[50:38] believed that there'd be a forerunner
[50:39] come, but it was right on them and they
[50:40] didn't know it. They didn't recognize
[50:42] it.
[50:44] What was he saying that uh this
[50:46] heralding was coming and voice of the
[50:47] healing? These Pentecostals, what were
[50:49] they failing to recognize? the age of
[50:50] the bride,
[50:51] the age of the union, the age of the
[50:53] rapture, the adoption time.
[50:55] It was not a restoration of the gifts
[50:57] message. It was not a reformer's
[50:58] message. It was a it was the bride time,
[51:00] the bride age.
[51:02] And about this time that brother
[51:03] Brandon's preaching the invisible union
[51:04] of the bride of Christ, he's using a
[51:06] language to say this is not le to see an
[51:08] age. This is the bride age.
[51:10] We're not looking for a repeat of the
[51:12] day of Pentecost. He's saying that when
[51:14] the outpouring of the gifts, the
[51:15] restoration of gifts, the outpouring of
[51:16] the spirit manifest itself in Leodysia.
[51:18] That was a repeat of those things
[51:21] already. We can't we're not repeating
[51:22] Pentecost again.
[51:26] And so as he is I I say it was a setup
[51:31] because he he he he's vindicating and
[51:33] validating there's an Acts 238
[51:35] experience. There is a new birth
[51:36] experience. But the way you live and
[51:39] your attitude towards the word is going
[51:40] to prove what kind of son you are.
[51:44] Anybody can impersonate tongues. And he
[51:45] goes, he he says at the very next
[51:47] service, anybody can be emotional.
[51:50] Anybody can look like a young,
[51:52] right?
[51:55] But do the youngans ever grow up into
[51:56] the image of the word?
[51:58] Amen.
[51:59] So he comes down and he says this. He
[52:01] says, "You say we got a grain of wheat.
[52:03] Be careful. It's just exactly like the
[52:06] grain, but there's not a bit of grain in
[52:08] it. It's the shuck. There's the
[52:10] Pentecostal. So much Matthew 24:24 said,
[52:13] "Dece to see the very elected in the
[52:15] last days, if it was possible." But you
[52:17] pull leaf by leaf back, you ain't got no
[52:19] grain. The grain's right back in the
[52:22] back of it succeeded again. It looks
[52:25] just like the one that went to the
[52:26] ground. And then the life comes out of
[52:29] that denomination and goes into the
[52:30] grain. Then what happens? You listening?
[52:34] Amen. Amen.
[52:35] This is this is so key to what he's
[52:37] saying because he's talking he's being
[52:38] very adamant about there being a birth.
[52:40] He's being adamant about there being a
[52:41] young and and being these new children,
[52:43] these babes, these blabbering, these
[52:45] tongue talking, Holy Ghost weeping and
[52:47] crying. He says when the grain begins to
[52:48] grow to get bigger so it can cover cover
[52:51] over something, the denomination pulls
[52:53] away from it. So it's got to grow.
[52:57] He says why we ain't got a denomination
[52:58] out of this. They never will be. It's
[53:00] the grain. It can't go no further. We're
[53:02] at the end time.
[53:04] So what does it have to do now? Lay in
[53:08] the presence of the sun to be ripened.
[53:10] That's exact the word to be ripened into
[53:13] your heart to bring forth and live what
[53:15] we're talking about. Yes, sir. Then
[53:17] you'll have no more doubts if you let
[53:19] the Holy Spirit reveal it to you.
[53:23] It's not chasing revivals. It's not the
[53:25] revival of something that's been, but
[53:27] it's the purpose of what the revival
[53:29] fires were for to come back to the seed
[53:31] again. Amen.
[53:33] And these one ones that have been
[53:34] birthed by the word. As the seed comes
[53:36] up, he says, "It's got to come to a
[53:38] place." And what do he say? It was
[53:39] baking all the greenness out.
[53:42] Yes, we were young. Yes, we were
[53:45] excitable. And we were had a lot of
[53:46] energy. But you got to use that energy
[53:48] to get somewhere.
[53:52] He says, "Let that word be ripened." lay
[53:55] those youngans, those that have been
[53:56] birthed by the word. It's in the grain.
[53:58] This is the time we're living in now.
[53:59] Amen. It's not message daycare.
[54:03] It's time to lay in the presence of the
[54:04] sun to be ripened. It's time to grow up.
[54:08] And if you'll do that, then you'll have
[54:09] no more doubts.
[54:11] If you'll let the Holy Spirit reveal it
[54:13] to you. And one of his themes in this is
[54:14] it's not about revivals. It's about
[54:16] revelation.
[54:19] And he he's going to great lengths just
[54:21] bringing out truths of the original sin.
[54:24] And he and he's speaking them in a way
[54:26] to say, look, even Genesis 4:16, what
[54:29] happened here? You have the seed of the
[54:30] woman and then you have the and you have
[54:32] the first son Cain which is after the
[54:34] flesh through the serpent and he's
[54:36] saying then you have Seth that comes is
[54:38] completely different nature different
[54:39] kind of creature and brother Bram's
[54:40] going over and over again and he's
[54:42] saying that this woman was a byproduct
[54:44] and this is why the fall came says the
[54:46] attributes that's in God had to be
[54:47] displayed this is the way God did it
[54:49] this way he said he has to be a savior
[54:52] and to make everything perfect the way
[54:55] he had it then there could be nothing
[54:58] lost
[54:59] And he says, "Oh, don't be children. Be
[55:02] men and women." We're at the end of the
[55:04] road. We're at the end road.
[55:08] Notice what he says. And he and he's
[55:09] saying it, and I believe that we should
[55:11] appropriately keep it in that channel.
[55:12] He says, "The church doesn't want to
[55:14] bring forth children at all." And that's
[55:17] what he rebukes the modern church for.
[55:19] They don't even want to have children.
[55:20] And really, what he begins to point out
[55:22] is they can't do it anyways. If they
[55:25] bring forth children, they're
[55:26] impregnated by something else. And
[55:28] they're bringing forth hybrids. They're
[55:29] bringing forth stillborn. They're not
[55:31] bringing forth children of the promise.
[55:33] They're bringing forth children of the
[55:34] flesh that are concerned only with the
[55:36] flesh. And you'll know them by how they
[55:38] grow up.
[55:39] They'll grow up to be an Esau. They'll
[55:41] grow up to be they'll grow up to be a
[55:43] profaneer. They'll grow up to be an
[55:44] Ishmael.
[55:46] They'll grow up to be a lot. They'll
[55:47] grow up to be something else. And you're
[55:49] only going to know as they grow up
[55:50] because as they both lay in the church,
[55:52] they can cry. They can shout. They can
[55:54] scream and they can blab all they want
[55:55] to, but you only know by how they grow
[55:58] up.
[56:00] He says, "Don't be children.
[56:02] Be men and women.
[56:04] We're at the end of the road."
[56:06] And with that as a foundation, I'd like
[56:08] to get to my text,
[56:10] but we'll invite you musicians to come,
[56:12] but listen to this. Just read. I want to
[56:13] read this. I won't go any further.
[56:14] Isaiah 32:1-4.
[56:17] This is speaking of a very specific
[56:18] time. Behold, a king shall reign in
[56:20] righteousness.
[56:21] This is a kingdom being ushered in. This
[56:23] is at the step of a millennial ushering
[56:26] of a millennial season, a time of king
[56:28] and queen. And princes shall rule in
[56:31] judgment.
[56:32] And a man shall be as a hiding place
[56:34] from the wind and a covert from the
[56:37] tempest, as rivers of water in a dry
[56:39] place, as the shadow of a great rock in
[56:42] a weary land. For in a time of trouble,
[56:45] he shall set me up upon a rock.
[56:48] This is your rapture time. This is your
[56:50] rapture season.
[56:52] And then and the eyes of them that see
[56:54] shall not be dim.
[56:56] What's happening? It's not partial
[56:59] sight. It's not cloudy. It's not murky.
[57:01] Those that can see can see clearly. And
[57:03] the ears of them that hear shall listen
[57:05] will obey.
[57:08] And the heart also of the rash shall
[57:10] understand knowledge.
[57:13] And the tongue of the stammers shall be
[57:16] ready to speak plainly.
[57:19] There comes a time what follows the
[57:21] tongues if it's been genuine what
[57:22] follows the tongues is understanding and
[57:25] speaking plainly
[57:28] and young ones they'll have a language
[57:31] all to themselves
[57:33] but we're living in an hour we got we're
[57:34] speaking a new language a pure language
[57:37] the Bible says that's what we're feeding
[57:40] on is the unfailing bodily word of the
[57:41] son of man to give us a new language to
[57:44] speak with spiritual understanding to
[57:46] speak with revelation
[57:48] And as a spirit of God, we'll birth
[57:49] people into the kingdom of God. They're
[57:51] going to start as babes. And we have to
[57:53] have the kind of environment to nurture
[57:54] birth. The right kind of atmosphere,
[57:56] right kind of attitude towards the word
[57:58] of God so they can have new birth
[57:59] experiences. They can enjoy the presence
[58:01] of God. The spirit of God has liberty to
[58:03] move. But we got to stay on the right
[58:04] channel to know that where we're at in
[58:06] this end time, it's not frolic.
[58:09] It's maturity.
[58:10] Amen.
[58:11] It's not for show. It it's it's to be
[58:14] changed in a moment, in a twinkling of
[58:16] an eye.
[58:16] Amen. And the Bible says there'll come a
[58:19] time when the tongues of the stammers,
[58:20] he says he'll speak with stammering lips
[58:22] and other tongues, but there'll come a
[58:24] time and I believe this time is now when
[58:26] the church grows up and she's ready to
[58:28] speak plainly.
[58:30] Amen.
[58:30] She'll have thus sayaeth the Lord.
[58:32] Amen.
[58:33] She'll be the final voice
[58:35] to the final age. If we could stand
[58:37] together and pray.
