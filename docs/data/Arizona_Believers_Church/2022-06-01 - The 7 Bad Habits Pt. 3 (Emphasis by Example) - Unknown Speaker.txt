TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we want to welcome you back to another segment of kids eat free and if you're still trying to figure this one out let me just say that you know if you heard that at a restaurant your kids could eat free you might have an incentive to bring them right so kids eat free is this segment that we've been doing we've started a series underneath this uh on the seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents this is part three on that and tonight the subtitle is emphasis by example so i'm gonna be kind of bringing a couple things together and i forgot to say this but sister trinity it's so nice to see you tonight god bless you welcome back she's been traveling visiting family and it's so good to see her tonight i apologize i feel like i should reset i forgot to say hi to her it's so nice to see you but the so the subtitles emphasis by example we're kind of marrying a couple of those principles that we went over last time so if we look at these i'll just review for a few moments the seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents um if you're thinking well i'm not a parent now i'm a grandparent i'm not married this is applicable for any time of life and for any relationship we could we could say this is you know seven bad habits of a highly ineffective christian if that would get your attention feel free to write it down that way but the number one in this order and again i'll even say this i structured it this way because i saw a correlation to the uh seven of the characteristics of the stature of a perfect man and so i saw each one of these so i kind of ordered them to match with those and we went over that in part one and so it's over emphasizing carnal things inconsistently instructing and correcting improperly judging inappropriately using voice wrongly disciplining not being an example and withholding grace and i would say all of these are related some of you may be able to look at this and think that under the principle of keep it simple stupid you would kind of consolidate them and maybe only come up with a few uh there is overlap and correlations among them and even as you look at them i want to maybe just do this by looking at it that there's some groupings that you could make with these and with emphasis over emphasizing carnal things and even number six uh being an example or not being an example those would be two different habits that relate to how we live before our children i want you to recognize that that in number one over emphasizing carnal things isn't something you do to them but it's something rather you do before them in front of them that they're watching so you can kind of group some of these based upon how you live before your children and then the others on instructing and correcting and judging and how you use your voice and disciplining and even the grace that you show that relates to our treatment of them so there's ways that you can look there's things that we do that may never be to them but it's in front of them and there's things that we do that are definitely to them that we need to be conscious of and so that's what i want to do tonight is going to combine some things but again just for review i want to kind of honestly maybe close the loop but just revisit a couple things from last time on overemphasizing carnal things or one way that we put it was to emphasize spiritual things we looked in the word of god and saw where spiritual things bring depth it's what makes a real solid relationship it's the real good footing and security of a relationship it brings stability and so where you if you want happiness if you want rest if you want quietness if you want that peace within your in your family among your family members or in a relationship uh spiritual things are going to give you that bedrock so it really brings depth but the carnal things uh they feed shallowness if it's carnal it's very very shallow it's gonna it's gonna run out it's it's not gonna last and if you're feeding on carnal things it's going to promote fear within your relationships and it's going to breed a frustration and so it's carnal things to me this is just an absolute if carnal things have the preeminence there's going to be anger within your relationships if carnal things have preeminence there's going to be frustration and aggravation and discouragement and so god's law we looked at it in galatians chapter 6 that god's law of the harvest dictates this is an absolute law that if you sow to the carnal you're going to reap carnal right if you sow to it you're going to get from it so if you if you want to sow to the lust of the flesh if you want to sow to the desires of the flesh if you want to sow to entertainment enthusiasm around certain things then you're going to get it back in kind and so maybe that helps us sometimes well where did they get that from well maybe from the siege you so there's a lot of ways that we need to recognize that even god in the beginning made those that the man would have power over made them and i want you to think maybe very deeply about this made them to receive seed and produce whatever you sow into them that's the way that that's the way that it was made in the creation so whatever we put into them we're going to get out of them and so the bible this is to me kind of maybe closing the loop on the last time or at least catching some of these principles up the bible places the duty of training a child train up a child in a way that he should go places that duty to train them from the right things upon the parents he says well we send them to sunday school then they go into school they're only in sunday school for an hour if even that and then they go into school during the week monday through friday they're in the classrooms they're amongst their peers in the world and then they get no training at home at all is kind of what he said he talked about establishing a family altar again because that duty is on us the duty is on us as parents to emphasize the spiritual things because no offense but brother tucker carlson isn't doing it right all right neither is brother uh anderson cooper just to be inclusive they're not emphasizing they're not emphasizing spiritual things and so you're not gonna get the those spiritual things that you need it's gonna come from the parents and i was gonna mention it tonight i've kind of just rearranged some things but we spend less than three percent maybe even less than two percent of our time in church listening to preaching so where else are you gonna get it where else you're gonna get that that right kind of emphasis so now i want to look at not being an example and in using this phrase of not being an example what was kind of another way of saying is just a bad habit would be being a bad example and a couple wednesday nights ago we used the contrast of fate of godliness rather as being the um the contrast to uh being a bad example or not being an example brother i said godliness is to be like god and so reading from a stretch of a perfect man he says but you know what godliness meant you've sang the song to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him all through life's journey from earth to glory i only asked to be like him now this is you kind of have to think um you have to kind of meditate on it to catch the one of this these another layer to the principle anytime you look at the word of god you should look at it as if it's 3d and look at it to where it pops out at you because there's dimension to it there's there's ways of viewing it and so we think oh well to be like jesus that's to be godly but what did it mean to be like jesus in another sense he says that's godliness when he was smitten on the cheek when he was smite on the one side of the face he turned the other when he was spoken rough to he didn't speak he didn't rile back so one thing we could say is he didn't let the actions of others dictate his actions as he didn't respond in kind so that's one way that we realize that we can be godly and that's one way that we can be an example to our kids and since this is pretty much turned into a cathartic confession hour for brother aaron one of the things i don't like when i do it is whenever my kids act immature and i just do it too to make a point but i think i'm just reinforcing what they're doing they're like well he's 47 years old and he's doing it like finally dad gets it he's acting he he's acting just like me and so sometimes we if they go nanny boo boo we want to go nina back and what we're doing is we're kind of mirroring their behavior and we may accidentally be reinforcing it when we're trying to get them to recognize how wrong it is but we haven't accomplished that at all so one way that we could uh take from being godly is to not let the actions of others especially our children dictate to us our response in terms of meeting their immaturity being riled against riling back speaking loudly speaking loudly back in that sense but he says godly always looking for one thing so here's the secret i always do that which pleases the father he says yes sir always that's godliness now how could we expand upon that scripturally god this was he said i only do that which the f with the father has said i like what i say what i see the father do i do likewise so godliness is following the right example amen therefore if godliness was achieved by fall in the right example by doing what pleases the father jesus did what the father demonstrated god then was the example of godliness and christ therefore himself kind of followed that example and so that's where i it really inspired me to look at godliness in the way of i want to be following the right example and if i do that then i can be setting the right example myself that's uh that's the should be the aspiration of every parent especially as fathers is that we are have the headship of christ and having hit that headship we can reflect the right things in our family so i want to join these two things together the carnal things and the bad example uh being bad examples and this is where we come up with emphasis by example bad habit is to emphasize carnal things and another bad habit is to not be an example so the carnal things and bad examples i'm coming up with the subtitle of emphasis by example now this is i'm going to say this at the outset and then hopefully this could just kind of open up your minds and you said you could say brother we know where we're going we know we're going let's just get out of here before in and out closes and because i think this should make the point right here our emphasis will dictate their attention what we emphasize is going to determine what their emphasis is we could do a little experiment right now we won't do it because chances are when you do it cold and you don't test for it it doesn't turn out right but i'm pretty sure that if we had a toddler here and i put the bible on a chair and then i put a cell phone on a chair which one do you think they're going to grab this is a thought experiment they're probably going to grab the cell phone and you might say oh because it's shiny and it's new no it's because it's what they see in your hand the most right it's true there's a lot of things that we that we are doing before our children and doing so it it sets a precedent for their behavior and so our emphasis is going to even determine their attraction what you look at what you watch what you listen to what you admire what you promote what you talk about is getting their attention and and this is not in any way trying to establish some sort of precedent but obviously if this was never laying around they wouldn't grab for it so now you know this is what i look at when i'm up here is my the time uh wouldn't have been awful if that switched to something else and like my brother aaron's following the basketball score uh that would have been really awful but there shouldn't be any other apps open on this phone right now i did have the song app here so we keep our we have our music here but if that was never even laying around they wouldn't be drawn to it but it's the things that become familiar to them so i would say this as a way of just getting your thoughts in the direction that i'm pondering this on the emphasis and example our behavior signals value to them how we behave what we promote what we lift up is signaling value to our children now in john chapter 10 verse 36 that that's kind of just getting you thinking where i'm going and i may not be able to get to that spot until later but john chapter 10 if we could go there verse 36 now i'm now just right into my subject matter this evening and feel very comfortable and so we'll uh we'll start kind of from the beginning and but what i've just said is given the idea of what we're looking at brother jesus says this in john chapter 10 verse 36 say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world now i'm just taking a phrase out of this because he's saying you're going to say of him the one that the father sanctified and send to the world and then he expounds on the criticisms that they had of the one that the father sent but catch the way that jesus describes the father he says or of himself but in doing so kind of highlights an attribute of the father say of christ whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world what has he just done he's told us something about the characteristics of god saying something about fatherhood that the true reflection of fatherhood is that god sanctified his son before he sent him out and so this is a reflection of true fatherhood because training children is the process of sanctifying them before we send them into the world uh the process of child training isn't trying to figure out a way or trying to get them out of the house as soon as possible nor is it trying to figure out a way to where they never leave right and there's ways that i'm starting to recognize that little eliza is being so helpful around the house and thinking how can we keep her here for all her days but that's not the goal the goal is not just to keep your children at home but the idea of fatherhood is the father has sanctified his son and sent him into the world christ is identifying that you're saying this of christ and he kisses this is what you're saying of christ who was sent into the world but he wants us to understand some nature of the father and this is where i may be kind of getting into the face of the men tonight a little bit addressing you not confronting you but uh of this he says it in a way to say this is what a real father does before he sends his son into the world he sanctifies him first matthew chapter 10 verse 16. he's jesus did that which pleased the father and demonstrated what the father demonstrated he says behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves thanks he says be there for wise as serpents and harmless as doves so as christ was sent he now sins and because because christ is sending he has an obligation to train he says it in luke go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves it's quite an extraordinary statement that one who has trained somebody is telling them you're a sheep but i'm sending you in the midst of wolves but then has confidence that he's trained them in such a way to where they can navigate it without getting eaten you realize that that's the real nature then of christ reflecting his father his father sanctified him and sent him into the world now as a master as a teacher just during his short time with him he said i'm going to send you a sheep into the midst of wolves wolves eat sheep in case we didn't know that wolves eat sheep they're gonna tear them limb for limb but he says be harmless as serpents and wise as doves take what i've given you and you'll be able to navigate a world amongst wolves and because he knew what was ahead he prepared his disciples likewise as parents because we know what is ahead we must prepare them we must equip them for what is ahead that's right because we know as parents we've lived it one of the things one of my ideas in the uh under the subject of withholding grace is completely forgetting what it was like to be a child forgetting what it was like to be one of them that there's a uh there should be some empathy because we've been there before maybe we could just signal that to our children one time or let even right now to let them know jack i was seven years old at one time did you know that yeah elliott i was 14 before i i've been there and they're like really because one of the fun things with kids is trying to figure out you know the relationships because they just think that mom and dad were always together and all of a sudden they start realizing wait a minute your mom's different than his my wait how did this all happen right they try to figure that all out but sometimes it's good for us to remember we were that way one time and so we we know what is ahead and because we know what is ahead we must prepare them for what is ahead we must equip our children for what is ahead and if i could say this out of love to our children our young men and the young ladies here a lot of the things that our parents are saying and doing on your behalf isn't because of so much what exists now in your lives but what is ahead for you and we want to be sure that we're emphasizing the right things and promoting the right virtues and actually preparing you for what the world would want to do to you and now in john chapter 17 verses 17 to 19. now watch how jesus comes back to this he says you're saying this of christ whom the father has sanctified and sin to the world so we know that god as the ultimate parent as the extreme parent sanctified christ before he sent him into the world and now watch christ as he said i'm going to send you a sheep in the midst of wolves he says sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth so he also is praying that they would be sanctified he says as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world now that we could take this very literally that if god sent christ into the world under one way then he's also going to christ must do the same thing when he sends his disciples into the world so what does he say verse 19 and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth now this is coming to the real heart of what i want to emphasize tonight is he's he doesn't just tell him hey i'm going to send you into the world and you better live clean i'm going to send you in the world you better not sin in the world you know better not be like the world you better not do this you better not do that but he's saying that i want i must send them into the world and as the father sanctified me they need to be sanctified also and so in order to sanctify them i'll sanctify myself i like it here he's laying out this principle they must be sanctified and so the work of sanctification wasn't so much rolling the sleeves and get over here boy and we beat the devil out of you but it was sanctifying yourself first that's how you really cast out spirits that's how that's how you really deal with certain issues is let's start with ourselves so we can do all this tonight say lord i'm here with a rake not a pitchfork i don't even know if the neighbors in the apartment next door are here tonight it's just you and i'm gonna take this into my heart whether i'm a single parent whether i'm a mother raising my children by myself this is gonna be instructive to me and lord if my children must be sanctified then i must sanctify myself first and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they might be sanctified through the truth i hope to emphasize this for the remaining time that we have together this evening but if that could really drop in your hearts as a revelation behavior changes across the board the things that you may feel that you have liberty to do as a father and the liberty to do as a parent you immediately begin to think whoa what would this mean to my children and so this is an example such a beautiful example of our taken responsibility for the sanctification of those we are leading just as christ was leading his disciples first respect reflected in how god dealt with his son now christ sending his disciples out into the world we one day are going to let our children go we're going to let our sons leave and cleave to their wives we're going to give our daughters away to another man and when we do we want to have sanctified ourselves so that they likewise were sanctified and so this is an example of us taking responsibility for ourselves because we have a responsibility to sanctify those that we are leading in training brother braham says it this way on christmas day in 1960 god's wrapped gift he says i think one of the most pathetic words that jesus ever said was when he said father i sanctify myself that they might be sanctified now it's curious that he says pathetic but kind of enter into what he's trying to say in other words he had a right he was a man he had a right to be to a home he had a right to a family he was a man as much as man as you or i am as much human in his manhood as we are he had a right to it but he was training 12 men that were going to take the gospel to all the world so he sanctified himself for their sake i sanctify myself for their sake a gift of god keeping himself sanctified he had a right but he sacrificed those rights for somebody else's sanctification this is the example of christ we have rights but we sacrifice those rights for the sanctification of others remember this that sanctification requires sacrifice isn't that right it was in the it was in the sacrifice that things were sanctified so again even in the type of our lives if i'm going to if i need to sanctify those that i send out if i'm going to have a responsibility for my children that i have to sanctify myself and my sanctification is going to require sacrifice of things that may be my right let me say this even things that you are that is your liberty and right uh as being a born-again christian that this is not uh is it gonna harm me this isn't gonna be wrong for me this is gonna be there's no law the prohibition against it but you recognize that for your own expediency but also for the example that you set before your children i as a holy spirit spirit-filled parent speaking on your behalf may be able to do things that you remain free from but it could expose somebody who doesn't have the holy ghost to influences that they don't know how to deal with and break free from and so it becomes very important that we sacrifice because sanctification requires sacrifice this is our responsibility as parents this is part of our job description is to be sacrificial and again just addressing fathers tonight i'd say this duty primarily or first rest upon fathers we have to be taking the lead not in rolling up our sleeves and beating the devil out of our children but likewise but ourselves ourselves being sanctified and first corinthians chapter 4 verse 2 it says moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful this is not just true of the stewards of the mysteries but rather of anyone that is a steward this is a principle of stewardship that if one is being given responsibility for somebody else they have what is called a fiduciary duty to them under the one that's put them in that place it's required of stewards that a man be found faithful catch this a steward is a ruler or head over something but it's also a steward in this sense is appointed to govern in someone's stead this is the way that paul is meaning it having oversight in the stead of the actual ruler or owner so to have stewardship means you are in the place of having headship or control over property or someone or something that is somebody else's so paul was saying the mysteries of god those are gods but we've been given stewardship over them so we are operating in god's stead over his mystery so think of this always as parents you may be leaders and you may be rulers as men you may be the head but it's actually in god's stead or having oversight over something that is the lord's your wife is wife says the lords your children are the lords they are the heritage of the lord so we must look at one another and as ministers we look at the sheep as being god's sheep not our own we look at our wife as being a daughter of god so we recognize the ownership is the lord's and i'm a steward in the office of husband i'm a steward in the office of the father of those who are the lords one thing that i use well i just honestly say god used as an example to me and as a young minister he had something happened to me and he spoke to my heart and he said you're nothing without me and i realized very very quickly that it's not about me and one of the best things i think you could speak to ministers is to constantly remind them it's not about you not about not about you and maybe we should all sing specials to one another it's not about you it's not about you preacher because it's not it's not about us the christian life is not about you christian life is about service it's about living for others it's not your selfish ambitions it's not what your testimony looks like it's about christ and his seed and it's a life of sacrifice then as parents and and especially again as husbands and fathers we first demonstrate what to do before we tell them what to do in other words we've kind of already led without opening our mouths we demonstrate what we want them to do before we tell them what to do in proverbs chapter 16 verse 12. it says is it it is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness for the throne is established by righteousness now just ponder that it's an abomination for a king to commit wickedness why because their throne their authority their power is upheld by righteousness if kings derived their authority from god if this was a divine right if god is the one that places the king in his position then unrighteousness essentially moves him out under the headship of god and it completely undermines their office so saying it's a king should not commit wickedness because his very authority his power and his position is derived from a righteousness that comes from god and so in order to have authority you must live correctly in order for your authority to be effective you must live correctly because true leadership true headship is by example leadership is never the function of domination of an imbalance of power leadership is never the function of just being able to manipulate or using harsh words it's not just by being strict or being a a dictator and taking advantage of people or having more resources and buying uh uh buying behavior or demanding certain things but the way that it ought to work in that mutual dependency is that one lives a righteous life and having been put in that position as a head or a leader or a parent then they have a kind of life that they're demonstrating before those that they're training and leading in this case a king who lives righteously his authority is not his own but it has the backing of heaven amen and so our authority within the home must be established likewise by example by righteousness notice how peter exhorts the elders and pastors he says in first peter chapter five verses one to four i'm wanting just to draw these types out of that relationship dynamic of one who is teaching one that is leading the elders which are among you i exhort whom i'm also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of god which is around the world via the world wide web feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly and there are there's two different ways that you can look at this that you're going to take oversight not constraining them right you can look at this not by constraining them but let it be voluntary let it be willingly but then also there's a way that this reads and i've seen it it lived out i i love to see a pastor who embraces his calling i i've heard pastors before kind of say well i'm you know if i didn't have to do this i would leave and you're kind of thinking i don't know if i really understand what you're trying to say you don't want to be here you know you don't want to be a pastor i love seeing pastors who have a pastor pastor's heart and they embrace that and and they give themselves to it so it's not even by constraint why i'm being forced to pass to you and i guess i'll just have to put up with you and i'm sick and tired of pastored people who don't have the love of god in their heart and you're just kind of up there because you're being forced to but you do it i'm willing to do this i want to do this i and i love to do this so there's so much mint in this and then not for filthy luke or not just because it's a paycheck but of a ready mind i think somebody accused me of coming here for a paycheck and the person they said it to says do you know what he does do for his day job and uh he says neither is being lords ex being lords that's where i wanted to get neither as being lawyer lords over god's heritage but being in samples to the flock and when the chief shepherd shall appear you shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away not as being lords over god's heritage but being examples to the flock and then also beautiful and so subtle and when the chief shepherd shall appear what is he reminding these guys of hey you're just in the stead of the shepherd if you're a shepherd if you're passionate if you're leading you're doing it as a steward on behalf of somebody else and he's coming back and he's gonna you're gonna have to answer for what you do and even christians are gonna stand before the bema and we're gonna answer to him whether we've done good and whether we or whether we've led right and led correctly and we're gonna be judged for our reward so he reminds the elders hey there's a chief shepherd so be sure you rule correctly so that you can receive the right kind of crown at your judgment feed the flock of god neither being lords over god's heritage but the examples don't stand over them telling them what to do but show them what to do because he says not being lords over them that's exercising power over them telling them what to do but be an example to them of what to do can i say something just to get your mind thinking a little bit the lord's really been dealing with on me this for some time this thought crystallizing but you know there's a difference between a groomer and a cultivator really what you think about this this isn't about people who groom pets this is this is even the language that we use in the world how people groom people to get them to do things that that they otherwise wouldn't normally do or take advantage of them and there's a difference between a groomer and a cultivator a man of god who cultivates you will always have an interest in what's best for you a groomer has no use for you when you can't do anything for them he sounds to be lords over god's don't be lords of god's heritage but be examples be cultivators not groomers and first timothy chapter three verses two to seven to me i think this just perfectly represents this because tim for the paul speaking to timothy likewise exhorting him to be an example of the believer he says the bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife now why would he need to be the husband of one wife have you ever thought about that because you teach your children never do such a thing as that and bring them up in the admonition of god what brother brahm said so god knowing that the perfect reflection would be that a man not just the preacher but the man would have one wife he likewise then teaching correctly if he wants to teach the flock correctly he can't say listen we're taught in the message of the hour brother bam said that you remain as you are but you teach your children never to do what you've done through divorce and remarriage so we're going to teach our children to do that then how hard would it be for a pastor who has with a woman who's not his wife but then has a living wife telling everyone listen don't do what i've done don't do what i've done and it's just almost like charlie brown's teacher right because these examples so loud they don't really get what he's trying to say it has to be by example so it says vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality apt to teach not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy looker but patient not a brawler my right not covetous one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity now i think we even touched on this recently on what it means to rule and and there's some that might think this is just get everybody under your thumb be have them in subjection but gravity means with all honesty and it it's the word actually speaks that which entitles a person to respect so you rule your house and you have your children in subjection because they respect you you have them in you have them in subjection with all gravity i even remember brother loyal one time when i administered there in minnesota there's a brother's breakfast and the question was being asked about you know what does this mean all gravity and ruling the house because the question kind of came up can does a man have a right to preach if his children aren't exactly serving the lord order they're doing this and they're doing that and and and i just in the fellowship we're talking about what it means and listen gravity holds you in your place it doesn't drive you straight plumbed through the earth's crust right gravity has a way of just kind of keeping you right i i still kind of have some movement i have some liberty but it's gravity that's keeping me tethered at least to something and so there's a there's a there's an image that's being expressed here to rule your house with all gravity it's it's a conduct and a behavior that has the respect of your children you haven't just locked them into something and doing it by force makes this beautiful statement in verse 5 for if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house doesn't say that he doesn't rule his own house but it says if he doesn't know how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of god in that we see the symmetry between the church and a home not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into condemnation of the devil moreover he must have a good report of them which are without let's default to reproach and snare of the devil in these things we could say that paul is telling timothy that a bishop must be blameless and he must do these things because his teaching his instruction will be undone by his example the way that he lives if he's if he can be blamed if he doesn't have good uh behavior if he's uh doesn't have good reporter then with her out if he's lifted up with pride all these things will undermine his pure doctrine his his instructions his admonitions everything he's trying to do it'll undermine what he's trying to accomplish in zechariah chapter 11 verses 15 16 and 17 we at our text which was kind of the which was part of the inspiration of recognizing bad habits of parenthood or bad habits of fathers that in the example that zechariah gives instead of saying show them what is faithful show them what is just but take unto yourselves the instruments of a foolish shepherd a shepherd is one as a keeper he's a feeder he's a pastor so we're using it as the image of one that leads or rules or teaches as us as parents we're leading our children as lambs we're leaving we or we could say goats as kids right this is what we're doing with our children we're leading them and then instruments are the tools that are used to do a job so these are things we're seeing it and a fool the foolish is here someone who's kind of anti-truth won't submit to truth doesn't take in to consider truth to be foolish here it speaks to someone who's combative or contentious they're undisciplined they're unrestrained and so he says and the lord sent to me take unto thee yet the instruments of a fool of shepherd for lo i will raise up a shepherd in the land which shall not visit those that be cut off i think we went through these before as a church last year about a year ago neither shall seek the young one nor hill that is broken nor feedeth that that standeth still well these are these are this is the real work of a shepherd it's not all wool and milk right right and all shepherds they're just going to fleece the sheep and live off their milk and eat their meat and have their wool and live live live with nice finery but this is the reality of a shepherd to visit those that are cut off to seek the young heal the broken feed those that are standing still can't move you you take care of these this is the true labor and the glory of pastoring and this is the real work of a parent this is and let me just say this as a way of encouraging all of you if you have children with you tonight i want you to look at your children and say god call made me for this if he gave them to you he's given you what you need to to raise them to teach them i i want you from this moment on to hear the voice of a man of god telling you you can do it you're called to it he wouldn't have given them to you if you couldn't he's equipped you has given you the things you need if circumstances in life have left you raising them by them themselves or without much means you can still do it god is the force multiplier his word is enough and he's going to give you what you need to get the job done and the rest is up to him and so he says instead of doing this but he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their claws into pieces and pieces woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock and this is the judgment to him the sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye and his arm shall be cleaned right up and his right eye shall be utterly darkened so zechariah is describing the work of a wise shepherd by saying what a foolish shepherd does not beautiful he's really we can look at this and and recognize what a wise leader will do a wise shepherd a wise father a wise husband a wise wife and mother these are the things that they'll be attentive to this is where they really engage it's not just all about uh the fat and the and the wool and tearing the claws in pieces but it's about these other things that's where real wisdom is manifested that's when the real work gets done he's saying that leaders who aren't willing to sacrifice aren't willing to be proactive aren't willing to sanctify themselves but indulge in their own desires they're the ones that lose the ability to lead their powers he says their arm being dried up their power their influence and even their ability to lead says they lose their eyesight that's what happens when you indulge yourself and don't invest in those you're tasked with leading your wisdom dries up your discernment dries up because then all of a sudden it's about you about what you get out of it how you look how you can live with all the fineries of life how you can do this and you could do that and you almost feel this is where the real danger is now i'm the head of this house and my children serve me and my wife says hold on buddy no wait a minute you serve them too you absolutely serve them too but whenever you just want to sit there and eat the flesh of the fat and not engage in verse 16 and do the things that you must do that's woe to that idol shepherd what you've done is you've left your responsibility to your family and you're going to lose your power you're going to lose your influence going to lose your ability to lead you're gonna lose your discernment you're gonna lose your wisdom and your and this is the caution and the warning i'm happy in the lord anyway right let's be happy tonight all things we try to teach our children first instruct them by example and then reinforce with words all things that we try to teach our children first instruct them by example and then reinforce with words what is the statement that is made by one of the early revivalists who said that to go and to turn the world upside down and heal the sick and raise the dead and preach the word of god and burn the fire you know the town on fire and use words with if necessary can't remember exactly how it's read but that's kind of the 2022 version of it i guess but the head of the house is a husband we put him in that place he's the head of the house but the head is figurative of a life-giver the head isn't the one that the life serves but the head is the one that is giving the life it's figurative of the source of life so therefore the life lived by the head is to flow down to the rest of the body it's the idea of the head being the source of life and if you cut off the head life is lost it's because there ought to be some this wisdom that's prevailing to the entire body life is flowing from the head that's the source of the virtue that's the source of the righteousness that's the source of the purity so in a lot of ways power and we've been doing this over the last several months or since the beginning power needs to be redefined i think nominal christianity has created the idea of a john wayne jesus it's a rambo jesus it's the rough man you know women in subjection and it's really it's really it is chauvinism masquerading behind a false image of christ it is a bigotry masquerading behind behind righteousness there's a real there's a lot of foul spirits that are masquerading behind the name of christianity and it doesn't line up with the word of god it doesn't line up with the message of the hour it doesn't line up with the bible and so true headship power being redefined headship is not bringing people to obedience or subjection by force but through respect because they see a life lived by the word and they're willing to honor that and they respect and it's mutual jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15 and i will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding this is a mouthful i'll give you pastors not the foolish shepherds but i'll give you pastors who have my heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding this is a persuasive love by a pure example that shows you the correct kind of life that's what's meant by a pastor after my heart it's going to be a persuasive love by a pure example that shows the correct kind of life shows the right way it's leadership uh it's not the beating it's not the flogging it's not the abuse but it's the right kind of leadership to bring them to the the folds to the places of feeding and resting and drink in order to just produce bear the wool that they're ordained to bear and i say this to fathers and husbands but likewise just to parents we must be willing to do our duty first as shepherds upon whom the sheep depend those of us who have the holy ghost recognizing our children not yet having it therefore we're examples as shepherds with the higher intelligence to guide them and to lead them as they as children who depend upon us i believe brother ben taught that the husband is a spiritual pastor to his wife to the home the wife is called the fifth gospel she's a pastor to her little kitties there she is an image of an associate pastor within the home so his pastors the the fathers described as a priest within the home being pastors and priests of the home who lead by example and not by authority or force coming back to we are stewards we should view ourselves as stewards of god's heritage amen those are god's children that should moderate all behavior that's god's daughter that should moderate all behavior these are god's people that moderates all behavior because we have a duty to our spouses we have a duty to children we have a duty to one another in jeremiah chapter 10 verse 21 for the pastors are become brutish and have not sought the lord therefore they shall not prosper and all their flocks shall be scattered why are the sheep scattered it's because of the behavior or the one that leads it says the pastors have become brutish there's certainly a way that we could maybe try to describe this in such a way to where the pastor's a brute he's overbearing and he's rude and he's mean and he's offensive but really to be brutus means unreceptive become dull-hearted in other words they get to a point where it's almost as if they're numb they're not going to respond to you yeah hey call email try to reach out try to get home they're not going to respond to you they can't be touched they can't feel true they become unresponsive to your needs they become unresponsive to what you're really going through they're not concerned about you anymore they become brutish they don't have to come off as these loud railing mean offensive brutes it just means when they disengage they ghost you spiritually almost they're not responsive to your needs anymore they kind of write you off or cut you off there's this distance that i said that's what a brood is that's when someone becomes brutus they don't feel for you anymore they don't care for you anymore they're not concerned about you anymore wow pastors become brutish and that's what scatters their sheep in colossians 3 19 then look at the husbands the role of a husband husband love your wives and be not bitter against them that's angry don't be irritated or harsh towards them as husbands we have a responsibility to be the sanctifying stabilizing force for them love your wives and be not bitter against them you can't be to be angry to be irritated to be harsh towards them you're sowing seeds of harshness because women are going to receive seed and produce what you sow into them and it's just the nature of a woman to do that so if you're sowing anger you're sowing irritation you're sowing harshness then your bitterness against them is gonna breed the same in their hearts so we have a responsibility to love then to the children in colossians 3 21 fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged i'd love to amplify this more but it says we have the capacity to provoke our children to anger so therefore we're being warned not to do it right in other words if i could say this way you paul recognizes that though we're filled with the holy ghost there's still a base instinct that resides within our spirits that we've got to be cautioned against don't lead incorrectly don't provoke your children to anger because if you do it discourages them and this is teaching to christians this is teaching to those who have the baptismal ghost it's something that we have to yield ourselves to don't provoke your children to anger lest they be discouraged so we can anger them and provoke them to anger and it's through our provocation that they become discouraged we are the cause of their anger we are the cause of their discouragement we can produce the frustrated and patient spirits that we often encounter and we're the ones that were sowing the seeds is anybody longing for the song service all of a sudden i'm just looking at it looking at another page of notes and i'm glad the worship was just so wonderful uh i don't want to belabor it tonight i'm doing it at least with a smile right that's a that's an improvement for me i want to i want to touch on something very quickly i think it's good to do this in this context hopefully it won't be too long it's 8 27 and so you know exactly what time it is you don't have to look at your your apple watch ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 wives submit yourselves into your own husbands as unto the lord so it gives this requirement wives to submit to their husbands so we could recognize this there's some submission i'll say this and again i think i'm getting pulled into this just to amplify it more the requirement of children to obey their parents is different than the requirement that wives obey it's a different word that is used and it's a wife acknowledging her own rights as a christian and she's voluntarily yielding to be a co to be a co-parent to be a co-worker together with the man it's a beautiful a beautiful image of taking her power her equality and joining it together with the man whereas children are told to obey their parents it means just to submit because that's what you must do in the lord it's right but it says wives submit yourselves into your own husbands as unto the lord brother brad i'm picking this up in revelations chapter four part three the sermon he preached she says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord because he is your lord and we get the loudest of the amens from the men and how many knows that you women and the loudest of amens from the women he said that's exactly right the bible said so at the beginning it's still that way why submit yourselves unto your own husband as unto the lord so this is scriptural this is the principle in scripture now there's another part to this so that if you have fathers that provoke their children to anger and the father can cause their children to be discouraged and angry that creates a a difficult dynamic between father and child but then also the husbands can be bitter against the wives that's going to produce a nature within the wife as if it was brother paul lafontaine who first made the statement and it really stuck with me that a man's sinful tendency is to be harsh and that a woman's sinful tendency is to resist headship and just look at how those two play together right if my tendency is to be harsh as a man and a woman's tendency is to be i resist headship as a woman both weaknesses provoke the other right i'm going to be harsh and you're going to say no i'm not going to submiss like well i'll be harsher right because it just it provokes it and they both get polarized right because i'm harsh and i won't submit and you want to make him submit right to harshness to authority to force never work that way because it feeds her sinful tendency and so when the wife is asked to submit to her husband says unto the lord brother branham says husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself forward he says don't run over her if you do that you're not fit to be a husband so it's not running over them to get them to submit yeah my wife is underneath me yeah she's paralyzed you've run over her she's got no more function anymore she's you've completely robbed her of life and spirit you've broke her that's not submission that's being paralyzed says don't run over if you do that you're not fit to be a husband that's right because this is this is the dynamics we're talking about and i wanted this quickly matthew chapter 9 verses 7 and 8 they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he said to them moses say moses let you divorce your wives because you have hard hearts this is the truth moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so do you recognize then why moses was put in a position to give a rid of divorcement to the men because of the hardness of their hearts the harshness of their hearts that was the reason for the divorce it's not even that well you had a right to you had a good reason to no is because the man being unwilling to be sensitive the man being unwilling to be forgiven because he says from from the beginning it wasn't so i'm going to restrain myself not to go deeper into that but notice what god says in malachi 2 16 for the lord the god of israel saith that he hateth putting away god hates divorce he hates it he says for one covered violence with his garment in other words a man's violence is exposed and in the putting away of his wife saith the lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit right notice what he had approaches the spirit of the man who puts away divorce he puts away his wife and divorce because god hates it and he says take heed to your spirit that you do not treacherously deceitfully offensively or faithlessly and what causes hearts brother branham says in thinking man's filter he says see the woman sees she reverenced her husband reverence her husband then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a son of god this is the beautiful balance that we must catch in this because it's wives submit to your husbands but it's it's it's not just all on the woman but the man ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a son of god this is the leadership by example this is the example that we said this is ruling your family with all gravity with an honesty which entitles a person to respect and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of but when it's a man that is a reverend man reverent and clean when his wife is before his family he's a real servant of god then the woman children all should respect that servant of god with reverence i know he's lifting up an ideal family i believe that we ought to recognize in our families we should view one another in our families or at least our goal is to be equally yoked in faith and experience in the word of god that's where these are two omnipotents meeting in a marriage the wife is loved by the husband he's uh he he's doing exactly what the word says she's willingly submitting because he's the kind of man that she would reverence as a son of god that's the beautiful dynamic in dynamo of a family because what pick up in verse 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it so you're to love her as christ loved her and the love is sacrificial why because sanctification requires sacrifice that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word in order to sanctify and cleanse it it takes a sacrifice yes sir he gave himself and because he gives himself to sanctifying cleanse he can nourish and cherish love your wives even as christ loved brother abraham said of christ there's the man he says and i believe i don't have these there my next scripture's proverbs 29 i just have these here in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcame hell in the presence of the grave you overcame the grave all by the word and humility it wasn't by the word and a hard heart i was like man jesus was gangster no it was all by the word and humility all by the word and human oh my he says there's the real man there's the one to make your example this is our example of manhood this is our example of sending out it's our example of discipleship it's our example of training it's the example of taking our children under our tutelage and train them and then sending them out in the world i want you to be sanctified when you go but if you're going to be sanctified when you leave i myself must also be sanctified this is the measure of the complete man this is the man that we as men ought to aspire to be there's the real man and it's the word and humility brother man said a man ain't measured by muscles that's a beast a man's measured by character to sanctify and to cleanse i'm wanting to give the image of emphasis by example here are the parents here's the man sanctified brother man said is a compound word which means cleansed and set aside for service it's preparation it's not just subjection it's not just order for the sake of order but we sanctify ourselves so that we can be put into service and then i sanctify myself for their sakes that they might be cleansed and prepared for service these young men right that can do this they can wiggle their fingers these young men are going to they're at the very doorstep of service they're they're they're not the church of tomorrow they are in church today learning today jack you've got it down too you can do it and so there's a they're being instructed now they're learning now they're growing now and what are we doing we're sanctifying them and we're preparing them for service listen i i take great joy knowing that there's not one word wasted that i preach over this pulpit there's not one effort wasted by the parents who do the right thing listen young people your baptism of the holy ghost is coming and you're gonna stand one day and you're gonna testify of a ceiling of god of a face-to-face experience with god this message is gonna become a reality this christ that you hear about this one you want to know this real genuine christianity is going to get a hold of you one day and you're going to be testifying because what we're doing is preparing you for that service and this preparation is not by force it's not by advantage but by example by christ's example can i leave just one more with you proverbs chapter 29 verse 12. this is another one's coming like why if a ruler hearkeneth to lies all his servants are wicked amen you're thinking brethren is that really in the bible well just turn there let's find it i mean i found it think about this it's in one of those spots of just the one-liners yeah if a ruler hearken to lies all his servants are wicked the conduct that we initiate and cultivate is what's going to prevail in our children if a ruler hearkens the lies it corrupts his servants if you're subject to them if you're the purveyor of them if you're susceptible to them and you express them that's why we have to take such great care i i mean this very sincerely as your brother we need to be very careful the things that we repeat right that we're pulling off of facebook we pull off we pull out of the off the web and and the things we hear that people talk about and we spread things and we say things and you got to be careful if you become susceptible to lies and the spreader of lies your children will be wicked specifically speaking to the nature and character of a parent a ruler a leader if a ruler is susceptible to lies and lies himself it corrupts his servants it's leadership by example you could try to tell your children this message is the truth this message is the truth christ is real this message is the truth but if you yourself do not receive it and do not live it then they will likewise have the hardest job of receiving it themselves how many people do we know and it doesn't justify the people but how many people do we know that have walked away from truth because of hypocrisy and and then we hear about it and we're coming yeah well you know i guess i can't really blame you because there's been a lot of it then let's not be them let's not be the hypocrite this message is real it's true but i don't want to live some man's interpretation of it i don't want to live some fantastic idea of it i just want to be subject to the christ that it reveals and live it in the spirit that it was given and there let the leaven be removed from it let the hypocrisy be taken from it for ruler harkens the lies of servants are wicked it corrupts so i'll tell you a story that brother branham tells in his honesty and it's those lawyers that did it to him and he was going through that lawsuit that thing with the irs the message total deliverance i'll just read it to you he says i know that i did wrong i lied caused my wife to lie now this is where really god's prophets make no mistakes so how are we going to get past this right well he said he was wrong but he wasn't so he was wrong well no no he's just okay all right i know that i did wrong i lied because my wife caused my wife to lie there it is i lied and caused my wife to lie i believe i told you about it here at the church is a few days not long ago it's been about six weeks ago the attorneys had me so tore up over this investigation till i hardly knew where i was at i just went home from the office to eat dinner and the private phone number rang and meeta went to answer the phone she put a hand over it and said now let's just think about this all right think of how small this would be to us we wouldn't have a problem with something like this it's them attorneys again i said i couldn't stand it another evening my head feels like it's going to go i'm losing my mind just pulling me this way and that way and this way i can't stand it and i jumped up and i said tell them i'm not in here and run around behind the house now you know how you know how i know a lawyer caused this that's a very loyal way to handle that right technically i wasn't in the house i had run around back i tell the kids sometimes on our way home i say hey let's run by mcdonald's real fast and they're like yes nuggets right and so we get close to mcdonald's and let's go and we go by real fast and like wait a minute i thought we were going to freddie's yeah we went by it real fast so he says i tell them i'm not here and run behind the house he says when i came back and i want you to catch this too meat is very conscious of those things so god gave brother branham a wife who was sensitive who's conscientious a compliment to him in his ministry she met me at the door half crying and said bill was that the right thing to do you know how you are i know how i am i said sure i wasn't in here right then i knew god had condemned me for it i said i wasn't in here right then she said but you was in here when he made the call that afternoon i went to pray for sick baby before i left the house the phone rang again and little joseph run over took a hold of the phone and hold it there by john and said no we'll go back oh we ruined it oh well sorry all right well let's just start all over i went an hour and fifteen no john it's okay but what do you think joseph said what did he say he said joseph gets you the next slide joseph says daddy you want me to tell them you're not here probably didn't even have enough respect to cover it up and whisper it dad it's those lawyers again you want to run around the house right the lawyers are like what tell him to run around as much as he wants we're building them by the hour by the minute oh daddy you want me to tell them you're not here and this is brother brown's words you see how sin corrupts what honesty of a of a father to take the responsibility himself you see how sin corrupts what a family that would finally be he's asking the question what kind of family would my family ultimately be if that's the kind of example that i set and i'm never able to say i'm sorry son that was wrong wow yes sir so it's not that there's even a loss a brother man blind it's the end of everything he's lost confidence no it gave him an opportunity to have the right emphasis by example and say i was wrong i should have never done that trick but recognize how brother branham is drawing from a scriptural principle that if he resorts to lies it'll corrupt his family it's our emphasis by example yes sir god bless you this evening could we bow our heads in prayer i want you just to be very sober as we close it's 8 45 i've been too lengthy for a wednesday night heavenly father lord we're we're still setting in just with our heads bowed our hearts open and lord we say forgive us father if our example hasn't been right lord let us have the humility as the prophet did just recognize that the corruption that i see in my home i take responsibility forward and i do not do it despairing lord i do not do it fretting and anxious and fearful i do it knowing that if it came by me it's going to leave by me that i'll sanctify myself lord i'll do it lord i'll do it for my children's sake amen lord as we had labored for part of the day in preparation to emphasize more on just specific things we could do to promote spiritual values i just was turned in this direction tonight i i thank you for such a lovely audience that would patiently listen and hear and want to catch your heart beat lord your principles not just the the things that i'm saying lord but they want your heart and i pray you bless the parents bless the single parents bless the young men lord bless the young ladies desires to be married and have children bless the families who are in the throes of a warfare within laodicea that buffets our minds and it it's so combative lord in the world and we want our homes to be that quiet resting place that you promised us and i pray lord you'd have such a grace tonight made the preaching of the word i pray that it has washed us lord i pray that it has as it's supposed to kind of swung our minds lord to the right things and now lord in this presence and with this atmosphere and with our minds aligned to the word lord we receive you in the name of the lord jesus christ lord we do it personally we don't do it selfishly lord but we do it personally we say lord i've got to be the man i'm supposed to be lord wash me sanctify me lord i want to be the woman you want me to be lord wash me sanctify me we purpose in our hearts lord to sanctify ourselves for one another's sake lord my heart was so full to share things at a bible study with the young people on monday circumstances just turned a little bit we didn't have a part way to share it but lord i wanted to share some of these very principles to them how they in themselves are reflecting to one another what's right in forming a basis of judgment and discernment for when they go out into the world and lord if we as young men don't treat these young ladies right they're not gonna know when they're in the world that they're being mistreated let it start with us lord please let it start with us lord we do need your help we need your grace so all we can say is lord here i am send me lord purge me cleanse me i want to do what's right bless your people i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen stand with me today
