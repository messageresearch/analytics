TRANSCRIPT
========================================
or we could say the jewish church ages and he revealed christ revealed the mystery of god no matter how much the jews thought they knew him when christ came he was the very revelation of god brother man said god was manifesting himself before the ending of the jewish dispensation so i'm wanting to look at this in parallel our type for our time that in the climax of the jews his this coming he came in the climax for the jews it was the crowning of what the prophets prophesied what the prophets wrote you put it in this way it was their capstone not in the sense that they had a literal capstone but just in the sense of it was the crown in culmination of the old testament so we could use this language to say the old testament became a new book the scrolls became alive the scrolls are living and breathing and in galatians chapter 4 verses 4 and 5 it says but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem that them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons this is speaking about israel when the fullness of time was come at the end of the jewish ages uh we could say the fullness of time we think about gentiles no or we think of the end of time no this is specifically for the jews it was the fullness of the time appointed by god something started in genesis 3 15 and that very prophecy of a man born of a woman to crush the serpent's head it climaxes in jesus christ and it culminates the very reason why god called abraham in the beginnings this is the end of the jewish ages it says in romans 10 4 christ is the end of the law i want you to think of it this way christ was the mystery of the law all the law pointed to christ all the law uh was typing christ the sacrifices the feast days all these things pointed to christ we could say that christ was bound up in those scrolls he was he was embodied in it the very letters written in it and that's why we could say even today that when you read the bible you should see jesus christ in every verse because he was bound up in the writings he was bound up in the law and the prophets he's rolled up in the scroll as we've been using that language and so the scriptures were made flesh in jesus christ the old testament was made flesh in jesus christ he was the revelation of the i am to israel that's what we're continuing on i am an open book now this we're just jumping right into this and this is um i would say i don't mean this maybe in a disparaging way or even in a um crude way but this is upper level message uh teaching if i could say that that i'm wanting i'm gonna be using a lot of statements and lengthy statements um from brother branham in the sermon question and answers on the seals and you kind of have to have an understanding of what this brother branham taught um and so we're reinforcing a lot of things that we believe today but to review a few statements that we've used already but since the open of those seven seals this is in god's power to transform he says since the open of those seven seals of them angels just beyond the mountain yonder this has become a new book so he's saying the seals have been opened right because all seven seals are opened uh and everything is ready to those who can receive it so we believe that and he says that in doing so the bible becomes a new book so in referencing those scriptures he's taking what is represented uh as john is caught up in the spirit of the lord's day in revelations chapter 5 verse 1 and he sees a book as it says i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written and on the backside sealed written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals so this book the scroll is sealed with seven seals when brother brahman says since the open of those seven seals he's talking about this sealed book and those seven seals being loosed and the one that opened it is christ as it says in verse 5 and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof so as you're reading six seven and eight and you find the opening of those seals and the loose end of each one of those seals but this is what brother i'm saying has happened if john saw if john was caught up in the spirit in the lord's day and he's he's seen these things literally happen and he writes it in symbolic form it's represented in symbolic form whatever was written whatever he saw now we're where we are today we're saying that which was referenced in these scriptures has been fulfilled it has happened and brother branham says in the message souls that are in prison now and we may come to it here soon on the prophet's prison ministry but he preaches the souls that are in prison now when the these seal seven seals were opened that opened up the entire bible so this is something significant to use that kind of language that now the bible became a new book and maybe you could say that to somebody in the sense i went over to israel and i visited these different sites and the bible became a new book to me it's a different kind of perspective it it broadened your understanding and people maybe could accept that but if you just try it tomorrow at work and just tell somebody that the seals have been opened and the bible's become a new book to you i'm sure you might be getting some very interesting looks or uh or someone may you may have some camaraderie with some people they may feel that they uh have seen the very opening themselves as well but brother man makes this statement when the seven seals were opened that opened up the entire bible the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and in these seven seals held the entire mystery of it this is in november of 1963 we're drawing heavily from christ as the mystery of god revealed you'll find there's this tremendous continuity between these two sermons and he says and it was the book of redemption new testament he says not the old it only proclaimed for the new testament so i think that's important to understand that the what's happening in the climax of these ages aren't the same things that climaxed at the end of the old testament we don't need to come as a sacrifice we don't it's not a one-man ministry there's just certain things that are important to distinguish when he says it's not the old it only proclaimed for the new testament it's the book of redemption so the seven seals being loosed the entire bible becomes a new book because it's revealing to us christ who is the old testament it's revealing this christ who is the new testament but these prophecies are specific to the thrust and the goal and the purpose of the new testament in that christ was the thrust the design and the purpose of the law there is a design and a purpose of the new testament it's to produce something it's to bring it to pass something the fullness of redemption so the fullness of redemption the second part of redemption is embodied in this in the seals the seals are contained the mystery of redemption and we're looking at the new testament so you kind of realize where i'm looking at why we spent the time looking at the old testament and christ fulfilling it because i'm not trying to hide anything you're the fulfillment of the new testament and by looking at how that christ came and fulfilled the old we're understanding this is what we've got to do ourselves and so brother man says now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament quite a statement and in harvest time and this may have been the last statement we used last time as noah moses and david reflected the coming of this perfect bridegroom and you could say not just noah moses and david but he's making reference to the old testament characters and their reflection and their types abraham even to joseph and these different ones they reflected they foreshadowed they typed the coming of a perfect bridegroom so as luther wesleyan pentecost reflected the coming of a perfect bride so the move of god in the church ages the bride in each age was looking was projecting forward and reflecting the coming of a perfect bride we've had churches churches brides brides we've had believers through all ages but there is something that they were projecting towards that's why it's even said that this is the golden age this is the age when all the prophets wanted to live that's because they were only foreshadowing and pointing to a time when there would be those even in the way that paul used that they without us could not be made perfect in these ages and brother branham and that's the new testament the new testament reflects this and i realize now that there's a lot of things i'm looking at and may have um it's at this point here i'm really i'm thinking upon reading it now that um i took what i was going to preach this morning and just moved it over to easter and so i thought no that's this is i could just see the lord building it to being just a wonderful easter appropriate for easter and so there may be some things that i've leaving out here that when you talk about noah moses and david we find that written in the word now where do we find luther wesley and pentecost written revelations chapter two and chapter three in symbolic form but they're there and so you see you see then even in that way that these these were written in the old testament but they're also prophesied of and written in the new testament and we have those things unfolding brother braham says the seven seals closes the new testament and sealed it up so it's the seven says it close up the new testament seal it up and this is what the uh open of the seals reveals is satan working down through the church ages and places each one of these churches in their position and it aligns certain things it's very wonderful to see how the word of god did that so now i can say this when i say i am an open book and and we've expressed it in the i am being god and how that he was shrouded in mystery and the the scrolls were mysterious and probed at and though copied they were misunderstood and though believed and adhered to a very festively by certain people it was interp it misinterpreted and traditions made it ineffective and then the i am became flesh in jesus christ he said before abraham was i am and the i am became an open book but i think when we first mentioned it to you the way that you took it is the way that i intended it that i am an open book and it's when you come to say i am i and my father are one when you come to the revelation understand that i am i am fulfilling the word of god i'm walking in the fulfillment of scripture and so i think that each one of you should come to the place to believe that god has called you to fulfill the word of god and that you're fulfilling a purpose in the word of god and so you can say i am an open book i am the interpretation of this sealed book and is that is that quite a statement you are an interpretation of the sealed book you are the mystery of god we say christ is the mystery of god revealed i believe the bride is the mystery of god finished and this is the mystery of redemption because there's two parts to redemption the purchase and the claim and here you are being claimed and and so uh this uh those are that brings us just right to what's in my heart for us to recognize our calling today now this is um where i'm going to begin to read several things and i don't know if the slideshow is working or not but i didn't have the slides completely in there but i give you the i'm giving you the paragraph numbers question and answers on the seals and um and starting with paragraph nine i'm going to be reading in this instance to paragraph 27. that may seem like a lot and it is a lot of reading but i've i've wanted to be able to do this for some time and these are principles that i know you're very familiar with but i love the opportunity just to go through the breadth of it as a church together on knowing that we'll be together again on wednesday we'll be together on sunday and if uh if the the rapture takes place then we're not going to care that we miss part seven right and so in question and answers on the seals he says and then also knowing that right among you things are happening that and he says i know that you don't see it that's uh significant here on march 24th in the morning before he preaches the seventh seal in the evening having just preached the sixth seal the day prior i'm just positive that you don't see it and you say brother branham that's a hard thing for you to say that i know it is but look let me just say this now i suppose this is just tapes for ourselves and so forth but let me say this that you don't get it and you're not supposed to get it and i think some people just stopped there and they never listened any further but what he begins to say is so important because he's talking about this is he's preaching the seals he's saying the seals are being open one one day after another very significant things especially if you go back and listen to sirs is this the time or is this the assigned to the end sirs and what he says there about the thunders and the revelations 10 and could this be the end and and this is this the end of my ministry all the profound significant things so now he's coming and he's doing he's fulfilling this what the prophecies were so this is a tremendous time and he says but let me say this now you're not supposed to get it so don't try to interpret anything don't try to put your interpretation to it you only get further away so when you try to put your interpretation to it you're going to get further away and and and maybe if we could just say even if you guessed it right if it's your interpretation you're getting further away because you're somehow going to take ownership of it and the real spirit of it's going to be missed and that's why we see the wisdom and the way that brother branham proceeded to preach the third pool in the open of the word is he he said it in such a way to where the elect will catch it and that and then where maybe a lot of things have intervened in the meantime as those who received it by revelation tried to get others to receive it by explanation and a lot of people like that's a good explanation that guy does a tremendous job explaining it and they walked away with an education of the explanation that was somebody else's revelation and they could never get to the manifestation because it was only impersonation in one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so it says don't try to interpret anything don't try to put your interpretation but you only get further away he says just take my advice and i'll take a prophet's advice if you believe me now if god has given me faith in your sight and you know that the revelations and things i've been here with you a long time and it's always been right and now to double prove it right it hooks right in with the word so you know it's thus saith the lord that's exactly it's proved to you now take my advice as your brother don't put your own interpretation to anything notice he's saying your own interpretation he's not saying in such a way to where there will not be an interpretation because we'll come to it later maybe wednesday night that he's talking about the seventh seal as it unfolds there's still a part that needs to be interpreted he never says it won't be he's just saying don't you try to do it don't put your interpretation to anything here's the key you just go on and live a good christian life because you'll only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it when you put your own interpretation to it and you don't continue to live a good christian life you're getting away from the real thing you'll only wind your way again away from the thing if i could say this the thing being the interpretation the true interpretation the reality of it he says and all of you so that's real important to keep keep in mind because you'll don't interpret it live a good christian life because if you don't live a good christian life you're going to get further away from the real thing it says and all of you are conscious and know that there's something mysterious happening and it is happening and i know what it is it's been told to you before so just don't try to put any interpretation but just believe me as your brother and listen to how he says this we're living in a great hour we're living in a time when the well we are well you just be real humble all right you think he wanted to say something we're living in the ti he says and we've already told you before i think what he's wanting to do is connect the dots explain it perfectly know what's happening and he's feeling this check in his heart he says well we're just well you just be real humble be a christian and try to live for god and live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you now when he says this i believe that he is using a tremendous amount of discipline to not try to say too much or explain things as he was cautioned not to do and that he is saying something that becomes a key to walking in the interpretation or walking in the unfolding or being in a position where you don't miss it and that you become he's wanting you to remain humble so that you can see these things he says don't try to make any you see you do you only make it a mysterious something and mess the real program of god up so if you try to make it mysterious you try to make something just any interpretation and you try to make it a mysterious something and you when you do that you mess the real program of god up now i want you to make the connection that the real thing the thing and the the mysterious things that are happening he's referring to the real program of god in the opening of the word these things that are transpiring so these things are connected together real be humble try to live for god live honest love those who don't love you um you just go on and live a good christian life and then he starts making some comments uh around paragraphs 14 and 15 or more 15 about how the these things that have been happening and he'll never get past it he'll never be able to uh forget the events that are transpiring this week and so he says in paragraph 16 and so but if the church he says you're not supposed to know these things so don't put no interpretation to anything and i do find that a curious statement but if the church you're not supposed to know these things when you listen to it when you ponder it um you wonder if he's referring there's supposed to know it or whether the people that are they're present there's certain things they're not supposed to know uh especially just yet as he said these things aren't revealed yet but it's moving into that cycle he says so don't put no interpretation to anything you just go ahead and just remember what you are told live a christian life go to your church be a real light wherever you are just burn for christ and tell the people how you love him and just let your testimony be with love all the time with the people now this is if i haven't hinted to it to this point let me just say that is the seventh seal i mean that's what he's pointing to this is exactly it's like he's found the perfect way to just come right out and say it without coming right out and saying it and he's almost saying in such a way to where it's like a little bit of a head fake people say you can't interpret this i can't tell you what it is but just go ahead and live the life of christ right because then you'll get it because if you could just live the life of christ because he is the seals he's the one that looses the seals it's his life that's made available so you just fall in love and live his life and you're gonna be the interpretation of it so he says and just let your testimony be with love all the time with the people because if you don't you twist yourself out into something there and then you're off the beaten track just love how the prophet's putting this and it's amazing how some people have actually read this and they got that got out the machete and just started carving their own path with this don't like the seals don't need the seals read it once close the book forget about it and just move on and it's like wait a minute you're off the beaten track he's actually telling us that this is the path of what's been opened up this is the real program of god because if you don't do that you twist yourself into something and you're off the beaten track you're off the path that is being made so he says so every time you try to do it you've done that so just don't try to make no interpretation every time you've tried to interpret and you've tweaked and you've left living the life he says you've gotten off the beaten path he says so don't just try to make just don't try to make no interpretation just any interpretation don't don't do that especially tonight when that seal comes up in front of you just don't try to interpret it he's talking about our efforts to interpret explains things he says just go ahead just go ahead and be just be humble and go right on with the same plain message and i'm reading this all together just to see how his how much he's emphasizing this on the outset of question and answers on the seals now you say brother branham is that we've been the church of the living god shouldn't we why can't i i ought to have he said he's it's kind of what he's looking at we're the church of the living god shouldn't we be doing this and we ought to have this and there's this idea of what it ought to look like and how it ought to be expressed and we be in the church of living god shouldn't we why can't i i ought to have and he doesn't answer it and maybe it's important because it needs to hit ev whatever bias is in your heart that you think the bride of christ should be doing whatever you think whatever our own interpretation is he says no no you remember i'm saying this for your good i'm saying it so that you'll understand if you believe me now listen to what i tell you he's sincere he's he's not playing a game with us but as a prophet he's got to be very faithful to what he has been tasked to do and he can't he can't say too much and if you recall we'll use maybe wednesday night i think we'll come to this where brother branham actually preaches the sev he's preaching the seventh century goes i've said too much i'm gonna stop the next day he records a different part to replace what he said why because he's like oh no i can't say too much i can't explain this and i tell you brother branham went through a lot to come to that place where he knew there was a price to pay and god trained his prophet and uh took him to the paces and the crises and the and the losses so when it came to this he couldn't miss being there and he couldn't mess the delivery of it he had to be faithful to it and he found one that was faithful and god found one that was faithful he says listen what i tell you now this is to me i'm going to take brother bram's advice and try not to interpret it to you or i'm not going to interpret it to you but i want you to i want you to think very deeply about what he's saying because he's saying there's something mysterious happening these seals are opening you you don't understand it i can't say too much but just live a christian life because that's going to be in the path that's that's going to be the program of god that's the real thing and he says so just listen to what i tell you you might be thinking oh we're the church of god we should be doing this but just listen to what i tell you and he uses this example now here now here's a post and we'll call that a listening post and it is a radio and there's warnings and things can be done through this listening post and you could even maybe look at this post right here there's things that can be broadcast from it there's things that could come out of it he says like a sword in your hand it can pick from evil or pick from a pick from the evil or pick from only as it gets its message so a sword can be used for evil it can be used for good a listening post can receive things that are positive or or are negative it says it can pick only as it gets its message the listening post now for instance to the ordinary man there's been so much cults and clans rise up over little outpourings of the spirit until people get all worked up in a bunch of stuff go out and start another little move and you know in things see you don't want to do that now he's described 60 years of message history people getting worked up in a bunch of moves and a bunch of stuff little outpouring of the spirit they become cults and cleanse there's people now that believe that god has revealed his name and who would have thought that that would have been the name of god you know if we had a million guesses we never would have come up with so many hard uh um sounds in the name like that but there's they sing in the name of these people and they worship these people and they bow down before them and it happens all over the place they've lifted up men they've lifted up there's been cults and clans they even do it with the message of the hour they do it with brother branham little outpourings and the people get all worked up in a bunch of stuff and starts another little move and people this is it this is the move this is going to be bring rapturing faith not not what brother branham said was going to do it this is going to do it he says now just remember just stay the way you are and you say well the lord showed no now just be careful we were talking about this with somebody uh last week and some people say god told me so much that they have they have more conversations with god than moses or brother branham he says now look here let me show you something did you know there's ten thousands of voices in this room right now literally voices of people that's coming through the electronic waves of radio it's absolutely beautiful how brother bran was trying to uh give the give the message without just coming right out and saying it because listen what are you saying why don't you hear them their voices is that right they're waving right through here now there's people forms and bodies moving right through this room now is that right well why don't you see them they're here actual voices like my voice well why don't you hear it it's got to strike something first to reveal it now do you understand and brother brandon probably said nope i mean just right but think of how beautiful that is how he's saying he's preaching things he's expressing things and he wants to come around and say certain things but he realizes i can't go too far i can't say too much so he says let me just give you an example moving through this room right now he's referring to radial radio waves or television waves and and how there's certain things and in certain spectrums and dimensions there's things that can be tapped into and that can be used to broadcast and he's saying there's voices like my voice there's bodies there's forms he says why don't you hear it or see it it's got to strike something first to reveal it so it's got to come to something then that's going to express it manifest it it says now do you understand so just don't interpret nothing if god wants you to know anything he'll send it to you so just be real real solid now hold still something has happened and now just be real you understand what i mean don't you so he's asking just be real solid he says don't try to make yourself odd to be a christian because you just take yourself away from god and if you understand it this is that third pool that should cause that should catch everybody that he's not varied from the path he hasn't varied from the program he hasn't varied from the manifestation and he just says be real humble be a real christian uh try to live for god live honest with your fellow man love those who don't love you live a christian life go to your church be a real light wherever you are just burn for christ uh live a christian life tell the people how you love him just let your testimony be with love all the time with the people you go ahead and just be humble go right on with the plain message just be real real solid now hold still because if you understand it this is that third pool he says you should have caught that the other day you remember there'll be no impersonation like there was of the other two so that's as far as you should know now just remember that you see now there's something taking place in this room so now he comes back to the listening post and the scientific the scientific analogy but now he brings it back to the spiritual supernatural happening this dimension this uh way opened up he said there's something taking place in this room remember he said just like right now there's bodies and forms in the room but now he said there's something in this room and there's something here there's actual in this room angel's voice of god if you can't hear the natural voice without something to send it out how are you going to hear the spiritual voice we're listening to the listening post something that that voice of god was striking to sound it out paragraph 27 we've read from paragraph 9 now to 27. now you might make that you might make believe that somebody is singing this certain song that might not even be there but when it actually strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike then it gives a true interpretation and vindicates it by showing the picture john wants us to draw on this now do we understand what's happening something happened it's got to strike the crystal and i want you to think even beyond brother branham speaking these things because something is there to strike the crystal something to reveal it to interpret it to bring it to pass there's something here he says when it strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike so elected ordained crystals that this revelation is supposed to strike then it gives a true interpretation and vindicates it by showing the picture now the spirit of god when it speaks through the true word it vindicates itself to show itself that it's right so when the true word strikes a crystal it proves it and shows it it shows the picture it manifests and when it speaks the true word of god when the true word of god is spoken it vindicates itself to show that it is right now that's don't try interpret it don't try to interpret it i i have it just highlighted for me so i can see it the number of times he comes back to it one two three four five six seven times glory that he comes to it he says don't interpret it don't interpret it don't interpret it now in john chapter 14 as we read this in our text i want you to recognize what christ is saying here i believe is thou not that i am in the father and the father and me do you believe that i am in the father and the father and me even if we can't necessarily be a paradox how both could be in the other he said the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work so there's the word and the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me but i'm telling you this so believe it or else believe me for the very work's sake now you could just believe him because he says it the father is in me he but he says the works that you see and that are made manifest are declaring to you something because it's this is following on show us the father and we'll be happy have i been so long with you that you don't you don't know who i am when you've seen me you've seen the father and he says have i been i've been witness i've been with you a long time you've seen my manner of life you've seen my burden you know my conversation you know how i treat people you know how i live you know how humble i am you know the love that i have for people you've seen my life if you've seen my life you've seen the father so then he brings it to this verily verily i said to you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also that's a mouthful he says the father in me that does the works and then he says this and greater work than these shall he do because i go unto my father that's that's that's prophecy of the end time these greater works now he says believe me when i tell you or believe the works in other words the works of christ well maybe there's a little bit of a jump here but it's retiring on the first four parts the works of christ interpreted the written word amen brother adam said jesus is life interpreted it's the life that interpreted it's not it's not so much the sermon on the mount it's not so much the parables but his life jesus's life interpreted because he says believe me for the very work's sake a work is a deed or a labor it's even used in the sense of business i must be about my father's business i must be about his employment but a work is also used in this sense of a deed of labor or something that's being done a business or employment but it's also the product that is accomplished look at the product look what's accompli look at the fruits of my life believe me for my product believe me for what's coming out of this the accomplish what's being accomplished and brother branham says he was the word made manifest he was god's interpretation of the word because he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me there you are he was the interpretation of the word so when he makes reference to his works or else believe me for the very work's sake because the works were interpreting the written word they had their scrolls he said search the scriptures this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears search the scriptures for in them you believe you have eternal life they are they that testify of me he was god's interpretation of the written word he says he was the interpretation of the word now in the message doors and door preached in flagstaff praise the lord that's where i was born he says he interprets his own words on april 16th he interprets his own words by making it live and vindicating it to be so you catch that it's worth writing down he interprets his own words by making it live and vindicating it to be so don't try to interpret anything don't put your own interpretation to it you only get further away don't put your own interpretation on anything so don't put no interpretation on anything just don't try to make no interpretation just don't try to interpret it so just don't turn up in nothing because god interprets his own word by making it live so just live a christian life just be humble love everybody live humble live live live live live live because god interprets his own word by making it live and vindicating it to be so just as christ's life interpreted the written word now that the seals are being opened the bible's becoming a new book he's saying that don't put any interpretation to it but as he continues to preach through 63 64 and 65 he's saying god interprets his word by bringing it to pass the manifestation is the vindication of the interpretation he's bringing it to we've got to realize this god interprets his word by making it live god said let there be light what does that mean the light shining that's what it means when god says let it be and it is that's the interpretation of what god said and i want you to think of this this is something that i i've just been pondering lately that's been really thrilling me that that the speaking that in the beginning god said that's divine the dysfunction of speech to clearly articulate a purpose and an ambition that has thought and it's caught let there be light that's divine so he interprets his own word by making him live and vindicate it to be so so he says my works testify the father my what i'm doing is interpreting the written word so the written word says a lot of stuff about the messiah and israel has all their thoughts on who the messiah ought to be and what he ought to look like but now he's actually interpreting the prophets so then you come to the forerunner and i love using this example because the forerunner now is very close he's very near the bridegroom he's the friend of the bridegroom and he even makes the declaration that thus my joy is fulfilled and he's happy to see the messiah with the people his own followers moving from the prophet to his prophecy he wasn't this was something he was glad to introduce and declare behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world follow him and many of his followers did but now john goes into prison and this is even a prophet's prison ministry this is his conjectures his thoughts his wrestling with the consequences now that some time has gone by john had heard and prisoned the works of christ now having read john 14 and these other things and knowing what we know we'd be like yes he heard he's got to be so happy right like this prophet must just be in there going you know what i don't care where i'm at i don't care what happens i've done it i've done good i wasn't just a runner i was a forerunner and he must have been so happy and he sent just two of his disciples he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another that's staggering i mean that really i want it to really get in your face that the forerunner john the baptist the one who saw these things prophesied these things announced these things the very forerunner is now saying well maybe i was building a platform for somebody else and maybe he's not the one and maybe there's another and i'm not so sure i'm not i just don't i'm just not quite sure how this is unfolding how this is happening this is the question that the prophet has and jesus answered and said to them go and show john again those things which you do here and see blind receive their sight in a lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me he says this because the interpretation was incongruent with the expectation it didn't it didn't fit now we're not just talking about you know the the the orthodox who are twisting their curls right and the jews that were pulling on their beard or whatever it wasn't the sadducees and the pharisees it was john the baptist who bypassed all the systems that foreign jesus christ jesus is saying he's offended he's identifying that john had an expectation according to the prophecy and the living interpretation of the prophecy didn't match his expectation they're discouraged if you want to listen to some very detailed things that brother branham says about it listen in 61 april 25th forgotten beatitude brother brown really gets into the thought process of them and it's remarkable it's striking how precise brother branham is about the feelings of john he says but he found out the works of jesus he was meek and lowly so it worried him he didn't know what to say he thought maybe something went wrong he's the messiah shouldn't he ought he shouldn't what this should be happening that should be happening but it was meek and lowly it was just real humble just real solid the works of christ were simple humble the ministry was very unexpected they the idea even to the scale that maybe some would have thought that the gift of healing ought to be made manifest where shouldn't he be emptying out hospitals shouldn't everyone at the pull of bethesda been healed but no it was just it was he's hanging out with publicans and and he's teaching things and he's his whole manner of life would just caught them off guard so now do you recognize how those two scriptures kind of begin to relate to one another and move against each other the works of christ testify of the father and believe me from my works and the forerunner is stumbling at the works he's offended by the works the manifestation the interpretation was offensive so brother branham is going to use this and in question answers on the seals i've skipped some and i just uh i did i just i originally maybe set it up so i would just read through it chronologically in order as he addresses this in question and answers on the seals but as i just labored and labored and you prayed god just worked things to where i wanted to present it to you this way i want to pick up on it wednesday hopefully come to the easter message on sunday that fits right into this theme but he's asked the question question answers on the seals it's question 22. paragraph 233 i think i have these paragraphs marked there um i'm going to be reading all the way to paragraph 265. would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture he says sure that's what's going on right now it is the message of the hour the bride of christ sure she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors that's the bride of christ now i know that uh maybe apostles prophets teaches evangelism pastors want to say glory to god stop there but there's more to it that's the bride of christ it's important for him to say that knowing what people would do with the message later so i i believe the prophet's not just stumbling on these things but this is the spirit of god leading him to be very precise yes the bride has a ministry and it it includes actual gifts according to ephesians 4. that's the bride of christ sure and then he's continuing he's still answering the question he goes all the way to paragraph 265 to answer the question she's got a ministry a great ministry it's the minister of the hour it'll be so humble and and maybe the minister should read to that part at least right before they stop and say praise the lord it'll be so humble now remember how many was here last sunday got some people raised their hands brother branham asked that for the people there how many were there on the 17th when he preached god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same so he's wanting to bring this thought up again about simplicity it'll be so humble remember god hiding himself with simplicity humility humble simple he says remember what i preached on humility oh don't forget that i'm going to stop a minute to warn that again remember when god predicts anything great to happen why is he saying this because the bride's gonna have a great ministry so he says when god predicts anything great to happen the people are looking so far away by their wisdom till they miss what happens i can draw from the fifth seal the sixth seal the seventh seal question um and uh the uh the breach and even god hiding himself simplicity where brother-in-law touches kind of on this similar thought they're looking so far by their wisdom they miss what happens god when god says anything is great the world laughs at it god says that's great and the world's like he says that bunch of ignoramuses he said that's what the world says the world looks at what god calls great and they say it's just a bunch of ignoramuses that's right but when the great world and the great high church said boy that's glorious god says a bunch of ignoramuses right you know tit for tat there there's so he's saying and this ignoramus is just it's no good it's it's dope dopey it's simple it there's nothing to it there's no wisdom there's no power behind it however each one they say oh this is great this is great and god's saying no it's not but when god says something great the world's like no that's not it he goes i don't mean it maybe of that way exactly that way but that's the way it is so we get his thought maybe if it's not exactly god calling people ignoramuses or the world calling god's things ignoramuses but he's just saying there's this derision and this criticism about what god does look here was a great holy orthodox church now the time is very very great we're doing really good on time so that means we might want to get another bottle of water ready because we're at home now we don't have to leave you all showed up thinking there was going to be a business meeting today that we were going to be here to at least for anyways thank god for uber eats if necessary he says here was a great holy orthodox church now listen to what he says because this is so important the bride's gonna have a great ministry remember what he just said in paragraph 26 to 27 or 9-27 we know the word we've got schools and we've got seminaries we've got our men so polished why for hundreds of years we've been loyal to jehovah we are the church we're the sanhedrin we got the council churches here both pharisees sadducees and all the denominations gathers up together he says like we're getting so now he's bringing he's showing the gathering together the collection in jesus day the type of today he says like we're getting we're all in the council church where are the big shots we know that scripture watch some little ignorant guy down there on the river with the beard hanging over his face and a piece of sheepskin telling us was he referring to john the baptist certainly they wouldn't listen to it but the bible said in malachi 3 the third chapter i'll send my messenger before my face to prepare the way for me 712 years before there the great prophet isaiah stood there and said so now malachi said isaiah said there'll be a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord and make his path straight that's right oh many of them said every high place will be brought down oh they said are you listening this is what they said when this man comes he'll point his finger and he'll move mountains and all the low places the ditches will be brought up and all the rough places will be smoothed out brother we'll plant corn in every field around here and oh we're going to do great things when this man comes they were expecting god to take the crank and turn it on bring the corridor down say come on down you great forerunner of my messiah and then as soon as he's done they pull it back up his ministry is over they crank it down again and put it right down here beside the seminary and say all right my beloved son walk down and tell them this is what they're expecting whether it be the forerunner or the actual messiah himself they have these great expectations of what the ministry is supposed to look like both forerunner and that which comes after it he says look when he come by whatever happened here came a man that knowed none of their schools didn't even have a fellowship card didn't have any credentials no nobody ever knew he ever went to school a day in his life and we'll skip some for time's sake and he begins to describe the ministry of john he used acts laid to the root of the tree and the vipers and he uses this language and how we dress and how we act a wilderness person and he was cut completely out of the the present day mold of what they would expect of the messiah suddenly he'll come to his temple and and to be of a certain lineage a prestige and brother bram describes the ministry of the forerunner and he says god in simplicity working in simplicity then paragraph 248 god in simplicity work and simplicity then the first thing you know he's standing there one day here's john the baptist he's standing there one day and he said yes he's standing in your midst he was so sure he was that runner and again i'm i'm i don't i'm wanting to preach a sermon entitled along the lines of was he a runner or a forerunner because if we're not careful we've made brother brown out just to be a runner i had something to chew on i believe he was a forerunner but let's not make him a runner but he does say he was that runner the forerunner he knowed who he was that's the reason he could shake the height off of him he said now don't tremble but just go ahead and continue on this is what he says listen what he's telling him don't tremble just go ahead and continue on you soldiers you obey your masters and if you've done any evil you take that what shall we do shall we quit doing this shall we stop doing this he said just go on like you are continue on continue on go ahead if you're raising potatoes raise them right he's saying this is what john the baptist said in his first coming you soldiers don't do no violence you do this and whatever it be just continue on as your obey your masters and so forth rabbi what should we do just continue on as you are but there's one in your midst that you don't know where that sounds really familiar where did we just read about this he realized the language he's using he's dramatizing it through john the baptist there's one in your myths that you don't know he knew the mess hour of his message he knew he was to introduce that person he knew he was there one in your midst you don't see him things are gonna going on you know nothing about there's something going to happen let me just find it where he says earlier there's something here something happening he's using the same language earlier but now he's bringing up the context of the forerunner john the baptist he says there's something going to happen he says you see and he will be here and i'll know him and finally one day he said behold there is there's the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world and he said now you have to catch this part this is very very important my time's up now i've introduced you to him i must decrease now i must go off the scene he'll take over from here the millennium will be right on away the time is at hand this is what john was saying the language to me is so uh direct so precise even as brother branham used the same things about himself how he must decrease i must decrease so he can increase and now this is the thoughts of john the baptist i'm done my time's up i've introduced him i gotta decrease i must go off the scene he'll take over from here and the millennium will be on right away the time is at hand so this is what john's expectation was then when he come john said he's good and this is john i'm just going to dramatize it john's over there whoo he's going to shuck the height off he's going to separate the wheat from the chaff he's going to burn it up he's going to thoroughly purge his floors with the fan in his hand because john's just like oh he's going to get him you're going to get what's coming to you you just wait till my messiah shows up he's gonna get you i mean he was excited about it right and he says but what was he little bitty so brother says little bitty it's a fragment now they had all drawed up and john the baptist is guilty as well according to what brother ram saying he will have a spear that will reach a mile long he'll stand back over here in palestine just stand up there in one of those little white clouds and pick up all these romans like this and cast them into hell just keep on doing that till he gets them all over why they had it all fixed up a messiah with a i've never come across in all the commentaries i've read maybe i need to ask some of my uh jewish lawyer friends i talk to your rabbis i want to know about this mile-long spirit i just pick up all the romans and flip them over into hell he says what it was was a little lamb come moving out among them meek and gentle pushed around this way in that way the little lamb speaking of christ the one that was to come after the fourth forerunner a little lamb moving out among them meek and gentle pushed around this way in that way and what does he keep telling us to be humble christians live for god live honest love those who don't love you live a christian life go to church be a real light wherever you are just burn for christ tell the people how you love them let your testimony be with love all the time he says you just go ahead be humble and go right on with the same plain message be real real solid now hold still god in humility god working in simplicity and he said that's what it was it was a little lamb came moving out among them meek and gentle pushed around this way in that way even john said and i'm reading right that's straight from paragraph 254 right into 255 even john said now look at john the prophet he said go ask him is actually he the one these are brother bram's words if to this point you thought i was treading on thin ice i think this will thicken it up a little bit so humble till that prophet missed it the forerunner actually began to think he was just a runner i ran with something i didn't see i spoke of something that i was wrong maybe i was wrong maybe i didn't know maybe something's amiss something didn't happen why because it was so humble that prophet missed it said is he the one or do we seek for another now this is this is a i've read over this read over this read over this trying to understand it i almost took it out just because i felt like way brother branham expresses it um maybe the there's a fragment in here that just in the in the transcription of it it leaves something to be desired so just listen and hopefully it'll strike you he said now he never gave give him a book for them disciples in matthew 11. so the disciples come and say is this the one or should we look for another he says he didn't give him a book he says come and ask him when john's disciples john was in prison so he had been all scrupled up till i believe his pember said his eagle eye got filmed over down there so the disciples came to matthew 11 at john's request after his eagle eye has been all filmed over he's all scrupled up and he's saying jesus didn't give him a book he's done come down to the earth the prophet has he'd been up in the air but when this prophecy was over he dropped back down to the ground again because they put him in prison he didn't have no use for them big wings anymore so he just laid down there but he flew higher than any of the rest of them because jesus even says more than a prophet he says let me show you something god used him and jesus knew because that was the incarnate god there now he never give him a book on how to behave himself in jail so what he said never gave him a book on how to behave himself in jail he said now wait a minute and i'll write a little essay here and you take back and tell john how to behave himself when he's in jail for my sake no he never said that right i think this is a caution on any of you who are wanting to write another book right because that's what we need is another book he says he didn't say that go tell john that he ought to have got his phd degree before he come out in in his if he would he would have been with like the rest of them he would have been a rejecter john was honest and asked a question he was honest and asked a question is this it could this be he said and just wait till the meeting is over this is what he told his disciples john's disciples and it is remarkable that the disciples of the forerunner argued with the manifestation of the forerunners ministry using the quotes of the forerunner you ever notice that in scripture well christ john said and use john's quotes to argue with the christ oh doesn't it sound like some of us sometime he said just wait till the meeting is over then go show john what happened then he'll know if you tell him what's going on then he will know he's in prison and couldn't be here but you sat in the meeting and you've seen what happened you go tell them so the disciples said very well master and over the hill they went jesus set it on this rock just watching them till they crossed over went up over the hill he turned around the car and greece and said who'd you go out and see the time of john what were you out to see did you go see a man that's got his collar turned around and soft clothes and highly polished and educated is that the kind of man you went out to see no you know what kind them are they kiss the babies you know work in king's palace is not the type john was then what did you go see a man that's been given a ministry with a hook into right into it you know hook right into organization and something like that shaking with every he says then if the oneness don't want it he'll go over to the trinity and with the trinity don't want it he'll go over to the church of god anywhere is that the kind of man you went to see shaking with every reed oh no not john he said then what did you go to see a prophet and i say that's right but i'm going to tell you something you don't know he was more than a prophet if you can receive it this is who was written of the bible back there in the scripture i'll send my messenger before my face malachi 3 and he'll prepare the way before me see and they didn't understand it even the disciples didn't get it simplicity be humble simplicity be humble go right down when god promises something big it's big in his sight now if you want to always keep this in mind i want you to you keep this in mind and when this happens then you can change it this is some of you may know exactly what he's saying here you reach down and pick up one of those little spring flowers that's coming this year or get a common blade of grass and hold it in your hand and say now this is what he wants you to keep in mind but if this happens you can change your mind i'm going to hold this now and see that something so simple has made this and i want the brain that can send a rocket to the moon make this blade of grass you always have it you can rest assured on that and you'll always have it in other words if you take that blade of grasses i'm going to hold it until man who can send a rocket to the moon can produce life and have it allow to have a seed come to life he says when they can when they can to take their own and come to this make this blade of grass he's and he's not just saying using what's already there he's saying to make something from nothing he said then if you if you say you'll get rid of it until man does it he says you'll hold on to that life forever because there's no substitute for it there's only an impersonation there's only a perversion of it he says the blade of grass has life in it it's so simple and humble you see if a man is a big man all right but if he's big enough that he can become simple he will find god but if you don't become simple he'll never see him so you've got to become simple you see where i'm going with this what brother bannon was saying and seals are being opened and he told us just to live a christian life to live simply to be he's telling us to be that blade of grass because that's something that a rocket scientist can't produce but it's something that god produces and and i love the continuity with how he brings in the myth the the ministry of john and the forerunner of christ in answering the question about the bride's ministry because here's our forerunner here's the one that's bringing to us the message and wanting us to not try to look so big to where we miss it and so he ends i'm going to skip to the end of question and answers on the seals paragraph 425 he's ending this is the very closing statement just in the question and answers that says oh isn't this this wonderful i believe that if every person that come by here this morning under this tremendous anointing i believe if you'll just now don't look up for something some great big something just remember the simple thing of believing what he promised so he says let's say it all together and you can say we can all say we do not look for something big but in jesus name we receive his promise he wanted everyone to confess it he wanted him to say it at the close of this question and answers we're so much as we'll go back into wednesday night i want to pick back on some very statements from this even come into the seventh seal that night because they connect perfectly together he's saying let's remember this before we step into this seventh seal which the seventh seal is christ and the things he says about the seventh seal is related to the seven thunders related to the coming of the lord related to the third poll he says let's just remember this we do not look for something big but in jesus name we receive his promise that's where he that's what he wanted us to where he wanted to leave it why this is coming now to the end of the book the very book of revelation the sealed book in revelations 5 which becomes an open book in revelations chapter 10. here we are these seals are unfolding the thunders are uttering their voices this is a very significant profound time scripture but people are looking shouldn't this be shouldn't this happen shouldn't that happen so oh no just stay humble just stay simple live a christian life be a christian don't be weird don't try to be odd don't be cultists don't be clandest don't just run off into the wilderness somewhere and try to get everybody together and live off the land and avoid your responsibilities no don't do that if you do they you twist away from the real thing and just as christ came as the perfect bridegroom that was reflected in the old testament and the bride comes as the perfect bride reflect in the new testament he says also in the harvest time he says the son of man so now it's luke 17 30. the word living itself again among the people now this is you have to make this personal the word itself made flesh in you luke 17 30 is the word made flesh in you you are a reflection of this hour the message reflection of it you live again and notice where he's bringing this down to he says you live again what are you going to live again what are you going to manifest what are you going to express he says you live again the life that was in jesus christ if i could connect it back to what we were reading question and answers and these statements i guess i won't read read them all over again but your life will be the interpretation of the open book and they can deny it but you're the proof of it by the way lawson shared with me one time i just can't remember exactly i think we're fellowshipping on the bright age and and he was why that ever became a controversy i don't know but he was we were fellowship on the bright age and he made the comment to me he said it's just like people who deny the holocaust you can deny it all you want but israel's back in their homeland and and you can deny you can deny the seals you can deny christ you can deny the message of the hour but the bride is here you're the proof of it even though they deny it but makes the same and interpret it by making it manifest and proving it it's the truth that's what you're to do god interprets it by making it manifest and he said every born-again son and daughter of god of this age is the interpretation of the word every born-again son and daughter god of this age is the interpretation of the word as musicians as you're coming i want to share something just to make reference to it and i would even encourage you maybe to go and study and listen to christ as the mystery of god revealed but brother branham as just as jesus christ and his life was the interpretation of the written word and he says that he he was god's interpretation of the word he was the interpretation word he says that his jesus life interpreted it brother branham says now you see the seals and he's wanting us to think about when you see the seals and he talks about the book and he says in all that's in this book the words in the book he says that's the believer that's what was in this book what was sealed up was you it was only in part what was in part was you your story you realize that's why john wept when he did as he knew part of the story but if the rest of it remained sealed there was always this question even in some ways john the baptist when he found himself questioning whether or not christ was the one there was something his ego eye got filmed over something was hidden to him the words in the book are the bride and now we are living out the word of god the bride is the new testament he said that's all we are fulfilling the new testament thank you so much for your attentiveness today
