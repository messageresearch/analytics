[0:00] title this evening is Love's great
[0:02] mystery there's been a lot of things
[0:04] that I've been looking at in this
[0:05] subject matter
[0:07] on uh on the subject of perfect love
[0:09] that's related to The Mystery of Love or
[0:11] The Secret Of Love and as we referenced
[0:14] on Sunday in a few different places when
[0:16] brother Brown's talking about all the
[0:17] mysteries of God being finished even as
[0:19] we were looking at the sermon marriage
[0:20] and divorce and now that the seals are
[0:22] open the spirit of Truth directs us to
[0:24] the word and brother Branham pointed to
[0:27] Revelations chapter 10 we know that
[0:29] according to Revelations chapter 10
[0:30] verse 7 it promises that the mystery of
[0:32] God should be finished and he says as it
[0:35] has been declared to his servants the
[0:36] prophet so that mystery that's finished
[0:38] in this hour is something that has been
[0:40] declared to the prophets and the Mystery
[0:44] of God we know has something to do with
[0:47] the secret of God's heart as brother
[0:48] Branham looks at that in Christ as the
[0:50] mystery of God revealed he says it's all
[0:51] in the last days when this great mystery
[0:54] that God had in his heart is being
[0:56] revealed so we're in the last days when
[0:58] something that was in in God's heart is
[1:00] being revealed and I believe all these
[1:02] Mysteries that God just doesn't have
[1:04] like this subsection or the spin-off
[1:06] over here where he's just doing some
[1:08] sort of a new series based upon
[1:10] something else that's already been and
[1:12] the Mysteries is kind of a one-off for
[1:14] people who like deep things but it's all
[1:16] related to his heart purpose and what
[1:18] he's trying to achieve and accomplish
[1:20] and so as we look at Revelations chapter
[1:22] 10 verse 1 we know that the mighty Angel
[1:25] which comes down is Christ is clothed
[1:27] with the cloud this Mighty angel with a
[1:29] rainbow upon his head that rainbow is
[1:31] signifying a covenant and when we look
[1:34] at Jesus Christ being the seed of
[1:36] Genesis 3 15 we can make that connection
[1:39] that he is the seed that could would
[1:42] have come by the original Covenant that
[1:44] they would have eventually brother man
[1:45] says brought forth that child then under
[1:48] the original Covenant it was envisioned
[1:50] that there would be a family that there
[1:51] would be that there would be more seeds
[1:53] that would come forth and Christ is that
[1:56] Seed of Abraham he is the one seed that
[1:59] is the the seed of the woman of Genesis
[2:01] 3 15 prophecy that is a Redemption so
[2:05] when this mystery is revealed we're
[2:07] saying on Sunday that the original
[2:08] Covenant is restored and under that
[2:10] original Covenant is full Redemption and
[2:13] I'll say this now
[2:15] kind of as a sneak peek for those of you
[2:17] who are here on a Wednesday night and
[2:19] for those that are streaming if you
[2:20] could just cut the stream for a moment
[2:22] and we'll just save that for the people
[2:23] who are here
[2:25] okay never mind they
[2:27] they say we just don't know when you're
[2:29] being serious or when you're joking I
[2:30] mean you mean like the whole time like
[2:32] from the moment the whole time I'm
[2:33] preaching but uh I've been studying for
[2:36] some time now and hoping to start very
[2:39] soon on a series on the kingdom and On
[2:43] Heaven's mystery and Earth's glory and
[2:45] so maybe this will serve as a link
[2:47] between perfect love and the kingdom
[2:49] because I'm just in looking at it and
[2:51] there's a way that when you preach the
[2:53] word of God that you can make it all
[2:55] well part of the same thing because it's
[2:57] all Jesus Christ it's all one con
[2:59] there's continuity amongst the things of
[3:01] God and the principles of God I'm hoping
[3:02] just to link these things together uh
[3:05] perfect love in the kingdom and as this
[3:07] might be the last service on perfect
[3:09] love as far as the series is concerned I
[3:11] wanted to read this statement because
[3:12] it's been one that I've read almost
[3:14] before every service
[3:16] and with that in mind just continue to
[3:18] remember that I'm wanting to link back
[3:20] to some of those things we talked about
[3:21] on Sunday on the mystery of God and that
[3:24] original Covenant he says today you know
[3:26] the love is so hard to find well the
[3:29] Bible said there'd come a time when
[3:30] there wouldn't be love for one another
[3:31] the father would be against mother and
[3:33] mother against father and children
[3:35] against parents and so forth and the
[3:37] only love would be left would be just
[3:38] between the elect and that's about right
[3:41] love is a scarce thing today so he's
[3:43] saying that come a time when the only
[3:45] love that will be will be among the
[3:47] elect
[3:48] I believe those days are upon us when it
[3:50] comes to genuine love or if you want to
[3:52] find what is real agape love you're only
[3:55] going to find it among the elect he says
[3:56] look at the divorce courts between
[3:58] husband and wife look at juvenile
[3:59] delinquency look at the home breaks and
[4:01] everything No Love No Love now the only
[4:04] time that you even know your neighbor's
[4:05] dead is when you read in the paper and
[4:07] we don't get that anymore
[4:09] so we don't even know our neighbors died
[4:11] until the moving truck is there and we
[4:13] we ask we start asking around he said
[4:15] that's about right we don't know about
[4:17] one another no more No Love No More
[4:20] he says No Love No Love he said this is
[4:22] this is kind of where we're at and I
[4:24] think there's a lot that we could say to
[4:25] amplify that but I make the point that
[4:27] love the love that's going to be found
[4:29] is among the elect and there's a reason
[4:31] for that
[4:32] now if you'll just look at Hosea chapter
[4:34] 1 with me and I if this seems a little
[4:36] bit disjointed then I never I never
[4:39] claimed to be a Mason I'm just kind of
[4:42] throwing the bricks out there you're
[4:43] going to have to put them together and
[4:44] get and fill it all in with some water
[4:45] but and Hosea chapter 1
[4:48] I'll just summarize it instead of
[4:50] reading it but we know that we see that
[4:52] God asked Hosea to take a one a woman of
[4:54] many whoredoms and he says make her your
[4:57] wife and that's a striking commandment
[4:59] uh how it says you know to take a woman
[5:01] of whoredoms and and make her your wife
[5:03] I've had some men sometimes tell me that
[5:05] the reason why they did something that's
[5:07] against God's word they said you know
[5:09] they said well I did this because God
[5:10] told me to do it and and they're trying
[5:12] to make an excuse for why they did
[5:14] something and I say well God told the
[5:16] prophet to eat feces and and to marry a
[5:18] woman of many whoredoms and that doesn't
[5:19] mean you need to run out and do it or
[5:21] doesn't mean it makes it right and it
[5:23] was just sometimes just pushing back a
[5:25] little bit sometimes when they try to
[5:26] change the word of God just based upon
[5:28] what the Lord told them when it doesn't
[5:30] fit with the word but this is a striking
[5:32] statement to go take a woman uh who is
[5:34] Unfaithful who is unclean and make her a
[5:37] wife and her name is Gomer and as we
[5:40] read in Hosea 11 she Bears children and
[5:43] the names that are given to the children
[5:44] are showing judgment against Israel
[5:46] Mercy to Judah and with each child with
[5:49] the children that are born God is
[5:51] wanting to use them to prophesy and use
[5:55] them to express something of his
[5:58] attitude towards Israel his attitude
[6:00] towards Judah and ultimately uh of
[6:03] redemption as verse 9 says he's going to
[6:06] say you are not my people and I am not
[6:09] your God that's a striking statement
[6:11] that those that claim to be the children
[6:12] of God or the uh The Chosen Nation the
[6:15] chosen people and those that worship the
[6:17] one true God is going to say you're not
[6:19] my people and I am not your God but as
[6:21] we read verses 10 and verse 11 it speaks
[6:24] of redemption through the Messiah
[6:25] and how that there's going to be they're
[6:28] going to come together and not just be
[6:31] a people but notice how deep this
[6:33] prophecy is that ye are the sons of the
[6:36] Living God and it's remarkable that when
[6:39] Christ comes claiming to be the Son of
[6:41] God and they took such umbrage with it
[6:43] now you claiming to be the Son of God
[6:45] make yourself equal with God but the
[6:47] prophets have already declared that
[6:49] there would be a time when they would
[6:50] even be called the Sons of the Living
[6:52] God
[6:53] and so there's uh if I could say this
[6:56] just to summarize though Israel was
[6:58] unfaithful
[7:00] when God tells Hosea to go take a woman
[7:02] of many whoredoms he's trying to show
[7:05] that even though Israel committed
[7:07] spiritual adultery and had profaned him
[7:09] and Fallen away from him that God would
[7:12] restore
[7:13] and that God would make whole in doing
[7:17] that it's showing it's showing a
[7:19] prophecy to Israel that this is what God
[7:21] wants to do for Israel this is his
[7:23] long-suffering with Israel this is his
[7:24] patience to Israel but I want us to draw
[7:27] from that more than just something that
[7:29] would relate to Israel but recognize
[7:31] that Israel is a type of the church
[7:34] I I one series that I definitely
[7:36] recommend to that everyone should listen
[7:39] to is when brother Brandon preaches
[7:41] Israel in the church and now I'm kind of
[7:43] forgetting 5253 where it's at there in
[7:45] the early 50s when he ministers it but
[7:48] he's come on off the field as having
[7:50] preached around the world and preaching
[7:52] meetings everywhere and he's coming back
[7:54] and he's kind of coming back the way I
[7:56] read it and the way it always strikes me
[7:58] is he's able to give a report about the
[8:00] condition of the church and he starts
[8:02] drawing this great parallel between
[8:04] Israel and the church and we begin to
[8:06] see and we know very clearly from the
[8:08] message that there's things that relate
[8:10] to Israel in the natural that relate to
[8:12] the Gentile bride and the spiritual
[8:13] there's things that would be fulfilled
[8:16] to Israel but then there's also a type
[8:18] to be fulfilled for the church so though
[8:20] God is prophesying uh to Israel and he's
[8:24] taking Hosea to marry a woman to
[8:26] represent and signify something to
[8:27] Israel will find that there's a truth
[8:29] that applies to the church
[8:32] and when I use the phrase Love's great
[8:34] mystery
[8:36] God now I'm going to be drawing from
[8:39] just a few parts ago God's original
[8:42] heart purpose we know is to have a bride
[8:44] of his own choosing that's at his heart
[8:47] and so when God created the Earth
[8:50] his plan was to bring a bride from it we
[8:53] understand that I know I'm maybe going
[8:55] fast through principles tonight
[8:57] but it's uh I just I think that there's
[8:59] nothing really deep here these are
[9:00] things I think you can just grab a hold
[9:02] of and take a hold of very easily so
[9:04] God's original heart purpose is to have
[9:05] a bride of his choosing so when God
[9:07] created the Earth he planned to bring a
[9:09] bride from it that that's already there
[9:11] it's already in the plan he creates
[9:13] everything he says I'm going to bring a
[9:14] bride out of this now when he brings
[9:16] when he creates Adam that's not the
[9:19] Fulfillment of his heart purpose when he
[9:21] takes E from Adam that's not the
[9:23] Fulfillment of his heart purpose when he
[9:25] banishes them from the garden and gives
[9:26] them a new covenant they begin to bring
[9:27] forth seed that's not his heart purpose
[9:29] God had hid his heart purpose in the
[9:32] beginning and didn't let it out
[9:34] initially but he's foreshadowing it from
[9:36] the very very beginning as as we
[9:38] believed that in the beginning he
[9:39] created the Heaven and the Earth and he
[9:41] already foreshadowed it then a Heavenly
[9:43] bridegroom and an Earthly bride that
[9:45] that's what he wanted to do
[9:47] so we see in Adam though what God was
[9:50] wanting to create God creates Adam then
[9:52] brings a wife from Adam that's in it
[9:54] that's symbolic of his purpose then we
[9:56] see this spiritually in Christ we know
[9:59] that Christ uh Christ's body is the
[10:02] bride and we can take so many statements
[10:04] and so many scriptures to show that the
[10:06] bride of Christ comes out of Christ and
[10:09] so just as the woman was hidden in Adam
[10:11] the bride was hidden in Christ and so
[10:14] now when the bride comes forth I could
[10:16] just say this she was the hidden mystery
[10:17] of Christ
[10:18] and one thing that I guess it's just a
[10:21] phrase I like to use if Christ is the
[10:22] mystery of God revealed then this bride
[10:25] will be the mystery of Christ God
[10:26] finished
[10:28] so this as we look in Matthew Chapter 13
[10:31] we'll start with verse 44 and kind of uh
[10:33] maybe just go through this fairly
[10:35] quickly
[10:36] Jesus giving this parable of the Kingdom
[10:39] of Heaven you can see how this would tie
[10:40] into a study on the kingdom he says
[10:42] again the Kingdom of Heaven is likened
[10:44] unto treasure hidden a Feeling
[10:47] and this treasure hid it means it's a
[10:50] secret treasure treasure coming from
[10:51] something to be placed or fixed so this
[10:55] hidden treasure something very special
[10:56] it's something placed or fixed there so
[10:59] you're using a parable so we know that
[11:00] the parable in some ways is cryptic but
[11:03] yet it's given unto us to know the
[11:04] mysteries of the kingdom it says the
[11:06] Kingdom of Heaven is likened to treasure
[11:08] hid in the field the which when a man
[11:10] hath found he hideth and so that found
[11:13] there
[11:15] uh it it has
[11:17] it's connected with with the placing and
[11:20] the fixing when he had found he hideth
[11:22] and for the joy thereof goeth and
[11:24] selleth all that he hath and buyeth that
[11:27] field now though we could use this
[11:29] scripture to challenge us as the hungry
[11:33] and as The Sinner
[11:34] that whenever we have seen the truth and
[11:37] we hear of Jesus Christ that we're
[11:38] willing to sell everything we have and
[11:40] give our hearts totally and completely
[11:42] to Christ and and cleave to him and it
[11:44] could be used in a way to challenge us
[11:47] that if you hear the truth abandon
[11:49] yourself to it and sell out for it and
[11:51] it's worth everything but when we read
[11:53] these Parables these in particular these
[11:56] Parables Express God's love in a mystery
[11:58] amen because when we read this and we
[12:01] know that the bride she was the treasure
[12:04] in God's heart and the Bible says that
[12:06] we would be found in him and that we're
[12:08] hidden in him and that we are before him
[12:11] and there's a lot of language that Paul
[12:13] uses in the in his letters to show that
[12:16] we were that we would be found in him
[12:17] that were hidden in Christ and so we
[12:20] could take all that together to show
[12:22] that you are the treasure
[12:25] and and that in as we read this the
[12:27] treasure hid in the field speaks of
[12:29] those who are the elect that God has hid
[12:32] in the earth that God has sown into the
[12:35] Earth and it's he that we could see in
[12:38] Christ gives all
[12:39] in order to buy the field for the
[12:42] treasure
[12:43] and it is so I say in its perfect
[12:46] fulfillment the bride is that treasure
[12:48] that's hidden in the earth and this
[12:50] Parable is about Redemption it's about
[12:52] the price being paid to redeem the
[12:54] treasure that's hidden the field because
[12:56] let's just be honest if we Christ was
[12:59] that treasure we couldn't sell enough to
[13:01] afford it
[13:03] there's just no way that we could pay
[13:05] the price for it but we are the treasure
[13:07] hid in the field that was hidden and for
[13:09] the joy which was set before him Christ
[13:11] endured and paid the price and sold all
[13:14] in order to pay the price of redemption
[13:16] to redeem the treasure from that field
[13:19] it says again the Kingdom of Heaven is
[13:21] likened unto a merchant man seeking
[13:23] goodly pearls not just pearls but goodly
[13:26] pearls who when he had found one pearl
[13:28] of great price many women have done
[13:30] virtuously but thou excellus them all
[13:32] there's one one pearl of great price one
[13:35] one body which is his own that he
[13:37] desires to redeem went and sold all that
[13:39] he had and bought it again it's
[13:42] reflective of the Queen of Heaven the
[13:44] Bride of Jesus Christ the ones for whom
[13:46] God has chosen before the foundation of
[13:49] the world and sent his son to shed his
[13:50] blood for she's represented in this
[13:54] parable
[13:55] now I have a I have a Target in mind
[13:58] tonight and with how
[14:00] I think with the way I'm typically
[14:02] natured when I approach a subject uh to
[14:04] this point this would maybe be part 46
[14:07] with just what I've already gone through
[14:09] tonight so I feel like I'm doing awesome
[14:11] tonight by having not God gotten bogged
[14:14] down with just one verse
[14:16] so I hope but I hope that there's some
[14:18] things that have been kind of put in
[14:19] here and I'm not saying that to brag I'm
[14:21] saying that's the weakness pray for me
[14:23] uh that if we could look at it now to
[14:26] say that
[14:28] God's purpose of the Earth was to get a
[14:30] bride out of it we see it typed in Adam
[14:32] we see it uh Christ we see this also in
[14:37] Christ and that this Parable the parable
[14:40] that he's using that Christ is giving us
[14:41] we can see that reflective in that yes
[14:44] the Earth must be pregnant it must hold
[14:47] promise of a bride because God created
[14:51] it for that purpose and so he's going to
[14:53] get a bride out of the earth he's going
[14:55] to get a bride out of the church we see
[14:56] what God's wanting to accomplish this is
[14:58] his aim uh God created the Earth for
[15:01] purpose brother Brown says Satan defiled
[15:02] it uh he says that that's the heart
[15:04] purpose of God to have a bride of his
[15:06] choosing the Earth's purpose then is and
[15:09] you say well there's so much more
[15:10] reasons to it it would have never been
[15:11] here had God not wanted a bride he
[15:13] wasn't just looking for a Sandbox to
[15:15] play around he's not a coder or a
[15:16] developer and he's over here and just
[15:18] kind of creates this thing and let's see
[15:19] how this can run and let's see what
[15:21] happens over here he he has the intent
[15:23] of having a bride and so the sole
[15:27] purpose of the earth then and and as
[15:29] time unfolds this masterpiece that is
[15:31] unfolding Through Time
[15:33] it was so that God's attributes could be
[15:36] expressed
[15:37] to a bride
[15:39] because that that's who God wants to
[15:41] make himself known to because when he
[15:44] chooses that bride she wants to choose
[15:46] him she wants to fall in love with him
[15:48] so the purpose of the Earth in time is
[15:50] God is going to express his attributes
[15:52] for the sole purpose of those attributes
[15:54] drawn a bride to himself
[15:56] and and uh if I you know you make me
[15:59] need to be careful just using this type
[16:01] but you see in nature how that brother
[16:03] Ram talks about how in nature the male
[16:05] is the one that is beautiful and and the
[16:07] variations within nature uh if you see
[16:10] how God has made the male and he uses
[16:13] that beauty and he uses that nature in
[16:16] order to draw a mate
[16:18] and you'll see that many different
[16:20] species in many different ways where
[16:22] they're using their color they're using
[16:23] sounds and they're posturing themselves
[16:25] and using these characteristics and
[16:27] attributes in order to draw and attract
[16:29] someone uh to be their mate and you say
[16:32] well that's that we see that in nature
[16:34] and and in some way that's exactly
[16:37] showing what God was wanting to do
[16:38] throughout time is Express his nature in
[16:42] order to draw you to himself
[16:44] that's his desire so he's using
[16:47] expressed attributes in order to bring
[16:49] forth the bride
[17:01] now in Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6
[17:06] says behold I God will send you Elijah
[17:09] the prophet before the coming
[17:11] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[17:13] Lord and he shall turn the heart of the
[17:15] fathers to the children
[17:16] we see again we see now in scripture how
[17:19] that even the spirit of Elijah turning
[17:22] the heart of the fathers to the children
[17:24] is fulfilled it has fulfillment in John
[17:27] the Baptist and the Heart of the
[17:28] children to their fathers lest I come
[17:31] and smite the Earth with the curse
[17:35] now we know that it is the ministry of
[17:37] Elijah that introduces the Christ which
[17:40] brings forth the bride and I don't
[17:41] believe that we need to labor on that
[17:43] this evening
[17:44] and we know that it is the Turning of
[17:47] the hearts is something that brother
[17:48] Branham uses in different ways to talk
[17:50] about restored to the faith
[17:52] uh and there's a lot the heart is an
[17:54] altar there's a lot that's expressed in
[17:56] that in that imagery but and the Turning
[17:58] of the faith our faith is going to go
[18:00] from Faith to perfect faith and without
[18:02] faith you can't have uh faith without
[18:04] having Love And so there's this turning
[18:06] of the heart of full affection full
[18:09] attention full adoration full uh full
[18:12] dedication to Christ because the purpose
[18:13] of Christ now is he wants to have
[18:15] preeminence in his church and so this
[18:19] ministry of Elijah then he comes as that
[18:22] Keystone he comes in there blending
[18:24] between two dispensations and he
[18:26] introduces Jesus Christ to the church
[18:28] and Jesus Christ then introduces or
[18:31] restores that Faith back why because
[18:33] it's the revealed word your mate
[18:36] and so that's why brother says he's a
[18:38] son of man revealing the son of man and
[18:41] he speaks often that by laying a
[18:43] foundation for one that's to come and
[18:45] you see that he always had the sense and
[18:48] he told us very plainly I'm not Christ
[18:50] I'm not the Messiah don't worship me and
[18:53] you make me out to be the Christ I I'd
[18:55] rather face God as a quitter than to be
[18:57] an antichrist so he knew his ministry
[18:59] was introducing something greater to
[19:01] come and it was it is that Mighty Angel
[19:04] it is Christ
[19:06] and so Christ then is it's through him
[19:09] that were that we were United it's
[19:12] through the revelation of Jesus Christ
[19:14] that you you that is uniting the bride
[19:17] now
[19:18] and I'm I'm drawing from so much that I
[19:21] think maybe for it's perfect for a
[19:23] Wednesday night crowd who's like I've
[19:24] heard that I've heard that I've heard
[19:25] that I've heard that and so everything's
[19:26] just kind of lining up here hopefully
[19:28] for you
[19:29] now if you'll just notice if you've
[19:31] turned in your Bibles to Malachi 4 and
[19:34] you're in verse 6.
[19:36] and if you're looking in your Bibles
[19:38] it's even more striking that the very
[19:40] last word of the Old Testament
[19:42] what is it
[19:44] curse
[19:45] perfect ending
[19:47] to the Old Testament
[19:49] curse
[19:51] and so as it ends with the word curse
[19:54] who is it that is
[19:57] under
[19:58] in suspense as it were
[20:02] of the curse that may come
[20:05] it ends with the Specter of the Earth
[20:08] being condemned cursed lay desolate
[20:10] wasted
[20:11] and he says behold I will send you
[20:13] Elijah the prophet who's going to turn
[20:15] the hearts of the children to the father
[20:16] fathers and that's a mouthful we know
[20:18] there's a lot that's in that and I've
[20:19] tried just to throw a bunch of little
[20:21] things out there just so we can start
[20:22] thinking that this is this is a very
[20:24] significant thing and not a small thing
[20:26] but I was wanting to speed up to this
[20:28] part that he says all that to say lest I
[20:32] come and smite the Earth with the curse
[20:35] if we could read it this way
[20:37] if I don't send Elijah I'm going to
[20:40] curse the Earth
[20:41] if Elijah doesn't come the Earth is
[20:44] cursed if Elijah doesn't come the Earth
[20:48] is going to be wasted it's going to be
[20:49] desolate
[20:51] and so with this thought that the Earth
[20:54] is going to be cursed
[20:56] and that somehow the Earth curse is only
[20:59] going to be lifted through this ministry
[21:01] of Elijah avoided through the Elijah
[21:03] Ministry
[21:04] turn with me to Mark chapter 11.
[21:09] I think maybe I know why I was nervous
[21:11] as it just seemed feels like such a
[21:13] different way of ministering for me or
[21:15] at least as of late and how I like to
[21:16] approach a subject
[21:19] I'm
[21:21] but I'm very very moved by this
[21:24] so in Mark chapter 11 verses 12 to 14
[21:26] I'll then we'll skip to verse 20 to kind
[21:29] of see the follow-up it says and on the
[21:31] morrow when they were come from Bethany
[21:32] Christ he was hungry so he has a need
[21:36] pay attention to this
[21:37] and seeing a fig tree far off having
[21:40] leaves he came if happily he might find
[21:43] anything thereon so if you could imagine
[21:46] this now the word of God is given by
[21:48] inspiration
[21:49] and and it's profitable so God is Not
[21:52] and one thing that we've we've tried to
[21:55] instill or at least refresh to your mind
[21:57] over and over again is we should never
[21:59] just look at something in the word of
[22:01] God just by chance just by Feeler and
[22:03] God's writing a bunch of things so just
[22:05] bear with me I just got to get all this
[22:06] out and there's no fluff I remember one
[22:08] time my brother asked me to speak at a
[22:11] particular function he just needed 20
[22:13] minutes and he said I just need 20
[22:15] minutes at this particular juncture he
[22:17] said so just take a sermon get all the
[22:19] fluff out and give us 20 minutes and I
[22:21] thought
[22:22] huh
[22:23] it tells me something about how you
[22:24] prepare sermons
[22:26] because like I didn't know you could put
[22:28] fluff in sermons
[22:29] are we allowed to do that
[22:32] because I don't do that and so I was
[22:33] like well I mean I guess I'm just going
[22:34] to have to find a 20-minute sermon
[22:36] because I don't have fluff and I
[22:38] probably should have said and you might
[22:39] want to revisit this whole idea of
[22:41] fluffing your sermons
[22:43] but anyways it was
[22:45] when God writes something there's no
[22:47] fluff in it
[22:48] in other words we could look at it and
[22:50] say there's something in this he wants
[22:52] to succeed and there's something he's
[22:54] wanting to convey so the fact that
[22:56] Christ was hungry means something to me
[22:58] the fact that he was had some sort of
[23:01] anticipation that he would find figs
[23:04] so you see I'm hungry he sees a tree he
[23:07] sees some leaves and he comes and he
[23:10] says that maybe I could find he says and
[23:12] when he came to it he found nothing but
[23:14] leaves and in the most striking of the
[23:16] statement is for the time of figs was
[23:18] not yet
[23:19] so he saw a tree a fig tree it should
[23:23] bear figs he's hungry he wants figs he
[23:25] sees it without figs and guess what he
[23:27] does
[23:28] verse 14 and Jesus answered and said to
[23:30] him no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter
[23:32] forever
[23:33] and his disciples heard it
[23:36] and so here's he's hungry as as some of
[23:39] you might try to conclude based upon his
[23:41] reaction of the tree he was hangry
[23:43] and it comes up to the tree and he
[23:45] reaches for figs no figs let no man ever
[23:48] eat of you and we might think he was
[23:50] just just had a temper fit but God is
[23:52] wanting to express something to us so in
[23:55] verse 20 and in the morning as they
[23:56] passed by and so we could see kind of
[23:58] how these uh the chronology of this
[24:01] they saw the fig tree dried up from the
[24:04] roots now this was fast
[24:06] and Peter calling to remember it saith
[24:08] and master you know he's surprised
[24:10] Master you won't believe it exactly what
[24:13] you said come to pass
[24:15] Master behold the fig tree without
[24:17] curses is withered away
[24:20] and Jesus answering saith in him have
[24:22] faith in God
[24:24] now we know that the next statement is
[24:27] to he says have faith in God and what he
[24:31] says next certainly Supple you know
[24:33] amplifies that and says if you speak and
[24:36] this is how powerful faith is and this
[24:37] is What Faith Can Do
[24:39] but I believe that there there is more
[24:42] expressed in that instead of Jesus just
[24:44] giving a lesson on faith
[24:46] he's showing that there's something
[24:48] about faith in what he just did not just
[24:51] in the power to curse the tree but in
[24:54] what he's looking for
[24:56] and this is what his complaint about the
[24:58] disciples oh you have little faith and
[25:00] and there's something he's wanting to
[25:02] see there's something he's wanting to
[25:03] cultivate there's something he's wanting
[25:04] to bring out and so Jesus is hungry
[25:07] and if I could say it again God did this
[25:10] to express the truth
[25:11] Jesus is not just you know trying to
[25:14] we're not he's not just trying to
[25:15] connect with us oh he looks like he's
[25:16] impatient this isn't impatience this
[25:18] isn't just being petty he's wanting to
[25:21] convey something to us as I was studying
[25:24] this I found different places brother
[25:26] man talked about it and and the sermon
[25:28] I've heard but now I see he says he used
[25:30] his power and put a curse on a tree
[25:32] it began to wither he says when there
[25:35] was people laying everywhere needing
[25:37] that healing power
[25:38] and so I read I read that statement to
[25:40] you because as I was reading all these
[25:42] different statements brother Branham
[25:43] uses this to say that this shows that
[25:46] God is concerned
[25:48] and that God here he is he uses his
[25:50] power to curse a tree and didn't use his
[25:52] power to heal people
[25:54] and he said he's wanting to show us
[25:56] something
[25:57] and so God is wanting to show us
[25:59] something when he's when Christ is
[26:01] hungry goes to this tree to receive
[26:03] fruit
[26:04] and so if I can say Jesus is hungry he
[26:07] needed fruit so the tree when he goes to
[26:10] the tree and he wants to see fruit it
[26:13] had not served its purpose to feed him
[26:16] in Genesis chapter 1 verse 29 it says
[26:19] and God said behold I have given you
[26:20] every herb bearing seed which is upon
[26:22] the face of all the Earth
[26:25] he says and every tree in the witch is
[26:28] the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you
[26:30] it shall be for meat
[26:32] this to me is one of the most important
[26:34] scriptures in understanding the original
[26:35] sin
[26:36] God was not trying to trick the man and
[26:39] the woman
[26:40] if it grew from the ground it was good
[26:42] for food and he had given them every
[26:44] tree in the which is the fruit of the
[26:46] tree yielding seed to you it shall be
[26:48] for meat
[26:49] so this tree was it was original purpose
[26:52] was to bring if we're going back to the
[26:55] original purpose Genesis 1 29 its
[26:57] purpose was to bring forth fruit that it
[27:00] might be meat to the eater
[27:02] and so God is telling Adam or this
[27:05] instruction to Adam I have given you
[27:07] these fruit-bearing trees and that you
[27:10] have a right to expect fruit and you
[27:12] ought to see that there would be fruit
[27:14] there and you can partake in it so now
[27:16] the second Adam I mean this is this is
[27:19] simple tonight right
[27:21] I mean if you want me to try to go
[27:22] deeper I can try harder this is just
[27:25] very simple and I trust that you're with
[27:26] me uh this Farm
[27:28] and so when Christ the second Adam
[27:31] is coming to the fig tree
[27:34] and he's hungry here we could say even
[27:36] in the semblance of Adam in the Garden
[27:38] of Eden he would have come to the tree
[27:40] expecting fruit now the second Adam is
[27:42] hungry he comes to the tree looking for
[27:44] fruit and since it's not there the curse
[27:47] was a consequence for not yielding what
[27:50] it should have yielded
[27:53] and so Jesus says have faith in God
[27:57] this is instructive in this curse that
[28:00] the tree having not fulfilled its
[28:01] purpose is cursed it ought to have given
[28:05] fruit to Christ as he come looking for
[28:06] it
[28:07] and in Luke chapter 18.
[28:10] I think I'm kind of laughing at myself
[28:12] at how much I put in this but in Luke
[28:15] chapter 18 the unjust judge is being
[28:17] wearied by this Widow
[28:20] and finally the unjust judge says just
[28:23] to get her to be quiet
[28:26] I'll Avenger
[28:28] and Jesus says in verse 6 hear what the
[28:31] unjust judge saith
[28:33] if the unjust will avenge the widow
[28:36] woman who wearys him constantly if
[28:38] that's what this would do how much more
[28:40] a righteous God and shall not God avenge
[28:43] his own elect his chosen
[28:46] which cried day and night unto him
[28:48] though he bear along with him though he
[28:50] delay
[28:51] though he tarry he says I tell you that
[28:54] he will
[28:55] avenge them speedily
[28:58] in his next statement
[29:00] is the means of that Vengeance it's the
[29:02] means of that Vindication it's the means
[29:04] of the rescue and the answer of the
[29:06] elect's prayer nevertheless when the son
[29:08] of man cometh shall he find faith on the
[29:11] Earth
[29:12] when the son of man cometh he looked
[29:14] he's looking for faith
[29:16] if I could say it to serve the purpose
[29:18] of this series he's looking for love
[29:21] and though it is said of
[29:24] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[29:27] faith on Earth and and we can look at it
[29:29] in the sense of the son of man's common
[29:31] now he's looking for Faith to find it it
[29:34] tells us
[29:35] it tells us what he's looking for
[29:38] and and not to suggest that he won't
[29:40] find it but it tells us what he's to
[29:42] what he's wanting to bring out
[29:44] what he's what the son of man is going
[29:46] to find Faith it's going to be
[29:48] discovered it's going to be brought out
[29:50] it's going to be what he's looking for
[29:53] and so if there's no faith
[29:55] when the son of man comes if we just
[29:57] look at it hypothetically if there's no
[29:59] faith then there is no satisfaction
[30:02] for Christ
[30:04] if there's no faith there's no
[30:06] fulfillment of Christ price of
[30:08] redemption could you imagine it comes
[30:10] and he pays the price and the price has
[30:12] been paid and it's been bought and then
[30:14] he he comes and the son of man is going
[30:16] to reveal himself and as the Revelation
[30:18] is going forth no faith
[30:20] No One Believes the price is paid but
[30:23] there's no belief
[30:24] and it even causes me to remember how
[30:28] that brother Branham Drew from that
[30:29] Supreme Court case where a pardon is not
[30:32] a pardon except it be received as a
[30:34] pardon
[30:35] and and and it tells me that when
[30:38] something is offered that the pardon as
[30:41] the Supreme Court looked at it there's
[30:43] some sort of contract that's being
[30:44] offered and and all this is just maybe
[30:47] too big for me tonight but it there has
[30:50] to be a meeting of the minds there has
[30:52] to be some agreement to the essential
[30:53] terms and so what what Christ offers the
[30:56] Redemption and this Redemption contract
[30:59] that there's many people who want to lay
[31:01] claim to it and there's many people who
[31:03] want to be identified with it and want
[31:05] to be Redeemed by him but that that
[31:07] Redemptive contract is to the elect
[31:09] and if the lack don't receive it there
[31:12] there it is wasted so the elect must
[31:15] must come to know that Covenant they
[31:17] must come to understand the contract
[31:19] that's being extended because because we
[31:22] are the match peace we are the other
[31:25] part to that
[31:26] [Music]
[31:28] you're the other part to that contract
[31:30] and so we there must be faith
[31:33] this is what he's looking for
[31:36] so are are you kind of finding do you
[31:39] feel like you're following me a little
[31:40] bit tonight
[31:42] the Earth has a purpose to get a bride
[31:44] out of it
[31:46] if the Earth
[31:47] doesn't bring forth a bride
[31:50] she's cursed
[31:54] because that's the purpose of the Earth
[31:56] and we see that that when Christ came
[31:58] looking for fruit
[32:01] of the seed that was sown in the
[32:02] beginning the purpose of the trees to
[32:03] bring forth fruit when he doesn't see it
[32:05] he curses it and says have faith in God
[32:09] and there's
[32:11] it's faith that the son of man is
[32:12] looking for
[32:14] that was I used I used those scriptures
[32:17] to show that the curse lest I come and
[32:19] smite the Earth with the curse it's
[32:20] connected with failure purpose
[32:23] so now you see why how important this
[32:25] ministry of Elijah is
[32:27] the Earth Waits
[32:29] it waits with the prophecy over it that
[32:32] except a bride come from it it's cursed
[32:36] and so where we see in one instance that
[32:38] Christ comes to the tree not seeing
[32:41] fruit he curses it and it's instructive
[32:43] to us
[32:44] in Luke chapter 13 verses 6 to 9.
[32:48] he spake also this parable
[32:50] and a certain man had a fig tree planted
[32:52] in his Vineyard and he came and sought
[32:54] fruit thereon and found none
[32:57] then said he under the dresser of his
[32:59] Vineyard
[33:01] behold these three years I come seeking
[33:03] fruit on this fig tree and find none can
[33:06] you see the image of Christ
[33:08] in him coming to the Fig Tree wanting to
[33:11] see fruit now he's using this Parable
[33:13] to to express this
[33:16] and he says cut it down why cumbreth hit
[33:19] the ground
[33:21] that's quite a statement get rid of the
[33:24] tree it's a burden to the soil
[33:26] cut it down it's just taking up space
[33:28] and nutrients and it's of no use the
[33:31] only reason why I planted the Fig Tree
[33:33] is that I would get figs it's not for
[33:35] Shane it's not an ornament it's not for
[33:37] beauty it has one purpose if it doesn't
[33:40] bring forth that even though you could
[33:41] use it for shade even though it might
[33:43] look pretty it's just a burden to the
[33:45] soil
[33:47] so he said cut it up cut it down
[33:50] but now notice this is one of the
[33:52] parable this is the parable he's wanting
[33:54] to express something and he answered and
[33:56] said unto him Lord let it alone this
[33:58] year also till I shall dig about it and
[34:01] dung it
[34:02] so notice notice even this forbearance
[34:05] of God this part of this this Instinct
[34:08] of the one that dresses the vineyard
[34:10] who's saying wait a minute I I know that
[34:13] maybe it hasn't done it yet but could we
[34:16] just serve it a little bit more could we
[34:18] just give it more it says to dung it I
[34:20] want to give it some fertilizer I want
[34:22] to give it some nutrients I want to dig
[34:24] about it a little bit I want to prune it
[34:25] a little bit I want to shock it please
[34:27] let's not destroy it yet why why we can
[34:30] let's keep ministering to the Fig Tree
[34:33] so that it could bring forth the figs
[34:35] that you're looking for he says and if
[34:37] it bear fruit well and if not after that
[34:40] thou shalt cut it down
[34:42] so there's this Instinct and this desire
[34:45] that though the tree had not yet served
[34:47] its purpose you're saying wait hold on
[34:49] not yet
[34:51] when I was ministering last Wednesday I
[34:53] believe it was uh we're talking about
[34:55] love and hate
[34:56] uh brother uh Reginald been David plant
[34:59] sent me a text message after service uh
[35:01] and how that the disciples were saying
[35:04] oh should we call fire down from heaven
[35:05] should we just burn them on the spot and
[35:08] as a striking response that Jesus says
[35:10] he says you don't have any idea what
[35:11] Spirit you're of
[35:13] and that's striking because I think
[35:16] maybe there's if we're if we do I think
[35:18] sometimes we really like to lean heavy
[35:19] on God's judgment right we like Smite
[35:22] the Earth with the curse is that right
[35:24] tell me more right the ashes of the
[35:27] wicked now that would make a good series
[35:29] brother Aaron right there's just
[35:31] something that maybe we like about that
[35:33] you know but yeah let them have it
[35:35] but there's something to be said about
[35:37] Lord could you wait a little longer do
[35:39] you see that in Abraham where he says oh
[35:42] you're going to destroy them all
[35:47] and listen he he kept saying what about
[35:51] this what about this and God was
[35:52] complicit
[35:54] yeah we we said does God ever change his
[35:56] mind about his word God allows scenarios
[35:59] and say oh he changed his mind there he
[36:01] changed his mind there and what about
[36:02] the king who pleaded for more years but
[36:04] God allows these scenarios because
[36:06] there's something in his heart that when
[36:08] Moses stood in the Gap God's like that's
[36:10] it that's what I wanted you to say
[36:12] that's what I wanted you to do
[36:15] because this is something reflective
[36:17] about God to say ah this tree hasn't
[36:19] done it yet it's wasted it's no good get
[36:21] rid of it it's not it's not useful
[36:23] anymore I I think that's a lot about
[36:25] what a lot of people have tried to do in
[36:27] this message and the promises of it they
[36:29] say well Ministry hasn't worked for 50
[36:31] years and church hasn't gotten us this
[36:33] for 50 years and they want to just shut
[36:35] the whole thing down and burn it up I
[36:36] say that's not the heart of a real Vine
[36:39] uh husbandman that's not the heart of
[36:41] God he says like that's my word that's
[36:43] my promise that's my dress wear it'll
[36:46] it'll work
[36:50] and so he says can I just dig it and
[36:52] dung it a little bit
[36:54] and so this I want you to just see that
[36:58] that that instinct
[37:00] the Earth was created for a purpose
[37:03] when something doesn't serve its purpose
[37:05] it stands
[37:07] under the judge it stands to be cursed
[37:11] and here a tree was going to be rooted
[37:13] up and tossed aside and the the
[37:16] the uh
[37:18] the the the answer from the dresser is
[37:22] weight
[37:24] and so God this is the this is the the
[37:26] mercy of God
[37:29] the Old Testament ends with curse
[37:33] and and then it the transition is it to
[37:36] the blessing of the New Testament
[37:38] and what is what is the the the the Old
[37:41] Testament ends
[37:43] with the mystery that Elijah is the
[37:46] prophet to the Gentiles
[37:48] and what does Matthew begin with the
[37:50] mystery of the Gentile women in the
[37:53] lineage of Christ
[37:55] and so there's a mystery that God has
[37:57] expressing in these things and if I
[37:59] could say this to kind of make a a leap
[38:01] here God sends Elijah
[38:05] because it because he wants his purpose
[38:08] fulfilled
[38:09] so he's going to build a Ministry
[38:11] vindicate a Ministry not I know again I
[38:15] guess I could say this because it's
[38:16] applicable
[38:17] there's a lot to be said about the
[38:20] justice of Elijah we recognize this and
[38:22] naming one of our children an English
[38:24] variant of Elijah that there's this
[38:26] sense of justice
[38:27] in Elijah's Ministry is one
[38:30] that's going to chase those false
[38:32] prophets down to the brook and slay them
[38:34] all right there's a there's a judgment
[38:37] side to Elijah
[38:39] but but you can't have the curse side
[38:41] without the blessing side
[38:43] and that and and so though the Judgment
[38:45] the judgments of Elijah and that
[38:47] Ministry of Elijah and his the the what
[38:49] he's going to breathe out in the Justice
[38:51] and judgment there is the restoration
[38:54] and the ministry of Elijah brings you
[38:57] face to face with Jesus Christ and so
[39:00] God sends Elijah to restore the faith in
[39:03] order to bring forth the fruit that he's
[39:05] seeking so God's not just sitting back
[39:07] looking at the church and he's saying oh
[39:09] a great look they blew it
[39:12] yeah way to go guys
[39:13] I send you the restoration of the gifts
[39:15] here you are you have the guests
[39:17] restored you've gone through
[39:18] sanctification justification baptism of
[39:20] the Holy Ghost the gifts have been
[39:22] restored everything's looking great
[39:23] everything's wonderful and and they go
[39:25] and blow it and God's just like you know
[39:27] what
[39:29] this is that's it I'm done
[39:31] he's like no I I I'm gonna send I'm
[39:34] going to send a messenger
[39:36] I'm going to send I'm going to send
[39:38] Elijah the prophet in order in order to
[39:40] bring forth the fruit that I'm seeking
[39:42] because had he not just if you if you
[39:45] agree with this say amen I give you
[39:47] permission to say amen I know that it
[39:49] seems like maybe I've told you you're
[39:51] not supposed to so now I'm giving you
[39:53] explicit permission if he did not send
[39:56] Elijah there would have been no bride
[40:00] and he said well how could you say that
[40:02] well because he said it right
[40:06] if
[40:07] if he did not send Elijah there would
[40:09] have been no bride if he didn't prophesy
[40:11] in Elijah he would have prophesied some
[40:13] way
[40:14] to bring forth the bride but that's just
[40:15] the way that he did it
[40:17] and if he had not sent Elijah the
[40:19] Earth's purpose would have failed
[40:22] because it's exactly what he's saying in
[40:23] Malachi behold I send you Elijah the
[40:26] prophet to do something
[40:28] lest I smite the Earth with the curse
[40:30] behold I send you Elijah the prophet and
[40:34] in doing so the curse upon the Earth
[40:36] will be avoided that's the way it reads
[40:38] right is that the way you're reading it
[40:39] lest I come and smite the Earth with the
[40:41] curse I'll come and smite the Earth with
[40:43] a curse but first I'll send Elijah the
[40:46] prophet so I don't have to
[40:48] and if I could say this this is uh why
[40:51] this this has been at the very po the
[40:54] pulsating in me in preaching on perfect
[40:57] love this is perfect love
[41:00] that God would send this ministry there
[41:02] that that's perfect love if I could
[41:05] Define it this way perfect love is the
[41:07] ministry of doing whatever it takes to
[41:09] bring forth fruit
[41:10] perfect love is a Ministry of patience
[41:12] it's a Ministry of Grace it's a Ministry
[41:14] of long-suffering it's perfect love is
[41:16] the ministry of how we Define charity in
[41:18] First Corinthians 13. until it produces
[41:21] the product
[41:24] that that it's it's not going to give up
[41:26] it's not going to waste it it's making
[41:28] every provision it's doing everything
[41:29] that it can and when the Bible tells us
[41:32] in Revelations chapter 2 verse 4 when it
[41:34] says of the church I've got somewhat
[41:36] against thee because thou has left of
[41:38] thy first love
[41:40] they have left him but he hasn't left
[41:43] her
[41:44] there is walking in the midst of the
[41:46] seven golden candlesticks
[41:48] and though she it goes down to the
[41:51] ground in martyrdom he's right there
[41:52] trying to build her back up again the
[41:54] church left him
[41:56] and if you think that's bad
[41:59] if you really want to look at the church
[42:01] ages you'll find
[42:04] there's the Gentile there's the the
[42:07] birth of the Christian Church which is
[42:10] those Gentile the the Jews that came
[42:13] that were birthed under the Messiah
[42:15] the there the baptism the Holy Ghost is
[42:17] coming out and then there's this
[42:18] transition time where now the gospels go
[42:20] to go to the Gentiles and when you read
[42:23] the church age begins because of the
[42:26] Antichrist
[42:27] working against the church
[42:30] and and it is very quickly now that the
[42:32] gospel is coming to the Gentiles it
[42:33] begins in that Warfare and this conflict
[42:35] and so you think it's bad that they left
[42:38] their first love and the ultimate Act of
[42:40] betrayal when you get to Revelations
[42:42] chapter 3 Christ has been kicked out of
[42:44] the church
[42:45] after he has gone through the process of
[42:47] restoration after he's restored the
[42:49] gifts they kick him out
[42:50] it's almost as if to say now that they
[42:52] got got the gifts they're like
[42:55] like hey isn't this awesome look at what
[42:57] look what we have now we have shouting
[42:59] we have dance we have praise and we can
[43:00] speak in tongues we can heal we can do
[43:02] all sorts of things and and they don't
[43:04] need him anymore
[43:06] and so Revelations chapter 3 verses 20
[43:08] and 21 behold I stand at the door and
[43:10] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[43:13] the door I'll come into him and we'll
[43:14] sup with him and he with me
[43:16] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[43:19] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[43:21] overcame and sat down with my father in
[43:23] his throne
[43:25] and the ultimate Act of betrayal the
[43:27] church kicks him out but guess what he's
[43:28] still there knocking
[43:31] and the Overcomer is him
[43:33] because he that overcometh is she
[43:36] and he says and if I could say this this
[43:38] is the Bride of co-equality that is
[43:40] going to raise up to sit with him in his
[43:42] throne it's the only place befitting
[43:43] such a queen and so the bride is
[43:47] reflective in this that though the
[43:49] church has seemed to felt its purpose
[43:51] he's saying nope I'm going to get a
[43:53] bride out of her I'm not gonna be left
[43:56] unsatisfied I'm going to get what I came
[43:59] for my word will not return to me void
[44:01] though the church May Fail I will just
[44:04] get a bride out of the church because my
[44:07] heart purpose must be satisfied
[44:11] this is perfect love
[44:14] God was powerful enough to go ahead and
[44:16] create a billion Earths
[44:19] until one finally worked out right
[44:23] and that's exactly how science believes
[44:25] that this has happened
[44:27] is that we are just billions upon a
[44:30] billion different iterations of uh
[44:32] genetics misfiring and firing to where
[44:34] we ended up like this
[44:36] and and science is kind of looking at
[44:38] this saying well this just looks like we
[44:40] all kind of mutated to this and I say if
[44:42] they kind of see that pattern then God
[44:45] could have just done that with the Earth
[44:48] just thrown a billion planets out there
[44:50] and just just see through all the
[44:52] different variations that there'd
[44:54] finally be one that would never make a
[44:55] mistake
[44:57] always be perfect
[44:59] just that woman walking through the
[45:02] garden and the serpent goes she goes up
[45:05] sorry right
[45:08] like that maybe that just happens that
[45:10] way but God
[45:11] is here saying no I made it for a
[45:14] purpose I'm not resorting to anything
[45:16] else but perfect love
[45:18] to accomplish my objective
[45:21] and
[45:25] have you ever read the Choose Your Own
[45:27] Adventure books anybody ever read one
[45:28] like that
[45:30] you know you cheat when you read it
[45:31] right you're like yeah turn to page 12
[45:34] and like done you're like go back and
[45:36] you you choose the other page
[45:38] you know it's true
[45:40] so I'm gonna play Choose Your Own
[45:41] Adventure
[45:42] is it okay if I keep going
[45:45] and if you said no I was just gonna
[45:47] do something else
[45:50] gonna keep going
[45:52] the bride
[45:54] needed this Redemptive love
[45:57] the individual members of the Bride
[45:59] needed this Redemptive love and so now
[46:02] this is the difficult part and I don't
[46:04] know I'm waiting until like 8 15 maybe
[46:05] to get to this part because this we're
[46:07] gonna have to really really concentrate
[46:08] I believe
[46:09] that there is there is Redemption for
[46:11] the individual member
[46:13] and and what God does you can even see
[46:16] what God does to the church ages
[46:18] corporately and to the church ages he
[46:19] does to the individual that the the
[46:21] church ages we see stages of the new
[46:24] birth and we can't translate that
[46:26] meaning stations
[46:27] of the new birth as a member but we can
[46:30] see that in the church age God grants a
[46:32] birth to the individual
[46:34] and so the individual was a was born a
[46:37] sinner born in sin and needed Redemption
[46:39] and God's church now there's this image
[46:43] in the church where with she she needs
[46:46] Redemption
[46:48] they say well she's birthed she's
[46:50] birthed supernaturally she's born there
[46:52] on the day of Pentecost but there's this
[46:54] image that I want you to see where
[46:56] brother Brown begins to talk about the
[46:58] first husband of the world
[47:00] now in the sermon the invisible Union of
[47:02] the bride of Christ
[47:04] if you could I'm just I'm just I'm gonna
[47:07] reference something and hopefully be
[47:08] able to use it without going too deep on
[47:10] it I'm not speaking to this local
[47:12] assembly I'm speaking all together
[47:13] across the nation
[47:15] you must be dead to your first husband
[47:18] if you're United to Christ and still
[47:20] married to a denomination you're an
[47:22] adulteress you are laodicea
[47:25] that statement is so important
[47:28] that as long as you are in laodicea
[47:31] you are still identified with your first
[47:33] husband
[47:35] so he says if you're United to Christ
[47:38] and still married to a denomination and
[47:40] I'm I wouldn't say that he's suggesting
[47:42] that it's possible
[47:44] but he is he's at least showing that if
[47:46] there be some Union to Christ
[47:49] that that you're still in a they're
[47:51] still in adulteress if denominationalism
[47:54] is not dead
[47:56] he says you're you're lailed to sin now
[47:58] another place in that sermon he the
[48:00] bridegroom took away your shame so I'm
[48:02] not hiding anything here I can see I
[48:04] think you can see what I'm tracking and
[48:06] put it in the sea of forgetfulness by
[48:07] the washing of the water of the word and
[48:08] the blood of life
[48:10] that's what the Bible said
[48:12] your first husband that you were married
[48:14] to the world
[48:16] so I can see how this looks for the
[48:18] individual the first husband that you're
[48:20] married to the world
[48:22] the anointed bridegroom which foreign
[48:24] danger has washed you
[48:26] by the washing of the water
[48:28] now it's in discernment
[48:31] I look out upon the audience tonight and
[48:34] everyone here to me you look to me like
[48:36] someone who knows what I'm talking about
[48:38] in The Invisible Union he's showing who
[48:42] that first husband was
[48:43] tying tying looking at the type of the
[48:45] church who's unfaithful
[48:47] married to that old husband but now he's
[48:50] saying there's something happening
[48:52] there's a there's a washing of the water
[48:53] of the word now God has promised
[48:56] something in the last days to bring a
[48:58] bride out of that church and that church
[49:01] will be cursed that church will be
[49:02] condemned and he's using that image of
[49:04] the the bride coming into preview again
[49:06] layout to see us descending into chaos
[49:08] but there's going to be a bride that
[49:10] steps forth and so he's looking at the
[49:12] idea of a bride coming forth and he said
[49:14] that anointed bridegroom he washed you
[49:17] by the washing of the water of the word
[49:19] so there is this there is this not just
[49:22] a divorce there's a death to the first
[49:25] husband
[49:27] and so he says again in the same sermon
[49:29] now we know that the church could not
[49:31] the Pentecostal Church which is laodicea
[49:33] by no means by no means could carry out
[49:36] the last day message in its present
[49:38] condition could it why it can't even
[49:40] agree on one or two words in the Bible
[49:43] how are you going to do it it can't do
[49:45] it so you see denomination is out
[49:49] that's right it's going to be an elected
[49:52] people that's elected for it
[49:56] now no and so do every one of us know
[49:58] that the whole rank of denominational
[50:00] Pentecostal and all are dead
[50:04] that is to the born-again Christian of
[50:07] the message
[50:09] catch this your first husband is dead
[50:12] you know he's dead God let it die it's
[50:17] finished
[50:18] there's the grace of God there's the
[50:21] grace of God to let that vine die to let
[50:24] that husband die to say it served out
[50:27] its purpose but now that the bride has
[50:29] come forth I don't need the shuck
[50:31] anymore I I don't need that anymore I I
[50:34] got what I want
[50:38] and so there is this
[50:40] I I want you to recognize that principle
[50:42] of the first husband of sin the church
[50:46] the world and how that clung to you but
[50:50] now there's this ministry of Christ at
[50:52] the end time that says that old husband
[50:54] is dead
[50:57] and this
[50:59] the image that brother Brad the picture
[51:01] of the brother Brands painted you can
[51:03] see this reflected and I say albeit
[51:04] imperfectly in Hosea
[51:07] taken a wife of many whoredoms
[51:12] and though I say imperfectly it's
[51:15] because God is using types and shadows
[51:18] they are not
[51:20] they are not perfect in themselves
[51:23] they just are a shadow of perfection
[51:26] and so God wants to express the truth in
[51:29] hosea's actions and that's why I called
[51:31] it Love's great mystery
[51:34] the bride
[51:36] is at the core of the great mystery
[51:38] that's revealed in the end time
[51:39] it says the mystery of God should be
[51:41] finished as it has declared by his
[51:43] servants the prophets maybe we'll take
[51:44] some time showing this that mystery is a
[51:46] gentile bride
[51:48] part of that
[51:49] and so as we already read in Hosea
[51:51] chapter 1
[51:54] Hosea
[51:55] takes Gomer
[51:58] a woman of many whoredoms and she
[52:00] becomes wife and she brings forth
[52:02] children
[52:03] and God prophesies through the names of
[52:05] those children and he says you'll no
[52:07] longer just be
[52:10] a people but there's going to be sons of
[52:12] the Living God
[52:14] and he talks about how great shall
[52:16] it'd be the land being the day of
[52:18] Jezreel
[52:20] so if you look at he Hosea chapter 2
[52:22] verses 16 to 23 it says it shall come to
[52:24] pass it that day
[52:27] so Hosea has already taken Gomer
[52:32] she's brought forth children
[52:35] and now God if I I'll say it now said
[52:37] God is going to outline his great heart
[52:40] purpose and mystery of taking a bride to
[52:43] himself
[52:46] and
[52:47] and so if we could just read this so
[52:49] remember Hosea takes a woman to many
[52:51] whoredoms and he's wanting to portray a
[52:53] great truth
[52:54] Adam what did Adam do he redeemed his
[52:56] adulterous wife
[52:58] to portray a great truth
[53:00] Paul
[53:02] uh let's say Christ he pays the price of
[53:04] redemption
[53:06] to bring forth the bride Paul says I've
[53:07] espoused you as a church to Christ
[53:11] so now he says and it shall be at that
[53:12] day saith the Lord thou shall call me
[53:14] that thou shalt call me is she which is
[53:16] husband
[53:18] and shall call me no more bahali for I
[53:21] will take away the names of Balaam out
[53:23] of her mouth
[53:24] and they shall be shall no more be
[53:26] remembered by their name now
[53:29] recognize how how much we could show
[53:32] Elijah of Revelations the voice of
[53:35] Revelations 18 4 come out of her my
[53:36] people
[53:37] and as he calls us out of Babylon he
[53:40] takes the names of Babylon out of our
[53:42] mouth takes the doctrine out of our
[53:44] mouth the these things are taken out of
[53:47] our mouth and in the Turning of the
[53:49] heart that's not even in our heart to be
[53:51] in our mouth there's so so much we could
[53:53] see in this image of Balaam and in that
[53:56] day will I make a covenant for them with
[53:58] the Beast of the field and with the
[53:59] fowls of heaven and with the creeping
[54:01] things of the ground
[54:03] notice how it seems to bring in creation
[54:05] into view and I will break the bow and
[54:08] The Sword and the battle out of the
[54:10] Earth
[54:11] this is going back to peace this is
[54:14] going back to Harmony all the things
[54:16] that the fall brought up all the things
[54:17] the curse that has brought Wars and
[54:20] fightings and all these things he says
[54:21] and I will make them to lie down safely
[54:24] oh what a restoration back to a paradise
[54:27] and I will betray thee unto me forever
[54:33] this is a union that is not just
[54:35] invisible but indivisible
[54:38] yay I'll betrayal the unto me and
[54:40] righteousness and in judgment and in
[54:41] loving kindness and in mercies what a
[54:44] language he's using how is it that he's
[54:46] speaking so kindly to Israel in all of
[54:50] their sins and surely God would say you
[54:51] know what I know exactly what you're
[54:52] going to do because what did they did
[54:54] exactly they did it even to where the
[54:57] reason why he sends the message of
[54:59] Elijah and Elijah's prophesying after
[55:01] all I've done even in restoring the
[55:03] temple so Malachi says you know what his
[55:06] name will be great among the Gentiles
[55:07] and Malachi becomes the Cornerstone
[55:10] prophet of the Gospel turning to the
[55:13] Gentiles
[55:15] I hear this language he's using and it's
[55:18] all come to pass in that day I will hear
[55:21] saith the Lord
[55:23] I will hear the heavens
[55:26] and they shall hear the Earth
[55:29] this is the kingdom
[55:31] and the Earth shall hear the corn and
[55:33] the wine and the oil and they shall hear
[55:35] Jezreel and that name is The God Who
[55:39] sows
[55:40] The God Who plants the seed the one who
[55:43] planted the seed under the original
[55:45] Covenant the one who who created the
[55:48] fowls of the air the Beast of the field
[55:49] the creeping things on the ground the
[55:51] one who planted who made the corn who
[55:53] made the the elements for the wine and
[55:55] the oil they shall hear shall hear
[55:57] Jezreel God's souls and notice this
[56:00] verse I know we've used it a hundred
[56:01] times in this church and I will sow her
[56:04] unto me and the Earth
[56:07] and I will have mercy upon her that had
[56:10] not attained mercy and I will say to
[56:13] them which were not my people
[56:15] Thou Art my people I I I've got to slow
[56:19] down
[56:20] I was so run to me in the Earth
[56:23] he's speaking about a sowing
[56:27] of seed remember how brother Bradham
[56:29] said all of our bodies laid in the earth
[56:32] upon the at the moment it was created
[56:34] and he said look you're there in the
[56:37] creation God knew only God could do this
[56:40] he puts all the elements there and all
[56:42] the genetic material and all the
[56:44] elements and all the nutrients and
[56:45] everything that's in it he knew would
[56:47] one day bring forth you in this body
[56:50] form and he laid it all out there he
[56:53] sowed you in the Earth
[56:56] even watched out over these the even the
[56:58] natural birth
[57:01] even says the natural birth is a is it
[57:03] Greater mystery and more mysterious than
[57:04] the Virgin birth
[57:06] and so he says I'll sow her unto me in
[57:09] the Earth
[57:10] I says and I will have mercy upon her
[57:12] that had not obtained Mercy
[57:15] now as he speaks to Israel
[57:19] there's a fulfillment to Israel
[57:22] but it's more perfectly fulfilled and
[57:26] the Heathen people who were never
[57:28] promised Mercy nor given Mercy unto the
[57:31] Covenant to Abraham they were the
[57:33] uncircumcised they were the other
[57:35] nations they were the reprobate they
[57:37] were the Heathen God never showed mercy
[57:39] upon them but he says I will have mercy
[57:41] upon her that had not obtained mercy and
[57:44] this is the voice from heaven and I will
[57:46] say unto them which were not My People
[57:48] Israel were always his people but now he
[57:51] will say in a more perfect fulfillment
[57:53] Thou Art my people
[57:56] what is this this is here the heavens
[57:59] Thou Art my people and they shall say
[58:03] hear the Earth Thou Art my God
[58:07] hear the heavens hear the Earth the
[58:09] heavens say thou art my people in the
[58:11] earth's Thou Art my God
[58:14] I believe this is the Gentile bride
[58:17] fulfilling the purpose of the Earth this
[58:19] is Love's great mystery that God is
[58:22] going to bring a bride of his own
[58:23] choosing out of the earth and the
[58:25] heavens are going to say thou art my
[58:27] people that I foresaw from the very
[58:29] beginning as I prophesied the seed of
[58:31] the woman and Satan was always after
[58:33] that seed but I hid it in a mystery and
[58:35] brought forth a nation and a people in a
[58:38] land that would bring forth Christ I
[58:41] will do the same over the whole earth
[58:43] and all the other nations as I brought
[58:45] the bridegroom out of one people I will
[58:48] bring forth a bride out of all Nations
[58:51] and all people because that's my heart
[58:53] purpose
[58:56] Hallelujah
[58:58] Love's great mystery
[59:01] so as Hosea had taken Gomer
[59:03] and chapter one and she had brought
[59:05] forth these children now God begins to
[59:08] outline and share with us this is my
[59:09] Plan of Redemption
[59:11] Hosea married this adulterous wife
[59:14] Adam to portray a truth Adam redeemed
[59:17] his adulterous wife now Christ pays the
[59:21] price of redemption he's even rejected
[59:24] of his own but that price that's the
[59:26] price of redemption
[59:27] he pays it
[59:29] now paid there's another part to
[59:32] Redemption now that it's paid
[59:35] could you could you agree with me
[59:39] how remarkable church history is
[59:44] and how the New Testament so quickly
[59:47] begins to talk about the church's
[59:49] lukewarm
[59:50] it's become defiled by the Antichrist
[59:52] spirit
[59:53] and so Paul engages us to Christ
[59:57] but based upon the things that brother
[59:58] I'm saying based upon church history
[1:00:00] based upon the way that we come into the
[1:00:01] world because after Christ paid the
[1:00:03] price we didn't all start having
[1:00:04] children by Spoken Word
[1:00:06] but your first husband
[1:00:10] so in the sermon super sign
[1:00:12] he says what did Adam do when he come to
[1:00:14] his wife when he come to her he found
[1:00:16] her pregnant
[1:00:17] of an evil her own conception had
[1:00:20] received foul seed
[1:00:21] Jehovah before he could marry his wife
[1:00:24] did the same thing and he's saying it I
[1:00:26] believe the way he says it it's
[1:00:27] reflective certainly in the Jews
[1:00:31] you'll find that in spoken words The
[1:00:34] Original Seed in some other places
[1:00:35] brother Brown's making the same point so
[1:00:36] it's not just this
[1:00:38] one place he says in Jesus before he
[1:00:40] could get to his bride she had organized
[1:00:42] herself and become the Roman Catholic
[1:00:44] Church same thing
[1:00:48] this is his bride this is his church
[1:00:51] this is the one he's coming back he
[1:00:53] wants to come back and find Faith he
[1:00:54] wants to he wants to come back and find
[1:00:56] a virtuous woman this he's wanting to
[1:00:58] find her I paid the price I've redeemed
[1:01:00] you I've shed my blood I've made these
[1:01:01] great precious promises surely you'll
[1:01:03] you'll stay faithful you'll hold out to
[1:01:06] it to the end the church will just keep
[1:01:07] rise this trajectory but brother Brown
[1:01:09] says the cycle of Revival and death has
[1:01:11] never failed
[1:01:12] and they're getting they get lukewarm
[1:01:14] and Powerless and we see this through
[1:01:15] the whole history of the church ages he
[1:01:16] says but he will have a bride don't you
[1:01:19] worry
[1:01:20] that will be bought with his word just
[1:01:22] exactly what he told me to stay with he
[1:01:24] will have a church amen that will be
[1:01:26] bought by his word
[1:01:31] amen and so you have these women these
[1:01:33] types of chosen
[1:01:36] uh supplied failure chosen supplied
[1:01:39] failure
[1:01:41] and then brother Brandon makes the
[1:01:42] statement I think it's an invisible
[1:01:43] Union and now he finds her all messed up
[1:01:48] you'd think he'd marry such a thing as
[1:01:49] that
[1:01:51] now it's a rhetorical question that I
[1:01:54] believe
[1:01:55] is answered in one light of of course
[1:01:57] not
[1:01:58] right
[1:02:00] is that knife finds her in this mess you
[1:02:02] think he'd marry such a thing as that
[1:02:05] but I want you and I think that again I
[1:02:08] think the rhetorical answers he's saying
[1:02:10] no she he won't
[1:02:12] not in that mess
[1:02:17] hey there's a lot of people that believe
[1:02:19] the message
[1:02:21] and really what they believe is a mess
[1:02:22] age
[1:02:24] and that's what they're in
[1:02:27] but brother Branham now go listen to the
[1:02:30] sermon I think you'll see this theme
[1:02:31] come through this perfectly but now your
[1:02:34] bridegroom is here to wash you
[1:02:37] to to that old husband is dead he's
[1:02:40] wanting to this is wanting he's wanting
[1:02:42] this to be portrayed so now if you'll
[1:02:44] turn to Hosea chapter 3 he's already
[1:02:45] taken this woman of many whoredoms now
[1:02:48] he's portrayed this and now in Hosea
[1:02:51] chapter 2 he said this is what I'm going
[1:02:53] to do this is what I want to do this I'm
[1:02:55] going to sow her unto me and now notice
[1:02:57] what happens in Hosea chapter 3 verses 1
[1:03:00] to 5.
[1:03:01] we're choosing Our Own Adventure can we
[1:03:04] go to Jose three
[1:03:05] would you like to go to a song you know
[1:03:07] 112 in the hymnal take the name of Jesus
[1:03:11] with you
[1:03:12] he says then said the Lord unto me go
[1:03:15] yet love a woman beloved of a friend yet
[1:03:18] an adulteress
[1:03:20] wait what
[1:03:22] did I get back to the beginning
[1:03:25] did Hosea stutter
[1:03:27] what happened it seems like we're back
[1:03:29] in Hosea 1 again
[1:03:31] and there's a lot a lot that read this
[1:03:33] to say that this is actually a different
[1:03:34] woman many conclude that this is
[1:03:37] actually Gomer again here he is he takes
[1:03:38] a woman to many whoredoms and he takes
[1:03:41] her and he's going to make her wife but
[1:03:43] she can't stay true
[1:03:46] so now the Lord is down to go yet and
[1:03:48] love a woman beloved of her friend
[1:03:51] yet an adulteress
[1:03:54] and as I've read the different
[1:03:55] commentaries on how people try to how
[1:03:57] the different historians try to break it
[1:03:59] down who it might be whether it's Gomer
[1:04:01] or another one I see the bride either
[1:04:03] way
[1:04:04] he says according to the love of the
[1:04:07] Lord to the children of Israel
[1:04:10] how can this be
[1:04:12] he takes Gomer a woman of many whoredoms
[1:04:15] and yet she fails and he says go again
[1:04:21] a woman beloved again really again
[1:04:25] how not according to love of Hosea
[1:04:29] not according to our love
[1:04:31] not not according to some infatuation or
[1:04:35] some codependency or some kind of feel
[1:04:37] ill love according to the love of the
[1:04:39] god the love of Lord to the children of
[1:04:41] Israel who took down their gods and the
[1:04:43] flagons of the love flagons of wine
[1:04:46] so Jose so I bought her to me
[1:04:51] for 15 pieces of silver
[1:04:54] and for a homer of barley and a half
[1:04:56] Homer of barley you know what it amounts
[1:04:58] to
[1:04:59] fifth the 30 pieces of silver
[1:05:03] and 30 pieces of silver really indicates
[1:05:07] a lot
[1:05:08] in this
[1:05:10] was the price for a Slave
[1:05:13] the price for a woman of a certain age
[1:05:16] and it was the price that Judas received
[1:05:19] for Christ
[1:05:21] no more than a Slave
[1:05:23] trivial amount is how a lot of people
[1:05:25] look at it
[1:05:26] but what what did it really signify
[1:05:29] it was the price
[1:05:31] for her
[1:05:33] the price Hosea paid
[1:05:35] for her
[1:05:36] and I said unto her
[1:05:38] Thou shalt abide for me many days
[1:05:42] Thou shalt not play the Harlot Thou
[1:05:45] shalt not be for another man so will I
[1:05:49] also be for thee
[1:05:52] I know that Israel holds a natural type
[1:05:55] but I believe the bride is the mystery
[1:05:57] of this
[1:05:58] that yet again he says I will redeem her
[1:06:04] I will pay the price for her I will do
[1:06:07] what it takes and the story of hosea's
[1:06:09] relationship with Gomer I say it
[1:06:12] probably defies logic and human
[1:06:14] understanding but it portrays God's love
[1:06:16] for his Gentile bride though it speaks
[1:06:19] in type for Israel it also speaks of the
[1:06:22] bride and notice how he says you shall
[1:06:24] wait many days Thou shalt not play the
[1:06:27] Harlot Thou shalt not before another man
[1:06:29] he shall wait many days on spouse but I
[1:06:34] will marry Thee I am only for thee I
[1:06:38] will redeem thee
[1:06:39] and he says for the children of Israel
[1:06:42] shall abide many days without a king and
[1:06:43] without a prince and without a sacrifice
[1:06:45] and without an image and without an
[1:06:46] ephod and without a teraphim afterwards
[1:06:49] shall the children of Israel return I
[1:06:51] see such a beautiful image of the
[1:06:52] restoration of the temple such a
[1:06:54] beautiful image of the Restoration in
[1:06:55] the Millennium shall return and seek the
[1:06:57] Lord their God in David their King and
[1:07:00] shall fear the lord and his goodness in
[1:07:02] the latter days and I say before we get
[1:07:05] there the son of man comes not son of
[1:07:07] David but son of man to take the Gentile
[1:07:10] bride to himself and he says I know what
[1:07:14] you've done I know that you're Fallen
[1:07:16] but this in the end time I come yet
[1:07:20] again to redeem you
[1:07:23] and you will have no other lovers
[1:07:27] and nor will I have any other church or
[1:07:31] any other bride
[1:07:34] that's why it's called the bright age
[1:07:37] he says in the invisible unit of the
[1:07:39] Bride In Christ your old book of
[1:07:40] divorcement is put away
[1:07:42] and it's dead absolutely out of
[1:07:45] existence even in the mind of God
[1:07:49] you know what the revelation of
[1:07:50] justification is
[1:07:51] you never did it in the first place
[1:07:54] now I know that you think that means you
[1:07:58] never did it be in when you did it
[1:08:02] right but you never did it in the first
[1:08:04] place who do we want to give the first
[1:08:06] place who is it that has the preeminence
[1:08:09] you never did it in the first place
[1:08:11] you never did it in the mind of God if
[1:08:13] you ate it from his point of view as far
[1:08:16] as he's concerned in his heart he this
[1:08:19] is the power of God not to wipe it off
[1:08:22] and start all over and put a billion
[1:08:24] planets out there but he has the power
[1:08:27] to redeem you as if you never did it in
[1:08:31] the first place from his vantage point
[1:08:33] from his point of view
[1:08:36] and so in his eyes it's as if you never
[1:08:38] did it in the first place in his eyes
[1:08:40] you're spotless you're pure you're
[1:08:43] sinless you're purchased
[1:08:46] oh Hallelujah he's bought me
[1:08:50] he's bought me in on purpose I'm purpose
[1:08:52] in my heart though I may seem to play
[1:08:55] the part of this one in Hosea I see a
[1:08:58] bridegroom who's committed I see one who
[1:09:01] won't give up and it's that perfect love
[1:09:03] that's going to win in me
[1:09:06] good
[1:09:08] brother Branham in the sermon
[1:09:11] recognizing your day and its message
[1:09:14] Brothers you could please come to your
[1:09:15] instruments and
[1:09:17] and start playing a song
[1:09:20] and the sermon recognizing your day in
[1:09:22] its message
[1:09:24] brother Branham draws a parallel
[1:09:26] between Israel and the bride
[1:09:30] and he's using Hosea
[1:09:35] and and as he does it
[1:09:38] remember the title is
[1:09:40] uh recognizing your day and its message
[1:09:44] and there's so much being said about the
[1:09:45] Jews
[1:09:47] but he's wanting you to see
[1:09:49] your place
[1:09:51] your day and your message
[1:09:54] and he uses this text see if you can't
[1:09:56] identify yourself in this this is what
[1:09:59] I'd like to say at the close of this
[1:10:01] service in light of what he promised
[1:10:03] Hosea 1 Hosea you show you portrayed
[1:10:06] this for me you go take a woman who had
[1:10:08] who had had been an adulterer you take
[1:10:11] her
[1:10:12] and you make her your wife
[1:10:14] and you and you you she her her her life
[1:10:17] her children what comes from her is
[1:10:19] going to tell a story
[1:10:21] and you can see you can see Israel just
[1:10:23] portrayed in that
[1:10:24] and then he says I'm going to sow her
[1:10:26] unto me and the Earth
[1:10:27] and and he says this in in chapter two
[1:10:30] I'm going to sell her unto me in the
[1:10:31] Earth this this is what's going to come
[1:10:33] forth and then he has Hosea take take
[1:10:37] Gomer or another woman of many whoredoms
[1:10:39] and adults who's begun into slavery into
[1:10:42] bondage he says by her
[1:10:44] and I bought her
[1:10:46] and he says according to my love
[1:10:49] for Israel and it speaks of this
[1:10:52] beautiful Redemption this time uh
[1:10:54] Israel's Redemption is time in the
[1:10:55] millennium
[1:10:57] and and it continues in chapter four and
[1:11:00] there's more rebukes but then finally
[1:11:02] Hosea 6 says verse 1 come
[1:11:05] and let us return unto the Lord
[1:11:08] this this is what these actions portray
[1:11:11] this is what it ought to bring out of us
[1:11:14] it is not not what he told the woman
[1:11:16] when he bought her abide
[1:11:18] abstain
[1:11:20] don't don't go back to that anymore you
[1:11:22] can't go back to that other thing that
[1:11:24] other thing is dead you got to remain
[1:11:26] true you got to remain pure State you've
[1:11:29] got to remain I'm only for you you're
[1:11:31] only for me so he says come let us
[1:11:33] return unto the Lord
[1:11:35] for you have torn and he will heal us
[1:11:37] hath Smith and he will bind us up after
[1:11:39] two days he will revive us
[1:11:42] in the third day
[1:11:44] brother Bram says those those days one
[1:11:47] thousand years two thousand years
[1:11:49] here we are in the third day
[1:11:51] he'll raise us up and we shall live in
[1:11:54] his sight
[1:11:55] then shall we know
[1:11:57] we follow on to know the Lord
[1:11:59] his going forth as prepared as the
[1:12:01] morning and he shall come to us
[1:12:04] as the rain
[1:12:06] as the latter and former Reign under the
[1:12:08] Earth
[1:12:10] in order to do what
[1:12:12] get what he's looking for
[1:12:14] just as the rain falls upon the Earth to
[1:12:17] bring forth the seed which was sown and
[1:12:20] that which he's looking for
[1:12:22] so in this last day it falls together to
[1:12:25] bring you forth
[1:12:27] can you see the love story
[1:12:30] can you see his commitment to you
[1:12:33] and how we're portrayed in the story
[1:12:35] and that God writes a love story that
[1:12:38] goal that goes ahead and just kind of
[1:12:40] tells the worst of it
[1:12:42] in order so that we could come to a
[1:12:43] place in this hour and know
[1:12:46] that with each day that this continues
[1:12:49] there's one reason and that's love
[1:12:53] and that's the dresser saying hold on
[1:12:56] hold on
[1:12:58] just wait
[1:12:59] she's coming
[1:13:01] just wait
[1:13:03] she's coming
[1:13:05] he's holding it back because this Earth
[1:13:07] must give up
[1:13:10] it must yield every seed
[1:13:14] and I'm so glad to know could it be that
[1:13:17] the Earth is already beginning to shake
[1:13:20] but had been at the Earth is not already
[1:13:23] beginning to recognize that the purpose
[1:13:25] for which we were created that the
[1:13:28] reason for which we are even here is to
[1:13:31] see the Glorious manifestations of the
[1:13:33] sons of God is the Sea of Bride of his
[1:13:35] choosing and she is risen
[1:13:40] Hallelujah
[1:13:42] could it be that even the Earth is
[1:13:44] beginning to recognize the Fulfillment
[1:13:46] of purpose
[1:13:47] as the bride is bathed in perfect love
[1:13:52] oh what a great mystery that's portrayed
[1:13:54] in Scripture
[1:13:56] God bless you tonight
[1:13:58] let's Stand Together
