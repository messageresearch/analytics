TRANSCRIPT
========================================
galatians chapter 6 verses 1 to 10 brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted bear you one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ for man think himself to be something when he has nothing he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall you also reap for he that soweth his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting this is a labor and this is a work and all these things are building even to this verse and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not so that's the admonition to persevere and as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith so we are admonished to do good unto all men that that way our days are do not consist of trying to find out who's good and who's bad who we can be good to who we don't have to be good to but do good unto all men especially those of the household of faith you can be seated i have a lot that i'd like to get to this evening so we're going to jump right into it and as i look out upon the congregation tonight i see that most of you have been with us in this subject matter so far on barriers and boundaries and then which we could say just even backgrounding that there's a difference between a boundary a boundary expresses the limits of something and how far something reaches whereas a barrier would be an obstacle or a hindrance and we looked at on sunday on the pride paradox and i want to go further in this subject matter not sure if we'll get as far as i'd like to tonight or just exactly how the lord would lead i'm just taking a uh exhaling and just going to relax and share what's in my heart but we want to continue on this subject and we kind of identified on sunday how pride can be both a boundary and a barrier there can be an upside to it a downside to it and i think maybe the idea that there can be a good pride may seem foreign to some of us but i think we're zeroing in on that and hopefully understanding a little bit better in terms of a godly jealousy there's a way that we could have certain feelings and emotions that have a positive aspect to it and pride in its truest sense isn't always negative or wrong but in pride it can both hinder us and that would be the bad side or it can help us and that's the positive positive pride that we're talking about and where we were ending on sunday is some statements where brother brown was saying stay in your territory using that exact language that phrase you have to stay in your territory and so that's a place that god has called us to it's a jurisdiction something we have control over as the children of israel were being placed in the promised land it was like you belong here to this mountain city to this area to this region and it was they were to stay in their territory to stay in their place and so that's something that we're expressing to you tonight wanting to continue on and piggyback on that we have to stay in our territory as it was stay in our place and i'm just going to express this maybe now as i think about it and i'm just trying to rearrange my audio pack here just in case it could be the side that i'm placing it on if that's causing the signal to drop but um i'm going to take a unique approach tonight to scriptures that we're very familiar with and i'm trusting that in in referencing them and kind of bringing them into our conversation on this subject that you can allow the holy spirit to quicken these things to you uh because we want to bring these things up and maybe just add add some emphasis that might help you and i think it may be a little bit of a unique approach um so you might have to again just be very deliberate and and trying to uh kind of catch what god is wanting to say to you because i don't ever want to just think that you have to see it my way what i want you to do is see it the way god wants you to see it and so in proverbs chapter 7 21 i'm just going to start here and jump into the subject of pride and bring it from a more traditional viewpoint in terms of what pride is it says in proverbs 21 4 a high look and a proud heart and the plowing of the wicked is sin so a high look and a proud heart the bible is saying or sin and that's a haughtiness that's an arrogance it is when the bible says a high look and a proud heart it's speaking of a swollen estimate of oneself and one thing i want you to kind of catch in this when the bible's talking about a the nastiness of pride or pride that is nasty it's it's a place where you begin to think of yourself in such a way to where you look down upon everyone else and so on one hand it's good to think of yourself as you are that you have maybe some gifts or some talents or some calling or some position and so there to see yourself as appropriately and there be some be some value and worth there's one thing but where it kind of flips and you're seeing yourself the wrong way is it from that place of blessing and benefit you start looking down upon everyone else and that's what the bible's identifying as a bad pride is this looking down on others and seeing yourself as better than them in proverbs chapter 16 verse 18 it says pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall if you looked at the hebrew of these two words a pride and haughty spirit you'd find that in their use in other places they don't always take on a negative connotation and so if you just kind of had this word and said pride and used it maybe in the sense that a hebrew would your immediate thought wouldn't be oh destruction if you even used uh one of the the root of holy spirit you look at they think that maybe something's exalted or something's lifted you wouldn't necessarily immediately think just in that hebrew word alone that something a fall is going to take place but the context is narrowing the meaning of these words pride and i don't think there's a way that you could use haughty spirit in a positive context like man i'm really proud of your holy spirit and so it's just the way that it's translated kind of puts it in the context that it's meant pride in a holy spirit it's showing us there's an arrogance there and so pride goes before destruction holy spirit before a fall the context is telling us there's an attitude there's a thought process there's a way that you can be yourself that is negative and detrimental and that's the bible's narrowing in on this in james chapter 4 verse 6 speaking of god but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble so god is going to give grace to the humble a broken and contrite spirit he'll not despise and so this is the lifting up of a brokenness it's lifting up of someone who has a modest estimation of their self but it says god resist the proud i just think of that how pride is a barrier to god dealing with you or a boundary that god won't cross it becomes a barrier to you receiving his presence and how that that pride is something has to be torn down something that god has to address to which keeps him from enveloping us and blessing us because he resists the proud but this is what if you just looked up the definition and the the greek lexicon for proud it's showing oneself above others actually says over topping so someone is always wanting to outdo somebody else someone tells a story and it's like oh i got a better one you know it's somebody you know somebody's somebody's family member just died it's like well when my mom died and all it is is about their grief and what they're going through that can be an evidence of pride there's always this overtopping out doing so showing oneself above others over topping conspicuous wanting to be conspicuous above others look at me to have the preeminence and it says with an overweening estimate and over when it means an excessive pride and excessive confidence in others it's not appropriate an overweening estimate of one's means or merits just also despising sort of the overestimation of one's means their abilities their gifts their talents or their merits what they've accomplished or despising others or even treating them with contempt hardiness this is what the bible says that it god resists the proud so this isn't uh rejoicing in something this isn't being proud of your children or or you you did a good job and thinking it to be worthy of something it's a very specific mindset it's a pride is synonymous with vanity or vainglory it's an empty pretender it's somebody who boasts and it's just a vanity because there's really nothing there and so we could put it this way that there is a we've talked about a good pride on sunday and where this thought process uh veers into something that's detrimental or destructive is when it goes beyond a proper boundary you could think well of yourself and think highly of yourself but you begin to you cross the boundary of thinking that you're better than somebody else because of that or you cross this boundary and think more of yourself than you actually are that's when you've gone from something that could be healthy very healthy thought process into this baseless empty vein destructive thought process that the scriptures are identified in proverbs 21 proverbs 16 chapter 4 and countless other scriptures that we could use to zero in on the nastiness of pride and i feel that we hear a lot about that kind of pride right when we all agree we hear a lot about that pride so we maybe don't need to reinforce that but i do think it's necessary to emphasize a little bit as we're trying to contrast it with good pride but then put it in the context of barriers and boundaries and a a bad pride doesn't respect boundaries if someone has a haughtiness your your your boundary is a barrier to them they'll look at that and they don't have respect for that well that limits them that keeps them from saying what they want to say that keeps them from doing what they want to do or that that's kind of walled you off from them and they'll perceive it a certain way and so a bad pride doesn't respect boundaries and i i'm just saying this and trusting that it resonates within your heart someone who's arrogant and has pride is impulsive because the only thing they're answering to is their needs the only thing they're answering to is their desires the only thing they're answering to is this sense of self and if me wants it me gets it right if it's something they desire something they think they ought to have so bad pride is very impulsive and bad pride always acts with the self in view so bad pride is self-preserving so i'm going to act to preserve myself and it's also self-protecting i'm going to do something to protect myself and this is something that uh in itself is a is a barrier uh and acts against someone's even good intentions and and i'm i hopefully can touch on it maybe later and i'm just kind of glancing here on some of my scriptures just to know whether or not i could maybe insert this later on but there's times when we act and we think that we're acting out of someone else's benefit but we're actually doing it for our own selves and it's really easy to justify a service a labor a given a word an intrusion you say well i'm doing it for them i'm doing it for you and not realizing that what we're really trying to do is pat ourselves on the back or appease our own conscience or do something for ourselves and so we've justified a behavior we've justified something we've said we justified even a conduct or even a certain discipline because it's for somebody else but not realizing really in reality it's more feeding our pride and our sense of accomplishment our own merits or our own abilities our own means so it's something just to keep in mind if we don't touch on it later and so if we look at humility antithesis to pride that you have pride but then you have this humility humility respect boundaries uh if you have the ability to do something and you have power you have strength you have opportunity and you have privilege if you have humility with that then you'll respect somebody else's boundary even though you have power to bypass it or the right to do so because humility will allow you to do something one thing we have to remember that as a christian we never do something out of power privilege or opportunity that we can otherwise accomplish by the word and humility just because you can do it doesn't mean you need to do it just because you have the power the opportunity the privilege to do something don't do it by those means when you can do the same thing through the word and humility and so humility which is the opposite of pride will respect boundaries and and with humility even if you look at the definition of humility it's the lack of false pride because there can be a pride that's false a pride that is is arrogant and self-serving and beyond the natural bounds and beyond what is reasonable and so humility itself is modesty and attitude modesty and spirit that's kind of what is thought of in terms of humility and again humility is different than poverty because you could you look at somebody and they're broke and they don't have anything so oh he's humble well no he's broke you look at somebody's very very weak and can't fend for themselves and and they don't have any power they don't have they don't have this they don't have that they don't have means they don't have opportunity they don't have privilege and those things you say oh well he's real humble well that could just be something that's been stripped of everything and so it's not just in that alone but it's a modesty that uh is coming from a sense of it's even a modesty that may seem incongruent with what they actually have i hope that you can understand what i'm trying to say that when you we often are going to say somebody's humble when we in our minds we think they have every right to act the opposite somebody who's not always flaunting their wealth and we're like man they could but look at how they live or somebody who could always be inserting themselves they could but look at how they act maybe you're in a situation where people are talking about something and somebody's going on and on about a particular subject and this person is just running their mouth telling you everything you know and you're kind of looking at the guy who's the expert like this guy spent like 12 years on this you know he's a doctor like this guy knows what he's and he never never says anything and just oh wow that's interesting that's really neat that you say that because the people how many have heard the story before someone's got some real hot sports opinions about something they're going on and on about something and they're talking to the very person who wrote the book they're talking about the very person who who came up with the idea the very one that uh the very one that is the the progenitor of an idea i had a professor in law school who was um he's such a brilliant uh professor brilliant um legal scholar he's called the god of texas trial law and people would actually call the law school just to see if the guy was real is there really a guy named dorsenio and uh and i interned for him at one time and he's a very brilliant person and he's such a brilliant legal scholar that sometimes entities would put him on retainer just to keep him out of the fight like we want you on our side you're not gonna do a thing you're on retainer that way the other guys can't go and hire you and he's in an appellate argument one time and an attorney was making the argument says when the writers of this rule wrote this rule they meant exactly this and so it came his turn to talk and he says your honor i wrote that rule and i'll tell you what i meant when i wrote it and that's because god bless him professor der sanyo who just recently retired was not humble right he's going to let you know i wrote the rule and i'll tell you what i meant and so humility would be just to get up there and argue the opposite say well the writers of this rule meant this that and the other and then find out later oh he's the one that wrote it that makes sense what a kind of to understand humility a little bit better and so this a bad pride disrespects boundaries and becomes a barrier even to your good intentions and then um a good pride which is joined with humility is going to be what you need to set your own boundaries and that it just kind of dawned on me now i know where i'm going to end up where i'm going with this and so i'm kind of i'm not hiding the ball tonight that's what i'm wanting to emphasize tonight is how a good pride is what's actually going to help you set boundaries it's going to what causes you to say this is enough but then it's also going to be what causes you to persevere beyond barriers and and that's when paul says be not weary and well doing we're talking about uh we looked at how brother graham identified this great characteristic of being perseverant it's a good pride that makes us persevere it's a good pride that makes us to be persistent it's a good pride that will cause us to keep knocking up against a barrier something in our way until we beat it and we don't shriek back and oh i'm not going to do it i'm a failure it takes a little bit of that persistence and a good pride to do it now i'm going very very slow tonight unintentionally but if we could look at galatians chapter 6 i'm going to read verses 1 to 5 and hopefully just take off here brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault we're going to read through this and then and then back up to it because i want you to kind of look at it all together ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted so one has fallen you haven't but you could you need to consider yourself brethren he says bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ bear ye one another's burdens for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work that he and this is something where you prove you deem it worthy to prove your work means my work is worthy to prove your work means this is worthy of labor this is worthy of doing and then shall he have rejoice in himself alone when you realize that what you've been called to do has value then you'll rejoice in the fruits of your labor and you can do that alone in your own calling your own works and not by comparing your works to somebody else's and on another for every man every man shall bear his own burden notice how interesting that is to verse two bear you one another's burdens but now for every man shall bear his own burden now in verse nine paul is admonishing us to be perseverant saying be not weary and well doing and i i what stood out to me in the scripture is how that he's telling us to be not weary and well doing because it's a characteristic of even what he's talking about here in verse four to prove your own works that you have rejoicing in yourself alone it's a characteristic of this good pride that we're talking about but before before he tells us to be not weary and well doing and to persevere into as we have opportunity to do good and to sow to the spirit because all these things are worthy labor and god is not mocked if you sow good things you're going to get good things if you sow bad things you're going to get bad things before he even comes to that place he addresses a bad pride in verse 1 and verse 3. look at how he says it brethren if a man would be overtaken in a fault you which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lust but also be tempted and then verse three for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself he addresses this bad pride in verse one and verse three as a barrier to fulfilling verse two because he says forebear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill remember this phrase the law of christ so there's a law of christ there's a command of christ and in order to fulfill that we have to bear one another's burdens and he's telling us verse 1 and verse 2 identify the barriers to bearing one another's burdens i know you're listening and trying to pay close attention because that's some uh this is we're dissecting this and maybe uh bringing causing to ponder this a little bit differently but he's he's talking about an attitude of superiority if a man thinks himself to be something when he's not that thing and he's talking about bury you one another's burden so fulfill the law of christ be saying before you just roll up your sleeves and rush out there to help somebody with what's bringing them down and and overloading them you cannot go into that thinking that you're better than them and you can't do it with this attitude of superiority so as much as i'd want to run on that course for 88 parts i'm wanting just to kind of bring that up in your mind how he's talking about this attitude of superiority so in verse 1 he says you must do it in a spirit of meekness considering your own selves a spirit of meekness and an honesty about yourself so he's talking about an arrogance and a pride and he's bringing up what these anecdotes will be to that is this meekness which would be humility with your power because meekness is not weakness right doesn't that sound good meekness is not weakness we've heard it a million times meekness is not weakness it is the truth just because you're meek doesn't mean you're weak and so if you have meekness it's not i'll go in there all week unable to help and you're just complete worthless junk bag and you're just getting in the way but that's what we want you to do it's going in there with this humility a meekness and an honesty about yourself this is the anecdote this is the song this is how you can avoid this arrogance barging into a situation to help somebody is by being meek and by being honest about yourself i i wonder this if i could just ask everybody here and anybody who'll hear this on archive anybody streaming right now be honest do you look down on anybody and if you do you should think long and hard about the whole act of looking down on somebody else i mean i almost thought we'd stop now and have a prayer meeting right and we'd have a prayer line but i'd need someone to pray for me so we wouldn't have anyone to start it right but that's the truth who do you look down on i don't go ahead let your imagination run wild in this day and age of all the rights and all all the genders and everything who do you look down on and if there's if you answer that at all you should start asking yourself why in the world would i do that and so paul is talking about a meekness and honesty about yourself and he's talking about a proper opinion and care for yourself because he's he says it's it's not he's not working maybe in progression in terms of he says well bear you want to know there's burdens and then you're working in progression in maturity it's he's if we could look at this bear you want to know the burdens as his subject matter and what he's kind of bringing the church to at the end of this galatians book you're going to bear one another's burden so he's saying if you're going to help somebody even you can say start with that brethren there's going to be people that make mistakes and you're going to need to be the ones that help them because you're spiritual but if you're going to help them you got to do with the spirit of meekness so what is he doing he's kind of backing up spirit of meekness and a proper estimation of yourself so when paul gets to for every man shall bear his own burden he's not necessarily saying take care of everybody else's burdens and then take care of your own he's talking about a proper opinion about yourself prove your own work think of it to be worthy so you can have rejoicing in yourself alone and take care of yourself then take care of others i want to circle back to that maybe in a little bit hold that in your minds right now because when paul is talking about a bad pride there's also a good pride and pride is about self estimation right if anybody agrees with that say amen pride is about self estimation and pride is about self perception and so boundaries even if we're talking about boundaries boundaries that you set boundaries are critical we will set boundaries when we have the proper self-estimation or just a boundary that we said is based upon our own self-estimation and our own self-perception so notice what i just did there pride is about self estimation boundaries about self-esteem think about it pride has to do with self-perception but boundaries also have to do with perceiving who you are what defines me who am i what do i do what's my responsibility so there's some understanding and an estimation of your of your jurisdiction of what you're responsible for who you are what god's made you to be and really galatians chapter 6 are just some beautifully deep scriptures about barriers and boundaries and the role of pride they're just linked together so paul is talking about this proper opinion of yourself and even caring for yourself when he says every man shall bear his own burden and remember every man shall bear his own burden what god has given him to bear and but bear you one another's burdens that's in a different sense a different word altogether of bringing somebody else down now in romans chapter 12 verse 3 it says for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith and i know we're just putting on a another layer of paint over what we ministered on sunday but he says every man should not think of himself more than he ought to think but think soberly according as god have dealt to every man the measure of faith so we shouldn't think more highly or inappropriately of ourselves but we ought to think of ourselves within our measure so we shouldn't think no more no less when the bible tells us not to think more of ourselves it's not given us full liberty to think less of yourself we are not called as christians to think less of ourselves and devalue ourselves and degrade ourselves and to humiliate ourselves in a nasty way but whereas they to think of yourself within measure measure means a determined extent or a portion some sort of limit think of yourself within your boundaries or the abilities that god has given you says every man has a measure of faith and any measure of faith is valuable and and there's a if i could say this i've been very pulled into this area and i almost thought i was gonna just uh even at the last minute thought i might minister on the subject how that when we put when we have the holy ghost with measure it has not limited the power of the holy ghost so though there's measure it doesn't mean limits doesn't mean limits to blessing and power and and and the things that god wants to pour out upon us so let's notice this word he uses but we ought to don't think more of yourself but think soberly and soberly means to be in the right mind to be in a sound mind to exercise self-control so when you think soberly about yourself is to think of yourself in your right mind because someone could be drunk on themselves and have a a inappropriate estimation of their ability and this is what they when they talk about someone who's intoxicated and they think oh i could jump over that they they've kind of overestimated their abilities i could do that they've overestimated their power their strength and they do it through intoxication and so when you are sober you're in your right mind and you're able to exercise self-control you you have a sense of moderation and so self-control if you could uh take this subject matter and i'm throwing in there and again i know i'm just hitting high points in this and i could drill down a lot deeper on each one of these things but i feel just to present it this way self self control is at the heart of barriers and boundaries because it's going to take self-control to not uh trespass across someone else's boundaries but it's going to take some self-control to push your past yourself past past a barrier because some of us some of us are really good it's like oh oh no that's going to be hard no that's going to be difficult and we don't want to do it but you need to have self-control what do we often think about self-control causing ourselves not to but sometimes self-control is causing us to do you control yourself i'm going to persevere through this i'm going to push beyond this barrier this this thing that is limiting that is keeping me from my full potential i'm going to press beyond that so self-control is at the heart of barriers and boundaries you control yourself and you set you set the boundaries and parameters for yourself but then you also respect somebody else's and then pride is related to self-control boundaries are related to self-control what i just did there i said pride has to do with self-control boundaries has to do with self-control and a good pride which is a the healthy self view i don't think we're at any um disadvantage tonight by not taking more time to expound upon a good pride i think you're just right there with me a good pride this healthy view of your person a healthy view of the job you're doing let every man prove his own work and demon worthy will lead to a greater perseverance and even as paul talks about hey those that strive for the mastery and natural things discipline themselves and keep themselves under their uh bring their body into subjection they control themselves and they do it to obtain a corrupt crown when you deem your labor worthy and the goal worthy you're willing to control yourself because it makes it more expedient to the end and so you have to have a healthy view of what you're doing and you have to have a healthy view of what you're going to get from what you're doing in order to in order to have the kind of self-control that's going to cause you to persevere and cause you to do the right things in order to achieve the goal i i don't think that would sound foreign to us tonight can you get the word picture in your mind that there's a there's a healthy pride that we can have of our labor and what we're going to get from it that's going to cause us to stay on task but then also cause us to be future looking saying this is going to pay off one day this is going to be worth it where is it a lot of us fail even in rearing our children is we we're not willing to make the sacrifices early on and be proactive to do things and stick to it and take the difficult times and the hard nights and the and the arduous process of disciplining our children and making the right decisions because we believe it's worth it and we can see down the road that one day it's going to have a payoff but instead we give in and we become very reactive instead of proactive and reactive parenting the root of it's often in pride because your children do something that makes you look bad should we just for all the single people without kids are like go hit it brother him go for it brother loyal's over here saying go ahead brother aaron hit it but it's true a lot of times when we act as parents knee-jerk in the moment and it's pride that's motivated because we feel shamed but to be very careful the emotions were given into in those moments but if you have if you could if you have this lack of parenting parental pride and you can operate in an area of humility and self-control respect your own child's boundaries uh respect the boundaries of a parent then you're willing to control yourself and you're willing to look at the fruits that to be gained later on by all by the identifying the goal some of you some of the parents are pulling me into this area like now forget the single people i want to hear about this it's a very important principle and the message perseverant and i was looking at i've been asked by a few people which one are you quoting from which one are you quoting from there's like nine different times where abraham preached this sermon so i hope some of you have listened to all of them trying to figure out which one it was i was studying but the message perseverance says men through all ages that's ever tried to achieve something has been persistent and it's important to note when brother brand preaches something consistently 62 63 64 he preaches this sermon multiple times in the year men through all ages that's ever tried to achieve something has been persistent man in order to be persistent he said i might quote again this is interesting in order to be persistent is to know what you were after that sounds like confidence doesn't it that person knows what they're after they're confident they know what they're going for and if you do not know you are not certain of your standing you are not certain of your standing again that speaks to confidence someone being certain someone you might even speak of a pride if we could use that word you have to know what you're after you do certain of what you have what of your standing but when you thoroughly understand what it is what you are after and are satisfied you're going to do it this is confidence this is not an arrogance this is not a cockiness this is not a presumption but this is a this is at the root of being persevered and being persistent you're satisfied you're going to do it then you can be persistent get really holding on and this is you'll find in these series of sermons in a number of places brother-in-law's talking about perseverance being what it takes to get past barriers it becomes a consistent theme that brother brahma identifies if you're going to get past a barrier if you're going to get past the sin barrier i think he says the sound barrier is the sin of unbelief the the barrier the sound barrier between faith and disbelief you've got to get past that you've got to get past that berries and you're going to have to be persistent so there has to be there has to be some spiritual confidence there to be some spiritual know-how there has to be some spiritual uh pride and knowing where you stand in jesus christ and and knowing that you can do it and i can do all things through christ who gives me strength with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible and this is what it takes to be perseverant and there are some remarkable things that exist within the academic world of how even in academia they're picking up on this connection between pride and perseverance tenacity and grit and resilience and how important some of these characteristics are and they'll write these big huge articles on it being wow you'll never know and malcolm gladwell right now is probably working on this great treatise on perseverance and grit and resilience it's like yeah buddy paul beat you to it right the bible the old testament new testament speaks of these characteristics that a a true son or daughter of god ought to have in order to become all that christ has ordained them to be and it lays right within the word of god to be persevered to be persistent and to do that there has to be some shoulders back some chin up right i can do this i can do this i need to i need to know what i'm after i'd be certain of where i'm standing thoroughly understand what it is and what you're after and then be satisfied that's powerful so they've done these studies where uh and immediately i think our homeschool kids like are just the kids like yeah that's what they do to us every day in school but they come up with an annoying task and they ask someone to come in they get all these participants come in and participate in this study and they ask them to do this real annoying task but once they've accomplished it with the not the control group but with the group that they're wanting to see how they respond they make them feel really good about it like wow you you are amazing 94th percentile you are better than 94 of the other people in this world when it comes to this very annoying mundane made up task it's actually made up statistic that they're better than 94 but what they're wanting to induce is pride not in a nasty way but in a good way to try to bring up instigate the right kind of ambition and aspiration and not oh wow you're really smart but that right kind of praise that provokes uh this like well you know what this is worthy this is good i should try this and this is what they found people who are feeling proud of their abilities significantly increased their efforts on the difficult mental rotation tasks so then they came up with a mundane task boring this is easy but they told somebody wow you're really good at this and then when they had them do an actually difficult con task they called it the difficult mental rotation they upped the time devoted to building their skills by 40 percent compared with the other people who weren't proud now this isn't a controlled kind of a they try to control it for different ways self-efficacy and ability and all these different things and and reading through some of the details of it i i thought it was really brilliant the way they structured these to where they can actually determine the impact a positive pride will have on somebody's effort and found that the people who had had this right kind of pride inspired inside of them they spent more than 40 percent compared to the other people who did the annoying task and they were asked to do the next one they did it 40 they spent 40 percent more time trying to hone their skill improve their ability to accomplish this difficult mental task than the other group that hadn't had their pride instigated was it talking about talking about practice talking about being perseverant and in order to do that there has to be something that's inspired and quicken on inside of the person and having this kind of pride this self-respect this this self value they find that it also is related to self increase in self control that it gives people a reason to moderate it gives people a reason to focus it gives them a reason uh to say no it gives them a reason to say yes to the right things and to have this kind of pride this right kind of self-respect in this right kind of self value not only increases your self-control to not transgress somebody else's boundaries but it's also going to give you the kind of self-control you need to defend your boundaries and i'm just going to throw this this one scripture out there i just actually when i put it in there and i'd put this scripture in my notes it's like wow that's just kind of out of the middle of nowhere but i want to come back to it later because i've been studying on what love is and what love ain't and and the boundaries and barriers in love and in marriage and in first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 4 says that every one of you should know how to we ought to know how to possess his vessel now based upon the context of this these verses there are some that believe that paul is referring to a man's wife there's others that believe and when i say psalm i'm not talking about people here i didn't poll everybody and asked who which one do you think it is but just within the theological realms and the different approaches in the scripture even minister friends of mine take it differently or see it in a different approach some see it as your own that possess his vessel speaks to his wife some see it as their own body that either way you need to know how to possess it appropriately because notice if it's your own body or if it's your wife or even both as it would have application you still have to know how to do it appropriately so there's no attitude this is mine because it's mine i i can do whatever i want this is mine i can behave however i want this is mine it it's within my control my power he says let every man every one of you know how to possess your vessel in sanctification and in honor so there's a right way to possess it if possession matters and it's within what's within your control then there has to be done it has to be done in sanctification it has to be undone in honor it has to be done the right way so there is a there's a positive pride that will cause us to be persevere it causes us to be exercise self-control and it's relating to these barriers and boundaries that we're talking about but this bad pride this hubris that we've mentioned before this bad pride because again the good pride is going to cause you to persevere even in the absence of immediate results because you see the long-range vision you have the goal in mind something that's coming at the end but when you're but bad pride it's only interested in immediate gratification it's looking to the the just the momentary monetary rewards or the conspicuous rewards that everyone else can see that everyone else can know and there's a lot of things we'll do impulsively as far as conspicuous spending or we want other people to think we have money or we want other people to think of how we dress and where we go to eat and what we wear and what we're doing it's kind of this pretense and it's all rooted in pride this bad pride will do that because it's only interested in lifting up the self and gratifying the self and this bad pride is at the root of boundary violations it's at the root of it it's at the it's at the root of boundary violations and at the root of barrier setting just as pride is at the root of all sin it's at the root of boundary violations because in the beginning what did brother branham say about the woman she couldn't wait it was an oncoming promise it was going to happen in god's time but she didn't wait she felt this sense of urgency what caused her to push past this boundary of god's word this sense of needing to be immediately gratified this sense of accomplishing something and so she couldn't wait this bad pride is impulsive he needs immediate satisfaction needs to be immediately gratified and in first john chapter 2 verse 16 for all that is in the world this is a very uh all-inclusive statement all that in the world is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life it's greed and pride joined together lust of the flesh and less of the eyes is almost summing up it's summed up in the pride of life this is what is in the world this is what's at the nastiness of our base instincts this is kind of at the root of satan's sin this is at the root of the original sin the lust of the flesh to the lust of the eyes and the pride of life all three of those correspond to the temptation of the woman in the garden of eden and all three of them correspond to the temptation of christ in the wilderness and one was enticed to transgress boundaries but jesus christ remained firm and didn't transgress the boundary he had self-control he was perseverant he was persistent he was even offered some things that he might find in the end all kingdoms but he realized there's a way that i could come into possession of all these things and it'd be a glory and honor to god and i'm not willing to bypass the hard parts to get what i'll ultimately get i cannot bypass god's program of god's order i've got to do the right thing the right way there are no shortcuts so i'm going to honor god's way i'm going to honor the right way to do it whereas this bad pride sometimes go oh it's just a means to an end in the end if the right thing is done that's all that matters no that's not the case and so this left of the flesh the less of the eyes and the pride of life kind of at this at the root of boundary by boundary violations and even putting up barriers and keeping the word of god from dealing with the hearts or even allowing other people to help us if i could say this generally i must want to say always generally but again maybe it's always boundary violations are self-serving if we if we cross somebody else's boundary we'll do it because what because ultimately what it does for us not for what it does for the individual i'm not saying it's a conscious boundary violation but if this is what goes back to what i was thinking about in the beginning when i said sometimes we act and we're thinking it's altruistic we think that we're acting because we want to help somebody but if it's bad pride that's operating you're actually doing it to serve yourself not the person because if you recognize that you were transgressing a personal boundary if you recognized you were doing something insensitive or inappropriate no matter how much you'd want to help that person you'd say i can't help them that way that's that's not going to bring the healing they need that's not going to bring them the comfort they need that's not going to that you know that's that's not going to be what's appropriate in the moment there's some of us that have experienced situations where something very horrible has happened and the person who's there trying to comfort us makes some kind of outlandish statement that might be true but it does nothing to help and if they're called out it's like well i was just trying to help them i just thought if they recognized that or did this or did that it would help them but you have to realize when that happens you say or do something and you cross that boundary you act inappropriately with pride i'm going to be the one that helps this is going to make me look good i've got something to say i can be of help to you i i'm an expert in this area or i've been here before i've got something to say and you're just serving yourself and your own willingness to help and your own achievements pat yourself on the back you're doing it through some selfish ambition and generally if not always a boundary is crossed because the person crossing it is doing something to serve themselves and not somebody else proverbs chapter 25 verse 17 withdraw thy foot from thy neighbor's house lest he be weary of thee and so hate thee i'm not saying that that gives us permission to hate those who don't leave timely but what's what's the proverb actually speaking to human nature and the bible's needing to tell us in general like this wasn't just something that was going to be buried within the hearts of certain people and they were just shared at the appropriate moments like anybody who reads the bible needs to hear this all christians need to hear this withdrawal thy foot from thy neighbor's house why all right if you don't have enough sense to figure out why you can weary them and they'll end up hating you what because there's some boundary that's crossed the bible's actually having to speak to the fact that we can be insensitive that's where i wish i had the hammond just hammering down on a b-flat major third diminished or whatever to give me a little so i could get an eight-man or get a witness there's there's there's times we can be just really really insensitive and and we we act to this insensitivity maybe we act through insecurity it's it's really a a real toxic brew that all these things combined together by saying hey don't stay too long remove your foot from your neighbor's house yes you've been invited yes you obviously are welcome because it's not dealing with the thief hey you snuck in don't stay too long you've been invited but it's saying you've got to recognize at a certain point there's there's boundaries to even hospitality there's boundaries to giving there's boundaries to availability and access is saying don't go too far through into somebody's goodness or their graciousness or their willing help don't take advantage of people if they open up the door which is the appropriate boundary entry into someone's house you climb through the window get out of there shouldn't even be in there but if you come to the door by invitation there still has to be the awareness that even though i've been invited beyond the boundary i'm in someone's home i just don't go snooping around i've always wondered what a master bath looked like in this home plan we're wanting to build a house do you mind if i just go in here and see your master closet just kind of traipsing through right that would be inappropriate but the bible's talking about us being conscious and aware of someone else's boundaries and says withdrawal your foot from your neighbor's house why because you can cross a boundary and they'll get weary it's just a it's even a lack of social awareness he's talking to brother michael about it how maybe some of us that we need to create our own spectrum right we're just completely clueless yeah they say things that that's inappropriate i shouldn't have said that and it's just they've been diagnosed with pride is what it is and what's even more remarkable is that the core of bad pride is a fragile ego it's been a great time for everyone just to say man real loud like yep not me the core of it is a fragile ego and because there's a fragility there and there's an insecurity there they always have to act aggressively in order to prove themselves and it's not what paul was told he says prove your own work this is the paradox right you got to prove your own word but he's not talking about from a place of insecurity we always got to put yourself forward always got to prove yourself and i'm good and i can do this but there's this fragile ego which is going to motivate aggressive behavior why you have to maintain the illusion of control you have to maintain the illusion of competence i need them to at least think it's like the man behind the curtain remember the wizard of oz that was a complex acting out this is something you got something i want you to just take deep into your hearts and think about this to where if you're operating from a place of insecurity that doesn't mean you're always going to be this humble meek broken uh contrite person but some people have the most fragile egos are the ones that are most loud and boisterous compensating for something it's you're trying to maintain this illusion i'm strong i'm powerful i'm in control i'm confident i know what i'm doing and it's in that way that people act inappropriately and is the bible saying you wear your friends out you wear the people that love you the very people that invite you into their lives the very people that are welcoming to you you don't know how to remove your foot you don't know how to stop and not go so far and that's what causes the complications in relationships because you don't have this consciousness of what a personal boundary is but on the other hand studies have found that good pride is associated with the increase in social support that so when someone has a good pride these positive thought problems they have an increase in social support they have lower anxiety and they have a greater desire to help others by sharing their experiences and their expertise think about that that if there's a good pride this healthy sense of pride not this fragility not this weakness not this insecurity that there's actually more social support even in your willingness to give it and you and you also receive it there's less anxiety and you're characterized by someone who's willing to help i'm willing to help i'm willing to be able to help you for your own benefit let me share something with you for your own benefit so brings me back to this in galatians bury you one another's burdens but first every man shall bear his own burden i know i'm putting it in those that terminology but i think this bears out as you look at the word of god it's not it's not saying you that well get everybody else fixed and then fix yourself and you that are broken and needy and helpless you just start helping everybody else first and then once you get everybody else helped you you get the help no this is just like maybe sister nicole could give this if i mess it up what do they teach you when when there's the masks come down and and all the oxygen masks are dropping it doesn't tell all the men to get up and put mask on the women and children first and then put on a mask they say no immediately you put on your mask you the adult put it on immediately and then you help those who can't who can't put the mask on themselves why because if you go deprived of oxygen for too long you'll start thinking really really crazy and silly so what happens oxygen deprivation starts happening and you won't even think you won't even think clearly like jack why don't you have your mask on you silly boy you should really have your mask on no put your ears on first so you could think clearly and so there is this process where we oh no men and women first no take care of the babies first sometimes there's an order that you have to take in god's word so that you could ever be qualified to help you think we could just go out today and find all these broken people in the world today and somehow turn their lives around by just telling people who are broken in sin and laying with their own sins and burdened by their own weaknesses and have never felt the love of god that oh all you need to do is just start loving other people man all you need to do is start living for other people all you need to do is serve serve serve and they'll fall flat on their face and never find that place of real security in jesus christ because they're taught some false narrative of what it takes to be a christian there's a mouthful in that describes a lot of just the remodel projects that the denominational christianity wants to do but you can never bear another's burden until you bear your own take care of yourself then you could properly care for others because first it's going to sound a little bit odd first we have responsibility for ourselves i say whoa this this seems a little bit contrary to everything i've been taught you'll find that maybe i it doesn't mean what you think i mean when i say it because what responsibility does a sinner have first to do repent you find that there's a process in god's word and it's maybe reverse of the worldly thinking but there's a process where you are responsible for yourself and yourself first when the bible says bear you one another's burdens then it amplifies this what it means and you'll find that you have to be burying your own first before you can ever take somebody else's in first corinthians chapter 6 verses 18 to 20. i've got one two three four five-ish six or five six different scriptures i want to read and a quote is it all right if i continue all right i was just wanting to see if i could gauge beforehand anybody that would be yeah and i just focus on that one person we're going to take a poll of the front row is it okay if we continue okay good there we go 100 100 unanimous first corinthians chapter 6 verses 18 to 20 flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth again i said there's familiar scriptures but just want to take a little bit different angle to it but he that committed fortification sinteth against his own body what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and ye are not your own i think we're gonna have to think deeply on this your body is the temple of the holy ghost which you've received from god and you are no longer your own for you are bought with a prize therefore glorify god in your body and your spirit which are gods so there is actual glorification that we can do in our body not glorifying our body or glorifying our spirit but our bodies can glory and our spirits can glory because our body is not our own it is the holy ghost but let me say this when i bring that into view and god just struck me very particularly this week and pondering this your body is the temple of the holy ghost that immediately should invoke some self-worth and and when it says but your body is the lord's and you are not your own it's not to kind of turn this around like oh i guess i'm just somebody else's slave no there's a way that things get perverted and misrepresented which actually robs the believer from the real power that there's kind of the name claim it pat yourself on the back you're a great person in the maybe the joel olsteen way in the world today that's going to take you down the wrong path without re without repentance without a birth without a dying without obedience to the word of god and that's so far away from what i'm trying to express you today but then there's another side of it that's always going to try to beat you down and beat you down and beat you down and make you feel like you're broken there's so much in the word of god that we can identify where at the end of the day it's almost as if we're just thrown into a corner as a broken mess and we just always need to be reminded of it and if we're not careful we just think that's the way christ sees us when i found you you're nothing but a broken mess you were good for nothing no good nothing this that and the other and you know what you still are so you better stay in your place and that's how christ views us just always looking at us in the corners a broken mess complex rejected uh bad this bad that and that's the way things always remain and there's scriptures we can start to use to kind of support that idea and you're missing something because the idea that the truth of self-denial the truth of sacrifice the truth of humility cannot be misunder understood to the point of our detriment our spiritual detriment where we make ourselves doormats we make ourselves out to be nothing we constantly have a negative testimony we constantly say negative things we're never quite overcoming we make ourselves doormats or even worse we allow others to treat us the same way and we do it all in the name of christian virtue we think that it's christ-like to do it we think that it's virtuous to do it but when the bible tells us to turn the other cheek please i hope you can stay very faithful to what i'm trying to say when the bible tells us to turn the other cheek it's not an invitation to endure abuse it's not a it's not an invitation to constantly and consistently and forever endure boundary breaking when it says turn the other cheek and say christians just have to be manipulated and abused and taken advantage of and they just have to put up with it i've had to endure things i'm just going to be very honest with you right now it comes to my heart i've had to endure hurts and when i've tried to bring them up the response i got was you're a christian forgive what you're told you may be hurt and you may be broken you really you want to get somewhere it's like you just need to get over it buddy where's your thick skin and the devil would want to say if you're going to be a real christian just keep putting up with it just get under their thumb let them treat you however they want to treat you that's your pastor that you're you're a christian you just get under it buddy and i'm telling you right now as your brother and your friend you don't have to in mark chapter 8 verses 34 to 35 and when he called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it never lose sight of the fact that losing your life has to be for his sake and the gospel's sake and not for the sake of somebody else claiming the gospel or claiming christ the losing of our life for his sake is the salvation of it it's not in the losing of our life for any sake right it's not just well get lost get views get mistreated get mishandled and and i'll redeem it all in the end no it's not an invitation to be marginalized it's not an invitation to be abused it's not an invitation to subject yourself to hurts that christ has not asked you to be subjected to but notice how beautiful this is let him deny himself and take up his cross to deny yourself is to not lose yourself in the sense of just i'm going to let myself go to be mistreated or be abused to deny yourself is to by choice become a servant of christ self-denial is to not deprive you of the healing you need self-denial should not deprive you of the love that you need self-denial is not to subject yourself to hurts and to pains and offenses and difficult things all in the name of christian virtue i guess this is just what the cross is for i guess it's just what a christian does no it's not and i hope you realize i'm speaking in a very direct sense a very narrow sense uh because there ought not to be any hardiness or any misunderstanding that we will endure things we do go things through things we suffer doing good and we have to take it patiently and all things work together for the good and god will allow us to endure bitter trials for his glory for our benefit and there's things that we go through that in his love he's ordained them for our perfection but to deny yourself is not to think of yourself as nothing but as to by choice become a servant of christ you've been given freedom to choose freedom in christ because it says take up a cross let him deny himself and take up his cross this is the balance to deny yourself because on what happens is just deny yourself it almost be like this abandonment of self just deny yourself there could just be this casting down himself there could be this unreasonable estimation of what christ is wanting to do like you're just going to be trampled on but then it says take up your cross immediately focuses on personal responsibility take up your cross it's the balance then deny yourself but take up your cross he's bringing something beautifully balanced into view because and i i want to finish this and i'm just looking now and this thought upon my heart take up your cross deny yourself but take up your cross our identity who we are our value our worth our identity and the identity of christ are united in the cross it's where it becomes one so it's not it's not just in this image of deny yourself and take up this cross of self-sacrifice dragging this way to calvary in order to be crucified he did that part so when there's a take up a cross yes there's a burden yes there's a reproach yes there's a hardship that comes with it but denying yourself and taking up the cross is then to take yourself into union with christ because it's our identity and the identity of christ become one in the cross so we become identified i was there take up your cross his cross was my cross i'm going to find myself there in his sacrifice for me and i'm not going to take this perverted view that i'm just cast down i'm forsaken i'm demoralized i'm abused i'm good for nothing and i'm proving it day by day but i'm gonna be at that place at the foot of the cross from there i'm gonna rise into this glorious position as a son and daughter of god let him deny himself and take up his cross in mark chapter 10 verses 21 to 22. the rich young ruler was challenged he kept every every commandment from his uh his youth and jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me this is just later after christ has already espoused this before he called the people unto him and his disciples and he's teaching if a man's going to follow him he has to take deny himself and take up his cross so then he's he's amplifying now he's putting this into practice and he comes to the rich young ruler who seems to have everything both morally and physically he's a moral man he's a wealthy man and yet he's saying you lack something because in all your morality and all your natural possessions something's missing that you're not a true servant of god he says so go ahead and sell all you have give it to the poor take up the cross and follow me he was living unto himself alone through all his morality in all of his possessions all his money he was without any other purpose than personal gain even his morality was a badge of pride very quickly you know i keep his commandments now that you're asking i'm so glad you asked he was just living unto himself and when we talk about denying yourself taking up the cross humbling yourselves looking upon the needs of others the goal is not poverty the goal is service and it's exactly what christ told them to do he said sell whatever you have he said give to the poor don't you know you recognize there's something very deliberate in that he wasn't like hey sell it to some guy and sell at the highest price and and make some money off of this he said go ahead and take everything that you've gained that is value to you and sell it and make turn everything you've accumulated into something good and give it to the poor and then take up your cross and start following me and that'll begin to resolve what's wrong with you because you're too insular you're too much about yourself you're too much about what you've gained and you think you are who you are by what you observe and what your possessions are and trust me your value is a lot more than what you possess and what you do and he is taking it he is identifying how in some way he had to get things in balance before he could ever be of service and what i'm wanting to express to you and maybe just a real chopped up way i i see now that what i'm looking at maybe doesn't always come out in my heart the right way come out of my mouth the way it is in my heart but we can only only when we've taken care of ourselves or taking care of our own responsibilities can we truly take care of others bear you on another's birthday wait before you do paul just starts nailing it there you want to bury you your own words every man must bear his own burden you've got to have your sack packed you got to have your backpack on you have you have to have your gear you have to be prepared you have to be ready and then when you're in that position then you can go on a rescue mission now what lifeguards know if someone's drowning they they know enough because they're prepared they're going to take care of themselves they're never going to put themselves in a position where they're going to drown also and so they're going to maintain distance and know how to get the right thing out there for someone to swim someone to be rescued and people who don't know will jump in instinctively into something and they end up drowning themselves now you're thinking very literally we all think of situations that we might know even personally where people have been drowning and loved ones jump in to try to save them and what happens instead of having one person drown you have two sometimes you have three sometimes you're multiple people because they don't they're not prepared themselves they don't know how to rescue they don't know how to save and they just jump into something now take that in a spiritual way and you want to really quick jump into somebody's emotional mess guess who comes out an even bigger emotional mess come on somebody right we do why because you didn't take care of yourself first in philippians chapter 2 verses 3 to 8 let nothing be done through strife for vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others these are very striking scriptures no pride vainglory strife vainglory politicking party making bringing followers to yourself but if you're going to do anything let it be done through loneliness of mind clear admonishment esteem each other person better than yourselves that's a healthy a viewpoint like man i am the greatest i am the greatest but you are greater right just as long as you think everybody else will be better right someone's the better the best the best the best and somebody's better that you can have that kind of attitude i'm good i'm good i'm good but you're gooder he says let us esteem each other better than yourselves look not every man and his own things but every man also on the things of others so this is clear admonishment hey you've got to be concerned about other people you've got to be looking out after other people but then he says this let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus now this takes an odd turn right no strife or vainglory no arrogance no personal ability but loneliness of mind you're going to steam others better than yourselves so you're going to esteem somebody else better than self look not on your own things but the things of others this real call to service a real call to lifting other people up but he says but let this mind be in you which was in christ who being in the form of god you following thought it not robbery to be equal with god you feel me i mean this is he in order to do verses three and four you've got to have a particular mindset that begins with this understanding i am made in the likeness of god i am made in the image of god i am a son or daughter of god and i am equal i am called to be co-equal joint heirs with christ and he says but made of himself of no reputation so we do not begin with no reputation but we begin with being in the image of god who by a new birth or brought into relationship with jesus christ who have some equality with jesus christ our joint heirs but do not need to make of ourselves of any reputation but took up upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross that is exactly what we can do as being sons and daughters of god we can see our position in christ but now through this great power and potential and privilege we have of being his sons and daughters we can take upon ourselves this the form of a servant and need not make ourselves a reputation but just do the good because it's required of us not because we need to be noticed and if we could just catch this because i'm running out of time i'm not going to pull the front row again but i'm running out of time but the humiliative humility of christ the humility of christ was first born from the confidence of christ that's what it came from it was it was deity expressing humility brother brahm says and it is i be not afraid that's what makes him god to me because he humbled himself god is in humility don't never forget that humility is god never boastful it is always humility but what makes that so great because god is great but he can humble himself that's real power a man who can humble himself show me show me a church that's humble and sweet and not arrogant that's the church that's got the favor of god in it show me a man who can humble himself control himself and not run all over the building he says that's a man who's got more power than the man that runs all over the building why because it's the greatness it's the power that's being channeled correctly and these scriptures as i look at them and i'm just going to have to summarize some of this this language here at the end lowness of mind to steed other better than yourselves look upon the needs of others not just your own things he starts with this being in the form of god thinking of this equality with god and then from this position of power you're going to become a servant from this position of position of ability and confidence and knowing who you are you're going to become a servant we hear the say and it's a true saying eternal life is living for others so immediately self-denial a self-sacrifice giving sell all you have take up the cross all these images of christianity did it ring true that there's times when we're we feel that it's expected of us to be completely pushed over because that's the christian virtue and there's a way that we defer there's a way that we take a step back there's a way that we say we're sorry there's a way that we defuse a situation there's a way that we can humble ourselves and get beneath somebody but that doesn't mean that we're just sticking our neck out to let them step on it right and so it's not that we just make ourselves available to be abused and make ourselves available to torn down and while i guess i'm a christian so i can be battered and abused and mistreated and all these other things that's not that's not the image that we're conveying and so we say eternal life is living for others let's just join that to all that other language and imagery i'm trying to bring up we think eternal life is living for others if we're not careful then we actually turn it into eternal life in our minds is actually not living for others we're dying for others you're not living you're killing yourself you're dying and in order to truly live for others we have to must we must first appreciate the eternal life we possess and it's only in recognizing our boundaries and then addressing barriers that we can help others burdens i i'm gonna leave i think i might just have to leave some stuff off here when we give you're not giving from deficit but we give because we've got something to give and you should value what it is you're giving the bible not teach us to not cast our pearls before swine so that means if you have a big bag of pearls the goal isn't just to get rid of them and if you've got virtue and you have something to give it's not just give it to whoever demands it if you've got a life to live for christ it doesn't mean you have a life to live or to give to death at the demands and whims of other people paul said in second corinthians 12 15 and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you what remark what remarkable statement i will gladly spend and be spent there's a humility there isn't there there's a sacrifice there there's something this is something we're here i want to i will gladly very gladly spend and be spent for you and it's interesting what he reads he says and because i'm crafty i exposed your guile very humble paul but he's he's saying i will very gladly spend and be spent for you but do you realize that there's an acknowledgment of a resource and a preciousness of it and that i've got something worth spending and i'm a resource that i that is valuable enough to be given i will very gladly spend and even myself be spent but it will never work unless you have boundaries and know what barriers are because you'll never know when to give past a barrier and you'll never know when to stop beyond a boundary but the mica if you could come musicians i'll just stop there let me say this not every wall is a boundary sometimes a wall is a barrier musicians you can come lord help us tonight ponder these things if i could say this boundaries and barriers start with yourself first not arrogantly but soberly see yourself then you can see others luke chapter 6 but john if you want to bring that up verses 41 and 42 and why behold is thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but perceiveth not the beam that is in thy own eye remember bear you one another's burdens but first bear your own either how can't thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the molt that is in thy eye when thy thyself thou thyself behold it's not the beam that is in thine own eye jesus is being really uh pointed in his words your brother just has a splinter just just has a little splinter as i and you're over here with the beam the moat i mean yours is obvious there you're just you're really straining i wouldn't have seen it if you hadn't said something here let me get it out and meanwhile they're like whoa what about yours [Music] i want to help you with your marriage hey what about yours like some of the books we read were like man this guy's really figured out how to raise kids doesn't have a relationship with his kids at all like wow this guy's got to be the best expert on marriages yeah because he's had five of them [Music] right and there is this idea of getting your house in order first before you try to get somebody else's house in order my it just seems to be that way sometimes that the house cleaner is the one with the dirtiest house that the lawyer is the one without the will right and the estate planning documents that he does every day for his clients there's just can be this tendency to always give give give give and take care of everybody else's needs but yours aren't even taken care of and i know we look at this scripture and it's red and i believe it's appropriate to be some sort of a rebuke to those who are always out eager to take something and deal with somebody else's pain and take care of somebody else and resolve somebody else's problems and not ever take care of their own but just think of how innocently sometimes we want to go forth to get the sliver out of somebody else's eye but you know what how about we start with our own eyes thou hypocrites so he does kind of it does have an edge on it cast out first the beam out of the own eye and then just think of how applicable this is on so many levels and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mold that is in thy brother's eye i know we're castigated as being uh [Music] hypocrites but you realize just how pointed this is when it speaks to service oh here let me help you with your burden let me help with you with your burden well don't you need to bear yours first don't you need to get balanced don't you think don't you think you should take care of your sinking ship oh let me put your mask on let me put your mask on mom don't you think you should put yours on first be so worried about our kids getting the holy ghost so worried about our kids doing this so worried about this person needs to do that this person needs to they all need to get in shape what about you get in shape it wouldn't be very good for me to be up here let's just say that we all came here and we're here just to get in fit physics get in shape physically and eat well and you guys all show up with your yoga mats and you're going to be working out and jogging and you're going to be getting yourself in shape and i'm just over here with a bucket of chicken just saying yep come on now come on exercise eat right drink your water it's like man practice what you preach by there and so when jesus is expressing this we have to start with our own eye because how are you even able to see clearly until you remove the barrier from your eye until the barrier it causes you not to see the barrier that limits your abilities until that barrier is removed until you can actually see yourself soberly as you ought to be seen then how can you ever see somebody else because there's an upside and a downside that when you see yourself for what you are then you also you can be do it in a spirit of meekness considering your own self really reach out to somebody not because you think you're better oh look at you again in a big mess you're like man brother i feel you i know what you're going through they go with me but for the grace of god you can empathize you're willing to hell and not not because you're above something lord and utter but you just might find the right way to get beneath them so that when you're helping them you're pushing them up and that always makes somebody feel a lot better when someone's kind of down in the mud with them pushing them up then somebody looking down at you in the hole and say you're in a hole again huh this seems to be happening all the time but when we see ourselves properly we just it just has this way of leveling us listen if you could just do this you don't ever have to think of yourself better just think of yourself as something else if somebody if somebody has something that you don't have it's not something better it's just something else [Music] and then it just kind of takes away the mattress always trying to compare always try to compare i'll end on this i promise i promise i promise i promise i'll end up coming to a boundary when it tells us then to remove the beam out of our own eye it's telling us there has to be some lack of hypocrisy humility say i've got a problem i need to address it right but then realize how there's also some self-care involved taking care of yourself and you're not always the one that's broken trying to fix other people and so when we live for others and there's so many scriptures i'd love to use for you for you right now and if there's if there's enough inspiration and weight still there in the future i can just bring this in in this context but for to live for others as a husband your first others your wife to live for others as a parent your next other are your children because you'll never have a proper ministry or help beyond your home until you've served that first some of you say well brother aaron why was it you was 45 years old before you ever became a pastor hey it took me that long to finally get everything else in line and to learn through the different processes of what it takes to serve and to humble yourself and go through different circumstances to to know what it feels like to be sheep there's a lot of things a lot of training a lot of processes where you step into that position not as a novice not as somebody that came to him very easy not as someone who just got the opportunity a young age but i can step in and say lord i know even if i'm not very good at it i know my responsibility first to my wife and then my children and i know that no matter regardless of what kind of success i can have as a pastor it'll always be undermined if i'm not successful as a husband and as a father because that's where my first service is to living for others begins in my family begins at home charity begins where at home and so if you're being pulled to serve you're being called to serve other people you're being called to give and to give and to give if you're in your mind you have you want to just take opportunities to help everybody else but you're not willing to first serve at home you're probably crossing somebody else's barrier and not removing the beam from your own eye oh just stand with me or i'll just keep going there's a lot there isn't there there's a lot there god bless you tonight as the lord of the lord spoke to your hearts has it been personal would you could you admit tonight that i could get a lot more detail than i have and then for you hopefully what's happening is the holy spirit's doing its own discerning in your life and it doesn't mean i have to stand up here and bring attention to myself and say you who lives at one two one two west way and call your name out but make it even more personal that god could deliver a word that begins to uncover the things in our hearts and that's his grace and do you love him tonight isn't it good to us
