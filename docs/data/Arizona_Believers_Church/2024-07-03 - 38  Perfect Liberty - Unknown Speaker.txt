TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title this evening is perfect Liberty as you could see here and I'm taking it from this particular scripture in verse 25 where it says who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty I had titled it the perfect law of Liberty but it just kind of very at the last minute I just felt perfect Liberty is how I really want to present this to you at the outset uh Lord willing Sunday morning we'll talk about perverted Liberty so you kind of get an idea of where we're going and then maybe practiced Liberty and uh I want to begin to explore the scriptural concepts of Liberty and freedom and I would say that freedom in Christ Liberty in Christ these things of of uh that relate to those very terms as far as the Liberty that we have in Christ I think that sometimes they're very difficult to understand I know that um for years I've sought fellowship and asked questions and tried to just understand better how my free moral agency works with God's election and and just you know how much free moral agency do I have how much Liberty and freedom do I have to choose in light of the fact that God chose me and that God made that making that decision has elected me and then predestinated me and so it it is difficult and then I think sometimes it's not only difficult to understand but then it's easily misunderstood because Liberty's presented in a way that it actually isn't Liberty or we conflate certain meanings or certain conditions in life and we say this is what it means to be free and this is what Freedom means and so it's very easy to to mix those things up and I found when I was coming to this place in the series I was like Wow imagine that tomorrow is Independence Day I didn't even plan this and so I just I just say if it's anything it's Vindication it's Vindication or probably more like coincidence but we're just searching for a word to describe it but I hadn't premeditated this it's just worked out this way and so I have intention uh um decided to explore some things related to tomorrow so this way you get homeschool credit for this and and you can put this on your transcript but this the series on the house of the Lord from the very beginning this Series has been about the process of determining value things that really matter and if doing so if we could find True Value then it can lead to simplicity so what I've been studying personally is on the Simplicity that is in Christ and everything that that means and how that this comes back to that one thing needful or the one thing have I desired that will I seek after his presence that I would dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to inquire in his Temple that I I want to behold his face and that life being reduced desires being reduced to one that would be the greatest Simplicity wouldn't that be amazing if when you woke up you just had one desire all my desires have been reduced to one and it had nothing to do with the cup of coffee had nothing to do with the fivemile run it had nothing to do with any kind of bucket list your desire was to please him your desire was his presence your desire was Christ and so I feel the need to do this and it may be just for me but I want to kind of give you the breadcrumbs on how the Lord has led me to this particular part on the subject of Liberty and I have kind of seeded a few things in there maybe over the last year or so on the subject of Liberty and how it can be misused and how there's this uh maybe the LIE of Liberty but I want to start with 1 Corinthians 3:16 and this will this is the breadcrumbs portion where I'm kind of backing up just showing you how I arrived at this particular place he says know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you so we realize that in a type in in image of scripture we are the temple of God or we could say the his building or the house of the Lord if his Spirit dwells in us so the spirit of God dwelling in US we are his habitation we are his building we could say then in some ways that we are the house of the Lord and then he comes back to the same thing in chapter 6 verse 19 he says what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own so again in this idea that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost the spirit of God dwells in you do you not know that that if the spirit of God dwells in you you are the temple of the Lord and then he says and ye are not your own so there is based upon the way that Paul is saying this and the way that he's dealing with this in the Corinthian Church especially this first Corinthians letter there is this sense of Duty there is this sense of responsibility that we have as been the dwelling place of God that it's to and brother bam often visits it this way you say well you say you have the Holy Ghost and do this and do that and is your life worthy of the gospel maybe a way that we could position the question and it's merely it's basically saying this that if you are the habitation of God there's a duty and responsibility uh in a manner of life and living and uh maybe trajectory in your testimony to to where it's evidence that God is in you and so there is a duty and responsibility if his Spirit dwells in us I am a a Dwelling Place of God and therefore let there be a manifestation of God's presence in my life let there be a continual yielding so that the presence can have preeminence now fast forward into second chapter 2 Corinthians chapter 3 now he's writing to the same group he's commending them for their dealing with sin maybe taking serious the fact that they are their body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and and a temple of God if the spirit of God dwells in you and he makes this statement very familiar with all of us and he says now the Lord is that Spirit talk about when it shall turn to the Lord the veil is going to be taken away he says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty this word uh Liberty it speaks of Freedom even in the I would say in the Greek and the the word that this is derived from it's the absence of restraint or not being bound by some sort of obligation and we're thinking yeah that's kind of kind of what I want I want that kind of Liberty and he say where the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty there's a freedom and we would maybe begin to build that even around own concepts of Freedom that we have the power of self-determination that we have we are in the state of free will uh that this Freedom as it would speak of even scripturally this Deliverance of bondage that I was bound and I couldn't make decisions and I couldn't do things but now being made free I have the power of self-determination I I am this in the state of uh Free Will so I have free choice today if we speak of Freedom or even Liberty it's freedom to do as one chooses to have again free will now I believe the scripture says where the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty that even in the use of that word in the meaning we could use it in the same sense that of Freedom or the absence of restraint and this free choice but to maybe use a little bit of a play on words how do we exercise this Liberty without Taking Liberties in other words how do we exercise what does this Liberty look like without going beyond the the proper bounds you know when someone you say make yourself at home and you're like thanks I'd like to go to the master suite and take a bath uh since we don't have a bathtub in our house you tell me to make myself at home I was like what kind of soaking tub do you have where is it and so we might say oh my house your house well then if you're at home you're free you you can do things in your home with the blinds closed and you could be a family and you could be yourself in ways that maybe you can't out in public so someone says you know you make yourself at home and we would could say well I'm going to take my Liberty and then as soon as you step across the proper bounds You Are Taking Liberties in other words you are exercising your Liberty so much to where you're taking away somebody else's that you you are so free that you're putting me in bondage a and and so there is there's something to think about in terms of well if I'm free completely free and again I've been digesting a lot of these scriptures and where that the son of man whom he hath set free is free indeed that there's this concept of Liberty and freedom and being set free that we want to uh enjoy and we say where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty so we have this sense of where God's spirit is there is Liberty God's spirit dwells in me then therefore I'm free I have been liberated and I want to experience and enjoy my freedom so I want to I want to look at that how can we exercise this Liberty what does this liberty mean without uh Taking Liberties and let's start by wrestling with the concept of Liberty even in society and with the Declaration of Independence which was adopted on July 4th 1776 by the Continental Congress and this is The Faded copy I think that is uh um even in Washington DC and I'm going to read to you this declaration of independence now what I'm doing with this is I'm giving getting you your homeschool credits and exploring this idea and concept of freedom in light of the fact that this is Independence Eve this is how it begins the unanimous Declaration of the 13 United States of America in my original slide I had the direct Declaration of Independence on this slide and I realized I spelled Independence wrong and I said fool me once like I know nobody's going to say anything they're like but what is inter pretend we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness these are uh weighty words I believe that men of those days and the writers in those times their word was their currency and they spent them Thrifty they were very Thrifty very careful with their words and so these are uh weighty words and they they're very well crafted all men are created equal and endowed by God we could say with certain unalienable rights like these are guarantees they these are these ought to be expected and the among these these are not just the only ones but he says among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now I believe that it speaks to these unalienable rights that to secure these rights they say continuing governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed so if we as human beings have a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that in order that every man would be able to exercise these rights that governments are then formed and instituted and the governed give consent to that that power to say look out after so that we can pursue life liberty and happiness and then it says that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends now they give the context for some of us who aren't maybe thinking more deeply about this our Declaration of Independence was basically tell it was telling Great Britain we are no longer subject to you to your rule of law to your government and they're giving the cause and the reason for them saying that we will no longer uh you are not sovereign over us you're no longer governing us but we're declaring our independence from British rule so it says whenever a form of government government becomes destructive of these ends and whenever government and power begins to deprive us of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness he said it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to Institute new government laying its foundations on such principles and organizing its power in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness these are big words but I think we all get what they're trying to say that whenever these a unalienable rights begin to erode and we no longer have these Liberties then the people can abolish the government that's taking away these rights or that is not promoting them and that the people have a right to choose a government that will affect their safety and happiness and then it list uh this is this is the statement it makes before it list all their complaints against the king the history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over the states to prove this let's fact let facts be submitted to a candid world and then boom they list them all and then one of them towards the very end a prince whose character is thus marked by Every Act which may Define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people so in the Declaration of Independence it sets forth the idea of Liberty that man has this right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that if he's deprived of his right to pursue happiness his right of Liberty then that he has somehow been enslaved or been subjugated to something that is not his right or that is contrary to his rights as a person and this King has become a tyrant because he is governing in a way that infringes upon their Liberty and this Prince whose character is marked by Every Act that defines a tyrant he is not fit to rule over free people so it does suggest in in the outset that having these rights it's necessary to have government that would secure those rights that in the absence of order and structure and government that it's that's when people with their Liberty take Liberty and that if there's not the proper government over people then uh we really don't have Liberty it's chaos and so those that are in charge of government should be chosen by the people with the consent of the people looking out after their needs and their their rights and securing them but whenever one governs in a way that takes away these rights or becomes destructive of these rights then they're saying we ought to abolish this government and start a new one because that's not a fit government over free people right so in the preamble to the US Constitution which was drafted in 1787 it kind of it in the Preamble it hearkens back back to these things of the prior decade we the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America we're going to set forth and writing a constitution a governing document that will secure the rights of the people that will be set up in such a way to where the unalienable rights of the individual of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness are not destroyed by government itself that we will uh affect our safety and happiness that we will establish a more perfect union which is righteous ensures domestic tranquility provides for defense and promotes general welfare and secures blessings of liberty it really is is describing that place where you don't you're not fearful you're at liberty and so the Constitution was established to promote Liberty this constitution piggybacks with this declaration of independence this is what we're trying to achieve we've seen tyrrany in the King of Great Britain we've seen how it takes away the rights of the people so now we want to establish he says a more perfect union that'll govern the United States of America and its people and avoid tyrannical rule yes as soon as this at the very time that it's being adopted Benjamin Franklin warns that the constitution can only end in despotism as other forms have at a time when he says that the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government now this is at the very time that it's being signed he's saying this government this this constitution is about as good as we can get but he says it's ultimately going to lead to tyranny itself despotism is going to happen it's that tyrannical rule of one with absolute power that though we have done our best to uh come up with what we think can be these Bill of Rights and things that we can have as as a society that'll look after life liberty in the pursuit of happiness he says it really can only end in tyranny when the people shall have become so corrupted as to need a desperate as a governor I'll give more context for this in a moment but Thomas mcau in 1857 he wrote a letter to Henry Randall and these being preserved and and I think it came up in the the writings of Jefferson when he were writing a book on the history of Jefferson he wrote this he was a historian a a and um a well-known figure in Great Britain so he's now writing this many years after the institution of the Constitution the the Declaration of Independence and this is his opinion of American democracy as a Brit I have long been convinced that institutions purely Democratic must sooner or later destroy Liberty or civilization or both okay you listen or you're not going to get your homeschool credit but this is the attitude now we're we're wan to understand Liberty what does it mean how far does it go how can I exercise it he's saying he's convinced that an institution that is purely Democratic and I believe this is why uh Benjamin Franklin answered you what kind of government do you have a monarchy or a republic he says a republic as long as we can keep it but yet a Democratic Society being different he says an institution is purely Democratic sooner or later either destroys Liberty destroys civilization or destroys both says either the poor would plunder the rich and civilization would perish now upon what basis would the poor plunder the rich Liberty life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the pursuit of possessions as Lo wrote it that there was a certain sense of entitlement that well my rights and Liberty and being free they the poor would plunder the rich and in plundering the rich civilization erodes and is destroyed or order in property would be saved by a strong military government and Liberty would perish kind of recognize these competing interest that if you're going to have Liberty that and this balancing of interest that the poor then take their Liberties and Destroy and take away from the rich and that destroys civilization well in order to preserve civilization you need a strong government and to keep the poor in their place and therefore it leads to a strong military government and Liberty would perish and mcau says to Randall there is nothing to stop you your Constitution is all sale and no anchor in establishing rights and the rights of the people and making Liberty uh preeminent and even uh kind of the the rally and cry and the appeal to emotions that some of the founding fathers appealed to that it is it is it is Liberty it is obedience to God to Rebel to tyranny a and the Give me liberty or give me death and and those those Concepts that we would say that Liberty became everything and that even one who would give up his liberties for the sake of Peace deserves neither Liberty or Peace So it places Liberty and freedom and these rights to choose and these inable right says this is the most important thing and we must preserve them and he says this is in his mind saying your Constitution is all sale and no anchor Alexis dville a French politician he wrote he said I would give and this is in his uh scathing writing on Democracy in America America and I realized maybe to these guys across the pond you know they didn't really want to think this is going to succeed so they had their hot political opinions about America and democracy so maybe we could take it with a grain of salt but mcau is saying that your democratic government your form of government will destroy Liberty or destroy civilization maybe both and now the French de teville says I would give the people under this instrument under this constitution 200 years from the date of its ratification until they sinned under a complete despotism complete tin tyrannical Reign tyranny I give you 200 years before you do the people are so corrupted as Benjamin Franklin said that they need a tyrannical government a government that can bind the People by taking away Liberties in order to keep them from taking other people's Liberties or going too far as to destroy civilization and this is just the the the political science view this is the historical View these are the uh the debates and certainly from an academic standpoint and scholarship uh these weren't necessarily the prevailing opinions of the time that everyone agreed with even now today we could debate on it but mcau said there is nothing to stop you your Constitution is all sell and no anchor brother brandham referred specifically to him though not naming him and he said and the man was right that's exactly what's going on brother B refers to a British politician and refers to it several times this idea of no uh no anchor all sails and no anchor he said that man was right that's exactly what's going on when I was studying in Daniel 12:4 about how uh people shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase and I was Finding where brother brandom is identifying that with respect to um the end times and what was taking place within society that knowledge is increasing and it's a negative thing it wasn't knowledge of the the of right or the knowledge of good and he makes this statement in the sermon this day this scripture is fulfilled and and it was in this hymn referring to Daniel 124 this is very near that he says in the world politics our world system is just as rotten as it can be he says I'm not a politician I'm a Christian I ain't got no business talking about politics but I just want to say they're rotten on both sides I voted once that was for Christ I got to win the devil voted against me and Christ voted for me depends on which way I cast my vote I'm glad I cast it on him that the world say what they want to I still believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever he will prove it he certainly will certainly and he says the increase in crime juvenile delinquency and as we were're speaking about the Labyrinth and how the Christianity becom a labyrinth was the erosion of society in the delinquencies of the church the delinquencies of the family therefore the delinquencies of the ch children says look at our nation once the flower of the earth our great democracy was born back there in the Declaration of Independence and the Declaration of Independence was signed and we had a democracy and our great forefathers and the things that they' done and we had a great nation but she's now rottening and crumbling and shaking and giving away this is where we are now amen this is where he's saying this in 1965 and man would be these uh these many years later 60 years later this is it's even worse it it's the it's the same seeds and Spirits manifesting more and more and more he says trying to tax people to get money to send Over Yonder to buy friendship with our enemies they're throwing it back in our face One World War Two world wars and still moving on to a third one we have this history of I in America to where where we have for a I mean before I get into maybe the pure politics of things but we say well America the Great America the Beautiful America America is interested in democracy and I believe that there is there's the good side to that but then there's the UND side where there's always something in it for America she's not purely altruistic says oh we just want to get rid of Saddam Hussein we want we don't want there to be weapons of mass destruction we care for these people and and there's just some kind of black substance over there that you know is worth a lot of stuff and you realize well what side are you taking in this well I'm just making observations you you know if there was a dictator there and there was no oil in the ground you know how long do you think a Cuba would last until you find that there's really good resources in there and it would maybe be worth getting in there and mixing things up and so I'm just saying that not all things are as they appear he said our nation's rotting and we're giv money away to buy friendships with our enemies and then it blows back in our face and America's watched this happen time and time again where they support something for certain reasons and they give power and weapons and money and then right around it's turn around and used against us he says politics is rotten corrupted rotten to the bottom in other words exactly what Franklin worried about what the British identified and even the French that eventually with our Constitution and our attempt to be a pure democracy perhaps not yielding completely to that of a republic I don't know but all I know is in the end this document has led us to a place to where civilization and Liberty are both being destroyed democracy which is could be a good way of describing our political system says our democracy formed of the Declaration of Independence formed by that Constitution is ruining both civilization and Liberty why because of the concept of Liberty it is freedoms it is Liberties to where with the whole idea of it's and brother brandham even says this about he's kind of speaking about the differences of one says well shout dance and speak in tongues and the other one said well I just want to stay real starchy and the other one says I would just want to shout he goes all sell no anchor and so the argument in the political debate and maybe brother Andrew Coffey will set me straight with with as long as I'm not an earshot about who said what and who does what but there's some argument as to the Republic an want to be the anchor and the de Democrats want to be the sell and that there's a push and pull and there's give and take and if you have all sell and no anchor you just you're going to go with the whims you go wherever Liberty and freedom takes you the will of the people the wants of the people the desires of the age people's rights and then how far does it go so there is just I I'd like to say just creating the stur these thought process in your mind that what is Liberty then the concept of Democratic Society and the founding of our nation and those doing it in terms of the creator has endowed us with rights that we have of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that in fully exercising our Liberty and our sovereignty as a nation and necessarily then as individuals it's led to the destruction of civilization and it's eroding Liberty or it's destroying civilization and Liberty then what what is liberty and what is it good for do we necessarily have to and resp response elect a desperate a dictator do we need a king who rules with absolute tyranny now in second Corinthians chapter 3 we read verse 17 I'm going to read Verse 18 as well because now I want to look at in from a scriptural standpoint if we could call this our founding document our Declaration of Independence our constitution brother Bram does say in one place that if you had Christians running everything it'd be a different story and perhaps it could be said had you had Christians always running things it would have been a different story and then he says if you could put a George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in every office and it won't change now she's too far gone uh all sell and no anchor she's gone too far she can't get back that's why he said she's lost so now the Lord is that Spirit where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and everybody said sh right we like that where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty he says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord I believe that Paul is identifying the true nature and meaning of this Liberty that where the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty now the sense of Liber might conjure up ideas of being free and being set loose and I'm free to do what I want and he defines this Liberty or he defines what is meant by where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and he says that with an unveiled face by looking into the mirror of the word we change so where the spirit of the Lord is that Spirit of the Lord is in me where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and therefore with the spirit of the Lord and an unveiled face I can look into the mirror the Lord the the word and I change and in changing I'm formed into Christ's image by that Spirit of the Lord so the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit is there's liberty and now he's saying that Spirit having brought Liberty by the spirit of Liberty or by Liberty I am changed into the image of Christ in other words now that we can behold the word now that you can process it now that you can see it we're free to be changed we've been set at Liberty to be formed into the image and to be Bears of partakers of the divine nature and therefore manifest and bear the image of Christ where the spirit of Lord is there is Liberty in other words Liberty to become it is freedom then from the worst of our humanities the worst of our thought processes the worst of our instincts the worst of our misunderstandings and these the Labyrinth of our mind and the the sins as we were looking at those the the failure in thought and action the frustration of thought in action and the frustration of Desire that we can find Liberty from the Labyrinth we can find Freedom from this Maze and this confusion in Christ so Paul says where the spirit of the Lord there is liberty and if I could put it this way and let me Define what I mean by where the spirit of the Lord is in the house of the Lord there is Liv Liberty in the house Lord and what I mean by that is that we all should be beholding the revealed word of God which is the glory of the Lord Christ the revealed word and by revealing the re looking into the revealed word that revelation of the word will change us into the same glorious image it'll bring us by eating the same thing Paul says eating the same bread we coales into the same image of Christ by that Liberty now James references the perfect law of Liberty with a similar emphasis I am going to spend the remainder of this service hopefully giving you you all enough time to start your freedom celebration early I was going to call Brother Reggie and ask him to bring fireworks tonight I just didn't get around to it that was how he earned one of his many nicknames pyop plet now so James is going to reference the perfect law of Liberty with a very similar emphasis as Paul Paul says where the spirit of Lord there's liberty and we all with open face beholding as the glass the glory of the Lord a mirror the glory of the Lord are changed into the glory of the Lord and now James in James chapter 1 I want to read this large portion verse s 19 to verse 27 now I just want you to kind of pick up on this I won't give a lot of uh U extra details to this he says wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to Wrath am this is our constitution this this is this is the word of God has given to us this is righteousness this is these are things that we take into consideration this is telling us what it means to be Christlike to be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God makes a lot of sense wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness these are things that we ought to be doing and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls these are marching orders for the Christian those of us who are the house of the Lord and in whom the spirit dwells you are the dwelling place of God and you now having the spirit of God in you there's this Duty and responsibility is being a bearer of his presence to be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath to lay apart filthiness and naughtiness receive with meekness the engrafted word what a statement which is able to save your souls verse 22 in amplifying this be but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves that there is some self-deception when we are satisfied with saying we have heard we are satisfied with saying I know what it says and I understand and and this is what he said and God thought it brother man and spoke it I believe it that settles it there is a sense of being hearers but not doers that that s that uh that very concept of hearing and not manifesting involves on some level self-deception for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass so if a man hears the word of God but in turn does not translated into action does not live it does not do it does not fulfill it does not perform it he is like a man who is looking looking should be looking into the word with open face beholding as in a mirror of the glory of the Lord but in this way he looks as a man into a mirror but only sees his natural face his natural face for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgiveth what manner of man he was there that there is no change in conduct there's no subsequent uh changing Paul said that we when we have the spirit Lord inside of us and the word is being revealed to us the the nature of this Liberty is that we would behold to the glory of the Lord and be changed in the image of the Lord by that Spirit of the Lord but now one looks into the mirror sees himself and since he hears but will not do he goes straight way and forgets what Manner he was he stays the same he does not change amen says but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgiven ful here but a doer of the work that phrase the doer of the work the work of what the perfect law of Liberty the work of what the very thing that's being revealed to you that work of the Lord this process of change from glory to glory being changed by the spirit of Lord into the image of Christ he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world now I want to continue into chapter two but look at where Paul is excuse me James is has led us to where the spirit of the Lord which is in you there there's liberty but if I am not ultimately obedient to the word of God I've deceived myself that claiming to be the bearer of his presence claiming to have the word of God inside of me claiming to have his spirit inside of me but yet I'm not being changed into the same image I'm not being a doer of the word then I have deceived myself but when the spirit of the Lord is in my heart and i gaze upon that word I see it it's revealed to me and I obey he says you're not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work and I'm blessed in my doing and this is built around this uh these instructions from James to this is what you ought to do this is what you ought to do be a doer of the word not just a hearer as James is going to say show me your faith by your works and look at it from a different perspective than that of Paul who said uh my faith is made manifest before God apart from my works and he says pure religion is to before God and that which is undefiled is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their Affliction and to keep ourselves unspotted from the world there's a certain Duty and responsibility in this perfect law of Liberty he's saying quite a bit about what we ought to do so he continues in chapter 2: 1-13 my brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with respect of persons for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring and goodly apparel and there come ALS and also a poor man in Vile reignment and you have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit here under my foot stol notice this talking about attitudes I think we preached on without prejudice on this very these very scriptures are ye not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts you're not rightly dividing the word of Truth and you're not acting in a manner that's consistent with how you ought to be in your faith towards the Lord Jesus Christ that you have a carnal means of elevating certain people and putting other people down to give certain people Liberties and privileges but others you take them away and deprive them hearken my beloved Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and The Heirs of the Kingdom which have promised to them that love him but ye have despised the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before judge the Judgment seats do not they blaspheme that worthy Name by which you are called if ye fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well it's a common refrain it's a a a repetitive theme in Christ and Paul James that to love thy neighbor as thyself it's a it sums it up amen but if you have respect to persons you commit sin and are convinced of the Law's transgressors for who so shall keep the whole law and yet offended one point he is guilty of all for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill Thou Art become a transgressor of the law there's a lot to unpack there but he says so speak ye and so do there's a manner of speaking and there is a manner of doing that we ought to speak right we ought to do right and as they that shall be judged by the law of Liberty speak ye and do as those that will be judged by the law of Liberty for you shall have judgment without Mercy for he shall have judgment without Mercy that has showed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment you could see then as James addresses this and he tells us that when we look into the perfect law of Liberty and continue therein we are a doer of the work and we are blessed in our deeds and we have not forgotten what we heard this looking into the perfect law of Liberty and this change that is brought about into a person is like what Paul said would happen where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty that perfect Liberty is Christ right go it is the gospel it is the word it is the glory of the Lord it is the word which is perfect and perfecting causing us therefore to walk in Liberty and what James says is that whoo lookth into the perfect law of Liberty I'm I going to say this and I'm closing we must be looking into the perfect law of Liberty studying this word looking this week it mean it comes from this the Greek word to stoop down and take a close look into it's used literally in the sense of Peter stooping down going into the Seiler going into the tomb to get a closer look to apprehend for himself what it really is looking into the perfect law of Liberty is not just a glance it's not just a a a scene of something it's the fixing of whole mind on the mirror of the word that has been revealed to us the the the setting of our attention to the giving of preeminence to it letting that become our Guiding Light I was reading in Patrick Henry's uh speech on Give me liberty or give me death and he said I have no lamp to my feet but experience and I thought man this is such a rousing speech that wasn't necessarily recorded at the time but was published sometime later and I thought well I think I would moderate that a little little bit we ought to not have any other lampen to our feet than the word of God that has been revealed to us and not just experience as our guidepost and our and our Plum line so he says that we ought to look into to diligently inquire of into the perfect law of Liberty there is a perfect Liberty this is I want to get across today and using the example of the imperfect Liberty perhaps with respect to American society and democracy and the and what we have in America still the best there is but yet with imperfect men and they wrestled with this no these Notions even in the founding documents that uh we're imperfect and this is the best we can do and this is the best that we could come up with and yeah maybe it'll last for a while and eventually become tyranny and we may have have to again dissolve these things and set up a new government uh here they were uh pursuing freedom and be declaring their independence on the the basis of Liberty knowing that Liberty itself from a human standpoint has its limits but perfect Liberty James said there is a perfect law of Liberty he calls it the law of Liberty it's perfect Liberty this looking into the word of God where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty so therefore we we must look into the revealed word which belongs to us all look into it unless we think that it's momentary or fleeting if we think that well look into it and it's just kind of a happen stance or a glance or having read it once he says continue therein continue in seeking Revelation continue in receiving Revelation continue in performing that which has been revealed to you continue therein and being a doer of what has been revealed to you that we would just not as he said go our way having heard the word just leave kind of go our way but continue in what he's revealed that we are to be a doer of the work one who is performing his perfect will which has been made known unto me that there is a work that I am to do yes amen there is a perfect Liberty there is uh as brother say casting aside all superstitions and all peculiar confessions of Faith let us let us hold fast to that revealed word which belongs to us all but just as democracy has been corrupted because of this ideas of Liberty we must not allow our Liberty to become defiled through Satan's beguiling there is a perfect Liberty but this concept of Liberty it is freedom to become in these two places that we use this concept of Liberty I believe we've identified very particularly that it wasn't you're free now to do what you want in the old time that you're not just you're free you're free now and that we can turn the word of God into a grab bag and just say I'm free to do this I'm free to do that I'm free to do this why because where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and when in fact you are not exercising Liberty you've deceived yourself because where the spirit of the Lord there's liberty but in 1 Corinthians 6:19 it says know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own yes right this very concept of Liberty is not a ship without an anchor it's not all sales and no anchor it is something that is greater than our humanities greater than our politics greater than our our our ways and our our philosophies and trying to figure things out it is the individual coming to know something Beyond themselves the Creator it's the mind of Christ having preeminence in us it is the right way to live wherein you can exercise all the Liberties you have without depriving anyone else of their Liberties it's having Liberty without taking other people's Liberties let me say this in closing musicians you can come to your instruments that there are things that we can have as Americans and there are Liberties that we can take as Christians and there are things that we can do because all things are lawful to us and we can exercise those Liberties but let us not confuse those things that we want to do in our flesh as being the things that we ought to do in the liberty of Christ that is if we are to be free our freedom is to be loosed from the constraints of human thinking and Humanity to be loosed from Traditions but it doesn't mean that every man lives on his own but we all with open face beholding the the same revealed word will be changed to the very same image because our body is not our own it is his therefore my Liberty and I want to emphasize this on Sunday my Liberty isn't just to do anything I want to it's to do as I ought to so therefore if we change the definition of Liberty we've changed the definition of righteousness we've changed the definition of Christ and we're preaching another gospel so Lord help us to be free maybe I I'll just say there's a there was a famous rolling stone song I'm free anybody remember that song anybody remember good we're just when a good group of sanctified people tonight maybe the soup dragons do you remember their cover of that hit I was just doing some research on it and I when I got to this part I I didn't listen to any of it uh but in these lyrics I'm free to do whatever I want any old time so love me and there's this idea I'm free I'm free I'm free and when a group later on in the 90s did a cover of it they in in the in the way that they set it forth they there's this refrain in it I'm free to do whatever I want it's the same old rock and roll song the same old inspiration from below and it goes I'm a new creation uh it's like whoa It's there's some borrowing from this idea of being free I'm a new creature I've been loosed I I've been set free and then this I this sense of being liberated I I I I have a right then to do these things and to express these things and express myself in a certain way but I believe when we make those things when we make our indulgences an expression of true Liberty we typically want to imprison those that don't share in this the same Indulgence and that's very dangerous it's very dangerous God bless you tonight if you could just stand with me
