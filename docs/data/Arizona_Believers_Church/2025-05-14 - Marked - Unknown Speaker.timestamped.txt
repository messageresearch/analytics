[0:00] Ezekiel chapter 9, starting with verse
[0:02] one. He cried also in mine ears with a
[0:05] loud voice, saying, "Cause them that
[0:06] have charge over the city to draw near,
[0:09] even every man with his destroying
[0:11] weapon in his hand." And behold, six men
[0:14] came from the way of the higher gate,
[0:15] which lith toward the north, and every
[0:17] man a slaughter weapon in his hand. And
[0:20] one man among them was clothed with
[0:22] linen, with the writers's inkorn by his
[0:24] side. And they went in and stood beside
[0:27] the brazen altar. And the glory of the
[0:30] God of Israel was gone up from the
[0:31] cherub, whereupon he was, to the
[0:33] threshold of the house. And he called to
[0:35] the man clothed with linen, which had
[0:37] the writer's inkorn by his side. And the
[0:40] Lord said unto him, "Go through the
[0:41] midst of the city, through the midst of
[0:43] Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the
[0:45] foreheads of the men that sigh and that
[0:47] cry for all the abominations that be
[0:50] done in the midst thereof." To the
[0:52] others he said, "In my hearing, go ye
[0:54] after him through the city, and smite.
[0:57] Let not your eyes spare, neither have ye
[0:59] pity. Slay utterly old and young, both
[1:02] maids and little children and women, but
[1:04] come not near any man upon whom is the
[1:07] mark, and begin at my sanctuary. Then
[1:09] they begin at the ancient men which were
[1:12] before the house. And he said unto them,
[1:15] defile the house and fill the courts
[1:17] with the slain. Go ye forth. And they
[1:19] went forth and slew in the city. That's
[1:24] uh some pretty dark scriptures there. uh
[1:26] just a terrible time as we'll see in the
[1:28] scripture and in the message of the hour
[1:30] where this orients us. If we could just
[1:32] bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly
[1:34] Father, tonight as we've gathered in
[1:35] your presence, we've sung songs, we've
[1:37] lifted our hands, we've praised you,
[1:38] we've worshiped you, we've come
[1:40] believing and expecting and we're so
[1:43] appreciative of your presence through
[1:44] the song service. Now Lord, as we
[1:46] approach your word, we're asking that
[1:48] you bless these scriptures which we've
[1:49] read, the quotations which we share, the
[1:51] burden that you laid upon my heart. we
[1:53] just completely yield it to you that you
[1:55] could take control of this service for
[1:57] your glory. For those that are with us
[1:59] tonight that are hurting, uh that are
[2:00] anxious, that are encumbered by
[2:02] different needs, whether it be emotional
[2:03] or physical, we believe that you're able
[2:05] to heal both mind and body, that you're
[2:08] the creator of the heart. You can mend a
[2:10] broken heart that whatever it is we have
[2:12] need of. Your word is sufficient. For
[2:14] those who are unable to be here tonight,
[2:15] we pray that you be with them, bless
[2:17] them, strengthen them, encourage them,
[2:19] any traveling, any with work issues,
[2:21] anyone sick. Lord, tonight we pray that
[2:23] your presence would be with them. We ask
[2:25] all this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:26] Christ. Amen. You can have your
[2:31] seats. My title um this evening is Mart.
[2:36] And I'll come back to this title here in
[2:38] just a moment. Uh that give you a chance
[2:41] to uh jot down what the title is. I know
[2:44] that when I take notes, I like to have
[2:45] the scripture uh and uh the title and
[2:50] the church I grew up in never got
[2:52] titles. So, I was able when I ran the
[2:54] sound, I was able to title all my dad's
[2:56] sermons. So, they sounded really, really
[2:58] good when you listen to them and in the
[3:01] title. So, in the sermon, Convinced then
[3:03] Concerned, we read this on Sunday, and I
[3:06] wanted to mention this again just to
[3:08] kind of tie in a couple scriptures and
[3:10] this theme from the heart of a witness.
[3:13] I believe that every man, every woman,
[3:14] every boy or girl that ever stays long
[3:16] enough, and he was using that example of
[3:18] Andrew who terried with Christ uh even
[3:20] through the night, he said that if you
[3:22] you stay long enough that you're
[3:23] convinced that it is right and it is the
[3:25] Holy Ghost, you are burdened so hard in
[3:28] your heart. Now, you don't want to have
[3:30] a hardened heart, but you want to be
[3:31] burdened so hard in your heart that you
[3:33] can't stand still and let these people
[3:35] die like this in shame and sin. So
[3:38] there's some motivating factor when
[3:40] someone is convinced of truth and then
[3:42] being convinced of truth or concerned uh
[3:45] for all those who are going to be judged
[3:46] by that truth. So to be a witness you
[3:49] must have a heart for truth and you must
[3:51] also have a heart for people. That was
[3:53] our real theme having love in your heart
[3:55] in order to have the heart of a witness.
[3:57] We use the example even of as a mother
[3:59] and even the mother dear as one who was
[4:02] a witness for something real and it even
[4:05] brought a conversion. In Proverbs 14:2,
[4:09] it says, "A true witness delivereth
[4:10] souls, but a deceitful witness speaketh
[4:13] lies." That witness is one who
[4:15] testifies. Uh in the Greek, that word is
[4:17] even martyr. So, it's one who uh bears
[4:20] testimony of their faith. They're a
[4:22] witness. They're willing to bear
[4:24] testimony. And uh those that were
[4:26] bearing testimony in the ages of the
[4:28] martyrs, uh they were willing to not
[4:30] forsake that witness. They were willing
[4:32] to stand by that witness even in the
[4:34] face of death. And so that term uh
[4:37] martyr which means one who stands for
[4:39] their faith or one that bears witness or
[4:40] bears testimony is now associated with
[4:43] those who are willing to do it unto
[4:44] death. And so a witness is one who
[4:47] testifies. And then to witness it's to
[4:49] see or to know by personal experience or
[4:52] presence or observing something so that
[4:54] you know yourself. And the scripture we
[4:57] ended on, I believe we ended on this on
[4:59] Sunday was 2 Thessalonians chapter 3
[5:01] verse 5. It says, ' And Lord, direct
[5:03] your hearts in the love of God and into
[5:05] the patient waiting for Christ. Let that
[5:08] word of God conduct our lives to sing
[5:11] for God, to express his character,
[5:13] nature. Let it express the love of God
[5:15] and then express the strength and
[5:17] endurance of Christ. That I don't want
[5:19] to be weary and welloing. I want my life
[5:21] to be uh led into the love of God and
[5:24] the love of Christ so that can be shed
[5:26] abroad in my heart to others. And we're
[5:28] instructed in the word to love one
[5:30] another. And it's by this you shall know
[5:32] that I am you are my disciples is the
[5:34] love that we have in our hearts for one
[5:37] another. And then even that love that we
[5:39] have towards all. So our desire and our
[5:41] prayer is Lord I want to have this heart
[5:43] of a witness so that I can be an
[5:45] influence. Now uh to my title tonight
[5:48] marked and we're drawing this from
[5:50] Ezekiel chapter 9 verse4 where it says
[5:52] set a mark upon. We're taking that very
[5:55] specifically from that scripture. We'll
[5:57] come to it here in a little bit, but
[5:58] we're looking at it from the standpoint
[6:00] of the phrase is even mark with a mark
[6:03] is the phrase that's used there. Set a
[6:04] mark upon them. And I just even had the
[6:07] idea today later on in the day. I hadn't
[6:10] even really thought of it before. And
[6:11] some of you may not believe me, but I
[6:12] was never really thinking about the
[6:13] legality of a mark or even the legal
[6:16] concept of a trademark. But a trademark
[6:18] is some character or emblem uh some sort
[6:21] of sign and it's placed upon a mark to
[6:25] identify the owner in order to uh give
[6:27] you know certify a certain quality of
[6:29] something but it's done to distinguish
[6:32] rights from all other rights. And so
[6:34] this mark that we're talking about is
[6:36] something that you ha it's a mark that's
[6:38] being placed and it's something that
[6:40] identifies ownership. It identifies a
[6:42] certain quality. Now if you look back in
[6:45] our text in Ezekiel chapter 9:es 1:2
[6:48] just like to start here and just go
[6:50] through this together this evening. I
[6:52] think it's a lot of scripture and maybe
[6:54] just a lot of reading scripture and
[6:56] connecting them together according to
[6:57] the message of the hour. And so I hope
[7:00] that it can still be engaging for you
[7:01] but it does have a lot of emphasis in
[7:03] teaching. Says he cried also in mine
[7:06] ears with a loud voice saying cause them
[7:08] that have charge over the city. So this
[7:10] is Jerusalem. This is the Jerusalem
[7:14] actually going to be destroyed. And
[7:17] these are destroying weapons that are
[7:18] being used against the city. Have them
[7:20] draw near, even every man with his
[7:22] destroying weapon in his hand. And
[7:24] behold, six men came from the way of the
[7:26] higher gate, which lith toward the
[7:28] north, and every man a slaughter weapon
[7:31] in his hand. And one man among them was
[7:34] clothed with linen. And then this
[7:36] characteristic with the writers's ink
[7:38] horn by his side and they went in and
[7:40] stood behind beside the brazen altar. So
[7:43] there's a lot of descriptions being
[7:44] given here. Slaughter weapons, the six
[7:47] men uh destroying weapons. They're
[7:49] they're they're gathering together. Now
[7:51] they're in this place in the tabernacle
[7:54] and in the temple where they're by the
[7:56] brazen altar. And it specifically wants
[7:58] us to see that this one angel clothed in
[8:00] linen has a writer's inkord by his side.
[8:05] Now, as I studied in the message of the
[8:07] hour where brother man places these
[8:08] scriptures, just some of the phrases he
[8:10] uses and the terminology he's using is
[8:12] that this is prophecy of the closing of
[8:14] the Jewish church at the time that the
[8:17] Christian church is beginning. So, we
[8:19] read this. There's could be multiple
[8:21] fulfillments of this. There can be
[8:23] multiple shadows and types uh in this.
[8:26] There could be a compound prophecy,
[8:28] compound fulfillment. But what Ezekiel
[8:30] sees according to the message of the
[8:31] hour is the outpour of the Holy Spirit
[8:33] at Pentecost there at Jerusalem and then
[8:35] the destruction of that city afterwards.
[8:38] That's the time frame he's looking at.
[8:40] This particular part here isn't
[8:41] necessarily uh referring to even
[8:44] symbolically of the spirit of the Lord
[8:45] being poured out upon the church in
[8:47] Acts, but it does show what happens
[8:50] shortly afterwards. So it orients us to
[8:52] that time period. And so think of this
[8:54] in terms of it being this judgment to
[8:56] Jerusalem is judgment to Israel and it's
[9:00] at the closing of the ju gent the Jewish
[9:02] dispensation and the beginning of the
[9:04] Christian church. Now in Matthew 24 15
[9:08] to 21 we'll find that Jesus prophesies
[9:12] of the destruction of Jerusalem. When
[9:14] you therefore shall see the abomination
[9:16] of desolation spoken of by Daniel the
[9:19] prophet stand in the holy place. Who so
[9:21] readeth, let him understand. Then let
[9:23] them which be in Judea flee into the
[9:25] mountains. Let him which is on the
[9:27] housetop not come down to take anything
[9:29] out of his house. Neither let him which
[9:31] is in the field return back to take his
[9:33] clothes. And woe unto them that are with
[9:35] child, and to them that give suck in
[9:37] those days. But pray ye that your flight
[9:39] be not in winter, neither on the Sabbath
[9:41] day. For then shall be great
[9:43] tribulation, such as was not since the
[9:45] beginning of the world to this time, no,
[9:48] nor ever shall be. Now, this prophecy,
[9:51] it sounds it reads in the midst of
[9:53] prophecies about the end time. It's even
[9:55] reading uh it's read right in the middle
[9:58] of prophecies of deceitful things
[10:00] happening in the end time and those
[10:01] things to come and the fulfillment of
[10:03] all things. But this is fulfilled in 70
[10:06] AD when Titus besieges Jerusalem. And
[10:09] during this time there was a great
[10:10] famine. He did it over a period of
[10:12] several months beginning in April all
[10:14] the way until September. And there was
[10:16] cannibalism and there was the death to
[10:19] women and children and babes that were
[10:21] uh nursing and there was great
[10:23] bloodshed. And Josephus says there was
[10:24] over 1.1 million that died during that
[10:27] time. And so in 70 AD we it's brought to
[10:31] pass the prophecy of these slaughtering
[10:34] we weapons we read about in Ezekiel 9
[10:36] that bring judgment on Israel. And I'm
[10:39] just taking this from the message of the
[10:40] hour as I could see it uh over the
[10:42] course of brother Bam's entire ministry.
[10:44] He points out this is the end of the
[10:46] Jewish dispensation and how it's at that
[10:49] time that the word is now going to be
[10:51] turning to the Christian that that
[10:53] Christian church. It's leaving
[10:54] Jerusalem. It ceased. Uh you could read
[10:56] the indictment to see those things more
[10:58] particularly. But this is the end of the
[11:00] Jewish dispensation. And he points out
[11:03] that the ending of this dispensation is
[11:05] prophesied in Ezekiel 9. It's prophesied
[11:07] in Matthew 24. It holds a type for the
[11:10] ending of our dispensation. that what
[11:13] happened then there's similar things
[11:14] that happen now and so it's in that that
[11:16] you could see one prophecy to Israel
[11:18] which is very natural can be fulfilled
[11:21] spiritually to the bride or to the
[11:23] gentile church revelations 7:es 1:3
[11:27] you'll see a very similar prophecy uh
[11:29] related to the end time that is similar
[11:31] to what is happening here in Ezekiel 9
[11:34] and Matthew 24 says and after these
[11:36] things I saw four angels standing on the
[11:39] four corners of the earth holding the
[11:40] four winds of the earth that the wind
[11:42] should not blow on the earth, nor on the
[11:44] sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another
[11:47] angel ascending from the east, having
[11:49] the seal of the living God. And he cried
[11:51] with a loud voice to the four angels to
[11:53] whom it was given to hurt the earth and
[11:55] the sea. So there's an angel that is
[11:57] going to bring pain. And it says in and
[12:01] in verse three, this one that comes
[12:02] says, "Hurt not the earth." This is
[12:04] verse three, Revelation 7:3. hurt not
[12:07] the earth, neither the sea, nor the
[12:09] trees, till we have sealed the servants
[12:11] of our God in their foreheads. There's a
[12:14] lot of things you could read in the
[12:15] message and even a lot of things in
[12:17] context in the Bible just to read more
[12:19] about what's happening here. But notice
[12:21] the similarity to Ezekiel 9 as we come
[12:24] to it. This marking that's going to take
[12:26] place as there was an angel with a
[12:28] writer's by his side. And this is
[12:31] prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem
[12:34] which holds a type of even their time
[12:36] ending and God now turning to the
[12:37] Gentiles. And Jesus prophesies it again
[12:40] in Matthew 24. And this is fulfilled in
[12:43] 70 AD when the besieging of Jerusalem
[12:46] takes place and millions over a million
[12:49] Jews are slaughtered. Here we see
[12:51] prophecy now projected forward that
[12:54] there's going to be a time where there's
[12:55] a slaughtering weapons. There's an angel
[12:57] that's going to bring hurt to the earth
[12:58] and the sea and the trees. But he stops
[13:01] and he's he's held back from doing it
[13:03] until there can be a seal of the
[13:05] servants of God in their
[13:08] foreheads. Now, brother Benham takes
[13:11] this in the feast of the trumpets and he
[13:13] says this and he's he says not exactly
[13:16] 2,000 because the Romans kept on going
[13:18] that Titus in AD.70 on down like that to
[13:21] kill the Jews. The Romans, who was it
[13:24] killed the Jews? Who was Titus? A Roman
[13:27] general. So, I know there's a lot that
[13:28] I'm just picking out here. I just want
[13:30] you to see brother Ram's talking about
[13:32] Titus, uh, Jerusalem. I think he says
[13:35] AD96, but then other places he says
[13:37] AD.70, a Roman general, and the blood
[13:39] rolled out of the gates down there,
[13:41] slaughter them, women, children, and
[13:43] everything. So this is him pointing to
[13:45] this historical event in Jerusalem after
[13:50] the church has been birthed on the day
[13:51] of Pentecost and and and after God now
[13:55] is turning away from the Jews and to the
[13:57] Gentiles and brother Brandham says
[13:59] slaughtering the women, children,
[14:00] everything. Didn't Ezekiel 9 said they
[14:03] say they would do that? So now he
[14:05] orients what happens with Titus in
[14:07] Jerusalem to Ezekiel 9. He says, "Go
[14:10] through the midst of the city and set a
[14:11] mark upon the people who sigh and cry
[14:13] the Holy Spirit and the rest of them the
[14:16] sla then slaughtering man come forth
[14:18] that would be bound. Hold them hold them
[14:20] until they went forth and slaughtered
[14:22] everything that was in there, little
[14:24] women, children, babies, and everything
[14:25] else. They were all slaughtered." So
[14:28] there he even blends in Revelation 7 a
[14:30] little bit in that holding back until
[14:33] they went forth and they slaughtered.
[14:36] Now, I do want to mention I'm still on
[14:39] this this theme in my heart of
[14:40] witnessing and what it means to be a
[14:42] witness and the the art of witnessing is
[14:44] one way that we phrased it, the heart of
[14:45] a witness. And there is this has great
[14:49] application. This is part of me having
[14:52] this burden uh to quicken inside of us
[14:55] the gift to preach the gospel as each
[14:58] one of us is called to do it and to be a
[15:00] witness of this great truth. And so I'm
[15:02] still on this subject of being a witness
[15:04] a and witnessing properly in this end
[15:07] time. Now, brother Brandham associates
[15:09] uh this happening in Matthew 24 to
[15:11] Ezekiel 9 and he says it's happened
[15:13] historically in Jerusalem in AD.70. So
[15:17] let's let's just pick this back up in
[15:19] verse three. Now we've read Ezekiel 9:es
[15:21] 1-2. This writer with an ink corn by his
[15:24] side. It says in verse three, "And the
[15:26] glory of the God of Israel was gone up
[15:28] from the cherub, whereupon he was, to
[15:30] the threshold of the house, and he
[15:31] called to the man clothed with linen,
[15:33] which had the writers's inkorn by his
[15:36] side." So, it's a writer. It's writers's
[15:38] inkorn by his side. And the Lord said
[15:40] unto him, why does he keep calling out
[15:42] this guy with his writers's inkorn? He
[15:44] says, "Go through the midst of the city,
[15:46] through the midst of Jerusalem, and set
[15:49] a mark upon the foreheads of the men
[15:52] that sigh in that cry for all the
[15:54] abominations that be done in the midst
[15:56] thereof." Now, Lord willing, on Sunday,
[15:59] I want to get more into what this
[16:01] sighing and crying is and this
[16:02] characteristic of these. But this p
[16:05] these these uh qualifying thoughts is
[16:08] there's this one in linen, this
[16:10] righteousness, this man clothed with
[16:12] linen or righteousness. He's a
[16:13] representative of Christ. Uh you can see
[16:16] this Christ figure in there. Uh it's a
[16:19] it's a represents the Holy Spirit who's
[16:21] going to be doing the marking. That's a
[16:22] work of God and the work of the Holy
[16:23] Spirit. And he has it aside the writer's
[16:26] ink horn. That would be a hollowed out
[16:28] animal horn uh that was used to store
[16:30] ink. And that ink is going to be used
[16:33] with some sort of uh instrument or some
[16:35] sort of implementation to by a writer of
[16:38] a record. So he'd have a horn of ink.
[16:40] He'd maybe have some writing utensil.
[16:42] Here we could even see that one could
[16:43] use even their finger. And he's told,
[16:45] "You have the horn of ink. You're a
[16:47] writer. Now go and record and go and
[16:50] mark and write upon the foreheads a mark
[16:53] for th of those for upon those that sigh
[16:56] and cry for all the abominations that
[16:58] are being done in the midst of
[16:59] Jerusalem." And this mark, it says set,
[17:03] which is tva, a mark or tav, and it's
[17:07] the same conjugation of the word. It's
[17:09] literally mark a mark on them. And the
[17:13] tav, the letter tav in the Hebrew was
[17:15] originally written in the form of a
[17:17] cross or a t. And so it look appear as a
[17:20] sign of the cross, but it was to make a
[17:22] mark or to sign a sign. And really, we
[17:27] don't know exactly what it was. Uh we
[17:29] could maybe draw some symbolism from the
[17:31] fact that it could have been a cross and
[17:33] this would be a sign of the cross. This
[17:34] would be indicative of the the uh
[17:36] forward looking to the Messiah who would
[17:38] pay the price of salvation upon the
[17:40] cross. But it's meant to express
[17:43] something. It it represents something.
[17:46] In Job 31:35, I think this is the only
[17:48] other place that this phrase is of this
[17:51] tav is used. Oh, that one would bear me.
[17:54] He would hear me. Behold, my desire is
[17:57] that's my mark. It's that same word that
[18:00] tav. Behold, my desire is that the
[18:02] Almighty would answer me and that my
[18:04] adversary had written a book. Not a lot
[18:07] of people uh want their enemies to write
[18:09] a book. But here he's saying that the
[18:12] Almighty would answer me. And even if it
[18:14] is the Almighty who is coming against
[18:17] him and judging him, he wants him to
[18:19] write a book. He's saying my desire,
[18:20] behold my mark, behold my sign, my
[18:25] signature. Here's my pleading. There's a
[18:27] pleading that he's doing. Um, behold, my
[18:29] desire is that I would, the Almighty
[18:31] would answer me. So, when it says, "Set
[18:34] a mark. Set a mark upon the foreheads.
[18:38] Sign a sign. Place a mark. Let it be
[18:41] representative of something. Let it
[18:44] signify something." And he says, "Do it
[18:46] on their
[18:47] forehead." And as I was studying this, I
[18:51] could say that it's one of the most
[18:52] conspicuous parts of a person, their
[18:55] forehead. Some people have forehead for
[18:57] days. Uh but it is something that stands
[19:00] out. It's the four it's I'm I'm getting
[19:02] there too. Uh I've got you know crown
[19:05] for days. Uh but there's a it it's
[19:08] something that's forward. It's the
[19:09] forehead. So it's something that's
[19:11] leading. Remember we're talking about
[19:12] the intelligent. So there's something
[19:13] here about this part of the the the
[19:17] person that's going to be marked and
[19:19] it's so it can be seen. Doesn't say mark
[19:22] the heel of them or the back of their
[19:24] elbow. uh don't mark any other part of
[19:26] the body that could potentially be
[19:27] covered up, but it's something that you
[19:29] wouldn't necessarily cover and it's
[19:31] there to be seen
[19:33] even with with respect to trademark law.
[19:35] If you're going to try to protect a
[19:37] legally registered mark, it needs to be
[19:38] clear. It needs to be reasonably
[19:40] visible. This is for free and it must be
[19:42] noticeable. Maybe it shouldn't be for
[19:45] free. That's good advice. Now in
[19:48] Revelations
[19:50] 14:1 it says, "And I looked and lo, a
[19:53] lamb stood on the Mount Zion, and with
[19:56] him 144,000 having his father's name
[20:00] written in their foreheads." This mark
[20:03] in Ezekiel 9 is the same type of mark in
[20:06] that it is a divine mark to separate
[20:08] people out. It's a divine mark and a
[20:11] distinction among everyone else. And
[20:14] it's placed there prominently on the
[20:15] forehead. It's essential. Uh in Ezekiel,
[20:18] it's going to secure their deliverance.
[20:20] And in Revelation 7, it says, "Don't
[20:23] judge until I've sealed the servants of
[20:25] God in their forehead." So, it's
[20:26] something that is an identifying
[20:29] characteristic similar to the token in
[20:31] the days of the Exodus when they were to
[20:33] place the blood upon the doorpost and
[20:34] the lentil. And it was to form an
[20:36] outward sign, an a visible sign to
[20:38] everyone on the outside of what was
[20:41] taking place, the obedience and
[20:42] observance taking place on the inside.
[20:45] And it was by that sign that judgment
[20:47] was stayed on the firstborn of that
[20:49] house.
[20:51] He stood and he said that it they have
[20:54] his father's name written in their
[20:55] foreheads.
[20:57] Now look at the opposite of this but a
[21:00] similar thing but something opposite.
[21:02] Revelations chapter 17 verse 5. We're
[21:04] just being very focused on this phrase
[21:08] set a mark upon the foreheads. Marked.
[21:11] These people are going to be marked.
[21:13] It's a type of what's happening out at
[21:15] the end time is what I want you to see.
[21:16] So there's this mark that we have. We
[21:18] know that there's the uh the seal of God
[21:21] and the mark of the beast. And these are
[21:22] the things that are kind of in uh those
[21:25] are terminologies that are related to
[21:27] this very thing in Revelation 17:5. And
[21:30] upon her forehead was a name written.
[21:33] So, it's not it's not a phrasing or a
[21:37] symbolism that's left only to the
[21:41] 144,000 or to those that are spared in
[21:43] Revelation 7 and the connection of
[21:46] those. But it's something now that even
[21:48] this one, this false church in
[21:50] Revelation 17 has a name written. And
[21:53] notice in your Bibles if you're looking
[21:54] at it, it's all caps. Mystery Babylon
[21:57] the great, the mother of harlots and
[21:59] abominations of the earth. That's what
[22:02] talk about a big forehead,
[22:05] right? But that's what's written there.
[22:07] And and mystery, Babylon the great, the
[22:09] mother of harlots and abominations of
[22:11] the earth. This is what leads out front.
[22:13] This is what identifies her. And if he
[22:17] didn't have this distinction written on
[22:18] her forehead, we would be a lot like
[22:20] John who's initially just in awe of this
[22:23] powerful, beautiful woman that controls
[22:24] all commerce a and controls what things
[22:27] come and go. And so there is now this
[22:30] crowning or this emblem or this sign or
[22:33] this mark in the head of the mother
[22:35] harlot that is identifying her as the
[22:38] Babylon Babylon the mother of harlots
[22:40] and abominations of the earth written in
[22:42] her forehead. Then there's those that
[22:43] have the father's name written in their
[22:45] foreheads. Those that are
[22:47] sealed in their foreheads. Now notice
[22:50] this contrasting of this mystery Babylon
[22:54] the great in Exodus chapter 28
[23:00] 36-38 and it says and thou shalt make a
[23:04] plate of pure gold engrave upon it like
[23:06] the engravings of a signate holiness to
[23:09] the Lord. If anybody's looking at this
[23:11] in their Bibles, whether it be digitally
[23:13] or in your um your Scullfield right
[23:15] there by your side, it says holiness to
[23:17] the Lord in all caps. So there's this
[23:20] all caps symbol in the head of the
[23:22] mother harlot, mystery, Babylon the
[23:24] great, the mother of harlots and
[23:25] abominations of the earth. And here now
[23:27] there's a sign wholeness to the Lord.
[23:29] And it says, "And thou shalt put it on a
[23:32] blue lace that it may be upon the miter,
[23:35] upon the forefront of the miter. It
[23:37] shall be where is this going to be? on
[23:39] the head on the forefront and it shall
[23:41] be upon Aaron's
[23:43] forehead that Aaron may bear the
[23:46] iniquity of the holy things which the
[23:48] children of Israel shall hollow in their
[23:50] holy gifts and it shall be always upon
[23:52] his forehead that it may be accepted
[23:54] before the Lord. So the high priest had
[23:57] to wear this miter this crowning this
[24:00] hat that says on it holiness to the
[24:03] Lord. It's written. It's placed there
[24:05] and it's going to be there always upon
[24:06] his forehead that it may it be accepted
[24:08] before the Lord. Leviticus 8:9 makes
[24:10] reference to it. And he put the miter
[24:12] upon his head and also upon the miter.
[24:14] Even upon his forefront did he put the
[24:16] golden plate. This is holiness to the
[24:18] Lord. The holy crown as the Lord
[24:20] commanded
[24:22] Moses. What a distinction. Revelation 17
[24:25] to Leviticus 8. One is holiness to the
[24:28] Lord. The other one is abomination and
[24:29] harlotry. But this crown or seal as
[24:33] we've seen it in these other
[24:35] designations, this miter, this signant,
[24:38] this mark, set a mark or make a mark,
[24:41] sign a sign, set a mark upon the
[24:43] foreheads of them that sigh and cry for
[24:45] the abominations that are done in the
[24:46] midst thereof. This crown or the seal is
[24:48] for the purpose of separating out.
[24:51] Notice that it says to do so upon those
[24:54] that are already sighing and crying. So
[24:57] it's to distinguish. It's an emblem o of
[25:00] glory as it we could say maybe one of
[25:02] shame in revelation 17 but it represents
[25:05] something. It's meant to be something
[25:06] that's crowning. But let me let me
[25:09] emphasize this. The the signant and the
[25:12] crown is not the glory but it represents
[25:15] it. The a scepter, a crown, those
[25:18] represent the the glory and the majesty
[25:21] of a king and his kingdom. But it's not
[25:24] what gives him the power. That's
[25:26] conferred divinely or that's given by
[25:28] certain rights. But they're symbolic of
[25:30] that inward
[25:32] glory. Brother Brandham says this in the
[25:34] sermon, the lamb and the dove. He said,
[25:36] you say, is that it, brother Brandham?
[25:38] Let me quote the scripture. He said, go
[25:41] through the city, through the midst of
[25:42] the city, and put a seal upon every head
[25:44] that sigh and cries for the abomination
[25:45] done in the
[25:47] city. Think very intently, and I'm going
[25:51] so quick tonight. We'll beat uh the
[25:53] Pentecostal churches off a happy valley
[25:55] to
[25:57] In-N-Out. That sweet Holy Spirit that
[26:00] something in the human heart makes it
[26:02] call out with the love of God to do the
[26:04] will of God. He's drawing this straight
[26:07] from Ezekiel 9. Now, and I want you to
[26:09] see that there's this sign and the seal
[26:11] that's being placed on the forehead. But
[26:13] notice what brings forth the mark. The
[26:18] sweet Holy Spirit in the human heart
[26:19] that makes them call out with the love
[26:20] of God to do the will of God. Not jump
[26:22] up and down and holler. Not run all over
[26:25] the building. Not speak with tongues.
[26:28] Not pray for the
[26:33] sick. Not prophesy. Not interpret. That
[26:36] ain't what I'm talking about. That's the
[26:38] outward something. Now, this can be
[26:40] tough to swallow.
[26:42] But it's for a purpose. And he says,
[26:44] "But of something that's good, that
[26:46] that's some of the spirit." That's
[26:48] right. So we can never take that away.
[26:50] He said, "But there isn't something in
[26:52] there to anchor you with that, it
[26:54] doesn't do a bit of good."
[26:56] Notice what he's saying is you could
[26:58] jump up and down and holler, run all
[26:59] over the building, speak with tongues,
[27:00] pray for the sick, prophesy, interpret,
[27:03] but if there's not something on the
[27:05] inside that anchors all the outside
[27:07] stuff.
[27:09] I mean, anybody can go to Lids and buy a
[27:11] hat that, you know, that has a mark on
[27:12] it or it says holiness to the Lord and
[27:14] say, "I've got it on my forehead. Here
[27:16] it is." Anybody could go get a tattoo
[27:19] 666 and put on the forehead. That
[27:20] doesn't make him the Antichrist.
[27:23] Can have a a barcode tattooed. I
[27:24] remember one time having a debate with
[27:26] somebody who was like, "Man, they're
[27:27] going to put, you know, these chips in
[27:29] your thumb and you're going to be able
[27:30] to pay for stuff at the grocery stores
[27:31] and gas tanks." And I'm thinking, "Sign
[27:34] me up. I mean, I can leave my wallet at
[27:37] home. You get pulled over. Let me see
[27:38] your license." Insurance, right? How
[27:42] awesome would that be? And he's like,
[27:44] "No, it's going to be the mark of the
[27:45] beast." Mark of the beast. Well, if
[27:47] that's true, then we're all carrying it
[27:50] in the brands of Apple. That's right.
[27:55] Samsung, Apple, the fruit with a bite
[27:59] out of it. Android, a serpent-like
[28:02] creature, a humanlike creature with no
[28:04] soul. Come on,
[28:07] somebody. I feel like I
[28:12] can. He said, "But if there isn't
[28:14] something to anchor you with that, it
[28:15] doesn't do a bit of good. It's the will
[28:17] I was talking about without a hub in
[28:18] it." Now, this is part, listen to this.
[28:20] If that isn't anchored back there by
[28:23] love, it will do more harm than it does
[28:25] good.
[28:28] What does?
[28:30] Prophesying, speaking with
[28:33] tongues, praying for the sick, jumping
[28:35] up and down and hollering, running all
[28:37] over the building. He says it will do
[28:39] more harm than it does good. This is
[28:42] where I want you to be thinking about
[28:43] your witness. Think reme remember in the
[28:46] series, the house of the Lord. I know
[28:47] you got it all categorized perfectly.
[28:49] recall this that if the with that wrong
[28:52] emphasis and you make these things the
[28:54] ought to you can get very judgmental if
[28:55] somebody doesn't do the same thing as
[28:56] you do. And so he says if you don't have
[28:59] love in your heart it'll do more harm
[29:02] than it does good. And and I believe
[29:04] that you should take it to say that the
[29:06] jumping up and down and hollering, the
[29:07] running all over the building, the
[29:08] speaking with tongues, the praying for
[29:09] the sick, the prophesying, the
[29:11] interpreting will do more harm than good
[29:14] if the one doing it doesn't have it
[29:17] anchored by love in their hearts. We can
[29:20] look to the example of the message of
[29:21] the hour. Some of us maybe experienced
[29:22] similar things where one was doing
[29:25] certain things and manifesting certain
[29:26] gifts but knowingly uh brother Brandham
[29:29] knowing that they were living an ungodly
[29:30] filthy life that causes confusion.
[29:36] Now we're we're right into our closing
[29:39] uh some of the closing things here. So I
[29:41] think we just done a really good uh in
[29:43] walking through this tonight. But this
[29:45] act of marking we want to look now at
[29:46] verse five. This act of marking is it
[29:50] says this one who has the writer's
[29:51] inkorn I want you to go and set a mark
[29:53] upon the foreheads of those that sigh
[29:55] and cry. So well why why is he marking
[29:58] them? Why are they being distinguished?
[29:59] This marking would indicate those who
[30:01] are going to be spared from these
[30:04] slaughter weapons. They're going to be
[30:06] spared from the coming judgment. So the
[30:09] marking was for the for a purpose. Think
[30:12] of it this way that there was something
[30:14] about their character first. And so
[30:16] there's now a a sign given, a seal in
[30:19] the forehead, something mark, something
[30:21] given, set a mark upon their foreheads.
[30:24] And now that mark is going to
[30:25] distinguish them, not from people in
[30:27] Jerusalem and not Jews and not Gentile,
[30:30] but it's going to separate out those who
[30:32] are not going to face death or judgment,
[30:35] the judgment upon Jerusalem. Says, "Mark
[30:38] them because there's coming judgment."
[30:40] Verse 5. And to the others he said in my
[30:42] hearing, "Go ye after him through the
[30:44] city and smite. Let not your eyes spare,
[30:47] neither have you pity. Slay utterly old
[30:49] and young, both maids and little
[30:51] children and women. But come not near
[30:53] any man upon whom is the mark, and begin
[30:56] at my sanctuary. Nobody is spared except
[30:59] those whom the ri the angel, the one in
[31:03] the light white linen, who had the
[31:05] writers's ink horn, who set a mark upon
[31:08] their foreheads. Then they began at the
[31:11] ancient men which were before the house.
[31:12] And he said unto them, defile the house
[31:14] and fill the courts with the slain. Go
[31:15] you forth. And they went forth and slew
[31:18] in the
[31:19] city. The mart are sealed from death.
[31:24] They're not going to suffer uh
[31:26] destruction. They're not going to their
[31:27] blood's not going to be shed in the
[31:29] streets. So by I mean just reading this
[31:33] very plainly, all those without the mark
[31:35] are killed. All those without the mark
[31:38] die. They suffered that that part of
[31:40] judgment and they give their lives.
[31:45] As we were mentioning earlier about the
[31:48] sign upon the forehead of mystery
[31:49] Babylon, you probably have thought of
[31:50] this. We referenced the mark of the
[31:51] beast. Revelations 13 16 and 17. And he
[31:56] had power to give life unto the image of
[31:57] the beast. That was the image of the
[31:59] beast that the image of the beast should
[32:01] both speak and cause that as many would
[32:04] not worship the image of the beast
[32:05] should be killed. And he causth all,
[32:08] both small and great, rich and poor,
[32:10] free and bond, to receive a mark in
[32:12] their right hand or in their foreheads,
[32:16] and that no man might buy or sell save
[32:19] he that had the mark or the name of the
[32:21] beast or the number of his name. So
[32:24] there's this mark or letter of his
[32:26] name. Now, we think immediately then
[32:30] we're starting to think about barcodes
[32:31] and outward signs and ways that we could
[32:34] kind of figure out what is the mark of
[32:35] the beast. And we know that there's
[32:37] references uh to 666. It says there's
[32:40] going to be a mark in their right hand.
[32:42] There's going to be one in their
[32:43] foreheads that without these they can't
[32:45] buy or sell except those only those who
[32:48] have the mark or the name or the number.
[32:51] So there's the mark or the name of the
[32:53] beast or the number of his name. And
[32:56] this is the mark of the beast. That's
[32:58] just how we all often think about it.
[33:00] And now well let me read this in the
[33:03] church age book chapter 10. So you could
[33:06] just hear it from brother Brandham where
[33:08] he placed these marks. Thus all the
[33:10] people have to belong to the world
[33:12] church system or be at the mercy or be
[33:17] at the mercy of the elements for they
[33:18] cannot buy or sell without the mark of
[33:20] the beast in the hand or head. This mark
[33:23] in the head means that they will have to
[33:26] take the doctrine of the world church
[33:28] system which is trinitarianism.
[33:30] So the head it's the thinking, it's the
[33:33] ascent, the acknowledgement, the
[33:34] intellect, the knowledge, those things.
[33:36] It's to it's to believe false doctrine.
[33:40] It's to believe the doctrine of the
[33:41] church system. And the mark of the hand,
[33:43] which means to do the will of the world
[33:46] church. So the mark in the head is to
[33:49] believe false doctrine. The mark in the
[33:51] hand is to act according to it. So, it's
[33:54] not it's not so much an actual visible
[33:56] outward sign that if somebody played a
[33:59] prank on you and was able to tattoo you
[34:01] with 666 or get a barcode uh secretly
[34:04] implanted in your scalp or something
[34:06] like that and you think it's just a
[34:08] tumor, but actually it's something very
[34:10] real and something that's identifying
[34:12] you with the mark of the beast that has
[34:13] nothing to do with it.
[34:16] The mark in the head means that you're
[34:17] you believe the doctrine and the hand
[34:20] means you support it.
[34:22] So it's it's it's it's belief and
[34:25] activity according to
[34:28] that. The those that are sealed in
[34:30] Ezekiel 9, they're marked and spared.
[34:34] The rest are
[34:36] destroyed. And we can see this contrast
[34:38] in this mark of the beast. Revelations
[34:40] 13, they receive a mark in the right
[34:42] hand and in her foreheads. And
[34:44] Revelations 14, notice what it says
[34:46] here.
[34:48] uh chapter this chapter begins with the
[34:50] ceiling of the 144,000 with the father's
[34:53] name written in their foreheads. So now
[34:54] we have this contrasting image. Verses
[34:57] 9, 10, and 11. And the third angel
[34:58] followed them, saying with a loud voice,
[35:00] if any man worship the beast and his
[35:02] image, and receive his mark in his
[35:04] forehead or in his hand, the same shall
[35:06] drink of the wine of the wrath of God,
[35:08] which is poured out without mixture into
[35:09] the cup of his indignation. And he shall
[35:12] be tormented with fire and brimstone, in
[35:14] the presence of angels, and in the
[35:15] presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of
[35:18] their torment ascendeth up forever and
[35:19] ever. and they have no rest day dare who
[35:22] worship the beast and his image and
[35:24] whosoever receiveth the mark of his
[35:27] name. We can see these two different
[35:29] marks. The one that set a mark upon the
[35:32] foreheads of those who are signing and
[35:33] crying for the abominations that are
[35:35] done in Jerusalem and they are going to
[35:37] be spared judgment. But in the absence
[35:40] of that mark, there are those that are
[35:41] sealed. They have sealed their fate and
[35:43] are going to be judged and they are now
[35:45] under the mark of the beast here in the
[35:48] scripture and they are going to be
[35:49] tormented with fire and brimstone in the
[35:51] presence of holy angels in the presence
[35:53] of the lamb. All those that receive the
[35:55] mark of the beast they have that mark or
[35:58] the name of the beast or the number of
[35:59] his name in their foreheads and in their
[36:02] hands. Now I hope that's all makes sense
[36:06] to you both spiritually and according to
[36:08] the message of the hour according to the
[36:09] Bible. Now I want to read again
[36:12] something that we begin reading in the
[36:14] at the very beginning in Feast of the
[36:16] Trumpets. So now we can just kind of
[36:18] collect all this together and see it in
[36:20] one picture here. Didn't Ezekiel 9 say
[36:24] that they would do that? What was it he
[36:26] said that they would do? They're going
[36:27] to go through and slaughter women,
[36:30] children, and everything. Blood rose out
[36:32] of the gates. This is Matthew 24. This
[36:34] is the siege of Jerusalem. This is
[36:36] judgment coming at the time that God is
[36:38] turning to fully to the Gentiles. Didn't
[36:40] Ezekiel 9ine say they do that? Go
[36:42] through the midst of the city and set a
[36:43] mark upon the people who sigh and cry
[36:46] and the Holy Spirit and the rest of
[36:47] them, the slaughtering men come forth
[36:49] that would be bound. Hold them. Hold
[36:50] them until they went forth. And the
[36:52] slaughtered, everything that was in
[36:54] there, little women, children, babies,
[36:55] everything else, they were all
[36:56] slaughtered. And then he says, exactly
[36:59] here it is again repeating
[37:01] itself. Preaching feast of the trumpets.
[37:04] very important message. He says, "And
[37:07] here is that ecclesiastical system
[37:09] coming right back, smothering out,
[37:12] tramping out everything that's called
[37:13] God." Oh, they got their systems and
[37:16] organizations and denominations, but
[37:18] that don't have nothing to do with the
[37:19] Bible. They'll tell you quick they don't
[37:20] even believe in it.
[37:23] And so what happened in Ezekiel 9 or
[37:26] what was prophesied in Ezekiel 9, what
[37:28] was prophesied again in uh Matthew 24,
[37:31] what happened in those days of a
[37:33] physical slaughter to the Jews, he says
[37:36] here it is again repeating itself
[37:40] happening again in a spiritual sense.
[37:42] Just as they see those demons that are
[37:44] loosed uh as physical persecution upon
[37:47] the Jews and there's this actual
[37:49] slaughter of Jews, there's also this
[37:51] spiritual persecution that is loosed
[37:53] upon the
[37:54] bride. And I'd like to I want to end
[37:57] with this that this
[37:59] prophecy of
[38:01] Ezekiel speaks of
[38:03] judgment. And when we read it in
[38:06] Ezekiel, we read it as this final
[38:08] outcome. They went through the city and
[38:10] he slew all these people. When we read
[38:12] about it in Matthew, he's warn he's
[38:15] giving them warning and then when we
[38:16] hear what happened in uh 70 AD, we see
[38:19] man great many people lost their life.
[38:21] But the prophecy is not just judgment,
[38:24] but it's it's the warning first.
[38:28] Think just just join with me and and
[38:31] give me uh maybe some benefit of the
[38:32] doubt on some things or just listen to
[38:34] what I'm trying to say and that I trust
[38:35] the Holy Spirit can impress this upon
[38:37] your heart. What was done in what was
[38:39] said in Ezekiel 9 reads as if we're
[38:41] being told what's going to happen. In
[38:44] Matthew chapter 24, it changes it just a
[38:47] little bit, but it's the same with
[38:48] Matthew chapter 24. It's saying that
[38:50] these things are going to transpire.
[38:52] These things are going to
[38:55] happen,
[38:57] but it serves as a warning. Not just
[39:01] waiting waiting for it to happen and
[39:02] then it's going to happen. He gives
[39:04] warning. Notice what brother Brandham
[39:06] says in the seal of the
[39:08] antichrist. He said, "Go in the
[39:12] city." It's a There it is. He said, "Go
[39:15] in the city and set a seal upon the
[39:18] forehead of those men in Jerusalem that
[39:19] sigh and cry for the abominations that's
[39:21] did in the city. Otherwise, before the
[39:24] great destruction of AD70, Titus sieging
[39:26] the walls of Jerusalem, the city, the
[39:28] Holy Spirit went forth first." Are you
[39:30] listening? Listen to how this happens.
[39:33] And historically they have record of
[39:35] this and there's those that wrote about
[39:37] it. There's a lot of maybe theology and
[39:39] and different things that's related to
[39:40] it. But I think we could just take very
[39:42] simply the things that brother Brandham
[39:44] lays out for us in the message. Titus
[39:46] sieges Jerusalem and the hol he says the
[39:49] Holy Spirit went forth first. The man
[39:52] dressed in white with markers the pencil
[39:54] on his
[39:55] side to put a mark upon the men who
[39:58] sighed and cried for the abomination
[39:59] that was done in the city. And he says
[40:02] God foretelling it so they would be sure
[40:05] to get ready.
[40:07] So what we read in Ezekiel 9 is just not
[40:10] a it's going to happen so just kind of
[40:13] sit back and watch it unfold. But Christ
[40:16] then revives that prophecy and he uses
[40:19] it as a way of warning the believer.
[40:23] Destruction's coming. So be ready. These
[40:26] are the signs to look for. He says God
[40:29] foretold it so that they would be ready
[40:32] in the ca at the time that the siege
[40:34] comes.
[40:36] I want to make this relevant to the time
[40:38] that we're living in in the fullness of
[40:39] the gentile dispensation. He will turn
[40:42] to the Jews when the bride is gone. Here
[40:44] it's repeating itself again. And in
[40:46] Matthew chapter 24 verse 14. And the
[40:50] gospel of the kingdom shall be preached.
[40:53] I want you to really just lean into this
[40:55] a little bit and think about this. what
[40:56] he's saying here. The gospel of the
[41:00] kingdom shall be
[41:05] preached in all the world for a witness
[41:08] unto all nations and then shall the end
[41:14] come. This is the end that we're in now.
[41:18] And then right there he begins to speak
[41:20] just for a little bit about the
[41:22] abomination of the desolation spoken of
[41:24] by Daniel. It's verses 15 that we've
[41:26] already read to
[41:27] 21. And so he's saying this is going to
[41:30] be the gospel must be preached into all
[41:32] the world for a witness, a testimony
[41:35] unto all
[41:38] nations. It must be it must be
[41:42] expressed. It must be
[41:46] displayed. And then he immediately gives
[41:49] the parallel to what happens in the time
[41:52] of Jerusalem.
[41:54] this is what's going to come to
[41:56] Jerusalem that there's going to be those
[41:58] that are going to be marked as exempt
[42:02] from judgment. There's going to be those
[42:03] that suffer judgment a very literal
[42:05] physical way. So he gives us this
[42:08] example of Jerusalem and the destruction
[42:11] of Jerusalem, the siege of Jerusalem in
[42:13] 70 AD, right after he says the gospel
[42:16] must be preached for witness unto all
[42:18] nations. There must be a witness to all
[42:20] the world. Then the end, the finality,
[42:22] the judgment's going to come.
[42:25] So my question is, who's going to tell
[42:27] them?
[42:31] How how are they how was anybody going
[42:34] to
[42:35] escape? How was it they were going to
[42:37] know what Ezekiel said? How was they
[42:38] going to know what Christ said? How was
[42:40] it that there were people who were ready
[42:42] to avoid the siege? Because Jesus is
[42:46] telling them, "Be looking for these
[42:48] signs. Be aware. Be knowledgeable." So
[42:50] that when this happens, you can flee
[42:52] before it happens. You can be outside
[42:53] the city. You won't be
[42:55] stuck. Listen to this extraordinary
[42:58] statement that brother Brandham shares
[42:59] in question and answers. He says,
[43:00] "According to history, there wasn't one
[43:02] of them that believed in Jesus that
[43:04] believed the word that was that wasn't
[43:06] that was watching but was watching for
[43:08] that to
[43:10] happen. Those that believed in Jesus and
[43:14] believed his word were watching for that
[43:17] event to take place. And they escaped
[43:21] and went from Jerusalem into Judea. And
[43:23] they fled for their lives. And not one
[43:26] of them, are you listening? I'm almost
[43:27] done. Because they were warned by their
[43:30] shepherd and were watching for that hour
[43:31] to come. When they heard Titus was
[43:34] coming, they took off, ran for their
[43:36] lives, and got out of the city. So there
[43:38] were those who believed in Jesus and
[43:41] believed his word. And when that moment
[43:43] came where now's the time we got to
[43:45] leave, we got to get out of here. there
[43:46] were those who were watching and
[43:48] prepared. Amen. So there is there is
[43:51] still yet we could say that from the
[43:53] time the prophecies given in Ezekiel 9
[43:56] and those hundreds of years later to
[43:57] when Jesus speaks of it again, there's
[43:59] going to be time for others to come into
[44:02] the knowledge of who Jesus Christ is and
[44:05] to believe that word and look to that
[44:07] word and understand its times and its
[44:09] seasons and what it refers to and know
[44:11] it's time to get out of here. Amen. And
[44:14] we're just speaking about it as it's
[44:16] fulfilled in there in Matthew 24. But
[44:18] what about today? What about the gospel
[44:21] needing to be preached in all the world
[44:24] for witness unto all nations? Why is it
[44:27] preached? Not to tell everybody they're
[44:29] going to hell,
[44:31] but so that others could hear the word
[44:34] and believe
[44:37] and escape.
[44:40] We have a duty to tell them.
[44:48] Lord willing, we'll touch on this in
[44:49] greater detail, but let me just read
[44:51] this uh on uh on Sunday if God would
[44:54] allow, but let me just read this last
[44:55] statement in having
[44:58] conferences. He says, we read over in
[45:00] the book that it is said that an angel
[45:01] went forth and put a
[45:03] mark upon those who sighed and cried for
[45:06] the abominations that were dead in the
[45:08] city.
[45:10] realizing by scriptures that was the
[45:12] first coming of the Holy Spirit through
[45:13] the city of
[45:14] Jerusalem. First coming of Christ, the
[45:18] inauguration of the Christian church at
[45:20] on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem.
[45:22] And then he says, "And then on his
[45:24] second return in this age to call a
[45:27] people out of the Gentiles for his
[45:28] name." You following that?
[45:31] So there was a mark placed on the elect
[45:34] in Jerusalem at the time of his first
[45:39] coming. And all those that had that seal
[45:41] of God who were believing that word,
[45:43] none of them were caught in the city.
[45:46] That's what history teaches us. He says,
[45:48] and this is the phrase that he uses
[45:49] next. Now in a second return in this age
[45:52] to call the people out of the Gentiles
[45:53] for his name, how much more should we be
[45:55] concerned?
[45:57] How much more should we be concerned in
[46:01] this coming? How much more should we be
[46:03] concerned in signing and crying for the
[46:05] abominations that's done? We see
[46:08] churches practicing rock and roll and
[46:10] playing bingo and having all kinds of
[46:11] swimming contest and so forth in the
[46:13] church when prayer meetings and all
[46:15] night terry meetings are
[46:19] forgotten. Well, that's just that's just
[46:21] the
[46:23] outward. What is it? They're missing
[46:26] that inward part.
[46:29] And that's why there's not a seal.
[46:30] There's not a witness of concern.
[46:34] There's not a witness that they take it
[46:37] seriously on his second return. Think of
[46:40] this, church. Should we not be more
[46:42] concerned?
[46:44] Should we not be more How much more
[46:47] should we be concerned in sighing and
[46:50] crying?
[46:51] Let's think about whether or not we have
[46:53] this in our hearts to sigh and
[46:56] cry. You could, brothers, you could come
[46:58] to your instruments. Let's stand
[46:59] together. Let's
[47:08] pray. Brother Elazer, you're an
[47:10] inspiration to me. 45 minutes. I don't
[47:12] know if I'm even close to that, but I
[47:14] love how he can just he he can just
[47:16] bring such a perfectly complete thought
[47:19] and he's us like 45
[47:21] minutes. If I'm going to be here in
[47:23] church, I want Brother Eliza preaching.
[47:25] No, I enjoy it, but I I know it's short,
[47:28] but uh I know that you can get as much
[47:31] as you need out of this tonight. Let's
[47:33] just bow our heads in prayer. Our
[47:34] heavenly father, Lord, tonight as we bow
[47:37] our heads and our hearts and we speak to
[47:38] you at the close of this service, we do
[47:41] desire that you would continue to anoint
[47:44] the words which have been
[47:46] shared. For myself, Lord, I know that
[47:49] I've been
[47:50] very it's been very painstaking in terms
[47:52] of just combing through the message of
[47:54] the hour to be certain of
[47:56] what brother Brandham where he placed
[47:59] these things. And I know that there's a
[48:02] lot of interpretations and voices in the
[48:05] world, a lot of commentaries and many
[48:06] would concur and agree
[48:08] and on these these premises and these
[48:12] bases of
[48:14] judgment. There's a lot that look to
[48:16] these things being fulfilled in the
[48:18] end. And we can see that there is a
[48:23] fulfillment. There is a part compound
[48:27] meaning is compound type in this
[48:28] compound prophecy. We can see that once
[48:31] again here we are in the last days, the
[48:34] climax of Satan's
[48:37] Eden, the time when you've come to unite
[48:39] together with your church, your
[48:43] bride, we're told with with judgment
[48:48] coming, there's going to be a mark upon
[48:50] those who sigh and cry for the
[48:53] abominations. And we're not just chasing
[48:55] after a mark. We just don't want to have
[48:57] a nice crown or a miter. This is
[49:00] something in the heart of the believer
[49:02] that
[49:03] cries. It's not
[49:05] selfish. It has all these attributes and
[49:08] characteristics of your divine nature
[49:10] which is called
[49:11] charity. And Lord, I pray that we could
[49:14] look into our hearts and into our lives
[49:15] and examine whether or not there be any
[49:17] area that we could
[49:20] improve so that we can be separated out.
[49:25] Not solely for the purpose of escaping
[49:27] judgment or
[49:28] alone but so that we can be a signpost
[49:32] and a warning to
[49:34] others because there's warning then
[49:36] judgment and as we have received our
[49:39] last sign. Lord, may we be the last
[49:41] sign. May we be that final voice that
[49:44] can lift up the right things in the
[49:46] right
[49:47] way. Speaking truth and being truthful
[49:50] about
[49:51] it so that we can see salvation come to
[49:54] our own homes, our extended families on
[49:56] the job. Healing can come to those who
[49:58] are sick. Deliverance can come to those
[50:00] that are bound. I pray Lord that you
[50:03] bless us tonight as we stand in your
[50:04] divine presence. Give us strength and
[50:06] courage for the things that are ahead of
[50:08] us. We ask all this in the name of Lord
[50:10] Jesus Christ. Amen.
