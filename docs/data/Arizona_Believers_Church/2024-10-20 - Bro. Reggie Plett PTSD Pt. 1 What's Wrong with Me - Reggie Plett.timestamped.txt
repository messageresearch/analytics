[0:00] Psalms 56 and we're going to read verses
[0:03] 1-4 David says be merciful unto me oh
[0:08] God for man would swallow me
[0:11] up he fighting daily oppresseth
[0:15] me my enemies would daily swallow me up
[0:20] for they be many that fight against me
[0:24] oh thou most
[0:26] high what time I am afraid I I will
[0:30] trust in
[0:32] thee in God I will praise His word in
[0:37] God I have put my trust I will not fear
[0:42] what flesh can do unto me amen may God
[0:46] add His blessings to his word you can be
[0:48] seated this
[0:55] morning
[0:56] um this morning I have for a title
[1:01] uh
[1:02] PTSD part
[1:04] one what's wrong with
[1:07] me and
[1:11] um I I'm very nervous speaking about
[1:15] this subject um only for the sake
[1:19] of uh I'm I I I never fought in the
[1:24] military um I'm certainly not a a a
[1:27] doctor I don't have any clinical
[1:30] expertise and so
[1:33] um
[1:35] PTSD uh is uh stands for post-traumatic
[1:39] stress disorder uh it's very serious and
[1:44] um there's varying stages of it and I
[1:46] know that if there's somebody who's been
[1:49] in the military somebody who who has
[1:50] been diagnosed with PTSD this is
[1:52] something that's very serious very very
[1:55] serious
[1:57] um and um so I I I say this I I speak
[2:03] about this with uh with only a varying
[2:07] degree of of of understanding and and I
[2:10] and I wouldn't want to um take lightly
[2:14] anybody that would have a serious
[2:17] condition and would understand PTSD to a
[2:21] a a deeper depth than what than what my
[2:25] understanding is
[2:26] but um I've titled
[2:30] PTSD part one what's wrong with me and
[2:33] the part
[2:34] one is not
[2:36] because uh I want you to come back
[2:39] tonight for part two or three or four um
[2:43] in fact I don't I I don't have in mind
[2:46] any other part to this so it's not that
[2:48] I have any other part but perhaps you do
[2:52] perhaps somebody else would know part
[2:56] two or part three or part four
[3:00] to this
[3:04] subject and the National Institute of
[3:08] Mental
[3:10] Health says that postraumatic stress
[3:15] disorder
[3:17] PTSD is a disorder that develops in some
[3:20] people who have experienced a shocking
[3:23] scary or dangerous
[3:26] event it is natural to feel afraid
[3:29] during and after a traumatic
[3:33] situation fear is a part of the body's
[3:37] fight or flight response which helps us
[3:40] avoid or respond to potential
[3:43] danger people may experience a range of
[3:47] reactions after trauma and most people
[3:50] recover from initial symptoms over time
[3:54] those who continue to experience
[3:57] problems may be diagnosed with PT
[4:03] SD I look at
[4:06] this and this post traumatic stress
[4:11] disorder is the idea that the post part
[4:14] is that after somebody has experienced
[4:18] something that has brought on traumatic
[4:23] stress it's not your normal everyday
[4:27] stress it's not stress that you've dealt
[4:29] with on a regular basis that you've
[4:31] grown up with that hey I'm you know hey
[4:33] lay off of me Mom lay off of me Dad I'm
[4:35] stressed out this is uh this is a
[4:38] traumatic
[4:40] stress and I think we all um those that
[4:44] are familiar with those with this PTSD
[4:47] this post-traumatic stress and and those
[4:49] that have gone to war those soldiers who
[4:51] have come back and been diagnosed with
[4:54] PTSD we've understood that we we can
[4:57] understand that even though we've maybe
[4:59] never G and been in a war zone have
[5:01] never been on the Battlefront we can
[5:04] understand soldiers experiencing
[5:07] traumatic things I had a grandfather who
[5:09] fought in World World War II I think he
[5:12] was blown out of a tank he he he he he
[5:15] worked in a tank and he was blown out of
[5:16] a tank five times while in service and
[5:20] so I say that's just the grace of God
[5:22] that he would that he would live um
[5:25] being blown out of a tank five times um
[5:30] and you just hear if if you've ever
[5:32] spoken with a a soldier who who has come
[5:34] back and has has great trauma and
[5:36] they're uh trying to to to deal with
[5:39] this and and
[5:41] and and and many of them are on
[5:43] medications and many of them are going
[5:45] to to therapists to try to deal with the
[5:48] things that they've seen and um there's
[5:50] so many interviews that I've that
[5:53] I've witnessed and I remember hearing
[5:55] about one man who fought in Vietnam and
[5:58] and he wasn't that anything that he had
[6:01] done and and and that's the idea a lot
[6:03] of times people think well what did you
[6:05] do the idea is what did you do um while
[6:10] you were over there that brought this
[6:12] upon you and a lot of times it isn't
[6:14] anything that anybody has done it's
[6:16] something that they may have just
[6:18] witnessed one of the interviews that I
[6:21] that I had heard was this man had gone
[6:22] over to Vietnam and he said there was
[6:25] really no fighting going on for him he
[6:27] was on a boat and he said and some of
[6:29] the men that he was with were just so
[6:32] bored that they were taking the gun from
[6:34] the boat and they were just shooting at
[6:38] fishermen over in Vietnam just killing
[6:41] innocent fishermen because they they
[6:43] thought we're probably never going to
[6:45] see action and they wanted to to
[6:48] discharge some of some of the the
[6:51] bullets and things and and and he was
[6:53] saying I've got PTSD just from
[6:58] witnessing what these other men were
[7:00] doing and you think when you hear some
[7:03] of these stories they're so they're you
[7:05] you you just your heart just breaks for
[7:08] these
[7:09] people and it and and and so many times
[7:12] it uh it's not even that they while
[7:15] they're in the Heat of the Moment while
[7:17] they're in the throws of battle um they
[7:20] they're engaged and they don't have time
[7:22] for this to kick in and then it's when
[7:25] they come home it's when they when
[7:27] they're back from battle that they they
[7:29] begin to recognize uh something will
[7:32] happen a lot of times there'll be some
[7:34] uh it could be a loud noise or something
[7:37] uh a flash of light that that will
[7:40] trigger uh this this fear or this uh you
[7:44] know as as this National Institute of
[7:48] Health
[7:50] uh the just this range of emotions of
[7:53] trauma that that is affected by and
[7:56] triggered by certain things
[8:08] I remember seeing a video of a man who
[8:10] was uh I believe he served with the
[8:13] Nazis so he he he was in Germany and so
[8:16] many of those men you hear so many of
[8:17] those stories they they never wanted to
[8:19] be a Nazi they they just because they
[8:21] were in Germany and they were young men
[8:23] they they they they were enlisted to be
[8:26] a part of that but some of the men I
[8:30] remember seeing a video of one
[8:32] man and he was older I think he was in
[8:34] America I'm not sure where he was but
[8:37] they they they brought out his old just
[8:39] a helmet Ju Just a helmet that one of
[8:42] DSs would have been wearing and they and
[8:45] he's sitting in a chair and they've got
[8:47] his attention this way and they bring a
[8:49] a helmet and as soon as he sees the
[8:52] helmet he begins convulsing and and and
[8:56] weeping and and it it was enough
[8:59] to to trigger a
[9:02] memory that then set this even uh
[9:07] physical condition off where he's
[9:10] shaking and and physically
[9:13] crying and while I'm while we're
[9:17] speaking of these things and we're we're
[9:18] talking about soldiers who are going
[9:20] through this and we're talking about
[9:21] people who have going through
[9:23] this the reality for me is not that I've
[9:26] I've again I've never I I I never joined
[9:29] this service I've never fought in a in a
[9:31] war or or had to be see any of that on a
[9:34] daily basis you know I feel we're safe
[9:36] here in America we don't have a lot of
[9:38] those conditions around us to to be able
[9:41] to witness that the reality is that it's
[9:45] not just war that can bring traumatic
[9:49] stress to
[9:52] somebody and that some people's
[9:55] tolerance for stress levels is different
[9:59] than somebody else's some people can
[10:01] tolerate a lot more than other
[10:07] people and what's
[10:10] very what I'm very keenly aware of as as
[10:13] I've gotten older
[10:16] and and especially as you you gather
[10:21] with people and you fellowship with
[10:23] people in a in a church who have come
[10:27] from other churches
[10:29] from split
[10:32] churches is that I've heard more and
[10:36] more over the years from
[10:40] Believers I think I've got
[10:43] PTSD from what I
[10:46] experienced at
[10:55] church and as you begin to fellowship
[10:57] and you begin to speak with people that
[10:59] have gone through something like that
[11:01] and if you've ever experienced something
[11:04] like that you can enter right into their
[11:10] sufferings you begin to say well what
[11:13] what took place and and oh that's
[11:14] familiar oh that's familiar and that's
[11:17] familiar and You Begin entering right in
[11:20] and going oh wow I could see yeah that's
[11:24] I'm so sorry that sounds very stressful
[11:27] I'm so sorry you had to go through that
[11:37] in
[11:38] the church age book in the th tyan
[11:41] Church age brother brandom is reading
[11:44] from uh Revelations chapter 2
[11:49] uh God's message to the thiyan
[11:52] church and in there he comes upon as
[11:57] brother brandham so beautifully does as
[11:59] he's just going through those scriptures
[12:01] as he's just reading through the
[12:03] scriptures there in Revelations 2 and 3
[12:06] those those chapters dealing with the
[12:08] church
[12:09] ages he's going through those scriptures
[12:11] and he's taking little portions of those
[12:14] scriptures and he's explaining the
[12:16] Revelation behind those phrases that are
[12:19] within those scriptures and he comes
[12:20] upon this phrase within the thyren tier
[12:23] and church age I will put upon you none
[12:25] other burden brother brandom says uh as
[12:28] he quotes that the word for burden is
[12:31] weight or pressure the pressure of the
[12:34] Dark Ages was either Bend or be broken
[12:39] bow or die it was the
[12:43] Inquisition the power of the Empire
[12:46] backing up satanic worship be organized
[12:51] or pay with your life each age had its
[12:56] pressures for example
[13:00] a great burden of the last
[13:03] age is the pressure of
[13:06] riches soft living and nervous tensions
[13:11] in a complex age that we seem unfitted
[13:16] to live
[13:17] in and I think those that of us that say
[13:21] I believe we're living in that last age
[13:24] and we hear brother brandom say all of
[13:28] these things
[13:30] the pressure of riches not the pressure
[13:33] of being rich just the pressure of
[13:36] riches whether you whether you're rich
[13:38] or or or you wish you had Rich riches
[13:41] that pressure is more prevalent today
[13:44] than ever before because of economy
[13:46] because of because of uh uh now we're
[13:49] not speaking about just one country
[13:51] we're talking about a whole global
[13:53] economy working together and those
[13:55] pressures then are are are are just
[13:58] ratcheted up for us so you can read that
[14:01] and go amen I know about
[14:04] that soft
[14:08] living and as Believers we understand
[14:16] that not well I've got it
[14:21] easy it's the idea
[14:25] of becoming uh
[14:30] almost that
[14:31] lukewarm where's our Zeal where's my
[14:34] Zeal for God and and and that pressure
[14:37] isn't uh is so so often Lord am I
[14:42] letting down am I letting you
[14:46] down and those nervous tensions in a
[14:49] complex age that we seem unfitted to
[14:53] live in and why is it that we seem
[14:55] unfitted to live in it and it's because
[14:59] uh the the the the the
[15:02] rest that we
[15:04] experience as as Christians when we when
[15:08] we when we're in when we're looking into
[15:10] the word of God and we're talking about
[15:12] the things of God and when we're in this
[15:14] this economy in God's economy it's an
[15:17] economy of rest and and you you and I
[15:21] can experience that when we come to to
[15:23] church on a Sunday morning or a
[15:24] Wednesday night especially perhaps a
[15:27] Wednesday night when you're in the
[15:29] middle of a a work week and the
[15:30] pressures of the world are on you and
[15:32] you come to church and you go oh this is
[15:35] just
[15:36] refreshing to to to to have this the
[15:40] right mindset in a world that does not
[15:46] amen and so these these nervous tensions
[15:50] in this in this complex age that we're
[15:53] unfitted because we as Believers as Sons
[15:57] and Daughters of God uh we're not we was
[16:01] never intended for
[16:04] us uh uh now God certainly knew who to
[16:09] put in this
[16:11] age I believe that I believe that that
[16:15] that God uh for ordained you to live in
[16:18] this age knowing that you were the one
[16:22] that could withstand
[16:24] these these tensions this pressure in
[16:28] this age that you were pressurized for
[16:31] this
[16:34] day but the one thing that we're looking
[16:37] forward to the one thing that we that
[16:39] that that Lord come quickly Lord Jesus
[16:42] please come quickly is because this is
[16:45] not what we're meant to end up
[16:50] with is this
[16:56] world in the message spiritual
[16:59] Amnesia and I'm drawing i' I've I've
[17:02] drawn most of
[17:05] this
[17:08] uh this sermon from listening to these
[17:11] sermons like spiritual Amnesia and the
[17:14] demonology series the demonology
[17:16] physical Realms and religious Realms I
[17:18] just I I I just really love those
[17:20] messages I think brother brandom it
[17:22] sounds like ah demonology do I really
[17:24] want to get into that but brother
[17:26] brandom does such an a lovely job of
[17:28] saying hey this isn't something spooky
[17:30] this is something that that is very
[17:33] clear and should be and in in in fact at
[17:36] the end of that series he says I've got
[17:38] to go around the world again and retach
[17:40] this now and so um but in spir the mess
[17:45] is spiritual Amnesia brother brandom
[17:46] says now this Amnesia we're told it is a
[17:49] cause it it is a cause you to be
[17:54] able to be to a place where you cannot
[17:57] identify yourself now it's an unusual
[18:00] thing it don't happen too often but the
[18:03] causes is from shock it's somebody that
[18:07] don't even know who they are you find it
[18:10] from Wars sometimes soldiers get it
[18:13] sometimes people get it not that
[18:16] soldiers aren't people they
[18:19] are but I think he just means common
[18:22] folk uh another thing causes it is worry
[18:26] worry will cause it now brother brand
[18:28] going all the way into Amnesia having
[18:30] Amnesia now Amnesia is is is is to
[18:33] another level of of of just being um of
[18:36] having an overloaded stress level
[18:39] Amnesia to the place to where well I
[18:42] think we all know what amnesia is maybe
[18:44] for the young children Amnesia where
[18:46] when when when they can't remember who
[18:49] they are or or events around
[18:54] them but I think what what brother
[18:56] brandham is alluding to here is that
[18:59] shock from war can get so bad that this
[19:02] PTSD can get to such a place it can
[19:05] bring on
[19:07] Amnesia now what's amazing is if you go
[19:10] and listen to this message spiritual
[19:12] Amnesia brother brandom said this was in
[19:14] a time of
[19:15] prosperity that that this was happening
[19:17] in the time of prosperity that Israel
[19:20] forgot God and by forgetting God they
[19:23] then begin to forget who they were and
[19:26] as brother brandom is going through that
[19:28] sermon he's saying let us as Believers
[19:31] not forget who we are let's not forget
[19:34] what we're identified with who we're
[19:37] identified with that when we not just
[19:39] look at our family history and say boy
[19:42] I'm not real proud of that but that's
[19:44] not the lineage we want to look to we
[19:46] want to look to that Hebrews 11 those
[19:48] Heroes of Faith to know that that though
[19:51] I may not physically have ever come from
[19:54] the lineage of Abraham by faith I am a
[19:57] son of Abraham that I believe that that
[20:00] same faith that Abraham had for some
[20:03] reason or another God saw fit to put
[20:05] that kind of faith in me to hear the
[20:08] word of God and say I believe
[20:11] that I believe that's true and so then
[20:14] when when the word of God comes fresh
[20:17] and it comes in a day when when when it
[20:19] seems that the ministers or the experts
[20:22] would say something to contradict the
[20:24] Simplicity of the Gospel would maybe say
[20:27] something like well I don't know that
[20:29] God does things quite like that anymore
[20:31] we say whoa that doesn't quite ring true
[20:34] to me I believe Jesus Christ is the same
[20:37] yesterday today and forever and so we
[20:40] say no I believe that God does still
[20:42] heal and and they say yeah but this is
[20:45] stage four of this you say well I don't
[20:48] know it doesn't matter to me which stage
[20:49] 1 2 3 4 five or whatever the stages are
[20:52] I know God can heal and do the
[20:54] impossible and when we begin to uh
[20:57] recognize not only only uh uh who God is
[21:01] uh but what God has done and then it
[21:04] begins to help us it builds our faith to
[21:07] say okay are you a part of
[21:10] that and if you say well and and believe
[21:14] me I know this I do know this that one
[21:17] of the tactics of the enemy is that
[21:20] Amnesia uh the whole purpose of brother
[21:23] random goes into it when they would
[21:24] capture the children of Israel and haul
[21:26] them off to Babylon they would change
[21:28] their names they would change their
[21:30] identities so that they would forget
[21:32] everything that they knew they were and
[21:36] and and take on a new
[21:39] identity and that identity was to lessen
[21:42] the individual and was to cause them to
[21:44] lose faith in the true and living
[21:54] God one of the things that can cause it
[21:56] is worry
[22:04] we'll get back to that message in the
[22:06] message standing in the Gap brother
[22:08] brandham if you ever listen to that
[22:11] message standing in the Gap brother
[22:12] brandham gets very
[22:15] real says how that his intentions were
[22:17] to run off into the
[22:20] Wilderness he would come out whenever he
[22:23] would want to give a message like one of
[22:24] those Old Testament prophets and then he
[22:26] would go back into the wilderness
[22:28] God said no I've called you to a higher
[22:31] order than
[22:32] that brother brandom said he began to
[22:34] build a
[22:36] complex he had begin to build a complex
[22:39] and the reason he built a complex you
[22:40] say well why would he build a complex he
[22:43] couldn't he rise above that
[22:46] well then you begin to look at the
[22:48] pressures that were put on him as a man
[22:51] you say man I couldn't blame him I I'd
[22:54] been done way before but he says here
[22:57] I'd been preaching for years years and I
[22:59] become an old man and an old veteran
[23:02] preacher and had a lot of hard battles
[23:04] and maybe I'm scarred all cut up on the
[23:07] inside from fights because my lot that
[23:10] the lord gave me was not back to kiss
[23:12] the babies and to marry the young and
[23:14] bury the old but it was to hold a
[23:16] two-handed sword at the Battlefront
[23:19] against the Ws of paganism and
[23:20] demonology and the powers of darkness
[23:23] and fight with it fight it with the word
[23:26] of God till I seen the
[23:29] defeated I've been cut deep many
[23:33] times so brother brandom is is is he
[23:36] he's giving us a window into his own
[23:38] life that by me taking on but uh being
[23:43] called to the position I was called to I
[23:46] I've been cut many
[23:49] times you hear brother Brandon many
[23:51] times on many of sermon say oh my you
[23:54] think oh if only I could see a vision in
[23:56] that sort of thing and he says but you
[23:58] don't know what it's like when somebody
[24:00] comes up to you and says oh how I love
[24:02] you and you know better because of that
[24:04] Discerning
[24:09] gift how'd you like that to be able to
[24:13] after service everybody you're shaking
[24:15] hands with you can just see they love
[24:17] you they don't they they don't they
[24:22] don't they don't they don't they don't
[24:24] they don't you're like wow there's so
[24:26] many more that don't
[24:32] again in spiritual Amnesia he says God's
[24:35] word Vindicated
[24:38] proofed I don't want to just read over
[24:40] that that this is a tremendous statement
[24:43] God's word
[24:45] Vindicated proved that the baptism of
[24:48] the Holy Ghost is just the same as it
[24:51] ever was on the day of Pentecost or any
[24:53] other time right
[24:56] amen and Jesus Christ is the same
[24:59] yesterday today and forever and your
[25:01] attitude towards that identifies whether
[25:05] you have spiritual Amnesia or not that's
[25:09] right no matter whether if you're a
[25:12] deacon or even if you're a preacher it
[25:15] doesn't yeah they get it
[25:17] too so we find out it's contagious and
[25:21] it hits the whole
[25:24] thing you mean to tell me that PTSD our
[25:27] deacons are are able to get that or a
[25:30] minister is able to have that to the
[25:32] place to all the way to the place where
[25:35] they begin to forget they get spiritual
[25:41] Amnesia and things begin to get cloudy
[25:44] and they don't even know who they are or
[25:45] what they believe anymore yes
[26:09] I think if we were to go home with each
[26:10] other we were to sit down and begin to
[26:12] talk about our past our
[26:15] stories there'd
[26:18] be they'd go right down this
[26:27] alley now PTSD is postraumatic stress
[26:33] disorder calling it a
[26:35] disorder but I didn't title this PTSD
[26:39] for the sake of looking into
[26:41] post-traumatic stress disorder but
[26:44] rather post-traumatic stress
[26:52] Deliverance I don't think brother
[26:54] Brandon was preaching spiritual
[26:56] Amnesia just to to point
[26:59] out that well you've got it and you've
[27:03] got it and you've got it and you're
[27:05] going I know I know you know and and if
[27:09] we were all real and say hey how many
[27:11] have' gotten to that kind of place to
[27:12] where you forgot who you are as a child
[27:15] of God that you forgot that you were a
[27:18] son or a daughter of God and and and and
[27:20] and and when the hands begin to go up
[27:22] and they're and they're you know and
[27:24] we're getting right down to the
[27:26] nitty-gritty and God is you know is is
[27:28] is here as a discerner and he's
[27:30] searching your heart and
[27:32] saying do you know this to be true and
[27:36] you're like I know I know I know so
[27:41] what so what I've got
[27:44] it so I've got
[27:47] it the point is there is
[27:55] deliverance and this is the
[27:59] thing I'm going to I'll share something
[28:01] with you it's very personal but I'm
[28:04] going to share it with
[28:06] you
[28:11] uh I feel like I've always been fairly
[28:13] light-hearted I feel like uh from a
[28:16] young child
[28:18] uh I it was
[28:21] just I don't know I I I guess I could
[28:24] always see the glass more than half full
[28:28] always even if it was only half full it
[28:30] was like nah we can put a little more in
[28:33] it and it'll be more than half full you
[28:34] know was just always light-hearted so I
[28:38] never uh that that state of uh we had a
[28:43] good home you know I was raised you know
[28:45] in in a church that believed the message
[28:47] of the hour so I so again my
[28:50] my I wasn't in a volatile
[28:54] home nothing like that it was very very
[28:57] good very good home and so um for me to
[29:02] be able to to to joke and to be
[29:05] light-hearted um wasn't wasn't something
[29:08] that came from Deep wounds that you you
[29:11] you you find a lot of people do they use
[29:13] that as that that that wasn't me it
[29:15] wasn't me so then as I got older and I
[29:18] became an adult and I you begin to meet
[29:20] people who who
[29:24] uh who've had anxiety attacks and and P
[29:28] panic attacks and those things it's very
[29:32] easy the the thought ah is very easy to
[29:36] come by now you don't I'm not saying
[29:38] that I I held on to this but it's very
[29:40] easy to say that's it's in their head
[29:43] it's all in their head that's just a
[29:45] kind of a statement that's in their
[29:48] head and then if you've ever experienced
[29:50] it you realize no no this is much
[29:53] more this this is much
[29:56] more and I can remember the first time
[30:00] uh uh that I ever had uh an overload of
[30:04] anxiety and I guess you would call it an
[30:08] anxiety attack or a panic attack
[30:11] and and it was this
[30:16] microcosm of a million things and you
[30:19] would say well what was the thing what
[30:21] was what was the one traumatic thing
[30:24] that took you to that place and it
[30:25] wasn't there wasn't one I couldn't I
[30:27] couldn't say that this one thing
[30:29] happened it was a million little
[30:32] things it was just multiple things
[30:35] stacking up just stack stack
[30:37] stack and your your mind begins to go
[30:40] into overload because you can't process
[30:43] each of those things there's so many
[30:45] things that have got to get knocked off
[30:46] the list that you can't handle you you
[30:49] just don't know even where know where to
[30:51] start it's just I can't stop I can't
[30:54] shut this off and it begins to this is
[30:58] where then worry comes in you begin to
[31:01] worry about it or and then and then that
[31:05] that worry doesn't help anything and it
[31:07] just
[31:13] accumulates and I can remember um it it
[31:19] was um thankfully I you know I had a
[31:21] loving wife and she said you know come
[31:24] home
[31:25] and and uh you know we'll take care of
[31:28] you or whatever and so you go into the
[31:29] room and there's this idea you know
[31:34] that um when when you see somebody like
[31:37] that going through something like
[31:39] that words don't uh they don't really
[31:43] have much of an effect human words so
[31:45] somebody could say to you right Point
[31:47] Blank while you're going through it uh
[31:51] I'm here for
[31:54] you and you know they are you absolutely
[31:57] genuinely know they're there for
[32:01] you but in the moment it's not helping
[32:05] you at all not doing anything they say
[32:10] um it's going to it's all going to be
[32:13] okay and and you're like yeah
[32:17] yeah you know I think I'm an adult
[32:19] enough and smart enough and and and I've
[32:21] been walking this way long enough to
[32:23] believe like you know I think as as it
[32:26] was
[32:28] that Jesus when Lazarus died
[32:31] and he said you know he's going to live
[32:34] and she's like I know Lord in the
[32:37] resurrection and he's like no no no no
[32:40] no no you don't understand what's about
[32:41] to happen and she didn't she didn't
[32:44] understand that but that's the idea is
[32:47] that it's it's all going to be okay and
[32:49] you're like I know ultimately it's all
[32:51] going to be okay I've you know I've
[32:52] sealed that in my heart I'm you know
[32:56] eternally sealed you know like if I die
[32:59] I'm in a better place anyway you know so
[33:02] so then the idea like it's all going to
[33:04] be okay it's all going to work out
[33:06] you're like yeah ultimately I know that
[33:08] but right now it's
[33:14] not
[33:18] and so that's when you need something
[33:21] Supernatural something beyond the
[33:23] natural and the world doesn't know where
[33:27] to go for
[33:28] that right they they don't know they
[33:31] they don't know that peace that passes
[33:33] all
[33:34] understanding what they know is you know
[33:38] there's a there is there a pill for
[33:41] this you know is there a is there a
[33:44] medical fix for this CU I trust the
[33:46] doctors I trust the science and you're
[33:48] like well that's good at least you got
[33:50] trust in something that's good but as
[33:52] Believers it's look that's a temporary
[33:56] like I'll take them I'll take you know
[33:58] I'm certainly not afraid to take what a
[34:00] doctor would prescribe but I know
[34:03] ultimately I'm going to need something
[34:06] Supernatural Amen to take care of me in
[34:10] this
[34:11] moment and so I I I made it home and and
[34:15] I'm in the room and and I'm and I'm
[34:17] praying and just praying to God I know
[34:19] where to go to I know where the I know
[34:22] where the source is the source of life I
[34:24] know where help my help comes from I
[34:27] know that
[34:29] and and you know that well you're going
[34:30] through it cuz you're crying out please
[34:33] Lord Jesus help me through this right
[34:35] now please God help me through this
[34:38] while I'm laying there and I'm praying
[34:40] to
[34:41] God I hear something
[34:45] say I've got it all under
[34:50] control and that was it that was enough
[34:53] for me it was the first time I'd ever
[34:55] experienced it and that was enough for
[34:57] me me it it was it was what I
[35:00] needed and it's that idea of God taking
[35:06] you and wrapping you in his arms amen
[35:10] and pulling you
[35:11] in and saying I've got
[35:14] you and you're thinking I'm going to
[35:16] fall and he's like
[35:19] nope I've got you he say I'm going to
[35:22] fall apart and he's like uh-uh because
[35:25] I've got you and that that's the idea
[35:28] that's what you need that's that's what
[35:30] you need and and and many of times
[35:32] that's we that that's why we need each
[35:34] other right so I could say you know to
[35:37] my my darling wife you know please wrap
[35:39] your arms around me and hold me during
[35:41] this time and that is that is so nice
[35:44] but
[35:47] ultimately when it's not it's it's not a
[35:51] physical thing it's your soul it's
[35:54] something inside of you that needs to be
[35:56] held together you need somebody who can
[35:59] do that who is the Unseen that can go to
[36:03] the Unseen and hold it together and that
[36:08] is when we know we need the Supernatural
[36:11] and that is why this subject this
[36:13] morning is not PTSD the subject this
[36:16] morning is Divine Healing that's the
[36:19] subject the subject of of of the title
[36:23] spiritual Amnesia is not about Amnesia
[36:26] it's about div Divine Healing from
[36:30] Amnesia it's that Divine Healing and the
[36:33] the the whole purpose of listening to
[36:35] the of these to these sermons like
[36:37] demonology is not to go oh there's
[36:40] demons out there it's to know that yes
[36:43] there's demons out there but there is a
[36:45] God who is above those demons who is
[36:47] greater than those
[36:52] demons so in Psalms 103
[36:55] 1-3 these are the scriptures brother
[36:58] brandom uses as his text for that
[37:02] demonology uh Physical Realm anyway
[37:05] bless the Lord oh my soul and all that
[37:08] is within me bless His holy name bless
[37:12] the Lord oh my soul and forget not all
[37:16] his benefits who forgiveth all thine
[37:20] iniquities who Health all thy diseases
[37:25] now you can say diseases you can say
[37:27] disorders whatever you want to call it
[37:30] he's a Healer of all of that he is the
[37:34] Healer of all of that and if you've ever
[37:37] gone and had this post traumatic stress
[37:41] in your life he's a Healer he can heal
[37:45] it
[37:46] amen not just a remedy for you know this
[37:49] will this will get you by for the week
[37:51] no he can heal it heal it
[37:55] amen hallu
[38:01] now brother brandom says in demonology
[38:04] Physical Realm now the first thing what
[38:06] a demon is you hear so many people
[38:08] talking about a demon well now a demon
[38:10] devil all comes from one word and in the
[38:13] English it's called
[38:16] Tormentor and so many of our brothers
[38:19] little brothers and
[38:21] sisters that that's what they would call
[38:23] their other brother or sister who's just
[38:25] tormenting them all the time but we just
[38:27] don't allow him to say that we just
[38:29] don't let him call each other demon or
[38:31] or
[38:32] devil but it's a Tormentor it's
[38:35] something that would that's just
[38:36] tormenting you tormenting you tormenting
[38:39] you it's a demon a fellow that torments
[38:42] is a devil a evil one he say now the
[38:44] Bible today uh is is to most to many
[38:49] people is some old back book that
[38:52] Grandpa and Grandma read or something
[38:54] like that there's not much to it it's
[38:56] for the old folks and so forth but
[38:58] that's wrong it's for
[39:01] everybody and demons are tormentors that
[39:04] torment
[39:10] us now all sickness as he goes down a
[39:13] little further now all sickness we have
[39:15] to find first that all sickness came
[39:18] from the devil God is not the author of
[39:23] sickness no sickness comes from God God
[39:26] sometimes perit Satan to put sickness on
[39:29] you as a whip to bring you back to the
[39:32] house of God now that's not God's whip
[39:33] remember that's Satan Satan holds the
[39:36] whip God allows Satan with that whip to
[39:39] bring you back to the house of God when
[39:41] you've disobeyed but sickness in its
[39:43] beginning come from the devil could you
[39:46] imagine a person would believe that God
[39:50] our heavenly father would be the author
[39:52] of such a thing as sickness and death
[39:54] well no he isn't never was never will be
[39:58] God permits death because of
[40:01] Disobedience God permits death as one
[40:03] writer said all that death can do God
[40:06] harnessed it to a buggy and it pulls Us
[40:09] in the presence of God a Believer but
[40:13] the word death means
[40:17] separation so now we understand this
[40:20] that that this thing uh it's it it's
[40:24] it's an
[40:25] [Applause]
[40:26] awareness this PTSD now we we're just
[40:29] have an awareness now we're catching an
[40:31] awareness that this is a
[40:34] Tormentor this is something that is
[40:37] tormenting me this is not of
[40:40] God this is something that is tormenting
[40:43] me now uh I will say this many times we
[40:47] we you know again in the title it there
[40:50] is what's wrong with me what's wrong
[40:53] with
[40:54] me and so we'
[40:57] you know I'd love to stand up here and
[40:59] say it's not you it's somebody
[41:03] else it's nothing you did but many times
[41:06] it
[41:08] is PTSD many times is caused by
[41:11] something somebody did themselves it
[41:15] isn't always something they witnessed
[41:17] many of times it's something they did
[41:19] and then there's this realization I
[41:21] can't believe that I had that within me
[41:24] to do
[41:25] that and when that happens
[41:28] it raises this thing within you that who
[41:31] am I what am I capable of doing and this
[41:35] awareness triggers this this nervousness
[41:39] and this uh this
[41:45] disorder this is why brother brandom so
[41:48] many times people would come through the
[41:50] prayer
[41:51] lines and he would say you
[41:55] know what is it that you're what is it
[41:57] that you're wanting and he says oh I see
[41:59] you've got something in your life you
[42:01] need to go make that right you need to
[42:04] go take care of that and he and and and
[42:08] and many of times when when when brother
[42:10] Brandon would hold these meetings uh
[42:13] many of those meetings were based upon
[42:16] uh you know they would send out flyers
[42:18] they would put it in the newspaper
[42:19] Divine healer Coming To Town come and
[42:22] bring your sick and so people were just
[42:24] grabbing people from hospitals it's not
[42:26] they weren't all going to Church they
[42:28] just knew someone who was sick and they
[42:30] wanted hey if there's something to this
[42:33] hey let's let's go the doctors sure
[42:36] haven't seen to help it wasn't based
[42:38] upon well we believe the word of God oh
[42:40] I know the Bible no many of times none
[42:43] of them had ever picked up a Bible in
[42:45] their lives and so brother Brandon would
[42:47] start these meetings and he said now by
[42:49] the end of the week now we're going to
[42:51] have a prayer line but he would start
[42:53] the meetings with services to say let's
[42:57] make sure your soul is
[42:59] right if we can take care of that it
[43:03] will take care of all of the rest the
[43:06] healing part yes you want your body to
[43:09] be healed you want this infirmity to go
[43:11] away I believe I want the same thing for
[43:14] you but it could come
[43:17] again you'll probably get sick again and
[43:20] you might get sick with something
[43:24] worse you might get something that's
[43:27] that that you know this time you know
[43:29] you've just got an abscessed tooth or or
[43:32] you've got something you might later in
[43:34] life have a tumor you might L later in
[43:37] life have cancer you might later in
[43:40] whatever it would be but one things for
[43:43] certain if we can get that Soul
[43:46] sealed then it then the the the the
[43:50] ultimate thing is taken care of
[44:02] so you got to clear out the
[44:04] channel why say there's a kink in the
[44:06] hose and you got to you got to get those
[44:08] you got to get that kink out of the hose
[44:11] you know you say oh God help me God help
[44:13] me God help me you know I need this I
[44:15] need this I need this and it's like well
[44:17] unkink the hose and let it flow you know
[44:20] God it it'll flow but if you're kinking
[44:23] the hose let go of the hoe quit quit
[44:26] kinking the hose
[44:29] I want God to flow I want God to flow
[44:31] brother brandom help me what's wrong
[44:33] with me he says well you know I okay
[44:35] hold on because of this gift that God
[44:37] has given me I see something in your
[44:39] life where you were dishonest with your
[44:41] husband you need and don't you dare say
[44:43] a word about that he's like well we
[44:46] can't really go any
[44:50] further but I made that right with God
[44:53] but the problem was it between you and
[44:55] God the the Kink was in this other home
[44:58] is is in your home life here that's
[45:00] where the
[45:02] king's well to ease her mind I guess
[45:07] maybe well just so you know he's got the
[45:09] same thing to confess to you
[45:12] what when then they work that out and
[45:15] praise God you you you read the end of
[45:16] the story and they you know both coming
[45:18] and confessing you were right we're so
[45:20] sorry and then you know these others
[45:23] taken care of now in Matthew 11
[45:28] 11: 28 Jesus's words he says come unto
[45:32] me all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[45:35] and I will give you
[45:45] rest brother brand does such a nice
[45:49] job
[45:51] of laying that scripture out and letting
[45:53] us know that that rest the word there is
[45:56] Sabbath
[45:57] and that that same Sabbath that that
[46:01] word rest was not um just oh okay take
[46:05] the load off and I'll kick back for for
[46:08] the rest of time now but the idea was
[46:11] that brother brandom set before
[46:15] us was this same word is the word that's
[46:20] used in the beginning that after God had
[46:25] made the the the heavens and the Earth
[46:28] and light and darkness and and and all
[46:30] the animal life and he made man on the
[46:33] seventh day God rested
[46:36] Sabbath he rested from his
[46:40] works and here brother Brandon begins to
[46:43] demonstrate to us that it's you this
[46:46] rest that Jesus is promising is that
[46:49] baptism is that new
[46:51] birth and he's saying it's you resting
[46:54] from your
[46:55] works you trying to do it you trying to
[47:01] putting up basically doing what Adam and
[47:03] Eve had done by creating their own
[47:05] covering with fig leaves it's like do
[47:08] away with that there's something better
[47:11] that God has already provided there's a
[47:14] lamb skin God has already provided that
[47:18] you don't have to work anything up God
[47:22] has already provided and I'm so thankful
[47:25] because when when we can when we apply
[47:28] this idea of this worry this anxiety
[47:32] this this this this traumatic stress
[47:35] that we've got from for whatever reasons
[47:38] for whatever
[47:41] reasons we can
[47:44] rest we can we can not only is it that
[47:48] he's he's got me under
[47:50] control you're like I've got it under
[47:53] control and and and you're going I know
[47:55] you do but saying
[47:57] then I'm not in control I'm going to
[48:01] take my hands off and not try to be in
[48:10] control
[48:12] now okay let's hurry up I think we can
[48:15] get through
[48:18] these I've got
[48:20] multiple uh to me one of the most
[48:22] tremendous
[48:26] things that we have access to
[48:29] today
[48:31] is that this message has been recorded
[48:34] so we can we can hear
[48:38] it and um I I can remember there was a
[48:42] uh a friend of
[48:43] mine who was having
[48:47] severe anxiety
[48:49] attacks severe yeah had to he had to
[48:52] have people come and stay with him and
[48:55] um
[48:57] he would get hot and he would need the
[48:58] fan and then he would have to turn the
[49:00] fan off because just the air on his skin
[49:03] bothered him and it would trigger this
[49:05] it was just severe you just you just
[49:07] couldn't believe uh how severe it was
[49:10] and I
[49:12] was ministering one time and and I was
[49:15] just
[49:16] expressing some things to uh over the
[49:19] pulpit and and he came up to me
[49:21] afterwards and he and he just said man
[49:24] thank you so much you have no idea how
[49:28] much that that that helped me and he
[49:32] said you know what what what do you what
[49:35] would help you know what is what is the
[49:37] thing that would that would really help
[49:40] and I said
[49:41] listen I don't know about you but I know
[49:45] for me that when I put a tape on if I
[49:48] hear the words good evening
[49:51] friends it's
[49:55] soothing not the wor words not the order
[49:57] of the words but the feeling that's
[50:00] behind
[50:01] it and when I hear words like I'm only
[50:05] here to help ease the suffering of
[50:09] mankind that's all my purpose here is is
[50:12] if I can help ease the suffering of
[50:15] mankind you have to when you hear that
[50:18] either
[50:20] say I believe that he really means that
[50:24] or you say ah those are just words that
[50:26] he's using to pass time in an opening of
[50:29] a sermon to get through that's not true
[50:33] right it's not true if if if you're
[50:36] listening to the tape and you're
[50:37] listening and you hear brother brandom
[50:38] say all I want to do is help ease the
[50:41] suffering of man
[50:43] kind it's like oh thank you Lord
[50:48] amen so I said you know if you hear
[50:51] something like that go and listen to
[50:53] tapes where brother brand expresses
[50:56] things like that that and then I said
[50:57] and then I said if you're struggling you
[51:00] know you know somebody's telling you you
[51:02] know well you got to you should hear
[51:03] this sermon and then you should hear
[51:05] this sermon you're like I mean have you

[51:32] course I'm going to love it love them
[51:34] all but I said look if you if if you're
[51:37] struggling with that I said man just put

[51:42] 20 minutes just just if you don't if
[51:44] you're like I can't pay attention fine
[51:46] just go to the last 20 minutes just just
[51:48] forward all the way to the prayer line
[51:51] go all the way to the end to the prayer
[51:52] line and when you get done with that go
[51:54] to the next one and just go to the
[51:55] prayer line don't listen Ser just go
[51:57] right to the prayer line at the very end
[51:59] and when you can hear the care of
[52:02] somebody who surrendered go to God that
[52:04] says now I'm just waiting on him you
[52:07] know what I'm doing I'm just waiting on
[52:09] him now then he begins to discern and

[1:01:30] keep it he's
[1:01:41] faithful I'm closing with this I believe
[1:01:44] brother Aaron has used this quote
[1:01:48] before it's uh it's in the questions and
[1:01:51] an Series in there in 1964 and I love
[1:01:54] those I I I try to encourage many of the
[1:01:57] young people uh go to all the questions
[1:02:00] and anwers series and I say and in
[1:02:02] between the questions pause it and try
[1:02:04] to answer the question yourself so when
[1:02:07] you hear a question then stop then stop
[1:02:09] it don't go on and you try to answer the
[1:02:12] question the way you think the answer is
[1:02:14] even as scholarly as you've been through
[1:02:17] Sunday school and all of that you try to
[1:02:19] answer the way you think the answer is
[1:02:21] going to go and then go ahead and play
[1:02:22] it and you just God never ceases to AIT
[1:02:26] me how perfect how perfect it is but
[1:02:31] this is from 1964 the questions and
[1:02:33] answer is number two you will you will
[1:02:36] recognize this I know you will question
[1:02:38] 290 question brother brandom what shall
[1:02:42] we do something has settled over me that
[1:02:44] I cannot break through last fall I
[1:02:46] dreamed I was lost in white sand it was
[1:02:50] getting dark I couldn't find my way this
[1:02:53] dream has stayed with me since last last
[1:02:56] fall now I am as one groping in darkness
[1:02:59] my son Irvin and wife were included in
[1:03:02] my dream now they're also in darkness
[1:03:05] we're in desper we're in desperation I
[1:03:07] believe God will show you what is uh in
[1:03:11] our hearts now Mrs oh all right if we're
[1:03:14] wrong or sinning places tell us we want
[1:03:18] to be right okay so we'll stop there
[1:03:21] here's this question I had this dream it
[1:03:24] shook me up
[1:03:26] and and it included my
[1:03:29] son and his wife and now we're all shook
[1:03:33] up because of this dream that we're in
[1:03:35] White Sands and we're lost this is the
[1:03:38] question what's wrong with us brother
[1:03:41] brandom we just believe that you'll have
[1:03:43] the answer so you stop the tape and
[1:03:45] you're like okay now I'm going to
[1:03:47] diagnose this
[1:03:52] myself so brother brandom says I I don't
[1:03:55] know the lady but I just feel if you're
[1:03:58] here lady that here is your trouble
[1:04:00] you've let something happen to you
[1:04:02] that's made you
[1:04:04] nervous because being in White Sands
[1:04:07] represents Purity and
[1:04:09] righteous and you're just letting Satan
[1:04:11] put one over on
[1:04:13] you your dream proved that there's
[1:04:15] nothing wrong you're only nervous and by
[1:04:19] doing this and thinking this you're
[1:04:22] making the rest of your family nervous
[1:04:25] stop doing it claim your god-given
[1:04:30] rights your dream proves by the
[1:04:33] interpretation that you are in white
[1:04:35] sand everything's all right it's you
[1:04:39] yourself
[1:04:42] nervous and you let one member of the
[1:04:45] family get nervous it goes to the next
[1:04:48] member and the next member and the first
[1:04:51] thing you're all fussing and going on
[1:04:55] and one one member of the family gets
[1:04:57] kind of upset about something it it
[1:04:59] upsets the other and the other and the
[1:05:02] other the first thing you know the whole
[1:05:04] family's upset it's
[1:05:07] Satan then if one member of the family
[1:05:11] rejoices let the rest of them Rejoice
[1:05:14] with it so everyone of the family try to
[1:05:18] do
[1:05:19] that try each one of you children to
[1:05:24] help your papa mama mama you papa you
[1:05:30] try to help the children don't let that
[1:05:33] gloomy unbelieving Spirit get around you
[1:05:38] you are Christians you are borned of the
[1:05:42] spirit of God you're the salt of the
[1:05:45] earth you have god-given
[1:05:49] rights and the Bible said if there be
[1:05:52] any praise if there be any virtue think
[1:05:56] on these things don't think about the
[1:06:01] wrong
[1:06:04] thing I remember when brother brother
[1:06:07] Aaron had read that in a in one of his
[1:06:10] sermons and it just hit I mean it just
[1:06:14] hit it was like that's so
[1:06:16] true that is so true on on so many
[1:06:24] levels that it just goes from one to the
[1:06:26] next and and and when you see it in your
[1:06:28] own home when you're when you're when
[1:06:31] you're
[1:06:32] witnessing uh a little bit of an
[1:06:34] argument or just volume getting raised
[1:06:37] or something and then all of a sudden
[1:06:39] somebody else is raising the volume and
[1:06:40] then some all of a sudden things just
[1:06:42] begin happening in your and you're like
[1:06:44] what is happening right now this is so
[1:06:47] strange this is what's
[1:06:49] happening it's Satan and he's allowing
[1:06:52] this nervousness to be built up and this
[1:06:56] nervousness can cause and he says don't
[1:06:58] do that don't do that and children help
[1:07:02] help in the house you help one another
[1:07:05] and and Mama you help and papa okay Papa
[1:07:08] help with the kids help with the kids
[1:07:11] Papa don't let these fusses and things
[1:07:14] like that
[1:07:16] happen brother brandom is giving this
[1:07:18] this practical advice and and and and
[1:07:23] and and to give this relief
[1:07:26] of this white sand is Purity it's
[1:07:29] righteousness you're a
[1:07:32] Christian you're a son and daughter of
[1:07:35] God and to me and musicians you can come
[1:07:38] is it musicians or musician today it's
[1:07:40] musicians I think I think we have
[1:07:42] musicians
[1:07:46] today you can come I'm I'm just
[1:07:48] finishing
[1:07:52] up but
[1:07:56] this
[1:07:57] question that we ask and many times if
[1:08:00] you're if you're going through this if
[1:08:02] you've ever had
[1:08:04] this in your life this anxiety this PTSD
[1:08:08] what whatever you want to whatever you
[1:08:10] want to say that has been one of the
[1:08:14] questions that is just so it just comes
[1:08:17] out it's what's wrong with
[1:08:21] me what is wrong with me could you know
[1:08:27] I'm a
[1:08:28] Christian I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:08:30] daughter of God I you you've search you
[1:08:34] search your heart and you say God is if
[1:08:36] there's if there be any wickedness in me
[1:08:39] take it from me Lord try my Reigns you
[1:08:42] as a Christian you're you're your
[1:08:46] desires are
[1:08:48] right you're already going down that
[1:08:51] road and then a Tormentor comes
[1:08:53] along and he tormenting you and he'd
[1:08:56] love to get you to think that perhaps
[1:09:00] it's something spiritual and if it is as
[1:09:04] Christians we get that right we clear
[1:09:06] that
[1:09:09] up but this is why brother Brandon in he

[1:09:53] forget what he's done
[1:09:56] what he's doing and what he can
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:05] do Divine
[1:10:08] Healing didn't go
[1:10:11] away in 1965
[1:10:28] God to him the promises to him that
[1:10:34] believes places where brother brandom
[1:10:36] says you're the one that's got the
[1:10:38] Divine
[1:10:39] Healing it's your
[1:10:42] faith that operates that it's your faith
[1:10:46] I could pray for you he says I could
[1:10:48] pray for you for hours and hours and
[1:10:49] hours and if you don't believe it it
[1:10:52] won't do you any good
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:11:04] there's things that come upon us that
[1:11:06] happen in our life that you're not in
[1:11:08] control of I'm not in control of they
[1:11:10] come across your way and you're a real
[1:11:11] victim and then there's so many things
[1:11:14] in
[1:11:15] life that I bring on myself
[1:11:19] true there's so sometimes that nervous
[1:11:23] tension that nervousness and that upset
[1:11:25] and that that uh chaos begins to build
[1:11:28] in the home because of
[1:11:32] me and when I hear brother brandom say
[1:11:36] something like
[1:11:37] this to somebody who's very concerned
[1:11:40] about this dream and very concerned
[1:11:42] about their self and concerned about
[1:11:44] their
[1:11:46] family not knowing what it is but just
[1:11:49] hoping and believing that brother
[1:11:51] brandham somebody like brother brandham
[1:11:54] can help them
[1:11:56] and ultimately I believe this this
[1:11:58] sister knew brother brand can you put me
[1:12:01] in connection with God who is the one
[1:12:03] who will help me I I think she believed
[1:12:06] that but she wanted that can you put me
[1:12:09] in contact can you can you put us
[1:12:12] together brother Brandon with that
[1:12:15] gift is putting them in connection with
[1:12:18] that gift in his life and
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:24] saying this is you this this one's on
[1:12:27] you this is your nervousness that's
[1:12:29] causing
[1:12:33] this but he doesn't
[1:12:36] lever with it's just your
[1:12:39] fault he gives her the Cure he he takes
[1:12:44] her to me Moses's medicine bag I'm the
[1:12:48] Lord that heals all thy
[1:12:50] diseases and he says the scripture tells
[1:12:53] us think on these things whatsoever what
[1:12:57] whatsoever is pure whatsoever is honest

[1:13:03] let that begin to fill your home let
[1:13:06] that begin to fill your mind and your
[1:13:07] heart and your
[1:13:10] walk and that just that right there is
[1:13:16] enough to take care of nervousness
[1:13:19] [Music]

[1:14:15] this thing away who can heal it I if you
[1:14:20] ever ever dealt with this it's not it'll
[1:14:23] come around again it'll poke it set up
[1:14:25] again it it it it's it wants to raise
[1:14:28] again but God says come let's hold my
[1:14:32] hand let's walk together I've got you
[1:14:35] I've got this under
[1:14:39] control and I
[1:14:41] want I just want whoever would hear this

[1:15:51] brother brandom talks about Divine
[1:15:53] Healing coming through music coming
[1:15:56] through
[1:15:57] love through so many different Avenues
[1:15:59] there being Divine
[1:16:01] Healing so many times it is just a song
[1:16:04] service it's just the worship just
[1:16:06] letting the spirit of God pour over
[1:16:09] you as you're in prayer just God is just
[1:16:12] ministering to your heart and he's
[1:16:14] clearing the Avenues and he's going into
[1:16:15] each of the
[1:16:17] rooms and you're just walking with him
[1:16:21] and maybe there's something you say oh I
[1:16:23] went in this room and I didn't realize

[1:16:54] that that has or that
[1:16:57] will that you'll be able to take them to
[1:17:00] the
[1:17:03] word that you'll be able to just maybe

[1:17:10] that Supernatural to come into their
[1:17:13] life to tell them not you to let God
