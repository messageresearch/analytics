[0:03] it is in a
[0:05] Church age book in the pergamian church
[0:07] age brother Branham takes these
[0:09] scriptures here in Hebrews chapter 6 and
[0:12] since we're on the subject of Divine
[0:14] Healing and um
[0:17] and some of the different things that
[0:18] kind of relate to that and we might
[0:20] think of in terms of what leads up to
[0:22] that and what accomplishes the physical
[0:24] healing or what steps we need to go
[0:26] through in order to receive our healing
[0:27] we've been
[0:29] um kind of a lane a foundation and I
[0:32] think I've got maybe a couple more
[0:33] services on the foundation before we
[0:35] come to some particular subjects and it
[0:38] may very well be that there's several
[0:39] parts on a foundation and just one part
[0:41] on the the actual Divine Healing but
[0:44] it's very a necessary foundation and
[0:46] build up when brother Brown looks at
[0:47] this he mentions how that in these very
[0:50] verses there's an evident manifestation
[0:52] of spiritual gifts that Paul is saying
[0:54] uh there's a demonstration there's a
[0:57] manifestation he says he refers to the
[1:00] same wonderful blessings and the same
[1:02] wonderful manifestations of the spirits
[1:05] or things that brother Branham is
[1:06] looking at and he takes it from the
[1:09] standpoint of these wonderful blessings
[1:11] and these wonderful manifestations of
[1:13] the spirit are no Vindication that the
[1:16] individual is an elect seed it's no
[1:18] Vindication that even the individual is
[1:20] filled or sealed with the Holy Ghost he
[1:22] says but he will admit that anytime you
[1:25] see these kind of wonderful
[1:27] manifestations that it is the Holy
[1:29] Spirit but you can't take it to
[1:31] vindicate alone it's not the sole
[1:33] Vindication of something so he really
[1:35] brings out a lot of depth to it and I'm
[1:38] not going to come back to some of those
[1:39] verses uh verses four through eight
[1:42] today maybe in another time but when
[1:45] he's looking at that he makes the
[1:46] statement that Jesus did not emphasize
[1:49] Works uh stress the importance of works
[1:52] as much as he did the word so you could
[1:54] have wonderful Works wonderful
[1:55] manifestations but that's not the
[1:57] emphasis and so last time we ministered
[2:00] on this subject it was in we were in
[2:02] John chapter six so if you want to turn
[2:03] there to verse 25
[2:06] and I'm realizing now that we had
[2:08] ministered on faith the last time and so
[2:11] I think these things all tie in together
[2:12] but we'll go through John chapter 6
[2:15] verses 25 to 31 a little bit to kind of
[2:18] catch us all up together because I think
[2:19] it was on a Wednesday night that we had
[2:21] preached part five it says and this is
[2:24] after the miracle of uh the
[2:26] multiplication of the bread and the fish
[2:29] and a tremendous Miracle fed five
[2:32] thousand and there were leftovers and
[2:33] there was people that were just stunned
[2:35] at this great ministry and so he's
[2:38] creating quite a following and it says
[2:40] and he was gone he was not at the place
[2:42] anymore where these this miracle
[2:43] transpired so they start seeking them
[2:45] and they cross the they cross the the
[2:47] lake to find them to see and when they'd
[2:49] found him on the other side of the sea
[2:50] they sent him Rabbi when cameth thou
[2:53] hither maybe they're wanting to know
[2:55] more is there another miracle what
[2:57] happened how did you do this Jesus
[2:59] answered them and said verily verily I
[3:01] say unto you ye seek me not because you
[3:04] saw the Miracles but because you did eat
[3:06] the Loaves and were filled very blunt
[3:09] statement that you are seeking me and
[3:11] you want to find me but you're not
[3:12] finding me because the Miracles have had
[3:14] this deep impact on your soul or it's
[3:17] awakened you to prophetic scriptures or
[3:19] you see the Messiah standing before you
[3:21] but you're more interested in eating the
[3:23] bread and being filled so it's only
[3:25] something that satisfies the flesh
[3:27] that's what's drawing you to me right
[3:30] now so he says labor not for the meat
[3:32] which perisheth but for that meat which
[3:35] endureth unto everlasting life so
[3:37] there's something that you can labor for
[3:39] that you can seek after that you could
[3:41] desire to have you could desire to feed
[3:43] on an experience versus just this things
[3:46] that satisfy the flesh he says which the
[3:49] son of man shall give unto you so this
[3:51] is something that the son of man feeds
[3:53] you with
[3:54] for him hath God the Father sealed then
[3:57] said they unto him almost as if it just
[3:59] can wait completely over their head what
[4:01] shall we do that we might work the works
[4:03] of God Jesus answered and said to them
[4:05] this is the work of God bringing him
[4:07] back to this Center this base this is
[4:09] the work of God that you believe on him
[4:11] whom he hath sent so when the word when
[4:14] the Miracles have been manifested you
[4:16] know that there's been a genuine work of
[4:18] God in your life when you believe the
[4:20] word
[4:21] you know there's been a genuine impact
[4:23] of the signs and wonders when it brings
[4:25] you to deeper relationship with God and
[4:27] you become more familiar with his word
[4:29] and his person as opposed to all the
[4:31] different blessings he can pour out on
[4:33] you I think there's a way that
[4:34] Christianity has kind of evolved towards
[4:36] it's just this superficial uh enjoyment
[4:39] of the spirit and the blessings and the
[4:42] riches and all the things he could do
[4:43] for you in this natural life and it's
[4:45] kind of become untethered from the from
[4:47] where God is wanting to lead us as just
[4:50] doing some reading on while we are away
[4:52] and and many times I try to find things
[4:55] that I could read that could just help
[4:57] me to better understand the mind of God
[5:00] and the things that he's trying to do
[5:01] and sometimes I just try to take a look
[5:03] at certain subjects and things and I was
[5:06] reading one particular book and it was
[5:08] kind of on a spiritual awakening in
[5:10] America kind of the a modern day
[5:12] Christian writer and he said that one of
[5:13] the worst things about Christianity is
[5:16] there is there preaching on the rapture
[5:19] and I thought that was interesting and
[5:21] maybe I could just leave that right
[5:22] there but it's there is a there's a way
[5:25] that the whole idea of the Rapture is so
[5:27] ridiculous that it's of no benefit
[5:29] whatsoever at all but you can't take the
[5:31] the afterlife the life to come and The
[5:34] Eternity and remove that from the
[5:36] picture of Christianity because Paul
[5:38] says if we don't have that then we of
[5:40] all people are most miserable
[5:42] and so it has to be in view and he says
[5:45] that this is the work of God that you
[5:46] believe on him whom he hath sent that
[5:48] there's something that goes beyond the
[5:50] Flesh and you're looking to a
[5:51] supernatural you're looking to a time
[5:53] when everything will be consummated in
[5:55] its fullness and you'll forever be with
[5:57] the Lord and they said therefore unto
[5:59] him
[6:00] and maybe this is the part I was
[6:01] thinking that where it's almost as if
[6:03] either they're wanting to troll him or
[6:05] they're just uh not picking it up at all
[6:07] they said what signs show us thou then
[6:09] that we may see and believe thee what
[6:12] does thou work as if what he had done
[6:15] was not enough
[6:16] and and I even think that there's some
[6:18] speculation that they think that he
[6:20] crossed the sea miraculously because
[6:21] they said how did you get here we saw
[6:23] the boats leave we know that you didn't
[6:25] go with them we kind of just tell us a
[6:27] little bit more about how you got here
[6:28] and there's a
[6:31] um
[6:32] there's
[6:33] there's something that's missing they're
[6:36] just not the dots aren't connecting for
[6:38] them and they make the same and our
[6:40] fathers did eat man in the desert as
[6:42] written he gave them bread from Heaven
[6:44] to eat and Jesus continues to say well I
[6:45] am the bread from Heaven I am the true
[6:47] bread of life I am the way the truth of
[6:49] life I eat my flesh and drink my blood
[6:51] that way you can have everlasting life
[6:53] and it just kind of aggravates them more
[6:54] but what I want you to take from this
[6:57] scene is there's Christ The Living Word
[7:00] of God that makes God present The Living
[7:02] Word that's making God present to the
[7:04] people here's the Messiah and we're
[7:06] getting this glimpse of human behavior
[7:08] and we none of us can excuse ourselves
[7:10] from it really because this is just how
[7:12] the carnal mind works to where they're
[7:14] looking more to the Natural seeking the
[7:17] signs Desiring the Miracles and and
[7:20] wanting to receive a benefit In the
[7:23] Flesh fill up their bellies and and have
[7:24] a friend who can always get a
[7:27] food for all of us as long as there's
[7:29] one piece of bread and they're looking
[7:31] to only the things that could benefit
[7:33] the flesh cash and they're missing the
[7:35] point
[7:35] that there has to be a deeper
[7:37] penetration it has to be something
[7:38] that's developing uh saving the soul
[7:41] developing character there's something
[7:43] that they're missing and it says in
[7:45] verse 2 and the great multitude followed
[7:48] him because they saw his miracles which
[7:51] he did on them that were diseased so
[7:53] here is the actual they're following him
[7:56] because of the Miracles they are
[7:58] following because of the signs and it's
[8:00] still not enough what other sign are you
[8:03] gonna do what other Miracle are you
[8:04] going to do and brother Matthew Watkins
[8:06] touched on some of the very scriptures
[8:08] that I want to bring into our view and
[8:10] we'll hold them for another time this is
[8:12] a wicked and adulterous generation
[8:14] seeketh after a sign he says but I'll
[8:16] give you a sign
[8:17] and so there is something uh amiss about
[8:20] seeking signs and always looking for
[8:23] signs there's a signs that we ought to
[8:25] be aware of they're signs that God gives
[8:26] and we want to catch those but there's
[8:28] there's kind of like this Tipping Point
[8:30] as I use that phrase where now all you
[8:33] do is seek signs all you want it gets to
[8:36] a place where now you go wild with it
[8:37] and all you're wanting is The
[8:39] Sensational from a physical standpoint
[8:42] not a supernatural one and so they
[8:44] followed him because of the Miracles
[8:46] and the Miracles were brother Brown says
[8:49] to attract their attention
[8:51] but it's to get their attention it's a
[8:54] sign as brother Brown says I and I as I
[8:56] was with Moses he says it's the sign not
[8:58] the destination when you see the sign
[9:00] you haven't necessarily arrived but it's
[9:02] pointing you to the destiny
[9:04] and so the sign is not the ultimate the
[9:07] manifestation In the Flesh of those
[9:09] works are not the ultimate or the
[9:11] absolute and I'll just read this very
[9:14] quickly I don't have it on the slide he
[9:15] says oh yes they solve the Miracles they
[9:18] saw the word anointed
[9:21] they eat the manna that come from Heaven
[9:23] they enjoyed the blessings of the
[9:25] atonement and this is this is why when
[9:27] they say our father is eight men in the
[9:29] desert brother Adams now
[9:31] amplifying that and it's also applicable
[9:33] to those who stood there in John's sick
[9:35] because they ate bread from the very
[9:37] hand of Christ he says they saw this
[9:39] smitten Rock give us water
[9:41] they drank from it they were personally
[9:43] acquainted with it but when it come to
[9:45] Breaking that word
[9:48] and this is this is what happens in John
[9:50] chapter six and we we use this in John
[9:52] chapter six this is the third pull of
[9:54] the opening of the word and he's showing
[9:56] that when it came to Loaves and fish and
[9:59] those different things they were happy
[10:01] signs wonders wonders Miracles
[10:03] manifestations but then when the word
[10:05] begins to be broken and that begins to
[10:08] be shared then that's where they lock up
[10:09] and they walk away
[10:11] and it's in the sermon go awake Jesus
[10:15] that I think we use this um on that
[10:18] Wednesday night he said he give them
[10:19] some strong Doctrine
[10:21] his healing days were just about over
[10:24] he didn't care wasn't going to heal too
[10:26] much more he was going to tell them
[10:29] about something that was better
[10:31] now healing is good right we can all
[10:33] agree that healing is good and some of
[10:35] us need it and our bodies even right now
[10:37] we're desires of it it's not a bad thing
[10:39] to want to be healed and it's a great
[10:41] thing when God heals you so let's not
[10:43] take Divine Healing in any way and cast
[10:45] it as a bad thing put in a negative
[10:47] light make it that it's not desirable
[10:49] and take the message and twist it to
[10:51] where now we're all believers saying oh
[10:54] healing who cares about that right
[10:56] that's a that would be a perverting of
[10:58] the word but he said he's going to tell
[11:00] them about something that was better
[11:02] this is the breaking of the word
[11:04] something that was better he began to
[11:06] tell him that he he's there he there
[11:09] revealed to them who he actually was
[11:13] so there can be manifestations of his
[11:16] presence and brother Branham talks about
[11:18] Elijah and there he was and there was
[11:20] the earthquake and there was the wind
[11:21] and there was the fire and those were
[11:24] the effects of God passing by but that
[11:28] wasn't the ultimate he wasn't in that he
[11:30] was in The Voice
[11:32] and so he's going to tell him who he
[11:34] actually was so there's things that he
[11:36] could be doing giving you signs but then
[11:39] once the signs get your attention he
[11:41] wants to reveal himself who he actually
[11:43] is in the day that he's living in the
[11:45] day that he's manifesting himself
[11:48] so in this uh another foundational
[11:50] service on Christ my healer and the
[11:52] subject Divine Healing my subtitle is
[11:54] the major and the minor
[11:57] because we want to look more how brother
[11:58] Ram talks about the major and a minor so
[12:00] the major and a minor
[12:03] and Hebrews chapter 6 verses 1 to 3. it
[12:07] says therefore leaving the principles of
[12:08] the doctrines of Christ let us go on
[12:11] into Perfection and it's such a
[12:13] remarkable phrase not laying again the
[12:15] foundation of repentance from dead works
[12:17] and of Faith toward God and of the
[12:19] doctrine of baptisms and on the lane on
[12:21] of hands and of the resurrection of the
[12:23] dead and of Eternal judgment these are
[12:25] all things we believe these are
[12:26] principles of the faith they are part of
[12:28] our faith and our conviction and he says
[12:31] and this will we do if God permit what
[12:33] will we do leave the principles of the
[12:36] doctrine of Christ and go on into
[12:38] Perfection not laying foundations again
[12:41] and it's so it's a very very heavy
[12:43] statement we'll do it if God permits and
[12:46] there's some that take this these very
[12:48] verses where Paul says let's leave the
[12:50] principles of the doctrine of Christ and
[12:52] it it can have a little bit of since
[12:55] we're Believers and we know the
[12:56] scripture maybe it doesn't strike us
[12:58] this way but it could sound as if Paul
[12:59] is saying hey Christ was partial he was
[13:02] incomplete he wasn't perfect so let's
[13:05] leave that and let's go on to something
[13:07] better
[13:08] it's not in that but that's not what
[13:10] he's saying he's saying that there's and
[13:12] we'll maybe try to amplify it here he
[13:15] said let's go first let's go higher
[13:16] let's build on this and so therefore
[13:19] leaving the principles that's the the
[13:21] beginning the commencement of something
[13:22] and he says not laying against the
[13:24] foundation again that's the beginning so
[13:26] the first principles of faith so he's
[13:28] asking thus and he's admonishing the
[13:31] Hebrews and we could have gone into
[13:32] chapter five how he wanted to teach them
[13:34] other things and he felt that he
[13:36] couldn't because they were become they
[13:38] needed milk and not they couldn't handle
[13:39] strong meat so we're talking about the
[13:41] meat of the word of God and opening up
[13:42] he's he's wanting to bring them further
[13:44] into who is this Melchizedek and he
[13:46] can't because they haven't really grown
[13:49] in the things that they've been given
[13:50] they haven't been
[13:51] established they haven't really utilized
[13:54] what they've received and put to put
[13:56] themselves in the position for more
[13:58] and so he's saying let's leave that
[14:00] which is the beginning of the source
[14:01] that which is inherent those things
[14:04] exactly the language he's using to say
[14:06] foundation and principles the first
[14:08] principles as he's wanting to it's
[14:11] something that they were permanently
[14:12] United with
[14:14] but he's asking them to leave so how
[14:15] could you do that
[14:17] because the leaving is not abandoning
[14:20] believing as well we've done that let's
[14:22] move on ah Divine Healing we've done
[14:23] that let's move on the manifestation of
[14:25] this we've done that let's move on but
[14:27] he's he's admonishing the believer in
[14:29] this great these great passages I think
[14:31] four five and six all tied together very
[14:33] well and then chapter seven definitely
[14:36] it's telling the whole story but he said
[14:38] let's not just remain where we begin
[14:40] these are the principles of Faith but
[14:43] he's pointing to the Perfection of faith
[14:45] that we believe in Repentance and we
[14:47] believe in faith towards God and we have
[14:48] the doctrine of baptisms and the laying
[14:51] on of hands and and we understand that
[14:52] there's going to be a resurrection and
[14:54] that there's going to be there's going
[14:55] to be a final judgment and and we
[14:57] understand all these principles and
[14:59] these Basics fundamentals of
[15:01] Christianity but there's more there's
[15:03] something better or greater that these
[15:05] things are all the foundation of and he
[15:06] said let's go on to that
[15:08] and so we cannot ever make the mistake
[15:11] of trying to uproot the foundation dig
[15:13] it up tear it up throw it away and make
[15:16] it as if it's nothing or try to move
[15:18] Beyond it as if we're not built on top
[15:20] of it but we can't just always be laying
[15:23] in it
[15:24] we can't always be working on the
[15:26] foundation laying the foundation laying
[15:27] the foundation but we got to advance
[15:28] higher and Paul's talking about that
[15:31] maturity talking about a perfect faith
[15:33] in the sermon perfect faith brother
[15:35] Branham is this is at the end of the
[15:37] sermon and he says this is coming into
[15:39] that third pool this is after the prayer
[15:41] line
[15:42] uh and he says this is coming out of the
[15:44] third pool and he says I'm working out
[15:46] something
[15:47] he's taking this charge of faith and
[15:49] going right back to begin and come in
[15:51] see to kind of raise faith in the
[15:54] bracket where you've never noticed it
[15:56] that way before
[15:58] and I think it's a very beautiful
[15:59] picture that he he he's preaching on
[16:02] perfect faith and he has a prayer line
[16:04] he's laying hands on the sick and he's
[16:05] and he's letting God manifest himself in
[16:07] a way that they were familiar with at
[16:09] that time but then he kind of is nudging
[16:11] them a little bit and trying to
[16:12] encourage them I want to raise Faith to
[16:14] a place that maybe you've never noticed
[16:16] it that way before not a faith but a
[16:19] perfect Faith built up in here he says
[16:22] and watch a perfect god with the perfect
[16:23] heart keep a perfect Promise by his
[16:25] perfect word
[16:26] we do have today that which is perfect
[16:28] right
[16:29] such a beautiful statement which is
[16:31] sharper than a two-edged sword and a
[16:33] discerner of the thoughts of the heart
[16:34] we're coming now to the perfection
[16:38] God's permitting
[16:40] right when that which is perfect this
[16:41] come he says we do have that today let
[16:44] us go on into Perfection teliotes the
[16:46] perfect one the Perfecter and will do it
[16:48] if God permits and here brother I'm
[16:51] saying we're coming to it now God is
[16:52] finally allowing it to come to the
[16:54] climax of Mount Zion we're coming down
[16:57] to the Perfection because the people
[16:58] have to comment to this in order for the
[17:01] rapture
[17:02] says I want to build you up maybe in a
[17:04] way that you've never been before a
[17:06] bracket that raised to another bracket
[17:07] that we haven't been to before he says
[17:09] this is where we've got to come for the
[17:11] Rapture that's what's holding it away
[17:12] right now is waiting for that church to
[17:15] come into that perfect raptured faith
[17:18] so that's what we need is a perfect
[17:20] raptured faith and there's a great
[17:22] picture that he builds in this entire
[17:23] sermon and so I'm not trying to just to
[17:26] sum it all up but I want you to catch
[17:27] that principle of perfect faith for
[17:30] rapture
[17:31] and what he's wanting to build us to and
[17:34] the things he's using to kind of get us
[17:36] to a position to receive and to believe
[17:38] so that we could take steps further
[17:40] now if you go back to the beginning of
[17:42] the sermon this is a statement he makes
[17:44] it towards the very very beginning he
[17:46] says that's what I'm talking on tonight
[17:47] getting to perfect faith
[17:49] it is not an imagination now there's
[17:52] people have come and say oh I've got all
[17:54] Faith oh sure I have well what are you
[17:57] standing here for then
[17:58] I think there's just some of the most
[18:00] like shocking statements especially
[18:02] considering the prayer line he has an
[18:04] hour later
[18:05] you're very your very actions prove that
[18:07] you haven't got what you're talking
[18:08] about
[18:09] so a lot of it's built upon a person's
[18:11] confession and maybe he's uh implying
[18:15] that the person said well I have perfect
[18:16] Faith I've got all the faith to move
[18:18] mountains and and I can do I can do all
[18:21] these great exploits and I've got faith
[18:23] and here I am standing in prayer line
[18:24] says well maybe you don't have as much
[18:25] Faith as you think you have he says if
[18:28] you had Faith then what you stand in a
[18:30] prayer line for
[18:33] what do you do these things for now it's
[18:36] uh it begs the question begs the
[18:40] question of what is what is he what does
[18:42] he mean because we could read that says
[18:43] well what are you doing in a prayer line
[18:44] but it's not it's not dismissive but
[18:47] it's actually self-examination you have
[18:51] faith in your prayer line what are you
[18:52] in the prayer line for
[18:54] right obviously for more faith right
[18:56] you're doing it because there's a
[18:58] scriptural principle you realize your
[19:00] faith is in a certain level so I've
[19:01] gotta I'm coming through this way and
[19:03] and I'm not I think I have the statement
[19:05] maybe it's in my notes for the next
[19:06] service where brother Branham says I'm
[19:08] getting I want to get you to the place
[19:09] where you can receive your healing
[19:10] without hands being laid on you at all
[19:12] but if that's what you need come forward
[19:14] now for prayer what Grace
[19:16] he's not saying well we've shut the door
[19:18] on laying on the hands that's so
[19:19] old-fashioned and Hokey Pokey and
[19:21] everything no but he's saying I'd like
[19:23] for your faith to get to this place but
[19:24] if it's not there yet God will meet you
[19:26] right here in this
[19:27] and so he's saying if you what do you
[19:29] why are you standing in a prayer line
[19:31] what do you do these things for great
[19:34] question
[19:36] it's not to kind of intimidate us into
[19:38] never doing it but to ask ourselves
[19:40] what's the reason in doing it what am I
[19:42] trying to accomplish so that it can not
[19:44] only be effective in that instance but
[19:47] put me further in my faith once it's
[19:49] happened
[19:50] that I'm approaching this prayer line
[19:52] with the reason in my heart and a belief
[19:54] and a conviction and when I come through
[19:56] that prayer line and God meets my need
[19:58] I'm I'm a step further in my faith and I
[20:01] haven't put my locked myself into a
[20:04] habit to where every time I need
[20:05] something from God I've got to Circle
[20:07] back this time of year this time of the
[20:09] day to come back to the same preachers
[20:11] in a prayer line in order to get what I
[20:13] need but my faith is advanced
[20:16] took us to that hierarchy if I'm not
[20:18] here have your pastor pray for you if
[20:20] your pastor can't pray for you have your
[20:22] neighbor pray for you if your neighbor
[20:23] can't do it have your husband pray for
[20:25] if your spouse can't do it pray your
[20:26] fair yourself
[20:28] so it's like there's this growing and
[20:30] maturing to the place where finally one
[20:31] day you stand there and say I am healed
[20:35] I can petition my father I can come
[20:37] boldly before the throne of grace so he
[20:39] says if you had perfect Faith you'd look
[20:41] right straight to God and believe it and
[20:43] walk away
[20:45] you would have no need of coming into
[20:47] prayer line you'd have no need of these
[20:49] things because your faith has done made
[20:51] it so
[20:53] and if the church is waiting for
[20:54] rapturing faith
[20:56] I I'm realizing now there's just a hole
[20:58] there's a mouthful here
[21:00] if the church is needing to come to
[21:02] rapturing Faith then all these things
[21:04] have to be placed right
[21:06] and used to promote it
[21:09] to promote rapturing faith not to
[21:10] promote itself not this feedback loop
[21:13] where it's always it's just an echo
[21:16] chamber of doing we're doing this and
[21:17] this is what we do we're doing this and
[21:19] this is what we do but it's to build
[21:21] perfect faith
[21:23] you have no need to come in a prayer
[21:24] line once you come to perfect your faith
[21:26] because you wouldn't even have need of
[21:27] these things your faith has made it so
[21:32] now in the sermon sir we would see Jesus
[21:37] says now Divine Healing is not all the
[21:40] message that's a key statement just to
[21:42] hold on to Jesus put I think they
[21:44] claimed about 80 percent of his ministry
[21:46] on Divine Healing but as the late
[21:48] brother Bosworth many of you know
[21:49] brother FF Bosworth The Godly saintly
[21:51] man he used to say that Divine Healing
[21:54] is just like the bait on the hook you
[21:56] never show the fish the hook you show
[21:57] him the bait
[21:59] and So Divine Healing is a minor and you
[22:03] can never major on a minor but it leads
[22:06] to the major that was our title for last
[22:08] time our subtitles the minor leads to
[22:11] the major the minor leading to a major
[22:13] it's something that you recognize then
[22:14] that a Divine Healing is a minor then
[22:17] it's not uh who cares about that but
[22:20] when people are getting divinely healed
[22:22] whether it be through the preaching of
[22:24] the word anointing with oil or laying on
[22:26] of hands or the prayer of faith then
[22:28] that should that be leads people to well
[22:30] who why is there Divine Healing what is
[22:32] it for what does it represent and so
[22:34] that he says the minor where you see
[22:36] these minor things it's for the purpose
[22:38] of leading you to the major
[22:40] and so today
[22:42] what I'm wanting to do with this title
[22:44] even the major and a minor is kind of
[22:47] unpack a little bit what the major is
[22:49] and what what does a major even mean
[22:51] what is the major and what is a minor
[22:52] what does it mean
[22:54] because there are numerous statements
[22:55] and I'm sure you can attest to this
[22:57] numerous statements for brother banham
[22:58] says to this extent you can't major on a
[23:01] minor
[23:02] and he does it in reference to most
[23:05] often to Divine Healing and he says you
[23:09] can't here's Divine Healing he says it's
[23:10] a minor it's a minor it's a minor but
[23:12] you can't major on a minor and he goes
[23:13] to that emphasis so often that it's not
[23:16] just this one statement where he's
[23:17] quoting FF Bosworth and we're kind of
[23:19] like well it's a little bit of an
[23:20] outlier not sure what to do with it but
[23:22] it's just over and over again you can't
[23:24] major on a minor you can't major on a
[23:26] minor so what is a major what do you
[23:28] major on what is a what is what are
[23:31] these other minors maybe you could even
[23:32] ask but he says here very directly and
[23:35] he says it many times Divine Healing is
[23:37] a minor
[23:38] what does that mean it's under the age
[23:39] of 21.
[23:41] no it means that it's not the main thing
[23:45] anyway it says Divine Healing is a minor
[23:47] it's the it's not the it isn't the most
[23:49] important it's not the sole objective
[23:51] Divine Healing isn't the the thrust what
[23:54] we're trying to achieve alone it's not
[23:56] the ultimate that we have church and we
[23:58] have meetings and we preach the gospel
[23:59] and we do all these things so that we
[24:01] can just have a um a mechanism of
[24:03] healing our bodies
[24:05] and so that's what brother Bradham is I
[24:08] believe his emphasis is when he says
[24:11] Divine Healing is a minor he said it's
[24:13] not the main thing
[24:14] but although it's not the main thing or
[24:16] it's not the absolute or the ultimate it
[24:19] complements and supports the main thing
[24:22] so you have you have a you have the
[24:25] major there or there's something that
[24:27] you're to Major on and we'll get into
[24:28] some of these statements here in a
[24:30] moment that this is what I want to Major
[24:32] on and Divine Healing is a minor so I'm
[24:34] going to Major on this and I'm I'm going
[24:37] to minor on this but the minor he says
[24:39] leads to the major
[24:42] so if if he goes into this area of well
[24:45] why would you even spend any time in the
[24:47] minor that's because you've got to meet
[24:49] people in a certain way to get their
[24:50] attention and build them up
[24:52] build them up to a place where now they
[24:55] can be they can come to and be led to
[24:57] the main thing
[24:59] and so you have to start where people
[25:01] are you have to start with the center
[25:02] you have to start with them and the fact
[25:04] that they're a sinner and that you have
[25:05] to start in certain ways to build
[25:07] attention and to build a maybe a poor
[25:09] choice of words but to build their
[25:11] rapport with Christ and with the word
[25:14] and so it's not it may not be the main
[25:17] thing but it complements the main thing
[25:19] it supports the main thing
[25:21] the sermon sir we would see Jesus this
[25:23] is not the same sermon we just quoted
[25:25] from a different instance a few years
[25:27] prior he says last meeting kindly
[25:29] speaking to you on salvation on us on
[25:31] salvation plan
[25:32] and I want this to be clearly known
[25:36] that Divine Healing is not a major plan
[25:38] of God
[25:40] that's a it doesn't make this statement
[25:43] I I don't know that he makes this exact
[25:45] statement anywhere else but he says it's
[25:47] not a major plan of God Divine Hill is
[25:49] not a major plan of God and we can never
[25:51] major on a minor So Divine Healing is
[25:53] not the major plan of God it's not God's
[25:56] sole emphasis it's not what God is
[25:57] present trying to do alone he says
[25:59] because it's not his major plan I can't
[26:02] major on something that is his minor
[26:04] plan he says but Divine Healing is
[26:06] included in the Plan of Salvation for
[26:09] God
[26:09] and from that statement alone you could
[26:11] gather that he is identifying the major
[26:13] plan of God relates to Salvation
[26:16] and he's saying is that Divine Healing
[26:18] though then is included in the Plan of
[26:20] Salvation but the main thing is
[26:22] salvation
[26:25] Divine Healing is not a major plan
[26:27] and so if Divine Healing is a minor then
[26:31] what is the major
[26:33] and in many contexts as we've just read
[26:35] here salvation was the major
[26:38] in Matthew chapter 10 verse 28 it says
[26:40] fear not them which kill the body but
[26:41] are not able to kill the soul
[26:45] but rather fear him which is able to
[26:47] destroy both soul and Body in hell
[26:49] so man can make the body sick man can
[26:52] hurt the body man can harm the body man
[26:53] can do it he is able to do to try to
[26:56] repair or promote healing and address
[26:57] certain infections or breaks or whatever
[26:59] it might be in the body and so man can
[27:02] do things to the body but God is able to
[27:04] destroy the soul he's able to save the
[27:06] soul he's able to make a body sick he's
[27:08] also able to heal the body and he says
[27:11] you should fear God who's able to
[27:12] destroy the soul and Body in hell
[27:15] so there's something about the flesh
[27:17] that we all like the flesh we love the
[27:19] flesh we're only here because we are
[27:20] flesh but he says we ought not to only
[27:23] be enamored with the things that relate
[27:25] to the flesh or fear the things that can
[27:27] harm the flesh or be all worried about
[27:29] what's taking place in the flesh but
[27:31] fear God who's able to destroy the soul
[27:33] and the body along with it in hell
[27:38] and so it's the soul that is the most
[27:39] important thing
[27:41] it's the main thing the salvation of the
[27:42] Soul Brother Batman and sir we would see
[27:44] Jesus again this is a different one than
[27:46] the other two that we've already quoted
[27:48] quoted from 63 and 60 now 61 and the
[27:51] main part of my service is based of
[27:53] course upon salvation
[27:55] Divine Healing is a minor and no one can
[27:58] never major with a minor no one can
[28:00] never
[28:01] and no one can never major with a minor
[28:05] though some try I guess they just can't
[28:06] do it
[28:08] but he's saying that there's the main
[28:09] part of a service is based upon
[28:11] salvation he says of course
[28:13] and then because the
[28:15] expectations of the people
[28:18] he's saying now Divine Healing is a
[28:20] minor
[28:21] and we can't major on that the main part
[28:23] is salvation in the sermon Jesus Christ
[28:26] the same yesterday today and forever he
[28:27] says now we talk about Divine Healing
[28:29] mostly in my meetings but Divine Healing
[28:31] is not what we try to Major with you can
[28:34] never major on a minor Divine Healing is
[28:37] just a gift to present Christ
[28:39] now that no way belittles it
[28:42] Divine Healing is a gift that presents
[28:44] Christ it's a precious thing it's a
[28:46] wonderful thing it's a supernatural
[28:48] thing it's called Divine Healing right
[28:50] not mediocre healing not Humane healing
[28:54] Divine Healing some God does it's a
[28:57] miracle
[28:58] let's not ever put it in a negative
[29:00] light never take any promise of God
[29:02] making fun of anointing with oil making
[29:04] fun of speaking with tongues never make
[29:06] fun of anything you shouldn't just make
[29:08] fun of anybody but why would we take
[29:10] things in the word of God and ridicule
[29:11] it
[29:13] and be so careful the attitudes we can
[29:16] take sometimes towards things
[29:19] Divine Healing is a gift to present
[29:20] Christ Divine Healing to catch the
[29:23] people's attention to let them know that
[29:24] Jesus loves them
[29:26] and the main thing that we are after is
[29:29] the healing of the human soul
[29:32] that men that are born again have
[29:34] eternal life and shall never perish but
[29:35] be raised up again at the last day
[29:37] that's the objective is to be born again
[29:39] which is to seal your soul with the Holy
[29:41] Ghost guaranteeing you a resurrection
[29:44] guaranteeing you that if you alive and
[29:46] remain at the time of the translation
[29:47] you will be changed
[29:50] that's the emphasis the main thing that
[29:52] we're after is the the salvation of the
[29:54] human soul the healing he says of the
[29:56] human soul
[29:58] the sermon hear ye him he says tonight
[30:00] was an Evangelistic call
[30:03] friends Divine Healing is just a minor
[30:05] you can never major on a minor as I said
[30:07] salvation of the soul is much greater
[30:10] than Divine Healing
[30:12] salvation of the soul is much greater it
[30:14] says in one place salvation is the main
[30:16] thing to the soul Divine Healing is just
[30:18] a minor thing
[30:20] this is an emphasis you find quite often
[30:23] where brother Branham refers to the
[30:25] major and the minor and he's saying that
[30:26] in my meetings and you have to realize I
[30:28] didn't write down the locations but this
[30:30] is from 61 and 56 and 58 and 60 and all
[30:34] these different places 63 just through
[30:37] his entire Ministry spanning decades
[30:39] where he's saying oh this is a mate
[30:40] minor this uh you know the the maybe not
[30:43] decades but in the years that we cover
[30:45] he's saying this is the main emphasis in
[30:48] his meetings and he's saying that here
[30:49] in Phoenix he's saying it in Maine he's
[30:51] saying it overseas he's saying it all
[30:52] over and he's saying it in many
[30:54] different places because he's coming
[30:56] presenting Christ preaching Christ in
[30:59] these Evangelistic services in these
[31:01] healing campaigns and in these Services
[31:03] where people are coming and being drawn
[31:05] to his ministry in the same way that
[31:07] they were to Christ
[31:09] and so when brother man makes these
[31:11] statements over and over and over again
[31:12] about the major and the minor he is in
[31:14] these Evangelistic settings and then
[31:17] from the uh if I could say an
[31:18] Evangelistic service and even from these
[31:20] special meeting standpoints he's saying
[31:22] I don't major on healing but I major on
[31:24] salvation
[31:26] I'm here and I'm only here for the
[31:27] weekend and I don't want to just
[31:28] emphasize healing I want to emphasize
[31:30] salvation because you could be healed
[31:32] and that'll be temporary but if your
[31:34] soul can be saved that would be
[31:35] permanent so as he comes through and he
[31:37] holds multiple night meetings and he
[31:38] preaches the sermon he says if I can
[31:40] this is me just kind of putting in my
[31:42] own words if I can lead you to Christ to
[31:44] have the soul sealed by the new birth
[31:46] then you are now sealed and baptized in
[31:49] the body of Christ a permanent member of
[31:51] something Eternal and if you died with
[31:54] cancer you're coming up in the
[31:55] resurrection
[31:57] yeah and that's the was the main thing
[31:59] in that setting and that from that
[32:01] standpoint he wasn't majoring on healing
[32:03] but Salvation he says this is this was
[32:05] in the when he has an evangelist at
[32:07] College he's coming through as an
[32:08] evangelist
[32:09] now in second Timothy Chapter 4 verses
[32:11] three to five
[32:13] I'm using this scripture because we
[32:15] realize brother Branham this scripture
[32:16] is very precious to him he mentions how
[32:19] that when the day that he built the
[32:20] Tabernacle and he laid the Cornerstone
[32:22] he wrote he wrote this dude the work of
[32:24] an evangelist make full proof of your
[32:26] ministry the things that were contained
[32:28] therein something very precious to
[32:30] brother Branham
[32:31] and this is the where this the that what
[32:35] he was told to write down and put in
[32:36] that Cornerstone it comes from the
[32:37] second Timothy chapter four
[32:40] verses three to five it says for the
[32:42] time will come when they will not endure
[32:43] sound Doctrine
[32:44] that's what happened when they could
[32:46] endure all the bread and all the fish
[32:47] right but now when it came to the
[32:51] opening of the word breaking that word
[32:53] they couldn't endure it
[32:55] he says but after their own lust shall
[32:57] they sheep Heap to themselves teachers
[32:59] having itching ears
[33:01] and they shall turn away their ears from
[33:03] the truth and shall be turned unto
[33:05] Fables
[33:07] what an indictment but watch thou and
[33:10] all things endure afflictions this is
[33:13] Paul to Timothy do the work and
[33:15] evangelist make full proof of your
[33:16] ministry
[33:18] now we mentioned a moment ago brother
[33:19] says now Divine Healing is not all the
[33:21] message
[33:22] evangelism was not all brother brahm's
[33:24] Ministry
[33:26] that wasn't his calling brother
[33:28] branham's calling he was ordained a
[33:30] prophet
[33:32] he's he's Anointed with the spirit of
[33:33] Elijah according to Malachi 4 5. there's
[33:35] other scriptures we could bring into
[33:37] that view and but that's the basis
[33:39] that's the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 is
[33:43] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[33:45] this is his ministry it wasn't just an
[33:47] evangelist he wasn't just a Healer he
[33:49] wasn't just a good man but he's actually
[33:51] called he's a fulfilling prophecy he's a
[33:54] prophet sent in the last days and so he
[33:57] was doing the work of an evangelist out
[33:59] there on the field emphasizing salvation
[34:02] lifting up these certain things and
[34:04] presenting to them Divine Healing is a
[34:06] minor to let them recognize that Christ
[34:08] loves them but that's not his ministry
[34:11] that wasn't all he was called to do is
[34:13] to heal the sick and preach the gospel
[34:15] he just as every Minister had is called
[34:18] and we are all called to go into all the
[34:19] world and preach the gospel we all come
[34:21] under that ordination we all come under
[34:23] that commission he had that commission
[34:25] plus the commission of a prophet
[34:28] a scriptural commission revealing the
[34:30] son of man in the church-aged messenger
[34:32] and a uh an angel voice these things are
[34:36] tied to his ministry so what I want you
[34:38] to catch now is he had an emphasis out
[34:41] in the Evangelistic field but what about
[34:42] as a prophet
[34:44] I spoke words the original seat he says
[34:46] when I built this Tabernacle the day I
[34:47] laid the Cornerstone out here I remember
[34:48] that Vision that morning got it wrote
[34:50] there in the Cornerstone said this is
[34:52] not your Tabernacle do the work of
[34:54] evangelists make full proof of your
[34:55] ministry he says I love it I love God's
[34:58] children everywhere I don't know where
[34:59] he's going to lead me I don't know I'm
[35:01] waiting this is 1962 through 60 um two
[35:04] in March exactly one year later he's
[35:06] going to preach the first seal exactly
[35:08] one year later he says I love God's
[35:10] children everywhere I don't know where
[35:12] he's going to lead me I don't know I'm
[35:13] waiting I've been waiting for a year may
[35:15] wait for two years I may wait for three
[35:17] I don't know I don't know the next move
[35:19] but I'm waiting for it
[35:21] could he even feel like a Paul I want to
[35:23] do this if God will permit there's got
[35:25] to be something to take a step further
[35:26] but I think according to scripture the
[35:28] word has been sowed the next thing is
[35:31] the coming forth of the spirit
[35:34] so he's looking at something to come to
[35:37] bring something to life
[35:38] I've been laying in these Evangelistic
[35:40] Services I've been preaching these
[35:41] things I mean even in a way at this time
[35:43] as a church age messenger he's calling
[35:45] people back to repentance calling them
[35:46] back to the message of the Pentecost and
[35:49] the restoration of the gifts
[35:50] demonstrating signs wonders and miracles
[35:52] and and sending millions or thousands to
[35:55] the Pentecostal church and he's out
[35:57] there he says but something needs to
[35:58] come forth recognize that to be a
[36:01] language that he uses quite often later
[36:02] on in the year and then at the time the
[36:04] seals are opened he says Billy Graham
[36:06] May preach everywhere Oral Roberts them
[36:09] Godly men may preach everywhere
[36:11] and those names become prominent in a
[36:14] certain vein of quotes I was Finding
[36:15] here recently and it just kept standing
[36:17] out as this theme he refers to Billy
[36:19] Graham Oral Roberts they may preach
[36:20] everywhere the Lord may send me to sow
[36:22] seed somewhere else some field
[36:25] he says they they may continue in these
[36:27] great big campaigns but I've got a
[36:29] specific calling
[36:31] and I may be called to do something very
[36:32] specific
[36:35] now in 1965 modern events made clear by
[36:38] prophecy this is at the very end of his
[36:40] ministry he says remember this message
[36:41] started first with Divine Healing
[36:43] performing miracles
[36:45] now if God let that go through an
[36:47] ordinary church just like we already had
[36:48] then it wasn't God
[36:50] don't have to show off
[36:53] you don't have to do these things to
[36:54] entertain us like we Americans are used
[36:56] to entertainment
[36:57] but he does it to attract the attention
[36:59] of the people that he's fixing to do
[37:02] something
[37:04] this is the anticipation he was under in
[37:06] the spoken words the original seed that
[37:08] something's going to happen I've been
[37:09] told to do the work in evangelist I've
[37:11] done it all these years for 15 years
[37:13] I've been doing it or for longer we
[37:14] could say almost 30 years I've been
[37:15] doing this work on evangelist I've been
[37:17] doing this but I know there's something
[37:19] more this isn't my full call and this
[37:21] isn't all I've been commissioned to do
[37:23] and he says here as he comes back to
[37:26] this the mess the message started out
[37:28] with Divine Healing and Performing
[37:29] miracles but that was only to attract
[37:32] the attention because he was fixing to
[37:33] do something
[37:35] stand in the Gap you remember on the
[37:37] tape sirs what time it is is it I'll
[37:39] quote it over and this is his quote
[37:41] remember something is fixing to take
[37:43] place major
[37:47] something is fixing to take place major
[37:50] I don't believe he says major it and
[37:52] serves is this the time but as he goes
[37:54] back and he says let me just quote it
[37:55] for you sirs what time is it this was
[37:58] the question or this is the statement
[38:00] something major is about to happen
[38:04] something major we've had Divine
[38:06] healings we've had signs wonders
[38:07] Miracles there has been the
[38:08] manifestation of the spirit give signs
[38:10] wonders healings and miracles through
[38:12] the entire church age
[38:14] it was always in the church
[38:17] it's always in the lives of the
[38:19] Believers but something major is about
[38:21] to happen
[38:22] he says now it's made the whole nation
[38:24] testify to it he's talking about the
[38:25] picture
[38:26] every newspaper in this on the
[38:28] Associated Press and one of our leading
[38:29] magazines in life he's referring to in
[38:30] everything else testifying about him
[38:34] not like this and it ain't all over yet
[38:37] because here we are
[38:39] right testifying about him
[38:41] it ain't all over yet there's a sermon
[38:43] title
[38:45] something major is about to happen is
[38:48] what he's saying and here we are he's
[38:50] leading to this now in the sermon the
[38:51] Rapture but kind of catch the theme Here
[38:53] the message started with Divine Healing
[38:55] performing Miracles but something
[38:56] Major's got to happen Divine Healing
[38:58] minor Miracles all these things are
[39:00] minor but something major has to happen
[39:02] in the Rapture when I went forth into
[39:04] the meetings with you praying for the
[39:06] sick it was fine
[39:07] but when I come with the message and
[39:09] there's there's a a sharp rebuke here in
[39:12] Yuma there he's he's being very honest
[39:15] and very open about the fact that they
[39:17] loved him when he was performing
[39:18] Miracles but when he began to preach
[39:19] that's when they begin to turn away from
[39:21] but when I come with the message it says
[39:23] if any message Goes Forth it's a true
[39:24] message if it's the true genuine
[39:26] miracles of god if it's the true genuine
[39:28] miracles of god and hangs right into
[39:30] that organization you know it's not of
[39:31] God because that thing is already
[39:33] declared something like that if
[39:35] something signs wonders and
[39:37] manifestations and miracles that's only
[39:38] God can do the Miracles but if that
[39:40] person is trying to lead you in an
[39:42] organization hold back to a former light
[39:44] trying to drag you back into a former
[39:45] life he says then that's not God
[39:48] God's not manifesting those things to
[39:50] get your attention God's not manifesting
[39:53] that as a way of a signpost that's just
[39:55] the rain from Hebrews 6 fallen on the
[39:57] just and the unjust that's the rain
[39:59] blessing all the seeds
[40:01] he says
[40:05] Jesus went forth and healed the sick in
[40:07] order to catch their eyes the people
[40:09] then his message this isn't the pattern
[40:11] of John 6. that's right it has to have
[40:13] something that God is going to introduce
[40:15] Divine so that there's the God wants to
[40:18] introduce something after the tongues
[40:20] there's an interpretation after the
[40:22] Divine Healing there's an introduction
[40:23] Divine Healing his miracles like that
[40:25] just catch the eyes of the people the
[40:27] main heart of it is the message
[40:30] that's where what comes from here he's
[40:33] trying to get the favor of the people so
[40:35] they'll sit and listen to him for
[40:38] there's some in there that's ordained
[40:39] alive some of the grain remember he said
[40:41] I may go out and and sow seeds somewhere
[40:43] else in the field he says some of the
[40:44] grain wheat fell on the ground Birds
[40:46] picked it up others fell among thorns
[40:48] and some was went on prepared ground
[40:50] pre-prepared ground improp forth
[40:55] what's the pattern signs wonders and
[40:58] miracles when I was praying for the sick
[40:59] do you all love me but then when I went
[41:00] into that message to catch the elect you
[41:03] all didn't like that but he says the
[41:04] main that's a minor but the main thing
[41:06] is the message
[41:08] catch this emphasis now when he's out
[41:10] there in the Evangelistic field the main
[41:12] thing was salvation and the the signs
[41:16] and wonders were to catch the people's
[41:17] attention to receive Christ and be saved
[41:19] this is according to the commission this
[41:21] is what we all would our lives would
[41:23] come under that commission and all
[41:24] Ministry operates in that but now we're
[41:27] looking at a prophetic office
[41:30] recognizing that in my minis I prayed
[41:32] for the sick I went out performing these
[41:34] things the message started with
[41:35] performing Miracles and Divine Healing
[41:37] Jesus went forth and healed the sick
[41:38] what to catch the people's attention
[41:40] because there was a message to follow
[41:43] we read this statement recently in the
[41:45] sermon leadership and so now we've
[41:47] quoted from uh
[41:50] uh the um December 4th December 6th now
[41:54] even December 7th leadership in that
[41:56] time period he's summing all these
[41:58] things up for the people when a Divine
[42:00] Healing went forth not long ago did you
[42:01] notice how the impersonation
[42:02] impersonators follow it followed it and
[42:05] every one of them went right into them
[42:07] organizations staying there
[42:09] so there's a impersonation Tommy Osborne
[42:11] I can do that there's certain things
[42:13] that people can uh people can activate
[42:15] Faith they can preach the gospel to
[42:17] activate people's faith for that healing
[42:19] for that instant for that moment
[42:22] brother bam talks about Divine Healing
[42:24] and I've had the quote to share with you
[42:25] I'm just not sure what context it may
[42:28] fit in but brother Ram's talk refers to
[42:30] Divine says and here the Beatles are
[42:31] doing it
[42:35] he says every one of them went into
[42:36] organization stand right there does
[42:37] anyone know that there had to be a
[42:39] message follow that
[42:41] why God don't entertain us he attracts
[42:44] our attention with something and when he
[42:46] attracts our attention then he's got his
[42:49] message
[42:52] there's a message that follows the
[42:54] Vindication there's a message that
[42:55] follows the signs and wonders and he's
[42:56] kind of given us these keys that if
[42:58] there's something if there's a move of
[42:59] God a manifestation of the spirit if you
[43:01] want to know if there's a message to
[43:03] follow listen for it
[43:04] and if it lines up with the word of God
[43:06] then you can say this is this is how God
[43:08] worked to catch that seed to go out in
[43:10] this field and begin to sow things in
[43:12] this field to get my attention but he's
[43:14] saying that God just doesn't do these
[43:16] miracles to entertain us he's got a
[43:18] message so he wants to get our attention
[43:21] and the sermon God doesn't call man unto
[43:23] judgment without first warning him and I
[43:24] want to hurry I don't want to be lengthy
[43:26] today but I still have a lot I want to
[43:29] get to this is a very important lengthy
[43:31] statement please Focus now and then God
[43:33] confirms that message that Billy Graham
[43:36] preaches I had to cut some of this out
[43:37] but remember what he said earlier when
[43:40] he's talking about well I I feel that
[43:41] I'm
[43:42] the something's gonna happen he says oh
[43:46] Robert we'll preach everywhere Billy
[43:47] Graham will preach everywhere but the
[43:49] Lord may call me to do something
[43:50] specific
[43:51] and listen to how he says this now and
[43:53] then God confirms that message that
[43:54] Billy Graham preaches God heals the Sick
[43:57] by Oral Robert's prayers God's doing it
[44:00] and God produces the things that Jesus
[44:03] proves that Jesus Christ is the same
[44:05] yesterday today and forever
[44:06] and it's calling those things that
[44:09] it's messages of the hour
[44:14] I think of that we call the message of
[44:16] yeah the message of the hour but there's
[44:17] messages of the hour
[44:20] and each one of those messages is
[44:22] calling repent or perish that's right
[44:24] repent or perish there's no hopes it's
[44:26] all gone world's warned of his coming
[44:29] each one of the messages speaks and
[44:31] warns of the coming of Lord Jesus both
[44:33] to the church denominal
[44:37] those messages
[44:39] speak in warns of the coming of the Lord
[44:41] are you saying Oral Roberts Billy Graham
[44:43] follow him into his language I think
[44:45] that's very easy to follow but please
[44:46] Focus but he says remember God is always
[44:49] in threes he talked about Oral Roberts
[44:51] and Billy Graham and their message
[44:52] warning about the coming Lord like
[44:54] Father Son and Holy Ghost justification
[44:56] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost so
[44:57] forth he's in threes now God is that
[45:01] message of repentance to the church
[45:03] nominal this is good listen that was me
[45:07] you're if you're streaming the podcast
[45:09] God's in that message of Divine Healing
[45:12] to the church Pentecostal
[45:14] God's in it God in the message to the
[45:17] bride
[45:19] God's in the message of repentance God's
[45:21] in the message Divine Healing but God's
[45:23] in the message to the bride so let's not
[45:26] belittle anything speak out against
[45:28] anything just recognize your message in
[45:31] your day
[45:32] walk fully in it God's in the message to
[45:35] the bride so we find out that all them
[45:37] calling one to this this to that that to
[45:39] that God calling the church out of the
[45:41] world calling the church in the
[45:43] denominal church into Pentecost and call
[45:46] on the bride out of Pentecost
[45:48] these there's a gathering together
[45:50] Binding Together the the the the the the
[45:52] election to these different parts but
[45:55] God is calling the bride out of
[45:57] Pentecost
[45:58] you have repentance you have Divine
[46:00] Healing while we walk through that even
[46:01] in our own calling but we want to come
[46:03] to the message for me as the elect of
[46:07] God the bride Luther Wesley and now
[46:10] it's just all perfectly typed up and
[46:12] there's no mistake about it
[46:15] catch this verbage he uses I've hit all
[46:17] around the ends of it and sides of it
[46:19] and inside and outside of it and showed
[46:21] it by the scripture the chronology of it
[46:23] till we know that it's absolutely the
[46:25] truth there's no mistake
[46:30] July 24 1963 saying this
[46:33] Sunday I hope
[46:38] Sunday I hope that God sinks it so deep
[46:40] not some day but Sunday
[46:43] I hope that God sinks it so deep that
[46:45] you'll never be able to get away from it
[46:47] I like that
[46:49] that's wonderful here he is preaching on
[46:50] Wednesday
[46:52] July 24th 1963 it's a Wednesday night
[46:54] and he's kind of getting him ready for
[46:56] Sunday
[46:57] and this profound statement that there's
[46:59] a message of repentance to a nominal
[47:01] Church there's a message of Divine
[47:03] Healing to the Pentecostals that's their
[47:05] emphasis they major on that minor that's
[47:07] their thrust that's what it's all about
[47:08] he says but then there's a message to
[47:10] the bride
[47:12] he says I've hit on the outside I've
[47:14] done everything I possibly can to show
[47:16] you that it's absolutely the truth but
[47:18] summon Sunday this coming Sunday in just
[47:20] a few days I hope that God sinks it so
[47:22] deep you'll never get away from it
[47:25] anybody know what he preached Sunday
[47:26] morning July 28 1963
[47:28] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[47:33] that profound sermon
[47:37] that is the opener that the silence is
[47:39] even being lifted now of that seventh
[47:41] seal and he's bringing it and how he
[47:42] labors in that and you're going to open
[47:44] up the thoughts of God's mind and bring
[47:47] into view Christ and his bride to bring
[47:49] them together and he's saying I've we've
[47:52] looked at Billy Robert uh Billy Graham
[47:54] and Oral Roberts for time's sake I'll
[47:56] just start calling him Bobby Bob and Rob
[47:58] or Billy and Rob or whatever bobert's
[48:00] whatever I was going to say
[48:03] they're out there preaching repentance
[48:05] and Divine Healing repentance and Divine
[48:07] Healing repent repairs warning people
[48:09] about the coming of the Lord but brother
[48:11] Ram says this is two years earlier maybe
[48:13] God is calling me to do something else
[48:15] I'm probably going to pull away from all
[48:16] that and I've got to come to something
[48:17] very very specific and what I want you
[48:19] to begin to recognize is now from a
[48:22] prophetic standpoint he is not majoring
[48:25] on salvation alone as an evangelist out
[48:29] in the field he used the minor to get
[48:31] people's attention to come to salvation
[48:33] but that's the general commission we're
[48:35] all under as Ministers of God and as
[48:37] Believers but as a prophet he had a
[48:40] different commission he had a commission
[48:42] to be out now out west he had a
[48:44] commission for these seals to be opened
[48:46] up he has a commission to reveal the son
[48:48] of man and so from a prophetic
[48:50] standpoint Christ is the major
[48:55] he's the major prophet he says
[48:58] Christ is the major the major is the
[49:00] word
[49:02] that's what he wanted to sink so deep
[49:03] that you'll never be able to get away
[49:05] from it
[49:07] and preaches Christ the mystery God
[49:08] revealed and bringing it all down
[49:10] beautiful sermon to emphasize Christ is
[49:13] the main thing
[49:15] let him have preeminence
[49:16] it's all about Christ that's what the
[49:18] new birth is the revelation of Jesus
[49:20] Christ personally to you that's what
[49:21] this whole thing is building up to
[49:22] Christ God revealed in those three
[49:25] different aspects the fullness of God in
[49:27] Christ to reveal himself to his son then
[49:29] have preeminence in his bride to take
[49:32] bride and bridegroom back to the
[49:34] beginning again
[49:36] that's the emphasis that's the goal
[49:38] that's what you major on you don't can't
[49:41] major on a minor it's not all about
[49:42] prayer lines it's not all about healings
[49:44] it's not even all about the altar but
[49:46] let's use all these things that bring
[49:48] Salvation that bring healing let it all
[49:50] accumulate together in our hearts so
[49:52] that Christ can be the major
[49:54] [Applause]
[49:58] is the word
[50:00] now in Hebrews chapter 6 verses 1 to 3
[50:03] and then I'll read verse 9 but I'm just
[50:04] going to cherry pick therefore leaving
[50:05] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[50:07] let us go on to perfection
[50:09] telio takes the perfect one Christ
[50:13] not Perfection necessary as a state but
[50:15] a perfect ore not just the author but
[50:18] the finisher not a foundation but a
[50:20] Capstone
[50:21] come on somebody
[50:24] and this will do of God permit
[50:26] the holding back
[50:28] but there will come a time when the
[50:30] delay is over
[50:31] time is no more the delay God is
[50:33] permitted
[50:34] and so then Paul when he goes through
[50:36] this
[50:37] manifestations brother man talks about
[50:39] these manifestations of spiritual gifts
[50:41] wonderful blessings wonderful
[50:42] manifestations through these rain fallen
[50:45] on the the just and the unjust and the
[50:46] Briars and thorns and everyone rejoicing
[50:48] and the power of God pouring on everyone
[50:50] then he says but beloved and these very
[50:53] ones who had the spirit of God move in
[50:55] their hearts and do many wonderful works
[50:56] and lay hands on the sick and they
[50:58] recover and cast out demons and then
[51:00] stand before Christ he says I never knew
[51:02] you
[51:03] you were ultimately you worked iniquity
[51:07] there was no election there was no
[51:09] destination there was no it hadn't it
[51:12] hadn't been effective in them like it
[51:14] should be in the elect because Paul says
[51:15] I'm persuaded
[51:17] beloved we're persuaded better things of
[51:19] you
[51:20] better more
[51:22] as Jesus was saying I want to show you
[51:24] and begin to tell them about something
[51:26] that was better I'm not just I'm
[51:28] persuaded better things of you than just
[51:29] the doctrines of baptism delaying on of
[51:31] hands and all the things that be the
[51:33] first principles of our foundation he
[51:35] says I'm persuaded better things of you
[51:37] that you wouldn't just have the spirit
[51:39] of God pray on your flesh and then you
[51:40] would just be condemned ultimate and
[51:42] judgment and things that accompany
[51:44] salvation though we thus speak
[51:48] there's a mouthful in that things that
[51:50] accompany salvation think of the
[51:51] Perfection the maturity the
[51:54] strengthening of the Inner Man Paul with
[51:56] all the manifestations that he had he
[51:58] was still striving to attain to
[52:01] apprehend
[52:03] it's a perfect faith things that
[52:05] accompany salvation remember the two
[52:06] parts to Redemption out of and in two
[52:08] there's got to be a climax there's got
[52:10] to be a finality there's got to be a
[52:11] summation of things
[52:13] and the sermon of paradox
[52:16] this is in Tampa this is a brother a
[52:18] minister Full Gospel businessman's
[52:20] breakfast he says the church has become
[52:23] just growing up
[52:25] he says just like I was going to speak
[52:26] tonight upon the unveiling of the one
[52:29] true God but I think it take a little
[52:31] too long this is what's in his heart
[52:33] though
[52:34] the unveiling of God and preach the
[52:36] Mighty God unveiled the unveiling God he
[52:37] preaches in Philadelphia that summer he
[52:39] preached it in Jeffersonville this was
[52:41] on his heart but he's thinking in this
[52:42] these meetings I think maybe it'll just
[52:43] be too long I noticed the people after
[52:45] about nine o'clock they get Restless
[52:48] I thought I would just wait till
[52:49] sometime at the Tabernacle I got
[52:51] something else on my mind maybe for
[52:53] tonight to bring a message of salvation
[52:55] that's what we're trying to do here you
[52:57] Minister Brothers he says now you
[52:58] Minister Brothers we missed Divine
[53:00] Healing
[53:02] I just was really pressing to catch what
[53:06] he meant by that
[53:08] but then when he goes to immediately
[53:09] this is where my this is where my heart
[53:11] is being pulled he says we missed Divine
[53:13] Healing not that we didn't have it
[53:16] you sought me
[53:17] not because you saw the Miracles but
[53:20] because you ate bread and were filled
[53:22] and he says we missed Divine Healing no
[53:25] we had it we saw it but did we get it
[53:29] as old Dr Bosworth who just went home to
[53:31] Glory down here recently he said he used
[53:33] to say Divine Healing is a bait that you
[53:34] put on the hook you never show the fish
[53:37] the hook you show him the bait he hits
[53:39] the bait and gets the hook so that's the
[53:41] way it is Divine Healing just draws the
[53:44] attention
[53:45] and then salvation is what we are after
[53:48] and I believe these are the words of the
[53:50] Prophet we are after the strength of the
[53:53] body of Christ
[53:56] but not as an evangelist
[53:58] when he says this in 1964 this April 18
[54:01] 1964. he's not saying it as an
[54:03] evangelist but he's saying it as a
[54:05] prophet he was after the strength of the
[54:07] body of Christ
[54:09] and he makes a statement just prior to
[54:10] this and just after this he says now
[54:12] Christ coming to his body Christ coming
[54:15] to his body this was what was in his
[54:17] mind when he's preaching the unveiling
[54:18] of the one true God God behind your
[54:21] skins when God gets in your flesh Christ
[54:23] is the mystery of God revealed and when
[54:26] Christ is revealed in you and he's
[54:29] saying Christ coming to his body this is
[54:32] not an evangelist this is not a teacher
[54:35] this is not an apostle or a pastor this
[54:38] is the prophet of the age as John
[54:41] introduced Christ and he's the only one
[54:43] that knew Behold the Lamb of God that
[54:45] takes away the sins of the world he's
[54:47] saying Christ come into his body Christ
[54:50] come into his body what I am after is
[54:53] the strength of the body of Christ who
[54:55] is our strength the Lord is my life and
[54:58] my salvation the Lord is the strength of
[55:01] my life Who Shall I Fear
[55:03] he was already laying in that Rapture
[55:04] message where after the strength of the
[55:07] body
[55:08] the light and the life the strength
[55:11] so as a prophet he's pointing us to the
[55:13] major
[55:15] and then there's if I could just use
[55:17] this series of sermons as an example so
[55:19] you could kind of catch the context
[55:20] sometimes to what brother Brandon's
[55:22] saying
[55:23] on April 15th he preached Christ is
[55:25] identified the same in all generations
[55:28] the next day and when their eyes were
[55:30] opened they knew him
[55:31] the next day then Jesus came and called
[55:35] that morning he's preaching the Paradox
[55:36] he says I want to preach tonight the
[55:38] unveilment of the one true God but I
[55:39] think it's going to be too long but what
[55:40] I'm after is the strength of the body of
[55:41] Christ
[55:42] so that evening preached Jesus keeps all
[55:44] his appointments
[55:46] and the next night the trial
[55:48] now that's quite a set list
[55:51] that's that think about what he's trying
[55:53] to get at Christ the same in all
[55:54] generations when they opened their eyes
[55:56] they knew him then Jesus came and called
[55:57] Jesus keeps all his appointments and
[55:59] then the trial is if to say put me on
[56:02] trial what is my Ministry to do what was
[56:04] my commission on the Ohio River
[56:07] all right
[56:10] another Bannerman writes in the church
[56:12] age book he says I recognize that Dr
[56:13] Luther did not believe only and preach
[56:15] only justification but that was his
[56:17] major theme
[56:18] as indeed it had to be for that is the
[56:20] basic doctrine of the truth of the word
[56:22] Luther had a major theme
[56:25] obviously these are my words Wesley had
[56:26] a major theme
[56:28] the restoration the gifts and the
[56:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost there's
[56:30] another major theme to laodicea but what
[56:32] was brother branham's major theme
[56:35] if Luther had one did Brother Brenham
[56:37] have a major theme
[56:39] when he was wrestling with this when he
[56:41] was looking at do the work of an
[56:43] evangelist
[56:44] and identifying that time in his
[56:46] ministry whether it be around the time
[56:47] of spoken words of the Original Seed he
[56:49] preaches um my new ministry and he's
[56:52] wrestling with these visions and things
[56:54] and he preaches present stage of my
[56:56] Ministry he's talking about a transition
[56:58] something's going to change we're coming
[56:59] am I building a platform what's going to
[57:01] happen something great is going to
[57:02] happen even comes down to the very end
[57:04] of 62 and he knows he knows he's just on
[57:06] the door step of something great but
[57:09] this is what he says in present stage of
[57:10] my Ministry I hope that he'll Crown my
[57:12] Ministry of this of letting me take the
[57:15] clothes of the word and dress his bride
[57:17] and the clothe of the word for his
[57:19] righteousness
[57:21] his ministry was different than that of
[57:22] an evangelist
[57:24] he it was on a higher order
[57:26] he preached the commission we see the
[57:28] commission being manifested signs and
[57:30] wonder wonders being performed Miracles
[57:32] laying hands on the stick casting out
[57:34] Devils raising the dead we see those
[57:36] things along the lines of the regular
[57:37] commission but there was a special sign
[57:39] in demonstration as minister to get our
[57:41] attention because there's a message to
[57:43] follow there's a voice that follows
[57:47] and he says I'm after the strength of
[57:48] the body of Christ
[57:58] I'm at that I'm at a critical Junction
[58:04] in Isaiah 37 verse 3
[58:07] says they said unto him
[58:10] this is an uh Israel's at a Breaking
[58:12] Point
[58:13] they're being besieged and
[58:17] Hezekiah wants to go uh see he wants to
[58:20] send a message to Isaiah and this is
[58:22] what they say to Isaiah the words of
[58:24] Hezekiah
[58:26] this day is a day of trouble
[58:28] and of rebuke and blasphemy words that
[58:31] fit perfectly with the end times
[58:33] for in a time of trouble he shall hide
[58:35] me and in in the last days there's gonna
[58:37] be scoffers and mockers rebukes and
[58:39] blasphemies
[58:40] and he says for the children or come to
[58:42] the birth and there's not strength to
[58:44] bring forth
[58:45] the exact words are used in second Kings
[58:47] chapter 19.
[58:49] but when Hezekiah wants to describe what
[58:51] a day of trouble in a time of trouble on
[58:52] this day of rebuke can blasphemy he
[58:54] describes them as a woman in labor
[58:58] and she's come to the point to where she
[59:00] has to deliver but she's got no strength
[59:01] anymore
[59:03] no power for deliverance she's she's
[59:05] come through this full term to where now
[59:07] the body in its natural way is going
[59:09] into labor pains but it's such a
[59:11] terrible labor maybe it's such a travail
[59:13] that now at the time when the baby
[59:15] should come forth she's she's lost all
[59:17] her strength and there's no power for
[59:19] deliverance
[59:20] now this is this is Hezekiah describing
[59:23] them in their natural state in the time
[59:26] of The Siege and the war for they're
[59:28] engaged and he said there's just no hope
[59:30] now if you look in the natural when a
[59:31] woman comes to that place
[59:33] in those days it was death
[59:36] because if you don't have that strength
[59:38] to push that final that the final part
[59:42] to deliver the baby then that's whether
[59:44] you're just all spent and there's where
[59:46] nowadays science just can intervene and
[59:48] do certain things but there's a natural
[59:49] and I've watched it in our own labors
[59:50] with oh my those were so tough with our
[59:54] four children of what it takes the toll
[59:56] it takes on the body and you've got to
[59:59] come to that place I remember one time
[1:00:00] with I think it was with Elliot we had
[1:00:03] tremendous doctor in Scottsdale it's
[1:00:05] just a one of the best doctors I'd ever
[1:00:07] ever know best doctor I've ever had in
[1:00:09] delivery
[1:00:10] and it came to the point to where that I
[1:00:13] think you labor over 36 hours
[1:00:16] and uh with no no medicines not nothing
[1:00:19] you know nothing going no interventions
[1:00:20] at all this is all natural and the no
[1:00:23] sleep in weary and come to the very end
[1:00:25] and now Elliot's just at it's at the
[1:00:27] point of Deliverance and she's so tired
[1:00:30] there's no strength and I remember the
[1:00:32] duck says she said Elizabeth you got to
[1:00:34] give it that tiger mama
[1:00:36] you got to find that strength you've got
[1:00:38] to push you got to get past this you got
[1:00:40] to bring it bring it forth and
[1:00:42] hezekiah's describe it says there's no
[1:00:43] strength
[1:00:44] it's not there
[1:00:45] we can't be delivered
[1:00:47] it's death
[1:00:49] and when it says the children who come
[1:00:50] to the birth this has a prophetic
[1:00:52] description now the time that we're
[1:00:53] living in it literally means to come to
[1:00:55] a place of a breach
[1:00:58] come to a place of opening but there's
[1:01:00] no strength and no power
[1:01:02] and think about the church world and the
[1:01:04] history of the church up to 1963 with
[1:01:07] everything God had done and whatever
[1:01:09] dead
[1:01:11] dead as a door now though they might
[1:01:13] have been standing on their feet look it
[1:01:15] might have been things that come
[1:01:16] together and that had
[1:01:20] can these Dry Bones live
[1:01:23] and there's no strength to come to a
[1:01:25] place of a breach and there's no
[1:01:27] strength so what happens in March of
[1:01:30] 1963 on March 17th in the evening 1963
[1:01:33] what is brother Brennan preach the
[1:01:35] breach
[1:01:36] why because we've come to the place of
[1:01:39] the opening and he preaches the breach
[1:01:41] before the open of the Seven Seals were
[1:01:44] there at this moment something has to
[1:01:46] come forth where are we going to get it
[1:01:48] quick any power has to come there's no
[1:01:51] strength but here stands a sentiment who
[1:01:53] can prophesy to the dry bones and
[1:01:56] strength comes to us at the opening of
[1:01:59] the word
[1:02:01] when you have need of it it's revealed
[1:02:04] something greater something who he is
[1:02:08] he says at the open of the Seven Seals
[1:02:10] the full word is to be born into
[1:02:11] manifestation again and Vindicated by
[1:02:14] the spirit of God in the full strength
[1:02:16] that's your major
[1:02:19] and the sermon go awake Jesus brother
[1:02:20] Brown says now we have we've given
[1:02:22] tonight for healing service
[1:02:24] now I guess many of you wonder usually
[1:02:26] in coming across the country I announce
[1:02:28] I'm going to have a meeting the first
[1:02:30] thought is Divine Healing
[1:02:33] but there's more to the ministry than
[1:02:34] Divine Healing
[1:02:36] more to the ministry than Divine Healing
[1:02:38] think to let these things just kind of
[1:02:40] add up now it's a little
[1:02:42] there's more to this ministry more to
[1:02:44] brother Brandon's Ministry more to the
[1:02:46] third pool more to the only seals more
[1:02:48] to this bright age than Divine Healing
[1:02:50] the sickest body I know of tonight is
[1:02:52] the so-called body of Jesus Christ I
[1:02:55] could say Amen in 1963. but he was what
[1:02:58] was he doing he was bringing us a word
[1:02:59] to change that prognosis
[1:03:02] he says the sickest body I know it needs
[1:03:04] spiritual healing there's only one bomb
[1:03:05] that I know that will heal that's the
[1:03:07] word and that's the sick body that we
[1:03:09] want to stand up
[1:03:11] in the strength and the Vitamin Power of
[1:03:14] the gospel and that's why I use much of
[1:03:16] the time now in trying to strengthen the
[1:03:19] church by the word
[1:03:23] that was his ministry he could continue
[1:03:25] in evangelism he could have prayer lines
[1:03:27] he could have campaigns he got
[1:03:29] manifestations but he had been given a
[1:03:32] sign to demonstrate to the people that
[1:03:34] the time was at hand and God was
[1:03:36] permitting something greater to come the
[1:03:39] sign was given the attention had been
[1:03:40] caught now what it's the message it's
[1:03:43] the word that he wants to lay in to give
[1:03:45] strength for our deliverance
[1:03:49] that's who I want to I want the bride to
[1:03:52] stand up what I'm after is the strength
[1:03:54] of the body of Christ
[1:03:56] in time evangelism is the shaping of our
[1:03:59] character by the word
[1:04:02] I want to stand up that's why I use my
[1:04:04] time now I may not spend a lot of time
[1:04:06] in healings and all these other things I
[1:04:08] want to spend my time in the word to
[1:04:09] strengthen the church by the word
[1:04:10] because there's more to this ministry
[1:04:12] than Divine Healing he says
[1:04:14] it says tonight we're giving it to a
[1:04:16] healing service I guess usually when
[1:04:17] everybody hears my name and here's it's
[1:04:19] announced they they just think the first
[1:04:21] thing they think of oh the message they
[1:04:23] think oh brother Brown I'm Divine
[1:04:24] Healing says no no there's more to this
[1:04:27] than that
[1:04:29] if he's the prophet of Malachi 4 5
[1:04:31] Malachi 4 2 says but unto you that fear
[1:04:34] my name shall
[1:04:37] the son of righteousness arrives
[1:04:39] it is the rising of the sun with healing
[1:04:42] in his wings
[1:04:45] and ye shall go forth
[1:04:48] and grow up as calves of the star
[1:04:51] that means you're feeding
[1:04:53] clean profit or clean word of God that's
[1:04:56] why I'm trying to lay stand up when the
[1:04:58] strength and vitamin power of the Gospel
[1:04:59] strengthen the church by the word why
[1:05:01] because the son of righteousness Rises
[1:05:03] with healing in his wings
[1:05:05] and you're gonna cut burst forth to life
[1:05:07] you're gonna grow up to maturity by
[1:05:09] feeding on the word of God
[1:05:11] brother Brown says and when the son of
[1:05:13] righteousness Rises with healing in his
[1:05:15] wings there'll be a church to go up to
[1:05:16] meet him in the air
[1:05:18] I want to get touch on it here in the
[1:05:20] next couple services on the countdown
[1:05:22] principles I think we're getting a
[1:05:24] really good foundation on that with
[1:05:25] brother Chris
[1:05:27] and think about it the airplane
[1:05:29] what that represents but then the
[1:05:31] astronaut
[1:05:32] what's manifested what's demonstrated in
[1:05:34] the airplane and what is it same power
[1:05:37] power but more of it
[1:05:40] more of it so if you if you if you
[1:05:43] looked at the airplane and what's
[1:05:45] manifest in the airplane age and if I
[1:05:47] could put in these terms if you denied
[1:05:48] that science and that technology and
[1:05:50] said oh there's nothing to it it's
[1:05:51] hogwash you can never be an astronaut
[1:05:53] because it's the same science the same
[1:05:55] technology it's the same it's the same
[1:05:58] progression of thought and the same
[1:05:59] mechanics and Dynamics in the sense of
[1:06:01] we just have no more of it now greater
[1:06:04] propulsion aerodynamics and they're
[1:06:05] building it all together so remember
[1:06:07] that in your mind as we think about this
[1:06:09] he says the son of righteousness will
[1:06:10] arise with healing his wings to bring
[1:06:12] the church to a meeting in the air
[1:06:14] in the message Shalom this is the way he
[1:06:16] puts it his spoken word will be
[1:06:18] Vindicated when the son of righteousness
[1:06:20] shall rise with healing in his wings
[1:06:22] Shalom is um
[1:06:24] one of the sermons that I've been
[1:06:26] studying where he's talking about a
[1:06:27] symphony
[1:06:28] Symphony great conductor and he's shown
[1:06:30] us the tunes and The rhythms and the
[1:06:32] Beats he says and the healing part there
[1:06:35] will not be a physical healing as you
[1:06:37] think
[1:06:38] as some saying somebody's got a sickness
[1:06:40] and it'll be taken away from him that's
[1:06:42] what he's doing now in type but the
[1:06:45] whole creature will be changed
[1:06:47] this Mortal will take on immortality
[1:06:49] this old age will jump into youth
[1:06:53] amen this whole age will jump into youth
[1:06:56] that's what's embodied in the son of
[1:06:58] righteousness will arise with healing in
[1:07:01] his wings is that not what healing
[1:07:02] represents is the change of our body
[1:07:04] it's not what the these things are all
[1:07:07] guarantee of Eternity not a healing
[1:07:09] where this body gets sick it needs
[1:07:10] healing gets healed gets sick again
[1:07:12] healed sick again healed sick again over
[1:07:14] and over and over again but that points
[1:07:15] to the fact that there's a new body
[1:07:18] there's a party waiting for me without
[1:07:20] spot without blemish that'll never die
[1:07:22] and never age
[1:07:25] I says that whole creature it's not the
[1:07:27] healing physical hymn that you think the
[1:07:29] son of Rights is rising with healing his
[1:07:31] wings he's not doing a healing of the
[1:07:33] body like you think but that is a type
[1:07:35] of the healing he's doing
[1:07:38] no it's just how much this develops and
[1:07:40] the God of this evil age
[1:07:42] he says pray he says dear Jesus don't
[1:07:44] let one of them be lost
[1:07:45] as your servant that stands between the
[1:07:47] living and the Dead pointing them with
[1:07:49] the finger to the word of God
[1:07:51] I cannot save them Lord but they want to
[1:07:53] be saved and father as I've said many
[1:07:55] times the sun rises in the morning
[1:07:58] and it comes up across the Earth it's
[1:08:01] sent by God to ripen the grain to make
[1:08:03] natural food for natural living
[1:08:05] but oh God you said
[1:08:07] to them that fear his name shall the son
[1:08:09] of righteousness arise with healing in
[1:08:11] his wings now remember it's not physical
[1:08:14] healing like you think
[1:08:16] that's just a type of what he's wanting
[1:08:18] to do and now he's put in present tense
[1:08:20] let the son of righteousness the word of
[1:08:23] God rise in the hearts of the people
[1:08:25] and the healing rays of faith and that
[1:08:28] word cure every disobedient to the word
[1:08:31] and bring them to the fullness of the
[1:08:33] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:08:36] it's the message
[1:08:38] that's the message that's the thrust
[1:08:40] that's the main thing that's the major
[1:08:42] let the son of righteousness arise it is
[1:08:46] the rise of sun and let it rise in our
[1:08:48] hearts Let The Healing raise the faith
[1:08:50] in that word cure anything that doesn't
[1:08:52] harmonize with the word anything that's
[1:08:55] not in line with the word it let it
[1:08:57] bring me to the fullness of the stature
[1:09:00] of the Son of God let me go from Faith
[1:09:02] to perfect faith
[1:09:05] let it let this word be fully poured in
[1:09:07] me let it be burst forth to life
[1:09:12] oh Hallelujah
[1:09:14] now I just if I could try to figure out
[1:09:17] a way just to say this in my closing
[1:09:18] remarks
[1:09:20] and don't assume any particular time
[1:09:22] limit on that
[1:09:25] but if uh
[1:09:27] in in going through this just this
[1:09:30] morning
[1:09:31] with the right emphasis
[1:09:34] in the right order in the right
[1:09:36] understanding that we recognize our day
[1:09:39] and its message we recognize that
[1:09:41] Malachi 4 5 we recognize the son of
[1:09:44] righteousness the rise in our hearts and
[1:09:46] the Rays of Faith breaking away every
[1:09:48] doubt breaking away unbelief if we
[1:09:50] recognize we have power to bind it the
[1:09:52] greatest to the least if we recognize
[1:09:54] where we are in the time of God if we
[1:09:56] recognize the word of God why wouldn't
[1:09:58] healing be in this
[1:10:01] how could it not be in this
[1:10:04] if this is where we are today if this is
[1:10:06] the time that we're living how can
[1:10:08] healing not be a part of this word
[1:10:13] the major and a minor
[1:10:16] if I could summarize that it's having
[1:10:18] the right emphasis
[1:10:19] so that the word is effective
[1:10:22] because the message is in all Divine
[1:10:24] Healing
[1:10:25] there's more to this ministry he says
[1:10:27] than Divine Healing but if you get in
[1:10:29] the wrong the wrong vein and the wrong
[1:10:32] slant then that's all you all you return
[1:10:34] back to
[1:10:35] that's all that becomes it becomes about
[1:10:37] that and there's got to be a way to kind
[1:10:39] of build keep building that up and build
[1:10:41] that up building up this expectation
[1:10:42] where oh my just any moment any moment
[1:10:44] it's it's going to happen any moment
[1:10:46] it's gonna be this great climactic
[1:10:47] moment where spontaneously everyone is
[1:10:49] healed and we just you look at it in
[1:10:51] that vein and it's not that anything in
[1:10:54] that pattern isn't in the word it's just
[1:10:57] the emphasis isn't right
[1:10:59] and so Prophet has to come and after
[1:11:01] they've had the Revival Elijah comes to
[1:11:03] the Altar and the evening time what does
[1:11:04] he do he repairs the altar
[1:11:06] and all the stones and all the elements
[1:11:08] of the altar he has to build it back up
[1:11:10] again build it in the right way that
[1:11:11] they've all their fanaticism tore it
[1:11:13] down
[1:11:14] and at the evening time he takes the
[1:11:15] wood and he rightly divides the word of
[1:11:17] God divides the Bullock upon the Altar
[1:11:20] and then the fire falls
[1:11:22] because it had to be in a particular
[1:11:23] order for the word to be effective
[1:11:26] so let's catch we say the major and the
[1:11:29] minor you can't major on a minor
[1:11:32] so when you catch the prophetic emphasis
[1:11:34] not in just healing versus salvation but
[1:11:38] this order the Prophet The Prophet's
[1:11:40] order where Christ is the major
[1:11:43] the word
[1:11:45] so mentioned a moment ago and you can
[1:11:47] just keep that up there for a moment
[1:11:48] Brother John
[1:11:51] mentioned a moment ago her brother bear
[1:11:52] says I hope I can say this on Sunday and
[1:11:54] say it to the point to where it just
[1:11:55] sinks in and you'll never be able to get
[1:11:57] away with from it
[1:12:00] and he's talking about the message
[1:12:01] coming the message coming forth then he
[1:12:03] preaches Christ is the mystery of God
[1:12:04] revealed and we realize what a
[1:12:05] significant sermon that is
[1:12:08] at the very end the sermon's ending and
[1:12:11] he's laid in all these tremendous
[1:12:13] tremendous standpoints at the very end
[1:12:15] he's singing Take the name of Jesus with
[1:12:16] you
[1:12:18] and he's singing it in the key of G
[1:12:22] and he's he's take the name of Jesus
[1:12:24] with you and then as he sings it through
[1:12:27] he says he he's saying the first pull is
[1:12:32] uh first pull is manifested the second
[1:12:34] pull has ended
[1:12:36] and then he starts singing
[1:12:38] and when he does he changes the key
[1:12:41] and he says did you notice the spirit
[1:12:43] take the same song
[1:12:45] and picking it up an octave higher like
[1:12:47] that the next pull is at hand
[1:12:51] and so brother Branham changed he's
[1:12:52] singing in the key of G and he changes
[1:12:55] it and he changes it to the key of C
[1:12:57] now if we were wanting to be technical
[1:12:59] he was in G major
[1:13:02] and then when he changes now he wants to
[1:13:04] change from G he changes to C major
[1:13:08] and when I first began to look at this
[1:13:11] the major on a minor subject last month
[1:13:13] it's been over a period of a couple
[1:13:14] months now I've really just been
[1:13:16] exploring it in the message of the hour
[1:13:17] because I wanted to understand I didn't
[1:13:19] just want to make the mistake of saying
[1:13:20] well the miners Divine healer and I
[1:13:22] wanted to know what does it even mean
[1:13:23] how can I understand this better for
[1:13:25] myself that a Divine Healing is a minor
[1:13:28] I don't want it to make it so minor and
[1:13:30] so minuscule that I leave the scale I
[1:13:33] don't want to I don't want to take the
[1:13:34] major in major on something else I don't
[1:13:36] want to think there's a bunch of Majors
[1:13:37] there's a bunch of minors how does this
[1:13:38] all work and so as I was upon it what's
[1:13:40] the difference between the major and the
[1:13:43] minor
[1:13:44] and something was quickened to me the
[1:13:46] major key and a minor key
[1:13:49] that and and I thought well there's
[1:13:50] there must be something to this that
[1:13:52] there's a major key and there's a minor
[1:13:54] and I'm not very good at music and so
[1:13:56] there's certain things I did know as far
[1:13:57] as keys and things
[1:13:59] but I so I asked brother Micah I
[1:14:01] certainly appreciate the gift that God's
[1:14:03] placed in our body through Micah and I
[1:14:06] asked brother Mike I said so can you
[1:14:08] explain to me the major scale major to
[1:14:10] the minor and how does it how does the
[1:14:12] minor work within the scale and as
[1:14:13] wanting just to understand a little bit
[1:14:15] of the music theory to it
[1:14:17] and and so he the language he used is
[1:14:20] that every major key has a relative
[1:14:22] minor or a related minor
[1:14:25] right and so I I he gave me a tremendous
[1:14:27] lesson I took notes and I it clicked
[1:14:29] and the inspiration just locked
[1:14:32] so you could have a major
[1:14:34] and then it's going to there's going to
[1:14:36] be a minor that's in a relative
[1:14:38] relationship
[1:14:40] right so they're related
[1:14:42] but they're different
[1:14:44] and in the sermon are greater than Psalm
[1:14:46] is here brother man said so about 86
[1:14:47] percent of Jesus ministry was on Divine
[1:14:49] Healing it attracts the attention of
[1:14:51] something supernatural being done and
[1:14:53] the people then believe in in the Mighty
[1:14:55] God that does it
[1:14:57] So Divine Healing is a minor and you can
[1:15:00] never major on a minor that's right Mrs
[1:15:03] biscoll
[1:15:04] isn't that isn't it that's right you can
[1:15:07] never major on a minor
[1:15:10] sister biscoll
[1:15:12] she's the validator all of a sudden
[1:15:15] Divine heal is a minor if I could say it
[1:15:17] this way I want to dramatize it this way
[1:15:19] brother Micah if you want to go ahead
[1:15:21] and come just so you can be here
[1:15:23] as a very good looking prop
[1:15:28] so he's preaching it attracts the
[1:15:30] attention something supernatural being
[1:15:32] done he doesn't need to be on camera
[1:15:33] he's good work just sitting right there
[1:15:34] being beautiful So Divine Healing is a
[1:15:37] minor you can never major on a minor any
[1:15:39] turns that's right Mrs biscoll isn't it
[1:15:43] that's right you can never major on a
[1:15:46] minor
[1:15:47] and I'd emailed brother Biscoe recently
[1:15:49] and and just sharing just saying hello
[1:15:52] to him and expressing some things in a
[1:15:53] very brief email and I said I was just
[1:15:55] reading
[1:15:56] uh in uh the greater than psalmist
[1:15:58] here's preached in Port Alberni when
[1:16:00] brother Adam turns to sister visco and
[1:16:02] says isn't that isn't that right Mrs
[1:16:05] biscoll and I thought there has to be a
[1:16:07] story to this
[1:16:09] and so when he wrote back sister biscal
[1:16:11] wrote also and she says I was playing
[1:16:14] the piano for the meetings
[1:16:16] and remember well brother Branham
[1:16:18] turning to me
[1:16:19] and making the comment about not being
[1:16:21] able to Major on a minor
[1:16:24] because she's at the piano
[1:16:26] that has major scales and minor scales
[1:16:28] that has a certain way things have to
[1:16:30] work in a certain order that's why I can
[1:16:32] go up there and start banging on keys
[1:16:34] and you know you ever see people get on
[1:16:35] there like this sounds good doesn't it's
[1:16:36] like no it doesn't sound good at all
[1:16:39] You're Breaking All the Rules and not in
[1:16:40] a way that that creates the kind of
[1:16:42] tension that music you create this is
[1:16:44] not a good this is not a good sound
[1:16:48] and there she is on the piano and when
[1:16:52] she wrote that back it was after I had
[1:16:53] the conversation with brother Micah and
[1:16:54] then she emails this back I'm like yes
[1:16:56] this is one way that we can see this and
[1:16:58] recognize this the major and the minor
[1:17:00] because you can't major
[1:17:03] on a minor
[1:17:06] think of it you can't major on a minor
[1:17:09] when brother bear says you can't major
[1:17:11] on a minor now from a profit standpoint
[1:17:13] why because the key has changed
[1:17:16] and when brother I'm singing Take the
[1:17:18] name of Jesus with you it's it's in the
[1:17:20] key of G but when he changes what key do
[1:17:23] you think he went to C major
[1:17:26] says Christ that's the major
[1:17:29] and the minor to see to C major is a
[1:17:33] minor
[1:17:34] so once you put it in its place the
[1:17:36] miner Finds Its place
[1:17:39] just think of this picture
[1:17:42] the relative minor
[1:17:44] to C major is a minor
[1:17:47] you have C major and a minor they all
[1:17:48] have the same seven notes
[1:17:51] what you want to run through those real
[1:17:52] quick the same seven notes
[1:17:56] same seven notes in C major it's called
[1:17:59] a key signature the only difference
[1:18:01] between the c major scale and the a
[1:18:03] minor scale is the order
[1:18:05] now to me
[1:18:07] a minor seems pretty major because they
[1:18:09] get the order right right A B C D E F G
[1:18:12] right
[1:18:13] that sounds very logical that makes
[1:18:16] sense but it's the minor the major C
[1:18:19] major is in a different order
[1:18:22] and so the c major scope that's what we
[1:18:23] call the key of C and I'm doing this for
[1:18:25] all of our song leaders here
[1:18:26] to know what keys are and if you want
[1:18:29] the key of A minor these are the the
[1:18:30] notes that would be in a my a minor
[1:18:33] and there's different words that are
[1:18:35] used as I was studying this the tonality
[1:18:37] the tonic
[1:18:38] but it's the key
[1:18:40] so when you're in the key of C there's a
[1:18:42] certain arrangement of notes and chords
[1:18:45] and when you have the tonal Center you
[1:18:47] have the tonic the key of C it's the
[1:18:50] center or Central note
[1:18:52] and so it becomes the name of the key
[1:18:55] so what I'm like when brotherbraham
[1:18:56] changed it to C it was Christ becomes
[1:18:59] the major
[1:19:00] that that's the scale now Christ is the
[1:19:03] center
[1:19:04] Christ is the focal point
[1:19:06] but if you're in a minor scale Divine
[1:19:08] Healing is a minor now Divine Healing
[1:19:11] becomes the focal point
[1:19:12] that becomes the focus and so once you
[1:19:15] once you're in this key the major key or
[1:19:18] the tonic or the tonal centers the
[1:19:20] target toward which all the other I'm
[1:19:22] having to read this right
[1:19:24] I didn't go to Juilliard I didn't you
[1:19:26] know the the course I took on YouTube
[1:19:28] didn't implanted my brain
[1:19:30] it's a Target towards toward which all
[1:19:33] other notes lead
[1:19:35] so all the notes are leading to C
[1:19:38] when you're in the c major scale all all
[1:19:41] notes all gifts all of it leads to
[1:19:44] Christ we're near the right key
[1:19:47] but it but so that becomes the key it
[1:19:50] becomes the name of the scale
[1:19:52] it's the very it's a very focal point
[1:19:54] the center it's the first note
[1:19:56] it's the center note and it's the last
[1:19:59] note
[1:20:00] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:20:03] it's the first and the beginning it's
[1:20:05] the middle it's the last that kids see
[1:20:08] and then it's the it's the central note
[1:20:11] but then it's the final resolution
[1:20:13] he's the author and the finisher he's at
[1:20:16] the front of the book The Middle of the
[1:20:17] book is at the end of the book
[1:20:19] and then the tone
[1:20:21] when you're that scene and it becomes
[1:20:22] the tone that note that complete comes
[1:20:25] with a complete relaxation and the
[1:20:27] stability of the sound
[1:20:29] even to where in in music
[1:20:32] really good music um builds tension
[1:20:35] that's what gets our minds oh we like
[1:20:37] this we like that's why some of us
[1:20:38] really like the bridge
[1:20:39] right
[1:20:40] it's a certain way it's a rock trick it
[1:20:42] kind of gets in your minds and then
[1:20:43] whenever and whenever the octave changes
[1:20:46] I like those artists that can sing that
[1:20:47] low range and then when they really want
[1:20:49] to ramp it up
[1:20:50] right and it just brings you out of your
[1:20:53] seat you're like yes that's it
[1:20:55] it's because the mind has a way that it
[1:20:57] works and certain expectations this is
[1:20:58] the natural part it's waiting to hear
[1:21:00] something something that fits in that
[1:21:03] Rhythm it's building anticipation it's
[1:21:04] building expectation but it's got to
[1:21:06] come back to the sea in that major scale
[1:21:08] C and it's what relieves the tension and
[1:21:12] brings a sense of completion
[1:21:14] when it comes back to that it's resolved
[1:21:17] everything's completed am I getting it
[1:21:19] right okay
[1:21:21] and then when they when they're looking
[1:21:23] at this in these major scales all other
[1:21:25] notes are defined in terms of their
[1:21:27] relation to the main key
[1:21:29] when you find the right key all other
[1:21:31] notes are defined by the relationship to
[1:21:33] that key to that centered that Focus
[1:21:36] so an A Minor
[1:21:37] what's the center
[1:21:39] what's the focus a
[1:21:42] that's the focus Divine Healing
[1:21:45] when you make a minor the major when you
[1:21:47] make a minor the key when you make that
[1:21:49] the focal point then divide the center
[1:21:51] and the focus is a but in C major
[1:21:54] the center and the focus is C
[1:21:58] it's all chords and all melodies return
[1:22:01] and rest on C
[1:22:05] wherever they go whatever they do
[1:22:07] they're all leading back to bring you
[1:22:10] big carry you as music does back to the
[1:22:13] sense of completion in these seven notes
[1:22:16] coming back together and resting on C
[1:22:19] my brother Brown says you can't major on
[1:22:21] a minor
[1:22:22] it's because it's always going to lead
[1:22:24] you back to a minor
[1:22:27] if you made your if you're if you're
[1:22:29] trying to make something minor major you
[1:22:30] got the keys wrong that's why maybe one
[1:22:32] of the big debates I came across this
[1:22:34] and looking at this is how do you know
[1:22:35] when you're in the minor how do you know
[1:22:36] when you're in the major scale how you
[1:22:37] know when your miners go because it's
[1:22:39] all the same notes
[1:22:42] and so it leads when you're in the right
[1:22:44] when you're in the right key it leads
[1:22:46] back to the major Christ
[1:22:49] and we've got to be in the right key
[1:22:51] we believe in Divine Healing we believe
[1:22:53] in the fruits of the spirit we believe
[1:22:54] in the five gifts within the the church
[1:22:57] we must be in the right key healing is
[1:23:00] in the c major scale right
[1:23:03] preaching is in the c major scale
[1:23:05] science wonders Miracles gifts they get
[1:23:07] fruits of the spirit they're all in the
[1:23:09] c major scale all the Miracles signed
[1:23:11] wonders are all in the c major scale but
[1:23:14] we needed the message to reveal to us
[1:23:16] the mystery of Christ
[1:23:18] go listen or read the sermon Shalom but
[1:23:20] I was talking about a symphony and a
[1:23:21] sympathy and he's talking about a
[1:23:23] symphony and he's talking about we got
[1:23:24] to get on the same kind of sheet music
[1:23:25] you got to be in harmony with the
[1:23:26] director has to be in harmony with the
[1:23:28] composer and you have to catch the
[1:23:29] Rhythm and the beat and whenever it
[1:23:31] changes and it builds he said you all
[1:23:32] have to be you have to be in the right
[1:23:34] line the right Harmony and we can say
[1:23:37] this and this time in this hour
[1:23:38] something major has happened
[1:23:41] we went from a minor we've left we've
[1:23:44] now moved and now he's changed keys
[1:23:46] we're in the major we're not we're not
[1:23:48] in something minor we're now in the
[1:23:50] major Christ
[1:23:53] and we must be in harmony with the word
[1:23:55] to recognize the right keys
[1:23:57] to knowing something that's the right
[1:23:58] note but it's not you've just you've
[1:24:00] changed things a little bit
[1:24:04] I was going to invite the rest of the
[1:24:06] musicians to come but you're it
[1:24:14] whatever's on your heart you can play by
[1:24:15] the Micah
[1:24:18] something major has happened
[1:24:21] when brother bam was singing Take the
[1:24:23] name of Jesus with you and change his
[1:24:24] keys
[1:24:28] he said the next pull is at hand
[1:24:31] the third pull
[1:24:33] to bring us into Rapture and faith and I
[1:24:35] don't think it's a coincidence that he
[1:24:37] put it in that scale
[1:24:39] where see Christ is the center
[1:24:42] because that's what he said in the ABCs
[1:24:44] always believed the sea is Christ
[1:24:47] and only the prophet
[1:24:49] we look at and says well isn't it a b c
[1:24:51] d e f g isn't isn't that the wouldn't
[1:24:53] that be the orderly sevens isn't that
[1:24:55] where they place the seventh but he knew
[1:24:57] just how to place it so that no matter
[1:24:59] what in that scale it all began with c
[1:25:03] and all ends with C
[1:25:05] and all the other notes work together
[1:25:09] coming right back to the completion of
[1:25:10] the resolution of C
[1:25:12] the major is Christ
[1:25:15] a minor
[1:25:17] is the compliment is it related
[1:25:20] the key of A if that Divine Healing it's
[1:25:22] part of it but it's not all of it
[1:25:27] and in the sermon I wanted to read this
[1:25:30] just as a prayer I want us to be very
[1:25:32] prayerful now as we close
[1:25:39] you remember how he wanted to
[1:25:41] preach the unveilment of the one true
[1:25:43] God
[1:25:44] he says I really want to preach on this
[1:25:46] but I think it'll take too long
[1:25:49] he preaches it June 14th in the morning
[1:25:52] 1964 he comes to it a couple months
[1:25:55] later
[1:25:57] and he's praying
[1:26:01] he says bless Thy word to our heart
[1:26:04] we know that there's no man in heaven or
[1:26:06] an earth is worthy to take this book to
[1:26:09] loose the seals or to look upon it even
[1:26:12] but there was one appeared
[1:26:15] the slain land a slain lamb bloody
[1:26:18] that came and took the book and was
[1:26:20] Worthy
[1:26:21] and able to open it
[1:26:23] that's our third pull
[1:26:25] that's when that key changed
[1:26:29] and it was you know when those other
[1:26:31] Keys is Sharps and flats but in the key
[1:26:34] of C major there's no sharps or flats
[1:26:37] and he's in the key of G and there's an
[1:26:39] F sharp
[1:26:40] but then when he goes to C major
[1:26:43] no Flats
[1:26:45] no sharps
[1:26:47] they're not all it's all it's all being
[1:26:49] crystallized
[1:26:51] the simple Christ has been revealed
[1:26:53] that's that's what this open of the word
[1:26:55] is
[1:26:57] he says o Lamb of God open Thy word to
[1:26:59] our hearts today
[1:27:01] he says for comfort
[1:27:03] we are your servants forgive our sins
[1:27:06] Lord and this is the part I want you to
[1:27:07] did I not provide this brother John in
[1:27:09] there
[1:27:10] okay
[1:27:11] must have done it for a reason but hear
[1:27:14] this he says in anything that would keep
[1:27:17] the word from going forth with great
[1:27:19] power and influence to down our lives
[1:27:21] take it away Lord
[1:27:25] anything that would keep the word from
[1:27:28] going forth with great power and
[1:27:29] influence in our lives take it away
[1:27:33] anything that would keep the word from
[1:27:36] influence to life takeaway says any
[1:27:37] hindrance
[1:27:38] that we might have full access to all
[1:27:42] the blessings promised to us through Thy
[1:27:45] Word
[1:27:47] any blessing the blessing of praise the
[1:27:49] blessing of Joy the fruits of the spirit
[1:27:51] Divine Healing you name it if there's
[1:27:53] any hindrance take it away
[1:27:57] he says anything that would keep us from
[1:27:58] Catching from the word going forth with
[1:28:00] great power and influence on our lives
[1:28:02] any hindrance that might keep us from
[1:28:04] full access to the blessings and promise
[1:28:06] that are promised to us Thy word take it
[1:28:09] away
[1:28:11] anything that's hinders anything that's
[1:28:13] keeping us from getting to perfect take
[1:28:15] it away anything that's keeping me from
[1:28:17] only believe take it away anything
[1:28:20] that's kept me from walking fully in the
[1:28:22] promise of my time in my hour oh God
[1:28:25] take it away
[1:28:28] and what struck me is I read this
[1:28:29] yesterday I began to think oh God
[1:28:32] whatever it takes whatever it takes for
[1:28:35] us to come to that place of a deep
[1:28:38] settled peace a stability in Christ and
[1:28:42] and a trajectory that's headed to that
[1:28:44] meat in the air whatever it takes Lord
[1:28:46] Do It
[1:28:48] if what we need if what we need is
[1:28:50] healing Lord bring the healing if what
[1:28:53] we need is the manifestation of the
[1:28:54] spirit Lord bring the manifestation but
[1:28:57] God let this word have its full
[1:29:00] influence on me
[1:29:02] I don't want to get caught in a pattern
[1:29:04] that's all I'm chasing is the sign all
[1:29:07] I'm chases the manifestation but the
[1:29:09] word is not going forth with great power
[1:29:11] and influence on my life
[1:29:14] so Lord take the key
[1:29:15] put me in the right key Lord
[1:29:18] put me in tune
[1:29:19] let me recognize that tonal Center
[1:29:21] Christ and let every note of my life
[1:29:25] lead to that
[1:29:28] let everything in your word we believe
[1:29:30] it we don't look down on any of it but
[1:29:32] Lord put it in the right key
[1:29:34] if I'm just in the key of altar calls
[1:29:35] I'll keep returning back to the altar
[1:29:37] call if I'm just in the key of prayer
[1:29:39] lines I just keep returning back to the
[1:29:41] prayer line but if I'm in the sea of
[1:29:42] Christ if I'm in the key of Christ if
[1:29:45] I'm in that major scale all the same
[1:29:47] notes are in it but now
[1:29:49] now it all returns back
[1:29:51] does it help you understand the major
[1:29:53] and the minor a little bit better
[1:29:56] let's stand
