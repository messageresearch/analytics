TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and he says Jesus answering saith unto them and we know this is after he had cursed the Fig Tree and they were just very curious about how he'd so quickly withered away he says have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whatsoever whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith and now that's that's that Declaration of faith and just how powerful faith is and then to see how quickly he follows this up he says therefore I send you whatsoever things ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses you can be seated hopefully that um we're gonna we're just picking up on where we were last Sunday so I hope that some of these things that we could go back over uh we don't have need to maybe expound on them very much but this is part 13 on Christ my healer we're fully within the the subject matter of Divine Healing and how to receive it and tonight our title even though this is a continuation of Sunday morning my title tonight is I forgive and I've kind of allowed it to be a little bit of a dot dot dot on that you could go to that next slide there brother John I forgive that's the title tonight and I've included those other two subtitles we've used recently on The Chronic conditions of the heart and vision correction because it's continuing on that process of looking or continuing on um us examining and looking at the role of our minds and the role of our emotions in terms of our sickness but maybe more importantly in terms of our healing and I believe that we're recognizing or remembering and recalling just how significant our state of mind is in terms of receiving the word of God and and receiving our healing and so tonight continuing on the subject from Sunday but we're going to call it I forgive so let's do a quick rundown of last week last Sunday on I'm sorry and I just want to touch on a few points so that we're kind of in the in the thought process um or in thinking together in this I've I'm literally just wanting to pick up where I was and I feel like we had such good momentum that I want to kind of pick some of that back up and so the the primary thought that we begin to express on on Sunday is building the foundation is how that our heart records or extores all of our experiences what we see what we hear what we taste what we smell all the things that we endure in Life or go through or enjoy or experience the heart the mind is recording things and it's storing things and so that your emotions are a giant Storehouse of experiences and as a storehouse we talked about how um whenever experiences may be something for the first time then that can produce a filter for the next time that you experience it and if you've had a bad experience it kind of colors your experience the next time oh we want to go eat at this restaurant I had a bad experience and you'd find sometimes if you've had a bad experience with a particular kind of food you'll avoid it for the rest of your life just because of one bad experience well what is it that's doing that it you say well it's my appetite it's your memory right it's your appetite that's been influenced by and shaped by your memory and by your experiences and maybe a little bit of your imagination because you're kind of imagine I don't want this to happen again but that mind and your emotions become a filter uh and an influence we mentioned how it's just kind of there to stamp things when it comes in it filters it and it learns it processes things and in Proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life this if you could weigh a scripture the the heaviness of the scripture is so significant and so powerful I've been thinking about it even more since last Sunday and thought my we could just continue to drill down on what the scripture is referring to how much there there is in our our hearts and our minds and how that life is proceeding forth from our emotions life is proceeding forth from our heart we looked into the scripture and saw that a man acts from his emotions he acts from his heart you say well brother Branham I've got the whole brother Aaron I I got the Holy Ghost and I act from I act from my soul well then it's the soul influence in your emotion questions it's a sole influence in your heart but you're going to act from your Consciousness you're going to act from your spirit as a person and that's why we want to be perfected in our character and so when the Bible says keep thy heart for out of it issue are the issues of Life something comes from your life from your heart and therefore when we think of channels of the spirit we think Gates or channels and we might just think well these are just doors or this is just a highway and this thought comes and it just passes through and it moves on to the next stop but this is your mind is not just a temporary pass-through it actually has storage and what you see what you hear what you taste what you feel all these different things are stored in your emotions stored in your heart and I would say for later use that whether it be good or bad it's stored for later use Jesus even using that language in Luke chapter six how from the good treasure a good man from the good treasure in his heart an evil man from the evil treasure in his heart saying that that something stored up something deposited into a man's spirit and so from the man's heart as he thinks and from a man's Spirit as he's acting these things are issuing forth and he says from the abundance of the heart from the abundance of things that you think about the things you see the things you hear the things you read you you speak from so it's all being stored there in your spirit and then in Proverbs chapter 18 verse 8 it says the words of a tale Bearer are his wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly and that that visual of how that a lie is deposited into the storehouse of a heart uh it kind of grabs our attention that it's not just something we hear and then and then even can even if we forget about it there's something that's happened to where there's an injury there's an impact and it says it goes down to the innermost parts of the belly it resides there it's held there so that's kind of looking at how that the heart records things and remembers things and stores up things and then we we took that and then we the next part of the sermon we moved into how that we've got to address any condemnation in our heart or anything that's in our Spirits uh when we that would hinder us when we seek God for something we don't want to we don't want to come before God asking and then have a heart that's condemned and Jesus is teaching that to us when he says uh when he teaches us how to pray and he says that we ought to ask for forgiveness we're addressing anything that we consciously know in our Spirits is out of harmony with what God's will is and we just say Lord I'm sorry I've made mistakes I did something wrong I I've done this and we simply ask for forgiveness brother Bradham says in perfect faith and this would be a good sermon if you wanted to listen to that just brings in so many different principles on this subject he said if there's condemnation in your life straighten that first that's what we ought to do if there's if you want something from God if you want healing if you want an answer then deal with any condemnation in your life and and when we say that it it would be anything that even the devil's trying to use against you and just say Lord I'm going to be honest with you the devil's trying to beat me up about this or Lord my heart's condemning me that I said this or I offended this person Lord I did something wrong to you you just have to confess it to him and say you're sorry I'll say this respectfully and I don't want it to sound like I'm just trying to toss off on something but we can have a we can have a Catholic mindset with a lot of things that we feel that we've got to do this pen Penance and we've got to suffer and we've got to we've got to feel a certain way and and it's got a really we got to really punish ourselves in order to make it feel like we've we've done we've done our penance and and really uh a repentant heart Godly sorrow in a contrite spirit and a Brokenness is what God will receive not somebody's time to physically beat themselves and it's remarkable what people will do with that Faith they'll crawl on their knees up the steps of a of a cathedral and bloody themselves thinking that in doing so God will have pity on them when all they would need to do is to say Lord forgive me I'm sorry you don't need to beat yourself up you don't need to inflict pain you don't need to try to make God think you you can feel that you know him know that you feel how sorry you are he knows your heart he's looking at your spirit and so if there's condonation straighten it out and brother Brandon says go make that thing right go out there and confess this into your husband to your wife go do this thing so in other words there's maybe some things that you can make right with a particular person he said he'll never do you any good no matter who you pray for till you make that right and so there's a there's a making things right in our hearts and it's exactly what James touches on in James chapter 5 where he says are any sick or any Afflicted in mind then pray are you sad if you are sing hymns and he says uh if you're sick call for the elders to anoint you with oil and the prayer of faith verse 15 shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him James is identifying for some people the cause of sickness and the hindrance to Healing that if we're asking God to heal us of our of in our sick body if there's anything that's not right in our Spirits just ask God to forgive us and and if there's a if there's a sickness that's the cause of Disobedience then you ask God to forgive you you say I'm sorry and I realized and I was really really encouraged by the amount of feedback I got after this past Sunday and a lot of it wasn't necessary great job that was really good brother Aaron it was more I've got a question right and and I realize I'm trying to make this very simple but I realize that once you take that simple principle and start applying it to your life you realize wow this is complex this is how do I apply this and what does it mean if this happens what does it mean if that happens and so I realized that to the individual there's a lot there's a lot that this would mean and I'll also say this as I it purposed in my heart to say this I realize that the real thrust of this an emphasis especially tonight may not apply to all of us may not apply to any of us right now but maybe you could look back and say oh I remember it applies then and maybe you'll come into it later but it's a principle nonetheless in the word of God so if I'm preaching on it and I appreciated the fact that everyone was willing that I talked to who wanted to talk about it Federal was willing to take what was said and examine themselves by it and be so sincere towards like I'm really trying to find where I'm wrong I'm really trying to find who I need to apologize to I'm really trying to find who I need to forgive and I think that's wonderful but at the same time it's a principle that may not apply to you right now but yet it's a principle that's that is applicable at times and very important for us to remember and so there is I'm trying to saw what I was trying to say there is I'm wanting to make this very very simple and if we could instead of making it complicated if it seems just to be a little bit Out Of Reach just just ask God to give you understanding and and to help you apply it so then continues confess your faults one to another pray for one another that may be healed the effectual prayer of a righteous man a man who's made things right availeth much if you've committed sins they shall be forgiven you so he says confess your faults one to another pray for one another that you may be healed do you realize how James is connecting then forgiveness and conscious your conscience together with a clear conscience together with your healing and we talked about that at the very beginning of this scripture in verses 13 and 14. how we say oh just go run and get the elders anoint me with oil and pray for me but if you're in a bad mood right if you're not in the right Spirit if you don't have the right mental attitude towards the promise of God then maybe we could say it's really presumptuous of you to expect your healing and and I guess if you did get healed despite your bad attitude we'd say well you get what you expect way to go good job but description on the list is telling us to be mindful of these things when we approach prayer and he's saying the prayer face shall save the sick but if you have sins you ask you'll repent you confess you make things right brother Branham says and has the Lord spoken only to Moses makes a very uh attention-getting statement and every one of you right now if you've got Unforgiven sins you confess it and make it right that's simple come on if you have sin you have not repented of repent of it he does he doesn't go on for paragraph after paragraph talking about how you need to make it right he just says if you've got Unforgiven sins confess it and make it right and God will heal you but it cannot heal you with Unforgiven sin sin that is not you have not asked forgiveness for that you have not repented of he says Satan still has a jurisdiction over you now that that's a remarkable statement that with unconfessed sin and you realize that there's other places in the even in the scripture and in the in the message of the hour where if someone is not Sanctified and they try to rebuke a devil they try to push the devil off of somebody the devil's looking at that person and saying your spirit does not have any power over mine you you cannot stand in the name of Jesus Christ and condemn me or cast me out when you have Unforgiven sin now you say well that the way he phrases it that Satan has jurisdiction over you uh maybe if it helps you to look at it this way God is very careful to vindicate you if you know if you had not made something right and God's not going to stand by you and honor your prayer or to or to honor your efforts if he knows that you're in a position where you need to make something right and so it's something that God is allowing then this jurisdiction and then in Matthew chapter 6 verses 9 to 15 it's the Lord's Prayer and I'm I'm taking too much time in this I apologize in the Lord's Prayer we recognize how kind of the the center part the heart of the Lord teaching us how to pray was forgiveness that this was the real secret this was a real mystery maybe not a mystery but this is the real heart of what he was teaching us is he says that when we pray we should ask for forgiveness as you've forgiven others and then that's the only principle he revisits after he teaches the disciples how to pray and so he's saying that when we approach him we say give us this day our daily bread we say I'm sorry for anything I've done wrong forgive me as I have forgiven others so when he asked for us to be forgiven of our debts it's showing that we must seek forgiveness for anything that we've said or done wrong before that we ask or when asking God something and and let me just kind of finish this part uh this addressing condemnation in our hearts in Psalms 139 verses 23 and 24. like to read the scripture and just say this that if you are you if you aren't conscious of anything that you need to repent of or there's things that you you've searched your heart you don't know or there's nothing you exactly remember that you just trust God that he'll show you if there's anything you need to make right let's not let's not make it this simple well if I've done something wrong then I'm just going to apologize and since you can't think of anything you're just going to beat yourself up and do your pittance until you can think of something to apologize for no we're that's not what you do if you can't think of anything you're just sincere before God and you could even pray this prayer search me oh God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting that you would just ask God if there's something that I need to make right if there's something that I've done wrong then Lord I'm sincere before you now show me now that's what I would that's what I think that we should do in light of the fact that we forgiveness is a critical part to us asking praying and receiving what we asked for and how many of you could testify that when you've asked God to show if you've ever done anything wrong he was faithful to show you so many of us could testify to that where we've we may not even known but just in our prayer because we have the habit of praying and also a habit of when we pray Lord if I've done anything wrong show me and you're saying here Lord forgive me if I've done anything wrong and Lord if I if there's anything that I need to make right let me right and immediately you're like oh all right okay God I feel it I know I know what I need to do and we know what's happened I believe that we ought to have this kind of confidence that if God wants us to know something he'll show us and have that kind of expectation have that kind of Desire that if I need to know something God will show me and have that confidence as parents with your children my goodness with what kids can do these these days and what they can do secretly and what they can do privately and the things that people can get away with we just say God if it's something I need to know show me and children God will show your parents kids eat free and so when we are the kind of the third part to um catching up where we were on Sunday when we pray for healing this is where I want to start tonight when we pray for healing we not only seek forgiveness for anything that we've done wrong but we Grant forgiveness also to those who've done wrong to us and that was such an important principle that we were ending on and I want to just pick up where we left off last time and so and when we read our text tonight are we are you with me on this each one of you so when we read in our text have faith in God because the disciples are puzzled by how this tree had withered so quickly he's just just have faith because you could speak to a mountain and brother talks about if you have need of it in your motive and objective and so you could speak to this mountain and not doubt in your heart and believe that what you've said shall come to pass then you could have whatsoever you saith and then Jesus kind of summarizes that principle a more General language not so specific about mountains but in a general principle that can apply to anything he says whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so this is a principle of praying and asking the prayer of faith shall save the sick I desire to be healed so I can pray and receive what I have and Jesus says and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any so this is still a part of our prayer this is part of our thinking this is part of our our minds and our hearts the condition of our heart when we go before the Lord to pray and he says that we must forgive if we have ought against any which means if you have anything against anyone that's what it means if you have ought the ought there um how many think of ought as if you have ought means you got you have ought in your heart like we think like it's you're we're dropping the F and it becomes like we fought and now I have ought but it really means just anything you know what ought do you have in your basket right it would just be is there anything in your basket it's a real general term and Jesus uses it in a general way and I know that it's become part of our vernacular kind of demean when you've got uh you've got hatred or animosity against something but he's saying if you have anything against anyone and certainly it's applying to something that you would have to forgive or to let go because forgiveness is a deliberate letting go of something it's a conscious um uh dropping of resentment the conscious dropping of bitterness is I'm going to deliberately let go of this thought of Revenge where every day like I sure hope he wrecks his car I hope this happens to him what happens to him this is where you say you know what I'm just gonna let it go we know what it means to let it go right or at least we assume our children do when we constantly Just Let It Go just Let It Go just Let It Go it means it's deliberate I'm not going to worry about it I'm not going to obsess about it I'm not going to resent I'm not going to I'm not gonna Revenge I'm just gonna let it go because the opposite of forgiveness if we spend a lot of time on this we'd see that this scriptural principle of forgiveness and letting go means that you are the opposite of forgiveness would be resentment would be feelings of bitterness or to be vengeful to want revenge and so he's saying that we ought to let those things go and I think one of the best ways to kind of summarize the opposite of forgiveness would be holding a grudge it means you're holding something against someone now you can hold something against someone and you may be like well I don't resent them and I'm certainly not bitter and and I don't necessarily want revenge but you're holding it against them right there's something in your heart that you have this ought that you you uh that and I hope that you can think of it in your own personal way because maybe there's ways that I could use a language that you're like oh he's not talking about me right because I only want to slash their tires and he never mentioned that there's just a way that you ought to be able to think about it to where it's like he's talking about this feeling I have in my heart towards this person and it doesn't have to be you want them to die in their sleep it could just be something in your heart that you know I'm not that I've got this against them because of something they did to me and in James chapter 5 verse 9 it says Grudge not one against another Brethren lest ye be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door that Grudge is uh in the in the Greek is speaking of a murmuring or complaining and a groaning that's what it's speaking of but it also and he's saying it's that which leads to condemnation and I like to think of the judge staying at the door being even our own hearts or judging us and we know that we've got something in our hearts it's a hurt it's an offense and let me be very clear again that what we're talking about in terms of forgiveness has nothing to do with pardoning or justifying the way the person acted it has nothing to do with justifying their behavior or condoning it or excusing it it's about you and your own heart holding that resentment and that bitterness against somebody else and he says and that's so there's a judging there to where it's condemning our own Hearts he says Grudge not against one another and it it's not just the complaining but it points back to what it means to Grudge which means to find fault with and it means to wish to deprive of it means to be angry a grudge is ill will that's caused by something when you hold a grudge against somebody I don't uh don't recall an instance where you ever held a grudge against somebody who gave you cash for no reason at all right so there's some behavior that was unwelcomed that was offensive that was hurtful and as a result of it we hold a grudge against them and just even that language you're holding a grudge you're carrying it with you to hold the grudge it means to maintain feelings of anger to maintain feelings of bitterness or resentment towards somebody for what they've done and to hold a grudge and to Grudge even implies a duration of time that's be that's that's not reasonable or that is longer than what one would expect that maybe in the moment you could be offended and for some time you may be hurt but there's a point at which what you're holding becomes a grudge it's the bitterness taking root that root of bitterness that begins to spring up and it will begin to defile you and so this hold in a grudge holding on to resentment harboring it in your heart holding it within the as the scripture says the innermost parts of the belly it is very painful and harmful to do so and if I could say this that holding a grudge it it has hostility with it when you Grudge something there's hostility implied in that it comes with the price if you are holding resentment in your heart you may be justified in terms of being offended you may have been hurt not of your own accord there's maybe a lot of ways that we could look at the actual offense and the fact that you were hurt and we're not we're not talking about that but it's the resentment and bitterness that you now hold in your heart and you pay a price for that I have a visual of a hook here I want you to look at and think about this this is a statement I read about unforgiveness because when you think about uh forgiving somebody then you're letting something go and this is this this is a phrase this is a statement I read one time that here recently very tremendous unforgiveness is like being on a giant hook you run a giant Hook when you have not forgiven somebody you're on a hook next to you on the hook is the person who's hurt you now if you could think about it this way you go on the hook first and now the person who's offended you is on the hook next so now you're on the hook they're on the hook and I I didn't think I couldn't think of a a way to represent that without maybe us getting a little bit queasy right so you you've been hooked right through the gills and somebody else has been hooked as well right there next to you on the hook is the person that hurt you the hook is extremely painful wherever you go so does the hook and so does the offender the only way you can get off the hook yourself is to allow the offender off first and this is the phrase the cost of not allowing the fender off the hook is perhaps a lifetime of unhappiness will follow us and follow us and follow us and I think there's a lot that we could point to in the scripture and the word of God to show how clear this principle is there's a lot that follows us and we and it's going to follow us until we're willing to forgive the offender and then they're off the hook and you can get off the hook yourself I think we said Sunday unforgiveness is a terrible disease and it's a disease that's going to corrupt your emotions it's going to color your feelings and and your experiences and not only is it going to do something in your emotions but it it actually can sicken your body and this is where I feel that I absolutely needed to address this in the subject of Divine Healing and Christ my healer is because sometimes it's sin that causes our sickness and it's a lack of forgiveness that'll keep us sick but the bottom of the sermon why he says our number one heart disease doesn't he says the main thing that kills the people to date and and that still is the number one killer of humans today is heart disease he says it's he says it's number one sin disease and what a beautiful way of looking at that they would say the physical number one killer of humans today are heart diseases or heart disease but think about even what has caused that sin but then he's looking at the real killer syn disease and sin is unbelief unbelief in what the Bible that's right yes it's the number one sin disease that kills people today both spiritually and physically I know it's a fragment here but physically and notice how he puts this um in this scripture and that'll in this statement and that'll make them kill them physically of course because they already can prove this is in 1963 they can already prove that a man that holds grudges and women who fuss and stew and fight and argue they die and I know you're like well duh they die prematurely they die as a result of the fussing and stew and the fighting and argument they die as a result of the grudges that's what's directly implied by this statement is that men that hold grudges and women who fuss and stew and fine argue they die he's not making a statement like I told my children one time everyone who fought in the Civil War died and like what you're like well yeah there's none that are still living today but this is the direct result of grudging fussing stewing fighting and arguing it'll cause cancer fungus think of bacterial infections you just think of all different ways that you could amplify that it'll cause cancer fungus fungus everything else will set in ulcers and these sicknesses then in the body he's tied directly to unbelief he's tied it directly to grudges fussing stewing fighting and arguing to fuss is to be agitated to fuss is actually when there's a fuss there's a resentment there I went and looked into the the just the history of the words and their meanings and definitions that to Stew it's that this agitation you're worried you're concerned about something and if I could say this and I trust the Lord will help me to amplify these things very succinctly that the fussing the stewing the bitterness the anger there's no justification for any of it you cannot find in the scripture where the the word of God says it's okay for you to have an A fussing stewing grudging fighting arguing spirit and there are certain states of minds or certain states of consciousness of a Christian that we can never justify as Christians we can never we can never justify it now you may have your own justifications for it but your justifications for it cannot alleviate you of the consequences for it you can have a whole lot of constant justifications for what you do uh but there's there's you say well I'm really really thirsty so I went and I grabbed this and I drank it and and and and to satiate my thirst it turns out it was poison so it doesn't matter what your reasons for taking and drinking it were there's a consequence for drinking poison that's a very importantness for us to realize that there's certain states of minds and emotions and attitudes that we hold that are poison to us and that in holding them in our hearts we can't hold them without consequence and our anger and our bitterness and our resentment it's drinking poison and don't think that you can hold hostility in your heart towards anyone and not think that you're the one that's being poisoned by it if I could quote brother Mark Twain at least he's given the credit for saying this anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured about anger anger will do more to the vessel who's holding it then to the person upon which it is directed it's an acid that if you hold within your heart it's corrupting you more than you're seething stowing anger towards that other person is and when brother Branham takes this heart disease looks at it from another angle calling it sin disease and then says it's killing them physically not just Spirit you're not just spiritually dying but you're also physically dying because the very Act of holding a grudge fussing and stewing fighting and arguing he says they can prove causes sickness and brother Branham is pointing to the impact of forgiveness on our well-being or maybe said another way he's pointing to the impact and the effect of not forgiving on our well-being that if we do not forgive it comes with the consequence and this is maybe very logical to think of it this way that if we Harbor emotions of anger hatred bitterness fussing stewing holding grudges that creates an emotional state and that even subconsciously you could be holding things anybody ever wake up with a headache and wonder why and oh I'm real because sometimes you can be so stressed out intense you clinked your teeth right and you're constantly you may not even feel stressed out but your body is stressed you're clenching your teeth you're holding your muscles real tight you're tensing up and it causes physical pain because of your emotional condition is impacting you in your physical body and there's certain states of mind the state of chronic anxiety a state of being chronic constantly under stress it's been proven I don't think I need to prove this part at all but those states of mind and those mental conditions they've proven or toxic to physical health and and specifically this is what they identify you're at an increased risk of heart disease with these certain states of chronic anxiety and stress and that's exactly what brother Brown is pointing to say well the number one killer is heart disease but he says there's also there's a there's an emotional component to this that that's causing this and he says they can already prove so when he says they can already approve this is a reference to some process of proving some study to where there's we've looked into this and we've tried to find out if there's some sort of causation related to these states of fussing and Steward and fighting and arguing to sicknesses and so he's saying that they can prove a causal connection between uh grudging fussing stewing fighting and arguing to cancer and these other stressors and ulcers and today we'd say right they can prove this what's remarkable is at the time there wasn't a lot of study on it and it's specifically with the grudges holding a grudge fussing and doing fighting and arguing he he's he's not specifically just pointing a ham if you're really going through a difficult time and times are really stressful and you don't have a lot of money and you've got this problem you've got that problem you know that that causes chronic heart conditions or going to cause this nervous tension it's going to cause stress it's going to cause high blood pressure in these things he's talking about your my your attitude towards somebody else fussing stewing fighting arguing holding grudges look at how what he talks about crowning your life by complaining and being crabby he's pointing to this and it's only been over the past five decades going back to the 70s where research has uncovered a link between health and unforgiveness and in these studies I've read in these synopsis of these Studies have been looking at the goal of these studies was to identify the effect of forgiveness on a person's physical health and their Mental Health specifically what these Studies have been looking at is how does holding grudges how does holding resentment in business how does never letting someone off the hook and yourself off the hook impact the way someone is emotionally and physically so it has to do with mental health it has to do with physical health and this is the conclusion they came to people who forgive are happier and healthier than those who don't know I'm doing this to amplify the fact that in 1963 brother Brown says it's physically killing you to fost astute to hold argues to fight to hold grudges to fight and argue it's causing all sorts of things from ulcers all the way to cancer and everything in between this is something he says they can already prove it and science has since the 70s just on the subject of forgiveness alone is saying people who forgive are happier and healthier than those who don't they have found that people who are more forgiving have fewer illnesses and those that are less forgiving have more health problems this is something that they have been able to objectively uh map out the more forgiven you are the less illnesses you have the less forgiving the more health problems they've noticed that in people who are forgiven or people who exercise forgiveness leaving one study it was just people who thought about forgiveness they noticed improved cardiovascular functioning nervous system functioning when exercising or even thinking about forgiveness these are physical metrics that sign science can look at a person's heart rate or blood pressure and they can get them to even just begin to think about thoughts of forgiving somebody and it improves a person's function of their heart or their nervous system the University of Wisconsin they did a scientific study on forgiveness in the 1980s and it began to be one of the most groundbreaking studies as it was published and the University of Wisconsin I think has a forgiveness Institute and the international forgiveness Institute Dr Enright is the professor that heads that up and this is what they they did it this is their conclusion of the study in the 80s offering forgiveness to others reduces clinical levels of anger and depression and raises self-esteem let's not forget that we're talking about a very clear scriptural principle to forgive somebody who's hurt you somebody who's harmed you and there's I don't believe that there's any truth today that we can't bring back to the Bible I know that may be a pretty broad statement but we're talking about truth he says it reduced they conclude it reduces clinical levels of anger and depression to raise the self-esteem to offer forgiveness to others and they have amassed since this time volumes of evidence that the physical and psychological benefits of forgiveness volumes enough to write a book on it where they can have a whole book that just goes over the studies and the conclusions of it and if you take together what we ministered on Sunday and the the few things that we've tried to put back into the record today and take a step forward and today I believe that we could show that the word of God has already established the direct connection between your state of mind and your well-being and forgiveness it's already a direct connection if you're physically sick then we would be taught in the word of God that if you are physically sick that you ought to seek to be forgiven of anything you've done wrong and if you're going to ask God for anything you should forgive other people also and James said that you may be healed and and Jesus is saying that your heavenly father would forgive you also and there's so many things that we can take in the Proverbs and take to the scripture taking personal experience take from the message of the hour to show that there's a direct Connection in your attitude towards other people and your physical and mental well-being and now science I could say agrees but science is uncovering it themselves Hope College in Michigan was looking at the effects of forgiveness versus holding a grudge and this is one of their conclusions forgiveness May free the wounded person from a prison of hurt in vengeful emotion yielding both emotional and physical benefits including reduced stress less less negative emotion fewer cardiovascular problems and improved immune system performance forgiveness frees the wounded person you may think that what you need is an all-out uh no qualifications open face apology from the offender in order for you to be free from their prison but you can be free on your own accord by forgiving without even an apology on their part you can free yourself you can forgive them and you can get off the hook also and you put way too much power still in the offender's hands to be to bring you down and carry it this unhappiness to carry this Grudge and you're putting they will just apologize if they would just apologize I wouldn't have to die from this and all you have to do is forgive them showing that you have more power showing that you have the character showing that you haven't been destroyed that you haven't been forsaken that I could stand upon the promise of who I am and this and forgiveness will even elevate your own self-esteem you free the Forgiveness freeze the the victim freeze the wounded from a prison of hurt and vengeful emotion and it yields an emotional and physical benefit in the next slide research has shown that forgiveness is linked to mental health outcomes such as reduced anxiety depression in major psychiatric disorders as well as with fewer physical health symptoms and a lower mortality rates this is a conclusion another study reduced anxiety this is think about this reduced anxiety depression and major psychiatric disorders and fewer physical health problems and lower mortality rates lower mortality rates from what forgiveness research has shown that forgiveness is linked to lower mortality rates it's exactly what brother Branham is saying the people who don't forget die early right people who don't forgive hold grudges he's saying that they have higher mortality rates if you're just going to put it in a more scientific language they can already prove that men that hold grudges have higher mortality rates than those who don't and now we come to the science of the last five decades and they're saying we can see that there's a link between forgiveness and mental health outcomes that even relate to lower mortality rates people who are taught how to forgive become less angry feel less hurt are more optimistic become more forgiven in a variety of situations and become more compassionate and self-confident this is remarkable now I'm just referencing scientific studies that have looked at the act of forgiveness which is a very scriptural principle which it's a uh it's something maybe we haven't spent a lot of time on but I hope that we can all just accept we're referring to a very scriptural principle to forgive and the benefits it has upon the human body so this forgiveness is something that's divine is something that God does it's something that we can see is related to the the creator of the human body and God has made you in such a way toward the act of letting go of something will improve your physical health people who forgive are less angry less hurt more optimistic more self-confident this is a statement from Dr Robert Enright the the head of the international forgiveness Institute the heroic nature of forgiveness is you try I love even the way he phrased it the heroic nature of forgiveness is you try even a little bit to be good to the other person who wronged you he says so when even a little bit when you try the Hope nature forgiveness is you try he says and we find through our science I think this may be the next slide but John that a lot of physiological well-being visits the one who's ready and willing to choose forgiveness this is I mean this we find through science so this Dr Enright is saying that there's something about forgiving and the power of forgiveness that when we forgive and we try to do good or we try to get them off the hook if I could put in those words we find through science that a lot of psychological well-being visits the one who's ready and willing to choose forgiveness and he continues to describe uh there's a lot of different situations that they've used in in Nations that have been War torn and there's been acts of genocide and there's been very specific uh characteristic terroristic things done uh direct hurts where even they're able to bring people who are the terrorists and those who've been impacted by it in these African countries in a lot of different places they've done these studies very real world scientific studies of people who've been hurt and been harmed and the power and and the the one who's been the the offender and the one that's been the offended and they've looked at and examined the process of offering forgiveness to the one who's hurt you and they've been able to look at this and they've used examples of people who have been the atrocities done against them they're they're just even to the way I couldn't even describe them in public to you and this doctor concluded that a lot of he says people who have been brutalized by life when they willingly it's the next slide willingly choose to forgive people who've been brutalized by life to the people who just kind of gone through a rough day and they have a boss who's a little bit too demanding people have been brutalized by life when they willingly choose to forgive depression can go down anxiety go down post-traumatic stress can go down toxic anger can go down and you know what goes up self-esteem he said well that that that's science no that's how God's made the human body science is only making the observations this isn't a scientific formula this isn't science trying to tell us how we got here they got their theories in terms of how we got here by a big bang or something but now they're looking at how everything's unfolded and these are observable effects upon a person that when they exercise forgiveness even people who've been brutalized by life when they willingly choose to forgive depression can go down anxiety go down post-traumatic stress can go down toxic anger can go down and your self-esteem can go up why because it's just a truth that relates to the person that the Bible has been telling us about for centuries it's the very reason why Jesus says in Mark 11 25 and when you stand praying forgive to forgive it's an expression of divine faith I want you to look at that way you're you're willing to forgive is an expression of your faith not weakness it's an expression of divine faith is an expression of the love and nature of Christ to forgive somebody who has hurt you and again this may be a very narrow context and I'm and I'm bringing it up within the subject matter of our physical healing and so this may become applicable sometime to you it may be relevant right now for some of us to realize wow my PTSD is directly related to the fact that I'm holding on to the things that have been done to me I'm not choosing to forgive and therefore my depression and anxiety in this state of anger maintains this consistent level and what I really need to do is stop it stop trying to bury it or stop obsessing about it and just forgive and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna uh I guess I'm trying to find the right word I'm not going to disrespect you by implying that you need to move on or get over it that's not assumed at all in forgiveness it's just it's the act of forgiving letting it go maybe there's not maybe it's not entirely built upon this idea that well I forgive them and and you're forgiven you don't have the power to remove the consequence people when they act and they do things you can forgive somebody but that doesn't mean you have to go uh you have to go defend you have to go up here at the parole here and say well I I forgave them so I guess you should let him out of prison forgiveness isn't forgiveness is something you do in your heart it's letting go of any desire to see uh uh to to require some exacting of blood or Revenge for you to be whole to be able to go go and be healed and the message perfect faith and I'm making a little bit of a pivot here because none of us stand here is sinless so I need to say I'm sorry and none of us I mean I'd even go as far as these young men on the front row they've lived long enough to be able to forgive somebody else so we all would stand in the position either to be the one that has offended or the one that has been offended and I think this scripture or this statement is so beautiful because it can address us as the one who's done something wrong and when we were Sinners alienated without God in the world and that muck of mud as I talked about this morning God came to us God sought you you never sought God no man can come to me except the father draws him first and God came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look at what you were and look what you are what did that somebody that loved you could we do that tonight the grace that has placed Us in this church tonight to be sitting in these chairs hearing the word of God to think what did that to me a God that loved me what has kept you through all the turns and all the disappointments and all the health battles all the emotional difficulties all the relationship changes everything that you've endured I I'm sure that there's somebody somewhere who has their fantasy league of Believers never thought that you would make it this far ah right there's no way in the world they're going to make it there's no way they're going to keep going they might have thought since you didn't go to their church anymore that you were backslid and you ran away and you're lost but look where you are still believing still hold on what did that somebody that loved you did that if you could just recognize the love of God that pursues you he says can't you have faith in what he's promised you then what is what is he wanting to point your faith to not how good you are not your sickness not not all these other things to where it's your faith against the sickness he's wanting to bring you all the way back to a forgiveness all the way back to a God who who sent the sacrifice of his son who shed blood has Justified you picked you up out of the muck of mud and he says what changed you he said love did that and if God can forgive you of your sins justify you and place his spirit inside of you then can't you have faith in the other things he's promised a real genuine love will create a confidence in his word and maybe it's this statement that turns the focus directly on all of us whether we need forgiveness or we need to forgive because sometimes the hardest person to forgive is ourselves and we're way too hard on ourselves and and and not only are we just too hard on ourselves we don't ever give ourselves the benefit of the doubt we're never going to let ourselves off the hook we're never gonna we never think our sorry is good enough we're and you just keep and you're not even willing to accept the Forgiveness of your savior and a Divine love that is so perfect to complete and maybe who we need to forgive as ourselves what did that somebody that loved you in Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 6 it says for in Christ Jesus Christ neither circumcision of eileth anything nor uncircumcision what matters what avails what counts Faith which worketh by love Faith which is operative it's at work Faith which is just to display one's activity which is the word faith which displays its activity by love faith is displayed by love and as we've taken the time to these last two services and I say maybe a little bit more and sowing some of the breadcrumbs to this the scriptures connect the prayer of faith shall save the sick to forgiveness asking and having faith in God it connects it back to forgiveness this asking this uh this Desiring When you pray you see so much comes back to this idea and this concept of forgiveness and so that whether we are asking for forgiveness or whether we are granting it the scriptures connecting that principle to what we receive and we ask in faith believing and faith is connected to love it says faith which worketh by love Faith manifests its power through love and what took you out of the mud and made you what you are today love did forgiveness did in the message perfect faith brother Rama says that faith is the master of all circumstances and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a God is the very essence of love Faith and love work together I'm wanting to if I could express it this way I mentioned it a moment ago I'm wanting you to look at that you have to have faith and I think it's just really beautiful and I if I fail to if it doesn't come out in a way that uh it makes sense to you it's my fault okay but when I think about how we're we need faith for the moment we need Faith to be healed we need Faith to act whatever it is we need faith for and that faith and this love work together and so love is they're working together Faith Works by love or it's displays itself in the love that's being made manifest and then God's love for us was displayed in that he forgave us of our sins so you're wanting to have faith for your own healing and you can exercise that Faith by displaying love you can exercise that faith if you want to say I can exercise that Faith by displaying love back to God to trust God to believe in God but I'm even looking at the sense of your character your attitude how you treat other people if I could say this and I'm not saying it to be a joke if you want to be healed be nice [Music] we say God brother bam says in another places God heals by kind words and maybe we always thought that meant words people say to us but maybe it's your own words maybe we thought well if somebody would just say something nice to me I'd be healed of this chronic condition maybe if you would just say something nice to somebody else you could be healed of your chronic condition because an exercise of your faith is going to be displayed in your love the love that you have for one another the love that you have for Humanity right I say no wonder sicknesses are on the increase because everybody hates everybody it's there's so much there's such a state of agitation and people are getting more and more ridiculous as they get more and more polarized and entrenched and and we as Christians ought to be able to stand in such a way to where you're not going to make win everybody not everybody's going to agree with you and you're not gonna be able to make everybody happy but we don't have to become negative and cynical and bitter and critical like everybody else has become and we can demonstrate our love we can demonstrate our faith by practicing love to forgive people who've heard us and people have offended us in the sermon desperations brother says the only way that you can have faith is have love first because after all faith is Love's incentive it's a thing that motivates encourages one to do something this is the only place he says this and brings these two things together so he's not necessarily fully developing this thought so what at least what it does is it enters into our minds to begin to think about how faith and love work together and there's an incentive and the way that he says it Faith motivates love it motivates action incentive that's what faith is it's an incentive to love Faith motivates love Faith motivates action if you don't have love you can't have faith and you can't have faith in your wife if you don't love her he said how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her and that's infilio now how about an agapa love agape love to God what an incredible principle I feel bad now for bringing it up at 8 18 on a Wednesday night because I need to end but what an amazing principle that in the way that I ought to be able to demonstrate myself towards my wife says even the filio that I can't have love I can't have faith in her if I don't love her and the love I have towards her develops his faith and it it inspires this faith and this confidence and then therefore this uh faith it motivates my love this confidence motivates my love and if I could say that it's God's love to us and through his love to us that he forgave us and we love him because he first loved us and I know this is just a just a part of it I'm trying to point us back to this forgiveness to be able to say I forgive you I forgive them I forgive to be able to say I forgive that is a function of love that's a function of our faith and he says just and again we're running out of time but just look in the old context of your relationships if you're not going to be willing to forgive your spouse then how could you even say you feel your love and think about what it does to a relationship when somebody when somebody Harbors something won't let it go and just lets it eat eat and eat and somebody may do something very very very very very wrong but the power is in the person's heart to Out of Love forgive and not be bound or on that hook anymore and he said we've got to be able to do that with one another well last time it was where he says if you kept from your heart when you can't forgive every person from the very depths of your heart no matter what they've done or what they've said he says something's wrong if you can't forgive them from the depth just talking about forgiveness if somebody if I if if I borrowed your car let's say if I borrowed uh brother brother Micah's Tesla and I just shattered the rims on a curb he could forgive me of that right absolutely forgive me of that but that doesn't mean he needs to give me the biometric card or whatever it is you use to start a Tesla it doesn't mean he has to let me drive his car again right over there and I love you I trust you your wonderful friend and I completely forgive you but why don't you live you land the car again well I'm just using more reason this time and more I'm exercising discretion or whatever it might be and so the act of forgiveness let's not assume what that means going forward let's not try to figure out what the consequences are going to be just think of how much Freedom there's going to be in your own life and how much more access you can have to the faith you need for your healing or the answers you need to give get when you can just forgive yeah I think some people have Twisted forgiveness so much that they think forgiveness is just continuing to stay in the situation they're in and get beat up over and over and over and over again and they don't they're not willing to make the changes they need to spiritually Thrive because they don't understand what forgiveness is what about God's love hey that's that's that's the comparison he's making what about God's love in First Peter Chapter 4 verses 8 to 9. just leaving this scripture here maybe just touch on it very very quickly above all things have fervent charity among yourselves Above All Things the guy Peter's place in this this is the Capstone that we could say to the Statue of a perfect man that we Above All Things ought to have Paul would even place it above all we're seeking after charity I'll just the the the the harmony amongst the scriptures here above all things have fervent charity among yourselves and it says for charity shall cover the multitude of sins what a statement Charities shall cover the multitude of sins I believe that speaks to our forgiveness not that we justify a pardon or hide but it shall cover the multitude of sins and then it says use Hospitality one to another without grudging that if we can have this fervent charity among ourselves then we'd be able to serve one another live for others without The Grudge without the resentment and what is being what what forgiveness is when it says Let There Be fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins this is an expression of Christian love a kind of love that can forgive offenses against ourselves this is what the scripture is refer to Charities shall cover the multitude it says Let There have this fervent charity among yourselves because we're going to need this kind of love to exist with one another seriously just think about it we've had we've been a church for just two years now some of you have been fellowship with this much shorter than that we've only been a church for two years and listen that's all you need to rub somebody the wrong way is a couple years right there really is no honeymoon period when it comes to Finn the wrong way hit a soft spot and we've all got to have it if we're gonna be a Christian church if you're going to be the body of Christ that's going to thrive you can't get that prickly corrosive kind of nature where unless everybody just treats you perfectly you're never going to be happy we've got to start having the love of God in our hearts right I'm sick and tired of pastoring people who don't have to love a God in their heart right no we've got to have the love of God our hearts toward one another we've got to have fervent charity some of you don't know what I was quoting somebody so we've got to have this kind of love for one another for others if we're to do good unto all men I say you're doing good when you can forgive people letting it go I think I mentioned this on Sunday and I'm going to close now have you just uh one more statement I want to read from the perfect faith but this so astounded me here recently to recognize that the word agape love that we use of this love of a higher intelligence a love that is used that is associated with God and brother Brown makes that division that feel or love is more this visceral feeling emotion this passion that we have in our in our flesh that you might love something and it it's more of that it's an Earthly love and takes agape love and he makes it more of a Heavenly love it's a love of higher intelligence a love with purpose and one of the elements to agape love it involves offering love to somebody when it's hard to do it that's what that's that's what makes agape love what it is it's really easy to love the guy who gives you a cash gift for no reason right like I love that guy just always giving me hundreds hey that that that's not that's not agape love that might just be common sense right that's a filial love but love of a higher intelligence is to be able to offer love to someone when it's hard to or when somebody doesn't necessarily in our own estimation deserve it come on somebody isn't that how we receive the Divine love of God we never merited it we never earned it and he loved us while we were yet sinners while we were undeserving when we were unlovable when we would have been hard to accept hard to receive he had a love for us and it was that love that broke us down that's the kind of love that can break people down when you look past the veneer when you look past the pretense when you can look past all their harms and all their hurts and all their difficulties and all their hardness and their rough exterior and you can be able to say I still love you and offer for forgiveness to someone even when it's hard to it could be the very thing that can break somebody down that's what Jesus did upon the cross when he cried out father forgive them for they know not what they do I think we mentioned it Sunday they there it was clear they were guilty it's clear that he was innocent and he didn't hang up on the cross rarling and ranting of the Injustice I'm innocent They Crucified it innocent man I shouldn't be here they're wrong you guys are all gonna you're wrong no father forgive them for they know not what they do our healing is connected with forgiveness and this is to me the Clincher I originally was going to read this at the very beginning on Sunday but it's say that for the very end tonight at Wednesday night brother ma'am says faith is based on forgiveness faith is based on forgiveness as we said this morning trying to get the church into a place to where we can really see Apostolic times moving among us remember faith is based on forgiveness that will all hunger and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it what Apostolic times we want it such a flow that will be a help to us and US flow out to others and that faith is based on forgiveness so that it can flow to help us and flow out to others we're going to have to have forgiveness whether we say I'm sorry or able to say Lord I forgive we're going to have to have it in the context of Christ My Healer in order for us to be healed I think it's very clear in the scripture we spent some time tonight to even show where science is recognizing the benefit of letting things go in no way am I trying to trivialize what you've been through I'm trying to lift up just how extraordinary and great forgiveness is and no matter how much we try to emphasize how great forgiveness is it's never in any way to trivialize what you've been through it's just to show that no matter what you've experienced forgiveness is greater forgiveness is more powerful than what's been done to you and we love you tonight thank you so much for being here God bless you musicians would come if we could stand together
