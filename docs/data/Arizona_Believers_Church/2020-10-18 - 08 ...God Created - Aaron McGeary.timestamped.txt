[0:00] Ezekiel CH 28:1 it says moreover the
[0:03] word of the Lord came unto me saying son
[0:06] of man take up lamentation upon the king
[0:09] of Tyrus and we realize that this is
[0:12] actually um
[0:15] spoken also speaks of Lucifer and Satan
[0:18] so he says thus sayith the Lord God thou
[0:21] seest up the sum full of wisdom and
[0:24] perfect in Beauty thou Hast been in Eden
[0:26] the Garden of God every precious stone
[0:29] was thy covering the Sardis topaz and
[0:31] the diamond the Burl the Onyx and the
[0:33] Jasper the sapphire the emerald and the
[0:35] carbuncle and gold the workmanship of
[0:38] thy tabrets and of thy pipes was
[0:40] prepared in thee in the day that thou
[0:41] was created Thou Art the anointed cherub
[0:44] that
[0:45] coverthe thee so thou was upon the holy
[0:48] mountain of God thou Hast walked up and
[0:50] down in the midst of the stones of fire
[0:53] thou was perfect in thy ways from the
[0:55] day that thou was created till iniquity
[0:58] was found in thee by the multitude of
[1:00] thy merchandise they have filled the
[1:02] midst of thee with violence and thou has
[1:03] sinned therefore I'll cast thee as
[1:05] profane out of the Mountain of God and I
[1:07] will destroy thee Oh covering cherub
[1:10] from the midst of the stones of fire th
[1:12] heart was lifted up because of thy
[1:13] Beauty thou H has corrupted thy wisdom
[1:15] by reason of thy brightness and I will
[1:18] cast thee to the ground I will lay thee
[1:20] before kings that they may behold thee
[1:23] thou Hast defiled the sanctuaries by the
[1:24] multitude of thine iniquities by the
[1:26] iniquity of thy traffic therefore will I
[1:28] bring forth a fire fire from the midst
[1:30] of thee it shall devour thee and I'll
[1:33] bring thee to ashes upon the Earth in
[1:35] the sight of all them that behold thee
[1:38] and they that Know Thee among the people
[1:40] shall be astonished at thee Thou shalt
[1:42] be a terror and never shalt thou be
[1:45] anymore amen you may be
[1:51] seated we've been uh speaking on the
[1:53] subject of in the beginning and we're
[1:56] wanting to continue in that subject you
[1:58] notice how a robust it gets whenever I
[2:00] give the title that's by Design it's a
[2:04] feature not a flaw but we've been
[2:06] ministering on in the beginning and I
[2:09] want to take just a step further
[2:11] continue on the same subject examining
[2:13] the same scripture Genesis 1:1 in the
[2:15] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[2:17] Earth and I want just to maybe take a
[2:20] step further because we're going to
[2:21] start focusing more on the creation
[2:23] itself and uh and picking up on where we
[2:26] were last time but look at God created
[2:29] in the beginning God created and as we
[2:32] were looking at that um just want to
[2:35] express a few things in the beginning
[2:37] just to uh lay a foundation of what we
[2:39] were speaking on last Sunday when it
[2:42] says God created this is now an
[2:44] expression of God himself and as he
[2:47] created it was by Divine wisdom and
[2:50] divine understanding so when God created
[2:52] he had a purpose in doing it so it was
[2:54] purpose-based he had a a focus and a
[2:57] drive that he had when he began to
[2:58] create and it so it's thought- driven
[3:00] there's something behind it that was
[3:02] causing God to act and when God created
[3:06] as we read in the creation in Genesis
[3:07] chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2 this is
[3:09] the act of God establishing things and
[3:12] establishing Destiny determining
[3:14] destination and so we looked at as
[3:16] Elohim the architect the one who existed
[3:19] by himself who had these thoughts within
[3:21] himself and he had a plan he had a
[3:23] blueprint he had something that he was
[3:25] wanting to accomplish something that he
[3:27] was wanting to achieve we might call it
[3:28] a masterpiece an artist but he had these
[3:31] thoughts within himself and he wanted to
[3:33] bring those thoughts into expression and
[3:36] he does that by creation and we were
[3:38] looking specifically how that God's
[3:40] thoughts are different than our thoughts
[3:43] we say well I think I want to run a
[3:44] marathon well I could think that all day
[3:46] long I could think that for the rest of
[3:47] my life I probably never will run a
[3:49] marathon but if God has a thought it's
[3:51] not just something fleeting it's not
[3:53] just something like a fancy that he's
[3:55] having at the moment but his thoughts
[3:57] are real and they have an eternal
[3:59] quality to them he's not like those of
[4:01] us who draw something up on a piece of
[4:03] paper and say oh one day I'd like to do
[4:05] this God's thoughts are real and they
[4:07] are Eternal and brother bradam said if
[4:10] you can see this you can see many things
[4:13] speaking about the thoughts of God and
[4:14] how they are real and they are Eternal
[4:16] he says if you can see this you can see
[4:18] many things and in that vein and in that
[4:21] channel of him establishing that God's
[4:23] thoughts have substance they have
[4:24] reality and there's something that of of
[4:27] weight and significance he says the BR
[4:29] Pride was already in his mind he says
[4:32] yes she was she was existing in his
[4:34] thoughts so in the moment that God began
[4:37] to create he is already existing we he
[4:39] already has these thoughts of us we
[4:41] exist in his mind as thoughts that he's
[4:44] pondering that he's thinking about and
[4:47] the Bible says in genes Jeremiah CH
[4:49] 10:12 speaking of the creation and God
[4:52] he hath made the Earth by his power he
[4:55] hath established the World by his wisdom
[4:57] and hath stretched out the heavens by
[4:59] his discretion so the Earth was made by
[5:02] his power it was established by his
[5:05] wisdom he stretched out the stars and
[5:07] the heavens by his discretion so
[5:09] creation is an expression of God's
[5:12] discretion creation is an expression of
[5:15] God's wisdom creation is an expression
[5:17] of God's power and it was made by his
[5:19] wisdom it was made by his power we look
[5:22] at the heavens why are the heavens
[5:23] established the way that they are it was
[5:25] God's discretion it wasn't by uh
[5:28] circumstance it wasn't by God merely
[5:30] saying well we're just going to create a
[5:32] gravitational pool and just where
[5:34] everything settles that's the way it's
[5:35] going to be but God had an intent and he
[5:37] had a purpose in the way that he laid
[5:39] things out and even man has seen the
[5:41] pattern in the stars and seen the
[5:43] symbolisms in the Stars which was God's
[5:45] first Bible so he's made the Earth by
[5:48] his power he's established the World by
[5:50] his wisdom and then brother brandham
[5:52] says God made the Earth he made it for a
[5:55] purpose to take a church out of it a
[5:57] bride so when God made the Earth in the
[5:59] beginning when God created he had
[6:01] thoughts those thoughts are real they
[6:03] are Eternal and at the very center of
[6:06] those thoughts and at the very center of
[6:07] his heart was the bride she was already
[6:10] in his mind already in his heart so when
[6:12] he made the Earth he made it for the
[6:14] purpose of getting a bride out of it now
[6:16] to me to have that understanding changes
[6:19] everything about creation that it wasn't
[6:22] God conducting an experiment it wasn't
[6:24] God saying what I'll do is I'll just
[6:25] create a massive Humanity give everyone
[6:27] free moral agency we'll just kind of see
[6:29] how this shakes out in the end but
[6:31] rather God fornew all things God had a
[6:34] purpose God had an intent and he made
[6:36] the Earth to get a bride out of it so if
[6:38] God made the Earth for something he's
[6:40] going to get what he wants you say that
[6:42] about God God gets what he wants and he
[6:45] and brother branam writes the heart
[6:46] purpose the Eternal purpose of God was
[6:49] to take a bride of his own choosing so
[6:52] these are things that God this intent he
[6:54] had in the beginning this purpose that
[6:55] God had in the beginning his heart
[6:57] purpose the very Central purpose of God
[6:59] is very at his very essence his eternal
[7:02] purpose was to take a bride of his own
[7:04] choosing he wanted to have a people like
[7:06] unto himself that that he would call a
[7:08] bride that he could have fellowship with
[7:11] and and and expressing it in terms of
[7:13] bride it's it's to he wants relationship
[7:16] he wants communion he wants to have this
[7:18] continuity with one and that's what God
[7:20] wanted in the beginning he wanted to
[7:21] have someone that he could have
[7:22] fellowship with and and the the reason
[7:25] why we just keep visiting this subject
[7:27] each time and we're looking at here in
[7:30] the this subject of in the beginning and
[7:31] as we establish things here the
[7:33] objective is not just historical and not
[7:36] just informative that we could have more
[7:38] data that we can uh load into our our
[7:40] scriptural database but rather the
[7:42] objective is to see
[7:44] ourselves is to look into the Bible as a
[7:46] mirror and to see ourselves and the
[7:48] Beautiful uh the beautiful time and
[7:50] season that we're living in is we have a
[7:52] message that is placing the bride in her
[7:55] ordained position not just merely
[7:58] traveling through a stations are
[8:00] traveling through time and and traveling
[8:02] through a particular prophecy but we've
[8:03] arrived at a time where the bride is
[8:05] being placed in ordained position so God
[8:08] what he wanted in the beginning God is
[8:10] achieving now in the
[8:12] end I we want that to be very personal
[8:15] and it should be very personal to you
[8:18] now this is a little still a little bit
[8:20] of review but it starts to touch on the
[8:22] subject uh that I've I've been pondering
[8:24] uh very heavy in my heart over this past
[8:27] two weeks and we we begin to touch on it
[8:29] last week brother brandham says the very
[8:32] creator that created the Earth for a
[8:33] purpose so we know that God created the
[8:35] Earth for a purpose the purpose he
[8:38] created it for is to get a bride out of
[8:39] it he says Satan defiled it so you have
[8:43] God the Creator Satan the defiler God
[8:46] created the Earth for a purpose and then
[8:48] Satan now seeing God's creation he
[8:50] actually defiles that creation and
[8:53] that's what that Satan's purpose is to
[8:55] obscure God's purpose Satan's agenda is
[8:58] to make God's will cloudy to to make it
[9:00] hard to understand make it kind of make
[9:02] it complicated and Satan hates
[9:04] Revelation we're taught that he hates
[9:06] Revelation and he hates the revelation
[9:08] of the mystery of God so there's things
[9:11] that Satan despises things that Satan
[9:13] hates and you see that here brother and
[9:14] says God created the heavens and the
[9:16] Earth he created it for a purpose and
[9:18] then Satan's Satan is acting to defile
[9:21] that creation so Satan hates the
[9:23] revelation of the mystery of God and it
[9:26] says this and this this scripture is
[9:28] twofold now to kind of create a link to
[9:32] to go further in 2 Corinthians chapter
[9:34] 4:4 says and whom the God of this world
[9:37] which is Satan hath blinded the minds of
[9:40] them which believe not so this is
[9:42] Satan's objective his goal is to Blind
[9:44] the minds of the people he's the God of
[9:46] this evil age he has been building his
[9:48] own Eden so he says he blinds their
[9:51] minds lest the light of the Glorious
[9:53] gospel of Christ who is the image of God
[9:55] should shine unto them so the kingdom of
[9:58] Satan which is dark darkness and death
[10:00] opposes the Light of Christ it opposes
[10:03] Revelation it opposes understanding and
[10:05] that's what Satan is still doing today
[10:07] this is he's characterized as this one
[10:09] who wants to Blind the minds of the
[10:11] people so that they cannot see the light
[10:14] of the Glorious gospel of Christ Satan's
[10:16] always trying to defile God's program
[10:18] always fighting against God's perfect
[10:21] will and now what I want to take out of
[10:24] this is how that we can see that Christ
[10:26] is in the image of God
[10:29] so and and that may seem oh brother
[10:31] Aaron you're really breaking new ground
[10:32] I I know that I'm not but we just want
[10:34] you to think about that that Christ is
[10:37] the image of God now it says in 1
[10:39] Corinthians chapter 1 verse 24 but unto
[10:42] them which are called This is the gospel
[10:44] that Paul preaches he preaches Christ to
[10:46] them that are called both Jews and
[10:47] Greeks Christ the power of God and the
[10:50] wisdom of God so Paul preaches the
[10:53] Glorious gospel of Christ and Christ who
[10:56] is in the image of God he is also here
[10:58] called the power of God God and the
[11:00] wisdom of God so in the beginning God
[11:03] created the heavens and the earth when
[11:04] we read that in the beginning was the
[11:06] word john11 we see Christ so God created
[11:11] we see Christ creates because he says he
[11:13] created the Earth by his power he
[11:15] established the World by his wisdom so
[11:17] Christ is the power of God Christ is the
[11:19] wisdom of God so we see God creating we
[11:22] have to see Christ and now this now
[11:25] let's join this statement in 2
[11:26] Corinthians chapter 4 Christ is the
[11:28] image of God so Christ is the power and
[11:31] wisdom of God and he's also in the image
[11:34] of God and if you want to say those
[11:36] things are expressed in the same thing
[11:38] certainly it's expressing the same thing
[11:39] Christ is the power of God Christ is the
[11:41] image of God so he's the image of his
[11:43] power he's the image of his wisdom but
[11:45] Christ is in the image of God now in
[11:48] Genesis
[11:49] 1:27 it says so God created man in his
[11:52] own image in the image of God created he
[11:56] him male and female created he them
[12:00] so Christ is the power and wisdom of God
[12:03] it is by Christ that all things exist he
[12:05] created by Christ because he established
[12:08] the World by his wisdom he created the
[12:10] Earth by his power so this is Christ
[12:13] there in the beginning and Christ is the
[12:16] power and wisdom of God and he's also in
[12:18] the image of God and we know the image
[12:20] of God is male and
[12:23] female because it says he created man in
[12:25] His image in the image of God created he
[12:28] him male and female created he them now
[12:31] this isn't One Creation another creation
[12:33] and a third creation he created him in
[12:35] his image and that image held that image
[12:39] contained male and female his brother
[12:42] Brandon when he's teaching in marriage
[12:44] and divorce and he he's talking about
[12:46] the woman and her position and even how
[12:48] Satan has been her designer a and the
[12:51] place that a woman has come to today he
[12:53] says God has male and female now you
[12:56] could look out and you could see
[12:57] something that is the wrong kind of
[12:59] expression an ungodly per expression of
[13:01] something he say just because you see
[13:03] the perversion doesn't mean there's not
[13:05] a genuine he says God does have male and
[13:07] female so in God there was an expression
[13:11] of Christ and in Christ there is an
[13:13] expression of of Bride and bridegroom if
[13:17] we could put it that
[13:19] way in Ephesians chapter 3: 9
[13:23] to10 we're just kind of laying these
[13:25] principles down um piece by piece just
[13:28] to kind of get get to a spot to go
[13:30] further today now Paul again as he's
[13:32] already expressed to the Corinthians uh
[13:35] he's preaching the gospel and his desire
[13:37] and he as he preaches the gospels to
[13:38] make all men see what is the Fellowship
[13:41] of the mystery which from the beginning
[13:43] of the world hath been hid in God who
[13:46] created All Things by Jesus Christ this
[13:49] just this really kind of summarizes and
[13:51] sums up some of these things were saying
[13:53] at the outset that God created All
[13:56] Things by Christ the power and wisdom of
[13:59] God Christ who is in the image of God
[14:01] and this was and he creates as he
[14:04] creates he's expressing something within
[14:06] himself and Paul says I want to preach a
[14:08] word that brings us all into the
[14:10] fellowship the mystery that's been hid
[14:12] in God since the time he began to create
[14:15] that God as he began to create had a
[14:17] hidden purpose he had a he had something
[14:18] he was wanting to achieve goes I want to
[14:21] preach a gospel that brings us into
[14:22] Fellowship of the mystery that has been
[14:25] hid in uh from uh since the beginning of
[14:27] the world hid in God and then he
[14:29] continues to the intent that now or for
[14:32] the purpose that now God in the
[14:34] beginning created All Things by Jesus
[14:36] Christ when he created in the beginning
[14:38] there was a mystery that was hid in him
[14:40] but now I want to preach a gospel to the
[14:42] intent that now under the principalities
[14:44] and powers in Heavenly places might be
[14:47] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[14:49] of God that's a that's a a sentence that
[14:52] would be a lot of fun to
[14:54] diagram so your homeschooling moms maybe
[14:56] you could do that with your third
[14:58] graders tomorrow have them diagram this
[15:00] sentence but this is how one translation
[15:02] renders it so that now through the
[15:05] church the fullness of the wisdom of God
[15:07] might be made known to rulers and
[15:09] authorities in Heavenly places so they
[15:12] want they want the Paul is saying I want
[15:14] the wisdom of God to be made known I
[15:16] want the full wisdom of God the the full
[15:19] manifestation of God's wisdom the
[15:20] fullness of God's power I want it to be
[15:22] made known but not in the heavens and
[15:25] not through Jesus Christ but rather
[15:27] through the church if we can all come
[15:29] into the Fellowship of the mystery so
[15:31] that now the fullness of the wisdom of
[15:33] God may be made known to rulers and
[15:35] authorities through God's body so the
[15:39] purpose now is not that wisdom and power
[15:41] would exist in the heavenlies it's not
[15:43] pointing back historically to wisdom and
[15:45] power that existed in Jesus Christ but
[15:48] by the word of God the full wisdom of
[15:50] God might be known to rulers and
[15:52] authorities well who are those spiritual
[15:54] wickedness in high places that the power
[15:57] of God be be be would be made known
[16:00] through the church manifesting the
[16:02] mystery so the wisdom and power of God
[16:04] is in the in the body of
[16:06] Christ the wisdom and power of God is in
[16:09] his church it's in his
[16:11] people now to to see how uh maybe the
[16:15] ultimate the the ultimate Triumph of
[16:17] this in Genesis 3:1
[16:21] 15 he speaking now a curse to The
[16:26] Serpent and as this curse Goes Forth
[16:30] uh and and and and concludes with the
[16:31] cursing of the earth and the cursing of
[16:33] man and the woman uh brother bam teaches
[16:35] us that that closes the beginning now
[16:37] once the curse has gone forward uh and
[16:39] Mankind is ushered out of this Eden
[16:42] condition then that ends the beginning
[16:45] and that the Fallen creation goes
[16:47] forward from there so as God speaks to
[16:50] the serpent he says I'll put enity
[16:52] between thee and the woman and between
[16:54] thy seed the seed of the serpent between
[16:57] thy seed and her seed if it shall bruise
[16:59] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[17:04] so when when they read this we realize
[17:06] that this is a prophecy of Christ that
[17:08] this prophesies the Redeemer it's such a
[17:11] beautiful a beautiful statement we read
[17:13] it's a curse to one but yet in it it
[17:15] prophesies of a redeemer it's
[17:17] prophesying that the seed of the woman
[17:19] would come and that it would bruise the
[17:21] head of the serpent now the Hebrew there
[17:24] that is used I'm G try to get this to
[17:27] work well there we go let me go
[17:31] back um the Hebrew word that's used here
[17:35] this is the Hebrew that word is it would
[17:38] be in our English he she or it and so
[17:41] when it's translated here it's
[17:43] translated to it now we understand that
[17:46] this word would speak of Christ but
[17:48] there's many different translations that
[17:50] not only render it uh take it out of the
[17:53] it but they also translate it to she and
[17:56] that that it's it's it's suggested in
[17:59] the meaning I will put enity between
[18:01] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[18:03] and her seed and it not instead of it
[18:05] rendering it it says she shall bruise
[18:07] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[18:10] so the the word here he she or it it
[18:12] could be a prophecy of he which is
[18:14] Christ but it's also a prophecy of she
[18:17] which is the bride Paul in in or habac
[18:20] chapter 2 it says the vision is yet for
[18:23] an appointed time at the end it shall
[18:25] speak it will not t so it's referred to
[18:28] as an but then Paul in Hebrews chapter
[18:30] 10 referring to the same scripture says
[18:33] he will not t so the he the it is no
[18:36] longer just an it it's now a he the
[18:38] vision is not an it it is a he and so
[18:40] here we could read well yes it's he
[18:41] shall bruise thy head but there's a time
[18:44] when he becomes a
[18:46] she and so there it's not just uh
[18:49] speaking of him but it's speaking of
[18:51] her and it's not just speaking of Mary
[18:54] because Mary was a type but it speaks of
[18:57] the mystery of God at the end time
[18:59] where it says in Romans chapter 16:20
[19:01] and the God of Peace shall bruise Satan
[19:03] under your feet
[19:05] shortly so Paul connect catches this
[19:08] it's not he shall bruise thy Hill but
[19:11] also she shall or shall bruise his head
[19:14] she shall bruise thy head because it's
[19:16] under the feet of the body of Christ
[19:18] under she under her feet under the
[19:20] bride's feet will Satan be crushed
[19:22] shortly so when we read in the beginning
[19:25] God created the heavens and the Earth
[19:27] Christ is the power and wisdom of God
[19:30] Christ is the image of God that image is
[19:32] male and female the bride is the power
[19:35] and wisdom of God don't don't make God
[19:38] some far off God that you're trying to
[19:40] to reach and trying to contact you have
[19:42] Affinity with him you have a connection
[19:44] with him brother Bram says in fact in
[19:46] her the bride is summed up and
[19:48] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[19:51] purpose of God so when you is summed up
[19:55] it's the summation it's the completeness
[19:57] in you is summed up and manif ested the
[19:59] Eternal wisdom and purpose of
[20:02] God my what what beautiful thoughts that
[20:06] he has towards us
[20:10] now now I'm going to have a I want to
[20:12] take some time to go through a number of
[20:15] statements that when we say it it might
[20:17] just be as simple as just okay we'll put
[20:19] that there we'll put that there and
[20:21] these are just things that will be kind
[20:22] of laying out um before you now follow
[20:26] if you could in this statement here
[20:28] brother B says God had a purpose and a
[20:31] mystery so God had a hidden purpose he
[20:34] had a hidden Mystery and that's what I
[20:35] want to speak on to the church this
[20:37] morning the hidden Mystery of God that
[20:40] he had in his mind before the world ever
[20:42] began so when he preaches Christ is the
[20:45] mystery God revealed he's talking about
[20:47] the God having a purpose God having a
[20:49] hidden Mystery that he had in his mind
[20:51] before the world ever began and he says
[20:53] and how that it's unfolded itself right
[20:56] down to the present hour that we're
[20:57] living in then you will understand
[20:59] clearly you'll see what I believe what
[21:02] is being done so if you can catch what
[21:05] is the mystery of God that's unfolded to
[21:07] the present hour he says then I think
[21:09] you can see clearly what is being done
[21:11] what is unfolding what is happening now
[21:13] he says in a couple paragraphs later the
[21:15] entire Bible is an expression of one
[21:19] goal that God had one purpose he wanted
[21:22] to achieve in the entire Bible brother
[21:25] BR is distilling the entire Bible down
[21:27] to one purpose
[21:29] is a hidden Mystery a hidden purpose
[21:31] that God had in his mind before the
[21:32] world ever began he says it's unfolded
[21:35] to where we're living now and he says
[21:36] the entire Bible is an expression of
[21:38] this one thing that God wanted to
[21:40] achieve and then he says all the acts of
[21:42] the Believers in the Bible have been in
[21:44] type and expressing what God God's Great
[21:47] goal is so now every example in the
[21:50] Bible should be viewed as an expression
[21:53] or a type of what God is ultimately
[21:55] wanting to achieve and now in the last
[21:58] day he has revealed it and shows it and
[22:01] God's help well you'll see it right here
[22:03] this morning what the Lord has had in
[22:05] his mind all along and has expressed
[22:08] it so this is this is the theme of
[22:11] Christ as the mystery God revealed the
[22:13] hidden purpose of God that he was that
[22:16] was in himself in the beginning this
[22:18] hidden Mystery that was in his mind
[22:19] that's unfolded itself to the present
[22:21] day that the Bible is an expression of
[22:24] this one goal this one thing he wanted
[22:26] to achieve that all the lives and act of
[22:28] the Believers throughout time and
[22:30] history is just expressing what his
[22:32] great goal is and then in this last days
[22:34] God reveals it that's quite a statement
[22:38] that that's that's uh that's really uh
[22:40] really really heavy stuff now I I can
[22:43] just distill this down to this brother
[22:46] BR in Christ is the mystery God revealed
[22:48] says there's a three-fold purpose that
[22:50] God had a three-fold purpose of for
[22:52] Christ and he said his first purpose was
[22:54] to manifest himself in Christ to
[22:57] manifest himself perfectly in Christ in
[23:00] the language he uses to describe that
[23:02] first purpose is is groom or Adam it's
[23:05] Christ this is the bridegroom this is
[23:08] the second Adam or the last Adam he
[23:10] types it to Adam this is the first
[23:12] purpose that God would be made manifest
[23:14] in Christ and then the second purpose is
[23:18] the bride pre have preeminence in the
[23:20] bride that would be referred to as the
[23:22] woman or the or the church that he
[23:24] desires to have preeminence in his bride
[23:26] so the first purpose was for God to be
[23:28] expressed in Christ the second purpose
[23:30] was to have preeminence or to be
[23:32] expressed in his body which is his bride
[23:34] and then the third purpose was to be
[23:36] restored back to the Garden of Eden so
[23:39] that's what brother Bram was talking
[23:40] about he had a purpose he had a hidden
[23:42] Mystery these are the three folds to it
[23:44] you have husband you have wife you have
[23:46] a Garden of Eden you have groom you have
[23:48] bride you have this Garden of Eden and
[23:50] he calls it a condition or a
[23:52] position so he says
[23:55] this that the three-fold purpose of God
[23:58] God's great mystery is revealed so the
[24:01] in these three different things he's
[24:03] saying they've been revealed I'm laying
[24:04] them out there to you so you understand
[24:06] the first purpose the second purpose the
[24:07] third purpose the three-fold purpose of
[24:09] God's great mystery is revealed God
[24:12] manifested in Christ Christ manifested
[24:14] in the church in order to redeem the
[24:16] Lost Eve back to the original condition
[24:19] in the Garden of Eden so it's a
[24:22] restoration back to the original
[24:24] condition in the Garden of Eden so
[24:25] there's things about that condition that
[24:27] God wants to restores back to he says to
[24:30] restore to the kingdom to its rightly
[24:33] position so it's condition its position
[24:36] we should think of condition first and
[24:38] position first before we think of
[24:41] location we think Garden of Eden Garden
[24:43] of Eden we're thinking well we're going
[24:44] to go back by the river Euphrates or
[24:46] it's it's somewhere in the Middle East
[24:47] and we start thinking of a local we
[24:49] think of traveling we think of a
[24:51] specific coordinates but rather we want
[24:53] to think position and condition first
[24:56] before we think of a location
[25:00] and so here's a few statements that
[25:01] brother bradam makes to to emphasize
[25:04] this again about this threefold purpose
[25:07] he says and now the Christ in the church
[25:09] is just being made known the whole thing
[25:12] is the revelation of God to take Eve
[25:14] back to her right position again with
[25:17] her husband so Christ who the first fold
[25:19] purpose is now being made known in his
[25:22] church the second purpose and the whole
[25:24] thing is a revelation to take the woman
[25:26] back to her right position again again
[25:28] with her husband he's connected them all
[25:31] together in paragraph 431 he says he
[25:33] brings forth a brid tree which will be
[25:36] the Tree of Life restored back to him as
[25:38] husband and wife in the Garden of Eden
[25:42] now that's a that's a beautiful
[25:43] statement he brings forth a brid tree
[25:46] well what would the bride tree be it's
[25:48] the Tree of Life restored back to him as
[25:51] husband and wife in the Garden of Eden
[25:53] the tree of life is husband and wife in
[25:55] the Garden of Eden the bride tree brings
[25:58] back the Tree of Life husband and wife
[26:00] in the Garden of Eden beautiful poetry
[26:02] and then he says in paragraph 438 the
[26:05] three-fold purpose of God manifested in
[26:08] Adam and Eve so in when brother bram's
[26:10] talking about this purpose or a hidden
[26:12] Mystery that God had in himself in the
[26:13] beginning we're I'm just using these
[26:16] phrases throughout that sermon to see
[26:17] how brother Bram is identifying Christ
[26:19] the bride in this position that they
[26:22] that the man and the woman had in the
[26:24] Garden of Eden and he says the
[26:25] three-fold purpose of God manifested in
[26:28] Adam and Eve in other words God
[26:30] expressed his three-fold purpose when he
[26:32] placed the man and the woman in a
[26:34] perfect Eden now it wasn't the summation
[26:36] it wasn't the completion it wasn't the
[26:38] fullness of it but it was an expression
[26:40] of it the mystery of God the three-fold
[26:43] purpose of God the mystery of God was
[26:45] hid in Adam and Eve the manifestation of
[26:47] Adam and the woman in the Garden of Eden
[26:51] I trust that you're just kind of
[26:52] following me bit by bit here so now he
[26:55] makes this statement predestinated
[26:58] and we are
[27:00] predestinated he says there's the
[27:02] mystery he before Christ or anything
[27:04] else was over the Earth you see his
[27:07] great mystery that he chose the bride
[27:10] now this is what's Central to
[27:12] it and I don't mean this in any
[27:14] disrespectful way there is a way that
[27:17] you could you could um place all the
[27:20] emphasis on Christ but if you leave you
[27:22] out what good has it
[27:24] done you say well we just want to give
[27:26] all the glory to Jesus absolutely
[27:28] absolutely give all praise is due to him
[27:30] and he alone is worthy and no other man
[27:32] can receive worship and and so there's
[27:35] no there's no attempt on my part to take
[27:38] Christ down a few notches or put him in
[27:39] his place but rather if you know who he
[27:42] is it's necessary for you to understand
[27:45] who you are and that's how teaching that
[27:48] perverts the godhead at the end of the
[27:50] day does a disservice to the believer
[27:52] because you lose your fellowship and
[27:53] Oneness with Christ and so he says this
[27:57] great mystery is not just Christ and God
[28:00] always wanted to have a son and he got a
[28:02] son and we're all just kind of
[28:03] Spectators to this beautiful Oneness and
[28:05] we're Spectators to this beautiful
[28:06] Harmony between God and his son but
[28:09] rather his great mystery was that he
[28:10] chose a bride
[28:12] Amen brother Bram says God loved
[28:16] fatherhood and he said in order to
[28:18] become a father he had to become the son
[28:21] he loved fatherhood in order to become a
[28:23] father he had to become the son of man
[28:25] now we see that expressed in
[28:26] relationship between God wanted to be a
[28:29] father so he had to become a son but God
[28:31] wanted to be a husband amen and in order
[28:35] for God to be a husband he has to become
[28:37] a wife so he said God always wanted to
[28:39] have a wife God always wanted to have a
[28:41] wife well then he has to
[28:42] become so he had to become something in
[28:45] order to have it so Central to God's
[28:47] purpose Central to God's desire in order
[28:49] to have a wife he had to become a
[28:50] husband so he had this great mystery he
[28:53] had he chose the bride knowing Eve would
[28:56] fall from disbelieving the word knowing
[29:00] that she would fall now this is where
[29:03] the the the these the two pieces start
[29:05] to come together for the direction that
[29:07] I'm wanting to emphasize he had this
[29:09] great mystery in his heart he chose a
[29:11] bride and he chose the woman knowing
[29:13] that Eve would fall from disbelieving
[29:16] the word knowing that she would fall but
[29:19] he would choose a bride that would not
[29:22] fall so stop bragging right it's his
[29:26] choice predestin ated it's not because
[29:29] we're good enough or because we read
[29:30] well and we can understand Parables but
[29:32] rather it's his grace so he he put Eve
[29:35] upon the basis knowing that she would
[29:37] disbelieve the word and fall but he
[29:39] would choose a bride that would not fall
[29:41] that would hold to that word regardless
[29:42] of what all the rest of the world had to
[29:44] say about it they would hold to that
[29:46] word they are predestinated to stand
[29:48] there the adoption of children by Jesus
[29:51] Christ predestinated the church to that
[29:53] great glorious stand so this adoption is
[29:57] not in her Genesis or her beginning or
[29:59] in her birth but it's in the climax it's
[30:01] in the finishing it's in the end where
[30:03] he says she's predestinated to that
[30:05] great glorious
[30:07] stand so God in the beginning chose a
[30:10] bride and and this was his choosing and
[30:14] he chose her knowing that the woman
[30:17] would fall by disbelieving the
[30:20] word so God in the beginning created
[30:22] with the express purpose of having a
[30:25] wife one like unto him and this was a
[30:28] hidden mystery hidden purpose in his
[30:32] heart so Genesis 2 verse 8 ver 18 and I
[30:36] may skip around a little bit In this
[30:37] passage says the Lord God said it is not
[30:40] good that man should be alone I will
[30:43] make him a help meat for him God created
[30:47] man in His image and in the image of the
[30:51] man was male and
[30:52] female so when God looked upon Adam he
[30:55] saw his own image and that's why God can
[30:58] make this great declaration it is not
[31:00] good for man to be alone because God did
[31:03] not initiate creation to produce a
[31:07] likeness of himself on Earth alone but
[31:09] rather so that he ultimately would never
[31:11] be alone again he desired to have a
[31:14] bride of his own choosing a people like
[31:15] unto himself that he could fellowship
[31:17] with so when Adam is placed upon Earth
[31:19] and he's God upon Earth and he rules all
[31:22] creation God sees the likeness of
[31:25] himself in Adam so that he can bring out
[31:27] a f further mystery says it's not good
[31:29] that man should be alone because man
[31:31] being in the image of God held the
[31:33] mystery that there was another part of
[31:35] Adam to be expressed so it says in verse
[31:37] 22 and the rib which the Lord God had
[31:39] taken from man made he a woman and
[31:42] brought her unto the man so God said I
[31:45] will make a help meat for him I will
[31:47] take out a second self one complimentary
[31:49] to him one equal but opposite and
[31:52] remember in the beginning the woman was
[31:54] co-equal with the man is in God's origal
[31:58] creation the woman was not made
[32:00] subservient she was not made to rule
[32:02] over him but she was co-equal with Adam
[32:05] as a help meate one complimentary to his
[32:07] purpose so he took the rib from man and
[32:10] made a woman and brought her unto the
[32:12] man and it says and Adam said this is
[32:15] now bone of my bones and Flesh of My
[32:17] Flesh she shall be called woman because
[32:20] she was taken out of man this is the
[32:24] first time that Adam speaks
[32:27] the first time that anyone else is
[32:29] saying anything other than God and it
[32:32] says Adam when he speaks the first thing
[32:34] he speaks of the first thing that he
[32:36] shares the first thing that he says that
[32:38] we have recorded is he speaks of his of
[32:41] the woman this is bone of my bones Flesh
[32:43] of My Flesh she shall be called woman
[32:45] because she was taken out of man so the
[32:49] very first words of this image of God
[32:51] that we have recorded is about the woman
[32:54] and that mirror is the very first
[32:55] thought that God had when he began to
[32:57] create and said let there be light and
[33:00] what have we found when he said let
[33:02] there be light he wasn't just speaking
[33:03] of a of a natural light but he actually
[33:05] speaks of you because now ye are light
[33:08] you are a city set on a hill you are a
[33:11] candle that has been lit and so when he
[33:13] says when God said let there be light
[33:15] the very first thing he spoke of not
[33:17] only represented natural light but it
[33:18] spoke of his body spoke of his people
[33:21] and Adam the first time he speaks this
[33:23] is he sees the woman he speaks this is
[33:25] now bone of my bones and Flesh of My
[33:27] Flesh she shall be called woman because
[33:29] she was taken out of man so Adam can't
[33:32] say well the first time I saw the woman
[33:34] I was speechless no he he immediately
[33:36] began to give a
[33:39] speech and so brother Brandon when he
[33:41] refers to these scriptures he says he is
[33:43] showing portraying here the
[33:46] bride so God is actually portraying
[33:48] something as he said Every Act of the
[33:50] Believers has been an expression of this
[33:52] one purpose that God is wanting to
[33:54] achieve it has been a type so now in
[33:57] Adam God taking the woman out of Adam he
[33:59] was portraying pre foreshadowing or
[34:02] prefiguring the
[34:04] bride God was even though this portrayed
[34:07] her there's still a mysterious element
[34:09] that remains to it God was hiding the
[34:12] full mystery because she's only a
[34:13] prefigure we can't say the woman is now
[34:15] the bride that God wanted to achieve we
[34:18] can just say to Adam now in type she is
[34:20] what God is going to
[34:23] achieve now we can see by these
[34:25] scriptures that the woman comes a
[34:27] different way than Adam did God says I
[34:30] let us make man in our image and he
[34:31] creates man in the image of God but now
[34:36] we're looking at foreshadowing and and a
[34:39] prefigure of the ultimate purpose of God
[34:41] because a three-fold purpose of God he
[34:43] says to manifest himself in Christ well
[34:45] that wasn't in Adam
[34:48] right should I start all over let me go
[34:51] back to Christ as Min God revealed I let
[34:53] me I forgot to turn on the class
[34:54] participation light there we go all
[34:58] right now you know you're allowed to
[34:59] talk when I ask
[35:02] questions but there's when brother B
[35:04] show us the three-fold purpose of Christ
[35:07] it begins with he's emphasizing not the
[35:10] relationship to Adam but he uses Adam as
[35:12] a type so God has manifested himself in
[35:15] his son Jesus Christ so even then in the
[35:18] beginning Adam is just a prefigure Adam
[35:21] is just a type so Adam was not Christ
[35:24] Adam was not the tree of life he was a
[35:28] type so when the woman comes out of Adam
[35:31] God is just expressing and portraying
[35:34] something and in first Timothy 2: 12-
[35:38] 14 he says but I suffer not a woman to
[35:40] teach nor ass Ser authority over the man
[35:43] but to be in silence for Adam was first
[35:46] formed then Eve and Adam was not
[35:49] deceived but the woman being deceived
[35:51] was in the transgression now we could
[35:54] put a lot of blame on the woman and we
[35:55] could be very very harsh and cruel
[35:57] toward towards the woman which we later
[35:59] know to be Eve or she's called Eve but
[36:02] God made it this
[36:04] way we've already read he says he knew
[36:06] that Eve would fall from disbelieving
[36:08] the word knowing that she would fall but
[36:11] he chose a bride that would not fall so
[36:14] then we could conclude that God made it
[36:17] that way that as he's wanting to express
[36:20] something and portray something he has
[36:23] Adam who is a prefigure of Christ who
[36:25] he's in the image of God and he's an
[36:26] expression now for our benefit then he
[36:28] takes the woman out of Adam the way that
[36:31] God brought them forth put her in a
[36:33] place where she could be tempted and
[36:35] would fall and the Bible says she was
[36:37] deceived and therefore in the
[36:39] transgression Adam was not deceived but
[36:41] knowingly
[36:43] transgressed
[36:45] now now this is a this is a lengthy
[36:47] statement and I I want to read it as
[36:49] we've cherry-picked a little bit from
[36:51] this already in the first few parts
[36:53] brother BR says let us go back to the
[36:55] beginning in the original creation as we
[36:58] know it today God made everything in
[37:00] pairs male and female there were two
[37:02] chickens rooster and hen there were two
[37:04] cattle the cow and the bull and right
[37:05] down the line but when it came to man
[37:08] there was only one they were not a pair
[37:11] now this is Brother Braham just showing
[37:13] us uh how when it came to Adam something
[37:17] different took
[37:18] place he says Adam had been had been
[37:22] made in the image of God he was a Son of
[37:25] God as a Son of God he could not be
[37:27] tempted and fall that would be
[37:29] impossible so God took a byproduct of
[37:32] man to cause the fall woman never
[37:35] stepped fresh from the hand of God as a
[37:37] true product of God she was produced
[37:39] from man and when God caused her to be
[37:42] brought forth from man she was vastly
[37:45] different from the other females he had
[37:47] created now this is all for a purpose
[37:50] instead of creating this category oh
[37:51] woman bad woman nasty no he's just we're
[37:54] walking through the difference in
[37:56] creation so that God's attributes could
[37:58] be expressed so she was able to be
[38:00] seduced no other female in creation can
[38:02] be immoral but the human female may be
[38:04] touched at almost any time and that
[38:06] weakness in her allowed Satan to seduce
[38:08] her by the way of The Serpent and has
[38:11] brought the woman to a very peculiar
[38:13] position before God and His word now
[38:18] it's this the fall and and Satan's
[38:21] attack on her brings the woman to A
[38:23] peculiar position now it's through the
[38:26] tempting and the fall that she's brought
[38:28] to A peculiar position because when she
[38:30] comes out of Adam she's bone of his bone
[38:32] flesh of his flesh to say that that
[38:34] would be evil to say that it would be
[38:36] sinful to say that in that expression it
[38:38] was a transgression would be say that
[38:40] Adam was also a transgression or he had
[38:42] it in him but the way that she was
[38:44] brought forth was so was done so that
[38:47] Satan could tempt her and then this is
[38:50] the peculiar position before God in his
[38:52] word and just follow it and notice how
[38:55] God this peculiar position has a real
[38:58] dark side we could say but a real
[38:59] positive side she is the type of all
[39:03] things vulgar foul and loome loome on
[39:05] the one hand and on the other hand she
[39:08] is the type of all things clean and
[39:10] beautiful as a whole and holy as the
[39:13] receptical of the spirit and blessings
[39:14] of God so instead of always maybe
[39:17] defaulting to the negative side she has
[39:20] a peculiar position because on one hand
[39:22] she could be used for great harm and for
[39:24] darkness and perversion and she's the
[39:26] type of things that are vulgar but she's
[39:28] also a type of things clean this is a
[39:31] peculiar position so he says on the
[39:34] other hand she is called the who
[39:36] is drunk with the wine of her
[39:38] fornications on the other she's called
[39:41] the bride of Christ on one hand she's
[39:44] called mystery
[39:47] Babylon the Abomination before God and
[39:49] on the other hand she is called New
[39:51] Jerusalem our mother one hand and the
[39:54] other on one hand and the other on one
[39:57] hand mystery Babylon on the other hand
[39:59] the New
[40:00] Jerusalem on one hand she's called a a
[40:03] on the other hand she's called the
[40:04] bride of Christ well you couldn't get
[40:06] more
[40:07] opposite and this is the peculiar
[40:09] position of the woman so on the other
[40:12] hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd
[40:15] that she's summarily cast into the Lake
[40:17] of Fire as the only place fit for her
[40:20] and on the other hand she's exalted to
[40:22] Heaven sharing the very Throne of God as
[40:25] the only place befitting such a queen
[40:29] notice how he's describing her she is
[40:30] Mount Zion she is the city of God she's
[40:33] the habitation of God she is the New
[40:36] Jerusalem but then the but then there's
[40:38] also mystery Babylon that's called the
[40:40] woman that's these terms are used of her
[40:42] she can say on one hand she's foul on
[40:44] the other hand she's blessed on one hand
[40:46] she's cursed on other hand she's
[40:47] glorious and you see there's two
[40:49] different sides to
[40:53] this and that's why he says she's
[40:55] brought to a very peculiar position
[40:56] before God and his word so there's a way
[41:00] that you could begin to describe the
[41:01] woman and you could describe all the
[41:03] negative attributes of how woman could
[41:05] be unfaithful and how a woman in the
[41:07] beginning caused the fall and and the
[41:09] place that the woman is today and and
[41:11] how Satan uses her and and the effect
[41:14] that she has in the lives that she lives
[41:15] and you could use her as a type of all
[41:17] Humanity in the fall of it and brother
[41:19] Brandon when he preaches marriage and
[41:20] divorce there's a lot of things that he
[41:22] says that can be very very heavy and
[41:24] very very hard to read would we would we
[41:27] agree on
[41:29] that and then he says I'm not I'm
[41:32] talking of the immoral
[41:35] now so he stops to say listen I'm I'm
[41:38] bringing this out but I'm just
[41:40] identifying an immoral woman I'm not
[41:42] generalizing women and saying that women
[41:45] are generally bad therefore we would
[41:47] need to Gally generally treat them bad
[41:50] there there's nothing in the word of God
[41:52] that gives a man a right to treat a
[41:55] woman wrong I challenge anybody to show
[41:58] me anywhere in the word of God where you
[42:00] have a right to treat a woman
[42:02] wrong and so when brother Bram is
[42:04] talking about the immorality of the
[42:05] woman he's wanting us to recognize
[42:07] prophecies being fulfilled he's want us
[42:09] to recognize certain attributes and
[42:10] characteristics of the age that we're
[42:12] living in and he stops says I'm not
[42:14] talking about all women he says I'm not
[42:16] I'm talking about the immoral now not
[42:18] you sisters he says we'll give you your
[42:21] place right place in a few minutes in
[42:24] the word of God here it was in God's
[42:26] place plan from the
[42:28] beginning so as he's describing an
[42:31] immoral woman he says now there's
[42:32] another place for a woman he says that's
[42:33] where I want to take you in the word of
[42:35] God and show you your right place in the
[42:37] word of God he says it was in God's plan
[42:40] from the beginning so in the beginning
[42:42] when God created he had a plan and
[42:46] though when though as he unfolded in
[42:48] creation and the woman came forth and
[42:50] then we see we're introduced to the
[42:52] woman the next thing we know she's being
[42:53] tempted and she falls that's not the
[42:56] place that God had originally envisioned
[42:58] the woman to be in the beginning he had
[43:01] a place for her he says it was in God's
[43:03] plan from the beginning and then when he
[43:06] preaches invisible union he says because
[43:08] she was cast over in that
[43:11] side because the woman played the uh
[43:14] played the part in that she did in the
[43:16] fall because she was tempted by Satan
[43:19] because the woman played that this one
[43:22] peculiar side where she's the type of
[43:23] all things foul because she played the
[43:25] part of the Harlot because she she
[43:27] played the part of mystery Babylon
[43:29] because she was cast over on that side
[43:31] he says she has also been given a sacred
[43:34] charge from God for Redemption she's got
[43:38] characters that she must not
[43:40] defile on one hand she played that part
[43:44] but because she played that part because
[43:46] she was cast in that role because she
[43:48] was played uh played that part she's
[43:51] also been given the woman has been given
[43:53] a sacred charge from God for Redemption
[43:57] in other words she's used in the fall
[44:00] should be used in the
[44:01] Redemption she was used by Satan to
[44:04] bring forth death she was used by Satan
[44:05] to bring forth disease she was used by
[44:07] Satan to destroy this Eden and to bring
[44:10] corruption to Earth and because she was
[44:12] used in the fall God says I am going to
[44:14] use her in Redemption I'll put enity
[44:17] between thy seed and her seed and I will
[44:20] cause her to crush your
[44:23] head she's been given a sacred charge
[44:26] for for
[44:32] Redemption let
[44:34] me I'm going go through some things very
[44:37] quickly here we read from power of
[44:40] transformation the one that was preached
[44:41] in Prescot uh October 31st
[44:44] 1965 he says it was God the Great Master
[44:47] of all intelligence that had in his mind
[44:49] what he wanted to do so then it's going
[44:53] to skip a little bit he says now 6,000
[44:55] years God take to make this
[44:57] and we see in Genesis 1 we see God had
[45:00] an objective that he wanted to bring to
[45:03] pass so he's the master of all
[45:04] intelligence and he had in his mind what
[45:06] he wanted to do he had an objective of
[45:08] what he wanted to bring to pass and he
[45:11] he describes Creation in Genesis 1 then
[45:13] he says in paragraph 64 and God is going
[45:16] to have a church now this parallel I
[45:18] want you to catch this parallel he's
[45:19] talking about in the beginning God had
[45:21] master of all intelligence had an
[45:23] objective that he wanted to bring to
[45:24] pass and it's not just merely to have a
[45:27] creation but it's to have a bride so he
[45:30] says and God's going to have a church I
[45:31] don't care how many Dark Ages we go
[45:33] through or whatever more he's going to
[45:34] have a church without spot or wrinkle
[45:36] whether we're a part of it or not
[45:38] because he has already said it's going
[45:39] to happen it's going to be there in the
[45:43] same way that God said let there be
[45:44] light and there was light he's saying
[45:45] God said he's going to have a church it
[45:47] will be there so then a few paragraphs
[45:49] later now then all after creation God
[45:52] could rest because all God's word seeds
[45:54] that he had spoke had been brought of
[45:56] its kind
[45:57] the Earth come over there was light
[45:59] there was sunshine when he let let the
[46:00] sunshine now why did he make the
[46:02] sunshine so he's just describing
[46:04] creation God laid the seeds out the sun
[46:06] came out seeds begin to make manifest
[46:08] why did he make the sunshine he had it
[46:10] in his mind that if the sun don't shine
[46:12] the flower wouldn't grow then he speaks
[46:14] it into existence whatever it is he
[46:16] makes everything to meet its purpose
[46:19] whatever it is so describing the
[46:21] creation in the beginning the seed being
[46:23] brought to life by the Light by the
[46:25] spoken word of God because he does it
[46:27] for a purpose he said the same thing is
[46:30] about having a church here in the last
[46:32] days he's going to have a bride so as he
[46:35] points to things in the beginning he
[46:36] keeps bringing it back to things here in
[46:38] the end and then several paragraphs
[46:40] later God spoke it he said let there be
[46:42] let there be and there would be an
[46:44] eating let there be beautiful flowers
[46:45] let there be my son in my own image
[46:48] stand over there in the Garden of Eden
[46:50] and let his bride stand by his side so
[46:54] in power of transformation he's going to
[46:56] the beginning God's power to create how
[46:58] God's creating a story how God's
[47:00] expressing something the creation and he
[47:02] says don't you see God's going to have a
[47:03] bride God's going to have a church don't
[47:05] you see it expressed in Adam in the
[47:06] Garden of Eden and his bride standing by
[47:08] his side so he says that's what god did
[47:11] did for that's what God did for Adam and
[47:13] Eve he created this Garden of Eden he
[47:15] spoke it it was in his mind and when he
[47:18] says it then it has to
[47:20] happen it's in his mind God wants to
[47:22] accomplish it when he speaks it it has
[47:24] to happen this is Brother bah bringing
[47:26] us the master of all intelligence what
[47:27] he had in his mind he wanted to do he
[47:29] begins to express it in creation Now
[47:32] notice this statement here now he
[47:34] describes it in this way because this is
[47:36] paragraph 93 we went to 55 60 71 72 84
[47:40] 88 now paragraph 93 there was Adam and
[47:43] Eve Walking In the Garden of Eden every
[47:46] seed bringing forth it never could do
[47:48] anything else it never could do anything
[47:50] else because God said let it be that way
[47:54] it had to be that way then then he stops
[47:57] oh how I'd like to stop here just a
[47:59] minute to say see there is where we're
[48:03] facing yet the completion of that
[48:08] word why is he taking time to show us
[48:11] the Great Master of all intelligence
[48:13] what he had in his mind the objective
[48:14] that he had what he's wanting to bring
[48:16] to pass how it's a mirror of what's
[48:18] taking place in this end time he says
[48:20] that's what we're finishing we're
[48:22] finishing what God started in the
[48:24] beginning his great mystery Secret that
[48:26] he had in the center of his will in the
[48:28] center of heart is being achieved in
[48:30] this
[48:31] time and so God had a mystery that would
[48:35] began to unfold in the
[48:37] beginning he's preaching power of
[48:39] transformation The Great Master of all
[48:41] intelligence had this mystery that began
[48:43] to unfold and he said and he says this
[48:46] is what we're facing today the
[48:48] completion of that
[48:52] word because where God begins his work
[48:56] Satan's right there trying to pervert it
[48:59] so he makes this statement when I go
[49:01] home this time I'm preaching on the
[49:04] subject the trail of the serpent the
[49:06] beast at the beginning and the Beast at
[49:09] the end ENT tril him right through the
[49:11] Bible and show how he heads up and
[49:13] you'll get all that on Telephone you see
[49:15] if the Lord permits us to do it and now
[49:17] just watch how cunning that fellow is as
[49:21] I read that you'll get that on the
[49:22] telephone I realize there's maybe a
[49:23] segment of our audience that doesn't
[49:25] know what that is and it became it
[49:28] became apparent to me that whenever I
[49:30] maybe I have a a Bluetooth ear uh piece
[49:32] on and I'm on the phone with the client
[49:34] and my kids will come in the room and
[49:35] I'll
[49:37] go I mean if you're you're over 40 you
[49:39] know what this means
[49:41] right and I don't know if my kids are
[49:43] like hang loose I mean what are we
[49:45] talking about here kind of does Dad you
[49:48] need a Q-tip what do you what do you
[49:50] need because I'm like and they're
[49:53] like so I don't know if I need to go
[49:56] you know so they know that I'm on the
[49:59] phone but brother Bram is saying I want
[50:01] to preach this sermon to show you how
[50:04] cunning uh so you could see the trail of
[50:07] the serpent this is the first place I
[50:09] believe he ever mentions this when he's
[50:11] preaching power of transformation in
[50:13] October 31st 1965 says when I get home I
[50:16] want to preach the trail of The Serpent
[50:17] and his subtitle is the beast at the
[50:19] beginning and the Beast at the
[50:21] end and then he says now watch just how
[50:24] cunning that fellow is now he's already
[50:27] preaching the trail of the serpent in
[50:29] power of
[50:30] transformation because he's wanting you
[50:32] to see the beast at the beginning and
[50:34] the Beast at the end and he's going to
[50:36] Great Lengths to show you what happened
[50:38] at the beginning and what happens at the
[50:39] end and in power of transformation he's
[50:42] showing us that there's two different
[50:43] powers in the
[50:44] beginning there's the power to create
[50:48] and there's a power to
[50:49] deform so God in the beginning created
[50:52] but Satan in the beginning deforms and
[50:55] he says I want you to see the Beast at
[50:56] the beginning and the Beast at the end
[50:58] through the trail of The Serpent and
[51:00] when we ended last time we talked about
[51:02] the bride at the beginning and the bride
[51:04] at the end through the trail of Christ
[51:06] because it's not just enough to see
[51:08] Satan's plan but see how Satan's plan
[51:10] was to try to thwart God's plan and how
[51:13] you are at the heart of God's
[51:15] plan so there's two different powers in
[51:18] the beginning you have the power to
[51:19] create the power to deform brother Bram
[51:22] says God is the Fountain of all Grace
[51:23] and power and of all wisdom is in God so
[51:26] therefore knowing that he is the only
[51:28] Creator there is there is no other
[51:31] Creator but God Satan cannot create it
[51:34] all he only perverts what's been created
[51:37] but God is the only
[51:39] Creator says this in God's power to
[51:41] transform God is the only Creator Satan
[51:44] is a deformer or perverter then he says
[51:47] now after all of that was set in order
[51:50] God felt sure now that it would all be
[51:52] all right then came in the enemy and I'm
[51:55] going to call this fell
[51:57] with not power to create but he had
[51:59] power to deform not transform to deform
[52:03] anything deform is to take it from its
[52:05] original state than something that's
[52:06] gone wrong with it so God is the only
[52:11] Creator Satan is a deformer you have a
[52:13] Creator you have a deformer Satan cannot
[52:17] create if you want to make if if we can
[52:20] even say that Satan is equal to God in
[52:22] every respect except he cannot create
[52:27] but Satan is unable to create at all he
[52:29] does not have the power to create and
[52:31] and and this is a I remember uh many
[52:35] many years ago uh sharing this this
[52:38] story I guess it's told maybe as a joke
[52:41] but how that man kind had Advanced so
[52:43] much so I'm tipping you off that this is
[52:45] not a true story in case the the way the
[52:48] story unfolds you don't like you're like
[52:50] really this happened brother Aon where
[52:52] did you read this but how mankind
[52:55] because of his achievements with
[52:57] science they'd come to the place where
[52:59] they you know what we can we can uh
[53:01] replicate things and we could take DNA
[53:03] and we can clone and we're we've s we're
[53:06] sending out uh spaceships and uh
[53:08] traveling through the universe and my
[53:10] we're doing so much we think we've got
[53:12] this so let's go talk to God and say God
[53:15] we've Advanced to the point
[53:16] scientifically where we feel like we can
[53:17] handle
[53:18] ourselves and so they nominated a
[53:20] scientist to go talk to God and that
[53:22] scientist goes with hat and hand very
[53:24] humbly and he goes to God and says God
[53:25] we have made such tremendous
[53:26] advancements in science in knowledge and
[53:28] understanding of human condition and and
[53:30] the world and the universe uh we felt
[53:33] that perhaps we had achieved the place
[53:35] uh scientifically where we could just
[53:37] govern ourselves and manage our own
[53:38] Affairs and God said that's fine I'll
[53:41] let you do that but first let's have a
[53:42] man-making
[53:44] competition and whoever wins the
[53:46] man-making competition will be allowed
[53:48] if you win I'll let you take care of
[53:50] yourselves and the scientists readily
[53:52] agreed he's like oh um absolutely we can
[53:55] do that and the and the scientist said
[53:58] and God said but we're going to have to
[53:59] do it like we did in the beginning we
[54:01] have to make man from dirt and the
[54:03] scientists like perfect that's fine we
[54:05] can do that we can take dirt and we can
[54:08] make man just like you did God and so
[54:10] God said fair enough and the scientists
[54:13] went off and the scientists got together
[54:14] they began to grab their dirt and get
[54:15] their dirt together and God said wait a
[54:17] minute hold on get your own
[54:22] dirt that that ends the argument right
[54:25] God Alone is a Creator Satan cannot
[54:29] create he can deform dirt he can do a
[54:30] lot of stuff with go the materials that
[54:32] God has given him but Satan is not a
[54:34] Creator in the beginning God created and
[54:37] when God was creating with an Express
[54:39] purpose Satan was not far
[54:42] behind and so we're just wanting to
[54:44] advance a little bit further in the
[54:46] story now Satan with not a power to
[54:48] create but a power to deform if you just
[54:51] read Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 2
[54:54] it is not good for man to be alone I'll
[54:56] make a help me and then Adam begins to
[54:58] express as is bone of my bones Flesh of
[54:59] My Flesh woman steps forth from man this
[55:02] for this cause shall man leave his
[55:03] father and mother and we have this
[55:05] beautiful beautiful story that's
[55:06] unfolding and then the very next chapter
[55:08] you want to read about this man and this
[55:10] woman right under commandment everything
[55:13] perfect everything beautiful brother
[55:15] says every seed bringing forth of its
[55:17] kind oh nothing else could happen in
[55:20] this beautiful perfect inst say that's
[55:21] what we're facing the completion of that
[55:24] word why are we facing the completion of
[55:26] it Genesis CH
[55:28] 3 Genesis 3:1 now the serpent was more
[55:32] subtle than any beast of the field the
[55:33] beast at the beginning and the Beast at
[55:36] the end the serpent was more subtle than
[55:38] any beast of the field which the Lord
[55:39] God had made and he said unto the woman
[55:42] yeay hath God said ye shall not eat of
[55:45] every tree of the garden so it's asked
[55:46] as a question did God say you can't eat
[55:48] of every tree in the garden I I just
[55:50] have a question asked don't don't be
[55:52] offended at all I just want to know are
[55:54] you allowed to eat of every tree in the
[55:56] Gard
[55:57] so now the woman comes forth now the
[56:01] serpent the the very next thing we read
[56:04] about is this serpent now animated and
[56:06] motivated by this by Satan begins to
[56:11] speak and he has a question are you
[56:13] allowed to eat of every tree of the
[56:15] garden so what's the first point of
[56:17] attack for
[56:19] Satan Satan cannot create he can only
[56:22] deform and he immediately went to the
[56:25] woman
[56:27] didn't go to Adam he immediately goes to
[56:30] the woman and she's because she's a
[56:33] type and and if I could say this if you
[56:35] could just allow your minds just to
[56:37] ponder this Satan saw something
[56:40] reflected in
[56:42] heaven so Satan would have seen
[56:44] something unfold in heaven and there
[56:47] might have even been an expression and I
[56:49] realize I'm speculating here so just
[56:50] give me some uh uh some Liberty here
[56:52] just to ponder uh not that we want to
[56:54] play Devil's Advocate but just kind of
[56:56] get inside Satan's head a little bit I
[56:58] can't do it at all I don't even know
[56:59] what that would be like so this isn't
[57:01] typ casting but Satan then in heaven
[57:05] because he was there and we're going to
[57:06] read that again in a in a moment he
[57:08] would have seen something in
[57:10] heaven maybe even something not yet
[57:14] expressed and maybe he would have seen
[57:16] some not necessarily A discontinuity or
[57:18] something out of place but he would have
[57:20] seen something unfolding in heaven and
[57:23] then he sees the very same thing
[57:25] reflected upon
[57:27] Earth because he's there in heaven he an
[57:31] anointed cherub that covers he's even
[57:33] expressed as being covering this Mercy
[57:35] Seat as it was one that's there over the
[57:37] throne so now there's an expression in
[57:39] heaven and Satan can see this in heaven
[57:41] now God begins to create and as he's
[57:43] creating Satan's observing this
[57:46] creation and he hears God give a
[57:48] commandment to a man that was made both
[57:50] male and female and it says be fruitful
[57:53] multiply and replenish the Earth so he
[57:55] would have heard Genesis 1 128 and then
[57:57] he would have witness Genesis 2:22 and
[58:00] 23 and now as he sees this unfold he
[58:04] doesn't attack the man his choice is the
[58:07] woman and it's not
[58:09] guesswork he didn't choose her because
[58:12] she was the weaker vessel that's because
[58:13] of the Fall he didn't choose her because
[58:17] he thought well Adam's away he's real
[58:18] busy right now the woman just happens to
[58:20] be sitting around on Instagram no he
[58:22] chose her for a reason it was not
[58:25] guesswork but it matched his desire in
[58:28] what he was trying to
[58:30] achieve he could not create he could
[58:32] only deform Satan could not look at
[58:35] Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 and say I want
[58:36] to try that too and say Let There
[58:39] Be he wanted to achieve something he
[58:42] wanted to have something for himself so
[58:44] it's his ambition that drove him to the
[58:46] woman because of what she
[58:49] represented in Ezekiel chapter 28
[58:53] verses I just I I'll just start with
[58:55] verse 12 of man take up lamentation upon
[58:57] the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus
[59:00] sayith the Lord God thou seest up the
[59:03] sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty
[59:06] now this is not God's
[59:09] characterization of the the son of the
[59:11] king of Tyrus which is liken to Lucifer
[59:15] which is a likeness of Satan and he's
[59:16] speaking to Satan in the language that's
[59:18] used here God's not saying that you're
[59:21] the sum of wisdom and you're perfect in
[59:23] Beauty thou SST up
[59:26] the sun you draw your own likeness it is
[59:30] liled to see all over again or in the
[59:33] beginning thou draw thine own likeness
[59:35] thou form a portrait of thyself you've
[59:37] represented yourself as the Perfection
[59:39] of wisdom and Beauty so who is it he try
[59:42] who is he trying to be like Christ who
[59:45] is he trying to be like his bride in her
[59:48] is summed up the wisdom and power of God
[59:51] but he establishes himself full of
[59:53] wisdom and perfect and beauty and it
[59:55] says that thou Hast been verse 13 thou
[59:58] Hast been in the garden in Eden the
[1:00:01] Garden of
[1:00:03] God so Satan now this anointed cherub
[1:00:06] that
[1:00:08] coverthe of wisdom and Beauty who drew
[1:00:11] his own likeness in Beauty he has been
[1:00:14] in Eden the Garden of
[1:00:16] God and when we see him in Eden the
[1:00:19] Garden of God he comes to the woman and
[1:00:22] begins to talk to the woman and he has a
[1:00:25] question the devil has a question he's
[1:00:28] trying to uncover the
[1:00:30] secret and he's going to the woman to
[1:00:32] see if she holds
[1:00:34] it because Satan wanted equality with
[1:00:36] God he desired the place of Christ and
[1:00:39] if I could say this he despised the
[1:00:41] bride's
[1:00:43] position he wanted equality he wanted to
[1:00:46] be like Christ and he despised the
[1:00:48] bride's position because now the bride
[1:00:51] is the one that dethrones
[1:00:54] him he had a jealousy that was eating
[1:00:56] him up how come when God created in the
[1:00:58] beginning he didn't want a son like me
[1:01:00] how come God in the beginning just
[1:01:02] didn't want to be worshiped like an
[1:01:03] angels but God in his mind desired to
[1:01:06] have a bride so even the expression of
[1:01:09] son is incomplete without daughter the
[1:01:11] expression of husband is incomplete
[1:01:13] without wife God wanted to have Christ
[1:01:15] and a bride himself becoming a
[1:01:18] family but Satan wanted equality with
[1:01:21] God for thou has said in thine heart
[1:01:24] Isaiah 1413 and 14 I will Ascend into
[1:01:27] heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[1:01:31] stars of God I will sit also upon the
[1:01:34] Mount of the congregation in the sides
[1:01:36] of the north I will Ascend above the
[1:01:39] heights of the clouds I will be like the
[1:01:42] most
[1:01:44] high he wanted to be in the heavens he
[1:01:47] wanted his throne to be exalted above
[1:01:49] the stars of God the Sons and Daughters
[1:01:50] of
[1:01:52] God this is his ambition the Bible says
[1:01:55] th H has been in Eden the Garden of God
[1:01:58] because he wanted to sit upon the Mount
[1:02:01] of the
[1:02:02] congregation he's in the Garden of Eden
[1:02:04] because he wants to sit in the sides of
[1:02:06] the north Satan has an
[1:02:09] ambition now I'm going to go slowly
[1:02:11] through these words in this in this uh I
[1:02:14] say slowly it may not be slow to some
[1:02:17] slower
[1:02:19] slowish I will sit also upon the Mount
[1:02:22] of the
[1:02:23] congregation the word there congregation
[1:02:26] it's a sacred appointed place it's a
[1:02:29] sacred place I want to sit upon the
[1:02:32] Mount of the congregation it's actually
[1:02:33] rendered tent of meeting in other trans
[1:02:36] other places in the Bible it's the same
[1:02:39] word that's used in Genesis 18:4 when he
[1:02:41] says I will visit Sarah at an appointed
[1:02:44] time according to the time of life at a
[1:02:47] time of conception I will visit her and
[1:02:49] she will conceive and she will have a
[1:02:51] son so it's Sarah's appointed time a
[1:02:53] time of conception he says I want to sit
[1:02:55] on the Mount of the congregation I want
[1:02:57] to sit in a sacred appointed
[1:03:00] place he says in the sides of the north
[1:03:04] now the sides of the north it's not
[1:03:05] geographically it's not location it's
[1:03:07] not that you know we all want the north
[1:03:08] facing backyard Satan wasn't like us is
[1:03:11] it a North facing backyard what does
[1:03:14] that even
[1:03:15] mean but he it's a figurative phrase
[1:03:18] which alludes to what Satan is looking
[1:03:20] for in Eden thou Hast been in the garden
[1:03:23] of God thou Hast been in Eden the Garden
[1:03:25] of God God you said I want to sit upon
[1:03:27] the Mount of the congregation in the
[1:03:28] sides of the north sides there in the
[1:03:31] Hebrews
[1:03:33] thigh and it's Yar it comes from Yar
[1:03:36] which is a reference to the loins or the
[1:03:38] seat of procreative
[1:03:39] power so it says Thou Hast been in Eden
[1:03:42] the Garden of God and you had this
[1:03:45] ambition to sit in the sides of the
[1:03:47] north he's describing figure to the a
[1:03:50] place of procreative power in the sides
[1:03:52] of the north North that speaks of a
[1:03:54] hidden treasure or Secret place and in
[1:03:56] the Bible it's symbolic of reproduction
[1:03:58] and
[1:03:59] procreation so Satan being unable to
[1:04:02] create his own son him being unable to
[1:04:05] create his own wife him being unable to
[1:04:07] replicate himself Satan was in the
[1:04:09] garden Desiring to not create but to
[1:04:13] deform how would he do this by sitting
[1:04:15] in the Mount of the congregation by him
[1:04:17] having access to the sides of the north
[1:04:19] that's why Satan is there in the
[1:04:21] beginning God in the beginning created
[1:04:24] in the beginning God created and now
[1:04:26] Satan is right there to
[1:04:29] deform but then Satan in his ambition
[1:04:32] and his
[1:04:33] desire and this uh sealing up
[1:04:39] himself coming to Eden the Garden of
[1:04:42] God God used his own ambition against
[1:04:46] him because Satan's right there oh this
[1:04:49] is the Eden this is it how come he
[1:04:52] hadn't tempted Adam yet he's watching
[1:04:55] when the woman comes forth he goes now
[1:04:57] that's something
[1:05:00] different male female male female male
[1:05:02] female all of a sudden Adam comes forth
[1:05:04] now he sees a mirror image of God on
[1:05:05] Earth and then when he brings the woman
[1:05:07] out of the man a mystery about God's
[1:05:09] unfolded and Satan wants to attack
[1:05:13] her but brother Rand we already read it
[1:05:15] he knew Eve would fall by disbelieving
[1:05:17] the
[1:05:18] word so he actually places a trap for
[1:05:22] Satan that he had planned that God had a
[1:05:25] plan all
[1:05:27] along so here he says he writes this in
[1:05:32] if a church age book when he writing
[1:05:35] about the Ephesian age we start with the
[1:05:36] fact that there are two trees in the
[1:05:38] midst of the garden the tree of life was
[1:05:41] Jesus the other trees is definitely
[1:05:43] Satan because of what came forth from
[1:05:45] the fruit of that tree now then we know
[1:05:47] that both of these trees had a
[1:05:49] relationship to man or they would have
[1:05:50] never been placed there some orientation
[1:05:53] some significance uh some a placement to
[1:05:56] man they must have had a part in The
[1:05:59] Sovereign plan and purpose of God in the
[1:06:01] relationship to Mankind and to himself
[1:06:04] or we could never impute omniscience
[1:06:06] unto God that is all true so far is it
[1:06:10] not now the word most definitely sets
[1:06:12] forth that before the foundation of the
[1:06:14] Earth the purpose of God was to share
[1:06:16] his eternal life with man now just catch
[1:06:19] it in your minds how he's saying that
[1:06:21] the tree of life was Christ and that
[1:06:23] Satan also represents another tree
[1:06:26] so there's two trees in the midst of the
[1:06:28] garden the Tree of Life Satan represents
[1:06:30] this other tree he says they're there
[1:06:32] for a
[1:06:33] purpose that God according to his
[1:06:36] Sovereign plan placed them there in
[1:06:38] relationship to
[1:06:40] man and then he says this God being a
[1:06:44] savior it was necessary that he
[1:06:46] predestinate a man who would require
[1:06:48] salvation in order to give himself
[1:06:50] reason and purpose of being so why do
[1:06:54] you have the Tree of Life and then Satan
[1:06:56] represented there
[1:06:57] also because God had to predestinate a
[1:07:01] man who would require salvation why
[1:07:04] because he needed a reason to
[1:07:07] exist he existed but without reason he
[1:07:11] existed but without purpose so God had
[1:07:13] to have a man who would fall in order to
[1:07:16] give himself reason and purpose of being
[1:07:19] and so God himself could not tempt man
[1:07:21] so God had to create evil and bring
[1:07:24] forth a woman so that there would be an
[1:07:26] allegory there would be a story there
[1:07:28] would be a representation so that we
[1:07:30] thousands of years later could look back
[1:07:32] and read and see that God had planned it
[1:07:35] all along nothing is out of CHA
[1:07:39] cater him being a savior it was in him
[1:07:43] part of his attributes but without a man
[1:07:46] to save he could never express it so he
[1:07:49] had to predestinate a man that would
[1:07:50] require salvation to give him reason and
[1:07:52] purpose of being so he says thus what
[1:07:55] God worked out here in the garden was
[1:07:57] his predestinated
[1:07:59] plan and when Satan had brought about
[1:08:02] that which was necessary to the purpose
[1:08:04] of God then man could not get to the
[1:08:07] Tree of Life In The Garden certainly not
[1:08:10] it wasn't
[1:08:13] time it's
[1:08:16] time I'm not talking about time to close
[1:08:19] about I'm talking about
[1:08:21] this when God what when God's plan was
[1:08:24] worked out in the beginning
[1:08:26] when Satan had brought about that which
[1:08:27] was necessary to the purpose of God we
[1:08:30] see this image of the man's way to the
[1:08:32] tree of life is closed off he says it
[1:08:34] wasn't
[1:08:36] time man's access to the tree of life is
[1:08:39] closed off it wasn't time for man to
[1:08:40] come he's saying it wasn't time in God's
[1:08:43] plan so there was no upset in the Garden
[1:08:46] of
[1:08:47] Eden I I I I hate to use this uh this
[1:08:51] example but I
[1:08:53] mean God hustled
[1:08:56] Satan right you pull sharks know exactly
[1:08:59] what I'm talking about he pretended like
[1:09:01] he wasn't looking he didn't know what he
[1:09:02] was doing and Satan's
[1:09:05] like you know sneaks in over there and
[1:09:07] causes the fall and he thinks man I got
[1:09:10] him but God's plan
[1:09:12] unfolds because what does Adam
[1:09:15] do it Adam then in the moment he
[1:09:18] portrays
[1:09:20] Christ he doesn't put her away he
[1:09:22] doesn't divorce her he doesn't count his
[1:09:24] ribs
[1:09:26] say how many women did you have in me no
[1:09:28] he immediately acted to redeem her to
[1:09:30] restore her so everything's working
[1:09:33] according to plan God says the image is
[1:09:35] being reflected what I had in my mind is
[1:09:38] unfolding beautifully Adam did what I
[1:09:40] thought he would do in response to what
[1:09:41] I knew the woman would do nothing is out
[1:09:44] of CHA there is no chaos in Satan oh
[1:09:46] yeah we got him oh we got him but now a
[1:09:48] curse
[1:09:49] comes I mean s say well I didn't
[1:09:51] anticipate that what's going to happen
[1:09:53] next okay there's going to be a son born
[1:09:54] to the woman that's going to crush my
[1:09:56] head so what's the next thing he does he
[1:09:58] murders the son born to the
[1:10:00] woman because he was there in the
[1:10:02] beginning to pervert God's program he
[1:10:04] was there to stop God's
[1:10:06] program and brother brandham is showing
[1:10:08] us that this was according to God's
[1:10:10] predestinated plan that the woman would
[1:10:13] be used in the
[1:10:16] fall but then notice
[1:10:18] this Christ is the mystery God revealed
[1:10:20] he brings forth the brid tree in this
[1:10:23] end time when this Revelation is made
[1:10:24] known he brings forth the bride tree
[1:10:27] which will be the Tree of Life restored
[1:10:29] back to him as husband and wife in the
[1:10:32] Garden of
[1:10:34] Eden this is what God had in his plan
[1:10:37] all along he was saving it for the end
[1:10:41] time it wasn't all all the pieces
[1:10:43] weren't put on the board in the
[1:10:44] beginning and everything was laid out
[1:10:46] and then God just said all right I want
[1:10:48] to see what Satan's next move is he
[1:10:51] didn't even let Satan see all the
[1:10:53] pieces s was only working with what he
[1:10:56] saw God saw the beginning from the end
[1:10:59] and then Paul writes this in 1
[1:11:00] Corinthians chap 2: 6 to8 because he
[1:11:03] wanted Satan to fall into this trap
[1:11:06] David writes about it the pit that
[1:11:07] they've dug for me they fall into the
[1:11:08] midst there other themselves oh the the
[1:11:10] wicked is snared in the works of his own
[1:11:13] hands 1 Corinthians 268 how be it we
[1:11:16] speak wisdom of God among them that are
[1:11:20] perfect yet not the wisdom of this world
[1:11:22] nor of the princes of this world that
[1:11:24] come to not but we speak the wisdom of
[1:11:27] God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[1:11:30] which God ordained before the world unto
[1:11:32] our Glory the hidden wisdom of God that
[1:11:35] was in him before the foundation of the
[1:11:36] world ordained unto us he says which
[1:11:39] none of the princes of this world knew
[1:11:41] for had they known it they would have
[1:11:43] not have crucified the Lord Of
[1:11:46] Glory they knew there was something to
[1:11:48] it or they wouldn't have done it but had
[1:11:50] they known the purpose behind
[1:11:53] it they knew this was was the son of God
[1:11:56] that was to come into this world but if
[1:11:57] they knew he was to come as a lamb and a
[1:11:59] sacrifice they would have never
[1:12:00] sacrificed him they knew this woman had
[1:12:03] some significance in the beginning
[1:12:05] that's why he met her to defile her but
[1:12:08] if he knew what God was doing in the
[1:12:09] beginning he never would have done it
[1:12:12] amen and oh I just was rejoicing in this
[1:12:15] over this past week God let Satan do
[1:12:18] make all his
[1:12:20] moves he made all his moves over and
[1:12:23] over 6,000 years and Satan made his last
[1:12:26] move he was out of moves and then he
[1:12:29] stepped forward and took the book and
[1:12:31] loosed it just the moment where Satan
[1:12:34] thought there's no one worthy there's no
[1:12:36] one can do it I've achieved my bride
[1:12:39] I've got Leo de right where I want it it
[1:12:41] was then when Satan had made his last
[1:12:43] move God still had one
[1:12:49] more praise the Lord
[1:12:55] not
[1:12:56] here he says
[1:13:01] now all right let's just uh take a few
[1:13:05] more statements here from Christ as a
[1:13:07] mystery God revealed he says I'm talking
[1:13:10] about the headship of
[1:13:13] Christ notice being personally
[1:13:16] identified by the original headship we
[1:13:18] have the answer to the devil's
[1:13:21] question we have the answer to the
[1:13:24] devil's
[1:13:25] question he Christ is risen and has paid
[1:13:29] the price and raising up the body the
[1:13:32] devil can't stand
[1:13:34] it you now you can't just look at well
[1:13:37] the price being paid he can't stand you
[1:13:39] can't just say well the Risen Christ is
[1:13:41] what he can't stand raising up the
[1:13:44] body he can't stand it that's the reason
[1:13:47] these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up
[1:13:49] that's the reason they're all coming
[1:13:50] into what they're doing now the devil
[1:13:52] that's the reason he's howling the way
