TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we're continuing on this our subject this year on the house of the Lord I'd like to take another part on asking this question is there room for mercy and I am drawing from the the idea of a house uh with rooms and a house with space and a place a dwelling place and asking is there room for mercy and as I've studied Mercy over the last uh little while I've been wanting to take a fresh look at it and so I've been trying to find as many uh connections to Mercy in the scripture just to find how the Bible uh teaches mercy and how it's applicable in many different ways and I'm finding that the meaning uh is dependent upon many different context and there's actually a word that I found in um the Old Testament that is only ever used of God about compassion and mercy except maybe possibly in one instance and so Mercy is sometimes uh there's a way that it's Express that it can only be God and there's Mercy that we can have ourselves and so there's a lot of different a and looking at Mercy and I think it's just a beautiful subject to study and just to tie into some of the things we've been ministering lately in John chapter 14:12 Jesus says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father The Works that I do shall he do also this is for those that believe even Paul is is instructing Titus is saying those that believe they should should uh be in mind to cultivate and to be faithful to maintain good works and Jesus says those that believe the works that he did shall we do also and this is uh something that all of us should challenge ourselves by that if the Life of Christ is inside of me then the same life that worked in him will work in me and we could challenge ourselves and say well does that mean I need to turn water to wine or walk on water and these things and you'll find that you don't need to do those things do I need to die upon the cross no you don't need to do that but there's a work that he did there's certain uh things that defined his life certain characteristics that stood out and there are works that we are to do that he did and there are Greater Works that we are to do in this end time and there's a work to be finished and as we have mentioned recently and brother brandham and he's ministering is this the sign of the end he's talking about different mysteries in the Bible that are uh there for the believer to understand and to be revealed he says the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation now we know there's a lot of teaching on that in the message of the hour in terms of uh what these Sensations might be or evidences and physical ways that people want to be able to put their finger on it and say I had this happen so I know that I've got the Holy Ghost but he's saying that it is the mystery of the Seal of God this mystery of the new birth that isn't evidenced by some emotion or sensation he says but the person of Christ performing in you the same work that he did so you can say without sensation but doing it the way he did it uh living the life the way that he lived doing it just the way that he does it so the evidence of Christ in a person's heart is performing his Works in fulfillment of his word the promised word that he has given us and to do his will or to do his works we have to do it in the same nature we have to do it in the same character of the word not just an IM a False Image as we were dealing with it on Wednesday night if the Bible says to to um the rod will drive away Disobedience and stubbornness and and it speaks of uh this physical or Corporal spanking that one might do to their child and and it says do it early uh we don't want to just have spank children we don't want to just spank them say well there's the word the word's being fulfilled but that could be a False Image because you haven't really accomplished what that's supposed to do so it's not done in the nature of the word so it's not just letter but it's also Al in the character and nature of it when we read it says the works that I do shall he do also a word there is an act or deed or the thing done so these works or acts of Christ I've been thinking about how we say the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles and in the early church it was the works of the Holy Ghost in the lives of the Christians there in the beginning and so you have the works or the acts of Christ in ourselves it is the thing done it is the results it's what's produced those are the works those are the acts of Christ and what I'm wanting to focus on is Mercy as an attribute of Christ an essential characteristic of how he works and I acknowledge that this is a very narrow focus is so the works that I do shall he do also and all a sudden say is there room for mercy and zero in on this idea of Mercy but I do want to look at Mercy and its character it's even controversy its convenience and how that God has uh at God's heart is Mercy and that God is rich in Mercy and there's a lot of scriptures that you can begin to think about and so I want to look at Mercy and understand it's got to be part of these works these end time works that we're doing as the Bride of Jesus Christ and there are misunderstandings or even some wrestlingscout the place of Mercy today uh but I will say this uh just so that you're you're thinking in this way that The Mercy Seat has always been moving there's always been movement to Where Mercy is we know that in the house of the Lord they there was a room the most holy place the holiest of holies that was dedicated to Mercy and truth and mercy was found there that pritu that Mercy Seat between the cherums that that covering of the Ark and that's where God would dwell that's where the shikina glory would dwell and it move it was there in the Tabernacle in the wilderness in the beginning there The Exodus when God established this and then it moved from the Tabernacle in the wilderness to the temple in Jerusalem and there it was for some time but then it moved from the temple to the cross and it moved from the cross to heaven and so there is I can even say into the temple or the sanctuary in heaven and so Mercy has always been something that moved there's always been something available a mercy available God has always been merciful the Bible says his Mercy endures forever and one of the most common phrases in the Old Testament and so I I want us to all do it personally individually and even now as we Minister on this to deeply consider mercy and this morning as the Lord dealt with my heart last week and just kind of arrived at this place where didn't know that I'd really get into this this way but I want us to especially think about Mercy in light of the time that we're living in right now in the day and age that we're living in this time of judgment and so today my focus is going to be on scriptures that are being fulfilled in this end time in this aspect of judgment in this time that we're living in so if you take your Bibles to Luke Chapter 17: 26-3 I believe that we could maybe all read this without the the help or the aid of of the Bible just it's such a familiar scripture and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man and he says they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all and it says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now there's a lot in these statements there's actually a lot in these statements and a lot maybe hid by these statements because when we read in verses 27 and even verse 28 that there's a lot of details that just relate to Everyday Life As far as eating and drinking and marrying and the buying and selling the planting and building but yet in all of this there was something that displeased God and and God is saying that in the days of Noah and the days of lot when they did these things and so it identifies the nature and characteristic of the people on the surface but then it says the day that Noah entered the Ark the flood came and destroyed them all and so it kind of sets up the scene in the the signs of the time as it were and then it says the same thing in the days of lot it says but the day that lot went out of Sodom it rainf fire bstone from heaven and destroyed them all in both instances it says it destroyed them all not Noah not lot but it destroyed all those that tasted that judgment that felt that wrath of God and so the says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so the revelation of the son of man kind of opens up this time or this dispensation of judgment that when the son of man is revealed what Jesus is saying when the son of man is revealed that uh there is a flood came and destroyed them all when the son the the son of man is going to be re as it was in the days of Noah the flood came and destroyed them all as it was in the days of lot fire and brimstone for It Out of Heaven onto Sodom gomor and those cities in the plain and destroy the mountain he says this is going to be an aspect or characteristic of the revealing of the son of man in Matthew CH 24: 36 I would just read to verse 39 but of that day and hour knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of Noah were so shall also be so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and knew not till the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be this coming of the son of man is you could could have been translate to Advent it's used of the Christmas time the Advent of Christ but it means his arrival and his continued presence with so when it says the coming of the son of man it's not just like Boom come and go but it's him arriving him coming and this coming is we've already seen in Luke chapter 17 it's the revealing of the son of man scripturally the revealing of the son of man is the the same as the coming of the son of man in this particular instance it's not that you'd find everywhere where it uses coming and everywhere it uses reveal it and say it's all the same event but here as Christ says as it was in the day of Noah so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man and then it says in matth 24 this way so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so the age of the son of man is a time of judgment as it said that the flood came and took them all away the fire and brimstone came and destroyed them all right so the son of man this ministry of the son of man has this aspect of judgment John 5: 27 and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man because he is the son of man he has this given to him this authority to execute judgment so it's essential to his character it's part of this manifestation of this revealing to execute judgment as the son of man says this Matthew 16: 27 and 28 for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works so here is a reward a judgment a dispensing as the son of man verily I say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and we see in Matthew 17 Mark chapter9 the Transfiguration this rehearsal this preview of The Kingdom coming in power and it's the the son and hear ye him and hear ye him alone it's this glory and power of the Kingdom to whom judgment is committed to Christ the son of man so the son of man is an a a a judgment office it is a judge it has this aspect of a judge and this is the age of the son of man being revealed we must understand these things that are taught and if this is the age of the son of man being revealed and it is given to the son of man to execute judgment and the revealing of the son of man enters in a time in dispensation of judgment we say oh judgment well not white Throne judgment a a and not tribulation judgment but it's a time of judgment that will flow out into these other periods of tribulation and even all the way to White Throne judgment we've entered a time when the son of man is revealed he comes and there's going to be judgment upon it says them all and I would say that in the face of judgment Mercy becomes a pretty important subject that if it's a time of judgment I'd want to know well if you were going to be in court and you're going to be facing a judge or a judge was going to be presiding over your case you might want to know a little bit about the process you want might want to know a little bit about what's available to says well you're being sued uh for $25 million and and you've got to answer in court and this is going to be the judge and you might say well what are my remedies what are my recourses what's the possible outcome oh well there's no other outcome but judgment against you in $25 million you're like well guess there's not much I can do about it don't need to worry about answering don't we need to worry about showing up it's already been decided this is what the rule of law says this is who's presiding this is going to be the outcome especially I guess if you're facing a criminal trial you've been charged uh with this crime and you're going to have to face the judge and he's a really tough one he's really hard on crime and said well can I plead not guilty well no I mean it doesn't matter can I throw myself at the mercy of the Court no there's no such thing you'd want to know the process you'd want to know the rules the possible outcom what are the sentencing guidelines what what can I do and so I believe in light of the scriptural things that we see here in Luke chapter 17 in Matthew 24 and6 these different places that Mercy is a critical subject and I would say this is why Satan tries to confuse it so much is that if it is a judgment time Satan would sure want us to confuse what judgment is what it looks like how it's going to come to pass and he' want to confuse us on this aspect of Mercy mercy and I believe that it must not be misunderstood we must not misunderstand mercy and if I could say it this way when I'm asking if there's room for Mercy I'm asking if there's room for mercy in your heart I'm asking if there's room for mercy in your family I'm asking if there's room for Mercy at a church because there's a way that we can carry ourselves with this little bit of self-righteousness a little bit of a judgment and some really costic attitudes that betray the real mercy of Christ that betray the real Heart Of God so it's a challenge to us that about mercy and you'll find in the scripture if you look at it that if we believe that we have been recipients of Mercy then we ought to be merciful a and not be so quick to say well God I'm justified in the sight of God as if I never did it in the first place and you're going straight to hell this is something that we must not misunderstand in the days of Noah if you could just walk with me in this I really want to substantiate this through scripture Jesus says Noah entered the Ark and as Noah enters the ark it says that God destroyed the rest Genesis 6:13 God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh is come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth quite a statement as God looked down upon the Earth and he said their imagination of man is only evil continually they do great wickedness and the end of Flesh has come before me I want to destroy them all and God having made this pronouncement in chapter 7 verses 15 to 23 and it says and they went in and we know God commanded Noah to build the ark and it's not just over a few weeks but in those 120 years we know there was a lot of laboring with this gospel with this message and this testimony that uh you're going to need a big boat is what his life was testifying his life was testifying judgment is coming judgment is coming com me and it says Noah went into in unto and they went in unto Noah into the ark two and two of All Flesh wherein is the breath of life I think it's just a big summary of a lot that was taking place there says and they that went in went in male and female of All Flesh as God had commanded him and the Lord shut him in he enters into the ark according to the Commandment them and those his family with them eight of them enter into the ark with it says the two of All Flesh male and female and then the Lord shuts the door and the flood was 40 days upon the earth and the waters increased and bear up the ark and it was lifted up above the earth and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the Ark went upon the face of the waters so now it's moving and being moved by the water and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the Earth upon the high hills that were under the whole Heaven were covered 15 cubits upward did the waters Prevail and the mountains were covered in All Flesh died that moved upon the Earth so God wasn't kidding when he said the end of All Flesh has come before me and the Earth is filled with violence through this flesh so I'm going to destroy them with the Earth All Flesh died that moved upon the Earth both of foul and of cattle and of Beast and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth and every man all in whose nostrils was the Breath of Life of all that was in the dry land died and every living substance was destroyed which was a upon the face of the ground both Man and Cattle and the creeping things and the foul of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and Noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark when Jesus says As it was in the days of Noah he summarizes say that the day that he entered in the ark the flood came and destroyed them all and as God said the Earth is filled with violence through flesh I'm going to destroy him from the face of the Earth he does exactly what he says and he sends the waters as a flood upon the Earth and it destroys all that had breath upon the land except those that were in the ark and a very similar instance but on a much smaller scale and through the use of fire it says in the days of lot we know that lot escaped Sodom and God destroyed the rest in Genesis CH 13:13 and very similar to what he says in chapter 6:3 but the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners be before the Lord exceedingly lot chose those uh LS of Sodom and Gomorrah Abraham separates himself from lot and he go chooses to live uh not with L Sodom and view but he lives away from there and away from these wicked men but this is the men of were Wicked and sinners before the Lord so you go forward five chapters in Genesis Chapter 18 verses 20 and 21 it says the Lord said because the Cry of Sodom and gamorra is great and because their sin is very Grievous now I kind of jumped into the middle of the story of these uh three that meet with Abraham and Sarah they're at the tent door there in the cool In the Heat of the day they come and they're eating together and they're fellowshipping they have a message for Abraham about Sarah but now he says the Cry of Sodom is great because of their sin says I will go now down now and see whether they have done alt together according to the Cry of it is it what it sounds like is it what it what I think it is which has come unto me and if not I will know now this phrase or this statement as we may uh look at here in a little bit it indicates that God is going to investigate he's sending these Messengers down there to look at the condition of Sodom and if it is as he thinks it is I know I'm just kind of using the language as it suggested here then he's going to bring judgment the the the visiting of Sodom and Gomorrah because of this Cry of their wickedness was for the purpose of judgment and destruction so chapter 19: 24 25 the Lord then the Lord reigned upon Solomon and upon Gomorrah Brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven and he overthrew the those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground so it just burned it over something was growing from the ground it was burned if there was inhabitants of the cities and the plain they were burned verse 279 says that God destroyed the cities of the plain so as it was in the days of lot God sees wickedness and he sends fire and brimstone to judge that wickedness and all that remained in the plain and in the cities were destroyed even those things which grew upon the ground God using water God using fire as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot and as you read what Jesus says he highlights destruction when you read the scriptures in Genesis 7 and Genesis 18 and 19 we see that it is destruction and these days are used to highlight when Jesus says As it was in these days so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed he uses these days to highlight a dispensation of Judgment of wickedness highlight a judgment of sin that they were allowed to continue God allowed the cries to come up God allowed men to increase in the Earth but there comes a point where God says enough is enough I'm going to do something about this God just wasn't up there with his finger as soon as someone told a like go they're dead right God's just waiting and next thing you know after he's done it's like oh I'm sorry Noah you're you're the only one left and Noah's like well I mean what can you do God but rather God allows things to continue and things unfold but God specifically uses Christ specifically uses these days to introduce this aspect of judgment that has been committed to the son of man now I wouldn't want you to assume based upon my emphasis today that's the only aspect because there's so much contained in these words that are shared in Luke 17 and Matthew 24 but I'm just wanting today to highlight this aspect of judgment in 1 Peter chapter 3: 18 to 20 you'll find that in the New Testament as we'll read a few places in the Epistles of Peter and then also believe in Jude you'll find this characterization of these days and you'll find that Peter and the ones uh that that would have heard even this commandment and it being rehearsed in their ears about in as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the day of the coming and revealing of the son of man notice how Peter addresses this for Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit what beautiful poetry it's wonderful by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison now this is quite a statement and this is this is a sentence that's been wrestled with ever since it was pinned and there's a lot of ways that people try to make sense of it and and well when did this preaching happen and how did it unfold but it says he went and preached unto the spirits or Souls that were in prison which sometime were disobedient so he's preaching to souls forever imprisoned and because they were disobedient says they were some at some time were disobedient so in the past they were disobedient and we might then I think just being If we're honest with ourselves we like that would be me Paul said in Titus we were all subject to diverse lust and we were all Disobedience and the world influenced us and we did things that were wrong he says so they were disobedient when Once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a prepare preparing we're in few that is eight Souls were saved by water now speaking of Christ quickened by the spirit brought us to God being put to Death In the Flesh being raised up for our justification seated at the right hand of the Father the Majesty on high he is now forever there or he is forever a help to us to bring us into God's presence but then he kind of takes this aspect that he also went and preached to Spirits in prison the spirits in prison were disobedient in the day of Noah he's using this as an example he said uh the longsuffering god waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing he's using this Ark now as Noah Was preparing the ark there was some testimony or witness there was something there that as Noah was getting the ark ready that was the longsuffering of God it wasn't God was s going come on Noah seriously I put it all on the the earth I told you how to do it it's taking you forever but God allowed that Ark to be a testimony God allowed it to be a conversation piece God allowed it to be like Noah seriously what are you doing like well it's going to rain and rain would be what right it's going to fall out of the heavens and the Earth is going to open up beneath and everyone on the face of the Earth is going to be destroyed and this is the only thing that's going to survive and it would give an opportunity for someone in their heart to say and where did you get this from he says God spoke to me well who is this God how did he communicate with you and says well my father ate Adam did this and did that and be able to witness and testify and it would have been a conversation piece and so he's saying that God was merciful here it says longsuffering so it speaks of his patience but yet it's this patience exhibits of Mercy that while the ark was being prepared this was God's mercy to them but then in the end only eight Souls were saved by water Noah and his household so it's these Spirits in prison these are souls that can never be saved these are souls that died disobedient that are without Mercy if I could say it this way them being in prison in this uh in this place of imprisonment they had crossed some line into this eternal damnation but when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the AR Ark Was preparing was there no room for mercy in 2 Peter chap 2: 1-6 he says' but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privil shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that brought bought them and bring upon themselves Swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious Ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of why will the way of Truth be evil spoken of because it's going to be so close there's going to be some name of Christ attached to it verse three and through covetousness shall they with fed words make merchandise of you wow he just so succinctly described nominal Christianity and it says they will make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time linger not and their damnation slumbereth not forth God spared not the angels that sin but cast them down to Hell and deliver them into chains of Darkness to be reserved un judgment there's your place of imprisonment these chains of darkness and this imprisonment this place of waiting awaiting judgment it's not a literal burning hell now but it's a place of of a prison a jail house reserved unto judgment and spared not the old world but saved Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly now notice again how it expresses Noah as being a preacher of righteousness while Noah Was preparing the ark he was a an exhibitor a displayer he was one that was a preacher of righteousness he had a testimony he had a Ministry he had an advocacy where he's preaching Before the Flood came in the days of old God judged the world but Noah during that time was a preacher of righteousness and bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example and ample unto those that after should live ungodly this is Peter now writing as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of lot he uses this that there's going to be judgment upon them that turn the way of Truth into unrighteousness that are going to have pernicious ways and make merchandise of the people he's saying they're going to be judged they're not going to escape judgment and he uses the Angels which were spared not he uses the days of Noah in which the people were spared not and he uses the days of lot in which the people burned into ashes right he says there are examples of what should happen to those that live ungodly right Jude when he's writing in verses 5 six and 7 he uses a language very similar to what Peter is writing in his Epistles I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not so he had saved some and there had been an exodus but then in that move and in that Exodus there were some that didn't actually believe they just got caught up in the movement and he said he destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation Heath reserved in Everlasting chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of the great day again Jude now is saying that just look at these examples that people who live ungodly and those who are disobedient unrighteous there's going to be a judgment come right it's it's it's inescapable there's going to be a judgment of the great day and we know that there's a lot of application of these things to the time in which all uh who are not part of the first resurrection are going to stand before white Throne judgment and the books are going to be used to judge them according to the works he says in verse 7 even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire it's Eternal fire our God is a consuming fire this wrath is Judgment of God it's not proposing an eternal hell but it is opposing a finality of judgment the Eternal fire is the flame of God the Vengeance of God who is eternal right so again we see in the scripture that the days of lot and the days of Noah are associated with God's judgment on sin and is it said that Christ went and preached under the spirits in prison we all uh I think most of us would be familiar with the sermon that brother Brandon preached called Souls that are in prison now and uh just realizing The Nearness to an anniversary of this as it was November 10th 1963 now those of you here who are familiar with this sermon how many can remember the first time you really heard what was being preached I can remember I remember I was still in my undergraduate uh studies and I remember listening to it on my way to school and you know chances are I I might have not gone to class that morning and I remember I I list to that tape every day over and over and over again and thinking okay I I I want to under I I need to Something's I need to hear this I need to understand I need to come to a peace with this this is it was the first time in my life I really actually heard it and it is I think a kind of a remarkable sermon I do believe that I am I'm not responsible for interpreting anything that brother brandham said to you I I don't even I don't even think I I'm responsible for telling you that it's right or wrong I'm responsible for telling you what he taught and you can determine for yourself whether or not you want to believe it but in Souls that are in prison now it says he says this Noah's Ministry all Ministries done the same Noah preached that's exactly right he went into the ark and when he went into the ark there were seven days that nothing happened his testimony preached to the doom and he says Sodom and Gomorrah Jesus referred to both of them as coming before the coming of the son of man so shall it be like the days of Noah so shall it be like it was in the days of Sodom he referred to Noah so in this sermon Souls that are in prison now which I wanted to focus on this just so you can see this judgment aspect of this revealing of the son of man and just how real it is he is saying he is bringing into this sermon that when Noah entered into the ark it was uh he there was a testimony there was a preaching to the doomed he says Jesus refers to both of them in Luke 17 and the sermon the flashing red lights red light of the sign of his coming he preached it earlier it was in June of that summer he says what will happen just exactly like it was in the days of Noah one day the door of Mercy will be closed right so there's this aspect in the days of Noah that let's we could just be realistic about it that when the floods came and destroyed them all it was too late right it's too late not much you can do at that point so if God was going to say I'm going to end your life at a certain time it just it's just the the the reality that there can come a point where it's like it's time the time has arrived so when the door was shut it when the Genesis says the Lord shut him in by it's necessary for us to think about or I I say not necessary for us to think about it but if God shut him in others were shut out and no matter how much they pounded on that door no matter how much they They begged at that door Noah saying if I could open it I would but I'm not the one that shut it and so it was a a door of Mercy closing now I there are so many scriptures that I've been reading lately on Mercy that it just feel uh it was a real intense wrestling and praying with the Lord to just find the the the focus today to share these things I and I just I pray that it'll be beneficial to you to hear these things though it's so narrow and focused on judgment today but think of this what Mercy if there if the door of Mercy's closed then whatever uh is in that place if door kind of tell me it's access if there was a room to Mercy and if I can make it into this place I have access to Mercy a a and there is uh there's protection or there's something that's granted to me I can obtain as it says in the New Testament obtained Mercy obtained Mercy that if the door is Clos I can't obtain it I no longer have access to it I can't find myself in that place where Mercy is then we then think about the consequence well if Mercy's not available go into the New Testament and maybe we can do some uh some teaching on this in the near future that Mercy is connected with almost every work that Christ did that when they wanted to be healed they pleaded for the mercies of God to be merciful to them so divine healing and the healing of the body is it takes God's mercy to do that and in Titus 3: uh 4 to six as we've read already but after that after we were Sinners and and Le LED astray the kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done these works of the law The Works of the flesh the works of righteousness the thing the correct things that we do we have not earned our Salvation we have not earned our seal we have not earned the love and favor of God but according to his Mercy he saved us his Mercy saved us if there was not Mercy there could not be salvation if there was not Mercy there could not be the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior It Is by God's mercy that he has shed AB Upon Us abundantly washing and regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost it is by his Mercy that we are covered by his blood am amen without Mercy there is no salvation if I can say this no more Mercy means no more Saving right no more Mercy means no more no more healing and I would argue I would probably suggest that if we were to think that there's no more Mercy we probably would all begin to make those conclusions well if there's no mercy there's no salvation so there is this Spectre of judgment there is this concept that the door God as God shut the door in the days of Noah could it be that there would be a time when God has closed it in the door of Mercy is shut and now there's no one else to be saved there there's no more there's no more access as it were to the atonement for Divine Healing there's no more deliverance and so I want to read these statements to you I think we I thought I was doing really horrible on time brother Andrew gave us plenty of time and then I got lost in the prelims which I don't normally do that I'm trying to be better at being a person a human being not just a an Autobot that just immediately goes into preaching and so listen to how brother BR wrestles with this and souls that are in prison now he says I don't know that this thing is true but it's got to be that way sometime right if I could just use his statement from flashing red light at the sign of his coming the door of Mercy being closed I don't know that this thing is true but it's got to be that way sometime it's got to come to that and it could be now okay all right in every way the world will carry right on people still come to the altar they'll still cry out but it won't do no good they'll be gone it'll be over there won't be he says there won't be no mercy the double negative to make a double point no more Mercy remember that and the sanctuary becomes Smoky he that's filled filthy is filthy still he that's righteous is righteous still and he that's holy is Holy still he says he makes this statement several places in the Revelation Jesus Christ Series this the the sanctuary being Smoky and this time of the cleaning of the sanctuary it connects to Daniel different places says there is no mercy when the lamb takes the book that's it that's all of it okay we we can accept that we can see that in the scripture according to Revelations 4 then chapter 5 how that the lamb uh is the The Lion of the tribe of J prevails to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and then the the chapters that follow talk about a lot of different stuff and we can see uh even the judgments that come and the plagues that come and all these things that are poured out upon the Earth and he says when the lamb takes the book that's it that's all of it and it looks a whole like whole lot like it could be now all right let's debate it right what would he be considering that would cause him to say I don't know but it could be now because when the lamb takes the book to me it looks like that's it and so that that's it could be now why why why would he say that I'll leave it to you to wrestle with it he says maybe we have another day maybe today is that day maybe tomorrow is remember how he had said well when Noah went he preached and there was these several days where nothing happened that you would think as soon as the door was shut as soon as the book was taken as soon as things were open boom that's it it's all over but months go by or days go by and things happen it's like what's happening here maybe tonight is the last night maybe this is the last year I don't know friends I'm telling you I don't know it'll never be told me but when God takes that last name and redeems it from that book of life that's all of it they can't they can't be no more anyhow in other words when the last name in the Lamb's Book of Life is that that sealing when that takes place well there what what is the I know this ERS into a whole area that is always fascinating to talk about over good food right with your precious brothers and sisters and Believers in Christ but there has to be there's a line somewhere right that the the there's uh even as the Bible says the days will be short and otherwise there be no flesh saved in other words if we just it's going to continue to a point to where the last has been redeemed and if the days continue there's no more Christians on Earth there's no more witness of God on Earth God by forn knowledge knew those had had elected those to a new birth there's the seed of predestination inside of them the preach of the Gospel by faith you receive that word of God and you're Quicken to life and you make up the body of Christ it's a fulfillment of be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth it wasn't stack people up like cordwood but it was like there's a measure that I want to bring forth that are mine there's a measure of Fellowship there's a measure of my body I need them to come forth but through the fall you have the record of the wheat plant you have the record of human life you have the Book of Life which all men participate in and all men have their name in it but there is a group of people whose names are in the Lamb's Book of Life whose names connect ever be removed that's God's grace that's God's mercy that's God's love nothing you did you know well I got lucky I signed the Lamb's Book of Life instead of the guest book no it's not you that did it there's a mass of humanity that whose names aren't in the record that cannot be removed but yet God still has Grace on them God still has them in a book God still gives them an opportunity but is once that La that life that has Redemption attached to it has been redeemed there can't be any more redeemed right like we all know like once you eat the last Eminem you can't eat any more M&M's there he says that that there can't be no more anyhow that's all it's finished he says again God forbid God forbid bid that what I've said is now may I understand it everybody God forbid do you recognize what he's wrestling with right is the the consequences of certain scriptural events and I would I would even say that if you go back and you read his Revelation series and the different parts and the things that he says even in the breach uh the fourth and fifth six seal the things that he's wrestling with in those sermons you realize that there's a there's something transpiring scripture he sees an event in the scripture that's connected to these things even in its symbolic form and we can say well if this happens this is what happens next so maybe we make assumptions are we envision it happening a certain way and he's saying now if this is where we are now if the imminence of these things are upon us or certain things have happened then could it be that right now is a time where things are over it's done and the only reason why we're still here is because there's this season of time as it was in the days of Noah to where there's that are going to be judged and it's all finished and he says I I God forbid he said I hope it's not I got children that's not in I've got two daughters and a son I've got Brothers I've got my people that's not in God forbid that Grace has left us that all this will only be pretending he says is there Grace left left Lord let me be wrong on this Lord let it be wrong at this time that I it isn't the people still can be saved well I think it really does uh show the heart of brother brandom was it this cultish idea of well you know those of you who are with me in this we're going to be fine and we're going to have some punch served after service it was oh my I've got love there's people I love don't let it be there wasn't this Glee of oh yeah you know they're all all serpent seed are going to get what's coming to them there's even this aspect of this intercession in the prophet Spirit Lord is there Grace left can people still get saved he asked the question later what if it what if it's over what if the third pull coming up now is to preach to the Lost what if all the types are going to show forth now right this is a prophet he's asking questions he's not trying to give you all the answers as a matter of fact he's saying it looks like a whole lot like it could be this way and he said God forbid that it is I hope I'm wrong that it's now I hope that I'm wrong that it's or it's this close that these are the things that are happening I think this is where I want to kind of just transition a little bit he said could it be that the third pulls to preach to the Lost November 11th 1963 Souls that are in prison now I trust that you have learned this about the third pull that if you only take up to this moment brother Ram's teaching about the third pull then you would just have a gigantic question mark over your head and you say well we don't know what it is or what it does but if you stay in the message we now know what it is and what it does and he says and Look Away to Jesus at the end of that year watch the third pull then and it'll be absolutely to the total lost now now is not there's not a hedge necessarily it'll absolutely be to the total lost but it will be for the bride correct he says and the church it'll absolutely be to the total loss but it's not just to the total L could it be that this third poll coming up now is to preach to the Lost we could say that based upon his conclusion here yes yes it is to the lost but it's also for the church it's also for the bride yes it's for those that are going to be judged yes it's for the lost but it's also for the saved it's also for the found in 1 Peter 1: 3 to5 notice this aspect of this great Mercy blessed be God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again and a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead according to what are we born again according to what have we been sealed with the Holy Ghost his abund abundant Mercy if there's no mercy there's no being born again if there's no mercy there's no washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost because it's not by our works of righteousness but according to his work of Mercy that he saved us and according to His abundant Mercy he has begotten us again into a living Lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead having been born again we are raised from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you this baptism of the Holy Ghost being the earnest of full Redemption now we who have received this holy ghost in verse 5 he says who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time salvation requires mercy and for us to be begotten again under a Living Hope and to be washed and regenerated by the renewing of the Holy Ghost it took God 's abundant mercy and now he says to those of us who have obtained this in our hearts are kept by the power of God through faith unto for the purpose of Salvation that is going to be revealed in the end and if there's going to be a Salvation revealed in the end if salvation requires Mercy there's still yet Mercy in the end there could still yet be Mercy in the time of judgment he says in verse 13 wherefore guard up the loin of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ we know that by Grace we are saved through faith that that in itself the grace and the faith is a gift of God not by our works lest any man should boast so it is by grace that we are saved it is by Mercy that we are saved it is by those aspects that our souls are cleansed and purged of sin and the power of God quickens us to life to be filled with the Holy Ghost Christians Sons and Daughters of God baptized of the body of Christ by one Spirit who are kept by the power of God who are sober and hoping to the end for a Salvation to be revealed and a Grace that's to be brought to us by at that revealing a Grace that comes at the revelation of Jesus Christ if I could say this the revelation of the son of man brings judgment there's no question that days of Noah and the days of lot bring judgment but it also brings Grace it also brings the love of God into plain you it brings Mercy in Psalms 102:13 Thou shalt arise oh when he's Rising that would be a tremendous thing it would be a a a heart shaking thing could this be a moment he's Rising now from his place where he has been is is everything changing is everyone eternally doomed but Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her yay the set time has come amen he's going to have mercy upon Zion his work his Mountain his people for the time to have Grace to favor her has come it was a set time and in Genesis 6:8 right there in the day in which God said the wickedness of man is great the end of All Flesh has come before me I will destroy them from the earth God coming down to judge it says but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord in the day when the son of man is revealed when Jesus says the day that no had entered the Ark he said there's your mercy when he says he destroyed them all there's your judgment in Genesis 18: 23 when God had said that I'm going to go down and I'm going to look into Sodom and Gomorrah H because their sin is very Grievous and I'm going to check and see if what I have heard is as as it was the very next response in verse 23 by Abraham it says Abraham Drew near cuz they they begin to go down these Messengers he said wil thou also destroy the righteous with the Wicked This is a this to me is the heart of this Prophet this Abraham who in this moment that he realizes wait you're going to destroy all those that are in the city and there's this instinctive intercession from Abraham's heart Abraham didn't go I'm going to get my son he's already promised it lot where did your Choice get you now buddy boy how are those well-watered planes treating you right he that wasn't his Instinct his Instinct was say will the righteous also be destroyed with the wicked so in the very moment when God pronounces this dispensation of judgment there's this Mercy if I could say this this mediatorial work by Abraham even this intercession by Abraham and this time and this moment it the the the fire hasn't fallen yet the door is not shut yet will you destroy the righteous even with the wicked if I could say this just trying to wrap this up this third pull brings a finality right brings this separation it's a it divides as a necessity now you're not the one that draws a line but brother brandham says could it be that the third pool is to be preached to the Lost he's not trying to limit the scope of the third pool to where the only aspect of the ministry of Christ in the end time is to let everybody know they're eternally lost but he's looking at the consequences right of scriptural events he's thinking about he's looking at the ramifications of the events related to what he's calling the third pool if I could say it this way all could participate in healing everyone can participate in that the fact that someone has been divinely healed which means God by his power and his in his grace and mercy takes someone who is sick someone who has a cancer someone who has a miss limb someone who's blind and the power of God operates upon them to heal them all can participate in that are there barriers to anyone being a beneficial of it yes as far as unbelief and sin there's things that can hinder that but we could you could have someone who is a sinner and someone who is in unbelief and someone who hasn't professed Christ as their savior can in a moment have faith to believe in healing and believe there that they can be healed and be healed even though their soul has not been healed all can even participate in prophesying right people can have prophecy spoken over them they could have the word they could have healing and prophecies and these different gifts manifesting but the third pole is a dividing line as we're seeing we can see in the scripture this revealing of the son of man is Judgment but let me close with just a a few several more statements here and just a couple scriptures have have dozens of scriptures that I could use this this but if he's going to have judgment it requires Mercy it it if there's going to be judgment this judgment requires Mercy or if maybe I could say this way because there is Judgment Mercy can be found there where there is Justice where there is Judgment there's Mercy in Psalms 89:14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of th th Throne we could say yes there he is judging Justice and judgment correct discernment righteousness and judgment are the habitation of thy Throne it's the dwelling it's it's what it is inhabited there that's where you can find it mercy and Truth Shall go before thy face though it be a throne that is inhabited by by Justice and judgment where there is righteousness where there is Justice where there is Judgment there's mercy and truth and Isaiah 16 verse5 and in Mercy shall the throne be established this is just one scripture in many that if there is a judgment Throne we say throne of grace Throne of Mercy if a throne of grace and a throne of Mercy has then changed into a throne of judgment we can always remember that it was first established in Mercy amen and he shall sit upon it in Truth in the Tabernacle of David judging and seeking judgment and Hasting righteousness right truth is in the throne Mercy is in the truth and souls that are in prison now brother man says now Jesus after he had finished his ministry preach to those Souls that were unsavable taking that from 1 Peter 3 their lives had already been extinguished he said he preached to those that were unsavable that could never be saved that could not ever be be saved he says now the Bible tells us that he went and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not now listen to this when mercy was given to them they spurned mercy and now they're waiting for the Judgment oh what a time that must have been so when it's a time of judgment it isn't necessary that immediately there's a consequence right but there's something that's marked saying that they spurned mercy so now they're waiting judgment so that was when was there when was the Judgment executed when was or when was the Judgment pronounced there's a time when you go to your your uh you you can be judged and your sentence and the the actual punishment isn't uh isn't handed down till later which is maybe a parents best trick right when we get home let them think about it for a while but he says when mercy was given them they spurned mer Mercy now they're waiting judgment oh what a time that must have been oh I wish there was some way I could shake the world with that to let them see what the reality is now is he wanting to wave it in their face boo boo you're going to hell no I want them to see the reality of how judgment comes he says all those who rejected the message of the hour before Doom the gospel was preached to the doomed first before they went without mercy so how did they become doomed Noah shut up up was a testimony God shut the door after his third pull it's after Noah was a testimony then once the door shut he says after the third pool at Sodom the door was shut there was no more Mercy but he's he's want I think there's something that we could I mean listen if there was ever a sermon where you want to start to grasp for something to hold on to this would be the sermon right Souls that are in prison out could it be that the word is being preached to the eternally lost what year did he preach that 1963 if there's no more Mercy you can't be saved and when was I born again mom right I I might want to find a new birth certificate I'm just the the youngest looking 69 you've ever seen this is the reality of there's a reality of judgment but notice he's saying the Judgment comes after mercy spurned so if I could say it again you can't have judgment without Mercy cuz God's Jud judgment his Justice is right after the door was shut after these things there is no more Mercy he says Noah went in then after seven days nothing happened in the seven days the Judgment come listen now in closing if only in Noah's time they would have knew that sign if they would have only known now I'm going going to close he says it twice if they would have only know known that sign the world in that day that God proved by reading here by reading of the scripture a while ago he destroyed them people not without Mercy right and to to me it's you're saying what is he is it changing his mind is it different well it's the reality that there's a point at which you make your choice to spurn Mercy he said or a choice is made to spurn Mercy there comes a point where it runs out it's done he says not without Mercy Mercy was sent to them by a prophet they wouldn't believe it God is merciful but he sent Mercy but they wouldn't receive it he always sends mercy first listen can we call Christ a false prophet we blaspheme him and say he's nothing but a just a Jew there's nothing t he's a false figment of the imagination that there's no such thing as Christ the scriptures something concocted later on some kind of hodg podge of a fanasy and then believe that God would be merciful to us yeah I just maybe say it as a question had this conversation one time with a brother who was was was saying that he couldn't accept he couldn't accept that there was this well he say I I can't accept that only these people are going to be the ones that go up in the resurrection and so I just asked him I said okay so you you're taking issue with the line or where the line's drawn and so it's kind of this is explain further say so do you believe that everyone's going to go in the resurrection no okay so there is a line not everyone will go right where do you put it who's left out and I would say well I can't believe you're leaving them out but there is a line not without Mercy but God sent Mercy he always sends mercy first what if they would have known the sign was the end time sign and when they saw all at once salvation led up nobody just the first thing you know the door was closed there was only one person knew the sign that was no one his group that was the only one that knew when the doors swung together no one knew no one knew that was the Finish he knew it that's right if you only knew the sign oh if they would have only known the sign when they seen this one come in and had been up there with Abraham as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot if he only knew the sign if I could emphasize this today in the face of some of these things that are easy to wrestle with and try to figure out that yes if there's going to be time could it be could it be God forbid God forbid but even if it is there's still that God would not judge without first offering Mercy what if that third pole could be to the eternally lost what if it is there I hope it's not what if it is think of it just a minute now what if it is God forbid I've got children but it sure looks pretty close here he says like the pyramid come up through Luther Wesley Pentecost then the capping of the stone Brothers you could come to your instruments could it be that if that's it where are we at it this might I hope it isn't but it's going to be it's going to be just remember them Ministries has to they always dovetail just the same with the other one it has to come God don't change think of it bite your conscience with your spiritual teeth and find out where we're at what if it is and you're still the Way You Are you just might as well then walk you're finished then that's outside after the book was taken by the lamb the sick seal is revealed all the seals it's over it could be I hope it isn't could be that's it's heavy language sure looks pretty close what if and he says this I I wanted to just to catch this he says not by speaking in tongues of Souls and prison now not by dancing in the spirit not by joining church not by fruit of the spirit Christian Science can outs smother any of you on that and deny even Jesus Christ was divine not that but it's the word living there it is if they had only looked he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest and a man that's got the spirit of God in him or woman lives that word lives right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people written Epistles read of all men now if you could just kind of take that into your heart that now you become the heartbeat the predestiny become the heartbeat of the word is that right could the third pull be on what if it is look at the scripture piled in here could it be is the third pull to preach the Eternal Doom that's rejected the message of Salvation well you say the church is going yeah they will we'll go right on just the same but remember all this time Noah was in the ark the bride is sealed with Christ the last members been redeemed the six seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings them back to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him and set down claimed what he owed what he had redeemed is that right so it's always been that third pool right Jesus speaks in the scripture going out into the highways and byways compel them draw them to come what is the pull it's an attraction it's a drawing and yet there is a all that are bidden all that maybe the invitation seems to go out to the calling uh uh that that that may be sent out not all are chosen but yet the call is given and then this gospel cry from these Epistles the word of God being lived draws the chosen into Mercy but the non-elect will push it away into [Music] judgment you say the third pull it's using a a message language we talk about the token we use terminologies that message Believers would understand if you look at it in the scriptural sense there's going to become a Time on earth when it Narrows down and narrows down and there's so many few are that are being saved and one day one day the last one will come in and the door will be shut but as long as I still see healing as long as I still see Souls being dealt with I say Lord let's keep the door open as much as we can Lord let there be room for mercy and it'll be that Mercy that they reject cuz that was his third pull was mercy and that's what was rejected because once Mercy is spurned there's nothing left but judgment but God will never judge someone without first sending mercy God help us in this end time I feel that in my heart the way that I wanted to present this was more from the sense of could it be but I I I I don't want I'm not trying to hide the ball but let me just say that you you can be an Abraham you could be the one that's sighing and crying you could be the one that say oh God once more Lord be merciful may God deal with our hearts our homes may we as a church be a place of his Mercy could we stand together and pray this morning
