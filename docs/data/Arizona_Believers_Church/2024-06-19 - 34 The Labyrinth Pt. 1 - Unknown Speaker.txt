TRANSCRIPT
========================================
like to give a quick review of the simple life we ministered on that I think it was just a couple parts um we could have maybe stayed in that channel a little bit in looking at the simple life and I'll just recapture some sc one scripture and one statement uh we were looking at I've been studying from the message Harvest Time and there's some really key statements that brother BR makes in that that we're very familiar with and how we are the reflection of the message of the hour and it's Christ being lived out through us and it's the life and so we see that Christ is now expressed in the lives of his people not just in the lips of his people not just in the thoughts of his people but in the life that we live and so it's the uh that Harvest Time theme and some of the themes we've been looking at in an honorable home and the simple life is how that it's the Simplicity of obedience to every word of God now I know that when we say the Simplicity of obeying every word of God immediately it's a paradox and we don't know what to do with it but it that is what God wanted to do is Express himself through flesh and he can't do that apart from his word and the theme has been Satan targets where God is expressing himself and how that he is scheming to stop the word of God from being made manifest or God's word from being fulfilled and that's his schemes his attack his Target is always to keep the word of God from being fulfilled now Satan is not trying to keep uh the Messiah from coming as a sacrificial lamb he can't do that it's already happened say st's not trying to keep the children of Israel in bondage in Egypt that uh they've already been delivered and so he's not trying to keep the Jews out of their Homeland they're back there's a lot of things we could say prophetically that Satan uh has attempted to thwart or to stop or probed at and tried to figure out but he's failed in all those things so we're not uh we don't want to be historical but we want to understand things present tense yet looking back historically we can see that Satan is always fighting against Revelation cuz he hates revelation because he's trying to keep God's word from being fulfilled I meant to provide this statement for you I don't think I did but it's from the Harvest Time brother Bram says on the three Temptations of Jesus the three Temptations of ministers where they make their fall three Temptations of the church where they make their fall three Temptations of an organization where it makes it fall and three Temptations in the individuals where they make their fall so we could say wow preachers need to watch out for money women and popularity uh and we might read identify those as uh three Temptations for a minister but he says there's Temptations for a church an organization and individuals so no matter where we are uh there's a VIN diagram where we fit in it a and that we have got either we have nine or 12 or whatever we might be we've got Temptations we need to deal with and chances are those three are the same for each one they just come in a different Channel or different way because we know that all that is in the world is the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life that is summed up in the temptation of the woman in the beginning it's summed up in the temptation of Christ in the wilderness as we just read about it and brother B says watch when you get into the end where the Temptation comes so we could see that the Temptation whether it be a minister a church an organization or individual is going to come through those channels it's going to be in that subtle seducing way and we've been making the point that the tempting of the woman the tempting of Christ identify Satan's schemes today and his Eden today that what he was doing then he's trying to he was trying to accomplish something in this end time so Paul makes this statement and let's look at this scripture together and this has been it has been this scripture that has brought me into this channel in 2 Corinthians 11:3 but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety it's the most dangerous approach it's the most H A Dangerous attack as he has beguiled Eve seduced her through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ it is corruption from the Simplicity that is in Christ it's that phrase there to me that has just been has driven me into looking into the word of God looking into the message of the hour to understand what this Simplicity of Christ is and we recognize through a number of things we could say this that Satan is wanting to still beguile the body of Christ away from the Simplicity that is in Christ and Paul says I fear and not that he feared inappropriately and not that this was not uh an attribute of the love that he had for the Corinthian Church but he feared that as the serpent beguiled Eve Satan would also begu the church and in the beguiling or the seducing it would corrupt them from again the phrase the Simplicity that is in Christ that's uh at the Forefront of our thoughts and last Wednesday it may have been very uh rich and very uh dense in terms of how that overlays with prophecy in this hour and how it overlays with the message of the hour and how that even though we would look to and believe very significant things have happened and transpired in terms of the Fulfillment of scripture it still comes down to living the life a a and being humble and these different attributes it comes back to the Simplicity the Simplicity that God hides himself in I've been thinking it just seems like more and more as it comes to me meditating on a lot of things from day to day in our prayer life and the different things that we're concerned about even in our own homes our own personal lives I've been thinking a lot about as we've ministered on just the Simplicity of everyday life and home life and our relationships with one another and the atmosphere we create in our home there's a lot of things just about even the minutia of everyday life but I've been thinking about it in terms of what it means to be restored to Eden or to an Eden condition and this restoration of the Garden of Eden is coming back to Eden as it's so pronounced in the message of the hour I've been thinking a lot about that and I think it has I'm hoping tonight in some ways that the concept of being restored Back to Eden can be more practical in our everyday lives and we're not just looking for uh some sort of trip back in time to whatever it was for the man and the woman but yet there's something that God's wanting to bring to us and restore to us in this hour and and I I feel like maybe there's something missing in that explanation but it's at the at the core of my heart now I will say this I apologize that it's on a Wednesday night after 7:30 but you might want to wake yourselves up I think this is going to be kind of dense some of you might feel like you're getting a classical education others might feel like you didn't want to take Greek mythology in college and now you are but we're going to get into some stuff but we're going to do it under the guidance of the message of the hour so my title is this is part one of the labyrinth and in and that's my my title this is my title slide and uh so uh brother Scott's not here so I don't have my help when it comes to Latin I I might have spelled it wrong Labyrinth is a weird word to begin with but uh that's this is the concept everybody familiar with the the concept of a a labyrinth like a puzzle or a maze is what some people might call it but in chapter 7 of the church age book brother brandham is writing and he's talking about that particular age and he comes to this place in the church age book where he refers to John Amos cenus and he was a 7th Century theologian he was a reformer and he wrote a work in 1668 called Unum necessarium and there's different ways it's translated but brother Bram translates it to one thing needful and you may be familiar with it it's in the it's in page 254 in the church age book it starts out on the last full paragraph I think it's paragraph three and if you're just reading it you might think well this is what brother brandham these are brother branham's words through uh brother Vil or these are words that brother Brandon Penn but as you look at it he speaks of uh comenius and the one thing needful it was originally in Latin and he wrote some other works uh many Works he's actually very renowned in many different ways I think he's considered the father of modern education not as a Bad Thing necessarily but uh he's quite a reformer but as you read through it you'll find there's different quotations uh on page 255 they end all the way in page 256 and you might have heard the statements read before and you thought these are brother bram's words but he's actually uh uh it doing it a different kind of translation maybe than some other ones but he's quoting commenius from this what he calls one thing needful or one thing necessary is how others might say it but it's uh this he's quoting from these this writing and so I want to walk us through this Unum necessarium about comenius and this use of the labyrinth that brother Brandon refers to in the church age book anybody here want to raise their hands and say yep I've read that I'm familiar with brother talking about the labyrinth in the church age book we got a f a whole family that's heard it before very good chur what's that went to their church I was actually going to maybe just have a little conversation about that because some of his most pronounced writings in 1631 to 1638 were all written in check and so um that's kind of neat we'll have to talk about that later isn't that the picture you sent me that one time see if you guys just excuse us for a moment we're having a moment and so in the uh in the Unum necessarium when he begins to get into what he's talking about he opens up this is where he starts he starts off with creation and he uses very rich language to describe it and and he's saying how that man was made in the image of God he's made in the likeness of God and he was made a God on Earth and he was given a three-fold duty and he's just kind of summarizing things and this is the three-fold duty that he gave man it's the duty of contemplating things to learn what each one is and I provided these just so it might make it easier for you um to zone out but make it look like you're paying attention but it's the first is the duty of contemplating things to learn what each one is so there's things in God's creation that man was placed upon Earth and there was all sorts of great intricacies and complexities of his creation there was a lot of things for man to consider Ponder if you want to use that word and there to he was to contemplate and then learn from God's creation what each thing in God's creation was and we recognize that creation came from the word of God and and this is commenius his words and he says then he has the duty of working something out of them that as he learns in the contemplation of things he's to work something out of them in other words he's to adapt uh them for his use or in some way or another that he's as he learns things he uses them because God provided them for some use that God had a reason for them and I guess I will say this cuz I'm sensing already uh I'm drawing this from where brother brandham pointed it to and he quotes from this huge part these different parts from this part in this uh Unum necessarium and I'm just drawing from this brother Brandon put his finger on it and I'm just drawing from and giving some background from the for the statements that brother Brandon makes in that church age book and then this third one the duty of using and enjoying them for pleasure now I will say say this I'm not I'm not offering this to you for you to agree with for you to say Amen or that's the absolute truth sharing with you what commenius wrote and then you let the Lord can kind of Quicken to you how that's applicable in your life how that might line up with scripture or how you would balance it out with the word of God but this is how he viewed it that man had a three-fold duty of contemplating things in order to have an understanding that he might use those things or work something out by them and then using them in a way that would give them pleasure and this is all all the the right kind this is according to the will of God so he makes this statement and you follow this because I think this is very good he said God planted a paradise of pleasure which he had created for man to name them by I I don't remember that part in it but you go back to Genesis chapter 2: 19 so it was Adam then was going to be standing there some things were going to be brought to Adam he was going to look at him and in the words of comus he was going to contemplate he was going to look at how God made them he was going to look at their uh unique traits and maybe what they did and their different characteristics and through contemplation he was to name each animal so there was a process that God was putting the man through to where he wasn't just you know rolling the dice or or just drawing names from a hat he wanted man to to to think and to process and to understand and wrestle even with the image that God was bringing before him so be based upon his conclusion that in Genesis 2: 19- 20 he led all the animals uh as part of his work for him to name them through contemplation he said so it follows this is his conclusion it follows that the happiness of man consist now this is uh you think about this for our own lives that's really what I I don't want us to miss out on this this is not historical or hysterical the purpose of this is for us to think about our lives the context of our lives today in Satan's Eden and how mankind has been wrestling with this and how that the word of God is the answer for it he says so it follows that the happiness of man consist in the clear light of the intellect for correctly observing the differences between things in the favorable outcome of actions for producing good works in the secure enjoyment of good things for the true satisfaction or saity of the mind and quiet for the quietness of the mind for peace now I know this this is written in Latin then translated to English but maybe we could look at it in the sense that the happiness of man is tied to his Clarity of mind in being able to discern between good and evil know what's right and know what's wrong in that are just observing the differences between things and that there be a favorable outcome in his actions so you recognize what he's saying that it's good that a man would have be of a sound mind and that there would be a favorable outcome of his actions for producing good things and good works and that in that he would enjoy he he would have this security and he have quietness and peace a Peaceable habitation and quiet resting place and these are ways of just even describing what Eden was supposed to be this paradise of God now this is man is he was originally intended to be then commus says that through the fall of humanity there's now a three-fold unhappiness so as you've been writing this down H you'll be tested on this later you won't get a free Knife Set or Parry knife though that there is a uh is there is a three-fold duty of man and then this uh the happiness of man consisting in these three thinks he says there's a three-fold unhappiness now this is this first one is are are my words as I tried to um interpret it I guess or summarize it but the frustration of thought and how he describes this is these are the this is a man's threefold unhappiness that of thinking clearly and being able to observe differences between two things is part of man's happiness then the frustration of thought or errors in thinking are part of man's unhappiness he calls hallucination or the falsity of the intellect to where we're we're we think we're smart we're intelligent and the mind figures things out and sees things but he's frustrated because there's heirs in his thinking some of our most renowned behavioral uh scientists would say these are biases these are the her istics in man's mind which causes him to think one way but in real the reality is different it's the falsity of intellect and I see these things is kind of building together because of the frustration of thought there's the frustration of enjoyment man has a tendency to uh overestimate how much he'll enjoy something I'm starting to summarize a bunch of stuff now but then do it and then overestimate uh underestimate how badly they hated it after the fact this is going to be great this going to be wonderful it's horrible but then after the fact it was great it was wonderful and so it's just uh the the way that we assess value the way that we transact the way that we think of things often leads to a frustration of enjoyment and comius called this HS in acting so man's happiness is connected with the frustration of thought or erors in thinking that the frustration of enjoyment the erir is in acting this continual he calls it a continual exhaustion of strength and then the frustration of Desire its erors in wanting so you have the thinking the acting in wanting this is that he calls it a continually reoccurring uh uh bothersome uh uh hunger and thirst for desirable things that he he observes this three-fold unhappiness frustration air in thinking erors in acting air in wanting the frustration of thought frustration of enjoyment frustration of Desire these this falsity of intellect this exhaustion of strength and this bothersome lust and hunger after desirous things and he makes this statement these three he's referring to this these frustrations and these heirs these three have been wandering sadly through the whole human race all the way from the first man our origin because he deserved it he was ejected from Paradise into the Earth which was cursed on account of sin now what he's doing is he's he's looking at man in the present state in the 17th century and he's looking at things and he's saying wow uh this is a mess and he he ties it all the way back to the beginning and said ever since the fall where a man had a three-fold duty and that he was to find happiness in these three things now there's a three-fold unhappiness because these things he uses it wandering sadly through Humanity ever since the fall ejected out of paradise into the earth the earth which was cursed so he and through a couple Pages goes to the almost the entire Book of Ecclesiastes and he summarizes Solomon's observations and also he says the complaints of wise men throughout every age said wise men in every age have made these observations namely Solomon the wisest man in all the world who observed these three things that all the Affairs of men are confusing don't you like it when it's just so easy to take notes and you're all thinking man I'm just going to repr preach this when I get a chance but all the Affairs of men are confusing this is that's what Solomon concludes right this is some of his are not his ultimate conclusion but as he looks at things he's like the all the Affairs of men are confusing and labor is full of trouble I believe that as he's drawing from the scripture he looks at how Solomon is talking about it's void of the fruits that man would like to have from it because there's nothing good for man to do this and enjoy it but then what's what's left afterwards it just becomes this labor is only full of trouble and you can see how these build there is grief instead of joy and Perpetual Affliction of spirit there is grief and Perpetual infliction in man as he as the Affairs are confusing labor full of trouble so he has grief instead of joy and his spirit is continually Afflicted so commenius concludes Solomon the wisest of Mortals filled his books with laments of this sort he filled his own life however with examples of Errors of trouble and penitence penitence which look at Solomon who's concluding these things and he's wise but what does he try to do he tries all sorts of things to find happiness and he runs after so many things and it's from this book of Ecclesiastes there Solomon says Man by mixing himself has made himself miserable things have become more complicated and things have gotten bigger and out of control and he was the widest of all Mortals and he FS all his books with the Lamentations and his observations and Ecclesiastes and Lamentations and he's are not just Lamentations but he's lamenting in these things and he finds himself uh pouring his heart out but yet he fills his own life with the examples of erors of thinking frustration of enjoyment frustration of Desire it's at this point in Unum necessarium that commenius turns to Greek mythology and how that and he's he's doing this for a reason and I find that it's not it's not uh it's not a waste of time it wasn't fruitless for him to do so but it also even would help us to understand scripture because these these are the things that Paul was facing in his day the the the the Greeks and their mythology and even how in the book of Acts that they attributed they assigned characteristics to Paul and Barnabas uh uh to Greek gods and things there was a h uh this is the kind of mindset uh that gripped and held um the the Gentiles in that region at this time so commenius observes that the Greek mythologist made the same observations but yet they express them in their mythology or their fables so commenius uses three fables that he says Identify the wondering and unhappiness of mankind and those three are the cian Rocks the Delights of Tantalus and the Labyrinth ever heard of these read these I'm looking at the one guy I think that would and he's looking than he's looking at me with this you got it all wrong brother thank you Professor but the cian rocks and that's the one where the the he's he's condemned to just P push a rock up heill and it rolls back down again and that's just the entirety of it the Delights of Tantalus and the the Labyrinth these are ones that he is going to use in this Unum necessarium uh to identify in the the unhappiness and the wondering of mankind so he's saying that there's some allegory in these fables there's some truth in these mythologies that express the same observations of Solomon so he makes this statement come let us apply ourselves a little to these fictitious accounts of the Labyrinth of cyphus and of tentalus so that we may bring to light and better understand the evils of our time and swiftly apply the remedies doesn't that sound so inviting like yeah I want to read that I want to understand this because I want to know the evils of my day and I want to swiftly apply the remedies and he's wanting to draw from something that would be familiar to the academics familiar to the Greeks familiar to the educated and even the theologians of that time he wanted to look at fictitious narratives fables this mythology but bring out of them this this representation or this analogy to life so that he could understand in the 17th century the evils of that time and then swiftly apply I like that swiftly apply the remedies I believe his full title not in the Latin was the one thing necessary to know what is necessary in life and death and after death and I think he says the conclusions of an old man after he lived uh uh in The Labyrinth here is in his 70s or so and he's coming to the the end of his life and he's realizing man he's even repented of some of his Theology and his ideology and he's realizing I at times got caught up in these things a and was the the I was cfus and I was Tantalus or I was caught up in these this Labyrinth and now I'm recognizing that there's just one thing necessary everybody seems to be with me so far this is where it gets uh in particular I want to get into the Labyrinth a little bit that he's drawing from so brother brandham uses the phrase the Labyrinth the Labyrinth I think it's maybe three or four times in the church age book he makes reference and quotes specifically meanus his use of the labyrinth and brother Bram I Believe by taking out those little Snippets wanted us to digest that so if you say well brother Aaron do we need to read one thing necessary no I'm doing that for you uh it's in the church book you could read it I believe God could speak to you and give you what you need in the things that brother mam taught I feel led to get into what he taught a and bring this out to emphasize the truth of the word of God so in The Labyrinth I think it's uh commus may call them mytholog gians used even this uh mythology or this telling of the labyrinth as kind of this symbolizing the the the human life and how there's perplexities on every side and it's full of difficulties and how that man cannot untangle disentangle or untangle himself untangle himself from these complexities these perplexities and these difficulties without unless God gives wisdom H there's some higher wisdom or some other power now a labyrinth we may think of it in terms of like a uh a puzzle or a maze there's some distinctions I'm finding as I study this one they some might bring out on a uh a granular level but it's a complex or circuitous path you might have done this in a a maze Garden or some Gardens might contain like a labyrinth or corn maze might be another way you think in terms of elaborate but it's this complex circuitous path that leads from beginning points to a center so the Labyrinth kind of has a you're arriving at the center of something this is the way that it's expressed even in the mythology it comes from Greek mythology and it being mythology it's not like you can just go to the library and check out the book that was written by a man named Greek and it was called mythology it's kind of a collection a lot of these things have been carried for forward through oral tradition and Homer and different things but it in this Greek mythology it it you can take it from there's other ways to look it up but Theus and minitar uh and the minitar are the is where this story you might have heard it before and there's different ways it might be called even the Labyrinth or or minus the king of cre um these different mythologies now stay with me I want you to hear this and I don't want to get caught up in the too much of the details and trying to bring out the type but this is the story of the labyrinth minus the king of creit had a wife pacifi and she was well let me just say this as comia says she was of perverted lust and pacif in a fit of lust committed adultery and in the telling she commits adultery with the bull and gives birth to a monster now just use your use your minds and in terms of what is going to come forth and the Minotaur then is this unnatural offspring of a woman and a beast it's a half man and a half bull the head of a bull and the body of a man is that manitar that you might often a minitar that you often see the minitar would be that representation not a centaur but this menar as one poem put at the lower part of a beast a man above the Monument of their polluted love now you see the parallel that when comenius is going to take and use the example of the labyrinth for Mankind's predicament that goes back to the beginning wherein the woman is tempted and she falls in the garden and so in The Labyrinth and in this Greek mythology aesus in the minitar the king orders the construction of a labyrinth uh as punishment for the menur and he's going to imprison him and he's at the very center of this Labyrinth this very complex creation by this architect this designer who kind of played a very critical role even in the fall of the woman and the wife and then he's casting others who are condemned to death other uh Bad characters they're cast into this Labyrinth and in the story they would either be devoured by minitar or they would perish from Hunger so the minitar is there at the center of this Labyrinth and he feeds on human flesh and the the the Serpent's meat and eating the dust of of the earth and all these things you can see this connection back to scripture and so only in the mythology only thesis escapes the Labyrinth he kills minitar and so this is what the Labyrinth is in this telling it's filled with endless Halls so all sorts of entryways and passageways and staircases that go up and down and it's of this confusing construction so that one who is in it wanders about continually and never finds an exit that you follow this passage way and one's leading you in then it takes you further out and it's up and down in these endless halls and this uh all these entryways and staircases and it's it's done in such a way to confuse one so that they never find the center or find the exit and brother B makes this statement about commus he compares the world to the Labyrinth he compares the world to the laby and shows that the way out of it is by leaving what is needless and choosing the one thing needful Christ This is a summary of what comenius is building everything on if he takes time to explain Solomon's observations if he takes time to bring in the Greek mythology as he takes time to look at uh the three-fold unhappiness or the three-fold duty of man and what gives him happiness really at the end of the day he's trying to show that the world that we pleas presently live in and unpleasantly live in is a labyrinth as it were it's filled with endless halls and enticements and passageways and directions and it's confusing and we wonder about continually never really finding the source of happiness never really finding things that matter a and why is it this the world is so much like the Labyrinth uh in the mythology because the Labyrinth gave rise after similar acts that took place in scripture brother BR he says he compares the world to the Labyrinth and comia says for while we live in truth each of us has his own Labyrinth his bothersome occupations which in turn develop others we all have these bother bothersome occupations we all have these frustrations of thought and enjoyment and desire we all have our labyrinths that are leading us on continually but we never really find the satisfaction we never find what he said we ought to have the satisfaction of the mind and a quietness and to be at rest we're never finding the contemplation which if I could say in our present world of the labyrinth it's trying to steal our moments of contemplation a as it's been it's emphasized maybe even more and more in the secular world and in the Christian world and as we've emphasized even from this Pulpit that we are never bored and entertainment and some sort of H H uh sensitizing of the mind or some emotion is always at our fingertips to where there's no silent contemplation and this even entering into to and embracing boredom so we can contemplate matters and understand things to get the enjoyment that God wanted us to out of life and we all have our Labyrinth as this might seem to be shrouded in a lot of Greek mythology or academic and a lot of fancy terminologies I hope that in some way it strikes a cord in your heart to recognize that brother Brandon wanted us to see that this world has become a labyrinth and that the only way out of this Labyrinth where we're pursuing needless unnecessary things is to choose the one thing that is necessary and that's Christ so Paul writes in 2 Corinthians chap 11 we'll read verses 3 and 4 for you for I fear lest by any means as a serpent beg guiled e through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not not preached he says for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel now notice how as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety and we could read in the temptation of the woman just how that played out and Yeah hath God not said that you shall not eat of every tree of the garden he says oh yeah we can do this we can't do that says oh you won't surely die and it seems to be running along this singular track to get her to see something a certain way so that she would partake in it and now Paul say says that as the serpent beguiled Eve he says that one could preach another Jesus that you have not has not already been preached and also another Spirit which you have not already received or another gospel which you had that you have not already accepted and that you might sustain it that you might give it life that you might support it that you might keep it going and a and believe the lie as it were and these things are relevant for the time that we're living in now because we got to watch where the Temptation comes in the end it's coming to these same kind of channels where it's another Jesus it's another gospel it's another Spirit but it's very subtle but as a serpent beguiled the woman in the beginning we could say it this way that in the paradise the beginning the simple life of man as commenius describes it even as brother brandom narrows it down we could see that man was to keep every word of God as reading even how that the way that you could uh uh just set it forth and in the beginning just how simple it was for Adam and the woman this is what you're to do this is what you're not to do they had commission and they had a Prohibition this is what you're to do this is what you're not supposed to do brother Bram called it in God's power of transformation he called it God's economy of Innocence so this was his economy his arrangement this mode of operation this system of interaction economy means the household management it was the first family it was the first home it it represents to us what our home lives ought to be like it represents to us what church should be it was to be represent uh the the paradise was to be representative of heaven heaven on Earth God's economy of Innocence no corruption everything is pure there was Freedom From Evil there was freedom from wrong that even in the prohibition it wasn't that evil is lurking but it was do this don't do that there was no sin as we know it today there was well let's I mean is that not the best way to say it it was God's economy of innocence and look where we are today and so Ser the serpents begal and Eve is symbolized in The Labyrinth in the adultery of pacifi can you see that I know it's crude and maybe I'm trying to stay within the confines of the message of the hour but we know what brother I'm taught on the original sin we know what scripturally the original sin is and what it produced and it's this very thing that comus picks up on himself and says that bull Satan seduced in the beginning and brought an Unholy mixing and now again it's pacif e is I is the the name of the queen or that wife of the king of cre minus his uh wife her act and that fit of lust and even as she tries to defend herself later and say why would I do that i' be crazy to lust after that and that's so outlandish and that's so bizarre the the the thing I've been accused of and you can see it's it's this image of the woman in the beginning Now read this together with me just see how commus breaks this down and I think it's just beautiful the way he outlines this had a conception this is the man and the woman they had a conception by the symbol of the two trees of Good and Evil life and death notice how he broke that up the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and the tree uh the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and he said it symbolized good and evil life and death he says they ought to have struck stuck to good and life so it's a it's a unique way of separate you have the tree of life and you have good and evil so it's life and death good and evil he brings that kind of symmetry out he said they ought to have stuck to good and Life to experience opposites which means good and evil or life and death was not necessarily not necessary nor useful and so it was prohibited it's almost just going back to why would why would it be necessary for man uh to experience good and evil or life and death he says it's not it was not necessary for man therefore it was prohibited but we know it was necessary for the plan of God so there is this in comes the persuasion of Satan but because they were persuaded by Satan and led by their own curiosity they chose the latter Alternatives and they turned to the Forbidden tree of knowledge of Good and Evil this we recognize the woman first the man following in his Disobedience this first and Crest a became the root of all their following mistakes and perplexities I want you to notice that once they start out in this path of lust and once there is this frustration of thought this air in thinking it then becomes the the air in acting and then there's this wanting and This calamity uh that that follows forth from the act and from their thirst but he says notice how from the root of their mistake for soon they blushed when they realized they were naked they looked for coverings which would help not at all they fled from God the Fountain of all good things they contrived lies in the place of sincere humble confession of their he and so they slipped from one offense into another into what a cunningly made Labyrinth The Infernal datalist knew how to lead them we would say and to what a cunningly made Labyrinth the devil knew how to lead them that in making the mistake they weren't aware of oh my goodness we've sinned let us pursue after God so that we could atone and we could repent and we can be cleansed and purged but rather they hid from him tried to cover themselves in religion uh thinking they could hide from God than lie to God and he says look at how they fallen into the Labyrinth and what is it in The Labyrinth in the story of the Greek mythology the this the the the fit of lust it brought forth a monster the man and the woman being the Divine a and the serpent being from the earth and Satan with his powers uh the deformer you had a mix now through this the it brings forth a monster we could say Cain we could say the the the minitar if you want to look at in the mythology but it was a mix of that which is beautiful and Heavenly the man the Divine and the satanic which is deformed and it is the woman who is enticed to be like God and the woman is said God do know that the day that you eat thereof you shall become as Gods possessing a greater knowledge a greater conscience a greater awareness so there was this enticement that she would become as God but in trying to become like God with a greater conscience and even God saying now look they've become like one of us to know good and evil now they are like God with this greater conscience but they become like Satan in disobeying God so now even in the act that produces the one it's joined with the other to where you have the mixing of the Divine and the satanic thus God at this Unholy Union and this mongering however you want to put it this hting God allowed the world that he made for Mankind's enjoyment that he made by his spoken word that the Bible said was made by his wisdom God allowed that world to become a labyrinth and now this world I believe brother brandham is telling us in the church age book through a number of different statements but then also as commenius says it's full of air exhaustion and delusion in Proverbs chapter 21 verse 16 it says the man that Werth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the Dead that wandering that lack of understanding that frustration of thought which leads the ER in acting and the the air of wanting the man that Werth out of the way of understanding that's why understanding and wisdom is the answer not of this world not of fables and theologies but the understanding of God the understanding of the wisdom of God and the plan of God the Plan of Redemption uh the purpose of God the life of God a man that wanders out of the way of understanding will remain in the congregation of the Dead unless God would rescue us and give us that quarter that line to to rescue us from the Labyrinth we're all remaining in the Labyrinth of dead to either be consumed by the Minotaur or to die of hunger man WTH out of the way of understanding in The Labyrinth commenius writes all are sent into it and all wonder about it Without End as the witness of Solomon and all wise men and sad and continuous experience itself are agreed upon that's your part Solomon concludes it all wise men and then the sad and continuous experience itself our own experiences can agree that man are sent into the Labyrinth of Life Born into this world of chaos and sin for the whole world is a great Labyrinth this is where brother bram's drawing where he says he compares the world to a labyrinth for the whole world is a great Labyrinth with innumerable lesser ones enclosed puzzle within a puzzle you know some I I I I like those mind puzzle you have to figure out how to get it off and and then the real hard part is how to get it back on it's like the and these things that open up in Puzzles and the different layers he's saying it's the world is a labyrinth and then there's an immeasurable uh uh Labyrinth enclosed in the world so that there is no one who does not wonder about some Labyrinth and some wonder about many if we could look at the minds of all men now instead of transporting ourselves to 1668 and trying to figure out you know as they chewed on their straw and Whitted or whatever uh what their labyrinths must have been but think of today just how much more pronounced I mean don't we feel like we're in labyrinths at times within a labyrinth right I mean just it's just over and over and over again it's like maze after Maze and you get out of one I'm in another one you get to the center of one you find there's another one that opens up if we could look at the minds of all men we would see entangled thoughts fantastic wonderings and great circling about then he just takes a very simple thing take the languages of mankind and you'll find an infinite chaos of extremely confusing sounds and Concepts as he writes this in a language that's no longer used except in Mass I guess or for the academics he says the language of man infinite numbers of chaos extremely confusing sounds and Concepts take the labors with which all under the sun occupy themselves and likewise you find innumerable perplexities either of circles or of a dead in passageways going up and down back and forth forth right and left if Solomon wisest of men the richest man in his kingdom still found his occupations a labyrinth for he often confessed this and complained grievously and his offspring experienced it worse what kind king or Prince or Noble even what private citizen dare promise himself immunity from Eternal wanderings and troubles if Solomon himself the one that's ued with all wisdom and all wealth and all opportunity would complain that in all his occupations and busyness in thoughts a and thinkings and acting and enjoyments that he would conclude that all is elaborate that grieved him and even his offspring experienced it worse how can we whether we be king Noble we as private citizens think dare think that we are immune from these wanderings and troubles he then says this and I'm breaking this up a little bit says but to return to the toils of the present life if we could think of the time we're living in now in this Leo Dean age I say that if anyone has a desire to Go Through the Ages Sexes ranks and Orders of mankind he will find nothing but labyrinths and rocks and Perpetual frustrations of desires there's your the Labyrinth syphus and Tantalus even in those things no matter what age you are what gender you are what rank you are what order you're from you'll find nothing but labyrinths in rocks and Perpetual frustrations of desires he says for the Youth have labyrinths labyrinths the agent have theirs nor do men or nor women lack theirs Farmers Artisans Merchants soldiers have their troubles and who doesn't in all of life it was this part to me that just really struck deep philosophers and others given to the study of wisdom seek antidotes against the Hees of the mind and against a life of trouble but how much they have found in part their own complaints and in part their Perpetual quars quarrels known to the world bear witness that even those who we would say they were the ones to sit down and figure it out for us they're the ones that contemplated that asked the hard questions that wrestled with the meaning of life and in their philosophies and their philosophizing to think of the erors of the mind and to think of the life of troubles and how can we guard against it and how can we figure these things out they of themselves complain of their Perpetual quarrels their lack of agreements and all bear witness that even the smartest and the most intelligent and the most wise cannot figure this life out it is absolutely amazing in the field of Behavioral economics wherein they've studied that there's certain Tendencies and there's ways to do this and there's cheating and there's dishonesty and and one would be caused to do these different things and given these different opportunities and they would say that even even when you're warned ahead of time that you're going to do it you can't keep yourself from doing it cuz it's so ingrained in humanity and then the part that is just kind of like I don't know if it's meta or what it would be but like the most tent of all of it is the very ones doing the study on dishonesty have been found to be dishonest that they faked the data that they did this and they did that and it's like well okay throw all the data out the window you are a perfect example of what you were trying to prove cuz no matter how much we can educate ourselves on human bias no matter how much we could study the Labyrinth to try to figure it out and make our way successful in this world and say oh I found this path or I know one that went this way the lath in itself is the congregation of the Dead the only way that we can live is to leave what is needless and choose Christ and Paul says I fear lest by any means as a serpent beguiled e through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ just think of just how many more Paul says the Simplicity that is in Christ and the beguiling of Eve and then when we read it we could just turn it into a nice little allegory and a cute little story and as they've watered it down today that the woman was just happily going through the garden a and a beautiful snake said would you like an apple and she's like whoa that's a beautiful Apple yes I would like that apple and that she eats this apple and God's like shame on you for eating the fruit cursed be everything the serpent the Earth you are going to be cursed a childbearing and I'm going to turn the world in laborate because you you ate an apricot or you ate an apple and and it just makes a nice story to where it's uh you know it's written in children's books and portrayed in such a way to where you could tell that story there's no harm in it but even in looking at it in that symbol the symbolisms of the act and even if we wanted to then begin to not take the entire Fable or mythology and I'm certainly not trying to try to type it all out well then thesis is this and then there's this it just never ends the mythology part that in this Labyrinth concept that brother bandam identifies and even what gave your eyes to the labyrith when we go back to this fit of lust and this committing of adultery we could see that well in the beginning they were not to mix they were not to do this and they were to do this there's a commandment and the prohibition but now think of where things are today what opportunities to sin did the man and the woman find themselves in in their day-to-day lives there between Genesis 2 and Genesis 3 and then think today and the enormity and the multiplicity and as the innumerable distractions and temptations that we face every day versus her Temptation that singular one comenius writes it this way who can number the labyrinths labyrinths of astronomy geography history and all the students are saying yep chronology medicine chemistry Alchemy think of all the things he's talking about these are all labyrinths if you've committed yourself to one of these already you've come upon insoluable mazes none of them have all the answers none of them could put their finger on it and conclude uh uh put a period and say this is it then he then he really this makes so much sense is in our present time Prudence in ruling human societies is called politics and its advisor is jurist Prudence we laugh we laugh hearing it but this is at the time this was the great rescuer of society this is what's going to hold Society together and make Men of Integrity is when you have politics and the Prudence in ruling human societies as they we coales to try to find Common Ground they use politics and jurist Prudence was to be its advisor the end of these is to keep human Affairs and the human race itself in order peace and in Tranquility that's the purpose of jurist prudence and politics in its beginning but this is how he observes it then but how they are kept all public squares courts and councils bear Witness for they are never peaceful but always bustling with quarrels and arguments but much more the Perpetual Wars between people and kingdoms Proclaim this with them the world is destroying itself in a terrible fashion politics isn't the rescue jurus Prudence isn't the rescue he's saying everything from astronomy geography history chronology medicine chemistry Alchemy politics jurus Prudence you name it any discipline of man is empty it is a labyrinth the temptation of the woman seem so straightforward do this don't do this the devil got her to do the what was prohibited now what do we face today the Labrinth Jesus finds himself in in the darkest time in human history at that time Bible says that man sat in darkness they were wandering astray out of the P way of understanding among the congregation of the dead and Christ comes as the Messiah once he's identified by that Dove and the witness from the father says in Matthew chapter 4 that he was led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and here we find this parallel to the temptation of the woman and the tempter came to him and said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread now brother BR this is what he takes in the Harvest time and it seems to me that everything turns on this command that these Stones be made bread he was hungry his body needed food if man does not eat he dies surely it was necessary surely it was needful but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God I I I would rather starve to death if eating would mean disobeying because for me to combine life with disobedience is exactly what happened in the beginning for me to try to trade or transact or figure out a way to sustain and keep things going or or to be successful but yet to do it in becoming disobedient to Satan it produces the Labyrinth that I was not meant to walk in that I was not meant to live in he says man shall not live by bread alone this to me becomes the foundation of the Escape it becomes the first strand of navigating out of the labyrinth but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God I must find that cord I must find that path I must find every word of God and last I think that I'm standing there trying to observe the whole universe a and string it all together to make sense of it I must find it as a light into my feet a light into my path in the moment that I'm living at that very time the woman had all the understanding that she needed to say no to the devil but she stepped into darkness beyond the path that God had given her and she wandered out of the way of understanding to become the first of the congregation of the dead and here now Christ is being tempted with all these things that exist in all the world this Labyrinth of humanity command these Stones be made bread if thou be the Son of God no man shall not live by bread alone bread alone is not living but true life is to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and Jesus's Temptation doesn't end there he faces seemingly three different Temptations He faces the temptation of all that is in the world the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life the woman has singular conversation and this singular temptation as it's recited us and she gives in and the sin uh uh she brings forth that that that that human and beast combined together and the Labyrinth that man is Born Into th this is that uh unfolding of chaos from the beginning and then when Jesus comes when he says no to the devil there's another Temptation he says no there's another temptation now we Face the same thing today if this is he if it's if it's too much I know that even people that love me I'm very very faithful I I I just say this with love in my heart to say brother Aaron they told me brother Aaron your ministry is not really for me but they love me and they're faithful because maybe I speak in sometimes in ways and of different things that they might just not think like why couldn't you just do this a different way and I realize and my response was well if I thought my Ministry was for everybody I'd be depressed because just look at the size of the church it's there's not you know Six Trillion people in it you know something's wrong uh but I know my Ministry is not for everybody I know that there may be some tonight that might be wrestling with these things that I'm sharing and you have every right every right to do so and I would hope that you you just find your peace with God and follow the holy spirit that you have in your life but I believe that God is wanting to express something to us tonight in a way to get our attention how that our personal lives our homes and our churches and all this world have become these innumerable labyrinths that never bring the satisfaction and quietness that we truly want who can number all these labyrinths in life and then listen to this I believe I might have provided this for Satan has a sophist brother Brandon quote you'll find this in the church age book he speaks of Satan being a sophist for Satan as a sophist never gives in to arguing you catch that he's never going to give in AR if you argue with the Devil he's kind of like keep yes I've got what I wanted as long as you argue with him it gives him life it fuels him he figures as long as you're willing to engage with me and rationalize and argue and try to do the Apologetics or whatever he's like I'm not going to get tired of this I promise you then he says but we unfortunate recruits the sons of Eve just like our mother one after the other are LED little by little from what is better and what is true we fall somehow all the way to Universal apostasy from the Faith Life and hope of Christ we the unfortunate recruits the sons of Eve just like our mother are LED little by little away from what is best away from what is true away from what is Faith Life and Truth hope the way the hope of Christ seemingly to Universal apostasy there's some weight to that brother bman the sermon Harvest Time says it this way and I'll go back in Genesis which is the beginning Genesis means the beginning we find that God gave his family eternal life as long as they stayed in his word and lived by his word but when they broke it just one Link in the chain of promises death struck them which was a promise also it's a chain you are hanging over hell with it and that's the only thing that'll carry you through when the believer becomes a makeb Believer and lives on one word that's contrary to this word he cuts his fellowship with God one link broke and remember your faith in this word is like a chain a chain is its strongest its weakest link that's right it's the strongest that's cuz that's all it'll hold and if there's something in the word that's puzzling to you something that you've heard different but they said thee oh that was for the apostles in them things was for days gone by when the scripture said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever don't let that be a weakness fortify it and hold it and wrap your life into it because that's the only thing that'll take you over the Flames of Hell the subtlety of Satan to try to convince us that there's certain things that were for days gone by and they're no longer in the word of God or to get us to uh to become formal or to get us to become charismatic oh how the devil would love for us to leave the protection of the word of God he said if there's something might seem to be a weakness to thee something that's seems a little different don't let it be a weakness fortified hold it strengthen it when this chain is broke with Adam and Eve the first family remember they didn't break a sentence they didn't break three words one word it's kind of what brought me back to this is how that the woman broke one word Jesus is tempted from all these different angles and then we get here in this day and we're like What hopefully Sunday we can get into more how that Christendom is what brother bam identifies it's religion it's Christianity that's become the worst Labyrinth of them all amen not just a sentence not three words one word man shall hang over Hell by every word every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God that's where man's Eternal destination is determined why he'll hang by that chain or he'll hang by a Creed or if there's a Creed mixed into the chain there is where the weak link is and you're gone there's where the weak link was with Adam and with the Eve that we link surely he said God but surely God said it and if God said it God meant it and he also keeps his word by saying the day you eat thereof that day you die the day you put into you anything else besides the unadulterated word of God in your soul that's the day that you're separated from God said now this is very strong but just listen close notice one word one word of the first of the Bible God said one word separ separated man from its eternal life chain it's where we are today now I I know that that might not uh ring true of bringing to light and better understanding the evils of our time so that we can swiftly apply the remedies you look out to the Myriad of possibilities that we could leave tonight in sin or disobey or offend or transgress in all the different ways that we might find our mind being tempted to erors of thinking and how that we might find ourselves in errors of acting and how that even after the fact we have the frustration of enjoyment man there's a million things it would seem but yet somehow it all comes back to every word I'll share this in closing in Amos chapter 8: 11-13 I'll read it I might not spend much time on it but you're familiar with it behold the days come sayi the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread Jesus in Matthew chapter 4 it could be said that there was no bread therefore he needed to come up with some means to create bread there was a an absence of bread to sustain life but here it says there will be a famine in the land not of bread nor a thirst for water so there'll be hungering and thirsting but not for bread and water but of hearing the words of the Lord and in that time of the Famine of bread and the Famine of water which is speaking of the hearing of the words of the Lord they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from North even to the East and they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it they will be in their labyrinths thinking that at the end of the day they'll find Christ at the center only to come in contact with a Minotaur who eats their flesh in that day shall their Fair virgins and young men faint for thirst those who are familiar with the Delights of Tantalus will find that he was condemned to Eternal hunger and thirst the frustra of Desire never able to quench never able to satisfy and here you see the very image in scripture not a famine for bread not a famine for water but a hunger and thirst for the word of God and they wer from sea to Sea north to East to and fro to me it's even in the reading from North even to the east is that that manner in wondering is without aim without Direction not sure which way to go to seek the word Lord but they're never able to find it comenius writes woe to him who has not extricated himself from the world's labyrinths before the end of life woe to him who in death does not know how to place aside his bundle of sins woe to him who after death senses that he's been born into the company of Tantalus that Eternal damnation that fire that is never quenched that that that Darkness and that Blackness of soul and that existence in the Life Beyond without the grace of God to carry you into Paradise woe to him who does not know how to get out of the world's labyrinths so brother brandham says quoting from commenius it's in the church book with the Bible in our hand we should cry if you brought your Bible you don't need to grab your iPhones or your blackberries but with your Bible in your hand we should cry I believe what God has revealed in this book I will obediently keep his commands I will hope for that which he has promised this is in this Unum necessarium this is in this one thing necessary brother says one thing needful I will believe the words that are revealed in this book I will keep his commands I will be obedient I will hope for that which he promised and he says Christians give ear there is only one life but death comes to us in a thousand forms there's only one Christ but a thousand Antichrist only one thing is needful I'm so glad that brother brandham didn't use the example of link and the tears of the Kingdom with the endless bosses and ESS mazes and all the things that we have to navigate in order to get to the end and save the Princess Zelda our mindset is this uh Next Level mindset right beat the boss and finally beat the final boss and you know what they do today the final boss was the final boss before the final boss and then oh guess what there's a prequel you got to go back and beat the pre-boss right and then you to come back and beat the boss that was actually behind the final boss then you find out you actually didn't kill the final boss right then as it Go unfolds you find out you are the boss you're the evil one and now all the guys you beat before trying to kill you that's the Labyrinth we're all living in and the the the solution isn't well you got to kill this Antichrist you got to kill this Antichrist you got to figure this out this lust out you got to kill this you got to find this sacred thing you got to be able to do this and we're all jumping around trying to uh bump into question marks and find magic mushrooms and all sorts of Secrets and cheat codes to get out and the word of God says no no no no no no no there are thousands of antichrist but All You Need Is Christ to defeat them there are thousands of ways to death but only one to life you don't have to defeat death in a thousand forms you just have to submit to life in its singular form the word Brothers if you'd come to your instruments Christians of ear there's only one life but death comes to us in a thousand forms there's only one Christ but a thousand Antichrist comia said it this way life is onefold and simple but there are a thousand forms of dying that remarkable life is onefold and simple but there are thousand forms of dying truth is onefold and simple but there are thousand forms of airing likewise Christ is onefold and simple but there are a thousand forms of antichrist I tell you I know why Paul said I fear lest by any means by any means Satan would beguile the body of Christ into bearing with any form of the anti an Christ when Christ is onefold and simple I say well we got to figure this out right let's get together and let's figure this out so that we can come up with a way out of this Labyrinth and then once we figured it out let's kind of protect this truth so that we can make it out and then we become elaborate to ourselves when truly the answer and I'm at peace with saying this is that you would come to know Christ personally truly know Christ personally that's your only way out of your personal Labyrinth the Labyrinth of family history The Labyrinth that this message has become and the Labyrinth that Christianity has become and the Labyrinth that this world has become whether you want to observe one as within the other everything pointing to each other the only way out is through Christ and Christ Alone the only place I could find where brother brandom talks about am maaz is when he speak he sings the song My Faith looks up to thee while life's dark maze I tread that even the songwriter recognized this Myriad of options and choices and that life itself was called a dark maze life the world christom all of it's become elaborate what is our way out Christ Christ is our way out what does the message reveal Christ it doesn't reveal brother brandom it doesn't reveal cultist behaviors and ideas it it doesn't it doesn't it's not it's not leading us into anything other than Christ if it doesn't it's not the message if it does it's the thing that we were warned against and you've made it into something that it's not life is onefold and simple thus Christ is onefold and simple the Labyrinth We're In It Can you feel it you feel the Labrinth we're trying to come up with all sorts of ways we'll just let AI get us out of it that may be the ultimate Labyrinth that's the final boss is as it has learned from all Humanity from all the all of humanity is now it is learning from it in order to move you along now as children of Eve by little and little away from what is better and away from what is true God help us thank you for your patience tonight I know this was a difficult subject to cover I welcome you to be honest in your feedback it won't scare me or at least I in saying that I'm Not Afraid afterwards I may be trembling but I share this with a loving heart believing that it's needful having peace perfect peace to deliver it knowing that God is watching out over your hearts to protect you and to keep you could we pray together if you could stand to your feet let's just bow our heads [Music] if we could with our heads bowed I I I think there's a beautiful picture that's painted in the Unum necessarium of commenius and what he's looking at he even wrote it earlier in the labyrinth in the paradise of the heart the Labyrinth of the world and the paradise of the heart wrote that in the check language in 1631 in there somewhere 1633 he takes that principle and that allegory and he uses it in Unum necessarium and that's the part that brother bram's quoting from in this later work after he's learned a lot after he's come to realize that even himself was caught up in The Labyrinth such an engaging story to use these Greek mythologies and how that they're built upon these truths and that by the word of God we could identify the error of mankind the frustrations and errors and then to come back to our duty that God has given us a word for us to [Music] contemplate and in contemplating it know to have the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and in using it in a way that brings about good works and enjoyment and how practical it is listen I would love I would love uh to have you know just that turning in all of our Lives to where the power of the word of God in this last day is working so that we just we speak to the monsoons and we we cool off the temperatures and and we're able to get more rain than dust and we just we just kind of operate in this environment that whatever we want for dinner we can just create it we're just speaking in ways that are so so profound and so extraordinary and then brother brandham says well I mean if you're going to have to have faith to change your body and you don't even have faith for a toothache I think we got a little bit of ways to go here and we might look at that and think wow what a Chasm what a divide but really it's so so Quantum it's so small because it's so simple that if I could just begin to live by that simple Faith live by that simple faith and day by day walk in that Supreme faith and just walk in it every day and learning to overcome learning from my mistakes growing learning how uh make right my wrongs whatever it might be say Lord I don't want to try to change my body tonight I just want to live right until my head hits that pillow I want to do the right things before my wife and children in these moments that I have in the morning when I Rise I I want to honor you if I make mistakes I want to make them right I I I I don't want to try to make this so complicated to where I'm reaching out beyond what is possible because truly we live in a labyrinth and with man it is impossible With God all things are possible so I want to pray for you tonight say Lord help us help us in all these labyrinths how can I get back to Eden in Satan's Eden what does it mean to live under the Covenant of the Garden of Eden what does it mean to enjoy life what does it mean to be a Christian let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord I've gone long and I've read a lot from a work that was written in Latin hundreds of years ago but Lord I believe that your Prophet reached down into that perhaps to the aid and the understanding of Lil there was a a meeting of the minds and this discussions that they undertook and some may want to write it off as brother Veil and but Lord You've at least preserved it for us he didn't stay in a dumpster and wasn't so obscured and convoluted to where we don't have our copy brother bradam referred to it it's been published it's been preserved so it's at least been preserved for us to wrestle with for us to read and to make up our minds and Lord the prophet just updated it to that time and said commenius referred to this labyrinth in his day and then we look at the day we're living in now yes yes yes the world is a labyrinth and within the world Labyrinth are these religious labyrinths educational labyrinths oh my so many and your Prophet just brought it to this simple conclusion Christ Christ is the one thing thing that is necessary man shall not live by bread alone but by every word Lord I pray that that simple uh statement and that simple truth be become practical for us that there could be this rubber meets the road this guidance of footsteps in everyday living to realize there is a way to uh take that a and to process it to where it's applicable and how that Satan is offering us meat and that there's a Temptations and there's these quandaries and these these rules and all sorts of uh complications that try to entice us away from the one thing is NE that is necessary Lord I pray that you would help us help us in our daily living to I want to overcome Lord I say this personally I want to overcome I don't want to remain the same man God help me to become better to not little by little be led away from that which is better and true but Lord may I little by little walk in the way of understanding getting further away from the congregation of the Dead entering more deeply into life Lord may I do so as a father of a daughter may I do so as a father of sons may I do so as a husband to a wife a brother to sisters and brothers what may I find a path Lord in which I'm following that course that you have laid for me the one thing needful that is my escape from this Maze of life and this Labyrinth of death I want to achieve a closer walk with you I want to overcome Lord I want to do better Lord I want my my life inwardly in my thought life outwardly in my Act of life and then back inwardly in my enjoyment of life to not be frustrated bless us I pray I ask all this for myself Lord as I pour my heart out to you I pray for this congregation I love them so dearly how you've brought so much joy to my family and I how you've changed my wife and I's lives for the better by these people I thank you Father may they be benefited by this tonight I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
