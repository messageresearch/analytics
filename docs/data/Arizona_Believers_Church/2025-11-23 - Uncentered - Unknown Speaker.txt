TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, "Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words." Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter. So he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Oh house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter, sayeth the Lord? Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, oh house of Israel. At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it, if that nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. and at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning the kingdom to build and to plant it. If it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them. Amen. You may be seated. We ready? Okay. All right. Look at this. I'm going to be able to use my right arm tomorrow. Good thing I'm left-handed. uh if we need to switch it up just let me know. Uh my title today is uncentered and in using this phrase unentered you'll be able to just immediately begin to think along the lines as we have been uh speaking on using the example of ceramics and the use of clay and the molding of clay and doing it to understand what we are in God's process how God works on us even to some extent how that we are also potters and that we have responsibility over the things that we work on and the works of our hands we use the subject of unwaxed Next, we were thinking about um pottery as an example and how something must be sincere. The Bible says be sincere and and without blame or without offense. It's sincere and smooth is the idea that was represented there and use some types with respect to pottery. Then we used uh Wednesday night unglazed. And that had something to do with looking at this the man-made coverings that we use. Uh and not only that, but also don't be man-made glazed, but have God seal you in for his purpose. Now, with uncentered, there's a lot that we could explore here. I don't want to be lengthy and but there's just a lot that we can use on this subject. Jeremiah 18:6 is God pronounced. We read this um here recently. Oh house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, oh house of Israel. So we can look at it this way that Israel was on God's will. God likens himself to a ceramicist who's working with clay from the earth and he's molding it. But the thing that is conveyed here and it's also conveyed in Isaiah. Paul picks it up in Romans is that the clay is subject to the potter's power. And so Israel being on the will is saying that you're subject to my power. I can mold you and make you. I can do with you whatever I want. That's the power that I have over the clay. So he says as uh the clay cannot respond to the potter. Uh uh and what can the clay say to the potter? So are you in my hands. And I would say we are all as believers God's clay. All of humanity is God's clay. Creation was made by God. So God has power of the clay to make it what he wants it to be. The verses that follow and proceed in verses 8 to 10, it does uh speak to the clay's response and the responsibility of the clay in that process. So God has power over the clay. What he wants it to be. Our job is to surrender to his design. that if God wants to do good, we we repent of our evil. If God is wanting to make us into something, we just simply yield to what he wants to make us. I want to um I want us to catch this image as I believe there's such a beautiful example in the art of uh making pottery to understand God and his relationship to us as vessels. In Jeremiah chapter 18, we're starting with verse one. We'll read to verse three. I want you to catch this image that God uses. The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, "Arise and go down to the potter's house." That's not TD Jake's church. This is an actual potter's house. Go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words. Then I went down to the potter's house. And behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. This isn't a DJ. This is he was writing a work on a a ceramic wheel, a pottery wheel. And at that time I was doing some reading and just trying to look at what this would uh what would an ancient pottery wheel look like and they would use a pair of circular stones and there would be one that would be fixed uh that would not be movable and then there would be another one placed on top of that. Uh you could think of even like a mill stone but this is what a potter's wheel would be. And the the the smaller stone placed upon that thick stone would be would move on an axis and sometimes with the the foot of the potter and they would cause it to turn. It wouldn't have a motor or maybe some mechanism. There's some uh physics that would go into it, but they would actually turn this wheel and that's what they come and they see. And we've used modern pottery wheels. Some of you, we have a a teacher, a doctor and a professor of clay amongst us. Brother Victor teaches uh um pottery at the Phoenix Art Institute. Did I get that right? Art Center. Phoenix Art Center. The University of Arts in Phoenix. And uh so and a lot of us have taken pottery classes with him and we've worked with clay and we've learned these different things and I things started clicking for me just as I've been studying this over the last few weeks a couple months. And so there's a in ancient times it would have been much like what we know now to be a pottery wheel is there would be a spinning wheel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And this type of pottery that God tells Jeremiah to go and witness is called throwing. And it's a process of shaping clay that's rotating on a pottery wheel. It's one of these ancient fundamental techniques of making pottery and it's physical something that requires you know touching and it's something that requires effort and it requires control and balance and you have to place the clay and then you have to pull on that clay to create a cylinder and the use of the will the reason why he's not just showing up and this guy has a lump of clay on a table. The use of the will is necessary uh to create symmetrical forms, uniform shapes. And we were looking at sacred symmetry earlier this year when God led us to deal with holiness and God's requirement in the scripture of how one ought to dress. And we saw very plainly what the Bible has to say about how a woman dresses and how a man dresses and how there's this sacred symmetry. There's something that God wants sees a beauty in the woman, sees a beauty in the man, and it needs to be expressed in that way. and any kind of human glaze or cover up to that changes God's image. We looked at how symmetry speaks of that uh that harmonious arrangement where there's this balanced proportion, this beautiful form, the golden ratio or the the the divine proportion. Those things are things that are in the scripture. And so for the symmetry of the vessel that's being created, it depends on that clay being uniformly shaped, &gt;&gt; proportionally influenced. It's like if there's kind of one of those things if you even apply it to cooking and say, "Well, I just want to cook this over high heat and and how long does it take to cook?" Well, if you only cook on one side, then you may not get that unless you really want to ruin your steak. I guess you could just cook it for an hour on one side and it's going to be uh it's not really well done. It's kind of the wrong phrase to use for a steak that's cooked to 180 degrees internal temp. That's done bad. How would you like your steak? I want it badly done. Okay, sure enough, no red there. But there's a wait, if you don't flip it, then you're not it's not going to be cooked evenly. There's something about that uh uniform influence, proportional influence where it's being shaped uh the same pressure from every side, not just from one side. So, this is what God is wanting him to see. Is he wanting him to see a potter that's working on a wheel? And in verse 14, and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter. So I love how it's just still he witnesses that in the hand of the potter the clay is marred. So he made it again another vessel seemed good to the potter to make it. Looking at this word marred and even what some of the uh and the septuagent says and some of the traditional uh interpretations of this even to the Jews and but they they a lot of them say it fell. It may have fallen on the wheel or fallen onto a beam or something where it fell off this this uh the wheels and we could say that it fell or in otherwise in some way got out of the shape that the potter was intending and I want to I want to suggest this because to me this is how it really struck me. I felt the Lord had led me to this. It had possibly become unentered &gt;&gt; as a potter is working with this clay and it falls and something happens to it. He he it says that he had to make it again another vessel as it seemed good in the potter's sight. I said this vessel of clay that was being made on the wheels was marred. It's for somehow it was got out of shape. And if when I say it was unentered let me just give some uh there's a lot of background we could give to this. A lot of maybe just the academic uh aspect of this but centering is probably the most fundamental pottery skill. When I was taking classes, uh, pottery classes, that was the thing you did is you centered, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's all you did. That's what you did initially. You didn't have to go get clay, make clay. You didn't have to wedge clay. There wasn't a lot of work that I was doing uh when I was just doing it uh with my family. But we were there is that's the one thing you learn to do because you if you don't know how to center, if the clay's not centered, then you're not going to have success with what you're molding. Centering determines the success or the marring of that vessel. Determines whether or not there's disappointment or frustration or happiness because the centering of the clay on the wheel. As the potter came as the prophet came to the potter and saw the clay on the wheels and the potter working with the clay. Centering brings balance to the work, stability. And in order to work on that clay, it requires control in order to have symmetry. And so when centered, the potter's hands will evenly apply pressure. And and you're not having to push on this side and then go to this say, "Well, how much do I push here? And how how can I get this to work?" But it just by applying this pressure, it it allows it to be done smoothly and consistently. And when centered, it's easier for that for that potter to begin to pull that clay upwards a and to refine its shape and make it to what he wants it to be. So it's the centering that guarantees the symmetry. It's the centering that guarantees the balance that it'll be even and proportional. They call it rotational symmetry. But if the clay is uncentered, you're not going to be able to accomplish that. or if you tried to accomplish it. The phrase that I came across among ceramicists is that if it's not centered, it's called wrestling, not throwing &gt;&gt; because you're having to fight against the clay because it it's not even. It's it's moving this way. It's moving just a little bit out and just the slightest uncentering. YOU'RE REALLY HAVING TO FIGHT WITH IT YET. IT'S NOT THROWING AT THAT POINT. It's wrestling with it. &gt;&gt; And so when a clay is uncentered, it'll wobble. And as it shakes or wobbles, uh, then it and it spins, it's nearly impossible to form those straight lines and and the walls are even the appropriate shapes. Not only that, you get these un this uneven thickness where it's thicker on one side, thinner on the other. That's how cracks will form and and dry when it's drying and firing. When it's not centered, it's un it's more difficult to control. It's almost uncontrollable. Now, I know you're thinking, "Well, we showed up for church and we're getting clay classes." No, that's not it. We're not going to break out into the fellowship hall a and start working on clay. Think of how this spiritual principle of being centered. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when maybe if if it's our own children, they seem to be a little bit out of control and they're things are uneven and things are out of balance. It's because there's you haven't come back to center. There's got to be a baseline. There's got to be something that you say, "We're grounded and we're rooted in this." And that's what's going to bring the stability. When it's not centered, your hands are constantly fighting the clay's uneven motion. That's what increases frustration. That's what gives rise to mistakes. If it's not centered, there'll be structural weakness with the clay because it produces these unstable forms that warp and it'll collapse. It breaks more easily. It's how you get lopsided clay. where it's distorted, it's out of shape, which undermines the very reason why you're using the wheel to begin with. If you didn't mind if it was lopsided, if you didn't mind if it was even, if you didn't mind about the structural integrity, if it didn't need to be beautiful and proportional, then just do some hand building. Get it close enough. &gt;&gt; It'll hold water. But the point to using the will is so that things can be balanced. &gt;&gt; It can be the best that it can be. That's the that's the reason for using it. And so if it's not centered, the very process is undermined. So in the centering process, there's a there's a a wedging that takes place. We're in forming that clay. You're you're removing the air. You're aligning the particles. I didn't get into the science of that. I thought maybe that might have been a little hippie talk. I'm not sure. But um and then you put in a shape, a smooth ball, and then you're going to place it on the wheel. and you attach it to the wheel. You I think you you just kind of slam it down there. You plop it on there as the wheel spins and or you before the wheel spins and you press it down on that bat or the wheel head so it sticks and now you've got your clay in that beginning stages. And it wasn't until recently I almost feel like I need to apologize to my professor because it he's like we do this every time. And this is all we're doing is we're just putting it on the wheel and we're spinning it and we're bracing ourselves. We want to get firm control over the clay. We want to have the right kind of posture. And then what you would do and how many don't cringe husbands if you were dragged to a pottery class. Uh uh it it but you coned, right? There's certain kind of cones we like. You might find them at a salt and straw or something. But this kind of coning, that's all you were doing is coning. And I remember to me I was thinking what? Why? Why are we just going up and down and up and down and up and down? The coning was part of centering. There's no there's no point to trying to make a mug or a cup or a bass boat on the wheel. Uh you can't do that. Uh but I imagined it. But there's no way to make those things unless it's centered. Right. &gt;&gt; And so that final centering ONCE YOU'VE GOTTEN ON THERE AND this coning of pulling up and down, you apply this downward pressure with the top hand, this inward pressure with the side, and you're making sure your lump that's going to make this vessel is finally centered. &gt;&gt; You're not going to do anything else. You don't JUST GET ON IT IN FIVE MINUTES, YOU'VE got a coffee mug. There's this process of making sure this clay is perfectly centered, right? And once properly centered, if clay is properly centered, this is the part where I want to quickly transition into the spiritual application. If the clay is perfectly improperly centered, the wheel could be spinning as fast as it can possibly spin and the clay will look as if it's standing still. &gt;&gt; I want you to think of that. That no matter how much everything is spinning around, if centered, the clay appears as if it's standing still. That's right. &gt;&gt; In 2 Corinthians 4 7 to10, we looked through these first seven verses already recently, but we have this treasure in earth and vessels. Go back to chapter 3. He's talking about us being vessels of clay. We have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. So, we have God's power inside of us. We are vessels of clay. We are made to honor. And then once he has established in chapter 3 and and us being these vessels of light and there's a lot that he's amplifying through this once he's established this and we see ourselves as this clay that has this great treasure on the inside of us. He says we're troubled on every side yet not distressed. We are perplexed but not in despair. We are persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed. Think of this lump of clay on the wheel and maybe it's pressed and it's pulled and it's misshapen AND IT'S GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WE COULD SAY WE'RE TROUBLED ON EVERY SIDE yet not distressed. We are perplexed. We are persecuted. We're cast down but not distressed. Despared. WE'RE NOT DESTROYED OR FORSAKEN. EVERYTHING AROUND US IS SPINNING, BUT WE'RE JUST STAYING SILENTLY CENTERED, seemingly unmovable, &gt;&gt; cuz we're always bearing about in the body, the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. If I could say it this way, when we're unentered or when we feel as if we're unentered, if we're unsure and we have this uh the the clay literally does not have its own mind, even though it may feel like it sometimes, and what you're wanting is just cooperate, please. We We have this human element to where if we're not properly centered or IF WE JUST FEEL UNCENTERED, &gt;&gt; this is why we This is when we experience despair. We could say for a fact that we're troubled. We're perplexed. We're we're uh we're persecuted. But we should not be distressed. We should not be in despair. We should not feel forsaken or destroyed. &gt;&gt; When we experience those things, it's because we're not centered. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm experiencing I'M EXPERIENCING TROUBLE." OKAY, that's that'll happen when you're centered. I I'M EXPERIENCING PERPLEXION. YEAH, IT'S YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPINNING AROUND. I'm persecuted. But it's when you're not centered that you begin to experience these other disappointments. &gt;&gt; In the sermon, Victory Day, Brother Brandham said, "It seems like the Christian life, if the fellow's not absolutely centered on Christ, the Christian life seems like it holds so many disappointments." Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm going to use a number of statements of brother Brandham because I want you to recognize that in the message what his themes were, what his emphasis was. Now, he's constantly bringing us back to Christ. IF YOU'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY CENTERED ON CHRIST, A Christian life seems to hold so many disappointments. And we said, yes, that's true that my I I experience A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS, BUT EVEN THOSE disappointments are we have to put them and view them in the proper light. HE SAYS, "BUT THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS ARE GOD'S DIVINE will happening for us." &gt;&gt; It don't seem like it would be that, BUT IT'S GOD'S WAY OF DOING THINGS. He lets us hit the river to see what we'll do. God will let you come to a place where it looks like you HAVE NO WAY ACROSS JUST SO THAT HE CAN SEE WHAT YOUR RESPONSE will be. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And so even in those disappointments, even with those times of distress and despair, God will use it because he uses all things to work together for your good, &gt;&gt; for your shaping, for your benefit, for your perfection. But if we're not absolutely centered on Christ, life holds so many disappointments. &gt;&gt; I would go on to say this that those things that what the event that would cause a disappointment. So let's just say circumstance and then our response to the circumstance is disappointment. And so the the circumstance may be unavo unavoidable. And so if you're not ab when you're absolutely centered on Christ, you may still go through the circumstance. But when you're not centered, that that circumstance causes the disappointment. &gt;&gt; So just because you're centered doesn't mean you're not going to feel pressure. Doesn't mean you're not going to feel a shaping, a pulling up and down, a mashing, and all those things that takes place when God is allowing a vessel to be formed. But it's being unentered that brings the disappointments, the wrong kind of internal response. In Matthew chap 22 34 to 40, want to focus now on this idea of being absolutely centered. But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. And you now you'd think that if your rival got shut out that you'd be like, [laughter] "You're the the enemy of your enemy, your friend." But they hated Christ so much that they were disappointed to see the Sadducees sad, you see. And so he says, "Then one of them which was a lawyer, oh my, asked him a question, tempting him and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law?" Jesus said unto him, my friend and brother-in-law, Brother Jonathan, said, "It took him two decades to figure this out, but not only am I his brother-in-law, but I'm his brother-in-law." I thought, well, that's true for for you, too. Your friend-in-law, too. But he says, 'What's the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." This is the first and great commandment. The first and great commandment is about centering on God. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all heart, soul, and mind. This is if you want to look at in the sense of h the different meanings that could be implied by the use of heart, soul, and mind. You're saying that the entire person is now centered on God on his will. &gt;&gt; The first and great commandment is to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. This is a centering soul and mind. This is the first and great commandment. The first and greatest commandment is a measurement of whatever what our lives are centered on. &gt;&gt; What what what must I come back to? What's the center? Loving the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul, and mind. And the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. That this is the center. This is what everything hangs on. This is the stabilizer. This is the balancing force. These two commandments are on all hang on all the law and the prophets. WHAT DO ALL THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS point to? Jesus Christ. What is it revealing? The nature of God. &gt;&gt; So this this two commandments are so outstanding. Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul, and mind and thy neighbor as thyself. This is centering the believer. This is what matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. In John 14 19 to 21, yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but ye see me. Because I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we were to try to draw a vin diagram of that, I think it would be nearly impossible. This is, you know, I can't remember what they're called, but those Russian dolls where you open one up and the side is another one. You open another one, inside is another one, and open. and and we know which was inside which this is saying at that day you shall know that I am in the father and you are in me and and you're thinking oh let's unpack these Russian dolls and then he says and I in you and at that point you're like wait a minute the big guy can't fit in the little guy but this is what he's expressing at that day you will know that I am in you and you are in me he that hath my commandments and keepeth him he is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him. What beautiful promises &gt;&gt; when he says at that day you'll know that you are in me. The believer is uh you are in me. The believer is centered in Christ. &gt;&gt; You are in me. We're centered on Christ. This is the centering of the believer. But then he says and I in you. This is Christ being centered in the believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just recognize kind of that that that symmetry to it that our faith and we must be centered in Christ. So we have this PERSPECTIVE THAT I AM CENTERED IN CHRIST BY ONE SPIRIT. I'VE BEEN BAPTIZED INTO THE BODY of Christ. I'M IN THE heart of God. I'm I was I'm in the mind OF CHRIST. BUT THEN NOT JUST THIS VIEW to me being in him, but now he must be centered in me. &gt;&gt; That I must have the mind of Christ. THAT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WHERE IN CHRIST IS HAVING COMPLETE control and preeminence in me. Brother Bradom said Christ is the center of our worship, the center of our attraction, the center of our life and all that we have, want and are and will be is based upon him. &gt;&gt; Now that's centering. That's loving the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul, and mind. When he is the center of our worship, the center of our attraction, the center of our life, and then all we have, want, are, and will be is based on him. THIS IS THE RIGHT KIND OF CENTERING. In the day and age that we live in now where lives are so fragmented and we have so many different pursuits and ambitions and hobbies and so many different ways that our attentions can be fragmented, WE MUST BE COMING BACK to this solid foundation where I know I'm on the wheel. I'm on his back. I'm placed positionally in this in his word to know that this is what matters the most. &gt;&gt; This is what I'm centered on. Amen. &gt;&gt; We all we we all have different callings in our lives. We have different experiences. We have different past. We have uh places that God will call us to live, jobs he'll call us to do. Uh there may be something God will ask you to do and in obeying it and you do it. A lot of people may not understand why you're doing it. might why you're doing it. There might be a lot of things that we have these uh strict constructs of how things need to be and this is what it should how it should feel and this is how it should look and when it doesn't happen that way we're real quick to judge. But the most important thing is for the clay itself to know I'm centered in God's will &gt;&gt; with the confidence of knowing that if I if I have gotten a little bit off center and I begin to wobble and things get a little bit misshapen and I pursued something I shouldn't that God has a way of getting us back into the center of his will. &gt;&gt; That life down there is just driving me crazy. You spend a whole afternoon making sure everything's just perfectly centered and then you get life. You start thinking about cereal and you get hungry. Notice he said that thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. That is the first and greatest commandment. And he says, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." It's uh maybe I should have asked you this, Brother Victor. He was my consultant. But I looked at this as a like a chuck to keep the clay centered. Some call it a lug. I might argue as a amateur ceramicist myself that maybe the proper term is a chuck. But you're going to use a piece of clay to keep it centered when you're maybe in the trimming process. You you're going to kind of harness it a little bit. You're going to keep it uh stable. When he says, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." This is we have we're centered. I love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul, and all thy mind. But now, there's something that keeps us that's going to make sure you're centered. &gt;&gt; Love your neighbor as yourself. &gt;&gt; Because if your heart's not completely centered on Christ, you're not going to love your neighbor as yourself. &gt;&gt; And this is the good part. If your heart is not absolutely centered on Christ, you ain't going to be loving yourself correctly. &gt;&gt; And therefore, you can't love your neighbor correctly. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If I could put it this way, being self-centered keeps us uncentered to Christ. &gt;&gt; Being self-centered is is a red flag that I'm not centered. If I could put it this way, in the concept of the wheel, the world does not revolve around you. &gt;&gt; May feel like it, but it doesn't. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 3:7, we used this recently. We use Genesis quite a bit here. And the eyes of them both were opened. The man and the woman at the time of the fall after Satan had convinced them. He used glazed over death. Says, "And they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. Everything is centered around them. Their eyes were open. They knew. They sewed. They made themselves aprons." The shame that came with the sense of self-awareness provoked this self-p protection. &gt;&gt; I want to protect myself. I think the way we described it earlier this year is Eden shifted from being God- centered. It was centered around his word. These were his commandments. Be fruitful, multiply, replenish the earth, uh subdue it, have dominion over it. This was a god centered a a a word centered Eden. And but now it become self-centered, &gt;&gt; right? And once it becomes self-centered, his his eyes are open. He knows he's naked. HE MAKES APRONS FOR HIMSELF. AND WHAT DOES ADAM DO? SELFISHLY RUNS AWAY FROM GOD. And this is what happens when we don't love the Lord thy God with all your heart, soul, and mind. Things shift to becoming more self-centered. What does this mean for me? How does this impact me? And you're not loving your neighbor as yourself. You don't have the heart of God that looks looks outward. The phrase that we would use maybe today is a narcissist which is it's it's a modern phrase but it comes from Greek mythology but it's a psych psychological a term in psychology to describe this preoccupation with self &gt;&gt; and I know there's a lot that we're looking at in the word of God and we say well in the word of God what we're trying to do is we want God to work on us and I want to see I want to center myself on Christ I want Christ to be centered in me and there may seem to be a lot of eye that goes into this and there's a lot of uh you a lot of maybe selfexamination and thoughts about ourselves and I I I want to work out my own salvation. I want God to perfect me. But it does it's not to cause us to become very insular and selfish and self-centered. in Greek mythology, uh, narcissist, he was he constantly, if I I'm just trying to remember that he so preoccupied with his own image, looking at himself in a mirror and so preoccupied with seeing his what he thought to be his beauty that it ended up being his ruin because he couldn't get him he couldn't stop from looking. And so it SAYS WE ALL WITH OPEN FACE BEHOLDING as a the Lord the glory of the Lord as in a glass or changing the same image. If you're looking into the carnal mirror &gt;&gt; and you're seeing your worldly reflection and you're like mirror mirror on the wall &gt;&gt; who is the freshest of them all. Right? You're like that then you're a man who is beholding himself in the glass and forgets what kind of sinner he was. &gt;&gt; So there's the wrong kind of mirror. There's the mirror of narcissists where you're seeing yourself. Oh, I'm such a good person. You're good. You're going to make it. I think that's the incredible part about, you know, front-facing cameras and this selfie generation is you're beholding yourself. &gt;&gt; And and and what's THE WORLD'S RESPONSE TO A SELFIE? WE NEED FILTERS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WE NEED A WAY TO CHANGE THIS. AND SO THERE'S A PREOCCUPATION WITH self which that's your only perspective is self-centered. How does this affect me? What does that call? Selfishness, vanity, pride. &gt;&gt; It says you should love the Lord thy God with all your heart, soul, and mind. But now this chuck, this this lug, this thing that's now making sure you're staying center on the wheel is love thy neighbor as thyself. In the sermon, does God ever change his mind about his word? Brother says, "God's little group is his bride centered on that word." May the dear heavenly father ever keep you stabilized right there. Don't you ever move from that word. &gt;&gt; It's a stabilizing force. Ezekiel 1:16 as this prophet sees this appearance of the wheels and their work was like under the color of a burl and they had four and they for had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a will in the middle of a will. &gt;&gt; It's an image of Christ. &gt;&gt; Christ is the will in the middle of the will. Christ stabilizes every move. &gt;&gt; But you've got to let him. &gt;&gt; You've got to be CENTERED ON CHRIST. HE MUST BE CENTERED in you. AND IT'LL STABILIZE EVERY MOTION you make. If you get a LITTLE BIT OFF CENTER, you're going to wobble. You're going to get uneven. You're going to get disproportionate. Gonna get out of balance. When an individual's not completely and totally centered ON CHRIST, LIFE HOLDS SO MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS. WHAT DO DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSE? DOUBT, CONFUSION, WORRY, CHAOS. &gt;&gt; You've got to be centered. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. 2 Timothy chapter 1:7, "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love, and of a sound mind." &gt;&gt; A sound mind is that moderation or self-control. It speaks of a soberness to restore one to his senses. &gt;&gt; Things are clear. And fear puts you in a disjointed state of mind. &gt;&gt; Fear, you're you're off center. &gt;&gt; May even call it unhinged. it. Fear intoxicates us. It puts us under the wrong kind of influence. It impairs our our thinking because we're now if you're perfectly centered on God's word, then that produces faith. &gt;&gt; When you get a little bit off-centered, it produces doubt, which gives rise to fear. &gt;&gt; What was it that man did in Genesis 3:10? Whenever he sinned, I heard the voice, thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself. &gt;&gt; Fear is born from being unentered. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When we find ourselves anxious, when we find ourselves fearful, then then what we can do is we can begin to think, "Wow, uh why why am I fearful?" Well, I I know that can be very difficult to diagnose sometimes. I I I know what it's like to experience fear and anxiety and melancholy and depression, and you're still you're trying TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IN THE WORLD IS MAKING ME FEEL SO ANXIOUS. And and you want to find some identifiable, YOU KNOW, OH, IT'S BECAUSE SOMEBODY FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST ME FOR $1 BILLION. THAT'S WHY I'M ANXIOUS. NO, NO SUCH LAWSUIT EXISTS. OH, IT'S BECAUSE THAT YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING. AND WHAT YOU REALIZE IS YOU'VE ALLOWED YOURSELF TO GET A LITTLE BIT LEFT OF CENTER, JUST YOUR EMOTIONS. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD MAY CALL IT A HORMONAL IMBALANCE. It's you just need to take some medicine to GET EVERYTHING LINED BACK UP CHEMICALLY. AND THAT'S EXACTLY YOU GOT TO GET THINGS CENTERED BACK AGAIN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I know with all this talk of centering, you're going to expect me to pass out, you know, copper line shoe inserts and we're going to do yoga later. But this is a different kind of centering that I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Fear comes from a heart that's not perfectly centered &gt;&gt; or a mind that doesn't think it is. &gt;&gt; Because born again believers, your soul is sealed and centered. It's been glazed. It's impervious to to sin and doubt and unbelief. But it's when our minds and our spirits get agitated a and we begin to think, "Oh no, I'm not centered." What do we have to come back to? That which is certain. &gt;&gt; In the sermon, the voice of God in the last days, Brother says, "One reason the church is in condition that it's in is because there's so many voices." &gt;&gt; In 1963, Tucson Tabernacle this weekend is celebrating their 60th anniversary and they did a remodel. They're doing a church dedication. And so our our prayers are with them to this weekend. Think of how long it's been. &gt;&gt; The condition of the world in the 60s, the condition of the church in the 60s. And the condition is because the voices and now all those voices are amplified by everybody who has a Twitter account. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, X account. I read here recently that Malcolm X changed his name to Malcolm Twitter just to keep everything balanced out. But there's so MANY VOICES AND NOW THOSE VOICES, we have voices about the voices, &gt;&gt; right? Somebody, some news event is happening and Nancy in Tennessee wants to tweet. Well, this is what I think about Sleepy Joe, right? We got all THESE COMMENTARY ON COMMENTARY. HOW MANY OF YOU don't read the article, you read the comments? [laughter] I think America's greatness is the comment section. THERE'S SO MANY VOICES, SO MANY OTHER VOICES TO ATTRACT THE CHURCH FROM THE VOICE OF GOD TILL IT'S VERY DOUBTFUL THAT MANY WOULD HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD, THOUGH IT SPOKE RIGHT IN THEIR MIDST. IF THERE'S EVER BEEN A time that this IS MORE IMPERFECT BUT PERFECTLY TRUE IS RIGHT NOW THERE'S SO many voices. The voice of God is just another opinion in the voice of so many voices &gt;&gt; because now you can raise up a voice in opposition against the voice. Now you can have a platform that its sole purpose is to exist to attack Christ. &gt;&gt; He says they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because it would be a foreign thing to them. They got themselves so much centered on the voices of the day. Yes, &gt;&gt; if you think about it, our lives revolve around certain habits. And our tendencies with our cell phones and our tablets and our smart devices are centered around voices of the world, &gt;&gt; their opinions, their input, their actions, their promotions, their influence. It's centered on those voices. And we've heard and seen and felt so much in our soul and our heart and our mind all these things bombarding it that we can't be centered because these voices just have a gravitational pull and influence. I've been studying on a uh for some I've been asked to speak at a youth camp next year and so I've been studying on one thing that I think is very critical to our young people is the algorithm, &gt;&gt; right? And in this one book that I came across, we it turns this turns it upside down because we think, "Oh, the algorithm knows us." Yes. But that's not the bad part. &gt;&gt; The algor algorithm got to know you so it could change you. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that amazing? It knows I'm looking for a Navajo print cardigan. It knows me. But what it wants TO DO IS START WITH THAT, RIGHT? CREATE some sort of trust. Brother Algo just knows me, right? Knows me so well. AND THEN WITH THAT TRUST, it can shape you, can form you, can lead you where it wants you to go. &gt;&gt; And we have so many voices that just ever so slightly cause us to lean a bit little bit. If I could say it this way, Satan's long-term battle plan is to cause us to leave God's word. &gt;&gt; Cause us to remove Christ, the word, from being the center of OUR LIVES. WELL, HOW IS HE EVER GOING TO GET CHRIST A OUT? HOW IS HE EVER GOING TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE CHURCH? HE DOESN'T START BY SHOWING UP AND SAYING, "YOU SHOULD EVICT CHRIST." JUST LITTLE BY little moves them out of certain places. &gt;&gt; Moves them out. Moves them out. Just leave. Just ever so slightly lean away from your first love. And before you know it, Christ is completely kicked out of the church in Revelations 3. &gt;&gt; He's on the outside and say, "Well, how did that ever happen?" Voices. &gt;&gt; We got centered on the wrong voices. &gt;&gt; Too much time was given to these other voices. And Christ gets nudged out. And Christ gets nudged out. Christ gets nudged out. And then all of a sudden, trouble hits your home. Like, "What happened? What happened? What happened? &gt;&gt; You got unentered." &gt;&gt; But a sound mind is centered on Christ. A mind that is centered on Christ acts according to wisdom. It acts in moderation. The thought that brought me to these very scriptures was the balance &gt;&gt; that when when the clay is centered on the will, there's not these extreme motions that the the force of that spinning is balanced out proportionally. But if it gets uncentered, the force will cause it to to jerk to move. If you've ever seen something spinning and it gets just a little bit off, you you notice right away it creates that uneven motion. Sound mind is trusting. It has faith. But then it says a sound mind. Notice this balancing here. Giving us a spirit of power and of a sound mind. I want to take those two things. It's power and a sound mind. Power it chases away fear and the power. So, we have power and we might think that's really dynamic that that's the part that we see. But then you have a sound mind. Power and a sound mind. But then notice it's not just power and a sound mind. Love is right in the middle. &gt;&gt; Love is that balancing factor between extremes. &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT A SOUND MIND. OKAY. WELL, I'VE GOT POWER. I'D RATHER HAVE POWER THAN A SOUND MIND. SO, I'D RATHER have a sound mind than power. And he said, 'Well, now now we got powers fighting against a sound mind. Which side are you? Huh? &gt;&gt; Which team are you? I'm team power, right? I said, you know, I'm team sound mind, right? And we have all these teams that we're on. No, there's no team because when you have love, it's what it's what brings it together. &gt;&gt; It balances it together. If you don't have love, love the Lord thy God with all the heart, soul, and mind. There's a way to break that down. Even if though the the Greek words may not match up, but if you have the love of God in your soul, it's going to balance out the mind and the power. It's going to balance out the the the mind and the heart. It's going to take that and it's going to say, "Now with the word of God in my heart, I can stay balanced. I don't need to create sides because I'm centered. I'm centered on Christ." So the love keeps us balanced. When you're centered, you're balanced. In Hosea 7:es 8 and N we were preaching on mixed media said Ephraim he hath mixed himself among the people. You're going to great lengths are just showing the power of these things being mixed together and the damaging effect. Ephraim is a cake not turned. What did that mean? It's literally like a pancake on the griddle that's only being cooked on one side. It It's an egg that's only fried on one side. It's a steak that's only cooked on one side. He's saying it's not even. It's a cake not turned. Not only did it become burned and inedible, but it it's not balanced. IT'S ONLY IT'S PRONE TO EXTREMES. SO, it strength has been devoured. Strangers have devoured his strength and he knoweth it not. The mixing that is the imitation, the joining with other nations is how we used it. But there's this imbalance that comes. So if our hearts ARE NOT COMPLETELY CENTERED ON CHRIST, WE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FORCES, RIGHT? Is that is EPHESIANS TALKING ABOUT TOSSED TO AND FRO? &gt;&gt; If you're IF YOU'RE CENTERED, LISTEN, GOD ALLOWS THINGS TO COME. GOD ALLOWS WAVES. GOD ALLOWS PRESSURES. If you're centered on Christ, then that pressure is going to cause you to become more even. Going to be stable. You're going to be able to weather it, right? Because you're going to you're GOING TO BE SPINNING AROUND BECAUSE THE PRESSURE. BUT WHAT HAPPENS? It's applied evenly and it looks as if you're not even moving because you stand therefore. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But if you get A LITTLE BIT UNCENTERED, WHAT HAPPENS? IT THAT spinning is going to cause you to move move and the the force in the weight of that &gt;&gt; cause you to shift and that's when the vessel is marred. &gt;&gt; So we got we have to stay balanced because then the pressures come. I've experienced this myself. This is just a little bit of uh uh pulling back the curtain on my for myself that there's a lot of things that happen in life for me personally that something happens and you feel it's some extreme or it's some air and it's some lie and if you are just responding to the extreme &gt;&gt; in order to balance the extreme out you've got to go to the other extreme &gt;&gt; and you you yourself you've tried to bring some sort of balance. So, you had to go you had to leave the middle and go into the other SIDE TO TRY TO GET them in the middle. Well, if you're successful, they're going to look at you like, "Well, why are you so extreme, brother Aaron?" LIKE, "WELL, I WAS ONLY extreme because you're extreme. &gt;&gt; I only got here because of where you were. CAN YOU HELP ME OUT OF THIS DITCH?" &gt;&gt; And so, then they go to help you out of the ditch and they just pull you out of that ditch right into another one. And so there's something about being centered that when things happen, if you're centered, you can say, "Well, I know that's not right." But this is this is the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to pull from the other side, &gt;&gt; the other extreme to mix and blend the extremes to come up with some sort of harmony. You say, "No, I see where Christ is in his word. I don't need to be extreme &gt;&gt; and I don't need to go to the other extreme &gt;&gt; to be balanced, &gt;&gt; which is I think what we're going to be doing over the next several months is we're going to have a fire in the fireplace and the doors open, right? All the doors and windows open so we can just create the perfect room temperature. And God hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same. He said, "There's one side that's highly intellectual, cold, and indifferent. They deny everything there, and the other's got the other side, and the other side's a radical bunch of emotion and deny the word." And in reality, you know what made them that way? Polarization. &gt;&gt; What made them that way is like, "Well, I believe this way. Well, I believe this way. Well, I think you're wrong." &gt;&gt; Right? And all it does is it creates these A POLARIZATION THAT THE RESPONSE and the AND THE SIDES GET FURTHER and further APART AS A RESPONSE TO the other extreme. &gt;&gt; But he says, "But the real true church stays right in the middle of the road." &gt;&gt; The true believer is centered on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Therefore, it's the true believer that's taking shots from both sides. &gt;&gt; These people get in their trench on one side, the other people get in their trench on the other, and they're taking shots at each other. But who's taking all the bullets? &gt;&gt; The believer that stands right in the middle. &gt;&gt; Because you're not an you're not extreme. &gt;&gt; Those who are in the perfect liberty of Christ. Because where the spirit of the Lord, there's liberty to become like Christ. But if you don't buy into the fact that where there's liberty, there's emotionalism and there's fanaticism and there's a wildfire and that's the way you ought to be, right? Then and but you're right in the middle with the word of God, they're going to look at you as being cold, formal, and intellectual. Right? &gt;&gt; Because to those who are in the extremes, the person in the middle is extreme. &gt;&gt; Daniel chapter 5 verse 27 it says, "Thou art weighed in the balances and found art found wanting." That would make a good art title. Art found wanting judged by the word and found to be deficient &gt;&gt; or lacking. weighed in the balance. So, how is it that you find how do you find balance? There's a one weight on one side, a weight on the other, and it becomes it's centered. It's balanced. It's stabilized. And the more the church has shifted from Christ being the center, the more it's I can't remember if it was this year. I think it was this year we talked about how the more that we shifted away from Christ being the center of the church, it's become more social centered &gt;&gt; where things were all revolve around relationships with each other and it re it got there because we centered more on the emotionalism or the intellectualism. &gt;&gt; You center on the mind, the person, it becomes more self-centered. It becomes the individual improvement. It becomes more how to win friends and influence people. And it becomes more psychology. And it becomes more emotionalism or Pentecostalism. And that's how Christ gets kicked out of the church. And when you shift away from a Christ centered church, it becomes and you shift you focus more on the mind. That's how you get social centered churches. &gt;&gt; But Christ, brother said, go Christ is God's center spot of worship. Christ is &gt;&gt; brother Bram said there's more to this ministry than divine healing AND SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S MORE TO THIS MINISTRY THAN DIVINE HEALING THERE'S TONGUES AND THERE'S SHOUTING THERE'S DANCING THERE'S EMOTION THERE'S POWER THERE'S TEACHING AND TRY TO TRY TO BRING THE BALANCE BY BRINGING EVERYTHING IN NO IT'S Christ &gt;&gt; listen WELL THERE'S EMOTION AND THERE'S NOT EMOTION NO THAT TO TO SOME POINT YOU'RE CREATING UNNECESSARY PARADOXES THERE'S CHRIST &gt;&gt; IN CHRIST ALONE &gt;&gt; LET him be in THE PERSON WHAT HE WANTS TO BE. LET HIM MOLD. IF THERE'S A PERSON WHO'S PRONE TO FANATICISM, A PERSON WHO'S REALLY EMOTIONAL AND A PERSON WHO'S REALLY REALLY EXPRESSIVE AND ALWAYS GIVES THEMSELVES OVER TO SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL WORKUP, IF CHRIST WANTS TO WORK IN THEM TO MAKE THEM MORE SOBER and clear-minded, let him do it. IF THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S STARCHY AND COLD AND FORMAL AND THEY'VE NEVER HAD A CRY IN THEIR LIFE AND NEVER HAD A SHOUT AND GOD WANTS THEM TO EXPERIENCE MORE EMOTION SO THEY CAN HAVE DEEPER EMPATHY, THEN LET GOD DO THAT IN THEM. LET CHRIST BEING THE PERSON WHAT THE POTTER WANTS THEM TO BE. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because in the sermon absolute man, for those of you who are grammatically pettent, a absolute is a title that'll really get you. If in your life you have an absolute, you do things ordinarily you would not do, especially if you have a God centered life. The God- centered life makes a person do things that ordinarily they would not do. So he's repeating that very odd, peculiar. Why is a Christian life so odd and peculiar? It's because they're looking to God's word which is almost foreign to the world today. &gt;&gt; That's why you're odd. That's why you're peculiar. You're centered on something else. &gt;&gt; There's so much in this in terms of the pottery process, but then there's so many other experiences that you can have in terms of vantage point and the way things move and the and the physics and science and all and aliens. There's all these different things that you can look at and say, "Wow, there's so many different ways to see this principle that when somebody is centered on something, to those who don't have the same point of reference to those who AREN'T CENTERED, IT IT OPERATES COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY. &gt;&gt; They're looking to God's word. You're looking to God's word." And be having a God- centered life makes you peculiar and odd. There's your excuse. There's your out spiritual diversity. It's a superpower. Ephesians chapter 3 14 to1 19. For this cause I bow my knees. We're coming to our closing thoughts here. Uh well, we're making good time so maybe I can venture into some other areas. But for this cause I bow my knees unto the Lord uh the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole fam family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man. This is the prayer. This is what I want day by day that God would grant that I would be strengthened with might with power by his spirit in the inner man. So the inner man being Christ the word that that that's inner person of me this man within the man Christ in me the hope of glory his spirit being in me would strengthen me &gt;&gt; strengthen me &gt;&gt; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith I want to use that to say this is Christ being centered in our hearts that ye being rooted and grounded in love now we're centered in Christ charity Christ the capstone he's now centered himself Christ may dwell in our hearts our faith must be centered on the word and the word must be the center of our faith Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love I think that's just come comes back to being grounded that there's there's something even you know there's a lot of of theory on a person's connection to the earth and being grounded grounded and walking in grass and I hope rocks work just as well for those of us Phoenicians that walking on gravel and quarter minus and dust is part of grounding but there's something about this centering this grounding we may dwell in your hearts by faith being rooted in ground love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth the length the depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God &gt;&gt; when you are centered centered on the word and the word is centered in you. It's access to fullness. &gt;&gt; If you get a little bit off-centered, there's going to be something in the way. Something misshapen, something uh uh not quite working right. And the sermon Jehovah Gyra part one, when the Holy Spirit came upon that vine, it produced from its vine to the first branch. They wrote a book of Acts behind it. This is the inauguration of the Christian church. The Holy Ghost poured out on the day of Pentecost. this true genuine Pentecostal experience. When the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost, it was according to a promise. When the day of Pentecost was fully come, then God inaugurated his church by sending the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And from that moment on, the Holy Ghost is available to the believer who repents. &gt;&gt; There's no tearing. There's no waiting. There's no calendar. There's no workup. And it wrote a book of Acts behind it. If that tree ever puts forth an original another original limb, she'll grow the same thing. What is she going to grow? What is she going to grow? What is she? Is she going to grow? Tongues. Yeah. Right. Tongues. Is that going to be it? Is it going to be Is it is going to grow hippie skirts? Right. All the way to What? What? What is she going to grow? It'll be Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not organization. It's not nominations. He says, "Now we've got Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, Lutheran, everything else grafted into it, bearing denominational fruit." Because what do they get centered on? Their creed, the church name, their image, their work, their mission. He says, "But if it ever puts forth another branch, she will be a genuine Christfilled Christ centered word of God." &gt;&gt; Another book of Acts is Christc centered. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's what another book of Acts is, is Christ having preeminence in his church. &gt;&gt; And Jeremiah chapter 18, we'll try to we'll read just a little bit more here. Let's read verses 4 to9 because I want to I want to bring it to a close. But just see this beautiful picture here. and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter. The prophet showed up that day at the potter's house. And when he walks in, he sees a potter at the will working on clay. And as that wheel was spinning around and as he began to work on that clay, all of a sudden the clay fell or it wobbled. It it it otherwise fell apart in what he was trying to do. Jeremiah is just observing. The clay is marred in the hand of the potter. It says, "So he made it." Again, another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it. Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Oh house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter?" Sayaith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, oh house of Israel. at what instance I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning the kingdom to pluck up and pull down and to destroy it. So in my mind, I try to put myself in the image of what Jeremiah was seeing and he saw I if he if he saw the the work upon the will, maybe he just didn't walk in and all this happens in an instance, but maybe he comes to the potter's house because he knows God's going to speak to him. And maybe he tries for some time watching the potter to uh take a wedge, take some clay and begin to wedge it and begins to work on it. He takes it and he begins to create make it a little smooth. He sees him throw it down on that bat and he sees him kind of press it down and then he starts to spin the wheel, maybe putting a little bit of water there, just making sure it's going to stick. And then as he takes it, he begins to pull it up and pull it down, pull it up and pull it down and begins to work on it a little bit. He start seems like he's getting something going, but then all of a sudden something begins to happen and and it gets it and he takes it and just takes it tears it down. He pulls it off and he takes this in this particular image. Now, from what I've seen is if pottery doesn't even properly dry, you can take all those fragments. You can put it in a bucket and you can go back and take the very things that didn't work out the first time because the very same clay goes through a process &gt;&gt; to be able to made back into a smooth lump that goes right back on the wheel. The clay doesn't get thrown away, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It just has to go through a longer process. Listen, if your God's clay is never going to throw you away, &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, I just feel like I'm in a discard bucket. You're not going to be made a second. You're going to be made a new." &gt;&gt; You're not going to be sold as scraps. You're not going to be turned into uh fragments. You're not going to be used in some sort of art project of broken pottery. God's going to take that. It's may hurt. May take some time. May take some forming, some breaking down, some watering. You might have to get put through the h a press. &gt;&gt; Might have to get folded in and in and over and over again. I'm forgetting what's the apparatus you use to flatten out your clay. Slab puller. Yeah, that's that's the kind of ministry I want. [laughter] Slab the puller. Hey, I that's what I want. Just I just want to flatten you out. Just joking. [laughter] But that's WHAT GOD DOES TO US SOMETIMES. What is it called a slab? What? roller. That doesn't sound as fun. Just roll with it. A slab roller. &gt;&gt; I don't know why guy has like a Russian sound to it. Slav roller. There's a process you'll have to go through if you don't do it right. &gt;&gt; Something that may happen. And what what started to do in my heart when it when he comes to this point because I want you to think of how he takes that clay. God doesn't throw it away but he makes it takes that marred clay and he says and he made it again another vessel. Maybe it got off centered may and because it wasn't centered it it started to wobble and it got uneven and he takes that mashes it down. He picks it up and maybe he goes over to the the roller. He starts rolling it out again. Adds some water. Starts working on it. Works back through. Gets all the air bubbles out. Gets that smooth ball and he places it right back on. Same lump right back on it. And he says, "Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, aren't you mine?" So the clay is not discarded. He says, "At what instance I shall speak concerning a nation to pluck up and pull down and destroy it?" I just saw this pulling and the coning and then it not working and he destroys it. But he says, "If that nation upon whom I pronounce judgment will repent, turn from the evil that I thought to do." He says, "What instance I shall speak concerning a nation and a kingdom to build and to plant it." I'm going to stop at that verse because notice how he's saying somehow someway the clay has something to do with it. He's saying as the clay is in the potter's hand and this is I think this is the reason why the amplification was given to it because you say well what power does the clay have what what can the clay do and yes the clay in the example literal example cannot say to the POTTER'S HAND I THINK I WOULD JUST RATHER BE A lump right throw me back in the ground there it it that doesn't have but what are you doing I don't know if this is True. And and brother Victor, I just imagine there's times when you're that clay is being formed and you say, "Why won't it just cooperate? &gt;&gt; Why isn't it why isn't it cooperate? It just seems like it has a mind of its own." &gt;&gt; And here's God saying, "I can pluck it up, pull it down, and destroy it. But if this nation that is being destroyed will just repent, then I can build and plant it &gt;&gt; again. In other words, brother Brandham is in one place was talking about how these the Calvinists got out on one limb. He said, "Then the Armenians came." He said, "What did God do?" He balanced it up. God will always balance it up. But the balance wasn't in the one side. It was taking the two sides together. Paul who said you're justified by faith, James who said you're justified by works showed us from two different perspectives, but both are in Christ rooted in the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we've we've we we must for our own selves then say, "Lord, I want to come back to center &gt;&gt; as the clay. I I'm not going to try to force my own image. I I'm not going to just stand on my ring and just like, no. Uh-uh. This is where you're going to have to work on me." And he said, "Well, that's you're you're outside the center. I can't make you into what I want you to be. You've got to be centered. And so don't resist the potter's hands. You have this uniqueness of clay to where you can just yield and not lean and not push and not refuse, but just say, "Lord, I surrender. I surrender to your design. I surrender to your will." The great statement, I think it was by awtoer said, "There's nothing outside of the will of God I want, and there's nothing inside his will I fear. and using that maybe play on words. I'm in his will. I'm on his will. I'm in the center of his will. Therefore, there's nothing in his will I'm afraid of. And there's nothing outside of that will I want. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go back to the lump. I don't want to go back to THE DISCARD. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE Leodysian will. They have a grindstoneone. They have the nose to the will. They have the will that that Samson was turning in his imprisonment. But we want to be on the will of God &gt;&gt; in spiritual food in due season. Brother B says if Jesus is the center of all things to the Christian then I think we ought to let loose of everything else and cleave to him. &gt;&gt; Remember he is the center. HE IS THE NORTHSTAR. HE IS THE ULTIMATE. HE IS THE ABSOLUTE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; This is the way that we ought to think about it. And and I know it may this may seem to be in poetical terms or in terms that hold phrases of of great worth and and you know there's a beauty to it when you say that oh Jesus is the center therefore I want to let loose of everything and cleave TO HIM. HE'S THE CENTER. HE'S THE NORTHSTAR. HE'S THE ULTIMATE. HE'S THE ABSOLUTE. THAT MUST BE TRUE. &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY BY FAITH AND SUPERNATURALLY AND INTERNALLY, BUT IT MUST BECOME PRACTICAL. &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, I say, Lord, if you're working on me, I want to CENTER ON YOU SO I CAN SEE THIS PRACTICAL OUTWORKING OF CHRIST. IF CHRIST IS THE CENTER, and I just put it here. He says, let loose of everything. He said, then you're the one that has to finish that phrase. How is it that I can be centered? How is it I become unentered? Musicians, as you come to your instruments, you find your place here at the front of the church as you yield your gifts to him. If Christ is the center, then you've got to let loose and cleave to him because he is the center. Christ, that little will in the middle of the will stabilize every move, every motion, every thought because he he's in the control tower. God setting that word right there from there in this earthn vessels. He's shedding forth light. This is how you become sunlit vessels, unwaxed, unglazed by the world, centered on Christ. Lord, I don't want my heart to be unentered. Use it as a litmus test for the next time things are not uh you're feeling agitated, you're feeling buffeted, it feels too extreme, it feels hurtful, just say, "Well, am I centered?" And then [music] you step back to center. But then now all of a sudden the pressure becomes proportional, right? And you're like, "Okay, all right. I'm in this pocket now." And yeah, I'm it still hurts, but I know it's making something beautiful. You have the quality of taking external pressure and internalizing [music] it into glory. External suffering being internalized [music] into character. Then every lump of coal is turned into a diamond. But you have been placed at the right depth, at the right temperature that through the right pressure, you're being [music] turned into because you're centered right where turned into a diamond. That's what God can do to you is he can turn you into that radiant diamond. I want there to be some soberness to your thoughts now before we go to prayer. I'd like for you to be praying for yourself. Brother Brandham, in the sermon, trying to do God a service without being the will of God. This is where he talks about sincerity a lot. He says he's in prayer. He says, "May our hearts continually be set on thee." And we know, Lord, that money, property, things of the world have no meaning, just so temporal. I I I developed a phrase just [music] to keep the devil from really trying to get at us when we have unexpected expenses and things happen. Is honey, it's just money. And some people like that's the only thing. But really, that's that's all it is. If I could keep my faith in [music] Christ, if if something comes up and I spend money, if I don't make as much as I thought it would, if there things get difficult, it's just money. He has us [music] in the palm of his hand. &gt;&gt; Things of this world, money, property, have no meaning. It's just temporal. All of them must go. Our jobs, our places, our friends, everything must go. No matter how rich, how poor, how popular, unpopular we are, it all must go. But there's only one thing that our being here is centered around and that's Jesus [music] Christ. &gt;&gt; So yes, centered on him. We have jobs, we have places, we have friends, we have money, we have property, rich, poor, popular, unpopular, doesn't matter, but we're just centered on him. And we know that's what matters. That's what counts. That's what will last. He says, and that's Jesus Christ. So let us lay aside everything as secondarily and hold to him. and he is the [music] word. He says, "Grant it, Lord." So, you can have your secondary possessions. You can have your secondary things, but as it comes to him, I'm centered on him. Says, "Look, friend, there may be a little something. Maybe we just bow our heads. I want you now just to let these words deal with your heart." If you're not that, then there's something you've centered around besides that. In other words, if you can't lay aside everything else is secondary. If there's if you're not centered around him, if there's something in you that feels misshapen and uh uncomfortable, he says, then you aren't center you're centered on something. He says you're as close to it. You're looking at you see it. You've seen it for years. You see it coming matured now. Maybe you've been a Christian. You've seen these things. You've been associated with Christ. He says, but now you see it's not the center. If that means everything to us and nothing else is going to last but that, why not just turn your head from that thing you've been looking at and center yourself on him, which the center of all life and all hereafter is him? I say that to you right now with heads bowed. If if it's if he's not the center and you feel that he's not the center, but you you've been close to it and you see that it it should mean everything to us and nothing else is going to last but Christ, WHY NOT JUST TURN your head from that thing you've been looking at? Well, what is that thing you've been looking at? For a young person, it could be different things. For an uh for the young families, it could be something else from the just anyone who whom Christ is not the center. He says, "Whatever it is you've been looking at," he says, [music] "Christ is the center." And as he's imploring them, it's just such a beautiful thought. He says, he's imploring them, and I know it's 11:42 right here in Phoenix, Arizona today. [music] And he says, when he's preaching, he says, "Have you forgotten about dinner?" What's he say? Right now, in this moment, you should be thinking about Christ. But now we start thinking about where are we going to lunch? What about that meal in the crock pot? He says, "Have you forgotten whether the kids are all right?" He says, "Out in the car or not? Have you forgotten all about the past and realize what that is you're feeling right now? What is it you're feeling right now? What is it you have been feeling? What is it God has been speaking to your heart?" He says, "It's materializing before you day by day. Let that be the center of whatever. Let the rest of the things go away. They're going to perish anyhow. [music] Oh, just keep following after him. What is it THAT HAPPENS WHEN GOD STARTS DEALING WITH OUR HEARTS? OH, NO. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GIVE THAT UP. OH, NO. I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO LOOK LIKE THIS. OH, NO. I DON'T KNOW. OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. I don't know about that. AND THERE'S A PART OF US THAT BEGINS TO LONG FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE SAY, "OH, BUT BUT I'M AFRAID OF WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN. I'M AFRAID OF WHAT THIS MAY turn into." You said, "Well, don't don't worry about all of that. Don't worry about all these things that bring fearful sights and and anxiety. [music] Let Christ, the one that's been dealing with your heart, let that be the center and yield to it. He said, "Let everything else go away. I'm worried about my job. I'm worried about my car. I'm worried about my family. I'm worried about this. I'm worried about popularity. I'm worried about this. I'm worried about Let it all fade away. They're all going to perish anyhow. If you took it all to the grave, you'd be no different than the dead pharaohs that were buried with servants. riches and wealth and it just rotted alongside [music] them. Just keep following him. If you need prayer this [music] morning, I would ask that with every head bowed, if you'd like, if you want Christ to be the center, if you want to receive him even today for your brokenness, for your sins, like [music] to repent, you'd want to stand. So, Lord, here I'm coming to you. the song being played. Jesus [music] at the center of it all. Nothing else matters. What is it? He's dealing with you in your heart over say this is I don't know [music] what it means, brother Heron. I don't know what it means for my social life. I don't know what it means for my fashion. I don't know what it means for my friends. I don't know what it means for my future. But all I know right now, I want my life to be in his hands. That's what resolves depression and ideiations of harmful [music] sorts. It's what's going to cause you to be able to lay ever so awake at night and say, "I know it is well with my soul." And maybe we can say, "Lord, make it well [music] today. I come to you. I'm uncertain. I'm unsure. But Lord, I feel that you're telling me to rest. Just rest in not in the future, but in you now, the one who holds all things, the center of all life and the [music] hereafter. I come to you, Lord, with my brokenness, with my need for salvation, whatever it might be. If we could just stand together, joining those who've stood. I believe you've stood in the presence of God. I believe he sees your heart. He knows what you're going through. Our gracious heavenly father, today as we pray, I pray for these that stood. And Lord, covers quite a range of ages, circumstances, and situations. But truly, Lord, we could say that they stood in response to a singular Christ. And that each one in [music] their own particular way want to find themselves in the center of your will upon your potter's wheel. And not just on the will, but Lord, I want to be centered. Maybe we've been too happy with playing on the fringes. But Lord, I pray that you could just get me so solidly rooted on that spot. The pulling, the coning, the up and down, the mashing, the forming, the shaping. It may seem gratuitous over and over and all the thousands of revolutions [music] that that will makes, but yet it's all for the purpose of centering us. And Lord, I think of a church. We've had 500 some odd services, more than 500. Myself having preached around over 450 or something sermons in this church. Lord, you think, "Oh, man, that's a lot of revolutions. That's a lot [music] of spinning. Maybe a lot of the same things, but it's all for the purpose of making sure we're centered." Because if there is a new body that's being [music] materialized, if there is a new body that's being formed, it's going to be [music] perfect. It's going to be like your son's glorified body. Then Lord, I know that as you've gone to prepare a place for me that you're still working on me. Therefore, Lord, I pray for each one of these young people and the parents that stood and each believer that stood and said, "Lord, I I want to come back to the center, the center of it all." Lord, I I know I'm using platitudes and phrases, but what else can we do except now we just accept [music] you according to your promise and in your word and say, "Lord, I believe in you. I believe that you died for my sins. I believe there's no other way to be saved except through Jesus Christ. I believe he said to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. I believe in the promise of the Holy Ghost and I believe in the image of Christ that speaks through the word and I want to become that this Bible is your absolute and then I want to center my life on scriptural principles. Help us Lord to by that spirit which is in the inter inner man. May we be rooted and grounded in you. That Christ can dwell in [music] our hearts by faith that we may grow up into you in all things and that we might be filled with all the fullness of God. Bless us I pray as we commit the [music] these to you in Jesus name. Amen.
