[0:00] on Wednesday night we began um a subject
[0:03] on Liberty there's been a few things
[0:05] that we've said over the last uh several
[0:06] months on freedom and liberty I think
[0:09] even going back to some things last year
[0:11] uh we've touched on some of these same
[0:13] principles and we talked about perfect
[0:16] Liberty on Wednesday night we even were
[0:18] able to use it in the context of the
[0:20] Declaration of Independence and the
[0:21] Liberty that we have as uh Americans and
[0:25] we kind of identified just what a
[0:27] difficult dance um Liberty can be where
[0:30] some want freedom and then in their
[0:31] freedom of speech or freedom of
[0:33] expression uh freedom to choose and
[0:36] freedom of of of the press and all these
[0:40] different freedoms that we lift up and
[0:41] that we have that there's this limit to
[0:44] it that if Freedom doesn't have any
[0:45] anchor Freedom doesn't have any
[0:47] boundaries then it either destroys
[0:49] civilization or it requires a dictator
[0:52] or a despotism to come and to reign as a
[0:55] uh tyrannical leader over the people in
[0:57] order to ensure civilization so we're
[1:00] just kind of seeing that Razor's Edge of
[1:02] freedom and liberty and then looking
[1:05] into the scripture to find out what is
[1:06] this Liberty uh that we enjoy in Christ
[1:10] and today we're going to use the title
[1:12] imperfect Liberty Wednesday night was
[1:15] perfect Liberty today is imperfect
[1:17] Liberty and uh Lord willing may be
[1:20] Wednesday we may Minister on um Liberty
[1:23] being practice what does it mean to
[1:25] exercise our Liberty and the Hebrew
[1:28] excuse me the Greek word that used for
[1:30] Liberty in the scripture uh it could
[1:32] have been translated to Freedom the
[1:34] freedom that we have in Christ it means
[1:36] to be free uh kind of has its roots in
[1:39] being freeorn and and a citizen one who
[1:41] has all rights and privileges as a
[1:44] citizen and and it's maybe at its core
[1:48] not necessarily its use but it kind of
[1:49] means to be exempt from and so you're
[1:51] exempt some from something you're you're
[1:53] not restrained or kept from uh enjoying
[1:57] certain things so to have this Liberty
[1:59] of freedom is the absence of restraint
[2:02] you're not bound by any particular
[2:03] obligation or debt or Duty and it speaks
[2:06] of even this deliverance from bondage
[2:09] and in doing so uh it this is the word
[2:12] that's used even in the scripture this
[2:14] absence of restraint the deliverance
[2:16] from bondage uh the not bound by some
[2:18] sort of
[2:19] obligation and the modern idea of
[2:22] Liberty is kind of like the power of
[2:24] self-determination that I have the right
[2:26] the free will this right to determine my
[2:28] own Direction the freedom to do as one
[2:31] pleases and it's there that people
[2:34] exercising their Liberty begin to take
[2:36] Liberties and and do things that go
[2:38] beyond the bounds of what is proper and
[2:41] I've never had so many fans this morning
[2:44] this is I don't know if it's going to
[2:47] you know make me preach longer it's like
[2:48] they're taking care of it they're going
[2:50] to be okay or if I need to cut it short
[2:52] but I asked the question what does it
[2:54] mean to be free or have Liberty let me
[2:58] just interject we've been in discussion
[3:00] and we're hopeful that we can add to our
[3:03] air cold air capacity here very very
[3:06] soon and and so you won't necessarily
[3:08] need to keep Fanning Lord willing we can
[3:10] get that done as soon as possible just
[3:12] bear with it and make it through it's
[3:14] better than what it could be and I trust
[3:16] that the word will word will what will
[3:18] be what matters the
[3:21] most so the question could be what is it
[3:23] mean to have Liberty it's a question
[3:25] that people wrestle with in a Democratic
[3:27] Society it's a question a lot of people
[3:29] ask themselves that they're living in
[3:31] other countries where there's not a lot
[3:32] of freedoms or rights but I think it's
[3:35] more uh I'm looking at it more
[3:36] necessarily scripturally what does it
[3:38] mean to be free or to have this Liberty
[3:41] and some of the thoughts that have kind
[3:42] of been coming to me and I've been
[3:44] putting them aside and kind of building
[3:46] in this area is uh kind of the idea that
[3:49] if you're in a place that you dwell and
[3:51] you don't feel welcome uh it's kind that
[3:54] you don't you don't have Liberty uh you
[3:56] don't feel that you can maybe say
[3:58] something or do something and it has a
[4:00] sense of being free has the sense of
[4:01] feeling at home or having some sort of
[4:03] ownership uh for those of us who rent
[4:06] properties and so we're renting where we
[4:07] live live we're not just free to do
[4:09] whatever we want to it without
[4:12] consequence we may be feel free to do it
[4:15] but there may be some consequence later
[4:16] if we say well I don't like this wall
[4:18] here I'm just going to tear it out and
[4:20] then you go to move out and the landlord
[4:21] says wait a minute what happened to my
[4:23] wall that was a special wall and then
[4:25] you're going to end up there's some sort
[4:26] of consequence or payment uh that would
[4:28] be owed so there's this idea of feeling
[4:30] at home and having ownership and
[4:32] belonging that speaks to this idea of
[4:35] Liberty and being free if one is in
[4:38] their home country they have certain
[4:39] rights and privileges if one feels at
[4:41] home they'll they'll exercise certain
[4:44] Liberties and so this concept of Liberty
[4:48] has application to how we live our lives
[4:51] has application to our homes has
[4:53] application to our churches and that's
[4:54] why I've just felt impressed to keep it
[4:56] in that vein of the house of the Lord
[4:58] and what it means to be a Dwelling Place
[5:00] of God what it means to make our homes
[5:02] Dwelling Places and what it means for
[5:04] our church to be a place that God's
[5:06] presence is welcome and today I'm hoping
[5:09] to set this forth in a way to where it
[5:11] can kind of be a setup for exercis in
[5:14] our Liberty and how that relates to our
[5:16] home life now in 2 Corinthians chapter
[5:18] 3: 17 and 18 uh Paul is writing about
[5:23] the glory of the Lord and how that Minds
[5:25] have been blinded and even reference to
[5:29] the Veil that was over Moses's face face
[5:32] and then there's going to be a turning
[5:33] to the Lord and the veil will be removed
[5:36] so it's revealing we can even see this
[5:37] idea of Christ being revealed this this
[5:40] unveiling of Christ and once Christ has
[5:43] been revealed there's this loosing that
[5:45] takes place to the individual to where
[5:47] now they have Liberty and freedom at the
[5:49] revelation of Jesus Christ and so he
[5:51] says and now the Lord is that spirit and
[5:55] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[5:57] Liberty there is freedom there is
[5:59] exemption from something and then lest
[6:02] we get the wrong idea or concept of what
[6:04] this Liberty is Paul kind of puts his
[6:06] finger on the true meaning of Liberty in
[6:08] Christ and gives us this real meaning he
[6:10] says but we all now with this Liberty we
[6:13] all with open face beholding as in a
[6:15] mirror as in a glass the glory of the
[6:18] Lord this revealing of Jesus Christ
[6:20] where we can see him as he is we are
[6:22] changed into the same image of Christ
[6:25] into the same image from glory to glory
[6:27] even as by the spirit of the Lord so
[6:31] this scripture is setting forth the
[6:32] principle where the spirit of the Lord
[6:34] is there is Liberty it means we have
[6:35] been set at Liberty to be formed into
[6:38] the image and the nature of Christ that
[6:41] we are partakers of his divine nature
[6:43] being partakers of his divine nature we
[6:45] can be changed in this process of
[6:47] maturing into his very image so Liberty
[6:51] here is freedom to become it's freedom
[6:54] from our our habits it's freedom from
[6:56] our human thinking it's freedom from the
[6:58] worst of our human ity that's what this
[7:00] where the spirit of the Lord there is
[7:02] Liberty now I would argue or or maybe
[7:06] incorrectly assume that we usually hear
[7:09] this statement where the spirit of the
[7:10] Lord is there's liberty to describe what
[7:13] takes place within a church service I
[7:15] think that's for myself that's the only
[7:18] context I think I've ever heard it in is
[7:20] where the spirit of the Lord there is
[7:22] there is Liberty to act how you feel to
[7:26] act and so this uh and I'm not I'm I'm
[7:30] not making the point at least at this
[7:32] point that that's not the case but
[7:34] rather as we look at the scripture
[7:37] really what does it mean what is it
[7:38] setting forth It's that we would see
[7:41] Christ and in seeing Christ would be
[7:43] changed and where Christ has been
[7:45] revealed we're loosed we're no longer
[7:47] bound we're free to be changed into this
[7:49] image of Christ James is the one that
[7:52] uses this phrase the perfect law of
[7:55] Liberty in James 1: 25 and he's touching
[7:58] on a very similar concept but who so
[8:00] lookth into the perfect law of Liberty
[8:03] and continueth therein he being not a
[8:06] forgetful here but a doer of the work
[8:09] this man shall be blessed in his deed so
[8:12] it's the same idea that when we uh the
[8:14] perfect law of Liberty when we look into
[8:17] Christ who is that Spirit when we look
[8:19] into the mirror when we have this look
[8:22] into the perfect law of Liberty and
[8:24] continue therein we are changed one
[8:27] that's doing that is not just to hear
[8:29] but a doer and if you could maybe just
[8:32] write in the margin a a doer of the word
[8:34] not just a hear cuz those those that
[8:36] hear his word and do it are likened unto
[8:39] a certain individual and it all ties
[8:40] into this idea of Liberty so this
[8:44] perfect law of Liberty is the same it's
[8:46] found in Christ the word it's found by
[8:49] continuing therein by looking into and
[8:52] gazing upon the word we are free if he's
[8:55] been unveiled and we've been loosed then
[8:57] we're free to take it to eat it it up to
[8:59] look into it it's all right it's
[9:01] something that we can
[9:03] do and we could again just touch on just
[9:06] to so you're thinking about this in a
[9:08] very practical way what does this mean
[9:09] for a church service and for worship and
[9:12] uh uh and and church order and how God
[9:14] would want things to be operated not
[9:16] just in church but in our lives in our
[9:17] thinking in our
[9:19] actions James chapter 8: 31- 38 excuse
[9:23] me John chapter 8 some of you Bible
[9:26] scholars are like but James chapter 8
[9:28] John chapter 8:
[9:31] 31-38 then said Jesus to the Jews which
[9:34] believed on him because James is saying
[9:36] as he that looks into the word and
[9:38] continues
[9:40] therein is looking into the perfect law
[9:42] of Liberty and it's changed he's a doer
[9:45] of the work he says if ye continue in my
[9:48] word then are ye my disciples indeed and
[9:52] ye shall know the truth and the truth
[9:54] shall make you free maybe one of the
[9:57] most outstanding scriptures on Liberty
[9:58] of freedom ye shall know the truth and
[10:00] the truth shall make you free not
[10:03] necessarily set you free but it's going
[10:05] to make you free now to say make you
[10:08] free if we even use it in the sense of
[10:10] make you freeorn and make you a a
[10:13] citizen or a member of the Kingdom then
[10:16] you'd recognize you can begin to kind of
[10:18] understand why the Jews who heard this
[10:20] took such offense to it because they
[10:22] answered him we be Abraham's seed and
[10:25] were never in bondage to any man how
[10:28] sayest thou ye shall be made free we are
[10:31] we are not of the of the Heathen Nations
[10:35] we are not of a unchosen generation we
[10:37] are kingdoms of priest unto God and we
[10:40] are Abraham's seed therefore we have
[10:42] never been in bondage to any man and
[10:45] Christ is saying that if you hear my
[10:46] word and continue therein you will be
[10:49] made free you'll know the truth and the
[10:51] truth shall make you free they said
[10:52] we're we are free men we are at Liberty
[10:56] so Jesus answers and then kind of shines
[10:59] a light on what Liberty is says Jesus
[11:02] answered them verily verily I say unto
[11:04] you whosoever committeth sin is the
[11:06] servant of sin this is telling us what
[11:08] our Liberty is that he whosoever
[11:11] committeth sin is the servant of sin and
[11:14] the servant abideth not in the house
[11:16] forever but the son abideth ever so
[11:19] there's your concept of a son who would
[11:21] be a free man a son who would have all
[11:24] rights and privileges of being a son and
[11:25] how that the servant can abide in the
[11:27] house but he has no rights and just to
[11:29] the house he's Bound by some other he's
[11:31] not exempt from some sort of other
[11:33] obligation but the son abides forever if
[11:36] the son therefore shall make you free
[11:38] you shall be free indeed I know that you
[11:41] are Abraham's seed but you seek to kill
[11:43] me because my word hath no place in you
[11:47] so it's the word having place it's the
[11:49] word having preeminence it's the word
[11:52] that uh gives us our Liberty I speak
[11:54] that which I have seen with my father
[11:56] and ye do that which you have seen with
[11:58] your father quite a statement especially
[12:01] when it comes to Liberty and and we're
[12:03] not born of fornication and we're
[12:05] Abraham's seed and we are free but Jesus
[12:08] is showing giving us these images of one
[12:11] who exists within a house within a home
[12:13] as a free man with Liberty with rights
[12:15] and Privileges and that one who is a
[12:17] servant and he's saying though you might
[12:19] claim to be in the house of Abraham you
[12:23] are a liberty it is a sin to disbelieve
[12:26] God's
[12:27] word Liberty is freedom from unbelief
[12:30] and its attributes freedom from
[12:33] deception freedom from the LIE every
[12:35] word of God to not live by bread alone
[12:37] but by live by every word that
[12:39] proceedeth from the mouth of
[12:41] God how I so perfect Liberty is this
[12:44] freedom and it's Central it's Central to
[12:46] freedom from sin freedom from
[12:49] unbelief I had a statement here that I
[12:51] wanted to read from anointed ones at the
[12:54] end time I believe it was let me just
[12:57] check and make sure that it might have
[12:58] been
[13:00] um from Satan's
[13:04] Eden yeah I think it's maybe
[13:07] from well I don't remember where it is
[13:10] but I changed the order yesterday and so
[13:13] that this statement seems to be kind of
[13:15] a
[13:16] jump I maybe what we'll say later we'll
[13:19] kind of fill it in but perfect Liberty
[13:22] brother BR talks about how certain
[13:23] things can be perverted righteousness
[13:25] perverted and a truth perverted and is
[13:27] what you get wickedness and you get a
[13:28] lie
[13:29] perfect Liberty can be perverted into
[13:32] imperfect Liberty we could say perverted
[13:34] Liberty but it's an imperfect Liberty
[13:37] where and I'll say it this way you may
[13:39] have that right to do it to do it may
[13:41] not be sin but to call that perfect
[13:43] Liberty is not the case it's not the
[13:45] perfect Liberty that God has given us
[13:47] necessarily when we make it into
[13:49] something that it's not so when I use
[13:52] the phrase imperfect Liberty I'm
[13:54] speaking of maybe the promise of Liberty
[13:56] or the appearance of Liberty but in
[13:58] reality it becomes bondage that where in
[14:01] exercising my right as a free man in
[14:04] exercising my rights as an American or
[14:05] exercising my rights as a human being or
[14:08] in even exercising the Liberty that I
[14:10] have in Christ as a free man this is
[14:13] what I have the right to enjoy and this
[14:14] is what I have the right to be and to do
[14:17] that we say it based upon this Liberty
[14:19] that I have I'm free to do this but
[14:21] actually in doing it we're no longer
[14:23] free we come into
[14:26] bondage uh please note this this is at
[14:28] the very hor inspired this entire thing
[14:31] and you'll recognize this phrase even in
[14:32] the scripture if you look into the Greek
[14:34] Lexicon and the meaning of this perfect
[14:36] law of Liberty and this Liberty that
[14:39] Paul is speaking at where the spirit of
[14:41] Lord there is Liberty to the meaning
[14:44] behind this even to the Jews would be to
[14:47] live as one ought to
[14:50] live the to have perfect Liberty means I
[14:53] can live the way that I should I can
[14:55] live the way that I ought to I can live
[14:57] by the way that is corre correct it's
[15:00] doing what is correct I am free to
[15:02] fulfill my duty that is expected of me
[15:05] as as a son or as what I am so it's to
[15:09] live as one ought to and so to live as
[15:12] we ought to is to abide in to abide and
[15:17] live as God desires us to that whatever
[15:20] the word would expect whatever one's
[15:22] expectations are because when we say
[15:23] well you ought to have done this in
[15:25] other words there's a certain
[15:26] expectation and then you do it you ought
[15:29] to have done this you ought to have done
[15:31] that you you understand that if we're to
[15:32] live as we ought to it means we we do
[15:35] what's expected of us so when we have
[15:38] Liberty we can do as the word expects us
[15:40] when we have Liberty we can live as God
[15:42] would desire us to live now I realize
[15:45] that runs counter to our leot deian idea
[15:48] of Liberty in that we have people's
[15:50] rights it's like well I don't want to do
[15:52] what you say and I don't want to live
[15:53] like you want me to live so imperfect
[15:56] Liberty would be this
[15:59] that one would live as one wants
[16:02] to one lives doing what they please
[16:06] doing what pleases the
[16:08] Flesh and and and may be saying this is
[16:11] what I want to do therefore it's what I
[16:13] ought to do and me wanting to do this
[16:16] and me exercising this and doing this
[16:18] this is what this is who I am and this
[16:20] is what I feel I should be and so
[16:22] perfect Liberty is to do as you should
[16:24] or as you ought it's the correct way to
[16:26] live imperfect Liberty is just doing
[16:29] what you want now to see this in
[16:31] scripture in 1 Peter Chap 2:
[16:35] 13-6
[16:39] and there's
[16:42] a a lot in this 1 Peter chapter 2: 13-6
[16:47] submit yourselves to every ordinance of
[16:50] man for the Lord's sake whether it be to
[16:52] the king as Supreme I wonder if our
[16:55] founding fathers ever read 1 Peter
[16:58] chapter 2
[17:00] it's interesting when you begin to drill
[17:01] down on certain things and America is a
[17:03] great nation and you'll find that they
[17:04] did certain things that we could find in
[17:06] the scripture where well wait a minute
[17:08] so it just speaks to sometimes the
[17:10] Paradox we find in the word of God he
[17:12] says submit yourselves to every
[17:14] ordinance of man for the Lord's sake
[17:15] whether it be to the king as supreme or
[17:18] unto Governors as unto them that are
[17:20] sent by him for the punishment of
[17:22] evildoers and for the praise of them
[17:24] that do well that's quite a statement it
[17:27] may be written in a language that's
[17:28] difficult for us to understand but he's
[17:30] saying as Christians submit yourself to
[17:32] the law of the land submit yourself to
[17:34] Governors and Mayors and submit yourself
[17:36] to law enforcement and and do what you
[17:38] ought to he says for so is the will of
[17:40] God now there's a reason for this
[17:43] especially in the birth of Christianity
[17:45] and especially what Christianity
[17:47] represents and stands for it says so for
[17:49] so is the will of God that with wello
[17:51] you may put to silence the ignorance of
[17:53] foolish
[17:54] men that if if Christianity well
[17:58] Christianity did exactly what Peter was
[18:01] was saying we shouldn't do that it
[18:03] becomes marked by rebellion and Crusades
[18:06] and killing of other people who don't
[18:08] believe the same way and the
[18:09] overthrowing of governments and the
[18:10] eradication and genocide of people that
[18:12] don't feel the same way you do and so he
[18:14] saying we should not engage in these
[18:18] acts so that we would put to silence the
[18:21] ignorance of foolish men that say oh
[18:23] well Christianity is just an attempt to
[18:26] evade this and to rebel against that and
[18:28] to have it the way that you want it so
[18:29] he says as free we are free and not
[18:33] using your Liberty for a cloak of
[18:35] maliciousness but as Servants of
[18:38] God being made free from sin by the word
[18:42] says we do not use our Liberty as a veil
[18:46] of evil we do not use the Liberty that
[18:49] we have in Christ and the freedom to do
[18:51] these things which we feel that we want
[18:53] to do a as a a cloak over Wicked intent
[18:58] Pride or vanity so our freedom does not
[19:02] give us license to do whatever we want
[19:06] our Liberty in Christ does not give us
[19:07] license to do whatever we please our
[19:10] Liberty in Christ we understand does not
[19:12] allow us to live contrary to the word of
[19:15] God Paul addresses the idea of Grace and
[19:18] this oh well since Grace is for my sin
[19:22] do I sin more so that there could be
[19:23] more grace and he says no that's
[19:25] foolishness so our Liberty in Christ
[19:27] does not allow us to to live and does
[19:29] not give us Liberty or license or the
[19:31] right to live contrary to God's word and
[19:35] Peter is saying nor does it give you the
[19:37] right or it uh authorize you to rebel
[19:41] against Authority and I would say this
[19:44] is the general rule this is the general
[19:46] setting
[19:48] forth we could read in other places
[19:50] we'll do so here in a minute in second
[19:52] Peter but our Liberty we cannot use he
[19:55] says the cloak of maliciousness so well
[19:57] I'm free to do this and I can say this
[19:59] and I can do this can't use this under
[20:02] the pretense of Christian Liberty should
[20:04] we ever under the pretense of being free
[20:06] under the pretense of being a message
[20:08] believer under the pretense of being
[20:10] bright should we ever use our Liberty to
[20:12] hurt somebody else we should never use
[20:14] our Liberty to destroy somebody else's
[20:18] property Peter's saying that we ought to
[20:20] obey ordinances and we ought to show
[20:22] respect and we we shouldn't conduct
[20:23] ourselves in a certain way to where just
[20:25] because we're Christians we have a right
[20:27] to do this we have a right to do that
[20:28] saying that we should never use our
[20:30] Christian Liberty as a cloak of
[20:32] maliciousness to hurt somebody or to
[20:35] destroy somebody else's
[20:36] property now the reason why this is such
[20:39] appointed letter is the Jews profess
[20:41] this duty to God and in their duty to
[20:44] God Alone they continually rebelled
[20:47] against Authority because they'd say
[20:49] well our duut is to God we don't have to
[20:51] do this and our duy is to God we don't
[20:52] have to do that and they were always
[20:55] using their Liberty as Jesus said that
[20:57] oh I know your sons have Abraham but you
[21:00] seek to kill
[21:01] me and and they would be willing to void
[21:04] and violate Roman law and those that
[21:07] ruled over them saying well we we be the
[21:09] Seed of Abraham and we're sons of God
[21:11] and he's saying God's word doesn't even
[21:13] abide in you so they used their Liberty
[21:16] as a pretext for Rebellion they used it
[21:18] to to vindicate and justify acts of
[21:23] sedition they used it to claim that as
[21:27] go children of God are as the Chosen and
[21:30] as his Nation they could do whatever
[21:31] they wanted and it was
[21:33] justified now I'll say this at the risk
[21:35] of getting cancelled it may be accepted
[21:37] by others so you get canceled on one and
[21:39] you get spun up by the other but just
[21:42] because the Jews are God's chosen people
[21:44] doesn't mean every single thing they do
[21:46] is
[21:47] right and I think where there's this
[21:50] idea that's propagated within nominal
[21:52] Christianity support the Jews support
[21:53] the Jews to where if they do something
[21:56] praise the
[21:57] Lord God's chosen
[21:59] people and so I just throw this out
[22:01] there as a caution yes they're God's
[22:03] chosen people yes we can scripturally
[22:05] identify them a a and there's a great
[22:08] preciousness to to Israel in Jerusalem
[22:11] and to the Jews and God is going to
[22:13] visit them again and he's going to
[22:14] reveal himself to them but we cannot
[22:17] fall under the same mindset that they
[22:20] have today that they had then that
[22:22] Peter's rebuking that you use the fact
[22:24] that you are the chosen people and and
[22:27] the children of God as a justification
[22:30] for evil
[22:32] conduct for sedici rebellions and and
[22:35] coup attempts you name
[22:38] it and so this is that imperfect Liberty
[22:42] that uh Peter's talking about or I say
[22:45] that Peter's referring to this imperfect
[22:47] Liberty because you use your Liberty for
[22:49] the wrong things and to me the part that
[22:51] is so amazing is that while reading this
[22:53] he's saying
[22:54] submit and Obey do what is right right
[22:59] and he says using as
[23:01] free you you we would be thinking well I
[23:04] guess I don't have any rights anymore
[23:06] guess I'm not free to do whatever I want
[23:08] but he's say no as
[23:10] free and as this the great qualifier
[23:13] Servants of God we're free but we're not
[23:16] without a duty we're at Liberty but not
[23:19] without some uh correct Behavior or
[23:21] expectation of us so this perverted
[23:24] Liberty that Peter is referring to this
[23:26] imperfect Liberty where we use it to do
[23:28] to justify the wrong kind of act it
[23:30] leads us away from God's perfect
[23:33] will so we cannot use Liberty I want you
[23:36] to recognize this part in particular
[23:38] because I don't feel that I need to so
[23:40] much emphasize this now we cannot use
[23:43] Liberty in Christ to indulge in sinful
[23:47] Behavior cannot use Liberty as a cloak
[23:50] of lasciviousness a cloak of indulgence
[23:54] to where we do unrighteousness to
[23:56] satisfy the desires of the flesh and I
[23:58] want to take it a step further we cannot
[24:00] use the justification of Liberty to
[24:03] justify anything that we would do in the
[24:06] flesh that we would be able to make
[24:08] anything that we want to do and ought to
[24:11] do in second Peter chapter 2 I wanted to
[24:15] read the entire chapter and I'm glad I I
[24:18] made this wise decision not to do so
[24:21] because it would just prolong the
[24:24] inevitable take the name of Jesus with
[24:27] you that some of you are already
[24:30] humming in second Peter chapter 2 he is
[24:33] warning against false prophets you see
[24:35] this at the very beginning and teachers
[24:37] that deny the Lord though they may
[24:39] profess him they're denying him so in
[24:41] verse 10 let's just read through this so
[24:43] we could kind of get uh take in just
[24:46] kind of get the bouquet of what uh uh uh
[24:48] Peter's talking about here before we
[24:50] take a sip but chiefly them that walk
[24:53] after the Flesh in the lust of
[24:54] uncleanness and despise government I
[24:57] maybe the people that read this we like
[24:58] man Peter just won't leave this alone
[25:01] first letter he's talking about obey the
[25:03] governors and the leaders and the King
[25:04] Supreme and now he's talking about us
[25:06] who despise government presumptuous are
[25:09] they self-willed they are not afraid to
[25:11] speak evil of
[25:13] dignities man such a uh powerful
[25:17] statement whereas Angels which are great
[25:18] in power and might bring not raing
[25:21] accusation against them before the
[25:23] Lord but these As Natural brute Beast
[25:26] made to be taken and destroyed speak
[25:28] evil of the things that they understand
[25:30] not and shall utterly perish in their
[25:33] own
[25:34] corruption recently a brother did
[25:36] something and and the response to him is
[25:38] I see that you have not outgrown your
[25:39] hobell shoes I was like that is a
[25:42] perfect
[25:43] response because it was kind of like it
[25:45] was such a like why would you have the
[25:47] audacity to do that because Angels you
[25:50] know Fear To Tread on the place that you
[25:53] just put on your hobn shoes and trounced
[25:55] all over and he's saying here that even
[25:57] angels in their power and might don't do
[26:00] the same kind of railings that you do
[26:01] this presumptuous self-willed
[26:05] ignorance that is causing you to perish
[26:07] in your own corruption and shall receive
[26:09] the reward of unrighteousness as they
[26:10] count it pleasure to Riot in the
[26:14] daytime spots they are in blemishes
[26:16] sporting themselves with their own
[26:17] deceiving while they Feast with you
[26:19] spots in our Feast of Charity brother
[26:22] bam talks about how we're not in a
[26:24] festival this isn't a festival of chaos
[26:26] but this is a feast
[26:29] the solemn Feast he says having eyes
[26:30] full of adultery that cannot cease from
[26:33] sin beguiling unstable souls and a heart
[26:36] they have exercised with Covetous
[26:38] practices cursed
[26:41] children are you you able to paint the
[26:43] picture this morning what Peter's
[26:45] dealing with which have forsaken the
[26:47] right way and are gone astray following
[26:49] the way of balum the son of basor who
[26:52] loved the wages of
[26:56] unrighteousness but was rebuked for his
[26:58] iniquity the dumbass speaking with man's
[27:01] voice forbade The Madness of the
[27:05] Prophet I think we should do a series on
[27:07] this chapter these are wells without
[27:10] water clouds that are carried with the
[27:11] temptest they're empty they're Bluffs
[27:13] they're
[27:14] lying to whom the Mist Of Darkness is
[27:17] reserved forever for when they speak
[27:20] great swelling words of vanity they
[27:21] Allure through the lust of the flesh now
[27:25] I think sometimes when we say great
[27:26] words of vanity we like to say oh those
[27:28] are the teachers those are the ones that
[27:30] are teaching and and they're causing
[27:32] those with these these great technical
[27:33] words and with their degrees they're
[27:35] teaching things and breaking things down
[27:37] but notice how he says they great
[27:39] swelling words of vanity it's not so
[27:41] much that it's educated and it's
[27:43] articulate I'm not trying to give myself
[27:44] a defense today but it's that they use
[27:47] these empty words they're swelling they
[27:50] don't have substance they've just kind
[27:51] of puffed them up so they look bigger
[27:53] than they are and what it does is it
[27:55] attracts the flesh it allur the lust of
[27:58] the flesh through much wanness those
[28:01] that were clean escaped from them who
[28:03] lived in
[28:04] ER while they promise them
[28:08] Liberty notice how through the
[28:10] allurement of the flesh the excitement
[28:13] of the emotions and these and these
[28:15] Sensations these great swelling words of
[28:17] Pride Allure the lust of the flesh
[28:19] through what wanting and longing to be
[28:21] as one wants to not necessarily as the
[28:23] ought to says while they promise them
[28:25] Liberty so here's the promise of Liberty
[28:29] that through great swelling words of
[28:31] vanity alluring the lust of the Flesh
[28:33] and pro uh uh provoking your longing
[28:36] they're promising you
[28:39] Liberty to be
[28:41] free they themselves are the Servants of
[28:44] corruption for of whom a man is overcome
[28:47] of the same as he brought in
[28:49] bondage if you're overcome by something
[28:51] you're servant to it for if after they
[28:54] have escaped the pollutions of the world
[28:56] through the knowledge of the Lord and
[28:58] Savior Jesus Christ they are again
[28:59] entangled therein and overcome the
[29:01] latter end is worse with them than the
[29:04] beginning for it had been better for
[29:06] them not to have known the way of
[29:07] righteousness than after they have known
[29:09] it to turn from the holy commandment
[29:11] delivered unto them while promising
[29:14] Liberty from what the holy commandment
[29:16] oh that's just too much you're being
[29:18] asked to do too much it's not necessary
[29:20] to do this or you don't have to abide by
[29:22] that or you can do this and you can do
[29:24] that but it has happened unto them
[29:26] according to the true proverb and the
[29:28] find where brother Bram touched on this
[29:29] in many places the dog has turned to his
[29:31] own vomit again and the s that was
[29:33] washed to her wallowing in the
[29:37] M brother Brandon most often referred to
[29:39] the Pentecostal movement when using this
[29:45] scripture now in the sermon the anointed
[29:48] ones at the end time and I'm reading
[29:50] this because brother brandham and I'm
[29:51] reading it here because brother Bam's
[29:53] making reference to
[29:56] the uh
[30:00] to balum
[30:04] here and then I you see how brother
[30:06] bandam uses this the anointed ones at
[30:07] the end time how many are recently
[30:09] familiar with the anointed ones at the
[30:11] end time listen to it recently I think
[30:13] we're all maybe familiar to as message
[30:14] Believers but it's such a important
[30:17] sermon oh you people don't miss this
[30:21] these imposters impersonators appeared
[30:23] after the true one had went first they
[30:26] come to impersonate
[30:28] now there
[30:29] is if we could look at this statement
[30:32] that when one is entangled in something
[30:34] and then is overcome again with it so
[30:36] like if you've been made free from
[30:38] something some idea some requirement
[30:40] some obligation some some thought
[30:42] process once you've been made free from
[30:44] it to get tangled up back in it again is
[30:47] like a dog going to its vomit hog to its
[30:49] Waller and and he's saying that this is
[30:51] not actually Freedom that if God's
[30:53] called you out of bondage called you out
[30:55] of dark denominationalism called you out
[30:57] of something then to exercise your
[30:59] Liberty to begin to lift and pick those
[31:02] things back up is worse than when you
[31:05] were just in it to begin
[31:07] with and now there is this danger then
[31:11] in this impers impersonation and he's
[31:13] saying that these impersonators come
[31:14] after the true they come to impersonate
[31:16] to mimic and to copy something that's
[31:18] been done before he says they have to
[31:20] the devil cannot create anything he's
[31:22] just a perverter of the
[31:24] original so if if sin is right
[31:27] rightousness perverted and adultery is
[31:29] the right act perverted and a lie is the
[31:31] truth misrepresented of perversion then
[31:34] Liberty can become bondage or bondage is
[31:37] Liberty
[31:39] perverted servitude slavery is Liberty
[31:43] perverted because there are some that
[31:45] actually are choosing bondage because of
[31:48] the appearance and the promise of
[31:51] Liberty he says look at haniah a
[31:54] perversion of the original word look at
[31:56] balum a perversion of the original word
[31:58] look at zedekiah the perversion of the
[32:00] original word now hold those in mind I
[32:01] want to come to the scripture here in a
[32:02] moment and the Bible said that these
[32:04] guys would come out to pervert the
[32:06] original word word Vindicated and proved
[32:09] to be true and then he begins to refer
[32:11] to the very thing that he put in the
[32:13] Cornerstone when he founded the
[32:14] Tabernacle do the work of an evangelist
[32:16] in that corner Yonder make full proof of
[32:18] your ministry for the time will come
[32:19] when they'll not endure sound
[32:22] Doctrine so they they don't want
[32:24] Doctrine they don't want teaching the
[32:26] sound Doctrine here could be to uh
[32:29] translate to sound teaching but after
[32:32] their own lust shall Heap for themselves
[32:34] teachers having inching ears the the
[32:37] root of their Doctrine the root of their
[32:38] teaching is in their desires of the
[32:41] Flesh and listen he says and go
[32:45] ahead and do anything they want
[32:49] to so this is a means of justifying
[32:53] themselves that they'll find those that
[32:56] can teach things in such a way that
[32:58] satisfies their itch because of the lust
[33:00] of the
[33:03] Flesh and then he says and this is what
[33:06] they say it's all right we got the same
[33:08] signs and
[33:09] wonders and shall be turned from the
[33:12] truth and be brought into fables and
[33:16] dogmas in second Timothy chapter 4 when
[33:18] it refers to these fables it's a
[33:20] fiction it's an
[33:22] invention it's a
[33:24] falsehood something that's been made up
[33:29] he said look at haniah perversion of the
[33:31] original look at balum a perversion of
[33:32] the original look at zedekiah perversion
[33:34] of the original Jeremiah 18:15 then said
[33:38] the Prophet Jeremiah unto haniah the
[33:40] prophet haniah was prophesying these
[33:42] great things big things all you're going
[33:43] to enjoy this is going to be great this
[33:45] is what we should do this is wonderful
[33:47] here now
[33:48] hananiah the Lord hath not sent thee did
[33:52] I not include Jeremiah 28 well look at
[33:54] that that's a sign to stop
[33:59] the Prophet Jeremiah and haniah he now
[34:03] haniah the Lord hath not sent
[34:06] thee but thou makest this people to
[34:09] trust in a
[34:12] li while promising
[34:15] Liberty they themselves are the Servants
[34:18] of
[34:19] corruption therefore what they teach and
[34:22] what they preach is bondage
[34:24] itself because they are in the bondage
[34:26] to Corruption of the word they're a
[34:28] bondage of Corruption of the truth they
[34:30] say we love the truth they say we love
[34:32] the word they say that they if Embrace
[34:34] certain things about the word but they
[34:36] use that as a cloak of lies and
[34:40] falsities and deceptions they use it as
[34:42] a cloak that adds to and takes away
[34:45] hananiah the prophet he says the Lord
[34:47] has not sent you because you make the
[34:49] people to trust in a lie remember
[34:52] zedekiah what did he do in his great big
[34:55] display and making horns of
[34:58] and this great dramatic demonstration
[35:00] and exercise of showing that the Lord is
[35:02] with you and you'll drive them out from
[35:04] before you but zedekiah had a lying
[35:07] spirit in his
[35:10] mouth balum used his gift for personal
[35:12] gain because it made him look good and
[35:15] what did he do he used it to entice the
[35:18] people into
[35:20] idolatry and a
[35:22] festival a dancing and a Frolic and a
[35:27] feasting on the wrong things a mixing
[35:29] and a blending of idolatry with the true
[35:32] word brother bandam addresses it in the
[35:34] church a book he says they give the word
[35:36] meaning that fits their own devilish
[35:41] ends they give now apply this to the
[35:43] Bible and the message of the hour they
[35:45] give it a meeting that fits their own
[35:48] devilish
[35:49] ends their own sit sensual ends these
[35:53] alluring through the lust of the flesh
[35:55] these the wanness through the promise of
[35:59] Liberty he says they operate gifts with
[36:02] the margin of
[36:05] error and neglect the word of
[36:09] God they operate gifts with the mar go
[36:12] back and read that passage in the church
[36:15] age book I should have jotted it down
[36:17] but uh and had it and I'm not going to
[36:19] take time to go through the church age
[36:21] book that I he have in front of me but
[36:22] find this if you need it just let me
[36:24] know I'll let you I'll identify it for
[36:26] you operating guest within a margin of
[36:28] error he describes what Christendom has
[36:31] become today this charismatic
[36:32] Christianity this Noir new age
[36:36] Revelation or whatever it is where
[36:38] there's there's prophecies with a margin
[36:41] of air there's no
[36:44] accountability when men whether they do
[36:47] it in a prayer line or they do it openly
[36:49] they can prophesy things they can say
[36:51] things they can interpret tongues and be
[36:53] absolutely
[36:56] incorrect denying the word of God and
[36:59] this is the direct quote and people will
[37:01] go to them and bear with them and
[37:04] support them and believe them not
[37:06] knowing it is the way of
[37:13] death I'll invite the musicians to come
[37:16] we'll stop
[37:18] there I think it'd be better if we just
[37:20] thought about
[37:23] that I'll pick up with this maybe
[37:25] Wednesday night maybe Sunday Sunday
[37:27] morning maybe we'll just do a part two
[37:30] on this one we're addressing the LIE of
[37:34] Liberty which is cloaked behind it is
[37:38] written and we we need to know but it is
[37:42] also
[37:43] written we need to we cannot let anyone
[37:47] misrepresent the word of God to draw us
[37:51] into wanness and the lust of the
[37:54] flesh he says and people will go with
[37:57] them and bear with them and support them
[37:58] and believe them not knowing it is the
[38:02] way of death could you stand together
[38:05] with me this morning
