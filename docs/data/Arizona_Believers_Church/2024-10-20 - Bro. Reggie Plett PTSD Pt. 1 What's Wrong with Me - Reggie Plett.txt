TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Psalms 56 and we're going to read verses 1-4 David says be merciful unto me oh God for man would swallow me up he fighting daily oppresseth me my enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me oh thou most high what time I am afraid I I will trust in thee in God I will praise His word in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me amen may God add His blessings to his word you can be seated this morning um this morning I have for a title uh PTSD part one what's wrong with me and um I I'm very nervous speaking about this subject um only for the sake of uh I'm I I I never fought in the military um I'm certainly not a a a doctor I don't have any clinical expertise and so um PTSD uh is uh stands for post-traumatic stress disorder uh it's very serious and um there's varying stages of it and I know that if there's somebody who's been in the military somebody who who has been diagnosed with PTSD this is something that's very serious very very serious um and um so I I I say this I I speak about this with uh with only a varying degree of of of understanding and and I and I wouldn't want to um take lightly anybody that would have a serious condition and would understand PTSD to a a a deeper depth than what than what my understanding is but um I've titled PTSD part one what's wrong with me and the part one is not because uh I want you to come back tonight for part two or three or four um in fact I don't I I don't have in mind any other part to this so it's not that I have any other part but perhaps you do perhaps somebody else would know part two or part three or part four to this subject and the National Institute of Mental Health says that postraumatic stress disorder PTSD is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking scary or dangerous event it is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation fear is a part of the body's fight or flight response which helps us avoid or respond to potential danger people may experience a range of reactions after trauma and most people recover from initial symptoms over time those who continue to experience problems may be diagnosed with PT SD I look at this and this post traumatic stress disorder is the idea that the post part is that after somebody has experienced something that has brought on traumatic stress it's not your normal everyday stress it's not stress that you've dealt with on a regular basis that you've grown up with that hey I'm you know hey lay off of me Mom lay off of me Dad I'm stressed out this is uh this is a traumatic stress and I think we all um those that are familiar with those with this PTSD this post-traumatic stress and and those that have gone to war those soldiers who have come back and been diagnosed with PTSD we've understood that we we can understand that even though we've maybe never G and been in a war zone have never been on the Battlefront we can understand soldiers experiencing traumatic things I had a grandfather who fought in World World War II I think he was blown out of a tank he he he he he worked in a tank and he was blown out of a tank five times while in service and so I say that's just the grace of God that he would that he would live um being blown out of a tank five times um and you just hear if if you've ever spoken with a a soldier who who has come back and has has great trauma and they're uh trying to to to deal with this and and and and and many of them are on medications and many of them are going to to therapists to try to deal with the things that they've seen and um there's so many interviews that I've that I've witnessed and I remember hearing about one man who fought in Vietnam and and he wasn't that anything that he had done and and and that's the idea a lot of times people think well what did you do the idea is what did you do um while you were over there that brought this upon you and a lot of times it isn't anything that anybody has done it's something that they may have just witnessed one of the interviews that I that I had heard was this man had gone over to Vietnam and he said there was really no fighting going on for him he was on a boat and he said and some of the men that he was with were just so bored that they were taking the gun from the boat and they were just shooting at fishermen over in Vietnam just killing innocent fishermen because they they thought we're probably never going to see action and they wanted to to discharge some of some of the the bullets and things and and and he was saying I've got PTSD just from witnessing what these other men were doing and you think when you hear some of these stories they're so they're you you you just your heart just breaks for these people and it and and and so many times it uh it's not even that they while they're in the Heat of the Moment while they're in the throws of battle um they they're engaged and they don't have time for this to kick in and then it's when they come home it's when they when they're back from battle that they they begin to recognize uh something will happen a lot of times there'll be some uh it could be a loud noise or something uh a flash of light that that will trigger uh this this fear or this uh you know as as this National Institute of Health uh the just this range of emotions of trauma that that is affected by and triggered by certain things I remember seeing a video of a man who was uh I believe he served with the Nazis so he he he was in Germany and so many of those men you hear so many of those stories they they never wanted to be a Nazi they they just because they were in Germany and they were young men they they they they were enlisted to be a part of that but some of the men I remember seeing a video of one man and he was older I think he was in America I'm not sure where he was but they they they brought out his old just a helmet Ju Just a helmet that one of DSs would have been wearing and they and he's sitting in a chair and they've got his attention this way and they bring a a helmet and as soon as he sees the helmet he begins convulsing and and and weeping and and it it was enough to to trigger a memory that then set this even uh physical condition off where he's shaking and and physically crying and while I'm while we're speaking of these things and we're we're talking about soldiers who are going through this and we're talking about people who have going through this the reality for me is not that I've I've again I've never I I I never joined this service I've never fought in a in a war or or had to be see any of that on a daily basis you know I feel we're safe here in America we don't have a lot of those conditions around us to to be able to witness that the reality is that it's not just war that can bring traumatic stress to somebody and that some people's tolerance for stress levels is different than somebody else's some people can tolerate a lot more than other people and what's very what I'm very keenly aware of as as I've gotten older and and especially as you you gather with people and you fellowship with people in a in a church who have come from other churches from split churches is that I've heard more and more over the years from Believers I think I've got PTSD from what I experienced at church and as you begin to fellowship and you begin to speak with people that have gone through something like that and if you've ever experienced something like that you can enter right into their sufferings you begin to say well what what took place and and oh that's familiar oh that's familiar and that's familiar and You Begin entering right in and going oh wow I could see yeah that's I'm so sorry that sounds very stressful I'm so sorry you had to go through that in the church age book in the th tyan Church age brother brandom is reading from uh Revelations chapter 2 uh God's message to the thiyan church and in there he comes upon as brother brandham so beautifully does as he's just going through those scriptures as he's just reading through the scriptures there in Revelations 2 and 3 those those chapters dealing with the church ages he's going through those scriptures and he's taking little portions of those scriptures and he's explaining the Revelation behind those phrases that are within those scriptures and he comes upon this phrase within the thyren tier and church age I will put upon you none other burden brother brandom says uh as he quotes that the word for burden is weight or pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages was either Bend or be broken bow or die it was the Inquisition the power of the Empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in and I think those that of us that say I believe we're living in that last age and we hear brother brandom say all of these things the pressure of riches not the pressure of being rich just the pressure of riches whether you whether you're rich or or or you wish you had Rich riches that pressure is more prevalent today than ever before because of economy because of because of uh uh now we're not speaking about just one country we're talking about a whole global economy working together and those pressures then are are are are just ratcheted up for us so you can read that and go amen I know about that soft living and as Believers we understand that not well I've got it easy it's the idea of becoming uh almost that lukewarm where's our Zeal where's my Zeal for God and and and that pressure isn't uh is so so often Lord am I letting down am I letting you down and those nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in and why is it that we seem unfitted to live in it and it's because uh the the the the the rest that we experience as as Christians when we when we when we're in when we're looking into the word of God and we're talking about the things of God and when we're in this this economy in God's economy it's an economy of rest and and you you and I can experience that when we come to to church on a Sunday morning or a Wednesday night especially perhaps a Wednesday night when you're in the middle of a a work week and the pressures of the world are on you and you come to church and you go oh this is just refreshing to to to to have this the right mindset in a world that does not amen and so these these nervous tensions in this in this complex age that we're unfitted because we as Believers as Sons and Daughters of God uh we're not we was never intended for us uh uh now God certainly knew who to put in this age I believe that I believe that that that God uh for ordained you to live in this age knowing that you were the one that could withstand these these tensions this pressure in this age that you were pressurized for this day but the one thing that we're looking forward to the one thing that we that that that Lord come quickly Lord Jesus please come quickly is because this is not what we're meant to end up with is this world in the message spiritual Amnesia and I'm drawing i' I've I've drawn most of this uh this sermon from listening to these sermons like spiritual Amnesia and the demonology series the demonology physical Realms and religious Realms I just I I I just really love those messages I think brother brandom it sounds like ah demonology do I really want to get into that but brother brandom does such an a lovely job of saying hey this isn't something spooky this is something that that is very clear and should be and in in in fact at the end of that series he says I've got to go around the world again and retach this now and so um but in spir the mess is spiritual Amnesia brother brandom says now this Amnesia we're told it is a cause it it is a cause you to be able to be to a place where you cannot identify yourself now it's an unusual thing it don't happen too often but the causes is from shock it's somebody that don't even know who they are you find it from Wars sometimes soldiers get it sometimes people get it not that soldiers aren't people they are but I think he just means common folk uh another thing causes it is worry worry will cause it now brother brand going all the way into Amnesia having Amnesia now Amnesia is is is is to another level of of of just being um of having an overloaded stress level Amnesia to the place to where well I think we all know what amnesia is maybe for the young children Amnesia where when when when they can't remember who they are or or events around them but I think what what brother brandham is alluding to here is that shock from war can get so bad that this PTSD can get to such a place it can bring on Amnesia now what's amazing is if you go and listen to this message spiritual Amnesia brother brandom said this was in a time of prosperity that that this was happening in the time of prosperity that Israel forgot God and by forgetting God they then begin to forget who they were and as brother brandom is going through that sermon he's saying let us as Believers not forget who we are let's not forget what we're identified with who we're identified with that when we not just look at our family history and say boy I'm not real proud of that but that's not the lineage we want to look to we want to look to that Hebrews 11 those Heroes of Faith to know that that though I may not physically have ever come from the lineage of Abraham by faith I am a son of Abraham that I believe that that same faith that Abraham had for some reason or another God saw fit to put that kind of faith in me to hear the word of God and say I believe that I believe that's true and so then when when the word of God comes fresh and it comes in a day when when when it seems that the ministers or the experts would say something to contradict the Simplicity of the Gospel would maybe say something like well I don't know that God does things quite like that anymore we say whoa that doesn't quite ring true to me I believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and so we say no I believe that God does still heal and and they say yeah but this is stage four of this you say well I don't know it doesn't matter to me which stage 1 2 3 4 five or whatever the stages are I know God can heal and do the impossible and when we begin to uh recognize not only only uh uh who God is uh but what God has done and then it begins to help us it builds our faith to say okay are you a part of that and if you say well and and believe me I know this I do know this that one of the tactics of the enemy is that Amnesia uh the whole purpose of brother random goes into it when they would capture the children of Israel and haul them off to Babylon they would change their names they would change their identities so that they would forget everything that they knew they were and and and take on a new identity and that identity was to lessen the individual and was to cause them to lose faith in the true and living God one of the things that can cause it is worry we'll get back to that message in the message standing in the Gap brother brandham if you ever listen to that message standing in the Gap brother brandham gets very real says how that his intentions were to run off into the Wilderness he would come out whenever he would want to give a message like one of those Old Testament prophets and then he would go back into the wilderness God said no I've called you to a higher order than that brother brandom said he began to build a complex he had begin to build a complex and the reason he built a complex you say well why would he build a complex he couldn't he rise above that well then you begin to look at the pressures that were put on him as a man you say man I couldn't blame him I I'd been done way before but he says here I'd been preaching for years years and I become an old man and an old veteran preacher and had a lot of hard battles and maybe I'm scarred all cut up on the inside from fights because my lot that the lord gave me was not back to kiss the babies and to marry the young and bury the old but it was to hold a two-handed sword at the Battlefront against the Ws of paganism and demonology and the powers of darkness and fight with it fight it with the word of God till I seen the defeated I've been cut deep many times so brother brandom is is is he he's giving us a window into his own life that by me taking on but uh being called to the position I was called to I I've been cut many times you hear brother Brandon many times on many of sermon say oh my you think oh if only I could see a vision in that sort of thing and he says but you don't know what it's like when somebody comes up to you and says oh how I love you and you know better because of that Discerning gift how'd you like that to be able to after service everybody you're shaking hands with you can just see they love you they don't they they don't they don't they don't they don't they don't they don't you're like wow there's so many more that don't again in spiritual Amnesia he says God's word Vindicated proofed I don't want to just read over that that this is a tremendous statement God's word Vindicated proved that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just the same as it ever was on the day of Pentecost or any other time right amen and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and your attitude towards that identifies whether you have spiritual Amnesia or not that's right no matter whether if you're a deacon or even if you're a preacher it doesn't yeah they get it too so we find out it's contagious and it hits the whole thing you mean to tell me that PTSD our deacons are are able to get that or a minister is able to have that to the place to all the way to the place where they begin to forget they get spiritual Amnesia and things begin to get cloudy and they don't even know who they are or what they believe anymore yes I think if we were to go home with each other we were to sit down and begin to talk about our past our stories there'd be they'd go right down this alley now PTSD is postraumatic stress disorder calling it a disorder but I didn't title this PTSD for the sake of looking into post-traumatic stress disorder but rather post-traumatic stress Deliverance I don't think brother Brandon was preaching spiritual Amnesia just to to point out that well you've got it and you've got it and you've got it and you're going I know I know you know and and if we were all real and say hey how many have' gotten to that kind of place to where you forgot who you are as a child of God that you forgot that you were a son or a daughter of God and and and and and and when the hands begin to go up and they're and they're you know and we're getting right down to the nitty-gritty and God is you know is is is here as a discerner and he's searching your heart and saying do you know this to be true and you're like I know I know I know so what so what I've got it so I've got it the point is there is deliverance and this is the thing I'm going to I'll share something with you it's very personal but I'm going to share it with you uh I feel like I've always been fairly light-hearted I feel like uh from a young child uh I it was just I don't know I I I guess I could always see the glass more than half full always even if it was only half full it was like nah we can put a little more in it and it'll be more than half full you know was just always light-hearted so I never uh that that state of uh we had a good home you know I was raised you know in in a church that believed the message of the hour so I so again my my I wasn't in a volatile home nothing like that it was very very good very good home and so um for me to be able to to to joke and to be light-hearted um wasn't wasn't something that came from Deep wounds that you you you you find a lot of people do they use that as that that that wasn't me it wasn't me so then as I got older and I became an adult and I you begin to meet people who who uh who've had anxiety attacks and and P panic attacks and those things it's very easy the the thought ah is very easy to come by now you don't I'm not saying that I I held on to this but it's very easy to say that's it's in their head it's all in their head that's just a kind of a statement that's in their head and then if you've ever experienced it you realize no no this is much more this this is much more and I can remember the first time uh uh that I ever had uh an overload of anxiety and I guess you would call it an anxiety attack or a panic attack and and it was this microcosm of a million things and you would say well what was the thing what was what was the one traumatic thing that took you to that place and it wasn't there wasn't one I couldn't I couldn't say that this one thing happened it was a million little things it was just multiple things stacking up just stack stack stack and your your mind begins to go into overload because you can't process each of those things there's so many things that have got to get knocked off the list that you can't handle you you just don't know even where know where to start it's just I can't stop I can't shut this off and it begins to this is where then worry comes in you begin to worry about it or and then and then that that worry doesn't help anything and it just accumulates and I can remember um it it was um thankfully I you know I had a loving wife and she said you know come home and and uh you know we'll take care of you or whatever and so you go into the room and there's this idea you know that um when when you see somebody like that going through something like that words don't uh they don't really have much of an effect human words so somebody could say to you right Point Blank while you're going through it uh I'm here for you and you know they are you absolutely genuinely know they're there for you but in the moment it's not helping you at all not doing anything they say um it's going to it's all going to be okay and and you're like yeah yeah you know I think I'm an adult enough and smart enough and and and I've been walking this way long enough to believe like you know I think as as it was that Jesus when Lazarus died and he said you know he's going to live and she's like I know Lord in the resurrection and he's like no no no no no no you don't understand what's about to happen and she didn't she didn't understand that but that's the idea is that it's it's all going to be okay and you're like I know ultimately it's all going to be okay I've you know I've sealed that in my heart I'm you know eternally sealed you know like if I die I'm in a better place anyway you know so so then the idea like it's all going to be okay it's all going to work out you're like yeah ultimately I know that but right now it's not and so that's when you need something Supernatural something beyond the natural and the world doesn't know where to go for that right they they don't know they they don't know that peace that passes all understanding what they know is you know there's a there is there a pill for this you know is there a is there a medical fix for this CU I trust the doctors I trust the science and you're like well that's good at least you got trust in something that's good but as Believers it's look that's a temporary like I'll take them I'll take you know I'm certainly not afraid to take what a doctor would prescribe but I know ultimately I'm going to need something Supernatural Amen to take care of me in this moment and so I I I made it home and and I'm in the room and and I'm and I'm praying and just praying to God I know where to go to I know where the I know where the source is the source of life I know where help my help comes from I know that and and you know that well you're going through it cuz you're crying out please Lord Jesus help me through this right now please God help me through this while I'm laying there and I'm praying to God I hear something say I've got it all under control and that was it that was enough for me it was the first time I'd ever experienced it and that was enough for me me it it was it was what I needed and it's that idea of God taking you and wrapping you in his arms amen and pulling you in and saying I've got you and you're thinking I'm going to fall and he's like nope I've got you he say I'm going to fall apart and he's like uh-uh because I've got you and that that's the idea that's what you need that's that's what you need and and and many of times that's we that that's why we need each other right so I could say you know to my my darling wife you know please wrap your arms around me and hold me during this time and that is that is so nice but ultimately when it's not it's it's not a physical thing it's your soul it's something inside of you that needs to be held together you need somebody who can do that who is the Unseen that can go to the Unseen and hold it together and that is when we know we need the Supernatural and that is why this subject this morning is not PTSD the subject this morning is Divine Healing that's the subject the subject of of of the title spiritual Amnesia is not about Amnesia it's about div Divine Healing from Amnesia it's that Divine Healing and the the the whole purpose of listening to the of these to these sermons like demonology is not to go oh there's demons out there it's to know that yes there's demons out there but there is a God who is above those demons who is greater than those demons so in Psalms 103 1-3 these are the scriptures brother brandom uses as his text for that demonology uh Physical Realm anyway bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases now you can say diseases you can say disorders whatever you want to call it he's a Healer of all of that he is the Healer of all of that and if you've ever gone and had this post traumatic stress in your life he's a Healer he can heal it amen not just a remedy for you know this will this will get you by for the week no he can heal it heal it amen hallu now brother brandom says in demonology Physical Realm now the first thing what a demon is you hear so many people talking about a demon well now a demon devil all comes from one word and in the English it's called Tormentor and so many of our brothers little brothers and sisters that that's what they would call their other brother or sister who's just tormenting them all the time but we just don't allow him to say that we just don't let him call each other demon or or devil but it's a Tormentor it's something that would that's just tormenting you tormenting you tormenting you it's a demon a fellow that torments is a devil a evil one he say now the Bible today uh is is to most to many people is some old back book that Grandpa and Grandma read or something like that there's not much to it it's for the old folks and so forth but that's wrong it's for everybody and demons are tormentors that torment us now all sickness as he goes down a little further now all sickness we have to find first that all sickness came from the devil God is not the author of sickness no sickness comes from God God sometimes perit Satan to put sickness on you as a whip to bring you back to the house of God now that's not God's whip remember that's Satan Satan holds the whip God allows Satan with that whip to bring you back to the house of God when you've disobeyed but sickness in its beginning come from the devil could you imagine a person would believe that God our heavenly father would be the author of such a thing as sickness and death well no he isn't never was never will be God permits death because of Disobedience God permits death as one writer said all that death can do God harnessed it to a buggy and it pulls Us in the presence of God a Believer but the word death means separation so now we understand this that that this thing uh it's it it's it's an [Applause] awareness this PTSD now we we're just have an awareness now we're catching an awareness that this is a Tormentor this is something that is tormenting me this is not of God this is something that is tormenting me now uh I will say this many times we we you know again in the title it there is what's wrong with me what's wrong with me and so we' you know I'd love to stand up here and say it's not you it's somebody else it's nothing you did but many times it is PTSD many times is caused by something somebody did themselves it isn't always something they witnessed many of times it's something they did and then there's this realization I can't believe that I had that within me to do that and when that happens it raises this thing within you that who am I what am I capable of doing and this awareness triggers this this nervousness and this uh this disorder this is why brother brandom so many times people would come through the prayer lines and he would say you know what is it that you're what is it that you're wanting and he says oh I see you've got something in your life you need to go make that right you need to go take care of that and he and and and and many of times when when when brother Brandon would hold these meetings uh many of those meetings were based upon uh you know they would send out flyers they would put it in the newspaper Divine healer Coming To Town come and bring your sick and so people were just grabbing people from hospitals it's not they weren't all going to Church they just knew someone who was sick and they wanted hey if there's something to this hey let's let's go the doctors sure haven't seen to help it wasn't based upon well we believe the word of God oh I know the Bible no many of times none of them had ever picked up a Bible in their lives and so brother Brandon would start these meetings and he said now by the end of the week now we're going to have a prayer line but he would start the meetings with services to say let's make sure your soul is right if we can take care of that it will take care of all of the rest the healing part yes you want your body to be healed you want this infirmity to go away I believe I want the same thing for you but it could come again you'll probably get sick again and you might get sick with something worse you might get something that's that that you know this time you know you've just got an abscessed tooth or or you've got something you might later in life have a tumor you might L later in life have cancer you might later in whatever it would be but one things for certain if we can get that Soul sealed then it then the the the the ultimate thing is taken care of so you got to clear out the channel why say there's a kink in the hose and you got to you got to get those you got to get that kink out of the hose you know you say oh God help me God help me God help me you know I need this I need this I need this and it's like well unkink the hose and let it flow you know God it it'll flow but if you're kinking the hose let go of the hoe quit quit kinking the hose I want God to flow I want God to flow brother brandom help me what's wrong with me he says well you know I okay hold on because of this gift that God has given me I see something in your life where you were dishonest with your husband you need and don't you dare say a word about that he's like well we can't really go any further but I made that right with God but the problem was it between you and God the the Kink was in this other home is is in your home life here that's where the king's well to ease her mind I guess maybe well just so you know he's got the same thing to confess to you what when then they work that out and praise God you you you read the end of the story and they you know both coming and confessing you were right we're so sorry and then you know these others taken care of now in Matthew 11 11: 28 Jesus's words he says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest brother brand does such a nice job of laying that scripture out and letting us know that that rest the word there is Sabbath and that that same Sabbath that that word rest was not um just oh okay take the load off and I'll kick back for for the rest of time now but the idea was that brother brandom set before us was this same word is the word that's used in the beginning that after God had made the the the heavens and the Earth and light and darkness and and and all the animal life and he made man on the seventh day God rested Sabbath he rested from his works and here brother Brandon begins to demonstrate to us that it's you this rest that Jesus is promising is that baptism is that new birth and he's saying it's you resting from your works you trying to do it you trying to putting up basically doing what Adam and Eve had done by creating their own covering with fig leaves it's like do away with that there's something better that God has already provided there's a lamb skin God has already provided that you don't have to work anything up God has already provided and I'm so thankful because when when we can when we apply this idea of this worry this anxiety this this this this traumatic stress that we've got from for whatever reasons for whatever reasons we can rest we can we can not only is it that he's he's got me under control you're like I've got it under control and and and you're going I know you do but saying then I'm not in control I'm going to take my hands off and not try to be in control now okay let's hurry up I think we can get through these I've got multiple uh to me one of the most tremendous things that we have access to today is that this message has been recorded so we can we can hear it and um I I can remember there was a uh a friend of mine who was having severe anxiety attacks severe yeah had to he had to have people come and stay with him and um he would get hot and he would need the fan and then he would have to turn the fan off because just the air on his skin bothered him and it would trigger this it was just severe you just you just couldn't believe uh how severe it was and I was ministering one time and and I was just expressing some things to uh over the pulpit and and he came up to me afterwards and he and he just said man thank you so much you have no idea how much that that that helped me and he said you know what what what do you what would help you know what is what is the thing that would that would really help and I said listen I don't know about you but I know for me that when I put a tape on if I hear the words good evening friends it's soothing not the wor words not the order of the words but the feeling that's behind it and when I hear words like I'm only here to help ease the suffering of mankind that's all my purpose here is is if I can help ease the suffering of mankind you have to when you hear that either say I believe that he really means that or you say ah those are just words that he's using to pass time in an opening of a sermon to get through that's not true right it's not true if if if you're listening to the tape and you're listening and you hear brother brandom say all I want to do is help ease the suffering of man kind it's like oh thank you Lord amen so I said you know if you hear something like that go and listen to tapes where brother brand expresses things like that that and then I said and then I said if you're struggling you know you know somebody's telling you you know well you got to you should hear this sermon and then you should hear this sermon you're like I mean have you ever I I love it when it's like you want to hear a good tape you're like well which one's the bad one you know like which one are you going to tell me like ah don't listen to this one it's no good yeah I mean I we always do that right like I just heard a really good tape you're G to love this and you're like of course I'm going to love it love them all but I said look if you if if you're struggling with that I said man just put on any of them I said and go to the last 20 minutes just just if you don't if you're like I can't pay attention fine just go to the last 20 minutes just just forward all the way to the prayer line go all the way to the end to the prayer line and when you get done with that go to the next one and just go to the prayer line don't listen Ser just go right to the prayer line at the very end and when you can hear the care of somebody who surrendered go to God that says now I'm just waiting on him you know what I'm doing I'm just waiting on him now then he begins to discern and and the things you hear in those prayer lines you're just like no way that oh I see oh you've got a sister you know you've got there's a handkerchief in your purse and you're just like it amazes you every time and You Begin listening to those prayer lines and you're just you get through some of those and I mean by the end of it it's like you're ready to go into the ring you know you're just like oh yeah bring on any devil at this point you know like I could take on any devil right now cuz it encourages you so much that there's nothing God can't heal I'm just so shocked every time I listen I go oh and then no way God healed that you know you're listening to tumors and Cat and eyes and ears and Limbs and you're just you're just so I thought that we would go through a few of those and so I put them in order I I I only grabbed a few CU there's so many but I only grabbed a few and I started in 1953 is the earliest I started and and you if you look at the dates you'll see that we're just going to go right through we're just going to go right down the line right right in order Through The Years brother brandom in the 20th century Prophet 1953 he says excuse me sister I have to relax my mind once in a while now we'll be strangers I see that you're strictly a stranger to me you're from away from here you've come from another city you've got a lot of trouble on your heart and you got heart trouble to begin with is that right there's a whole lot of Blackness I see a black sheep keep following you like that oh it's a lie somebody's told a lie on you that was a man was professing Divine Healing he said you as a witch is that true and you got a whole stir in your church or something another about it isn't that right your pastor's sick right now now he's got polio is that right sister don't pay no attention to what them people tell you they're a lying and the only thing's wrong with your heart is that nervous condition got your heart worked up go on home in peace and God bless you you're all right God bless you you're not a witch you don't have a heart condition it's nervousness 1953 faith without works is dead you believe with all your heart when you like to eat a great big hamburger about that thick tonight go do it then and the stomach now what's done that you're nervous you see it's nothing wrong they told you had ulcer but that's wrong it it isn't nothing but a peptic condition of the stomach you know that sours and cause all that trouble and burning around now it's left you go on eat what you want to expectancy now will you bring the next patient please come this way lady believe with all your heart do you believe with all your heart believe that God makes you will make you well if I believe if I be his servant I can't heal you but I can by the help of God know what's wrong with you you've had a heart trouble for a long time it's caused from a nervous condition cause you to have cuz you have a nervous heart when you lay down at night you smother so much especially after eating it creates a gas in your stomach that pushes it up it's really not a heart trouble you think it is but it's a nervous condition that's come on for a long time been there since menopause started way back in a young woman is that the truth that's the truth never seen you in my life well then if God knows what your life is doesn't he know what it will be do you accept him now as your healer then it won't bother you no more it'll leave you go in the name of Jesus Christ I bless you for your healing again 1953 how the angel came came to me all right come lady you're a very deep thinker you're sincere in it with all your heart but it's caused you to be a nervous person and you're very nervous you're always taking other people's things and thinking about that Crossing Bridges before you get to it building things that never happen in that it's developed a stomach trouble for you isn't that right all right you believe me now as his Prophet then if you'll go off here tonight and say Lord Jesus I accept your vicarious suffering for me I accept your healing for me at Calvary I'm going to eat what I want to and tell the devil I'm Free Will you believe that then go do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen 1954 do you now believe you have a nervous condition cause you to feel real gloomy in the afternoon I see you again turning away from a table you've got a ulcer in your stomach is that right you did have you haven't now go home and be made well in the name of Jesus Christ I some of this is amazing it caused you to be real gloomy in the afternoon uh you know many of times if you ever had anxiety and anxiety attacks it's like the middle of the night it's it's it's in the the middle of the night you know you're waking up 1:00 in the morning 2:00 in the morning you're shook up and you're like why couldn't this happen at noon today you know like I'm trying to sleep but but this is happening but it's just interesting it's this nervousness it's this thing that's inside of you it's this nervousness it's nervousness and this is what what where you just see this over and over and over 1955 proof of his resurrection then if he is raised from the dead and he's standing here this morning and this anointing that I have now isn't mine but it's his the you couldn't hide your life if you had to because we're in contact with one another by spirit being if God can reveal to me what you're standing therefore will you accept it with all your heart you you will you will do it you're suffering with a stomach trouble that's exactly and the reason of it is because that you're it's caused from a nervous condition and it's not a nervous outward shaking nervous I see you're a deep thinker you're always planning something Crossing Bridges before you ever get to them you make things that never does come to pass and you've been told that before that's right but it don't do them any good to tell you because but now it will because you're healed you're going home a well man Jesus Christ has made you whole that's what I was talking about other people have told you you've got this but it don't do you any good and you're like yeah I know being in that presence hearing the word of God I think about the scriptures that we read in opening this morning in Psalms 56 be merciful unto me oh God for man would swallow me up and it's not some man out there it's this man the my my my complexes my nerves it will swallow me up he's fighting daily oppresseth me my enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me that's that that's that little multiple microcosms that are happening it's not it's like well what's the thing that's wrong with you and you're like the thing let start I got this this this this this this and it's just a stack of things and my enemies would daily swallow be me up for they be many that fight against me oh thou most high but what time I am afraid I will trust in thee in God I will praise His word why will you praise his word because it's true he doesn't lie he'll keep it he's faithful I'm closing with this I believe brother Aaron has used this quote before it's uh it's in the questions and an Series in there in 1964 and I love those I I I try to encourage many of the young people uh go to all the questions and anwers series and I say and in between the questions pause it and try to answer the question yourself so when you hear a question then stop then stop it don't go on and you try to answer the question the way you think the answer is even as scholarly as you've been through Sunday school and all of that you try to answer the way you think the answer is going to go and then go ahead and play it and you just God never ceases to AIT me how perfect how perfect it is but this is from 1964 the questions and answer is number two you will you will recognize this I know you will question 290 question brother brandom what shall we do something has settled over me that I cannot break through last fall I dreamed I was lost in white sand it was getting dark I couldn't find my way this dream has stayed with me since last last fall now I am as one groping in darkness my son Irvin and wife were included in my dream now they're also in darkness we're in desper we're in desperation I believe God will show you what is uh in our hearts now Mrs oh all right if we're wrong or sinning places tell us we want to be right okay so we'll stop there here's this question I had this dream it shook me up and and it included my son and his wife and now we're all shook up because of this dream that we're in White Sands and we're lost this is the question what's wrong with us brother brandom we just believe that you'll have the answer so you stop the tape and you're like okay now I'm going to diagnose this myself so brother brandom says I I don't know the lady but I just feel if you're here lady that here is your trouble you've let something happen to you that's made you nervous because being in White Sands represents Purity and righteous and you're just letting Satan put one over on you your dream proved that there's nothing wrong you're only nervous and by doing this and thinking this you're making the rest of your family nervous stop doing it claim your god-given rights your dream proves by the interpretation that you are in white sand everything's all right it's you yourself nervous and you let one member of the family get nervous it goes to the next member and the next member and the first thing you're all fussing and going on and one one member of the family gets kind of upset about something it it upsets the other and the other and the other the first thing you know the whole family's upset it's Satan then if one member of the family rejoices let the rest of them Rejoice with it so everyone of the family try to do that try each one of you children to help your papa mama mama you papa you try to help the children don't let that gloomy unbelieving Spirit get around you you are Christians you are borned of the spirit of God you're the salt of the earth you have god-given rights and the Bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things don't think about the wrong thing I remember when brother brother Aaron had read that in a in one of his sermons and it just hit I mean it just hit it was like that's so true that is so true on on so many levels that it just goes from one to the next and and and when you see it in your own home when you're when you're when you're witnessing uh a little bit of an argument or just volume getting raised or something and then all of a sudden somebody else is raising the volume and then some all of a sudden things just begin happening in your and you're like what is happening right now this is so strange this is what's happening it's Satan and he's allowing this nervousness to be built up and this nervousness can cause and he says don't do that don't do that and children help help in the house you help one another and and Mama you help and papa okay Papa help with the kids help with the kids Papa don't let these fusses and things like that happen brother brandom is giving this this practical advice and and and and and and to give this relief of this white sand is Purity it's righteousness you're a Christian you're a son and daughter of God and to me and musicians you can come is it musicians or musician today it's musicians I think I think we have musicians today you can come I'm I'm just finishing up but this question that we ask and many times if you're if you're going through this if you've ever had this in your life this anxiety this PTSD what whatever you want to whatever you want to say that has been one of the questions that is just so it just comes out it's what's wrong with me what is wrong with me could you know I'm a Christian I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I you you've search you search your heart and you say God is if there's if there be any wickedness in me take it from me Lord try my Reigns you as a Christian you're you're your desires are right you're already going down that road and then a Tormentor comes along and he tormenting you and he'd love to get you to think that perhaps it's something spiritual and if it is as Christians we get that right we clear that up but this is why brother Brandon in he preaches the demonology Physical Realm and demonology religious realm he's saying No this this may not be uh something that is a a spiritual warfare this is just could be just a physical tormenting this could just be a physical tormenting in your life now Satan would like to take it from there to bring your faith down to to cause you to forget who God is to forget what he's done what he's doing and what he can [Music] do Divine Healing didn't go away in 1965 God to him the promises to him that believes places where brother brandom says you're the one that's got the Divine Healing it's your faith that operates that it's your faith I could pray for you he says I could pray for you for hours and hours and hours and if you don't believe it it won't do you any good [Music] there's things that come upon us that happen in our life that you're not in control of I'm not in control of they come across your way and you're a real victim and then there's so many things in life that I bring on myself true there's so sometimes that nervous tension that nervousness and that upset and that that uh chaos begins to build in the home because of me and when I hear brother brandom say something like this to somebody who's very concerned about this dream and very concerned about their self and concerned about their family not knowing what it is but just hoping and believing that brother brandham somebody like brother brandham can help them and ultimately I believe this this sister knew brother brand can you put me in connection with God who is the one who will help me I I think she believed that but she wanted that can you put me in contact can you can you put us together brother Brandon with that gift is putting them in connection with that gift in his life and [Music] saying this is you this this one's on you this is your nervousness that's causing this but he doesn't lever with it's just your fault he gives her the Cure he he takes her to me Moses's medicine bag I'm the Lord that heals all thy diseases and he says the scripture tells us think on these things whatsoever what whatsoever is pure whatsoever is honest begin to think on these things let let let that begin to fill your home let that begin to fill your mind and your heart and your walk and that just that right there is enough to take care of nervousness [Music] so I want to encourage you today if if if I'm speaking to anybody who said I believe I've had PTSD I believe maybe you're say I've got PTSD I I I think I've got some real trauma in my life and it's caused this stress and I'm having to deal with it you don't have I know I know I know the idea is I have to deal with this that's right but do it like Phillip to Nathaniel come and is there anybody is there anybody that is there anybody in Nazareth come and see there's somebody there's somebody who can take care of this am there's somebody who who can take this thing away who can heal it I if you ever ever dealt with this it's not it'll come around again it'll poke it set up again it it it it's it wants to raise again but God says come let's hold my hand let's walk together I've got you I've got this under control and I want I just want whoever would hear this to have that Assurance in your heart that there's Divine Healing for this there's healing for it let's stand and pray together just if we bow our heads and as you're just in your own way be silently in your heart or however you'd like you begin to enter into prayer you begin to talk to the Healer you begin to examine your life and and May maybe you're holding somebody else on your heart maybe you're thinking about somebody else or maybe it's you and and and and you've experienced some of this and and you begin to talk to him and let him talk back to you and let him I pray that it's in places like this even in song services like this whether it be before after the service that that brother brandom talks about Divine Healing coming through music coming through love through so many different Avenues there being Divine Healing so many times it is just a song service it's just the worship just letting the spirit of God pour over you as you're in prayer just God is just ministering to your heart and he's clearing the Avenues and he's going into each of the rooms and you're just walking with him and maybe there's something you say oh I went in this room and I didn't realize I I need to clear this I got I need to get this taken care of well he'll give us that opportunity and I want to pray with you and I want to agree with you maybe you'll leave this place and you'll you'll say I I've never experienced that it's just never been in my life it's never been an issue but I pray that if somebody enters your life that that has or that will that you'll be able to take them to the word that you'll be able to just maybe enter in with them in prayer and allow that Supernatural to come into their life to tell them not you to let God Tell them I've got this under control and to heal this let's pray together precious Heavenly Father Lord I'm so thankful that your word says that you heal all of our diseases that you forgive all our iniquities that God when you do do it you do it all it there's nothing that's left my God you take care of it Lord that there is Deliverance and God I'm praying now just as a brother that Lord you'd be with my brothers and my sisters here Lord all those that would hear these words or even just consider these thoughts that God it would just together we would be encouraged that God you're still a Healer Lord you would just encourage us make maybe we just gone through the battle and it's been so long and it's been so vigorous and you just think is there ever a light of day and Lord I can remember how brother brandom said we have those Seasons where it seems like when it rains it pours but that Lord he didn't leave it there Lord he encouraged us to know that there's a Daybreak God there is a Daybreak it can't always be night that there is a light that comes and Lord only you can bring that for individuals Lord we can encourage one another we can do our very best we can pray with one another and you told us that that's what we ought to do and so we will do that but Lord ultimately it's you we relying upon you and our faith is in you when we trust we put our trust in you and God it's it's not an idea and it isn't a a painted fire lord it's real we've experienced it this is something that we know that we're sure of God I may not be an expert on PTSD I may not have be able to enter in with a soldier somebody who's gone through that but God one thing that I know is that my redeemer lives and God that that that you're a Healer I know you to be a Healer I've I've seen you to be a Healer I've experienced you to be a Healer and Lord all the other things that you are to us God we could just Proclaim it today as Sons and Daughters what you are to us you're everything that is good to us you're all of that so God I'm I'm asking Lord for for this body and Lord for those that know of other bodies or or just Believers individuals that have suffered oh God thank you thank you for easing our suffering in Lord we trust you and we're going to we're going to rely upon that God as we begin to talk with one another Lord as Sons and Daughters of God and encourage one another Lord help us Lord not to just reminisce upon negative things just uh just to uh Lord just for conversation or to bring some uh to bring it back up but God help us to think on those things that you told us to think on things that are pure things that are honest things that are true and just to be able to change an atmosphere God that when then when an atmosphere seems to be closing in and seems to be bringing up anxiety or or or or or would would only point us down a dark alley God help us to have the power to create a new world by by bringing an atmosphere that God would be pleasing to you that you could come in and Lord you could bright in a room that God you could come in and Lord that that for one soul that would be downtrodden that God you would be there to lift them up help us Lord to do that we ask these things Lord and bless each one as we separate Lord and and even as we stick around Lord this afternoon if we just want to Worship You Lord would you come and and begin to to pour in the oil and the wine Lord to minister to the needs to be the great physician God to give somebody who's got real pain give them that opium from the lily of the valley to ease their pain Lord when we go home this afternoon until we could come back together as a body I pray that you'd go home with us that Lord this would not just end here this afternoon but it would continue to minister through the week through the month through this year Grant a Heavenly Father we ask it in Jesus name amen
