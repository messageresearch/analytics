TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ruth chapter 1 verses 19 to 22. so they too went and this is ruth and naomi and i understand a little bit of the back story maybe ourselves having read it many times so they went they too went until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty half dealt very bitterly with me i went out full and the lord had brought me home again empty why then call you me naomi seeing the lord have testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me so naomi returned and ruth the moabitess her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest amen you may be seated just to make a few comments here at the outset in terms of what what my title is we've been speaking on being hungry and hungry and hungering and thirsting after the things of god and him quenching our thirst and different aspects and elements of being hungry and i've been struck by the statement inspired by the statement how that brother brown teaches us that in the rapture message that the shout is a message he's very clear about it's a message it's the message it's a messenger and he uses the phrase it's the living bread of life bringing forth the bride and so i've been pondering the bread of life the living bread of life and i've been studying in the book of ruth and have a real desire to look at some specific things in the book of ruth as it provides many wonderful types that help us understand what's transpiring in the time that we're living in even help us to understand how our lives have unfolded um in the message and so i'm starting with the bread of life and i think there'll be a few parts in this at least and maybe a couple parts on come to bethlehem and that come to bethlehem is more of an invitation and a welcoming to come to bethlehem and as we read it mentioned a couple times here in ruth and hopefully we'll have time to touch on it a little bit at the end how her and naomi came to bethlehem and they came to bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest now if you'll take your bibles i'd like to begin with revelations chapter 3 verse 20 and we've pointed out this scripture a few times already in the last few services so i feel that we can just jump right into this and begin with this we understand the condition of laodicea and how they tout themselves as being well furnished and well supplied and not neces not needing anything and having no necessities that we're lacking but then the lord himself judging their condition and saying that they're actually poor and blind and they're miserable and wretched and naked and they don't know the condition that they're in he's giving them counsel of what they can do to remedy their situation and this verse here to me is very important for us to understand as message believers he says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me it's important for us to see what this verse represents when we look at laodicea there's a lot of scriptures that we look at and we can become very familiar with and we feel that we've understood them we've placed them and we under we can identify just exactly how the spirit is speaking to the condition of the age how the spirit is speaking how that they can repent even how the lord speaks in terms of to the overcomer i'll grant to sit with me in my throne there's a lot of elements that we understand but this verse is very important for us to understand what it represents because it signals a change in dispensations and as you reading through each church age you see a compliment you see it admonishment and you see these different things that god is dealing with in the church ages there's a messenger a message to the angel of laodicea but this pronouncement behold i stand at the door knock if any men hear my voice there's nothing like this in any other age and it come in at the end of the seventh age it has a very special significance because there's a change in dispensations and we hear the phrase a lot dispensation and i think the question's even been asked of me different times in the past or i've actually seen it submitted and questioned and answers what does dispensation mean and i think it's easy for us to think oh well dispensation is a time period but there really there's really a greater significance to it than just a time period in the scriptures to use the phrase dispensation speaks of a a god's ordering or divine ordering of worldly affairs god's setting in order worldly events and events that take place i can even be spoken of a dispensation could be god's ordering an arrangement of someone's life so a dispensation scripturally if we it's something that god does it's something of god's doing it's it's a a plan of management or it's a particular administration so for changing dispensations then god is ordering things differently or there's a different kind of administration as we know that there's uh there's a gift there's one spirit but there's different administrations of that same spirit it speaks to the same thing and in the rapture message brother branham says we are changing dispensations we're at a corner so if we know that we're coming to the end of the church ages we know that we're coming to the end of time then you have to recognize something shifting something's changing and that there's come a time of changing there's a transition that's taking place and you could say the same thing in uh in egypt at the time of the exodus that here they had been slaves for hundreds of years but at the time that god is now going to lead them out when that process begins you could say well there's been a change in dispensation because the events that are taking place today are not to further our enslavement or to prepare us to hold on and and sojourn in egypt for another 100 years but there's events taking place that are going to lead to our exodus out of egypt and in a journey that ought to have ended very quickly into the promised land there was an exodus out of egypt into the wilderness and that was a change of administration change of a dispensation and so we've entered into if we're it at a time where we're turning a corner there's been a change in dispensations we've entered into a distinct time where god administers his word or administers a particular word brings prophecy to past in order to fulfill a specific purpose just as prophecies were coming to pass at the time of the exodus and moses was coming and there were signs and wonders that were given that was because now god was working to bring them out not to keep them enslaved but now he's working to bring them out so god we've entered a time where god is going to administer or bring his word to pass in order to fulfill a specific purpose in this season that we're living and so god we can read this to understand if there's a change in dispensation god is going to develop his purpose and reveal himself to man in a different way he's going to unfold his purpose reveal himself to man in a different method or a different way that's what it means it's the same god it's the same word but now he's coming in a particular way to fulfill a particular promise if we just looked at and this is where i think instead of just looking at dispensation as a time period but looking at in relation to god and how he's revealed himself and the purpose that he has in in in your life and the purpose that he would have with his church uh this word dispensation if we just looked at it in our english language it means the act of dispensing or dealing out so if a dispensation actually has the idea of dispensing or handing out or giving out it means to disperse or administer or distribute and in the scripture the greek word that's translated to dispensation it means management of a household it's actually translated also to stewards and this was kind of my inspiration that eve i think even began me kind of looking in this area how that we are to be as paul claimed himself to be a steward of the mysteries we are stewards of the mysteries and to be a steward of the mystery i think sometimes maybe this was just my own fault so if as i share this you go silly silly brother aaron for thinking that but um it was almost as if you're a guardian of the mystery we're stewards so we're we're keepers of it we're protectors and we kind of had this image of one standing at the door trying to keep people out right we're protectors of the mysteries and we're stewards of the mystery so i ruled this house i i'm governed in this house i'm a protector of the flock and i have to watch out and i have to do these things but to be a steward of the mystery is it's a dispensation so you have a not only is it just a government over it but it's not to protect it but it's to distribute it you're a student of the ministry in order to dispense it to god's people and to share it with the people so that they can be beneficiaries of it so in the in the greek to be to have a dispensation it's the administration of a property it's the management of a household and the greek word that's used okonomiya is actually the word we get in our english economy from so so now i want you to start thinking about this because i think this is just beautiful when you begin to think about an economy and how a stewardship or an economy or a dispensation the economy is just the the careful management of resources and how resources are distributed earth how things are produced and how those things are good and services are exchanged so an economy is the wealth and resources the goods and services of a particular country or region so now if god is talking about a dispensation for his church it's not just a time period but it has to speak of a particular government a word that is governing a prophecy that has been fulfilled a divine order that is settling upon his people and it speaks of an economy so i like to think of it this way god has changed the economic conditions for his bride he's changed the economic conditions of his people and so whereas the economy would relate to the production and consumption of available goods and services in the natural we can begin to identify that in the spiritual there is a certain production of goods and services there's a consumption of goods and services and the bride has an economy she's living according to a different set of rules she's living according to a different anointing a different government even a different government and administration unfolding other than what has been before because god's spirit has to meet the challenges of the time that we're living in now and so there has been a change in the economic conditions of god's people a dispensation is an economy it is the resources that are being made available it's services that are being made available it is god and an act of dispensing his word to fulfill a particular purpose and so when it says behold i stand at the door and knock this is i'm wanting to recognize this is a change in the way that god has spoken to the other church ages i stand at the door and knock now i know that we've read the scripture before and we've heard really good teaching on this but i want you to ponder a little bit about what this means christ knocking at the door calling to those that are on the inside the image is that christ is on the outside trying to get someone's attention right if he's behold i stand at the door and knock you you're not knocking on even the languages that suggest that there's one who would hear a knock in and respond to the voice you wouldn't do this as a group right he's not just trying to play a trick on whoever's in the house knocking and running to entertain the people that are around them he there's someone on the other side christ is by himself knocking on the door so there's those that are inside now this could be used in an evangelistic way to appeal to the center to get them to consider that christ is knocking on the door of his heart and and i wouldn't object to that use at all but it's not only a an appeal that could be used as an appeal to the sinner uh to receive christ as their savior uh not only could it be used as an invitation to salvation what you have to recognize that literally in this scripture and the primary meaning of the scripture is that it's a direct address to the apathetic condition of the laodicean church they're they're they are lukewarm they they're arrogant they're self-satisfied they're complacent they're neither hot nor cold and so in this condition christ is now addressing their condition so you realize that the church is in this condition and now christ symbolizes himself as standing at a door and knocking to those that are on the inside it this apathetic condition has created this separation from christ to where now he's knocking trying to get someone's attention to call him out of that condition and so this is this is exactly what this scripture stands for christ is on the outside of the church and christ um this church has abandoned the word this church has rejected christ and having abandoned the word and rejected christ christ is now on the outside knocking trying to get their attention so it has two i just want to point out two very direct implications christ isn't on the inside right we're talking about invert always invert we've maybe accepted for years oh christ is on the outside he's a fugitive in his own church he's been rejected out of laodicea he stands at the door and knocks if he's on the outside of the laodicean church knocking to to get their attention then what does that mean he's not in there that's heavy it's a really heavy thing to consider that he's not in there now if he's not in there what does that mean those on the inside are without christ we could have our breakout session now i've been threatening to do that but my we could just sit around and say okay let's think about that for a minute if christ is knocking on the door then he's not in where he's knocking and if he's not in where he's knocking the one he's appealing to is not doesn't have him and therefore those that are on the inside are under the threat of judgment and the things that are going to come upon laodicea and so the reason why christ is knocking is because those who are on the inside need something for the time that they're living in and if they don't get it they're going to come under judgment so he's knocking in mercy he's knocking in grace to get their attention because he's saying hey i'm not in there and i'm not going to be in there and if i'm not in there you don't have me so you've got to respond to the voice in order to have the union to escape the judgment that's coming and this is where i want to focus on tonight as we've been speaking about being hungry and are you hungry and i am hungry and are you being fed and and over the last couple services speaking about eating to live and typing that with with certain uh bad habits that we might have in the flesh and and those type of using those types just to speak to how god wants to satisfy the bride's appetite ask yourself and i know this is very very elementary and it's it's not just a a cheap scheme to get easy amends i just feel to to to go about it this way and i'll even say this i'm going to maybe in the exact opposite of what i would normally do normally i would start in the book of ruth and maybe build to this but i just feel to start where i would end so really this is the end of where uh where i would ultimately build through this bread of life come to bethlehem if christ is knocking at the door and and he has been rejected let's just consider who it is they've rejected who has been shut out who is it that's become a fugitive and just notice these scriptures these characteristics of christ in john chapter 14 verse 6 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me therefore if christ is no longer in the midst of the laodicean church he's on the outside then the church does not have access to god the way the truth the life is gone so without the way there is no going without the truth there is no knowing without the life there is no living there is no going there is no knowing there is no living in it anymore think about it this is just what the scriptures are telling us christ is not on the inside so the way is missing the truth is missing the life is missing therefore they cannot come to the father as long as they've lost this connection with jesus christ in john chapter 6 verse 63 and i know we've used a lot of these scriptures in this series he's speaking to those that came looking for what the bread the natural bread because who wouldn't want a friend who could feed you every day for free he's he's challenging this notion that they wanted to be there for the miracles and well moses gave us bread in the wilderness and she said no no it wasn't moses they did it was my father that did it and he's making the point that the bread that fell in the wilderness was by in type him that i am the bread and he says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing if i could put it in this context it's the spirit of god that really gives life feed the body all you want and it's just you're just going to get to the grave like everyone else so it's the spirit that quickens it's the spirit that's going to give life it's the spirit that gives strength it's actually the spirit of god that can carry the body and sustain the body and give it vitamins and give it nutrients in the absence of proper food right just even think about it in the in daniel when they were uh they'd announced all these israel children and these fine of princes and these fine young men who were skilled and had talents and knowledge and they'd been kept kidnapped out of babylon and they would have been raised in very strict homes according to the the laws of god and there would have been things they couldn't eat or drink and now they've been kidnapped and they're wanting to turn these young men into chaldeans they want to turn these men into babylonians and so what do they do they're going to change their language change their language they'll assimilate into the culture and number two wanted to change what they'd eat and drink this is how they're going to assimilate them and daniel says no i won't defile myself with what the wine and meat and daniel's the only one that speaks up he says i'm not going to do it and all i imagine just all the other ones would be like awesome if we're going to be slaves we might might as well eat well steak and wine for as long as we're slaves and they were probably excited about but dana says no give me water and vegetables everybody's like daniel come on man live a little besides that's just our parents religion and here we have this chance and this is their only way out we've got to get it we can assimilate into the culture and we can do these things and have these things but daniel says no i tell you what why don't you just give me water and vegetables and then see who turns out in the end who looks better and there was others that joined the three hebrew children hananiah misha and israel they they join in as a right they join in with daniel say no we won't defile ourselves either and in the end god made the difference in just drinking water and eating vegetables god made the difference and sustained because the spirit quickeneth the flesh profiteth little it's not the flesh that we need to feed it's not the flesh that we need to obey it's not the flesh that needs to have the preeminence the spirit does and he says the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so what is he differentiating he's distinguishing between the natural bread that feeds the body and the spiritual bread that feeds the soul natural bread can feed the body you may come to me because i can multiply fish and multiply bread and that'll that'll get you through the day and that'll just feed your body but that profits nothing the profits literally says but this is our profits nothing but this the words that i speak they are spirit in their life he's wanting to separate between natural bread and spiritual bread so he's the way the truth of life the words that he speak are spirit and life and then in verse 51 of the same chapter i am notice he says i am the living bread which came down from heaven i am i am the living bread which came down from heaven he that cometh to me excuse me if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i give for the life of the world now he definitely says it a way to stumble them oh that we're gonna he's gonna give us flesh we're gonna have to be cannibals we're gonna have to eat eat his skin or eat his muscles but he said i am the living bread of life i'm going to give my flesh and it's going to be given for this world and by that people who partake in this are going to live forever so what is it that's been rejected out of the church the way the truth of life the words which are spirit and life and they've rejected the living bread which comes out of heaven they've rejected the living bread that if a man eat any men eat of he shall live forever they've rejected that now by through lip service they certainly don't claim to have rejected christ they actually claim to be serving christ but they have rejected him look at verse 35 of the same chapter and jesus say unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst this is what they rejected the one that satisfies hunger the one that satisfies thirst behold i stand at the door and knock christ being on the outside of the church they've rejected the bread of life they've rejected the one that'll satisfy their hunger they've rejected the one that if they believe on him they'll never thirst so you if you're hungry you want to eat if you're thirsty you want to drink christ is the one that would provide what you need to eat christ is the one that provides what you need to drink in order to satisfy hunger and thirst he who hungers and thirst after righteousness shall be filled they've rejected the fulfillment of whatever would satisfy that hungering and thirsting in john chapter 7 verse 37 because notice how jesus says i'm the bread of life if a man eats me he'll never hunger but then he that believeth shall never thirst this is a real beautiful scripture that has a lot of a lot of um elements to it because it's at a time of a feast in john chapter 7 verse 37 in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any men thirst let him come unto me and drink now i'm going through this just to identify again what's not in that place where those are that christ is knocking there's a door he's knocking on symbolically there's a door that he's knocking on and how it's symbolized in the scripture there's people who are in a particular place we could say in laodicea who are without christ this is who they're without they're without the bread of life they're without the one who stood and said if any man is thirsty let him come unto me and drink and it says in the last day the great day of the feast in verse two it says now the jews feast of the tabernacles was at hand so he comes at a time of the feast of the tabernacles where they had these seven days and then in the and then they'd have the last day of the feast and through these seven days they'd be offering all these different bullocks and all these sacrifices and they'd be offering these sacrifices through seven days for the for all the nations of people but on the last great day the great day of the feast or it says the last day that's the eighth day after seven days of sacrifices to all the gentiles and all the people and all those of the nations of the world on the eighth day there's a holy convocation and they're going to now only offer one bullock and it's for the believers one bullet for israel one bullet for the people of god and so on this last day the eighth day of holy convocation it's the last feast day of the year i just pondered this now as we we're looking at this in the context of the seventh church age and on the at this time this dispensation that opens up in the seventh church age on this day the priest would actually go to the uh the fount of shalom and they would fill up a golden vial full of water and then they would take it to the sacrifice and they would pour this water upon the altar and isaiah speaks of it that with joy you'll draw from the wells of salvation and there's all this rich tradition and history of this uh libation of water and this offering of water on this eighth day this holy convocation but then jesus stands up while this very thing is taking place in the feast of the tabernacles on this eighth day in this holy convocation now he stands up and cries with a loud voice if you're thirsty come to me and drink the priest have grabbed a golden vial and they're filling it up with water and they're bringing it to the altar and they're pouring this water out and there's this water offering and it symbolizes these different things to you and this freshness and this washing but i'm actually the fountain i'm greater than the pool of siloam i'm the fountain if you'll come to me and drink you'll you'll never thirst again so he stands up in the time of the ceremony and the time of this celebration has been taking place and they're celebrating their last feast of the year the last feast day of their year jesus stands and he makes this pronouncement come to me those who are thirsty and i want you to see an image of laodicea in this i want you to see that how through seven church ages through all the religions that have been building all the denominations that have been building and you arrive at a time where there's ceremony there's religion there's works there's tradition there's even the uh how people say i've done many wonderful things in your name and i've done this work and i've done this sign i've done that wonder we're rich we're increased with goods and they're actually bragging of their spiritual economy they're bragging about their works and they're grabbing bragging about their services and they're bragging about all the wonderful things they have it's right there at this time that the ceremony is taking place and all the tradition and all the things that kind of pleases the eye and all the things that they do to play church christ stands up and says wait a minute you guys are just playing church i am water that you can partake in and never thirst again it's then that christ stands he says he stood and speaks so who is knocking in revelations 3 20 who is speaking jesus christ who is he he's the bread of life what is he he's the fountain of living water he is the bread that came out of heaven he's the water that came from the rock think about that as he's identified in john chapter six himself as they begin the conversation in the back and forth he's saying i'm the bread of god that comes out of heaven what were those things they were provisions in the exodus so christ has identified himself as the provision this is the who that is missing in laodicea this is the what that's missing in laodicea if he's not there what's not there bread if he's not there then what's not there water and those are the elements for life so if he's not there there's no there's no life if he's not there there's no provision for life there's no sustainer there's no giver there's no bread there's no water there's no life if he's not there so he says i stand at the door what is this door if there's a door then it speaks of an entrance or some passageway is this an entrance back into laodicea it says behold i stand at the door knocked is christ wanting to take a a is he wanting to come back into laodicea or is it actually an exit is is the door there so that christ can get back in or is the door there symbolically as a passage for the person who's stuck in that condition out of that condition and into an audience with christ in revelations chapter 4 verse 1 it's important it's important to see just how closely connected these things are because as we read it we have revelations chapter 3 then we have revelations chapter four but as john is writing it he doesn't kind of you know kind of wet his pen again and then start chapter four it just says in verse one after this i looked after what after these things have been spoken to the angel of laodicea this is very this is very recent this is very near it's right here he has heard this pronouncement behold i stand at the door knock then it gives the reward to the overcomer and this is after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven so these behold i stand at the the door and knock and now john sees a door opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was it as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter so you've had these seven church ages that take place but there's got to be a translation there's got to be a rapture there just can't always be a cycle of revival and death god doesn't have one compliment for the laodicean church age not one good thing to say about it what is it what is it he has to say about it nothing why because he's going to take a people out of it and there's going to be a rapture and there's going to be a resurrection of the sleeping saints and there's going to be a meeting in the air so now the transition isn't to try to fix the church and get everything right to perpetuate the church ages it's time to change dimensions because he needs to reveal himself to the jews he needs to wrap up the 144 000 there needs to be a millennium there needs to be a white throne judgment we need to get to that eighth and final day where we'll live eternally with him in a new heavens and new earth so now things are changing and rapidly coming to pass because god is fulfilling his promised word after this i look and a door is open and a voice as it were like a trump is speaking come up higher come up higher behold i stand at the door and knock now there's a door open and it says come up higher and i'll show these things i'm going to reveal things to you which are going to take place after you've seen these things transpire and laodicea so chapter 3 introduces a door that christ is on the one side of and everyone else is on the other side again symbolically we see a door and christ is on one side and everyone else is on the other but now chapter 4 identifies a door that's opened in heaven a door speaks of a gate it's actually translated could be translated a gate speaks of an entrance or a way or a passage he says i looked and behold a door was open an open door speaks of an opportunity to do something i have an open door to do this or is there an open door there it's not we're not looking for a literal door but it's opportunity opening up when a door is open he said well this door just opened they don't look around and say well i didn't see a door you're actually just talking about what an opportunity that just came up a door just opened this just happened these things taking place and so an open door speaks of an opportunity to do something it's a discovery of things that are going to be when a door opens it's an opportunity for exploration it's an opportunity for new land it's an opportunity for new possessions when a door opens it's like a new opportunity a door open opening and saying coming up higher the door opening is you could be said said this way the door opening is him hearing a voice saying come up higher that's that's an open door that's an opportunity being made and so now this is the beautiful part to me he says now a door is opened in heaven you have all these church ages unfolding and you have these things that are transpiring and these compliments and these rebukes and these things taking place but now at the end of the laodicean church age and at the beginning of revelations chapter 4 which is setting the scene for the open of the seals the scene changes from an earthly scene to a heavenly scene now it's it's not just earthbound anymore it's not just uh things related to the earth but now john's orientation changes and the opportunity is to no longer remain bound to the earth to no longer remain bound to creeds and dogmas and church systems and church orders but now it's come up higher now the scene changes from earthly things to heavenly things it's a change of dispensation now heaven's being laid open now heaven's being revealed to the bride which is upon earth and opportunities being given we could say oh i haven't i had a door open up had an opportunity presented to me and this is something it's remarkable how that if if you told somebody well why did you quit your job and and why are you why are you doing that why are you doing this training why are you why are you doing that so well an opportunity opened up i've been given a chance well what is it well i can get really rich doing this if i put in my time i do this and i'm on the ground floor and and i can i can really i can make make a lot of money and unless yeah i guess i just let's just be honest unless we know it's a pyramid scheme or mlm or something like that we generally can understand it right well go for it that's great that's wonderful but then somebody testifies i've had an opportunity open up to know christ in a greater way i've had an opportunity open up to to to feed on the word of god i had an opportunity open up to make a greater investment in eternity in my spiritual life people won't object to that i have no problem with an opportunity that opens up to feed the flesh but what about an opportunity opening up to feed the soul the scripture speak come up higher is the do the door opening and so what is this door behold i stand at the door knock there's so much imagery that's contained in this i stand at the door because in john chapter 10 verses 7 to 9 and then the door opening jesus has already said i am the way. so in that sense he is a door then said jesus unto them again this is john chapter 10 verses 7 to 9. verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep i am the way that sheep come it's for the sheep and notice the language he's using all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out this is how we do it by him and then you're coming and going remember how that spoke of wisdom and and discernment and knowledge and understanding and this is the part i want you to focus on he's the door of the sheep i am the door you enter in and what find pasture and that word literally means food find provision find the necessities for true life so the door represents the way to provision the door represents a way to life to feed to have substance just as he was the provision in the exodus the door that is opened up through a voice is the way that you can be fed in the time of famine it's the way that we're fed to receive strength to fly above the nonsense of the world and the nonsense of religion it's the way that we receive strength to triumph over death so this door is an entrance we can look to the scriptures and see this very plainly it's an entrance to the to see the unveiling of jesus christ it's an entrance into the fullness of redemption to receive all that calvary paid for to receive all that it stood for how that in calvary he paid the price of redemption but he did not pay the price of redemption just so that eons and eons and eons of time would unfold where people believe and are saved and then die and we just always have funerals and always have funeral no it was a redemption where he purchased it knowing that one day redemption would come in fullness and he died so that ultimately there would be a people that would not have to die a physical death so there has to come a fullness of redemption behold i stand at the door and knock and now a door open in heaven it's the opening of something and it's not just something different but absolutely necessary it's not something different oh well we're different than this and we're different than that and and sometimes you have these splits within organizations and it's like well so they have this really robust organization and they're thriving they're growing churches and things are going really really well and then they split off and they kind of just change the name maybe they put a comma in or maybe they make something plural and you go well oh this is a i thought you guys were together well why are you no longer together well they only use one cup we believe in having many cups of communion or the split happens because they want to go to several cups but this group wants to have one cup i mean my brother one time had a conversation he was written into somebody and they said oh we believe in only using one cup in communion and he said okay all right that's fine i get that but if you don't use one cup it's something wrong oh yeah maybe that's blasphemy or transgress in the word of god there's got to be one cup he says well what would happen if you had a thousand people you know and you all had to drink because the thing was it all had to be drinking from the same cup and the way that the language is being used to defend it is you just have to get a gigantic you know you think the big gulp is big and you have to have something really gigantic you know and i don't know if they just use straws at that point or how you'd make it work but they have split over things like that we believe in little shot glasses we believe in dixie cups we're at a past an impasse here and they split off this is not just something different where now i just see something a little bit different this is something absolutely necessary for life behold i stand at the door and knock he says if any man hear my voice this is an invitation then to the bread of life this is an invitation to the fountain of life you'll like this and i'll probably i should probably preach on it and just let loose a little bit maybe take off my coat and walk the aisles but if any man hear my voice that word voice there is phoney you know how it's spelled p-h-o-n-e that's the phone we should be worried about right not the the pixel 6 that's coming out or the next iphone i remember one time i think it was overseas and i was talking and i said i had at the time i think i just said i had the new iphone 10 and there was only an eight out and it caused a stir amongst these people overseas thinking that somehow in america we were already rocking the ten and they were stuck with the eight i had to kind of stop the meeting and explain i was just trying to be funny maybe don't get my sense of humor i'm sorry i didn't mean to suggest that you guys were using outdated technology but this is the phone the phone a that we want to hear if any man hear my voice the sound of uttered words it comes from false which speaks of light which means to bring forth into life the voice is what reveals the voice is what declares it's the voice that leads you into light the voice has come up higher and i'll show you things here after behold i stand at the door knocked it was not his hand that makes you aware of him not his providence necessarily but with his providence there has to be a voice that turns on the light it's not just his hand but it's his voice if any man hear my voice it's the voice the utterance of words that lead you forth into life the scripture speaks of how his life his words are a way of life his words are a lamp it's the voice the phonet that declares his presence and brings you higher into another realm changes you from earthly to heavenly and in this image that we have christ standing at the door knocking and there's these people on the inside that are actually very hungry very naked and and wretched and miserable and don't know it the knocking his providence that would knock his voice that would declare his presence is the voice that would awaken a person to the need that they have for the one that stands calling it's the voice that awakens the hungry to what is lacking in their laodicean diet that's why we don't have to try too hard to explain things don't have to try too hard to point things out and and just be the voice a life lived by the word is a voice that's exactly what paul preached paul said look i write to you guys letters you read the letters and if you read my letters and then you lit this and this is what he said if you read my letter and then you live what i wrote i don't even need to come speak to those that here see your life because from you is uttered forth and declared forth the things that i write so you become the voice you become the life and so the voice is what awakens the hungry to what's lacking and we talk about being salty that's that's what is awakened so i just riffing on a song that a brother wrote it's what awakens someone to what they're lacking when you're salty they get a taste for it they get thirsty awakens them to what's missing in their diet now notice the symmetry of scripture to have a a voice behold in the darkest of all ages the most foul and lewd of all ages the one age that's ridiculous has no compliments blind wretched poor miserable and naked and then you have a voice that's going to call to awaken those who are in it and what i'm wanting to see it's a call for a union of the elect with christ because the church age system is rejected and and how that in this condition there's a voice then come up higher notice what it says in revelations chapter 18 verses one to four and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen has fallen as become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication so there's drinking that's represented here and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants listen to the economy now the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies this is describing the culmination of babylon in laodicea this is describing the the babylonian system and the spiritual system of babylon in the religion and and it's waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies you can see this if you read in in in revelation how you're it's describing a woman like wow this woman's beautiful be careful it's babylon john even marveled at her beauty but wrong beauty wrong amenities wrong economy there might seem to be a lot of luxury a lot of things that you could enjoy a lot of things that would satisfy but the flesh profiteth nothing the religion that satisfies the flesh religion that puffs up the flesh religion that preserves the flesh the religion that lifts up man religion that makes other people uh greater than others within the economy of god those are things that relate to the babylonian system and don't fall for that and notice how it says in verse four and i heard another voice hallelujah i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her come out of what babylon why is there a voice saying come out of babylon there must be elect in there that are not ordained to eat her delicacies to be blinded by her doctrines and so there's a voice saying come out so this is out of time just like it is in laodicea where there's a bunch of people sitting around and are we rich and aren't we wanted for and aren't we doing good and don't we have everything we need and they're worshiping christ not realizing he's no longer in there but all of a sudden there's a knocking and everybody might start getting excited about the knocking but there's one that sits there and says wait a minute i'm blind i'm naked and it's a voice calling out from beyond the darkness a voice calling out saying what what did it say what did the voice say come up higher what is it what is it everyone be quiet be quiet for a moment i need to hear a still small voice and everyone's just shouting over the earthquake everyone's shouting over the fire everyone's shouting over the whirlwind but there's a hunger and so and so i say no i gotta hear this still small voice what does it say come out of her my people come out of her my people why do i need to come out that you be not partakers of her sins that you not partake in it and that you receive not of her plagues come out of her why there's judgment coming come out of her because there's only one way of escape and what is it what is it telling him to do he says that you be not partakers and you receive not there's a pro there's a partaking there's a giving and a taking there's an exchange come out of her economy come out of her dispensation leave her systems leave her order don't rely upon her to feed you don't rely upon her to clothe you don't rely upon her food don't rely upon that system you could keep reading in revelations chapter 18 verses 10 to 14 it refers to her merchandise of precious metals and precious stones and all the clothing and all the cloth and all the materials and then it identifies her cinnamon and her wine her oil her fine flour her wheat the beast to eat the sheep wow sounds like there's enough there to have a pretty good thanksgiving dinner well sounds to me brother aaron like she has all the trappings and the accoutrements of a good church i mean why shouldn't we go to church here it has everything we need and it seems like they have all the delicacies they have all the provisions and it would satisfy in every phase because they've actually got this program for this group and this program for that group they have this and they have that and they have a traditional service real early and they have a non-traditional service a little bit later and they have all the trappings the fine flour the cinnamon the wine the beast the sheep the precious stones and precious metals they have everything but god says get out of there plagues are coming it's babylon's feast of death it's rotten it's filthy it's cuppa is full of iniquity and lewd and foul things and they're drinking of the wine of the wrath of a fornication and if you drink wine you get stimulated so it doesn't mean those people aren't excited doesn't mean they're not thrilled but he's saying come out of her come out of her into what a new economy come out of her to a new availability of spiritual resources behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and it says and open the door i will come into him such a beautiful statement if you haven't realized i'm not going very far tonight i'm just really unpacking revelations 3 20. i just i feel like this is important for us to recognize these principles in scripture i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and it says and open the door at the open of the door i will come into him what was hidden now what was closed or on the other side of the door opens up now it's not to everyone it's to the one who hears and opens the door if any man hears my voice and opens the door i will come into him so whatever whatever condition the person was in on the other side of this door when this opportunity opens up he says i will come into him whatever was hidden whatever is closed whatever sealed off now opens up open the door he that opens the door upon hearing the voice you can even look at it in this sense that you seize the opportunity upon hearing the voice you're responding because there's something different that's taking place than what you hear in the uh and when there's an open door that's set before you which no man can open right this is a different dynamic of the open door that we hear earlier in the church ages this is a different kind of dynamic because now it's it's an opportunity that a man has to take advantage of the open door upon hearing the voice i'm gonna take advantage of this opportunity i'm gonna seize the moment i'm gonna take this i mean i've heard his voice and i'm gonna come to him he that hears my voice and opens the door i will come into him and notice i will manifest myself personally to him that way he's raptured up quickly into a private feast with the lord and everybody else is still hanging out in laodicea kind of looking at you thinking you're crazy why because david prophesied that he'd be feasting what in the presence of his enemies that's what god does he could just take us away right but prophecy doesn't say he's just going to take us away prophecy says i'm going to spread a table out before you in the presence of your enemies and i'm going to prepare a feast and you're going to eat in the presence of your enemies relaxed in resting not nervous not fearful not worried right there in the presence of death right you're just going to enjoy it and you're going to eat and that and the enemy's going to be rattling their shields and their swords and their chains and they're going to be sitting there saying and normally if you would eat in a war you'd eat quickly you'd eat in haste but the language that the scripture uses of one who's at rest hid in the secret of his tabernacle feasted in the presence of his enemies eating and not fearful of all those that are gathered around him why he knows he's victorious i will personally reveal myself to him and i will come with him and he says and i will sup with him and he with me sup it's used at the last meal of the day why is it you why is it you sup and this time the last meal of the day because it's the last feast before the translation it's the last feast before the tribulation last feast before the wedding supper in the sky there's going to be a meeting in the air there's going to be a wedding supper but before that wedding supper there's a marriage that's taking place here which is a spiritual feast it's the last meal of the day just as jesus stood up on that eighth day in that holy convocation in the last feast day of the year the last day of the feast of the tabernacles and he stood up said i am the well of living water come and drink of me and you'll never thirst again now a very similar thing is taking place within the church as they're all sitting in darkness and wandering in darkness and going into chaos he stands and says come to me behold i stand at the door knock i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me i'm going to hold a personal communion with him i'm going to feed him the bread of life i'm going to give him living water this is what takes place in revelations chapter 10. mighty angel descends out of heaven with the book open and there's a voice that speaks and says go to him that has the book and tell him to give you the book but what happens when you get to him who has the book it's take it and eat it up this is what jesus says behold i stand at the door and knock here's opportunity here's an opening up and if you come to him he says i will sup with you in you with me i will hold personal communion and you'll have the privilege of taking the word of god and eating it up what do these things speak of the bible says in first thessalonians 4 16 and the lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first listen to what brother brahman says in the rapture jesus does all three of them when he's descending a shout this is very simple there's not a lot of expounding on it but just ponder it what is the shout it's the message going forth first you see this perfectly in line with scripture the phrase the living bread of life bringing forth the bride there has to be something to bring you forth just as there is a voice to call someone out of the laodicean condition just as there was a voice to call those out of babylon just as there's a voice that was a door open in heaven calling john higher there has to be something of life and vitality it's a draw it's an attraction here's the living bread of life which attracts the bride away from dead things away from rotten things away from stale things away from hybrid things that can't give life and she says this is what i was hungry for this is what i was searching for this is what i was longing for all my life little did i know if this was what was leading me christ the revealed word this is what i was hungry for and it brings people forth and it's the living bread of life bringing forth the bride a need there has to be a need then in god's people that he is going to meet that when he makes himself known it's deep calling to deep at the noise of thy fountain i've left i left my water i left this natural i left these things i'm responding now to this call why because i've heard a voice and this is what i've longed for this is what i'm hungry for it's the living bread of life it's jesus christ i am the bread of god that comes out of heaven i am the living bread i am the bread of life what does it do it's what brings you up and raises you up look think of how it looks in matthew 25. you have you have these virgins who there's five wise and five foolish and then there's a cry maid behold the bridegroom cometh at midnight behold the bridegroom cometh now there's a lot of there's a lot of assumptions that we could make with the scripture but invariably all of them wake up and the wise rise and trim their lamps and they seem to be the one that really respond to behold the bridegroom cometh and you could read it to where the activity of the wise is what kind of gets the foolish stirring oh they're trimming their lamps but the foolish realize they don't have any oil the fullest very well may just be deducing by the fact that the wise have trimmed their lambs that it must be time for the bridegroom to come so they're all acting only based upon the movement of those who have the oil and now there's great activity and they're like we don't have oil give us one like sorry you can't get it from us go buy it yourself and what they do they go to buy oil so there's some economy there's some giving and exchanging there's supply and demand there's some sort of commerce that's taking place but while they're out trying to transact for the holy ghost the bride who has it meets with her bridegroom and they begin to have a feast and it says in revel it's matthew chapter 25 verse 10 and while they went to buy the bridegroom comes and they that were ready and had oil they go into the marriage or the union and the door is shut they miss the opportunity and so the door is shut but now there's a union that's taking place for those who ordained the elect to the oil those who have heard the voice and gone out to meet him now the door is shut and what was it it was the living bread of life the master is come and calling for thee that brings you to him for the union and for the marriage it's a living bread of life that brings forth the bride it's not gonna be politics not gonna be personality not gonna be opportunity it's christ that has to be what you're tied to more than anything it has to be christ that's who you've met that's who's speaking to you that's who you're following that's who you're married to listen to how brother branham puts it in god's chosen place of worship i say the harvest time would be a wonderful sermon to listen to these god's chosen place of worship would fit very well with this too he says my friends i don't want to hurt feelings but i'm responsible for a message what was that message think about it and the message is come out of this mess hey i got you have to be careful because some people might misunderstand you but i think there's a mess age that you got to get out of come out of this mess and if i ask you to come out where am i going to take you i love this would i take you to the branham tabernacle it's as much fault as any of the rest of them but there's one place i can take you where you are safe and protected from death oh well where's that green's mill oh it's got to be tucson right no it's in alaska where is it let's find it this mecca let's find this place that we can all go that's in jesus christ god's place of worship that's the place i'm introducing to you tonight where god puts his name introduction opportunity not not come to this church and believe this system and follow this order and do these rules and do these things no it's i'm introducing you to jesus christ there's one place that he put his name right where god put his name where he promised he'd meet every person that come in there he would worship with him he would worship with him and feast with him that's in christ not in no church no tabernacle amen it's not in a church it's not in a tabernacle this is the kind of confidence we can have in with as believers is absolutely solemnly believe and some of you have experienced this it has nothing to do with whether or not there's got to be a church or there's got to be this or there's got to be that but there's just a christ that i'm married to and he's the one that's feeding my soul and thank god that there's still churches today that are introducing this christ and pointing to christ and lifting this crashed up so that sheep of this fold could come to a place where the christ is lifted up and they can be led and they can be fed by christ who is their savior he would worship with him and feast with him that's in christ not in any particular church and not in any tabernacle so in the book of ruth with that as a foundation i'd like to turn to my text now and uh if we could just preach the summer started yet now i'm going to end i'm going to end here as a matter of fact i'll ask brother micah and brother loyal to come just to create expectation for a close i could get carried away in this so i want to be very strict in how i express this in the close it says the two went until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem bethlehem means in the hebrew house of bread the word their bread is even used of food jesus christ had to be born in bethlehem why because he is the house of god's bread and notice what's beautifully being represented in the book of ruth i'm just i wanted to go backwards you know i'm going to introduce the introduce this and i i trust personally i hope and i hope that the lord will allow me to go into this next wednesday ruth what is it call the mobitus ruth the gentile comes to bethlehem you think about the story and i just i don't want to give too much away necessarily or get too far down the road in it not giving anything away but just start getting ahead of myself and feeling like i want to take more time to expound upon this but just ponder these things it was famine that caused israelites to leave and to go into moab so they left because of famine and as a result of the famine and them leaving these two hebrew boys marry this one if i could just say mary's ruth and naomi's husband dies and ruth's husband dies and orpa's husband dies but we know that naomi goes i got to go back i got to go back to israel i got to go back to the promised land i got to go back to where i come from and she persuaded her orphan to stay and she said fine i'll go back but there was something in ruth that wouldn't let her stay back and so you have in this image of a famine that caused these circumstances famine and death is how the book of ruth opens and it's famine that causes this gentile woman to come to bethlehem and when she comes to bethlehem she doesn't come in a famine she comes at the beginning of barley harvest and you ruth you've come not during a time of a famine but you've come at harvest time and so the the the invitation that i'm expressing is come to bethlehem ruth is you if you as you ponder the story her trajectory of life excuse me she wasn't aiming for it she was just kind of walking in what was taking place and doing the best she could and following what was in her heart but what did god have all along she just happened in the place [Music] happened but it was there she met the kinsmen come to bethlehem this is what the voice of revelation 3 20 calls to you he says come to bethlehem come to the house of god's bread aren't you thankful to be feasting on the bread of life let's stand together [Music] [Music] tonight [Music] let's bow our heads in prayer if you need a touch from the lord tonight i just i invite you to lift your hand as an expression to him saying lord i'm lifting up a hand of hunger and thirsting you know your circumstances in life and you know just even you know better than myself just how supernatural the service has been for you if it's met a need just lift your hands to him and accept it and receive it now in the name of the lord if you have a heart's cry or a hunger just lift your hands to him and say lord i have this need in my life take him for all that you need [Music] there's a place he wants to meet you personally and manifest himself to you i i feel that almost i don't know if there's any hand that wasn't raised tonight we're all in one accord then think of that right now believers everyone has raised their hands from the youngest to the oldest raise their hands we're all of the same mind now ask don't be afraid to ask the things that can transpire right now are limitless with god don't be afraid to ask of the things that you've been afraid to ask for don't be afraid to ask for the things that maybe seem to have been so elusive but don't ask a miss ask believing ask for the right reasons our gracious heavenly father tonight it's been such a tremendous atmosphere and even now lord as we gave an invitation to the people to lift their hands to you to make a request every single hand in the building went up lord with the unity like this lord i believe that you're moving in people's hearts and that things right now could happen of supernatural quality and significance a lord whatever need was represented by the lifting of hands whatever need is being lifted to you through a whispered voice whatever need is being lifted to you from the cry of one's heart i ask now father that you would come and meet that need lord regardless of the condition of laodicea regardless of the condition of the church world regardless of the condition of denominations in religion there's still a voice calling to the elect whether it be come out of her and open the door and come up higher there's a voice that's calling out to us [Music] which is an introduction to you jesus christ [Music] the privilege of sitting at your table and feasting and i asked lord that you would grant an abundant grace to us as we are fighting battles that we never thought we would fight as we're facing enemies that we thought were long vanquished as we're wrestling with things that the devil would want us to think are elementary and we should have conquered that a long time ago lord we're asking for grace tonight and i pray that you would give to your people the rest that your word brings the comfort of the holy ghost and the comfort of one another that we would be encouraged and strengthened in the inner man you are that bread of life and father as i believe there's many that have come to bethlehem and are enjoying the house of god's bread may our lives be an open invitation to others come come to bethlehem that he who is thirsty come let he who is hungry come come and drink come and eat come and take of the waters of life freely there's no cost there's no price just come [Music] i pray that you'd bless us tonight as we close the service as we worship bless your people be with those who are not with us tonight be with those who've come lord bless them encourage them strengthen them our visitors lord may you be their portion to lead them and guide them renew hope lord may all fear be crossed out [Music] may you heal our unbelief lord make us ambassadors for your cause this new economy lord may we live it faithfully may fully avail ourselves to it may we become ambassadors of it lord we we can become evangelist for so many things we can become evangelists for certain investments evangelists for certain types of cars evangelists for certain kinds of foods or diets or certain brands of essential oils or clothing or opportunities lord we can become evangelists for software companies we can become evangelists for programs and so many different things lord may we first and foremost be your evangelist be your dispensers into stewards of the mysteries in this hour lord there's hungry out there and they need to be fed and may we be the ones that are carrying as it were a sandwich board that says come to bethlehem come to bethlehem bless your people tonight i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen do you feel revived in your spirits tonight it's a little bit of a refreshing in your hearts that's him it's christ that does that the living bread of life purging us cleansing it's giving us confidence despite circumstances we we can pray all day long that the enemies drop their swords but really he wants you to do is don't worry about the enemy just enjoy the feast they'll saber rattle they'll they'll brag they'll trash talk they'll shake their things in your face but he says no no no focus on the feast eat eat in peace shalom the feast is here hallelujah
