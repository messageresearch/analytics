TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so in acts chapter 7 we'll start with verse 44 we'll read the verse 49 we've been ministering on a subject of the bride's advocate and we've it's been a few services that we've spent on this subject and we felt very impressed um to take at least one more service in this area and maybe putting just another coat of paint over the subject and even over the what we administered last weekend and really what's been burning in my heart is to emphasize really the fullness of what we have in the advocate just really to understand the fullness of it and in a lot of ways the fullness of the atonement because john in first john chapter 2 verse 1 he says we have an advocate with the father and then he says it's jesus christ the righteous and then he connects him with the perpetuation which is the same word in the old new testament from mercy and so really we can kind of see those two roles working together uh we don't have a divided christ where he's pleading for our sins on one hand and then trying to encourage us on the other the very one that purchased your salvation purchased paid redemptions claims he's the very one that advocates for you he's the one that's on the inside of you and so let's just look at verse 44. we'll read the verse 49 here in acts chapter 7. our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david who found favor before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob but solomon built him a house so just kind of if you notice kind of the tracking here the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness and then now david desired to build a house solomon builds that house it's the temple and then this great question which is posed in isaiah as well how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me say if the lord or what is the place of my rest what house will you build me and what is the place of my rest god bless you you can be seated this uh this morning and i feel like maybe i'm a little bit more of a box up here can't really hear myself very much but as long as i can hear your amens i think i'll be okay um and uh we just give you the liberty to do that as as you are believers with the holy spirit then what you do is you you amen what you know to be the truth not just what the preacher tells you to amen you amen what you know to be the truth i want to share several things in the outset about the advocate that's kind of summary kind of picking up some of the things that we've ministered on and we found that in the message what is the holy ghost that brother branham takes that that word advocate and he really takes it and just amplifies it by connecting it with the comforter in in uh when jesus is speaking i'll give you the father will send you the comforter it's the very same word so it's the same ministry it's the same it's the same office and brother branham just goes through all these different things that the comforter is that the advocate is also he's a guide and he goes through each one of those things and what we're looking at is how that our atonement our advocate is our atonement uh the same one that advocates for us is connected with the perpetuation so he is a mediator he is a comforter he is a teacher he is a guide he is a supporter these are all the things that the holy spirit is to the believer and we find in the scripture and brother brahma is just very very deliberate in the way that he phrases these things how that our atonement as our atonement christ becomes our mediator and so he fulfills this role as one that was mediating for us when we were in our sins he's the intercessor and it's by his blood as the scripture tells us in the new testament it's by his blood that we are reconciled to god and so this is the ministry that christ had to reconcile us back to god and in using that language of reconciliation the writer is intentionally connecting jesus with what the old testament sacrifices were symbolizing what they were foreshadowing and what they were pointing to because they were all done to show a type and so we understand what we were emphasizing last time is we understand the role that christ plays as a sacrifice for the salvation of the elect and that role that he plays in that position but what we want him to recognize more fully and understand more deeply is how that our advocate is a mediator within our hearts that it's he's just not a bloody lamb up there somewhere in some other dimension that wow if we only knew where that was if we could only get there and we're just kind of imagining a literal bloody person that stands before the father and every time we make a mistake he's trying to say well just forgive them they don't know what they're doing he is a mediator even within our hearts and so he's interceding to support us emotionally he's intervening to support us a mentally and spiritually he's there to give us strength and to encourage us and to lift us up and so we understand the one role that he plays but there's this other other part that comes with the atonement there's other parts that come with him being an advocate and in hebrews chapter 7 where we read from verse 44 just prior to that it's in verse 22 he says that jesus was made a surety of a better testament so he's made a guarantee of it he's the guarantor he's the surety of a better testament so we can see we understand scripturally we understand how we can see the bloody lamb before the father for the forgiveness of our sins but when paul begins to take that picture and expand it and cause the jews to look at what they had under the law and what they had under the first covenant and get them to consider what they now have under the new covenant he in the book of hebrews places christ not just as a high priest before the father but he actually places him as a high priest in our hearts that if he was if he's at the right hand of the majesty interceding on our behalf we are raised by the baptismal he goes into heavenly places in christ jesus so the believer is setting there as well so the intercession isn't he's a third party who's gone in and we're kind of wringing our hands oh i hope this works out in my favor i hope he comes out with good news we're right there with it it's something that we benefit from present tense immediately having this one who's in our hearts and so christ dwell in our hearts is the security of a better testament he is the pledge he is the mediator of god's promises we can draw from that we can get support from that and as we were closing on last time this place of mediation is not behind a curtain it's not behind a veil of skin animal skins as it was in the old in the old covenant but now with the blood upon our souls this place of mediation is coming from within us as brother branham said in the revelations chapter 4 part 2 this is in the sermon 24 elders he says now the first throne was in heaven and this is where i want to kind of go back and see these images in scripture now the first throne was in heaven judgment see the second throne was in christ the third throne is in man so there was one in heaven then we see this throne in christ and he says this third throne is in man then he says the the very very next weekend as he continues on revelations chapter four he's preaching part three he calls this subtitled the throne of mercy and these are the sermons he preached uh that we draw that he draw called the revelation of jesus christ series that became a lot of the substance of the church age book and he says the mercy seats in the heart now this is one way of looking at this the mercy seat is in the heart the seat where the shining forth of his glory in all of his children the shekinah glory in the human heart now i really just want to amplify that i don't really want to leave that image brother adam is saying that there is if we see this role and because there's a way that we begin to think immediately that there's a literal seat and as long as there's some christ as a bloody lamb is sitting in that literal seat uh then that's when there's mercy so then all of a sudden we can have this paradox where rain begins to lock up a little bit because wait wait a minute the mercy seats in my heart and then if he's in my heart then and then or i have a mercy seat and as long as he's there then everyone can be saved and then also think oh wow you know i'm walking around and christ everyone who walks stands before me when i'm at the grocery store do you realize you're standing before the mercy seat i could condemn you right now that's not the way that we carry that image and a lot of times it's just from a misunderstanding of what these things represented or maybe carrying a type a little bit too far but this is very real this is what brother branham says he says the mercy seat is in the heart of man and he relates it to the shekinah glory in the human heart i just think of that phrase there's a kind of glory in a human heart now if you were to go back to when they began to build this tabernacle of witnesses the scripture says our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness and let's say that we went back there and we're talking to these fathers that paul's talking about and you said hey the shekinah glory is in my heart they always say you're completely mad you're offering strange fire buddy because that would be it would be completely against everything that they could conceive or imagine but brother brown's place in the kind of glory now within the human heart he's saying that's where the mercy seat is the mercy seats in the heart of man now he says this just several paragraphs later in the same sermon we're living in another age glory oh i love this age it's not the age of literal sacrifices could you imagine if we were still living in that former age there's certain feasts that required travel to jerusalem and if we were real believers we would have to go to jerusalem and what a quandary some of us would be in right now we have we'd if we had to go to jerusalem we're real believers right so we're going to go whether whatever the word says to do we're going to do it so we're going to have to go to jerusalem and you find out you need a vaccine to go to jerusalem and then you're in a quandary then right well to obey god i got to go to jerusalem but man now i got to get a vaccine i got to wear a mask and you realize you know if we had to be in jerusalem if we were under the old covenant we would have to travel to jerusalem because there was only some things that could be done in a particular location so when brother brahma says oh we're living in another age he says i love this age listen there's a lot of reasons why we can love it but this most beautiful part he says god has a mercy seat today okay there's no ark of the covenant there there's no shekinah glory behind that old covenant behind that that curtain behind that veil but now on the day of pentecost that shekinah glory returns comes back upon the people and is dwelling in human hearts so then for us the comfort that's when the comforter was given the comforter is our advocate so the comforter advocate dwells within our soul this advocacy now it's not adversarial we don't have him so that he can reason with things and and plead with others and and plead on our behalf with others but this is an advocacy within ourselves for our strength and christ lays this out when he speaks to the disciples he's saying because this persecution is coming because this difficulty is coming i'm going to give you a comforter because you believe in me because you love me and want to keep my commandments i'm going to give you a power and a life on the inside of you that will cause you to walk in my commandments that will cause you to do the things that i teach you to do he'll bring all these things to remembrance he'll he'll build these things up within your heart so the advocate is there for your perfection the advocate is there for your strength in john chapter 14 he says that he the spirit of truth which is the comforter will abide with you and dwell in you forever it says it'll teach us all things it'll bring all things to our remembrance just kind of re reminding us of these things this morning he says in john chapter 15 that the comforter which is the spirit of truth testifies of jesus christ where within us within our hearts it testifies of jesus christ and because the holy ghost witnesses to our spirit and testifies of jesus christ that makes us witnesses of what we've heard and so that he has to be on the inside the holy spirit the spirit of truth is witnessing to you of jesus christ and then that makes you a true witness in john chapter 16 he says that the comforter which is the spirit of truth which is the advocate which is the holy ghost guides us into all truth it reveals things that have not yet happened things to come it glorifies jesus christ it receives jesus christ it reveals jesus christ this is who the advocate is the advocate on the side is what tells you when the letter is being preached you can receive that truth it's what reveals to you where christ is hidden this is all the things that this advocate does romans chapter 8 it tells us that he helps us in our infirmities and our weaknesses making intercession for us but where is this place of intercession where is this ministry of mediation where is this transpiring not in another dimension but even within our hearts as brother bam says god is on his heart in the heart of man is the throne of god we think of mediation we think of intercession we think of the third party that goes before the judge we think of somebody who's advocating for someone in court and we think of an attorney we think of a representative we think of this ah this forensic process where something is being investigated and being examined and we have one that would come and meet in a formal tribunal to defend or to represent as a way of of exonerating somebody but god is on the throne of a man's heart he says you get it man god made his throne in the heart of man now we're familiar with this teaching right we're familiar that brother branham takes these things and he places these things throughout his ministry and his teaching that god there is a throne there's a representation of the throne of god within the heart of man and so the throne of god is also represented in man's heart now the mercy seat as he was the scripture says he was a perpetuation a lot of the scriptures we've read in hebrews and even this image of the throne we talk about the throne this is what uh this holy of holies represented in the old testament and so the mercy seat in the old testament was a place of atonement and this is i know review for all of us here it was sprinkled seven times on the day of atonement by the high priest and when he went in there and sprinkled the mercy seat with the blood of the sacrifice seven times on the day of atonement it symbolized it was a symbol of israel being reconciled to god it was a symbol of it if it had literally done it then then there wouldn't have been this promise of one to come and so it was representing the one sacrifice that came and was given once and for all so it was a symbol of reconciliation now where this mercy seat was located in the holy of holies is within the tabernacle as we read it they the our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness and the tabernacle in the wilderness was patterned after god's throne in heaven is that is that not what we're taught we'll look at this in the scripture so brother adam said the first throne was in heaven so that's the first throne and then the very tabernacle in the wilderness that moses sets up is patterned after the throne of god now what i'm gonna what i'm gonna do now for several moments is look at this tabernacle that was in heaven and how it was represented in the old testament under the first covenant and so this first throne in heaven then is symbolized and represented in the old testament in the tabernacle but remember what we where we just left is brother branham said the throne of god is in the heart of man so the third throne is in the heart of man so you have the first throne in heaven just using this uh nomenclature the way that he lined it out you have first throne in heaven second throne in christ third thrown in the heart of man so now we're gonna look at the type of this which is the tabernacle in the wilderness but don't lose sight of where the throne of god is today in man and so in revelations chapter 11 verse 19 it says and the temple of god was opened in heaven now this is we're just looking at this for image sake we're just looking at this for what john takes uh has witness of and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple god's temple the ark of his testament now this is a very extraordinary uh scene for to a jew to an israelite where the the the ark of the covenant had been lost and some say that jeremiah hid it and and some say that was placed here buried there and they have these different um theologies as to where the ark of the covenant would be but now it appears in heaven and they see the ark of his testament in god's temple in the temple of god it says and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hell and there's certainly a lot there in that scripture that could be expounded upon especially within context and what it represents but see this image that john sees now the temple of god is opened up so he could see the temple of god and when he sees the temple he sees in the temple the ark of his testament that's the ark of the covenant that's the very ark of the covenant that was placed within the holy of holies that was in the tabernacle in the wilderness and paul writes in hebrews chapter eight verse five i think it's important maybe to notice that chapter hebrews chapter eight verse five talk about the elements of that tabernacle talking about the elements even of the temple who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things so the things in the tabernacle of witness were a shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount and this is repeated over and over again make it after what i showed you in the mount make it after what i showed you in the mount and what's beautiful is in revelation we see that what moses was shown in the mount was a heavenly image he's shown what was in heaven and then paul even shares this with us in hebrews so that we know what moses saw in the mount was an image that god showed them in heaven then hebrews chapter 9 verse 23 it was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in heaven should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these so the elements of the tabernacle in the wilderness the tabernacle of witness that moses established and set up he saw an image in heaven now he's going to replicate that on earth through this symbol of the tabernacle and in order to use certain things in the tabernacle they had to be sanctified and and consecrated by sacrifice so he's saying if the pattern of things in heaven had to be purified he says the heavenly things themselves are purified or made holy with a better sacrifice so again the images moses saw what was in heaven the same thing that john sees the temple of god with the ark of his covenant the ark of his testament in it now brother branham takes it and so we just see all these witnesses lining up in revelations chapter 4 part 2 the sermon 24 elders as we've already quoted from it he said that was god's throne in heaven moses patterned it on earth now notice the language the brother random is using that there was god's throne in heaven moses saw that throne and built the tabernacle now brother man said god's throne is in heaven moses patterned on earth was god's throne because his judgment seat was represented here on earth in the holy of holies so this is where the judgment seat comes this is where the throne comes it comes into that place the holy of holies all israel come to that one place to find mercy because god only met under the shed blood so that was the only place that israel could find that god that god was there in that his presence was there in behind that curtain he was there in the in behind even the skins that failed uh the holy place and these different things these different courts of the temple they would see that god is identifying himself there and that's where they would know that they had found mercy with all these sacrifices they'd come to one place they all looked to one place for that you just couldn't run off and go sacrifice somewhere and find this there was only one place that it was and brother said god's throne is represented in this tabernacle of witness in the holy of holies he says the very next week now revelations chapter 4 part 3 he says moses was taken up into heaven moses taken from the earth up into heaven and saw the altar of god it says and when he descended from the presence of god god god told moses make everything on earth as patterned after heaven now then when he did he made the ark of the covenant there's this is a the ark of the testament that john saw in revelations 19. he says to make the ark and the covenant he put two cherubim to guard the ark the throne guards the two cherub cherubims now they guard the mercy seat when god is in a shekinah glory so where is god at on the mercy seat that's where the shekinah glory is on the mercy seat and then there's this cherubim that guard the mercy seat he says where was the shekinah glory at the mercy seat they guard that shekinah glory now if you can if you're if you're just kind of tracking the these uh these principles we've already identified that the shekinah glory comes to dwell within a man's heart and he's taking these very same elements in the very same series of sermons in the very same sunday that he's saying that the mercy seat is in the heart of man he's describing an image in heaven and how it's represented on earth and he says where was the kind of glory at the mercy seat and then there was these elements that guarded that were set as a guard over the mercy seat and he identifies the spirit of a lion an ox a man and an eagle and these four beasts that guard the throne of god and how you have the four apostles even in the four gospels that are all guard the throne and and even in those things there's a representation in heaven and then there's a representation on earth and there's this identification this manifestation even on earth even in the scripture the four gospels matthew mark luke and john guard what the book of acts and and brother brahms laying all those things out and identifying them them to us i think it's very very very beautiful and i and two i realized we're the visitors today it seems a little bit awesome welcoming uh the mesa church here and i realized that we're the visitors and and i think a lot of ones who are visiting have probably never heard me preach before and you might leave wondering if you even did hear me preach this morning i get really excited and i go too fast so now you know how to pray for me that i slow down too bad they can't modulate it right brother mitch just put on a auto tune where it just slows me down and i'm talking as fast as i want but what you hear is me it's lower that would be really weird for me to finish and sit down and get to hear myself finish so if with this image in mind this picture in mind we know that the tabernacle in the old testament was a pre-figure of christ so it's a pre-figure of christ it's symbols it's foreshadowing it's it's not the complete substance because if it was paul could never say that the christ was better when the new covenant is better so god is laying all these things out foreshadowing building these types and these shadows in there because it's looking forward to the time that the seed of abraham would come because even in that the promise given to abraham that sarah will have a son and he says in your seed your seed is going to do this and it's going to be given to the seed paul says he wasn't even talking about isaac he wasn't even talking about him but he was talking about christ who was the seed that was to come and so you have the natural siege you have the natural law you have the natural covenant but the greater covenant the greater seed was christ all those natural things the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness was foreshadowing christ and we see very plainly all these different things that are represented in christ foreshadowed in the arrangement of the things and the offerings and the sacrifices and even the physical temple and so the tabernacle was a pre-figure of christ and in the image of god's throne in heaven so first throne in heaven and then the second throne in christ this tabernacle in the old testament this first covenant was a representation of what was already in heaven and then a foreshadowing and a prefigure of the throne that would be in christ and we could take time to read in the scripture how the ark of the covenant is placed in the holy of holies behind a veil of blue and and purple and crimson and white and gold it's behind that curtain and even in the curtains represented the cherubim the ark of the testament the ark of the covenant consisted of wood the shedham wood which was represents humanity and then that wood of the ark is actually overlaid in gold which would represent deity so it already has this symbolism it's already representing something it already has this pre-figure that you would have humanity and then enclosed and enveloped in deity i i identify with that even look at what we're counseled to do in this end time to buy me gold tried in the fire this which is this character of christ this deity you find that we are that we're to be called ourselves and dress ourselves in this linen we're to be washed to have our garments washed even with this crimson blood you see all these same elements that can be configured represent even in our experience as a believer then the mercy seat which was a lid or a covering that was made out of solid gold pure solid gold and actually the cherubim that were part of that were fashioned out of solid gold too and made part of that sea they were considered one with that seed now when you think ark of the covenant i think maybe sometimes we think about a boat and brother in the scripture god actually identifies the covenant and the promise with the ark so you even see this foreshadowing that build an ark which was a we'd call a boat but more like a box a big huge floating box but it's a boat but this arc the word arc means chest a chest or a container that's what it represented was a chest or a container paul talks about how it held the golden pot of manna this heavenly manna and always stayed fresh aaron's rod was in there that which bud and the tables of the covenant the law it says that when moses was finished writing the testimony god told him you take this testimony and you i want you to put it inside the box inside the chest inside the container and to israel and i know this is uh really uh i'm benefiting from how well you've been taught and how well you know the message in the bible when we think of the ark of the covenant we immediately begin to think of what it represented to israel especially in battle and how it before even in the exodus and how precious and important that place that this ark of the covenant was i mean it was considered the chief token and the biggest symbol of god's presence so it's that when this chest this container would show up on the battlefield israel would begin to cry and the enemies would know great we're vanquished and a lot of the espionage and a lot of the way that the enemies of israel conspired against israel was not to try to figure out how to outflank them and try to figure out how to do this or improve on their weaponry was just get the ark of the covenant if we could just get the ark of the covenant and this ark of the covenant was so remarkable that it would curse the enemies in their possession and bless israel those who had it in possession but if you of a man touched it he would die so it was had such an incredible such a token of god's presence and it represented god's divine glory and not just as a symbol but because god used the language of the that he would dwell there and over and over again in the old testament it speaks of him dwelling there that god would dwell in this place and god would be his dwelling place so that phrase that's used of this mercy seat and this ark of the covenant is a dwelling place of god and exodus chapter 25 verses 21 and 22 and that's exodus 25 verses 21 and 22 and thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark this is this covering this lid of solid gold and in the ark thou shall put the testimony that i shall give thee this is god speaking to moses you're going to take this testimony of the of my mind and of my law you're going to finish it it's going to be done you're going to put it inside of the ark and there i will meet with thee think of how beautiful this is there i'll meet with him i and i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat community means to speak i will declare things to you i will converse with you means to command to promise even to warn this is the place where i'll warn you this is the place that i will speak this is the place that i'll declare things this is the place that i'll converse with you this is the place that i'll give commandments this is the place that i'll make my promises if i'm gonna say something i'll do it in this place if you're gonna receive something i'm going to do it in this place if you're going to be able to be sure of it it's going to come in this place he says from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony of all things which i shall give thee in commandment unto the children of israel this is the place that i'll meet you this is the place that i'll commune with you i'll be there above this lid between between the two cherubim so it's in this place it represents god's dwelling place in psalm chapter 80 verse 1. give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadeth joseph like a flock thou that dwelleth between the cherubim shine forth this is the language that's used of this location above the mercy seat between the chairman which had their wings tip tips touching and their faces down it created this place this dwelling place this spot in god the shepherd of israel is described and defined as he who dwells between the cherubim this is if you said this to a jew they know exactly who you're talking about who's god what god do you serve the one that dwells between the two cherubim they would know exactly there's only one god god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob the one true god the shepherd of israel so this is the temple the tabernacle that moses built which was in the image of the throne of god in heaven as he mentioned already the the old testament tabernacle foreshadowed jesus christ because that tabernacle was where god dwelled among his people that this is god this is a representation god i will dwell there that's where i'll put my name and that's where my presence will be and so this was symbolized as this is where god is so when you and maybe this is a i just kind of think about it in my mind i begin to think about that attitude that israel had towards jerusalem and towards the temple towards this tabernacle that could be moved and placed upon a cart there was only one and it was tied to a physical location and so we have to be careful even as believers as christians to not get so tied into that ideology and that viewpoint of a jew do we have this in our mind well it's got to be in one particular place and it can only be in one particular geographical location we've felt god's presence all over the place haven't we we've experienced them in many different places in our hearts and in our lives we look back and say god met me in this revival and god did this tremendous work here and god moved in this service and god did this there and we've come together and all of us may begin to witness and testify that we came to know him in the baptism of the holy ghost in many different places because the place to meet him is not in one place in jerusalem but to a jew that was where god dwelt but then in jesus christ notice what john says and the language he uses is very important in john chapter 1 verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now why did he use that phrase why to use that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us because they believed the word which was god came and dwelt between the two cherubim and so there was this kind of glory that maybe they couldn't touch it they couldn't handle it they couldn't see it they would only know by by a a cloud because he would appear in a cloud above the mercy they would actually see this pillar of fire and they would know well he's in there don't anyone approach don't anyone come near he's in there because he would give a symbol of his presence on earth come on somebody praise the lord as we give a symbol of that of his presence on earth and so now as as john is describing christ being the messiah he's using a language that would actually take straight from what they viewed the the ark of the covenant and the holy of holies and say now the word was made flesh he's behind skin again but not the skin of an animal behind the skin of jesus christ he says the word was made flesh and dwelt among us as god over and over again said i will dwell between the two cherubim and i will dwell in that holy o holies and there i'll dwell and there i'll meet you and i'll dwell in this house and and this is the place where i'll dwell now john say now god dwelt behind the flesh of his son christ so that language is important he says and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth these are images of the judaic belief system these are images of their theology these are images of what they held to and what they aspired to that you have the shekinah glory that would dwell behind skins behind a curtain in the holy of holies and that's where the shekinah glory would be and then john says that word is made flesh and it dwelt among us and we beheld his glory that's a glory that only only moses could see but now it's in christ this was god's second throne this is our perpetuation he is the one that became our atonement see these elements that were represented in all these all these different elements as symbolized and recognized in the temple they were all speaking of christ isn't it remarkable when you begin to think about it that you have all these different things even to where they would have what was called the scapegoat and all these different elements and so we don't have christ and then who who wants to be the scapegoat can we find some twins here we'll kill the one put your blood on the other and send you out into the valley and you could be the scape go these things are all fulfilled in christ so all these different things you don't have to start kind of chopping it up trying to figure out well one does this and one does that and one does this and we even it's maybe it's easy for us to accept these things because we read them in the scripture but you had an elijah that's a minister it's going to come in the spirit of elijah according to malachi 4 then you have the son of man that's going to reveal the son of man in luke 17 and you have a seventh angel messenger in revelations chapter 10 and you even have a seventh angel to the lay of jesse in church in revelations 3. do we have four different ministries all in one right all filled in one and so you can see that there can be several scriptures that are fulfilled in one ministry you have several different types that are all fulfilled in christ and he became our perpetuation he became our atonement he is the sacrifice that would be upon the mercy see he is the the one that tabernacled the shekinah glory that would be above the mercy seat all these things are fulfilled in this beautiful image so paul writes in hebrews chapter 8 verse 6 as we read that the shadow of heavenly things is what moses saw in verse 5. but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is jesus christ is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises it's just better saints the word of god is just better it's not a it's not a slight for us to believe that god would do something in his word and fulfill prophecy in bringing things our way that we should have every right as a believer to say it's better it's a better promise in the day that we're living in it's a better manifestation of god's glory it's a better outpouring of the spirit it's a better promise that's fulfilled in this hour a mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises so the better covenant the better testament is the new covenant covenant even speaks of an agreement between between two it's the promises jesus said i will send the promise of the father the promise of the father what was that the comforter pro that the father will send you he is the advocate so the better covenant is the new covenant the new testament he says this is the blood of the new covenant in my blood this is symbolism of it he's bringing a new covenant continuing the hebrews chapter 8 verse 10 for this is the covenant been reading this through every i think almost every service that we've had on this subject these four services on the the advocate for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord this is the new covenant under the old covenant god speaks to moses in exodus 25 says when you're done writing my words when you're done writing my testament take this physical testament place it in a physical chest in a physical box and let that word be there that law as a testimony in that box and what does he say in one place put it there as a witness and a testimony against israel it's the mirror image it's the opposite put the word in there because when they fall i want to remind them what they fell from so now paul is saying but this is a new covenant quoting from jeremiah i will put my laws in their mind and write them in their heart and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people so now where's the sanctuary now the heart of man is god's sanctuary now the place for the shekinah glory to dwell is in man's heart he called it the ark of the covenant the ark is what a chest now it's your chest now the ark the chest of the covenant this is a chest of the covenant that's why we as men in this hour ought to be men with chest we have to have a backbone we have to stand for truth we ought to we have to lift up holiness and admire the right things and live sanctified lives why because this chest is a chest where the almighty dwells it's no accident that that's the language that's used because we become the container of the kind of glory so through the baptism of the holy ghost the soul is made the habitation of god paul says in first corinthians chapter 3 verses 16 to 17 know you not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you again it's important to think what paul's saying in light of what all the jews would be thinking well wait a minute we have one temple this is the argument that paul is addressing in hebrews chapter in hebrews he says you are the temple of god why because the spirit of god dwelt within you under the first covenant there's where the spirit of god would come down and the spirit would fill the whole place and god identified himself with that house but now he says you are the temple of god and the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are being very definitive about it i am we sing the song i am a temple of the holy ghost this is not just poetry that this is not just well it's just kind of figurative because when you're saved you can't die and you're going to be in heaven one day and you're going to have eternal life so we just kind of use it as a type and we kind of use it just as an example no the old temple was a type a type of you ethan because now you are the temple of the holy ghost right now you are tabernacling you're holding something inside of you it is the shekinah glory i know these are simple things but i believe that we ought to be reminded and re-established in the simple things so that we don't lose track of what god has called us to be in this hour you are a temple of god that means you are the place that god identifies himself you must be a place that has been sanctified by the blood you must be a place that's been purified you must be a place where his shekinah glory can dwell so now this chest is where god dwells paul says in hebrews chapter 12 verse 24 and to jesus the mediator the new covenant under the first covenant which was an image of what was in heaven god said i'll meet you there and i'll talk to you and i'll speak to you i'll commune with you but now jesus is the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling same images now that are going to be in he in the old covenant that speaketh better things than that of abel as the blood of abel would speak and as blood speaks now he's saying this covenant speaks better under the first covenant god dwelled between cherubim communed and spoke to moses commanded promised warned to moses and numbers chapter 7 verse 89 that's a really long chapter verse 89 and when moses was gone into the tabernacle the congregation to speak with him then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him we can read this way he heard the voice of god speaking to him from the mercy seat he actually heard a voice from that place that god dwelt between the two cherubim above this pure gold lid this all this this ark of the covenant and the mercy seat the mercy covering the mercy lid from there god spoke the voice of god spoke from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony from between the two cherubim and he spake unto him so under the old covenant the first covenant god spoke from between the two cherubim under the second covenant god still speaks because he says he's the media to the new covenant and the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things god still speaks there's still a witnessing there's still a communion there's still a warning there's still a commanding there's still a promising there's still a testimony for where from the throne from the mercy seat from the shekinah glory but this chest this time is your chest hebrews chapter 10 verses 15 and 16. this is repeating what he wrote in hebrews 8 10. this is a repeat of what jeremiah said in jeremiah chapter 33 i believe it is whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us an inside witness an inside teacher not somebody lording over you from the outside say hey you're doing wrong there buddy you better get right but a voice on the inside a voice from within says this is what's pleasing to the lord this is the way walking in it there's a voice that's been quickened and stirred up inside of us he says where the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant this is the new covenant under the old covenant i want you to finish the word moses a prophet i want you to finish the message that i gave you and i want you to take it i want you to put it into the chest so that it will be a witness against israel when they sin but now he's saying this is the new covenant which the holy ghost is going to speak about which the holy ghost is going to remind you of this is the new covenant not that i'm going to take the law and put it in the physical chest but i'm going to finish the message of the god i'm going to finish his voice i'm going to seal it up and i'm going to put it in your chest but not as a witness against you a witness for you that will actually testify and your sins and your iniquities will i'll remember no more against you it's not a testimony against us it's a testimony for us i can still remember the first time i ever heard it oh my just even still to now it thrills me brother doug mccues told the testimony how a young girl came to him and was trying to she she was trying to tell him all the sins that he did and he said listen let me tell you if you stood before god himself and tried to tell him about the sins you're committing he'd say i don't know what you're talking about this is the promise of the new covenant your sins and your iniquities while i remember no more against you so you have a testimony for us so if in even in that image we we recognize christ in the role that he plays for our sins and how we must be identified with that sacrifice and and how it's represented as standing before the father making intercession and mediating forth so that we can come under his blood and be born again which is the baptism holy ghost we're quickened a new life and there's this representation now that continues in his advocacy and brother bannon makes this statement in future home both the heavens and earth now are contaminated with devils that can accuse us before god amen to that this whole world is contaminated and it accuses us before god now are we not in the presence of god and he's bold enough to accuse us in the presence of god and who's the most affected and impacted by the accusations why would we rejoice when the accuser of the brethren is cast down it's not because god can be swayed not because the devil can construct an argument where god says hmm i hadn't thought about that and he looks at you like brother john really i'm not we're not worried about that right who is it before god we even see god we even hear his response in just this type of some sort of conversation who is it that feels condemned our hearts do who is it feels discouraged who is it that begins to question the devil makes the accusation so that you can hear it remember how in the uh in the old testament where there would be people speaking are coming to threaten israel and threaten them upon the wall and they're trying to rebuild the wall they're trying to do something for god and they would come and they would begin to threaten they say hey say their language so they can hear it why they want the people to be weakened in their resolve it wasn't so much getting the leader to change his mind they wanted the rest of the people to weaken their resolve so who does satan accuse us and who is it that feels it and who is it that experiences we do so he says the whole atmosphere is contaminated with devils that accuse us before god jesus is there to intercede for us while the accuser keeps pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this but the blood still covers the blood still covers we can so what does the holy ghost say don't listen to him you're covered don't listen to him you're covered don't listen to him you're covered what that's a witness to us that's his advocacy for us wow why is it our tuner can just really find the devil's voice so easily it's like we know right where to find them oh that's a preset right that's all my favorites i know just how to get this bookmarked i can hear when devil wants to tell me something wrong i i can hear it plain as day and god's over there saying hey don't listen to it it's a big lie shut it down close the door walk away don't listen to him and it's just like right yeah just trying to tune it in just right i don't know if i can get it where did you say that url was again you know is it live is it is there internet working go reset the router i can't i can't hear the voice of god he's there wanting to commune with you speak to you he's wanting to encourage you and lift you up brother branham said well this i want to read from the unveiling of god that would be a good a sermon the unveiling of god and the mighty god unveiled be two perfect sermons to go and listen to and i trust that you are listening to this voice go and listen to those messages brother brahma is walking through the beautiful picture of god veiled behind skins how those veils hides people but then once a god god removes the veil and then unveils himself in his people so the intercession this i guess this is the what i want you to recognize the intercession there then is not in jerusalem nor is it in a a jerusalem in the sky but even in the new jerusalem which is his bride it's in you it's not just in a throne in heaven but it's the throne in you brother brahman says in the unveiling of god you are templing christ you are the temple of the holy ghost you are tabernacling christ you are temple in christ that's behind the veil of the skin the veil again in human flesh hides god the word from the unbeliever i think sometimes we do a really good job of that right but it's this veil that's going to stumble them it's the way it lives the way it believes the way it dresses the way it acts it's it's the veil that hides them from the unbeliever we even see that it's the veil of his flesh of the prophet that stumbles the unbeliever so it's your temple in christ he says again in the same sermon and he veils himself today in earthen vessels with the shekinah earth and vessels hold the shekinah the outside looks like a bunch of holy rollers old badger skins but the inside hides the shekinah glory again recognize the image that god is creating in your person you that's a three-part being body spirit and soul the very layout of a tabernacle down in the soul the holy of holies there dwells what the shekinah glory you become a tabernacle behind the animal's skin behind the human skin he says there's where the shekinah glory is at one time it would be in the tabernacle of witness in the tent of meeting in the old testament at one time it was in christ but now he's behind your flesh the inside hides the shekinah glory bill abraham's preaching a church dedication in kentucky in 1962 and he's using the temple and the dedication of the temple and these different images of the tabernacle and when they brought the ark and he placed it within the the temple and the dedicating the temple the presence of god came and it just filled the filled the place but everyone said brethren takes that type of when the shekinah glory came the temple and he's saying that's the kind of glory came on the day of pentecost he says when they were gathered in the upper room they waited that time for the promise of the father in the new covenant is going to be the promise that jesus spoke of the promise of the father this is the promise that i make go and tarry until the promise of the father comes they're all there in one mind and one accord and all doubt is crossed out it says god came down again in the shekinah glory and filled all the house where they were setting what did god do like the ark dropping into its proper sockets for the message of that day god dropped back into his proper channel not under a denomination or into a building made with hands but into the heart of men isn't it wonderful to know that it's not the building the physical building it's the heart of man he says god came to his resting place where he finds rest not a building but in the hearts of his people he finds rest god's place of rest not in a building where does he find rest he says in the heart of his people where where where in the heart of people where does god find rest in your heart why is it that maybe we're restless because rest begets rest if you let him find rest in your heart then you'll find rest in him our advocate i'm going i'm closing here and uh to those that don't know me that means nothing to you and then maybe to those who know me they might feel it means nothing to them but it means i'm on my closing thought i'm like i'm getting there but our advocate is the comforter in our hearts so many scriptures are like to you so many different places even rehearse and bring back up these images of this advocate the comforter the spirit of truth and how he's the inside teacher he's for you on the inside and he's there on this side not not in the view that we hold where he stands before the father interceding and mediating for us but now that we've been born again by the baptism of the holy ghost now he's inside interceding pleading mediating for us against our mind and our imagination our conscience memory reason effects even against our sick body by stripes i'm healed no not fearing death and not worrying about this and i'm going to take care i'm going to lead you and guide you he's there what in the heart of his people where he finds rest behind your skin is the shekinah glory and in acts chapter 7 verses 48 and 49 how be it the most high well if not in temples made with hands i saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool beautiful image there now of joining the joining together of god whose feet are upon the earth whose head is in heaven who heaven and earth embrace and kiss in christ who heaven and earth are coming together in all these different elements we see them over and over again even in the beginning this type of the bridegroom in christ he says heaven is my throne the earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest you are his tabernacle you are the place where his glory dwells as we read from hebrews chapter 10 this is the covenant that the holy ghost witnesses of as we've read in chapters eight and chapter nine and just working through hebrews chapter 10 it says wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body thou has prepared me god dwelt in heaven then that's his first throne then his second throne is in christ we see this body thou has prepared me now god has a body in his son and we see those things we accept those things we recognize those things but in first corinthians chapter 12 verse 27 now you are the body of christ and members in particular this is the body that he had prepared it is a mystical body it is the body of christ it is the body of the bride and listen it is not defined by your dot com it is not defined by your zip code it's not defined by your area code it's not defined by a geographical location it's not defined by the church you're baptized in or the altar where you found god at it's not defined by four walls it is not defined by who your pastor is or who your pastor ain't it is defined by being baptized by one spirit into the body of christ and no man has authority over that no man mediates on her behalf except the man christ jesus that is the body that god dwells in you are the body of christ you are members in particular of the body that has been prepared for god you are the temple of the holy ghost there he advocates there he supports there he lifts up there forever is the atonement in its fullness there forever is the advocate he'll never leave you nor forsake you i'd like to close with at least one one statement a quotation from what house will you build me spoken in tucson tabernacle november 1965 and i have another one i may read i'm just just wanting to be very sensitive to just where we leave it brother branham says and i believe that god almighty will bless you if you'll just stand by this church now this group of people and he's telling me how brother perry green had started this church he says not only and this is instructive he says not only that but let's go out and see if we can't get others to come in notice those who have the advocate can now advocate let's go out and see if we can't get others to come in let's speak to others everywhere speak to them about our church and what it means we're here and brother graham's about even himself we're here we want you to come in bring in strangers and i'm sure it'll be good for all of us we have a building which we are thankful for we're thankful for this place together but how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands see for heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool and where is the place of my rest but a body thou has prepared me and he just takes these scriptures acts 7 hebrews 10 brings him all the other he says and we are a body of christ all those scriptures he brings together very quickly acts 7 hebrews 10 first corinthians 12. so he says we move from one building to another like i can personally relate to this very very well so as we move from one building to another i believe and this is brother i'm speaking of himself in bringing our messages and we'll come down and have healing service this is what he was describing that he would do at tucson tabernacle he'll come in and bring he says and bring in our message that was his message now we don't bring another one right as ministers of god as ministers of this message we have under our messenger we're the final voice to the final age we have a message that is perfect that we preach so the messages that he brought when he was done finishing that it has been sealed in our hearts in our chest he says and anything the lord reveals to us to do we'll have it right here in the church and it's somebody there tucson tabernacle and i just love this image because he says let's go out and see if we can't get others to come in and bring in strangers he says i'm sure it'll be good for us until it swells out so big you'll have to take it somewhere else and somewhere else until jesus comes he says god bless you this is beautiful instruction from the prophet before he leaves the scene this is the type of enthusiasm we ought to have for the body of christ and its enthusiasm that then we begin to recognize that as a christian as a believer and as i believe god has placed me within the body of christ and god has led me to be a part of even a local body says we are a body of christ and and let me just say this the local church arizona believers church does not supersede or assume in the mesa church if there's a the mesa church and there's a body that god has brought together in that and then there's an arizona believer's church then we are one in christ that's where we that's where one that's how we have fellowship one with another as we walk in the light of god and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin and unrighteousness and we have fellowship one with another there's no church that's greater than the body of christ but we recognize as men of god that god places within our fellowship within the local body members of that greater body so we have a fidelity we have to have a fidelity to the word that what we preach promotes the local body in harmony with the global body the mystical body i think his language here is just so beautiful what house will you build me we are the body of christ now and i hope what i'm doing here is it'll just hold you in suspense keep like whoa ponder that think about that because because then i'm going to stop but i want you to ponder this he begins to pray dear god as we stand there on this platform which represents right over the altar here we realize that we are a dying race of people as far as this earth is concerned we look out upon the streets and see sin wrote everywhere and that can i just pause for a moment remember where the shekinah glory dwells remember who the temple of the holy ghost is remember where the mercy seat is all these images that god that we've read in the message of the hour and we've seen the scripture who you are and he says we look out into the world and he said the world is contaminated with accusers and devils that accuse us before god and you see this whole contamination all this ungodliness brother brahms praying looking out of this altar talking about this church and we are the body of christ what house will you build me and he doesn't live in a building made with hands but he lives in the hearts of his people and he makes this statement praise this prayer he says we see sin wrote everywhere and that the glory of the lord is swiftly departed imagine that the glory of the lord is lifting as it were he sees it becoming fewer and fewer and the glory of the lord is leaving we see the glory of the lord is swiftly departing and listen and we know when the glory of the lord goes up so will the church go with it why now why would that be that seems really odd when the glory leaves the church goes doesn't seem odd at all does it where is the glory it's in his church it's in your chest if the glory leaves it's got to take you with it and this image that he's pictured that he's painted it's not that we're all kind of sitting here the holy ghost is gone i guess we better get out of here no if the holy ghost leaves it's taking you with it so where's the last place of his glory if the world's gonna hear it's gotta hear it from you if somebody's gonna hear the voice he's gonna hear it from you if anyone's gonna see christ they're gonna have to see it from you the glory of the lord is swiftly departing how else do we see it departing and we see the chest of our loved ones laid in another coffin we see believer one by one taking that god harnessing death and putting bits in his mouth and dragging members of the body into the presence of god little by little his glory is swiftly departing taking one after another with him but one day when the glory leaves the church goes with it because she's the temple of god i invite the musicians to come we have an advocate with the father the glory of the lord was always identified with uh it was identified with the place where he dwelt between the two cherubim above the mercy seat in the ark of the covenant in the holy of holies in the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness which represented the first throne which was in heaven which then represented perfectly in christ which was the second throne now where is his throne it's in you where is the place of mercy there's a place of mercy in you now again don't don't twist them don't twist the image but think about what is in you the shekinah glory dwells in you it dwells within the heart of man you want to don't want to contort it and twist it and kind of get self-righteous with it to where somehow we take the throne that's within our hearts and and we we try to maybe divide it and separate it to our way you have christ who was the throne at one time and now there's a new throne no it's all working together all these elements all these parts we've got to stay very faithful to what brother branham taught but we don't ask god to give us a revelation of what he taught and when the glory of the lord leaves the bride's leaving brother branham as he's preaching revelations chapter four part three we read to you how he said that the mercy seat is in the heart of man it's where the shekinah glory is in the heart of man [Music] and he says that the throne of god is in the heart of man he says where is the shekinah glory at the mercy seat where's the mercy seat i'm just kind of re-rephrasing these things or repeating what he said the mercy seats in the heart of man this is what he says at the beginning of that that message revelations chapter four part three now is the day of mercy let's go back in the old testament here just to find just a little bit and find out what mercy is and that's when he drops back and pays this beautiful picture through several paragraphs he says go on back and see what happened to this throne this throne of course is the judgment seat and the reason today that there is mercy is because the mercy seat is sprinkled with an atonement blood and why is it that they'll even be the foolish that go through tribulation brother bam says because they reject the atonement in his fullness because they're not covered by the blood but who goes the bride who is covered by his blood the mercy seat is sprinkled with atonement blood and as long as blood is on the judgment seat then it's not a judgment seat no more it's mercy but something died to stay just a judgment the mercy seat is not a chair and as long as it's occupied by christ there's mercy the throne of god is where you find mercy and the throne of god is where they're going to find judgment still is thrown it's still the place of his presence there's just something that changes with it he says as long as blood is on the mercy seat it showed that something died to hold judgment back that's the image of the old testament and i'm just leaving you with this statement for you to ponder and to think about but when the church is raptured the mercy seat becomes a judgment seat what's holding away judgment right now the fact that we're still here only he who now let us will let until she be taken out of the way the only thing that's holding back the antichrist the only thing that's holding back complete total domination and chaos and and and darkness and death and tribulation is the fact that you're still here and we know that if we're still here there's a reason for it then we know with the advocates in our heart and with the holy ghost the spirit of truth and the comfort in my heart advocating for me i want to be his advocate i want to do what i'm supposed to do because one day when i'm gone mercy becomes judgment one day when this bride leaves the glory of the god goes with it do you see now why can you see just maybe in another emphasis not changing anything and not adding to anything but realizing the reason why it's nothing but judgment when when the bride is raptured is because there's this is the only place where the voice of god is lived out and lifted up it's the only place that you can find truth to be saved you say saved oh we can get in a huge debate about save well let's just say saved from tribulation saved from death place of waiting torment this eternal endless fall safe from white throne judgment sealed and to the day of your redemption guaranteed the first resurrection placed into the body that will never die that'll never stand before the judge but we'll actually be in the throne the throne in the mercy seat in that place dispensing justice and judgment absolutely we have an advocate let's stand [Music] if we could bow our heads i'd like to pray i'd like to pray with you i invite you to receive him for all that you need all that you need with heads bowed if you need a touch from the lord why don't you with great liberty in your hearts just just lift a hand to him just open up your hearts to him so that here i am open with an open heart a willingness to receive i want it to be very very personal right now those who are the home folk here you know the presence of god that you felt in this place you know the healings that have transpired the miracles that have been taken place the the things that god has done for decades and this in this place i want you to let it all accumulate into your heart for this moment right now for what you have need of the perplexion the desperation the the comfort the healing the salvation the deliverance whatever it is you have need of and come before boldly before the throne of grace say lord i'm pleading i'm coming to you with my heart open just ponder it for a moment please just before we pray we want to give you a chance to ponder these things [Music] lord have mercy just thinking about it now let's bow our heads in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father several dozens of hands raised before you today each one representing something very particular very specific lord i even know that if a husband and wife are raising a hand for the same need that it impacts them differently the consequences are unique to each individual even while we stand today as the body of christ and pray for the same thing we would pray differently and we would express things from a different perspective but lord may we in one mind one heart and one accord now confess that your promises are true we believe that today is the day of the holy ghost that now is the day of salvation that there's still healing in the atonement there's still deliverance in the atonement that there is still an opportunity for loved ones to be saved from sin still an opportunity for us today to be changed from what we were to a new creature in christ jesus and we have an advocate lord even now as we begin to pray that causes things to stir within our hearts and we express things from deep within our hearts groanings lord things that we have need of desires that we have lord i pray today that you meet the needs that are represented by these hands whatever quandary people may find themselves however perplexed they may be whatever guidance they so long for whatever peace that they crave lord may you grant it may none of your children lord be without this blessed peace i pray that salvation would come to those that require those that need it father i pray a blessing upon this this church the mesa church the carpenter family the different believers and loved ones that have gathered together with us today i pray that you bless them supremely comfort their hearts lord give them direction feed their souls renew their vision father pour out your spirit upon them lord the presence that they've experienced the things that they felt may they not only experience maybe a refreshedness and a revival of it but maybe come deeper and richer and more full lord may this experience that they so love and have had may continue lord to lead them and guide them and be their portion and i thank you father that we could be together today to worship and i thank you that this house this place was opened up to us [Music] lord may we have a new perspective on our journey as christians that the house of the lord as it relates to a church building is once again just a type of the house that i am i am the house that we are the dwelling place of god stature of a perfect man we commit ourselves to you now father in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
