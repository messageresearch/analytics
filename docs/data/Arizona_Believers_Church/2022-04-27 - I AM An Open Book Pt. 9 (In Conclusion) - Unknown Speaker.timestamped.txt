[0:00] we're concluding the subject as far as a
[0:02] sermon series on i am an open book
[0:06] now this is the ninth service we've
[0:08] spoke on this and
[0:11] when i thought about it this afternoon
[0:12] this is actually part one
[0:14] in terms of what i originally thought i
[0:16] was going to preach in the first service
[0:18] as the lord was doing with my heart over
[0:20] a number of weeks
[0:22] and months leading up to preaching on
[0:23] this subject these things here tonight
[0:26] is what was the initial inspiration and
[0:28] i'm excited just to share with you this
[0:30] as a capstone to this series
[0:33] in the masterpiece
[0:35] we've been reading this statement it
[0:36] says he fulfilled speaking of jesus
[0:38] christ he fulfilled the old testament
[0:40] now it's the new testament another piece
[0:42] to be fulfilled see the new and the old
[0:46] are husband and wife that's an important
[0:48] concept to catch the new and the older
[0:50] husband and wife and it took the old to
[0:51] foreshadow foreshow the new
[0:53] christ came the masterpiece to fulfill
[0:55] that to fulfill what old testament
[0:58] now his bride will fulfill everything
[1:01] that's in the new testament another
[1:03] masterpiece is in making so to the same
[1:06] extent that you have christ fulfilling
[1:08] the old testament he fulfilled the old
[1:10] testament now there's a new testament
[1:12] which is another piece to be fulfilled
[1:13] that and in the fulfilling of it we can
[1:16] draw then a type and a shadow of how
[1:18] christ fulfilled the written word and
[1:19] the old testament now as wife to christ
[1:23] we are going to fulfill he says
[1:24] everything that's in the new testament
[1:27] another masterpiece in the making and
[1:29] that's been the thrust of the i am an
[1:32] open book jesus christ manifested the
[1:34] written old testament now the bride is
[1:36] the living word of the new testament in
[1:38] a climax in a climactic way in a
[1:40] fulfilling way in a summing way
[1:43] and we begin initially
[1:44] and you can relax a little bit i'm not
[1:46] going to repreach eight services as my
[1:47] conclusion
[1:49] but we begin initially as the i am being
[1:51] god
[1:52] this is the unknown god the invisible
[1:53] god a god that hides himself this is i
[1:56] am the mysterious god but then jesus
[1:58] christ declares that he is the i am
[2:00] before abraham was i am an intentional
[2:04] connection there and so this sealed god
[2:06] even the mystery of the old testament is
[2:08] revealed in jesus christ and so there is
[2:11] this open book in jesus christ before
[2:13] the israelites to whom the scrolls were
[2:15] given and now in the same way it's an
[2:18] open book in his bride the bride is the
[2:20] opening of the new testament
[2:22] she is the manifestation of the written
[2:24] word and we were drawing from these
[2:27] statements and i know you're familiar
[2:28] with them and i realize
[2:30] tonight even the number of places we
[2:32] could have drawn from but we just picked
[2:34] some key ones to refer to but brother
[2:36] ram says in god's power to transform but
[2:38] since the opening of those seven seals
[2:40] of them angels just beyond behind the
[2:42] mountain yonder
[2:44] this has become a new book
[2:47] the bible
[2:48] since the open of the seven seals he
[2:50] says this has become a new book so
[2:52] there's something uh something dynamic
[2:54] that happens when these seals are open
[2:56] or when that prophetic time comes and we
[2:59] could
[3:00] you could kind of get lost in maybe some
[3:02] of the very specific dates and seasons
[3:04] or the times and instances and what were
[3:06] the mechanics what were the mechanics
[3:07] it's just to understand this that the
[3:09] opening of the seals fulfills prophecy
[3:11] of the bible and you enter into a
[3:13] different season of prophetic
[3:15] fulfillment and so you say now in this
[3:17] time when god has revealed these certain
[3:19] things the bible becomes a new book
[3:21] and and kind of what my thesis has been
[3:24] is the bride you as individual members
[3:26] of the body of christ you are the living
[3:27] manifestation of this new book
[3:30] you're what makes it new
[3:32] when christ came fulfilling the old
[3:34] testament it was like wow this is
[3:35] different this is new we didn't think
[3:38] about this we didn't ponder it this way
[3:40] and so he became the interpretation of
[3:42] the written word and now you as a
[3:44] manifestation of the prophecy or the
[3:46] interpretation of the written word
[3:48] and we drew heavily from brother adam
[3:50] speaking in the
[3:52] same day on the seals where he says
[3:53] don't put any interpretation to it don't
[3:55] put any interpretation to it just live a
[3:57] christian life and you realize that's
[3:59] exactly what interpreting means is to
[4:01] live the life and the interpretation is
[4:03] the manifestation
[4:05] now in revelations chapter 5 and and
[4:07] that that's just me
[4:08] just kind of picking up the general
[4:10] theme of what the first several services
[4:11] were on
[4:13] now to try to bring this in conclusion
[4:15] in the scene that we read about in
[4:17] revelations chapter 5 it's introducing
[4:19] this book
[4:21] that brother branham says since the open
[4:22] to those seven seals that the seven
[4:24] seals mentioned here in revelations 5 1
[4:26] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[4:27] sat on the throne a book written within
[4:30] and on the backside sealed with seven
[4:32] seals so revelations 5 1 describes this
[4:35] book it is the book of redemption it
[4:37] even is representative of the entire
[4:39] bible which tells the story of
[4:41] redemption
[4:42] and so it's sealed up it's been written
[4:45] within and on the backside and it's
[4:46] sealed up with seven seals so you could
[4:49] look at this book and say there's some
[4:51] things that are written
[4:52] uh uh and and on the inside written
[4:55] within and and written on the backside
[4:58] and sealed with seven seals so you could
[5:00] even look at the book and say huh maybe
[5:02] someone could discern something by
[5:04] looking on the outside of it but there's
[5:05] no question there's something sealed up
[5:08] on the inside that's not known
[5:11] now brother branham describes this book
[5:13] this way in the breach between the seven
[5:16] church ages and the seven seals it's a
[5:18] very uh
[5:20] descriptive title and informative title
[5:24] by him using this description the breach
[5:26] between the seven church ages and the
[5:28] seven seals what do you what what ought
[5:31] that to clue us in on you have an
[5:33] unfolding of a dispensation which is the
[5:36] seven church ages now he says there's
[5:38] the breach there's a gap there's a space
[5:40] between the seven church ages and the
[5:42] seven seals so it's it's a timing it's
[5:45] dispensations and he says we're standing
[5:47] in the breach between two time periods
[5:51] of the church ages and the seven seals
[5:53] the breach between the two isn't you
[5:55] know uh isn't uh
[5:59] it it is he's specifically standing
[6:01] there as a prophet between these two
[6:03] dispensations and i would say is the
[6:04] keystone to tie them together
[6:06] and so we're coming out of church ages
[6:08] into a capstone into a bride age that's
[6:11] signaled just by this title
[6:13] so he says hold that word redemption
[6:14] until the day that the book of
[6:16] redemption has been revealed and the
[6:18] redeemer comes to claim his possession
[6:21] nothing can do it and he's talking about
[6:22] the seal being broken nothing can break
[6:24] that seal
[6:27] and the seal upon the soul so he says
[6:29] hold that word redemption he says don't
[6:32] grieve it say do things that pleases god
[6:35] for the and this is not the same for the
[6:37] book is sealed now and you are sealed
[6:39] amen
[6:40] this is a very peculiar
[6:42] combination of thoughts
[6:44] to be sealed by the holy ghost but then
[6:46] the book is sealed and he's
[6:48] he's catching something as a prophet to
[6:50] say that and i'll come to these
[6:52] scriptures here in a moment that you're
[6:53] sealed the believer is sealed by the
[6:55] baptismal holy ghost and there's a book
[6:57] in revelations 5 that sealed and this
[6:59] seal is unto the day of redemption and
[7:00] when this book is claimed it's the day
[7:02] of redemption and so there's one leading
[7:04] to the other and the one is connected
[7:05] with the other and the one is for the
[7:07] purpose of the other and the one finds
[7:09] it fulfillment and completion in the
[7:11] other
[7:11] so as a prophet he's trying to bring in
[7:13] this connection between the two and he
[7:15] says the book is sealed now and you were
[7:17] sealed
[7:18] the holy spirit itself is a seal seal
[7:20] signifies a finished work and when the
[7:22] seventh seal is broken the mystery of
[7:25] god that sealed in these mystery
[7:27] mysterious seals is finished
[7:29] and he says until the day that seal is
[7:31] broken then it's revealed what's on the
[7:34] inside of it
[7:35] i catch this language and i've only put
[7:37] up this key phrase there the book is
[7:38] sealed now and you are sealed so he
[7:40] brings those two together but then he
[7:41] says when this whole when the seven
[7:43] seals are broken this mystery
[7:46] is finished and when it's broken the
[7:48] mystery god that's in there
[7:50] is is revealed it's revealed what's on
[7:52] the inside of it so there's a book
[7:54] written on the outside written within
[7:55] but sealed so what's on the inside can't
[7:57] be read
[7:58] and he says when this book is open it
[8:00] reveals what's on the inside of it
[8:02] now the next couple paragraphs he talks
[8:04] about how a seal signifies ownership
[8:08] and when there's a seal placed on
[8:09] something that signifies ownership and
[8:10] he talks about how a seal
[8:12] signifies security so there's a security
[8:15] with the seal security so he's really
[8:16] getting into what the seal means and
[8:18] then he makes this statement again the
[8:20] book is sealed and you are sealed with
[8:22] the book until the day of redemption
[8:26] and so there the book is sealed and then
[8:28] you are sealed so now what what i'm
[8:29] wanting you to kind of catch is if the
[8:31] book is sealed up
[8:33] and then you are sealed what happens
[8:34] when the book is opened
[8:37] so now in ephesians chapter 4 verse 30
[8:39] and this is where brother branham is
[8:43] drawing from it says and grieve not the
[8:44] holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed
[8:48] until the day of redemption
[8:50] so the seal of the holy ghost it's a
[8:53] seal for unto before a purpose you're
[8:56] sealed unto the day of redemption now
[8:58] you don't read it in the sense that well
[9:00] that's as long as the seal lasts because
[9:01] once this day comes it's no good but the
[9:04] seal is for
[9:06] redemption it's for that day it's always
[9:09] it's from the very moment that god
[9:10] poured it out on the day of pentecost it
[9:12] was always forward-looking to the moment
[9:14] of full redemption because at the moment
[9:17] that the soul was sealed any one of
[9:18] those people would have told you there's
[9:20] still another promise of him coming
[9:22] there's still another promise of full
[9:23] redemption there's still a kingdom to be
[9:25] restored there's still there's still
[9:27] promises and prophecies that are yet to
[9:28] be fulfilled so the seal of god wouldn't
[9:31] have been up that's it it's all over
[9:32] we've settled into the millennium and
[9:34] we're just going to outlive all these
[9:36] false believers but no it was always
[9:38] forward-looking
[9:39] until the day of redemption
[9:41] and so the seal of god is for the
[9:43] purpose of bringing you to the fullness
[9:46] it's the earnest of full redemption so
[9:48] in ephesians chapter 1
[9:50] verses 9 to 14
[9:52] let's just read through this how he
[9:54] expresses it earlier in this book he
[9:56] says having made none of us the mystery
[9:57] of his will now he's bringing in the
[9:59] mystery part of it
[10:02] he's made nona to paul the mystery of
[10:03] his will according to his good pleasure
[10:05] which he hath purposed in himself
[10:07] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[10:09] of times he might gather together in one
[10:12] all things in christ so now this is
[10:14] certainly forward-looking right
[10:16] the dispensation of the fullness of
[10:17] times he's going to gather in one all
[10:19] things in christ both which are in
[10:21] heaven
[10:22] and which are on earth even in him this
[10:24] is a union this is things coming
[10:25] together that have been part of this
[10:27] great plan of redemption from the
[10:29] beginning
[10:30] speaking of christ in christ whom also
[10:32] we have obtained an inheritance being
[10:34] predestinated according to the purpose
[10:35] of him who worketh all things after the
[10:38] council of his own will i know these are
[10:39] very heavy heavy heavy words that we
[10:42] would love to you just love to digest
[10:45] and expound upon that we should be to
[10:47] the praise of his glory who first
[10:49] trusted in christ and whom he also
[10:51] trusted after that you have heard the
[10:53] word of truth the gospel of your
[10:55] salvation in whom also after that ye
[10:57] believed you were sealed with that holy
[11:00] spirit of promise what a beautiful
[11:01] scripture after you believed you
[11:05] after you heard the word of god and you
[11:06] believed then you're sealed
[11:09] after faith after believing i know
[11:11] there's some that would conflate the
[11:12] idea that whenever you mentally ascent
[11:14] to the message that gives you the seal
[11:17] but just verbally agreeing with
[11:18] something acknowledging something is not
[11:21] the seal in itself he says after you
[11:23] have believed you were sealed with the
[11:24] holy spirit of promise because the
[11:26] baptism of the holy ghost is a seal of
[11:28] your faith it's a definite experience
[11:31] post faith after believing after
[11:33] accepting it's a definite experience of
[11:35] being born again so it says after you
[11:37] were believed you were sealed with that
[11:38] holy spirit of promise the holy spirit
[11:41] of god you're as he said you're sealed
[11:43] into the day of redemption so paul wrote
[11:44] it in the very beginning of this book
[11:46] you were sealed with the holy spirit of
[11:47] promise which is the earnest of our
[11:49] inheritance until the redemption of the
[11:52] purchased possession unto the praise of
[11:54] his glory
[11:55] and notice how he said that we are um
[11:58] that we should be to the praise of his
[12:00] glory that we have
[12:02] we have been predestined that we should
[12:04] be to the praise of his glory so he's
[12:06] given us the baptism of the holy ghost
[12:08] which is the seal of god which is in
[12:10] earnest of our inheritance until the
[12:14] redemption of the purchased possession
[12:16] because redemption has two parts
[12:18] right the purchase but then the
[12:21] redemption of the purchased possession
[12:23] so it's purchased at calvary but there's
[12:25] a claiming there's a taking of the
[12:27] purchased possession he says unto the
[12:30] praise of his glory this is the what
[12:32] paul is looking forward to we're
[12:33] predestined to be unto his glory
[12:36] when that which is perfect just come and
[12:38] when christ who is our life shall appear
[12:40] and all these other things paul was
[12:42] looking forward to this is something
[12:44] that's outlined here you have the holy
[12:46] ghost it's an earnest it's a guarantee
[12:49] it's a down payment that you will be
[12:51] there on that day amen
[12:53] that's what you should long for young
[12:55] people it's what we should all be
[12:56] certain that we have is this new birth
[12:58] experience
[13:00] and paul and all the saints of all ages
[13:04] look forward to the day of redemption
[13:06] why because it was fullness
[13:08] it's completion
[13:10] in romans chapter 8 verses 22 to 23 paul
[13:12] places it this way and brother branham
[13:15] is also placing these very things
[13:17] in this
[13:18] line of this book is sealed and you are
[13:20] sealed with the book
[13:22] the book is sealed and you are sealed
[13:23] until the day of redemption in romans
[13:26] chapter 8 verses 22 to 23 for we know
[13:28] that the whole creation groaneth and
[13:30] travail and pain together until now and
[13:32] not only they but ourselves also which
[13:34] have the first fruits of the spirit paul
[13:36] just said this a moment ago that uh that
[13:39] who first trusted in christ that we
[13:41] should be to the praise of glory who
[13:42] first trust in christ we're the first
[13:43] ones we're the first church we're the
[13:45] beginning and he says not only does
[13:47] creation grow but we which have the
[13:49] first fruits of the spirit even we
[13:51] ourselves grown within ourselves
[13:54] chained as it were
[13:55] groaning longing desiring
[13:57] not that they would be naked as he says
[13:59] in another place but that we'd be
[14:00] clothed upon that even though our soul
[14:02] is sealed something is held back from us
[14:05] and we're groaning within ourselves
[14:06] waiting for the adoption to with the
[14:09] redemption of our body
[14:11] so though birth into the kingdom of god
[14:13] and baptized into the body of christ by
[14:15] one spirit it birthed with him a living
[14:18] hope that there would come a time of
[14:20] adoption
[14:21] completion
[14:22] perfection fulfillment and he ties this
[14:24] time of adoption to the redemption of
[14:27] our body it's the time of full
[14:29] redemption
[14:31] the day of redemption
[14:35] and this is then
[14:37] the book is sealed you are sealed
[14:40] because the seal is for the purpose of
[14:41] full redemption
[14:43] now in souls that are in prison now
[14:46] we've read this statement before to you
[14:47] but i'm going to take it just a few
[14:48] statements further and i want you to
[14:50] listen to this now he says when the
[14:52] seven seals were opened that opened up
[14:54] the entire bible the seven seals it was
[14:56] sealed to seven mysteries and no seven
[14:58] seals held the entire mystery of it and
[15:00] it was the book of redemption new
[15:02] testament not the old it only proclaimed
[15:05] for the new testament now you do you
[15:07] remember that you remember us reading
[15:08] that a number of times that brother ram
[15:11] says when this bite we opened up the
[15:12] entire bible he said it's it's
[15:15] proclaimed this redemption this book of
[15:17] redemption is proclaimed for the new
[15:18] testament he says they and he
[15:21] immediately says they cannot be made
[15:23] perfect without us hebrews 11.
[15:27] so when he's saying this
[15:29] when he makes that statement that there
[15:30] is a fulfillment to the old testament
[15:32] but now the seven seals open up the
[15:34] entire bible and it proclaims redemption
[15:36] for the new testament he says they
[15:39] without us could not be made perfect
[15:40] hebrews 11. and he says now the
[15:42] redemption only come when the redeemer
[15:44] died and they were potentially under the
[15:47] blood of lambs not the redeemer hadn't
[15:49] been redeemed yet until the redeemer
[15:51] came notice now when this redeemer john
[15:53] looked around
[15:55] let me stop there
[15:57] he's referencing even what took place
[15:59] under the old testament and this is what
[16:02] he's laboring in
[16:04] that under the old testament think of
[16:05] all those believers that died under the
[16:07] blood of bulls and goats but they died
[16:10] believing in the ultimate sacrifice that
[16:12] would come and they're the ones that are
[16:13] impacted on the day of resurrection
[16:16] that that that was it's the remarkable
[16:18] mystery of the seed being one christ and
[16:22] they all believed looking forward to the
[16:24] one who would come
[16:25] have he not received the promise having
[16:27] not received the inheritance having not
[16:29] even seen it but believed it and knew it
[16:31] was a far off that when this one came
[16:33] and he shed his blood it retroactively
[16:36] brought in everyone under the blood of
[16:38] bulls and goats with that faith to
[16:40] believe the one was coming so in this
[16:42] moment it just cascades backwards and
[16:44] redeems all them and on the day of
[16:46] resurrection paradise empties out
[16:48] and there's this a resurrection of the
[16:50] old testament saints who paul is saying
[16:53] they without us could not have been made
[16:54] perfect
[16:56] but now he says john looked around here
[16:58] sat on the throne with the book in his
[17:00] hand that had been sealed with seven
[17:01] seals and the whole plan of redemption
[17:03] was in it and it had been lost by the
[17:06] human race adam
[17:08] now he's bringing us into he's bringing
[17:10] revelations 5 into view
[17:12] and he's saying it's the just it's not
[17:14] just one part but it's the whole book of
[17:17] redemption that's laying there and he
[17:19] says it proclaims it for the new
[17:21] testament hebrews 11 they without us
[17:23] could not be made perfect
[17:25] so in hebrews chapter 11 verses 39 and
[17:27] 40
[17:29] and these all if you go back read
[17:31] hebrews 11 by faith then it goes through
[17:33] this whole list
[17:34] paul says and these all having obtained
[17:36] a good report through faith received not
[17:38] the promise
[17:40] but still faithful still had faith
[17:43] god having provided some better thing
[17:46] for us
[17:47] all right
[17:48] all right paul
[17:50] you know humble yourself a little bit
[17:51] but paul is being honest hey god
[17:53] provided some better thing for us
[17:56] not despising any day gone by not
[17:58] despising the manifestation
[18:00] and the foreshadowing the types of
[18:01] christ but he's saying god having
[18:03] provided some better thing for us that
[18:06] they without us should not be made
[18:08] perfect what a remarkable statement
[18:10] abraham without this group could be made
[18:12] perfect and and job and david and all
[18:15] these other patriarchs and fathers they
[18:17] were not perfect without it that's just
[18:19] what paul's saying amen
[18:21] but notice how brother branham picks up
[18:22] on it and you see the compound
[18:24] fulfillment
[18:26] the statue of perfect man he reads
[18:27] hebrews 11 he says you get it these
[18:30] people who died in here
[18:32] he reads this very verse verse 40. these
[18:34] people who died in here are depending
[18:36] and waiting on us
[18:38] so this church has got to come to
[18:40] perfection in order to bring the
[18:42] resurrection
[18:44] what does it mean that they without us
[18:46] should not be made perfect today in our
[18:48] time in this compound fulfillment the
[18:50] church today has got to come to
[18:52] perfection in order to bring the
[18:54] resurrection and they are under souls
[18:56] under the altar waiting for this church
[18:57] to come to its perfection so they who
[19:00] have already gone on the saints of all
[19:01] ages even in this layout of the same age
[19:03] all the people who've gone on are
[19:05] waiting for this time when the bride
[19:07] will come into a perfection for
[19:09] resurrection and they without us without
[19:11] the capstone without the great climax of
[19:14] redemption of the body are not made
[19:16] perfect either
[19:18] and he says the church has to come to
[19:20] its perfection
[19:21] in the message desperations he says
[19:23] every age has followed that to see that
[19:26] it's brought forth and they could not be
[19:28] made perfect without us
[19:31] and he says and now the entire holy
[19:33] spirit visits the church making god in
[19:35] human flesh
[19:38] what
[19:40] now the entire holy spirit visits the
[19:42] church making god in human flesh
[19:45] this is the this is the eden after he
[19:47] preaches the token let's tune in to this
[19:49] dispensational change let's recognize
[19:51] what he's wanting us to catch as
[19:53] believers every age that followed it
[19:55] brought forth something he says and they
[19:56] they all these other ages could not be
[19:58] made perfect without us because this is
[20:00] the time where the entire holy spirit
[20:02] visits the church what does it produce
[20:05] god in flesh again
[20:07] and you'll find many many statements
[20:09] just as it was in his for the days of
[20:10] his flesh just whereas he walked the
[20:12] shores of galilee he's doing it again
[20:14] today it's the reveal of the son of man
[20:16] he continues in all things that he
[20:18] hasn't done down through the ages and
[20:19] the church ages he is now doing back to
[20:22] the word because the messages and the
[20:24] messages and the messages have to wind
[20:25] up in the entire world
[20:28] and in the last days the seven seals
[20:30] being opened was to pick up every
[20:31] straggle that's been left off in it and
[20:33] make the whole thing in one great big
[20:35] body of the bride did you catch that
[20:38] what's the whole point of opening the
[20:39] seals what's the whole point of tying
[20:40] together loose ends to lift up a man to
[20:42] to revere to become branhamites uh to
[20:45] baptize the name of william branham to
[20:47] sit around waiting for brother brown to
[20:48] come back no every straggle has made up
[20:51] the whole thing into one great big body
[20:53] of the bride that them who lived back
[20:56] there were not perfect until this church
[20:58] be perfected and this bright group in
[21:01] the last days to bring them in and all
[21:03] together be taken up
[21:05] wow that's what this is all for
[21:07] that's why it matters how you live can
[21:09] you imagine no pressure
[21:11] but all the saints through all the ages
[21:13] come on get it right
[21:15] live the life right live the life please
[21:17] live the life because we're waiting on
[21:19] you
[21:21] them back there who lived were not
[21:22] perfect until this bride is perfected
[21:24] this bride group in the last days it
[21:25] brings them in
[21:27] we all together are taken up
[21:30] and this is where brother ma'am orients
[21:32] this promise they that without us could
[21:33] not be made perfect the bride has to
[21:35] come into her perfection well how in the
[21:37] world is this going to happen he says
[21:38] it's the time when the holy s the seals
[21:40] are open the entire holy spirit visits
[21:42] the church
[21:44] so now to use this an example in
[21:46] scripture because paul says grieve not
[21:48] the holy spirit why be whereby you are
[21:50] sealed into the day of redemption
[21:52] this has a very
[21:54] paul is using a language that would have
[21:55] not been foreign to a jew
[21:58] because they had laws of redemption
[22:00] they had cycles of redemption they had
[22:02] rules in which the land would not be
[22:04] sold forever
[22:06] and it's written into their laws to
[22:08] where if if something was sold a person
[22:11] sold to property because they owed a
[22:12] debt or they had to do something they
[22:14] had a way where ultimately that would be
[22:15] brought back into the family they would
[22:17] redeem it again and they had laws of
[22:19] marriage and they had rules because the
[22:21] land belonged to them and though it
[22:22] could be sold for a season ultimately it
[22:25] was always redemption we're going to get
[22:26] it back it's ours it's ours there's a
[22:27] way to get it back so to say that
[22:30] something is sealed under the day of
[22:31] redemption that meant something to a jew
[22:33] that to us when i say it to you you just
[22:36] think about the seal upon your soul
[22:37] right nobody can see it but you know
[22:39] it's there and it's it's hidden there
[22:41] it's sealed it's sunken into this body
[22:43] and it's it's hidden it's a hidden seal
[22:45] down inside and i know it speaks of
[22:47] redemption and nobody may know it's
[22:49] there but i know it's there and it's
[22:50] sealed nobody can break it nobody can
[22:52] tamper with it the devil can't get to it
[22:53] and then on the day of redemption it's
[22:55] going to bring me to the fullness and
[22:56] it's all going to be given back to me
[22:58] brand new body and that's the way we
[22:59] think but to a jew
[23:01] they would be thinking about the
[23:02] promises in the old testament
[23:05] and paul i believe is even be very
[23:06] precise to follow the language in
[23:08] jeremiah chapter 32.
[23:10] and i'll read verses 6 to 15 to you and
[23:12] kind of just expound upon it a little
[23:14] bit we're making really really good time
[23:16] tonight
[23:17] it says in jeremiah said the word of the
[23:18] lord came unto me saying behold
[23:21] hannemuil the son of shalom thine uncle
[23:23] shall come unto thee saying by thee my
[23:26] field that is in nanathoth for the right
[23:28] of redemption is thine to buy it so
[23:30] here's a
[23:32] jeremiah
[23:34] has a right to buy this field with
[23:36] within the family or right to redeem it
[23:37] so hannah meal
[23:38] my uncle son came to me in the court of
[23:41] the prison according to the word of the
[23:42] lord instead of me it happens exactly
[23:44] like god said it would by my field i
[23:46] pray thee that is in anathoth which is
[23:49] in the country of benjamin
[23:52] for the right of inheritance is thine
[23:55] and the redemption is thine
[23:57] buy it for thyself
[23:59] so jeremiah had the right of inheritance
[24:01] and he had the right to redemption
[24:03] remember paul uses the language which is
[24:04] the redemption which is the earnest of
[24:07] our inheritance until the redemption of
[24:08] the purchase possession and how we have
[24:11] obtained an inheritance being
[24:12] predestinated and he's using this same
[24:14] language the right of inheritance and
[24:16] the right of redemption is thine buy it
[24:18] for thyself then i knew that this was
[24:20] the word of the lord and i bought the
[24:22] field of hannah meal
[24:24] my uncle's son that was in hanov and
[24:27] weighed him the money even 17 shackles
[24:29] of silver and i subscribed the evidence
[24:33] and sealed it and took witnesses and
[24:36] weighed him the money in the balances
[24:39] i i want to describe this before i need
[24:41] to read the next verse but here this is
[24:43] this is the closing anybody ever been to
[24:45] a closing
[24:46] thankfully in these days we're not
[24:48] counting out dollar bills
[24:49] uh to get to the uh to close on a house
[24:52] especially with the monopoly money
[24:53] they're playing with these days with the
[24:55] houses that are being sold things
[24:56] california
[24:57] but uh this is a closing and what
[25:00] happens is there's two deeds in this
[25:02] closing so i subscribe the evidence so
[25:04] something is being subscribed written
[25:06] down i subscribed it and then i sealed
[25:08] it i took witnesses weighed the money so
[25:10] everyone's witnessing the transaction
[25:12] it's in the presence of all these in the
[25:13] court
[25:14] as it were for the prison and hera
[25:16] here's the money here's the subscription
[25:18] things are being signed be witness and
[25:20] sealed and what would take place is two
[25:21] deeds would be written
[25:23] and the original was sealed but then the
[25:25] other there was another copy which had
[25:27] held less authority but yet it still had
[25:29] some authority but it wasn't as great as
[25:31] the sealed copy
[25:33] so one copy had authority and you relied
[25:35] upon it but if this other copy ever was
[25:38] questioned you'd break the seal on the
[25:39] original
[25:41] and you and you would compare it and
[25:43] that would be the final answer
[25:45] and so they say in some cases that the
[25:47] sealed copy contained more details about
[25:49] the conditions the time of redemption um
[25:51] certain particulars so that you could
[25:52] always test the veracity of a witness
[25:55] and say oh you said it was this you said
[25:57] it was that well let's just go ahead and
[25:58] open up the original and unseal it and
[26:00] if you said it was 100 shekels and the
[26:02] document says it was 17
[26:04] you you you're found out to be a liar
[26:07] so there's this so that the copy if the
[26:10] copy which had authority was ever
[26:12] questioned the sealed copy would be
[26:14] unsealed before judge
[26:17] amen
[26:19] so he says in verse 11 so i took the
[26:21] evidence of the purchase
[26:23] both that which was sealed according to
[26:25] the law and custom and that which was
[26:27] open
[26:28] so he took a sealed copy and he took an
[26:30] open copy and i gave the evidence of the
[26:33] purchase under baruch the son of neriah
[26:35] and the son of messiah in the sight of
[26:37] hannah mill my uncle's son and in the
[26:40] presence of the witnesses that
[26:41] subscribed the book of the perches
[26:45] before all the jews that sat in the
[26:47] court of the prison do you realize that
[26:48] revelations 5 describes almost the exact
[26:52] same scene in terms of in the presence
[26:54] of all the elders in the presences of
[26:56] witnesses in the court of the prison
[26:58] this transaction is being sealed and we
[27:00] fast forward in revelations chapter five
[27:02] this isn't a an odd uh collection of
[27:05] individuals to a jew this would have
[27:07] been like wow that looks exactly like
[27:09] the way we conducted business back in
[27:11] the day
[27:13] take and he says he says in all the jews
[27:15] that sat in the court of the prison and
[27:17] i charged baruch saying thus saith the
[27:19] lord of hosts the god of israel listen
[27:21] what he says take these evidences
[27:24] the evidence of the purchase both which
[27:26] is sealed and this evidence which is
[27:28] open and put them in an earthen vessel
[27:32] that they may continue many days
[27:35] oh
[27:36] he says take this which is open which is
[27:38] understood which has been declared if i
[27:41] could just go ahead and say that part of
[27:43] the book which is christ which is open
[27:45] which we receive
[27:47] by the word of god in this new testament
[27:49] take that but then there's this other
[27:50] part that is sealed and he says place it
[27:52] in an earthen vessel that it may last
[27:55] many days
[27:56] because the purpose of the earth and
[27:58] vessel that itself being enclosed was to
[28:01] preserve the evidence through time
[28:03] if there was a flood if there was a fire
[28:05] if there was the siege they wanted this
[28:06] to survive
[28:08] any any any uh disaster any kind of
[28:12] uh
[28:13] siege of the enemy they wanted this
[28:15] evidence to survive why because it must
[28:17] be redeemed
[28:19] this can't be lost it doesn't matter if
[28:21] enemies come the floods come if fires
[28:23] come this must stand because one day you
[28:26] having the right of inheritance and the
[28:28] right of redemption you have this right
[28:31] yourself then it must be the land will
[28:34] not be sold forever it must come back to
[28:37] its rightful owner
[28:39] it's gotta come back to whom it's
[28:41] promised to
[28:42] so he says seal it up put an earthen
[28:44] vessel then it might survive many days
[28:47] amen so that which was hid in the earth
[28:49] sealed in these vessels
[28:51] was a token of
[28:53] and and i realized now
[28:55] that
[28:56] it should take much more time just to
[28:58] connect this into their captivity
[28:59] because the whole purpose of this is it
[29:01] was a token of their deliverance right
[29:04] it was a token that they were coming
[29:06] back to the land that they had lost
[29:10] you wouldn't sell something
[29:11] let's just think about it in terms of
[29:13] of what's literally taking place i could
[29:16] say well
[29:17] i've got a i've got a plot of land on
[29:18] mars i'll sell you
[29:20] how much money are you gonna be willing
[29:21] to pay for land on mars
[29:27] are you thinking about it i mean
[29:30] so i guess we have bought certificates
[29:31] right where we own a star we own
[29:33] something how much did you pay for that
[29:35] and how how realistic was it that one
[29:37] day i'm going to build a house on mars
[29:39] the whole transaction only makes sense
[29:43] if one day it's going to be possessed
[29:44] again
[29:46] so this very transaction spoke we're
[29:49] coming back one day
[29:50] this whole time that we're going to
[29:52] spend in captivity in babylon babylon's
[29:55] going to lose its power one day babylon
[29:58] is going to lose its hold one day we're
[29:59] going to hear a voice calling us out of
[30:01] babylon and we're going to go right back
[30:03] to the land that was ours that was
[30:05] promised to us and we're going to
[30:06] possess the land in its fullness again
[30:11] so there was a
[30:12] these sealed vessels were in evidence
[30:16] that a day of redemption would come
[30:18] for it says it in verse 15 for thus
[30:20] saith the lord of hosts the god of
[30:21] israel houses and fields and vineyards
[30:23] shall be possessed again in this land
[30:26] that's what this whole transaction meant
[30:28] so you realize when paul is using the
[30:29] language of inheritance
[30:31] and being sealed into the day of
[30:33] redemption
[30:34] and being predestined to be an
[30:36] inheritance and earnest of an
[30:37] inheritance until the redemption of the
[30:39] purchase possession that's exactly what
[30:40] jeremiah did he purchased it
[30:43] he had paid the price so what he does is
[30:45] he takes that which is open and he puts
[30:47] an earthen vessel but then there's
[30:48] another part that's sealed and he puts
[30:50] it in earth vessel he said this is going
[30:51] to stand as a witness until one day i
[30:54] can claim what i've already purchased
[30:56] so it's a perfect reflection of what
[30:58] christ did on calvary where he pays the
[31:00] price but he says one day i'm going to
[31:02] come back and claim it and until then
[31:04] what i'm going to do is i'm going to put
[31:06] a seal in earthen vessels and they're
[31:09] going to be a witness and a testimony
[31:11] that one day i'll come back and claim it
[31:13] all
[31:15] amen
[31:16] and it says in second corinthians
[31:18] chapter four verses six to seven i know
[31:20] i'm doing on something a little bit
[31:21] different with the slides but i wanted
[31:22] to encourage you all to bring your
[31:24] bibles and read them
[31:26] flip those pages around just we'll have
[31:28] to start taking allergy pills be so much
[31:30] dust
[31:31] kicking up in here as we start using
[31:32] these old bibles again
[31:34] but in second corinthians chapter four
[31:35] verses six to seven as you're turning
[31:37] there hopefully you can see this it'll
[31:39] just stand out to you for god who
[31:41] commanded the light to shine out of
[31:42] darkness hath shined in our hearts so
[31:45] now there's an examination coming to
[31:47] give the light of the knowledge of the
[31:48] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[31:51] now
[31:51] think about this in our day what did
[31:53] brother branham say child of my when you
[31:55] look into this bible
[31:56] you're looking at me face to face
[31:59] what is it that was declared in the
[32:00] cloud it was the face it's the
[32:02] countenance
[32:03] it's it's a face-to-face connection
[32:06] that's being made and then shall we know
[32:08] as also i am unknown and and then shall
[32:10] we see face to face there's a even a
[32:12] prophetic element to this and notice the
[32:14] language he uses in verse 7 but we have
[32:16] this treasure
[32:18] in earthen vessels
[32:21] that the excellency of the power may be
[32:22] of god and not of us
[32:24] what a language he's using
[32:26] we have this treasure in earth and
[32:28] vessels that the excellency of the power
[32:30] may be of god and none of us what is
[32:32] this treasure in this earth and vessel
[32:34] it's the earnest of full redemption what
[32:37] is this treasure that we have in this
[32:39] earth and vessel it is something that is
[32:41] a seal of god upon the soul the earnest
[32:44] of our inheritance until the redemption
[32:46] of the purchased possession under the
[32:48] praise of his glory that is what we have
[32:50] in these
[32:51] earth and vessels and it's a language
[32:53] that hearkens back to jeremiah 32 that
[32:55] there was a seal placed upon this and it
[32:58] was deposited into an earthen vessel
[33:00] that it would stand within the earth and
[33:02] vessel that the price has been paid and
[33:05] redemption is coming
[33:09] what is this treasure it's the evidence
[33:12] it's the earnest of redemption until
[33:15] the day
[33:16] of redemption
[33:20] until the day of redemption
[33:22] so then we come to revelations chapter 5
[33:23] verse 7.
[33:28] because there's a book that sealed and i
[33:29] know i skipped a little bit because john
[33:31] john is crying
[33:33] he's he's weeping he wept much
[33:36] verse 4 no because no one was found
[33:38] worthy and so john is moved by this
[33:40] you might think well
[33:43] why was john john is he just a softy i
[33:46] mean like why does he always cry when we
[33:48] talk about this sealed book
[33:50] and and john is crying and weeping john
[33:53] understands the scene
[33:55] john john gets what's happening here
[33:57] it's as if it were as if we were before
[33:59] a judge and there's been a claim made
[34:02] and now now there's been a dispute about
[34:04] the claim satan's an accuser there's
[34:06] been a dispute there's been an
[34:07] accusation somebody's challenged the
[34:09] title the chain of title through the
[34:10] church ages and so now john is saying
[34:12] this is fine we had a plan for this in
[34:14] the old testament there was a way that
[34:16] we would resolve this we would go back
[34:17] to the original document and we would
[34:19] unloose it and we would settle it and
[34:21] john's sent up there and there's this
[34:22] seal oh and john's thinking oh perfect
[34:24] this is great this is going to settle it
[34:26] it says well no one's worthy to open it
[34:27] john says wait a minute wait a minute
[34:30] i know the price was paid i know this is
[34:33] ours i know that these things we have
[34:35] the right to this and this is a very
[34:37] moving time for him and then it says in
[34:39] verse 7 and he came who is it the lamb
[34:42] he came and took the book out of the
[34:44] right hymn that sat upon the throne
[34:47] what's taking place the kinsmen redeemer
[34:49] claiming the title deed for what the
[34:51] entire human race because brother brahm
[34:53] said it's this book was the whole plan
[34:55] of redemption that had been lost by the
[34:57] human race when adam fell the book was
[35:00] taken away from him where did it go not
[35:02] to satan it went back to god in heaven
[35:04] on the throne and the book has been
[35:06] waiting there until this very time
[35:09] here's this book that they all thought
[35:10] was coming back in the days when christ
[35:12] came the first time he's going to set up
[35:14] his kingdom upon earth this is the time
[35:15] the messiah is going to restore all
[35:17] things but now this scene that is taking
[35:19] place brother says the most sublime
[35:21] thing in scripture
[35:22] called the sublime act
[35:24] sublime means the highest most supreme
[35:26] it cannot be excelled
[35:29] this is what he's saying this moment
[35:30] cannot be excelled
[35:33] because he's going to loosen something
[35:34] that's been sealed
[35:36] he's going to uh
[35:37] un loose something that has been bound
[35:42] he's going to open up something that's
[35:43] been hidden he's going to reveal
[35:44] something that's been a mystery
[35:47] are you are you following me so far
[35:49] in this i'm i'm super
[35:52] super inspired
[35:53] this evening
[35:55] and fees to the trumpets
[35:56] he says while this group down here has
[35:58] got two thousand bound
[36:00] at the river euphrates
[36:02] and he's talking about the two hundred
[36:03] thousand thousand demons loose at the
[36:05] river euphrates
[36:07] under the seal and he says it's been
[36:09] bound for two thousand years he says
[36:11] also this is the parliamentary catch
[36:12] also that church has been bound the holy
[36:14] ghost for nearly 2 000 years
[36:17] under martyrdom back there and under the
[36:19] church ages
[36:21] and it's been bound not at the river
[36:23] euphrates but at the door of creeds and
[36:25] dogmas that the holy spirit can't work
[36:27] in the church because of man-made
[36:28] systems
[36:29] but she's going to be liberated
[36:32] she's coming back that's what the bible
[36:34] said
[36:36] so there's what a curious statement the
[36:38] holy ghost the church has bound the holy
[36:41] ghost for nearly 2 000 years
[36:43] so under the church ages there's a
[36:45] holding back of even the holy ghost
[36:47] remember he said in desperations now the
[36:49] entire holy spirit visits the church
[36:52] making god in human flesh he's saying
[36:53] there's been something held back through
[36:55] the church ages
[36:57] you can almost see and i say almost
[37:00] and i'm always very careful on trying to
[37:02] pinpoint these definitive moments where
[37:04] something shifts or transitions as if
[37:06] you can kind of bright line test it was
[37:08] at this very second on this very day
[37:10] but the church ages really don't start
[37:13] until the church at ephesus leaves its
[37:15] first love
[37:17] that that's how you even enter into a
[37:19] cycle of church age because church ages
[37:21] revival and death revival and death so
[37:22] once they start to begin to lose their
[37:24] first love and the holy the antichrist
[37:26] begins to work against the church that's
[37:28] what kind of enters us into this
[37:30] dispensation where paul has to step in
[37:32] even almost as one who is correcting a
[37:34] church already and it's air
[37:37] and trying to establish things correctly
[37:39] that antichrist coming in right away he
[37:41] says now the holy ghost has been bound
[37:44] he said oh does that mean the holy ghost
[37:45] wasn't a church no
[37:47] because he says it was in the church
[37:49] christ was in the church but he's saying
[37:50] there's something representing this
[37:52] symbolism something representing this
[37:53] language but he says but she is going to
[37:55] be liberated
[37:57] that's what the bible says she's going
[37:58] to be liberated he says in paragraph 232
[38:00] the holy spirit has been bound by the
[38:02] denominations all these two thousand
[38:03] years
[38:04] issues and feast of the trumpets
[38:05] paragraph 242 and the same seal when it
[38:07] was opened to show jesus on the outside
[38:09] of the church trying to get back in
[38:11] think about that language that visual
[38:13] he says
[38:15] at the same time the trumpet sounds for
[38:16] the jews and the jews recognize the
[38:18] atonement glory hallelujah oh my he says
[38:20] the holy spirit had has been bound by
[38:22] these denominations for almost 2 000
[38:25] years but is to be loosed in the evening
[38:28] time by the evening time message the
[38:30] holy spirit back in the church again
[38:32] christ himself revealed in human flesh
[38:35] in the evening time he said it he
[38:37] promised it
[38:39] this is a remarkable statement this is
[38:40] very clear
[38:42] it's plain language what he's saying i
[38:43] think the mystery of it is very deep
[38:46] and profound so i'm not trying to make
[38:47] light of it but he's saying something
[38:49] the holy spirit's been bound for nearly
[38:51] 2 000 years denominations have been
[38:52] holding them back the church has been
[38:54] holding them back it gets to the end
[38:55] time where you find out that now christ
[38:57] is finally
[38:58] excommunicated
[39:00] so the process of holding them back is a
[39:02] weaning away from the word from the word
[39:04] of slight deviation in the beginning
[39:06] leaving thy first love results in the
[39:07] culmination of a complete and total
[39:09] blackout of the church in christ on the
[39:11] outside of it but he says she's to be
[39:12] liberated in the last days
[39:14] what the bride is going to know her mate
[39:16] he says in this message the revealed
[39:18] word
[39:19] and she's going to be liberating the
[39:21] last days and the holy spirit's going to
[39:22] be back in the church again christ
[39:24] himself revealed in human flesh why
[39:26] because the evening time message is to
[39:28] liberate her
[39:31] and this is what's happening when he
[39:33] comes and takes the book
[39:36] and so revelations now i know there's i
[39:39] know that i might just be kind of
[39:40] putting out there and it might seem to
[39:41] just kind of be in the void
[39:43] but i i believe your spiritual minds can
[39:45] grab that
[39:46] got to hold that and connect it to so
[39:48] much of the teaching in this word of god
[39:51] that this something bound remember the
[39:53] book was sealed
[39:54] and you were sealed
[39:56] but in the last stage she's going to be
[39:58] liberated
[39:59] this is i am an open book
[40:02] the book was sealed i was sealed when
[40:03] the book was opened i'm opened
[40:06] i'm liberated this is your liberation
[40:09] this is your jubilee
[40:10] this is your day of redemption
[40:13] any dispute or claim that the devil's
[40:15] there saying oh he didn't purchase it no
[40:16] he didn't do it no he didn't do it and
[40:18] he said well the bible says the bible
[40:20] says and so what does he start doing he
[40:21] starts taking issue with the what the
[40:22] written word says right oh no it doesn't
[40:24] quite say that no it doesn't say that it
[40:26] doesn't say that so god god has
[40:27] something that was already sealed up
[40:30] we'll let that which is sealed be the
[40:32] final vindication we'll let that which
[40:33] is sealed be the final evidence in the
[40:35] final testimony
[40:37] and so john the one that had been
[40:38] weeping
[40:40] what he witnesses and remember again
[40:42] john is going to be emotional because
[40:44] he's tied to the he knows this he sees
[40:47] this lamb having paid the price he
[40:50] understands the significance of the
[40:52] scene of the throne room and the elders
[40:54] this is proof this is evidence this is
[40:56] vindication this is this is when it's
[40:58] all comes down and the final proof is
[41:00] given
[41:01] and in that moment he said weep not for
[41:03] the line of the tribe of judas prevailed
[41:05] to take the book and to loose the seals
[41:07] thereof
[41:08] and he looks and he sees the lamb
[41:11] and he and certainly at this point
[41:13] there's something begins to stir up
[41:14] inside of him he's like yes of course
[41:16] it'd be the lamb because he's the one
[41:18] that paid the price just as jeremiah
[41:21] paid 17 shekels of silver he's the one
[41:23] that paid the price the one that paid
[41:25] the price he knows what's in the
[41:26] subscription he knows what's sealed up
[41:28] in there he's the one that paid for it
[41:30] he knows redemption is paid for and says
[41:33] and he came and took the book and he
[41:35] loosed the seals thereof and this is
[41:37] john's response verse 13 and every
[41:40] creature which is in heaven and on earth
[41:42] and under the earth and such as are in
[41:43] the sea and all that are in them heard i
[41:46] say it i want you to recognize
[41:48] that john uses the language to describe
[41:51] everything that would have been in
[41:52] creation and everything that is
[41:54] connected with the earth that which is
[41:56] in heaven and on earth under the earth
[41:58] in the sea and in them heard eyes saying
[42:00] this is something that is resounding
[42:02] within heaven something that is
[42:04] resounding upon earth it brings us all
[42:06] the way back to genesis 1 1 in the
[42:08] beginning god created the heaven and the
[42:10] earth and now at the time of the
[42:12] redemption of the whole thing the whole
[42:14] earth is going to hear a redeemed son of
[42:17] god proclaim something
[42:19] blessing and honor and glory and power
[42:22] be unto him that sitteth upon the throne
[42:24] and unto the lamb forever and ever
[42:27] hallelujah
[42:29] what a what a proclamation of redemption
[42:36] and brother branham
[42:38] makes some statements about this that
[42:40] are so enlightening
[42:41] i know you've heard them before so we're
[42:43] just enjoying ourselves tonight
[42:45] rehearsing things that we already know
[42:48] brother man says you know that got next
[42:50] to you john
[42:51] i mean he because he gets happy he he he
[42:53] throws it throws into a jubilee this guy
[42:55] who's crying you ever met somebody who's
[42:56] like you know i just don't understand
[42:58] that why this is happening and all of a
[43:00] sudden they just switch from crying to
[43:02] completely even killed well it's almost
[43:04] john sitting there weeping and weeping
[43:06] and weeping the next moment you know
[43:07] he's dancing he's shouting he's
[43:08] rejoicing he got next to himself
[43:10] burma said he said brother said he must
[43:12] have seen his name written there
[43:17] when those seals broke he must have got
[43:19] real happy
[43:21] when the seals opened on the book
[43:24] john got happy but why did he get happy
[43:26] he must have he says he must have saw
[43:28] his name wrote there
[43:31] when the seals are open john
[43:34] got happy
[43:35] because he saw
[43:36] his name written there
[43:39] and he says in the same message talk
[43:40] about a happy time when the seals broke
[43:43] john must have looked in
[43:46] seen past the curtain of time he saw
[43:48] past this veil john looked past the
[43:50] curtain of time and said
[43:52] there's john
[43:55] so what did john see when he looked into
[43:58] the open book
[44:00] he saw himself in the open book and he
[44:03] says and that's what made him happy
[44:05] it's one thing to look in the book and
[44:07] see christ it's one thing to look in the
[44:08] book and maybe see william branham it's
[44:10] one thing to look at and see the
[44:12] vindication through the ages but if any
[44:14] time the veil is torn and you can look
[44:17] into this word of god and see yourself
[44:19] that's when you really get happy that's
[44:21] your jubilee that's your revival that's
[44:24] your rejoicing that's your liberation
[44:28] he must have saw his name well it was
[44:30] more than a name it was an identity it
[44:32] was a character it was himself he didn't
[44:35] just look and say john john how many
[44:37] johns do we know almost there's so many
[44:38] john's john who john who i know a
[44:40] million john's in my family no he saw
[44:43] himself it wasn't just a name it was an
[44:45] identity it was a picture he saw himself
[44:49] and that's why he got happy
[44:52] oh you say brother you're getting beside
[44:54] yourself
[44:56] i'm excited about what john saw
[45:00] i'm excited about what aaron sees
[45:03] now because this is more this isn't john
[45:05] in his day getting a sneak peek at the
[45:07] photo album
[45:08] isn't that what happens when you get
[45:09] your family pictures taken you always
[45:10] want to get a little sneak peek
[45:12] you don't want to wait till they're done
[45:13] photoshopping even though you should
[45:15] all those filters it's a miracle what
[45:18] they do wedding photos you want to know
[45:19] kind of what they look like and you want
[45:21] to kind of see it but there comes a time
[45:23] when it's going to be it's going to be
[45:25] presented
[45:27] oh
[45:28] this perfect picture john saw himself
[45:30] there's other perfect pictures
[45:33] you're in this book
[45:35] and what john was saying is something
[45:36] that's end time related
[45:38] now i'm going to read a statement to you
[45:40] and i want you to be very focused now
[45:42] because what brother brown says here you
[45:44] could you could hear it you could read
[45:45] it and skip right over i'm not saying
[45:47] you have
[45:48] but it could be very easy to do it
[45:50] he says then he come forth and took the
[45:52] book out of the right hand of him that
[45:54] sat upon the throne
[45:56] and time was no more
[45:58] now if you read revelations
[46:00] chapter five
[46:02] verse seven
[46:04] it doesn't say anything
[46:06] about time being no more
[46:08] but brother branham to connect it says
[46:10] and immediately an angel appeared and
[46:13] the 10th chapter and the seventh verse
[46:17] so what happens
[46:18] revelations 5 7 comes to revelations 10
[46:21] 7.
[46:23] this is immediately what happens when
[46:24] this happens there's a coming together
[46:26] or you could say revelations 10 7 it
[46:28] comes to revelations 5 7 but somehow
[46:30] immediately when this book is taken and
[46:33] broken open and that seal is open
[46:35] immediately an angel appears to the
[46:37] angel of revelations 10 7.
[46:39] saying this angel come down and swore
[46:42] the time was no longer you see in this
[46:44] book what was was what was redeemed in
[46:46] this book was what was redeemed in this
[46:48] sealed book was what was redeemed it was
[46:49] the book of redemption and everything
[46:51] had been redeemed was in that book and
[46:54] all that he died for was written in that
[46:56] book
[46:56] what did he say in christ the mystery
[46:58] god revealed all that's in the book is
[47:00] the believer because that's him
[47:03] amen
[47:04] and somehow
[47:06] this this beautiful connection is made
[47:08] revelations 5 7 comes to revelations 10
[47:10] 7 why because it's he says time is no no
[47:13] longer he connects the two together
[47:16] does he not teach in the breach that
[47:17] their seventh angel messenger is on the
[47:19] earth at the time of revelations 10 1
[47:22] he's not on the earth at the time of
[47:24] this coming
[47:25] i'm telling you these things we could
[47:26] say in one sense is historical
[47:29] we've got to recognize these things
[47:32] as being very relevant for us
[47:35] so john when the book was open saul
[47:36] himself
[47:38] and then in a parallel immediately
[47:40] what's this now comes to revelations 10
[47:42] 7 the books come back down to earth
[47:46] and the angel seventh angel messenger
[47:47] revelations 10 7 and the days of the
[47:49] voice of the seventh angel and he shall
[47:50] begin to sound the mystery god should be
[47:51] finished
[47:52] the bride is the final manifestation of
[47:54] god
[47:55] as he has declared to his servants the
[47:57] prophets beautiful mystery being
[47:58] fulfilled and verse 8 and the voice
[48:00] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[48:02] again saying go and take the little book
[48:04] which is opened in the hand of the angel
[48:07] which stands upon the sea and upon the
[48:08] earth i know we've gone to great lengths
[48:10] to examine these you know in the
[48:12] beginnings here of this church
[48:14] and the and the only thing that's taken
[48:16] only difference now is john's heard the
[48:18] seven thunders and this mystery now
[48:21] gives him a right the one who wasn't
[48:22] allowed to even look on it
[48:25] right nobody said
[48:27] no one was worthy to loose it neither to
[48:28] look on it and so no one's found worthy
[48:31] and the next thing we know after it's
[48:33] open john all of a sudden is worthy
[48:36] john not only can look at it but he can
[48:38] touch it
[48:39] right not only can he look at it but he
[48:42] can go and ask for it
[48:44] right he can actually go to the one that
[48:47] has the book open and say let me have
[48:49] the book and somebody said hey whoa whoa
[48:50] whoa slow down a minute john you're not
[48:52] even allowed to look at it let alone
[48:54] touch it but now something has changed
[48:56] he's been liberated now he can actually
[48:59] go to this open book why because it
[49:01] opened up the mystery of who had a right
[49:04] to it
[49:04] as long as it was sealed there could be
[49:06] things written on the outside and you're
[49:07] just not quite sure who it is whosoever
[49:09] will and it's kind of written in a
[49:10] cryptic way everyone can read it it's
[49:12] the book that's open but there's another
[49:14] part that's sealed that's been down
[49:16] hidden inside these earthen vessels but
[49:17] the time of the opening of this book
[49:19] there's a vindication that comes forth
[49:22] and john who had that right of
[49:24] inheritance can go to that person and
[49:26] say give me the book
[49:31] and this is what this is this is how the
[49:33] message moves us i believe you can even
[49:34] see this being in parallel with the
[49:36] message of the hour because now now we
[49:39] come and we want to take the book we got
[49:40] to go to him who is christ
[49:42] not the messenger
[49:44] the messenger points us to christ so we
[49:46] don't go to william branham and ask for
[49:47] the book brother branham and ask for the
[49:48] book we go to christ and this
[49:50] introduction's been made this union is
[49:52] taking place and then when we go to him
[49:53] what it was that we found in this and i
[49:55] went under the angel and he said unto
[49:58] and said unto him give me the little
[50:00] book
[50:01] so now you're walking in obedience to
[50:02] the message
[50:04] and then it brings this introduction he
[50:06] that heareth my voice and will open up
[50:08] i'll come into him and sup with him and
[50:09] he with me now there's this give me the
[50:12] little book and then the further mystery
[50:14] unfolds and he said unto me take it
[50:16] which is what the message said do but
[50:18] now there's another part and eat it up
[50:21] there's a lot of people that are just
[50:22] wanting to take it and take it but
[50:24] they're not going to him and taking it
[50:25] because the further unfolding is now you
[50:27] can eat it up and it's almost like whoa
[50:29] wait a minute what john couldn't even
[50:31] look at it let alone touch it and now he
[50:32] can take it and eat it
[50:35] he says but it shall make thy belly
[50:36] bitter
[50:37] but it shall be in my mouth sweet as
[50:39] honey and i took the little book out of
[50:40] the angel's hand and i ate it up and it
[50:42] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[50:44] soon as i'd eaten it my belly was bitter
[50:45] there's a lot of beautiful things
[50:47] expressed in that but they all wanted to
[50:48] come to this and he said unto me thou
[50:50] must prophesy again
[50:53] before many peoples and nations and
[50:55] tongues and kings
[50:58] thou must prophesy
[51:01] again
[51:02] what is it that john's going to be
[51:03] saying
[51:05] what is it that john's going to be
[51:06] expressing
[51:08] the contents of this book
[51:11] has got to be prophesied before many
[51:14] thou must prophesy again you can only
[51:16] prophesy after your process in the
[51:18] contents of the prophecy
[51:20] taking the book he's eating it and in
[51:22] this image that's expressed here taking
[51:24] an open book and eating it now john is
[51:27] anointed to prophesy again to speak
[51:29] again it's the open book which is christ
[51:32] being prophesied again he says i must
[51:34] prophesy again before many people's
[51:35] nations tongues and kings
[51:38] it sounds a lot like what happened in
[51:39] revelations 5 13 every creature which is
[51:42] in heaven and on earth and under the
[51:44] earth and such as are in the sea and all
[51:45] that are in them heard eyes saying
[51:47] blessing and honor and glory and power
[51:50] be unto him that sitteth upon the throne
[51:51] and the lamb forever and ever speak
[51:54] again john prophesy again sound it out
[51:57] declare it amen this is the very image
[52:00] of the bride who has had has this
[52:02] introduction to christ in the end time
[52:04] and is feeding on the unfailing body
[52:06] word of the son of man we have got to
[52:08] take these face-to-face experiences and
[52:11] these places where god is fulfilling his
[52:13] promised word we've got to be taken
[52:15] these instances of these intimate
[52:17] expressions of his word whether it be
[52:19] the new birth which is the baptismal
[52:20] holy ghost divine healing the laying on
[52:22] of hands the manifestations of gifts all
[52:25] these things have to be internalized
[52:27] into a life that prophesies again that
[52:30] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[52:32] and forever and he's liberated his bride
[52:35] in this last days to be the final voice
[52:38] to the final age
[52:41] this is what's sounding out from the
[52:42] bride now this very verse prophesying
[52:45] again prophesying again around the world
[52:47] it's going
[52:50] and second corinthians chapter three
[52:52] verses two and three i've read this to
[52:53] you a number of times in this he says
[52:54] for ye are our epistle written in our
[52:56] hearts
[52:56] known and read of all men
[52:59] paul had a message in his heart he wrote
[53:00] it in a personal letter to the
[53:01] corinthians then they took it believed
[53:03] it and lived it he says now you're my
[53:04] letter
[53:06] for as you are manifestly declared to be
[53:08] the epistle of christ ministered by us
[53:11] paul ministered christ
[53:13] they received it and then manifestly
[53:15] declared it
[53:17] written not with ink but with the spirit
[53:19] of living god not on the tables of stone
[53:20] but in the fleshly tables of the heart
[53:22] it brings the mercy seat into view
[53:24] and what i've been expressing in this
[53:26] very scripture is the bride is the
[53:27] written word manifested in its season
[53:30] manifestly declared to be christ
[53:33] the bride will manifestly declare christ
[53:37] whatever's written she manifestly
[53:39] declares
[53:40] and it's exact it's exampled in paul's
[53:42] ministry
[53:44] because he says in first thessalonians 1
[53:46] chapter 1 verse 8
[53:49] i'm gonna
[53:51] i'm going to create just a little bit of
[53:52] hope that's all i have left
[53:57] but i can preach between the lines if
[53:58] you need me to
[54:00] i just have two scriptures and this
[54:01] quote from the second seal and i'm done
[54:03] it's going to be the end in conclusion
[54:07] watch i'll end up preaching to part 17.
[54:09] just just just so the lord said i'm in
[54:11] control of this
[54:13] says for for from you first that's
[54:15] between 1 8 if you turn there that's
[54:16] first thessalonians 1 8.
[54:19] if you're in a hurry
[54:21] for from you sounded out the word of the
[54:23] lord from who
[54:25] from you sounded out the word of the
[54:26] lord
[54:27] this is the humility of the first age
[54:29] church messenger he's not saying hey
[54:31] it's only me i'm the only one
[54:33] you got to pass my letters around you
[54:34] can only it's only it's only my letters
[54:36] it's on my list no from you sounded out
[54:38] the word of the lord not only in
[54:39] macedonia but nikaiah but also in every
[54:42] place your faith to god were to spread
[54:44] abroad so that we need not to speak
[54:46] anything
[54:48] do you see the image that is expressed
[54:50] by paul in this first age it's what is
[54:53] expressed in the last days under the
[54:55] bride under her messenger is the final
[54:57] voice to the final age so that brother
[54:59] branham is not necessarily needing to be
[55:02] here in the flesh to speak anything
[55:04] because the word is sounding out from
[55:06] the bride who has received this message
[55:08] he says so that i need not speak
[55:10] anything why because you're the message
[55:13] lived out flesh and bone
[55:16] from you sounds out the word of the
[55:18] lord so we don't need to speak anything
[55:22] why because your life
[55:24] perfectly interprets what i'm writing to
[55:25] you
[55:26] your life perfectly interprets the
[55:29] epistle of christ ministered by us
[55:33] so from out from you that's what
[55:35] revelations 10 13 is or 11 and you must
[55:38] prophesy again before many peoples
[55:43] in psalm 68 verse 11.
[55:51] it says the lord gave the word it's back
[55:55] whatever that was
[55:56] is back
[55:59] the lord gave the word
[56:02] great was the company of those that
[56:03] published it
[56:06] this is exactly what's happened in our
[56:07] day
[56:08] the lord has given the word to his bride
[56:12] and you're the company that publishes it
[56:15] do you realize that you're the original
[56:16] voice of god recordings
[56:19] you're the original voice spoken word
[56:20] publications
[56:23] even before it was incorporated even
[56:25] before was formed when brother brown was
[56:27] preaching the trial when brother i was
[56:28] preaching these messages he said there
[56:30] has been a bride she is risen she's
[56:32] raised up she's here the very
[56:33] fulfillment everything that's been
[56:35] pointing to this time and hour there's
[56:36] going to there's a people that was
[56:38] coming upon the earth that's going to
[56:39] triumph over death and he's and he's
[56:41] declaring it now the bride will be the
[56:43] final voice to the final age the lord in
[56:45] this last days has given his word and
[56:48] great is the bride who is now publishing
[56:51] it
[56:52] now declaring it now expressing it now
[56:54] manifesting it
[56:56] worldwide
[56:58] that's the i am
[57:01] an open book
[57:03] that's you are
[57:05] the open book
[57:07] i want to close with this prayer from
[57:08] the second seal he says to bow
[57:11] your heads you could if you wanted to
[57:13] you could focus now very intently on
[57:15] what he's saying
[57:17] and i want to be very
[57:20] purposeful in reading this
[57:22] as we as we weigh all these statements
[57:24] as to which ones should be read he says
[57:27] let's bow our heads just a moment
[57:29] heavenly father oh i just sometimes lord
[57:32] stand here and i tremble
[57:34] i think of that awful hour that's
[57:35] approaching this isn't the second seal
[57:37] there's no way to stop it
[57:39] it's predicted that it would come
[57:41] now i thought of why don't people come
[57:43] and listen and why don't they come and
[57:44] accept it
[57:46] but of course i know that you said they
[57:48] wouldn't so they won't
[57:51] but there are some
[57:52] that's got their names written
[57:54] on the lamb's book of life
[57:57] and when them seals are throwed open
[57:59] there
[58:01] they see their name there
[58:03] and the holy spirit speaks to them
[58:06] they come
[58:08] there's other places i could read very
[58:10] similar statements but notice what he
[58:11] just said when the seals are opened you
[58:13] see your name the holy spirit speaks and
[58:16] you come
[58:18] you can't keep them away no one can
[58:21] no one
[58:22] they're coming anyhow because you're
[58:25] leading them like you did those little
[58:27] birds and the sheep and the cattle
[58:29] it's referring to the instance where he
[58:31] saw there in india where there was an
[58:32] earthquake coming and long before they
[58:34] even knew the earthquake was going to
[58:35] come all of a sudden there was some
[58:37] sense that the birds began to fly the
[58:39] cattle got away from the the wall why
[58:41] because some sense was telling them
[58:43] danger's coming there's an earthquake
[58:44] coming get out of the way and he led the
[58:46] animals to safety and it's something
[58:48] that they've tried to figure out and
[58:50] studied how do animals kind of get this
[58:52] sense beforehand is it something in in
[58:54] the earth magnetism is it some kind of
[58:56] vibration or sound unknown demand but
[58:58] there's some way that animals respond
[59:01] quicker and earlier than than humans do
[59:04] to some of these great uh terrible
[59:06] calamities and these natural disasters
[59:07] and he's saying it's you that's leading
[59:10] them
[59:12] couldn't we say he's leading them why
[59:14] everyone else is unaware
[59:18] people look at us and they look at our
[59:20] gatherings and they look at our faith
[59:21] and they look at our testimony and they
[59:23] can't figure out why in the world you're
[59:25] doing this why do you believe the way
[59:26] that you do why do you stand for what
[59:28] you stand for how come you haven't quit
[59:30] have you not read everything that's been
[59:32] said are you not aware of this are you
[59:33] not aware of that and everyone's trying
[59:35] to figure out and build some big case
[59:37] and you're sitting here saying i'm just
[59:39] led i can't help it this is this is more
[59:42] than just me agreeing with something
[59:44] written this is more than just me being
[59:46] caught by some charisma or some
[59:48] personality what's happened as the
[59:50] book's been open i've seen my name and
[59:54] the holy spirit is speaking to me come
[59:56] come i must come to this i must walk in
[59:58] this just as the holy spirit led those
[1:00:01] animals out of danger the book has been
[1:00:03] opened and it's led you here tonight
[1:00:07] and it's leading others
[1:00:09] he says thou art god
[1:00:11] listen he says some instinct that them
[1:00:13] animals have that they know they must
[1:00:15] get away
[1:00:17] listen listen this is my closing
[1:00:19] statement if instinct to an animal could
[1:00:22] warn him to flee from danger
[1:00:25] what should the holy spirit due to a
[1:00:27] church that claims to be filled with it
[1:00:31] i asked in the very beginning what's the
[1:00:33] consequence of an open book what does it
[1:00:35] mean that the bible's become a new book
[1:00:37] what what what does that mean for us and
[1:00:39] i spent a lot of time in the seals to
[1:00:42] show that it means we've got to live
[1:00:43] this life we've got to become the
[1:00:45] interpretation of those seven thunders
[1:00:47] we've got to be the manifestation of the
[1:00:48] mystery of god and if an instinct could
[1:00:51] cause an animal to flee from danger then
[1:00:53] what should this church do that claims
[1:00:56] to be filled with the holy ghost
[1:00:59] what ought to we be up and doing in this
[1:01:02] hour we who have been liberated in this
[1:01:04] hour the holy spirit no longer bound by
[1:01:06] creeds and dogmas christ loosed and
[1:01:09] liberated and a bride united together
[1:01:11] with him i asked the question i want
[1:01:13] your dad lives to be the answer from
[1:01:16] this moment forward what would a church
[1:01:18] do who claims to be filled with every
[1:01:20] fiber of this holy spirit do
[1:01:24] and let your life be the answer
[1:01:26] praise the lord god bless you let's
[1:01:28] stand together this evening
