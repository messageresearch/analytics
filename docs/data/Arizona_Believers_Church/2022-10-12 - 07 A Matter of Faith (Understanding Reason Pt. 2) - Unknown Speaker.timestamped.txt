[0:00] we continued on this subject a matter of
[0:03] Faith so that's been our subject this is
[0:05] the um seventh service on this and my uh
[0:08] title tonight is understanding reason
[0:11] this is part two on that so continue on
[0:14] the subject of a a matter of Faith as
[0:16] opposed to it being a matter of fact
[0:17] it's looking at things as a matter of
[0:19] faith and then um understanding reason
[0:22] and I think even that phrase there maybe
[0:24] a little bit of tension grabbing to say
[0:27] understanding reason and what we're
[0:29] looking at really is how that reason and
[0:31] understanding function alongside Faith
[0:34] because there's a way that we think
[0:36] about faith and it has no reason in it
[0:38] at all and it's correct to view it that
[0:40] way we think of Faith as a sick sense
[0:42] that's not relying on our minds or our
[0:44] thinking power but there is a way that
[0:46] we could think about reason that we make
[0:48] it something it's not and then we make
[0:50] enemies out of reason and faith and
[0:52] it'll actually put us as human beings in
[0:54] a hard spot because we have a mind that
[0:56] reasons we have thought processes we
[0:58] have intelligence and so I want to start
[1:00] with Ephesians chapter 1 we're going to
[1:03] read this as a a kind of backgrounding
[1:05] where we were last time and we're
[1:07] picking up where we had to leave off
[1:09] before in Ephesians chap 1: 17 and 18 it
[1:13] says the Lord the that the god this is
[1:16] Paul's prayer now that the god of our
[1:18] Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory
[1:20] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:24] and Revelation so it's the spirit of
[1:25] wisdom and the spirit of Revelation it
[1:27] being that one spirit in the knowledge
[1:30] of him the eyes of your understanding
[1:32] being enlightened that you may know what
[1:35] is the hope of this call of his calling
[1:37] and what the riches of the glory of his
[1:39] inheritance in the Saint so Paul's
[1:42] prayer is uh certainly that they would
[1:44] have faith he rejoiced to hear of their
[1:46] faith we read in El elsewhere and that
[1:49] was the most prominent thing that's what
[1:51] gets you into the body of Christ that's
[1:53] what gives you this spirit is by faith
[1:55] but then now that we're filled with
[1:57] faith he prayed that that faith inside
[2:00] of us would enrich us through the spirit
[2:02] of wisdom and Revelation in the
[2:04] knowledge of Christ so it's not
[2:06] something separate you don't get born
[2:08] again say I got the Holy Ghost now I
[2:09] want to go get a doctorate in something
[2:11] and I want to get educated no but
[2:13] there's a way that we can grow in the
[2:14] spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the
[2:16] knowledge of Christ and if this happens
[2:19] it says the eyes of our understanding
[2:20] will be enlightened and being
[2:22] enlightened we will know this is kind of
[2:24] a the outcome of the process what is the
[2:26] hope of his calling and what the riches
[2:29] of the glor of his inheritance is in the
[2:31] Saints so there's there's things to
[2:34] understand there's things to unfold
[2:35] things to know and Paul's writing it to
[2:37] where wisdom Revelation knowledge and
[2:39] understanding are to give us to give us
[2:42] knowledge or so that we can know the
[2:44] hope we can know the riches so we have
[2:47] faith that we have them we because we
[2:49] have faith we have hope but now there's
[2:51] a deeper knowledge that we could have
[2:53] about these things that feeds our faith
[2:55] and encourages us and so whereas we and
[2:59] and we know that there is a wisdom of
[3:01] this world and there's a Godly wisdom
[3:03] there is a faith and there's a wisdom
[3:05] that is opposed to it and that's where
[3:07] brother R says wisdom versus faith that
[3:09] lean not to thine own understanding and
[3:11] we're not wanting to go in our own
[3:12] wisdom but there is a Godly
[3:15] understanding there is a Godly wisdom
[3:17] and so instead of kind of instigating a
[3:20] fight between faith and and reason we
[3:22] could or even faith and wisdom and faith
[3:24] and knowledge and faith and
[3:26] understanding we we need to look at it
[3:28] the right way to to uh not necessarily
[3:32] uh deescalate the conflict but maybe
[3:34] resolve the perceived conflict that
[3:37] faith has with reason and the way that
[3:39] we suggested that last time is instead
[3:41] of saying that reason is bad and faith
[3:45] alone is good but find out how that
[3:47] reason is subject to Faith In other
[3:50] words establish the order of dependency
[3:53] we and God is Not relying Upon Our
[3:55] wisdom God is Not relying upon our our
[3:58] Humanity God is Not relying upon us for
[4:01] for insight for wisdom and knowledge but
[4:03] our humanity and our reason is dependent
[4:07] entirely upon God and that's and so when
[4:10] we begin to establish dependency that my
[4:12] knowledge is a dependent upon God my
[4:15] wisdom is dependent upon God my
[4:17] understanding uh my thought process my
[4:19] rationality my logic all that we want to
[4:21] make subject to God because brother ROM
[4:23] tells us what happens when man lets
[4:26] loose of his faith in God and gives
[4:28] himself over to wisdom alone
[4:30] he can get from the Earth to the Moon he
[4:33] can send a telescope into the furthest
[4:34] reaches of space that's giving us some
[4:36] phenomenal images of what's out there
[4:38] but has no character within his heart
[4:41] does not have the humility to to uh even
[4:44] though he sees how big this universe is
[4:46] and creation is doesn't have humility to
[4:48] repent for his sins so when he lets go
[4:50] of his faith in God man can accomplish a
[4:53] lot but the order the dependency has
[4:56] been broken so the and it's the
[4:58] independency of wisdom and knowledge and
[5:00] understanding that causes the issue so
[5:02] we must stay in all our getting get
[5:05] understanding and and and we know wisdom
[5:07] is the principal thing and so we want to
[5:10] have that but not independent of God's
[5:12] word not independent of God because it's
[5:15] dependent upon God now the the scripture
[5:17] that we stopped at last time is in 1
[5:19] Peter chapter 3:1
[5:21] 15 and and Peter writing this says but
[5:25] sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and
[5:27] be ready always so this is a Readiness
[5:30] that we ought to always have be ready
[5:32] always to give an answer and so this is
[5:35] suggesting that you never know when
[5:37] you're going to be asked but you need to
[5:38] be able to give an answer to give an
[5:39] answer to every man that askthe a reason
[5:43] of the hope that is in you and to do it
[5:46] with meekness and fear so we
[5:48] scripturally must always answer every
[5:52] time someone ask us what's the reason
[5:54] for her our hope and every time do it
[5:57] with meekness and fear it doesn't say
[5:59] say on occasion when you feel good but
[6:01] if anyone's ever inquiring and asking we
[6:03] ought to be in a place where we can
[6:05] answer what's the reason for your hope
[6:07] what's your expectation why do you have
[6:10] faith and why do you believe and why are
[6:12] you looking forward to a Rapture why do
[6:13] you believe in healing and why and ask
[6:15] us these things he says you sanctify God
[6:18] in your hearts and with meekness and
[6:20] fear be ready or with meekness and fear
[6:22] answer every man who ask you what is the
[6:25] reason of Hope now that word there
[6:28] reason it's a familiar word to us
[6:29] message Believers the word is
[6:31] logos and so it's we to be we have to
[6:34] when we are asked the logos of Our Hope
[6:38] which is the cause the basis the grounds
[6:41] for it it could be even used to to say
[6:43] what's the
[6:44] rationale for your hope and when logos
[6:47] is used in this way it speaks it's it
[6:50] speaks of the condition of the mind your
[6:52] mental state what are you thinking what
[6:54] is your rationale what is your basis
[6:56] what is your uh what is your your
[6:58] grounds or your cause for having hope
[7:02] brother bam tells us that logos is the
[7:03] thought or concept it's the reasoning
[7:06] that's what we're looking at it's the
[7:07] the thought or concept behind the speech
[7:10] uh I could right now I could say duck
[7:13] right and some people may look down
[7:15] Others May look around for a duck right
[7:18] but what You' so what you'd want to know
[7:19] is what was what was he thinking when he
[7:22] said duck what what was the thought what
[7:23] was the concept behind that and then my
[7:26] literal word carries the thought and and
[7:29] so that's what we understand about the
[7:30] word of God the word the logos are the
[7:33] thoughts of God
[7:34] expressed and so it's not just the
[7:37] verbalization that we want to catch in
[7:39] the Rama or the word but we want to know
[7:41] God's heart we want to know his mind we
[7:43] want to know what he was thinking and
[7:45] and what his his inspiration was behind
[7:47] it so it says when man asks you what's
[7:50] the reason of your hope then you begin
[7:52] to think what's my basis what's my cause
[7:57] why do I have hope and then do it in
[7:59] such a way to where you can say it with
[8:01] meekness and fear knowing that you stand
[8:03] on the absolute truth now reason is also
[8:06] if we just defined it by a dictionary
[8:09] it's explanation or justification for
[8:11] something a reason is that motive for
[8:14] acting your reason why did you do that
[8:17] it's your reason for thinking something
[8:19] acting a certain way it's the cause that
[8:22] explains something why is it this way
[8:24] and you're giving the reason the cause
[8:26] for something and reason is also the
[8:28] power of orderly thought the power of to
[8:32] think rationally to think logically when
[8:34] someone is well reasoned or someone is
[8:36] within reason or or we say maybe they're
[8:38] saying or they're in their right Minds
[8:40] it's speaking of someone who has the
[8:42] power of orderly thought things are
[8:44] fitting together and things make sense
[8:46] and that's also what we would refer to
[8:49] as reason now I'm not asking us now to
[8:51] put everything on reasons as long as I'm
[8:53] just thinking clearly no because God
[8:55] doesn't always line up with what we
[8:57] think is logical right God doesn't
[9:00] always do things that you know by our
[9:03] principles of what makes sense so it's a
[9:05] logic or logos that relates to a Godly
[9:08] wisdom and something on a higher order I
[9:11] I think we've touched on some of these
[9:12] things before but if none of us knew
[9:15] about the Bible but you found out that
[9:17] there was a judge who was having
[9:18] immediated dispute between two women who
[9:21] were claiming to be the mother of the
[9:23] same baby none of us would say oh grab a
[9:27] sword yeah totally just cut it in half
[9:30] and just tell the parents that's what
[9:31] you're going to do is just cut it in
[9:32] half and divide it to each one none of
[9:34] us would have said that right especially
[9:37] these days like let's just DNA test
[9:38] let's just go out and do it and solon's
[9:40] like save the lab guys time I'll solve
[9:43] this right now on the spot right because
[9:46] it was a higher wisdom doesn't seem to
[9:48] make much sense maybe but it was a
[9:50] higher wisdom it was on a different
[9:51] order it knew the heart of the mothers
[9:53] it it knew human behavior and human
[9:55] interaction so God's way is always the
[9:57] best way think we said last time that
[9:59] all truth is God's truth there's nothing
[10:02] true that can't wind itself some way
[10:04] back to God in his program and his
[10:07] will and so this reason when he says
[10:10] that we ought to be able to give an
[10:12] answer to every man that ask us a reason
[10:15] of Our Hope and that Paul is saying that
[10:19] our we might have the spirit of wisdom
[10:20] and Revelation and the knowledge of him
[10:22] that enlightens our eyes of
[10:23] understanding that we may know what is
[10:25] the hope of this calling so there's
[10:27] there's things that God wants to do
[10:28] within us to give us get us to this
[10:30] place where we can give an answer or
[10:32] literally give a
[10:34] reason says in Isaiah 1 verse
[10:38] 18 come now and let us reason together
[10:42] saith the
[10:45] Lord it continues and I think it's a
[10:48] very beautiful much more beautiful
[10:49] thought than I can um express it tonight
[10:52] in the time that we want to give this
[10:53] but he says though your sins be as
[10:55] Scarlet they shall be white as snow
[10:57] though they be red like crimson shall be
[10:59] his wool what a tremendous outcome from
[11:03] come let us reason together this is what
[11:05] he's asking come now and let us reason
[11:07] together in the Hebrew saying let's
[11:09] let's let's get together and let's weigh
[11:11] things out let let's consider come let
[11:14] us consider things together and even in
[11:16] a way that it's written come let us
[11:18] reason let's argue the
[11:20] case and the in the context of your sins
[11:24] though your sins be as Scarlet they can
[11:26] be white as snow though they be red like
[11:27] Crimson they shall be as rule let's
[11:29] carefully consider what is required to
[11:31] deal with sin let let's come and reason
[11:34] together it it's far different than just
[11:36] saying you know you you just need to do
[11:37] what I say but come let's talk about
[11:39] this come God actually calling for a
[11:42] conference God calling people to come
[11:44] together a a and and to to exercise uh
[11:48] this openness to hear what he has to say
[11:50] think about what he is saying I think
[11:53] this fits so well with what we were
[11:54] ministering on on Sunday that there's
[11:56] just a lot that's welding up within me
[11:58] hoping that we recognize how the word is
[12:01] trying to put us in the right mind and
[12:04] put us in the right frame of thinking
[12:05] even as we talked a lot about just being
[12:07] in a better mood the word is wanting to
[12:09] kind of put us in the right kind of mood
[12:11] not so that we can have an alternative
[12:13] to CBD or all these sorts of things that
[12:16] kind of could put us in in these moods
[12:18] but so that we could be in a condition
[12:20] to have relationship with God God's goal
[12:23] is not just to make us happy but to put
[12:25] us in relationship with him and so the
[12:27] the right mood is to put us in the frame
[12:29] of mind to allow the word to work
[12:31] effectively in our
[12:33] lives it's not just as maybe sometimes
[12:36] the gospel is just phrased as well this
[12:38] is just a way to live your best life now
[12:40] right as Dr Olstein would say you know
[12:43] we want to live our best life
[12:46] now I don't I don't think I have the
[12:48] teeth for
[12:50] it now in Acts chapter
[12:52] 17 verses 2 to5 and we're reading the
[12:56] the real meat of this is going to be in
[12:57] the first two verses
[12:59] and uh I'm realizing now I that I I
[13:03] failed to put a scripture in here and so
[13:05] if I if I if I get later in the sermon
[13:08] you just take I'm just going to put this
[13:09] puzzle piece out there and if I forget
[13:10] to put it in you'll have to put it in
[13:12] later so you hold the final piece to the
[13:14] puzzle tonight but Paul comes to a place
[13:16] when he's preaching and they've erected
[13:18] an altar to the unknown
[13:21] God and they were worshiping something
[13:23] that was unknown they could worship but
[13:26] there was something unknown hidden and
[13:28] that's contrary to the nature of God cuz
[13:30] yet he is a God that hides himself but
[13:32] part of that is he's a God that reveals
[13:34] himself and so if it's just a God that's
[13:36] a mystery then that's not our God
[13:38] because our God remains mysterious but
[13:40] has a desire to unfold himself and
[13:41] reveal himself and so Paul demonstrates
[13:45] that he didn't want the people just to
[13:47] worship an unknown God or to just take
[13:49] me at my word and and and kind of put
[13:51] the blinders on and do what I say but
[13:53] his prayer was that they would come to
[13:55] know Christ he he was so articulate and
[13:59] expressing this for himself personally
[14:01] and for the believer and here in Acts
[14:03] chapter 17 starting with verse two we'll
[14:05] read to verse 5 uh because we want to
[14:08] read about the the certain lewd fellows
[14:10] of A baser Sort and it says in verse two
[14:12] and Paul as his manner was went in unto
[14:16] them because this is his custom and
[14:18] three Sabbath days reasoned with them
[14:21] out of the
[14:23] scriptures so it wasn't just Paul
[14:25] according to tradition wasn't Paul in
[14:27] his wit or wisdom but he reason with
[14:29] them out of the scriptures and then this
[14:32] is this is a further uh amplification of
[14:36] how he reasoned opening and alleging
[14:39] that Christ must needs have suffered and
[14:41] risen again from the dead and that this
[14:44] Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ
[14:48] this is what Paul believed this Jesus
[14:50] that I preach to you is Christ now he
[14:52] could have just said Jesus is Christ
[14:54] this Jesus I preached to he is the
[14:55] Messiah he is Christ but now he carried
[14:58] three different sabbaths opening the
[15:00] scriptures and and laying out opening
[15:02] and alleging arguing reasoning setting
[15:06] forth in a scriptural way the reasons
[15:08] why Christ was the Messiah now let's not
[15:12] mistake ourselves Paul could not
[15:15] logically argue it to the point to where
[15:17] all man could accept it to the satisfa
[15:19] to God's satisfaction because that takes
[15:22] Faith but yet he still wanted to commit
[15:24] himself to arguing from the scriptures
[15:27] in a way that would persuade
[15:29] man and even I believe it's a grippa oh
[15:31] Paul you almost persuaded me to be a
[15:34] Christian and Paul said I wish I did I
[15:36] wish I would have done it why because
[15:38] his words were to be persuasive the
[15:40] teaching was to be persuasive and he
[15:42] says very clearly he reasoned with them
[15:44] out of the scriptures opening alleging
[15:46] that Christ was the Messiah and he was
[15:48] to have suffered and to died upon a
[15:50] cross and rose again after three days he
[15:52] was reasoning with them not not in a
[15:55] worldly way but according to the word of
[15:58] God to open up their understanding to
[16:00] accept the truth of scripture and verse
[16:03] four and some of them believed and
[16:05] consorted with Paul and silus and of The
[16:07] Devout Greeks a great multitude and of
[16:09] the chief women not a few so through his
[16:12] reasoning with him and opening alleging
[16:14] it was bringing people to believe but
[16:17] the Jews which believed not so no matter
[16:19] how much he reasoned in the scripture
[16:21] they reasoned against him because of
[16:23] their prior Traditions they didn't want
[16:24] to open up to understand these things
[16:26] moved with Envy took unto them certain
[16:28] ude fellows of the baser sort and
[16:31] gathered a company and set all the city
[16:32] on an uproar and assaulted the house of
[16:34] Jason and sought to bring them out to
[16:37] the people what caused this Paul
[16:39] reasoning with them out of the scripture
[16:42] opening and alleging that Christ was to
[16:44] be crucified that he was to raise again
[16:46] on the third day and that Jesus was the
[16:50] Messiah he was the Christ I hope you can
[16:53] see I know that's just a few scriptures
[16:55] that actually use the word reason but I
[16:57] hope that you can see that on some level
[16:59] now you you give it you can give it the
[17:01] emphasis that God would want to place in
[17:03] your heart on some level we're using the
[17:05] power of reason when we when we're
[17:07] hearing the word of God to and we're
[17:10] wrestling with the things of God on some
[17:12] level we're using our minds initially
[17:15] right because that's what first deals
[17:16] with the words as they come the word
[17:18] come and someone say Jesus Christ died
[17:20] for your sins well your brain has to
[17:21] make sense of that sentence first and
[17:24] then there's the ability in your soul if
[17:26] you're not born again to either reject
[17:27] that thought or accept that thought and
[17:30] when you accept that thought and you and
[17:32] you re and you believe that you you come
[17:35] to a place of faith that if you walk in
[17:36] obedience to the scripture God will seal
[17:38] you with the baptism of the Holy
[17:40] Ghost repenting and being baptized in
[17:42] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're
[17:43] born again you could be born again by
[17:45] the word of God but first you in your
[17:47] mind you had to make sense of what you
[17:49] were hearing not figure it all out but
[17:52] it something had to resonate in your
[17:54] heart you had to be put in the right
[17:56] mind that's where brother bam emphasizes
[17:58] I know this may be some repetition from
[18:00] Sunday that you want to accept Christ
[18:02] when you're in your right mind amen well
[18:05] you still have the power of orderly
[18:08] thought now in the sermon
[18:11] Paradox this is the the the the
[18:14] businessman's breakfast on April 18th in
[18:17] 1964 he quotes from Mark 11:
[18:21] 22 Jesus said in St Mark 11:22 if you
[18:24] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[18:27] doubt in your heart but believe that you
[18:29] said what you said will come to pass you
[18:31] can have what you said now we believe
[18:33] that right Absol we've been through this
[18:35] scripture quite a bit this year we
[18:37] absolutely believe this and brother B
[18:39] says but you're hold on what do you mean
[18:43] he says but that takes motive and
[18:45] objective so now what brother Ram's
[18:47] doing is he believes this but he knows
[18:49] that when God speaks something there
[18:51] there's order in the word of God right
[18:54] and that this this just G take this and
[18:56] throw it off to the side and say this
[18:58] works out of context no it works within
[19:00] the character and nature of God brother
[19:02] B said that operates according to a law
[19:04] of faith and so he says but that takes
[19:07] motive and objective and I hope you're
[19:10] listening to this part here of course
[19:13] you got to have a reason for
[19:16] it you got to have a reason for what
[19:18] speaking into the mountain and say that
[19:20] it's moved this this isn't a game this
[19:22] isn't show and tell this isn't well you
[19:24] know we've got power to create a world
[19:25] and go live on it and I'll just prove it
[19:27] to you never going to happen happen that
[19:29] way says you've got to have a reason for
[19:32] what speaking to the mountain and asking
[19:33] it to be moved so there's power in the
[19:36] word of God to move a mountain and that
[19:38] power is going to operate according to
[19:40] your motive and objective first you find
[19:43] in the word of God if it's if it's true
[19:45] now I'm not going to just be able to
[19:47] exercise that regardless of what I'm
[19:49] thinking the word of God is true it's a
[19:52] seed it's powerful but I'm not I don't
[19:54] have access to use the word of God if my
[19:56] mind and my spirit aren't in harmony
[19:59] with the with the the intent of God's
[20:01] logos the thought behind what he said so
[20:04] brother Bram and the next this is but
[20:06] that takes motive and objective of
[20:08] course you got to have a reason for it
[20:10] now notice this you can't have faith
[20:13] unless you got some
[20:16] reason that's a heavy
[20:18] statement you cannot have faith unless
[20:21] you got some reason
[20:24] now this makes a lot of sense if you
[20:26] think about it yes sir you say you've
[20:28] got faith what's that oh Faith you know
[20:32] faith I no I don't know what faith is
[20:33] tell me what faith faith is is is when
[20:36] you be when you have faith or faith is
[20:39] when you believe believe what believe
[20:40] the word well what why do you believe
[20:41] the word because I have faith right and
[20:46] like yeah okay right there's a point
[20:48] where no there's more to Faith right
[20:50] there's absolutely more to Faith that
[20:52] you you talk to a Jew about what their
[20:54] faith was they'll tell you a lot of
[20:55] stuff right why because they have a
[20:58] basis
[20:59] for their faith they have a reason for
[21:01] their faith and he's saying you can't
[21:03] have faith unless you got some reason
[21:05] hey there's a check right there for all
[21:07] of us what is it you're believing in
[21:08] what is it you're believing for what is
[21:10] it that holds up your theology or what
[21:13] you're believing in and ask yourself
[21:14] what's my reason for it and what's the
[21:17] basis at the end of the day what's
[21:19] holding up my truth I think we've shared
[21:22] this before and if I'm starting to
[21:23] repeat myself pray for me but the the
[21:25] story of how in Europe when they begin
[21:27] to realize that maybe the Earth wasn't
[21:29] flat and one of the philosophers or the
[21:31] great scientists in the day this is
[21:33] hundreds of years ago this just didn't
[21:34] happen a couple weeks ago and and he was
[21:36] given a talk on how the world is not
[21:38] flat it is round and a woman objected
[21:41] she said sir I'll have you to know that
[21:42] the Earth is flat and it's held up upon
[21:44] the back of a giant
[21:47] tortoise and the philosopher wasn't
[21:49] going to argue the point but he just
[21:50] said ma'am could you please tell me
[21:52] what's holding up the
[21:54] turtle and she said sir it's Turtles all
[21:57] the way down
[22:00] and that's a lot of people's
[22:03] theology that is a lot of people's Faith
[22:06] it's Turtles all the way
[22:08] down but we as Believers have to have a
[22:10] reason for our faith and it better not
[22:12] be
[22:13] Turtles it's not just Turtles all the
[22:15] way down we have a place we can come
[22:16] back to doesn't mean everybody has to
[22:18] agree or everybody has to see what it is
[22:20] but we have a basis he says you cannot
[22:22] have faith unless you have a
[22:24] reason and now he amplifies this as I
[22:27] tried to say last night right some
[22:30] people's faith is in their textbook good
[22:32] some people's faith is in something else
[22:34] but depends on where your faith is I
[22:37] want to believe God's word what he says
[22:39] is true so there's our basis there's our
[22:41] reason then I've got to see whether it's
[22:43] his will or not then if it is his will I
[22:46] got to check out my motive my excuse me
[22:49] got to check out my objective to it and
[22:51] then my motive in doing it there's a lot
[22:53] to unpack there and we won't uh I think
[22:56] there's a lot to Fellowship on in that
[22:57] well what is what is objective I'll
[23:00] check out my objective to it and my
[23:02] motive in doing it if I do it because I
[23:04] say well I'm going over the mountain
[23:06] here there's a mountain before me
[23:07] there's a million people on that side
[23:09] perishing I got a 100 million over here
[23:11] I'm preaching to well if I can't get
[23:13] over around or under the mountain or
[23:14] nothing and yet Something in My heart
[23:16] keeps telling me go over the mountain go
[23:19] to them go to them and I can't get over
[23:21] it now Jesus said they shall move this
[23:23] mountain now the thing of it is first
[23:26] what if I say I never created that in
[23:28] there there something created that it's
[23:30] for good cause because why would I go to
[23:33] one a million when 100 million here are
[23:35] perishing on this side but it's
[23:37] something in my heart saying go over on
[23:39] that side right so he's thinking more
[23:42] deeply about this well I got an
[23:44] invitation to go I can't get this
[23:45] mountain out of the way I'm just going
[23:46] to have faith to believe this is going
[23:47] to happen now if you put yourself in a
[23:50] real world situation sometimes the
[23:53] things we believe
[23:54] for and that maybe we can even try to
[23:57] find a basis in the word for he wants me
[23:59] to prosper but then you start trying to
[24:01] nail down what's your motive and
[24:03] objective what's created that desire in
[24:04] you to do it and when it's just to get a
[24:06] good picture for Instagram things start
[24:08] falling apart right when it's just to
[24:11] outdo your neighbor because they have
[24:13] this or try to keep up with your family
[24:14] members what it is whatever it is you're
[24:16] believing God for can immediately Begin
[24:18] to Fall Apart because you because though
[24:21] you may be able to find something in the
[24:23] word to say that's your faith your
[24:25] motive and objective
[24:27] undermine what trying to accomplish and
[24:29] he that's just he's using an example for
[24:31] himself there's a million people over
[24:34] there perishing there's a 100 million
[24:36] people here so I could stay here why
[24:38] would I want to go to a million when I
[24:40] could preach to 100 million but
[24:41] something in my heart is creating this
[24:43] desire and he's saying that it wasn't
[24:45] you that put it there says he says that
[24:47] there's there's something that's uh that
[24:50] something that's in your heart and Jesus
[24:52] says you could say to this mountain be
[24:54] moved now let me just find where we were
[24:57] is that where I was but it says in your
[24:59] heart go over on the other
[25:01] side he says now the first thing I'll
[25:03] have to say well if I go over there this
[25:06] side can only pay me so much a month and
[25:08] over there
[25:11] they come on all of us right well this
[25:16] job here pays a lot more and this job
[25:21] here doesn't pay quite as much and he's
[25:23] looking at that if that is that what
[25:24] your barometer is right is that why you
[25:27] make the decision decisions you make I
[25:29] was fellowship with my wife this past
[25:30] week cuz to me one thought this keeps
[25:32] coming to me I hear so many stories and
[25:34] I think of the saying why sit there till
[25:36] you die good why do people do it why do
[25:40] people
[25:41] endure what they have knowing that God
[25:44] has more but they say well what this we
[25:47] got this and well that and well this and
[25:50] well that and what you've said is all
[25:52] this than that means more than pleasing
[25:55] God means more than the salvation of
[25:57] your children me means more than the
[25:59] word of God because you say I know it I
[26:01] know this would be better I know this
[26:03] would please the Lord or I want to do
[26:05] this but the weather but the job but
[26:07] this and but that and you might as well
[26:09] just say all that means more than what
[26:12] you just said you really want and what
[26:13] you think is right according to the will
[26:14] of God so this this is really applicable
[26:16] Beyond just a minister praying about
[26:18] where to go to and who to preach for and
[26:20] how big the offering is going to be yes
[26:22] sir he says see my motive is not right
[26:25] my objective is not right no well what
[26:27] if I say no I don't care about the money
[26:29] but when I get over there someday the
[26:31] ages to come they'll put up a great big
[26:32] monument and say brother brandom the
[26:34] great missionary then still my motive is
[26:37] not right I hope that you can make this
[26:41] applicable to us and how our pride can
[26:43] work sometimes and the reason why we
[26:45] want things to to work out and if we're
[26:47] honest with ourselves you say you know
[26:48] what I realize at the end of the day I
[26:50] want that to happen because I don't want
[26:51] to look bad in front of somebody else or
[26:53] or this will make me look better or this
[26:55] is what I've always wanted it really
[26:57] becomes a lot L of self-examination says
[27:00] then my motive is not right but when I
[27:01] say I don't care if they ever know who
[27:03] went over there he's just in my heart
[27:05] then I'll speak to that mountain it'll
[27:07] happen it's got to but you see your
[27:10] motive and your objective depends on who
[27:13] you are and what
[27:15] business
[27:17] right your motive and the objective
[27:19] depends on who you are and what business
[27:22] you need to think about who you are and
[27:23] what your business is and he says that's
[27:25] where the church misses it so far they
[27:28] get worked up now think of this tying
[27:30] into intellectual Faith they get worked
[27:31] up in an emotion and first thing you
[27:34] know in
[27:35] enthusiasm right enthusiasm inspiration
[27:38] emotion but they never check it with the
[27:39] word he says you don't stop to check it
[27:42] back here again check there for sure
[27:45] talking about the word then it's thus
[27:46] sayith the Lord see whether it's right
[27:49] so it kind of gives us the hierarchy
[27:50] check the word see if it's right check
[27:52] your motive and your
[27:54] objective like we're to check all these
[27:56] things we're to think about these things
[27:57] we're examine these things we're could
[27:59] look at the word of God it lines up with
[28:01] the word of God but why am I wanting to
[28:03] do this what's my purpose in doing this
[28:05] what what am I trying to accomplish and
[28:07] so he's giving us these great tools and
[28:09] he recognizes that it's easy for us to
[28:11] get worked up in Emotion worked up in
[28:13] enthusiasm and never stop to consider
[28:16] first is it his will second what's my
[28:19] reason in doing
[28:20] it what's my purpose reason and purpose
[28:23] in doing it so brother Bram takes motive
[28:25] and objective and he wraps it up into
[28:27] reason because he says you cannot have
[28:29] faith unless you got some reason and he
[28:31] says in order to understand reason we
[28:33] begin to think about motive and
[28:34] objective motive and objective establish
[28:37] our basis to think something our basis
[28:39] to act out something so as brother bam
[28:42] says it Faith suggests some reason you
[28:45] cannot have faith unless you've got some
[28:51] reason because even in this sense we
[28:54] realize and I think I'm kind of setting
[28:56] you up a little bit so stay real tight
[28:58] to this our thoughts and our reasons can
[29:00] be detrimental to our faith so you can't
[29:03] say thought doesn't matter reason
[29:04] doesn't matter it absolutely does
[29:06] because the wrong ones hinder our faith
[29:09] the wrong attitude towards the word of
[29:10] God will hinder the word of God being
[29:12] effective so we've got to give some
[29:14] thought to our reason to purpose to
[29:17] motive and objective now Luke Chapter 9:
[29:21] 57-62 uh that was that the first page
[29:24] was a lot of fun you all are really
[29:25] listening tonight I'm enjoying just go
[29:27] with through this word but I I I don't
[29:29] want to belabor this and I'm time may be
[29:31] getting away from me for a Wednesday but
[29:33] Luke 9: 57 to
[29:36] 62 and we'll read we'll amplify a little
[29:39] bit about halfway and it came to pass
[29:41] that as they went in the way and I'm
[29:42] going to use this to kind of I'm going
[29:45] to call back to everything we've just
[29:46] said in the first bit of the sermon and
[29:48] now this is a real world example of
[29:50] Jesus now identifying these principles
[29:53] that brother bram's teaching us says it
[29:55] came to pass that as they went in the
[29:56] way a certain man said unto him Lord I
[29:58] will follow thee withs soever thou goest
[30:00] now this is the man of his own accord
[30:02] his own volition I'll go anywhere you go
[30:05] I'm comes running to him I'll follow you
[30:07] because Jesus enters into another
[30:09] Village he just kind of had some of the
[30:11] Samaritans reject him he he he continues
[30:13] on and enters into another Village and
[30:15] as he comes a man saying I will follow
[30:17] you I'm going to be a follower I'll go
[30:18] wherever you go and Jesus's
[30:21] response is that that shocking response
[30:24] right instead of saying hey come on
[30:26] let's do this
[30:28] he says Foxes have holes and birds of
[30:31] the air have Nest but the son of man
[30:33] hath not where to lay his head if I can
[30:35] say it this way you say you want to
[30:38] follow me but think about
[30:40] why you you say you're willing to go
[30:42] with me wherever I go but you really
[30:46] need to think about what your motive is
[30:47] in your heart and what it is you're
[30:49] trying to accomplish because if you
[30:50] think you're going to get popular
[30:52] following me if you think you're always
[30:53] going to eat the best bread and the best
[30:55] fish following me if you all if you
[30:56] think you're going to be someone great
[30:57] in the in in an Earthly Kingdom if you
[30:59] follow me think again and so he's asking
[31:03] him about his motive his incentive for
[31:04] acting the reason that makes him want to
[31:06] do something the reason why he wants to
[31:09] follow What is prompting your action
[31:11] that's what's meant by Foxes have holes
[31:14] birds have Nest but I don't have a place
[31:16] to lay my head because you say you want
[31:18] to go with me everywhere I go but are
[31:19] you willing to go homeless that's
[31:22] right it's it's looking in his heart
[31:24] brother bam said as long as your motive
[31:26] is wrong no matter what your OB Ive is
[31:28] but your motive to that objective is
[31:30] wrong then it'll never work so if we
[31:32] were so listen I say this way therefore
[31:35] deeper thought is required right oh this
[31:38] is what I want to do I want to follow
[31:39] Jesus
[31:40] why I want to do this I want to do that
[31:42] you need to think more deeply about what
[31:43] it is you're asking because his
[31:45] objective think about Jesus's answer
[31:47] isn't like we can make this happen we
[31:49] can make this work come on he says
[31:50] something to cause
[31:52] pause something to cause the man to I
[31:55] want to do this I want to do this even
[31:56] in the same way that he dealt with the
[31:57] rich ruler what can I do to have eternal
[32:00] life keep you know keep the Commandments
[32:03] oh I've done it all since my youth Jesus
[32:05] knew exactly where to make it where it
[32:07] hurts well just go sell all you have and
[32:09] give to the poor and follow me right
[32:12] he's uncovering motive and willingness
[32:15] and what's really deep within someone's
[32:16] heart so this person we could say his
[32:18] objective was good right I I I want to
[32:21] follow Christ if someone said brother
[32:23] Aaron I'm willing to follow Christ I'm
[32:24] going to follow this message wherever it
[32:26] goes his his objective was good but his
[32:28] motive was wrong that's what I that's
[32:31] what I believe you say well where do you
[32:32] get that from well the way that Jesus
[32:34] responds to him and then the way that he
[32:36] brings these next few in these next two
[32:38] instances out or this conversation
[32:40] unfolds you realize Jesus is challenging
[32:42] people at the at at the basis of what
[32:44] their thought is when they want to do
[32:48] something he he's challenging this
[32:50] person in terms of you want to follow me
[32:53] wherever I go so he raises the terms and
[32:55] conditions you want this well this will
[32:58] be the consequences you want to do this
[32:59] these are the terms these are the
[33:01] conditions to cause the person to think
[33:02] more deeply about what they're wanting
[33:04] to do to see if they'll say yes Lord I'm
[33:06] willing I understand that I understand
[33:09] the implications I understand the
[33:10] consequences I realize I'll be
[33:12] persecuted I realize I may not have a
[33:13] place to lay my head but I know this is
[33:15] the truth and I'm willing to follow it
[33:17] so Jesus is uncovering the motive in his
[33:20] heart in verse 59 now Jesus says to
[33:22] another follow me so now he's bidding
[33:25] another disciple to come and but he said
[33:27] Lord suffer me first to go and bury my
[33:29] father so it's yes I will but first I
[33:32] need to take care of some things and
[33:35] Jesus's response is in verse 60 Let the
[33:38] dead bury their dead but go thou and
[33:40] preach the kingdom of God words he's
[33:43] he's bringing that division between
[33:45] things things pertaining to life things
[33:47] pertaining to death and again this is
[33:49] something ought have got the person's
[33:50] attention this is my excuse and he's
[33:52] said let the dead bury the
[33:55] dead but go thou and preach the kingdom
[33:58] of God what a what an incredible uh uh
[34:02] shocking statement follow me well let me
[34:04] first go bury my father and there's a
[34:07] lot that could be meant in that
[34:08] statement that I I need to tend to
[34:10] things first with my family and I can't
[34:12] do it now but I need to make sure my
[34:14] father's household is in order it's kind
[34:16] of like I will but not right
[34:18] now and that's a real challenge to young
[34:20] people sometimes who who say I know I
[34:23] should and I know I want to and I know I
[34:24] need to but not right now in verse 61
[34:27] and another also said now seeming to be
[34:29] the prompt come follow me he says Lord I
[34:32] will follow thee again a very direct
[34:34] statement I will follow the but let me
[34:36] first go bid them farewell which are at
[34:39] home at my
[34:41] house and Jesus said unto him no man
[34:45] having put his hand to the plow and
[34:47] looking back is fit for the kingdom of
[34:52] God Jesus doesn't seem to be in a good
[34:55] mood In this passage right I mean and I
[34:58] know maybe I'm take I'm being a little
[35:00] bit humorous about it but it's like hey
[35:02] Jesus I'll go wherever you go I don't
[35:03] have a place to sleep is that what you
[35:05] want follow me no I need to bury my
[35:07] father I let the dead bury the dead
[35:10] you'd think he was being you know
[35:11] argumentative or Surly no he's being
[35:13] he's being
[35:15] perceptive none of this was said with
[35:17] clinched teeth none of this was said to
[35:18] be sarcastic well I don't know how he
[35:20] said it but he's making a good point if
[35:22] I could just say that he doesn't need to
[35:24] be in a bad mood he's making a good
[35:26] point to cause the person to think and
[35:28] when he says this no man having put his
[35:30] hand to the plow and looking back is fit
[35:32] for the kingdom Christ is bringing it
[35:34] right back to reason and purpose again
[35:37] yeah good he said what do you why do you
[35:39] want to follow me why would you say yes
[35:41] what think about what the what's taking
[35:44] place and what order of importance and
[35:46] how great an opportunity this is I'm not
[35:48] just another teacher traveling the
[35:51] Hillside and if you think that's what I
[35:53] am wait for the next
[35:56] Sideshow this message is just another
[35:58] way of viewing the Bible if brother man
[36:00] was just another charismatic charismatic
[36:02] Pentecostal preacher if you want to
[36:04] think this is just another flavor and
[36:05] God's bask and Robins were wrong and we
[36:08] got to realize this is the way the truth
[36:11] the life this is the word of God and you
[36:14] better have that kind of conviction and
[36:16] understanding if you're going to go
[36:18] forward in this because you can't just
[36:19] come like well we'll just see if this
[36:21] works no man having put his hand to the
[36:24] plow and looking back is fit for the
[36:25] kingdom he raises up the image of a
[36:27] farmer in order to correct what this
[36:29] person's about to
[36:30] do how well I'll follow you let me just
[36:34] go ahead and take care of some things at
[36:35] home and and I'd like to come back to
[36:37] this again in the future and bring some
[36:39] more stuff out of these verses but Jesus
[36:41] is basically saying well no man who's
[36:44] going to
[36:45] plow going to Ho a row and then look
[36:48] back while he's doing it is fit for the
[36:51] kingdom and what that ought to do is
[36:54] cause the person who says I'll follow
[36:56] you I just need to take care of some
[36:57] things then I'll come back to where I am
[36:59] should cause that person to think about
[37:01] what's in the mind of a farmer when he's
[37:04] plowing good because a farmer has a
[37:06] specific purpose he has a reason for
[37:09] plowing it's not that he just likes
[37:11] turning up dirt it's not he likes the
[37:13] smell stand you know walking behind some
[37:16] oxen right I I it's none of those things
[37:19] it's not just without thought it's not
[37:21] indiscriminant or without purpose
[37:23] without basis he has an objective he has
[37:25] a motive to that objective and as he
[37:27] does it he has a sense of purpose and he
[37:28] has a reason why are you out there
[37:31] getting stones out of that it's the dead
[37:32] of winter why are you doing this and why
[37:33] are you doing this why are you doing
[37:34] that he knows that he's got to take care
[37:36] of the ground and he's got to get it
[37:38] ready and then he's got to turn the dirt
[37:40] up he's got to plant the seed a farmer
[37:43] understands more than just well I get
[37:46] this is just the time of year to plow
[37:47] the ground no he has purpose he has
[37:49] Vision Peter says it in First
[37:51] Corinthians 9:10 he that plowe should
[37:53] plow in hope he that
[37:56] threshthesky partaker of his hope in
[37:58] other words your labor has purpose your
[38:01] labor has an objective a farmer when
[38:03] he's farming has a reason for farming he
[38:05] has a reason for plowing he has a reason
[38:07] for doing what he's doing and that's
[38:09] what keeps his mind on his objective and
[38:11] that's what keeps him going forward and
[38:13] that's what becomes his motivation and
[38:15] he says Don't Look Back maybe you don't
[38:18] understand what I'm asking you to do if
[38:20] you think you can just go do this and
[38:22] come back and do this he says maybe you
[38:24] need to think about this a little bit
[38:25] more
[38:27] purpose is that your intention your aim
[38:29] or your
[38:30] goal and Jesus is asking these disciples
[38:33] about their
[38:36] reason what what he's talking about the
[38:38] cost of discipleship he's talking about
[38:40] the price they need to pay the standard
[38:42] that that the the the very thing that
[38:44] God is asking him to do and he's saying
[38:46] what's your motive think about it what's
[38:48] your motive what's your objective what's
[38:49] your purpose what's your aim or your
[38:52] goal in what you're trying to do
[39:00] now we
[39:01] know that Faith does not
[39:05] reason or rationalize against the word
[39:08] now I'm coming to my closing thought
[39:10] here but Faith does not reason with the
[39:12] word of God it does not rationalize
[39:14] against the word because the word is our
[39:17] reason and if we don't understand the
[39:19] word we don't understand something in
[39:21] the word that we could say we we'd be
[39:23] better just saying I don't understand it
[39:26] instead of trying to explain it away now
[39:28] I'm not talking about man's
[39:29] interpretations of it not talking about
[39:31] your own intellectual placing of it but
[39:34] faith cannot reason against the word of
[39:37] God it's a sense that does not
[39:40] reason and then and and and brother
[39:42] Andrew this kind of reminds me of what
[39:44] we were talking about the other day
[39:45] there's things that we do know and it's
[39:47] upon the basis of what we know that we
[39:49] then use to examine and look at things
[39:53] as we go forward and if you have faith
[39:54] in the word of God then that becomes
[39:57] basis for discernment because a basis
[40:00] for expecting certain things well why
[40:01] are you expecting that because my faith
[40:03] sees by Revelation I see it in the word
[40:05] of God and I have faith that God's going
[40:07] to do it so it creates this expectation
[40:10] and then God has told me in his word
[40:11] that anybody who has had a revelation
[40:14] makes preparation for it so I'm acting
[40:16] and I'm doing things based upon what I
[40:19] know I'm not just out there throwing
[40:21] seed around hoping something comes up
[40:23] because a farmer doesn't do
[40:26] that so then we must take that word that
[40:29] we have faith and then examine our
[40:30] thinking our rationale our
[40:32] reasoning and that's part of what I'm
[40:34] talking about is understanding reason is
[40:36] we've got a B we got a reason for
[40:37] believing we have a Reason for Hope now
[40:40] let's think more deeply about
[40:44] it because we've got to approach the
[40:46] word Wide
[40:48] Awake you've got to approach it with
[40:50] understanding brother talks about in the
[40:51] seals I hope you're wide awake right
[40:53] that there's there there we've got to
[40:55] have understanding and purpose and the
[40:57] sermon of greater than Solomon is here
[40:59] brother R says your faith is unconscious
[41:01] and some of us are like I thought I
[41:03] that's exactly what I was thinking but
[41:06] your faith is unconscious and he says
[41:07] don't press now or jump so you got to
[41:10] recognize he's dealing with some uh you
[41:12] know someone's wanting to do something
[41:13] your faith is unconscious don't press
[41:15] now or jump you jump away from it it's
[41:19] right with you but John I thought I had
[41:20] that in there he says your faith is
[41:22] unconscious don't press now or jump you
[41:24] jump away from it it's right with you
[41:26] just relax self and believe just believe
[41:28] now have faith so faith is unconscious
[41:32] and he's saying we don't need to just
[41:34] press and get ourselves all emotionally
[41:36] worked up to have
[41:38] faith he says be reverent just have
[41:42] faith I think I think what happened
[41:44] there is someone be G gave an
[41:45] interpretation or there was some uh
[41:47] speaking a Word of Wisdom or something
[41:48] brother man says be reverent just have
[41:50] faith just believe sometimes your faith
[41:52] is unconscious you have it and you don't
[41:54] know
[41:55] it so that's where he's talking about
[41:57] faith is unconscious in the places he
[41:59] says this as he's not saying faith is
[42:01] unconscious in other words it's knocked
[42:02] out or it's sleeping but it's it's there
[42:06] deeper and you're not conscious of it
[42:09] you have it and instead of just quieting
[42:11] yourself down and relaxing and believing
[42:14] and making contact with your faith we
[42:16] try to press and jump get ourselves
[42:19] worked up thinking that's going to tell
[42:21] us we believe oh if I could just scream
[42:23] if I could if I could just cry if I
[42:25] could something happen he says no no no
[42:26] no no you're going to it's right there
[42:28] you'll jump away from it he
[42:31] says so you don't want to get
[42:33] emotionally worked up but you don't want
[42:35] to tranquilize yourself either he's not
[42:37] saying your faith is unconscious so why
[42:39] don't you get unconscious God's word
[42:41] doesn't work by
[42:43] osmosis he says in question and answers
[42:45] part three he says what's the use of
[42:47] jumping up and down shouting speaking in
[42:49] tongues if you don't know what it's all
[42:51] about you got to understand why you're
[42:54] there right that's that's good what's
[42:57] what's the use in jumping shouting
[42:59] speaking in tongues if you don't know
[43:01] what it's for why is it happening what's
[43:03] it all about if you don't understand it
[43:06] why it's why you're doing it what the
[43:08] results are he's saiding what's the
[43:09] point in even doing it now that's a
[43:11] great
[43:12] question do would just would we just
[43:14] speak in tongues just to speak in
[43:16] tongues jump and shout and dance just so
[43:18] we can say that we did because brother
[43:20] Braham said well that's what these
[43:21] Pentecostals don't want this is what the
[43:23] church doesn't want they don't want any
[43:24] of these tongue talking shouting dancing
[43:26] uh uh you know new newborn babes and
[43:28] since that's what the church doesn't
[43:29] want that's what we'll be and we just
[43:31] become tongue talking crying blabbering
[43:33] shouting dancing babes just to try to M
[43:35] meet some quote and invisible union he
[43:38] said well what's it all about why are we
[43:40] here well brother bam said that's what
[43:41] this church doesn't want and that's what
[43:43] Leo de has rejected is these these
[43:45] tongue talking shouting dancing
[43:47] Pentecostal babes that's what they'
[43:48] rejected and say okay fine what is that
[43:52] mean what do you here for what's it all
[43:55] about do we understand why it's here
[43:58] what it what it what it
[44:01] means brother bradam in the sermon
[44:04] presuming these are two long statements
[44:06] from the sermon presuming they're both
[44:07] at the same January 17th of 1962 if you
[44:10] could follow in this we're we're coming
[44:13] close now uh to a close we haven't been
[44:15] very long tonight so we're doing really
[44:16] good on time he says the human soul
[44:19] cries out for something it knows that
[44:22] there's something that brought it here
[44:24] they know that there's something that's
[44:25] beyond here they know that they come
[44:27] from out of the night and they go back
[44:29] into the night and they want to know
[44:31] where they come from and where they're
[44:33] going that's what's Driven all Pursuits
[44:35] of knowledge now if that hunger is in
[44:38] there you can never get it by bliding
[44:41] your
[44:43] mind if that hunger is in there to know
[44:46] you'll never get it by just blanking
[44:47] your mind I'm not going to think anymore
[44:50] I'm just going to stop
[44:52] thinking and then whatever comes into my
[44:54] mind right that's going to be where I'm
[44:56] from and that's where I'm going he said
[44:58] no you can't get it by bliding your mind
[45:00] you know I heard someone was in a
[45:01] meeting here some time ago someone said
[45:04] just let your mind go blank now just
[45:07] look right straight towards the skies
[45:09] let your mind go blank you'll get an
[45:12] experience and no doubt but what you do
[45:15] that's
[45:16] right you but you get an experience but
[45:19] what an
[45:21] experience right now this is the
[45:24] Temptation and I I might have fumbled
[45:26] that that hand off there but we have the
[45:28] one side where we're not wanting to get
[45:29] emotional we're not want to get too
[45:31] worked up and then and then we have all
[45:34] this caution against reason and I've
[45:36] tried to through the the better part of
[45:38] these last two Services just kind of
[45:40] talk point to the fact that there's some
[45:42] on some level there's a way that we can
[45:44] think about the word of God that pleases
[45:46] the Lord or that that that brings us to
[45:48] a place of accepting God's word like
[45:50] we're using our mental capacity we're
[45:52] using our thinking that if in a maybe in
[45:54] a better way of just saying that in the
[45:56] out come of our faith now that we have
[45:58] faith Paul wants our faith to increase
[46:01] in knowledge and wisdom and
[46:02] understanding and Revelation so we're
[46:03] using all these things to recognize that
[46:05] okay maybe I shouldn't just try to Dole
[46:08] my mind maybe I shouldn't just try to
[46:09] become that faith is being numb all
[46:12] right remember how we asked that
[46:14] question is this Faith or am I just numb
[46:16] because there a place where we get where
[46:17] we're not impacted and affected by
[46:18] anything it's because we're not thinking
[46:20] and we're not feeling it's not Faith
[46:22] we're just almost
[46:25] dead he says you can't get it by bliding
[46:27] your mind he says I was in a meeting
[46:28] where someone said just let your mind go
[46:30] blank so could you imagine that if
[46:32] that's how we tried at the end of the
[46:33] service if you need healing just let
[46:35] your mind go blank don't think about
[46:36] anything just open up your heart now
[46:38] don't think about anything he says what
[46:39] kind of experience are you going to get
[46:41] he says you see when you do that you
[46:43] just open your soul to
[46:45] Satan he will give you something that's
[46:48] true now you ready for
[46:51] this but I think a person coming to
[46:53] Christ should come with all the
[46:56] intelligence they got and quoting in
[46:58] their mind when you come to him every
[47:01] promise in the
[47:03] scripture keep your mind alert when you
[47:07] come to
[47:08] Christ is that not asking us to use our
[47:12] power of orderly thought and focus it on
[47:14] the Promises of God and not just bliding
[47:17] our mind and going blank and hoping that
[47:18] we can feel something he said because
[47:20] Satan will give you something to feel
[47:21] but if you're going to come to Christ
[47:23] come with all the intelligence you got
[47:25] thank God he just said all that you got
[47:28] right so that if we don't have a lot we
[47:29] just come with what we have come with
[47:31] whatever intelligence you got quoting in
[47:33] your mind the promises of the word of
[47:35] God keeping your mind alert don't let it
[47:39] go blank amen the devil will make you do
[47:43] anything see they'll give you a
[47:45] sensation he can do that too but you
[47:48] want an experience something that the
[47:50] Bible teaches something that's real amen
[47:54] and you're not going to come to it by
[47:56] bling your mind mind and open up your
[47:57] spirit to any kind of sensation and
[47:59] emotion it's only going to happen when
[48:01] you have your mind stayed on the word of
[48:03] God all the intelligence you God all
[48:05] your facult powers of reason and all
[48:07] your faculty of thought and all your
[48:10] rationale is now focused and being
[48:12] projected towards the promise of God
[48:13] towards the word of God and as that
[48:16] begins to build its momentum something
[48:17] might say well but I don't know about
[48:19] this it says but keep your eye on the
[48:20] promise God has an answer keep your eye
[48:22] on the promise as a way of focusing us
[48:25] he says you want an experience the
[48:26] something that's real and brother Bram
[48:28] says
[48:29] usually experience a company's
[48:32] faith and so that's what our faith ought
[48:35] to be doing is he say experien
[48:36] accompanies faith and he talks about
[48:38] primarily how that when One Believes In
[48:40] Jesus Christ and they're forgiven of
[48:41] their sins and it creates that bond in
[48:43] that relationship that experience gives
[48:45] them confidence and Trust to believe
[48:47] more am now in the same sermon presuming
[48:50] he said I heard someone was in a meeting
[48:52] here some time ago someone said just let
[48:53] your mind go blank let me just it let me
[48:57] just I want to come back to that last
[48:58] part he says keep your mind alert when
[49:01] you come to
[49:02] Christ that's it keep your mind alert
[49:06] when you come to Christ you got to keep
[49:07] your mind open you got to keep your mind
[49:10] alert you got to keep your thoughts on
[49:12] the word of God and the sermon works is
[49:15] Faith
[49:16] expressed he said that's the same way
[49:18] with preaching Divine Healing or
[49:20] anything else as you go along you begin
[49:23] to learn if you don't learn there's
[49:25] something wrong
[49:27] now I'm sharing this just to kind of
[49:28] bring this back into our series on
[49:31] Divine Healing it's the way with
[49:33] preaching Divine Healing or anything
[49:35] else as you go along you got to learn if
[49:37] you're not learning something's
[49:39] wrong says see you've got to learn and
[49:43] you've got to learn how to accept God
[49:45] and what it really means we allow it
[49:48] sometimes say well this guy doesn't have
[49:49] enough Faith this guy didn't do this and
[49:51] this there's a reason there for that
[49:53] there's a reason sometimes it's
[49:55] unconfessed sin
[49:57] I we put it all on faith right well he
[50:00] didn't have enough Faith this guy didn't
[50:01] have enough Faith this guy couldn't do
[50:02] this he couldn't do that because he
[50:03] didn't have enough Faith well let's
[50:05] think a little bit more deeply about
[50:07] that and he says there's a reason
[50:09] sometimes people's faith cannot operate
[50:11] he says sometimes it's unconfessed sin
[50:14] and and this is instructive to a you
[50:16] know to a minister and laying hands on
[50:17] the sick and believing they shall
[50:18] recover and he's saying maybe God put
[50:20] that sickness on them for a reason and
[50:22] you going to you want to do this and you
[50:23] want to try to do that you want to tr
[50:25] try to do all sorts of stuff to get that
[50:26] person healed he says but God has put
[50:28] the sickness on them for that
[50:31] reason and you try to pray it off of him
[50:33] he says God put it there for a reason
[50:35] you'll get yourself in trouble with
[50:37] God he said there's a reason for that
[50:39] there's a reason sometimes it's
[50:40] unconfessed sin that causes a person who
[50:43] wants to believe for their healing to
[50:44] start thinking about their spiritual
[50:48] condition listen to these few statements
[50:50] real quick he says you've got to come
[50:52] first sanely and soundly in God's
[50:55] provided way of approach to him right
[50:57] you see we just read you got to learn
[50:59] how to accept God and what it really
[51:00] means he says there's a you got to come
[51:03] sanely and soundly in God's provided way
[51:05] of approach he's praying in this one
[51:07] service he says father they've come
[51:09] sanely moving up not emotionally just
[51:11] come soberly using he's referring to
[51:15] sanity says I believe God's fixing to do
[51:17] something great but now we got to
[51:19] approach it sanely intelligently right
[51:22] in the word of
[51:23] God no that's what he's bringing us back
[51:25] to not bliding our minds not blanking
[51:28] ourselves off not cutting away our power
[51:31] to think but taking that thought and
[51:34] taking our thinking and putting it on
[51:35] the word of God and the sermon
[51:39] expectancy he says faith is not
[51:42] mythical something mentally worked
[51:45] up it's an absolutely fundamental result
[51:49] that happens in a person's
[51:51] heart when faith is appropriated then
[51:54] it's something in the person's heart
[51:57] but it can't be based on say well go
[51:58] touch a tree and you'll get well or pray
[52:01] to the post it's got to have a
[52:03] foundation it's got to have a reason he
[52:06] says here it is I want you to get it how
[52:07] much more Foundation can you place your
[52:09] faith on any level than the word of God
[52:12] what more could you put Faith
[52:14] in because it's not
[52:17] mythical something mentally worked up
[52:19] it's an absolute fundamental result in a
[52:21] person's heart and if we're not careful
[52:23] we can make what we believe and what
[52:25] we're looking for
[52:27] mythical to everybody else they don't
[52:30] understand it they don't understand it
[52:31] they don't understand you've made it
[52:33] mythical because you don't understand
[52:35] it it's a you it's mythical and Mystic
[52:38] to you because you're just saying well I
[52:40] believe it well what is it you believe
[52:42] it I mean I believe it I believe the
[52:45] message well what is the message right
[52:48] there's fellowship with somebody here
[52:49] recently and I said and I just asked
[52:51] them if they knew what their Pastor
[52:53] believed and they didn't
[52:54] know how long has he been pastor ping
[52:57] you're all wanting Clues I'm not going
[52:58] to tell you how long he's been
[53:00] pastoring he started pastoring in 2020
[53:02] no it's like do you even know what your
[53:04] pastor believes and it's like well no
[53:07] how many years you heard him preach it's
[53:09] like well real long time are you
[53:11] thinking about what you're
[53:12] hearing right are you processing these
[53:15] things do you have a basis do you
[53:17] understand what the message taught it's
[53:19] not just bliding our minds and going
[53:21] blank and numbing ourselves but really
[53:22] grasping the real heart of the word of
[53:24] God the problem is brother says people
[53:26] don't dig down deep enough and get into
[53:28] the spirit of
[53:30] Revelation last statement in the sermon
[53:32] I have heard but now I see it I think
[53:34] this might just be a a beautiful place
[53:36] and just feeling I've delivered this
[53:38] burden on this thought about our
[53:40] understanding our reason last statement
[53:42] here says brother says but first you see
[53:44] your motive and objectives have to be
[53:46] right you have to have reasons for
[53:50] this God don't give you those things
[53:52] just because you
[53:53] ask God I want to be healed okay okay
[53:56] what why he's like
[53:58] wait I got to have a reason like I just
[54:02] want to borrow the car why do you want
[54:03] to borrow the car son you need to know
[54:06] that yeah I want to know that when are
[54:09] you going to bring it back what I got to
[54:11] bring it back at a certain time huh I'll
[54:14] just go get my own
[54:17] car there's a reason and it's so
[54:20] beautiful and you cannot ask in faith
[54:22] unless there's a real objective to that
[54:24] to be in the will of God right amen and
[54:28] I know we've heard this before but just
[54:29] hope it kind of can catch us a little
[54:31] bit more deeply today if you want to be
[54:33] well what do you want to be well
[54:35] for I mean what a what a statement what
[54:38] do you want to be well
[54:40] for see if you want to be healed what's
[54:43] the reason you want to be
[54:44] healed now I do not believe that brother
[54:47] bradam is taking this subject of healing
[54:49] and I hope that what I'm doing is not
[54:51] taking just the subject of the word of
[54:53] God and now everything has to become an
[54:54] analytical session we're going to
[54:56] analyze we're going to dissect we're try
[54:58] to figure this out and going to figure
[54:59] that out listen it's just causing us to
[55:01] realize that faith means more to us than
[55:05] just on a very shallow and surface way
[55:08] saying I believe I believe no there's
[55:11] more to it than that why because Devils
[55:13] believe and tremble and we believe
[55:16] without the trembling so it goes deeper
[55:18] for deeper for them than it does for us
[55:20] he says when you he says what what do
[55:22] you want to be healed for what's your
[55:24] reason it's just causes not to become
[55:26] overthinkers not to become analytical
[55:28] but to challenge ourselves do I have a
[55:31] reason do I have what's my motive what's
[55:33] my objective am I thinking about this
[55:35] because as we were emphasizing last
[55:37] Sunday I believe that if our soul is
[55:40] sealed and and we're sick that what we
[55:43] want the most important thing we want is
[55:45] the right
[55:46] attitude because the new body is coming
[55:49] and then if I can focus on having the
[55:51] right attitude the right temperament the
[55:53] right mood and the right Spirit the
[55:54] right kind of character the right kind
[55:55] of honesty and just and have God develop
[55:58] my character and put me in the right
[56:00] attitude then the right attitude will
[56:02] bring God's word to pass but you'll be
[56:04] amazed at what the right attitude will
[56:07] do in your attitude toward your
[56:10] sickness like you know what it's just
[56:13] cosmetic right or you know what I I can
[56:17] do this God will give me Grace and just
[56:19] even in Your Attitude Change towards it
[56:21] can relax you enough to find out wait a
[56:23] minute it's gone amen
[56:27] he says what's your reason what are you
[56:29] telling God what do you want to do with
[56:31] your life when you get
[56:33] healed you've got to have a motive and
[56:37] objective and they have to be right
[56:39] according to the will of God and then
[56:42] when the faith is revealed to you and by
[56:43] God his Sovereign Grace and God by his
[56:46] Sovereign Grace places that faith in
[56:48] there then it's
[56:52] over is that
[56:54] beautiful then it's over
[56:57] amen but you have to have a reason for
[57:00] this God bless you tonight I trust the
[57:02] Lord spoke to your heart am a lot to
[57:04] think about say well brother Aon you
[57:06] just raised a lot of questions well
[57:07] we're talking about understanding reason
[57:09] right we want to think about these
[57:11] things not as not to give us Faith but
[57:14] to understand our faith you've got faith
[57:17] use it we've got the word of God let's
[57:20] think about it let's consider it we we
[57:23] could begin to think about the word of
[57:25] God in so many different areas and say
[57:26] now if I took this process then if we
[57:29] believe that certain things have been
[57:31] revealed and we think certain scriptures
[57:33] have been fulfilled maybe we ought to
[57:34] ponder those things am maybe we want to
[57:37] consider these things and take them into
[57:38] our heart as Mary did and says and I'm
[57:40] going to keep these things and I'm going
[57:41] to think about them and think about what
[57:42] they're to produce and what does it look
[57:44] like and what if brother bam did
[57:46] accomplish this if the word of God has
[57:48] been fulfilled if this is what God's
[57:49] wanting to do we begin to think about it
[57:51] in such a way to where our lives that
[57:55] happens just exactly what Paul was
[57:56] wanting that we would have that Spirit
[57:58] of wisdom and of Revelation and the
[57:59] knowledge of him we can know what the
[58:01] hope of this calling is and what the
[58:03] riches are of The Inheritance that he's
[58:05] given to the Saints God bless you
[58:07] tonight let's Stand Together
