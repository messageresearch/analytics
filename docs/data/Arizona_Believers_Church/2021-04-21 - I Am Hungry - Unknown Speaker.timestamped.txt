[0:00] isaiah chapter 55 reverses
[0:03] 1 to 13. it's the whole chapter i'm not
[0:06] going to be able to
[0:07] touch on maybe some of the parts um from
[0:09] verse
[0:11] in you know even verses 6 to 13 but i
[0:13] wanted just to have them in the
[0:14] background is
[0:15] i've been focusing on this subject for
[0:17] some time now and it's just been
[0:20] really captivating my attention oh
[0:22] everyone that thirsteth come ye to the
[0:24] waters and he that hath no money come ye
[0:26] buy
[0:27] and eat yea come buy wine and milk
[0:30] without money and without price he's
[0:31] talking about the value of it can't even
[0:33] be measured
[0:34] wherefore do you spend money for that
[0:36] which is not bread
[0:37] and your labor for that which satisfyeth
[0:39] not hearken diligently unto me and ee
[0:42] that which is good and let your soul
[0:44] delight in its fatness incline your ear
[0:46] and come unto me here and your soul
[0:48] shall live
[0:49] and i will make an everlasting covenant
[0:51] with you even the sure mercies of david
[0:53] behold i have given him for witness to
[0:55] the people a leader and commander
[0:57] to the people behold thou shalt call a
[0:59] nation that thou knowest not in nations
[1:01] that knew not
[1:02] thee shall run unto thee because of the
[1:04] lord thy god and for the holy one of
[1:06] israel
[1:06] for he hath glorified thee israel
[1:09] recognized this as a prophecy of the
[1:11] messiah and how all nations would come
[1:13] in the glorious light of the messiah to
[1:15] worship in israel
[1:16] verse 6 seek ye the lord while he may be
[1:18] found call ye upon him while he is near
[1:21] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[1:22] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[1:24] return unto the lord and he will have
[1:26] mercy upon him
[1:27] and to our god for he will abundantly
[1:29] pardon for my thoughts are not your
[1:31] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[1:32] saith the lord
[1:33] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:35] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:37] ways
[1:37] and my thoughts than your thoughts for
[1:40] as the rain cometh down on the snow from
[1:41] heaven and returneth not thither
[1:43] but watereth the earth and maketh it
[1:45] bring forth and bud that it may give
[1:47] seed to the sower and bread to the eater
[1:50] so shall my word be that go with
[1:53] forth out of my mouth and it shall not
[1:55] return unto me void but will accomplish
[1:57] that which i please
[1:58] and it shall prosper in the thing
[2:00] whereto i sent it
[2:01] for ye shall go out with joy and be led
[2:03] forth with peace the mountains and the
[2:04] hills shall break forth before you into
[2:06] singing
[2:07] and all the trees of the field shall
[2:08] clap their hands instead of the thorns
[2:10] shall come up the fir tree and instead
[2:12] of the bride shall come up the myrtle
[2:13] tree
[2:14] and it shall be to the lord for a name
[2:16] for an everlasting sign
[2:17] that shall not be cut off amen you can
[2:20] have your seats
[2:22] my title is i am hungry and it's calling
[2:25] on
[2:26] a sermon that we ministered a little bit
[2:28] earlier this year it may have been in
[2:30] march sometime
[2:31] i can't remember exactly when but i
[2:32] think it was in march on hungary and
[2:34] asking the question are you hungry or
[2:36] kind of provoking thought
[2:37] to consider what kind of longings and
[2:39] desires that someone might have within
[2:41] themselves
[2:42] and so since we were asking the question
[2:44] hungry now
[2:46] this is uh just the response of the
[2:48] believer i am hungry there is a hunger
[2:50] and thirst in my heart and i want to
[2:52] begin by looking in john chapter 6
[2:55] and we'll be reading a few verses i
[2:56] think beginning around verse 33
[2:59] but as we ministered on it last time the
[3:01] last time we ministered on this subject
[3:03] we were identifying how in john chapter
[3:05] five
[3:06] uh you know the different miracles that
[3:08] were being accomplished and how that
[3:10] after jesus had accomplished these
[3:12] wonderful miracles people
[3:13] sought him and there were multitudes of
[3:15] people that sought christ because they
[3:17] had ate bread
[3:18] and they'd ate fish and it satisfied
[3:20] their natural hunger
[3:22] and so they were hungry and they felt
[3:23] the pangs of hunger maybe a stomach
[3:25] growling
[3:26] and the bible says that you did eat and
[3:28] you were full so they were satisfied
[3:30] this natural urge that
[3:32] every man or woman would have this
[3:34] natural need that we have as humans
[3:36] was met and it was so miraculous because
[3:38] man has need to eat and here was
[3:41] hands that could take fish and take
[3:42] bread and multiply it and
[3:45] the base need that every man has and we
[3:47] have in common
[3:48] and has to has to partake in in order to
[3:51] live and to have life and to enjoy life
[3:53] was provided by the hands of the messiah
[3:55] so people were
[3:56] drawn to that and jesus rebuked him
[3:59] saying look you're coming to me because
[4:01] your bellies are full
[4:02] and you would want to see more miracles
[4:04] that do something for your flesh
[4:06] and what we identified is how their
[4:08] natural
[4:10] hunger and the natural needs that were
[4:12] met were more important than the word
[4:14] that could meet their spiritual needs
[4:16] the the natural satisfaction the things
[4:18] that it could do to the flesh the things
[4:20] that it even
[4:21] energized them in their emotions and
[4:22] their spirits it meant more to them
[4:24] than really the deep eternal uh the word
[4:28] and how it could meet eternal needs and
[4:29] supernatural needs and spiritual needs
[4:32] as we know just even identifying how
[4:34] christ was coming to rescue them from
[4:36] sin
[4:37] this is the great deliverance this is
[4:38] what the messiah was for that was the
[4:40] bondage that they could be loosed from
[4:42] not not worrying about how you're going
[4:43] to get your next meal there was
[4:44] something greater than all of that
[4:47] and so they were unconscious to how this
[4:49] natural desire was warping their sense
[4:51] of value
[4:52] that they could see a miracle take place
[4:54] and and instead of it awakening them
[4:57] think
[4:57] think well he's taking bread and fish
[5:00] and he's multiplying it we've never seen
[5:02] anything like this before and
[5:04] and instead of catching their attention
[5:06] to think what's going on here this is
[5:08] let's get past the surface of this let's
[5:10] get past the bread and the fish and
[5:12] and the meat and cheese and let's really
[5:13] think what could this be
[5:15] instead of them recognizing that this
[5:18] natural desire being drawn to the
[5:20] natural benefit kind of warped their
[5:22] sense of value
[5:23] because they would have been happy just
[5:24] getting more bread they would have been
[5:26] happy with getting more fish so
[5:28] i think as we said before it kind of
[5:29] this hunger this natural hunger in the
[5:31] flesh and this desire of the flesh
[5:32] had hijacked their thinking to where it
[5:34] wasn't getting down deep to the real
[5:36] root of what mattered
[5:38] and we were looking at how they had not
[5:40] fully caught the supernatural
[5:41] significance
[5:42] of the sign so here's a sign that's
[5:45] being performed before them and they
[5:47] don't catch the real
[5:48] supernatural significance behind it
[5:50] here's a miracle being performed
[5:53] but the purpose of the miracle hasn't
[5:55] fully overwhelmed them
[5:56] because they're still just wanting to
[5:58] see the miracle they're still just
[5:59] wanting to see
[6:01] something happen that can satisfy their
[6:02] flesh and so they had not fully grasped
[6:05] who it was that was in their midst they
[6:07] hadn't fully recognized that this was
[6:09] the messiah and what he came to do
[6:12] so jesus says in john chapter 6 verses
[6:14] 33 to 35
[6:18] for the bread of god is he which cometh
[6:20] down from heaven
[6:22] and giveth life unto the world
[6:25] now they had in in wrestling with this
[6:27] question
[6:28] they had brought up well uh moses gave
[6:31] us bread in the wilderness and
[6:32] and moses k the bread came by the hand
[6:34] of moses
[6:35] and jesus kind of rebukes them in that
[6:37] so they they bring the exodus into view
[6:39] they bring the bread that came down in
[6:41] the wilderness into view
[6:42] but jesus is now saying that moses
[6:44] didn't give you that bread god gave you
[6:46] that bread and the bread that god gives
[6:48] is he which cometh down from heaven and
[6:50] giveth life
[6:51] unto the world and in john chapter six
[6:54] jesus is specifically pointing to
[6:56] himself as the living bread of life that
[6:59] is more important than any daily bread
[7:01] that is actually more significant and
[7:03] more precious than daily food he's
[7:05] saying i am
[7:06] the bread of god i am the living bread
[7:08] of life
[7:09] and so when he says for the bread of god
[7:12] is he which cometh down from heaven
[7:14] and giveth life unto the world they said
[7:16] unto him lord evermore
[7:18] give us this bread let us have of this
[7:21] bread that we may eat of it give it
[7:22] give us more of this if this really is
[7:25] bread that we can eat and it's from god
[7:26] then we want more of it
[7:28] but in asking for the bread that they
[7:30] may eat just even what they say they
[7:32] didn't they're not saying whoa
[7:33] this bread of god which comes down from
[7:35] heaven let us let us receive him let us
[7:38] have him that it may give his life and
[7:40] energize us they're still using a
[7:41] language that well lord
[7:43] give us this bread we're hungry let us
[7:45] have this bread they were still
[7:46] asking for natural bread they were still
[7:49] asking for natural meat which would
[7:50] prolong
[7:51] on their days upon earth or nurture
[7:53] their flesh and give them
[7:54] the vitamins and the energy that they
[7:56] need
[7:58] jesus says in verse 35 i am the bread of
[8:00] life
[8:01] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[8:03] and he that believeth on me
[8:05] shall never thirst what a remarkable
[8:07] statement he that cometh to me shall
[8:09] never hunger and he that believeth on me
[8:11] shall never thirst now someone could
[8:13] read that and again
[8:14] the the jews that day could be saying
[8:16] well if i never am thirsty again if i'm
[8:18] never hungry again and i can just
[8:19] live and have have vitality and energy
[8:22] and life with never having to eat never
[8:23] having to drink again then
[8:24] i'll take that but clearly jesus is
[8:27] pointing to
[8:28] a greater thirst and a greater hunger
[8:30] that natural bread cannot satisfy
[8:33] he's pointing to something great he says
[8:35] i am the bread of life this is the
[8:37] living bread of life
[8:38] he that joins together with him he that
[8:40] cometh to me is going to receive
[8:42] substance that satisfies the deep
[8:44] groaning within his heart
[8:45] he that comes to this fountain is going
[8:47] to drink of something to where he'll
[8:49] never thirst again
[8:51] and we looked at john chapter 4 how that
[8:52] jesus had come to the well and there was
[8:54] a woman
[8:55] of samaria there drawing water and jesus
[8:58] asked for some water and she says well
[8:59] the well is deep you have nothing to
[9:01] draw with and jesus said if you knew who
[9:02] you were talking to
[9:04] you'd ask me for a drink and there's
[9:05] kind of this back and forth going on
[9:07] between them and jesus is saying hey
[9:09] the water i have if you'll partake of it
[9:11] you'll never thirst again
[9:13] and in john chapter 4 verse 14 it says
[9:15] the woman said unto him
[9:16] sir give me this water that i thirst not
[9:20] neither come hither to draw and so again
[9:23] her
[9:24] her response is very similar to what
[9:25] jesus says later in john chapter six i'm
[9:27] the bread of life if you come to me
[9:29] you'll never hunger
[9:30] you partake of me you'll never thirst he
[9:32] says this to the woman of samaria
[9:34] and says i have this water that'll come
[9:36] forth and she says give me this water
[9:38] that i thirst not
[9:39] neither come hither to draw but yet we
[9:41] we understand from the scripture
[9:42] that it had not fully dawned on her what
[9:44] he was referring to
[9:46] that she really wasn't catching the
[9:47] significance of it
[9:49] and and i want to just take a moment to
[9:51] correct something
[9:52] maybe just correct some emphasis that i
[9:54] had made on that sunday when we
[9:55] ministered on this
[9:57] i as i look at this scripture as i've
[9:59] always understood the scripture
[10:01] when she says lord give me this water
[10:04] that i thirst not
[10:05] that i neither come hither to draw as we
[10:07] read that it strikes us that she's
[10:09] obviously saying
[10:10] lord give me this water so that i never
[10:12] thirst again and give me this water that
[10:14] i
[10:15] that that i don't have to come hither to
[10:17] draw if i can end this
[10:18] exercise it'll be great and and what has
[10:21] struck me even that week as i studied up
[10:23] to this point is how that
[10:24] she's still looking at it in a natural
[10:26] sense
[10:27] she's thinking that if she could get
[10:29] this water she's never going to have to
[10:30] come draw water again so
[10:32] really the emphasis of the scripture and
[10:33] what the scripture is trying to identify
[10:35] is that she wasn't fully catching what
[10:37] jesus was saying
[10:39] and and so i think that's the clear
[10:40] meaning of the scripture
[10:43] and and i recall as i was ministering on
[10:45] this it just struck me in a different
[10:47] way and so my emphasis i believe that
[10:48] morning was that she's saying that
[10:50] i didn't even thirst for this water i
[10:52] wasn't coming to draw this water
[10:54] whatever water you're offering
[10:55] i i'm not thirsty for and i don't need
[10:57] and i just wanted to point out that i
[10:59] realized maybe my emphasis in that
[11:00] moment
[11:01] might be a little bit different than
[11:02] what we've always understood the
[11:04] scripture to be
[11:04] and i don't want my emphasis in the
[11:06] moment change what our understanding of
[11:08] the word is
[11:08] so if it seemed to be a little bit
[11:10] confusing i just wanted to correct
[11:12] uh just how in that moment it struck me
[11:14] how to where she's not fully
[11:15] recognizing it and i don't know why i
[11:17] read it that way when i was reading it
[11:19] then she says this is not water i was
[11:20] thirsty for
[11:21] this is not water that i came to draw
[11:23] that was my emphasis the scripture is
[11:25] very clear that she's saying give me
[11:27] water so that i never thirst again
[11:29] and that i don't have to come to draw
[11:31] but it's the same response as these
[11:33] broth
[11:33] these uh men and and women in john 36
[11:37] chapters 36
[11:38] chapter six where they say well let us
[11:40] have this ever more lord give us this
[11:42] bread
[11:43] and when jesus is emphasizing how he's
[11:45] the bread which came down from heaven i
[11:47] am the bread of life i am the one that
[11:48] comes down out of heaven
[11:50] it says in john chapter 6 41 the jews
[11:53] then murmured at him because he said
[11:55] i am the bread which came down from
[11:57] heaven when he's clearly identified
[11:59] himself
[12:00] as the one that they would have to
[12:02] partake of this is where they murmured
[12:04] against him and we know that
[12:05] we could even imagine how they say well
[12:07] does he literally mean that we have to
[12:09] take his flesh and
[12:10] drink his blood is this some sort of uh
[12:12] human sacrifice cult what kind of death
[12:15] cult is this what what kind of vampirism
[12:17] is this
[12:18] and they said this and they said in
[12:20] verse 42 when he says i am the bread of
[12:22] life verse 42
[12:23] is not this jesus the son of joseph
[12:26] whose father and mother we know
[12:27] how is it then that he saith i am come
[12:29] down from heaven
[12:31] what did this identify as we look at the
[12:33] difference between the woman of samaria
[12:35] and these
[12:35] these in john chapter 6 there was no
[12:38] hunger for true redemption
[12:40] though the woman of samaria was saying
[12:42] well you know give me this water there
[12:43] still was a further unfolding and a
[12:46] further expression of the word that
[12:48] quickens something inside of her because
[12:50] she's redeemable
[12:51] and she hungered for that she thirst for
[12:53] that and because she was hungry for
[12:55] redemption the word met that need that
[12:57] she had in her heart
[12:58] but these others in john chapter 6 they
[13:00] had no there was no greater thirst that
[13:02] could be quickened by the manifestation
[13:05] of the word
[13:06] the word is just firing off the word is
[13:07] being manifested the word is being
[13:09] uh made clear before them and there was
[13:11] nothing in them to quicken
[13:14] and so here they are asking jesus about
[13:17] the
[13:17] the miracles and they come finding oh
[13:18] you only seek me because you saw the
[13:21] the bread and you saw the multiplication
[13:23] of food and that's why you're here and
[13:24] they said well even
[13:25] moses gave us bread in the wilderness
[13:27] and the miracles in the wilderness that
[13:29] they even pointed to was speaking of a
[13:32] greater bread like the very subject
[13:34] matter they point to to try to
[13:37] get jesus to multiply the bread and
[13:39] multiply the fish
[13:40] jesus could go right back to that very
[13:42] instance and said well did not
[13:43] the lord say that he did this so that
[13:45] you would recognize that the word is
[13:47] greater
[13:48] that if god is going to pour out bread
[13:51] into the wilderness and cause quail to
[13:53] fall in the morning
[13:54] then what you ought to do when that
[13:55] happens is not develop this sense of
[13:57] entitlement that we need more bread and
[13:59] we need more quail but to fear the god
[14:02] that can drop bread down every morning
[14:05] and listen to the god that's allowing
[14:07] quail to come to meet your needs
[14:09] and so instead of just getting so
[14:10] narrowed in on the fact that oh we're
[14:12] eating we're drinking
[14:13] we have what we need to say wait a
[14:15] minute who is it that could do this
[14:18] to recognize that his word must be
[14:20] greater his promises must be greater
[14:22] if he could do this then he can do
[14:23] greater and so they had no hunger for
[14:26] redemption
[14:27] there was no nothing deeper inside of
[14:29] them because even the miracle that they
[14:31] pointed to spoke of something greater
[14:33] in deuteronomy chapter eight verse three
[14:35] and i know this is
[14:37] i'm taking much more time with the
[14:38] review than i thought i would
[14:40] but but i'm enjoying it so if you don't
[14:42] mind just humor me
[14:44] and it says in deuteronomy chapter 8
[14:45] verse 3 and he humbled thee and suffered
[14:47] thee to hunger
[14:48] so he allowed them to get hungry and fed
[14:51] thee with manna
[14:52] so he's feeding them with manna which
[14:54] thou knewest not neither did thy fathers
[14:57] know that he might make
[14:59] thee know that man doth not live by
[15:02] bread only
[15:03] so why did he cause the bread to come
[15:06] down out of heaven he suffered them to
[15:07] hunger then fed them with manna he
[15:09] suffered them the hunger and then fed
[15:10] them with quail
[15:11] well why did he do this supernatural
[15:13] work why did he do this sign before him
[15:16] it says so that he listen that man doth
[15:18] not live by bread alone that they may
[15:20] know that this quail and this man and
[15:23] this bread
[15:23] is not the only substance that they
[15:25] ought to live by but by every word that
[15:27] proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord
[15:29] doth
[15:30] man live as we were reading in isaiah 55
[15:34] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[15:36] of my mouth what is it it's like the
[15:39] seed that goes forth then the rain goes
[15:41] forth and then the plant comes up and it
[15:43] brings forth the grain
[15:44] and then the grain is taken and brought
[15:46] made into bread that it might
[15:47] be bread to the eater he says so my word
[15:50] that comes forth out of my mouth
[15:51] it shall not return unto me void but
[15:53] shall accomplish that which i please
[15:55] it shall prosper the thing whereunto i
[15:57] sent it in the thing wherein to i sent
[15:59] it just as the rain comes upon the seed
[16:02] and the eater enjoys the bread and it
[16:04] benefits the sower it benefits the eater
[16:07] he's saying my word is like that the
[16:09] word that goeth forth out of my mouth
[16:11] has a purpose and it has an intent and
[16:14] so he
[16:15] wanted the reason why he pours out this
[16:17] manna is so that they may know that man
[16:19] does not live by bread
[16:20] only as jesus says man shall not live by
[16:23] bread alone but by every word that
[16:25] proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord
[16:27] doth man live one translation says but
[16:31] by all which is created by the word of
[16:33] the lord
[16:33] is the life of man wanting them to
[16:37] recognize that there's something greater
[16:39] and when god says this in deuteronomy
[16:41] chapter 8 when jesus refers to it later
[16:43] in matthew chapter 3 it's not suggesting
[16:46] and here jesus or excuse me god is not
[16:48] suggesting that the israelites wouldn't
[16:51] ever need natural food once they came
[16:53] into the promised land
[16:54] but that they had to live by obeying the
[16:56] voice of god
[16:58] this is the emphasis man does not live
[17:00] by bread alone or bad only but by every
[17:02] word that proceedeth out of the mouth
[17:04] the lord doth man live
[17:05] man should live by obeying god's word
[17:09] through dependence upon god's word
[17:10] through obedience to god's word
[17:12] they would continue under his provision
[17:14] they would continue under his protection
[17:16] does that not summarize what god said to
[17:18] him as long as you
[17:19] listen to my word and obey my word as
[17:21] you as long as you obey
[17:22] and as long as you depend upon me as
[17:25] long as you obey me
[17:26] as long as you continue under under my
[17:28] word then i will continue to provide
[17:30] and i will continue to protect it as
[17:32] soon as you stop
[17:33] trusting me as soon as you stop
[17:35] depending upon me as soon as you stop
[17:36] obeying me then my provision and my
[17:38] protection is going to be taken away
[17:40] and that was what he wanted israel to
[17:42] learn that man is not just going to live
[17:44] by having manna
[17:45] man is not just going to live by having
[17:46] quail and it's not bread
[17:48] from the ground and water from the rock
[17:50] but it these things these miracles and
[17:52] these signs
[17:53] spoke of a greater word that they could
[17:55] attach themselves to
[17:56] and needed to depend upon and needed to
[17:58] obey in order to live
[18:01] thus we do not live in our body only by
[18:03] meat
[18:04] this is how jesus even emphasizes it
[18:07] when
[18:08] he's being tempted to turn these stones
[18:09] into bread he says well man shall not
[18:11] live by bread alone we do not live in
[18:13] our body only by bread only by meat but
[18:15] in our soul
[18:16] we live in our soul by the word of god
[18:21] the believer lives a spiritual life by
[18:23] feeding on christ the word
[18:26] this is the emphasis that's been in my
[18:27] heart over the last few days
[18:30] is it so important for us to not forget
[18:32] this as believers
[18:34] to always if we can if i say this always
[18:36] have an edge on us
[18:39] we're always we're always seem to have
[18:40] this penchant or
[18:42] this hunger for the word of god
[18:43] realizing that no matter what blessings
[18:45] come my way no matter how good things
[18:47] get no matter how healthy i feel and how
[18:49] good my job is and how
[18:50] great these my income is at this time
[18:52] and i'm debt free and i'm healthy and
[18:54] these are happening or great things are
[18:55] happening no matter what seems to be
[18:57] going well or even what seems to be
[18:58] going wrong in the world that we must
[19:00] have a
[19:00] hunger for the word of god and not lose
[19:04] sight of that not lose sight of how
[19:05] precious the scripture is not lose sight
[19:07] of how
[19:07] precious the voice of god on this day is
[19:10] and take advantage of how these things
[19:12] are made available to us
[19:13] that we could feed on and listen to chur
[19:15] having church twice a week if we have
[19:17] three services a week if we had four
[19:19] services a week
[19:20] that should never be a substitute for
[19:22] you
[19:23] feeding on the word of god and actively
[19:25] feeding on the things that god has
[19:26] provided us
[19:27] because man shall not live by bread
[19:29] alone but he lives by the word that
[19:31] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[19:34] that's what the scriptures are pointing
[19:35] to we cannot trust in ourselves to
[19:36] support life
[19:39] we have to trust in god because it's
[19:42] god's word and i say this in all things
[19:43] it's god's word that brings its
[19:45] efficiency
[19:47] i say if you if you have a sufficient
[19:49] income if christ isn't in it it can
[19:51] become insufficient very quickly
[19:53] you can have sufficient food for health
[19:55] but if christ isn't in it it can become
[19:56] insufficient or deficient very quickly
[19:59] so in everything we do and everything we
[20:00] endeavor to do and everything we say and
[20:02] everything we eat
[20:03] everything we set forth to do there
[20:04] ought to be thanksgiving given to god
[20:06] saying that i know that if there's any
[20:08] good thing that's come from you
[20:09] and that through christ things could be
[20:11] made sufficient
[20:13] if i could join what we're speaking on
[20:15] sunday to this in psalms 100 verse 3
[20:18] know ye that the lord he is god it is he
[20:22] that hath made us and not we ourselves
[20:25] we are his people and the sheep of his
[20:27] pasture
[20:29] it is he that hath made us he's the
[20:31] designer he's the creator
[20:33] he's the one that in creating us has
[20:34] given us a particular intent
[20:36] but he's designed us wherein we have
[20:38] certain needs we have certain feelings
[20:40] we have certain wants
[20:41] we have things ways about us that only
[20:43] he knows
[20:45] we have not made ourselves but he has
[20:47] made us and then in this description
[20:49] of how that we have been made it says
[20:51] that we are his people and the sheep of
[20:53] his pasture
[20:54] in other words he has made us and then
[20:56] set us and ordained us for a field where
[20:58] we can eat
[21:00] where we can be safe we can be protected
[21:02] we can be provided for
[21:03] and he's the one that's going to be
[21:05] given care and oversight over us and so
[21:07] he's made us a particular way he's made
[21:09] us with needs he's made us with desires
[21:11] he's made us with weaknesses and
[21:12] vulnerabilities that he can protect
[21:14] and so that causes us to be as sheep who
[21:17] are dependent upon the shepherd
[21:19] i can't just run off into the mountains
[21:21] and find what i need i need to stay in
[21:22] the field
[21:23] where he's feeding i can't just go and
[21:25] take care of myself because i need one
[21:26] to
[21:27] to to to manage my care and to look out
[21:30] after me and it's he that has made me
[21:32] and he's the one that knows best
[21:35] and so these scriptures are speaking to
[21:36] how that we should not depend upon
[21:38] natural things alone
[21:40] but depend absolutely entirely in even
[21:43] immediately instinctively
[21:45] on god for life and all things
[21:48] we ought to be dependent upon him if
[21:50] it's he that has made us and we are his
[21:52] people
[21:52] and the sheep of his pasture then it
[21:54] evokes this image of a dependent sheep
[21:56] that i'm relying upon
[21:58] you i'm absolutely entirely and
[22:00] instinctively
[22:01] immediately depending upon you for the
[22:04] preservation
[22:05] of my body for the protection of my life
[22:07] for provision for protection for
[22:08] pleasure
[22:09] i am entirely dependent upon you
[22:13] it is he that hath made us
[22:18] and he's made us to hunger he's made us
[22:21] to thirst
[22:23] not just for bread alone but by for the
[22:26] word that comes from his mouth
[22:29] in chapter 10 of the church age book
[22:31] when brother branham is giving the
[22:32] resume
[22:33] of the ages and he's kind of going back
[22:35] through and summarizing
[22:36] he refers to the the first church age
[22:40] and i
[22:41] had been uh looking at this
[22:45] how the the first church age they had
[22:46] left their first love
[22:48] it has such remarkable depth to it i
[22:51] i've been pondering it very deeply
[22:54] and it says already that first age had
[22:56] turned
[22:57] now when they had left their first love
[22:59] this is how brother brown begins to
[23:00] describe their turning
[23:01] from following the pure word of god
[23:04] so the word was their first love they
[23:07] had turned from following
[23:08] the pure word of god and notice they
[23:11] turned from
[23:12] god's demand so christ the word
[23:16] is their first love but now he says
[23:17] they've turned from god's demand
[23:19] it is he that hath made us not we
[23:20] ourselves we are his people and the
[23:22] sheep of his pastor
[23:23] now this is the demand of the creator
[23:26] this is a very important statement to us
[23:29] and i
[23:29] hope that you could write this down if
[23:31] not we can make it available to you
[23:33] they had turned from god's demand what
[23:35] is it that god demands what is it that
[23:36] god requires what is it that god wants
[23:38] a church absolutely dependent upon him
[23:43] this is what he wants therefore we
[23:46] recognize that our maturity in christ
[23:48] does not produce
[23:49] an arrogancy or presumptive attitude
[23:51] where we feel that we can be more
[23:53] independent of him
[23:54] but as we grow and as we mature we begin
[23:57] to yield more become
[23:58] more dependent and more needy and the
[24:00] world thinks man what are you becoming
[24:02] just this big push pushover a big
[24:03] weakling and say well maybe in your eyes
[24:05] but in his eyes
[24:06] i'm maturing i'm becoming more dependent
[24:10] because god demands a church
[24:12] not just sometimes dependent like when
[24:15] we're sick
[24:16] and things aren't going well no he wants
[24:19] us absolutely dependent upon him
[24:21] and then i love this parenthetical
[24:23] phrase depending
[24:24] entirely upon god to fulfill his word
[24:27] from start to finish
[24:28] apart from human government god demands
[24:32] us as individuals to be in absolutely
[24:36] dependent
[24:37] upon him depending entirely upon him
[24:42] to start and to finish so what they had
[24:45] done is they had turned
[24:47] from god's requirement to be absolutely
[24:50] dependent upon him
[24:51] and they turned to nicolaitanism that's
[24:55] a big word
[24:56] you can do it in scrabble it might work
[24:58] out well for you
[25:01] nicolaitanism they turn to nicolatinism
[25:04] and here's brother branham's
[25:05] definition which is organizing a human
[25:08] government within the church
[25:10] which is all governments do legislate
[25:13] for the people
[25:15] so there would be an organizing of a
[25:17] human government which was to
[25:19] legislate for the people there was some
[25:21] substitution there was replacement
[25:23] they turned from being absolutely and
[25:25] entirely dependent upon
[25:26] the lord and they turned to human
[25:29] government
[25:30] human government would be the bur would
[25:32] be birthed by human intuition and human
[25:34] instinct and human desire
[25:36] human needs and all these base instincts
[25:38] of man he said they did exactly what
[25:40] israel did
[25:42] so brother brahms identifying the heir
[25:44] of israel he's identifying it in the
[25:46] church
[25:46] how they could have relied upon god for
[25:48] everything but instead they say
[25:50] how can we protect this truth how can we
[25:51] set up government how can we see that
[25:53] this thing keeps going
[25:54] how can we protect our borders and
[25:56] protect our people and protect our sheep
[25:58] and
[25:58] make sure that this keeps going and so
[26:00] the organized human government
[26:02] and church order and church location and
[26:07] church services
[26:08] in church offices in church structure
[26:11] and church services became all that the
[26:12] people needed to feel like everything's
[26:14] good
[26:16] now you could really think about this
[26:17] for a long time and realize this is a
[26:20] very very
[26:21] deep a statement of brother branham's to
[26:23] identify nicolaitanism
[26:26] and how broad it is sometimes we say oh
[26:28] that's just nicolaitanism because we're
[26:29] looking at maybe
[26:30] a pastor who abuses the sheep and but
[26:33] there's also an agreement on the
[26:35] people's part
[26:36] to lay aside their individual duty lay
[26:39] aside their discernment lay aside their
[26:41] need for something
[26:42] and have the church just satisfy all of
[26:44] it and kind of have a figurehead that
[26:45] governs all of it and then feel like
[26:47] hey everything's good we're having
[26:48] church aren't we
[26:51] it's organizing the human government to
[26:52] legislate for the people to make their
[26:54] decisions tell them what to do
[26:56] they did exactly what israel did what
[26:57] god warned it would happen when they
[26:59] took a king
[26:59] he says they took the expediency of
[27:01] human government
[27:03] why because there can be efficiencies
[27:05] there can be expediency there can be hey
[27:07] this works this seems well
[27:09] they took the expediency of human
[27:10] government instead of the word
[27:12] and the spirit
[27:15] it's not in what was uh it's it i think
[27:18] i need to be very careful how to say
[27:20] this
[27:21] it's not in the order it's not in the
[27:23] church it's not in the service where god
[27:25] was displaced
[27:26] it was in keeping the word and the
[27:27] spirit out of it
[27:29] it was in looking in just the fact that
[27:31] we could have these things the
[27:32] expediency of it they thought well if we
[27:34] could have order and we could have
[27:35] structured we could have government we
[27:36] could have
[27:37] authority they look to the expediency
[27:39] and the effectiveness of human
[27:40] government
[27:41] instead of allowing the word to have the
[27:43] preeminence and allow and that word
[27:45] having the pyramids
[27:46] is what gives the spirit preeminence
[27:50] this is god's demand that you be
[27:53] absolutely dependent upon him this is
[27:56] god's demand of our church
[27:58] that we be absolutely dependent upon him
[28:02] and we should never take the expediency
[28:04] of human government
[28:06] as a substitute for the word and the
[28:07] spirit
[28:10] this is what israel did
[28:13] they were no longer depending upon
[28:17] god to fulfill his word from start to
[28:19] finish
[28:21] this is what we can say that jesus was
[28:22] identifying this is what deuteronomy 8
[28:24] is identifying this is what psalms 100
[28:26] identifies
[28:27] is that we as sheep must live by the
[28:29] word that comes from his mouth
[28:31] so in isaiah 55 is identifying this
[28:34] bread that's going to come out of heaven
[28:35] has a purpose as an intent
[28:37] and we must feed on it in order to be
[28:38] successful to be happy
[28:41] in amos chapter 8 verses 11 and 12
[28:45] said behold the days come saith the lord
[28:48] that i will send a famine in the land
[28:52] not a famine of bread nor a thirst for
[28:56] water
[28:58] this is what god says
[29:01] you know you that are thirsty for water
[29:03] come to the waters you that
[29:04] uh wants milk come and get and who that
[29:07] they don't have bread you come
[29:08] he's saying to come he said i'm gonna
[29:10] send to famine but not for bread
[29:12] and not for water but of hearing the
[29:14] words of the lord
[29:17] there's going to be a time where
[29:18] there'll be a famine and god will send
[29:20] the famine
[29:22] why does he send it because they love
[29:23] not the truth so actually since the
[29:26] famine when it was a time when they
[29:27] could have heard it they could have
[29:28] enjoyed it it was readily available and
[29:29] it seems as if it had this liberty and
[29:31] this freedom
[29:31] and it was being lifted up and they
[29:33] could partake of it whenever they wanted
[29:34] there's going to come circumstances
[29:36] there's going to come
[29:37] a dynamic in place to where there's
[29:39] going to be a famine for hearing the
[29:41] pure word of god
[29:43] just as they turned away from following
[29:44] in the first age at the end of time
[29:46] there's going to be a famine for the
[29:48] pure word of god where he says they
[29:49] shall wander from sea to sea and from
[29:51] north to even to the east
[29:52] and they shall run to a throat to seek
[29:54] the word of the lord and
[29:55] shall not find it that's how precious
[29:57] it's going to be
[30:01] i i like to look at it this way
[30:04] this is this is how it's been striking
[30:06] me
[30:08] that there's going to be those and again
[30:10] maybe this is my emphasis
[30:12] now and i'm just speaking this is how it
[30:14] strikes me
[30:15] there's going to be those that recognize
[30:18] that the word isn't being preached
[30:21] there's going to be those that recognize
[30:22] just how important it is for the word to
[30:24] be preached
[30:25] and they're going to be hungry for it
[30:27] and they're going to be looking for it
[30:29] and they're going to find that it's a
[30:30] precious resource and it's very scarce
[30:32] but there will be those that will value
[30:34] the word over
[30:36] other things over politics over
[30:39] personality over pretense over
[30:41] over amenities and programs and have you
[30:43] seen their sunday school get up my
[30:45] goodness it's awesome
[30:46] let's all go there they're going to
[30:49] value the word
[30:50] greater than things that it can do on
[30:51] these fringes and these extracurriculars
[30:54] he says they shall run to and fro to
[30:55] seek the word and shall not find it
[30:57] it speaks that there are going to be
[30:58] those looking for it but now brother
[31:00] branham emphasizes
[31:01] that this is a last day scripture
[31:04] there's going to be a famine not for
[31:06] bread
[31:06] not for water famine is a shortage or
[31:09] it's a lacking of that which is
[31:11] necessary to live
[31:13] the use of the word famine is used to
[31:15] indicate an appetite something that's a
[31:16] very strong feeling
[31:18] something that needs fulfilling but yet
[31:19] it's not met it's something that's
[31:21] unfulfilled
[31:23] and catch this as we've identified in
[31:25] john chapter six i want you to make this
[31:27] connection now
[31:28] that the famine is not a shortage of
[31:30] bread
[31:32] the famine is not a shortage of water
[31:35] and how did jesus place
[31:37] this miracle that he did he performed a
[31:39] miracle was it supernatural absolutely
[31:41] did they want to see it again yes but
[31:43] why
[31:43] because of what it did for their bodies
[31:46] and so the shortage is not of bread the
[31:48] shortage is not a water
[31:49] it it it's even showing that there can
[31:52] be
[31:52] certain things that we can enjoy and
[31:54] benefit from
[31:55] and and the shortage is going to be
[31:58] something
[32:00] that doesn't pertain to a blessing on
[32:02] the flesh
[32:03] but feeds the soul
[32:06] it's not a shortage of the spirit being
[32:08] poured out because does the bible not
[32:09] say that in the last days i'll pour my
[32:11] spirit upon all flesh
[32:13] it says it that's what the bible says is
[32:15] going to happen it says but there's
[32:16] going to come there's going to i'm going
[32:18] to send to famine
[32:19] it's not going to be a famine of bread
[32:20] or the thirst of water why because
[32:22] there's going to be people that will
[32:23] enjoy
[32:24] things that do something for their
[32:25] spirits their emotions and their flesh
[32:28] but the real scarce resource is what
[32:30] feeds the soul
[32:33] are you are you are you thinking
[32:35] thinking about this
[32:37] and just how direct this is it's not a
[32:39] famine of bread nor the thirst of water
[32:41] but that doesn't mean there's not
[32:43] something
[32:44] sensitizing someone's flesh and their
[32:46] mind in religious service and making
[32:48] them feel
[32:49] satisfied
[32:52] because there's no famine of fanaticism
[32:56] there's no famine of personality cults
[32:58] there's no famine
[33:00] of of church gatherings there's no
[33:03] lacking of emotion there's no lacking of
[33:05] certain things
[33:10] but it's a famine of hearing the word
[33:13] and when you don't hear the word that
[33:14] creates a crisis of faith
[33:17] has anyone ever been there before now
[33:20] we're not blaming anyone
[33:22] but let's take responsibility ourselves
[33:24] we found ourselves in a crisis
[33:28] and we found out the reason why we're
[33:31] there is we're malnourished
[33:34] because faith cometh by hearing the word
[33:37] if we could just
[33:38] just summarize that very succinctly i
[33:40] cannot have a robust faith i cannot have
[33:42] an
[33:42] act of faith i cannot have a a a faith
[33:45] that brother man even calls unconscious
[33:46] in other words it's instinctive it's
[33:47] operating in the background
[33:49] it's there working when you don't know
[33:50] it
[33:52] i cannot have that kind of faith if i
[33:54] have not been feeding my soul with the
[33:56] word
[33:57] and we find ourselves in a crisis of
[33:59] doubt and raw emotion and
[34:01] and just kind of floundering a little
[34:03] bit and we were in that state because
[34:05] our faith
[34:06] has not been hearing the word to be very
[34:09] vital in that moment and powerful in
[34:11] that time
[34:13] so a famine of hearing the word creates
[34:15] a crisis of faith
[34:16] and this impacts our spiritual health
[34:19] so when the bible says there's going to
[34:21] be a famine for hearing the word of god
[34:23] you cannot remain as you are and not
[34:25] hear the word
[34:27] you're going to get worse off and if
[34:29] you're going to get worse often a lot of
[34:31] times it has to be there has to become
[34:33] there's more more dog and pony shows and
[34:35] smoke and mirrors to make
[34:37] everything look fine we have to do a lot
[34:40] of put on a lot of pretending
[34:42] and a lot of lying to ourselves and
[34:44] others to make everything look right
[34:46] when in reality
[34:47] there's a famine for hearing the word
[34:49] and things aren't right
[34:54] brother branham says in the message
[34:55] jezebel religion
[34:57] if you want a kind of a soft sermon to
[34:59] go to bed listening to
[35:00] you can listen to jezebel religion
[35:04] and brother brahms identifying how that
[35:06] they rejected elijah the prophet and
[35:08] after they had rejected him he says what
[35:10] set in
[35:11] war famine starvation you reject the
[35:14] word of god you're gonna set yourself up
[35:15] for fighting
[35:17] for starvation for famine thus saith the
[35:19] holy spirit this is brother branham now
[35:21] watch what's coming watch what's going
[35:22] to follow
[35:23] there was a famine there will be a
[35:25] famine oh maybe not for bread but for
[35:27] hearing the word of god and his truth
[35:32] there'll still be bread there'll still
[35:33] be water there'll still be certain
[35:35] things
[35:36] people continue on having church
[35:39] and doing things that gave them the
[35:41] indication that they were saved
[35:45] and they'll even be one that comes and
[35:47] performs signs and wonders
[35:49] even after the bride is taken out of the
[35:51] way and people will marvel at how great
[35:53] and wonderful it is and it's actually a
[35:54] manifestation of the antichrist
[35:59] and there'll be great commerce and
[36:00] they'll be great benefiting of certain
[36:01] different things
[36:02] but he's saying the real famine is
[36:04] hearing the word of god and his truth he
[36:05] says
[36:06] and the way his language here is so so
[36:09] moving all the churches will socialize
[36:14] and go right on into it just the same
[36:17] just like they've already been swallowed
[36:19] up with it
[36:22] the churches will socialize now i know
[36:26] that kind of gets our right wing gander
[36:28] up right socialism
[36:29] brother aaron it's creeping into the
[36:30] church
[36:33] it's it's not referring to socialism as
[36:36] far as an economic policy or a
[36:38] government
[36:40] but it's what church becomes
[36:43] churches will socialize and go right on
[36:46] into just the same
[36:49] it's it's the expediency of human
[36:51] government
[36:53] it's the posing of the word and the
[36:56] spirit
[36:56] and accepting a form and accepting
[36:58] culture and accepting order
[37:00] and accepting things other than letting
[37:02] the word have preeminence
[37:03] says there will be a famine oh maybe not
[37:05] for bread
[37:07] maybe not for charismatic services and a
[37:09] dynamic pouring out of the spirit upon
[37:11] all flesh but for hearing the word of
[37:13] god and his truth
[37:14] churches will socialize and go right on
[37:16] in just the same they've been swallowed
[37:18] up with it
[37:20] i i say this i want to be careful how i
[37:23] say it
[37:24] i'd like to say the biggest danger but
[37:27] let me say
[37:28] that where we need the greatest care and
[37:30] the thing that we ought not to be most
[37:32] concerned with
[37:32] is not the opposition to the truth or
[37:35] opposition against the message
[37:36] but the distraction from it
[37:40] that's where we're going to be the most
[37:42] vulnerable
[37:44] it's not so much the things that oppose
[37:46] the message and try to tear it down and
[37:48] and try to argue against it and try to
[37:49] point out
[37:50] its faults and and those things because
[37:52] really you've been bolstered by
[37:53] revelation
[37:55] uh though those things don't move you
[37:57] because you've been reading a bible that
[37:58] takes a revelation to understand and
[38:00] there's certain things in history and
[38:02] certain things and
[38:02] and grammar and certain things that
[38:04] could be pointed out in the bible and
[38:05] that doesn't stumble us because we've
[38:07] been restored back to a confidence in
[38:08] the word of god
[38:09] and so it's not the opposition to the
[38:12] truth that's going to trip us up usually
[38:14] it's the distraction from it
[38:17] when we get distracted from the truth
[38:21] you are attracted to the word and
[38:24] distracted by the world
[38:27] so if the world seems to kind of get its
[38:29] hooks in you
[38:30] and it's taking some of your time don't
[38:32] ever think that you're attracted to it
[38:34] and that's what you really like and
[38:35] you're being drawn to it no you're just
[38:36] being distracted by it
[38:37] you're attracted as the attraction as
[38:39] the elect of god is the word of god
[38:42] anything outside of that pulls you away
[38:44] is a distraction not an attraction
[38:48] and so this this hearing the word of god
[38:51] there's things things that want to keep
[38:53] us from it and gabriel's instructions to
[38:55] daniel he says i understand that in the
[38:57] last days they'll come a famine here's
[38:58] brother branham placing this
[39:00] the churches will be so organized and so
[39:02] set
[39:04] he says the churches will socialize and
[39:06] go right on into it now he says the
[39:08] churches will be so organized and so set
[39:11] it doesn't say denominations he says
[39:12] churches
[39:15] that in the last days they'll come a
[39:16] famine and it will not be for bread and
[39:18] water only but for hearing the true word
[39:20] of god
[39:21] you mean a church can socialize and be
[39:23] so organized and so
[39:24] set that the word can stop being
[39:26] preached and it can continue straight on
[39:29] yep a famine for hearing the word of god
[39:33] and people go from east and from west
[39:35] from north and the south seeking to hear
[39:37] the true word of god what is it this is
[39:38] a desire to hear it where can it be
[39:40] preached
[39:40] but the churches will be so organized
[39:42] and tightened up that they'll fail to
[39:44] hear it
[39:46] a desire to hear want to hear the word
[39:48] where's the word being preached where's
[39:49] the word lifted up but churches will be
[39:51] so organized and tightened up
[39:54] that people won't be allowed to hear it
[40:04] relax relax take a deep breath
[40:10] i won't be quoting from jezebel religion
[40:12] anymore tonight so you can just relax
[40:16] in the message spiritual food and due
[40:18] season let me check and make sure yeah i
[40:19] don't think i am
[40:20] if i do it's on accident how's that
[40:23] now notice how he places this in
[40:25] spiritual food and due season now we're
[40:26] going to type that with the spiritual
[40:28] drought of today
[40:30] now we all know we're very aware that
[40:32] there's a great spiritual drought in the
[40:34] in the land today spiritually speaking
[40:38] now you could have a very vibrant
[40:40] pentecostal move taking place at the
[40:42] time
[40:43] you could have ministries that are
[40:45] grabbing the people's attention and
[40:47] and things are taking place but this is
[40:48] the prophet who's diagnosing the real
[40:50] need
[40:51] and he recognizes the famine and it's a
[40:53] famine spiritually speaking
[40:55] and you know that was predicted by the
[40:57] prophet so now he's identifying amos
[40:59] chapter 8 just before the second coming
[41:00] of christ would be said
[41:02] there'll come a famine in the land and
[41:04] it won't be for bread alone but for
[41:05] hearing of the word of god
[41:07] and that day is now
[41:10] brother brahma identifies amos 8 1 11
[41:13] and 12. he identifies it
[41:14] now he says and that day is now hearing
[41:17] the true word of god
[41:19] so what is the famine of it's not of
[41:21] church services it's not a
[41:22] it's not a song services and in prayer
[41:24] lines and the moving of the word of
[41:26] movement of the spirit of god and those
[41:28] different things it's not a famine for
[41:30] church it's not a famine for community
[41:31] it's not a famine for fellowship it's
[41:33] not a famine
[41:34] for government and those things but it's
[41:36] a famine for hearing the true word of
[41:38] god
[41:39] he said now this types the natural
[41:41] drought with the spiritual
[41:43] sin and unbelief by false teachers in
[41:46] modernness
[41:47] in the church that's a mouthful
[41:51] had brought the to the place to this
[41:53] coming oncoming judgment so false
[41:55] teaching and modernists in the church
[41:57] had brought them to a place of oncoming
[41:58] judgment
[42:00] then they had turned from god's word and
[42:02] his prophet
[42:04] so as he's using this example in the
[42:05] days of elijah and then
[42:08] he says they had turned from god's word
[42:09] and his prophet to a modern theological
[42:12] terms of the word
[42:13] you'll notice here it's just at that
[42:15] time that god always raises up something
[42:19] i love that part it's just at that time
[42:24] god always raises up something so
[42:28] the two sides of the ditch
[42:31] there can be a a misinterpreting of the
[42:35] word only
[42:37] to it becomes no more than modern
[42:39] theological terms
[42:42] and then there could be a
[42:43] misinterpretation of the other end
[42:45] where it becomes nothing more than just
[42:46] human inspiration and human enthusiasm
[42:51] so how is the only way you're going to
[42:53] know you're right
[42:54] is if it's in the word
[42:58] and he's saying that this time is now a
[43:00] famine
[43:01] for hearing the words of the lord
[43:05] and that they had turned from god's word
[43:09] to the teach false teachings and
[43:11] modernist the churches socializing and
[43:13] churches organized and tightened up
[43:15] and so set up they turned from the word
[43:17] and so they were no longer letting the
[43:19] word have preeminence
[43:20] and it made them uh the subjects of the
[43:23] oncoming judgment
[43:26] now i want to just kind of open up this
[43:28] path
[43:29] but then it says it's just about that
[43:31] time that god always raises up something
[43:34] when people get hungry for the word and
[43:36] they can't find it it's about that time
[43:38] that god raises up something
[43:40] now it's very clear what brother
[43:42] branham's identifying is malachi chapter
[43:44] 4
[43:45] and even the opening of the word that in
[43:47] the chaos of what pentecost had become
[43:49] and the chaos that laodicea was in
[43:51] and there was a famine for hearing the
[43:53] word god raised up something
[43:55] which was the greatest seven course meal
[43:56] that we could feed on
[43:59] so god raises up something to satisfy
[44:01] those who are seeking the word of god
[44:05] now with that i want just to stay leave
[44:08] that thought there and
[44:09] bring out a couple things in closing
[44:13] brother branham writes this in chapter 4
[44:15] of the church age book
[44:17] the two vines within the framework of
[44:19] the church were drifting further apart
[44:22] with an increased bitterness towards the
[44:24] truvine on the part of the falls
[44:29] there's enough bitterness in the false
[44:30] vines so we don't have to be
[44:33] let the false find be bitter let it go
[44:36] lay it aside give it time go forward
[44:42] death was not only the seed of the false
[44:44] vine
[44:45] but even in the true vine
[44:48] now where did this start from turning
[44:51] away
[44:51] from god's demand right
[44:55] turn it turning away from god's demanded
[44:57] of a church absolutely dependent upon
[44:59] him
[45:00] leaving their first love so this is how
[45:03] he brings this
[45:04] out in such profound language
[45:08] death was not only the seat of the fall
[45:09] sign but even in the true vine there was
[45:11] a
[45:12] creeping paralysis so there's a disease
[45:15] now in the true vine this is something
[45:17] that's gradual
[45:18] a creeping process spreading in to where
[45:21] there's muscular function loss and it
[45:23] keeps getting a loss of vigor
[45:24] loss of movement a creeping paralysis
[45:27] and these are his words
[45:28] and impotence a lack of self-restraint a
[45:32] lack of control a lack of physical
[45:34] strength
[45:34] something powerless now there has been a
[45:38] creep in paralysis and
[45:39] impotence because they had already
[45:42] drifted from the unadulterated truth
[45:45] of the first few years after pentecost
[45:47] having drifted away from the pure word
[45:49] of god having turned away from the pure
[45:51] word having turned away from the
[45:52] unadulterated truth
[45:54] that allowed weakness it's a crisis of
[45:57] faith
[45:58] no longer feeding on the true
[46:00] unadulterated true word of god no longer
[46:01] depending upon him
[46:04] turning to churches being socialized in
[46:06] organizations and being tightened up and
[46:07] set up
[46:08] and turning away from god's demand of a
[46:10] church being absolutely dependent upon
[46:12] him
[46:12] depending entirely upon him to fulfill
[46:14] his word from start to finish
[46:15] turning to organized human government to
[46:18] legislate for the people
[46:19] and the expediency of human government
[46:21] instead of the word and spirit
[46:23] what did it cause a creeping paralysis
[46:26] and impotence
[46:28] drifting away from the unadulterated
[46:30] truth and here's a phrase that i like to
[46:32] quote very often and make reference to
[46:34] it even if i'm not
[46:35] reading directly out of the church age
[46:37] book and we should all
[46:39] know this by heart no true believer
[46:42] is any stronger and spiritually healthy
[46:45] and alive than his knowledge of and
[46:48] adherence to
[46:50] the pure word of god you can't even
[46:53] qualify this
[46:55] it's set in such a way to where in
[46:57] context out of context
[46:59] is true however you want to move it
[47:00] around it remains the truth
[47:03] no true believer is any stronger
[47:06] and spiritually healthy and alive you
[47:08] cannot be more strong you cannot be more
[47:11] healthy
[47:11] you cannot be more alive than your
[47:14] knowledge of the pure word of god and
[47:15] your obedience to the pure word of god
[47:18] so what makes you alive knowledge of the
[47:21] word
[47:22] obedience to the word what makes you
[47:24] spiritually healthy
[47:25] knowledge of the word obedience to the
[47:27] word what makes you
[47:28] strong knowledge of the word obedience
[47:30] to the word what's going to make you
[47:32] more alive
[47:33] more healthy and more strong more
[47:35] knowledge of the word
[47:36] more obedience to the word this is what
[47:39] your spiritual health is based upon this
[47:41] is exactly
[47:42] what jesus refers to he says man shall
[47:44] not live by bread alone
[47:45] this is exactly what god said the signs
[47:47] and wonders and the miracles were
[47:49] supposed to provoke
[47:50] within the heart of the israelites was
[47:51] the fact that his word was
[47:53] sufficient they would recognize that yes
[47:57] bread is good and god can provide it but
[47:59] the god that provides that bread is
[48:01] providing something greater
[48:02] for a greater need you cannot be any
[48:06] stronger
[48:06] any more healthy any more alive than
[48:08] what you know of the word and what
[48:10] you're obeying
[48:11] in the word and he says as seen by
[48:15] multitudes of examples in the old
[48:16] testament
[48:18] what's happening within the framework of
[48:20] the church organization was growing a
[48:21] pace confirming and
[48:22] augmenting the death of membership
[48:27] it's when you read statements like that
[48:28] that you realize brother level was
[48:30] helping him write
[48:32] organization was growing a pace
[48:34] confirming and augmenting the death
[48:36] of membership for holy ghost leadership
[48:40] was deposed
[48:41] and the word was replaced by creeds
[48:45] dogmas and man-made ritual
[48:49] it doesn't say replaced by cat
[48:50] sacrifices
[48:52] right and elicit drug use
[48:56] it's said in such a way to where holy
[48:58] ghost leadership can be cast aside and
[49:00] the word be replaced
[49:01] by creeds dogmas and man-made rituals
[49:04] it's very easy to leave out the leading
[49:07] of the holy spirit
[49:08] it's very easy to turn yourselves over
[49:10] to traditions and not let the word have
[49:14] preeminence
[49:16] what does this what does this mean
[49:21] you ask i i share
[49:24] these statements with you
[49:27] i i've traveled down this line of
[49:29] thought
[49:33] to get you to ponder how precious the
[49:36] word is
[49:39] and we say when we say i'm hungry what
[49:41] are you hungry for
[49:44] what is it we need the most in this time
[49:45] that we're living in
[49:49] we need the word more than ever
[49:53] before we need the pure word of god
[50:00] in isaiah chapter 55 this was our text
[50:03] i'll just read
[50:04] we'll read three verses i have on the
[50:06] slide here
[50:08] ho everyone that thirsteth come ye to
[50:11] the
[50:12] waters and he that hath no money
[50:18] come you buy and eat well you ask those
[50:21] who don't have money to come
[50:23] but then you asked us to buy and eat
[50:27] ponder this yay come buy wine and milk
[50:30] without money
[50:31] and without price what is he what is he
[50:35] speaking to
[50:37] what kind of milk would it be what kind
[50:38] of wine would it be what kind of thirst
[50:40] is he talking about
[50:41] is he talking about someone right now i
[50:43] find myself right now in this season
[50:45] where my allergies seem a little bad and
[50:47] my throat's always a little bit hoarse
[50:48] and
[50:48] i'm really thirsty living in this arid
[50:50] climate and i'm really thirsty so i'm
[50:53] using that as an excuse
[50:54] and i preface it just well to be able to
[50:55] take a drink of water
[51:01] he's not talking about a natural thirst
[51:05] when a man is thirsty for that he'll
[51:07] find what satisfies
[51:10] when a man's hungry you think of the
[51:11] prodigal son when he was hungry he was
[51:12] willing to fight with pigs for corn husk
[51:14] in the slop when a man's that hungry and
[51:17] a man's that thirsty he'll search for it
[51:19] but god is identifying a soul thirst
[51:21] that only he could satisfy
[51:24] you that are thirsty blessed he who
[51:26] hungers and thirsts ye that are thirsty
[51:27] come to the waters
[51:29] come and buy wine and milk without money
[51:31] and without price
[51:35] why do you spend money
[51:38] wherefore do you spend money for that
[51:40] which is not bread
[51:42] now take this in a spiritual sense that
[51:44] will come
[51:45] in the last days of famine
[51:48] not of bread nor of water but of hearing
[51:52] the word
[51:53] he says why do you exert yourself pine
[51:56] for
[51:57] support run after buy
[52:02] things that don't really satisfy what
[52:04] you need
[52:07] for that which is not really satisfying
[52:10] why do you labor for that which
[52:11] satisfyeth not
[52:13] hearken diligently unto me and eat ye
[52:16] that which is good now how are you gonna
[52:20] how are you gonna eat that which is good
[52:21] by listening to his voice
[52:23] did you catch that come drink come eat
[52:27] how harken diligently under me and eat
[52:29] that which is good and let your soul
[52:31] delight itself
[52:32] in fatness not your taste buds not your
[52:34] stomach not this digestive process
[52:36] but your soul delight itself in factness
[52:40] and this verse oh i just love it incline
[52:42] your ear and come to me
[52:44] listen to what i have to say come unto
[52:46] me hear
[52:48] and your soul shall live
[52:51] but he says come to the waters come by
[52:53] wine and come by milk well
[52:54] who is he calling himself who is he
[52:56] calling you to incline your ear and come
[52:58] to me and your soul
[52:59] shall live no matter how well you take
[53:02] care of this body it's going to die one
[53:04] day if the
[53:05] if the lord delays the meeting in the
[53:06] air
[53:08] the longer this terror is the longer
[53:09] this waits the the more likely we're all
[53:12] going to head to the grave no matter how
[53:13] well you take care of this body
[53:15] it has death already sewn into it as a
[53:18] natural process so he says
[53:20] listen to me come unto me hear and as
[53:23] you hear the word of god your soul shall
[53:26] live
[53:28] brother said all life comes by the
[53:30] spoken word of god
[53:33] be no more stronger spiritual healthy or
[53:35] alive
[53:37] than how well you're hearing the word
[53:39] and feeding on the word
[53:42] think about this we won't get into it
[53:44] but if you're ever going to speak it you
[53:45] have to first eat it
[53:50] if you want to be speaking the word you
[53:52] want to be living the word
[53:54] even if that was the only way that we
[53:56] drew the picture of the third pool which
[53:58] it's often kind of
[53:59] built around this idea that we're all
[54:00] gonna uh just kind of be standing in
[54:02] this perfect choir alignment and speak
[54:04] things into existence
[54:06] if that is in fact what it's going to be
[54:10] is where we're all speaking the word and
[54:12] things are materializing
[54:13] you'll never be able to speak it if
[54:14] you're not eating it
[54:18] and we should be more concerned with
[54:19] eating it right now
[54:21] than speaking something we don't have
[54:27] all life comes by the spoken word of god
[54:31] brother brown preaches the rapture
[54:32] message he says what is the shout then
[54:34] it's the message going forth the living
[54:38] bread of life
[54:39] bringing forth the bride
[54:42] just at the time that there's a famine
[54:46] he always does something
[54:50] john chapter 6 verse 27 labor not for
[54:53] the meat which perisheth
[54:55] but for the meat which endureth unto
[54:57] everlasting life
[54:59] what meat is that which the son of man
[55:02] shall give unto you
[55:04] the meat that tends to endure us that
[55:06] promotes that grants
[55:08] a greater strength a greater spiritual
[55:10] health a great a greater spiritual
[55:12] spiritual vitality and alive is the meat
[55:14] that the son of man gives you
[55:16] for him hath god the father sealed
[55:23] why do we labor for that which satisfies
[55:25] not why do we spend money for that which
[55:26] is not bread
[55:28] come unto me hearken unto me listen to
[55:30] my word incline your ear come
[55:32] eat and your soul shall live eat and
[55:34] your soul shall delight itself in
[55:35] fatness
[55:36] the meat which endureth unto everlasting
[55:38] life is the meat of the son of man
[55:41] feed on that don't be ashamed of it
[55:45] feed on it hear it
[55:49] read it listen to it
[55:56] john chapter 6 they had the loaves
[56:00] and the fishes and they were happy
[56:05] and they felt the sense that they could
[56:07] continue in that
[56:09] the rest of their lives and be satisfied
[56:13] and had an opportunity been given to
[56:15] them to be able to do that
[56:17] i think they would have accepted it and
[56:20] they would have been content
[56:22] to live having food three square meals a
[56:25] day however you want to describe it they
[56:27] would have been happy
[56:28] and they would have been bragging about
[56:30] it and they would have been talking
[56:31] about it but they would have missed the
[56:32] whole point of it
[56:35] three meals a day didn't have to work
[56:37] anymore
[56:39] could use or they could use this extra
[56:41] money that they had now
[56:42] by not having to spend it on food for
[56:44] other things and their lives would
[56:45] forever change and it just seemed as if
[56:47] they had entered into some sort of
[56:49] nirvana where food is always provided
[56:51] for and it's always
[56:52] just readily available they would have
[56:54] accepted that
[56:59] and why
[57:07] because they would have settled for
[57:08] something less
[57:12] they would have accepted something far
[57:14] less valuable
[57:19] because their thinking had warped their
[57:23] perception of the value
[57:25] of the word that was standing before him
[57:29] here was christ the word now i know we
[57:32] we don't really i think your heart you i
[57:35] know your hearts are sincere even i i
[57:37] understand that as i'm preaching tonight
[57:38] some of you may be personally saying
[57:40] is do i really have that problem i
[57:41] thought i really loved the word no you
[57:42] love the word
[57:44] they do have this say that if you go to
[57:46] church on sunday morning you love church
[57:47] if you go sunday night
[57:49] uh you love your pastor and if you go
[57:50] wednesday night you love the word
[57:52] so welcome word lovers
[57:57] and uh that's why we don't have a sunday
[57:58] night because no one loves the pastor
[57:59] how's that
[58:03] and so for us it's hard for us maybe to
[58:05] put ourselves in that mindset but
[58:08] here was christ the word in their midst
[58:10] their messiah
[58:11] their mate and they only wanted him
[58:16] to make bread they only wanted him to do
[58:20] a miracle to perform
[58:22] a sign to do something in this arena in
[58:24] this realm
[58:25] and they were not sufficiently impressed
[58:27] with the word that was in their midst
[58:30] that would do something that could
[58:31] transcend somebody could work hard and
[58:33] buy bread someone could fish hard and
[58:35] get fish
[58:36] but here stood one that could do more
[58:38] than that
[58:40] yes it seemed to come at ease from his
[58:42] hands and multiplying bread and fish yes
[58:45] this is a dynamic miracle
[58:46] but should that not get your attention
[58:48] that this word
[58:50] that is coming forth from this man is
[58:52] greater than fish
[58:53] greater than bread because it speaks to
[58:55] a need that's greater in my heart
[58:58] should not these miracles and signs and
[59:00] wonders
[59:01] make us more sensitive to the presence
[59:04] of god that is here
[59:05] and be sufficiently impressed with the
[59:07] word that has been brought to us as
[59:08] believers
[59:11] not in conduct order and doctrine that
[59:12] has allowed us to structure our churches
[59:14] in a way that god will bless it
[59:16] not in that we're able to arrange things
[59:18] in in a way that satisfies
[59:20] the desires of god and is pleasing to
[59:22] the lord in terms of order and structure
[59:24] into governments and arrangements and
[59:25] offices and duties no but the word that
[59:28] has been brought to us
[59:31] none of the order it's it's not worth it
[59:35] coming here
[59:37] setting up and tearing down if the
[59:39] word's not preached
[59:45] so it's the value it's the change in
[59:47] value
[59:52] they recognize impressed were they
[59:54] impressed yes they were impressed
[59:56] but not sufficiently not enough to get
[59:59] past the body
[1:00:00] and how hungry it was
[1:00:04] are you hungry enough for god to where
[1:00:08] your sickness doesn't matter what
[1:00:11] matters is the contentment in your soul
[1:00:14] are you hungry enough for god to where
[1:00:15] he said though you slay me yet i'll
[1:00:17] serve you
[1:00:18] are you hungry enough for god to say
[1:00:19] lord did this headache this this stomach
[1:00:22] problem
[1:00:22] the pain i have in my ankles lord this
[1:00:24] situation that situation
[1:00:26] it matters it doesn't matter as much as
[1:00:28] your word matters to me
[1:00:30] are you hungry enough that if your soul
[1:00:32] is being fed you don't despair of life
[1:00:34] if your soul is being fed you don't
[1:00:36] doubt
[1:00:36] if your soul is being fed you say lord
[1:00:38] you give and you take away blessed be
[1:00:40] the name of the lord
[1:00:41] your word is greater your word is richer
[1:00:44] you say yes i'm hungry well you're sick
[1:00:47] but i'm hungry for the word of god
[1:00:49] well you're cast out you're this you're
[1:00:50] that but my hunger for the word of god
[1:00:53] is being satisfied and that brings my
[1:00:55] contentment
[1:00:59] it says and have i not seen sent thee
[1:01:02] brother branham says this and to see
[1:01:05] right now in this evil day look at this
[1:01:07] statement
[1:01:07] ponder this
[1:01:11] and to see right now in this evil day
[1:01:13] that we live in
[1:01:15] when unbelievers and scientists and so
[1:01:17] forth
[1:01:19] are trying to cut away the very value of
[1:01:22] the word
[1:01:26] you could just imagine it
[1:01:30] you've got the
[1:01:33] burger of the word right
[1:01:36] and you're getting ready to eat someone
[1:01:39] start telling you
[1:01:40] well do you know if there's any hormones
[1:01:42] in that is that bun gluten free
[1:01:44] was it frozen is that organic mustard
[1:01:47] do you know if they wash the lettuce how
[1:01:50] do you know those tomatoes are going to
[1:01:51] give you cans a canker sores on your
[1:01:52] lips because they're your tongue because
[1:01:53] they're too acidic
[1:01:55] you're like are you serious
[1:01:59] you know it's going to give you cancer
[1:02:00] don't you what
[1:02:03] and they just they think that you you're
[1:02:05] getting ready to take a bite out of this
[1:02:06] thing
[1:02:08] and you want to eat it and someone's
[1:02:10] able to talk you out of it
[1:02:12] now just as we've all imagined this real
[1:02:14] juicy burger
[1:02:15] what time does in and out close
[1:02:19] that's what science has tried to do to
[1:02:21] the word of god
[1:02:23] this is what the unbelievers and so
[1:02:25] forth you've got your soul forth your
[1:02:26] scientists and your unbelievers what are
[1:02:28] they trying to
[1:02:28] cut away the very value of the word
[1:02:33] to cause it to pale into comparison to
[1:02:35] what other things have
[1:02:36] we have our metrics we have our
[1:02:38] paradigms we have our value systems we
[1:02:39] have the way
[1:02:40] the way we've set things and bring
[1:02:42] things and the world is actually trying
[1:02:43] to cause us to think that the word
[1:02:46] is less than what's being offered
[1:02:50] if you could just grab a hold of this
[1:02:52] it's the word or nothing
[1:02:55] and the lord i'd rather have nothing and
[1:02:57] the word
[1:02:59] if i've got the word then i doesn't
[1:03:00] matter if i have nothing else i've got
[1:03:02] the word the word that can
[1:03:04] provide everything else
[1:03:08] and the world just warps our minds to
[1:03:10] think that it has to be a particular way
[1:03:11] it has to have a particular setting has
[1:03:13] to have this it has to have that
[1:03:14] what matters the word matters
[1:03:18] take this whole world but give me jesus
[1:03:20] you could take its money you could take
[1:03:22] its fame you could take its
[1:03:23] opportunities you could take its
[1:03:24] privileges
[1:03:25] you could take its rights it's prestige
[1:03:27] take everything but give me the word
[1:03:29] having the word i'll be content
[1:03:33] and the word is more valuable
[1:03:38] than anything else but unbelievers and
[1:03:41] scientists are trying to
[1:03:42] and so forth are trying to cut away the
[1:03:46] very
[1:03:47] value of the word
[1:03:50] don't let them do it take the bite and
[1:03:53] enjoy it
[1:03:56] do it here you are
[1:03:59] with the book you're getting ready to
[1:04:00] eat it right because that's what we do
[1:04:03] we take the book and eat it and people
[1:04:06] start telling you
[1:04:07] well you sure about that huh you sure
[1:04:09] you want to do that
[1:04:11] and we're over here yeah i
[1:04:14] am take it
[1:04:17] eat it up it's your right
[1:04:20] god bless you let's stand tonight
[1:04:25] these are just things that are a prelude
[1:04:28] to what's been in my heart
[1:04:41] can you say i'm hungry
[1:04:44] lord in my heart i'm hungry for the word
[1:04:47] it's what i want lord it's what i need
[1:04:52] let's bow our heads i'd like to pray
[1:04:54] with you
[1:04:56] i know there's different needs that we
[1:04:57] have in our lives and different needs
[1:04:59] that we may have in our families
[1:05:03] [Music]
[1:05:07] just take him at his word take him for
[1:05:10] all that you need
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:13] lord
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:20] let's pray together heavenly father
[1:05:22] [Music]
[1:05:24] the sweet presence that's amongst us
[1:05:26] tonight lord and we know that's you
[1:05:32] you have not graced us with your
[1:05:34] presence
[1:05:36] to only be felt and known
[1:05:41] but you came and spoke to our hearts
[1:05:45] and now lord in your presence
[1:05:48] we take you for all that we need
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:05:52] but i know that the structuring of the
[1:05:55] word together in
[1:05:57] subject and verb and the arrangement
[1:06:00] that can be
[1:06:01] diagrammed is give me the word
[1:06:05] word only take this whole world but give
[1:06:08] me jesus lord it's
[1:06:10] words that are easily uttered from our
[1:06:13] lips
[1:06:15] but we say it tonight with faith deep
[1:06:17] down in our souls
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:22] believing in its value and its worth
[1:06:27] that with this word
[1:06:31] in my faith in it
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:34] what is impossible with man is possible
[1:06:36] with you
[1:06:38] and that i can take my stand on your
[1:06:40] word
[1:06:41] trust your word believe your word hold
[1:06:43] to your word feed on your word
[1:06:46] and begin to derive what i have need
[1:06:51] lord i believe that i speak to believers
[1:06:53] today
[1:06:54] [Music]
[1:06:58] and that their crisis of faith
[1:07:02] is not the evidence of a lack of
[1:07:04] election
[1:07:07] their crisis of faith is not
[1:07:10] even evidence of doubt
[1:07:14] but their crisis of faith
[1:07:17] is symptomatic of a lack of hearing the
[1:07:19] word
[1:07:20] [Music]
[1:07:23] may we then as your daughter
[1:07:26] as your son
[1:07:31] take to us more frequently this word
[1:07:35] more often
[1:07:39] to listen to read to ponder
[1:07:45] may it even be lord that we have to
[1:07:47] change our view of church
[1:07:50] we're taught that church is for the
[1:07:52] preaching of the word
[1:07:55] we realize lord there's a lot more that
[1:07:56] goes into church as
[1:07:58] many other benefits that we derive from
[1:08:00] it many other responsibilities and
[1:08:02] functions
[1:08:04] related to it than just the act action
[1:08:07] of preaching the word
[1:08:10] but lord we were taught that to
[1:08:12] understand that if you took
[1:08:14] the preaching of the word out of it
[1:08:16] church just collapses
[1:08:18] the purpose of it falls away
[1:08:22] it's remarkable lord to read in the word
[1:08:24] to understand
[1:08:25] that the word had been taken out of the
[1:08:27] church but the church continued
[1:08:32] but yet for the believer he cannot
[1:08:36] you cannot take the believer take the
[1:08:39] word from the believer he continue
[1:08:41] he must have it he has to live by it he
[1:08:45] knows when he doesn't get it he longs
[1:08:47] for it he searched for it
[1:08:48] he hunts for it and i pray today may
[1:08:51] this sermon tonight be a reminder to
[1:08:53] those
[1:08:54] elect eagles that they must be gathered
[1:08:57] around the carcass of the word
[1:08:59] that's what they're drawn to that's what
[1:09:01] they move for that's what they hunt for
[1:09:03] that's what they long for
[1:09:05] is the word
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:09] that's beautiful for in this word we
[1:09:11] have everything we have need of
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:14] salvation healing comfort peace
[1:09:20] the laying on of hands the manifestation
[1:09:21] of gifts lord it's all
[1:09:23] in the word we do not need to stray to
[1:09:25] the expediency of human government and
[1:09:27] modern theological terms
[1:09:30] to produce some sort of impersonation
[1:09:33] the word will bring it
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:37] pray lord tonight that you would just
[1:09:39] comfort our hearts
[1:09:41] as i as the word may have been
[1:09:44] direct and firm and cutting in some ways
[1:09:48] may be received in grace lord that
[1:09:51] my takeaway tonight is i'm made to
[1:09:54] hunger for the word
[1:09:57] that my weakness my unsteadiness my
[1:09:59] frustration my
[1:10:00] shortness of temper and the the the lack
[1:10:03] of harmony within my home
[1:10:05] and the disjointed feeling i feel at
[1:10:07] work and maybe even the estrangement i
[1:10:09] feel from church folks
[1:10:11] is a lack of feeding on the word of
[1:10:15] may god do that together lord bless your
[1:10:18] people
[1:10:20] to close this service lord be with those
[1:10:23] hurting in the heart hurting body
[1:10:26] hurting in mind lord may they be
[1:10:27] comforted may they be healed
[1:10:29] bless our worship we pray in the name of
[1:10:32] the lord jesus christ
[1:10:36] amen
