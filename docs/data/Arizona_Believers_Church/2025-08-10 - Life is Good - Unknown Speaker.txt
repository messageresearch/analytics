TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Proverbs 8:es 32-36. Now therefore hearken unto me, oh ye children, for blessed are they that keep my ways. Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the post of my doors. For who so findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favor of the Lord. But he that sinnth against me wrongeth his own soul. All they that hate me love death. Again, that was Proverbs 8:es 32-36. I forgot to update my title slide there. So, you can be seated. I'm going to give the title today, Life is Good. And in giving it this title, it's kind of the opposite of what I'd originally been thinking about calling it that, you know, death is bad or something like that. Uh, but I figured there's been enough uh maybe emphasis on evil to where at least in the title we could just lighten it a little bit. And you'll see kind of the parallel in this to say life is good. And maybe we say that sometimes when things are going well, man, life is good when we're uh drinking Lacroy on the Colorado River looking at the beautiful mountains and we feel really good about life. We say life is good. But I mean it more than that. I'm meaning more to it than just maybe a moment where things are feeling feeling fine. And we've been looking at uh the art of music and using even the subject of music theory over the last few services on how that within a composition or piece of music there's the use of consonants which we've been uh we using as a type of good and also dissonance which we're using as a type of evil and how that God has even allowed those two to exist within his drum and what's unfolding in his great symphony. But we're not even saying about evil. part of the symphony, each one having its part and but yet it's something that God uses and this is God's way of even that tension and that relief of tension and those expectations and that it's just it's the way that God works. And so we've been looking at the subject of good and evil and also using uh the theme of music and exploring music in a lot of different ways. So that's where we're at today as we just ministered on good and evil Wednesday night. And in Ecclesiastes chapter 3, we looked at those first eight verses in that chapter and how that the writer Solomon the preacher he calls himself says that there's a time too. And in that we see these intervals, a time to be born, a time to die. And there's these different things that kind of go back and forth, plant and pluck. And there's those rhythms or cycles. And these are seasons or even changes in life. And those time too, it's not that we got to know what time it is so that we can do it. It just means occasions that there's times when we're laughing, there's times when we're c crying and there seems to be this cycle, these waves or circuits as it were where there's occasions of joy and we experience those and we enjoy those. But then there's also occasions of sadness. And when we look at that, we find that even where there's happiness and there's life and there's planting and there's rejoicing, that evil cannot be avoided in this life. It just seems like it runs its course. Just as the observer said, the preacher said in Ecclesiastes, I see that the earth ever remains and generation passes one to the next. But even then, the earth doesn't stay constant. Even the earth experiences these cycles and seasons of winter and summer and the sun coming up and coming down and the rivers running out into the ocean. So there's a lot there that happens even in the cycles of nature. We realize that there will always be good and evil. And so he concludes this in Ecclesiastes 12 13 to 14. Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Fear God and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man. I will admit that until I began to look at this more deeply recently that I used to think that that is our whole responsibility. It's our singular responsibility is to fear God and keep his commandments. But it actually maybe means more than that just from the standpoint of duty where we have this responsibility. But rather it just means this is the totality of everything. &gt;&gt; This is everything. Fear God and keep his commandments. Not that it's well this is what you're supposed to do and this is what you must do and this is what you have to do. But he looks at all he says this is all there is. This is the only thing that resolves the the vexations. This is the only thing that can even give any kind of meaning to vanity whatsoever is to fear God and keep his commandments. &gt;&gt; So he took into consideration the vanities, the cycles, the ups and downs, the good and evil and all those vexations. And he says there's only one soloulless trust in God. There's only one thing that's going to make sense to a man because he says he does this, he does that. He labors, he strives, he accumulates, he tries to use, and then in the end it doesn't work out. And what is left? He dies. He's not even remembered. You don't even know what comes after you. And there's this thought where he says, "You know what? The only thing I can say is trust in God. Fear God. It's not to be nervous about him, but it's a trust. It's a reverence. It's to be in awe of him who controls all things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in Psalms 37:27, fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. This is a totality of everything. He says, "Because God will judge everything, whether it be good or evil." So the psalmist says, "Depart from evil and do good and dwell forever more." So there's some sense of permanence and constants when we depart from evil and do good. We assue evil. We avoid it. We abhore it. We put evil at arms length. So there has to be some necessary recognition of evil. We don't want to be like those who call evil good and say, "Isn't everything wonderful? Isn't everything good?" But there is an evil. But then not just to depart from evil, but we must also do good. Now, on just another uh little added depth to the uh idea of good, I have to have to say that it's been a real uh wrestling and battling on this subject and getting ready for the service today and just trying to find the mind of the Lord and piece this all together uh in a way that I felt like met the burden that God was giving me. So, there's maybe a lot of things I just need your help in today. So, pray for me. But there's this idea of good and evil that I would say exist within our human realm &gt;&gt; and and then there's so there's that good and evil and I'm not and that's not even necessarily evil being the devil and good being God just a good and evil that's very human but then there's this other dimension kind of like this upward shift where we say there's a good that transcends all that &gt;&gt; and so as much as maybe we aren't getting into that I want you to see that particular aspect because you don't have to be Christian to experience times of being born, times of dying, times of joy, time of sadness. And so there's those cycles to life that exist within mankind. But then there's this other dimension, this third part where God says this other plan, he says, there's a good that is of God's alone. In Matthew 19 16-1 17, and behold, one came and said unto him, good master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life? So there is this desire to live forever more, to never die, to have that permanent place in the Messiah kingdom forever. What may I do to have eternal life? And Jesus answered in verse 17, why callst thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God. Now, this would be a concept or idea amongst the Jews where those that lived well and abided by the law and observed certain commandments, they were good. And the they the the teachers, the Pharisees, the scribes, those of certain orders, they they were good. So now it's good master. We want to identify you as someone who's devoted, someone who's a teacher. He says, "Don't call me good because there's none good but one that is God. But if thou will enter into life, keep the commandments." So there's that symmetry once again. and fear God and keep his commandments. So God is good. &gt;&gt; We say God is good. We don't mean it in the same way that we might say eating at Ritos and say this is good. This is some inherent characteristic of God that God is good. &gt;&gt; He's pleasant. He's agreeable. He's honorable. We can maybe use another word. God is goodness. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Deuteronomy 6:4, "Hero is of the Lord. Our God is one Lord." So God is one. We should recognize that there is one God. As they say, as it's repeated in the New Testament, there is one God and he is one. &gt;&gt; This is God who is singular. It's God that lives on this one. He is Lord. That's Yahweh, the self-existing one. There's only one. And so God is good. And we know that God is a light and God is love. &gt;&gt; Then good is one. Good is something singular. It's something whole. It's something righteous and pure. And in that good, there is light. That good is love. There's a lot we could say about God in his goodness. And that's a singular h oneness and a singular good. But I would say this that evil is indefinite. When you say indefinite, it just it's an undetermined length of time. It seems to be limitless, but it's not infinite. And it's varied. and it's fragmented and it comes in all sorts of different ways and it often times uh even the to the one that does evil to him it's not evil &gt;&gt; but to the one who experiences it may seem to be obvious. So there's something about evil where it is uh apparent but yet God is not like evil varied fragmented and and not infinite but God is eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's one. He's complete. &gt;&gt; As William Kalper wrote in his hymn or the poem, he said, "God moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform." That is a one God acting singularly according to one purpose. And his ways are mysterious. They're past finding out that he even himself hides the end from the beginning. And that God uh is a God who hideth himself. &gt;&gt; So there's a mysterious element even to this. Good. Goodness is that which is free from injury. Goodness is that which is uh free of violation. Evil it would be the opposite. Yet goodness itself and good remains mysterious because it's transcendent. So that is maybe just looking at this oneness of good and this good that is attributable to God. And therefore I say life is good. Life is good and I want to look at the subject of death not as an opposite to that life but this evil that exists within this stream of humanity and addressing the subject of death I think it it's good sometimes just to look at it and consider it for the purpose of understanding God better &gt;&gt; and I would say that this death is an evil that haunts mankind kind. It is unavoidable. In Genesis 2:9, it says, "Out of the ground, the Lord God made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food that springing forth." The Lord caused to grow or spring forth every tree that is beautiful to look upon. The symmetry I beauty, it's harmonious composition, and it's also good for food. So those trees that you could eat the fruit of grew out of the ground. Then in this separate designation, the tree of life also in the midst or the middle of the garden, he places it there. It's there within the middle of the garden. And the tree of knowledge of good and evil. I may for brevity sake today refer to the tree of life as the tree of life, but then the tree of knowledge of good and evil refer to it to the as the tree of knowledge. I'd like for you to consider that the tree of life and the tree of knowledge present to us two different kinds of conditions or maybe even existences where there's one of goodness and life. That's the tree of life. But then there's this other one of mixed knowledge. It's not purely good. It's not purely evil, but it's a mixed tree. And that would describe a another kind of existence. And being symbolic trees, they have fruits or characteristics of each one that is associated with the power or the life that exists within it. So there's a tree of life that would have certain characteristics that are made known by the fruit that it bears. Then you have the tree of knowledge and it is of that tree of knowledge that the woman parttook in the fruit of that and it has certain characteristics and certain consequences. In Genesis 2 16 and uh 17. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." Quite a commandment, one that we're all probably very familiar with that this tree of knowledge has is a tree of a certain kind of consequence. The day that you eat thereof, that day you'll die. The fruit of the tree of knowledge brings death. &gt;&gt; In its description, it's merely the tree of knowledge of good and evil. But the fruits of this tree bring death. And the fruits of it are evil. They're temporary. They even exist within time. But the tree of life is associated with all that is good. Tree of life is associated with all that is eternal. The tree of life is connected with creation. The creation that God said he loved. The creation in the world that God said he loved. And the one that he looked at and said, "This is good." &gt;&gt; Now, I think this is important to recognize this that this there's a creation which is of the tree of life, sustained by the tree of life, and that's the world that God loves. That's the world that God said was good. So, there's the tree of life and its fruits. this is good. But now there's this ominous tree of knowledge of good and evil that God says if you partake of that fruit, you're going to you're going to exist in something that is not the original creation. And I'm going to characterize it ultimately as death. &gt;&gt; And now notice in Jeremiah 10:12 because I want you to recognize Wednesday night we pointed out in the scripture how Jesus Christ is that tree of life. And it says he made God made the earth by his power and he established the world by his wisdom. And he stretched out the heavens by his discretion. How did God make the world? By his power. How did he establish it, sustain it? By his wisdom. How does he determine its breadth and its length? By his discretion. There's a lot that's said in just this one uh sentence here. He made the earth by his power. He establishes it and sustains it by his wisdom. and he stretches it out its lengths and its bounds by his own will or discretion, his his knowledge and discernment. So God made the world by his power and establishes it by his wisdom in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 24. But unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks, the gospel is what? Christ. Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. So when it says that he made the earth by his power and established the world by his wisdom, this is done through Christ. This logos, &gt;&gt; he does it by Christ. When you read in the beginning, what do we read? There is Christ. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. There's Christ. In the beginning, God created. There's Christ. &gt;&gt; In Colossians chapter 1 15 to1 17, speaking of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. For by him were all things created &gt;&gt; that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things are created by him by what? The power of God, the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; And he has gone. He is before all things and by him all things consist because he establishes and it is sustained by Christ, the power of God. &gt;&gt; It's made by the wisdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so Christ being the tree of life, he is the wisdom and power of God that would have symbolized the source of all life and the sustaining power for all that was created. God's power and wisdom were demonstrated in how that he in in creating and sustaining and determining the bounds of life. And I say that's good because that's the remark that God made each time. It is good. Could even be said that creation was the purpose of divine love. That creation is what was his aim. Creation itself is an act of love. Creation being an act of love. Evil is the opposite &gt;&gt; of creation. in the dawn of evil or this dissonance that interrupts and we we come into this interval of evil it finds its its root or its basis in humanity through Satan's lie and what was it you shall not surely die &gt;&gt; the question was a setup to introduce the subject but ultimately he wants to express that you're un that you cannot die in direct direct contradiction to the prophecy that said the day you eat thereof the day you die. This is so uh clear. If you eat of that tree, you'll die. And Satan changes it. If you eat of that tree, you won't die. It's a lie. An outright lie. So in Genesis chapter 3 is spec specifically verse 6. It says when the woman saw the tree was something to be desired to make one wise. Now notice the contrast now and I I'm careful saying contrast. It is contrasting. But I don't I'm not even want you just to see it as an opposite because there is a way that we can act in a way to compensate for evil. And that good we try to do is just as evil as the evil. &gt;&gt; It's all in the same arena. But here we see something that was eternal and unblenmished. And when she sees this other tree to being able to produce something to make her wise, she takes of that tree having already been told that to eat it, you'll die. And in doing so, the woman rejects the tree of love and life. And she chooses that tree of desire and death because she saw it as a tree to be desired. But there was this other tree of life which was at the heart of God which is this aim of creation. &gt;&gt; And she chooses this tree of death. All that was good God brought by the tree of life. Then Satan perverts all that was good through this tree of knowledge. Satan's unable to create. The tree of life can only is the only thing that create. The tree of knowledge of good and evil is that fruit which takes that which is good and in changing it produces something that is not good. &gt;&gt; So when the woman chose the fruit of the tree of knowledge, she's actually choosing death. You say, well, she didn't think she was choosing death. She should have known she was choosing death because she had been told that she was choosing death. when she chose the tree of knowledge, not only did she choose death, but she rejected the tree of life, which was the wisdom and power of God. What a lie. The day you eat thereof, you're going to become as gods, knowing good from evil. Okay, that's true. But you won't die. So, what did she do? She rejected the tree of life, the wisdom and power of God. The Bible says in Romans chapter 6 verse 23, I'll try to hasten our pace maybe a little bit today just because I was informed that our AC unit uh just like clockwork froze up in the month of August. In Romans chapter 6 23 it says, "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." We use this scripture quite frequently and there's your eternal life through Jesus Christ, the tree of life, the wisdom and power of God. And then you have the wages or that which is paid or given of sin is death. We know the curse upon mankind that's given upon mankind is death. Sin itself is death. It's that perverted life that we're all born into. That's what marching to the grave. Brother Elliot and I were fellowshipping on. It's the one thing that's certain. I said and taxes. And he's like death is certain. In other words, we can avoid our taxes but death is unavoidable. Even in Greek mythology, there's which is which is represents death that it's a very interesting creature which seems to imply some balance. But it's it's something that's inedible. Inevitable. Whatever it is, inedible. We don't believe in edibles here. It's inevitable. It's going to come. It's going to happen. &gt;&gt; This life is a life that is bound by the grave. So when the woman partook of the tree of knowledge, God had said the fruit of that tree is death. And we know that death passed upon all mankind by that sin. That all are conceived in sin. And a man born of a woman is of a few days, meaning he's going to die. It's not a limitless time, though it may seem to be indefinite, but man is going to pass to the grave. And then we see in Genesis 4:8 that this is a direct fruit of the tree of knowledge because it says that Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him. This is quite shocking. When you see the first death in the Garden of Eden, we see that God gives this command that the man and the woman ought to cover themselves with clothes uh that would cover their body, not just things that would cover their loins and their private parts or those parts that excited shame, but they were to dress themselves in this bloody skins of a lamb. And there was death, and we could say a justifiable death in the garden. But now here we see that there is this act of murder. Murder is evil. What's striking about this act in Genesis chapter 4 is this murder is it's the opposite of creation. &gt;&gt; Creation brings life. It's something pure. It's something that in the beginning would have had no end under the according to the way that God would sustain it. But now to take life, it's the opposite of creation. &gt;&gt; To destroy something that is good is evil. &gt;&gt; To deprive somebody else of that which is good is evil. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; We really are wanting to understand evil at its depths. And so this agony of death which we see in the fruit of Cain murdering his brother Abel, it's unavoidable for the living. And I'm looking at from the natural standpoint even according to the scripture now because we know that there's going to be a time in a moment which is the ultimate fruit of the tree of life and that's to conquer death the last enemy. So I'm not I'm not preaching this like man I guess brother Aaron just forgot all about the body change of our those that are alive and remain. No, I haven't forgot about that. That's that's ever before us. This there is there are those that sleep and are those that the stain of humanity is that there is death ultimately and when one dies there those that remain there's no entering into fellowship with the one who's gone on. So let's beyond that veil and beyond that curtain we don't have personal knowledge of. So there's an emptiness and suffering for those who are left on this side of the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said death is hard any time. So it's painful. It's distressful. This is true of death. In Luke 22 42 to 44 Jesus is praying let this cup pass from me. This cup of what? Death. &gt;&gt; This cup of suffering. And the Bible says that that this angel came and ministered unto him and it strengthened him. But in the very next verse in verse 44, in being in agony, he prayed more earnestly. I believe this is the only place in scripture where the word agony is used. Jesus was agonizing over his death. True it was. It was that he agonized over the manner of death. He knew that it wouldn't be quick. He knew that he would have to suffer. Yet the son of God who knew no sin, who wouldn't have been guilty of sin, but yet having been pressed upon by every element which could cause sin, he still agonized over death. &gt;&gt; Matthew 26, it said he was exceeding sorrowful even unto death and prayed, "Let this cup pass from me." Jesus is fighting against death. This is the one that would die. He's fighting against death. Brother Bam said the darkest part of the human spirit of human life is death and every man fears it. And there's this the death then that comes to us all. And then there's those of us who our time has not yet come and we have to face the loss of a loved one. Solomon wrote in Ecclesiastes chapter 9, "For all this I considered in my heart, even to declare all this, that the righteous and the wise, and their works are in the hand of God. No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them. All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, to the good and to the clean, to the unclean, and to him that sacrifice. To him that sacrificeth not. As is the good, so is the sinner. And he that swearth, as he that fearth an oath." What is this? What is this that comes to all? This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all. Yay, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. &gt;&gt; What's the one of it for everyone? He's saying death. &gt;&gt; The good, the bad, the clean, the unclean, the him that sacrifices, the one that refuses to sacrifice, the sinner, the one that swears, the one that fearth an oath. All these it happens to all of them. For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope. For him who continues to exist there's hope to the one that lives. For a living dog is better than a dead lion. That's quite a a statement. A living dog is better than a dead lion. How could we say that it's better to die than to live? To say that death is better than life. He says, "At least a living dog has hope. It's better than a dead lion. For the living know that they shall die, but the dead know not anything. Neither have they anymore a reward. For the memory of them is forgotten. Also, their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished. Neither have they anymore a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun." Are you picking up what Solomon's laying down? that when a man dies he he vacates this life &gt;&gt; his life no longer remains in this stream of life in this channel of living this is what death represents &gt;&gt; this is the death he's contemplating is the death of the body the death of that body brother said this first death is separating from our loved ones so whenever there's death to that body that that that has those senses which occupied the stream of life in interact acted us within this stream of time. When that body dies, there's no good or bad that he accumulates. There's no portion whatsoever. There's no interaction. Everything that was in him of the spirit and of the flesh, the senses is gone and now perish from the earth. And there is yet this element that they could be forgotten. Sure. &gt;&gt; I have not I find it um that for myself in speaking on the subject of death, I am one who has not had to experience death much closer. I I I've experienced some very uh great tragedies with my cousins passing away. I've had uh aunts and uncles pass away. My grandparents have all passed away. And but that those in those things I haven't experienced death closer than that. So I I don't want to pretend as one who can stand up and say I know I faced it. I stared it down. But there's this when I've just hearing from people and they're sharing that one of the greatest fears is not being able to remember the sound or the face of one who passes away because there's nothing tangible anymore. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I have their shirt." Oh, that's just that's just a shirt. I have their picture. That's just a picture that that that's that's something that the way that the only way that you can interact and this is maybe another I'm just going to point to it real quick. There's this evilness of imagination that Satan's perpetuated upon all mankind where when someone passes, you only know them again through your imagination &gt;&gt; or memory. But the death he's contemplating here is that of the body. In Matthew 10:28, "Fear not them which kill the body." There is a death that comes to the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. &gt;&gt; When a believer dies, he goes into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; And so if there's a second death, that is a death of the soul. &gt;&gt; But this death that we all we witness from this side of life is the death to the body. When we lose someone we love, we suffer because the one we love has become absent. &gt;&gt; I I I I'm taking this from the scripture. I'm trying to glean and learn wisdom as I have not suffered loss closer than that of a grandparent or cousin or aunts and uncles. But there is a there's a loss that is causes us to suffer because that one we loved is now absent. That's right. &gt;&gt; As I mentioned a moment ago too, it's in their absence their existence becomes unreal. &gt;&gt; It's not literal to us. So there's this emptiness. So their existence is imaginary. But the love you had for them was very real. &gt;&gt; And so it creates this emptiness in terms of this this absence of what your love was one time uh projected to. So the suffering caused by the death of others is due to that pain of absence, that reality that they're not there. And isn't that remarkable? This is a paradox. It's their absence that becomes their presence. &gt;&gt; I know that's a paradox, but it's the fact that they're missing. It's their absence is what's real to you. And therefore, it's what reminds you of the love that you had for that person &gt;&gt; because they can no longer exist. Solomon said they no longer exist in this world. There's no interplay. There's no communication. There's no accumulation. There's nothing real anymore in this life. It's emptiness in that void or that absence testifies of the one that you loved. &gt;&gt; And therefore, death is hard anytime. But we see if you turn to Proverbs chapter 8, we know that God has these laws of life. There's two laws. Law of life and the law of death. These are laws that exist. Now, so death on the horizon, death and its nastiness and its evilness, what's Solomon has even said we should see that all are in the hand of God. So in Proverbsap 8:es 32 to 35, excuse me, 35, now therefore hearken unto me, oh ye children, for blessed are they that keep my ways. Hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not. Such great uh admonition there. Hear instruction and be wise. Don't reject instruction. Instruction was given to the man and woman in the beginning. What did they do? They refused it. Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the post of my doors. That's something to write down. Blessed comes to those who hear, wait, watch and wait, looking for him or her as the scripture may refer to it as she refers to herself in the feminine. In Proverbsapter 8:1, it says, "Des not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice?" So what is it that's speaking here in Proverbs 8? Wisdom. &gt;&gt; Hearken unto wisdom. Blessed are they that keep wise ways. hear instruction, be wise, and refuse it not. Blessed is the man that he hearth wisdom, watching daily at wisdom's gates, waiting at the post of wisdom's door. For who so findeth wisdom findeth life, and shall obtain favor of the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is the sum of all things. This is the totality of everything that there is a good that's transcendent beyond all of us. And that's a good that we want to pursue. That's the good that we want to be subject to. Not contrived, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not in the way that we try to attain it within ourselves or try to fill the void in ourselves with what we think is good, but there's some yielding to it that it might operate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 8 12 to13, I wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions. The fear of the Lord is, we know it's the beginning of wisdom, but the fear of the Lord is to hate evil. &gt;&gt; Pride and arrogancy, and the devil and the evil way, and the forward mouth do I hate. The fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, results in hating evil. It also hates pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the forward mouth. These are things that God hates. So the consequence of loving good, the antithesis to the tree of life, but this consequence of loving truth is to hate evil in all of its forms. &gt;&gt; And that would include death. I say this recognizing there's a paradox to death. I'm trying to hurry here so we could relieve you of your suffering. Maybe I should have pre preached on suffering. Should have preached on hell. Proverbsapter 8:36 as we continue now as he's saying don't refuse it. Don't refuse it. Listen. He that has me, what does he say? Has finds life. There's life in wisdom. In verse 36, but he that sinnth against wisdom wrongeth his own soul. &gt;&gt; Because the soul that sinnth it shall die. that soul which will partake in the second death, not just the body. The one whose body precedes uh its soul in death, that person's miserable because the soul that sinnth it will die. And to the Jew and even scripturally, a man living in pleasure and those that lived in sin were dead already &gt;&gt; because that's the ever abiding condition of the sentence upon the soul. And so if your body precedes your soul in death. In other words, if you have not died to death in your soul, it's invisible the one whose body dies before its soul. And he that sins against wisdom wrongs his own soul. And they that hate wisdom love death. Think deeply about this. They that hate me love death. To love life then is to hate death. Death isn't evil. Life is good. All those that hate wisdom love death. To desire what brings death upon your body or your soul is to love death itself. That's why we cannot love the things of this world and have the love of God in us. &gt;&gt; Because God who is life, God who is good, to love those things that can destroy both body and soul is to love death itself. In Ecclesiastes 7 11 and 12, it says, "Wisdom is good with an inheritance and by it there's profit to them that see the sun." These are the observations of Solomon. For wisdom is a defense and money is a defense. And we all say, "Amen. I want more defense." But the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it. &gt;&gt; Say defense buys championships. &gt;&gt; Wisdom is a defense. Money is a defense. But the excellency of the knowledge is this. What? What? How is it so? How would money even be a defense? Because wisdom giveth life to them that have it. The fool and his riches is are and his money are quickly parted. &gt;&gt; There there's no defense in money in with a lack of wisdom. Wisdom is good with an inheritance because by wisdom there is a benefit under the sun. We could just speak that in natural things. But the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom gives life. &gt;&gt; Wisdom is lifegiving. If you have wisdom, it is lifegiving. In Proverbs 3:es 13 and 19, happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getth understanding. For the merchandise is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain thereof than fine gold. One of the greatest wrestlings amongst behavioral economists and psychologists and sociologists is can money actually buy you happiness? And there's many that conclude, well, it could at least make your mis misery a little bit more comfortable. and and it it's a raging debate in in in the philosophical realm, but a man that finds wisdom is indeed happy, and there's no amount of wealth that can buy that for him. Wisdom is more precious than rubies, and all things that thou can't desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. This is good. &gt;&gt; This is the goodness. This is the conseness. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her. &gt;&gt; Christ is the wisdom of God. Christ is the tree of life. Surely wisdom is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And happy is everyone that retainth her. And then this circles right back into it. The Lord by his wisdom hath founded the earth. By understanding he hath he established the heavens. These are the all sustaining lifegiving tree of life wisdom. The tree of wisdom is that tree of life. The tree of knowledge is that tree of death. In Genesis chapter 3 22, "And the Lord God said, this is after the fall, behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil, just exactly as the devil had said. They did become as gods, knowing good and evil." And God said, "Behold, they have become as one of us knowing good and evil." But the part where the lie was is not that they wouldn't know good and evil, but the lie was that they would not die as a fruit of that. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever." He then banishes them from the tree of life. Come back to this very meaning here. But catch that that this evil is that which separates you from the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Evil is that which separates you from goodness. God who is eternal life. That which separates you from good or creation. What is death? Separation from God. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; So there was a separation from creation. Evil is then this absence of the tree of life. But remember how that one's absence is the very thing that declares their presence. It's this is the paradox. Evil in this world is what makes God known &gt;&gt; through the law of contrast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Evil being the absence of the tree of life. Man being barred from that tree of life. Then we have this original reality which man has lost and become unconscious to. But it's the sinful condition and the sentence of death that testifies to a life that never ends. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And so what he says, take the tree of life and guard it and protect it because if they eat, they'll live forever. It was intended that this tree of life would not only bring forth life, but it would sustain. It would establish. By eating the fruit of that tree, all impairment, whatever it might be, would be repaired so as to prevent death forever. &gt;&gt; I gathered that from Revelations 22:es 2 and 3. And in the midst of the street of it, this new Jerusalem, this eternal eighth day city. And on either side of the river was there the tree of life, which beare 12 manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations, &gt;&gt; the sustaining of life. &gt;&gt; And there shall be no more curse. Why? Because the tree of life is blooming. &gt;&gt; It's present. It's living. Without the presence of the tree of knowledge, &gt;&gt; there is no tree of death. Therefore, there is no more curse. This tree of life was meant to give life and sustained life. In partaking of the tree of life, they would have lived forever. So, God bars man off from that. Therefore, she's continually taking from the tree of death. In Mark 3:es 1-6, I hope you could just kind of follow this with me more in in in uh and uh pushing forward momentum form. Christ who is that tree of life now. He entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered hand. And they watched him whether he would heal him on the Sabbath that they might accuse him. What outright evilness? A man has a withered hand and they are watching to see whether they'll heal him. To me, that should have been awareness enough. &gt;&gt; Should have been self-aware enough to say that, oh, here comes Jesus on the Sabbath day. Here's a man that's sick. I'm going to see if he dare straighten out that hand on the Sabbath day. You'd hope that you have enough self-awareness to say, wait, what? &gt;&gt; What am I thinking? This man has power to heal. &gt;&gt; This man is demonstrating those attributes and characteristics that we hold dear to the Messiah, to the tree of life, that which it would have healed the curse. &gt;&gt; The one that will break the curse. And we're more concerned about the timing of it. &gt;&gt; This is evil. &gt;&gt; It would be evil to deprive Christ of that power. &gt;&gt; It would be evil to contemplate withholding it from that man. And they watched him whether he would heal on the Sabbath day that they might accuse him. And he said unto the man which had the withered hand stand forth. So now he's singling them out. And he said unto them, notice how quickly he zeros in at the heart of the issue. Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath day or to do evil? &gt;&gt; It's a question of good and evil. &gt;&gt; What What is it lawful to do on the Sabbath day? To save life or to kill? &gt;&gt; Think of how rich this principle is. just how how much more we could expand it to the subject we're ministering on this morning. Jesus is standing say on this seventh day of rest, what would be evil? &gt;&gt; To save life or to kill it? What what does the law prohibit? Evil or good? &gt;&gt; This is challenging. &gt;&gt; What was it that God was prohibiting on that seventh day when he took his rest and said, "Don't eat of this tree because it'll bring death." It wasn't a prohibition on good. And he says, "But they held their peace." And then I I I love this not because I want to justify my own reactions at times, but he says when he looked round about he l When he had looked around about on them with anger to be like Jesus to be Yes, Lord. Like Jesus on earth. long being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he said unto them, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored whole as the other. And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. On the same day that the tree of life was healing a withered hand, they conspired to take the tree of life &gt;&gt; to destroy. Herein is evil personified. &gt;&gt; They hated life and loved death because he presented the choice to them. What is what is prohibited under the law on the Sabbath day? To do evil. And to them they said they would say yes the law prohibits to do evil. But yet what do they do when they leave? &gt;&gt; They indict an evil matter. They conspired to kill him. Jesus says, "Is it is it lawful to save life or to kill on this day and and unmindful?" This is that paradox of evil. It is apparent to us when we suffer it, but to the one who's committing it. To him, I have not sinned. &gt;&gt; I have not done wrong. &gt;&gt; And here they conspire to kill the son of God. They hated life. Capital Li Fe. They hated life and loved death. Because when these Pharisees did good, they were doing it on the same level of evil. They to a Pharisee, they were virtuous out of obedience to the state, &gt;&gt; obedience to the nation, obedience to the law. That was that was from which their their goodness flowed. Therefore, if there in their absinence and their works did it through the obedience to the state, who are you to argue when one adheres to tenants of communism or socialism or other things to perform that which is evil? How are you more just than they? &gt;&gt; They performed good as the opposite of evil, but rejected the good that was absolute. &gt;&gt; You recognize what's happening? They they always they did what was righteous as their compensation for the evil that was in the world. But they rejected that good which was an absolute. I think maybe some of you are familiar with it. Some of the early church writers wrote about this and made this comparison. They actually called Plato's Republic and that conversation with Socrates that there was prophecy of Jesus Christ because in I think it's book two it speaks of a just man. If a just man entered into this world and when he say a just man it means one who wants to be good not just seem good &gt;&gt; that that one who is good which was Christ &gt;&gt; when he if he was to enter into the world the conclusion was if this just man who was good and didn't just seem good would appear evil to those unjust men &gt;&gt; and then the conversation the conclusion is the unjust would crucify &gt;&gt; the just man That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what happened when Christ who is the way, the truth, the life, the one who was just, the one who did not just want to appear good. How was it not just appearance sake? He was eating with the heathen. He was doing things that was completely ringing up the aristocracy and the totalitarian religious system. They hated what he was doing, but he desired to be good than just seem good. &gt;&gt; And what did they do? They killed him. They crucified him. because that which was good was hated by evil. This further paradox as it relates to this good and evil and death. Jesus said in John 15:13, "Greater love hath no man than this, that he laid down his life for his friends." What a paradox. Jesus in dying willingly offered up his life. But it wasn't just this offering of his life. It was also punishment. He had to despite himself. He had to disregard himself and his own interest. The Bible speaks to that this duality of the sacrifice. It's a free will offering. But then he had to also deny himself in doing so. &gt;&gt; And listen, it's pretty much true about human nature. If all that we were asked is to give things up freely, that would be easy to do. But when we're asked to deny ourselves, whoa, wait a minute. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not just taking up the cross and a free will offering, but to deny yourself and come follow him. It's that part of losing self. It's that part of dying to self. It's that that's the part that's the void that we so anxiously resist. &gt;&gt; But Jesus willingly laid down his life. His death was one of the most precious things given to man. &gt;&gt; We can say Christ is the greatest gift to man. But what made that gift a masterpiece? What made it beneficial to us? We can say the greatest gift ever, the most perfect holy thing that ever walked the face of the earth is Jesus Christ. And we merely would have been observers of a drama. But when he died, that death became most precious to us. &gt;&gt; To think the most precious thing that ever happened to the greatest gift ever upon the face of earth was the death of that Messiah. &gt;&gt; But in Acts 2:24, it says, "Whom God hath raised up, he did not leave him in that grave, having loosed the pains of death." &gt;&gt; That agony of death has now been loosed. because it was not possible that he should beholden of it. &gt;&gt; Do you realize death was necessary &gt;&gt; in order for us to attain life? &gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I have the quote here. Yes, it's there in water separation. Death is the only thing that'll bring redemption. &gt;&gt; All right. This is this is a paradox. &gt;&gt; This is the paradox. Life, life, life, life, life, life life, life life. Life life is good, but death is the only thing that restores that good life. &gt;&gt; The tree of knowledge brought death. &gt;&gt; And now death is the only thing that can bring life back. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 2 14 and 15. For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also him like himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil. The devil's the one that had the power of death. And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. This is the reality. They that fear death, which we all do as humans, there's some fear of death. Not to not to trigger anybody, but that to me was the biggest curse of CO 19 besides the 19 pounds we all put on, &gt;&gt; but it was just the fear, &gt;&gt; the consequence of it. &gt;&gt; Like, well, I've we've all had a sore throat before. We've all been sick. We've had fevers, you know, we we're still here. But then all of a sudden, it was like, well, but you could just immediately drop dead and die. &gt;&gt; And so, it's the fear of death. It was you're facing now your own mortality. Right? It &gt;&gt; it's it's more present, more of a reality than it for many of us than it has ever been before. So there is through the fear of death bondage. But having loosed the pains or the agony of death, death is destroyed by Christ. Through death, he might destroy him that had the power of death. And in destroying the devil, death itself is destroyed by death. &gt;&gt; Amen. By his death, he destroys death. Revelations 21:4, "God shall wipe away all their tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death." There's death here. We've eaten from the tree of knowledge. Our lives are be born between Eve and Satan. We have death that works within our members. We have a sentence of death upon our soul. Death is ever present all around us. But there will be no more death. In Revelation 6, that pale horse rider is called death and hell follows him. But Revelations 20:14 says, "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. As I close this service, I think about that Psalm 23 verse4. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. Brother Brandham when he looks at that shadow, he said there has to be a certain amount of light in death to make it a shadow. &gt;&gt; This is the paradox of it. In the meantime, then if death has a certain amount of light in it, we should love life and hate death, we shouldn't hasten ourselves to death. We shouldn't just embrace that absence and and and pour ourselves into it. Jesus even himself resisted it a and didn't want to die. But we ought to pursue truth and mercy, reject evil, continue to hate death. In Psalms 116:15, precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. That takes it from the vantage point of God. We do not stand in thestead of God in this sense. We who exist here can only see the finality, the absence and the emptiness to God. He has watched out over life from the beginning. When it said precious in the eyes sight of the Lord is the death of his saints, God masters death. &gt;&gt; We know that he puts bits in trouble's mouths. But now death becomes this buggy or this this vehicle &gt;&gt; that ushers his saints into his presence. &gt;&gt; And therefore God watches out over it so that it is precious. &gt;&gt; He can prevent it and having been able to prevent it, he can allow it at such time that he desires &gt;&gt; in that manner that fits his purpose. We are taught that death cannot take you until the purpose of God is finished in your life. This stands for the proposition that as a son or daughter of God, you cannot die prematurely. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know that that it helps us deal with death at all from our vantage point. If you find ourselves in a a perilous situation and we're desparing of death, we might not be able to say, "Well, I guess it's just my time." There's still going to be a human reaction to it. And that even for those who've tasted it and we don't know what exists for them beyond and we have this hope and this faith and and they enter into the presence of God. Uh we believe that there is still yet for us some sort of emptiness and maybe it seems hollow sometimes and say well they were immortal till that time. I could think of when they die they could have died here when this happened or that happened. But yet it is true there is a sense of immortality on the elect of God until God desires to take them home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians 4:13 that we sorrow not even as others which have no hope. Brothers, if you could come to your instruments, our hope is in the knowledge that evil, this evil which we endure, this death that we hate, it's not infinite, but it'll have an end. &gt;&gt; We sorrow not as others because our hope is in the truth that in setting our will to do good, doing good destroys evil little by little. Paul suggests that those who do not know this hope are tortured with suffering and futility because they embrace and endure the cycle filling that bottomless pit with water. It never fills up. Right? &gt;&gt; Therefore, if you love truth, if you love life, then it means that you will endure suffering. And I'll say we accept death. That may be a hard statement. We accept injury. We accept that absence. And then our hope is in the tree of life which can heal those wounds presently that can fill that emptiness of its own accord because we have this hope that one day all this evil will end. That's the hope. How many of us standing where are today can look back and say, "Well, if I knew this is where I'd be, I would not have agonized so much then." And maybe in just looking at that good, you can look at the evil and know that God has a way of making this work out. &gt;&gt; If we're truly to appreciate the good, there is some sense of accepting evil and examining evil and recognizing evil to the fullest extent. Otherwise, we create that artificial good which is imaginary. And so if we're really to have faith and to trust in God and to believe in him uh with this real true hope, this hope of glory, then we believe that God heals all wounds. And that being Christians, we don't have to be afraid of death. That even in death, there's some glory to it. There's some beauty to it. But it's life that is real. As the psalm of life says and Henry Wadris Longfell, life is real. Life is earnest. The grave is not the goal. Dust thou art to dust returnest. Was not spoken of the soul. We have a hope that transcends this life. It's a hope in good that is greater than the good and evil that's even here on earth. And it's life. Thy loving kindness is better than life. What is that? This life. What is that life which is good? Eternal life. sit at the gates and watch for wisdom. Wait at its door. That's what we can do on a daily basis to make life good, to have life. Let's stand to our feet. [Music] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. our gracious heavenly father. Lord, it thank you for being so kind to us, Lord. And we know that when it comes to the subject of death, there's a tremendous wrestling. There is a a war within ourselves to accept death as a good. Now Lord, there is maybe some relief in recognizing that death in itself is a consequence of the tree of knowledge that murder is evil, death is evil, but that there's this redeeming quality in death and that redemption of life had to come through death and that you have used death as a vehicle to deal with the devil himself and hell that follows him. that one day there will be this summation and this totality, this finishing up which it death of the body is placed under our feet and then the death, the second death will have finished its course and vanquished all evil forever. And Lord, I pray that those of us who have experienced death [Music] could be comforted by you. those that fear death could embrace the hope that it speaks of. Now Lord, there's so many evils that we could examine. So many evils that are ever pressing, so many dis so much dissonance that surrounds us. Somehow Lord, you used death for great glory. Somehow Lord, you've ordained it. You wrote the drama. You've you've composed this symphony to include those dissonant tones of loss, even the silence and the absence, but yet somehow, Lord, it just creates that tension and expectation of redemption. How is it that emptiness and absence could testify of your presence? How is it that death could point to your glory, but yet we see it? And ask, Father, that you be a comforter to those who have lost, Lord, to those who fear death. May they fear it no longer. Surely Lord, we can call it what it is. Surely we don't try to hasten our death. Surely we don't tempt you by pursuing it. But Lord, we pursue you, the tree of life, knowing that it is life to us. Keep us as the apple of your eye. Lord, lead us and guide us. We thank you for the visitors that are here, the perseverance to endure such heat. And Lord, I pray that you'd be a blessing upon the people as they are dismissed. We ask all this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
