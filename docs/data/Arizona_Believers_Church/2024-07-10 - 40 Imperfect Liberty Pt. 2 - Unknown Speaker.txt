TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to do part two on imperfect Liberty we started it Sunday morning tonight I don't want to spend a lot of time backgrounding because I think it's important for us to go a little bit further in this subject matter but we're using this phrase Liberty from the scripture which means freedom or to be free uh it's kind of rooted in one who's a Freeborn citizen or one who is not um a servant and the Greek word means to be exempt from and so it has this idea of no longer being bound by or restrained by something and as we looked in the scripture in Timothy and also in Corinthians this perfect Liberty or Liberty as we would say scripturally is that freedom to become Christlike where you're exempt from your base human nature I I've Loved thinking about it that way in this sense that sometimes we feel like we have to respond a certain way or we just always do and this is what humans do and we've got a a thousand excuses as to why we do it but rather when we think about our Liberty in Christ it means we're exempt from our worst instincts we're we're exempt from these uh human uh knee-jerk reactions and reflexes to certain things and that's what it means to be free so perfect Liberty as we identified it on Sunday is to and this is you'll just find this if you look into the word is intended uh by Paul or by the writers it's to live as one ought to so Liberty when you have Liberty you can live as you ought to live you can live correctly you could do the things that are right and it's to uh to fulfill your duty when you're rest strained or when you're bound maybe there's some loss of privilege or right or inability to do something but if you have Liberty you can live or be act as you ought to and in this case of the word of God looking into the word of God we can fulfill God's desires we can meet the word expectation in our lives but now on the other hand this imperfect Liberty I like to put it this way it's that promise of Liberty um or kind of when someone says come in it's free a and then um and then you look closer just says free Wi-Fi and so there was this promise or this illusion uh of Liberty but in reality it's bondage and uh come in just listen to a 60-minute seminar and you're going to have a free vacation right you're like hey come on this is easy a trip to Mexico this is going to work out perfect it's absolutely free right you're free to go whenever you want too anybody ever done this they know exactly what I'm talking about surprised they haven't been arrested for kidnapping but there's this idea this appearance and this allurement to free and as human beings we love it but it's a imperfect Liberty because in the end what was promised as Liberty becomes bondage and so this imperfect Liberty that we're talking about is to actually live as one wants to not necessarily as they ought to that we have desires In the Flesh we have certain needs or wants that we might have or think that we have and so when we have imperfect Liberty we're free to do what we desire to do or what pleases the Flesh in 1 Peter chap 2: 16 and again this is just a part of a larger reading we did on Sunday as free Paul Peter is saying as free men not using your Liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as Servants of God you are free servants of God what a paradox what it seems to be a contradiction you are free servants of God Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ yet in Christian Liberty and free as free not using your Liberty as a cloak of evil wrong intent or motive so Liberty is not licensed to do what everyone wants to do in his flesh he feels to do a certain he can certain thing he can do it so Liberty is not licensed to do whatever we want to do in our flesh and it's certainly not Liberty to disobey God's word we cannot say that we are in Liberty or perfect Liberty and then deny the word of God reject the word of God add to the word of God or take away from the word of God in 2 Peter 2: 19 it says while they promis them Liberty it's talking about the false prophets and these false anointed ones that will go out and their uh attitude towards people and the their motive and objective he says while they promis them Liberty they themselves are the Servants of corruption notice just that symmetry with what he says in the first letter he says you are free but Servants of God and now they say these guys are promising freedom but themselves they're ser Servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same as he brought in bondage so if you're given to something if something takes control of you if it becomes on this level of soft addictions or real addictions you've been overcome by it you're not free I'm free to do this well if it's if it begins to dominate or dictate or gets its hook in you you've surrendered you've been overcome by it and that what you're overcome by you become a servant too and we read this statement just chopping out a little bit of it this is very very near where we ended uh Sunday morning and the anointed ones at the end time for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine this is from Timothy where he's uh he's telling Timothy to um to teach and to preach and he's telling this right kind of attitude because they'll come a time when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall Heap for themselves teachers having itching ears and go ahead and do anything they want to so notice there's liberty and it's saying he says 'd do the work of an evangelist there's certain thing to to do and it's going to be important uh maybe Sunday or next Wednesday night when we get into some of uh some of these other services on Liberty and do the work of evangelist and just keep still and do it what you're called to do and even though maybe you could do more even though you feel there should be more do what you're called to do do this work and it says so they will do whatever they want to and this is their justification it's all right we got the same signs and wonders so in instead of examining themselves by the word they just take a part of the word and say well we've got signs and wonders and that's it Checkmate and it's amazing the number of people and I I'm not uh wanting to well I just I'll take a deep breath settle down a little bit and and say it with a smile we should really we should resist the temptation in having an answer resist the temptation when standing for what we believe to say well we've got signs and wonders what about you you just sound like a lot of cheerleaders we got Spirit yes we do we got Spirit how about you right it it it just it's empty because if we want to get into a raw raw and a pep rallet you're going to get beat you're going to get beat Elevation Worship is going to have you beat the Pentecostal of Alexandria going to have you beat right so there's this idea there's this principle in the word of God that I'm standing on faith and there I stand and so this idea that well we can do whatever we want to we have these signs and wonders following and there's this rejection of the truth because he says and shall be turned from the truth and be brought into fables and dogmas fictions lies remember Hezekiah and zedekiah and those H and I and those lies actually that we read about in the scripture where they've caused the people to believe a lie balum zedekiah H and I they were lying falsely saying it was God and encouraging certain actions encouraging certain things when God had not spoken and so there's their own lust that's so key there their own lust are driving them their Liberty their flesh says do it and Sprite says obey your thirst so they obey it a and this is that uh attitude especially of leoda now the scripture we've been looking into was that being beguiled from the Simplicity that is in Christ and that's maybe the core of everything I've been looking at over the last couple months is this Simplicity that is in Christ and how God hides himself in that Simplicity but yet that's where he reveals himself so that the devil can make us complicated God won't be there and in the scripture 2 Corinthians chapter 3:1 17 now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty how many have ever heard that quoted before where the spirit of the Lord there there is Li is there is liberty and it becomes a mantra or phrase or kind of this Banner of well the Lord had his way where the spirit of Lord there Liberty Liberty to do these certain predefined things or manifest in a certain way and there's a lot of verbiage that's used sometimes to express it or to uh not necessarily justify but just to um make the point that we believe the spirit of the Lord was there and because the spirit of the Lord was there there was Liberty to do these certain things that in themselves are not anti-rip so it's they're not trying to make this direct contradiction but it's this direct connection oh the spirit of the Lord was there and that's why this happened but when we looked into the scripture both in Timothy and Corinthians we found that where the perfect law of Liberty is and where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty is speaking about beholding the revealed word and the revealed word doing an internal work that then manifest in the image of Christ not in uh not in church but in life in life and so that the nature of the word we're partakers of divine nature therefore we're living out the word of God so we're w to take this principle of Liberty and really get anchored in it scripturally and where we ended Sunday morning I believe I said we're addressing the LIE of Liberty that hides behind it is written and taken that in Matthew where Satan tempted Jesus and that uh how it parallels to the Temptation in the garden we're wanting to consider how the word of God is used to entice the believer to serve their own Pride own lust and their own flesh now it's not a bargain to say well your flesh wants it why don't you just have it but it's this idea that no this is what God really wants so this is what really is right and this is how that you should really enjoy these things it's this perversion of Liberty I think we use this is one way to think about it in leod DEA Liberty is used as a cover for luxury that we want to feel a certain way we want to enjoy certain things we want to have certain things and if we want it to be a certain way we just use Liberty as a code word for luxury we want to Lavish ourselves lasciviousness now I'll say this now and you're be glad you're here don't tell anybody who's not here tonight but this is a setup this whole thing and maybe if they're not here they're not getting set up but just don't tell them it's a setup in case they stream or I'm able to f f fit it in on Sunday but there's a way that we can live so this covers all of us whether it be the way that we lead the way that we parent the way that we respond to things is a way we can live that is legalistic or licensed and it's not really free we're not promoting Liberty in Christ we're not encouraging atmosphere of growth and surrender so there's a way that we can live arrogantly presumptuously carnally to where it's legalistic where it's binding to carnality or license lasciviousness that's this loosing of carnality and Liberty of the false Liberty and as we looked into the scripture and we saw that uh Satan tempted Christ to perform the supernatural with it is written that he was trying to make Jesus an initiator of something that he said well God ha said the word has said he was wanting to make him the instigator of God fulfilling his word well the Bible says and in the same way s Satan tempted The Woman by saying well yeah hath the Lord not said you shouldn't do this and so she answers accurate ly he says well it's not exactly that and put her in this position where she felt that she had to act or was encouraged to act in order to bring forth something or manifest something that was seemingly being withheld from her and so when Satan tempted Christ in in in the book reading in Matthew that second Temptation brought him to the Pinnacle of the temple to the house of the Lord and he tried to cause Jesus to what tempt God through some public display by some outward act that he would cause some sort of vindication and God would come to his Aid and say there will the Angels were to Bear him up and we took this statement from the Harvest time if he can't tempt you away from the word command these stones to be made bread and he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God and so he he said I'm a word believer I'll stay with the revealed word of God so he says if he can't kept you away from the word right now let that marinate a little if it has to be overnight go ahead and seal it up and let it Mar a little bit overnight but that says something if he can't tempt you away from the word no I'm going to stay with the word then he'll give you a supernatural offer I'm not I'm not rejecting the me I'm not a message rejector I'm not a word rejector I've embraced the word and brother man said this and the message says this the message says that but then there's this subtle adding to or taking away and he says so it's this it's this deception the spirit of deception he'll give you a supernatural offer he'll he said I tell you what you get up here and dive off the temple and bring back up show the people that you can do something Supernatural wow boy he got him there now watch this this is it watch when you get to the end where this temptation come as the serpent beguiled Eve in the beginning as he tried to tempt Christ in the middle in the end the body of Christ will come under Temptation by the word maybe he might let some of you speak in tongues and think you got it he might even let you prophesy though it not be with the word this is maybe a little bit of an aside I've seen people stand up and prophesy was contrary to the word as the East is from the West it's the word that you live by somebody says something in the name of the Lord it doesn't happen it's a li in spirit them Supernatural gifts Satan can just hand them out by the handfuls he says that don't mean one thing now when he says it doesn't mean one thing he's not saying they aren't Supernatural gifts he's not even saying that it's not the Lord but it's just some it's some means of ma God manifesting himself it's some way that God does something and works but yet that in itself cannot be the IND allbe that that's not what God's trying to arrive at they have their place in God's economy they have their place and how God deals with an individual in the church and he's saying so when he says that don't mean one thing saying that doesn't mean you're Vindicated or you're right so I want to use the example so I am going to use the example uh from Mark chapter 16 that applies spiritual it applies maybe in this religious way but it is just one example of how that we can be enticed and encouraged in some sort of license or legalism that is uh that is causing us to no longer to causing us to tempt God if I could put it that way just as Christ was tempted now Mark 16: 15 we'll read to verse 20 he said under this and this is the word of God go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature I I'm wanting to look at this because we've already read in a couple places where people said we've got signs and wonders we've got Supernatural gifts you're tempted to do Supernatural unless we at any point take that to mean that we should reject signs or we should reject the supernatural we should reject laying on of hands or uh healings and things like that whoa tap the brakes he says go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth believeth what the gospel that is preached and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned it doesn't matter if he's baptized if he doesn't believe it's by faith right and these signs shall follow them that believe very important in my name they shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now there's things here in verses 17 and 18 that we could line up with other places in scripture and see that this manifestation or this expression I is is is is not satanic or weird in the sense that God never does that the people never did that we could see where uh the casting out of devils is done right and and that it was and then even the were taught James that to call the Elders to lay hands and to pray the prayer faith and so there's other scriptures that give us these uh these marching orders and these this Commission of certain promises that we can Avail ourselves to if we look at this I want you to catch this the order of the Great Commission we call this the Great Commission there's one thing that he tells us to do and it's go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature this is the must this is the ought in other words we can't take verses 17 and 18 and do that and fulfill the Great Commission what we have to do is preach Christ the word we have to preach the gospel the good news that is the first thing that is the must that is the ought and then Faith because it says and he that believeth faith and signs will follow and let me say this the signs are as certain as anything if the gospel is preached faith and signs will follow and the signs are just as certain as anything but if you read this in order you and if you I want to use it this way you go into all the world and preach the gospel and the person to whom you preach it to if they believe and are baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ they shall be saved so that's the one that believes and then it says these signs shall follow them that believe not the one that preached now I know you might be saying you learned that in law school no I didn't we're just reading the plain English you are a Believer so signs will follow but in the order of the Great Commission you preach the word CU by faith you're settled in it by faith you believe it and so preaching the word and exciting Faith the believer who believes the word has the promise that signs will follow them that have believed the gospel it's the way that this uh church is being established in the word of God being established in the beginning so the signs are as certain as anything to him who hears the word of God and believes but the signs are not what's emphasized first yeah in other words if you preach the gospel and in preaching the gospel someone heard who became a Believer and they became him that believeth that is baptized and is saved and then he that believeth had signs and wonders follow him he does his ministry is not signs and wonders his ministry in Great Commission is go into all the world and preach the gospel that's the one thing he ought to do is go into all the world and preach the gospel it's a general commission and if you recognize in the flow of the scripture what is emphasized first and what was done was to preach the gospel in verses 19 and 20 just spell it out so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up in heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth performing signs and wonders watch it and they went forth and preached everywhere right that's what they were told to do so when they listened to what he said God said to preach Christ preach the word preach the gospel let's do that am the Lord Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following so who did the rest the Lord did the Great Commission preached the word and the Lord would do the rest the rest the signs and wonders in other words are his responsibility yes sir on that we have to be confident whether you be in the Pulpit or whether you be in the the seat a a and you're teaching your children or testifying to family or preaching the gospel and the life that you live you you have to be confident that you're doing your part to live and that God's the one that does the rest because there's this impatience and I'm kind of letting Sunday or Wednesday go a little bit there's this impatience where you feel the need to be Vindicated you feel the need to know God's with you so you want to step beyond the bounds of just staying with the word of God and you want to see something happen so you can know that you're a Believer what is the requirement to be a genuine believer believe God this is the work of God what can we do to work the mighty works of God believe on him whom he have sent the rest is his responsibility now please listen very very closely I think we've got a a great audience tonight the the balcony's almost full people everywhere spread out everywhere just now listen signs these things we read here in verses 17 and 18 they cannot be ratified into a law now we can't read this and say this is what we have to do if this is what we have to do pass around the snakes I know we better we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ because the Bible says we have to we we this is what we better do but it's not written that way we would need to be passing out the Arsenic or some poison but it says preach the word and he that believeth the Lord will confirm with signs and wonders following so if you took these things and looked at it with just the slightest wrong emphasis just change one word it can bring you into bondage and cause us to tempt God if we make these signs that we ought to do them then it's not perfect Liberty when the signs become you ought to be doing this it becomes imperfect Liberty because we forfeit perfect Liberty by submitting to traditions of man or or giving into Satan's demands Galatians chapter 2: 3-5 kind of moved this up a little bit I didn't want to let this get lost and buried tonight but it says and there's if you could go back and read more of this in Galatians I've been drawn a lot from the letter to the Galatians because he he he tells them earlier I can't believe you're so soon removed from the gospel that set you free so neither Titus who was with me being a Greek was compelled uh was compelled to be circumcised other words I didn't force them to be circumcised and that because the false Brethren unawares brought in who came in privy to spy out our Liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that we might BR that they might bring us into bondage spy out the Liberty you have in Christ now they want to spy it out they want to perform some Espionage and cause and compel Titus to be circum circumcised though he was a Greek caused him to be circumcised In the Flesh and he says that this is someone who is spying out and testing your bounds of Liberty in order to bring Titus back into the bond back out of bondage into bondage that the word The Gospel called him out of he says to whom he gave place by subjection no not for an hour we didn't give place to these false Brethren unawares spying out your Liberty that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you now maybe in a in a congregation you say that in this entire church everybody is circumcised I'm not talking about this one but in there in the time the Jews say hey all the men we were Jews we were Jews according to the law we're circumcised and now you have this new convert it's kind of like we all we've all we're all circumcised you need to be circumcised and Paul is saying we didn't give into that we didn't give into that for one moment that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you what is the truth of the Gospel look into Galatians it's justification by faith in Jesus Christ justification by faith not by works he wanted it to stand in the promise of God that by faith we are saved it's in Acts chapter 15 that you can look it up in in verse one where it speaks of these certain men which came down from Judea and taught that except you be circumcised after the man of Moses you cannot be saved what was this the adding of a fleshly evidence or work the adding of some ceremony the adding of a tradition that was visible that was confirmable and now it's important to recognize that to the Jews God gave them a sign a physical sign of circumcision that was evidence in the flesh that they were the Seed of Abraham certainly it was uh you could replicate it and you could impersonate it but yet to them it was a law that they must have abided by and now it's trying to be carried over in as a law in the and the circumcision of the heart is now to be made manifest In the Flesh as an evidence that you're a Christian and Paul's saying we did not give into that because it it erode from the truth of the Gospel now is it a sin to be circumcised is it wrong no no would it make him any less of a Christian absolutely not but when it's added to the gospel and they said it's that you have to do it after the manner of this person and after the manner of the law and this gospel you cannot be saved it's an evidence that you're in that was a defiling of the truth of the gospel Paul was advocating from the true Liberty which the Gentiles were then in Galatians rejecting Noti they had true Liberty but now they're rejecting that Liberty to be brought act back under bondage and I hope that I could say this and in doing so just capture a lot of things we've been teaching on lately but there's this humanistic fig Leaf instinct to do something to cover ourselves Works based evidence we want to have that security blanket I believe I believe and I also did this right now I realize that there is I I'll say this this is personal I apologize if I'm pulling back the curtain a little bit too much my comfort is in Revelation the revealed word of God my comfort is in faith it's where you got to stand it's where you got to Anchor and one of the one of the common arguments against only believe is that you make believing too easy and and and so that if you just say just believe then some people are just going to believe and and I get it that there's a way that the gospel can be so watered down where you just tell people to have faith and in having faith it's become just so easy for them to think that they're a Believer just because they have mentally ascented to something but as soon as you change only believe and in defense of them making it too easy and it's called maybe easy believism in our defense against that we want to make it harder the only thing you do is you harm the True Believer cuz when you say no no no no no it's not only believe it's only believe plus and you know what the make believer says amen right and you know what the non-believer says I don't believe it anyways and you know what the believer says I don't know I don't know am I not in it am I missing something man I'm anchored in this word I believe it with all my heart I walk in dry places and I feel that he's testing me so I'm sure that I'm standing on thus sayith the Lord and nothing else but now I got somebody who's yelled and screaming in my face telling me that I better do this and better do that or I'm not in it and I'm and I'm thinking man anybody that's had easy believism you clearly didn't believe right if anybody ever said it was easy just believing guess what you weren't believing that's why the devil wasn't worried about you right you were following him the whole time he was just dangling the carrot hey this is great but when you go to believing and believing only and beli in the word of God and taking every word of God and feeding on every word of God and and taking them at his word and saying I'm going to live by bread alone the devil doesn't make that easy at all so it becomes our security blanket let me know when I've been 40 minutes and the sermon thirst brother bradam says and there is also just people who live upon the emotions I we realize there's two sides by the kidy digs did a great job on that he says some people say well we got a lot of that in our Pentecostal movement and they'll go in which is fine they'll pat their hands and play the music the music stops a bucket of water went over the thing over everything now we got in a habit of habit of doing that it's just become one of our customs now be don't don't get uh pick up your pitchforks and want to run after the musicians that's not what he saying saying this this custom this tradition that follows it and people are living on these emotions and he says it's fine they pat their hands they play the music but then as soon as the Music Stops it's as if the signs are no longer effective the manifestations the works these things it's almost like they stop and he says when you're worshiping God in the spirit and in truth when it becomes accustom for you to do it because you think you ought to do it because you think if you don't shout or up and down or dance with the music your neighbor is going to think you're backslid you're drinking from a stagnated stream notice what's happened is where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty oh I'm so glad that I could come to church and I can be at home I could be at peace in his presence and I respond to the word in a way that I'm free to and then all of a sudden it becomes one of these things like well you notice Brother Martin never claps can't say that anymore do you notice he doesn't clap very much he just kind of like and then it's like okay now I got a clap you ever been in a church where everybody always stands and you're over there going guess I better stand right because it's custom and you feel as if you're not standing you're going to be the one that's going to be railed on during the service right and you people that don't have the audacity to stand when the spirit of God's moving you're like hey buddy I'm in a wheelchair CH so when it's a custom you think you ought to notice how he says you ought to do it that's not Liberty anymore true Spirit of the Lord's not there anymore says your backslid he said right until it fills every fiber until the Holy Ghost itself is bubbling in you I don't care whether the music is playing whether they're playing near my God to thee or whatever it is the holy spirit still ringing the glory bells in your heart that satisfies notice the satisfaction is when it's inside I'm at peace amen I'm at peace that's God's satisfying portion anything less than that you're done you might speak with tongue like men and angels you might give all your goods to feed the poor you might prophesy you might have knowledge understand all Mysteries and all these things and you still become nothing 1 Corinthians 13 until that satisfying something that can only quench that thirst my soul thirst for the Living God like the heart panted for the water Brook until I can find it I'll perish when you get to hungering for God like that something is going to take place the spirit is to lead you to those great fountains now there's a good thing to Worship in the spirit that's true but sometimes you have Spirit without truth John 4 said we worship God spirit and Truth notice there's a spirit where the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty but you're taking your Liberties when you add to or take away from the truth that's exactly right Jesus is the truth that's exactly right and he is the word the streams of God sent to satisfy you is the word he says in the natural Satan's polluted every one of them the Natural Things even the things that we can enjoy and we should have Liberty to enjoy Satan's polluted them by what adding a word to it by taking away he's poisoned he has put the poison dope in everyone that he could get into that's right he took that great stream of the church that was God's way Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it now there's different arguments on that Roman people the Catholic say it's built upon Peter that be so Peter backslid in a few days so it wasn't sure it wasn't built upon Peter Petra The Rock and then the Protestant says he's built upon himself Jesus Christ not to be different but a different with them he never built it on either one he built it upon the revelation of who he was he said blessed art thou Simon son of Jonah's Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you not by knowledge you didn't learn it by books you didn't learn it by joining Church you didn't learn it in the shouts didn't learn it in the runs but the Holy Ghost itself has brought the person of Jesus Christ to you then Upon This Rock Revelation Faith I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that that can't be poisoned the holy thirst has been satisfied in the person of Jesus Christ there you are that's the thing you want to look for satisfy that thirst with that amen lest there be some longing some wanness some lust that you've got to satisfy some itch that you've got to scratch with something else other than the revealed word that's the satisfying portion now I think I've used this quite a bit so I hope I'm not just beating a dead Penny but in Matthew chapter 7: 21- 24 he says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven remember James built his entire premise of perfect law of Liberty is he that hears the word and doesn't do it is one who beholds his own self in a mirror turns away and forgets who he was but we who look into the perfect law of Liberty we are those that hear and do says it in James but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful he but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed that's the perfect law of Liberty is to hear and then no longer be restrained by the flesh to no longer to be exempt from the base instincts and Natures but to do what the word of God says to do he that doeth the will of the Father which is in heaven not the glory glory Lord Lord but he that does the will of God many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works now these works just even think of this wonderful Works versus Greater Works there's things that are a wonder and that we wonder at and things that take place and things that happen and they many they wonderful works and we could say that prophesying in his name uh would be nothing against that unless you're just lying but where there be prophecies and these different gifts and tongues the spirit can move in that but they can also be impersonated or represented as truth in thy name cast out Devils now there's people that try to do that the devil's like Paul I know Jesus I know but who are you and so there is it's not a guarantee that you can just say that you are a Believer and that happen yet we could say they did it with his name and done many wonderful works a lot of things that you could put under that banner and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity now what's wrong was the iniquity prophesying in his name was the iniquity casting out Devils was the iniquity doing many wonderful works or did they hear the revealed word and didn't do it in other words they didn't do the Y they didn't do the the perfect Liberty they found imperfect Liberty they went to the Fig leaves they went to the cover they used their Liberty as a cloak of maliciousness they found themselves wanting and pursuing these other things instead of being and satisfied with the faith in the word of God and letting him do the rest they were enticed into these other things so he says depart from me you worked iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth him I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock Upon This Rock I'll build my church upon the revelation of Jesus Christ the word if you go and continue to read who he Likens that that foolish man to the foolish rests upon Works he rest upon signs and not the word by faith it's built upon the Sands the flesh the shifting Sands the things that can be moved as the wind blows and a a and movement in Earth and man could easily move and manipulate that's what the foolish does but that man who hears and builds and does what the word of God said he's like a wise man who's built his this is true knowledge and understand he's built his house upon the rocken and maybe the man that builds his house upon the sand wants to be able to move it if he has to he doesn't want to get pinned down on doctorine he doesn't want to get pinned down on something he wants to be able to move if he has to well I thought it was this but oh wow do you see the meetings they're having these days right good oh I'm very I'm very near closing on this so I feel like like I'd have to give some I I want to be sure that I'm a proper uh properly standing for and defending the word of God the spirit of God works according to his word in healing the spirit of God works according to his word in in Miracles we believe in those things he's he's still a miracle working God we believe the spirit of God works according to his word in gifts yes sir there's things that we can bring back to the word of God but let me say this the word defines them the word gives it its scope the word is is showing us where it's at but let me emphasize this shouting dancing crying and these different things that we can do as humans it's a human response to the stimulus to a stimulus if you're crying when the spirit of the Lord moves you're not wrong for that but it's not Christ in you boohoo and true it's you when you shout you dance you cry you pass out whatever it is you do when the spirit of the Lord moves on you that's a human response to stimulus or it's manufactured that mass hysteria that begins to work in a very localized way where one person's doing another person does it and so one person can genuinely according to a physical humanistic response to stimulus the genuine power of the Holy Ghost causes someone to cry shout Dance Pass Out be slain in the spirit but recognize scripturally that those things are the humans response to it now I have a much larger uh study on this and maybe we could do a a series maybe in the 30s we could do a whole series for that decade on on the what what Pentecost was and what the move of God at Pentecost was and what the faith of the Pentecostal fathers manifested itself in and what's the single most ID identifiable characteristic of the day of Pentecost not tongues that had been done before not shouting or dancing because miam did that David did that before the Holy Ghost was even given to the church those were all Hebrew traditional ways of expressing themselves to a move of God there's the series trust me we can get a lot out of that the wise man though he does what the revealed word says he ought to do he's a hearer and a doer and if the word said you ought to be handling snakes we better be at petmart in the morning does that still exist we could make money selling snakes to message Believers it's your snakes are us seriously couldn't we do it are you a Believer if the word said you must no matter how scared you are of a snake your faith would say well then I better do it if the word said you better drink this poison because the word of God says you better drink this poison you know what we better pass the poison but the word doesn't say You must the word doesn't say you ought but the word says You must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and guess what you got wet guess what you did it in the name of Jesus Christ whatever the word says you ought to do you do it sir now are you saying signs shouldn't follow no signs ought to follow but that's his part yes whosoever lookth into the perfect law of Liberty hears sees and does he's not a forgetful here he's not a foolish man he's built upon Revelation he's the one that shall be blessed in his deed because he's a doer of the work what's the work of God what must we do to work the mighty works of God believe on him whom he hath sent the sermon Satan's Eden on the days of Jesus Satan he did the same thing remember how we talked about he poisoned every stream he poisoned their minds Again by deceit misinterpreting the word so the word had already been misinterpreted now he goes to the word and tries to misinterpret the word word to the word if thou be the Son of God now let me see you do something about it Jesus didn't clown for him he never did God is not a clown trying to remember the what do you call a guy who runs the circus guy in the Middle with a hat and the ring ring master I think we got too many ring Masters he don't have to answer anything that Satan asked Jesus said it is written man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God he didn't have to clown from him he didn't have to make bread he could have done it but he'd been listening to the devil so he didn't have to listen to the devil just imagine a ring Master here's a lion an elephant whatever Beast you want to use brother said one of the worst things you see is an animal caged up that Eagle in a cage of human Traditions Born to Fly but now he's just doing tricks with the ring Master with a whip said he didn't have to clown for the devil and again it is religious sin as at the beginning so deceitful watch it now it's not just purely old everyday sin committing adultery and getting drunk using God's name in vain that's not it you remember years ago many of you hear the old-timers remember the sermon I preached on the disappointments at judgment the Harlot she ain't going to be disappointed there she knows where she's going the drunker ain't going to be disappointed there The Bootlegger The Gambler the liar the thief he's not going to be disappointed but the that man who thinks he's right there's the disappointment that's that fellow that says come say Lord haven't I preached the gospel have not I cast out devils in thy name if he had stopped it haven't I preached the gospel that might have been a clue but then it's the the resume could you imagine just hypothetically if there was this test genuine believer stands there judgment and says uh doesn't look good and you just said I believed you with all my heart whatever you must Christ he says Ah just kidding get in there right but it's the guy that comes up there who didn't have that kind of heart who didn't believe it was believe plus it was the word plus he's kind of like what what are you serious I did all this for you yeah Blood Sweat tears and all sorts of meetings and all sorts of stuff signs and wonders fall and you're going to banish Me to Hell fine then I wouldn't want to spend eternity with you anyways right you're not going to accept my righteousness you're not going to accept my works but that attitude that says I did what you asked Lord I believed you that's all I could do the rest was left up to you if there was something wrong in my faith that was lacking forgive me Lord if you just let me Pat your foot just let me spend a moment in your presence just let me say thank you for the joy I had on Earth I'll be dearly paid let me fi finalize with this scripture just finish just want to read this and closing Brothers you could come to your instruments in John 8: 31-38 remember this then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the the truth and the truth shall make you free what's the first place they wanted to go we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou you shall be made free they went first to Natural lineage they could go to the genealogy they could go to the records they could go to the reports they could prove it we be Abraham seed after the flesh so how is it we're not free well really it's freedom from sin Freedom From The Curse freedom from those base instincts freedom from actually having to descend directly from Abraham right to be as the stars of Heaven the spiritual seed the Royal Seed of Abraham and he tells him I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin didn't matter what was in the flesh that wasn't What mattered in the end he said he that commits sin unbelief makes you a servant of unbelief yes and he says you want to kill me said the son in verse 36 if the sun therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed I know that you're Abraham's seed I say after the flesh but you want to kill me why because my word isn't found in you you might be able to produce DNA that says you are genuinely indeed circumcised son of Abraham but my word is not in you [Music] I'm I'm saying it forcefully I'm being very plain in how I'm preaching this and I would not want anyone for a second to lose their Liberty in Christ by becoming that a fanatic a license or legalist with any of this but to realize at the end of the day C it's the word Christ the word is what matters the most my faith is going to carry me through everything it's going to be what carries me through everything and there's this molting process there's this wearing down there's this suffering I thought about it brother Christian when you shared that with me earlier this week and how uh where his heart was at he's just sharing how the Lord uh he'd been list just listening to uh anointed ones at the end time and then that that contrasting image in the scripture where there's people that are so arrogant and so vindictive and say whatever they want about people but then there's some people who stood on faith alone and didn't couldn't defend themselves couldn't have didn't have the signs and wonders and all this Vindication that some people have they stood by faith alone and they suffer and you know it's that suffering that's mellowed them out and brought out the sweetness of Christ where when they see something even though it may be as black as night they're like oh my God be [Music] merciful because the word the word that faith in God's word that's what matters and I'll end I I'll end with this I didn't provide the quotation in a slide but brother brah in the sermon a trumpet gives an uncertain sound he says not nothing you try to do nothing you manufacture you can't manufacture you can't manufacture salvation you can't manufacture the gifts you got to Bear the gifts the Sheep doesn't manufacture wool he has wool because he's sheep he just Bears wool the cherry tree doesn't manufacture cherries it just Bears cherries because the life that's that of it's that way catch this it's the part that really drew me to this and the Church of the Living God doesn't inject this to try to make themselves look like something you don't have to be put peacock feathers in right you don't have to give the appearance you don't have to posture you don't have to puff up you don't have to try to make yourself look good you don't have to look like something they already they're already what they are by the gra of God and the word of God is joined with them and they're joined with the word and the works that was brought forth in that perfect one Jesus Christ God manifest In the Flesh will produce itself through every Born Again believer he said so amen nothing else that's something certain amen a certain sound those works that Christ did what what how did he how is his Works reduced to I do only that which the father commands me to do man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God that that's that's my work I must work the works of him that sent me while it's day that's my meat is to do his will and the bride she has the mind of Christ she has the same harmony with Christ the word because she's been joined to the word so she doesn't feel the need to step out beyond that to prove she's wife she already knows she knows and she's like I don't have to front right I I I don't have to try to pretend and it's almost as everybody's trying to flaunt and you don't have to because you don't have to clown you don't have to front for the devil you don't have to be like that's my man you can just stand on the word of God and know that he is yours you are his am you're his he is your beloved and you are his amen and rest in the Liberty that you have as his wife
