[0:00] On Sunday, we we're looking at the
[0:01] subject of crowns. And just to use some
[0:04] summary language so that we can uh kind
[0:07] of refresh that a little bit so we can
[0:10] be mindful of what those things were
[0:11] referring to. We know that there will be
[0:14] a day when crowns are handed out as a
[0:16] reward for good service, as a word for
[0:18] faithfulness. And these crowns are
[0:21] eternal rewards. It's how brother
[0:22] Brandham describes them. And we see even
[0:25] a scriptural term prize that is used.
[0:27] It's given as a prize to the believer
[0:29] who labors for Christ and labors
[0:31] correctly, labors lawfully. And a crown
[0:34] represents a reward. And in the
[0:37] scripture, we saw five different
[0:38] descriptions of crowns. Or some may say
[0:41] that it's five different ways of
[0:42] describing the same crown. But we could
[0:44] see it's something that's handed to the
[0:46] believer at the judgment seat of Christ
[0:49] as a time of examining works and
[0:51] attitude and behavior. And there's an
[0:53] incorruptible crown. There's a crown of
[0:55] life. There's the crown of
[0:56] righteousness, crown of rejoicing, and a
[0:58] crown of glory. We just saw all those
[1:00] different crowns referred to in the in
[1:02] the New Testament. And as brother
[1:04] Brandham used the phrase rewards
[1:06] available to the believer, I believe
[1:08] these crowns are part of those eternal
[1:10] rewards that are available for the
[1:12] believer to lay up and to store as the
[1:15] Bible says, lay up treasures in heaven.
[1:17] These crowns can be laid up by the
[1:19] believer's good attitude and good works.
[1:22] And it is at that bema or the judgment
[1:24] seat of Christ uh that we're we've been
[1:26] focusing on that day of reckoning. It's
[1:29] when we will see receive a new reward of
[1:32] honor and praise and glory and for a job
[1:34] well done and a recognition for faithful
[1:37] service. And we've been seeing a lot of
[1:39] these different uh principles in
[1:40] scripture. And if I could put it this
[1:42] way, maybe my what I'd want you to take
[1:45] away from these things is that God has
[1:48] given us things by his grace. And we
[1:50] want to use the gifts that God has given
[1:52] us by his grace uh to honor God. And in
[1:55] doing so, we're laying up treasures in
[1:56] heaven. If he gives us something and we
[1:58] just let it stay and we don't use it, we
[2:00] don't exercise the things that he's
[2:02] given us, then not only we not
[2:03] manifesting Christ here, we're missing
[2:05] out on an eternal benefit that we would
[2:07] otherwise get by representing Christ and
[2:10] reflecting Christ. And so it's by the
[2:12] exercise of his grace uh that we can
[2:14] live a life by the word and in living
[2:16] life by the word be rewarded for it. And
[2:19] so when we find that he gives us the
[2:20] power to do it and he's in us both the
[2:22] will and to do of his good pleasure and
[2:23] then we just yield to that power and we
[2:25] do it uh we're even more blessed to know
[2:27] that he wants to reward us for that when
[2:29] it's been him all along. And that's kind
[2:31] of the image of us even uh crowning him
[2:34] again knowing that it was always you
[2:36] Christ. This is this is your glory and
[2:38] this is your honor. And so those are
[2:40] just some of the principles we touched
[2:41] on Sunday on crowns. And so think of it
[2:44] the uh reward for service, being given a
[2:47] gift, being faithful with that gift. It
[2:48] speaks of faithfulness and stewardship.
[2:51] And we were using Luke chapter 19 um in
[2:54] that. We'll kind of start right there at
[2:56] this point, but tonight on the process,
[2:59] I'm going to be looking at the process
[3:00] of character development. I know that's
[3:02] maybe um a large phrase that would refer
[3:04] to a lot of different things. And it's
[3:07] in focusing on it in a way that if we
[3:09] recognize the process that we're in,
[3:12] then we can yield to that process and
[3:14] and not putting it selfishly or that we
[3:16] would get greedy, but uh if we recognize
[3:18] it and yield to it, there's a way that
[3:20] we can maximize our rewards by yielding
[3:22] to the process that God wants us to have
[3:25] uh wants us to be engaged in. And and
[3:28] these are maybe some things you could
[3:29] recognize as principles. As part of
[3:30] that, we're going to look at the role of
[3:31] suffering in our lives a and correction,
[3:34] how God corrects us and even the
[3:36] principle that we're being judged right
[3:37] now. There's a judgment being taken
[3:40] taken place now. So when we ended on in
[3:42] Sunday in Luke chapter 19, we saw Christ
[3:45] given the parable of a noble man uh who
[3:48] was who granted uh talents or pounds to
[3:51] his servants and had distributed talents
[3:52] to his uh pounds to his servants. And
[3:54] the servants then either used them or
[3:56] didn't use them to a certain limit or to
[3:58] a certain extent. And so the nobleman
[4:01] granted uh to those faithful servants
[4:03] who had by trading increased or made
[4:06] gain by those pounds, he granted to them
[4:08] rule over cities. So kind of catch that
[4:11] point that he granted to them rule over
[4:12] cities. And in Luke chapter 19:1 17 he
[4:15] said unto him, well thou good servant
[4:19] because thou hast been faithful in a
[4:20] very little have thou authority over 10
[4:24] cities. So we recognize that he was
[4:26] faithful over just a little bit but
[4:27] having demonstrated faithfulness over
[4:29] what he had received. Now there's an
[4:31] expansion once the nobleman returns
[4:34] having set up a new kingdom. He's going
[4:36] to expand the stewardship not just over
[4:38] the finances, not just over 10 pounds or
[4:41] five pounds or even one pound, but he's
[4:43] going to make him a ruler over cities.
[4:44] And I think there's a there's a direct
[4:46] application for us to recognize in that
[4:49] as we read from Matthew chap 21 25.
[4:53] His lord said unto him, well done, thou
[4:55] good and faithful servant. Thou hast
[4:57] been faithful over a few things. I will
[5:00] make thee ruler over many things. Enter
[5:02] thou into the joy of thy lord. So
[5:04] recognize again this faithfulness and
[5:07] because they were faithful with what God
[5:09] had committed to them, there was an
[5:10] expansion of this stewardship after this
[5:13] time of examining and judgment. And and
[5:15] I don't believe I'm hiding this
[5:17] principle at all from you, but I do
[5:19] believe that as the bride, we will rule
[5:21] and reign with him in the millennium.
[5:22] And there'll be stewardships given out.
[5:24] And you as a believer will have a role
[5:26] of binding sin and ruling and reigning
[5:29] in the millennium. and Satan having no
[5:31] one to work through because of your your
[5:33] character and your leadership. And I
[5:35] believe that there is an important part
[5:37] that this plays, this process of
[5:38] character development plays in terms of
[5:40] what our stewardship is going to be
[5:41] like, not only in the millennium, but
[5:43] those eternal rewards and that praise
[5:45] and that glory and that honor that we'll
[5:47] carry with us through all eternity. And
[5:49] so Luke 16:es
[5:52] 10 to 12, it says, "He that is faithful
[5:54] in that which is least is faithful also
[5:56] in much. And he that is unjust in the
[5:59] least is unjust also in much. If
[6:02] therefore you have not been faithful in
[6:05] the unrighteous mammon, who will commit
[6:07] to your trust the true riches? So
[6:09] there's the principle being elicited
[6:11] again. We referred to it in Luke 19,
[6:13] Matthew 25. If you're faithful in
[6:16] little, it demonstrates a character to
[6:19] be able to be faithful in much. He says,
[6:20] "But if you're unfaithful in just a
[6:22] little bit, if you're unjust in a little
[6:24] bit, don't think that just because we
[6:25] give you more or I give you more that
[6:27] that's going to trigger faithfulness,
[6:29] it's going to trigger a stewardship and
[6:31] a fidelity." It's saying, "No, you can
[6:33] tell by how a man handles his
[6:34] responsibilities with a little what
[6:36] he'll do with a lot." That's why
[6:39] sometimes we think that all we need is a
[6:41] more money to solve our problems. uh but
[6:43] we only make more problems with more
[6:45] money because it's not so much the lack
[6:47] of money, it's the lack of wisdom and
[6:49] discipline and financial uh uh uh
[6:51] restraint in those things. So now verse
[6:54] 11, this is to me just a a mouthful
[6:57] because there's so much that's meant in
[6:59] this. If you've not been faithful in the
[7:01] unrighteous mammon, now there's a lot of
[7:03] ways that maybe we could try to divide
[7:05] that and place that. But what Christ is
[7:07] looking at is if you can't be faithful
[7:09] with the natural affairs of life and the
[7:11] things that you're blessed with in this
[7:12] life, if you can't be faithful even
[7:14] temporal things in this life, who will
[7:17] commit to your trust the true riches?
[7:20] If if there's things that we receive now
[7:22] and we have stewardship over now and we
[7:24] can't be faithful in it, then who's
[7:25] going to trust you with things that are
[7:27] permanent and things that have no end?
[7:29] He says, "And if you're not," if he says
[7:30] in verse 12, "and if you have not been
[7:32] faithful in that which is another man's,
[7:35] who shall give you that which is your
[7:37] own?" Now, there's a there's an image
[7:40] here that would that would refer to some
[7:43] things that maybe we'll get in later
[7:45] that if I give you responsibility over
[7:47] something that I own and therefore
[7:49] you're a steward, uh you're you're
[7:51] governing in thestead of somebody else.
[7:52] And so these are my and I give them to
[7:55] you to exercise and to have and to use
[7:57] and you're using it on my authority. So
[8:00] there's been something conveyed to you.
[8:01] You're in thatstead. You're in that you
[8:03] have that post of duty, that fiduciary
[8:05] duty. And if you haven't been faithful
[8:07] over that which is somebody else's
[8:08] saying, then why would I give you
[8:10] something for yourself that you would
[8:12] own your have of yourself and that you
[8:14] would would be your very own? Because if
[8:16] you can't rule over what someone else's
[8:19] property, then how are you going to
[8:20] treat your own?
[8:22] I know that's backwards thinking for a
[8:23] lot of us who are like, "Hey, it's just
[8:24] a rental. We can go off-roading a and
[8:26] it's not mine. I'm gambling with
[8:28] somebody else's chips. We're a little
[8:29] bit more reckless and we kind of play
[8:31] fast and loose if we don't have any skin
[8:33] in the game." But actually, character is
[8:35] the opposite. In other words, that if
[8:37] somebody's trusted you with something
[8:38] that you ought to care for that in the
[8:40] same way that you would your own, if not
[8:42] more. Because Jesus is saying, if you
[8:44] can't be a steward over somebody else's
[8:47] gifts and properties and fulfill the
[8:49] role and responsibility that someone has
[8:51] given you to finish their work, then how
[8:53] can we give you something that is your
[8:55] very own?
[8:56] If you can't handle authority, how are
[8:58] you ever going to handle power?
[9:00] Right? If you can't, if you don't know
[9:01] how to exercise authority properly, if
[9:03] you don't know how to live humbly and
[9:05] use certain things the correct way, then
[9:07] why would I ever empower you and give
[9:09] you more power or allow you to even rule
[9:11] in mystead completely if you didn't know
[9:13] how to be an ambassador of me and handle
[9:16] affairs correctly?
[9:18] Can you can answer individually to this?
[9:20] Uh is that you kind of catching what
[9:22] Jesus is saying there?
[9:24] And so when Jesus is saying that uh
[9:27] you've done well faithful servant and
[9:29] now I'm going to reward you with
[9:30] authority over 10 cities. You've been
[9:32] faithful over a few things. I'm going to
[9:34] make you rule over many things. If I
[9:36] could put it this way, the rewards were
[9:37] proportional to the character uh that
[9:40] had been developed and demonstrated
[9:43] that there was something that they had
[9:44] there was some trust that was given to
[9:46] them and there there was something that
[9:48] came to the surface and was demonstrated
[9:51] in their faithfulness over what they had
[9:52] given enough to where this ruler can now
[9:54] say you have there's been the right kind
[9:56] of character developed within you and
[9:59] demonstrated so that I can trust you
[10:00] with more. And for us also, God has a
[10:04] process uh to develop Christlike
[10:07] character in us. And that as we go
[10:09] through that process and we display and
[10:11] manifest Christlike character, there's a
[10:13] reward for those who endure the process
[10:16] and manifest his character.
[10:18] And as we step forward into these verses
[10:21] and some of these scriptures here, the I
[10:24] want you to think as we go through these
[10:26] familiar scriptures and these very
[10:28] familiar principles. And as we do it,
[10:31] consider uh the subject that we've been
[10:33] on, how there's a promise of a reward at
[10:36] the end because these is what I'm
[10:38] talking about is perfection. Uh your
[10:40] suffering, you have to suffer to have
[10:42] your character perfected uh and being
[10:44] fit to rules. These are principles that
[10:45] I know all of you know very very well.
[10:47] They've been taught been ministered on
[10:48] very effectively. These are principles I
[10:50] think that are very clear in the message
[10:52] of the hour. And so these are things
[10:53] that we know and understand, but I'm
[10:55] wanting you to think about them in light
[10:56] of the things that we've been preaching
[10:58] on because I think it helps you
[10:59] understand better what it is that God
[11:02] what the whole process is for. Because I
[11:04] know there's times said, "I've been
[11:05] suffering. I'm suffering. I've been
[11:07] suffering. I've been suffering. And I'm
[11:08] I'm looking for the payout. I'm looking
[11:10] for the reward." And and there's rewards
[11:12] we receive in this life. And he even
[11:14] said a hundfold in this life and in the
[11:16] life to come. But there's things that
[11:18] also are going to manifest on that day
[11:20] when all things are brought to light and
[11:21] works are tried as if by fire. And so
[11:24] there's a payoff coming for sure. Even
[11:27] if you don't feel that you have it in
[11:28] this life, if you can understand the
[11:29] process, you know it's all going to be
[11:30] worth it. So really consider these
[11:32] scriptures deeply as we refer to very
[11:34] familiar things. But now start thinking
[11:37] about what application it could have on
[11:39] that day of reckoning when my life is
[11:41] going to be examined to determine the
[11:42] extent of my reward. and Romans chapter
[11:45] 8:1 17. These are um very broad
[11:50] principles that we're bringing out of
[11:51] the scripture here, but he's talking
[11:53] about the believer, those that are
[11:54] filled the Holy Ghost, and of children,
[11:56] then heirs. And I I love this principle
[11:58] of being an heir because it speaks of
[12:00] relationship and some sort of promise
[12:02] that you would inherit something by
[12:04] virtue of that relationship and by
[12:06] covenant and by will or testament. And
[12:09] of children, then heirs, heirs of God
[12:11] and joint heirs with Christ. So, we
[12:14] stand in this place to receive jointly
[12:17] with Christ what he receives. But then
[12:19] Paul kind of throws in there a little
[12:22] bit of qualifying language as if if this
[12:24] was a a contract or if this was a
[12:26] covenant in a person's will or
[12:28] testament, then this would have some
[12:30] weight. You know, maybe to the the
[12:31] executive would have to weigh this and
[12:33] say, "Well, they're a joint heir and
[12:34] they stand to receive an inheritance
[12:36] because they're an heir of God." But it
[12:38] says, "If so be that we suffer with
[12:40] him." And so it kind of throws in this
[12:43] clause that really we're not going to
[12:45] inherit or receive this unless we
[12:48] suffer. So if you're an heir of God and
[12:50] a joint heir with Christ, God has some
[12:52] sort of requirements that he places on
[12:55] how you receive that inheritance fully.
[12:57] In other words, we will gain the full
[12:58] inheritance if we suffer. And then it
[13:01] says that we may also, so we have to
[13:02] suffer that we may also be glorified
[13:05] together. And so that glory that we're
[13:08] to receive is reflective of the
[13:11] suffering that we endure. This is kind
[13:13] of this is forwardlooking that we're
[13:15] joint hes and we stand to receive
[13:17] everything in Christ at some time and at
[13:19] some moment especially as we look that
[13:21] this life isn't the totality of it. I
[13:24] know there's a lot to be said about the
[13:25] gifts that he's given men and the way
[13:27] that he manifests himself and the power
[13:28] over sin, the world, the flesh, the
[13:30] devil. And these are all things that
[13:31] manifest themselves in this life, but
[13:33] this is short period of time, right?
[13:36] This is just a little hickey that drops
[13:37] down. This is a this is a we're not
[13:39] living this life for this life. We're
[13:41] living for the life to come. And so,
[13:43] there's so much that pertains to that
[13:45] eternal glory. And so, we have to suffer
[13:47] in order to be glorified together with
[13:49] Christ. And so we know that God has
[13:52] ordained suffering
[13:54] to bring us to completion.
[13:57] So he's he's ordained the use of
[13:58] suffering. I know it would be awesome if
[14:00] he was ordaining the use of rest or
[14:02] vacation. Uh he was you using the the
[14:05] sleep. Wouldn't it be awesome if he was
[14:07] using sleep uh uh you know to to perfect
[14:10] us? And it seems that anymore any
[14:12] ailment or problem that you read about
[14:14] today say, "Well, I have this problem. I
[14:15] have this ache. I have this. I have
[14:17] this." that the number one thing is you
[14:18] be sure you're getting enough sleep,
[14:20] right? And so in the natural that's so,
[14:22] but with God, he doesn't use the suff he
[14:24] uses suffering as the means of
[14:26] perfecting or completing us. And when we
[14:29] think of perfection or completion, I
[14:31] know there's maybe a lot that we we
[14:33] start to think, well, I just need to be
[14:34] sinless like Christ, but I think it's
[14:36] important for us to think that I want to
[14:37] be pleasing to God as Christ was
[14:39] pleasing to God. And then also in terms
[14:41] of completion and filling up something,
[14:43] think of potential as it would relate to
[14:45] what John said that we receive a full
[14:47] reward. That if I can get a hundfold,
[14:51] that's what I want. I want a hundfold.
[14:53] And Paul touches on this to the
[14:55] Corinthians. 2 Corinthians chapter 4:1
[14:57] 17. For our light affliction, which is
[15:00] but for a moment, workketh for us a far
[15:03] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[15:06] glory. Now, how is it this is so? Well,
[15:09] Paul is recognizing that what we endure
[15:12] here, and I believe that his qualifying
[15:13] language is just to kind of get our
[15:15] attention. Hey, no matter what you GO
[15:17] THROUGH HERE, LIGHT light affliction,
[15:19] it's just for a moment, but whatever we
[15:22] endure here as a believer, as Peter puts
[15:24] it, that we suffer, and I think this is
[15:26] an important principle that we probably
[15:27] could have uh spent some time on, that
[15:29] we suffer according to the will of God.
[15:32] uh we don't want to suffer fighting the
[15:34] will of God and suffer because we're not
[15:35] in his will and then claim that that
[15:37] somehow I'm just trying to hasten my
[15:40] perfecting. No, you're you're making it
[15:42] harder on yourself and you're delaying
[15:45] your completion. You're delaying your
[15:46] reward. You're delaying your perfection.
[15:48] But if we suffer according to the will
[15:50] of God, he calls it light affliction
[15:52] which is temporary but for a moment. But
[15:54] this affliction is working for us a far
[15:56] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[16:00] glory. Uh notice how that it's
[16:03] suggesting that if you if you're
[16:04] suffering to a certain measure, it's
[16:07] it's it's producing a certain weight.
[16:09] So that we suffer here, but there's a
[16:12] byproduct or there's something that
[16:14] comes out of that and it's a a far more
[16:16] exceeding great weight of glory. So I
[16:20] I'd like to use use the the language
[16:22] that it's somewhat our suffering is
[16:24] proportional or has a direct impact on
[16:27] the increase of the glory, the praise
[16:29] and the honor that we're going to share.
[16:32] Brother Van touches on that when he says
[16:34] now if God is going to give a reward to
[16:37] somebody who you gives a glass of water,
[16:39] how much greater is that reward and
[16:42] praise going to be for those who gave
[16:43] their lives?
[16:44] Amen.
[16:44] Right? So that that helps us to
[16:46] understand that there's some sort of
[16:47] spectrum of honor. there's some sort of
[16:48] spectrum of glory in praise that's going
[16:51] to be given to those who labor for him.
[16:53] And so here he says that there's the
[16:55] suffering that we're going through is
[16:57] working out a more exceeding and eternal
[17:00] weight of glory. As we could have read
[17:02] in Romans 8:18, the scripture tells us
[17:05] that our pray present sufferings can't
[17:07] compare to the glory that is we're going
[17:10] to our future glory. Uh Romans 8:18,
[17:13] think about that. that the suffering of
[17:14] this present time is not worthy to be
[17:16] compared to the future glory that you're
[17:18] going to receive. This future praise and
[17:20] the future honor that you're going to
[17:22] receive. So there's a there's a
[17:24] suffering that we have to have in order
[17:26] to be we're joint hes and there's a
[17:29] suffering that's going to determine the
[17:30] extent of our glory.
[17:33] And as it we we're reading in Luke
[17:35] chapter 19, in Matthew chapter 25, as
[17:38] the nobleman was extending stewardship
[17:40] to those who demonstrated faithfulness,
[17:42] he says,"I'll give you rule over these
[17:44] cities." In 2 Timothy chapter 2:12, it
[17:47] has this application to us because
[17:49] Timothy says, "If we suffer, we shall
[17:51] also reign with him."
[17:53] And so one of the prerequisites to being
[17:55] able to rule properly in order to reign
[17:57] with him and to exercise further
[17:59] dominion and there's a there's a direct
[18:01] application to this life as you
[18:03] demonstrate faithfulness in this life,
[18:05] God will expand your stewardship. But
[18:06] there's also this reflection in this
[18:08] eternal life that if we suffer, we shall
[18:11] reign with him. That there's a place
[18:13] that we can hold in Christ that's
[18:15] proportional to the suffering that we
[18:16] had. And the church age book, Brother
[18:19] Bam writes this in the Smyrnian age. He
[18:21] says, "Unless we suffer with him, we
[18:22] cannot reign with him." You have to
[18:25] suffer to reign. And as I'm already
[18:27] pointed out, these are very familiar
[18:29] principles, but now we're thinking about
[18:30] it in terms of the promise of a reward
[18:33] at the end for this suffering. Not so
[18:36] much the character that's expressed in
[18:38] this life, but the reward for that
[18:40] character. Says the reason for this is
[18:42] that character simply is never made
[18:43] without suffering. Character is a
[18:46] victory, not a gift. So he's not going
[18:48] to give us character as a reward. He's
[18:51] going to put us through something. We're
[18:53] going to earn that and win that
[18:54] character and then God's going to reward
[18:56] that character. A man without character
[18:59] cannot reign because power apart from
[19:01] character is satanic. But power with
[19:04] character is fit to rule. So if we have
[19:08] character which is fit to rule, that's
[19:09] what God can empower. character that's
[19:12] fit to rule is not even necessarily
[19:14] being tested or tried with authority,
[19:16] but is actually being granted explicit
[19:18] power to use fully. Why? Because it can
[19:20] be trusted. And since he wants to share
[19:23] even his throne on the same basis that
[19:26] he overcame and is sat down in his
[19:28] father's throne, then we have to
[19:30] overcome to sit with him. [snorts] And
[19:32] the little temporary sufferings we go
[19:34] through now is not worthy to be compared
[19:38] to the tremendous glory that will be
[19:40] revealed in us when he comes. Now that
[19:43] phrase is it's pulling from 2
[19:45] Corinthians 4. It's pulling from Romans
[19:47] 8:18. This light affliction, this
[19:49] suffering is not worthy to be compared
[19:52] to the tremendous glory that's going to
[19:54] be revealed in us. And when he says when
[19:55] he comes, I believe that we can look at
[19:57] that in light of this moment when
[19:59] everything's going to be brought to
[20:00] light and our works going to be tried as
[20:02] if it is by fire. And that that's when
[20:04] we're going to have praise of God.
[20:06] That's when we're going to have uh a uh
[20:08] you know accommodation and saying, "Oh,
[20:10] way to go and you've done well and and
[20:12] you deserve this because notice his next
[20:14] phrase. All what treasures are laid up
[20:16] for those who are willing to enter into
[20:18] his kingdom through much tribulation."
[20:20] So now there's a direct connection to
[20:22] this suffering and this glory which is
[20:24] going to be revealed and the treasures
[20:26] that are laid up for us. He's using this
[20:28] language explicitly in the church age
[20:29] book. Oh, there's treasures that we
[20:31] ought to lay up and we ought to be
[20:33] laboring for these treasures and we
[20:34] should be earning these eternal rewards
[20:36] of God and spending more time on earning
[20:39] these eternal rewards that are available
[20:40] to the believer. Oh, how we ought to lay
[20:43] up treasures in heaven that are
[20:44] available to the faithful saints. And
[20:46] he's saying that if we suffer in this
[20:48] life, it's not worthy to compare to the
[20:50] glory that's going to be revealed when
[20:52] he comes. And he's he refers to the
[20:54] treasures that are laid up for those who
[20:56] are willing to endure tribulation. So
[20:59] he's making a direct connection then to
[21:01] the the process of character development
[21:03] here because as we suffer, there are
[21:05] certain things that are being brought
[21:06] out of us and how there's going to be a
[21:08] reward at the end.
[21:10] In 1 Peter chapter 1:es 6 and 7, wherein
[21:13] ye greatly rejoice, though now for a
[21:16] season if need be, ye are in heaviness
[21:18] through manifold temptations, through uh
[21:21] many different uh trials and afflictions
[21:23] and many different uh testings and
[21:25] scourgings. He says right now you might
[21:27] be for a season heavy through all these
[21:30] temptations and these trials that you're
[21:32] going through. Says that the trial of
[21:33] your faith being much more precious than
[21:36] than of gold that perisheth. And and
[21:39] what what is it we can learn from this?
[21:40] That our faith is more precious than
[21:42] gold. It being a gift of God. And so
[21:45] that faith is more precious than gold.
[21:47] And the trial of it is more precious
[21:49] than gold. He says that the fiery So he
[21:52] says that the trial of your faith being
[21:53] much more precious than of gold that
[21:55] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[21:57] might be found under praise and honor
[22:00] and glory when at the appearing of Jesus
[22:02] Christ. And so it's the same scene. We
[22:05] can look at this in the same scene that
[22:07] though I may be enduring things now and
[22:08] I'm suffering now through many temp uh
[22:10] temptations and I'm going through this
[22:13] testing the trial of my faith the
[22:15] testing of my faith the pushing against
[22:17] my faith the fact that I'm having to use
[22:19] my faith to press against things he says
[22:22] that's much more precious than gold that
[22:23] perisheth though it may be tried with
[22:25] fire but it's going to be found UNTO
[22:27] PRAISE HONOR AND GLORY WHAT IS YOUR
[22:30] faith
[22:31] is going to be found is going to be
[22:32] honored IS GOING TO BE PRAISED and it's
[22:34] going to receive glory at the appearing
[22:36] of Jesus Christ has its perfect
[22:39] fulfillment in that day when we meet him
[22:41] in the air and we see him in all his
[22:43] glory and we're GOING TO BE EXAMINED BY
[22:45] THAT GLORY AND JUDGED BY THAT GLORY THAT
[22:47] WHATEVER can match and whatever is
[22:49] commiserate with his GLORY THERE'S A
[22:50] REWARD FOR THAT. SO WE WANT TO ENDURE
[22:52] and to suffer and GO THROUGH THE TRIAL
[22:54] BECAUSE ONE DAY HE'S going to see his
[22:56] glory in us and there's going to be
[22:57] honor going to be praise and glory given
[23:00] to it. How did brother Ram describe it?
[23:02] The gold of God is Christlike character
[23:06] produced in the fiery furnace of
[23:07] affliction.
[23:08] Amen.
[23:09] That's the gold of God. The gold of God
[23:10] that he wants to see that we want to
[23:12] present to him on that day is a
[23:14] Christlike character that's produced in
[23:16] the fiery furnace of affliction. Now,
[23:19] this might be a good time to say this. I
[23:21] think it might uh it might be good to go
[23:22] on maybe a 67-p part series on this. But
[23:26] sometimes we think suffering just means,
[23:27] you know, getting whipped with lashes,
[23:29] you know, having uh being beat or cussed
[23:31] at or, you know, we think suffering
[23:33] maybe has this direct application to
[23:35] physical pain. But you can suffer just
[23:38] by doing what you know is the right
[23:40] thing against your own carnal attitude
[23:43] or your will to do it.
[23:45] Right? when you when you hear the word
[23:46] say, "Hey, instead of inviting the cool
[23:48] kids over for lunch, why do you invite
[23:50] the other people over for lunch?" Like,
[23:51] I don't really want to hang out with the
[23:53] other people, right? But you know it's
[23:55] the right thing to do. There's suffering
[23:57] in that. So suffering and affliction
[24:00] sometimes I mean is we I think we think
[24:02] about being scourged or being burned at
[24:03] the stake, but there's a lot of
[24:04] suffering that we can do daily for
[24:07] Christ that can be summed up as
[24:09] subjecting our will to his.
[24:13] Paul called it, I bring my body under
[24:14] subjection. That's a suffering. That's a
[24:16] beating. He even called it that. I
[24:18] buffet it. I I restrain it. I cause it
[24:21] to suffer and and I and I bring it
[24:22] subject to the will of God. So keep that
[24:24] in mind lest we kind of miss the the the
[24:27] real the real meat of this application
[24:29] tonight. So now in 1 Peter chapter 4, as
[24:32] he revisits this subject again, verses
[24:34] 12 and 13, he says, "Beloved, think it
[24:36] not strange concerning the fiery trial
[24:38] which is to try you as though some
[24:40] strange thing happened unto you." So if
[24:42] there's a trial, if there's a suffering,
[24:44] if there's a testing, we shouldn't be
[24:45] like, "Oh my goodness, what's happening?
[24:47] Why is this taking place?" HE SAYS,
[24:48] "DON'T think it's strange that there's a
[24:50] fiery trial trying you and trying your
[24:53] faith." He says, "But rejoice. And why
[24:55] should we rejoice in the face of
[24:57] temptation and trial and affliction in
[24:59] so much as you're partakers of Christ's
[25:01] SUFFERINGS THAT HE SUFFERED LIKEWISE,
[25:03] just as you are suffering, and were
[25:05] partakers together with it." And he says
[25:07] THAT WHEN HIS GLORY SHALL BE REVEALED,
[25:10] ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
[25:13] Now why is it that Paul Peter is
[25:16] expressing it this way? That when you
[25:18] suffer, take it gladly. Be happy when
[25:20] you suffer. Don't be shocked or
[25:21] surprised, but realize that you are
[25:24] suffering just as Christ suffered. So
[25:26] that when his glory is revealed, when
[25:28] there's going to be this meeting in the
[25:30] air, when we are going to be judged in
[25:32] the light of his glory, you will find
[25:34] yourself not ashamed and glad with
[25:36] exceeding joy because you can
[25:39] demonstrate and show this gold, the
[25:42] Christlike character of Christ, which is
[25:45] then going to be rewarded. And that's
[25:47] why you would be glad with exceeding
[25:48] glory joy. What he's referring to here
[25:51] is not merely the joy at seeing him
[25:52] revealed, but the lack of shame at that
[25:55] time of revealing that I have fought a
[25:57] good fight. I finished my course. I
[25:59] suffered well. I I've demonstrated
[26:00] faithfulness and fiduciary uh duties.
[26:03] And I and I've done what I ought to have
[26:04] done. And you know that it's going to be
[26:05] to honor, glory, and praise.
[26:08] Can you see that? Just a just another uh
[26:11] light on these scriptures to see this
[26:13] application at this time of judging.
[26:21] Now, in John chapter 15, verse 16, and I
[26:24] I don't think that we're making a hard
[26:26] right here, but I think we're just
[26:27] taking a little bit of a turn
[26:30] and just not just sure wasn't sure just
[26:33] how to approach it except just to kind
[26:35] of uh you know, jerk the steering wheel
[26:37] and make the turn at 80 miles an hour.
[26:39] Uh it's it's rated for 80, so we're
[26:41] fine. But so keep that in mind how this
[26:44] suffering and I hope you're able to just
[26:46] kind of see these building blocks. If
[26:47] you've been taking notes, maybe you have
[26:48] a way just to kind of go back and track
[26:50] over it again. But there's a there's a
[26:53] crown to be given. There's rewards to be
[26:55] won. There's this image in scripture
[26:58] that those who are faithful in this life
[26:59] are going to receive ruler authority and
[27:02] rule or power and rule in the future and
[27:04] future rewards are going to be given
[27:05] out. And it's going to be given out
[27:07] based upon your character, your measure
[27:09] of character. And so there's suffering
[27:11] that we to undergo in order to produce
[27:13] the character. And then the Bible is
[27:14] telling us that not only do we have
[27:17] character that's demonstrated here as a
[27:18] result of our suffering that God rewards
[27:20] demonstrated character,
[27:22] right? There's going to be this beam at
[27:23] this judgment seat of Christ when God
[27:25] rewards us for our faithful service. And
[27:27] there that's when there's going to be
[27:28] exceeding joy and there's going to be uh
[27:30] praise and honor and glory. A and we're
[27:32] going to reign with him because we
[27:34] suffered with him. So we see those
[27:35] points. I trust. Now in John chapter
[27:37] 15:16
[27:39] says, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have
[27:41] chosen you." His election and
[27:43] predestination are so important to never
[27:46] lose sight of that lest we would ever
[27:48] brag or boast about anything, we'd
[27:50] realize it's him that has chosen us. And
[27:52] not only has he elected us to be born
[27:53] again, but he's also predestinated us to
[27:56] a particular destiny and then made
[27:57] available to us many different glories
[28:00] pertaining to that. And so it's all by
[28:02] his grace. You have not chosen me, but
[28:04] I've chosen you and ordained you. So
[28:06] there's an ordination in our life and
[28:07] with an ordination there's a
[28:09] responsibility there's a calling there
[28:11] there is a responsibility that we have
[28:13] to measure up to and this is it that you
[28:16] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[28:19] your fruit should remain. I believe that
[28:21] this is a good scripture to keep in mind
[28:24] of those who build with wood hay and
[28:25] stubble and if it's tried as if by fire
[28:27] wood and stubble does not remain but
[28:29] this gold is silver and the precious
[28:31] metals these precious jewels are the
[28:33] ones that will be tested by fire and
[28:35] remain. That's the fruit that remains
[28:37] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[28:38] father in my name, he may give it to
[28:40] you. So it is God's will and I I love to
[28:43] think of it this way that that what
[28:45] we're that God is wanting to bless you.
[28:47] God wants to give it just even when it
[28:49] comes to the Holy Ghost, he wants to
[28:50] give it to you more than you want it.
[28:51] So God is not like our insurance
[28:53] companies that let us pay them thousands
[28:57] of dollars a year so that we can have
[28:59] insurance and then whenever we need to
[29:01] get coverage, they're like, "Yeah,
[29:03] sorry. It's not covered on Saturdays.
[29:05] You know, you should have read the fine
[29:06] print. Oh, you bought you bought car
[29:09] insurance, but you're driving a truck.
[29:11] You're like, "Wait a minute." Right? So,
[29:13] there's that's how the that's how we
[29:15] feel that we deal with the world. It
[29:16] says, "Hey, man, we get we get the sweep
[29:18] stakes in the mail and it says you've
[29:19] won a million dollars and we sit our
[29:21] family down like you're not going to
[29:22] believe it. We just want a brand new
[29:23] house. We want a sweep stakes." And then
[29:25] there's all this kind of fine print,
[29:26] right? And and there's all these things
[29:28] and basically at the end of the day,
[29:29] you're not getting anything. BUT GOD'S
[29:30] NOT LIKE THAT. God isn't dangling a
[29:33] carrot. God isn't promising you glory.
[29:34] God isn't promising rewards and then
[29:36] he's kind of hoping that you haven't
[29:37] figured it out how to do it. No, he's
[29:39] given you every resource and tool
[29:41] available saying I want to bless you.
[29:44] In other words, I've ordained for you to
[29:46] hundfold. There's this there up to let's
[29:48] just say if there was a percentage that
[29:50] I've got all this I want to give you and
[29:52] I want you to get 100% of it. So it's
[29:54] God's will for us to be fruitful, to
[29:56] grow in grace and character so that we
[29:58] can be fit to rule. And he wants us to
[30:01] do that.
[30:02] And so Jesus had said already in verse
[30:05] two of the same chapter, every branch in
[30:06] me that beareth not fruit, he taketh
[30:08] away. So think of this beautiful image.
[30:10] He's chosen us and ordained us to be
[30:13] fruitful and that our fruit would
[30:14] remain. So there's this healthy
[30:16] production of fruit and this fruit
[30:17] remains. And he says, "Every branch that
[30:19] beareth not fruit, he takes away. And
[30:21] every branch that beareth fruit, notice,
[30:23] he purgth it that it may bring forth
[30:26] more fruit.
[30:27] Amen.
[30:27] So if you are a fruitful branch, God
[30:29] likes to work with you a little bit
[30:31] more.
[30:32] He likes to he likes to purge. He likes
[30:34] to prune. He likes to do certain things
[30:36] to kind of shock it and and and to and
[30:38] to see that it produces more fruit and
[30:40] that it it brings forth. And someone
[30:41] who's an arborist and knows how to deal
[30:43] with certain fruit trees, there's things
[30:45] you have to do sometime to provoke the
[30:46] life, to get it to come out. There's
[30:48] things that you must be doing to certain
[30:50] trees to see that they're growing. And
[30:51] Christ is using this image that if you
[30:53] are fruitful, THAT MEANS YOU'VE GOT THE
[30:55] POTENTIAL. YOU'VE GOT THE LIFE INSIDE of
[30:57] you. It's in you to bring forth fruit.
[30:59] And maybe you're bringing forth some
[31:00] fruit, but he says, "I've got to purge
[31:02] it and prune it a little bit so it CAN
[31:04] BRING FORTH MORE FRUIT."
[31:06] So God purges and prunes and he digs and
[31:09] he dungs and other scriptures. You can
[31:10] see he works with the tree so it brings
[31:12] forth fruit. And he does this because he
[31:14] desires to see a harvest of his
[31:16] character in you,
[31:17] right?
[31:18] He's he listen, he just doesn't give you
[31:19] the Holy Ghost. He says, "Now I'm just
[31:20] going to go over and I'm just going to
[31:22] watch.
[31:23] I'm just going to see how it turns out.
[31:24] I'm just going to see how you do." He's
[31:26] involved.
[31:27] He's active in the process. He's
[31:29] available whenever you want to ask him
[31:30] for his help. He's there to speak to you
[31:32] and give you wisdom and to help you in
[31:34] all many different ways. And as we grow
[31:36] and mature, there's times where we
[31:38] really really want him just to do
[31:39] something. He's like, "No, I brought you
[31:40] this far. You know what to do. you just
[31:42] need to do it. But God is always there
[31:44] with us.
[31:46] He wants us to succeed. He wants to see
[31:48] this harvest of the character of Christ
[31:50] inside of us. Brother Bam said, "God's
[31:52] will for us is perfection." And that
[31:55] perfection is patience, waiting on God
[31:57] and waiting for God. This is the process
[32:00] of character development.
[32:03] So, what I'm wanting to kind of tie in
[32:04] at this point is how that we we are in
[32:07] this process of character development.
[32:10] And I I know I'm just using I I
[32:14] I'm reluctant to use phrases and
[32:16] paradigms that we get very rigid with
[32:18] that structure and and this that's all
[32:19] we ever can call it now is the process
[32:21] of character development. No, it's just
[32:22] a framework to try to understand God and
[32:24] how he deals with us. And I think using
[32:26] this as brother Brand calls it the
[32:28] process of character development is
[32:30] bringing forth bringing us to completion
[32:32] or perfection. And so under this
[32:34] process, we're our character, we suffer
[32:38] and it produces character. And and I
[32:40] want us to think how at the end there's
[32:41] a glory that's going to come for that.
[32:43] There's a glory that comes for that. But
[32:44] now as we look at how God wants us to be
[32:47] fruitful and bring forth Christlike
[32:48] character that this suffering also has
[32:50] the component of correction with it.
[32:53] This purging that God purges and uh that
[32:55] every tree that is fruitful and that's
[32:58] God's will for us. And this process of
[33:00] character development requires
[33:01] correction. And a lot more time could be
[33:03] spent on this than just what we're given
[33:04] it on a Wednesday night. But I think
[33:06] there's a lot that we understand
[33:07] already. So we can just plug this into
[33:08] our understanding already. Says in
[33:10] Revelations 3:19, "As many as I love, I
[33:13] rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore
[33:16] and repent." Amen.
[33:18] And even on this subject, if I could say
[33:19] this on this subject of suffering for
[33:22] perfection and suffering that our
[33:24] character would be made perfect. And our
[33:27] character is a g is is not a gift. It's
[33:30] a victory. And I know that you might be
[33:31] saying that has got to be the 1,767th
[33:35] time that I've heard that read in a
[33:37] message church. And you know, that's
[33:39] great. You're keeping track. That's
[33:40] amazing. Those are pretty good data
[33:42] skills, right? But you know, there's
[33:44] people sitting here tonight, young
[33:46] people, that it's maybe never
[33:47] registered.
[33:49] And and there there's a time and a
[33:50] season when these things h they click
[33:52] and they make sense. And I don't know
[33:53] how many times it's happened in your
[33:55] life and how many times it happens to
[33:56] other ministers. Uh but there's things
[33:58] that will be preached and it's not going
[34:00] to and you preached to you and preached
[34:02] to and preached to you and then it's
[34:03] preached one more time by somebody else
[34:05] from a different angle and you're like,
[34:06] I wish I would have heard that years
[34:08] ago, right? And it's as if you'd never
[34:11] heard it before. And you know, there
[34:12] shouldn't be any there's no offense in
[34:14] that. Nobody should take that take, you
[34:16] know, feel like, oh, no, NO, NO, NO. I
[34:18] PREACHED THAT BEFORE. I PREACHED THAT
[34:19] BEFORE. NO, NO, you didn't. You didn't.
[34:21] It was different that time, right?
[34:23] Because it met the need in the moment
[34:24] that they were in. So, I know that these
[34:26] are things that were as mature
[34:28] believers, we know very, very well. I'm
[34:30] wanting just to put a light on it in the
[34:32] perspective of these rewards that are
[34:34] coming. And I think that's helpful
[34:35] because it puts more perspective to
[34:37] these uh to these things that we go
[34:39] through. But on this process of
[34:41] character development, correction,
[34:42] Revelations 3:19, and as many as I love,
[34:45] remember I have chosen you, you haven't
[34:46] chosen me. That choosing is an act of
[34:48] love. As many as I love, I rebuke and
[34:51] chasen. Be zealous, therefore, and
[34:53] repent. Now, it's important to bring
[34:55] this in now because we spent a lot of
[34:57] time talking about there is no
[34:58] condemnation.
[35:00] That there is going to be a judgment of
[35:02] our works, but in it, no condemnation,
[35:04] no threat of punishment, no threat of
[35:07] suffering. Right? Not in the traditional
[35:09] sense that we think the the even the
[35:10] idea of loss is not the same as someone
[35:13] who's cast into the lake of fire or
[35:14] finds that things are being stripped
[35:16] away from them and they're being cast uh
[35:18] into hell. This is a complete uh the
[35:21] judgment for rewards is completely
[35:23] different. But there remains a judgment
[35:25] for us now
[35:27] and this is it. As many as I love, I
[35:28] rebuke and chasen. Be zealous therefore
[35:31] and repent.
[35:32] The judgment seat of Christ is not an
[35:34] opportunity to repent. You're producing
[35:36] your final product.
[35:38] You're getting a final grade. There's no
[35:40] redoss. This is it. Only one life. And
[35:43] soon it had passed. And now you stand
[35:46] before the judgment seat of Christ. And
[35:47] only what's done for him will last. And
[35:49] this is the moment, the day of
[35:50] reckoning. This is the time when crowns
[35:52] are going to be given out. And you can't
[35:54] say, "Oh, oh, can I have a just a few
[35:55] more minutes? Can I can I go back and I
[35:57] just want to go find my neighbor and
[35:58] testify real quick? And I I I just want
[36:00] to catch up on my tithing. Can I can I
[36:02] just make a Vinmo real quick? I can do
[36:05] this real fast. What'd you do with my
[36:06] cell phone? Right? Uh there's it's not
[36:08] there's no catchup at that point. This
[36:09] is it. This is the moment. So then he
[36:12] says he has us here in this life. If he
[36:16] loves you, he rebukes you and chastens
[36:18] you. And therefore, if we are rebuked
[36:21] and chasened that we ought to be
[36:22] zealous, the zeal of this age and what
[36:25] we ought to do is repent.
[36:28] And we know what repentance is, right?
[36:31] Repentance isn't, "Oh, I'm sorry. I hope
[36:33] it doesn't happen again type thing,
[36:35] right? Repentance is a change direction.
[36:38] So rebuke, I rebuke and chase and chasen
[36:40] means punishment refers to punishment
[36:42] inflicted by God for the purpose of how
[36:46] many want to guess pain
[36:49] like just pain for the purpose of pain.
[36:52] Punishment for the purpose of of
[36:54] punishment. God's punishment is not
[36:56] punitive for the elect.
[36:58] There is a punishment which is punitive.
[37:00] Right? The wicked, they have their
[37:02] reward. And what does the Bible tell us?
[37:04] They're never going to change. So when
[37:06] they receive their reward, it is
[37:08] punitive. It is retribution. It's
[37:10] punishment. But for the believer, it is
[37:13] punishment for the purpose of education.
[37:16] Punishment for the purpose of
[37:17] instruction and training. So when God
[37:20] punishes us, it's corrective GUIDANCE.
[37:22] WHEN GOD CORRECTS US and punishes us,
[37:25] it's corrective discipline. In other
[37:27] words, God just doesn't punish us, but
[37:29] he deals with us in such a way to say,
[37:31] "You shouldn't have done it that way.
[37:32] You need to do it this way." Right? God
[37:35] knows how to encourage us in the right
[37:36] matters, discourage us in others. And we
[37:38] from this, we can learn a lesson how to
[37:40] raise our families and and and run the
[37:42] church is there's a right way to
[37:43] encourage discipline and recur encourage
[37:46] obedience, encourage the right kind of
[37:48] character. And God has a way of doing
[37:50] it. There has to be a punishment. But
[37:52] then with THE PUNISHMENT, IT'S
[37:53] CORRECTIVE in the sense that IT TELLS
[37:55] YOU HOW TO DO IT RIGHT.
[37:57] I know it can be extremely frustrating
[38:00] when there's punishment for doing
[38:01] something wrong, but you don't know what
[38:02] you did wrong. And then when you're told
[38:05] what you did wrong, you're like, "Well,
[38:06] then how could I do it right?" Well, I
[38:07] don't know. I just know you didn't do it
[38:08] right. You're like, "Well, that's not
[38:10] very nice because I'm I'll probably end
[38:13] up doing it again wrong." And they're
[38:14] like, "Yeah, and I'll get to punish you
[38:15] again." Right? Some people enjoy that.
[38:19] But it means to reprove or convict. And
[38:22] the punishment, this reproval for
[38:24] education, instruction, and training is
[38:26] to bring repentance. In other words, a
[38:28] change of behavior.
[38:30] So this is probably really good for us
[38:33] as parents and those who maybe correct
[38:35] others and leading others that our when
[38:38] we deal with something even by way of
[38:40] punishment, what we want to see is
[38:42] changed behavior. Otherwise, we might
[38:45] need to evaluate our process because the
[38:48] goal isn't just to punish the activity
[38:49] is to change behavior a and to instill
[38:52] the right kind of thought process and
[38:54] wisdom to measure things and know what's
[38:56] right and wrong. So, this chastisement,
[38:58] as many as I love, I rebuke and chasen.
[39:00] This chastisement is not condemnation.
[39:04] It's not judgment for the purpose of
[39:05] pain or for the purpose of of
[39:07] punishment, for the purpose of
[39:09] retribution, but it's judgment for the
[39:11] purpose of correcting our behavior. And
[39:13] if it corrects our behavior, what does
[39:15] it do? It prevents a loss of reward.
[39:17] Prevents loss of blessing here, right?
[39:19] Prevents loss. It prevents suffering. It
[39:21] prevents scars. It prevents wounding.
[39:24] And so God corrects us to prevent loss.
[39:26] God corrects us to change behavior. And
[39:28] by changing our behavior, we preserve
[39:30] rewards in the future. And so our
[39:32] judgment something, one thing to
[39:34] remember is we'll maybe be concluding
[39:36] this series soon. Our judgment, this
[39:38] correction is taking place now. Judging
[39:41] ourselves now by the word of God. We're
[39:42] chastised. We're corrected. And as we're
[39:44] chasted and corrected, we're learning
[39:45] obedience. Brother Benham wrote this in
[39:48] chapter nine of the church age book. To
[39:50] rebuke is to reprove. Notice how he
[39:51] defines this. So important. To reprove
[39:54] is to expose with the view to
[39:56] correction.
[39:57] If you rebuke somebody and all you do is
[40:00] expose them, you have not properly
[40:02] rebuked them. To re it's to repu reprove
[40:05] with a view to correction. I just don't
[40:08] want to laugh at you. You did that
[40:11] wrong. But I want to expose something so
[40:13] I can correct the way that you're doing
[40:15] it. Not to shame somebody, make them
[40:17] feel guilty, but hey, wait a minute.
[40:18] You're doing that wrong. You shouldn't
[40:19] do it this way. This is the proper way
[40:20] to do that. This is consequence for
[40:22] doing it that way. But this is the right
[40:24] way to do it. To reprove is to expose
[40:25] with the view to correction. Chasen does
[40:28] not mean to punishment. Punish. It means
[40:30] to discipline because the subject's
[40:32] amendment is in mind. Oh, that's so
[40:35] beautiful. Then he says, I rebuke and
[40:38] chasen. He wants to correct. And when he
[40:40] chasens it, he disciplines you because
[40:43] your amendment, your improvement, your
[40:46] betterment is in mind. What does it
[40:49] mean? God wants improvement. God wants
[40:51] growth. And if he sees it, he rewards
[40:53] it.
[40:55] And as we learn obedience, we become
[40:57] more faithful. We become more fruitful
[40:59] as the scriptur is referring to. And the
[41:01] more fruitful we are, the more rewards
[41:04] we earn. Is that not the principle we're
[41:06] seeing? God is going to reward this. In
[41:08] Hebrews 12:es 5-11, we're making really
[41:11] really good time tonight. Appreciate
[41:13] your attentiveness. In Hebrews 12:es
[41:16] 5-11, I know it's very very simple, very
[41:19] straightforward. Says, "And you have,"
[41:21] and we'll just read through this. I
[41:22] think it's um the principle that we need
[41:24] to catch here. I think we can just glean
[41:25] just by reading through it. And you have
[41:27] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[41:29] unto you as unto children. My son,
[41:31] despise not thou the chastening of the
[41:34] Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[41:37] him. So what is the rebuke? Expose with
[41:40] the view of correction. So if he exposes
[41:43] it, he wants you to correct it. It's if
[41:45] he chasens, it's discipline because he
[41:47] wants your amendment or improvement. He
[41:50] wants you to do better. So why would we
[41:52] despise it? Maybe maybe our relationship
[41:56] to task masters and and bosses and
[41:58] parents and pastors in our lives have
[42:01] soured our taste for correction because
[42:03] it wasn't done the right way. But God,
[42:04] when he corrects you, he just wants you
[42:06] to improve, for your own good.
[42:09] Not even FOR HIS. HE WANTS IT FOR YOUR
[42:11] OWN GOOD. My son, despise not thou the
[42:14] chastening, nor faint when you are
[42:15] rebuked. Verse six, for whom the Lord
[42:18] loveth, he chastineth and scourgeth,
[42:20] every son whom he receiveth. So there's
[42:22] the idea that this is a son who needs to
[42:25] be chastened, who needs to be scourged.
[42:27] And he says, if you endure chastening,
[42:29] God dealeth with you as with sons. Think
[42:32] of the principle then now that he's
[42:33] wanting us to apply of how a father
[42:34] would treat his son and what the
[42:36] ultimate goal is in training his son and
[42:38] raising him and rearing him. What he
[42:40] ultimately would want that son to be
[42:42] he'd want him to stand in his ownstead.
[42:45] He would want him to be as a son. The
[42:47] Hebrew word is a bearer a builder of the
[42:49] family name. So the father has a
[42:51] responsibility to build the family name
[42:53] so that when the son's time comes, he is
[42:55] bearing that name properly and can do it
[42:57] not with just authority but full power
[43:00] as being the namesake as being the
[43:02] leader and the and the father of even
[43:04] the family as it continues. So that's
[43:05] the image that God wants you to
[43:07] recognize. If he chasens you, he's
[43:08] dealing with you as sons. For what son
[43:10] is he whom the father chastineth not?
[43:12] But if you be without chastisement where
[43:14] whereof all are partakers, then are ye
[43:17] bastards and not sons? What a what a
[43:19] blunt statement, right? Furthermore, we
[43:22] have had fathers of our flesh which
[43:24] corrected us. And we gave them
[43:26] reverence. Amen. Right. Right. Children,
[43:29] when your father corrects you, you give
[43:30] reverence. Shall we not much rather be
[43:32] in subjection unto the father of spirits
[43:34] and live? For they verily for a few days
[43:37] chasened us after their own pleasure. I
[43:40] know that sounds a little sorted, but it
[43:41] doesn't mean we enjoy it. But we do it
[43:43] in what we believe is right for you, of
[43:45] our own wisdom. But he for our profit
[43:48] that we might be partakers of his
[43:50] holiness.
[43:52] Now what is he referring to again? Think
[43:54] about what was said in Peter. What was
[43:55] said by Paul? What are they referring
[43:57] to? This chastening that we might be
[43:59] partakers of his holiness. It doesn't
[44:01] merely mean a greater holiness in this
[44:03] life. But it also speaks of something
[44:04] later because he says now no chastening
[44:06] for the present seemth to be joyous but
[44:08] grievous. Nevertheless, afterward it
[44:10] yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[44:12] righteousness unto them which are
[44:14] exercised thereby.
[44:16] And there's a clear application of this
[44:18] principle not just to this life. If we
[44:20] endure suffering and we take patiently,
[44:23] we endure his correction that we're a
[44:25] further partaker of holiness. And as we
[44:26] endure the chastening of the Lord, in
[44:28] the moment it doesn't seem great. It
[44:29] doesn't seem joyous. But once we've
[44:31] endured it and we've corrected and we've
[44:33] uh and we've demonstrated that we've
[44:35] learned our lesson, then it yields the
[44:37] peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[44:39] them which the correction was exercised
[44:41] then. Not only does it happen in this
[44:44] life, but to be exercised thereby it
[44:46] means the chastise and the correction
[44:48] will yield a benefit and a reward for
[44:50] you even at the judgment seat of Christ.
[44:55] I think that image I want you to see
[44:56] that image even in this verse that if
[44:59] God deals with you as a son and he
[45:00] chasens you there's a direct benefit in
[45:03] this life but whatever benefit there is
[45:04] in this life there's a reward in the
[45:06] next life.
[45:08] And let me say this to kind of turn the
[45:09] corner now so we could head towards
[45:11] home. Our conduct in this life is either
[45:14] fitting for reward or for correction.
[45:18] I I think that's a good way of thinking
[45:20] about it that if I do something in this
[45:21] life that I don't necessarily need to
[45:23] think, oh great, I'm going to get it and
[45:26] like you're going to be judged and cut
[45:28] off. It was something I realized in my
[45:29] life that I battled even as a as an
[45:31] adult uh later on in life that there was
[45:34] always this sense that God was just
[45:35] going to cut me off at one point. And it
[45:37] was because I had the wrong idea of
[45:38] love. I had the wrong idea of God's
[45:40] election and and that I could just rest
[45:43] in his love knowing that if I do
[45:44] something wrong, I can expect to be
[45:46] corrected, but I didn't have to be
[45:48] worried about being cut off and not
[45:49] being a son. [snorts]
[45:51] And so our conduct, our behavior,
[45:53] attitude, the things we say and do, and
[45:55] all that would encompass our lives,
[45:56] we're either living a life that
[45:58] demonstrates a faithfulness and it's
[45:59] worthy of reward or we're living in such
[46:01] a way that it's fitting for correction.
[46:04] So our lives in our lives God will
[46:06] either correct us now or reward us
[46:07] later.
[46:09] I that's when I would want to take it,
[46:11] right? I don't want to know that there's
[46:12] correction later on down the road. I
[46:14] don't want to know think that there's
[46:15] chasing and rebuke on the day of
[46:17] judgment because if I got this kind of
[46:18] notice that said, "Hey, just so you
[46:19] know, there's going to be punishment on
[46:21] the day with the day when you're
[46:22] judged." Then I would say, "Well, then I
[46:23] got to be standing in the wrong
[46:24] judgment.
[46:26] I I I can't be facing punishment um if I
[46:29] stand before him as an elect at that
[46:32] meeting in the air.
[46:33] And so in this life, you'll either
[46:35] receive correction or you'll receive
[46:37] blessing and honor. Let me touch on this
[46:39] very quickly. Paul said, "All things are
[46:41] lawful unto me, but all things are not
[46:43] expedient."
[46:45] Paul is saying that he recognized that
[46:48] it's within his power to do many things,
[46:51] whether it be his right or opportunity,
[46:53] but even in the sense that it might be
[46:54] lawful. He's saying that I may be
[46:56] permitted to do it, but it's not
[46:58] profitable for our purpose.
[47:00] I may be peri per permitted to do it,
[47:02] but is it fruitful? This may be
[47:04] something I can do, but I haven't just
[47:06] been ordained to bring forth fruit. But
[47:08] it's his desire that my fruit would
[47:09] remain and that if I'm bringing forth
[47:11] fruit, God desires to purge me that I
[47:13] might bring forth more fruit. So, I
[47:14] can't just be simply satisfied with
[47:16] saying, well, I have fruit. There's got
[47:17] to be some sort of edge and hunger IN MY
[47:19] HEART TO DO MORE, to reach for more, to
[47:21] press for more. That was the attitude
[47:22] that Paul had. I don't count myself as
[47:25] apprehended. He wanted to press. He
[47:26] wanted to go forward. So he had this
[47:28] idea, though all things are lawful for
[47:30] me, not all things are expedient. And
[47:32] he's not referring to expediency in
[47:34] terms of having his soul saved or
[47:36] sealed, but rather he's referring to the
[47:38] expediency that would relate to
[47:39] fulfilling God's will and the full
[47:42] reward that was available for him. You
[47:44] say, "Well, you know, I could do that. I
[47:46] could get away with that as a Christian.
[47:48] I could I can maybe do that and justify
[47:50] it, but it may not be expedient to
[47:54] fulfilling God's purpose in your life.
[47:56] and you may not get a full reward.
[47:59] And I know that's maybe that might make
[48:01] some people uncomfortable to speak that
[48:03] comfortably to the elect, but if you're
[48:05] elect, I can't unelect you.
[48:07] I know there's a lot of talking these
[48:08] days about fraudulent elections, but
[48:10] God's not one of them,
[48:12] right? It just ain't happening with him.
[48:14] We don't need a recall. We don't need to
[48:16] file a lawsuit. We don't need a recount
[48:18] you. If he elected you, I can't undo it.
[48:23] And so I want to speak to you in a way
[48:25] that brings out the virtue of your
[48:27] election. And the more confident you can
[48:29] be in it, the more confidence you can
[48:31] have living it as a opposed to
[48:33] constantly being in that state of
[48:35] uncertainty because all you're trying to
[48:37] do is prove your election, prove that
[48:39] you're saved, prove that you're prove
[48:41] that you've got it.
[48:44] And so this expediency has nothing to do
[48:46] with the soul, but it's rather to
[48:48] fulfill his will and obtain a full
[48:50] reward.
[48:52] may be permitted but it may not be
[48:54] profitable.
[48:56] And so when our conduct is not
[48:57] expedient, what does God do? He corrects
[49:01] it. When conduct is not expedient, you
[49:04] say, "Well, I think I can do it and get
[49:05] away with it." No, brother said
[49:06] Christians don't sin cheaply. In other
[49:08] words, if you're a Christian, then God
[49:10] is going to correct you. Right?
[49:12] I mean, this should this should help all
[49:13] of us in a lot of ways because we see
[49:15] people do things and get away with
[49:16] things and you're like, "How is it that
[49:19] they can get away with this year after
[49:21] year after year?" And it's as if God
[49:24] never deals with them and then I just do
[49:26] one LITTLE THING AND I SUFFER. YOU
[49:29] SHOULD GO, "YES, YES. I I'm a son.
[49:34] That's why he won't let me get away with
[49:36] it." Because if I do something that's
[49:38] not expedient, if I'm acting and
[49:39] behaving in a way that's not going to
[49:41] allow me to to receive a full reward,
[49:43] that's not going to bring forth
[49:44] perfection and completion in my life,
[49:46] then God is going to bring correction.
[49:49] IF HE'S NOT HAVING PREEMINENCE IN OUR
[49:51] LIVES, WHAT DOES GOD DO? HE BRINGS
[49:52] CORRECTION. If things go a little bit
[49:54] cold AND A LITTLE BIT SIDEWAYS, HE
[49:56] BRINGS SUFFERING. He brings correction.
[49:58] HE DEALS WITH US IN SUCH A WAY TO CHECK
[50:00] OURSELVES UP AND SAY, "AM I DOING THE
[50:01] RIGHT THING?" WHY? HE WANTS PREEMINENCE.
[50:03] IN order to have it, sometimes he has to
[50:05] chasen.
[50:06] He has to rebuke.
[50:09] And so things aren't expedient. He
[50:11] corrects us. Brother Bandom the ser the
[50:14] church age book he's writing this again
[50:15] in chapter 4. Is it strange that God
[50:18] wants to develop a Christlike character
[50:20] that comes through suffering? No sir.
[50:23] And we all have trials and we are all
[50:26] tried and chasened as sons. Not one but
[50:29] goes through that.
[50:33] We all go through it. But the elect have
[50:37] the quality that when tested, it
[50:39] produces character.
[50:42] You can put pressure on a lot of
[50:43] different things and you can try certain
[50:45] things, but if it doesn't have the
[50:46] eternal quality to produce
[50:50] character, then it's destroyed by the
[50:52] pressure, but you've got the quality.
[50:55] And he says it's not we shouldn't think
[50:57] it's strange that God wants to develop
[50:58] Christlike character through suffering.
[51:00] So he writes this. Now this special
[51:02] condition in S smrna this tribulation
[51:05] he's referring to must be applied to
[51:07] every age there is no age free from it
[51:10] there is no true believer free from it
[51:13] this is of God the tribulation the
[51:15] suffering the affliction this is the
[51:17] will of God it is needful
[51:23] we need the Lord to teach us the truth
[51:26] that we are to suffer and to be
[51:29] Christlike in doing
[51:31] That's the truth. We need to be taught
[51:33] this truth that we will suffer. And
[51:35] again, remember suffering is not having
[51:37] um your your your hand cut off because
[51:40] you're a Christian. It's not suffering
[51:41] uh because you suffure physical
[51:44] ailments. But the suffering has to do
[51:46] with fulfilling the will of God in the
[51:49] face of all the opposition that doesn't
[51:51] want you to
[51:53] anymore. Going to church, there's a
[51:54] suffering in doing it. There used to be
[51:57] a time, I'm just speaking, you know,
[51:58] maybe bluntly now. There used to be a
[52:00] time that we could be those, you know,
[52:02] kind of cultish weirdo message
[52:03] believers, you know, and we just did our
[52:05] thing and people just kind of looked at
[52:07] us like, well, they're a little
[52:08] different. And what is it you believe?
[52:09] Well, we believe in a prophet. Oh,
[52:10] that's a little bit strange. And there
[52:11] might have been a time that we could
[52:12] always go on our camps or our retreats
[52:14] and our special meetings and we always
[52:16] had each other and all the voices of the
[52:18] world were tuned out. And there was a
[52:19] time where maybe it was uh we could just
[52:21] kind of get distance from the critics
[52:23] and the pressure and all those things.
[52:25] uh those days are gone,
[52:27] right? We live every moment, every day
[52:29] with the world constantly reminding us
[52:31] of how different we are and how how what
[52:33] how our faith is so different than the
[52:34] world and and our ideals of holiness and
[52:37] even the scriptural principles that we
[52:38] abide by and the convictions we have
[52:40] about the message of the hour. There's
[52:42] so much in our face testing us all the
[52:44] time about these things that there's a
[52:46] suffering in just remaining a Christian
[52:49] in the face of all of it and not
[52:51] returning in kind.
[52:55] to be Christlike in doing it. I think
[52:57] that becomes the great equalizer in the
[53:00] sense that we can say, "Well, I I I know
[53:02] how to suffer. I know how to suffer."
[53:04] But are you Christlike in doing it?
[53:07] We've got to be Christlike in doing it
[53:10] because our character is being perfected
[53:11] through suffering and obedience. This is
[53:14] God's process of character development.
[53:16] I'm I'm sharing this with you because as
[53:19] our character is developed, we become
[53:20] more fit to rule because God will not
[53:22] give us power without character. So the
[53:25] extent of our power is related to the
[53:26] extent of our character. And if that's
[53:28] demonstrated in this life, then we need
[53:30] our character to grow. If that's going
[53:32] to be applicable in the next life in
[53:34] terms of reward, then we want our
[53:35] character to grow. And so it's perfected
[53:38] through sufferings and through
[53:39] obedience. Brother B says we need to
[53:42] suffer and be Christlike in doing it. In
[53:44] Hebrews chapter 5:es 8 and9 it says of
[53:47] Christ though he were a son yet learned
[53:49] he obedience by the things which he
[53:51] suffered. This is remar these are
[53:53] remarkable scriptures because I think
[53:54] for the the Pentecostal oneness uh they
[53:57] would look at this and say well it's
[53:59] it's just it's just meant to be kind of
[54:00] confusing right or it's it's just meant
[54:02] to be poetry and just use your
[54:04] imagination. But it says he was a son
[54:06] and as a son he learned obedience by the
[54:10] things which he suffered and being made
[54:12] perfect he became the author of eternal
[54:16] salvation and all them that obey him.
[54:18] What did brother Ram say in plain
[54:19] language? The very character of Jesus
[54:21] was made perfect by suffering. So you
[54:24] could have a sinless son of God. You
[54:26] could have a son who was perfect and in
[54:28] no way sin. But yet there still was a
[54:29] process of character development in the
[54:32] son of God himself.
[54:34] And so he he himself learned obedience
[54:37] by the things which he suffered. And if
[54:39] he himself learned obedience by the
[54:40] things which he suffered, then God too
[54:42] likewise wants us to suffer through
[54:44] obedience in order that we might learn
[54:46] character and grow in his very image and
[54:48] be made perfect. In other words, have
[54:51] this measure of suffering left for us
[54:53] that we too by suffering according to
[54:55] the will of God could come to this place
[54:57] of perfection. The very our very
[55:00] character is being perfected by
[55:01] suffering. Let's go back to chapter two.
[55:03] He says, "For it became him." Verse 10,
[55:05] "For it became him for whom are all
[55:07] things and by whom are all things and
[55:09] bringing many sons unto glory to make
[55:11] the captain of their salvation perfect
[55:14] through sufferings."
[55:16] He's not perfect at the time that he's
[55:18] conceived by the elements of God alone
[55:20] in the womb of a virgin. He's not
[55:22] perfect in this sense at the time that
[55:24] he's a babe crying in the manger. He's
[55:26] not perfect at 12 years old there in the
[55:28] temple. But as he he subjects himself to
[55:30] his parents and as he increases in
[55:31] wisdom and stature and in favor with God
[55:34] and man, there is an actual process of
[55:36] character development happening in the
[55:38] life of the Lord Jesus Christ. And what
[55:41] is it? It's an example to us how that we
[55:44] too must suffer and be Christlike in
[55:46] doing it. That's why his words ought to
[55:49] have more weight. When when he prays, it
[55:51] ought to have more weight. When he
[55:52] teaches, it ought to have more weight
[55:54] because this was not just one who was
[55:55] just a robot. Love thy neighbor as
[55:57] thyself. Invite over the poor and the
[56:00] maimed. As if he never knew what it was
[56:02] like to feel like you feel. Right? He's
[56:04] up there saying, "Listen, if you do
[56:06] something for the people who are rich
[56:08] and have goods and you invite them over
[56:10] uh and they're the ones that can REPAY
[56:12] YOU, BUT DEMONSTRATE FIDELITY,
[56:14] DEMONSTRATE FAITHFULNESS, DEMONSTRATE
[56:15] THAT YOU REALLY ARE like me in that
[56:18] you'll give service to the poor, the
[56:20] weak, the maimed, the marginalized, the
[56:22] outcasts, the people who HAVE NO VOICE.
[56:24] THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CHRISTIANITY
[56:25] THAT IS A DEFENDER OF THOSE THAT ARE
[56:27] WEAK. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
[56:28] CHRISTIANITY WHO'S NOT IN IT FOR WHAT
[56:30] THEY can get out of it, but they're in
[56:32] IT FOR WHAT CHRIST wants to give to
[56:34] others.
[56:36] And he was made perfect through
[56:38] suffering. And brother Brandham says in
[56:40] many places, a lot of places just went
[56:42] ahead and skipped over it. We'll get on
[56:43] to it. I think we'll get to it on
[56:44] Sunday. This idea, it ties well into
[56:48] this character development and being
[56:49] sons and being heirs and this process
[56:51] that God puts us through because this
[56:53] actually just to me sheds so much light
[56:55] on other principles in the word of God
[56:57] that sometimes are difficult to place
[56:59] because we start wrestling well what
[57:00] does that have to do with salvation and
[57:02] does that have to do with this and does
[57:03] it have to do with that and you realize
[57:04] it has everything just to do with how
[57:06] God rewards his son and how God rewards
[57:09] his children and brother Bam says it's
[57:11] your character
[57:13] your conduct that gives God confidence
[57:15] confidence in you.
[57:17] He's confident in his seal, right? He
[57:19] knows that won't break. But in terms of
[57:21] his confidence in you, he's looking at
[57:24] character. He's looking at conduct. And
[57:27] the truths of character development,
[57:29] suffering, correction, all have, this is
[57:31] what I want us to think about. It all
[57:32] has future application.
[57:35] And how is it we look at this and we
[57:37] recognize this? Too much time is spent
[57:40] on the temporal blessings
[57:42] instead of eternal rewards.
[57:45] We spend too much time just focusing now
[57:47] on on things that make it life easier.
[57:50] We focus on things now. Even you know
[57:52] there's a lot of focus even we can have
[57:54] as Christians on things that just kind
[57:56] of make life matter now
[57:58] and and and and just make it give more
[58:01] meaning to the days and the moments and
[58:02] the weekend or whatever. And there's
[58:04] maybe a lot of ways that we view
[58:05] Christianity that kind of stop at that
[58:07] door starts when we get in, stops when
[58:09] we leave. and you're leaving so much off
[58:11] the table
[58:13] and too little time is spent worrying
[58:16] about temporal blessings instead of
[58:17] eternal rewards. And I want these
[58:19] truths, even these things that we've
[58:21] shared with you tonight, I want them to
[58:22] give perspective to the process that God
[58:23] is using to prepare your future
[58:28] that the things we go through now, you
[58:30] could think about broken marriages, you
[58:31] could think about losses this way, and
[58:33] you could think of all these different
[58:35] things. And if you just realize that God
[58:36] is preparing me for my future,
[58:40] that the things that we suffer, things
[58:41] that we endure, and think about how
[58:43] people will do things, they'll take
[58:44] courses, they'll go to college, they'll
[58:46] spend years in particular study and
[58:47] training and and and they go through a
[58:49] lot of rigorous things. And why? Because
[58:51] they know one day they're going to get
[58:52] the degree. They know one day they're
[58:53] going to get the job. And that when they
[58:55] start earning the fruits of all their
[58:57] labor, they say, "That's why I did it
[58:59] all that time. That's why I did this
[59:01] because I knew there was a payoff." If
[59:02] we could just realize that this life is
[59:05] preparing us for our future
[59:07] and to put everything in perspective in
[59:09] terms of loss and gain and sorrow and
[59:11] hurt and heartache and and being
[59:13] uncomfortable and being vulnerable and
[59:15] making difficult decisions a and all the
[59:18] things that we might have to go through
[59:19] in this life to in doing what we know is
[59:21] God's perfect will. He's not it's he's
[59:24] preparing you for your future
[59:27] and that there's this reality that
[59:28] there's nothing you've lost here that
[59:30] you haven't already gained there. And
[59:32] when we think about the suffering of
[59:33] this present time is not worthy to be
[59:35] compared to the glory which shall be
[59:36] revealed in us. I know it doesn't quite
[59:38] seem right, but there's there's a
[59:40] there's a an equal and opposite
[59:42] reaction. If we could just get
[59:43] scientific to every action, there's an
[59:45] equal and opposite reaction. In this way
[59:47] that if there's suffering to a 10,
[59:49] that's a negative. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S
[59:51] BAD. THAT'S AWFUL. BUT IT'S NOT WORTHY
[59:53] TO BE COMPARED BECAUSE THEN GOD HAS A
[59:55] counterbalance to it that there's a
[59:57] glory out of 10
[59:59] and that we realize this life h is
[1:00:01] preparing us for our future.
[1:00:05] It's in that way that we could say
[1:00:06] nothing is wasted. Nothing is wasted.
[1:00:10] That with everything that you suffer, IF
[1:00:12] SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING nasty to you,
[1:00:14] somebody treats you harshly and you go
[1:00:16] through something and YOU SUFFER AND
[1:00:18] YOU'RE CHRISTLIKE in doing it, there's
[1:00:19] just more weight. More weight. More
[1:00:23] weight. Your future just got brighter.
[1:00:25] And next time, next time somebody treats
[1:00:28] you harshly and abuses you, you just
[1:00:30] take out your sunglasses and you just
[1:00:31] go, "Yeah." Right? You put them on. Say,
[1:00:34] "My future just got brighter. I need to
[1:00:36] put on some shades." Right? I know that
[1:00:39] may be a little bit of a weird example,
[1:00:40] but that's exactly what's happening. The
[1:00:42] more you take it Christlike and the more
[1:00:45] that you endure the things in this life
[1:00:46] with the right kind of character, your
[1:00:48] future's getting brighter.
[1:00:50] Let these things give you this
[1:00:51] perspective. That's why I'm taking the
[1:00:53] time to share it. This is why I
[1:00:54] mentioned on accountability, the day of
[1:00:55] reckoning, some of these principles said
[1:00:57] this the subject of judgment rewards.
[1:00:59] It's not like brother Brandham preached
[1:01:00] a whole sermon on it. It's not that you
[1:01:02] have a lot of uh teaching that just
[1:01:04] builds and builds and builds, but it's
[1:01:05] almost as if it's just something that's
[1:01:07] assumed and the writers of the New
[1:01:08] Testament, something brother Bam just
[1:01:10] speaks matterofactly in his message. And
[1:01:12] so you realize that in order to bring
[1:01:14] all these things together, I'm just I'm
[1:01:16] just seeking the mind of the Lord to
[1:01:18] find a way to present it. where just
[1:01:19] adds more color to it, makes the picture
[1:01:22] a little bit larger. I think this is one
[1:01:23] of those subjects, this process of
[1:01:24] character development that just kind of
[1:01:26] helps us step back a little bit, adds a
[1:01:27] little bit more color and more
[1:01:28] definition. And I want to give you a
[1:01:30] perspective of how that God uses this
[1:01:33] process of character development for
[1:01:34] your future. And there will be rewards
[1:01:36] given out.
[1:01:38] I'll close on this. We'll invite our
[1:01:40] musicians to come tonight.
[1:01:43] Remember how we were reading in John how
[1:01:45] that I chose you. You didn't choose me.
[1:01:47] I've chose you and that I've ordained
[1:01:50] you. This is love ordaining and I want
[1:01:53] you to bring forth fruit and I want your
[1:01:54] fruit to remain. And it's such that if
[1:01:56] you bear fruit, then I'm going to purge
[1:01:58] you. I'm going to scold you. I'm going
[1:02:00] to correct you. But remember, if I'm
[1:02:01] doing it, I'm only exposing you with the
[1:02:03] view to correction. And I'm only
[1:02:05] correcting you so that you're you can be
[1:02:07] amended.
[1:02:09] I'm only correcting you because you can
[1:02:10] bring forth more fruit.
[1:02:12] says, "Herein is now here and now is now
[1:02:15] set forth the love of God. He desired to
[1:02:18] love a family of his own, a family of
[1:02:21] sons, sons like himself.
[1:02:25] There before him lies all mankind is one
[1:02:28] lump of clay. Out of that same lump
[1:02:30] he'll now make vessels unto honor and
[1:02:32] unto dishonor." I think that's important
[1:02:34] to recognize
[1:02:36] that if it whe whether it be used as a a
[1:02:39] cloth, a piece of cloth and something
[1:02:41] cut out of it or just a lump of clay,
[1:02:43] but he uses one for honor and one for
[1:02:45] dishonor. In other words, when he's done
[1:02:47] with you, you look nothing like the
[1:02:48] original. You're no longer just a lump,
[1:02:51] right? No longer just a piece of cloth.
[1:02:53] You're in his glory. There lies before
[1:02:56] him all mankind is one lump of clay. Out
[1:02:57] of the same lump, he'll now make vessels
[1:02:59] under honor and under dishonor. The
[1:03:01] choosing will be his own choosing. Now
[1:03:04] the chosen ones, trust that you
[1:03:06] recognize yourself as this. Then those
[1:03:09] chosen ones born of his spirit, that's
[1:03:12] the born again, those who are sealed
[1:03:14] with the Holy Ghost, will be trained to
[1:03:17] conform to his image in their walk. That
[1:03:20] is the process of character development.
[1:03:23] It's not the process of being beaten and
[1:03:25] bruised and chastised and corrected so
[1:03:26] that you can
[1:03:29] change your behavior to get the Holy
[1:03:30] Ghost. No, this is the walk of a Holy
[1:03:33] Spirit-filled son trained to conform to
[1:03:35] his image in their walk. He reproves
[1:03:38] with all longsuffering and gentleness
[1:03:40] and mercy. He chasens with nails scarred
[1:03:43] hands. Sometimes this potter must take
[1:03:46] the vessel he's working on and
[1:03:47] thoroughly break it down in order that
[1:03:49] he may rebuild it exactly as he desires
[1:03:51] it. But it is love and and this is all
[1:03:55] caps that is his love. Another way of
[1:03:58] his love there is not there cannot be.
[1:04:03] This is the love of God expressed to us.
[1:04:07] If I could be uh I don't think it's
[1:04:09] presumptuous at all to say it this way
[1:04:11] but he says that the he has chosen a
[1:04:13] lump of clay to be a lump of honor
[1:04:17] and the chosen ones are born of his
[1:04:19] spirit. And so God could have ordained
[1:04:23] that you were born of his spirit. And so
[1:04:24] you're now a born again lump of clay and
[1:04:27] he just sets you on the shelf and I'm
[1:04:30] going to go work on another piece of
[1:04:31] clay and I'm just going to harvest a
[1:04:33] bunch of uncut lumps of clay and they're
[1:04:36] all born of my spirit. And then we just
[1:04:39] become these lumps of clay that in the
[1:04:42] in in the eternities were just kind of
[1:04:44] lumps of clay that have been born of his
[1:04:47] spirit. And we start to ask ourselves,
[1:04:49] how then are we any different from the
[1:04:50] angels in eternity? What what makes us
[1:04:54] any different? I think at that point,
[1:04:55] I'm just speculating wildly because
[1:04:58] that's not what he says. Not only does
[1:04:59] he give us the spirit and say, "All
[1:05:01] right, you're on your own or you got the
[1:05:03] spirit, you're sealed, you're done,
[1:05:04] you're finished." He says, "Now, I want
[1:05:06] to train you and I want to train you so
[1:05:09] that you can become more like me and
[1:05:11] express my character and express my
[1:05:13] attributes." And it's his love that does
[1:05:16] it.
[1:05:17] And his love is so great that he's not
[1:05:19] just wanting you uh to BE A CHRISTIAN
[1:05:21] FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT a and that's
[1:05:24] the end of it. BUT HE SAYS, "NOW THAT
[1:05:26] I'VE GIVEN YOU THIS blessedness of
[1:05:27] eternal life, I want to use the eternal
[1:05:30] life that's INSIDE OF YOU TO MAKE
[1:05:32] ETERNAL LIFE BRIGHTER, to make your
[1:05:34] FUTURE BRIGHTER, TO ALLOW YOU TO BE IN A
[1:05:36] POSITION TO HAVE MORE HONOR, MORE
[1:05:38] PRAISE, AND MORE GLORY. I WANT YOU TO BE
[1:05:40] FAITHFUL WITH THE POUND I'VE GIVEN YOU
[1:05:42] SO THAT ON THAT DAY I CAN SAY BE THOU
[1:05:44] RULER over 10 cities.
[1:05:47] And he gives us this opportunity now as
[1:05:49] Christians to be reproved through his
[1:05:52] reproving through his correction
[1:05:54] to become to have a greater character
[1:05:56] and a greater faithfulness. And he will
[1:05:59] I'm saying this service after service he
[1:06:02] will reward that. Certainly in this life
[1:06:06] there's rewards, but the real ones, the
[1:06:08] true riches are to come. And so this
[1:06:11] statement, if you could share it,
[1:06:12] brother Jonathan, it's that last slide.
[1:06:14] Don't ever be discouraged, saint of God.
[1:06:16] For God is not ungracious to forget your
[1:06:18] labors of love. Whatever you do, and
[1:06:22] then the most trivial of them all, even
[1:06:24] giving a cup of cold water to someone
[1:06:26] has a reward and blessing from the Lord.
[1:06:32] Amen.
[1:06:34] We have a process that we're in. We're
[1:06:36] in the process of character development.
[1:06:38] The better we can understand what God's
[1:06:40] trying to achieve in our lives, I think
[1:06:41] the more that we may be willing to
[1:06:43] endure suffering in this life, knowing
[1:06:46] that on that day, that glory is going to
[1:06:49] be a lot heavier
[1:06:51] because of it. Now, that suggests
[1:06:55] that if you're not Christlike in doing
[1:06:56] it and you run away from it and you're
[1:07:00] all and you're and you're not learning
[1:07:02] through the correction, then maybe it
[1:07:04] weighs a little less. Doesn't that imply
[1:07:06] that?
[1:07:07] But that's not you, right? That won't be
[1:07:10] us. While everyone else is running away
[1:07:13] from the will of God, we're going to run
[1:07:14] into it. I'm going to say, "Let it be in
[1:07:17] my life that I honor you and I glorify
[1:07:19] you." God bless you tonight. Thank you
[1:07:21] for your attentiveness.
