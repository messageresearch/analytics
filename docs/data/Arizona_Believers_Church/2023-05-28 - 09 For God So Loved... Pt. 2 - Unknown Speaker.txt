TRANSCRIPT
========================================
really excited about the subject this morning and continuing we're going to be reading John 3 16 here just in a moment but part two of for God so loved as I mentioned last time I think was last Sunday we said this is a setup and I think you should probably be anticipating that the it's just going to keep building and this is foundation for going into what I'd like to look at and I may end up looking at it sooner than I thought I would on the restoration of the first love and also love secrets that are being made manifest and revealed to us in these last days I think these things kind of all build to the thought of the Capstone which is charity and the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour so if you look at John chapter 3 verse 16 it says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life I believe we took this and broke it down in different ways last Sunday but we looked at how that God is the lover and the world is the loved so we talk about the lover that's God when we talk about the loved that is the world and say it now and this is going to be repeated over and over again that's a particular world not just the world we're thinking about and so in this it says for God so loved the world so the lover loved the loved that he gave so the lover is the giver and here it says he's a giver of his only begotten son in order to give eternal life and therefore the love is the receiver and it receives that son to live eternally and we saw that how the lover is eternal the love is eternal and the loved is eternal so we we see that hatred has an end because the object of hatred will will be gone but for the the loved of God that God who loves is eternal the love is eternal and therefore the loved is eternal and so this love because everything is have it has an eternal quality the love is a redeeming love it's not a condemning love it's not a love that finally says all right that's it I'm done uh we're finished here it's over but it's a love that's always seeking to recover always seeking to renew it's a redeeming love and we looked at it from the standpoint I'm trying to remember just exactly where we were in the scripture and we saw that perfect love removes every barrier between the lover and beloved and so if there's something between the lover and the loved uh love wants to remove that perfect love wants to remove that obstruction God was not satisfied looking at a Chasm between you and him and said you know what I'll put up with sacrifices and I'll I'll take their burnt offerings and I'll watch them through their cycles of repentance and sin God was not satisfied for that God wanted to close that Gap he wanted to remove the barrier and that's what perfect love does is if there's ever any disagreement if there's ever any disharmony if there's ever any hate perfect love wants to remove that and as we look at for God so loved the world and we're looking at the loved world the believer you individually as a Believer you are a part of the mystery of the loved world and so we talk about the loved world or the world that God loved we're looking at two different worlds when it comes to The Condemned and the redeemed you have the loved world the redeemed world and you also have The Condemned world of the world of hate the world of the ungodly and a second Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 10 to 13 and it's speaking of the Antichrist the wicked one I'm gonna take a deep breath and a sip of water and just slow down I didn't even have a Red Bull or anything this morning and I just feel so amped up I need to put on a football helmet and run into a wall or something right now just to kind of get some of this energy out or maybe forego the football helmet just do it it says and with all speaking of the Antichrist and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness and them that perish so now you have them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved look at what's at the heart of Salvation love the love of the truth they didn't receive it so it's something that was going to be given and for this cause shall God send them delusion that they should believe a lie now just think of this if you don't love truth and and you're you're being deceived by all sorts of unrighteousness and you're you're doomed to perish and then God sees that and guess what he does send strong delusion he compounds it he says and he sends God shall send them strong delusion they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness that was there long and that was their desire that was their joy that was their love is this unrighteousness so that's one world that's the world of the ungodly that's the world of hate that's the world of sin that's the world of unbelief that's the world of human nature Fallen nature but now he says but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth remember how brother Bram teaches us that the predestinator are the only ones included in Redemption are considered in Redemption so when we read this the take away from it the very clear takeaway from is there's those who are chosen to delusion and those who are chosen to Salvation And if that if that language kind of hurts a little bit then there's those that are chosen to delusion and then everyone or to Salvation and everyone else they're just kind of left with what's at what's left and so when we look at this as God choosing one to Salvation the object of elective love is chosen to be saved it is by God's choice brother man makes a remarkable statement you're not a Christian by your desire you're a Christian by God's desire and so it kind of puts it all we love him because he first loved us and he chose us by elective love and so the object of elective love uh has a different Destiny than everyone else has a different fate than everyone else and if some of you are kind of um building very quickly and taking the next step you say oh does that mean there won't be anyone else in eternity uh who isn't the object of this elective love they'll be those who are there but we're just looking at this elective love that gives unique and true salvation to the elect and there'll be those who enter into eternal life they'll be those who were not part of the body of Christ and not saved that will receive eternal life at White Throne judgment I think we've gone through that even recently and so this isn't this isn't trying to bring some hard stop to uh to eternal life or some hard stop to those who will be there in eternity but it is meant to distinguish among those who are God's elect and everyone else who finds themselves under a different Destiny and fate and I think the devil would like to blur those lines it says in Matthew chapter 24 verses 11 and 12 and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many so we read where it says as many as I love by rebuke and chasten and so the the many are those that he loves so that says that he's loved many not all but there's a many that God loves it means there's an elect that God loves and here it says that false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many not all but many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold it's through this process that we see there there's no love for the truth there's no love for the things of God there's no love for righteousness and so this love that we're talking about perfect love becomes such a unique thing that it can only be found among the elect even A Love For Truth a love for Christ a love for things of righteousness that there's not even just uh even a sincere desire to uphold virtuous sincere desire to uphold righteousness because of iniquity the love for the simple things of the gospel and the pure word of God is waning all across the world and it's these false prophets that are deceiving many but now if you've jumped to verse 24 for this shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and there's your for God so loved the world in other words it's the love of God that keeps you from being deceived there is a predestinated objective for the love of God those that God loves he has a predestinative objective for them and that objective will not allow you to be deceived I know we like to think it's because we study and because we pay attention in church and that we just we're just good enough and by golly when we see Vindication we recognize it that quick and hey you know what can I say we're spiritual right and so we feel really good about ourselves but God's always going it reminds me of the other day I was going to Dutch Bros or some say Dutch Brothers there's a debate on that but Dutch Bros I think is the official corporate stance and as I'm getting my drink for my the drink for my wife uh I was asked who's the most famous person you ever met and I'm like and I didn't really know what to say I was like I've met some athletes in my time and I asked them who's the most famous person they met I don't know who that was and and as I drove away I just had this image and I kind of looked at my passenger seat and there was Jesus going really come on man that was I mean that was served up just perfectly and I'm just driving away you know with the the 911 or triple emergency or whatever it is it's got 340 grams of uh milligrams of caffeine in it and I'm like sorry you want me to go back and order another one it just completely forgot that the most famous person I've ever met is Jesus Christ but the reason why that we're not deceived is because of him it's not anything we can brag about it's not being raised right it's not being taught right that there's such a small Veil between deception and and knowledge and Revelation or discernment and Christ is that protection he is that barrier and I'm wanting you to recognize that it has it has to do with the quality and nature of God's election and predestination because God's love demands that the predestinated objective is fulfilled if he has something he's going to do he's going to accomplish it and his love requires this object of his love it requires that God's objective will be fulfilled and brother Brown was looking at God so loved the world he said God is reserving life this is what love does it's reserving life and so in this phrase for God so loved the world there's a beautiful mystery that's expressed in this phrase and I would say it's expressed in a way to where the immediate thought and I was I went to private school for a number of years and it was a Baptist Southern Baptist convention private school and so this was taught so God so loved the world and the world was just everybody and everyone regardless of of their background or calling or their repentance or their quality in life no matter what it's just God loved everyone he loved the world he loved the mountains he loved the cities he loved the streams God just loved everything and so there's this idea that the world just kind of speaks to all of humanity all of creation all of human nature Jew Gentile you name it they're all kind of lumped in here but the world that's being referred to here is not all humans are human nature it's not the present World nor is it the future world but it's a specific object or subject in second Peter chapter 2 verse 5 it says speaking of God and spared not the old world but saved Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly the old world was inhabitants of the earth it was the men the race and and their Affairs their goods their Pleasures that's what world can be used to refer to that it has to do with Humanity what they're interested in what their Affairs are their goods their devices their Pleasures their possessions and so when God spared not the old world it was all the inhabitants therein and it was all their goods and all their possessions and all their cities and so God destroyed the ungodly world because of sin the Bible says their imagination was only evil continually and he preserves only eight Souls and so God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and now when we back up to the days of Noah God was so uh repentant of having created man that he's like I'm going to wipe them off the face of the Earth and he only preserves eight well when the old world was destroyed let me say this it didn't destroy the world that God loved in second Timothy chapter 4 verse 10 so that's the world passed and then it says for demuth Demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world again this is an example of how that the world that Demas loved is its Affairs it's politics it's present State it's current condition as it relates to humanity and Paul is forsaken by Demas who had a love for a world and this world is a different world than the world that God loved the soul loved World holds a mystery which I believe we kind of really drilled down last time which you are a part of by predestination it says for God so loved the world you you ought to think of yourself as being a part of that my predestination this is God's elective love for me but this mystery holds more than just individual salvation though that is the most important thing for us it holds more in its type and is it representation but all of it that this world represents is God's original plan and purpose that God so loved the world he has some objective he has he's the lover with the loved and his love has an elect object and it has a predestinated objective for that object and as Jesus says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he is and he's what he's rep what he's raising to this Jew is important for us to consider because the audience being Nicodemus holds a key to understanding the mystery of this lover his love and the loved speaking to a Jewish rabbi I believe as we mentioned last time and he's kind of rebuking him or refuting rebutting the belief that the messiah's salvation this King Messiah when he comes was going to be only to Israel or to the Jews because that's the way that they looked at it you could go through countless other scriptures and you say that and even in the rabbinic teachings in the midrash and you go and read all their or their Traditions that oral history has been transcribed in their writings uh they take from many different scriptures how that when the Messiah comes he's going to be tender to Israel and sharp to everyone else they take Malachi 4 2 about the son of righteousness Rising with healing in his wings he says there's healing for the Israelites but the all the other nations shall be burned by it so though there's healing the wings of the son of righteousness for Israel but everyone else those wings are going to burn them they're going to be destroyed and we're going to walk out on the ashes of the wicked they say there's Mercy for Israel but judgment for the rest of the Nations and so Jesus is and if I could say this now and come back to it uh maybe a later time Jesus is hinting at the Gentile Brave because here are the Jews like we're it we are the chosen ones we are the seed of God we are the Seed of Abraham we are the ones that all the promises pertain to that when the Messiah comes he's going to restore our kingdom and raise up this great Kingdom and in this Kingdom the Messiah is going to rule and Reign and we're gonna he's gonna Rule and Reign Over all other nations of the rod of iron and they'll all come to his light but his subjects to us and subjects to our nation and so the kingdom was at the center of the Prophecy of the Messiah and that's enormous concept and principle that uh you just would open up a whole other channel of thought but Jesus in John chapter 3 will read verse 3 and Skip to verse 5. after Nicodemus has kind of offered this a compliment we know that you couldn't do these things unless you came from God it's at that moment that Jesus now speaks to something that's going to be at the very heart of Nicodemus because Nicodemus is a believer that the Messiah is going to come when he comes he's going to restore Israel and if if this is the Messiah if you're the Messiah then you're going to restore the kingdom break the bonds of slavery and bondage of Rome you're going to bring You're Going To Rule and Reign and the whole earth is going to be uh see the light of this great glorious Kingdom so the kingdom is at the heart of what this Jew is thinking about so Jesus says in verse 3 verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now this has some layers to it because it to a Jew when a non-jew is converted they kind of viewed him as being like a newborn baby that was kind of their language that they would use is that a non-jew when converted begins again and knew as as a babe so when Jesus says that except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he's kind of spoke directly to kind of what's in the heart of Nicodemus and he's saying and I think Nicodemus kind of catches that there's some sort of rebuttal here because he's like what what is a man gonna do you know you're obviously not talking about a gentile you're talking about the Jews who are looking to see the kingdom they want to see the kingdom they want to see it restored the Messiah is going to be the one that's restored it and he says unless you are born again you won't see that he said well how can that be how are we going to enter back into our mother's womb and be born a second time he says verily verily I said to thee accept a man be born of water in the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God and as we could read the next few verses we'd find that he's dividing between the flesh that which would be of Abraham that which would be of their parents between those that were born of the Flesh and those born of the spirit and this is a really strong challenge to Jewish tradition because everything to them related to Bloodline and flesh they found they found their their sanctification they found the security and the fact that they could trace their blood lineage back to Father Abraham and as long as their genealogy was correct you know as long as they got the 23andMe test back and they were related to Abraham they were good and then if you were a non-jew then you had to come in another way and you had to be the one that's a convert and a proselyte uh to the Jewish faith and you'd be as a newborn babe so Jesus is saying wait a minute I want to take you into a different thought process here that even though you're born after the Flesh of Jew there's a spiritual birth that's required to understand the kingdom of God and in in the church age book chapter four and this is part of the smyrnian church age where brother Brown's going through the love of God in the election of God and all these different statements we've been reading about perfect love and love brother man says and and this is his all caps right so he's wanting he he's yelling at us we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn did you get that only the elect can be reborn so when Jesus is still talking about accept a man be born again if we just took that to the next level we say unless a man is elected to a birth you'll never understand or see the king of God because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there's nothing to Quicken so there's nothing if someone's non-seed they cannot be born again and so John 3 16 refers to God's Act of love whereby he has elected you to Salvation he has chosen you to Salvation and has chosen you to sanctification and through by belief of the truth and when he's telling this to Nicodemus except a man be born again and he comes back around and says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever would believeth to him would not perish but what would be born again into everlasting life it's according to election because only the elect can be reborn John 3 16 for God so loved the world this is an act of love to fulfill his predestinated objective it is it is in order that God would bring forth his perfect will so to put it this way God's not looking at a massive humanity and I think we've um we've kind of unpacked it this way before that God did not create Adam and the woman put him in the garden and then said hold on I'm going to be right back and go take a nap and then go and while he's gone he comes back to walk with him the cool the evening he's like what have you done what happened like like a new puppy or something he left him alone in the apartment he's going who did this who did Adam Adam and he's not distraught and he's like well you know you know what I don't know what else to do except to shut down the garden get out of here fend for yourselves and then God's just over there stewing going okay what should I do what should I do what should I do what should I do how am I going to fix this and I got an idea they're gonna there's gonna be billions of people born throughout centuries and throughout thousands of years but I'll send my son as a sacrifice and then whoever believes in him I'll let them live in heaven one day and that was God's kind of backup plan or that was his response to the devil's move and the devil's like move and says check and then God thinks about it for a while and moves and says Checkmate that's not how it worked as soon as the devil made his move it was Checkmate on the devil I mean it was game over at that point because that's what God was planning on all along what Satan did in the garden worked out God's predestinated plan and objective and so God has a perfect will he's trying to achieve God has something he's wanting to accomplish and so his part of sending the son was to achieve that desired objective listen to the statement that brother Brandon makes when Divine love is projected to its object Sovereign Grace steps in and produces what is projected when Divine love is projected to its object Sovereign Grace steps in and produces what is projected and if I could put this in a real personal way you are the object of divine love and when Divine love is projected to you as the object Sovereign Grace will step in and produce what is projected and I say be it unto me Lord be it unto me so I I think there's been enough said perhaps to get us to think about the world that is meant here in John chapter 3 verse 16 is different than the world of the humanity and the word the word world in the Greek and as is used in the Bible could be used a collection of any sort you know the world of doomlings or the world of uh Monopoly or something but it says the the world this is one of the uses of it an appropriate and harmonious Arrangement or Constitution order or government so a world is a an apt Arrangement a harmonious Arrangement or the uh the the the constitution of something the order of something the government of something and that's used the term world could you be used to refer to a government an order a constitution or a harmonious arrangement of something you with me I feel like I just opened up a book of different languages or something everybody's like um what harmonious it's an appropriate Arrangement something apt and there's order and there's Harmony and this word is translated to adorning in the scripture which is an ornament or decoration an adornment so it's a so whereas it says for God so loved the world that word world there is translated to adorning in the Bible for God so loved the adorning there's so there's something some arrangement some Constitution and so it would speak of like the adorning there would be like the arrangement of stars as the ornaments of the heaven or the ornament of Heaven it's a constitution it's a particular arrangement in order and that's a world of something in First Peter chapter three now this is where I'm just wanting to dive deep now follow me First Peter chapter 3 verses three and four speaking of the woman who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable so this is something Eternal and everlasting even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price so if we read that and we translated this Cosmos to to or Cosmos if we translated it to World it says whose World let it not be the outworld world of planning and wearing and putting on who's adorning whose World let it not be the outward world of the of the physical things but let the world be but let it let the adorning be the World hidden in your heart let the ornament be that hidden part in your heart so it's a hidden world of the heart that the Bible says is precious and valuable in God's eyes we put so much on this part right so much on the pretense the look and what other people think and there's so much competition that goes on how we present ourselves and what we do and the pictures we take and what we share and the vacations we go on and everything is just it's almost so interesting I just I I want to go to Paloma Park on a regular basis and just find a table of a bunch of homeschool moms or women that are pushing their little buggies that have babies and just sit and listen to the cattiness yeah well mine only has one diaper a day and it's cloth you know and it's been passed down from 500 Generations George Washington used it and it's just like everyone's just trying to one-up one another and and it's so much competition and so much talk oh you're going to Disneyland on vacation well we're renting out Disney World so whatever you do don't go on June 16th because it closed we've got it locked down right in the middle of pride month and so there's this outward part that everyone's concerned about and it's that world and he said don't don't Adorn yourself let your world not be the outward world but let your world be the world the hidden man of the heart the the world of a Meek and quiet Spirit the world that is in God's eyes very valuable I think this is kind of a this is a revelation and an element in this scripture that's that's not that's not often seen because we might just say well don't worry about how you do your hair but just be meek and quiet but it's actually speaking to a world that's more precious to God than even someone who's just quiet the world the word that's used for World Cosmos comes from kameo which means to tend for to care for and camiso which is also also means to take up in order to care for and Preserve so Paul Peter is saying let your world not be the outward world where you have the cares of this world as Jesus refers to it so you have a world of man's doing that he cares about that he's concerned about that he cares for so what world speaks of something that you take up and you try to preserve something you tend to something you try to facilitate something you're looking out after and so here's the world of the outward nature the world of outward things the world of the flesh the world of the eyes and the and the lust and all those different things that's the one world that's the world that's condemned but there's another world that God sees and that he values the world he loves and wants to redeem is the world of John 3 16. it's the one he cares for that word there uh Co comizo speaks of taking up it has elements of redemption to take up to 10 for to preserve and to care and so we're always we're constantly trying to pick up this flesh pick up this world pick up the politics pick up the pretense pick up all the outward part but there's a world that God loves that he wants to redeem and so that loved world is a harmonious arrangement it's a specific order it's a government a constitution that God values there's the adorning of the outward man there's the world of the outward man but there's a hidden man of the heart there's a hidden world that God loves there's a hidden world that God values that's the world that God loves and this I hope this doesn't seem to be too too much of a quick of a shift here but I want to look at Genesis chapter 1 verse 31 and and this will be my transition in the beginning when God created the Heaven and the Earth and he built this great beautiful Eden that's the world that God loved it represents something in there it has such Rich meaning to us and I found I found myself I guess I'll say this in a way just asking for your prayers but there's things that I that it may just be me but there seems to be so much inspiration behind it but I'm so desirous to preach things maybe that I haven't preached before things that are opening up to me in a greater way and a higher level and there's this drive and this desire to want to minister on those things and I find that God keeps moving me back to things I say this that are so practical and in that I find myself saying that's sufficient because my goal is not to have awesome Sunday mornings my goal is to have even better Monday mornings that's what that's what I want for our church that that teaching and preaching is not to build a climax for one awesome Saturday once a year during our convention and you're thinking when is that I don't know let's talk about it but it's not to build that kind of climax but our climax I want our climaxes to be on what the world calls hump day we're like no this is Peak day like I've just been riding this riding this Trail and I'm going to go to church on Wednesday night and I'm going to get another bump and and that's what I and I realized that God at least as he's dealing with my heart is giving us tools that are so practical that if you don't look at this as an opportunity to have your ears itched you can get something out of this you can get a lot out of this and so I find myself coming back a lot to Genesis chapter one and in the beginning because God is manifesting something not mysterious and deep in the way that ooh that was great that's really rich but it's practical for us to understand what God is doing in the time we're living in now and so it says in Genesis 1 31 and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and it says the evening in the morning were the sixth day and it says in verse 2 that the the heavens and the Earth were finished so God has done creating he has done bringing forth his creation and he's and he says it is very good and we recognize from the scripture that six other times he has said it's good it was good it was good it was pleasant it's agreeable it this is excellent but now it's very excellent and so there's something being expressed in this that when God finishes creating he sees something that's exceedingly pleasing so this is God's this is not revealing all of God's heart but it shows something further in God's desire to say now that I've brought this forth I see something very pleasing to me and it's important for us whether you would accept that man and the woman existed as separate entities at this point or he's looking at man and woman as one regardless whatever's represented in that God sees the potential of it and God in looking at it says this is this is very good not because this not because he's done and he's ready to leave it to itself and just visit in the evenings for Fellowship but he sees something that's now reflecting it's something in his desire and so God in the beginning as we've looked at this in the past he's planting the seeds of his great plan Eden is the place of God's Delight it's a his pleasure it's a place of Happiness it's a place of joy and so as he creates and he creates this world and he puts the man there and he puts them in there to till the garden it's in this canvas that God is painting a picture of what's in his heart that we can say well this is this is representative of something inside of him and if God is creating a world and he's being deliberate about it he's been intentional it's not just throwing it out there and things are just kind of sticking and things are unfolding but he's very intentional brother Branham when he's preaching in Arizona he speaks about the in the power of transformation The Great Master of all intelligence he had in his mind what he wanted to do and he refers to the trailer park in Prescott he says when you Brethren designed this park uh how you'd make it was in your mind you kept working that Vision out he said that's the way God did about the world he worked it was in his mind now when we use the phrase that God's thought that it exists first and his mind is a thought and then the word is a thought expressed I I think that we have a tendency to associate God's Thoughts with our thoughts when the Bible clearly says they're not right so when he says my thoughts are not like your thoughts don't don't think of it this way we're like oh God must be wanting to go to Rito's today and I really want to go to PF Changs that that's not the your thoughts are different right you ever seen the the little one single panel cartoon where the cowboy says to the other and he goes Do You Hear What I Hear and the other couple goes no I Hear What I Hear and so it's in that way that God's thoughts are different and ours and that they're completely different it's not that he's thinking about something you're not thinking about it's that his thoughts are completely different so God is not just over there like us who just we're just thought receptors and we're kind of like where'd that come from and we just have all sorts of crazy ideas and and they always come right when we lay our head down on our pillow right and we're going to bed and our spouse wants to go to sleep Nelson says did you ever think about this did you ever think about that you're like I'm trying not to that's how we think but God's thoughts are not our thoughts so when you think of God's thoughts don't think in terms of just things that are entering in his mind think about well there's maybe a lot of thoughts and thinks in here you should form the representation in your thoughts that God's thoughts are what he is meditating on God's thoughtfulness because they're substance to his thoughts and so when God begins to create creation is not just his thoughts expressly I'm thinking of a bunny rabbit and I'm thinking of stars no it's God creation it's God's Eternal contemplation what God thinks about what he meditated on what his mind revolved around it was God's Eternal contemplations and thoughts coming into existence so now if you could look at this statement with me I believe I have the from God's power to transform this is very important for us to grab a hold of these words only in the sense of what I'm trying to express to you today really hinges on this says in the Garden of Eden was God's economy of Innocence so this is used in a language I think that is precise for a reason when he creates and he places man in the East of Eden in a garden this is God's economy and it's an economy of innocence and that was one of the dispensations so now he carves out economy and dispensation the first dispensation was innocence and you'll find those two phrases are obviously connected people knew no sin they didn't know anything about Sin both Adam and Eve were naked but they were hid from their nakedness by a spirit Veil over their face that's that perfect love this is something that's covering them this is something that they're dwelling in this is something they understand everything had the right context and never nothing was misunderstood where if you would if they could have beheld them without understanding they'd be like why are you doing that but with perfect love there's this understanding there's this confidence there's this trust and so it says in the Garden of Eden or the Garden of Eden was God's economy of Innocence the world that God created is his economy which means Arrangement or mode of operation it's a system of interaction so when we think about economics or economies today and whatever that scale might be in whatever way that you understand it this is what God had produced he had produced an economy an arrangement a way of operating a way of interacting in a way of transacting this was God's perfect world I hear an economy he had participants in the economy I'm sure there's some to some degree maybe an economist that can show what the supply and demand was and and how everything was working and what this is how God had arranged all of it so it's God's economy of Innocence but then he says then he says the first dispensation and this word dispensation in the Greek that's used in the Bible is the same word that we get economy from in our English so it's the same word that he's looking at and a dispensation scripturally is a distinctive arrangement in order to fulfill God's purpose so a dispensation is the way that God orders events uh to and in the world to accomplish his will so if there's a dispensation we say well there's a dispensation of this there's a dispensation of that you have to if you're going to understand the dispensation you have to ask yourself what is God trying to accomplish so when you so you have to recognize in the end time in the Rapture message brother Bram says we're changing dispensations then you have to understand God's objective is changing and that's why you have a change in dispensation Satan does not determine the corner that's turned Satan does not determine the change in dispensation when God when God's objective has been fulfilled and there's another one to fulfill God begins to order events and Affairs and allow things to happen so that that dispensation could come into effect in order for God to fulfill his plan so there's God's economy of Innocence God's economy his dispensation it's God's ordering of the world and events to accomplish his will a dispensation is God's plan of management a plan of administration a dispensing dispensation he's dispensing things he's laying things out he's allocating things in order to do something to accomplish his will so in Satan's Eden brother Branham says having faith in all his word his seeds brought an Eden of Holiness love and eternal life that's what that economy was Holiness love eternal life that's what God's Eden produced holiness and it brought an Eden of holiness of love understanding Perfection and eternal life this is the world that God loves he loves an eternal world he he loves holiness to understand the Perfection the world that God loved it's embodied in in the beginning when God creates the heavens and the Earth and his thoughtfulness begins to unfold and it's not just whatever comes in his mind comes out into creation but that which was Central to himself and and I I kept this next statement in there even though it deserves much more attention but think of having faith in his own word he brought forth an Eden of Holiness then he says that's what God is planting his word his seed what he is planting that's what his church will be at the end it'll be the same thing so do you recognize how that God is ordering this he's saying that in the beginning God's word brought forth the world that he loved and he says and these are those are my words obviously he says the church in the end will be the same thing she is going to be his garden that which he takes up and cares for the the reserving of Life the cultivating the raising up the causing to be fruitful whatever Eden represented in the end the bride is going to fulfill the potential of Eden [Music] she she becomes that restored Eden just as she's referred to as the restored Eve Amen brother Branham I thought I had the statement here realizing now that I don't have it he said they were safe in God's Pavilion in the secret of his Pavilion he'll hide me for those of you who love to do Bible studies God's Pavilion a pavilion is a large stately tint for habitation Glory he's going to hide them they were safe in God's Pavilion it was safe in God's tent the stately tent maybe like a cathedral someplace God is wanting to hide his elect he said they had perfect love perfect understanding the love of God in that place he says everything's in Perfect Harmony just speaking about the garden God in harmony with this creature and the creature in harmony with his maker this is the world a harmonious Arrangement a constitution an order a government this is this is what God likes Unity Harmony our code this this Mutual dependency everything in Perfect Harmony God in harmony with this creature creature and harmony with his maker in another place he said they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God God and his family was one this is the world that God loved that Harmony that interaction a work for Adam to do the supply that God gave them the help me that God gave him and the woman this is God looking down and seeing all of his word faith in his seeds that bring everything forth and here he is the word being fulfilled the word being fulfilled everything's happening this is what God loves Harmony Arrangement Unity everything being related to one another and complimenting one another in that Arrangement and I I don't mind if you allow your thoughts to kind of expand on this a little bit after I say it but in this God wasn't looking at a hierarchy he was looking at everything in harmony then as long as everyone was in their place they're all hip to hip right they're all working together they're all seeing eye to eye standing shoulder to shoulder this this is a harmonious Arrangement there's no one in God's kingdom everything is working in order together brother Bram says in power of transformation there was Adam and Eve Walking In the Garden of Eden every seed bringing forth it never could do nothing else it never could do nothing else because God said let it be that way it had to be that way that's the world that God loves his word being fulfilled his word coming to pass that God planting seed the joy of planting seed the joy of seeing it come to fruit the Bible says there's nothing better for a man than to enjoy the fruits of his labor so here's God he's labored he's created he's rested now it's time for God to reap the benefits of his labor now what he's always been thoughtful of is expressed now God's thoughts can unfold this is this is the world that God loved but God planned it that it would be interrupted right we know that that when Satan worked out what was necessary for the plan of God In the Garden of Eden when Satan worked that out but God wants to show the picture real quick I think the young people do something where they take their phone and they show you something real quick and try to try to guess what it is well this is this is this is God almost doing that for us like look at this it's going to leave it's going to go but I want you to remember it because it's going to change and so brother Branham says it had to be that way let me stop he says oh how I'd like to stop here just a minute to say there is where we're facing yet the completion of that word I know we've ministered on this a number of times and maybe the majority of us weren't here when we begin to preach on this in the beginning when this church was started but he's saying where we are today go back to the beginning that's what we're finishing that's what we're finishing is what was started then so there's something to the thought that God is wanting to redeem back what was lost this condition in the Garden of Eden this perfect harmony the harmony between the father and the son is expressed in Christ God wants that Harmony between the bride and Christ his brother Brandon says in the sermon Christ is the mystery God revealed I'd highly recommend this sermon as being one to go through and listen to right now during this season he's talking about the threefold purpose of God's mystery is revealed makes sense revealed God manifest in Christ manifests in the church notice this next statement in order to redeem the Lost Eve back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden so this is what God is wanting to accomplish through this great Revelation is to bring us back to the world that God loved I know I'm putting that in a language that that serves my the the series on love and you say well that's kind of self-serving but I'm wanting you to recognize the nature of God's love because there might be parts of us that say well I I understand election I understand God's word can never fail I understand that God will prove his word and the word will never pass away we have all these things that we understand but then when it comes to God's love we kind of just put that in some sort of temporary stator in the middle and we we're either subject to it or we're not we're subject to it or not I'm wanting you to somehow be able to tie it all to get begin to tie it all together and see how it all harmonizes that God's love projected towards you is the object is Sovereign Grace is going to step in and produce what is projected and so in the beginning God brought forth an Eden of Holiness and of love and eternal life and God showed it and expressed it and manifested in Adam and the woman and here's this world that God loves and he does he does it knowing that it's not not going to stay in that state forever but knowing that what love is going to do since that's a world it's an order it's a harmonious Arrangement it has with it the meaning to take up and to care for and to tend to and preserve so even if that world failed God knew he'd pick it back up again and restore back the original condition of the Garden in Eden his brother Graham says in that sermon restore the kingdom to its rightly position so in Genesis 1 1 it says in the beginning God created that's that's heart driven thought driven purpose focused it's not just a whim it's not just you know God was you know the angels are just giving God a hard time says you're not spontaneous enough you're always planning everything he says watch this and just created something and like oh my goodness there's chaos going on down there he's like well maybe we shouldn't leave it like that God is purposeful he's thinking about he's thinking through it and then God in the beginning created that Bara that is to create to shape and deform it's the manifestation of God's thoughts his thoughtfulness his heart's desire his eternal thoughts and we and when I say that again I remind you his thoughts aren't like our thoughts they are Eternal they have substance they have form so it's something that he's thoughtful about it has something to do with his heart there's times when he says you know I was thinking about this and we're like you want to do this like no I was just thinking about it right because you're just expressing a thought this is a crazy idea and it's like you really want to do that seriously you know that's against the lawn like I just fought it it's not in my heart it's not who I am it's not at my core God's not like that his thoughts are his heart his heart says and they're Eternal and what was it brother random told us about that he says if you can see this you will see many things if you can see what God's thoughts are in and and how they're different than ours and how it's something that's at the core of who he is and a thought is a word expression say logos is the expression of the thoughts of God and what's in his heart then you realize that's what has been internalized is now externalized and that's the substance of who God is so his thoughts represent who he is because as God thinks in his heart so is he the Bible says in Jeremiah 10 12 he made the Earth by his power he established the World by his wisdom his thoughtfulness his thinking and stretched out the heavens by his discretion it's all connected to and tied to what's in his heart and so we've been kind of hinting at this the world that God loved it's reflected in the beginning but this world changes in Genesis chapter 3. I hope that we've been going through this at just in just the right measure so that this can form kind of a full thought here and the only not negative feedback I got on Wednesday night is that I need to preach longer this morning because Wednesday night was only 45 minutes and I know some of you are thinking of all the ones I miss it was that good and you know it the world that God loves is if I could say it's in seed form in Genesis 1. Genesis 2. but everything changes in Genesis 3. and I'm substantial again this is foundational so there's something that kind of leaves you hanging a little bit I trust by God's grace we'll be able to come and connect some things together but look at Genesis chapter 3 with me I want to read verses 14 to 16. this is after the fall of Man in that they've the ACT has been accomplished man has already tried to run and hide from God he's tried to cover himself the blame game has started uh Adam blames his wife and the wife's like I didn't know we had this game she blames the serpent and now God's going to judge and this everything's changing right now and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life that's a curse upon the serpent now this is a very interesting statement right in the middle of this and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed clearly clearly ties back to the sin between thy seed and her seed or the seed of the woman and it the seed of the woman shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his the seated woman his Hill so that says this is he's cursing The Serpent and as he's cursed the serpent he just says something that it's it's mysterious I'll put empty hatred between thee and the woman I'll put hatred between thy seed your mix seed the mongrelizing of human blood and the pure seed the seed of the woman and it's going to crush your head Paul revisits this theme in Romans and brings even out greater Revelation to it he says but you're going to bruise his heel and it speaks of the death of Christ now he says unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply by sorrow and thy conception and Saul Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shalt be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so now he has spoken to the serpent the woman and upon them too was the curse upon those that were animate could talk because the next curse is not upon Adam himself but upon the world upon the Earth the nature the elements of the Earth and if I could just use these terms maybe to create some sort of anticipation there's such a remarkable transition here as we read this this is there's a transformation that occurs and I think we could just easily miss the significance say Yep they're being cast out of the garden because then in a few more statements he he puts a uh the the Chairman's there with flaming swords to guard the way of life and the man cannot make it because if they find that tree of life and partake of it they'll eat and live forever so there's more to be unfolded and so as we see this scene and we kind of read it chronologically God says you're cursed you're cursed the Earth is cursed you guys get out of here he dresses him and Landscapes kicks him out of the garden and they're walking away and God says all right that's it you guys guard this and we see it is all over but something what's transpired here is a great shift and brother Branham in the sermon marriage and divorce says now notice now notice now after the beginning after the beginning After Time began he says back in that was eternity is over and I know the way it said if you're if you're looking at this I think this will make a great homeschool project for those of you who are doing whatever program still diagram sentences this would be a fun one to do after the beginning after the beginning After Time began back in that was eternity is over underline the subject Circle the verb now eternity so he's looking at something that you have the beginning and after the beginning eternity is over so while they're in the beginning they're still eternity you catch that so he says after the beginning which was still had an eternal quality to it once that's over he says after the fall that fall was made by Eve after the fall there was need to be another covenant made it makes a few more statements then he reads Genesis chapter 3 verses 14 to 16. and as soon as he's done reading verse 16 he's read 14 15 and 16. the curse to the serpent the curse to the woman he says two Covenants he says now that closes the beginning of what Jesus says it wasn't so at the beginning we got another Covenant now it's another Covenant now instead of maybe just chasing that down right now and looking at that notice what brother branham's identifying when Jesus says from the beginning it wasn't so in the beginning was eternity and then now after the fall after God has cursed those Serpent and cursed the woman that's the end of the beginning that Jesus was referring to and because that was the end of God's dispensation that's the end of God's economy it required a different Arrangement it required a different economy there quite a different constitutional Arrangement so he says it's another Covenant another Covenant means an agreement or Union it means to come together a covenant is a binding seal under under the under the law a marriage is a covenant and so you had one Covenant in the beginning which is which is under this in the world that God loved I hope this I hope that makes some sense I'm not saying you have to say Amen to agree with it you can say well I don't agree but I know exactly what you're saying and that'll be fine with me because I just want to be able to get this point across the world that was in the beginning brother says in the beginning he says after the beginning eternity is over when does that start it starts after this Covenant another Covenant is introduced and that's an agreement it's a new world it's a new economy it's a new order but this so when we what I want you to recognize then is that means the original Covenant is no longer in its original state because now it's a new government it's a new world it's a new set of circumstances God has spoke to the serpent he's actually changing his his physical makeup he's going to be crawling on the ground the woman she's going to have to bring forth children in sorrow not as God had originally contemplated Adam's not going to be able to just speak to anything and bring forth until the ground the way it was originally envisioned now he's gonna have to fight with the Earth it's a new set of rules it's a new covenant we'll get into it more later but God's covenant it's what is what's lost here in Psalms 25 14 The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him and he will show them his Covenant the Lord's Secret the Lord's heart was lost with the Covenant because it says the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him to use the term fear evokes images of a marriage relationship in a marriage covenant where there's the love and respect that exists between the two the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him the secret means familiar Converse or intimacy it's that familiarity and intimacy the secret the intimacy of the Lord is within the fear and he will show he will show them his Covenant why because under that Covenant there's intimacy and that word there even comes from covenant comes from barah which comes back to in the beginning the creation so with the introduction of another Covenant a different Covenant now exists a different Arrangement or Union a different coming together now man to the woman have to be arranged a certain way man to Creation has to be arranged a certain way you realize in the beginning creators in harmony with the Creator the created in harmony with the other created Adam has dominion over all everything working in harmony everyone would obey Adam Adam could control nature The Lion and the lamb walk together brother man describes how beautiful and perfect it was that's that's the way it was in God's world there's no animosity there's no death there was no sorrow there was no bleeding there was no destruction this is a beautiful world and now God says I've got to change everything a different covenants being evoked and God's using symbolic language in a lot of ways here and some very literal language but he's trying to represent everything you knew about that world has now been turned on its head and you have different relationships to each other you have a different relationship to the animals I know Adam you're going to want to go run and talk to Leo you might not want to do that he may not see you the same way anymore because now you're meat to him the ground's not going to bring forth the the grain that you thought it would so easily you're gonna have to fight with it because a different order and Arrangement exists but right in the middle of all this and save your yawns for lunch because I'm almost done right in the middle of all this Genesis 3 15. and I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt Bruce his Hill between 14 and 16 God comes right in with 15. right in the middle of the end of the beginning right right in the middle of it curse curse promise right in the middle it may seem like you curse to the serpent but it's actually a promise because the only begotten son of Genesis 3 16 is the Fulfillment of Genesis 3 15. he is the seed of the woman referring to her seed brother bam said the Christ who came by the instrumentality of God apart from Human intercourse the seed is Christ the seed of the woman and what is it that causes God In This Moment he's cursed in the serpent he's in the next moment going to curse the woman but before because notice this his first curse is to The Serpent and God's love required consequences for their disobedience but God's not wanting them to end completely in ruin if he's going to do that he would have killed Adam he would have killed that woman he would have started all over and he would start a new creation but God and his great plan said there's a consequence for what you've done love requires consequences love it it has it has to abide by certain parameters so there's going to be consequences but before he curses the woman or the Earth and Adam as a consequence of that he prophesies for God so loved the world before he even begin to breathe out the cursings he intervenes at a time of punishment as a time of judgment he's not going to leave them without a promise to look to not going to leave them without Redemption it's that seed of the woman that caused Satan to be watching for a son to come forth it was always watching for that one it's the one that Adam looked for it's one that they all look for why because God had promised it and so notice how brother Bradham dramatizes this and I'm just going to read several statements that I don't have in a slide for you but brother bam just dramatizes it so well and I'll just try to I'll try to pick up I just have some statements here when he he begins to kind of characterize and add some color to Genesis 3 15. but the way that brother Branham dramatizes what's happening is the first thing that he begins to express is that God slew the lamb or there was a slain of the lamb and there was a dressing of Adam and the woman in bloody lambskins and then he says you leave and never come back these are just my words summarizing how he's saying it he says and there I could see Adam put his arm around his sweetheart and talks about how much he loved her and she blazed his head on his shoulder and they begin to walk and he describes that slapping sound of those bloody skins beating against the thighs of Adam and as he's walking and he's and he's sad and they don't they're fearful they don't know what the future holds they're being chased out of this beautiful world everything is changed in that moment it's then that brother Branham says that something inside of God couldn't stand to see his lovely family walking out like that and even though love required that they leave because remember had Adam always stayed in the garden and never fell he would have never known God and if we were to come by the original way that we would contemplate we would have all come forth in the beginning we all would have never known God you would probably even not even know him as well as you do now but God it required in order for God to be fully known man had to take he had he a loud man on that path and man took it and his man begins to walk out the love of God said no wait the way brother Bram describes it says God he covered all space and time and he and he describes it all these other places he fills everything he says but in that moment God bottled himself up if you could if you could let your mind imagine how that brother Brown's trying to describe this this is the god without boundaries this is a God that fills all time and space and then exists in eternity there's really no parameters for him but in that moment all of a sudden God goes and he forms himself into a funnel and he says that God who covered all time in space bottled down to four little letters l o v e love he could not see a child depart from him I could hear him say wait just a minute Adam I'll put enmity between the woman's seed and the serpent seed her Hill shall bruise his head and his head shall bruise her Hill promising a savior as they're being banished it's the way brother interjection the serpents the woman are leaving the garden they're under this condemnation they're experiencing emotions they've never felt before but brother bear says he loved them so well until he couldn't see them go what moves God In This Moment what moves God to speak Genesis 3 15. what's at the heart of Genesis 3 15. John 3 16. then I could see all the great spaceless eternity come forming down like a funnel again God is describing brother Brown is describing God now for just taking himself and love bringing them into this shape in this form and he says he finals himself to four little letters l-o-v-e he loved his children so much till he couldn't turn them away then I hear him say stop I'll put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed promising a redeemer god making preparation to redeem this world that's being lost this Eden that's being closed off to you hold on my love will redeem it he's promising a savior promise and a redeemer what what attribute of God is being expressed in this moment love he says in another place I can see all that great space begin to move together like this can you imagine this how are you saying this God that fills all time and space it's almost like a hurricane something coming together falling together he says down to a final shape like that in a move right down as he began to eye in that little couple going down through the Garden of Eden bloody skins flopping against their legs he couldn't stand it and it moved down oh it moved down to the very Heart Of God spelling o l o v e God so loved this is the connection to Genesis Genesis 3 15 to John 3 16. for God so loved the world that he promised the seed of the woman for God so loved the world that Adam and the woman were leaving that he promised the seed of the woman for God so loved the world he didn't leave him without Redemption he just couldn't see them go he called back to them I'm going to put enmity between your seed and Satan's seed so Genesis 3 15 is the prophecy of the only begotten son to redeem you say the original Eden the original Covenant the original World the original intimacy the original arrangement so God's covenant world of perfect love is redeemed through Jesus Christ in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says but Jesus was God's love and revelation to let to let know to a predestinated seed that he had called you he says he was that great attribute of God this may be maybe in Satan's Eden he was that great attribute of God Called Love he was the heart of God he is a revelation of God's love God's love and Revelation to the predestinated seed this is what Jesus this is what's promised in Genesis 3 15. this is what's revealed in Jesus Christ then I ask you what about the revelation of Jesus Christ in the last days what is what is it what is the revealing of the son of man is it is it just distinctive theology so I'm going to say oh oh so you believe God sent a prophet well I believe that God sent a prophet revealed the son of man so that's where we're different it's that's I mean that's just that's just language at that point that that kind of understanding just becomes a quote War and it just my stack beats your stack well you did it in 14 point fun hey they're just printing out quotes he's got bigger quotes this Restoration in the last days back to the Garden of Eden condition cannot come without a revelation of Jesus Christ brother Brown says in the invisible unit of the church the bride to Christ that messenger is here now which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever who is that messenger it's the messenger of the Covenant what condition does he reveal himself in Revelations 10 1 with a rainbow upon his head why because he's the angel of the covenant What covenant not the Covenant that was established in Genesis 3 16. not another covenant not the Covenant after the beginning but it's back to the original Covenant again he said now when I come back down the little book open it's what Adam lost it's not church history it's not the church ages it's it's not just tying up the loose ends of the church ages but it's a restoration back of the world that God loved and that could not come without the very Heart Of God being revealed so brother Branham takes it in Christ is a mystery in the last days when this great mystery that God had in his heart is being revealed listen it's a revelation this is the mystery that God ahead in his heart that if now we say it's the back part of God's mind that's just a figure of speech that tells us this is something hidden deep within the God but it was the revelation of the great mystery that he had in his heart heart purpose heart desire deliberate it's l-o-v-e it's love amen and I say this this isn't just for itching ears this is as practical as anything you've ever heard God did this God's done this it's emphasized over and over you listen to the sermons that lead up to Christ is the mystery that lead up to to souls in prison now that then unfold to the next two two uh so years and you realize this is God wanting to make himself known through his elect it's to bring the Fruit of the Spirit the living reality of all of God's promises in the elect that's what it's for brother Branham it says this in paragraph 102 of the church excuse me of Christ is the mystery God revealed now God's secret mystery he had before the world began back in the back part of God's mind there was something he's trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed and that's what he it's God being very deliberate he has a motive he has an objective he has something he wants to accomplish something he wants to achieve he hasn't fully achieved it in the beginning but the elements are there the reflection is there and he's wanting to he's wanting to bring forth something that is a love story so he says in a couple little few statements later so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love and now this is where I want you to find your part even if he doesn't say it in him was to be a father in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a Healer in him was to be a daughter in him was to be a sister in him was to be a wife in him was to be a Sunday school teacher an architect God forbid a lawyer in him was all these desires right in him were things that he wanted to express attributes that he wanted to express he says in all these great attributes which you are that we see already expressed they were in God so this is when we read it again it's not the denominational view of this is God's backup plan for everyone to be saved but God in his mind in his deep within his heart love had an image love had a name love had a had an arrangement and you're part of that you were what God was thinking about you or what was on his mind your your the thoughts of God it's his thinking in terms of his meditation what drives him what motivates him we say what were you thinking you were what I was thinking you were what I was thinking what does that even mean you you're what I was thinking I don't have this statement there and I don't know if I'll get to the paragraph 93 but I just felt impressed to add this one in this morning and I'd already sent the slides yesterday says notice next secondly the manifested Christ in you the hope of glory threefold purpose of Christ God fully manifested Christ have premance in the church in order to bring back Eden right and there's this expression this thing that he's wanting to bring forth and he says that great manifested God in Christ now Christ manifested in you what was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer what was once in God's heart is now in your heart what was once his constant thought his constant thinking that's what he wants in you and that's what perfect love is when that fills up your whole heart not half of it not three quarters but when that fills up your whole heart when the mind of Christ raises up and has preeminence in you oh what he is now this mystery his heart that was in his heart that was in Christ is now in the hearts of the Believers the body of Christ what was once what was God's once great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest because the bride had risen up a dispensation change it's not it's not the Pentecostal age not even allowed to seeing age right so glad I'm amongst friends today it's the bright age and in that age it's uniting time different dispensation different Administration eighth Messengers want to keep you in the seventh age right so they can be the god to you they can be the kingdom to you the king the prince the Messiah the eighth messenger but if you ever recognize the new dispensation in the new Administration you realize the son of man the son of man is the headship to the kingdom the revelation of Jesus Christ is our headship it's a sign that the Rapture is at hand it's a sign we turn to Corner and what was once in God's heart is now in our hearts it tells us that the world is changing that this world that God loves is coming back and you're a part of it do you believe that you're a part of it for God so loved the world musicians if you'd come as you're coming making your way I'll read this last statement from Christ is the mystery God revealed he's praying before he preaches and remember he's going to say that he says this he he opens by saying that this mystery that God had in his mind before the world began there was something he's trying to achieve he had attributes that he wanted to be expressed in him was love and and he visits the theme of love a few times during this service and and I don't think that we need to try to force everything into the Paradigm and the nomenclature of love and perfect love but it's Christ it's the word of God and so knowing what he has to say of how it's all in those last days when this great mystery that God had his heart has been revealed and how Jesus was God's love and Revelation to the predestinated sea that he's called you and he's coming down to the end of that sermon and and the way that he begins to be so descriptive about the devil howling and how the truth is manifested in her and he's bringing that revelation of Christ United with his bride present tense here now revealed himself the prayer he prays and I know that we've read this uh one other time here the prayer he prays to me is so perfect to contextualize what he's saying so that we're not just itching our ears when we hear it but we realize this has practical outworking in our lives this this ought to have this ought to look a certain way in our relationships this ought to look look a certain way in our dealings with one another that we realize that whenever I am to be what was in God's heart was Craig now what was in God's heart is manifesting Christ because Christ is the heart of God he's that perfect reflection of God and now that is in you if that then think of the do the the correct true spiritual math can have brother Preston do it for you if you can't if you can't figure it out but what was being God all that God was he put into Christ this is what brother Brandon uses even though it's not scripture the second part all that Christ was he poured in the church if that was divine love if that was perfect love if Christ was the heart of God then what are you now what Have We Become what are a further manifestation of that heart brother random even calls in speaking about the Covenant maybe maybe reading the statement here very soon not today relax but that he was the match piece there's two parts to that Covenant you're part of it and this is the prayer that brother Brown and prays and you listen to the Prelude too Christ is the mystery God revealed it's the word of the church stay close together love one another stick close he says keep us together father this is his prayer let the holy spirit guide us and direct us give us a long life of service for you and now Christ is the mystery God revealed this is what this is what his burden is in preaching this give us this great message this morning that we're expecting out of Thy word that it might go to each heart next slide make the lips that speak Lord speak truth make the heart the ears be fertile to receive truth and may it grow into great trees of eternal life to be shiny lights in red Epistles of all men that you know what I think the problem is we've made the message so mysterious we want to keep it mysterious to everyone else yeah I'm a message believer but you wouldn't understand that how about we just live it make people get thirsty for it and start filling up some of the empty chairs that we have let's knock down another wall and it's only going to happen if you live the life if you try to be weird and different and mysterious nobody's going to want it everybody's weird now everybody's a hipster in 2023. and this is what the this is what is what we're Desiring to do as he says Lord May It Go into great trees of eternal life to be Shining Light and red Epistles of all men that's what Christ and the Mystery of God is to be don't keep Christ a mystery reveal them don't keep them a mystery let the Hidden World of your heart be expressed let the love of God be shed abroad in your heart that it might be red of all men in other words Our Lives we've got to put the mystery of Christ in a language that humans can understand they may not agree with it but put it in a language they can understand God living through you breathing through you [Music] to be shining lights and red Epistles of all men they might know that Jesus Christ has raised from the dead and lives Among Us make us so full of love and the fruit of the spirit until other men and women boys and girls can see the results of the Life of Christ still living in US after two thousand years from the great event could you say Granite father to honor thee could you say we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen I want us to be so full of love and the Fruit of the Spirit till it impacts others makes an influence on others for God so loved the world you're part of that world that he loved that world is an economy it's an eternal dispensation one day that'll never end because there was a pause put on eternity in Genesis 3 16. but now what happens when this Elijah comes he comes when there's a blending of time back into eternity in that moment there was a fading out of Eternity in the internet of time but now we're caught up again in that corn that Ark that Keystone of the arch here we are in that dispensation the blending of two dispensations we're going to an eternity it's here we're going in we're taking steps higher every day do you believe that it's not poetic license it's it's not just words that we sound a little bit funny to the the the the Seventh-day Adventist or the the fundamentals out there no it's just true [Music] it's just the reality that we're living in and I don't want it to be hid I want it not just to be hit in my heart I want it to be lived just as he lived it let's stand today [Music]
