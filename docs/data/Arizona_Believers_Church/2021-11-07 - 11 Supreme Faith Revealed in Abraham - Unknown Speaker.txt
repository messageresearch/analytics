TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 17 we're going to begin with verse 1 and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abraham fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant very important phrase everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee unto thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art to stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god amen god bless you can have your seats we've been in the subject of supreme faith revealed in hebrew abraham and looking at it from the standpoint that the life of abraham tells our testimony we're not just reading about the events in abraham's life but yet it speaks to us it tells a testimony to us from his election to the perfect expression of his faith a supreme expression of his faith on mount moriah from faith to perfect faith we can see ourselves in the journey of abraham and brother branham even makes the statement that when god called abraham out of er that was the beginning of christianity so we ought to be able to begin to see ourselves in the life of abraham and i realized it and it's actually it was just something that kind of gripped me right before i came out that um i don't take this the wrong way but oh no what's my point and um and i realized that kind of just in a moment had forgot that really this is foundational and that it builds on the things that we have been ministering and that uh we're wanting you to see yourself in the life of abraham so there's a lot of things i'm trying like like kind of what i mentioned before sometimes i just try to get all the lumber laid out and then i'll put it all together in upcoming services there's a lot of principles i'm wanting to put out there to share with you so it's kind of in the middle you think brother aaron it's part 11 how could this be foundational wanting to look at it from a different vantage point or just another take another step in this and but it's important to relate personally to the story of abraham and relate personally to the things that god has preserved in his word because they're preserved for our benefit and not for a bedtime story uh not to just have kind of a knowledge of history and exercise our minds but it really is for our benefit to achieve rapturing faith that these things have been preserved for us and we've been looking at for the last few services how that god called abraham out of babylon and in genesis chapter 11 genesis chapter 12 god is calling abraham out of babylon and we've seen just what a perfect type this is for of the bride of jesus christ especially in the end time and so we see how abraham's life is foreshadowing events in our own life foreshadowing events with the church and that brother branham specifically says what god is showing abraham and what he's doing to abraham he's going to do to his seed after him and i want to take just a few moments to express some principles about babylon in addition to what we had expressed last sunday and even wednesday night uh repeat one thing here a statement from the pergamy in church age chapter 5 of the church age book and just identify a few things so we could kind of orient ourselves today brother braham said monotheism turned to polytheism in babylon so prior to babylon there would have been a word the worship of one god and there would have been some consciousness of a true god and this narrative being passed down from noah and his sons there would have been this familiarity with uh with the one god but yet once babylon begins to take hold and nimrod begins to build cities and the civilization is again taking root that first took root um in the cane seed line the worship of one god turns to multiple gods or false gods and this statement to me is just you know it just hits really really hard right now it's almost as if sometimes you read something in the message like i feel like i've never read that before even though you know you've read that before and it says the devil's lie and the devil's mysteries rose up against the truth of god and the mysteries of god in that city in babel the tower babel in the city thereof and that region there in mesopotamia in that plain of shinar where this tower was built up and this city has been erected it says the devil's mysteries and the devil's lies rise up to oppose the truth of god and the mysteries of god so this is what this city represent this is what this tower represents and so this kingdom begin with nimrod building his kingdom and this takes place after the flood you begin to identify these things in genesis chapter 10. now for and i just want to make reference to this and i feel very good looking out upon the congregation today to be able to make statement statements like this because i'm really building on your your revelation and understanding of some fundamental truths in the word of god but in genesis chapter 11 remember that the entire earth is populated with what we could call a hybrid humanity that it is not it is not pure suns from adam that are inhabiting the earth but there is a mixed blood and there's a mixed seed upon the face of the earth and there's nobody that could take a 23 in me and brag over the other person because they're all by one blood through noah's sons have spread out over the earth in other words there's no pure descendants of seth there's no direct descendants of adam but all have come from noah's sons and coming from noah's sons they're all this is this mixed blood it's a mixed humanity of cain's line and seth's line and it's been completely mixed over and so it's important to kind of identify how that abraham now exists within this culture and this climate and he's one of this massive humanity a massive gentiles we could say in nations and and another part is kind of like i just want that to kind of stand there on on its own just recognizing that kind of see the full uh sweeping over of the sin that began in the garden and now it's taken root uh in a mixed humanity and it's weakened the nations is a phrase that the bible uses and in genesis chapter 10 and verse 11 we see that satan is building his eden with this fallen humanity with this mixed blood and he's be and it's right here in this land of shine arts it's in this babylon and it's in this region that is being zeroed in on and genesis chapter 10 and 11. and so this is just again a simple concept of satan building his eden and something is transpiring at this time of genesis chapter 10 genesis chapter 11 genesis chapter 12. now just ponder the role of satan in this in second corinthians chapter 4 verse 4 it says in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them paul calls satan the god of this world so it's it's identifying some dominion some power some influence that he has we know he's not the god he's not the creator but he is a perverter of creation and as such he has become the god of this evil age he's become we know that this is satan's eden that we're living in now and jesus even speaks in john 12 31 now is the judgment of this world now the prince of this world be cast out so jesus identifying lucifer satan as the prince of this world the god of this world as paul says it again a writing in ephesians chapter 2 verse 2 where in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air this is the god of this world the the prince of this world the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so this is what we see even in genesis chapter 10 in genesis chapter 11 the spirit of the prince of the power of the air we see this course of the world again gaining this quick momentum because it's remarkable to think that god had just destroyed the world because of their sin and their debauchery and then post flood and post-destruction of the world very quickly gets right back into the same frame of mind wherein they're they're the imagination of man is only evil continually and they're wanting to build a city and they're motivated to bypass judge god's judgments and they're working against the plan of god in the will of god and so what we see in the beginning in genesis 10 and 11 this initiating and beginning this building of babylon and then we know how it sweeps through and we see babylon being very instrumental in the judgment of israel after they became a nation in the old testament and then we see that it turns into a papal babylon and there's a spiritual babylon and then there's this babylon that spiritually that's fighting against the church and against the bride and the scripture even calls it mystery babylon so there's this association of babylon with the agenda of satan and the working of satan whether it be in the natural or the spiritual and we know that the time that we're living in now is the climax of satan's eden like this is where satan is like hey i got it right this is it this is what i've been trying to achieve and brother bennett makes this statement god pronounced in genesis where satan's seat was and that was in babylon it's always been satan's seat now i know that in our minds when we think of a seat we want to we want to we want to know that there's a literal seat somewhere so we think of a literal babylon geographical locations a certain borders a zip code an area code can i use ways to get there and we want to and we think there's a literal seat but here we're just talking about a figurative seat that is in a way that there's this place where his power resides and it's not just over there between the tigris and euphrates river somewhere in iraq where satan is this is now a spiritual babylon the whole world is a babylon now his religion his mindset his influence is spread out through the whole world it's remarkable if you begin to read in mythology and you begin to read in different religions and whether it be uh buddhism or hinduism and all in all sorts of religions of the world you can see that it's been tainted by an influence by the agenda of satan in genesis chapter 10 to spread this this polytheism and this this perversion throughout all the world so it's in and again this is for the context of supreme faith being revealed in abraham and how it influences us and encourages us and helps us to understand the process that god has entered us into in this hour it's god chooses abraham where in er of the chaldeans he's calling him out of babylon and he does it to show us a pattern he does it for abraham and his sake but something's been expressed to us in this great truth of calling abraham out of babylon so this is uh let's maybe kind of summarize it genesis chapter 10 genesis chapter 11 which provides the context for god calling abraham in genesis chapter 12. like if you really want to understand the story of abraham and not just oh god told abraham to move you want to understand what god was calling him away from and what god was expressing what the conditions and the character of that age were and so in those chapters we see the rise of the devil's mystery against the mystery of god and this is what's coming to its preeminence this is what's rising up you could say there's this total blackout of the truth of god so god identifies one man and he calls them out and this is what god is doing to a bride in this hour now just uh maybe reset a little bit and and i'd just like to express it this way that abraham's faith in a lot of ways is mysterious we talked about it before how it could be so mysterious that it becomes legendary and idolized as opposed to something we know that we can achieve ourselves and his journey is mysterious and i believe this is what how god's been dealing with my heart that what struck me when i first began to look into these things recently uh for in this thought not that i've recently just started looking into the life of abraham everybody here anybody hear this guy um or started looking at it again freshly what struck me is man to really understand abraham's faith you want to understand the context of it and you understand what was going on what was happening in this his life that it's not just this legendary faith of this man that one day heard a voice that told him to sacrifice his son and that we all need to be obedient to that voice when it tells us to kill a family member like just do it it's god you just got to do it that this was there was context to the evolution and the growth of abraham's revelation and faith as i began to look at the context being like wow this is very relatable abraham's life is relatable and this is the process that god is putting me through as a man to bring me to my mount mariah my mount zion showdown of rapturing faith and and so i want to be i think in looking at it this context is required i'm getting more context to abraham's faith to just help us to more fully understand our own faith not just abraham's faith and i want to introduce it this way this morning that the mystery of abraham's faith and the mystery of abraham's journey is hidden in genesis chapter one to four that we've kind of looked at you start with genesis 12 to tell abraham's life maybe the end of chapter 11 and then you kind of go all the way to chapter 25 and you're looking at that to understand the faith of abraham but we just took a step back and began to look at the beginning of chapter 11 and realize wow there's a lot more context to the story of abraham than just how did we get here then god calls abraham but the details that god is sharing prior to the story of abraham are very very important and i began to look at the first four chapters of the book of the bible and realize wow this is connecting deeply and directly to the life of abraham because there's many intriguing aspects of his life that cause us to ponder to think and to wonder and hypothesize or maybe postulate or ask questions and try to figure out well why are these things the way that they are and oftentimes we could ask the question say well it just is but you could ask a question why did he have to leave her why is it that god could not have just given him the promise in her and god just given him the possession of her and driven out all the inhabitants or made him a great ruler in er and toppled over polytheism and he became a great ruler and leader to bring everyone back to monotheism why did he have to leave er this is the city this a thriving city there in babylon why did he have to leave that and maybe we've answered that to some degree in terms of god was calling them out of babylon the seed of satan these evil powers but then you could say well then why did he have to say separate from his family why couldn't he take his father why couldn't he take his brothers why couldn't he take his nephew why did he have to separate from his father and then his brothers but then even his nephew why did it have to this division keep going down in this separation these are interesting questions to ponder because you find it that the bible even referring to when he separated from lot he says um then after he had separated from lot then god gives him maybe a more detailed and more profound promise so hey you're just going to father a lot of kids and your kids are going to have a lot of kids and their kids are going to have a lot of kids he gets more specific and more detailed once he's separated from lot and and the context is now that he's separated from lot i can tell him more and so there's it's an interesting question why god had to narrow it down why did he have to wander so much why didn't god just take them out of er and place them right smack dab in hebron and say you're going to live here you're going to die you're going to be buried here and why did he why did he take the path that he did why did god you think about it why did god allow him to have a son by hagar like this is the father of our faith all right why why did god preserve conversations where god says hey abraham you're going to have a son by sarah and his name's going to be isaac and he's like oh no no no god just let ishmael live before you that this is preserved in the testimony of abraham this one who came to this perfect faith and by faith you know staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief yet these things are perser preserved we think well why did god allow him to have a son by hagar are you expecting me to answer all these questions today because if you are i'm going to stop because man i've got like a list of ones i could come up with god i'm just scatter shooting here and so maybe i'll just leave it at those questions i'm sure you got some real doozies and we could talk about them later but there's a lot of questions we'd want to ask why this way why this way and i will say this i believe that as i preach today these questions can be answered not that i'm going to say this is the reason and this is that but i believe the answer's in the word so let's begin to think and and i realize that my thought today is very foundational very very very simple i hate to disappoint anybody but since i began pastor depreciation last sunday we're going to get more and more simple more and more simple and they but please focus because i think sometimes when it gets real simple sometimes we kind of check out right so please stay very very focused i don't want to lose any of you today and i i want to say this the story of abraham or let me phrase it this way the story of redemption in abraham is connected with the story of the fallen adam so the story of redemption that we see in abraham is connected with the story of the fall of adam and in genesis chapter one two three and four we could say that this not incomplete because then i know there's some narrative as to uh generations but there it tells adam's story and i want i'm not going to do it completely today at all i'm not going to do it on a surface level i'm just merely referencing it today that is the first four chapters of the bible tell a adam's story i want to compare it to abraham's story in genesis chapter 12 to 25 and just start looking at how the life of abraham compares but also contrasts to the life of adam and they're connected together and i want to start with genesis chapter 2 verses 8 to 15 and read this and i've been studying more on this particular aspect of it and i've taken some things and just moved them to the side to hopefully get to on wednesday night but it says in genesis chapter 2 verses 8 to 15 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed man what is adam it's not really a name as much as it's a word used for humanity or mankind so adam's name is really it's humankind during the man and that's where we get adam and it says and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil now it gets descriptive of this region this area and a river went out of eden to water the garden so there's a river that goes out of eden it's a river that would uh have its genesis or its origin out of eden and then it waters this garden that god had planted in in eden we realize those are two different as you have eden a garden in eden and so even after mankind is sent out of the garden they still dwelt in eden and there was this uh allure to the east gate to worship because there they had been driven out and so it says and from fence it was part of this river that went out of eden it was parted and became into four heads and so this is this region is not geographically identifiable today they're not able to find one river in this in a particular location that breaks out into these four heads uh that satisfied anybody there's a lot of speculation as to where it is and a lot of speculation as to uh exactly where it is located but it's not that we could find uh this exact these exact geographical descriptions today the name of the first is paisan that is it which compasseth the whole land of havala where there is gold so there's a lot of things that kind of give us this context to the resources and the topography and the layout of the land and the gold of that land is is good there is bedlam in the onyx stone and the name of the second river is gehon the same is it the same as it that can pass up the whole land of ethiopia and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is this is that this is it which goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates now even the the hittakel is also referred to as the tigris river and so this land that's being described as describing what's actually between the tigris river and the euphrates river which uh we could eat we could safely assume we're named after the flood right because these these rivers would have been underwater during a flood but after the flood waters receive noah and his sons would have had some knowledge of these geographical landmarks and these rivers and so post flood whether these are the actual rivers themselves in the exact same place you know i guess some could argue and speculate but it's between the tigris and the euphrates river ahead to kell that babylon arises and so i believe the bible is orienting us to a general location and that these rivers are given this placement of being the whole land of ethiopia and euphrates and the and the assyrian these different things it's kind of orienting us to a particular area and it says in the lord god took the man remember it says there he planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man now it says the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and keep it and so eden would be a larger region the garden a specific location within it and i want to mention this now that garden of eden a lot of different translations and even within the the uh the oral tradition of the jews the garden of eden would be called the paradise of god and that's what it would be referred to as as a paradise a paradise even the the persian word for paradise would be pleasant a pleasant ground a a pleasant place and it would speak of pleasantness and eden means delight so this is a paradise that's being described in in this eden this paradise there's this garden this planting of the lord and it's in this the garden that we're looking at the garden eastern end there he put the man and god took the man and put him in the garden of eden this is the setting for adam's existence then we begin to ponder his origin and his life and how his living this is where this is exactly where he was placed even his body originates from this land and this is adam's home this is where adam exists this is where he dwells and you are being well read in the scripture and i realized even this past week that there's a lot of things that connect into the things that we fellowshipped on and in the beginning god created a family and that focusing in on those first few chapters and how profound the bible lays out this creation and the family and the promises of god and the foreshadowing and the types and when god pla takes adam gives him a body plants him puts him right there within the garden of eden he gives them dominion over everything upon earth he gives them power over everything on earth and he's given a possession of the land of possession of eden possession of the earth you could say and he's given a responsibility over eden he's to dress in and he's to keep it and there's these things that he must do upon the face of the earth and in genesis chapter 1 verse 28 it says god bless them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth this is a commandment notice he says god really in your mind i want you to just grasp or not grasp i know you understand this but kind of put this image in your mind that god creates a man spirit being then takes a body puts that spirit in the body and basically takes him and plants him right in the middle of this garden and then he tells him to be right be fruitful multiply replenish he's telling him what these things that he must do this is your to-do list subdue the earth have demeanor with the fish and over the foul there everything that lives and moves upon the face of the earth you you you take it you control it and there is this commandment and be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth that there was they were to spread out over the earth they were to possess every inch of it and starting with the man and the woman how that they would possess the garden and they would have seed that the seed after them would then likewise go forth and mo be fruitful multiply and possess and they were to spread out replenish the earth fill it up and then the the first figure in the first representation of this would have been in the man and the woman so this is a commandment to spread out to possess every inch of the earth and it's against this commandment that they rebel in genesis 11 to spread out over the earth they said let's build us a city in a tower so that we don't spread out over the earth so it is called in some this covenant that god gave adam the adamic covenant or even the edenic covenant maybe refer to two different ways and we know there's another covenant given to adam in the fall but this eden covenant contained blessings and also warnings there was blessings in it or commandments do this do this but there's also a warning and the image that i'm wanting just to very narrowly focus on right now is you have one man and a woman the woman you could say his wife under a commandment with in a conditional covenant this is the image of genesis chapter two in genesis chapter three one man and his wife under commandment with the conditional covenant and adam has just placed in this beautiful garden he is he's in a perfect land and adam himself and the woman are fully equipped with the promise and the ability to fulfill that promise and adam does not need to journey to find the land wherein he's going to fulfill the he can fulfill the promise he does not have to seek after the resources to achieve the fulfilling of the promise he's just placed there everything's perfect everything is exactly in order god gives them a promise he gives them the ability to fulfill the promise and so we can say that abra adam's life begins in perfection it's life it's power it's dominion it's abundance and it's fertile with possibility adam is fertile the woman is fertile they're ripe with all this possibility and everything when you say the world is your oyster that's where it begins right right there the word this was this is the first oyster and adam and the woman can have whatever they want live in abundance and and they could speak and bring forth and they could control and might talk about just an extraordinary condition the eden condition perfection sublime you couldn't even you can't even describe it just talking about it right now you know adam's thinking man you're really painting a bleak picture because it was so great it was so powerful and beautiful that's the story of adam that's how the story of adam begins listen to the beginning of the story of abraham remember i didn't talk about comparing and comparing there's a lot of similarities but there's some contrast too genesis chapter 11 verse 27 to 31 now these are the generations of terror terror begat abraham nehor and haran and haran begat lot and haran died before his father death right at the beginning of the story of abraham his brother dies before his father taran the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees and abraha abram and nahor took them wives the name of abram's wife was sarah and the name of nehor's wife milka the daughter of ron the father of milka and the father of iska but sarah was barren she had no child this is this is we're we're being introduced to abram and you can say well uh here's nehor here's his wife milka and she's the daughter of haran who's the father of milk and the father iska and they say oh and this is sarah abram's wife and she can't have kids well who's her dad you know you know tell me more about her but it's oh sarah she can't have kids she's barren it says that tara took abram his son and lot the son of haran his son's son and sarah his daughter-in-law his son abram's wife and they went forth with them from ur the chaldees to go into the land of canaan to go into they leave to go into the land of canaan so there's a journey and they came under haran and dwelt there i think of how differently the story of abraham begins than the story of adam i know it's really really obvious very very elementary but just let me get started you got to you know walk before you can run and i still have training wheels on my ministerial bicycle i understand but just be patient with me that here adam's story begins in perfection and it's sublime and it's wonderful commandment covenant and here's everything you need you're where you need to be you have everything you need and be fruitful multiply replenish yours subdue have power have dominion i've given it all to you but abraham's story starts with the barren wife and then it's kind of like a never-ending road trip and it begins this meandering journey and abram is called to go to a land he's called to a destiny that even in the beginning he doesn't know adam is just created and planted in the garden of eden is like this is where you're going to live possess this subdue it it's all yours bbb and adam has every ability and uh to do it and bring it to pass and then with abram it's like hey i want you to leave your family come with me but like adam he was given a covenant like adam he's given a commandment it says in genesis chapter 12 verses 6 to 7 i know that we're skipping in this story of abram but we've been covering it through many services and it says abram passed through the land under the place of shechem under the plain amore and the canaanite was then in the land he's now in the land of canaan that he had started off to go to when he left ur and the lord appeared unto abram and said this is where this promise begins to take on more detail because he tells him at the beginning when he says the lord when he called him out of er he had said i'll make you a great nation and i will bless thee make thy name great you're going to be a blessing and his promise begins with blessing and there's cursing but who's the curse to and who's the warning to there's no warning to abraham it's i'm going to curse whoever curses you so it's all blessing to abram but now god is going to be very particular and specific because now he's calling them out into a land that i'm going to show you here after so this is where i think these two jumping into this part because these two parts now come together because he said i'm going to make you a father of many nations though his wife had no children but now he says unto thy seed i have no children as of yet but you're going to have a seed unto thy seed i will give this land this is the promise to your to thy seed i will give this then thy seed this land and then abraham's response there he builded an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him this is where i want to make the connection adam and abraham are connected by the promise of land and the seed this is where we begin to see this connection between adam and abraham adam is given a covenant conditional covenant he's given a promise he's given a commandment with blessings and warning abraham's given a covenant he's given a promise and he's given a promise with blessings and then a warning to his enemies but this promise is to thy seed so there's seed i'm going to give this land and adam was given a land to possess presently when he was planted in the garden of eden god said this is it and he has this this physical consciousness in this garden everything you look everything you see is yours the earth is yours this garden is yours have dominion possess it anything that moves flies the herbs the tree the fruit of the trees it's all yours take it possess it adam had this present possession and the present commandment to be fruitful with every ability to carry it out but abraham has no possession in the land he has no possession of land and he has no seed but yet god promises both adam had the land and he had the virility he had the he had the ability to give life he he had a wife whose womb could bring forth uh children and so here uh the image of adam is be fruitful this commandment i just summarized it as a commandment and the possibility and the promise and then abraham he's got his land he's got his garden abraham has no land and he has no seed but god promises both unto thy seed will i give this land this i this is a part to me that um is i know i'm i'm not rehearsing a great mystery to you but i'm wanting you to ponder this connect it uh let it be settled in your heart this promise that god makes to abraham is the promise of the redemption of what adam lost through the fall when he begins to speak to him and he says unto thy seed will i give this land this promise to abraham is the promise to is connected with the promise to redeem what adam lost and to fulfill what adam failed to fulfill adam was under a commandment adam had a job to do but adam failed to do his job and he lost possession and he lost power and he and he never fulfilled the commandment of god and so now when god begins to speak to abram even though he has no present possession though he has no seed and he does not even have the ability to bring it forth to his wife god promises both and he says unto thy seed will i give this land and that is god promising to fulfill through abraham what adam failed to fulfill and redeeming speaking of redeeming what adam had lost now ponder this aspect of how adam lost it because adam's covenant was broken when the woman pro proposed the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil right it was her suggestion genesis chapter 3 verse 12 after the mistake takes place and what a a innocent way to describe what took place but after the sin and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat does the bible not tell us that she took the fruit she offers it to adam and he's saying my wife suggested it it was her idea uh this is what she told me to do so adam has got a job to do he's got a promise he's got a possession everything's right there before him all you got to do is wait for god's time and do it according to the will of god and then all of a sudden his wife comes says you know what why don't we do it this way and god even speaks to it in verse 17 of chapter three and unto adam he said because thou hast hearken unto the voice of thy wife so god even is identifying that adam's deviation the bible teaches us that adam is not in the transgression or he's not deceived but the woman being deceived was in transgression so it's through her her deceit and then her suggestion her offering this other way that adam falls and god himself says you've hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and in listening to the voice of his wife he bypasses the promise of god and and and humanity falls and it's the woman it's through it's through eve she's later called eve it's through the woman that sin is brought into the world and the woman gave birth to cain who was wicked the bible even says in first john 3 12 not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother he's the murderer from the beginning so this child that is born of the woman through her her deception it produces this wicked cane very murderous and combative and unwilling to humble himself unwilling to listen very difficult to get along with this is this is the cane that is born of the woman at the time of this fall and this deception and the woman brings adam into to participate into the sin through her suggestion you've hearkened unto the voice of thy wife now i'm not expanding beyond just those details we understand that there's something being portrayed in adam's willingness to step out for his wife but notice that in the beginning is the woman that suggests to adam another way and it bypasses the promise of god and it voids the covenant and they never fulfill genesis 1 28 then notice what happens in genesis chapter 16. because i mentioned there was some similarities in genesis chapter 16 verses one and two now sarah abram's wife bear him no children we keep getting reminded of this and i'm sure sarah appreciated it and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar and sarah said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarah just as adam had hearkened to the voice of his wife and voided the covenant now abram listens to the voice of his wife and has a child of his wife's servant her handmaid hagar and notice what it produces in verse 12 and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brother he's going to be right there in the middle of all his brains he's going to dwell right in the thick of it right in the middle east right there around everyone it's going to be difficult to get along with he's going to be cantankerous his hand is going to be against every thing every man and every man's hand against him and so when abraham listened to his wife it brought forth a wild man against everything against every man just like when eve was deceived and it brought forth cain this wild child adam hearkening to the voice of his wife nullified the covenant and brother bannon says this and the seed does not air with the shock he said god promised abraham through sarah to have this child but now watch the first seat of abraham by the bondswoman come by sarah doubting that this could happen because she was old and past the age of bearing now that's how the church starts that's how it always starts interesting isn't it you start from the bottom you don't start from the top i appreciate humble beginnings he says a man trying to come climb a ladder he tries to get on top first he'll break his neck you ever heard the saying easy tiger slow down a little bit stay humble stay low you know take it easy he says you've got to start and build up to that what beautiful principles are being expressed if something begins watch the start of it how strong does it come on how uh uh brash or flamboyant and how how great are you trying to be you got to start and build up to that and then he says and here we find the beginning of the promise of god being made manifest through a slightly doubted interrupted program of god so notice the beginning of the promise of god being made manifest he's talking about abraham abraham is the beginning of the promise of god being made manifest not adam anymore not noah but adam abraham is the beginning of the promise of god being made manifest and how does it begin where does it start saying through a slightly doubted interrupted program of god this is in the beginning he says that's the same way sin began in the garden of eden so he's making this connection of sarah slightly doubting the promise and through her slight doubting makes the suggestion to uh to abraham and it's through her suggestion maybe we should just do this that causes abraham to deviate from what the promise of god was what the protection would be what the provision be would be what the course was you know i said this is what god wants me to do this is thus saith the lord this is what this is where i'm placed and this is what god wants to do through me he's going to do it but all it took was for his wife said well maybe it could be through hagar and he deviates slightly doubting the promise and the parallel to adam is so remarkable but it's not the parallel that's so remarkable it's the contrast that's even more remarkable when adam doubted when adam sinned the whole thing was voided but the mystery of abraham's faith is that the promise slightly doubted can't stop the promise the promise lightly doubted does not nullify the covenant abrahams could not abraham's covenant could not be broken when his wife proposed the wrong womb and he made the mistake and produced a wild child god doesn't say that's it i'm starting over is there another name that starts with a he doesn't stop he doesn't start over but abraham's covenant could not be voided even though he slightly doubted the promise even though it was interrupted the program of god the same way that sin entered the garden of eden here now god is saying even though the same sin manifests in abram's story it does not void the covenant adam is never given an opportunity to fulfill his commandment here's the commandment be fruitful multiply replenish the earth just doubt the promise god says never mind it's not yours can't have it he doesn't even give him a chance to restore the covenant sorry adam but if you'll go sacrifice this and do that he doesn't say you know what because you've sinned the judgment's going to pass upon your son and he's going to die and then that's going to get you back into eden no even though that son did die and was murdered is it foreshadowing a pre-figure of christ and you see these things just begin to accumulate type after type after type but that didn't open it back up to him it's like one mistake and it's all over yep that's exactly what god said blessing blessing blessing with the warning this is a conditional covenant but though abram sinned in a similar manner at the time of the fall just think about what the recourse was to adam as soon as adam makes his mistake and i say as soon as the warning was the day you eat that day you die so there's consequence that immediately begins to set in and everything gets revised um i think we could speculate as to what their understanding was of that i don't know if it was like hey if i'm gonna die at least i'm gonna die in eden or in the garden of eden and then all of a sudden it's like no i'm taking that away too he's like what you know i can't live in this beautiful hospice no i mean it was like everything was gone and so the time of the fall because this promise slightly doubted and adam transgressing with his wife adam is driven out of the garden of eden he loses his possession he loses the promises he loses his fellowship with god he loses everything that was his it's like just like that almost it's like i placed you per in a perfect eden now i'm taking you out of perfection death sorrow labor conflict everything changes that that lion that you used to get along with now he could be you could be prayed to him uh the ground that used to cooperate with you now you're gonna fight with it all these things everything changes and what it says and notice how it says in genesis chapter 3 verses 22 to 24 and this is this judgment this final uh slamming the door on adam as he loses this land and the lord god said behold the man has become as one of us it reminded me of what god says in genesis 11 behold man is one and nothing is restrained the the the they is one this is the people is one in genesis 11 it says now man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken he's driven out of the garden of eden and he's now going to till the ground that he was taken out of so he drove out the man with him the woman and placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and the flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life this is this is the judgment the final climactic judgment on adam he's he's living in paradise in communion with god the place of god's presence and here and his comes down and he walks with adam and there's this communion and fellowship and there's this harmony and everything is perfect but now with sin he says he's sent out of the garden of eden and then god places once his journal he's placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubim and these place terms they're guardians of god's dwelling place what does god say in exodus that out that's where i'll meet you between the cherubim and so there's this image that the cherubim they're the ones that guard the dwelling place of god adam is being kicked out of the paradise of god he's being ushered out of this it would be even described maybe as a city not in a civilization like cain would build but it was this inhabitation this dwelling place even the language that i find myself kind of venturing into where i want to be wednesday night but even the language that's used as god gives warning is that it had the same image of a city that's wakeful and watchful to protect and to keep and to guard and subdue and have dominion he was in a city of god he was lit dwelling in a dwelling place with god inhabiting a paradise and when god drives them out and places these cherubs it's denoting that what abraham has been driven away from is this dwelling place of god's presence even such to when cain goes away he goes away from the presence of the lord he's running further away from that place that represented the garden where god dwelt with adam and the woman and it's therein that paradise is lost but even though let me say this i want to read it in a moment but even though adam is pushed out of the garden of eden before the door is shut he prophesies so there's another promise that is given at the time that this judgment is being struck now when god calls and so maybe i'll just repeat it here before i read the scripture when god calls abraham in genesis chapter 12 it's connected with the promise and it's connected with the seed because even though adam is the door is being shut on adam and his covenant is gone his power is gone the promise has gone his communion is gone the fellowship is gone and there's no you know key code that he can use to get back in there's only one way back in and it's through genesis 3 15. and when i say back in it's not so much a way back into that eden a way to fulfill what god desired to have what god envisioned and foreshadowed in the garden of eden is genesis 3 15. and in genesis 3 15 he says and i will put now is he so beautiful that as he curses the serpent he's giving blessing to the seed his seed and i'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel this is then we gather from this the seed of the woman we understand this to be the first gospel the first sermon this is the the first announcement and proclamation of jesus christ it says i will put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman and christ is the seed of the woman so as the adam covenant is being closed and that adam covenant is gone and that eden is gone he prophesies the second adam and he's sowing the seeds of another endemic covenant or eden covenant but not necessarily that one that adam had but another one brother branham says this i don't believe i provided the statement uh in in the church age but because it's just a principle i wanted to read but the man says in the garden of eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that seed had to come through abraham so notice how brother branham is connecting this there's the seed of the woman and then he designates that seed to come through abraham so he gave the prophecy that prophecy doesn't move until god calls abraham and that prophecy is now attached to abram and this prophecy is now upon him influencing him and if i could say it this way he is under the protection and the provision of that promise god has now designated genesis 3 15 to abraham oh if there was any way that he could get that revelation that i am the carrier i am the conduit and i am the embodiment of genesis 3 15 he would have known that no devil out of hell could have ever stopped him in genesis chapter 3 the promise is given and then adam is driven out of the garden of eden think about that adam who's full of promise full of potential full of possibility all that is stripped away from him and then god speaks of promise as adam is walking out of the garden and driven by these flaming swords out of the garden but then in genesis chapter 12 abraham who had nothing is given a promise and now just as adam was driven out he's driven out this promise has given and he's driven out of eden and he's driven away from the promise he's driven away from the possibility he's driven away from the potential when you begin to look at abram's beginning in ur from that moment you look at it the opposite just as adam is driven out and away adam is being driven to abraham is being driven too adam was kicked out of the land he was driven away from that land but with abraham he is he is under its influence adam was driven away from the garden he was kicked out of the paradise of god abraham comes under a burden and he's seeking it having never seen it he's under its influence the hit the city that abraham sought was the hidden place that adam was driven away from and he's under its influence he has nothing he has no power he has no potential but he has a promise and that drives him but here's adam who loses everything and he's driven away from it now abraham's going back well let me say this way not back forward it's it's it's back in type it's back in analogy it's back in image but now the city that abraham is seeking is this hidden place that adam has driven away from he goes forward not backwards and this is a thought that is interesting to ponder on a number of levels but abraham is between two edens he's between the garden of eden in satan's eden before another eden because you know there's an eden restore there's a new there's a new eden the garden of god paradise lost now he's in satan's eden but he's between these two edens of god and he's seeking a paradise restored and that one's greater than the one that was lost right would you agree the one that could can't end would be greater than the one that did end it's a greater glory and then notice what it says in revelations 21 2 and 3. we read to verse 2 verses 1 and 2 last sunday and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven remember this is the city that abraham sought when he when he this genesis 3 15 is designated to him this is the city he begins to seek prepared as a bride adorned for a husband and heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold notice his part behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them this is what those cherubims represented that they were guarding the way to the tree of life guarding the way to christ guarding the way to the presence of god the place where god dwelt and he will dwell with him and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with him and be their god notice the language that's spoken in the end revelation 21 this great city that follows the image of the mystery babylon that john was just in awe of the mystery babylon the great harlot this that city and all of its amenities but then its filth and its destruction its disease now the contrast now is the glory now that's the beauty the new jerusalem that's the city that abraham sought and the language is that god will be with them and he will be their god what is this is the this is the garden of god this is the new jerusalem it says in revelations 2 7 the tree of life is in the midst of the paradise of god what were those cherubims doing in in genesis chapter 3 guarding the way of the tree of life but then it's given this promise is given a revelation the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god this is a new paradise this is the paradise restored this is the paradise that abraham was seeking so now if we could take a step back just for a moment i'm literally taking a step back for a moment and uh it kind of helps me to figuratively take a step back and the atom at the suggestion of his wife sins and through her sin and his following her the covenant is void nullified possession promised gone kicked out of the garden of eden now abraham is called with no possession no and no power but is given a promise unto thy seed will i give this land but then abraham through the slightly doubting of his wife and through her suggestion acts in genesis chapter 16 and brings forth a wild child brings forth a child that is not the heir and god says hey this guy is going to be this nation is going to be crazy and you have to deal with them all the days of your life the next chapter genesis chapter 17. notice what god says this is immediately after the promise slightly doubted immediately after the image of sin in the garden is resurrected in god's own language as adam you hearken to the voice of your wife and now in the story of written of abraham abraham hearken to the voice of his wife the the the uh the image of the sin is so similar that with this is reverberating oh no here's another promise given and another man has made a mistake in the promise in the very same area related to a seed and this is god's response in genesis chapter 17 verse 1 to verse 8 and we read this as a text and when abram was 90 years old years old and 9 the lord appeared to abraham and said you should have never done that with hagar because you did i got to go find somebody else thanks a lot you've ruined my program again what's with you humans i pick at him i give him a promise he breaks and i pick no i give him a promise he breaks it now you you abraham of all people i thought you're going to be the one now you stab me in the back which one of you is next he says i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect i know you made a mistake i know i've told you there's consequences for your actions but i don't want you to doubt for a minute abraham about whether or not my promise still stands if i've led you somewhere i've given you a promise i've shown you my way if i've made a promise i'm not going to take it back it's yours and i'm going to appear to you now because i want to show a pattern to my your seat after you i want to show a pattern to the bride i want to show a pattern to the royal seat of abraham that your mistakes and your slightly doubted cannot void my covenant with you and he's quick to appear again to abram and say walk before me and be thou perfect the takeaway for abram would have been even though i made a mistake i can still be perfect yes you can still be perfect because i am the almighty god and so to remove any doubt whatsoever he says i will make my covenant between me and thee and i i'm saying i because it just follows and i will multiply the exceedingly he's he's taking it out of the realm of abraham abraham i know you just recently listened to your wife and you and by listening to her you slightly down to the promise and you brought forth ishmael and that's going to cause you a lot of problems but i want to remind you i will do it it's not your wife's suggestion that's going to do it it's not you trying to cherry pick or find a needle in the haystack he said i will do it i will make my covenant between me and me i will multiply the exceedingly and abraham fell on his face abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying he's not going to stop he keeps talking to him as for me behold my covenant is with thee just hear from me and thou shalt be a father of many nations no to the length notice the language now neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made this connects to genesis 12 when he told him this is what i would do but now he's going to change the name there's got to be consequence and i will make the exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of the notice i will i will i will i will i will i will as for me this is my promise abraham you didn't shake hands with me we didn't make a deal you don't have some kind of contract with me where there's a termination clause this clause has no termination this contract has no termination clause there's no 45 days with written notice with cause without cause it cannot be voted you know what abraham was stuck hallelujah you've been trapped into this you're stuck with it my goodness i think some of us have probably tried to figure a way out of it you realize i can't this hits me i will make the exceeding fruitful i will make nations i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant in other words it's a covenant can't be avoided can't be broken it's unconditional then he says to be a god unto thee and that i see after thee notice the language he's using now and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger this land you know not of this land that was not yours this land that you don't aren't familiar with all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession eternal possession this is where he realized that the promise given to abraham was eternal so what he began to seek is something that would never end that abraham fully caught the revelation of an everlasting covenant and an everlasting god it meant a permanence that would never end and i will be their god what is the proclamation when the new jerusalem comes down out of god from heaven the tabernacle of god is with men and he will be with him and be their god it's it's repeated because it's there that the seeds of the new jerusalem begin to take hold in the life of abraham just in this passage here these eight verses i want to look back over him here for a moment and pull some things out i was going to do it as we went through it but let me just look back over and pull some of these things out he in this in this passage he says neither shall thy name anymore be called abram but thy name shall be abraham in genesis chapter one to four adam it means man or mankind in some ways adam's not even given a name he's just man humankind it comes from a root of ruddy and kind of red and we kind of maybe more speak to just something descriptive but we know he is the first man he's man mankind and then the woman which came out of man she's the only one that gets named but not by adam after the fall and she is given the name of eve and what does that mean mother of all living but adam never has another name even not after the fall he's not given another name he's never called the father of all he's not given another appellation another designation he is just merely described but what he represent in the beginning this is humanity this is humankind this is where god is starting but after the fall the woman she becomes the mother of all living we understand that because we realize that the children she brings forth are not all entirely atoms but now in the story of abram we were introduced to him in genesis chapter 11 as it's more pronounced and we realize what's happening when he leaves er the chaldees that abram means exalted father comes from ab which is head founder or father and room which means to rise up or exalted abram it would be the head father a right to rise up be an exalted father but now when god is going to catch abram after the promise is slightly doubted in genesis 17 wants to appear again to confirm his presence with him and unfold the promise even in a greater way and just reaffirm this is my covenant my covenant might come everlasting everlasting never going to end never going to end i will do this i will do this i will do this i will do this in great contrast to what he did in the first covenant he changes his name he changed his name from abram to abraham which is father of a great or numerous multitude and there's a lot of a lot of ways that we look at this how that god takes abram and he kind of divides it and he puts this h in there and we could say that this represents god and to the jews he took h which is a part of his name it's yahweh he's put it in there and it's inserted so it's god dividing abraham and putting himself in there beautiful image beautiful type that's been expressed there and there's other ways that people look at the root of raheem and different ways they try to see how that this was an actual name change and it is it's from exalted father but now it would be exalted father of many or numerous the father of many nations as god gives it the meaning because he says i will multiply thy thee exceedingly thou shalt be a father of many nations and as such i will name thee abraham because you're going to be a father of many nations i've made the father many nations so god is attaching the name change to how numerous his seed is going to be and when god does that he attaches abraham to the first covenant of genesis 1 28. when he says this and you and i think i said you you've got to catch this or you're lost that's not what i mean but just just i'd recognize what he's done here he says i'm going to multiply the excellent he's using a very specific language and you're going to be a father of numerous people and so i'm going to change your name and he gives them the name abraham the father of numerous multitudes in genesis 1 28 he told adam to be fruitful right any time he said adam be fruitful be a multiplier replenish the earth he's told to be these things but in genesis 17 6 i will make thee exceeding fruitful it's the same word the para it's the same word be fruitful but adam was responsible for being fruitful and as soon as he voided the covenant he couldn't be fruitful but now god is using the same commandment and instead of telling abram to be fruitful he says i will make the exceeding fruitful really in reality adam wasn't fruitful at all in light of the promise because god we are taught that that genesis 128 was never fulfilled by adam and the woman but now he says i will make the exceeding fruitful and in genesis 17 2 and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly adam under genesis 1 28 was to be fruitful para which abraham is going to be exceeding fruitful but also he was to multiply which is he was to multiply which is to become numerous adam be fruitful adam multiplier become great become numerous so when god changes abraham's name from abram to abraham because he was going to become the father of multiple or numerous generations he joins him to genesis 1. abraham it takes the ba in there and it makes it part of his name why adam never was the father of that multiplication but abraham you will be and the name change why the genesis 3 15 is designated to abram and so that picks up and carries with it genesis 1 28 so it wasn't right that he be named abram anymore he had to become abraham to signify the seed is now attached to abram and therefore he must be called already change his name before the sun even comes forth why because i have made thee already with an everlasting covenant it is not presumptuous to change your name from an exalted father to the father of numerous to multiply it's remarkable what god is doing and connecting that abraham is now connected with genesis 3 15 he's connected to genesis 1 28 these very profound substantial scriptures in genesis 1 to 4 that sow the seeds of god's program in his plan now we know that worked out what worked out in the garden of eden was exactly according to god's plan right and we know that the man and the woman could have brought forth the seed they had the promise they had the potential everything was there yet they fell working out god's plan so in genesis 3 genesis 4 the program of god gets lost and everything god spoke the genesis 128 man doesn't have access to that anymore the only thing that you have is i will bring a seat of a woman and that's going to be your promise this is going to crush the serpent's work it's gonna it's gonna do away with this curse and this would have been part of the consciousness of man as he begins to leave the garden and this is why you this is why you find satan standing ready to do what kill the first child of the woman that's connected with adam and cain kills abel because this is something that who's it going to be right who's it going to be who's this man from satan's agenda and satan's perspective who's the one that's going to try to crush what i'm trying to do here and so when the man and the woman fail to fulfill that promise it's like that that seemingly lost to mankind especially through the passage of time the judgment of noah's generation but now i'm closing with this i know that's misleading i'm closing generally are we not in the closing time of the rapture i mean do we expect god to end in 30 minutes the rapture neither should you expect a preacher to do it in 30 minutes when he says we're closing i was referring to the age right but now think of it in light of that now abraham and sarah because in genesis 17 changes her name too think of how the designation eve with the eve eve the mother of all living but really we realize how horrible of the designation that became because then it's through her that murder came but then god takes the name sarah sarah i weeks with i and then changes it to sarah with an h again taking the same part that he gave in abraham he gives to sarah so now they're connected in the name they're joined together this is where sarah becomes a part of abraham and she can't be judged in genesis 18. when she laughs again and slightly here goes again what did you do in genesis 16 a couple chapters later it's a it's an even chapter time for sarah to do something crazy and starts laughing about elohim's promise and god can't judge her why he did it in 17 he made sarah part of abraham in the name change and sarah means noble woman princess from prison this is noble woman and so she has this royalty that's attached to her but now it's abraham and sarah they are the beginning of the new generation to come they are the beginning of the new race the super race say were they that no but god had to start somewhere and so genesis 3 my whole buildup has been this because this is how god it struck me a couple weeks ago this was the image that god gave me when i began to look at why did now i'm not trying to answer the question but this is how i looked at it why did god start with abram and his wife with a bunch of family and then finally narrow it down to it was just one man and a wife because in genesis chapter three have one man and one woman driven from eden with no children and no promise but genesis chapter 12 the story of abraham begins with one man a husband one man a wife with the promise of the seed foreshadowing what in the end it will be the husband the seed and his bride the bride so what is it that god is portraying when he wants to get abram alone with sarah he wants to begin to do in them what adam and the woman never did do eve's name was changed but not adams but now in abram and sarai the story of abraham starts with abram and his wife but there's all these other things in the picture so god has to give him a promise and the promise is a seed and a land and he says i'm going to give you both now to leave you with uh to give you something to ponder for wednesday lord we'll get there get to this on wednesday in genesis chapter 15 verse 18 it says in the same day the lord god made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt under the great river the river euphrates ponder this description and the description that moses gave when he wrote the book of genesis of the land of eden and the garden of eden when god tells abram i'm going to give you this land and says from the great river of egypt into the uh uh to the river of the euphrates he describes a land that's entirely encompassed by eden in genesis chapter 2. and when you see where god called abram out of because he said i'm going to give you this land all the way up to the euphrates river has anybody in the last 10 services looked at a map and tried to figure out where er was anybody here i feel like a failure my single desire ministry is to create a hunger in you for the word of god so hopefully you've been listening to more tapes about what brother man preached about abraham at the very least who cares about the maps right hey siri show me a map of abraham's journey and what will it show you show you the river euphrates and just to the east of the reeve euphrates on the other side of the border is a city called ur just east on the other side of the river on the border of that land and so when god calls abram out of er he then follows euphrates but he stays on the wrong side until he starts journeying into canaan and then he crosses that boundary and then god tells him in genesis 15 i'm going to give you this land from the river of egypt all the way to the river euphrates and god is revealing to abraham that he's granting him this portion that would have been in eden he showed them to abraham what i'm giving to you what is your possession is something that adam lost and was driven away from oh this is a beautiful story of redemption that's connected with the fall and this is how we can have confidence that me and the figure of abraham despite my doubtings despite my weaknesses despite how long it may take one day i'll be on top of mount zion but the mike if you'd come i want to end with this statement from identified masterpiece of god says after a man had fallen and deliberately opened the door to the enemy and come in and marred him and set death in him still god was not willing this be defeated his purpose his plan his program he came down and started all over again he was going to make that man again that's powerful that man had fallen and he wasn't just gonna take adam and patch him back up again and just say adam i want you to look into my eyes follow my finger you're getting sleepy i'm gonna put you to sleep and take away your memories and start all over could have done that right can he just erase his memory i mean he's god couldn't have he flown around the world really really fast and just reverse time i mean superman can do it i mean couldn't god just rewound the earth and everything just kind of back up and boom right here and adam's like hey whatever you do there's gonna be a snake talk to you today don't buy his apples [Music] and everything be kosher right [Music] that's not what god does he's gonna make that man again [Music] it's gonna be greater too [Music] notice what he says continuing he's going to make that man again the very next statement he put adam on a covenant do this not this this and not that touch not handle not taste not you may feel like you're under that covenant but you're not he says but we find out when he started again he started with abraham amen this is where it starts this is where it begins when he started again he started with abraham that's when he started to make that man again who's that man it's your savior who's that man it's christ who's that man it's what you're a part of who's that man it's the one you came from [Music] we find out when he started again he started with abraham i'm so glad he didn't take me from adam to still be undercover do this do that do this do that but we find out when he started again he started with abraham and in abraham he started him on an unconditional covenant a covenant without condition a covenant without a termination clause a covenant that was everlasting and perpetual a covenant which i am a part of as the seed of abraham oh hallelujah this was the beginning of the mystery of god that was hidden by the devil's mystery this was the beginning of making that man this image this idea this thought this will this predestination that had been lost in the garden this is why the devil was so busy with civilization in commanding and killing and conquering and erecting a tower he wanted man to forget the promise but in the middle of nations with mankind swallowed up by monotheism god undercover slips down into earth on just the other side of the euphrates and says abram follow me because right at the beginning of babylon at the beginning of babylon when he's satan's finding now after the foot now i've got my i got my race hybrid [Music] there's there's no pure line from hey adam here it is it's on earth now my kingdom begins in earnest and it begins to build it and right at the beginning right at the end genesis 11 is really what genesis 10 11 but then god says abram even while i think seth is still uh or uh sham is still like abram come on let's go it was the beginning of the kingdom that's gonna topple babylon so in his beginning god began his ending right in the beginning right is this starting i'm going to start your ending abram come on let's go you're ticking time bomb and i'm going to begin to i'm going to lay charges through thousands of years because he begin with abraham with an unconditional covenant and right under the cover of darkness when the mystery of god had been lost it begins again in abraham you're the finishing of that mystery can we stand together today [Music] brother michael could you maybe prepare in just a moment maybe to come and sing and lead some worship part of my depreciation today is i don't know if i'm going to be able to sing a little bit bower heads in a word of prayer [Music] i encourage you that if your faith [Music] if your faith has risen at all reach reach reach for the promise believe that it's to you and to your children wednesday night we were focusing on i just i remember wednesday night there was different situations on my heart and in particular just one that was really on my heart and it kept coming back to me over and over again [Music] and how god calls abram and his wife out of babylon and then he has a son and when he's time for him to have a marriage and get married god doesn't send him back into babylon to get married but he calls his wife out of babylon and then when isaac has a son and the promise is attached to jacob and it's time for jacob to get married he says go get another wife out of babylon bring her out don't go to babylon but get her out of babylon bring her back to this land wherein we're to dwell in this promise and it struck me god's going to keep on sending messengers into babylon until the last one is married to christ and abraham's seed don't worry he's gonna go get him why don't we just send a messenger right now to wherever they are lord i've got children in babylon lord i've got children under the darkness of laodicea lord there's family members and loved ones who are out there wondering in babylon the lord send a voice all but they heard it before they heard it before all right well you know what laban laban saw what god did to his sister rebecca it was in the family they talked about the message they had the gifts presented before him god didn't write the family off many years later he goes right back again says there's more seed from this family they got to come home let's believe all things are possible let's keep on believing there's still more chairs to put out here a few more that could have been filled this morning let's not stop believing claim your promise right now seat of abraham it's an everlasting covenant it's an everlasting possession this one isn't going to end in 2021 what you think he called you years ago to stop now he's a god that doesn't quit this is what he declared to abraham when just the chapter before he made a foolish decision it would seem and everything's upended and now what have i done i proposed my servant son before and god corrected me on that now seemingly went ahead again and did something and i lied in egypt now i'm doing this and like surely three strikes you're out right three strikes are out and then god comes with his most forceful reassurance yet and he never tells abraham for him to do anything he didn't say hey abraham pick a name any name he changed it for him he didn't tell him hey what did i promise you to do if you did this and days he just said look as for me i want you to know abraham as far as for me i know you might be struggling i know you might be fearful i know you might be wondering how it's going to happen but i want you to be assured as for me i meant it when i said it as for me my heart hasn't changed as for me what i said i will do and if you believed it for years don't stop believing now the promise is lie it will happen the word is thus saith the lord healing deliverance restoration whatever it might be the breaking of pride it's remarkable how that some people can be have such a rough exterior and so much pride and try to have everything put together and make themselves seem to be uh seemingly spiritual in some ways and and want everyone to look to them that they got everything put together and it's all a friend it's all a facade it's all pride but what lurks behind the pride is a tremendous shame and reproach that they bear in their hearts because maybe something they've done that others don't know and they're afraid just to accept what god has done in their lives let it go real and be free of that and move forward and allow a meekness and humility to break them down and really to be able to be of service we try to cover too many of our complexes with this facade of well i'm well maintained and put together and i got everything figured out and what can i do to help you when really what we need is help with our complex and the hurt and the transgression that lurks inside [Music] and there's still help our gracious heavenly father today as we stand in your presence there is a hunger in the hearts of the people today for redemption there's a hunger in their hearts for righteousness lord i believe that there is a bride in the land today that is being driven by a promise that though it may seem to the natural eye that here we are without power without promise without potential of any of the things that we look to and believe in as far as a body change and a new heavens and a new earth but yet lord we're pregnant with it we have received it and lord just as the woman went out of the garden pregnant [Music] with evil into babylon lord we are a bride that's pregnant with righteousness leaving babylon into eden even understand that the millennium will be the garden of god restored the paradise of god on earth restored just for a time before we go to the new one lord what beautiful imagery we have in our minds today [Music] and though we may feel weak and we may feel down we may feel and we keep making mistakes lord as for you your covenant is sure [Music] and i believe that it would be appropriate today lord if what we did is just fell on our face before you [Music] abraham did that being willing to accept whatever you would say next be willing to accept whatever pronouncement that you would make upon him may we likewise lord just bow our face to the earth and humility to you be willing to right now examine ourselves by the sunlight examine ourselves by the word of god to see if there be any [Music] any influence or way that we are taking that deviates from the course and plan that you have for our lives bless us father i pray may you be mindful of our needs the needs that represented behind hands and lifted hearts lord [Music] restore lord restore i ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
