[0:00] now we're going to continue on the
[0:01] subject of Heaven's mystery Earth's
[0:04] glory and uh the kingdom and we're going
[0:08] to look at the subject of no more
[0:10] Shadows or that' be my title today is no
[0:12] more
[0:13] shadows and I think it'll um there's
[0:16] different ways you can go with that
[0:18] phrasing no more Shadows I hope that it
[0:20] impacts you in the way that God would
[0:21] desire it to let's just look back at our
[0:24] text and we'll start here as we get into
[0:26] this I um just even the way that
[0:30] prepared for this it's just maybe a
[0:31] little bit different for me and just
[0:32] trus in the Lord how it can come
[0:34] across he says and I saw a new Heaven
[0:37] and a new Earth for the first Heaven and
[0:40] the first Earth were passed away and
[0:41] there was no more sea and then he's says
[0:45] and I in I John saw the holy city New
[0:48] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[0:50] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[0:52] her husband and so that phrase to me is
[0:54] very peculiar where he makes this
[0:56] commment as he's describing uh these
[0:58] things he's going to describe the
[0:59] Fountain of Life and uh the city and uh
[1:02] the pure River of Life as he continues
[1:04] there's just so many things he describes
[1:06] and he makes a comment about something
[1:08] that is absent something that is not
[1:10] there and when he says there's no more
[1:12] sea brother Bram in one place says the
[1:14] sea will dry up and another place he
[1:16] says this will change the whole surface
[1:18] of the entire Earth and so that uh fire
[1:21] that's going to come and burn up the
[1:22] Earth uh it it sounds as if maybe it's
[1:25] going to evaporate all the water and
[1:27] things are going to take place and
[1:28] transform and Revitalize the entire
[1:30] surface of the Earth and so John is
[1:33] witnessing as we've been reading in
[1:34] second Peter how there's fire the
[1:36] baptism of fire renovates the Earth
[1:38] Peter John looks at the earth now and he
[1:40] says there's no more sea it kind of
[1:41] stands out to him and we realize now
[1:44] maybe even more than what John perhaps
[1:46] would have just how vast the seas are as
[1:48] far as our visual images and the things
[1:50] that we could see but the sea covers
[1:52] about 71% of the earth I believe it's
[1:54] 97% of the Earth's water are contained
[1:57] in the oceans in the sea and so the
[1:59] absence of the sea was something
[2:01] remarkable to John so he remarks on it
[2:04] something that really stood out to him
[2:06] and it's something that if I could say
[2:09] it's not just John describing saying oh
[2:11] my goodness the city's coming down from
[2:13] heav oh that's interesting there's no
[2:14] water and then he kind of goes back to
[2:16] the big city uh coming down out of
[2:18] Heaven it's something that he notes
[2:20] because he was impressed uh uh to remark
[2:23] that there was no se cuz it holds
[2:26] significance and I hope that you can
[2:28] just quickly enter into the thought
[2:31] today because it's uh every every piece
[2:34] to me is important as I go
[2:36] forward the sea in the Bible was used as
[2:39] a type it's used as a type in scripture
[2:43] and because of its characteristics
[2:45] certain characteristics about the sea
[2:47] and then man's knowledge of it so that
[2:49] someone says well this is like that and
[2:51] if you know what that is then helps you
[2:54] understand what this is and that's
[2:56] exactly how the sea was used its
[2:57] characteristics uh were such that it can
[3:00] be used as a type to understand
[3:02] something because of man's knowledge of
[3:04] it in Isaiah CH 57:20 it says but the
[3:07] wicked are like the troubled sea when it
[3:09] cannot rest whose Waters cast up mire in
[3:12] dirt so it uses the sea to speak about
[3:15] Restless Minds who are driven by
[3:17] passions uh they cast up unbelief and
[3:19] pride and this is what they
[3:21] produce in Jude verse 13 it says it
[3:24] speaks of the wicked these men their
[3:26] Raging Waves of sea foaming out their
[3:29] own shame
[3:30] this is how the sea is characterized
[3:32] that there it's a the Raging ways of the
[3:35] sea the troubless of the sea the sea
[3:37] Foams out its own shame it's in
[3:39] Revelations 13 that we see that the
[3:41] Beast arises from the sea James
[3:44] admonishes Us in chapter 1 ver 6 but let
[3:47] him ask in faith nothing wavering for he
[3:49] that wavereth is like a wave of the sea
[3:52] driven with the wind and tossed there's
[3:55] something about the sea where it's
[3:56] subject to other forces and influences
[3:59] it gets tossed about and uh it's
[4:01] turbulent and uh maybe even mysterious
[4:04] and we know that as the natural types
[4:05] the spiritual the absence of the sea
[4:09] speaks about something and we could just
[4:11] take from these scriptures and see that
[4:13] when John remarks that there was no more
[4:15] sea we could say well there's no more
[4:17] foaming out of Shame there's no more
[4:19] casting up of M and dirt there's it
[4:22] speaks of this eternal Unity of seas
[4:24] divide the land it speaks of this
[4:26] eternal unity and peace as the Bible
[4:29] says that never less according to his
[4:30] promise we look for new heavens and a
[4:32] new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
[4:35] so there there's no more seed there's no
[4:37] more wickedness we talk about how he's
[4:39] cast our sins into the sea uh there's
[4:42] going to be uh the fact that there's no
[4:44] more sea speaks to us of no more unrest
[4:48] no more unsettledness no more sin no
[4:50] more wickedness so when John says
[4:52] there's no more sea it meant
[4:55] something and I would like to look at it
[4:57] in this aspect and I'm kind of using
[4:59] this as a a foundation for some other
[5:01] things if the sea is
[5:03] gone then it must not be necessary and I
[5:07] know it's just a really easy statement
[5:08] to make that if the Sea's not going to
[5:10] be there it must not be necessary to God
[5:12] but its necessity in eternity has been
[5:15] diminished it doesn't need to be there
[5:17] therefore there is no more sea if we
[5:19] still needed the sea God would put the
[5:21] sea there Bible speaks of how that the
[5:23] tree of life is going to be uh
[5:25] ministering healing and there's going to
[5:27] be other elements there pure River of
[5:29] Life there's going to be things in
[5:31] heaven because they're going to serve a
[5:32] purpose and the Sea must not be serving
[5:34] a purpose so the fact that it's gone
[5:37] means it's fulfilled its purpose perhaps
[5:40] or it was it served uh its use and if I
[5:44] could put it this way it was a shadow of
[5:47] something right the Bible as we said
[5:49] already that the Bible speaks of the sea
[5:51] in a certain way and the sea is used as
[5:52] a type for the restlessness of man's
[5:54] mind it's a it was a uh it's a type of
[5:57] being driven just by influences and
[5:59] forces the sea represented something it
[6:02] was just a shadow in Genesis 1: 9 and
[6:07] 10 this is where God gives us the
[6:09] designation of sea and says and God said
[6:12] let the waters under the heaven be
[6:14] gathered together under one place and
[6:16] let the dry land appear and it was so
[6:19] and God called the dry land Earth and
[6:22] the Gathering Together the waters called
[6:24] he sees and God saw that it was good so
[6:27] there was something about this that was
[6:28] good God uses it in the beginning and I
[6:31] want if you could just kind of pick up
[6:32] on the fact that in the end John says
[6:35] there's no more sea but there was a sea
[6:37] in the beginning in the beginning of
[6:39] Creation in Genesis chapter 1 there is a
[6:41] sea and God says it's good but somehow
[6:44] in the end that sea is gone those seas
[6:45] are gone I think that's something to
[6:47] chew on a little bit and brother bradam
[6:50] says in power of transformation he
[6:51] speaks of how God took 6,000 years to
[6:53] make the creation and he says and we see
[6:55] in Genesis 1 and he says yet now we see
[6:58] that in this this God had an objective
[7:01] that he wanted to bring to pass now God
[7:05] uses his creation to tell his story not
[7:08] only in the creation itself but in the
[7:11] creation that has come forth through the
[7:13] uh unfolding of time he used every part
[7:16] for his purpose he's used every part for
[7:18] reason in his program and in doing so he
[7:21] is he is telling something about himself
[7:23] he's putting elements out there that if
[7:25] somebody was putting out material and
[7:27] laying out certain things you could
[7:28] surmise by what doing maybe what they're
[7:30] up to and what they're building and God
[7:33] as a Creator was expressing himself out
[7:35] through his creation and he had an
[7:37] objective that he wanted to bring to
[7:38] pass even in using 6 uh thousand years
[7:42] to create uh the Earth these six days to
[7:45] create the Earth and and uh as we might
[7:47] say 6,000 years it taking these six days
[7:50] to create the Earth the Bible says that
[7:52] six days you shall labor but on the
[7:54] seventh you'll rest and it uses the
[7:57] creation as the basis for that for in
[7:59] six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth
[8:01] and the Sea and all them that in it are
[8:04] in and rested the seventh day so God is
[8:07] using he used the even the days of
[8:10] creation he subsequently uses them as a
[8:12] type that seven as a rest because as God
[8:15] created through six days and on the
[8:17] seventh they took his rest now I'm going
[8:19] to uh give to you a day of rest so there
[8:22] was a deliberate uh purpose in creation
[8:25] there was a precedent being set just
[8:27] even in the days but also here when it
[8:30] comes to the sea that there was
[8:32] something God was wanting to represent
[8:34] in
[8:35] creation and as the Bible says and there
[8:37] was no more sea I want to say there was
[8:40] no more Shadow because God created the
[8:43] Seas and he had an objective in doing it
[8:45] something that he was wanting to express
[8:47] and objective he's wanting to bring to
[8:49] pass and so if he created the sea for an
[8:52] objective and then there's no more sea
[8:54] then its objective must have been
[8:56] satisfying it must have spoke of
[8:58] something and the something something it
[8:59] spoke of has now appeared or it must
[9:01] have represented something it was used
[9:03] for something it had some utility in the
[9:05] Earth as it would go on uh even after
[9:08] the fall God knew it would have some use
[9:10] even as the we use it to travel and it's
[9:12] used for different resources uh uh home
[9:15] to so much animal life God it there's no
[9:18] more see I want say there's no more
[9:20] Shadow there was no more reflection the
[9:23] sea could no longer reflect anything
[9:24] more to us there was no more need for
[9:27] it now this is a a vast subject but I
[9:30] want to just Define at this moment what
[9:32] I mean by
[9:33] shadow that and I'll just use maybe a
[9:35] more technical definition a shadow is a
[9:37] dark area figure created by an opaque
[9:40] object that blocks light from a source
[9:42] so let's say that shadow is when you are
[9:45] W looking at something and and and as
[9:47] you look as your from your Vantage Point
[9:50] uh you see light is being shown upon an
[9:52] object that is not transparent and so
[9:55] the light can't pass through it so as
[9:57] the light um is dispersed around it uh
[10:01] there's a opaque this opaque uh object
[10:04] creates a shadow or an image it's a
[10:06] figure that's created as light is
[10:09] blocked by that figure and so we know
[10:12] it's just a it's a silhouette a
[10:13] two-dimensional silhouette but yet it
[10:15] exists within three-dimensional space or
[10:18] maybe one way look at it it's the
[10:19] reverse projection of the object
[10:23] shape so when we see a shadow the light
[10:26] is shining on something and you don't
[10:28] see the something you see the light as
[10:31] it passes through it creates a
[10:33] silhouette and you you can see the
[10:35] silhouette and you see a a reverse
[10:38] representation in an
[10:40] outline of what the light is shining
[10:43] on I mean if you're if you're kind of
[10:46] into Mysteries and things like that
[10:47] might you might get a little excited
[10:49] just thinking about the way that that's
[10:51] being described that light shining on
[10:53] something and you don't see the
[10:54] something but you just see the reverse
[10:56] Pro projection of the sketch or outline
[10:59] but you know there's got to be something
[11:00] there and there's got to be light there
[11:03] I love how brother bam takes it says yay
[11:05] though I walk through the valley of the
[11:06] shadow of death the the shadow seems
[11:09] pretty scary doesn't it the fact that a
[11:11] shadow like oh my there's shadows and
[11:12] shadows but you know the shadow just
[11:14] testifies of one thing that light is
[11:16] shining so where there's a shadow
[11:18] there's got to be light Bible says in
[11:21] Hebrews chap 10:1 for the law having a
[11:24] shadow of good things to come and not
[11:27] the very image of the thing
[11:29] can never with those sacrifices which
[11:31] they offered year by year continually
[11:34] make the comers there unto perfect now
[11:36] there's things in this that I want you
[11:38] to hold for the future how that the law
[11:40] was a
[11:41] shadow and the with all of its
[11:44] sacrifices and all of its service it can
[11:47] never bring
[11:49] Perfection though it was a shadow now
[11:51] think of what that shadow is and I'll
[11:52] come back to that it was a shadow of it
[11:54] and being a shadow it can never make you
[11:56] perfect but whatever it was the shadow
[12:00] of or the object it was a shadow of
[12:02] that's what could make you perfect is
[12:03] what Paul is saying so the law reflected
[12:06] a sketch or an outline of something the
[12:08] law was a shadow of good things to come
[12:11] so you could have the shadow which is
[12:14] the law but that means the light was
[12:16] shining on a good thing and creating
[12:19] this inverse image in a two-dimensional
[12:21] silhouette that was called a shadow and
[12:23] you look at the Shadow and you say oh
[12:24] this is a good thing you say no it's an
[12:27] outline or it's a prefix or foreshadows
[12:30] it tells me something about what the
[12:32] light is actually shining on and when
[12:34] you think about this a lot of people are
[12:36] dancing in the shadows and a lot of
[12:38] people are excited about Shadows shadows
[12:40] and Silhouettes but we want to be where
[12:42] the light is shining and daning where
[12:45] the light what with in the presence of
[12:47] what the light is shining
[12:50] on so the law was a
[12:53] shadow and I want to say that the sea
[12:57] itself also
[13:00] and I'm just using this beginning part
[13:02] um kind of help me get my legs under me
[13:05] the sea served as an
[13:07] image if it it spoke of something God
[13:10] was very intentional in his creation he
[13:12] had an objective he wanted to bring to
[13:13] pass there's different things that we
[13:15] could speak about the sea and we could
[13:16] just run a concordance search and just
[13:19] read you dozens and dozens of scriptures
[13:21] and quotes about water today and
[13:23] hopefully impress you as you leave but
[13:24] that wouldn't be good at all to do but
[13:26] there was something about the sea that
[13:29] was a a critical but yet now it's not
[13:32] there and I'm say it served its purpose
[13:34] as an
[13:35] image and if I've left you kind of
[13:38] wanting to know a little bit more about
[13:39] the sea maybe we'll come back to it
[13:41] later but I want to look at other
[13:44] Shadows if God could say this about
[13:46] something that covers almost three4 of
[13:48] the earth and is so uh critical to the
[13:52] environment that as we understand it
[13:54] today and I was even reading an article
[13:57] recently how uh even our efforts to
[14:01] reduce uh pollution is causing um
[14:05] temperature sea temperatures to rise
[14:07] because there's no more pollution uh
[14:09] holding back keeping the Sun from
[14:11] reflecting off the ocean and so now now
[14:13] what are you going to
[14:14] do that's interesting but the Seas serve
[14:18] a great purpose but I want to look at
[14:20] other things that God says will be no
[14:22] more in our future
[14:24] home cuz we're not just talking about no
[14:26] more uh sea and all the deep sea
[14:28] fishermen are like we got to fix this
[14:30] what are we going to do and I don't know
[14:32] if there'll be bass in the pure River of
[14:33] Life or not but if it's if it's running
[14:35] cold maybe there can at least be
[14:37] Smallmouth but we're looking at things
[14:39] that God says will be no more in our
[14:42] future home right and in Genesis 1: 16
[14:46] it says God made two great
[14:48] lights the greater light to Rule the Day
[14:51] and the Lesser light to rule the night
[14:53] he made the Stars also we know that
[14:56] these two great lights we know them as
[14:57] the sun and the moon
[14:59] yes and the sun was to Rule the Day and
[15:02] the moon was to rule the
[15:03] night and this is this is something that
[15:07] you've probably picked up on not hard to
[15:08] pick up on but in Genesis chapter 1 at
[15:10] the beginning it says that God said let
[15:12] there be light in the midst of chaos and
[15:15] darkness and confusion God said let
[15:17] there be light and there was light and
[15:19] God saw the light that it was good and
[15:21] God called the light day and the
[15:23] Darkness he called night and this is
[15:25] before it says in verse 16 that he made
[15:27] two great lights to rule the day and
[15:29] rule the night so there's a lot of in
[15:31] the Hebrew Scholars and ones look at
[15:33] this and they see that maybe it was the
[15:35] shakina glory of God that was expressed
[15:37] in that time and made himself visible
[15:39] and made himself known and so it was the
[15:41] glory of God that was originally
[15:43] lighting the Earth the spirit of God
[15:44] moving upon the face of the waters
[15:46] things happening and transpiring as the
[15:48] light of God was being broadcast and
[15:50] shine upon the Earth in the original and
[15:52] that with that light coming light
[15:54] scatters darkness and it creates this
[15:56] division oh well the Earth was in
[15:57] darkness now now that the glory of God
[15:59] is shining now we know a difference
[16:01] between night and day we can see this in
[16:05] total that the sun is being placed in
[16:07] this position to be the great light to
[16:09] those of us who are here on Earth and
[16:12] this light sunlight's going to Rule the
[16:13] Day and the Moon is to rule the night in
[16:15] the darkness he calls night and brother
[16:18] brah says in the sermon turn on the
[16:19] light I believe it was preached right
[16:20] here in Phoenix the sun is a king of all
[16:22] the lights on this Earth in the natural
[16:24] lights no matter how much artificial
[16:27] light we can have and how many great
[16:28] electric Rays we can produce when that
[16:31] sun rises all the rest of them dim out
[16:34] so even in the Sun God had something
[16:37] that was being expressed this son was
[16:40] the king of all the lights on the earth
[16:42] a lot of other lights and man-made
[16:44] lights and lights in the heavens and
[16:45] there's the light of the Moon and all
[16:47] these different ones but the sunlight is
[16:49] the king
[16:50] light and this is God then in the sun is
[16:53] expressing something God in the stars is
[16:55] expressing something we know the stars
[16:57] were his first Bible that Heavens as
[16:59] we'll come to it here in a moment and we
[17:01] see the sun and the moon we see light
[17:04] and we see day and we see night but in
[17:07] Revelations 21: 23 it says and the city
[17:10] had no need of the sun neither of the
[17:13] moon to shine in it for the glory of God
[17:16] did lighten it and the lamb is the light
[17:19] thereof now think of that God in the
[17:22] beginning and and maybe the more that we
[17:24] could read this the more we might begin
[17:25] to think wait a minute he's doing all
[17:27] this stuff over for 6 days and then when
[17:30] we get to the end it's not even going to
[17:31] be
[17:33] there I hope you've heard enough in this
[17:35] series to know that God was putting
[17:37] material out there God was expressing
[17:39] things and showing things in seed form
[17:41] even as Heaven and Earth is embodied in
[17:43] the Garden of Eden and it begins with
[17:45] the garden but when you get to the end
[17:47] there is no Garden that's described
[17:49] doesn't doesn't come back and describe
[17:51] it as a garden or an Eden but we know
[17:53] that what that original Garden that
[17:54] original Eden represented it's now in
[17:56] full bloom the mystery that that was
[17:58] hidden in that Garden is now fully
[17:59] expressed and manifested in the end and
[18:02] so the Bible says the city this New
[18:04] Jerusalem had no need of the sun neither
[18:06] the moon to shine in it but in the
[18:09] beginning God created these two great
[18:10] lights one to rule the day and one to
[18:12] rule the night brother Braham says then
[18:14] the king is that light that will be on
[18:16] top of Mount Zion and His Holy Light
[18:18] will flood the entire city so the
[18:21] sunlight was the king light of all the
[18:23] lights of the Earth the Sun is a king of
[18:25] all the lights and the natural lights
[18:27] and all the other lights dim out in the
[18:29] view of the sunlight H in the natural
[18:32] but now once we get to the New Jerusalem
[18:35] if I could say this and I'm not kind of
[18:36] I hope I'm not stealing my own Thunder
[18:38] but there's no need for types
[18:40] anymore you you don't need the sun
[18:43] shining in that City to tell you that
[18:44] there's a great light or there's a king
[18:46] light you've got the king light could
[18:48] you imagine being in the light of the
[18:50] king and worshiping the son as a
[18:53] God the king is the light of that
[18:56] City so the city will have no need of
[18:58] the sun neither of the moon to shine in
[18:59] it for the glory of God will lighten it
[19:03] it says in Revelations chapter and I'm
[19:05] going a little in a little bit different
[19:06] order here if you're looking in your
[19:08] Bibles but it just seemed to uh flow
[19:10] this way better for me in verse 25 and
[19:12] the gates of it shall not be shut At All
[19:15] by
[19:16] day for there shall be no night
[19:20] there now we see in this city there is
[19:23] no sun there's no moon there's no
[19:26] night as we read in Genesis 15 that God
[19:29] called the light day and the Darkness
[19:30] night but now they're gone why are they
[19:33] gone because they were
[19:35] Shadows they were there they were
[19:38] created only as an outline that's good
[19:41] God wanted them to be there so that we
[19:43] could understand some sort of Rhythm he
[19:45] wanted them to be there so that we could
[19:47] understand a certain process and even by
[19:49] virtue of the the sunrise and the sunet
[19:52] it it would tell something someone say
[19:54] oh well isn't that interesting I see it
[19:56] come up in its strength and it comes to
[19:57] its PE Peak and then it's it waines and
[19:59] it gets weaker and it sets it just even
[20:02] in one day it's told the story of a
[20:03] man's life and there's different ways
[20:05] that the the planets and the Sun and all
[20:08] they told time and and determin Seasons
[20:11] but we're not going to worry that's not
[20:12] going to be there anymore we don't need
[20:15] the types we don't need the Shadows
[20:17] we've got the real thing amen oh I I
[20:20] hope that if this is doing anything I
[20:22] hope that it washes us of some of our
[20:24] theological mindsets sometimes where we
[20:26] just love to have our ears itched by
[20:28] types and shadows and not glorying in
[20:32] the real thing that is with us and
[20:34] missing the substance that God has
[20:36] delivered to
[20:39] us it says there'll be no more sun no
[20:42] more moon and the gates of the city will
[20:45] never be shut you know this it's because
[20:48] there's going to be no night
[20:51] there I don't know if uh are 7-Eleven
[20:54] still
[20:56] 24/7 I guess even in it's name it
[20:58] doesn't make sense anymore because I
[20:59] believe it was originally called 711
[21:01] because it was open from 7eleven and
[21:03] then they became known as the like the
[21:05] original
[21:06] 24/7 and so the New Jerusalem all those
[21:09] are just Shadows of the New Jerusalem
[21:12] which I guess it's not going to be 24/7
[21:13] because there's not going to be sevens
[21:14] it's not going to be 24s it's just
[21:16] eternity
[21:18] eternity there the city is not going to
[21:21] be shut because there's going to be no
[21:22] night there's no need for Gates why did
[21:25] they have Gates why did they shut down
[21:27] the city for because Darkness fell but
[21:30] now there's not going to be any need
[21:32] anymore in the sermon Redemption by
[21:34] power brother said the Old Testament was
[21:37] a shadow of the New Testament it was the
[21:40] negative like the moon to the sun the
[21:43] sun shining on the moon reflects the
[21:45] light to the Earth that's kind of just
[21:46] showing us how God was using these
[21:48] elements in the sky to speak something
[21:51] and I just love the Old Testament it's
[21:52] just full of Parables like that in
[21:54] Genesis when God made the sun first the
[21:56] moon next the moon and son represents
[21:59] Christ and the
[22:03] church so God had the son in the moon to
[22:06] represent something just as the sun
[22:08] comes up in its power and glory and when
[22:10] it goes down it reflects its light to
[22:12] the moon and in the darkness to give
[22:13] light on the earth why the sun is gone
[22:16] this is just a type that brother B is
[22:17] using Jesus when he left he went into
[22:19] glory and reflected his light back on
[22:21] the church to give the church the light
[22:23] of the Gospel until he returns and
[22:25] they'll get married and then they'll get
[22:27] married now you got to fast forward to
[22:29] the invisible union now and think of
[22:32] this and then they'll get married
[22:33] that'll be wonderful it'll be one great
[22:35] light of moon and and we know it would
[22:37] be the sun when they marri the light of
[22:39] the moon shall be as the light of the
[22:41] sun this is now not a division or a
[22:43] separation but what was separated as sun
[22:46] and moon and one reflected the other
[22:48] these are physical things that are used
[22:52] to express a greater truth or greater
[22:55] reality and he's saying now if we have
[22:57] the son and the moon and their types if
[23:00] in reality the two unite together we
[23:03] can't let the Shadows get our mind
[23:06] discombobulate said no no there's got to
[23:08] if there's it's got to be separate you
[23:10] can't have you've always got to have a
[23:11] moon you've always got to Sun have a sun
[23:13] that means you have to you would have to
[23:15] accept a paradigm where the church is
[23:17] never in the presence of the
[23:20] Sun that it would only be reflecting
[23:22] something and the and you are only in
[23:24] the reflection of the church and not
[23:27] Christ that's good and so the
[23:30] alternating brother BR says the lamb is
[23:32] the light thereof they need no more sun
[23:35] in that City it'll be the great light of
[23:36] Moon and Sun and when he says the lamb
[23:39] is the light thereof they'll need no
[23:40] more sun in that City that it's now this
[23:44] is I apologize I've just been uh
[23:47] struggling a lot lately with different
[23:48] things but
[23:51] there's now we can see that what the sun
[23:54] represented that was Christ the moon
[23:57] represents the Bride of the church now
[24:00] they're United together in the reality
[24:02] that God's objective was in the
[24:03] beginning so we don't need the moon to
[24:06] represent every anything the bride is
[24:07] there with her bridegroom we don't need
[24:10] the Sun for light the lamb is the light
[24:12] thereof because it says for the glory of
[24:14] God did light it and the lamb is the
[24:15] light thereof we will have the glory of
[24:18] God through the lamb to lighten us and
[24:20] the bride will be United one with her
[24:22] groom so we don't need the shadow
[24:26] anymore so this alter of night and day
[24:28] as brother bam is using it here it
[24:31] reflected a spiritual pattern on the
[24:33] earth God was using it as an
[24:36] image in Psalms 19 1-6 the heavens
[24:39] declare the glory of God in the
[24:40] firmament showeth his handiwork they
[24:42] they express something about God they
[24:45] tell us something about God it was his
[24:46] first Bible and notice how it says the
[24:48] heavens declar the glory of God but in
[24:50] the new city the glory of God will be
[24:52] declared itself the firmament shows his
[24:55] handiwork but there in this eternal City
[24:57] the lamb is the light
[25:00] thereof but yet here on Earth we see
[25:02] that day andto Day utth speech and night
[25:04] unto night showeth knowledge there is no
[25:07] speech nor language where their voice is
[25:08] not heard so the stars are speaking the
[25:11] planets are speaking their line has gone
[25:14] out through all the Earth and their
[25:15] words to the end of the world this is
[25:18] their declaration they're there for all
[25:20] to see and all to hear and God has put
[25:21] it there during in time in the on Earth
[25:25] for man to see that to speak of his
[25:28] greatness to speak of his power it's
[25:30] declaring the glory of God but when we
[25:32] get there you don't need the Heavens to
[25:35] declare it I hope that's making sense
[25:38] maybe it's just too simple today for
[25:42] you their line is gone through all the
[25:44] Earth and their words to the end of the
[25:46] world in them hath he set a tabernacle
[25:49] for the sun now you just see a beautiful
[25:52] picture uh being placed that the heavens
[25:54] are going to declare his handiwork and
[25:58] how the there's the the stars are
[26:01] expressing something and even in their
[26:03] own gases allowing the reflection of
[26:06] light and certain things being expressed
[26:08] and even God's Great Beauty and creation
[26:11] and the just how vast these galaxies are
[26:14] it speaks something about God he says
[26:16] but in these Heavens as we hear on Earth
[26:18] in them he set a tabernacle for the sun
[26:21] the sun now is embodied in these great
[26:23] Heavens the heavens are to be
[26:25] tabernacled by the Sun which is as a
[26:28] bridegroom coming out of his chamber and
[26:30] rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race
[26:33] his going forth is from the end of
[26:35] heaven and a circuit under the ends of
[26:36] it and there's nothing hid from the heat
[26:39] thereof now look at all the types that
[26:42] this writer this pist is being able to
[26:45] express in the the natural orbit of
[26:49] planets and the natural course of the
[26:52] the Earth around the Sun and the
[26:54] rotation of the earth he's saying this
[26:56] speaks something to us
[26:58] it speaks of God's glory and God's
[26:59] handiwork and God has put a tabernacle
[27:03] uh the the heavens as a tabernacle for
[27:05] the sun and the Sun is like the
[27:07] bridegroom uh when the it when it is the
[27:10] rising of the sun it is the bridegroom
[27:12] having come out of his chamber and now
[27:15] he's going to have a circuit he's going
[27:17] to have some sort of course and it's
[27:19] heat is going to have an impact upon the
[27:21] Earth and that heat is going to
[27:23] influence this and it's going to cause
[27:25] this to happen and it cause that to
[27:26] happen and he's using all these natural
[27:29] things and we can say my what a
[27:30] beautiful type and
[27:33] Shadow Hallelujah but we realize that
[27:36] these things just spoke of
[27:38] Christ in John 1:9 speaking of Jesus
[27:42] Christ that was the True Light which
[27:45] lith every man that cometh into the
[27:47] world we have a natural light we have a
[27:49] greater light and a lesser light we have
[27:51] a sun and moon and we're all familiar
[27:53] with it and we can identify it we can
[27:55] see it but yet the this sun this great
[27:57] son was a type of
[28:00] Christ the sunlight was merely a shadow
[28:03] of the True Light that was to
[28:05] come the sun reflected in the natural to
[28:09] us light lifegiving resource and without
[28:12] light nothing can live and and we maybe
[28:13] have a lot of different ways we could
[28:15] describe it but it was there as a
[28:17] placeholder it was there to do things on
[28:20] earth and the natural it was there to
[28:22] sustain life it was there to be used for
[28:24] times and seasons and God had a purpose
[28:26] for that son but when we get to
[28:28] Revelations 21 the city has no need of
[28:30] the sun it has no need of the Moon
[28:32] because the glory of the Lord does light
[28:34] the city and the lamb is the light
[28:36] thereof because Christ is who was
[28:38] reflected the sun was reflecting it was
[28:41] a shadow of the True
[28:44] Light the shadow of the True Light that
[28:46] was to
[28:49] come so there is no more
[28:52] sea there's no more sun there's no more
[28:56] Moon
[28:59] these are things that are just
[29:01] Shadows now I hope that this can serve
[29:04] as
[29:06] a uh foundation for going forward in
[29:09] some things because this is going to
[29:10] give you a lot to think
[29:13] about in Revelations 21:22 he says and I
[29:16] saw no Temple
[29:18] therein for the Lord God Almighty and
[29:20] the lamb are the Temple of
[29:26] it
[29:27] I want to pause just so you can think
[29:30] about a statement that John just
[29:35] said he sees he's making note he sees
[29:38] everything that is he is witnessing he's
[29:41] making note of things he doesn't
[29:44] see and there's different ways of
[29:47] looking at this especially in the Bible
[29:49] maybe this is a principle that could be
[29:53] helpful there's ways that prophets
[29:55] describe things because they're
[29:56] picturing it it it's not a photograph
[29:59] they're picturing it does that make
[30:01] sense when you picture something you say
[30:03] oh someone describes you go oh you know
[30:05] what I picture that as being like this
[30:08] and so there's times when a prophet is
[30:10] conveying even brother brandham in one
[30:11] place he sees an image so there's
[30:14] something that's pictured he's not
[30:15] seeing a photograph like a driver's
[30:16] license there's an image being projected
[30:18] and he says and and I may get it
[30:20] reversed but he says you're Mrs strong
[30:22] and he corrects himself say I mean
[30:24] Stout because he there in the image BR
[30:27] wasn't looking at a photograph and
[30:29] misread her driver's license as M as Mrs
[30:32] strong but there was a picture he was
[30:34] picturing something and if you pictured
[30:36] something as being Stout you might
[30:38] picture the same thing and say strong
[30:40] right and so John as he's witnessing
[30:43] this that maybe some could argue well
[30:45] he's he's just picturing what this must
[30:48] be like that oh there's going to be no
[30:49] more sea because there's no sin there's
[30:51] no turbulence uh there there's no uh
[30:54] waves and no foaming out but yet go John
[30:56] is describing something that he sees
[30:59] that is beh before him and though
[31:01] there's a lot of symbolism and a lot of
[31:03] ways that he's picturing it he is noting
[31:06] what he does not see or he's using
[31:08] either a picture you want to take it at
[31:10] a photograph it means something he's
[31:12] expressing something and say oh there's
[31:15] no
[31:16] sea oh there's no sun there's no moon
[31:19] the lamb is the light thereof and he
[31:21] says now this would have been a mouthful
[31:22] for a Hebrew there's no Temple
[31:26] there
[31:27] I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God
[31:31] Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of
[31:37] it in the sermon the future home of the
[31:39] Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[31:42] bride if you haven't if you haven't
[31:44] listened to it you
[31:46] should he says all of this Earth this
[31:49] Earth we here live in now everyone
[31:52] whether it be Christian or Pagan has
[31:54] temples if I could just kind of
[31:57] embellish that a little bit every
[31:59] country Every Nation every place you go
[32:01] they all have temples and he said
[32:03] Christian or
[32:04] Pagan I wasn't even I wasn't thinking of
[32:07] this quote but uh just as we pulled in
[32:09] driving up to church today uh we saw
[32:11] temples we see Tabernacles we see
[32:14] churches um all sorts of uh gathering
[32:17] places and in other countries you'll
[32:19] find temples you'll find houses of
[32:22] worship says everywhere you
[32:25] go wherever there's Humanity there's an
[32:28] altar there's a Temple there's a place
[32:30] of worship a place where the deity is
[32:33] represented a place where people can
[32:35] give service to that deity or worship
[32:37] that deity he said do you ever think of
[32:39] that churches all of them but this one
[32:42] doesn't have any I may be giving F to
[32:45] those who don't believe in going to
[32:46] church that just claim they're in the
[32:48] eighth day but he says there's there's
[32:52] no in this one it doesn't have any
[32:55] temples the the Bible says and there was
[32:58] no Temple there but the Lord God in the
[33:00] lamb is the Temple of it he he lamb is
[33:05] the light the lamb is light the lamb is
[33:06] the temple the lamb is the throne the
[33:09] lamb is the life he is that Temple I
[33:12] hope you can kind of catch the rhythm of
[33:14] this a little bit that there was things
[33:16] in the Old Testament brother said were a
[33:18] shadow they were a negative and then
[33:21] when Christ came he was the developed
[33:23] picture he was the substance and so when
[33:25] you go back and you look at the Shadow
[33:27] oh man the Shadow's great oh man the
[33:28] Shadow's beautiful oh man the Shadow the
[33:30] Shadow the Shadow the shadow it's like
[33:31] well I'm standing here the light is
[33:33] shining on me you're looking at my
[33:35] shadow here I am and then all there's so
[33:39] many other things that were set here on
[33:41] Earth as Shadows so many things that
[33:45] just represent something that just show
[33:47] us something we can have a shadow and
[33:49] the shadow testifies that there's light
[33:51] and the shadow also testifies there's
[33:52] something blocking that
[33:54] light but when you get rid of The Shadow
[33:57] you've get you've either come to the
[33:58] object itself or you removed an
[34:03] obstruction and look at he says the lamb
[34:05] is the light the lamb is the temple the
[34:06] lamb is the throne the lamb is the life
[34:08] he is that Temple all these temples have
[34:11] an object they're worshiping but in this
[34:13] city he is the
[34:16] object he is with his people his Spirit
[34:20] Light floods the pyramid City there he's
[34:24] describing it once again how that there
[34:26] will be no need for for the sun because
[34:28] his glory will lighten it'll flood the
[34:30] pyramid
[34:32] City to make this statement so I if I
[34:34] could just reset it there will be no
[34:36] Temple there Christ says the Lord God
[34:40] Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of
[34:45] it the temple is a significant structure
[34:48] in the word of
[34:50] God but from this we could see that God
[34:53] was only using it as a placeholder right
[34:55] amen he was only using it as a
[34:59] type the temple itself even how God
[35:02] arranged it and I I think I could easily
[35:04] just get sidetracked into these details
[35:06] now but he arranged it to tell the story
[35:08] of redemption in
[35:11] Earth and how that uh even that even
[35:14] itself and the way that it was
[35:16] structured was to show Earth the heavens
[35:19] and the holy of holies the heavens of
[35:21] Heavens that and even as they looked at
[35:23] that Veil when you passed through the
[35:25] veil it was as if your passing into
[35:28] heaven itself and so the Tabernacle in
[35:31] the wilderness the temple they were
[35:33] outlined they were arranged to to be an
[35:36] image yes sir to reflect something on
[35:39] Earth to not be a
[35:41] replacement and to not be the end all
[35:44] but to be the thing that could speak of
[35:46] it as he says he ha the heavens declared
[35:49] the glory of God and the firmament show
[35:51] us his hand his handiwork and the Sun is
[35:53] declaring the glory of Christ but the
[35:55] city will have no need of the Sun that
[35:56] means that it served its
[35:58] purpose it it was never to replace God's
[36:02] glory uh the moon was never meant to
[36:04] replace the invisible Union and there's
[36:07] something about those images that once
[36:09] they've served their purpose once
[36:10] they've kind of spoke to you the truth
[36:12] and you can come to the greater reality
[36:14] you want the greater
[36:16] reality so even the temple itself was
[36:19] arranged to tell a
[36:22] story it was just a shadow of heaven
[36:24] right in Hebrews chapter 9: 23 and
[36:28] 24 now if I could I'll say it this way
[36:31] because I I've tried to make this point
[36:33] through several services that now as we
[36:36] have this uh division of dimensions in
[36:40] eternity there's not going to be that
[36:42] division it's just going to be the one
[36:44] Eternal Dimension and however you might
[36:46] want to describe that that collapses and
[36:48] expands and how how let's just say that
[36:50] there's not going to be a trinity below
[36:52] there's not going to be a trinity above
[36:54] there's not going to be the fourth
[36:55] dimension of science there's not going
[36:56] to be di menion of souls waiting under
[36:57] the altar right there's not going to be
[36:59] hell or showel Hades or the grave the
[37:02] Lake of Fire is going to uh eventually
[37:04] just evaporate and it's all going to be
[37:05] gone and so there's only going to be one
[37:07] thing it's called
[37:10] eternity and in Hebrews 9 veres 23 to 24
[37:13] it says it was therefore necessary that
[37:16] the patterns of things in the heavens
[37:19] should be purified with these speaking
[37:21] of water but the Heavenly things
[37:22] themselves with better sacrifices than
[37:25] these recognize what Paul is saying I
[37:29] know I'm jumping into a lot here in
[37:30] Hebrews but the patterns of things he's
[37:33] referring to is the temple the
[37:35] sacrifices the priesthood whether you
[37:37] want to call it the utensils and the
[37:38] clothing everything saying these things
[37:40] were all
[37:41] purified with natural things and these
[37:44] things there were sacrifices made to
[37:46] purify things there was water used to
[37:47] purify things there was ashes that were
[37:49] used in certain ways he says the these
[37:51] things were patterns of things in heaven
[37:55] and they had to be purified but the
[37:57] Heavenly things themselves with better
[37:59] sacrifices than these in other words we
[38:01] use these elements to purify these
[38:03] things but these things were just a
[38:04] pattern of heavenly things so then he
[38:07] says for Christ has not entered into the
[38:09] holy Place made with hands he didn't
[38:11] have to enter into the temple he didn't
[38:14] have to go in behind the veil if he
[38:16] would have he would have been like where
[38:19] is it right there was no Ark of the
[38:21] Covenant there's no blood on The Mercy
[38:24] Seat because Christ didn't enter into
[38:26] into the type he didn't enter into the
[38:29] shadow he didn't enter into the pattern
[38:31] Christ entered into it says here which
[38:34] are he doesn't enter into the place made
[38:36] with hands which are figures of the true
[38:39] but he entered into heaven
[38:41] itself what the the Earthly Tabernacle
[38:45] was a shadow of the Heavenly Temple the
[38:48] Earthly Tabernacle was a shadow of the
[38:50] Heavenly realm Christ didn't have to
[38:52] enter into the shadow he entered into
[38:54] the
[38:55] real
[38:57] and there appeared in the presence of
[38:58] God for
[39:00] us and so when it says that Christ
[39:03] entered into heaven itself and not the
[39:07] holy Place made with hands or the
[39:09] patterns of things that are in heaven or
[39:11] so the patterns of the figures the
[39:13] figures there in the Greek is the
[39:15] antitype and so the antitype so you have
[39:18] type and antitype the type is the
[39:23] shadow talking about shadows and types
[39:26] the type is well that's a type of this
[39:28] and that's a type of that and that's a
[39:30] and whenever you have a type you don't
[39:33] ever start with the type you start with
[39:35] the truth that's where you want to start
[39:38] if you can is don't just start figuring
[39:40] out things and say well they walked
[39:42] around Jericho uh seven time what seven
[39:45] times and so I got to do seven of these
[39:48] and kind of come up with these different
[39:49] types and things that's just where you
[39:51] get some really interesting
[39:53] stuff but if there's a type or there's a
[39:56] Shadow you really don't know what it is
[39:58] until you know the truth well that's a
[40:01] shadow of something okay yeah it's a
[40:02] shadow of something but what is it and
[40:04] we're all just playing uh the blot game
[40:07] all right with the ink blot we're just
[40:08] looking at the roar Shack test what do
[40:10] you see well right and we're just all
[40:13] trying to tell you what we see we want
[40:15] to know the real and here he saying the
[40:17] patterns the things on earth were a
[40:19] pattern the holy place on Earth was a
[40:21] figure yes they were types but now
[40:24] Heaven itself is the antitype right and
[40:27] an antitype in the scripture brother B
[40:29] uses the phrase antitype but it speaks
[40:31] of the greater reality to which the type
[40:35] points catch this please the antitype is
[40:39] the greater reality to which the type
[40:40] was pointing and which in which the type
[40:44] is fulfilled right that's good that I if
[40:47] someone says I'm a type I'm a type that
[40:48] means you're you're only part you're
[40:51] only an outline you're only a sketch and
[40:54] it's great to have the type but the sh
[40:56] Shadow only means there's an object and
[40:58] there's a light shining on the object
[41:00] and I want to know whether the object is
[41:02] the real thing or just an obstruction
[41:04] from the light so when you come to the
[41:07] antitype you have what the shadow spoke
[41:10] of because there in it the it's the
[41:13] greater reality so you have the greater
[41:15] reality to which the type pointed or you
[41:17] have the object that the shadow was
[41:19] created by
[41:21] it so a type is a person a place an
[41:25] event in Scripture
[41:26] if we look at types there PL persons
[41:28] places events or things that have a
[41:30] historical reality we see a type it has
[41:33] some sort of historical reality but is
[41:36] also designed by God to foreshadow
[41:38] something or prefigure something a real
[41:40] person event a place or
[41:43] thing so the temple was a type the
[41:47] temple was a shadow it has historical
[41:49] reality out of Egypt have I called my
[41:52] son you say oh well that was when he
[41:53] called Israel out of Egypt but that was
[41:56] historical reality but it was a shadow
[41:58] and type of Christ coming out of Egypt
[42:00] you catch that and I realized that there
[42:02] was a lot of just simple fundamentals
[42:04] today that was either review for you or
[42:06] maybe just good good things to put in
[42:07] our toolbox a little bit to understand
[42:09] the word of God as we study the message
[42:10] of the hour as we pray and read our
[42:12] Bibles so I know some of this is just
[42:14] kind of granular fundamental things but
[42:16] in that now let's just take that
[42:18] principle that God will use a person
[42:20] place thing or an event as a type
[42:23] meaning he wants to use it though it has
[42:25] a historical reality in existence God's
[42:28] designed it or allowed it to foreshadow
[42:31] or prefigure something
[42:34] else and that is exactly what the temple
[42:37] represented the Bible says the Lord is
[42:39] in his holy Temple and the Lord's Throne
[42:41] is in heaven and to a Jew they would
[42:43] just say no it's a it's the Tabernacle
[42:46] on Earth it's the temple on Earth but
[42:48] the Lord is in his holy Temple and the
[42:50] Lord's Throne is in
[42:53] heaven brother BR said everything in the
[42:55] earth is just a pattern of that which is
[42:56] in
[42:57] heaven to the Hebrews the Jewish writers
[43:00] I going back over many different things
[43:02] on this subject they say the structure
[43:04] of the Tabernacle corresponds to the
[43:05] structure of Heaven and
[43:07] Earth so the Tabernacle was a pattern of
[43:11] things in Heavens the temple was a tab a
[43:13] pattern of things in heaven the holy of
[43:15] holies was a figure of the real
[43:19] thing when Moses was making the
[43:22] Tabernacle in the wilderness in Exodus
[43:24] 25: 8 and9 and let them make me a
[43:26] sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[43:28] the Lord is in his holy Temple the
[43:30] Lord's Throne is in heaven there's a
[43:32] place that God is and now he's saying
[43:35] this is this is my or this is my where I
[43:38] am
[43:39] originally but make me a place on Earth
[43:42] let them make me a sanctuary that I may
[43:43] dwell among them so the temple was going
[43:45] to represent God's dwelling place on
[43:47] Earth amongst his people he says
[43:49] according to all that I show
[43:51] thee after the pattern of the
[43:54] Tabernacle and the pattern of all the
[43:56] instruments thereof even so shall you
[43:58] make it now what was the pattern that
[44:02] God was going to show him the Lord is in
[44:05] his holy Temple the Lord's Throne is in
[44:06] heaven so this is where God dwelt this
[44:09] is the original and now he said would
[44:11] you make me a a sanctuary on Earth I'll
[44:15] show you the pattern I'll show you the
[44:18] blueprint I'll show you my Holy Temple
[44:20] in heaven I'll show you my Thro in
[44:22] heaven and that'll give you the design
[44:24] for how this is to be copied on Earth so
[44:27] the Earthly Tabernacle and the Earthly
[44:29] Temple were copy or shadow of the temple
[44:31] in
[44:32] heaven Revelations 11:19 says and the
[44:34] temple of God was opened in
[44:36] heaven and in his Temple the Ark of his
[44:39] Testament so we see then that what was
[44:42] built on Earth wasn't first it was first
[44:46] in
[44:47] heaven and we could say that the what
[44:49] was on Earth is a shadow it's a type it
[44:51] has historical reality but it doesn't
[44:54] necessarily mean that the exact image in
[44:57] heaven has to be specifically and
[44:59] exactly like what's here on Earth it
[45:02] represents something just in the
[45:04] absorption of light and the refle
[45:06] refraction and how the pattern the
[45:08] silhouette can hide a lot of images can
[45:11] hide a lot of
[45:12] details you can see you can see a figure
[45:15] or an outline in a shadow and it can
[45:17] tell you something but it's not going to
[45:19] tell you everything that you need to
[45:24] know
[45:27] I wish I had some of brother Lonnie's
[45:28] transparencies right now I could do a
[45:30] lot of Shadow
[45:35] stuff I need his overhead projector
[45:38] first right that's that's what's missing
[45:40] is that you can't find the bulbs
[45:45] anymore so it says the temple of God was
[45:47] opened in heaven in Revelations 15 it
[45:49] says the temple the Tabernacle the
[45:50] testimony in heaven was opened these are
[45:53] things in heaven right originally
[45:56] and I I hope you could follow this
[45:57] because there's things I hope you're
[45:58] connecting yourself in this and I have a
[46:00] lot of hopes this
[46:02] morning that if it's in heaven and now
[46:04] it's on Earth this is the
[46:06] shadow but when we come when we come to
[46:10] the eighth day and we come to the new
[46:11] Heaven and new earth there there is no
[46:14] more Temple that we see on Earth and
[46:18] there is no more other dimension of
[46:20] heaven where the Lord's Throne is and
[46:22] where the Lord is in his holy Temple
[46:23] that's with man now so you have to have
[46:26] that in mind I I so for this to really
[46:28] be connecting it says in Hebrews chapter
[46:31] 8:5 speaking again of the the priesthood
[46:34] and the service in the temple who serve
[46:37] under the example and Shadow of heavenly
[46:40] things as Moses was admonished of God
[46:43] when he was about to make the Tabernacle
[46:45] what did God tell him to do don't make
[46:47] it with your ideas of what you saw in
[46:48] Babylon don't do with what you saw in
[46:50] Egypt don't do it in the pattern of what
[46:52] other people in the world would do or
[46:54] what you would in your mind like but but
[46:55] I'll show you an image in heaven and
[46:57] that's the pattern that I want you to
[46:59] replicate on Earth so he made a
[47:02] tabernacle and put people in service on
[47:04] Earth to serve as an example and a
[47:06] shadow of heavenly
[47:09] things because God admonished him see
[47:12] saith he that thou make all things
[47:14] according to the pattern showed to thee
[47:16] in the mount and that's just drawing
[47:18] from Exodus 25 it was Moses making the
[47:22] temple after the pattern that was in
[47:24] heaven
[47:27] now this Temple means so
[47:31] much on Earth it means so much even to
[47:33] where is a very symbol to the Jews when
[47:36] a tabernacle was being rebuilt and being
[47:38] restored and it has such significance
[47:41] but now in Revelations 21:22 and I saw
[47:44] no Temple
[47:46] therein think of everything that this
[47:48] Temple meant to a
[47:49] Jew when you're in distress in a foreign
[47:52] land just turn your face toward the
[47:54] temple and pray and I will hear and for
[47:58] a Judah said now which way would I need
[47:59] to face where do I need to turn where
[48:01] where do I need to point my eyes cuz if
[48:03] I will just do these things God has said
[48:05] that he'll hear and and it had such
[48:07] significance the temple they came back
[48:09] to Jerusalem three times a year to
[48:11] worship it was required to do it come
[48:14] back to the temple come back to the
[48:16] temple come back to the temple and it
[48:18] becomes a great dispute uh even when
[48:21] Jesus meets the woman at the well says
[48:23] well you guys say that we need to
[48:24] worship here or we worship in Jerusalem
[48:27] and we can worship in the mountains and
[48:28] you know what Jesus says he doesn't say
[48:29] you better believe it you got to come to
[48:30] Jerusalem he says the time is coming and
[48:34] now is and he doesn't say anything about
[48:35] going to Jerusalem he just says you're
[48:37] going to have to Worship in spirit and
[48:38] Truth The Very things that spoke of the
[48:41] Tabernacle spoke of the very things the
[48:42] temple spoke of the very witness of it
[48:45] he's saying you can now Worship in
[48:47] spirit and truth you don't have to go to
[48:48] Mecca you don't have to go to
[48:50] Jeffersonville every Easter to be in the
[48:52] bride you're in the presence of Christ
[48:54] right now amen you don't have to go to
[48:57] Mecca you don't have to go to the whing
[48:58] wall God has by the way of Jesus Christ
[49:02] abolished the veil and took away the
[49:04] geographical
[49:07] requirement because he says there is no
[49:09] Temple for the Lord God Almighty and the
[49:11] lamb are the Temple of
[49:13] it there's no Temple because the temple
[49:16] was a type of
[49:17] Christ Israel is a type of Heaven
[49:20] Jerusalem was a type of of of the of the
[49:24] the temple and here
[49:26] Christ Christ is on
[49:30] Earth so now Heaven is on Earth he's
[49:34] telling the woman at the well the time
[49:36] is coming I when God you'll have to
[49:38] Worship in spirit and in truth not in
[49:39] the mountains not in Jerusalem but in
[49:41] spirit and truth and that's how you
[49:42] worship God that's how the true
[49:44] worshippers will worship him because the
[49:46] temple is the type of Christ in
[49:49] Colossians 216 and 17 says let no man
[49:51] therefore judge you in meat or in drink
[49:53] or in respect of a holy day or of the
[49:55] new moon or of the Sabbath days that
[49:58] that puts a lot of stuff in view he says
[50:01] which are a shadow of things to
[50:04] come the the moons the festivals the
[50:06] holy days the Sabbath days all these
[50:09] elements in the law in the Tabernacle in
[50:11] the temple in the Levites in the
[50:13] priesthood and all the utensils in all
[50:15] the ceremony and all the service it was
[50:18] there as a shadow of things to come he
[50:21] says but the body is of Christ in other
[50:23] words the substance is is of Christ
[50:27] Christ is the substance of those things
[50:30] he says oh don't get don't man let men
[50:32] judge you in meat and drink and holy day
[50:34] and New Moon and Sabbath days CU those
[50:36] spoke of Christ Christ is the anti-type
[50:40] Christ is the object Christ is the light
[50:43] Christ is the one that those spoke of
[50:45] they were the Shadows Christ is the
[50:49] substance brother Bram said it was a
[50:51] shadow until the real came
[50:53] along these things were shadow shs now
[50:55] in Christ there's no more
[50:58] Shadow there's no more going to the
[51:00] temple three times a year and offering
[51:02] up sacrifices and Performing our worship
[51:04] during these feast days now in Christ
[51:06] he's abolished that now we've entered
[51:09] into our rest Christ is our Sabbath
[51:11] there was a Saturday that typed it but
[51:13] now we don't have to wait till Saturday
[51:16] we have them now he is our rest
[51:20] amen the Bible says in John
[51:23] 1:14 and the Word was made flesh dwelt
[51:25] among us this is Christ the
[51:28] temple this is Christ the
[51:31] son the word was made flesh and dwelt
[51:34] Among Us and John says and we beheld his
[51:36] glory the glory is of the only begotten
[51:38] of the father full of grace and truth we
[51:42] beheld his glory as the light that
[51:45] lighted the Earth in the beginning when
[51:49] God said let there be light now when
[51:51] Christ comes the prophecy is that great
[51:53] light will spring up to those who are in
[51:54] the regions of Darkness Darkness now the
[51:56] True Light that lights all men had come
[51:58] the light had come there was the sun
[52:01] reflected as now the sun is
[52:03] here and we beheld his
[52:06] glory the glory of God that would have
[52:08] lightened the Earth but this is also the
[52:10] glory of God that would have filled the
[52:13] temple in Exodus 40 the cloud covered
[52:16] the tent of the congregation and the
[52:18] glory of the Lord filled the
[52:21] Tabernacle here's the glory Lord it was
[52:23] and it's remarkable how the scriptures
[52:25] speak of it and that there's the glory
[52:27] of the Lord fills the Tabernacle and
[52:29] they're not even able to perform their
[52:31] service cuz it's so great in First Kings
[52:34] chapter 8 in the dedication of the
[52:36] temple that the priest had come out of
[52:38] the Holy place and the cloud filled the
[52:40] house of the Lord so the priest could
[52:43] not stand to minister because of the
[52:44] cloud for the glory of the Lord had
[52:46] filled the house of the Lord so Moses
[52:48] made a tabernacle where God would dwell
[52:50] among his people Solomon built a temple
[52:53] where God would dwell among his people
[52:54] and God declared his presence by his
[52:56] glory filling the house and John says we
[53:01] beheld the glory of God what was this
[53:03] testifying of the temple was Christ you
[53:07] don't have to go to Jerusalem that was a
[53:09] shadow the glory of God filled the
[53:11] shadow but now Christ is the
[53:15] body the glory of God was in Jesus
[53:17] Christ he was the true Temple that the
[53:20] old Temple pointed
[53:22] to and since the true sacrifice had come
[53:26] what the Old Testament sacrifices
[53:28] pointed to the moons and the feast days
[53:30] and the Sabbath days all these things
[53:33] were Shadows of heavenly things they
[53:36] were a pattern in heaven but now that
[53:38] Christ has come Christ is the body yes
[53:41] sir there's no need of the old
[53:44] Temple there's no need of that old
[53:48] altar but it says the Lord the glory of
[53:50] the Lord filled the
[53:53] Tabernacle the glory of the Lord filled
[53:55] the house of the
[54:00] Lord the house of the Lord in the house
[54:04] of
[54:05] God is always referred to as the temple
[54:07] in the Old
[54:10] Testament because
[54:14] God I guess this speaks
[54:17] to how the I the picture that I see and
[54:21] why I've been ministering along these
[54:22] lines and making some of these same
[54:24] statements
[54:25] is God's in heaven we're on Earth and
[54:30] then there are certain things that are
[54:31] temporary here as types and shadows and
[54:34] then once they're kind of done away with
[54:35] we're left with you better have lived
[54:37] right because if you didn't you're not
[54:39] going to heaven you're going to hell and
[54:42] you'll come across it over and over and
[54:43] over again eternal hell Eternal Heaven
[54:45] The Souls of men are Eternal and you
[54:47] just choose which way where you want to
[54:48] spin eternity and that's a lie of the
[54:50] devil because there is no eternal hell
[54:53] and because it misses the concept of
[54:54] redemption
[54:56] there is no eternal hell because there's
[54:57] no Redemption for those in hell so
[55:00] there's no eternity there's no Eternal
[55:02] purpose in that so this is where you see
[55:05] God now creates a tabernacle has them
[55:07] build a tabernacle on Earth and it's
[55:08] going to reflect the Lord who is in his
[55:10] temple in heaven the Lord's Throne is in
[55:13] heaven but now he has a
[55:15] house and he wants it modeled in earth
[55:18] right he wants it built on
[55:21] earth Isaiah 66:1 thus sayith the Lord
[55:24] the heaven is my throne and the Earth is
[55:25] my foot stol where is the house that
[55:28] you'll build unto me and where is the
[55:31] place of my
[55:33] rest the way that God created in the
[55:37] beginning with this expanse of
[55:40] Dimensions with angels and Realms and
[55:44] kingdoms it's all it's placed within
[55:47] this aspect of time to tell his story to
[55:51] accomplish an objective and then once
[55:53] he's accomplished it there's going going
[55:55] to be a removing of things that are no
[55:57] longer necessary there's going to be
[55:59] fulfillment of Shadows and types and
[56:01] there's only going to be one thing that
[56:03] remains so he says the heaven is my
[56:05] Throne Earth is my foot stol but where
[56:07] is my
[56:08] house and in Hebrews it says when he
[56:10] cometh into this world he says sacrifice
[56:12] and offering thou wouldest not but a
[56:14] body hast thou prepared me we're looking
[56:16] at how that now God prepared himself a
[56:20] body in the form of the Lord Jesus
[56:22] Christ and the glory of the Lord would
[56:25] be declared in a pillar in a cloud and
[56:27] then it would be expressed through
[56:28] through through certain ways in the
[56:30] temple in the Tabernacle but now now in
[56:33] Christ all the fullness of God dwells in
[56:36] Christ and this is the place of his
[56:39] rest he didn't find rest in the
[56:42] Tabernacle necessarily he didn't find in
[56:43] the temple it was foreshadowed but now
[56:46] this is whom I am pleased to dwell in
[56:49] for the Bible says for in him dwelleth
[56:51] the fullness of the godhead
[56:53] bodily this is Jesus Christ the house of
[56:57] God
[56:59] am the temple of God was Jesus
[57:03] Christen even then we could say there
[57:06] was no more Shadow
[57:08] right and what what what's expressed by
[57:10] that there's no more Shadow there was no
[57:12] longer a need for
[57:14] circumcision Paul is wrestling with
[57:16] these ideas of trying to pull people
[57:17] back into Shadows pull people back into
[57:20] shadows and Paul's defense was that was
[57:23] true that was legit
[57:25] straight up all right there was nothing
[57:28] wrong with that but that was
[57:32] speaking of this and if you have this
[57:36] why would you want to go back to that if
[57:39] you can have the real
[57:41] deal this testify to the real deal I
[57:44] said no well I mean you're just you're
[57:47] just like looking at a picture you can
[57:49] have the real thing you're trying to
[57:52] imagine a warm fire by looking at that
[57:54] painted fire this is the real thing it
[57:56] was a way of saying you're not wrong in
[57:58] what you believe you're not wrong in
[57:59] what you did but th that ceremony those
[58:02] figures all those things were just
[58:04] pointing and so Christ was the temple he
[58:08] was a
[58:10] sacrifice I've gone I thought I was
[58:12] going to be finished like 30 minutes ago
[58:14] so I started vamping a little bit
[58:17] but I I need like the head heads up
[58:20] whenever the food's done I'm just
[58:21] waiting for like the 40 door Dash trucks
[58:24] to pull up
[58:25] and bring us all of our fries
[58:28] chicken or whatever it is we're
[58:32] eating
[58:36] Hallelujah now this is a hard turn
[58:40] here but now the house of God and now
[58:43] the temple refers to his church right
[58:46] which is the body of
[58:48] Christ 1 Corinthians 6:19 what know you
[58:51] not that your body is the Temple of the
[58:54] Holy Ghost which is in you which you
[58:56] have of God and you not your
[58:58] own now where is the temple where's the
[59:02] throne as we mentioned before where is
[59:04] the Tabernacle in you why would there be
[59:07] a temple
[59:09] there for you to go to to worship God
[59:12] when God is in
[59:14] you why would you need a temple and a
[59:16] tabernacle to perform service and a
[59:18] priesthood Minister service when the
[59:20] sacrifice himself is there the lamb and
[59:23] his bride when we have the Fulfillment
[59:25] of all things and that perfect Eternal
[59:27] Kingdom why would you need the types why
[59:30] would you need the
[59:31] Shadows it's only going to be substance
[59:34] there
[59:35] Amen brother B says Man was created for
[59:38] God man was to be the temple of God the
[59:43] place of God's rest was man the temple
[59:47] the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit
[59:49] was man the temple you are the Temple of
[59:52] the Holy
[59:53] Ghost no more
[59:56] Shadows when you think of that no more
[59:58] Shadows why is there not going to be a
[1:00:00] temple because the temple what it
[1:00:02] represented is in you in Christ God
[1:00:05] tabernacled in the lamb God tabernacled
[1:00:08] in his bride God has
[1:00:10] become this eternal uh
[1:00:14] people and God is resident in man it's
[1:00:17] not God dwelling with man in a temple
[1:00:19] not God dwelling with Man Behind Badger
[1:00:21] skins not God dwelling with man behind
[1:00:23] the the Veil in a temple or Tabernacle
[1:00:26] it's God now embodied made real in the
[1:00:29] lamb in The Bride for all eternity and
[1:00:32] the glory of the Lord through
[1:00:34] you
[1:00:38] amen and so I'll close with
[1:00:42] this the Bible says in Numbers chapter
[1:00:45] 14: 21 I have several scriptures I could
[1:00:47] use here I'm just going to use this
[1:00:50] one are we smelling anything
[1:00:53] yet already starting to set stuff up my
[1:00:55] stomach's starting to growl my lisp is
[1:00:58] getting really bad say but as I but as
[1:01:01] truly as I live this is God speaking now
[1:01:05] Hallelujah but as truly as I live all
[1:01:08] the Earth shall be filled with the glory
[1:01:11] of the
[1:01:12] Lord I love how he says it as truly as I
[1:01:16] live God swears an oath and he swears by
[1:01:21] himself cuz he could not swear by any
[1:01:23] greater than the Earth will be filled
[1:01:26] with his glory and he doesn't just say
[1:01:29] one part of the earth he doesn't just
[1:01:30] say Arizona Believers Church it doesn't
[1:01:32] say brandom Tabernacle it doesn't say
[1:01:35] the Holy Temple the bright age seven
[1:01:37] steps to the king's chamber.com
[1:01:39] Fellowship I don't he says all the Earth
[1:01:42] will be
[1:01:43] filled oh I swear as I live all the
[1:01:48] Earth shall be filled with the glory of
[1:01:50] the Lord amen he's saying I swear an
[1:01:53] oath though the glory of the Lord may
[1:01:55] have come down and be seen in the temple
[1:01:58] and the glory of the Lord came down upon
[1:02:00] a Mountaintop and the glory of the Lord
[1:02:02] came down in the Tabernacle and the
[1:02:03] glory of the Lord was seen Upon Jesus
[1:02:05] Christ he says all the Earth all the
[1:02:08] Earth shall be filled with the glory of
[1:02:10] the Lord now real quick just think what
[1:02:12] God does to the Earth God does to his
[1:02:15] people if there's a pattern of
[1:02:17] redemption for the Earth then there's a
[1:02:19] pattern of redemption for me and he says
[1:02:22] that all the Earth shall be filled f
[1:02:25] with the glory of the Lord
[1:02:27] hallelujah let this Earth be
[1:02:32] filled we'll pick up on that
[1:02:34] later musicians if you'd
[1:02:37] come in Revelations
[1:02:39] 21:4 there's a few more things that
[1:02:42] aren't going to be there
[1:02:44] anymore God shall wipe away all tears
[1:02:46] from their eyes and there shall be no
[1:02:49] more death there shall be no more sorrow
[1:02:53] there shall be no more C crying neither
[1:02:55] shall there be any more pain Hallelujah
[1:03:00] there will be no more death there will
[1:03:02] be no more sorrow there will be no more
[1:03:05] crying and there will be no more pain
[1:03:08] for the former things are passed
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:13] away
[1:03:15] Hallelujah verse one said the former
[1:03:18] Heaven and Earth pass
[1:03:20] away and we know that means it's
[1:03:22] transformed into an image that it
[1:03:25] foreshadowed it was embodied in it it
[1:03:28] had something contained in it it's
[1:03:30] completely renovated it's redeemed it
[1:03:31] comes back and it exist in its original
[1:03:34] how God originally wanted it to be and
[1:03:37] it says Heaven and Earth shall pass
[1:03:42] away
[1:03:44] the former Heaven and Earth pass
[1:03:49] away but now it says the former things
[1:03:51] are passed away but it's a different
[1:03:53] phrase that's used it's a stronger
[1:03:56] phrase phrase is used in verse one to
[1:03:59] speak of something even the coming or
[1:04:01] the arrival of something the way that
[1:04:03] it's structured to say that you know
[1:04:05] this Earth You you thought you always
[1:04:07] knew now here's the real
[1:04:09] me the heaven you thought you always
[1:04:11] knew now that here's the real heaven and
[1:04:13] it was always there we just didn't see
[1:04:15] it it just had to go through a process
[1:04:17] to get there just like you when you were
[1:04:19] born down inside of you was a germ of
[1:04:20] God and we never really see that until
[1:04:22] you're born again and we begin to learn
[1:04:24] the real you the one that God thought of
[1:04:25] in the beginning and so pass away of the
[1:04:28] Heaven and Earth is to be changed and
[1:04:31] changed from one state to another but
[1:04:33] when it said the former things are
[1:04:34] passed away about these things it uses a
[1:04:37] much stronger phrase because it doesn't
[1:04:39] want you to think that pain will exist
[1:04:41] in another
[1:04:42] form right doesn't want you to think
[1:04:44] that sorrow will exist in another form
[1:04:47] or that death will exist in other form
[1:04:49] it says no it is going to be gone and it
[1:04:53] means to depart to go away death
[1:04:56] mourning sorrow go away all together it
[1:05:00] will not be in any shape or form you
[1:05:03] know it's no more Shadows no more types
[1:05:06] I think it's beautiful to think that God
[1:05:08] uses pain without pain no gain right and
[1:05:11] we God uses suffering and he uses sorrow
[1:05:13] and he uses all these things uh to work
[1:05:15] on our character and to teach us things
[1:05:17] and we can see that death sorrow crying
[1:05:20] and pain all have some use and utility
[1:05:23] or some expression in Earth but it won't
[1:05:25] be worth it there it won't be used there
[1:05:28] it won't be needed there it would just
[1:05:30] be gibberish it wouldn't make sense it
[1:05:32] would have no basis it would be Insanity
[1:05:35] so it's gone
[1:05:37] forever no more
[1:05:40] Shadows no shadow of death no shadow of
[1:05:44] Sorrow no shadow of crying no shadow of
[1:05:49] pain Shadows are powerful
[1:05:53] things no doubt that maybe some of you
[1:05:55] sitting here today felt your phone
[1:05:57] vibrate and you don't even have your
[1:05:59] phone on
[1:06:00] you it's a
[1:06:03] shadow there's people that have limbs
[1:06:06] amputated they'll have their their foot
[1:06:08] cut off and they'll have their foot will
[1:06:09] itch and their toes will itch you'll be
[1:06:12] like uh you ain't got no toes like I
[1:06:15] feel it though it's like Phantom and
[1:06:18] shadows you're not going to have any of
[1:06:20] that
[1:06:20] there aren't you tired of the Shadows
[1:06:24] I amen but there's times when Shadows
[1:06:27] come back
[1:06:28] around you know what causes Shadows to
[1:06:30] go away light and that's what I want
[1:06:33] right now in my life is light I want to
[1:06:36] chase away shadows and complexes and
[1:06:38] scars I want to chase away pain I want
[1:06:40] it to chase away sorrow I want it to
[1:06:42] ultimately chase away death do you want
[1:06:44] it to happen for you you want the light
[1:06:47] to shine oh sometimes we dance and we
[1:06:51] shout and we sing and we whistle because
[1:06:53] we're walking through the graveyard at
[1:06:55] night I don't want to do that I don't
[1:06:57] want the shadow I don't want to worship
[1:06:59] the figure I want the body which is
[1:07:03] Christ why would you go back to the
[1:07:05] shadow when the reality is
[1:07:08] now brother brandham says in
[1:07:15] Shalom God who made the
[1:07:17] promise in the last
[1:07:20] days these things would happen that we
[1:07:22] see happen
[1:07:24] I love this
[1:07:26] message the the vindications of it the
[1:07:28] historical reality of it all those
[1:07:30] things let's not lose sight of it don't
[1:07:33] get distance from The Voice I tell you
[1:07:35] one sure way for you to all of a sudden
[1:07:36] get that pay of doubt and fear is to
[1:07:40] cause the voice of God to become
[1:07:42] unfamiliar to you and the the voice of
[1:07:45] the doubter or the skeptic or the world
[1:07:47] to become more familiar and then they'll
[1:07:49] say something that be has more of a
[1:07:50] familiarity to it and then when you
[1:07:52] listen to the voice it's lost its
[1:07:53] familiarity right don't get away from
[1:07:55] this message you better be listening to
[1:07:57] it studying it amen obeying it am he
[1:08:01] said if he promised a son and the sun
[1:08:04] came if he promised all these things
[1:08:07] that we see through the scripture and it
[1:08:08] did let's get into the rhythm of
[1:08:11] it I he's saying some heavy things here
[1:08:14] in Shalom if he promised the Son and the
[1:08:16] sun came let's get into the rhythm of it
[1:08:20] let's get in the rhythm of redemption
[1:08:22] get into the rhythm of the word promised
[1:08:24] in the last days these things would take
[1:08:25] place and we see it he promised that he
[1:08:28] would send Jesus
[1:08:31] Hallelujah get in the rhythm of
[1:08:34] it it is the rising of the sun there is
[1:08:37] a man here who could turn on the light
[1:08:40] it's not in the Tabernacle it's not in
[1:08:42] the temple it's Christ the word now made
[1:08:45] flesh in you he says hallelujah there
[1:08:48] will be a

[1:08:59] more for the lamb is the light of the
[1:09:01] city that we're going to recognize what
[1:09:04] he's saying there will be a millennium

[1:09:09] City without the Sun for the lamb will
[1:09:10] be the light thereof the dawning of a
