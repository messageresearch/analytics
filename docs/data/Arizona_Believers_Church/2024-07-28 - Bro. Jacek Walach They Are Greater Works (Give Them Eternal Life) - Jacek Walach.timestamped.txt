[0:00] I would like to say at the beginning
[0:02] that uh Christians they are more than
[0:05] they think you can be lost in your way
[0:09] of thinking unless the word of God will
[0:12] come and capture your mind completely
[0:14] you know
[0:16] um and I will say also at the beginning
[0:18] you know just I trust you'll understand
[0:20] my English I never went to school and
[0:23] learned English never in my life but
[0:25] when I was young I asked the Lord for
[0:27] help and I promis him when he will help
[0:30] me to uh understand English and speak
[0:33] English I will serve him the best
[0:35] possible way also by this language so if
[0:38] something is not there perfect I if I
[0:40] will not use academic uh English this
[0:43] morning please understand but I'm sure
[0:45] I'm 100% sure the holy spirit will give
[0:48] you uh meaning understanding between the
[0:51] lines even the great prophet like
[0:53] brother branam when he was preaching the
[0:55] seventh seal he was not depending on the
[0:57] on his vocabulary and the abilities of
[1:01] Express himself he said Lord just these
[1:04] cut words or sentences you can put
[1:07] together as a picture in the hearts of
[1:09] the Believers in fact we all believe
[1:11] that God was on the scene when he was
[1:13] preaching the seventh seal he was trying
[1:16] to hide himself before the unbelievers
[1:18] and show himself before the Believers
[1:21] that's the reason he used the vessel as
[1:23] he wanted to have and Jesus Christ the
[1:25] same yesterday to and forever uh we are
[1:28] very blessed people we are are more than
[1:30] we think you know in the school they
[1:32] taught us that we are Homo sapiens am I
[1:35] right probably they teach the same in
[1:37] Arizona as they taught us in Poland but
[1:40] I I I'm here to tell you that you are
[1:42] more than you think you are more than
[1:44] Homo sapiens when you look on the street
[1:47] on um our cities wherever we are we can
[1:50] see some people they are
[1:53] Homo uh they are Homo definitely but you
[1:56] know uh not very many are sapiens
[2:00] uh when you look precisely around you
[2:03] can just realize that some of the people
[2:05] they are not acting even as a
[2:07] homo but you know as a Christians we
[2:10] have a promises we had a great precious
[2:12] promises and by these promises we became
[2:15] a partakers of the new nature you are a
[2:18] new creation in Christ Jesus so that's
[2:21] the reason I believe we are more than
[2:23] Homo sapiens because what we can see we
[2:26] are humans yes am I I I'm right you you
[2:30] right if you think like this but if you
[2:32] allow the Holy Spirit come inside of you
[2:34] you are more than Homo sapiens God is
[2:36] using your skin he is putting on your
[2:40] jacket of your Humanity but God is
[2:42] living inside God is living inside with
[2:45] a new nature with a new Thoughts with a
[2:48] new spirit with a new creation with a
[2:50] new language new vocabulary you are
[2:53] becoming a voice for the final
[2:55] generation so you are more than you
[2:57] think and brother Bram here taught us
[3:00] you know exactly what he meant because
[3:03] you heard that hundred of times he
[3:05] referred to Mark
[3:07] 11:22 he said whatever things you say
[3:10] and don't doubt in your heart it will
[3:13] come to pass you can have what you have
[3:16] said because when God and the man is in
[3:19] unity God is omnipotent am I right God
[3:22] is omnipotent but if he is living inside
[3:25] of you if he has chosen you if he has
[3:28] revealing himself to you you are also
[3:30] omnipotent that's that's that's plainly
[3:33] written in the Bible maybe not the way
[3:35] as every member of every denomination or
[3:38] or religion uh religious club uh thing
[3:42] like that but Jesus he said whatever you
[3:44] will ask believing in your heart you
[3:47] will receive it whatever it means a man
[3:51] filled with the Holy Spirit subject to
[3:53] God and under supervision of the holy
[3:55] spirit is omnipotent it means whatever
[3:58] two or three Gather in his name wherever
[4:01] two omnipotents are coming or three
[4:04] omnipotents or maybe 100 or more than
[4:07] 100 if they are coming in the name of
[4:09] Lord Jesus Christ coming together all
[4:11] things are possible God is omnipotent
[4:14] man is omnipotent subject to the Holy
[4:16] Spirit when the two or three got in his
[4:19] name the omnipotence of God is coming
[4:22] down as he promised that I I am pretty
[4:25] sure you believe it when we are inviting
[4:27] not the Creed this or the but when we
[4:30] are inviting the word of God Among Us my
[4:34] friend the omnipotence of the holy
[4:36] spirit is here right now I don't know
[4:39] your needs I don't know uh what you are
[4:41] looking for your expectation but
[4:44] trusting that you are expecting
[4:45] something from God if we are coming to
[4:48] the position that we don't uh expect
[4:52] anything uh we are losing many things we
[4:55] can be a Christian we can be a Bible
[4:56] believing Christians but if we are not
[4:58] under expect ation any time when we are
[5:01] coming together in the name of Lord
[5:03] Jesus Christ we are missing something
[5:06] God is here and he's a god rich in Mercy
[5:09] yes he he's able to uh to bless you
[5:12] abundantly uh above the uh your
[5:14] expectation and the things you can ask
[5:16] according to the power that is working
[5:19] already in you that's what the Paul said
[5:22] in the in the book of Ephesians that
[5:24] there is a power of God working already
[5:27] in you whatever you ask looking up
[5:29] looking uh even uh to the direction of
[5:31] the Heavenly places you must understand
[5:34] the the answer will come from inside of
[5:36] you because he will respond you
[5:40] according to the power that works
[5:42] already in you what is laying in you
[5:45] then the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:48] that is not in heaven but is on the
[5:50] earth amen God opened my eyes many many
[5:53] years ago I was raised I would say uh my
[5:56] parents they told me uh come to church
[5:59] any time time I was raised as a Lutheran
[6:01] but I I when I was 14 I said no I became
[6:05] really a Protestant I said I will no not
[6:08] come to church anymore because I see the
[6:10] people that are living a double life and
[6:13] you know I I I I was only partitional
[6:15] right because that's what my saw uh my
[6:18] my eyes saw it was right but it didn't
[6:22] um justify me in those days being a
[6:25] teenager to Cease the coming and listen
[6:28] the word of God even on that portion
[6:30] that I had probably I would stay there I
[6:33] would just know more maybe it would be
[6:35] on a Crums from the table of the Lord
[6:37] but I would just grow better but since I
[6:40] became a real Protestant and I became a
[6:43] pro Protestant against this system you
[6:46] know I landed completely in the world
[6:48] and I didn't have a Christian education
[6:50] and so forth I was uh telling the people
[6:53] uh those things are not existing you
[6:55] know and so forth I was a really really
[6:57] tough guy but uh when I I was 18 Lord
[7:00] was very gracious to me when I was 18 he
[7:03] opened my eyes uh it was a miracle it
[7:07] was an absolutely Miracle because I'm
[7:09] coming from the little town 20,000
[7:11] people and when I became a Christian you
[7:13] know everyone was talking about my
[7:15] conversion and the people they were
[7:17] split some of them they said it's
[7:19] possible some of them they said no the
[7:21] it's impossible you know but whatever
[7:23] they say whatever was their opinion I'm
[7:26] still on this blessed path yes I never
[7:29] change it God revealed to me this
[7:31] message beautiful message of Malachi 4
[7:34] revelation of the son of man and I'm so
[7:36] blessed you know that I could just
[7:38] believe it I brought my wife uh I met
[7:41] her in the kindergarten she was five I
[7:44] was five but uh we've been on the
[7:45] different pages she was a very nice
[7:48] young lady very very uh uh faithful
[7:51] beautiful and so forth I was a
[7:53] troublemaker but the Lord just opened my
[7:56] eyes and then when he opened my eyes I
[7:58] brought my wife wife it is a long story
[8:01] but I brought my wife to the Lord Jesus
[8:02] Christ uh and I married her and we are
[8:05] very very blessed and our children are
[8:07] blessed serving the lord and the Lord is
[8:09] very gracious so I encourage you I don't
[8:13] know your your your mind I don't know
[8:15] your attitude but this message there's
[8:17] nothing on the face of the Earth you can
[8:19] compare with this message I was in the
[8:21] 70 countries I met many people I met
[8:24] there people that believe and met people
[8:26] that are really against it you know I
[8:28] always say the same you know I am the
[8:30] fruit my marriage is the fruit my family
[8:33] is the fruit of the pure word of God I I
[8:36] I took a stand for this word for all
[8:38] these years and I'm going to do it for
[8:40] the rest of my life and I encourage you
[8:43] my friend we have to recognize who we
[8:46] are and don't look back don't look back
[8:49] even if you read the story or or or or
[8:52] the life story of the Great Men of God I
[8:55] appreciate all of them if they preach
[8:58] the truth in their age they were
[9:00] tremendous great people but I would like
[9:03] to say something greater than this that
[9:06] was in the past God stored for you and
[9:09] me and don't look back look on the hour
[9:12] look on the on the moment of the history
[9:15] we are living right now and please
[9:17] recognize who you
[9:18] are Lord is so gracious to Us Praise the
[9:22] Lord
[9:23] hallelujah and uh even when I'm talk to
[9:25] you about uh we have to recognize our
[9:28] position we have to recognize we are
[9:30] super church we are uh by the grace of
[9:32] God of course super race we we are
[9:35] omnipotent and our father is omnipotent
[9:38] some people they don't believe it but
[9:40] this is very simple if there is a fox if
[9:43] the fox will bring forth what kind of
[9:45] spe will bring forth foolx will bring
[9:47] forth
[9:49] folks elephant will bring forth elephant
[9:52] definitely horse horse cat cat human
[9:56] will BR bring forth human God will bring
[9:59] forth amateur Gods that's what he
[10:02] promised you know we can believe it or
[10:04] not but if you will believe it it will
[10:07] just put you on the on the higher level
[10:09] in the spiritual understanding but this
[10:12] is not all just to say around I I I know
[10:15] who I am I'm the message is not enough
[10:18] if you'll be in the message then still
[10:20] the message must be in you still you
[10:22] have a have to have a testimony personal
[10:25] testimony like Jesus he said in the St
[10:28] John 14 20 at this day yes you shall
[10:32] recognize as I was in the father father
[10:34] in me I am in you you are in me so it's
[10:36] not enough to say I'm in the message
[10:39] message must be in you amen what's the
[10:41] purpose why why we have to recognize who
[10:44] we are it's just to be puffed up just to
[10:47] think that we are better than the other
[10:49] churches or something like this forget
[10:51] it if God shows you who you are there's
[10:54] always a purpose
[10:57] behind there is a job to do this is the
[11:00] reason that's what I I I would like to
[11:02] share with you something that is on my
[11:04] heart they are Greater Works give them
[11:07] eternal life we want to deal with this
[11:10] if you if you know who you are there is
[11:12] a job to do yes to you have to
[11:16] understand exactly why why I am the way
[11:20] I
[11:20] am you know uh in the story that we read
[11:24] from the book of Esther chapter 7 you
[11:26] have to spe speed up I know that uh the
[11:29] customs in the States you know that uh
[11:31] they told me when I was some years ago I
[11:33] think was a North Carolina certain uh
[11:36] nice
[11:37] evangelist great brother and faithful
[11:40] worker on the on the God's Vineyard he
[11:42] told me you know when you are traveling
[11:45] in the United States uh evangelist uh
[11:48] it's it's it's a specific time given to
[11:50] the Evangelist is not more than one hour
[11:54] and the pastors they have uh 1 hour 15
[11:57] minutes if this is in the midweek
[11:59] meeting and maybe uh maximum 1 hour and
[12:01] 30 minutes on Sunday so I'm trying I'm
[12:04] trying to do the best I don't want to
[12:06] offend you uh also I don't want to
[12:09] offend the holy spirit so we we we we
[12:11] talk a little with the pastor be before
[12:13] the meeting I'm trying to uh stay stick
[12:16] to the golden middle that's what the
[12:18] Brad BR he told us in 1965 I stay with
[12:21] the golden middle not too short not too
[12:25] uh not too long I'm watching you
[12:27] constantly as I'm watching go a holy
[12:29] spirit if I will see you you you're
[12:32] falling asleep or just not not everyone
[12:34] but maybe majority or or do that you are
[12:37] tired you know sometimes this is this is
[12:40] a problem of evangelists that are so in
[12:42] fire you know they are never tired you
[12:44] know but the congregation is tired so
[12:46] I'm not trying uh to to follow the idea
[12:49] I'm watching you if you'll be very tired
[12:52] and you I will see on your face that you
[12:54] are not pulling you know I will slow
[12:56] down I will slow down and finish but
[12:59] bear with me please you know this is a
[13:01] big thing big subject big thought not
[13:03] because of me but something I I would
[13:06] like to show you something to encourage
[13:08] you that you will realize there was a
[13:10] never hour like this hour there was a
[13:13] never possibilities like we have there
[13:16] are potentials laying in you that you
[13:18] never imagine Enoch he couldn't imagine
[13:21] Paul he couldn't imagine my friends even
[13:24] brother branam in his time he was
[13:26] prophesying predict many things you know
[13:29] but the the the on the uh on the clock
[13:32] God's clock let's say the clock of etern
[13:36] Eternity oh no the clock of humanity or
[13:39] the clock of the church he the further
[13:41] he saw it was a
[13:43] 1977 he said beyond this is a Darkness I
[13:47] cannot believe the Christians can live
[13:50] here this is the the the the the
[13:52] firstest point I can see because he was
[13:55] a messenger to the seven Church age but
[13:59] we are under influence of the mighty one
[14:01] the mighty Angel he's the messenger to
[14:04] his wife to the bride that's the reason
[14:06] we are living in a Bright's Age We
[14:09] supposed to always realize that we we
[14:12] are uh connected and brought to the
[14:14] Eternal age Bright's age the Bright's
[14:17] coming of Christ so the Book of Esther
[14:21] chapter 7 we read you know uh you know
[14:23] there was a great woman but we have to
[14:26] just see a little background of this
[14:28] woman how she was elevated on a certain
[14:31] position how she took a stand but it was
[14:33] not from uh uh uh from day to day she
[14:37] was in the process of preparation she
[14:40] was the process she was chosen she was
[14:43] elected not by herself she found the
[14:47] grace in the side of the king but she
[14:49] was prepared by the two great uh uh
[14:52] persons one was morai he was a pastor he
[14:56] was giving advices for Esther what to do
[14:59] do what not to do how to act in a wise
[15:01] way and um and also uh hegi hegi was a
[15:07] type of the messenger that was taken up
[15:09] to the mind of King and he knew exactly
[15:11] what the king lik it and what he didn't
[15:14] like so these two persons shape her but
[15:18] first of all she was uh in the Covenant
[15:21] she was a Jew she was she was without
[15:24] the mother without the father that is
[15:26] showing also the hour we are living
[15:28] right now she was a orphan she was not
[15:31] Guided by the father or mother not by
[15:34] the fleshly arm of the fleshly wisdom
[15:37] but she she was prepared uh in a special
[15:41] way for the hour that she didn't realize
[15:44] that was on the scene we know how the
[15:46] everything looked in the book of uh uh
[15:50] Esther that uh it was a king and there
[15:52] was vashy the the queen and everything
[15:56] looked nice until a certain day when the
[15:59] king wanted to present the queen and the
[16:02] queen she was ashame of him exactly like
[16:05] today the churches Beautiful People
[16:08] beautiful churches as beautiful as never
[16:10] before they're ashamed of the king who
[16:13] is the
[16:14] word they're not ashamed of the singing
[16:17] uh worshiping uh lifting up hands and uh
[16:21] the creas and having a big Bible and
[16:23] everything but I ashame of the word and
[16:26] the beginning was the word and the word
[16:28] was with God the Word was God right and
[16:31] our King our King is the word of God yes
[16:34] right so we know there was a big uproar
[16:38] in the kingdom and finally a seven
[16:41] Elders uh you know Wise Men was called
[16:45] To Take decision what to do with vashi
[16:47] and the one was telling like this the
[16:49] other was telling like that but there
[16:51] seven one mukan which means the the
[16:55] noble one the noble one he said no no no
[16:58] no no the problem is not only the
[17:00] problem of uh of the king and the queen
[17:03] but this is a problem of the Kingdom
[17:05] yeah because this woman she was ashamed
[17:09] uh of the king the the the husband and
[17:12] having a um you know another Revival
[17:16] another Feast you know uh along with the
[17:20] uh with the Feast of the king and she
[17:22] didn't want to come to the to the party
[17:25] of the of the king but you know it was
[17:27] like a too much feminis yeah she she was
[17:30] only surrounded by other ladies and so
[17:33] forth but the mukan the noble one he
[17:36] said no this is a serious case because
[17:40] when we will accept it All the Troubles
[17:42] will come to the families so you can see
[17:46] how the what's going on with the king
[17:48] and the attitud of the king and the
[17:50] attitude of the church you know how it
[17:52] is reflected finally in the
[17:55] families but mukan means the noble one
[17:58] no wonder the brother branam when he was
[18:00] uh uh being in Arizona and thinking all
[18:04] his life having a certain questions in
[18:06] his heart one day when he met the
[18:08] constellation of the Seven Angels right
[18:10] here in this land my friend when he was
[18:12] taken up to the constellation of seven
[18:14] angels he met the seven one he said I
[18:17] was thinking all my life I have a
[18:20] question but I I felt a special
[18:22] connection with a seven one and he said
[18:25] was a noble one in this constellation
[18:29] it was a mukan of the hour my friend he
[18:31] received a revelation something that
[18:34] just went around the world even they
[18:36] reaching Poland which is a Catholic
[18:38] country 97% of population of my country
[18:42] almost 40 millions of people they are
[18:44] Catholics we are very very few but this
[18:47] message went and sweep around the earth
[18:50] very quickly without a headquarter
[18:53] without the efforts of the man he was
[18:55] the Holy Spirit and still does the great
[18:57] work my friend yes so when the mukan the
[19:01] noble one he gave the Revelation to the
[19:04] king and this Revelation came to the to
[19:07] the elders and he was coming to the
[19:09] every man of the Kingdom beautiful time
[19:12] of the hour we are living right now
[19:15] praise the Lord and finally we know
[19:17] there was a man his name was a Hamman he
[19:20] was a very very evil person and we know
[19:23] that hamon he was a center of the hatred
[19:28] towards uh God's people in that time and
[19:31] we know that Hamman uh it was a problem
[19:34] that the King Saul didn't solve in his
[19:37] time and he uh he was a very religious
[19:40] person but didn't have a determin what
[19:42] to do what not to do and he didn't
[19:45] realize that you have to kill sin you
[19:48] have to uh really deal with the wrong
[19:51] seat in your kingdom in your kingdom in
[19:54] the church in your kingdom in your home
[19:56] in your kingdom in your personal Kingdom
[19:59] because you are the kingdom of God on
[20:01] the Earth but he was a compromiser he
[20:04] was a big he was a very intellectual he
[20:06] he was a fair in the eyes of the people
[20:09] great king great Soldier Mighty General
[20:12] but he made a mistake by sparing a life
[20:15] on the wrong King so that's how the the
[20:19] wrong seed was transported from the age
[20:21] to age from the age to age until the
[20:24] kingdom of Ash feros came with the queen
[20:29] Esther so we see that
[20:31] now uh do you believe and I know that
[20:35] you believe but according to Genesis
[20:37] 1:26 Bible teaches us right at the
[20:40] beginning that God gave Dominion for the
[20:43] human being God Gave You Dominion
[20:46] Authority and power to rule over your
[20:49] kingdom over the animals wild animals
[20:53] peaceful animals and different occasions
[20:56] situations circumstances God gave you
[21:01] dominion and we can see the problem is
[21:04] that uh you know many spiritual people
[21:07] from the spiritual lineage you know they
[21:10] kind of struggling through all the Bible
[21:14] all the history of the humanity to catch
[21:16] really what kind of dominion God gave us
[21:20] the reason is unbelief the reason is the
[21:23] the Adam he forfeited the access to the
[21:26] Dominion to the full awareness of who he
[21:30] was who is a real man all of them they
[21:33] were just drop on the level of homo
[21:35] sapiens and very few realize that they
[21:38] are more than Homo sapiens some of them
[21:41] they fall even lower but the Dominion
[21:43] was given to the humans Dominion is
[21:46] given to the church that's what Jesus he
[21:49] said whatever you will do you will say
[21:51] on the earth in the name of the Lord
[21:54] Jesus Christ which is the manifestation
[21:56] of the word of your hour if church built
[21:59] on the rock of Revelation whatever you
[22:01] will say the Heavenly say Amen whatever
[22:05] you bind here on the earth will be bound
[22:08] in heaven whatever you lose here will be
[22:12] lost in heaven this is dominion and I
[22:15] have a question when Jesus took it away
[22:18] from the church yeah he gave it yes it
[22:22] belongs to us but the problem is then we
[22:25] see through the history that this
[22:27] Authority somehow landed in the hands of
[22:31] the wrong people that's the reason we
[22:33] can see in the Book of Esther there was
[22:36] a king with a royal Ring The Ring of
[22:39] authority and Dominion was on the finger
[22:43] on the of the king but somehow the Bible
[22:46] teaches us that the hamon rise up with
[22:49] the wrong plot to destroy God's people
[22:53] to wipe away the God's seat from the
[22:55] face of the Earth in those days be with
[22:57] they full of hate IES typing the
[23:00] Antichrist that he doesn't play there's
[23:03] a one purpose one goal to destroy the
[23:06] kingdom of God on the
[23:07] earth so when the king he gave to Hammon
[23:11] the Ring Ring of dominion and uh
[23:15] Authority we can see how this Dominion
[23:18] landed in the hands of the wrong person
[23:22] that's exactly what happened for last
[23:24] 6,000 years the Dominion that belongs to
[23:28] God's Church God's people somehow we can
[23:31] see how the people of this Earth they
[23:34] don't have a problem to subject this
[23:36] Earth subject certain land you know how
[23:39] the kings of this Earth Kings of the
[23:41] Nations how they are ruling and doing
[23:44] different things you know they are just
[23:46] uh practicing what they found in the
[23:49] Bible even if they question that it's
[23:51] coming from God they are acting really
[23:54] on the power and authority God gave to a
[23:57] man
[23:59] so for a certain time you know the the
[24:01] king uh the king's U uh uh you know
[24:06] Authority the the king's ring was in the
[24:11] hands of Hammon Hammon was a really bad
[24:14] person we know it but the spirits don't
[24:19] die Spirits don't die don't expect that
[24:22] you will meet today person with the name
[24:25] hon uh showing expressing the hatreds
[24:28] towards you no no it's hidden is a the
[24:31] name is changed the character is the
[24:34] same the evil is even deeper is more
[24:38] visible
[24:39] ruling exercising the power but should
[24:43] be in the hands of the church amen we
[24:46] supposed to recognize who we are you
[24:49] know uh so we can see how between the
[24:53] fifth and seventh chapter Book of
[24:56] Esther how God cannot
[25:00] sleep how uh King cannot sleep God
[25:05] cannot sleep he cannot sleep today until
[25:08] the word of God will be fulfilled the
[25:10] king as Pharos he couldn't sleep the
[25:13] Sleep went away from him sometimes you
[25:15] have a problem I don't know about you
[25:16] but sometimes you cannot sleep by night
[25:19] and you're a little nervous why I cannot
[25:21] sleep you know and sometimes there is a
[25:23] little mosquito is
[25:24] coming disturbs your sleep and your
[25:27] anger that happens with me sometimes I
[25:30] need some minutes to realize that God
[25:32] sent this mosquito in the middle of the
[25:34] night to take away the sleep from me
[25:37] because he want to have a fellowship in
[25:39] the quietness of the time amen so we can
[25:43] see that between the fifth and the
[25:46] seventh chapter of Book of Esther there
[25:48] was a two Banquets in the fifth chapter
[25:51] seventh chapter the queen she organized
[25:54] banquet in the both occasions the King
[25:57] was invited in the banquet of the great
[26:00] Revival H spiritual food uh natural food
[26:04] spiritual food you know and it was a
[26:06] great great feast in a both occasions
[26:09] hamon was
[26:10] there it was very important that he
[26:14] would be there I believe according to
[26:16] Psalm
[26:17] 23 that God said I I give you if the
[26:21] Lord is your Shepherd I give you certain
[26:24] uh
[26:25] reward that sometimes you go through the
[26:28] Valley of the Shadow sometimes you you
[26:30] you think where I am why I facing such a
[26:34] Temptations troubles opposition
[26:37] resistance in my life why why why why
[26:40] this is the reason God is leading you
[26:43] sometimes through a valley of
[26:45] Temptation tempting Temptations are
[26:47] coming to prove who you are even if you
[26:51] are coming through the valley of the
[26:53] shadow of death he said I will cause
[26:56] that the enemy that is fighting against
[26:58] you tempting
[27:00] you he will sit not around the table you
[27:03] will sit you will sit with the King
[27:06] Psalm 23 but your
[27:09] enemy will look at it when you are
[27:11] feasting with your
[27:13] husband with the word you are feasting
[27:16] we are feasting now because seven course
[27:18] many Seven Seals are revealed since many
[27:21] many years and God open our eyes to see
[27:25] the full Redemption not only salvation
[27:27] full Redemption
[27:28] for a
[27:30] purpose why he saved you why you
[27:32] Christian why you a Son of God why a
[27:34] daughter of God for a purpose and the
[27:37] and the reason why God sends fivefold
[27:40] Ministry the voice of God right to your
[27:42] heart under the seven messenger is to
[27:46] Quicken you to the high understanding
[27:49] and conscious what God requires from us
[27:53] look at the Esther Esther at the
[27:55] beginning she was just a uh she was she
[27:58] was without the father without the
[28:00] mother
[28:02] but she was like from another
[28:04] civilization she was like a special
[28:07] special lady but when she was born as a
[28:10] baby God didn't speak to her about the
[28:12] serious things she didn't understand the
[28:15] calling until she was chosen by King she
[28:19] was in the palace she was clothed
[28:21] properly she was announed properly
[28:23] exactly like a king
[28:25] likes amen there's a is very important
[28:29] how we
[28:30] look what what kind of a smell is around
[28:33] us you know uh Paul he said that about
[28:37] the right kind of smell I don't know
[28:39] this is the right word maybe odor or
[28:42] whatever what is
[28:44] better yeah both yeah thank you Pastor
[28:47] amen so wherever we go we supposed to
[28:50] bring impact influence being Assa of
[28:53] this Earth that's what the she was but
[28:57] she didn't know it from the beginning
[28:59] finally she was Queen as we say I'm the
[29:01] bright I'm the bright what the next I am
[29:04] the bride brother don't you know it yes
[29:06] I know why why you are the bride why you
[29:10] are the Queen of Heaven why why why she
[29:13] didn't know it until she was
[29:15] adopted until she was mature and until
[29:20] she was placed on the position and
[29:22] everyone could see who she was even in
[29:26] the ring of King was circulating
[29:29] somewhere even in the king the Power
[29:32] Authority it looks like was in their
[29:34] wrong hands still she was adopted she
[29:37] was Queen she was on the position and if
[29:40] someone would like to see the king it
[29:43] was even enough to see the queen even if
[29:46] the King was absent and the Esther was
[29:50] appearing she was revealing what was in
[29:52] the king that's what the true bride
[29:55] she's doing today even the physically
[29:58] Jesus is not on the earth and won't be
[30:01] until this Earth will be purified by
[30:03] fire he will come down he will put his
[30:05] precious feet on the Earth but now who
[30:08] can see the bride can see the bridegroom
[30:11] this is the time for the true Revival
[30:13] this is the time to really realize who
[30:16] you are brother where's the Revival we
[30:18] came to make a study great theologians
[30:21] came from United States to see the wel
[30:23] Revival where this you found it friends
[30:26] you found it friends there was a
[30:28] policeman just uh moving his uh police
[30:31] stick he said you you arrived don't look
[30:35] for the building I am the wedge Revival
[30:38] I am the priz Revival I Am The Voice yes
[30:42] I am the life I am the resurrection yes
[30:45] I am I am I am the Revival bride's
[30:50] Revival so between the fifth and the
[30:54] seventh uh chapter of Book of Esther
[30:57] between the first and the second banquet
[31:00] of the queen you know you'll say what it
[31:03] has to do with me a lot a lot honestly
[31:07] if you want to get something from the
[31:09] king from your
[31:10] husband you have to prepare
[31:14] atmosphere even the Bible teaches us
[31:16] that God dwells in the uh Praises of his
[31:20] people so it means that you cannot bring
[31:22] down the presence of the king in your
[31:25] life if you are complaining constantly
[31:31] if you are uh not happy brother are you
[31:35] happy yeah my faith feels happy not
[31:38] always my flesh feels happy not always
[31:41] my spirit is happy but I'm trying to not
[31:44] to be focused on the outer Realms I'm
[31:47] interested what God invested inside of
[31:49] me that's the reason I'm happy I'm
[31:52] really happy and I trust you are happy
[31:54] too you will say this is not so easy I
[31:56] don't say this is easy brotheri said I
[31:59] will have to neglect and I neglected
[32:02] many things in my life in 1965 because
[32:05] being a minister not always I dedicate
[32:08] children the way I should not always I
[32:11] bury the old as I should I neglect my
[32:14] duties but I'm faithful to the third
[32:18] pool which is my mind focus on the
[32:21] word so it it shows us friends that we
[32:25] the churchianity churchianity is not our
[32:29] uh our goal maybe you will neglect
[32:32] something in your life probably you have
[32:34] to if you want to have a third pool if
[32:37] you want to be focused if you want to
[32:39] come to maturity to adoption you have to
[32:41] put off some things and that people will
[32:44] blame you if you are Christian why you
[32:47] are not doing this why not doing that
[32:50] you will have to sacrifice something in
[32:53] order to get something that's what the
[32:55] Malachi for Prophet did he said this is
[32:57] the third pool of my Ministry my mind
[33:01] Focus constantly on the word amen so now
[33:06] that's what happened with Esther between
[33:09] the fifth and the seventh uh chapter
[33:13] between the first and the second Feast
[33:16] big thing is going
[33:18] on big thing is going on King cannot
[33:23] sleep his peace his rest is interrupted
[33:28] and now he said just bring me some
[33:31] Chronicles we would say which kind of
[33:33] Chronicle the first Chronicle or the
[33:35] second Chronicle of the Bible maybe the
[33:37] third one once I preach for the young
[33:39] people in our church about the third
[33:41] Chronicle of the
[33:43] Bible and there is a first second
[33:46] Chronicle this is history but what about
[33:48] your church what about your life there
[33:51] is a third Chronicle of the Bible very
[33:54] personal you can look back at five years
[33:56] ago you can look what happened in your
[33:58] life your family in the church you know
[34:00] the 10 years ago there's so many things
[34:03] it this description of the battles and
[34:06] uh lost battles and uh you had the
[34:09] victories you've been sick maybe the
[34:11] church was a little sick many people
[34:13] were sick you know everything is written
[34:15] there but the king he said bring me a a
[34:19] a Chronicle bring me the books because I
[34:21] cannot sleep and I started to read for
[34:23] him and he discovered by listening think
[34:27] the Chronicles someone was telling him
[34:30] you know happened this happened that do
[34:32] you know King there was a plot against
[34:34] you oh he didn't know it he said he was
[34:38] rewarded the person that discovered the
[34:40] plot against me no no no what is his
[34:44] name they said is written in the book
[34:48] his name is in the book his name is
[34:51] mordai bring him here I want to reward
[34:54] this man my friend be between the the
[34:57] first feast and the second Feast
[35:00] something really great essential was
[35:02] going
[35:04] on morai that was hated by someone that
[35:08] have a
[35:10] Dominion a ring of the king and a power
[35:14] authority over mordai the scenaries
[35:18] change there is a shift of the power and
[35:22] slowly morai is brought on the scene
[35:25] because he was the teacher he was the
[35:28] pastor of this chosen lady that she was
[35:31] born for certain purpose not only to say
[35:35] I am the queen but there was a work to
[35:38] do we are born friends we just we cannot
[35:43] realize completely the reason of our
[35:48] birth we know sometimes the reasons of
[35:51] our natural birth but the Bible says
[35:54] that
[35:56] the that the younger one will rule over
[36:00] the older your second birth is more
[36:05] important we know so less so small about
[36:08] who really we
[36:10] are we are coming to the place of
[36:12] satisfaction for a while we think I
[36:14] understand yes I see yes I see but I
[36:17] want to see myself see the situation my
[36:21] family the church my pastor five
[36:23] Ministry I want to see the circumstances
[36:25] around and myself the way God can see me
[36:29] that's my desire really it can change
[36:32] your life that's what happened with the
[36:34] morai because he was placed finally on
[36:37] the horse and the greatest enemy was
[36:39] leading
[36:41] him God was showing where the power is
[36:44] my friend do you know you have a you
[36:46] have a horse your horse is ready amen
[36:51] not like one brother I don't want to men
[36:53] mention his name but in one of the
[36:55] dreams you know he had a great dream and
[36:58] he came to brother branam and he said
[37:00] brother branam in that dream I had a
[37:03] horse I had a great horse which is a
[37:06] power I believe there's those horses we
[37:08] can see in the Revelation 19 he telling
[37:11] us that power is coming back Dominion is
[37:15] coming back according to Revelation 19
[37:18] on the face of the Earth will be Way
[37:20] Beyond the Kings all of them they will
[37:23] be against the King of Kings and the
[37:25] Lord of lords but this man he was a
[37:28] pastor but he saw the great horse a
[37:32] beautiful but he was looking at the
[37:34] horse and the horse is not given to you
[37:36] just to look at it you must be
[37:38] identified with the power that God
[37:41] destinated for you is your power is your
[37:44] gift your position we cannot exchange it
[37:46] we cannot buy it we cannot sell it this
[37:48] is your position but this man was
[37:50] looking on the horse too long and he
[37:53] looked back and he he started to talk
[37:55] with his wife typing that Church brother
[37:58] bam said he was started to talking and
[38:01] uh and uh and negotiate and whatever
[38:04] being focus on the church instead of on
[38:07] his position because the the horse
[38:10] represented the word personal revelation
[38:13] personal power is given to you when he
[38:16] started to talk with his wife too long
[38:18] he looked back and the horse was not
[38:22] there my friend don't do this mistake
[38:26] don't think that we can do whatever we
[38:28] want because we are we are this or that
[38:31] I have a position brother I know who I
[38:34] am me too but what we do with this yes
[38:38] this is the Urgent hour and the Esther
[38:41] she didn't know it until morai he came
[38:44] how you know you think that you your
[38:46] life will be spurred you you will be
[38:49] your head will be chopped off you you
[38:51] will be killed murdered because you are
[38:54] part of the Jewish lineage and there is
[38:57] a sentence
[38:58] already Doom over this
[39:01] race how you know don't you know that
[39:04] you are born for the moment like that
[39:07] for the time such like this what about
[39:10] us friends she was Queen already but she
[39:14] was in danger like today you know when
[39:17] when you see sometimes God help us not
[39:21] to be unaware help us to be
[39:24] aware who we are not just say I'm the
[39:28] bride Hallelujah we can sing nice songs
[39:30] about being a bride being a bride's
[39:33] coming of Christ bride's Revival and on
[39:35] and on and on we have to recognize and
[39:39] act upon the word of God yes here
[39:42] recognize and act upon the every promise
[39:45] got Quicken to you amen you will say I'm
[39:49] young man I was also many years ago
[39:51] young
[39:53] man I thought you know when I was 18
[39:56] maybe a 15
[39:58] 16 I met the people on the street they
[40:01] were giving testimonies singing
[40:04] preaching spreading uh some tracks and
[40:08] always I I sto with them because I
[40:10] wanted to discuss I want to argue I want
[40:13] to prove them they are wrong so somehow
[40:16] you know they they told me Faithfully
[40:17] some scriptures that you know you you
[40:19] you cannot forget it even if you don't
[40:21] believe it you say I don't believe it
[40:23] it's so powerful amen if you speak the
[40:25] word to any person they can say I don't
[40:27] believe it how you know what's going on
[40:30] in the
[40:31] heart but I always said when I will be
[40:34] 50 or 60 or 70 I will consider but first
[40:39] I want to live my life I want to touch
[40:41] it I want to smell it I want to just
[40:44] really use my opportunity when I will be
[40:46] an old man old grandpa maybe I will
[40:49] serve the Lord that's what I said being
[40:52] a 15 or 16 or 17 but being 18 He he came
[40:57] across of my life he didn't pay
[40:59] attention to my
[41:01] words zero value zero value my words you
[41:06] know sometimes we are meeting people
[41:07] they are so much against and they are
[41:09] mean you don't know what's going on in
[41:12] their heart be faithful pray bless these
[41:15] people even if they curse you you don't
[41:17] know what is behind Okay I have to speed
[41:20] up you know speed up really you know we
[41:22] can see how the whole situation was
[41:26] changed because the name of mordai from
[41:29] the book was revealed spoken by the king
[41:33] reward this man for many else he was not
[41:36] rewarded When you pray you say oh but
[41:39] God didn't respond
[41:40] today it it it changes nothing God will
[41:44] never fail the Bible teaches us even the
[41:47] Book of Revelation when the seventh seal
[41:49] was open in Revelation chapter 8 right
[41:52] after revelation of the seven seal that
[41:55] was mute in heaven but not on the Earth
[41:58] right after that the the the the the the
[42:01] prayer of the Saints was poured it means
[42:04] he was collected for many many years and
[42:07] situations but when the seventh seal was
[42:10] open Redemption was real yes
[42:15] effectual amen
[42:18] real my friend in the right time God
[42:21] will respond have faith so we can see
[42:24] now God is giving Authority the the ring
[42:27] that was with the King finally was with
[42:29] a hamon but for a certain period of time
[42:33] Dominion of the kings of this Earth is
[42:36] almost
[42:37] over the ring came to
[42:40] mordukai and the King he said write
[42:43] whatever you want ask whatever you want
[42:47] call the Queen She's Got the Power
[42:49] Authority whatever she will say morai
[42:52] write it seal it sign it you have a
[42:56] Dominion Power right my friend even in
[43:00] the Book of Esther we don't read that
[43:02] this ring ever came back to
[43:04] King the final station was with
[43:10] morai Dominion power and there was a
[43:13] lady with a union not having her own
[43:16] mind she had the mind of the king the
[43:18] king and the woman king and the queen
[43:20] they were one Hallelujah we don't
[43:23] worship Mary we don't worship Paul we
[43:25] don't worship uh Moses we don't worship
[43:28] angels we don't worship William Bram no
[43:30] no no no no We Worship the Lord Jesus
[43:33] Christ in his fullness in our hearts we
[43:36] recognize how the word of the hour
[43:38] Quicken to us Dominion came back to the
[43:42] human beings and this man he
[43:46] said you know when the Book of Esther
[43:50] chapter 8 from the verse four I will not
[43:52] read it just to uh spare time but you
[43:55] know uh God gave authority he he held
[44:00] out the golden scepter towards Esther
[44:02] chapter
[44:04] 8:4 so Esther arose and stood before the
[44:07] king and said if it please the king and
[44:10] if I have found favor in his sight and
[44:14] the things seem right before The King
[44:16] and I be pleasing in his eyes Let It Be
[44:20] written to reverse the letters Let It Be
[44:23] written to reverse the letters what kind
[44:27] of power she had to reverse the

[1:01:28] the house of the
[1:01:31] heite there was a really a a a cloud of
[1:01:35] Darkness that we don't realize it was
[1:01:37] there do you know there was a a uh few
[1:01:41] Brothers a Believers but there was a one
[1:01:43] of the deacons from bran Tabernacle the
[1:01:46] Brad bran he said when he was telling
[1:01:48] about the creation of the SCS he said
[1:01:50] brother can you dismiss our house
[1:01:52] meeting with prayer and this man the one
[1:01:55] of the deacons from Tabernacle he was
[1:01:57] praying Lord if this is truth if this is
[1:02:01] truth what bra said and he mentioned
[1:02:05] also about the forth scr may he will be
[1:02:08] able to find the forth Forth
[1:02:11] One it sounds uh Innocent but it was a
[1:02:14] prayer of
[1:02:16] unbelief and when the Holy
[1:02:18] Spirit heard that there was a deacon in
[1:02:21] the church questioning the testimony of
[1:02:23] the creation first time in the history
[1:02:25] of the mankind creation out of nothing
[1:02:29] three
[1:02:30] scrs God inspired a little simple lady
[1:02:34] had toite kaps he said he said when we
[1:02:38] were attending the BR Tabernacle we've
[1:02:40] been always afraid of this woman because
[1:02:42] not always you know her her uh hairstyle
[1:02:45] was perfect and other things and we just
[1:02:48] kind of avoiding the meeting with the
[1:02:50] hatti
[1:02:51] right but God has chosen very poor lady
[1:02:55] a widow
[1:02:57] not very attractive for the eye and
[1:03:00] inpired her she said quietly in a house
[1:03:03] meeting this is nothing but the truth
[1:03:06] brother branam and it brought down to
[1:03:09] the little room the dance presence of
[1:03:12] the Holy Spirit br br he call it super
[1:03:16] super anointing he said I never
[1:03:18] experienced that in my life because
[1:03:20] there is that if there is a challenge of
[1:03:22] unbelief expect the Holy Spirit Come on
[1:03:25] the scene
[1:03:26] he will use a man or woman whosoever is
[1:03:29] able just to defeat the the
[1:03:32] enemy to defeat the accusation a
[1:03:34] question and BR he said holy spirit is
[1:03:37] here had you R whatever you ask for it
[1:03:40] shall be given to you not to the half of
[1:03:43] the Kingdom not the 1 million not the
[1:03:45] two millions you know she was a really
[1:03:48] really woman Guided by the Holy Spirit I
[1:03:52] don't know if you notice that because we
[1:03:54] have a people today
[1:03:56] they believe in uh press and play or
[1:03:59] push and play
[1:04:01] and yeah there many of them but I think
[1:04:04] it's less less less some of them God
[1:04:06] opens their eyes they're coming back in
[1:04:08] line with the word because was a prophet
[1:04:11] he prayed for them and also the fold
[1:04:13] Ministry is having the same voice come
[1:04:16] back stay in line come back to the word
[1:04:19] but you know that bradan said to the
[1:04:21] sister she was part of the his own
[1:04:24] congregation she said I don't know know
[1:04:25] what to ask for she said ask for million
[1:04:28] you will have it this is a quote and she
[1:04:31] didn't say
[1:04:33] Amen ask for healing your
[1:04:36] sister the prophet suggested it's on the
[1:04:39] tape ask for the healing of this
[1:04:42] sister she said no amen she didn't say
[1:04:47] she was
[1:04:48] waiting what she said she said something
[1:04:51] that was not even on the
[1:04:54] tape God was showing the greater
[1:04:56] Ministry she was under the messenger she
[1:04:59] was under the prophet I don't believe we
[1:05:01] we doctrinally we supposed to add or
[1:05:03] take away something from the message no
[1:05:05] right I don't believe it right but you
[1:05:07] have to find it that this woman she said
[1:05:10] I ask for the Salvation on my two
[1:05:13] boys it was so serious it was so serious
[1:05:17] case even brother Bram he didn't suggest
