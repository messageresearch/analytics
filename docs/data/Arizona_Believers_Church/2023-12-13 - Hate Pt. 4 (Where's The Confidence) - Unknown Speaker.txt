TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to continue on the subject of hate and our title today is where's the confidence and in drawing using that phrase I am I'm thinking in terms of trust and faith and what we're resting in and I think there's maybe more ways that we could amplify that there's a lot in this subject if I feel at some point just to stop and not finish we can pick it up in a a later service but I'm going to take this question where's the confidence and so for a few moments I found myself kind of going back over Sunday service and I just kind of wanted to repr preach it um at least read all the scriptures again because it's amazing all the different scriptures in the Bible that deal with hate and the comparison of how that a dry morsel uh with quietness and tranquility and peace is better than you know all the sac houseful of sacrifices and hate therein so we see so much in the Bible that deals with uh the the strength that comes with peace and then how the losing of strength that comes from hatred and and so I just want to recap some things and maybe just draw some statements that we had made over the last few Services just to get us all on the same page to go forward but we've been using the definition of hate as an intense negative emotional response towards something or someone so it can be a situation it could be a thing or it could be someone and we've been using I think as a real good summary to understand really what hate represents it means to treat something or someone as your enemy and if you're treating someone as your enemy it can merely be because they have done something to make you think they want you harmed or destroyed or they want something of yours or if it's something there's a repulsion to it and you treat it as an enemy in other words you don't like it You' just be happy if it could be gone if it could be destroyed and so that phrasing of enemy is actually real strong in the scripture of hate and hatred so that's that's something I think that's real important to keep in our minds about the definition of hate is it means to treat as an enemy we've looked into how that we hate because we've left love and how that hate is an opposite to love and that in order to find hatred in our hearts we have to give room to hate um we have to give room to it and that happens when love doesn't have the preeminence and so we hate because we've left love or love isn't having preeminence and then once we start hating we lose our peace we just find ourselves sacrificing it we lay it down we lose it and so there's a losing of Peace whenever we hate a and those have been two themes that we've wanted you to recognize of what how hate enters in and then also what we begin to lose when we do hate because hate stir up contention stir up strife and and envy there's jealousy associated with it there's there's wrangling and hostility and where there's hostility and contention and competition it leads to loss it leads to Warfare it leads to even sacrifices that you make as a result of your hatred that are not beneficial so there's a lot that we could think about in terms of the consequences of hate but Sunday we are looking at how that hate steals our strength not not only is it going to take our peace but it's going to take our energy and maybe it's because it takes our peace that it takes our energy but we find ourselves uh uh losing strength because of hatred so hatred is a LIF draining emotion talked about how that it's a toxin to our bodies and our minds our our flesh and our minds our emotions and our physical health so we're using it in terms of hate is destructive hate is a cancer it's something that eats at you and it's atic poison brother B called it the poison acids and those are things that erode and corrode our mental health it corrodes and erodes our physical health so those are things we're wanting to think about in terms of the nature of hatred so we've looked at how it begins hatred and its origin and we've traced hatred of the world back to Satan evident in can and so if we have that emotion we know where it comes from so we've looked at its origin uh and we've looked at its nature and tonight we kind of kind of looking at how it starts and uh where I think we've looked at losing love and and those things as talking about how it starts but tonight I want to look a bit at how it starts and we' talked about how that we want to address how to overcome it I think those things are in here in each one of these Services already and we're using this statement where's the confidence where's the confidence and when you hopefully you could catch this tonight as we said well where's the peace and that's to that's to get you to think about wow maybe hate is the reason why I don't have peace or you say well where's the love you say oh maybe that's why Hate's found place in my heart because I've left love I want I'm wanting you to probe yourself with these questions and so by asking where is the confidence you should already start thinking well what does this have to do with faith uh with hate and you realize wow there is a great association between me hating someone or something and a losing of my confidence now I want to look at James chap 5:9 and in doing this we're continuing a little bit on where's the strength we're still going to kind of explore this uh how that hate drains us of life and power is going to be evident in the scriptures so in James 5:9 and I think it's very practical this evening in terms of the things we want to share and express and a lot of times you're studying a subject and you see a lot of deep things a lot of types and a lot of things kind of coming together and you want to preach something like that you really just want to get into it and preach and just everybody get a real uh Buzz from Revelation and uh but yet tonight I think in looking at the more I studied it the more I just felt I've got to really bring this out in a way that's just very practical and I think you're going to leave tonight very happy to have been here uh even though I've been told over and over again just how heavy the first three parts were and I I don't know if everybody's just kind of leaving like I've hated coming to these services I don't know if that's what's happening but I know it's heavy because it's real but I'm I'm hoping that there's encouragement in it to be able to uncover kind of these schemes of Satan in James 5:9 he says Grudge not one against another Brethren lest ye be condemned what a statement behold the judge standeth before the door now there's a lot more in this chapter in the chapters around some of it we're going to look into tonight but I had to kind of just narrow it down because it's so easy just to get caught up in a lot of these verses around it because they pertain to it but he just says Grudge not against uh another that Grudge in the Hebrew there excuse me in the Greek it means to find fault with and not just to find fault with them but in finding fault you wish to deprive them of something so if you Grudge them there's you want to take something away from them you're you're angry at them and these are all the emotions in a grudge there's anger there's fault finding and there's some sort of harm or deficit that you want them to experience and so it's ill will that you might have to someone and it's important to recognize that in the word it's suggested that this ill will is caused by something and so when we're dealing with hate it's not that we just wake up in the morning and we say um I I hate John Robinson I hate him and your wife's like who's John Robinson like I don't know but I hate him never met him I just know there's a John Robinson out there and I hate him never cross pathed never read his tweets uh but but I don't like him and that's but that's not what this Grudge is it's there's something that's been done there's some sort of Association that's an ill will caused by something if we were to look at the kind of modern-day definition of a grudge is to maintain feelings of anger and bitterness where you have resentment towards someone for what they've done that would someone say well I got a grudge against them they would immediately understand that something has been done to cause you to resent them or to have resentment or bitterness or anger towards someone now in studying this word in the Old Testament it kind of adds to what the meaning is to me in the scripture when it says Grudge not it means to keep in mind or memory an offense so when you gr Grudge someone you're like I'm going to remember that I'm not going to forget that I'm not going to let go of that and I I may forgive but I won't forget and actually my forgiveness is going to come back and haunt you because I'm going to use it against you but it's to keep in mind or in memory an offense it means to and the meaning to retain hatred if you Grudge something you're retaining enity against it you're going to say I I'm going to hold on to that and it's going to I'm going to use it at some point because I want there to be something to be deprived it means to return the deed so when you retain anger when you retain hatred and you Grudge from a scriptural standpoint you're holding on to this negative intense negative emotion with the intent that sometime at some point when you have the opportunity you're going to return in FA the kind you're going to return in kind and return the favor if they if there's been animosity there's been something done said or done or something taken away you're going to look for your chance to return the favor to them and I'd like to use this and I know it's self-serving to the subject matter but we because we can say it's a caution against resentment it's a caution against jealousy it's a caution against grudging I maybe be as I think about it maybe it's cautioning against being the Grinch right as we preached last year on don't be a grinch uh during this time but it's a caution against hate it's a caution to not be angry and wrathful and resentful and full of bitterness and we've looked at all those scriptures about bitterness and those things so these things kind of are combined together and it's identified in a lot of ways how it starts again it just doesn't say you know don't don't hate our Grudge and it a grudge can just you can wake up in the morning grudging against John Robinson whoever he might be and if he's streaming you know the Lord had this sermon for you uh I don't know what John Robinson that I know of but it's it's identifying where it starts because this Grudge it's because of something it will caused by something or to retain hatred for something that's been done to you there's often a good explanation for a grudge not a justification but an explanation and you'll find it right here in James 5: 1-6 let's walk let's read through this and recognize when James says Grudge not one against another lest you be condemned let's look at what he has to say go too now ye rich men weep and how for your miseries that shall come upon you so glad not to be rich he says your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth eaten your gold and silver is cankered and the rest of them shall be witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire now there's a lot that James is saying here that we could expand upon and and amplify to understand just exactly what he means even in terms of analogy and and what it would mean to those who are rich and they're going to how because of their miseries and the rust of of their of their wealth he says you've heaped Treasures together for the last days and this is where kind of starts getting into what James is pointing at he says behold the higher of the labors who have reaped down your Fields so they're rich they're wealthy they've stored up and they've relied upon the labor of others uh to accumulate this wealth and to accumulate these possessions and James says something very uh uh important here which of you kept back which is of you kept back by fraud crith and so you've H withheld the wages that were due to them by fraud and by deceit you've taken advantage of the poor you've taken advantage of the labors you've taken advantage of those who don't have the same access to things as you and you've kept act by fraud and they cry out these labors that you've defrauded by deceit have cried out and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath you have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanting you have nourished your hearts as in the day of Slaughter it it's kind of expressing this idea that these rich people are faring sumptuously off the backs of these laborers and they're taking advantage of them they're using them they're manipulating they're abusing them they're they're task Masters a a and since they have a a dis there's a disparity of power they're able to take advantage of them and they get them to work the whole season and they're promising them grain they're promising them wages they're promising them payment and insurance and all sorts of benefits and when it comes time to pay out they just pay a little bit a little bit more or just a little bit not as much as they were promised and he's saying they they're doing it by fraud and notice then kind of the real kickers he says you have condemned and killed the just and he does not resist you this is what uh is this is quite a picture that's being painted a and they have condemned the just and killed the just and even the just did not resist they haven't returned in kind they didn't go and burn the rest of the barley fields that hadn't been gleaned yet and they're not responding with this deceit and defraud themselves so it's quite a picture that James paints but this is how hate begins he describes a scenario where someone may be with uh more access to things and someone with the a a desparate uh situation in life has done something to hurt or to harm or to take advantage of you and he's saying this is through trauma hatred arises through offense hatred arises through fraud when someone lies to you that that causes a resentment when you have a bad experience that's why some people you know hate pineapple on pizza because they ate it one time and got sick and from then on you know they hate pineapple on Pizza others just hate it because some Italian tweeted out how you know Blasphemous it was and but that there's a bad experience with something and you hate it you detest it you despise it you're repulsed by it so I think it's important to recognize that James is kind of giving us some background here or this is what leads to his statement Grudge not against another brother lest you be condemned it's that there's things that happen and in doing so it will cause a grudge right and I know that we're reading some pretty big stuff here that maybe none of us uh hopefully ever have to encounter but if we could just say it's an offense at the end of the day it's some sort of Deceit or fraud or taken away or taken advantage of we we all can put ourselves in a situation where we feel taken advantage of we feel lied to we feel harmed or offended and this is what gives the con the the unjust actions towards an individual is what causes a grudge in someone's heart brother Brandon makes this statement in D demonology in the Physical Realm uh we looked at how I I was using the nomenclature that hate is a cancer caners and we've seen those words in scripture and even in the message to show us brother says now a cancer what is that fellow what does he represent he's a scavenger he represents the vulture eats dead things and a cancer comes from a bruise mostly where cell's been hit and it breaks up I know there's quite a bit here in what he's saying from an observational or scientific stpoint I I I've been studying on something here recently and how they discovered another or organ in the body and it may explain how can cancers are able to spread and it's very fascinating when brother Bram says the cell it's been hit and it breaks up there's a way that this is transmitted transmitted through the body a little cell in there becomes backslid and notice this little back this little cell backslides when it's bruised now in looking at that and we're not necessarily trying to cabbage down on the scientific explanation because this isn't a scientist that's explaining it to us but it's using a language so that we could understand that something happens a a and there could be a genetic Factor that's triggered through some sort of trauma or some sort of incident or something takes place and so there's and he says there's a bruise there that creates this cancer now I want to take that analogy and show that that's what happens when we're offended it's like a bruise whether it be our ego or our pride or emotions our feelings or some sort of sensitivity gets bruised and that's what begins to break up these cells of hatred within our body and it begins to consume us I want to read this statement I was going to hold it off to the to the end but I I want us to think about this next statement in terms of what God is trying to do through the word to help you he says it begins other little germs run forth to give it give it lives lives lives in there and that's where pus comes in a sore and we know that that's what happens when certain things in the body it's evidence of the body fighting it um even an infection as the body trying to get rid of a foreign uh something foreign or something harmful he said that that's little te teeny little soldiers fighting for in for life for your life they run up there and hit that poison them demon powers that's trying to collect in there and give their lives there are a bunch of little dead soldiers and he says that give their life to save yours so the body starts to try to attack and fight that cancer a there that infection and I believe that God's wanting us what things are wanting to fight against and resist these Notions of hatred we can see how James identifies when things that are rightfully ours are kept back from us when somebody does something to harm us or to offend us that it gives rise to a grudge or feelings of resentment or bitterness it gives rise to hate and so we and I think this beares maybe a little bit more um time but we learn hatred is something that's taught hatred is something that we learn we've learned to hate by how we've seen others respond to offenses or differences we've it's it's something that we have to be taught and learned now it may be instinctual to hate but yet in order to hate something and respond to something there's some learned behavior how to utilize that hate and many times we're we we're hating because we've watched somebody else hate and we've and I guess one of the best examples that I could give that's kind of innocent is I remember one uh very very early on Elliot was running in the house and he ran into a wall or something like that he hid it pretty hard and he began to cry and just in my instinct I wanted him to kind of turn his attention away you know from the pain and kind of resolve it very quickly one of the things you do as a parent when somebody you know one of your kids just jumps off a 13 foot building and lands on the ground and starts to cry you start laughing right because you're like oh nothing's wrong because sometimes it's your it's your response that makes it worse how many times we seen a kid fall down and he looks like he's okay you're like oh my goodness are you okay and they're like maybe I shouldn't be and they start crying so I told Elliot Elliot ran into something I said and he was getting ready to cry or whatever and I said bad wall bad wall you shouldn't do that you know and was going to blame the wall and try to kind of get him to not think about his pain and he just declared war on the wall that's right and I was like whoa wait a minute we're not going to do that anymore and so there's sometimes that's taught it's learned why why do I shake my fist at the guy who cuts me off in traffic because my dad did it you turkey I'm going to run you down you turkey right and you just learn oh that's what you're supposed to do that that oh I didn't know you did that and it's kind of a learned behavior so this hatred sometimes we have it's not that it just comes up and you learn to hate somebody but you saw somebody else's response to an offense and it taught you this is what you do having a conversation with somebody the other day someone parked something on a lot that didn't belong to them and I said and and I said well I'm I'm generally a pretty laid-back guy if they would just ask for permission it wouldn't bother me if they parked it on on my lot if they just asked for permission the guy said I'd just let the air out of the tires and he started going on and on about what he did to somebody on his property and I said man I'm just going to authorize you to take care of it for me and he said I'm just going to go let the air out of their tires I was like well never mind and and he probably does that cuz he learned it from somebody else this is this is how you address these things and handle these things so hate often times and The Grudge I want you to recognize we've learned by others responses to offences or differences and that's more subtle because someone's different than you and lives a little bit differently thinks a little bit differently sometimes we we're instinctively hateful towards them because we've learned that kind of prejudice or bias from somebody else right and Paul says Grudge not against another and in saying that he's and again I hope you've seen where Paul is is saying that excuse me James is showing that this Grudge can be traced back to offensive conduct but he's saying don't do it right you you could in everything we've read we could say James said hey I know you've got a grudge against them and I would do and he's not any says don't do it and I hope you recognize those six verses we've just read as background to him saying Grudge not one against another and when he says against another kind of recognize how that there's a line being drawn whether by conduct or conclusion conduct or opinion uh offenses or differences that there's a line that's being D drawn Grudge not against another so there's there's another here there's you and there's a grudge and that draws a line and that's what hatred does is it draws a line it creates sides and where there is a grudge there's the victim and there's the offender there's the right and there's the wrong and are you able to recognize that when we talk talk about uh uh hate there's you and there's your enemy so hatred kind of draws a line and says if this is where you are if you're not if you're not for us uh you're against us and and so this it draws a line This conduct against uh whether it be difference or conduct has caused you your hatred will draw a line and say we're we're opposed we're at odds and in James chapter 3: 14 to 18 Again James is dealing with this already in this book there's a lot he's dealing with in terms of these emotions he said but if you have bitter envying and strife that envying is a precursor to hate a lot of times we hate the ones that we Envy or that we're jealous of and there Strife it's electioneering it means to court courting a a distinction partisanship it's party making creating factions and so this is this is what he's describing here where you create sides through uh bitter envy and bitter Strife to have The Strife is to create sides you right them wrong that's that's what's being created here is these sides if you have bitter envy and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth which means don't justify it as being true or justify it as being right a and I think we mentioned this before that hatred is kind of predicated upon uh there being uh one group that feels one way or you being in a particular position position and something else being in a contrary position that's kind of where hatred is it it builds off of different groups or parties in verse 15 now this wisdom of This Bitter envy and strife and justifying it he says that wisdom to justify it is right to justify it is just uh um just he says this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for where envy and and strife is is there is confusion in every evil work then we could sum that up in terms of hatred bitterness resentment envy and and strife parter making politic and factions these clicks that are created they're against and why is it created because there's differences or something's been done and you have to take sides he says but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is swn in PE peace of them that make peace so much just being expressed here that we could begin to hold on to and touch on and hopefully we can get through some of this tonight but we read already in Proverbs 10:12 that hatred stirreth up stries but love coverthe are the opposing Natures that are being opened up here in James chapter 3 there's a hatred that just keeps stirring things up it's not going to let it go it it's not going to leave it and let it go it's not going to forgive it's not going to let by G be bygones it's just going to uh uh it's just going to keep bringing it up I remember one time having a conversation with somebody and uh and and we're wanting to work through something and kind of one of their first things that they said is I don't keep score I don't keep a scoreboard I don't keep track of this uh so don't worry about it there's nothing I'm not always writing this kind of stuff down and then you get a little bit in the conversation it's like well just hold on one [Music] minute they just start going through all the things they're keeping track of and so there's a hatred that keeps that stirs it up it's never going to let it go but there is a love that coverthe not that it's not keeping track but it's just not something that's wanting to expose and drag out so these are opposing natures and I'm wanting to use and I know it's convenient but I'm W to use hate to kind of sum up a lot of these feelings that we're identifying but the Bible's saying that this kind of wisdom that's Has This Bitter envy and bitter Strife it is sensual subject to human appetites and passions uh it's animalistic calls it devilish and Earthly so it's from an evil influence it's from beneath it's part of our based instincts it's part of an instinct that every human is subject to just by being born of a woman so it's it cannot be attributed to righteous indignation cannot be attributed to Godly hate there's a hate there's a bitter envy and a jealousy because God says I'm I'm God jealous over you with The Godly jealousy but this is a different kind but then this wisdom that's spoken of here the Bible says it's gentle so it's patient it's Equitable to be gentle it's willing to yield it it seeks peace as the Bible's expounding upon it here that it's uh it is the fruits of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace it seeks peace rather than hostility it's anti-hate it it doesn't it's actually going to act opposite to what hate does hate stir up Strife whereas this love and this other mindset and this wisdom from above is looking to plate wrath looking to settle things and quiet things down it doesn't want to Stir It Up it wants to quiet things down and and so we could look at it hates the instigator but this wisdom from above is The Peacemaker and so if we could put ourselves at the table that we are reading about in Proverbs on Sunday where it's you know better to have a dry morsel better just to eat herbs right grown out of the ground with peace and Tranquility than it is to eat fat and fattened Ox out where there's hatred right cuz why hatred is going to be there at the table just looking for an opportunity to provoke look at them over there right and and poking and maybe something said and it looks like a misunderstanding and people start getting heated and there's a little bit of an argument uh the wisdom from above said oh you know what let's not worry about it I'm sorry that's my fault let's move on let's talk about this later or seeks to immediate peace uh but hates over there going they always do this don't they this is just like them this is so on brand for them didn't they do this to you last year are you going to let them get away with that it's just looking to Stir It Up and keep it going and maybe make the day entertaining for them but there's it's but peace is anti-hate because it doesn't want to see The Strife it doesn't want to see the things that come from it and the Bible is saying that the fruit of righteousness is sown in Peace by them that make peace and other words this mature fruit is first planted in Peace by those who are seeking peace amen not seeking to divide not wanting to promote Strife or to tear down or harm somebody or to shame somebody got to be very careful to guard against even the seeds of hate because the Instinct of hate is to shame belittle and degrade the Bible says in Proverbs 15: 1 and 2 a soft answer turneth away wrath but Grievous words stir up anger that's hate hate that's what a grudge will do but a soft answer turns away the Wrath where there's hatred hatred wants to promote hate hate I wants to breed more hate hate has that power to provoke and to birth hate inside of you we've seen that in the scriptures if someone's hating you it's going to try to bring hate out of you so it's saying soft answer will turn that away but Grievous words are going to stir up anger it's even showing that the words that are being spoken to you are trying to stir up angering you so the only way to diffuse it is not to respond with fire but to respond with a soft answer so it says the tongue of the wise useth knowledge or right but the mouths of fools porth out foolishness so much that could be said here even how it amplifies what's said in James chapter 3 but there's a sensual devilish nature that's going to uh fire things off it's going to respond in an attack it's going to get angry right back but saying there's a wisdom from above that is pure Peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and that's the tongue of the wise which uses knowledge correctly I think the way that we described this before when we used this scripture a couple years ago was that in this situation where there's there's some wrath there's some disagreement there's some contention it says a soft answer turns it away whereas Grievous words are just going to Stir It Up more and the tongue of the wise uses knowledge correctly it's that in it may not be instinctive but it's that ultimate response that overcomes all the fleshly responses in order to get beneath and live above it yeah in other words get beneath and live above get beneath the person who's angry because you want to get beneath because they're already Bas right they're already doing something they shouldn't do they're they're they're stirred up so instead of you kind of punching them down and punching down at them you try to get beneath them to lift them up through the soft answer by by humbling yourself to them and by getting beneath them you're living above it I hope you can catch that thought about living above something it it it's the grace and patience that we can never have too much of when there's conflict in relationships Bible saying there's a harvest of righteousness correct Behavior it's planted by those who are acting patiently and gracefully they're seeking peace and Accord they're wanting they're to wanting rest I think there's uh times when we just whether it be the way that we've been raised or the way that we've experienced certain things in lives where it's almost as if we find some sort of familiarity and contention that there's always got to be something going on there's always got to be an edge there's always got to be a difference there's always got to be fighting and we really need to watch out for that to where no I I want to have the kind of nature that's seeking rest and quietness not not I don't want to be the kind of person that I don't feel like I'm at home unless there's an argument going on and some of you might just say well it's not that's what home is there's always a fight but we want to be those that seek peace and Accord and the Bible says here as we're reading through this in James that it is wisdom from above and so it's describing here in James chter 3:1 17 the the characteristics of wisdom and what it's known by it's known by these attributes and I would like to look at it this way that Paul is excuse me I keep calling him Paul maybe his middle name is Paul James Paul he's not he's wanting us to recognize and I it's not an either or proposition I believe he's challenging us to say you could if you want respond with in a fleshly way that that's just going to be natural and instinctive that he said don't the bitter envy and strife he's said that would be expected based upon the things that can happen to you as he gets to it in chapter five defraud and deceit and killing the just and all sorts of line and things that take place see you can get bitter because of that you could Envy you could have Strife you could party make you could do all these things be saying don't do it because that's Earthly that's carnal that's of an evil influence but rather use this wisdom which is from above and the picture that it paints for me as he talks about meekness we know that meekness is power under control when you have meekness I've got power to Snuff you out but I'm not going to do it I've got power to clock you and knock you out I can break your jaw I can do this to you I can let all the air out of your tires right but I'm not going to do it because I'm Meek not because I'm weak but because I can that's meekness it describes to me self-control that is that is what's being expressed on this is the ability to regulate your emotions and it's not that you're like I'm just numb to it man you can just do whatever you want to me I don't feel it I'm not going to Envy I'm not going to be jealous you just might be dead inside right that's why you don't hate you're just dead inside and but yet we're talking about something where I feel this I'm being provoked I I see the unjustness and there's a self-control that is the opposite of hate that says instead of letting this become a raging wildfire in my emotions I'm going to regulate and I'm going to yield to a higher power and I'm going to cause it to snuff out these feelings and it says this wisdom is first pure which is clear it inspires this reverence it's pure it's free from carnality it's not Earthly it's not sensual it's not devilish it's modest it's clean now as I read through these I'm want you to recognize how this is opposite of hate because hate defiles it's dirty says it's Peaceable that's clearly the opposite of hate because it means it promotes peace it desires peace it desires agreement and it's willing to SA sacrifice personally for it as we read where David said and I and I gave what I gave back what I didn't take away what for peace so sometimes there's compromise and there's concession for the sake of Peace willing to personally sacrifice to have it it's gentle it's modest it's making a um it's something that makes a person understanding and patient not rigid not harsh not Stern not unrelenting what just won't budge and won't let it go a brother shared something in uh a minister a pastor in uh Oklahoma Missouri shared something and uh and he a brother had shared a quote just this week and it really I thought it was really good I just read it today said he preached a sermon one time called God's Judo and that Judo I guess means gentle or gentleness how the and if I get this wrong to you martial arts experts here you could just kind of clear it up later and I'll be sure to let this brother know he got it wrong but he said that Judo has its roots or emology and gentleness are being gentle and how that in Judo uh you're using your opponent's for energy and force against it you kind of go with the motions and you're you're doing something in a way where you're not getting wore out but they're exerting themselves and use use their energy against them it made me think of this gentleness to where where there's hatred and animosity that's being projected towards you you just find a way to roll with it and move in such a way where they're going to project all their energy but you're not going to let it bring take out yours it's to be modest easily intreated willing to listen not stubborn or sour means someone's a good listener and they're responsive to what they're hearing full of Mercy you're quick to forgive you act kindly it exhibits some sort of compassion uh you're willing to relieve whatever burden they're going through notice just how different of a response a soft answer turns away wrath Grudge not and this wisdom that's from above it it's there's self-control I'm not going to be provoked but I'm going to be full of Mercy not going to be provoked I'm going to be full of good fruits and so each one of these dispositions is manifest in action it produces an action it's full of good fruits without partiality in other words it's not self-righteous it's not influence by self-interest where you're going to hold back you're going to restrain it's going to give what is due it's not going to it's going to be merciful it's going to be without partiality without hypocrisy it's not self- serving without gu it seeks nothing but God's glory this is this is quite a contrast to hatred pure Peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of Mercy full of good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy I could argue that every single one of these things hate is anti- too it's not pure it's not Peaceable it's not gentle it's not easy to be in treated it's not full of Mercy not full of good fruits it's not without partiality it's not without hypocrisy I think the more you think about it the more you're going to say Amen to it maybe just in about 20 minutes when it's quiet somebody's like amen I get it now this is connecting with a lot of the things we've been expressing as do not Grudge do not hate when there's an offense do not let the offense or even the overt hate that you endure provoke you to hate the offender this is a clear admonition in the scripture don't do it it's not clean it's not pure it's not good for you it's not healthy that where there's hate projected to you don't don't give hate back where there's an offense to you don't offend back don't give evil for evil but over come evil with good this is the picture constantly painted in the scripture and James is saying Grudge not against another Brethren lest you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door now I I kind of flip this around a little bit to and I'll come back to this condemnation he says the judge standeth at the door don't let an offense don't let offenses or differences or even hate provoke you to hate the one that is different the offender or the hatred because the judge standeth at the door there's somebody watching now I could take that and project it in a way and place it correctly in a way that says there's a judge that's watching you and watching your actions and watching how you respond and don't think for a second that you can have that in your heart and justify it and say oh no I'm I'm just the judge standeth at the door and there's a picture then of this judge watching out over his children saying that's Unbecoming conduct that's becoming conduct and we could go that way but since things have been so heavy lately I want to take a little bit different approach on this because it's just as much of the meaning as that would be is saying there's one watching the judge standeth at the door and there's one who knows the offense who knows the difference who knows the hate there's one watching that you should trust in other words where's the confidence Grudge not not against somebody else lest you be condemned so it's it's showing the condemnation that comes but it says the judge standeth at the door not just for your condemnation but also for your confidence that you could yes there is a judge that's watching there is a righteous God that I am I am part of that I'm one with that is looking at the situation and he's the one I should be trusting I hope you can stay close to this thought now as we move forward in Romans 12: 19 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place under wrath now there that such a beautiful picture give place under wrath it doesn't mean the Wrath in your heart but you've got to accept that God is the one that will avenge God is the one that will judge and if you act you can actually take God's justice off of that person if you try to seek your own Revenge God may say all right you picked your you picked your punishment I watched a clip one time where they asked this man at is sentencing he claimed he was innocent I'm going to commit all my powers and everything I have in my mind I'm going to commit it to finding the killer so the judge said okay well that killer the one that did this what do you think they should get he goes I don't think they should ever breathe another breath and he goes I sentence you to life and that he got what he was asking for and so there's a there's something where we're trying to get that kind of Vengeance we're kinding to kind of get that kind of justice but God would be the kind of person oh you've exacted a measure of Revenge fine you want to go your way I can't do anything it's saying give place to wrath those let God deal with the sit situation let the one to whom it is just to act the one is just to respond let him act for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay sayith the Lord verse 14 of that very chapter bless them which persecute you bless and curse not so where there's persecution where there's revilings where there's hatred where there's offense where there's a a defrauding where there's something been taken away from you don't put it upon yourselves or take it under your own power to get back at them if they've lied they oh they're going to get it Bud you're going to get it I'm going to get them back says don't act don't avenge yourselves and in other words don't take Vengeance now if you want an example of Vengeance this this to me puts it in terms I actually wrote the scenario out so that we could have I could have it here to work through it this is an illustration of Vengeance let's say that you're you're a daughter in a family and you have some siblings you have some brothers maybe three brothers and your brother asked you to borrow a pencil the brother says no and so then there's some offense there you just want a pencil there's hundreds of them they're right there on your desk and this didn't happen today but you can I'm certainly there's a lesson to be learned by by my children Jack's giving me a thumbs up okay your brother asked to borrow a pencil and he says no so then later on your brother asked to borrow a book and this is Vengeance because you wouldn't let me borrow a book I'm not going to or borrow a pencil I'm not going to let you borrow borrow a book come on somebody that's Vengeance that is exactly what vengeance is now I know in your mind you were thinking if somebody kills your mom you kill their mom and their dad right if somebody dings your car you slash all their tires IND Dent every Fender and in your mind you're thinking that's what Vengeance Is Right vengeance is to really get something from somebody but vengeance is just as simple as oh because you didn't do it for me I'm not going to do it for you you're not nice to me why should I bece to you that's Vengeance now I know we're thinking to protect our self-interest come on kids listen to me now I know we're thinking that we're just protecting our own self-interest and you won't let me do this and you won't let me do that and because you won't let me do this you won't let me do that I'm going to respond to you that is what vengeance is you're getting back at them and to me from my vantage point even though I'm guilty of the same it doesn't make any sense because you just reinforce that kind of negative dynamic because the next time you go go back to borrow pencil because you didn't let me borrow the book I'm letting you Bor not letting you borrow the pencil and she's like but no I didn't let you borrow the book because you didn't let me borrow the pencil it's like but now I'm not letting you borrow my pencil because you wouldn't let me borrow the book and everybody just pointing at each other right and the next thing is dad ground them they won't let me borrow the pencil it's like nope I've got a rule now when they ask for punishment nothing when they tell me what to do nothing I just need some noise canc and headphones I'm not going to do a thing cuz you can't make me you can't tell me what to do tell them to stop bugging me nope tell them to leave me alone nope so there's a there's this is really practical right there's now now if you could just instead of just humoring ourselves about the kids what about us as Petty adults sometimes and how we act out our Vengeance in other ways right the Bible says it this way in Exodus 23:5 if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden so a man has his Beast a burden his donkey falling on him and what US forbear to help him and other words you're not going to help him Thou shalt surely help him this ties into love your neighbor as yourself and not just love your neighbor but love your enemy because if you see the one that hates you hurting and in need it says Thou shalt surely help him why why would we do it because it's Vengeance isn't ours when someone hates you like that's a guy that hates me that's a guy that stole that's a guy that did this that's a guy that did that that's not your opportunity to be like right it's in that moment he says you should surely help him why the judge standeth at the door the judge knows that's not your chance to get him back that's not your chance for justice the Lord is at the door and he will defend his own he will avenge his own avenge not yourselves don't try to even the score give place to God to give the Vengeance I will repay sayith the Lord this is what James is drawing from AKA known as Paul tonight this is what he's drawing from when he says the judge standeth at the door why does he tell us that lest you be condemned when he says it there in verse 9 but look at verse six also where it says ye have condemned the unjust man the rich man you've condemned and killed the just but now there's condemnation there's killing there's murder there's defrauding there's LIE there's pain there's offenses there differences but he says don't Grudge don't hate back lest you be condemned also hate subjects you to condemnation hate will subject you to judgment and if I could just put it this way the reason why at the very least is oftentimes your hate causes you to respond with the same offense to which you've endured someone lies you you word use words right back and so whatever punishment was just for this them is truly just for you amen I like how they're starting to identify the kind of the logical fallacies that exist in politics that now there's going to be the death penalty for abortion for doctors that could perform it was being threatened in other words life is so valuable let's just give the death penalty to the guy who takes it that's what hate will do it blinds us to all these fallacies hate subject you to condemnation cuz hate comes with the price it's true brother holding on to resent anger we've already dealt with this in the cancer the canker side of it it it's painful and harmful for yourself brother brandom I I think I read this in part one or part two brother says notice how organization breeds hatred I think it was part two organization breeds hatred now that shows you the organization in other words you draw a line and you organize so you create your party there's The Strife there's the grouping together and it I it distinguishes itself we're an org we're an organization cuz we believe this he says it breeds ha hatred by virtue of carving yourself out it breeds hatred because now there's the ingroup and there's the out group there's the in party there's the in Click there's the cool kids and then there's the Geeks or whatever it carves things out he says it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness hatred destroys Fellowship hatred makes bitter and he said a roote of bitterness defiles many so more and more defilements coming into that age smna he says every age would fill its scars why because of hatred hatred subjects you to condemnation judgment pain hardship it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness so by yielding to the spirit of anger and hate you come under the condemnation of the wicked the judge standeth at the door in other words you could either come under the hate and be condemned or you could see the judge and yield yourself to the judge James is saying don't trouble yourself with hate the Bible said leave it in the hands of God don't don't trouble yourself with it if you pick up the mantle of hate you assume the responsibility to deal with it to deal with the offense to deal with the issue to deal with the difference when we take that kind of mantle you're going to confront it you're going to take care of it you're going to make things right you're going to even the score he says leave it in the hands of God if I can put it this way don't trust in yourself don't take it upon yourself don't anoint yourself as the Avenger don't anoint yourself as the leveler don't anoint yourself as the one that's going to even the score I I that it's not yours to do live above the Hate by trust in the Lord amen and not don't trust in your flesh and your own ideas that somehow you can level the playing field that you can make right what's been wrong I hope that this can come out in a little bit clear picture now is I need to transition for time sake that there's a certain idea that we convince ourselves when we hate that I know how to make this right I know how to deal with this I know how to get back at them I know how to protect myself and you're not trust in the Lord you're trus in yourself and that's why you utilize the emotion of hate is you've somehow convinced yourself that you can make better than God can Amen in Philippians chapter 3: 3 and 4 for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh quite a distinction and he's bringing that contrast though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more here Paul also known as James he would argue that I of everybody have more reason to trust in myself than any of you but I'm not going to do it amen I will not have any confidence in the flesh I will not trust in some perceived Advantage as Paul begins to give his resume if I have reason to think that I've got a better response than you I if I I have reason to do that because look at my resume if anyone has reason to to boast that they could do this I could I have no reason to trust in some sort of perceived advantage or some sort of higher opinion or proposition that I'm in the right I'm more just I'm more correct wasn't not David that when he was reviled against he said pre-venture God made him do it and didn't suppose himself that oh everything every offense and every wrong is just the devil acting a contrary against God's will he says pre-venture that God allowed it that's a way of diffusing the hate diffusing the retri tion not escalating the conflict we should not have confidence in our own sense of justice just think of how few people would exist on Earth today if we we could just act on our hate Justified but we should have no confidence in the flesh let's look at psalms 27 now in this light in this vantage point this perspective of hatred collecting together and Gathering Together Grudge not against another lest you be condemned the judge standeth at the door so you can choose hatred or you could choose the judge not for judgment but for confidence for justice for vengeance for your rest for your peace of mind for your health for your safety taking all the things that James talked about the things that would cause The Grudge the bitter envy and strife versus the wisdom that's from above the confidence where's the confidence David says this the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid these questions are rhetorical in the sense that the answer ought to be obvious we should not read these and be like wow that's a really good question um the Lord is your light and your salvation Whom Shall you fear Now who is the worst boss like who would be who's that demon or that devil or that villain that you should be afraid of and there's not a there's not an exercise to be done here the answer is no one that's right the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid well I think I think you should be afraid of the Hulk or I you should be afraid of a disease you should be afraid of poverty the answer is nothing no one it's assumed and now let's we kind of put ourselves in the throws of the brother who's not able to borrow the book because he didn't loan a pencil it kind of gets serious he says when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat of My Flesh they stumbled and fell though an H should encamp against me my heart shall not fear now that fear is really key to hatred I'll probably pick up on it maybe on Sunday or next Wednesday my heart shall not fear fear cuz he's saying Whom Shall I Fear who shall I be afraid of he's showing these contrasted emotions in the light of this aggression that's being shown to him the war should Rise Against Me hostility animosity bitterness resentment hatred coming against you someone who thinks they've got a just cause to tear you down you're wrong you shouldn't be doing this to me instead of hating he says in this will I be confident wow he's actually addressing those things which provocate while giving us the secret to overcoming it cuz here here's the enemy they that hated him those that would seek his ruin desire to see him fail it's not a sibling who feels that they have been unjustly deprived of a writing utensil it's not a sibling who feels agreed because they have been deprived of something to read while they were bored this is someone who realizes this is an enemy that seeks to see me fail they want to eat up my flesh they want to destroy me they want to take my life away they want to take my family away they want to take my health away this is one like James 5 who's going to cause me to work work work work work and then never pay me and shouldn't I Grudge them shouldn't I hate them shouldn't I get back at them like in other words if you built a portico or put in a a sun room for somebody and they didn't pay you just go tear it down right I put it in going to show up with a bulldozer just tear it out write a will from somebody they don't pay you sneak into the house open up their safe and burn it that way when they die none of their heirs get what they want you they're going they asked for hey he says in this will I be confident think of the cuz in big ways and small ways we're provoked to hate in big ways and small ways we can build a resentment and grudges and bitterness and sometimes it could just be Pebble upon Pebble sometimes it's big huge Stones sometimes it's big huge wounds but other times it just may be a little bit nitpick nitpicking and sometimes just enough just enough needling right eventually right unless you're an acupuncturist don't need needle somebody just a little bit of a needling all of a sudden it just causes a blow up because in big and small ways we can be building up but I I say this and I say this with confidence and if I if if the the truth of this is lost in the way that I phrase it I I I apologize but there's really no circumstances under which we're Justified to hold on to hate this kind of hate but David also known as Paul James he says some very strong things about what these people are doing to hate to destroy him in Psalms 109: 1-5 hold not thy peace oh god of my praise for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are open against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue they've compassed me about also with words of hatred and have fought against Me Without a Cause when David is being surrounded and maybe this complicates it that when we it would I think that it would complicate it or maybe how how can I say this this resolves some sort of complexity because when somebody's done something wrong to us or we've done something wrong to somebody and they hate us that's when it's like come on be real I mean David they've all gathered against you because you went into their house and burned their will right like you went and tore down the sun room you built from that this is why they've come back against you you because you escalated the conflict but David said done nothing right yes and so this is one of those moments where hate would be so easy to justify cuz ultimate doesn't really fall back on you and saying I know I started it I know I escalated it they did this they didn't let me borrow the book that's why I denied them the pencil but then they did you but in this situation David can say hey they asked for a book I gave it to them they asked for a pencil I gave it to them I I I let them defraud me this is without cause they've compassed me about with words of hatred fought against me without a cost for my love they are my adversaries and there's the real kernel of Truth there but I give myself into prayer and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love now David if you can I was going to read all 31 verses of this chapter because man it gets really rich but David now affords us an example for the worst of times because in big ways and small ways we could provoke be provoked to hate but he's given us an example for the worst of times but also for the most normal times the most the smallest of offenses that breed hatred and when David is in this situation I love how he cries out in this because in Psalms 109 if you were to read this he says this he says let his days be few let another take his office let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow let his children be continually vagabonds and beg let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places he's just being honest about how he feels I don't know that any one of us should just kind of knit this into a nice uh Mosaic or whatever a and put it on our wall have it printed out those really nice hipster fonts and put it in our powder bath so everyone in there who's just kind of washing their hands before dinner says let their children be fatherless as some sort of platitude that we should all aspire to but it's just being honest about how these feelings can overwhelm them but in this instance he gives us the right kind of response because where was David's confidence in the end what what was David saying I hearby sharpen my sword that I might cut all the necks of those who have me and hate me unjustly what did he give himself over to in this instance the Lord amen amen the Lord was going to be his help in this time of assault and danger the Lord was going to be his light the Lord was going to be his salvation the Lord was going to be the strength of his life when he saw the wicked even his enemies coming to take his life he didn't trust in his ability to defend his life he trusted in God's ability to sustain life he didn't trust in his ability to fight and respond in kind he said Lord I look to you as my life I look to you as my salvation therefore because I trust in you I do not have to have confidence in my ability to fight or defend myself I can just trust in you he says in this will I be confident in this will I feel safe in this will I trust in this will I be bold and secure that you are my light and my salvation that you are the strength of my life and in light of this confidence watch what no recognize what he seeks he doesn't seek retribution doesn't give in resentment or hatred notice what he begins to seek after and aspire to one thing have I desired verse four of the Lord that I will seek after not Vengeance not wrath not judgment not even all those things he recites in Psalms 109 but he says that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple so much depth to this he doesn't desire wrath he doesn't desire hatred he's not Desiring retribution he comes to a place where he recognizes this being a Rapture scripture I think it speaks of maturity speaks of growth not in our youth always lashing out and responding but that real seasoning out the the self-control that comes as it grows in us one thing have I desired and I'll seek after this to dwell in the house of the Lord to behold the beauty of the Lord you want to behold the beauty of Christ he's hanging on a cross he's been unjustly accused of crimes he's been unjustly accused of blasphemy he's been unjustly scourged he's been traded for a murderer he's been beaten and nailed to a cross and here he is hanging on the cross unjustly he cries out father forgive them for they know not what they do he could have he could have acted out in hatred and Spite and Malice behold the beauty of the Lord in a moment when he had been undone when he had been unjustly accused he said forgive him and Paul tells us in Ephesians 4 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed into the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice let it be put away let it not have place in your heart Jesus doesn't lash out he doesn't revile back he doesn't speak Angry Words even when the thief on the cross was accusing him and beray and belittle him in that moment he didn't give in to the he just spoke kindness to the one who had empathy and who had sorrow father forgive me I I'm the one that deserves to be here I've sinned Jesus forgive me he says this day you'll be with me in Paradise this is what we ought to Aspire to to put away anger wrath and bitterness clam and evil speaking and this malice all which has some connection and connectivity to hatred and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sakes hath forgiven you when I'm talking about where's the confidence I'm challenging us to recognize what hate motivates us to do versus what love will motivate us to do and how that hate kind of gives us the badge of authority and anoints us to be the Avenger and we act upon our own instincts and responses putting confidence in our wrath and anger rather than God and hate wants to use Force hate wants to use evil speaking and bitterness and wrath and clamor and all these things fa hate wants to use Force but love will use wisdom and that's the real secret to overcoming offenses and differences Even in our interactions with one another whether it be spouses or with our children when we can have the the understanding I don't want to use Force hate will use Force whereas wisdom will use other means brother brandom in that sermon from that time he says we got the wrong con conception of power this is one I was in intending to use on Sunday says power is overcoming returning good for evil that's real power in in those terms many times when we respond to the offender with a similar offense we're kind of boasting that we're stronger oh you think that's a cut down listen to this one you think that was a good lie I've got a better one you think that was a good punch I've got a better punch but he's saying that's not power returning good for evil that's real power that can love your enemy and do good to those that do evil to you that's real power that's God's power want to show them how much strength you have don't you don't need to match wits you don't need to match conspiracies and and being con con conniving kids were listening to something where these hedgehogs are being accused of being connivers they said we're not connivers we're we're we're plant eaters I think they a little bit of a misunderstanding of what a conniver is and this he says that you could when you can love your enemy and do good to those that do evil to you that's real power that's God power he says Maniacs can break chains but it takes a real man to return good for evil from his heart not because of religious duty but from his heart that's what we want to come to the place where in our hearts we truly not in that moment where it's like there's just a boiling rage it's like well I don't want to act like a hypocrite and I don't want to do something to show everybody I got the worst temper so I'm going to pretend to handle this right and you're still boiling really come to a place where yes that temperature May begin to rise but as it Force you're going to resort to this this wisdom from above you're say no no no no no no no I don't want to return this Amen in Colossians 31213 and 14 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bows of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering these characteristics that are the opposite of hatred forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye he does not condemn you for quarreling he does not condemn you for having a he just now those with the quarrel those with the disagreement those with thought just forgive leave it let it go and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness hatred will undo the perfectness the perfectness but charity bonds it together 1 Peter 4: 8 and9 and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for it shall cover the multitude of sins use hospit Hospitality one to another without grudging give loan right Grudge not don't hold the grudge don't bear The Grudge I think this is maybe what it takes if I could give some hope to those if this still seems to be heavy it's putting the power in your hand to diffuse a situation that's been roiling for a long time that I could break the cycle of tit fortat spy versus spy prank versus prank I could break the cycle Now by giving Hospitality by love covering by not grudging and not serving grudgingly use Hospitality without grudging know there there a way that you could do something for somebody right because I have to I guess I won't punch you I guess I won't do this and it it exudes The Grudge and it keeps the cycle going yes but David is saying in this will I be confident I'm not going to put myself confidence in schemes and paybacks and a one uping things I'm not going to do it he says for in the time of trouble Psalms 275 and6 Brothers you could come to your instruments for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock he shall do it in this will I be confident the Lord has is my light and my salvation the Lord of God is the strength of my life that is what I'm confident in and because I'm confident in him in the existence of this trouble in this time of trouble he's going to hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his time he shall hide me he shall set me up upon a rock I will not fear what man can do unto me the lies the rumors the disputings all these things that are happening they Compass me with words of hatred they're grudging against me without cause they've rewarded me evil for good I don't have to reward evil for evil I can still give back good why because the Lord is going to set me up upon a rock the Lord is going to look out after me this is why David can say the battle is the Lord's God said vengeance is mine sayith the Lord I'll trust in him and not myself the judge is at the door I'll Trust the judge I just got this picture in my mind of you being in a situation and there's an offense and you start getting worked up and in maybe some symbolic way or some analogy you begin to kind of ball your fist up you get to purse your lips and you find yourself getting ready to respond and you're getting ready to attack them and just over the shoulder of your adversary you see the Lord standing at the door amen and as you see him you realize no I don't need to worry about this not because you're afraid of let letting down the Lord not because you you're going to disappoint not because of some religious Duty not because you want to be you're afraid of being condemned thought we could travel that path but in that moment you realize with God before me who can be against me with the judge in his presence in a time of trouble he when the Lord himself has descended with a shout when I find myself in his presence why should I be worried about all these barking squirrels why should I be worried about all these chattering Chipmunks why should I be worried about all these scoffers and mockers in the last last day the judge is here I trust in him and he's hid me in the secret of his presence and he set me up upon a rock and then this this phrase in here in verse six and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices the joy I will sing y I will sing praises unto the Lord notice what's not in his mouth cursings disputings revilings fighting back arguing there's not hatred there's just praise for the Lord the judge is at the door let's reverence him he's here let's worship him but this phrase now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me it struck me this way over these last few weeks now I will not allow my soul to be degraded by hatred I will live above the hate am the hatred is trying to bring me low the hatred is trying to narrow and debase me the hatred is trying to degrade me the narrow this this hatred is trying to get me to be Earthly and uh sensual and devilish the the devil's trying to get me to respond carnally the devil's W me to avenge myself draw my sword fight back the devil these things the enemies wanted me to hate so they can be justified in their hatred they're wanted me to deprive they're wanting me to Grudge he says now now because the judge I've recognized him now I'll be lifted above it I can live above the hate now my head will be lifted above it why could he do it because he trusted in the Lord and when we trust in the Lord we can be confident but we abandon our confidence when we yield to hate now you you you have confidence but in yourself it's the same thing for a peace and our strength right and love and our our confidence that there's something we can get our strength from there's something we can find love in there's something that we can find peace in there's someone we can confide in and have confidence and Trust in but it's when we lose sight of that that we give into hate brother BR makes this statement of sermon thirsting for life he says the pleasure of a Christian is serving the lord at the house of God one thing have I desired that will I seek after you don't have to sign no card you can't open the door quick enough and if the members of the church love one another enough instead of putting the little clicks and pulling away from the church brother if you love one another so much that it just hurts your heart till you got together you just got together again that's the way it should be because it's that something that's inviting and welcoming talk about the house of the Lord and I I'm sharing this to talk to identify confidence and even go back to where's the strength cuz he begins to sing blessed to be the tithe that binds our hearts in Christian Love The Fellowship of Kindred mind is like to that above when we are sunnd part it gives us inward pain but we sh still shall be joined in heart in hope to meet again hatred destroys Fellowship breeds bitterness he says he says oh God if we have to take every Miracle out of the church if we have to take out all the pipe organs and the plush pews give us back to that Godly love Brotherly Love among the people in fellowship if we have to do all that take it back to that again now that should be emphasized say what good is all of our Miracles all of our worship and music and syncopation and vocalization and all the plush pews and all the gingerbread to our new churches what good is all those things if we don't have Godly love brotherly love if we don't have unity and fellowship ship and what good is it to have all that power and still hate your neighbor what good is it to have all that and still clamor and be evil and be bitter and be jealous and lash out and Destroy and defraud and lie and manipulate and confuse what good is all that fantastic and all that pie in the sky and not have the love of God in your heart he said oh God take away the Miracles take away the music take away the pews if that's what it takes to get love in our hearts and hate out he says do it because that's where the real confidence is that's where the real power is take out the Miracles take out the worship take out the music take out the hate cuz what good is all that with hate I'd rather have no Miracles no pipe organs no plush pews I think the only thing we'd have to worry about is miracles in this church don't have a pipe organ don't have pews but to say go ahead take out the Miracles because we've seen miracles in this church a lot of them but we should have the kind of heart to say Lord if there's if there's hate that's Brewing if hate has place and what it takes is for you to take out the Miracles in order to get rid of the hate we should be willing to say yes Lord and not use Miracles and signs and wonders and bodily exercise and the operation of the gifts as a cover hate let's Stand Together
