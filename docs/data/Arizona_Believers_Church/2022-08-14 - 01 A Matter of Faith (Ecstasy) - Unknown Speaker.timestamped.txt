[0:00] um starting something different that I
[0:02] believe will be
[0:03] complementary to what we've been
[0:05] ministering on Divine Healing but I want
[0:07] to take a statement I believe that we've
[0:09] read already to this point brother
[0:10] Branham says in question and answers and
[0:13] healing is based upon faith not upon how
[0:16] righteous you are how good you are how
[0:19] much you keep the Commandments or
[0:20] whatever it is it's based solemnly upon
[0:23] faith we know that it's not an emotional
[0:25] workup it's not a mental tantrum that uh
[0:28] Faith healing is based solely upon Faith
[0:31] all things are possible to them that
[0:33] believe and he says it's not based upon
[0:36] how good you are and it makes this
[0:38] curious statement I think something that
[0:39] really causes us to really think hard
[0:42] about what he's referring to and how
[0:44] even it could it be that someone who's
[0:45] not even a Christian benefit from
[0:47] something that's only activated by faith
[0:50] when a Christian who is a Christian by
[0:51] faith can't seem to tap into it have you
[0:54] ever considered those things I
[0:56] confronted with the reality I'm a
[0:57] Believer and I pray and don't get what I
[0:59] I want but here's somebody who doesn't
[1:01] even believe
[1:02] and yet they can utilize Faith to
[1:05] activate a promise of God even to the
[1:07] point and I find myself already getting
[1:09] pulled into areas that I don't want to
[1:10] touch on but just make reference to it
[1:12] even to the point where brother Branham
[1:14] says that if someone approaches
[1:16] something believing that's God they can
[1:19] get something out of it because they
[1:21] they just take their faith and they
[1:22] project it towards something that is not
[1:25] not the truth necessarily or the source
[1:27] of God's power but God will honor that
[1:30] simple Act of Faith and that's what he's
[1:31] referring to here uh in part but yet a
[1:35] prostitute can come to the platform and
[1:37] be instantly healed
[1:39] and that's all by faith and a sainted
[1:42] woman crossed the platform and miss it
[1:45] he says sure it's based upon faith if
[1:47] thou can'tst believe not upon
[1:49] righteousness so there's some credit may
[1:51] be given to a sainted sister who's
[1:53] righteous who lives holy who has a life
[1:55] of conviction and a sainted woman and
[1:58] then someone who's not even living a
[2:00] holy life can come up and activate the
[2:02] faith necessary to be healed he says
[2:04] healing is just based upon faith
[2:07] and so my title I don't know how many
[2:09] services I may spend on this but my
[2:11] title is a matter of faith and I want to
[2:14] explore the subject of Faith as a
[2:17] compliment to the series Christ my
[2:20] healer and we're going to be gone for a
[2:21] few services and I'd like to pick back
[2:23] up on Christ my healer but I want to
[2:26] look at a matter of faith and my
[2:27] subtitle is ecstasy and I know that that
[2:31] may seem a little bit shocking but it
[2:32] may be for a point
[2:34] just to get your attention and as you I
[2:37] want this title just to stay up there
[2:38] for a moment before we go to our next
[2:40] quote
[2:41] when I say a matter of faith
[2:43] if healing is based upon faith
[2:46] we need to be sure that we don't have
[2:47] the false idea of faith
[2:50] and I and I believe those are the
[2:51] Dynamics that are at work when a
[2:52] prostitute can come through the prayer
[2:54] line and get healed but a sainted woman
[2:56] come right through the same prayer line
[2:57] with the same promise and he says and
[3:00] miss it and it's because maybe this is
[3:02] just conjecture on my part but the
[3:05] prostitute doesn't know anything other
[3:06] than the fact that God said he would
[3:08] heal her or that healing is being made
[3:11] available through that prayer line so
[3:12] it's just simple faith enough to believe
[3:14] that I'm here in need of prayer for my
[3:17] healing and she can receive it whereas
[3:19] the sainted woman has a lot more in her
[3:21] mind about what faith is which is a lot
[3:24] more teaching a lot more scripture a lot
[3:25] more experience a lot more services and
[3:27] so there's just a lot more things if I
[3:29] could say that could come into the
[3:31] picture and perhaps confuse faith
[3:34] we've used the phrase anecdotal Faith a
[3:37] few times and it's really just a term
[3:38] that I've used myself and so
[3:41] it's not necessarily something that
[3:42] would be rooted in you know some sort of
[3:45] theology or anything that brother
[3:46] Branham preached though there's uh
[3:48] instances that you could use at that
[3:50] phrase form but when I use the phrase
[3:53] anecdotal faith I'm just talking about
[3:55] something of Faith that's a belief
[3:57] that's been cultivated uh By Word of
[4:00] Mouth only and doesn't necessarily rest
[4:03] upon the word of God and so that
[4:05] anecdotal is just on the account of
[4:07] something and so when you have a faith
[4:09] that's just based upon someone else's
[4:11] personal I guess anecdotal would be in
[4:14] reality just something you base your
[4:16] belief or you base something solely upon
[4:18] someone else's account without backing
[4:20] it up without any research maybe
[4:22] scientifically they could talk about
[4:24] anecdotal evidence but and and just
[4:27] because it's anecdotal doesn't mean it's
[4:28] not necessarily true but when we say
[4:30] anecdotal Faith you're basing your
[4:33] belief on someone else's process
[4:35] you're basing your belief upon somebody
[4:37] else's results instead of the promise
[4:40] that brought the results and so when I
[4:42] talk about anecdotal Faith it's you as
[4:44] an observer see what someone else has
[4:46] has done and you're basing your faith on
[4:49] what's external as opposed to the the
[4:52] faith that was underlying the process
[4:54] the faith that was motivating to go
[4:56] through the prayer line the faith that
[4:58] was motivating them to have hands laid
[5:00] on them and that's what activated that's
[5:02] what brought the healing was the faith
[5:04] in the word of God and so anecdotals
[5:07] when we kind of strip the word of God
[5:08] out of it the real substance from it and
[5:11] only kind of view the process
[5:13] in the sermon be not afraid it is I
[5:15] brother Bram says Divine Healing is not
[5:17] a based based upon some emotion it's not
[5:20] based upon some laying on of hands or
[5:23] some strange feeling or sensation it's
[5:25] based upon a faith in a work that was
[5:28] done for you by Jesus Christ at Calvary
[5:31] it's a finished product
[5:34] it's based upon faith in a work it says
[5:38] it's a finished product now this next
[5:40] statement just opens up the channel that
[5:42] I'm wanting to look at and every person
[5:44] here tonight that is sick and Afflicted
[5:46] as far as God is concerned you are
[5:49] already healed
[5:51] so at the present in this and as he
[5:54] looks out upon his audience at that very
[5:56] moment there was the truth that there
[5:59] were people who were sick and afflicted
[6:01] so you could ask somebody how do you
[6:03] feel I don't feel very good um are you
[6:05] sick yes I'm sick it was their present
[6:06] experience it was their present reality
[6:08] but then he makes the statement as far
[6:10] as God is concerned
[6:12] or so from God's Viewpoint or from God's
[6:15] in God's opinion you are already healed
[6:21] recognize these two Vantage points then
[6:23] here they set presently sick but he's
[6:25] saying as far as God's concerned you are
[6:28] already healed and in that very
[6:30] statement I want you to see this layer
[6:32] how that brother Branham proposes a
[6:34] reality that's different than the one
[6:36] that the person is presently
[6:38] experiencing
[6:40] could be sitting there in pain sitting
[6:42] there sick sitting there Afflicted with
[6:44] a lifetime of miseries
[6:46] um Decades of diagnoses and years of
[6:48] surgeries and in months of
[6:51] procedures and and medicines and
[6:54] prescriptions and and that's all real
[6:56] you can grab the pill bottle and shake
[6:58] it you you feel the after effects of
[7:00] certain things by saying from a
[7:02] different Vantage Point as far as God is
[7:04] concerned or in his opinion you're not
[7:06] sick at all
[7:08] so when we say a matter of faith
[7:12] it is a play on uh the statement a
[7:15] matter of fact
[7:16] or as a matter of fact I think we're
[7:19] familiar with those two different
[7:20] statements a matter of fact or as a
[7:22] matter of fact a matter of fact if
[7:24] something belonging to the realm of fact
[7:26] as distinct from just an opinion or
[7:28] someone's guess something that doesn't
[7:29] really have a basis when you say it's a
[7:31] matter of fact you're asserting that
[7:33] there's some basis for it and it it's
[7:35] it's in the realm of fact to say as a
[7:38] matter of fact you're essentially saying
[7:39] in reality or actually so it's used
[7:42] especially if you're going to correct a
[7:44] lie or a misstatement or something
[7:45] that's not quite misrepresented right or
[7:47] some sort of misunderstanding someone
[7:48] says yeah it snowed yesterday in
[7:51] Flagstaff and maybe some would say well
[7:54] actually or as a matter of fact it
[7:55] didn't snow and so you're kind of trying
[7:58] to correct the record
[8:00] and I do believe that fact is different
[8:03] from truth and and I don't want to
[8:05] necessarily Veer into that but the fact
[8:07] is something that has actual existence
[8:09] and actual occurrence or somebody say an
[8:12] objective reality
[8:14] and so when we say as a matter of fact
[8:17] it's something that's actual
[8:19] it's something that has actually been
[8:20] done when you say in fact you're saying
[8:22] in truth in reality that's the way that
[8:25] it is it's not imagined it's not made up
[8:27] it's a fact has the quality of being
[8:29] actual and just to scratch uh this itch
[8:33] in the and law when there's a matter of
[8:35] fact juries are Trier is a fact they're
[8:37] the ones that determine fact and a
[8:40] matter of fact is that which is observed
[8:42] or that which is to be determined by the
[8:44] senses
[8:45] you determine by the census or by the
[8:47] testimony of witnesses who describe what
[8:50] they have perceived through the sense of
[8:52] sight smell touch taste or hearing so a
[8:55] witness is standing there and they're
[8:57] offering evidence that to a jury they're
[8:59] the Trier of fact and it's they're
[9:02] determining whether it's a matter of
[9:03] fact and it can only be based upon what
[9:06] someone perceives through their senses
[9:08] and that's what we'd say a matter of
[9:10] fact
[9:11] it's what I see it's what I hear it's
[9:13] what I taste what I smell and and it's
[9:15] something that has some basis in reality
[9:18] so now kind of playing off of that
[9:20] phrase a matter of fact or a mat uh in
[9:23] fact is a matter of faith
[9:26] when I say a matter of faith it presents
[9:29] a different realm of fact
[9:31] it presents a different realm of reality
[9:34] and I do not believe that I'm proposing
[9:37] a different view of Faith but I'm really
[9:39] wanting to be very
[9:40] um very focused on a particular aspect
[9:43] that we must give attention to
[9:45] and so I'm just going to step back for a
[9:47] moment and speak more to the common our
[9:50] common reality as humans
[9:52] uh to set up what I mean by a matter of
[9:54] faith Humanity proposes two different
[9:57] realities
[9:58] a subjective reality an objective
[10:01] reality
[10:02] and those you probably heard those terms
[10:03] before and I'd like to spend more time
[10:05] on some of these aspects as it relates
[10:06] to the word but let me just do this
[10:09] exercise so that we can consider this a
[10:11] subjective reality is coming from a
[10:13] single point of view or your own point
[10:15] of view to some today subjective reality
[10:17] may be that it's hot here it's hot in
[10:19] the sanctuary to others you might be
[10:21] cold and that's a subjective reality and
[10:24] it's kind of I think once you get into
[10:26] it it's kind of a related to your ego
[10:29] and the ego is kind of what mediates uh
[10:32] your uh the reality with how you feel
[10:35] and kind of coming to a sense of self
[10:37] and the way things are to you uh to have
[10:40] a subjective Viewpoint it's our own
[10:42] mental activity and how we perceive
[10:45] things and there's some that argue
[10:46] that's the only unquestionable fact of
[10:48] our existence
[10:50] is the way you view things
[10:52] it's what you you've heard the phrase
[10:54] perception is reality
[10:57] that's subjective
[10:59] if you perceive it to be cold that's
[11:01] probably your reality that it's that
[11:02] it's cold now objective on the other
[11:05] hand is suggests that it's not
[11:07] influenced uh by an individual feelings
[11:10] or personal opinion and that doesn't
[11:12] influence How You observe facts or how
[11:14] you how you consider something that's
[11:16] taking place
[11:18] and that's why objectivity is typically
[11:20] associated with uh truth reliability or
[11:24] reality
[11:27] and this is where at least from my
[11:29] standpoint knowing where I'm going this
[11:30] is where it kind of gets deep objective
[11:32] reality
[11:33] is the idea that there are Universal
[11:35] truths that apply to all independent of
[11:38] someone's subjective experience
[11:40] so no matter what you're experiencing
[11:43] there's this idea that there's something
[11:45] objective that is universal
[11:47] and so objective reality is independent
[11:50] of one's thoughts one's opinions one's
[11:52] feelings at least that's that's how they
[11:54] Define it
[11:55] but it's very problematic
[11:57] objective reality is perceived through
[11:59] five senses
[12:00] it's something that we are going to
[12:02] perceive with the senses of our body
[12:04] whereas the subjective reality relates
[12:06] to the the sensitivities of our minds
[12:08] we're processing it on another level
[12:12] and if I could say this
[12:16] to have an objective reality is to
[12:18] suggest that different observers can
[12:20] reconcile whatever differences they
[12:22] might have
[12:23] in their own subjective experience
[12:26] and for that to happen you have to make
[12:27] some assumptions
[12:29] and maybe the largest assumption is that
[12:31] there are actually Universal objective
[12:34] facts
[12:36] and then the second assumption is that
[12:37] we could all agree on them
[12:39] otherwise objective reality just kind of
[12:41] Falls in on itself
[12:44] and even then
[12:46] the fact that there could be an
[12:47] objective reality where we reconcile
[12:49] different subjective experiences it
[12:51] assumes that we have a freedom to choose
[12:54] our observations
[12:56] and that when we make are those
[12:58] observations and we're determining
[13:00] what's an objective reality that we're
[13:02] not actually influenced by the opinions
[13:04] of others
[13:05] there's some that argue that you
[13:07] actually don't have any you've never
[13:09] made a choice nothing's really your
[13:10] favorite but something in your life puts
[13:13] put put that steered you in that
[13:15] direction so oh my my favorite drink is
[13:17] Dr Pepper or my favorite food is this
[13:19] and you never actually chose that it was
[13:22] something that was imposed upon you
[13:24] and so there's a lot of assumptions that
[13:26] are related to this objective reality
[13:28] this common shared experience
[13:30] and so a matter of fact proposes
[13:33] something that is in reality a matter of
[13:35] fact at least attempts to suggest that
[13:39] we've established some objective truth
[13:40] or an objective experience
[13:42] but when I say a matter of faith I'm
[13:45] proposing an entirely different reality
[13:48] a reality that's not uh dependent solely
[13:51] upon human objectivity or even our own
[13:54] personal subjectivity a matter of faith
[13:57] I'm not saying it's independent
[13:59] completely but it's not Reliant it's not
[14:01] relying upon the setting aside of my
[14:04] subjective opinion in order to
[14:05] participate in some sort of objective
[14:07] thing but it's something completely
[14:09] different altogether
[14:11] and Revelations chapter 3 verses 17 to
[14:14] 18 and if you've survived through that
[14:17] part of it you can just kind of relax
[14:18] now
[14:19] but I do think that this idea of
[14:21] subjective objective and philosophy is
[14:23] trying to wrestle with what is truth and
[14:24] what is reality and what is existence
[14:26] and are we all just brains in a vat
[14:28] experiencing something and they're
[14:30] wrestling with reality
[14:32] they're trying to explain existence and
[14:34] and and it's it's why science at the end
[14:37] of the day just comes up with this
[14:38] conclusion that it's just absurd life is
[14:41] absurd it doesn't have any meaning but
[14:43] that's when you're looking at as a
[14:44] matter of fact but a matter of faith is
[14:46] completely different
[14:48] Revelations chapter 3 verses 17 and 18 I
[14:51] want to start here in uh bringing this
[14:53] out of the word
[14:55] here is the comment of the Alpha and
[14:58] Omega his observation regarding the
[15:00] church at laodicea because thou sayest I
[15:03] am rich and increased with goods and
[15:05] have need of nothing and no it's not
[15:07] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[15:09] poor and blind and naked I counsel thee
[15:12] to buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[15:15] thou mayest be rich in white raiment
[15:17] that thou mayest be clothed
[15:19] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[15:21] appear and anoint thine eyes with isab
[15:24] that thou may have seen fellowship with
[15:26] brother Burley Williams recently
[15:29] and he was sharing with me that one of
[15:30] the outstanding characteristics of
[15:32] laodicea is they were known for their
[15:35] their the bomb that they made for eyes
[15:37] to anoint eyes and to be able to see and
[15:40] here's God taking something that may be
[15:42] in and that's just based upon the record
[15:45] that is at least shared uh by the
[15:47] historians that he's taking something
[15:49] that would have been known to them in a
[15:51] natural sense and he's flipping it
[15:52] around and putting it in a spiritual
[15:53] sense
[15:55] and he says that because this is so then
[15:57] I'm counting it by gold that you may be
[16:00] rich Raymond that you may be clothed
[16:02] shame of thy nakedness do not appear so
[16:04] Verse 18 is now remedy and remitting
[16:07] God's assessment in verse 17 and I said
[16:09] that you may see
[16:11] verse 17 if we could look at that I want
[16:14] to go back to that brother Joshua where
[16:17] he says Thou sayest I am rich and
[16:18] increase with goods and have needed
[16:20] nothing this is the subjective
[16:22] experience
[16:23] of the layout of sins
[16:25] in their assessment in their opinion and
[16:27] even in their experience they're rich
[16:28] and increase with goods and they are
[16:30] content is their state of mind it is
[16:32] what they perceive we could say that
[16:34] it's their subjective reality we may
[16:37] also argue that it's a conclusion based
[16:39] upon external factors and things that
[16:41] could be observed so maybe it's the
[16:42] objective reality
[16:44] um a shared reality of all laodiceans
[16:46] but this is their reality we're rich
[16:48] we're increased with goods and we're
[16:50] content
[16:51] but then God says and knoweth not
[16:54] so when he says and know it's not God Is
[16:57] providing a different account
[16:59] so you in your reality you're rich
[17:02] increase with goods and contempt but God
[17:04] in God's opinion according to God's
[17:06] account you're actually poor blind and
[17:08] naked
[17:10] and so the despite their actual
[17:13] existence In the Flesh God introduces a
[17:16] reality that contrasts their present
[17:20] state
[17:22] let's recognize it that way hey
[17:24] everything's great we don't need
[17:25] anything we're content we're happy we're
[17:27] rich we're thriving markets we have
[17:29] thriving economies we have access to all
[17:31] sorts of things we have if you have bad
[17:33] eyesight we've got bomb for that and we
[17:35] got close we got money we it
[17:37] everything's good we're rich increase
[17:39] with goods and that may be so from one
[17:41] vantage point from one perspective but
[17:43] God now upends their View
[17:46] like I say was a matter of fact we've
[17:48] got more money than anyone's ever had
[17:49] before as a matter of fact we've got
[17:51] more more uh treatments for diseases
[17:53] than any other time before as a matter
[17:55] of fact we have this as a matter of fact
[17:57] we have that as a matter of fact we have
[17:58] this but God is saying as a matter of
[18:00] faith
[18:01] you're naked
[18:03] it's a matter of Faith you're blind as a
[18:05] matter of Faith this is the reality and
[18:07] what God has done is he's turned he's
[18:09] upended their view of reality hey
[18:11] everything's great no actually it's not
[18:13] upon what basis
[18:16] in Acts chapter 17 verse 6
[18:19] I'm just focusing on this one scripture
[18:21] because I want to recognize this phrase
[18:22] it says and when they found them not
[18:24] they're looking for Paul and Silas
[18:27] and and we're going to get to the
[18:28] comment here why they want to find Paul
[18:30] and Silas they drew Jason in certain
[18:32] Brethren under the rulers of the city
[18:33] crying these that have turned the world
[18:36] upside down are come hither also
[18:39] this is the assessment of those that are
[18:41] wanting to lay hands upon Paul and Silas
[18:44] this is the assessment of them that
[18:46] grabbed a hold of Jason and the other
[18:48] Brethren and what they have declared is
[18:50] these men have turned our world upside
[18:55] down
[18:56] in other words what Paul inside us were
[18:58] preaching and what they were just
[19:00] demonstrating what they were doing
[19:01] upended their world view
[19:04] they they had a certain way of thinking
[19:06] a certain way of living a certain way of
[19:07] believing but now Paul comes preaching a
[19:10] gospel and declaring it with power and
[19:12] demonstration and this alternate reality
[19:15] is now upsetting their order
[19:17] we have a way of viewing things we have
[19:19] a way of believing certain things to
[19:21] exist we have a certain idea of how
[19:23] things are going to turn out but now he
[19:24] says they've turned the world upside
[19:27] down our system has been interrupted
[19:29] it's been it's been upended it's now
[19:32] there's an upheaval in the way that we
[19:34] thought things were because now is
[19:36] something something's acting out of
[19:37] pattern
[19:39] acting outside of our expectation
[19:43] so when the the world has a Viewpoint
[19:46] Rich increased with goods and content
[19:48] this is the way things are When Faith
[19:50] Comes it's actually introducing a
[19:53] different reality it's introducing a
[19:55] different order
[19:57] faith is the kingdom of God in the
[19:59] Kingdom of Heaven apart from the kingdom
[20:01] of man
[20:04] and we're touching on
[20:06] a facet of Faith the faith the faith of
[20:08] God's elect
[20:10] or his faith and not just a personal
[20:12] belief towards something
[20:15] if I could say this I meant to say it at
[20:17] the outset I'm really just trying I'm
[20:20] looking at
[20:21] the subject of Faith so
[20:24] if you could definitely pick a subject
[20:25] that you bite off more than you can chew
[20:28] faith is it
[20:30] and so it's not exhaustive
[20:32] and there's so many different Avenues of
[20:34] it brother I'm introduces at the very
[20:35] outset faith is based upon Divine
[20:37] Healing the Christian doesn't get it but
[20:38] the prostitute does
[20:40] that tells you that there's something
[20:41] varied about faith there's something
[20:43] very Broad and deep about it but I'm
[20:45] wanting to look at this reality is
[20:48] different from ours as being the faith
[20:52] in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 7.
[20:55] Paul says for we walk by faith not by
[20:59] sight in the reading of the scripture
[21:01] it's kind of this parenthetical phrase
[21:02] It's introduced as explanatory to what
[21:05] he's trying to say but it completely
[21:07] stands on its own
[21:08] he's saying just he could have just had
[21:10] eight one book right it could have just
[21:14] been a really short letter just a card
[21:16] that says in it you know to the church
[21:18] at Phoenix before we walk by faith not
[21:21] by sight and it just it Paints the full
[21:23] picture
[21:24] to walk as your course of life it is
[21:27] your order it's your the to walk is your
[21:29] occupation what you're occupied with
[21:31] it's the way you live
[21:33] and so we are occupied by faith
[21:36] this is a gigantic statement
[21:40] we walk by faith and I know that means
[21:42] something to us then we walk by faith
[21:44] it's almost as if it's something we're
[21:45] indicting it's something we're thinking
[21:47] about or something we hold in our minds
[21:49] to be reality but he's saying that we're
[21:51] directed and guided by this faith in the
[21:54] Bible it's translated to assurance and
[21:56] belief it's it comes from uh to be
[21:58] persuaded or persuasion
[22:00] and so we walk by faith it's a way of
[22:04] believing it's a way of perceiving
[22:06] now he walked the walk the life lived by
[22:09] faith is contrasted by sight
[22:12] and he says we walk by faith not by
[22:14] sight he's not referring to the act of
[22:16] vision but the superficial appearance of
[22:19] things the way things present themselves
[22:22] or what seems apparent we walk by faith
[22:25] not by sight not by the way things
[22:27] appear
[22:29] and again it's not just the Activision
[22:31] but the whole thing that's presented to
[22:33] us when we observe it and make
[22:35] conclusions based upon it
[22:37] if I look out upon the audience the fact
[22:40] could be someone's Fanning themselves
[22:42] and that's observable that's the act of
[22:43] vision but then I can perceive and
[22:46] observe and come to the conclusion that
[22:48] based upon that they're hot
[22:51] right based upon that the temperature
[22:52] may be high and he's saying that we walk
[22:55] by faith not by what seems to be
[22:58] apparent
[23:00] whether it be the objective reality or
[23:01] our subjective reality
[23:03] so in other words in our present state
[23:07] right now living and breathing in this
[23:10] body Faith supplants the reality based
[23:14] solely on human perception
[23:18] it it turns it upside down
[23:21] right now unfortunately that doesn't
[23:24] mean we disappear
[23:26] doesn't mean that all of a sudden we're
[23:27] living on another world
[23:30] but yet in where we are right now faith
[23:33] has the ability to turn what we're
[23:35] looking at around
[23:37] and see it completely different than how
[23:39] humans see it
[23:41] humans are living and acting within a
[23:43] reality with certain senses and certain
[23:45] perceptions and certain agreements
[23:46] certain assumptions about the way things
[23:48] are but when you live a life by faith
[23:51] it's pointing to an actual existence
[23:53] that transcends the subjective human
[23:55] existence
[23:57] we're here but yet it's Transcendent it
[24:00] it's not confined to this literal
[24:03] Physical Realm
[24:05] So Divine faith is different from your
[24:09] subjective reality as a human being
[24:11] it's different from the objective
[24:13] reality that's presented in the world
[24:15] and where we're going in society today
[24:18] is the acceptance that there really are
[24:20] no objective truths that are Universal
[24:24] but everyone is allowed to perceive
[24:27] themselves and the world as they want to
[24:30] so regardless of what would be objective
[24:33] in science or observable people can
[24:35] identify as whatever they want
[24:37] there's really no there's no absolute
[24:39] truth or universal truth So Divine faith
[24:42] is is different from this
[24:45] faith is not what you believe
[24:49] according to your subjective reality
[24:53] and I want to be careful with that
[24:55] statement but it's just what you what
[24:57] you see or what you think what you're
[24:59] feeling what your emotions are telling
[25:01] you you see something You observe it and
[25:03] that's not the product of Faith that's
[25:04] not what we're pointing to
[25:06] for faith is not what we believe based
[25:09] upon the acceptance of an objective
[25:12] reality or acknowledgment of an
[25:13] objective reality
[25:15] faith faith is a belief
[25:19] it is a conviction it is an assurance
[25:22] based upon a reality beyond the normal
[25:26] range of Human Experience
[25:28] that's what real genuine faith is it's a
[25:31] faith that's based upon a reality that's
[25:34] not soul that does not solely exist
[25:37] within what I feel
[25:39] faith is based upon something beyond
[25:41] what I'm thinking what I'm feeling my
[25:44] emotions and and what's physical Faith
[25:47] then is Tethered to something and based
[25:49] upon something that goes beyond I use
[25:51] the phrase transcends it goes beyond
[25:53] what I see goes beyond what I feel goes
[25:57] beyond what I think it goes beyond my
[25:59] opinions
[26:01] now those emotions may agree with that
[26:04] but Faith isn't the sum of that
[26:09] if we walk by faith not by sight it is a
[26:13] different reality
[26:14] than the human existence
[26:17] Paul says in Galatians chapter 2 verse
[26:19] 20 I am crucified with Christ so the
[26:22] conclusion is your dad
[26:24] nevertheless I live
[26:26] okay
[26:27] then he says yet not I
[26:29] but Christ liveth in me
[26:32] you might read this and think well why
[26:34] didn't why didn't he just backspace and
[26:36] change it
[26:37] uh why didn't but it's it's to pres it
[26:39] was I'm sure he could have marked it out
[26:41] but he want this emphasis that I am
[26:44] living but it's not me living as I lived
[26:47] before but Christ liveth in me
[26:51] I'm crucified and Dead with Christ but
[26:54] I'm still living and it's not just the
[26:57] me that was before but Christ is living
[26:59] in me and the life which I now live in
[27:03] the flesh
[27:05] the the the the
[27:07] intentional phrasing to say that I'm
[27:11] alive still in this flesh
[27:13] a flesh that sees and tastes and smells
[27:16] and hears and the imagination conscience
[27:19] memory reason and affection all these
[27:21] all these uh senses that relate to the
[27:24] mind and the body I still have all those
[27:26] faculties I still have that capacity but
[27:29] the life that I now live in the flesh I
[27:31] live by the faith of the Son of God who
[27:33] loved me and gave himself for me
[27:37] he says the life that I now live I live
[27:39] by the faith I'm living a life by the
[27:42] Faith of Christ
[27:44] and this life that he's now living
[27:45] that's living by faith is not a new
[27:47] mental process
[27:50] but it is a this faith is the product of
[27:54] the revelation of a Divine reality
[27:57] Paul was living his life he was a
[27:58] Pharisee of the Pharisees he understood
[28:00] the law he understood the writings he
[28:02] understood the history all that was
[28:05] given orally all that was given
[28:06] traditionally all that was observed
[28:08] physically everything that they had been
[28:09] given Paul was a believer in
[28:12] I had certain assumptions about how that
[28:15] all the all the prophecies would be
[28:16] translated in the future so Paul lived
[28:18] and regulated his life after that he
[28:20] says as touching all blameless
[28:23] and that was the way Paul viewed things
[28:25] and observed things but now he says the
[28:28] life I'm crucified with Christ and the
[28:30] life that I now live in the flesh I'm
[28:32] living by the faith of the Son of God
[28:34] Paul is saying that now something has
[28:37] come and completely changed the way I
[28:40] see things
[28:42] and it has been this this faith that he
[28:45] had that he's now living by was the
[28:48] result of the revelation of a Divine
[28:50] reality apart from the reality as a
[28:53] nation apart from the reality as an
[28:55] Israelite
[28:57] so the faith of the Son of God refers to
[29:00] an existence or a New and Living Way as
[29:03] Paul put it that was introduced by Jesus
[29:05] Christ
[29:07] so Christ then is that door
[29:09] to this different way of thinking
[29:11] different way of viewing
[29:13] John chapter 8 verse 23
[29:16] and he said unto them you are from
[29:17] beneath
[29:19] I am from above
[29:21] year of this world I am not of this
[29:24] world
[29:25] he's wanting to he's wanting to create a
[29:27] very distinct dichotomy between the way
[29:31] they viewed things and the way he viewed
[29:33] things
[29:34] they view things a certain way because
[29:36] of their origin he was the way he was
[29:38] and viewed things the way he did because
[29:39] of his origin you are from beneath not
[29:42] only the Earth but influenced of hell
[29:45] he said you are of your father the devil
[29:46] and he brings it back to the beginning
[29:47] you are from Beneath You're of this
[29:50] world sir not only of the Earth but
[29:52] you're from your influence of hell you
[29:54] are but I am from above I am not of this
[29:57] world
[29:58] I have existence I am from I am the this
[30:03] is when he makes that phrase It's a
[30:04] being it's an existence
[30:07] so they existed within this realm of the
[30:10] Earth but he's saying that I am from
[30:13] above there's a different order of
[30:15] things than how you perceive things
[30:17] there's a different reality I am from
[30:19] above something that actually exists
[30:22] brother Bradham says in a man running
[30:24] from the presence of the Lord there
[30:25] never was a creature like him he lived
[30:27] in a world to himself he was born
[30:30] outside of the realm of the natural
[30:33] sinful man
[30:35] born outside of a realm
[30:39] he was born outside of these matter of
[30:41] facts
[30:43] better man talked about him in perfect
[30:45] Faith he was a Mystic to others with his
[30:47] perfect faith
[30:49] that's where this phrase Mystic it's
[30:51] something that seems to be beyond what
[30:53] humans would grasp and Beyond what we
[30:55] would consider to be uh rational
[30:57] Behavior he is a Mystic anyone with
[30:59] perfect faith is a Mystic to the world
[31:03] Jesus Continuum in John chapter 7.
[31:07] are actually just prior I guess to say
[31:08] maybe not continuing but just hitting
[31:10] rewind a little bit then Jesus cried in
[31:12] the temple as he taught saying you both
[31:14] know me and you know whence I am
[31:17] and I am not come of myself
[31:21] but he that sent me is true whom you
[31:23] know not
[31:24] but I know him for I am from him and he
[31:28] hath sit in me
[31:32] you both know me and you know whence I
[31:34] am
[31:36] on on some level using some language and
[31:39] some apprehension and some knowledge you
[31:41] know him and you know where he came from
[31:44] but you don't know he says but I am not
[31:47] come of myself I didn't send myself
[31:51] but I have been sent by someone else
[31:55] and he that sent me is true and you
[31:57] don't know him
[31:59] so you might have some conclusion based
[32:01] upon an external reality based upon your
[32:03] observances and based upon a fact that I
[32:05] was born of a woman and I have brothers
[32:08] and I have a father on this Earth and
[32:10] you may know me after that end and we
[32:13] could just say that's true regardless of
[32:15] whether or not that's what he's
[32:15] referring to but he then touches on this
[32:18] he that sent me you don't know him
[32:22] but I do because I'm from them
[32:25] and he says he that sent me is true
[32:28] now that's it means real
[32:31] and genuine
[32:33] you are from beneath you are from the
[32:35] world I am from him that is true
[32:39] to this word alathenos it means that
[32:41] which contrasts it's contrasted to the
[32:44] appearance of reality
[32:47] something real true genuine not only
[32:49] just the name and the resemblance but
[32:51] the real nature corresponding to the
[32:54] name
[32:55] so it's not just the appearance of life
[32:57] but it's real life
[32:59] talks about it how can you how can thy
[33:01] loving kindness be better than life and
[33:03] he touches on how there's a perverted
[33:05] life
[33:07] there's the appearance of life there's a
[33:08] Vitality that relates only to those
[33:10] things which is temporal but there's an
[33:12] actual existence that is greater than
[33:14] this one
[33:16] so when he says he's true he's contrast
[33:19] the appearance of what is real the
[33:21] appearance of reality God is reality and
[33:25] Truth
[33:26] brother Branham says in unfailing
[33:28] realities of God stay with God stay with
[33:30] realities God is a god of reality
[33:34] he says God is a god of reality just
[33:35] don't take a Creed don't take a
[33:37] sensation take a reality take a real God
[33:40] something that God is a god of reality
[33:43] that gives you assurance
[33:45] now it this again this is uh the world
[33:48] turned upside down because if you wanted
[33:52] um something of assurance you'd probably
[33:53] go by a sensation
[33:55] if you want to know that it's not
[33:57] raining outside maybe a good way to
[33:58] figure that out is to all right go
[34:01] outside and experience it and have your
[34:03] senses contacted and that would bring
[34:06] the reality that it's it's not raining
[34:08] but he's saying don't take a Creed don't
[34:10] take a sensation take a reality
[34:13] God is the god of reality and that
[34:15] reality gives you an assurance what is
[34:16] it gives you Faith it's assures
[34:19] so Jesus says he that sent me is reality
[34:23] I Come From Reality
[34:25] I come from that which is real true and
[34:27] genuine that which contrast your
[34:30] appearance and perception of reality
[34:33] in John chapter 14 verses 1 to 6
[34:36] let not your heart be troubled ye
[34:38] believe in God believe also in me
[34:42] in my father's house are many mansions
[34:47] this is actual existence God's thoughts
[34:49] are Eternal they are real
[34:54] that's not true of our thoughts we can
[34:56] have thoughts about things that will
[34:57] never come to actual existence but God's
[34:59] thoughts are at actual reality
[35:02] if it were not so
[35:04] I would not have told you I would have
[35:06] told you
[35:07] I go to prepare a place for you
[35:10] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[35:13] I will come again and receive you unto
[35:15] myself that where I am there ye may be
[35:19] also
[35:20] think of how he's trying to pull their
[35:22] minds
[35:23] into something Beyond themselves
[35:26] my father's house are many mansions many
[35:28] Tabernacles I go to prepare a place for
[35:31] you that where I am you may be also and
[35:33] then Thomas is drawn into this
[35:36] explanation exclamation Lord we know not
[35:38] whether thou goest and how can we know
[35:40] the way
[35:42] if you're going to a place we don't know
[35:44] where you're going how true that was
[35:46] we've never experienced it we don't know
[35:49] what this place is our reality is this
[35:51] is the promised land this is where God
[35:53] has placed us this is where we have the
[35:55] Feast of Tabernacles this is where we
[35:57] celebrate our feasts we return back to
[35:59] Jerusalem we have a lifestyle we have an
[36:01] order we have a system we have an
[36:03] existence we have promises we have
[36:04] Redemption we have jubilees we have
[36:06] restoration we have the promise of a
[36:08] messiah who'll come and restore us back
[36:10] to our own autonomy and individuality
[36:11] and freedom this is life what do you
[36:13] what do you mean you're going to go to a
[36:14] place and come back to take us there
[36:18] where is this place is this not the
[36:20] promised land is this not reality we
[36:22] don't know where you're going so how can
[36:24] we find the way Jesus said I am the way
[36:27] the truth the life
[36:30] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[36:33] you cannot come unto him which is true
[36:36] but by Christ
[36:37] you cannot see this reality except
[36:39] through Christ I am the way it's the
[36:42] course of life
[36:44] literally in the Greek the manner of
[36:46] thinking feeling and deciding I am the
[36:49] way of thinking feeling and deciding
[36:52] I am the truth that that which is really
[36:54] true in any matter under consideration
[36:58] I am the truth so in any situation find
[37:00] Christ that's what is true
[37:03] I am that which is really true in any
[37:05] matter under consideration
[37:07] I'm free from falsehood I I am in
[37:10] actuality
[37:11] I am the way the truth and the life the
[37:14] absolute fullness of life it's Zoe life
[37:16] real and genuine
[37:21] Christ says it of himself Revelations 3
[37:23] 7 I am he that is true
[37:26] he that is real I am the way the truth
[37:29] the life
[37:30] that's everything
[37:31] the way truth life that's existence
[37:35] that the way there is no going without
[37:37] the truth there is no no one without
[37:38] life there is no living this is this is
[37:40] life summed up in these three different
[37:42] aspects I am the way the truth in life
[37:45] if you want to come to the father this
[37:46] is how you get there
[37:50] Christ is he that is true
[37:54] brother Madam in the church age book
[37:55] writes now this word true
[37:57] is a very wonderful word
[38:00] it does not mean true in just the sense
[38:03] that it is opposite to false
[38:05] it expresses the perfect realization of
[38:08] an idea as contrasted with its partial
[38:12] realization
[38:14] so there can be some partial reality
[38:17] a partial truth
[38:19] and it's upon that basis that people can
[38:21] see things and believe
[38:23] it's upon that that we begin to say well
[38:25] this must be so and that must be so but
[38:28] to be true it's not just the opposite of
[38:31] what is false but it expresses a perfect
[38:33] realization of something
[38:36] as different from its partial
[38:38] realization
[38:40] human existence is a partial reality
[38:44] I think that's maybe just the the
[38:45] easiest amen
[38:48] right human existence is the part is a
[38:50] partial reality in the Lael descent
[38:52] Church age he writes recall that it does
[38:54] not mean true that you recall that it
[38:57] does not mean true as in contrast with
[39:00] false
[39:01] it has a richer deeper meaning by far
[39:05] we say something is true we just think
[39:08] oh well truth is different from false
[39:10] truth is you know is what's uh you know
[39:12] what is actual versus what is just an
[39:14] opinion or something without basis he
[39:16] says it's deeper than that
[39:18] it's a deeper meaning by far it
[39:19] expresses perfect realization in
[39:21] contrast to partial realization
[39:24] in the same way faith has a deeper and
[39:28] richer meaning
[39:31] it's more than just why you don't
[39:33] believe and you believe it's more than
[39:34] just doubt or faith it has a a deeper
[39:37] richer meaning it's not just well we
[39:39] think of Faith this is how we think of
[39:40] faith faith is knowledge uh based upon
[39:43] little or no evidence
[39:45] that's almost how we Define it faith is
[39:47] just what I believe absent any proof to
[39:49] the contrary
[39:51] and I'm not being dismissive of that but
[39:54] if we take Faith to be only knowledge
[39:57] and the absence of some proof faith is
[40:00] deeper than that
[40:03] faith is richer than that that's why
[40:05] people can believe for things that are
[40:07] not rooted in any reality whatsoever and
[40:10] then never see it
[40:11] because they've just limited the
[40:13] definition of faith to just believe
[40:14] something that has no actual existence
[40:16] well how do you know that I just believe
[40:17] it
[40:19] and you reduce Faith to that that mere
[40:21] human mechanism alone
[40:23] but faith is more than that
[40:25] Hebrews 11 1. now Faith is the substance
[40:30] of things hoped for
[40:32] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[40:37] things hoped for Things Not Seen
[40:40] but yet promised and guaranteed by God
[40:43] faith is the substance
[40:46] of those promises you hope for
[40:48] faith is the evidence of things
[40:51] guaranteed by God that you do not see of
[40:53] yet
[40:54] the definition you could have the
[40:56] substance and the Greek means has actual
[40:58] existence
[40:59] faith is the actual existence of things
[41:02] hoped for
[41:03] faith is the evidence that means the
[41:05] conviction of the reality of something
[41:09] so this is how faith when I'm using the
[41:12] word transcends you may be limited by
[41:15] your senses but faith is the is the
[41:19] substance it is the evidence
[41:22] Faith comprehends as a full reality what
[41:25] cannot be experienced by physical senses
[41:28] what I cannot say what I cannot touch
[41:30] what I cannot hear what I cannot imagine
[41:31] whatever is partial reality I I see it
[41:35] but I don't see it totally I feel it but
[41:37] I don't understand completely Faith
[41:39] comprehends as a full reality what your
[41:41] senses cannot grasp
[41:44] brother Branham writes it this way back
[41:46] in the Philadelphia Church age uh
[41:48] chapter 8 since this word expresses
[41:50] perfect realization as against the idea
[41:52] of partial realization as Illustrated in
[41:54] these verses we can Now understand as
[41:57] never before anti-type contrasted with
[42:00] type and substance with shadow
[42:03] so this life is a shadow
[42:05] this life is a negative
[42:07] so there there's something
[42:09] representative to it but there's another
[42:11] life that's the full development of it
[42:13] take the example now of Manna From
[42:15] Heaven God sent down Angel bread from
[42:17] heaven for Israel but that bread did not
[42:19] satisfy it was only good for a day those
[42:23] who ate it were hungry again the next
[42:24] day it was left around it became
[42:26] contaminated
[42:28] but Jesus is the true bread from heaven
[42:32] factual in John chapter 6 they said our
[42:35] fathers ate man in the wilderness and
[42:37] Moses gave us this bread and Jesus said
[42:39] well as a matter of fact he did
[42:41] right
[42:43] God did as a matter of fact give you
[42:45] bread from heaven but I am the true
[42:47] Bread of Heaven
[42:49] yeah there's some re that's rooted in
[42:51] some reality that's based upon some
[42:53] history some actual existence but but I
[42:55] am in the true Bread of Heaven whereof
[42:58] Manna was just a type
[43:00] and if any man me if any man eats of
[43:03] that bread that came from Heaven he will
[43:05] never hunger again
[43:07] he does not need to come back and eat
[43:08] again
[43:10] the moment he partook he had eternal
[43:13] life
[43:14] here indeed was reality
[43:19] no no need any longer for a shadow
[43:22] this is referring even to the law then
[43:24] no need for partial salvation
[43:27] one that you could have a blood Covenant
[43:29] until the next year the next offering no
[43:31] need for partial salvation here is the
[43:34] whole of it
[43:35] just like Jesus is a part of God he is
[43:37] God
[43:39] it's the perfect realization
[43:42] there can be partial
[43:43] but he's saying this is the true what is
[43:45] true
[43:47] in second Corinthians chapter 5 verses
[43:49] 15 16 and 17.
[43:52] speaking of Christ Christ is
[43:56] a life that I now live I live by the
[43:58] faith of the son of God
[44:00] the Faith of Christ
[44:02] is is something that Christ has brought
[44:05] to us
[44:06] if I could even say this
[44:08] it may have been typed before
[44:11] but never actual existence until he came
[44:15] there may be a shadow of it maybe in
[44:17] types of even in Joseph a perfect shadow
[44:20] but not the reality of it
[44:22] it even
[44:26] it even memorializes and honors the
[44:29] faith that the uh the the forefathers
[44:32] had the faith of Moses the faith of job
[44:34] the faith of the of those who were
[44:36] believed before Christ came
[44:39] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 15
[44:40] and speaking of Christ and that he died
[44:43] for all that they which live
[44:45] shouldn't not henceforth live unto
[44:48] themselves
[44:50] he died that we who are still living no
[44:53] longer exist within a subjective reality
[44:55] but unto him which died for them and
[44:58] rose again
[45:00] we don't live just one dimensionally we
[45:03] don't live just egotistically we live
[45:05] unto Christ wherefore henceforth know we
[45:09] know man after the flesh
[45:11] yea though we may have we have known
[45:14] Christ after the flesh yet now
[45:16] henceforth no we know we him no more
[45:20] you may have known him
[45:22] by physical sight you may known him by
[45:25] personal interaction in this flesh but
[45:28] now you don't know him that way anymore
[45:30] you know him by Revelation you know him
[45:32] by faith and he says now we know no man
[45:35] after the flesh now our knowledge this
[45:38] is this is the part to me that just
[45:40] starts this domino effect he's wanting
[45:42] to shake us a little bit to say now
[45:44] you've got to view things differently
[45:47] for now we don't know other people the
[45:50] same way that we did when we lived unto
[45:53] ourselves but now that faith has been
[45:55] instigated we have a different vantage
[45:57] point
[45:58] therefore If any man be in Christ
[46:02] he is a new creature
[46:05] this this uh my understanding of this
[46:08] scripture has just blossomed over this
[46:09] past week if any man be in Christ he is
[46:13] a new creature old things are passed
[46:15] away behold all things are become new
[46:19] there's there's when you say old things
[46:22] are passed away all things have become
[46:24] new I know we can wrestle with this
[46:25] because we say well if I'm truly born
[46:27] again why did I struggle with this and
[46:29] why did this happen how come everything
[46:30] isn't completely revolutionized but a
[46:32] new creation implies a new existence
[46:37] it's not as as Nicodemus wrestled with
[46:40] it so how do I how do I come back into
[46:42] this world again no Jesus is talking
[46:44] about Paul tomorrow if any man be in
[46:46] Christ by one Spirit you're baptized
[46:47] into this Mystic Body of Christ
[46:50] and and when if that has happened you
[46:53] are a new creation
[46:55] the way things were
[46:58] is now turned upside down
[47:01] all things are become new because now
[47:04] you should not live unto yourself and
[47:07] you should not view others the same way
[47:09] you should have a complete different
[47:12] reality all things are passed away the
[47:15] present order can never be the same
[47:19] blessed me so much because the way you
[47:22] say all things are become new
[47:24] it it's not that everything has
[47:26] disappeared all trials are gone all
[47:28] Temptations are gone but you know it if
[47:31] you've ever been born again you always
[47:33] see it differently from that moment on
[47:35] but every all things have become new
[47:37] because I've been baptized into Christ
[47:40] the present order things can never be
[47:43] the way that it was before
[47:48] it's exposed as partial
[47:52] it's exposed as temporary
[47:55] it's exposed as being not expedient it's
[47:58] exposed as being Earthly it's exposed as
[48:01] being corruptive I can never I can never
[48:04] see it the same way again do I make
[48:06] mistakes yes but all things have become
[48:09] new I can't justify that I can't make
[48:12] excuses for that my whole view has
[48:14] changed
[48:16] that's what it means when All Things
[48:17] become new I'm out of my old way of
[48:19] thinking my old way of viewing my whole
[48:22] course of life has been upended
[48:24] [Music]
[48:26] that's what Jesus meant when he said in
[48:28] John 3 3 verily verily I said to thee
[48:31] except a man be born again what from
[48:34] above
[48:36] above not from Below
[48:38] you are from beneath you are of This
[48:40] World by the birth you had in this world
[48:43] but to be born again from above now
[48:45] causes you to come to exist
[48:48] in a different reality
[48:50] the body's still here but something's
[48:53] been birthed in a different reality
[48:55] when brother Brown preaches future home
[48:58] your Soul's already there
[49:00] you can just take future home and read
[49:02] through and be like Soul Eighth Day
[49:03] Already There Brother Branham is almost
[49:06] even skipping the millennium
[49:08] it's so certain and so sure Soul's
[49:10] already there Soul's already there it's
[49:12] just gonna take a million for your for
[49:13] everything to catch up to where your
[49:15] Soul's at
[49:18] Born Again from above if except unless a
[49:21] man be born again from heaven
[49:24] he cannot see
[49:27] the kingdom of God
[49:28] what does that understand
[49:31] unless you're born again
[49:33] you're only ever observing
[49:38] in this realm unless you're born again
[49:40] you can only see the external appearance
[49:43] of the kingdom of God
[49:45] as it's manifested by those who are
[49:48] existing in another reality
[49:51] because the new birth it brings a new
[49:54] existence it brings a new reality it's
[49:57] supernatural
[49:59] extra rational
[50:01] it's the true Uber it's beyond
[50:07] to be born again is not to I kind of
[50:09] have a change in mind Born Again In this
[50:11] present world as a convert to a religion
[50:13] uh it's changing my pattern of behavior
[50:15] to a new discipline or a new way of
[50:17] thinking
[50:18] if that's so every time we went from
[50:20] keto to carnivore diet to this and to
[50:23] that and from vegan to gluten-free to
[50:26] the pescetarian to vegetarian that would
[50:29] all be births
[50:32] right
[50:33] I've been born again 817 times
[50:36] because that's that's all the times I've
[50:38] changed my my discipline of eating it's
[50:40] all the times I changed my thought
[50:41] process that's all the times I changed
[50:43] my opinion
[50:45] but to be born again is different than
[50:46] that
[50:48] to be born again is to be birthed into
[50:51] another dimension of living
[50:53] another dimension of reality what is the
[50:56] New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ
[50:59] personally to you
[51:02] so there is now a subjective reality
[51:05] that is beyond that is beyond the
[51:08] reality presented by your mental
[51:10] thinking beyond the senses of
[51:12] imagination conscience memory reason and
[51:13] affection beyond what you feel beyond
[51:16] what you see beyond what you taste
[51:17] beyond what you hear the revelation of
[51:20] Jesus Christ personally to you
[51:22] [Applause]
[51:23] it's a complete different reality
[51:26] in Ephesians chapter 3 verse verses 14
[51:28] to 19.
[51:31] oh what beautiful prayer for this cause
[51:33] I bow my needs into the father of our
[51:35] Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[51:37] family in Heaven and Earth is named
[51:40] there's the reality the family of Heaven
[51:43] with this with this manifestation on
[51:46] Earth that he would Grant you according
[51:49] to the riches of his glory to be
[51:51] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[51:54] the Inner Man
[51:56] that Soul person
[51:58] where you really exist the real you
[52:00] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[52:04] faith
[52:06] no I can almost see this as a filling up
[52:09] this this strengthened by his spirit
[52:12] that Christ may not dwell in your hearts
[52:15] by faith
[52:17] that ye been rooted and grounded in love
[52:20] may be able to comprehend
[52:23] with All Saints
[52:26] this is the prayer so this is Paul's
[52:28] prayer to the Ephesian Church Born Again
[52:30] filled with the Holy Spirit
[52:32] that there could be a dwelling of Christ
[52:34] and by faith with this foundation with
[52:36] this root that they're going to be able
[52:38] to comprehend with All Saints
[52:42] so that now my subjective reality
[52:44] according to the faith and by this new
[52:46] birth experience begins to become common
[52:49] with all other Saints and we comprehend
[52:52] we grasp we come to know what is the
[52:55] breadth and length and depth and height
[52:59] I want to come back to that and to know
[53:02] the love of Christ which passeth
[53:04] knowledge
[53:06] to know the love of Christ to have a
[53:08] knowledge of the love of Christ that
[53:09] passes knowledge
[53:11] which you talk about something higher a
[53:12] higher knowledge higher wisdom higher
[53:14] Revelation higher understanding not
[53:16] carnal which passeth knowledge that ye
[53:18] might be filled with all the fullness of
[53:21] God
[53:23] that whatever partial reality still has
[53:27] preeminence
[53:28] would be completely assumed by the
[53:30] perfect reality
[53:34] and when he says the breadth the length
[53:36] depth and height
[53:38] everything that is tangible to us
[53:41] exist in three dimensions
[53:43] height length width
[53:46] you can touch it
[53:48] that it exists within those three
[53:49] dimensions
[53:51] in physics there's three spatial
[53:52] dimensions
[53:54] you can only move up right or forward
[53:59] you say no no that's not true you can
[54:02] only move up
[54:03] right or forward
[54:06] to go to the left is the negative of
[54:08] going right it's the same plane it's the
[54:10] same Dimension to go down is just the
[54:12] negative of going up to go back is just
[54:14] the opposite of going forward you can
[54:16] only move three different ways within
[54:17] life within within the dimensions we
[54:20] live in and I want to save it for
[54:21] another time brother I'm talking about
[54:22] how we live in light time and matter
[54:25] so Paul says that we may comprehend with
[54:27] All Saints
[54:29] what is the breadth
[54:31] and length
[54:33] and depth and height
[54:36] this is a language that would be used to
[54:39] describe the elements of human existence
[54:42] what is forward what is to the left to
[54:44] the right up and down this is this kind
[54:46] of describing anything that has tangible
[54:48] reality this exists three-dimensionally
[54:51] all right you look at us well this is
[54:52] this is a three-dimensional object let
[54:54] me experience it
[54:59] and then he says the breath it's the
[55:01] extent of it
[55:03] so it's not creating in this in this way
[55:06] it's not necessarily creating a fourth
[55:08] dimension
[55:09] but when Paul uses this language height
[55:12] depth and length
[55:14] when he mentions that it's a language
[55:16] that would describe our present reality
[55:18] but he's not referring to Natural Life
[55:21] he's not saying that we would come to
[55:22] comprehend better spatial existence
[55:25] I unfortunately he's not praying that
[55:27] we'd get a good grade in physics
[55:30] but he says that we may comprehend with
[55:31] All Saints the breadth the extent of the
[55:35] length and depth and height of what
[55:37] Christ
[55:39] he desires that we would know he's
[55:41] described in the reality of God In terms
[55:44] that so we could relate that just as
[55:46] much as things here are real because as
[55:49] spatial tangible existence there is a
[55:51] reality of Christ that has height and
[55:54] depth and length and breath there's a
[55:56] reality that you can comprehend
[55:58] you can grab a hold of this desk you can
[56:01] recognize this scene you can experience
[56:03] Dimensions moving up and down left and
[56:05] right backwards and forwards in this
[56:07] life says that you may comprehend in not
[56:10] just you but everybody else
[56:13] that reality in God
[56:17] faith is a mental is is a mental state
[56:21] Beyond human reason
[56:24] faith is a state of mind Beyond human
[56:27] rationale
[56:28] so it's a new reality Now using this
[56:31] phrase that transcends your natural
[56:33] existence
[56:35] money
[56:37] in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 6
[56:40] what does he say based upon this
[56:43] reality
[56:44] and hath raised us up together in a
[56:47] place that by God's grace being rooted
[56:49] and grounded up we may grow to
[56:51] comprehend together was the breath
[56:53] length and depth and height we're
[56:54] sitting in heaven places in Christ Jesus
[56:56] and Paul's like oh if you could just see
[56:57] the depth of it
[56:59] if you could see the height see the
[57:00] length you could see the breath
[57:02] this is where you are but it's not a
[57:05] full reality like it should be
[57:07] this is the absolute truth he's raised
[57:10] you up by the new birth you're raised up
[57:12] together and has made us to sit together
[57:14] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[57:19] think of Faith then as being
[57:22] a a state of being think of Faith as an
[57:25] existence that is tied or connected with
[57:27] the perfect existence
[57:29] you have been raised up
[57:30] seated together in Heavenly places in
[57:32] Christ Jesus now this this little
[57:35] building
[57:36] uh and the cramped space that we have
[57:38] here and this low ceiling it makes me
[57:41] look really tall fortunately
[57:43] but maybe it doesn't at all maybe just
[57:45] emphasize just how short I am when
[57:47] brother Phillip just stood here and like
[57:49] wow that's a really low sale and I get
[57:50] up you're like he's short
[57:52] but this the reality is we're seated in
[57:54] heavy places
[57:57] and that that reality has to Dawn
[57:58] greater
[58:00] because that's that's that this is a
[58:02] faith connected with the perfect
[58:03] existence brother Brown said no greater
[58:05] than Solomon is here we're sitting in
[58:06] heavy places in the presence of Christ
[58:08] lifted above the cares of the world into
[58:11] a realm of Faith the kingdom a domain of
[58:15] Life a realm of faith
[58:19] seated together in Heavenly places a
[58:21] realm of Faith that's where we live
[58:24] in him we live and move and have our
[58:27] existence in him
[58:29] Ephesians 4 13 what is what are all the
[58:32] gifts that are given to men what are all
[58:33] what's all the preaching for what what
[58:35] are all the what's it to do till we all
[58:37] come into the unity of the faith
[58:41] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[58:42] and unto a perfect man unto the measure
[58:45] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[58:48] what is all the preaching of the word in
[58:50] settings like this what is what is it
[58:52] all for that we could come into the
[58:53] unity of the faith that we may be able
[58:55] to comprehend with All Saints
[58:57] the unity of the faith
[59:00] the word has to be preached
[59:02] until our realities are entirely unified
[59:05] in the reality of Christ
[59:07] this reality has to be unified in Christ
[59:15] raised up is a realm Heavenly places the
[59:17] realm of faith
[59:19] in Galatians chapter 3 verse 23.
[59:24] but before Faith came
[59:26] we are kept under the law
[59:29] this is such a reality to Paul before
[59:31] Faith came we were kept under the law
[59:33] shut up under the faith which should
[59:34] afterwards be revealed
[59:36] Christ is the author and finisher of
[59:38] this faith
[59:40] Christ introduced the faith to the
[59:42] Christian Church Christine when they
[59:44] introduces this Transcendent Faith it's
[59:45] it's different than even what the Jews
[59:48] were expecting
[59:50] so at this in this language Christ they
[59:53] were under the law and the law had a
[59:55] certain order in a certain system and it
[59:57] was there they were shut up unto
[1:00:00] until the faith which which should be
[1:00:02] revealed later
[1:00:04] Christ revealed the faith
[1:00:07] kept under a reality until a new reality
[1:00:11] is revealed by Christ shut up unto kept
[1:00:14] under held in prison under the bondage
[1:00:16] of it until Faith which was later
[1:00:19] revealed
[1:00:23] I I want to I want to finish my thought
[1:00:25] here
[1:00:28] if it I may just want to speak in
[1:00:31] general terms so I could go take this a
[1:00:32] step further
[1:00:34] I I will just I'll just allude to it
[1:00:36] faith is a complete revolution of our
[1:00:38] character
[1:00:40] because once
[1:00:43] you know no man we don't live unto
[1:00:45] ourselves and we know no man after the
[1:00:48] flesh something's taken place where your
[1:00:51] entire existence shifts
[1:00:54] even as it relates to yourself
[1:00:57] to your neighbor to the world
[1:01:00] that's that's what faith is there's an
[1:01:02] idea that faith is a discipline you're a
[1:01:05] Christian by your faith and and there's
[1:01:07] some it's some sort of just something
[1:01:08] that's an additive to the human
[1:01:10] existence but genuine faith is a
[1:01:12] revolution of your character how you
[1:01:14] perceive yourself how you view your
[1:01:15] neighbor how you view the world
[1:01:18] faith is power to live above the world
[1:01:21] so faith is
[1:01:22] it is to sense and to know and to act in
[1:01:28] terms of a supernatural reality
[1:01:30] that's what faith is I sense I know I
[1:01:34] act under the law and the rule of a
[1:01:38] different reality
[1:01:39] I sense according to the laws of a
[1:01:41] different Kingdom I act according to the
[1:01:44] laws of a different Kingdom I know
[1:01:46] according to the laws of a different
[1:01:47] Kingdom the humanity can see things one
[1:01:50] way and that can be a subjective reality
[1:01:52] or it could in fact be an objective
[1:01:54] reality but you're on the other side
[1:01:56] looking at it so that you can sense it
[1:01:58] know it and respond to it differently
[1:02:01] than any unborn again person can
[1:02:04] at least you ought to
[1:02:06] and that's what Revelation does
[1:02:08] revelation does what it uncovers what
[1:02:10] previously had been hidden
[1:02:12] here you've lived in this world your
[1:02:13] whole life interacting with things but
[1:02:15] whenever Revelation comes all of a
[1:02:17] sudden you see even your whole life
[1:02:19] differently
[1:02:20] did it not happen to you
[1:02:22] you lived and in the moment that this
[1:02:24] word became a living reality you even
[1:02:26] begin to see what you experienced before
[1:02:29] differently like wow how did I ever miss
[1:02:32] it
[1:02:33] how did I never see it why because it's
[1:02:35] uncovered what you did not sense are no
[1:02:38] humanly before that's what Revelation
[1:02:41] does
[1:02:43] revelation
[1:02:44] is the complete turning upside down the
[1:02:47] complete upheaval of human thought
[1:02:52] that's a state of mind behind Beyond
[1:02:54] carnal carnal reason
[1:02:57] so when I use the subtitle ecstasy
[1:03:01] it's a scriptural word
[1:03:05] literally means in the Greek a
[1:03:07] displacement
[1:03:09] so you have you have in existence
[1:03:12] and you have an experience they have
[1:03:13] emotions but an ecstasy is a
[1:03:15] displacement a state in which normal
[1:03:17] functions are superseded
[1:03:20] and actually as it drives out senses but
[1:03:23] Paul uses the word whether I be beside
[1:03:25] myself
[1:03:26] so you have yourself and then you're
[1:03:27] beside yourself
[1:03:29] you have your existence but then this
[1:03:32] ecstasy is a displacement of existence
[1:03:35] extasis is the Greek it means
[1:03:36] entrancement astonishment removal from
[1:03:39] proper place
[1:03:41] and one way it's referred to as an
[1:03:43] insanity because it's something that's
[1:03:44] beyond rational
[1:03:46] so there's a use of it that can explain
[1:03:48] maybe a behavior that is sub-human but
[1:03:50] an ecstasy is a displacement
[1:03:53] and when in Revelations chapter 1 verse
[1:03:56] 10 as he could kind of breathe breathe a
[1:03:58] sigh of relief I've made it to my text
[1:03:59] that means at least I'm there now
[1:04:03] says I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:04:05] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[1:04:08] of a trumpet I am Alpha and Omega first
[1:04:10] and last
[1:04:13] I was in the spirit
[1:04:16] I was in a state of ecstasy
[1:04:19] I had been influenced the the influences
[1:04:22] of the outer realm what I see what I
[1:04:24] taste what I see what I smell all these
[1:04:26] senses that declared this Natural Life
[1:04:28] have now been diminished
[1:04:31] and I'm now in a realm that's beyond
[1:04:34] what I see I'm not just on the Isle of
[1:04:37] Patmos I'm not just having a human
[1:04:39] experience but now I have I am in the
[1:04:42] spirit and the influences and the
[1:04:44] perceptions that contact the outer realm
[1:04:47] have now been diminished and it's in
[1:04:49] that state that he caught the revelation
[1:04:51] of Jesus Christ
[1:04:53] I was in the spirit I was in an ecstasy
[1:04:55] brother random says I was in the spirit
[1:04:57] isn't that just beautiful my I love that
[1:05:00] you could just call those words the
[1:05:03] whole of the Christian Life
[1:05:06] I was in the spirit is the Hall of the
[1:05:10] Christian Life the Christian faith the
[1:05:12] Christian Life is a displacement of
[1:05:15] natural life
[1:05:16] I was in the spirit he said the whole of
[1:05:19] the Christian Life the whole of the
[1:05:21] Christian faith is an ecstasy
[1:05:24] it's the subjection of the natural to
[1:05:27] the supernatural
[1:05:29] it's a displacement I don't know I don't
[1:05:31] just live here anymore
[1:05:33] this isn't this is not this is not where
[1:05:35] I live
[1:05:36] this world is not my home in that I'm
[1:05:39] only contacting my Earthly home through
[1:05:41] these certain senses there's now another
[1:05:43] sense
[1:05:47] faith is an Awakening of The Sixth Sense
[1:05:50] to contact and live in another dimension
[1:05:54] the displacement ecstasy is to be
[1:05:55] carried away
[1:05:57] what it what is rational what is normal
[1:05:59] and I know that it may seem to be a
[1:06:01] little bit of a shocking
[1:06:03] a a shock to use that word and I'm sure
[1:06:05] some people are trying to come up with a
[1:06:06] lot of drug puns for me later
[1:06:08] but it's a it has a basis in the
[1:06:11] scripture because we're confined by
[1:06:13] light time and matter in a language to
[1:06:15] try to describe something that's beyond
[1:06:17] language
[1:06:19] and so anything that has a language
[1:06:20] anything that could be used in human
[1:06:22] language can have the opposite effect
[1:06:25] that there's a there's a way that we use
[1:06:27] language it doesn't make sense anymore
[1:06:29] literal is figurative now
[1:06:31] that in this sense that there's a this
[1:06:33] ecstasy is you now have been transported
[1:06:39] there's a there's something you're
[1:06:41] experiencing something beyond what is
[1:06:43] normal
[1:06:44] the human existence
[1:06:46] billabam talks about that word coming to
[1:06:48] you says quickly you're raptured up to
[1:06:50] meet it and now you're setting in
[1:06:51] Heavenly places in Christ
[1:06:54] what's happened you've been carried away
[1:06:56] you've been raised up seated in Heavenly
[1:06:59] places this is what faith is I was in
[1:07:01] the spirit you're carried away
[1:07:04] and I was in ecstasy
[1:07:06] and when that happens you're a Mystic to
[1:07:08] the rest of the world it stuck down here
[1:07:09] in this realm
[1:07:12] the very word rapture you can't find
[1:07:14] Rapture in the scripture as far as a
[1:07:16] translation of a word but it's the act
[1:07:18] of carrying off
[1:07:19] forever said you're quickly your rap
[1:07:21] up to meet it harpazzo in the New
[1:07:23] Testament means to catch away first
[1:07:25] Thessalonians caught up together
[1:07:28] it's a catch in a way
[1:07:29] what is it it's a rapture
[1:07:32] it's a Rapture it's rapturous
[1:07:35] it's a it's a feeling of being uh of the
[1:07:37] static static
[1:07:39] it's I'm being lifted up I've been
[1:07:41] raised them up with my feelings I I had
[1:07:44] pain I feel sick I feel like I'm dying I
[1:07:48] have a headache I have I'm not sure
[1:07:50] what's gonna happen Revelation comes
[1:07:52] what happens you're raised above that
[1:07:54] I I I believe I feel better I'm gonna
[1:07:58] get well there's a that's why I have
[1:07:59] your elevated the natural above the
[1:08:01] natural realm oh my it takes the phrase
[1:08:04] rapturing faith and gives it a much
[1:08:05] deeper more personal and practical
[1:08:08] meaning in this light of what faith is
[1:08:11] to be transported brother Brown says in
[1:08:13] the message Rapture but to the church
[1:08:14] the bride the Rapture is a revelation to
[1:08:17] her
[1:08:19] it's revealed to her
[1:08:21] the catching away the displacement
[1:08:25] he says the Rapture is a revelation the
[1:08:27] true bread of Christ will be waiting for
[1:08:29] the revelation of the rapture now it is
[1:08:32] a revelation for the Revelation is faith
[1:08:34] cannot have a revelation without it
[1:08:36] being faith faith is a revelation
[1:08:38] because it's something that's revealed
[1:08:40] to you
[1:08:41] faith is a revelation
[1:08:43] faith is something that's been revealed
[1:08:44] to you like it was to Abraham that could
[1:08:46] call anything contrary to what had been
[1:08:48] revealed to him as though it wasn't
[1:08:53] that's actual existence it's been
[1:08:56] revealed to me anything that would
[1:08:58] declare it otherwise
[1:09:00] you could say it's contrary because you
[1:09:03] have a reality that contrasts it
[1:09:06] that's what faith is
[1:09:07] now Faith that's what faith is is the
[1:09:10] revelation of God
[1:09:13] once Christ has been revealed to you
[1:09:16] once God is revealed to you that
[1:09:18] Supernatural that supernaturality
[1:09:20] becomes a matter of faith
[1:09:24] that's what that's that's exactly what
[1:09:25] happens and it's just as real to you as
[1:09:28] somebody else who experiences this life
[1:09:31] to their senses they contact natural
[1:09:34] things and to be born again is now to be
[1:09:38] introduced to a god who's the god of
[1:09:40] reality and then it becomes a matter of
[1:09:43] faith
[1:09:47] brother Branham says in the sermon he
[1:09:49] cares to you
[1:09:55] this this is um
[1:09:59] I'm gonna I'm gonna go very quickly and
[1:10:00] just wrap this up so there's going to be
[1:10:03] some things that you're just going to be
[1:10:04] left to uh
[1:10:06] keep holding your heart and consider
[1:10:09] I think I'm just speaking to what you
[1:10:11] already know anyways but he says when
[1:10:12] you find God's ultimate
[1:10:14] faith is a revelation of God when you
[1:10:16] find God's ultimate his word
[1:10:18] a promise Upon A Certain thing you must
[1:10:20] know first that it is God's word
[1:10:23] that the thing that you're seeing being
[1:10:24] done is God there's no maybe so it could
[1:10:28] be it looks like it might be it is God
[1:10:31] then when you get to that spot then
[1:10:33] that's the pearl of great prize
[1:10:38] you must get away from everything that
[1:10:40] anybody else tells you contrary to it
[1:10:43] you must not look to what man has
[1:10:45] achieved you must look to what God has
[1:10:48] said and what he promised and see him to
[1:10:50] do it
[1:10:51] so you have the achievements of man that
[1:10:53] can only exist within the the dimensions
[1:10:56] the spatial dimensions
[1:10:58] of physics and in this reality but then
[1:11:01] you look to what God has promised he
[1:11:02] says then that's your ultimate right
[1:11:05] there
[1:11:07] catch that that's the ultimate and
[1:11:09] everything that you are
[1:11:11] everything that you were or was
[1:11:14] everything that you hope to be must be
[1:11:17] placed upon this just as those death and
[1:11:21] life to you at that moment
[1:11:25] wow
[1:11:27] in that when that that ultimate this is
[1:11:31] how he's describing this ultimate
[1:11:33] everything you are everything you were
[1:11:35] everything you will be
[1:11:38] is based upon that word
[1:11:40] it's based upon as though it's death and
[1:11:43] life to you at that moment
[1:11:48] when you look at it in this sense like
[1:11:50] the idea of desperation that's your
[1:11:53] ultimate
[1:11:54] faith is connected
[1:11:57] with what one perceives to be the
[1:11:58] greatest need
[1:12:00] faith is connected with what one
[1:12:02] perceives to be the ultimate priority
[1:12:06] when you see that that's your ultimate
[1:12:09] ultimate what the ultimate priority
[1:12:12] the ultimate need the ultimate thing
[1:12:14] it's the absolute
[1:12:16] why is it the absolute because
[1:12:18] everything I was everything I am and
[1:12:20] everything I will be is based upon that
[1:12:24] that's what brother Brown's trying to
[1:12:25] get us to understand in the in the
[1:12:26] sermon the absolute
[1:12:29] that the word must be your absolute
[1:12:32] it is your ultimate
[1:12:36] everything that you were everything you
[1:12:38] are everything you would be Carly would
[1:12:41] be based upon one's subjective reality
[1:12:44] it'd be based upon what you agree to be
[1:12:46] an objective reality what I was maybe
[1:12:48] that could be objectively verified what
[1:12:51] I am maybe that's my subjective reality
[1:12:53] what I will be well it's all going to be
[1:12:55] based upon the Confluence of these
[1:12:57] things whatever it has been and what I
[1:12:58] am is working to make what I am but
[1:13:00] brother I'm suggesting something
[1:13:01] completely different
[1:13:03] he said faith is not a hope so or it
[1:13:05] could be right it's got to be absolutely
[1:13:07] amen it's your ultimate it's your
[1:13:11] absolute it's the thing that you're tied
[1:13:14] to
[1:13:15] what is Faith then it is your reality
[1:13:19] genuine faith is when you make God's
[1:13:21] word you're absolute
[1:13:24] that's when you say this is my ultimate
[1:13:26] concern faith is what I believe to be
[1:13:28] the absolute faith is what I believe to
[1:13:30] be the the ultimate
[1:13:32] faith is the ultimate meaning of life
[1:13:34] Faith is the ultimate need faith is the
[1:13:36] ultimate concern that's what faith is
[1:13:38] and if it really is Faith it changes the
[1:13:40] way I act
[1:13:42] you can always tell what someone
[1:13:43] believes to be when someone has a faith
[1:13:46] and it's real Faith well genuine human
[1:13:48] belief and conviction and this one they
[1:13:50] they act as if everything matters and
[1:13:52] everything depends upon it why are you
[1:13:54] worried about that why are you doing
[1:13:55] that they're convinced about it
[1:13:58] and that's what an ultimate is Faith is
[1:13:59] you're absolute it's the thing you're
[1:14:01] tied to it's everything
[1:14:04] it's your reality
[1:14:06] faith is when you make God's word you're
[1:14:08] absolute
[1:14:09] what is the word
[1:14:11] it's God's subjective reality
[1:14:14] the word is the way God sees things
[1:14:16] right the word is the One Singular
[1:14:19] Viewpoint of everything God's viewpoint
[1:14:23] amen and it's the real viewpoint
[1:14:26] musicians please come
[1:14:29] brother Brian said in that in the
[1:14:30] message in absolute a absolute and
[1:14:33] that's the mat what's the matter in the
[1:14:34] Christian faith today
[1:14:36] we got too many traffic jams
[1:14:39] everybody making their own absolute
[1:14:41] right all the people in the in the
[1:14:43] Crossway showing a bad trying to direct
[1:14:45] traffic everybody trying to be an
[1:14:47] absolute he says when you've got one
[1:14:49] absolute and that's the word of the
[1:14:51] Living God that settles it forever
[1:14:53] no matter what anybody else says
[1:14:56] it's almost got into a place like it was
[1:14:58] in the day of Judges everybody has their
[1:15:01] own absolute but it all fails like the
[1:15:04] Pharaohs and so forth but God's absolute
[1:15:07] is his word
[1:15:10] that's the ultimate
[1:15:12] that's what faith is
[1:15:15] that that that word of God that reality
[1:15:18] and so Faith then is to live to be
[1:15:21] carried away
[1:15:22] into that ecstatic Realm
[1:15:25] and that's where we want to live
[1:15:27] don't you want to live there all the
[1:15:28] time
[1:15:29] don't you want to stay there
[1:15:31] that's what this word is all about
[1:15:33] that's what the renewing of the mind is
[1:15:35] all about that's what the pressing
[1:15:36] forward is all about that's what all the
[1:15:37] Supernatural is all about calling you
[1:15:39] into that place of perfect existence
[1:15:41] God bless you let's stand
