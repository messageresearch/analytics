TRANSCRIPT
========================================
reading there in Exodus chapter 12 it's really a remarkable occurrence and then as you continue to read it says that it came to pass at midnight that the Lord did Smite the firstborn the land of Egypt and in the house of pharaoh and so these very things that were spoken of are coming to pass and transpiring just exactly as the Lord said it would and I want to draw from that and you'll catch this just earlier in the chapter I want to draw from that a title a priest for a home a PRI for a home as we're been speaking on the house of the Lord and talking about the man of the home for a couple services and building up uh the man's role in the house of the Lord which your home should be a home that's dedicated to the Lord and if you look at Ephesians chapter 5 I just want to review just a few things from last Sunday uh Paul identifies the man's headship within the family as that which is like Christ to his body so that's a the most extraordinary um example that he could give us it's the highest example and so that kind of should catch our attentions that if the man is to be the head he's to be the head as Christ is to the church and Paul says it this way for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body that savior the deliverer the preserver he's the one who keeps safe and sound and he's the one that makes well so it's a real active role to be the head to be the head is doesn't mean the body supports you and the body lifts you up and the body serves the head rather the head is the lifegiver it is the one that makes well and keeps safe and sound and he says as Christ even as Christ it's a phrase that he uses a few times it gives that man a place in the family which is like the role of Jesus to the church a and that that should get our attentions as I'm wanting to emphasize over and over should cause us to think wow this this role as a head this role as a man as a husband as a father is very uh uh very sobering very serious and we've seen how brother random teaches us that scripturally the head of the wife and the head of the family is not a dictator but he is a servant and he's one he's a giver the scripture says he's a sanctifier he's a nourisher these are the things he's a washer he's a cleanser this is what the head does and we saw this example in Jesus in John Chapter 13 veres 4 and 5 there in this communion Scene It says he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself that he pth water into a base and begin to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was GED and when he has accomplished this he instructs the disciples to do this to one to another and happy are you if he do these things and he's teaching them that you say that I your lord and I'm your master and I'm your teacher and he says you say well cuz I am but as I have kneeled before you and washed your feet and Peter even instinctively said whoa what would you be doing washing my feet I I should be washing your feet uh he instructs them to do the same thing and he and he teaches him to be servants and to be minded uh just as the son of man came to serve not to be served we should have the same kind of mind to give service and to serve and to give of ourselves and and this is that roll of a head within a family he knelt to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them he humbled himself to those that he was uh teaching and those he was leading and those he was guiding and that's an important characteristic for any husband and father for any man is the ability to get beneath somebody else uh to Humble themselves and be willing to be a servant uh we've seen even it's emphasized in some of the ministers that come through and ministered how that uh uh brother brandham uh took upon that role even within his own home to put on the apron and start to do dishes and just approach the atmosphere differently approach the scene differently than just saying well bless God I'm going to take control here and so it's important just to recognize those attributes of a real a servant a real head and we were reading I think this might have been some of the last things we read in John chap 17: 171 18 and 19 Jesus praying says sanctify them through thy truth now these disciples whose feet he washed and who he served and taught and led he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth then he says as thou Hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world now it's important to kind of connect those two verses together because in John chapter 10 believe it's verse 36 he says say ye of the one whom the father hath Sanctified and sent into the world so he's saying of his own self that the father Sanctified him before he sent him into the world and that's the role of a father you have an opportunity with your children you have an opportunity before they leave the home to sanctify them before they're sent out so now he's doing the same thing with his disciples he's saying sanctify them just as you've Sanctified me and sent me into the world sanctify them and he says and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth this is that example of a real a real head who is a giver and a sanctifier of the body uh the sanctifier of a wife and family this is a perfect example of that he says I sanctify myself that they might be Sanctified through the truth very clearly he's saiding he could say you sanctify them Lord and and have them to be Sanctified and and have this image and this idea that those that you're leading and teaching and he need to be Sanctified but he recognized that if I'm not Sanctified myself they can't be Sanctified so he's willing to kind of own it himself and brother Bram says he was training 12 men that were going to take the gospel to all the world so he Sanctified himself for their sake I sanctify myself for their sake a gift of God keeping himself Sanctified and and just keying in on that language he was training 12 men that were going to take the gospel to the world and so because he was training someone else to do more to do greater to go out into all the world and to preach the gospel because they were to take the message and further it he Sanctified himself so that they could be Sanctified because he was training them and brother Bram says youth men and women for tomorrow if there is a tomorrow we must train them Lord he says we feel that burden to train them like there will be a tomorrow and so we we ought to be forward looking thinking that that uh there will be a tomorrow and if there is a tomorrow we want to have leaders and we want to have husbands and wives and we want to have those that can step into these scriptural roles and Lead appropriately so we feel a burden to train as if there will be a tomorrow and if we're going to be training we ourselves need to be Sanctified for the sake of those that were training and so as we see some of these things the the Father the husband takes the place of Christ in the home and what I'm wanting to look at today is he serves the role as priest in his home to make it a house of the Lord right you should have this mindset and and some of these uh types of the priest in the house of God he serves the same function within his own home the husband is the spiritual head and pastor of the home and of the family it's what brother Brown teaches us I'm I'm not the pastor of your home I'm a pastor of a church but the husbands those heads in their homes they are to be the the spiritual head and pastor of their home their wife and their family and so today I'm just want to emphasize along this theme the father is the priest of the home the husband is the priest of the home and as that he has to be Sanctified first as the head and Leviticus chapter 10: 8 to 11 and the Lord spake unto Aaron saying do not drink wine nor strong drink thou nor thy Sons with thee when you go into the Tabernacle of the congregation lest you die shall be a statute forever throughout your generation so this is a requirement upon the priesthood that they not take strong drink and there's a tremendous consequence for doing it they would die with which let's just look at it this way it means they wouldn't be able to do what they're supposed to do and he says and that ye may put difference between holy and Unholy and between unclean and clean so they themselves needed to be Sanctified a a and to be holy because they're going to be putting a difference between holy and Unholy they're going to be determining clean and unclean so they had to First be the first partakers of that in their own lives verse 11 and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes with the Lord which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses so we could take away from this that a priest is to go into the Tabernacle of the congregation he is to put a difference between holy and Unholy clean and unclean and he's to teach the children of Israel all the statutes this scripture tells us some of the roles of the priesthood a and the functions that they might take within the house of the Lord but then we realize because they have that responsibility these verses are telling us that they are to themselves be Sanctified in Leviticus 21:6 and you can go back to these chapters and find uh much broader descriptions and requirements it says this of the priest they shall be holy unto their God in not profane the name of their God for the offerings of the Lord made by fire and the bread of their God they do offer therefore they shall be holy think of that it's clean hands holding a clean sacrifice uh Clean Hands uh holding and cleansing and purifying clean utensils and the instruments within the Tabernacle they shall be holy they shall not profane the name of the Lord because the offerings that they make and the bread that they give they they are also holy they're to be offered and to be Sanctified and their these offerings being made for Israel and all the different ceremony that's attached with these offerings and these sacrifices they were to themselves be Sanctified because they were going to be presenting sacrifices clean before the Lord to be accepted by God and that that's required of priest in the Old Testament and so I'm I'm saying to you today what I'm using as a type is that if we are going to be priests within our homes we too have the same requirements that we sanctify ourselves first in order to do the service that we ought to do properly in our marriages and our families in Romans 12:1 he says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service he's actually using a language that the Jews would have used of a priest and said wow they are to present sacrifices and they're to be holy and God's to accept them and that's their service their their reasonable service it's what they're called to do but now he brings us into the priesthood ourselves but not just to offer up sacrifices but to actually offer up ourselves and that's where it's so amazing as Christ is entered in behind the veil himself the high priest himself the sacrifice and and he entered into the holy of holies once uh there pred in heaven with the blood of the sacrifice and forever consecrated in a way that we too in the same way could present ourselves covered in the blood as a sacrifice uh but also as a priest and so we are to present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service so this would go for these young men who aren't even uh parents yet they're not even priests in their own home but they're priest in training and they're to present their bodies as a Living Sacrifice which is their reasonable Service as we'll be calling to Exodus 12 as we read in there and it speaks of how that Moses told the children of Israel to draw out a lamb a and to take that lamb and to bleed it out and and they're going to slay it and the blood is going to be put into a basin then they're to take the hisp and use that to apply the blood to the doorpost and the lentil brother B talks about how it creates that a cross and even how that blood would be dripping down even upon the threshold and so if you left you'd be stepping over the blood there's a lot of a lot there in that imagery and so even drawing from this place in the scripture brother bam says in the sermon Israel and the church part three the father was the priest of the house in the old time now before uh they had the Tabernacle in the wilderness before they had established the priesthood the man the father is the priest in the house house so which came first the man in the home not the priest in the Temple and so the priest in the temple moded after the modeled after the original the man in the home the priest was the the father was the priest in the old time the father always was the priest and he had to watch over his household what a change today the kids watch over the dad in the modern world but the father was to watch over his house he killed the lamb he took the hisp and put it on the doors and on the the lentil and that was their protection it was the father's responsibility to apply the token and implying the token to the house it was for their protection and one of the one of the things that stands out to me so remarkably when brother Brandon preaches the token is in the scripture applying the token was literally the blood to the doorpost in the lintle but brother brandham identifies that there was a greater sanctification taking place on the inside then just the sign on the outside and he always tied the getting rid of all the leav out of the house to applying the token today kick the trash out get all the leaven out and it was all done for the family's protection if the blood wasn't on the doorpost in the lento then that that that Death Angel would visit that home and take the life of their child so the the dad was responsible for hearing what the prophet said doing exactly what the prophet said not only for his own protection but for the protection of the family and he was doing this exercising the role of a priest within his home for the family's protection in Exodus 12:3 it says Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel now this is God giving the original instructions saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house so every house had to have a lamb and they speak if a house isn't large enough or they you know they you could take one and households could come together and assemble together but it says a house each man according to the house of their fathers and this is the way that Israel would have been arranged uh literally according to their household their family name but it says a lamb for a house and if every house had to have a lamb then it required a priest in every home a lamb for a house and a priest in every house that's where I came with the title a priest priest for a home a lamb for a house requires a priest in the home to sanctify to pull out to prepare and to offer that sacrifice to cook it properly to apply the blood that's the role of the priest in the home today in First Peter chapter 2:5 it says ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house now I know maybe the emphasis is uh more on the man and the husband and the father but I hope you all realize that in Romans chapter 12 1 Peter 2 he's not just speaking to the man he's speaking to all of us to Children men and women brothers and sisters uh uh ladies and gentlemen each one alike your Lively stones are built up a spiritual house so we are his house and a holy priesthood you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you're the priest in the temple a priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so just as in the days of the Exodus uh there was a a lamb for a house and a priest in each house who would administer that sacrifice and be sure that all the instructions are followed we should realize today as the body of Jesus Christ we are called to be a holy priesthood God said that Israel would be a kingdom of priests not just Levites set apart within the whole nation of Israel but to think they all were to be Kingdom a a kingdom of priest a holy priesthood it says in the this is maybe just a phrase for you to chew on a little bit this week a royal priesthood what a combination of titles and offices a royal priesthood strict division between the king the throne and the temple and the priest but now you have a royal priesthood the Bible having made us Kings and Priests to offer up spiritual sacrifices to present our bodies a Living Sacrifice that's our reasonable service it's what we are due to give God so as in The Exodus they were to gather every man to his house and to take out a lamb a lamb for a house if there's going to be a lamb in the house there has to be a priest in that house and that lamb even for us today there should be Christ should be at the center of our house there should be those that are leading in that home to point to Christ and give an example says in Exodus 12:1 15 and we could make the we could take time to establish the type that we're in the Third Exodus and in this Exodus that we want to have Christ at the center to have the preeminence in Exodus 12:15 it says seven days shall you eat unleavened bread even the first day shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the until the seventh day that Soul shall be cut off from Israel if you eat leaven bread your Soul's going to be cut off so God's solution this is the wisdom of a real father God's solution was not to have uh countertops full of wonderfully leaven bread with icing on it and raisins and dates and everything else and no don't touch you you got to wait a few days amen don't touch it but it was to get all the leaven out to to ensure their protection and so the responsibility was on the heads of the house to guard against potential failure go and since you can't eat leaven bread God instructs the heads of the home as brother mam says to apply the token and get all the leaven out for the protection of anyone who would make the mistake of eating leaven bread even if they didn't do it willfully even if they didn't do it knowingly it's if they ate leaven bread during that time period that Soul would be cut off from from from God and so God said be proactive in this I'm kind of maybe seing some things that we'll get to next Sunday and because of the consequences do things now upfront to guard against potential destruction and failure and Corruption by getting all the leaven out and brother man it teaches us that that's part of applying the token get all the trash out apply the token to your home so there's the witness of Christ on the outside the blood's been applied the doorpost and lentil displaying Christ on the outside but inside the home your the feet were shawed they were dressed they were prepared the lamb was boiled that was prepared exactly or the the lamb was prepared exactly the way it was supposed to be not this way not that be they were going to eat all of it this is a way that they were to uh uh uh they were preparing themselves on the inside and there had to be those that were diligent to look after the way the home was to be ordered to see that it would be fulfilled because the consequences were pretty high that Soul would be cut off from Israel brother brandom says in God's provided way in December 53 every father that day was a priest of his own family and it was up to each individual family to kill a lamb notice how brother Bram is identifying in that day the husband the father was the priest in the home there was a lamb for a home there was a priest for a home to kill that lamb and to dress it and to serve it and to eat it and to put the blood upon the doorpost of little and to get all the leav out of the home that was the responsibility of the father in that day he says it again in June of that year I can look he's describing how this Death Angel would be passing through coming back through yonder I can see two big black wings spread out Across the Nation here it comes I can hear the priest of the family the father say there's the death angel sweeping the land now too late now so there's the priest in the home making this declaration and directly I can see him go dip down into the valley and hear a scream come up from out of that house the son was dead he's talking about this Death Angel swooping through and he went directly here he comes right down to another house again goes in the big black wings close in around the house the screen comes up the sun is dead and he says I can hear the little boy say daddy take another look be sure the blood's on there oh could you imagine I maybe you can enter into this scene because it's real we believe our Bibles and maybe because it's been dramatized by CE will be de Mills or something but I want you to think about this how real it would have been for the first born of that house to hear the screams going up all over Egypt and all over and as brother B's describing you can maybe see a a a a the black wings shroud itself over a house and the cries go up and the Sun dies and then it got real for that sun for that whole family all of a sudden like whoa that escalated quickly we kind of like well I mean these are just spiritual types and we'll just have a spiritual dry spell and you know we'll get out of this and we'll get back into gear and we'll start doing the things we know we ought to do and we'll make it by God's grace all of a sudden it got real whenever people are dying and people are screaming you can see the death angel passing through and the father who would have had to have applied the blood the boy looks at his dad and says Dad take another look are you sure it's there please dad tell me and he says son you would hope that he'd be able to say son don't worry the blood's there amen I I I applied it I I I made sure I understood what God told Moses I made sure that I knew exactly what we were supposed to do it it it's applied Daddy can I go out and check no son you can't go out you can't go out if you cross out you got to wait till the morning the blood's applied but it was very serious in that moment the priest was then responsible for the the life of his son daddy take another look and be sure the blood's there my what a what a startling dramatization he says a father was the priest of the family he says that's the way it was in Old Time the father was always the priest and had watch over his family and he says what a change today and he's not uh recommending it and he's not saying there this is a needful change he's saying it's the wrong kind of change where the fathers aren't as diligent as they should be there's even a time maybe where that's what's portrayed and there was a season maybe where the father was aloof he was a bread wi or he was out working all day and came home and he just wanted to have his cigar read the paper and eat dinner and go to bed uh and it was the mother who is domesticated working with the children and a and always there present with them and and just because that's the way it was when in America's good old days and maybe there was something that was glorified on TV doesn't mean that's the way that the the message teaches it or that's the way that we ought to do it ourselves because the way that we as uh fathers and heads of homes ought to be present ought to be mindful ought to be engaged h and take responsibility amen here is he said that to get all the leaven out of the house to be sure the blood is applied and Romans chapter 13: 13 and 14 and I'm with just what I have here kind of maybe Veer just a little bit uh into a particular area but I want this to hold for a little bit because it's it's points to something that's very very important he says let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wanness not in strife and envy and there's your instructions for this week avoid rioting drunkenness chambering wanness strife and envy and if you could avoid those and all their applications you you got a pretty good head start but these are things that were to be honest not uh rioting drunken chambering wanting Strife envy and I found myself maybe potentially getting losted what do those those things mean and how they present he says but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and there's the there's the real kicker put him on on and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof now what a statement put on Christ and do not make provision for the flesh because if you provide for the flesh you will fulfill the lust of the flesh so there's a lot to this to put on Christ and having put on Christ who is that high priest now we're in the image of the priest we're in the image of Christ and in that we're not going to provide for the flesh because if we provide for the flesh the flesh will take advantage of the provision and fulfill its lust when it says make not provision for the flesh the word provision there means forethought that providential care uh where you perceive beforehand you force beforehand it Lally means to Pro to see a need and provide or prepare beforehand if you catch that be it it don't provide beforehand things for the flesh but foresee and be proactive about the things that the flesh wants about the things that the flesh gravitates towards put on Christ make not provision have forethought have providential care not to provide these things for the flesh not to be so concerned about the Flesh and and to and to be aware of those things that we provide beforehand to allow the lust of the flesh to be fulfilled in other words make it harder for sin the World the Flesh the devil to have access to your heart and the hearts of your children children make it harder put on Christ and make not provision for the flesh this is what God was instructing the families to do in Exodus chap 12 get all the leaven out have no provision for the Flesh and if I could say this this is I just want to point to this aspect and and use just one example but just know that there's so much more here in this area that you can mine out yourselves within your own family devotions and things but priest had a duty in the old test they had a duty to prepare themselves to prepare the temple and to be proactive they were to protect protect they were to Pro provide as we read already in Leviticus chapter 10 and chapter 21 they were to they were to prepare the people to be holy vessels themselves and because they were preparing the people they were to teach them to know right and wrong they had to administer the sacrifices and the rights of the atonement and all these things required preparation not just in the temple but for for themselves if you could just go and read in some of these places in Leviticus and all the things that were necessary for them to do within the temple you'd find that this is a lot of work there was a lot of things that they had to be mindful of a lot of things that needed to be cleaned a lot of things that needed to be killed a lot of things that had to be prepared and there was a lot of other elements that went with it just beyond the high priest once a year going behind those veils into the most holy Place uh they had tremendous responsibilities so they had to always be prepared they had to be f looking they had to be thinking about what was required brother bam says of of Jesus Christ see him walking up in down in the midst of the church this is him writing in Smyrna chapter 4 the church age book like a father he's looking down upon his family he is the head of his household he is the provider he is the protector so this is the role that we are even as Christ is the head of the church then we we must be as a father uh in our families we've got to be looking after our family as the head of the household we have to be a provider and a protector and that means that we have to have this uh ability in our hearts to foresee things and anticipate things so that we can make not provision for the Flesh in Job chapter 1 verse5 it says and it was so verse four talks about how his children were feasting and drinking says it was so in the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and Sanctified them we drew a lot from job on Wednesday night I think there's just a lot of beautiful things that you could add into this he says job sent and Sanctified them and Rose up early in the morning he's he's not waiting till the afternoon he's raising up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts thus did job continually amen job was making preparation brother bradam said this is job rising up early in the morning what what caused him to get up in the early ear early morning it wasn't just because he was an early riser but it says that he knew that his children were feasting and he sent and Sanctified them by rising up early in the morning a and being proactive offering these burnt offerings he said because maybe they've sinned so I want to offer a sacrifice in case something has happened and it said job just didn't do it one time and this is instructive to all of us he didn't just do it once he did it continually this was a proactive sacrifice this is him as a as a dad knowing his children and knowing his family and thinking ahead he was proactive and and he said I want to rise up early I want to put in the hard work I want to do things that are necessary at the beginning just by chance my children may be doing these things may be tempted in this way might be facing things at school might be having difficulties that I don't see I want to send and sanctify them I want to rise up early and offer up the right kind of offerings and I don't want to just do it one time I think it's amazing some people have reduced to applying the token to the family as if it's some sort of seance I applied the token to my famine they just go on and live whatever life they want say whatever they want do whatever they want and never do anything that they ought to be doing for themselves in order to be a a a a beacon of what the token is to their family am because it's more than just applying the token is not just crossing your arms and blinking and somehow placing over them some sort of protection but to apply the tokens active brother B tells us in conflict between God and Satan that Parenthood originated in God and says that God was the first parent and as the first parent he says don't you think he gave his children and provided for them the best thing that could be provided for them he says that God equipped his children this is the role and responsibility of parents Ood to provide the best for your children to equip your children now what did he give give his children in the beginning the word now I don't think you can find anything better as parents today as the Equippers as the ones that guide I don't think you can find anything better today than the word so it's the responsibility of the priest of the home to guide to give to equip to look out over the family to be watching out over their needs to think down the road what is this going to look like in a few years there's some things you could be doing now by rising up early and doing things early on things that you can do now to save yourself some trouble down the road might be getting into a little bit of some of the things I'd like to deal with on being proactive but there's we see this example in job it's the responsibility of a priest of a home to do as Christ did to do as God did to his children the garden to do as Christ did to uh to the church the head the provider The Protector being one that prepares makes preparation for themselves for their families proactive says in Matthew chapter 24: 43 and 44 are you feeling good this morning everybody good wonderful pray for me I I need a little bit extra help this morning had a had a rough week last week he says but Matthew chapter 24: 43 and 44 he says but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up now there's a lot that's uh expressed in the good man of the house and brother Bram a lot of places takes that to speak of the Holy Ghost that when a man is delivered of devils that you want to get the good man Faith you want to have the Holy Spirit there to watch out and to keep that one from coming back so there's a lot of things that um very beautiful in this thought of the good man of the house but says the good man of the house if he knew the time the thief was coming he would have been there and met him at the door and said uh uh uh right no no no no no no no you're not coming in here he says therefore be ye also ready but then he says for in such hours you think not the son of man cometh so it's not that we we say well you know what I'm going to wait till they're 13 and then I'm going to be ready or I'm going to wait till they're just about ready to drive and I'm going be ready it it's not telling us as if in this story that if you knew the exact moment the thief was coming you'd be ready he says well it'd be like yeah right we would know so then always be ready that that's what he's saying be be ready it says he would if he would have watched it means give strict attention to it speaks of being cautious to ha to take heed lest through any kind of omission or indolence the house is stripped of its Comforts and its strength in other words give heed to watch out over your house Les because you got lazy and weren't on guard and weren't watching and weren't preparing and weren't forward looking the things that make your house a home the very things that have turned it into a sanctuary the very things that make it happy for your children are the very things that start to be taken away we might think that it's the it's uh the PlayStation and this uh college football game that's coming out this year later by EA Sports and we might think that it's uh uh movie nights and all sorts of entertainments and a lot of things that we do there might be a lot of those things that we're thinking makes the home happy for our children but do you realize it's the atmosphere and the home that our children will like not all the game and all the movies and all the rivality and everything it's the it's the harmony between mother and father it's the connection between parents and their children and it doesn't have to include a lot of the accoutrements of the world and worldliness and entertainment in order for it to be a place that children feel like this is home yeah my friends may do this and they may have have this in their home and they may have that in their home but there's one thing that we have in ours that I can't feel anywhere else and that's a real connection with my parents a real love a real care over my soul a real watching out over my spirit and that's something that we can can cultivate and something we can provide and we don't need to lean on Disney we don't need to lean on EA Sports we don't need to lean on a lot of these other things we can have the most important thing right there in the family where we're looking out after them by keeping the right watch over them and making them feel safe and secure we need to be good men and women of the house brother Bram in the the way to have Fellowship he's talking about job and he's he's speaking very specifically about Job offering up these sacrifices and he says teaching the teaching that I can give he's speaking of his children the teaching that I can give them around the home yet they go out with the worldly crowd he talks about in one place he says uh we have them at home just a couple hours and the school has them the rest of the day and then we just try to get two hours an hour into them on Sunday school on Sunday morning he's like well no wonder the children are a mess the world has them all week long and we only give him 30 minutes in Sunday school and the knee-jerk reaction as parents isn't be like we need longer Sunday school right that's not the answer the answer is wow what are we doing in the evenings how am I sending them off to school what kind of example and atmosphere is being set in the rest of the time so this is a very important thought he says I can teach them in the home but then they get out around the worldly crowd he says the Devil is a shrewd fellow and he pushes that into them that's right very shrewd pushing things into them and then this statement to me write it down I didn't provide a lot of the quotes on slides today I don't normally do that please forgive me I guess don't give me a star for today whatever it is you do keep track of these things he says if you keep them under the spirit until they get old enough to receive the Holy Ghost and know what it's all about then God will take care of the rest of it thank you Lord I'm going to read it if you want me to go slow enough so you can see this if you could keep them under the spirit until they get old enough to receive the Holy Ghost and know what it's all about so now they have the Holy Ghost to discern right WR they have the Holy Ghost to lead them in a situation where the devil's being shrewd then God will take care of the rest of it then what I want to do is I want to keep them under the Holy Ghost we say that we want to be the Holy Ghost to them until they get it keep them under the Holy Ghost until they get the Holy Ghost and if I can keep them under that Holy Ghost at home teaching them at home when they go out into the world and that shrewd fellow tries to push things into them God will take care of that Hallelujah if I could just keep them under the Holy Ghost God help me to keep them under the token keep them under the right kind of atmosphere keep them under the right kind of example keep them under the right kind of priesthood in my home then God will take care of the rest I don't need to be micromanager I don't need to be a helicopter parent I don't need to be at school I don't need to be checking everything my goodness with the things kids could do today and you could say well I need to lock the Wi-Fi down I want to be sure they don't have any devices I want to be sure about this and sure about that man as soon as you get one uh portal blocked there's a new one opening up the other day um we asked Elliot about something and we asked him what he was uh what he was doing he said he was I hope you don't mind Elliot this is really really embarrassing I'm just kidding he said asked him what are you doing he said I'm chatting on Reese's and I'm like what is Reese's I didn't even know there was an application called Reese's they're get these things how how can you control all this stuff now he's chatting on a little chocolate peanut butter snack it just happened to be the name of the the the chat channel on teams or whatever ever so I was like whoa you know if I was to start checking for Skittles and Three Musketeers what have you been doing on Snickers lately but there's just so much out there that I realize as a parent I could become a neurotic just worrying about how shrewd the devil is but I have a promise if I keep them under the Holy Ghost if I can look out over my temple if I could look out over my home myself in my home if I could do that God will take care of the rest and and I won't let go of that promise I'll hold God to his word and say Lord I want to do the best I can to prepare myself and to keep my family under the Holy Ghost and you promised you take care of the rest of it that's the role and responsibility as parents and the sermon Watchman what of the night is drawing from this I know berc is thinking this is an opportunity for a song but it's it says if the good man would have walked brother bam takes this in Watchman one of the night he says the Watchman was that man who went up to a tower on the city way high he was higher than all the footmen because it was his position brother baham uses the Watchmen to relate to even his office as a prophet and that role that he might have to the church age and to the bride but now in application we could see ourselves in a different position within the family as the head as the parents father and mother together he he was higher than the footman because it was his position now in order for this man to get up there he must have a good clear understanding and he must have good eyes these are things you can pray for I want to have good clear understanding I want to have good eyes he must be alert he must know the stars and many qualifications had he to be before he could be a correct Watchman there's a requirement for the priesthood there's a requirement for the Watchmen I'm I'm kind of eliciting to you today or from the word of God these things these requirements of us as Watchmen because of our position we're higher he says and I'm afraid today that we put some Watchman in that couldn't see very far oh couldn't see all this disaster that's coming to warn the people then unqualified a Watchman would soon have the city destroyed because the entire city depended on the Watchman thank God this bride will not be destroyed because she had a Watchman one that was higher than the rest one with an Eagle Eye who's warned us ahead of time the invasion of the United States and these different things that were preached to warn us about Hol wood War us about entertainment war war us about Pentecostalism we've we've heard those warnings from the Watchman brother brandham but now in the same image you within your home have the benefit of what the Watchman has said and we have the benefit of what the word of God says you have the benefit of the Holy Ghost that gives you a clear understanding therefore we have the responsibility to our homes as Watchmen that they not be destroyed our homes depend upon parents as Watchmen I know if the the home burned to the ground spiritually you probably want to blame it on your teenagers and they might be the ones that put the match to the gasoline but why' you fill it up with so much gasoline and matches just a matter of time before they would light a match now I'm going to I'm just I want to take I going to close I have just a um one more thing to share with you before we close and it's just from Proverbs Proverbs chap 1:8 I want to piggyback on this this is kind of where I'm veering just a little bit but it says my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother amen oh that reminds me whose birthday was it Wednesday okay I won't do it now we might use this to instruct Ian we might just say Ian says to hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother and we could do that and we often do that because this scripture says my son so we feel it's directed to the son and and if I was saying Ian here are the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother mother and father be over there going right I mean they like that's that's good stuff that's good but you know what this speaks to the parents first because what it should say to a father is what are my instructions right right to the mother what is my law and if it hasn't been articulated what are my children deducing from my actions because they're going to do what you do right and so the the instructions of a father and the law of a mother in other words fathers must have instructions they must have discipline they must have correction not just in what they say but even in what they demonstrate and what they do hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother fathers must have instructions mothers must have laws is that good that's why we always say go ask mom she's the one with all the laws I'd let you eat that son but I'm not the one that's responsible for the menu right she has the laws and it's scriptural so hear the instruction of thy father go ask thy mom and the law of thy mother brother Brown takes this in the sermon of the invasion of the United States he says to you little mothers here this morning it's kind of it's neat how he adds this to it cuz I know maybe some of you thinking yeah the dad's are really getting it right brother aon's giving them the business but this we're all in this together he says to you little mo mothers here this morning that's been real mothers I know there's many of you I think every one of you let me tell you something God bless you you are the Fifth Gospel that's what you are the Fifth Gospel and it begins to tell the story of Moses remember when Moses was a little boy it was a mother who give him his instruction it was a Godly mother who took little Moses on her knees and said Moses he says taught him now this catch this part she was his teacher under pharaoh and you want to talk about Leo de sea and you want to talk about Joe Biden did this Joe Biden did that and we're still suffering from Obama's eight years and you want to blame everything on a liberal agenda okay fine she was his teacher under pharaoh and said these things said Moses someday you're going to deliver the children of Israel You're the boy that's called keep yourself pure and unspotted from the world you're the one you're the one says no other place do we know where he ever went to any Seminary any teaching at all he ever got he stayed right in Pharaoh's Palace which was a heathen but his mother taught him just keep him under the Holy Ghost and God will take care of the rest that even though we may be in Egypt and we may feel that we're in the house of pharaoh we have opportunities as parents and right here it's just emphasizing this glorious role of the woman within the home even though it might be a heathen nation and the Heath is Raging his mother taught him he said that's a real mother she taught him the precepts of the Lord she told him how he must be holy she told him how and what he must live and how what God must do would do for him and it stuck with Moses all the days of his life taught him precepts taught him to be holy what he told him what he must do how to live he says and any good true loyal mother that'll take her little babies instead of send them to picture shows and dances and so forth like that she'll put them on her la and teach them about the Lord Jesus Christ now I think you ought to use some wisdom there if they're 16 years old maybe don't need to use the lap but was it tell us what what is loyal Parenthood it's equipping teaching instead of just sending them off to picture shows and dances and some of you like what are even those but you put them you set them down and teach them about the Lord Jesus Christ the Easter still brother Brown speaking of children he says they Little Treasures that God gives you the responsibility of raising and I've always said and made this kind of a saying to mothers we know written of four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John but there's a Fifth Gospel Unwritten that's mother she gets them before Matthew Mark Luke and John's teachings get them the the the parents the mother gets them before the Bible even gets them so the responsibility is placed upon you mothers and you fathers to raise these children for the kingdom of God he said I'm sure that's your heart's desire this is our responsibility it's placed on us as fathers and mothers to raise the children for the kingdom of God that Fifth Gospel within the home the father's a priest in the home the mother's working together with this as the gospel as the word they're priests in the home the Bible says they're to offer up their bodies as a Living Sacrifice they are called to be a holy priesthood he hath made us all Kings and Priests so this is a role that we take within the home in Proverbs Chapter 6:20 my son keep thy father's commandment and forsake the law not the law of thy mother again the mothers have laws father's got instructions and Commandments amen the Commandments the fathers must have a code of wisdom now I've been working on a sermon but maybe I'll just preach it all right here it could be quick promise no series here I I'll get rid Parts 1 through 12 right here there's things in life that that we learn and we begin to implement when we call them life hacks it's like hey did you know you could do this like the right way to peel a banana things like that but as you learn those things as a parent by the time they get to your children they shouldn't be called hacks you listening I think I need to do a series on this they shouldn't be called hacks the the children should be like this is just the way that it is and for a lot of people who came into the world came into the message out of the world and out of Pentecostalism and out of sin and all these things there's things about the messes that were new and these were like spiritual hacks and oh my goodness this is amazing this is amazing and a lot of things that you begin to implement and it's revolutionary a and it's lifechanging but there should be things that we Implement in our homes that we don't even call them hacks we say this is just the way you do it this isn't a shortcut this isn't the neat way this isn't the better way this is the way series or no series series okay well well we we'll set up a GoFundMe I mean a poll a poll but it says my my son keep thy father's Commandments it says it's a code of wisdom the father has to have a code of wisdom now if I could just be transparent I don't like to do this uh as the one that's speaking because I think the most important thing for me to do is get out of the way in what better way than to be transparent but the more I studied this the more I feel like man kind of I'm kind of lost in this what's your code of wisdom what I'm still learning on the job you know what would be the tenants you would put down what would be your standard operating procedure what would be your words of wisdom if you only had 10 minutes to tell your sons everything you felt like they needed to know for the rest of your lives where would you start brother Reggie did a um one of the youth meetings where he's kind of asking that question like what would be the most important thing and if you could say one thing this is the most important thing get it and if we had to do that what would it be so I I say that just to recognize that this is It's challenging to think that wow what are my instructions and it's not just make your bed and do this and do that what's my code of wisdom am I able to uh demonstrate not just articulate that when I'm in a situation there's a way that I respond to it there's a way that that when something happens like you just go oh my goodness not again right or or is there Panic or do you start is there a way that you respond to things because as you respond brother B toss there's someone watching you and as you demonstrate your wisdom as you live out your wisdom it's being instructive to others because the Bible said keep the father's commandment keep the father's code of wisdom and it tells us I've got to have one so I say father give me wisdom because they're looking at my wisdom father lead me because H H uh because I'm leading them brother bradam says in the message leadership the first is the mother's kindness he's talking about lead you're going to have somebody lead you he speaking for every individual first first it's the mother's kindness that leads you and then the father's word so mothers are to be kind fathers to have the word and the mother gives you your first step then you look to your daddy all of us for wisdom that's scriptural keep thy father's commandment he says because he is the head of the house and now young people you can all amen here not that he's any smarter right right knucklehead but he's just made a leader of his family so he does have to be smart but because he's the leader he says so we follow what our daddy says do that should have been the title what daddy says do when he says now son I'd like for you to do a certain thing then we listen to him because it's wisdom but listen he has learned a whole lot and we've got to ask him to see what he learned and then we can profit by his what he's learned you're starting to asking us what what have I learned what kind of questions am I going to get later it's I I'm preaching this not to our young people I we could preach this to the young people go home and ask questions and do what your daddy says and we could we could take that angle with and I think that would certainly be appropriate and brother bradam is saying that you should listen to your daddy whatever he says to do you've got to do it because he's learned a lot and we want to learn profit from what he's learned that tells me I need to stop for a moment and think what am I learning what have I learned have I learned from my mistakes have I learned from my successes God give me wisdom Lord help me this is an important position am he tells us now don't go and do this because I did that my father father told me not to do it but I did it and it caused this to happen to me something bad well good so then we can learn from our mistakes to teach ours he says then he daddy tells us how to do it and what to do right when your kids go out and you say don't do anything I wouldn't do you want to be sure that that's a safe instruction right yeah I'll just I I'll close musicians go please if you could just come to your instruments I just want to close with this image at 1 Chronicles chapter 6 in verses 48 and 49 it says it says this and I'll come to verse 32 here in a moment it says their Brethren also the Levites were appointed un all manner of service of the Tabernacle of the house of God and this is Levites that are all being included there's different divisions according to talents and responsibilities and gifts so at this point and if you read Leviticus excuse me 1 Chronicles 6 there's a lot of names and Sons and different ones but there's these little things that are interspersed in there that give context to these lineages and the fathers and their sons and the fathers and their sons so it says their Brethren also the Levites were appointed under all manner of service of the Tabernacle of the house of God so all manner of service some were Porters at the gates others had the responsibility to carry uh carry care for certain vessels others had to slay the the sacrificial beast and to uh fet them and cut them open and discard certain things and they had to bring the pieces to the altar to be burned uh for the priest to offer so there's all sorts of different roles not all of them did the same thing it says but Aaron and his sons offered upon the altar of the burnt offering and on the altar of incense and were appointed for all the work of the place most holy and to make an atonement for Israel according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded so in these two verses Chronicles chapter 6 and if you read more you just see there's all these men that had these responsibility in these roles and it related to Levites not all Levites entered into the priesthood but all of them would serve in the temple and if we got real strict about you know who is the priest in the home and can the wife really be a a priest and is she is she a pastor Pastor in the home and then if she's the pastor in the home then what does that make the dad the prophet or it's just there might be a whole way you try it's it's not about trying to figure out the types let's just look at the reality we're we're called to lead we're called to serve in the home as as Levites as Kings and Priests as a royal priesthood as Servants of the most high some may have different gifts and strengths hopefully in your marriage what God has done is he's brought you someone who compatible with you who who is that help meet who is that mirror image of you equal but opposite to look out after your weaknesses you find in some situations where both the husband and a wife are think the exact same way and do everything the exact same way sometimes they're that's really good but has a really bigh uh downside because they don't help one another in their weaknesses so in our differences in our strengths and our weaknesses we all have different things we do but we're all called to service employed as they we can look in the scriptures they were all employed in these various departments and these different administrations and Temple service and then we could look within our homes and say I'm called to be a husband called to be a wife by God's grace called to be a father called to be a mother and we could even say called to be Sons called to be daughters all together arranged as one beautiful picture of God's desire am it says in 1 Chronicles chapter 6:32 it says they ministered before the dwelling place of the Tabernacle of the congregation with singing until Solomon had built the house of the Lord in Jerusalem and then they waited this is that particular group of people that were singers said then they waited on their office according to their order and this could be said of each one each one of these Levites that served in their different capacities appointed under all manner of service employed in all these different administrations and departments Aaron and his sons this uh Levites this Levites and all the Levites that were appointed all could could be said that they performed their duties according to the responsibilities given to them and they did what they were supposed to do and that's what allowed the entire house of the Lord to function wasn't all just on Moses the prophet Moses is not even enter mentioned in a lot of these things it was all according to what he commanded but then Aaron's the one who's who's arranging the priest and his sons and then you have this father with his sons and this father with his sons these are gifted and singing These gifted and that and they all found their place and they all did what they were supposed to do according to their office and according to their order I think this these sermons I've been preaching on this ought to be reemphasizing to you that already know it that you are called as men to a high office a priest for a home and then if you have the blessing of being married God's called you to serve with another priestess as it were a Fifth Gospel if that helps you a help meet to perform the duties of priests in a home brother brand is preaching the Seal of the Antichrist and he comes down and he's and he made this state I just was reading it last week and it just kept it just kept nudging me and I I'll say this I'll say it as he says it to the congregation and you just you just ask yourself Lord does does something speak to me in this he says you ought to go home everybody get down around the B tonight or else bring the mother and kitties all of them get around the bed and say mother let's pray right here till God really makes things different around here who ought to do that hopefully it's the husband hopeit the husband who's in a place where he could say honey let's gather together and let's pray that God things will God will make things different around here that tells me that it's not too late I remember when I was ministering on a particular subject on family order a number of years ago and the more that I studied on it the more I began to get discouraged thinking man just in these first dozen years or so there's a lot of things I wasn't doing that I should and there's a lot of things you let go and sometimes you're just so busy surviving you're doing everything you can just to get through and to make it and deal with certain things and and because of that your children suffer and finances may suffer and certain things may suffer as a result of it and you look up and maybe the preacher just keeps preaching on the man the home over and over again he's start okay enough already I didn't know all this until now and now and you think is it too late is it too late and I was fellowshiping brother Jason Watkins and I just said man as I look at these things I just think man is it too late and he said brother Aaron it's never too late to change the family Dynamics and I said I'm claiming it it's not too late it's not too late wherever you may be today if you're the grandparents if you're the parents if you've been married for decades if you've only been married for a couple years whatever it might be it's not too too late to change the Dynamics and have the grace not to put your foot down and put the woman in her place but the grace as it said to men brother said to take to place just to place your foot where it belongs so that your wife can find her place and the whole family can line up and be in order and let's challenge ourselves as a priest of a home if you could all just stand together with me today we'll pray together
