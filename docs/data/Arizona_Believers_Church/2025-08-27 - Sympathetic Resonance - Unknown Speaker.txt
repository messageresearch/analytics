TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hebrews chapter 4, start with verse 11, read to verse 16, and it reads, "Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Seeing then that we have a high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast our profession. If we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. &gt;&gt; I think there's just such a tremendous overlap with the grace over shame and a lot of the things we've been ministering on, even on the nakedness aspect and good and evil. If we could just pray together this evening. Gracious heavenly father, as we've read your word, we believe it to be eternal. This Bible is our absolute. Lord, we believe that it's inspired. And though it may not read like a history book or it could be read as a history book and though just reading it, it's uh black ink and white paper, it doesn't really impart anything supernatural. But yet by your spirit, you preserved it. You've watched out over it. You wrote it through the prophets and through the scribes. And now, Lord, you make it alive to us by your spirit. So, we pray tonight as we've read it that you'd quicken it to us. Be with the different needs that we have in our body. Lord, we rejoice that Sister Joyce when she gave those platelets of blood and they got those stem cells, Lord, they found enough and they have enough to work with. So, I pray that the the therapy go well and just move move along a little bit. Be with them and Pana family and all their needs. For those of us here tonight, we we're we're waiting. We're attentive. We're listening. And father, we are we are encouraged by your word, by your presence with us. And we know that you're doing very positive supernatural things. We do not want the devil to distract us. And Lord, we're believing for great miracles. We ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be seated. Sunday morning we ministered on the subject of resonance and want to uh quickly recap what that subject was and just continue on the same subject but that's the efficient transfer and the amplifying of energy at particular frequencies and so you could call them vibrations uh you could refer to them in ways of sound waves and those things and uh and we looked at the idea of tuning and when you get in tune or those concepts of how God's word is sent and it vibrates at a certain frequency and if we're out of tune. We can't be receptive to it. Uh we talked about uh destructive interference and coherence and even positive uh constructive interference. A lot of different uh aspects of sound and music and the composition of things. And so there's a lot that we covered and there's a lot of different principles in the word of God about being a a receptor of sound signals or transferring certain unseen things into the visible realm. And so a lot of that fits in. And a lot of you were identifying it with me in fellowship and I enjoyed that. But one thing we touched on Sunday was that if an object vibrates at a particular uh frequency that an object with the same natural frequency resonates and responds in the same frequency and that is called and that's my title tonight is sympathetic resonance. sympathetic resonance where an undisturbed string or even the surface vibrates in response to vibrations from another at a related frequency. So whether it's sitting there, nothing's happening. Uh it's just resting on its own, but something is moved or struck or plays or begins to vibrate at a particular frequency. And then that dormant object responds to those waves, to those vibrations, and begins to vibrate not just being shaken, but it vibrates at the same frequency. &gt;&gt; And we mentioned it on uh we mentioned it on Sunday and it it would be easy to demonstrate and you could go home if you have guitars that are in tune or tuned to each other. You take a guitar string and you string a particular you pluck a certain string then other the strings tuned to that at that same frequency even on another guitar that's not being played you can witness it begins to vibrate and it's actually this concept of this sympathetic resonance uh this is just what I've learned I haven't actually experienced this but it's helped me understand better what's happening when Preston plays the piano 12 hours a day but when the you use the sustain pedal on the piano what's actually happening is the strings corresponding to the harmonics of that played note will vibrate. And what does it do? It makes a sound richer. It has there's a there's a sustain pedal. There's a dampening you can use. There's certain ways that you're using the resonance of that g of that instrument and the way that it's made in order to enrich the sound. &gt;&gt; And so there there's certain ways and styles of playing where you're using the harmonics on a guitar. you're you're using one string, but then it it sends those vibrations into these others that are tuned the same way, and it's called sympathetic resonance. In Hebrews 1:es 1 and two, as we read in verse 11 of that same chapter, it said, "Lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief." The word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword. It's a discerner. It divides a sunder. And so, the word of God is very, very powerful. Then how is it if the word of God is so powerful that one would fail to be impacted correctly by the word of God? So it says, "Let us not fall by the same example of unbelief." And it's mentioned here in verse one. Let us therefore fear, this is a reverence. This is a this is a a respect for God and his word. Not be real cavalier and dismissive, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them. So there's your powerful word of God. The gospel which is power being preached, but the word preached did not profit them. Was not a gain to them. It was not beneficial. It was it should have it had a desired effect, but yet it didn't have the effect that it was intended to have in that the gospel is salvation. The gospel is the power of deliverance. Says not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. So they heard the word of God, but they didn't have ears to hear, to receive. Uh because there was no mixing. As the gospel was preached, it wasn't mixed with faith in them that heard it. They were tuned into reasoning, tuned into science. They were tuned into other things. So that when the word of God was preached and it began to vibrate when the vi those vibrations struck them, they didn't have the the faith to mix with that in order to respond in a way to where I can receive that and then they begin to resonate as well. They were not tuned to the promise. And then in Acts 13:48, there's so many different ways that we could use scriptures to make this point. Says, "And when the Gentiles heard this, we could say again, the gospel is being preached. The promise is now being shared as the gospel was preached unto them. Now the gospel is turning to the Gentiles when they hear it. It says they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. This is something they weren't even taught in. &gt;&gt; This is not even something they were expecting. But yet there's something in them. This ordination to life that when the word, the gospel was preached over them, this power of God shook them and they begin to vibrate. Some get shaken away. &gt;&gt; Right? That's I I promise you this. The word is either going to change you or chase you. &gt;&gt; It's thus sayith the Lord. If the word is not ch if the word is preached and it's not changing you, it's eventually going to chase you. &gt;&gt; And that may be for your own good &gt;&gt; because then you realize I'm not being changed. And so eventually it chases. So the word preached resonated with these Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And what what did they respond with? This faith to believe. And so we believe that God's word and power vibrate, but there's many that cannot, if maybe this is a poor term to use, but they cannot feel those vibrations. They do not have a sympathetic response. &gt;&gt; The word's preached and it just goes right over their head. &gt;&gt; The word is preached, they hear it, they internalize it, they think about it, maybe it bounces around, but then it just kind of gets dampened. It just gets absorbed. There's nothing in response. Now if we could look at verse 13 of our text in Hebrews chapter 4, we're we're cons the we're focusing very specifically and very narrowly on this concept in music and just life called a sympathetic response. And and we used it here in the sense of u in music in music composition and the way an instrument is structured that it uh something that is undisturbed and unused can response when an instrument of a similar use and utility or tuned the same way sounds and then this responds to it. In &gt;&gt; verse 13 it says neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open under the eyes of him with whom we have to do. There's that nakedness. This is that honesty that we ought to have when the word Bible says the word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword. What we ought to realize is our hearts are not hid from him. &gt;&gt; Even when you may not know and you may not see it, there's a lot of things that aren't happening. There's one who does know. And so therefore, we ought to have this fear to recognize that we are naked before him. And then instead of it kind of just leaving us naked, he says, "Seeing that we have a great high priest." Okay, I want you to catch this this beautiful principle that has passed into the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast our profession. Now, what beautiful imagery is the high priest once a year would enter in behind that veil into the most holy place or the holy of holies to present uh the atonement and that blood that was shed on the day of atonement to stand there as a propitiation for the sins of Israel. Now in in fulfillment of all those shadows and types, Christ has entered into heaven, entered into heaven once with that blood present to atone for our sins. He says, "So we have a high priest that has entered there to atone for our nakedness, &gt;&gt; our blindness, our confusion." &gt;&gt; And then he says, "For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities." I know you realize these scriptures, but we can always say, "Lord, I want to know that better. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I want to understand that better. &gt;&gt; I I really want to feel the weight of that in my life. Get touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin. &gt;&gt; Let us therefore come boldly. This is honestly. Boldly doesn't mean presumptuously. We kick the door down. Jesus, son of God, give me what I need. &gt;&gt; Show me this. If you don't show it to me, then I know this is wrong. If you don't show this to me, then I don't know what to do. There's there's no arrogance. It's that humility, that nakedness. There's a reason why I believe the Lord has arranged this in this order that it's through this humility of saying, "I'm broken. I've got nothing. I I I can only present myself in everything that I'm experiencing and going through." And so, you come honestly, the word there boldly is frankly honestly about the fact that you are naked and open before him. &gt;&gt; It's to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. It may not seem like it, but this is an appeal to God's sympathy &gt;&gt; because it says, "We have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities." In other words, it could be said this way. We have a high priest, Jesus Christ, that can be touched. &gt;&gt; In other words, he can sympathize with our weaknesses. &gt;&gt; That's what the word touched means. He can be sympathetic to what you're going through. And when it says infirmities, it's not just headaches and sicknesses and weaknesses, but it says, "But was in all points tempted like as we are." So he can sympathize with our physical weaknesses, our emotional weaknesses, even our moral struggles. &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Yet without sin." He did not sin, but he understands our vulnerability to its attacks. &gt;&gt; He understands how Satan works. He knows how clever he can be with, well, what God has said and this and all those different things that we go through. And so, he was truly tempted as a man. And having been tempted as a man, he knows the tactics. He knows what it feels like. And having been truly tempted as a man, he says he can sympathize with us in our temptations and our weaknesses. Therefore, he can adapt himself to you &gt;&gt; and not just to humans in general, not just to men ages 30 to 33. Uh, but he can adapt himself to your peculiar nature. &gt;&gt; Wherever you sit tonight, whatever it is you're going through and say, "Well, I'm 24 years old and I do this for a living and this is my history and my background and this is what I'm facing." You have a high priest who can sympathize with what you're going through. &gt;&gt; In Philippians chapter 2, 7 and 8, it says, "But made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross." &gt;&gt; I think you'll notice there's a lot of uh overlap. Somebody may be able to, maybe AI could do this for us. Jim and I could do it. Those different ones out there and just create these vin diagrams of all these different sermons I preach. We say he used this scripture and this one and this one and this one and you see this beautifully colored vin diagram of how these things fit with so many things in scripture. This making himself of no represent uh reputation. It's in the form of a servant. Even if you looked at it backwards, it would uh being found in fashion as a man in the likeness of man. He was in the form of a servant without any reputation. He writes this is that's the condensation as you read no reputation servant men man that this fashion and likeness it almost raises from the ground up but Christ condescended down to a servant without reputation &gt;&gt; humbled himself &gt;&gt; became obedient to death not just death but the death of the cross and because of that he has sympathy for you &gt;&gt; sympathy even in our language is this an affinity between certain things It it it speaks of even the word is a community of feeling and and to be affected by like feelings. When we have sympathy, it's a feeling that's identical with or resembling what someone else is feeling. When someone says, "Uh, it was hot in church tonight." You can say you we could be sympathetic &gt;&gt; or wasn't it a little bit muggy yesterday? I'm like, "I sympathize. I felt it too." And there's a way where you can it resonates with you when someone says something where there's this affinity there's this community or common feeling to be affected by like feelings in Hebrews chap 2:es 9 to18 but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death. Now that's uh it now re it returns to glory crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. That's part of a another vin diagram. For both he that sanctifith and they who are sanctified are all one. Now remember this. He that sanctifies and the sanctified are one. &gt;&gt; He have perfected forever them that are sanctified. Right? There's this there's this sanctification, this glorification for the perfected and there's this justification of the perfected that is for the elect, those that are ordained to life. &gt;&gt; For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. Again, we've used that scripture recently. And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, behold, I and the children which God hath given me. For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So as we are children of God with some a supernatural origin in destiny and we know that we will return into a supernatural eternal state, we are now partakers of having bypassed our theophony, having bypassed a sinless uh bypassed a a sinless birth, coming by sinful birth. Here we are in the flesh, partakers of flesh and blood. And he says he's also a partaker of flesh and blood, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil, and deliver them through who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren. I hope you're picking up what the scriptures are laying down about this affinity that Christ has with humanity &gt;&gt; that repeating. He's not an angel &gt;&gt; in the sense that he's just programmed a certain way. He's lived angelically and he can discern and he can know things. He can do supernatural things. But God put his son brought him forth with flesh, with feelings, with uh emotions, with a personality, with a will. Father, not my will, but thy will be done. Uh with weaknesses, with flaws, as we've already seen, &gt;&gt; not sin, but flaws. uh uh uh rumors and innuendos and all sorts of things about his life. But God put him in there so that he could be made like his brethren that he might be merciful and a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God. &gt;&gt; So God made him this way for your benefit and for your sake. &gt;&gt; He was made lower than the angels. He was made a sacrifice. He was made of no reputation in the form of a servant after being made in the likeness of a man and fashioned as a man's for your benefit that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest for you because it says to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. &gt;&gt; And then it says this this is this is the sympathy. This is God's sympathy here. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted. He is able to secure them that are tempted. &gt;&gt; That means help them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know this is why he can help you. I I know that if I begin to speak down this line, you could all start to really get into it and pull me into it and next thing you know, we're just kind of all riffing on life's experiences. But how many times has someone come to you with the problem? You're like, "Man, I can't help you. I have I have no idea what it's like to do that. I have no idea how you got yourself in that fix. I didn't even know those things existed. I didn't even know you could pile up that much debt or I didn't know you could do this or you could do that. I have no idea." And when that happens, there's like, "I can't help you." But Jesus is one who knows what you're going through. &gt;&gt; He has some way of not just saying, "Yeah, I know there's trouble. Uh, how can I help? I've been there before." But he is able, having been tempted like you are. &gt;&gt; He's able to help you that are tempted. Now, I know that if we were maybe aligned differently geographically, I might have to drag you all back to your seats and tell you to sit down because that's really exciting stuff. That is really, really exciting stuff to think that God is able to help me. Not when I prove to be above temptation. Not when I proved I have all the right answers. Not when I've proved to say the right things and do the right things and have a positive confession and keep my shoulders back and do everything right and do everything good. He's able to help me when I am tempted. &gt;&gt; He's able to help me when I am weak. &gt;&gt; He's a able to help me when I need him. This is God's sympathy. &gt;&gt; This is not petty human sympathy. &gt;&gt; There's this petty human sympathy where we sympathize and we pet and we pander and we mistake what godly sympathy or what I could say this way is godly compassion. What it looks like versus human compassion. There's a human compassion and a human sympathy. That is nothing more than a lack of love. &gt;&gt; That's all it is is a lack of love. a lack of love for the person, a lack of love for the truth. It's a sympathy that relates in the evil. It's a sympathy that relates in the relenting and giving into evil. And therefore, it's spineless. But he sympathizes with us. Therefore, he is indisputably able to preserve us in all of our temptations. &gt;&gt; He do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Now, we can all we'll make mistakes. we'll we'll be tempted. Uh we have moments of a great weakness and there's things that we could say and and a believer can be driven to do things that he doesn't want to do and there's a lot of difficult things that we can see in our lives. But we must believe that Christ sympathizes with us that he knows what it's like to be tempted and that there is he is able to help you and to preserve you. &gt;&gt; Scripture says keep you blameless. I hope I'm approaching maybe I I hope I'm approaching this maybe from a standpoint you weren't necessarily expecting in this sympathetic response because now we're looking at God's sympathy and we're looking at the sympathy of Jesus Christ and how that he has a way that he can relate with you. Now if you could put yourself and now this is going to be easy. I just want you all to think of yourselves as human today, right? Just think of yourself as humans. Um, and maybe not just humans, and this can be hard. I know it's a difficult exercise, but ones with no reputation, maybe servants. I know this is hard for the elite Wednesday night crowd. &gt;&gt; But, uh, let's just It's a thought exercise, right? This is just a This is what we're doing. We're community building. We're we're we're finding all sorts of exercises as a dynamic group here uh to uh increase proficiency and create some synergy so that we can optimize frequency for the sake of the bottom line for all the stakeholders in God's word. Glory. &gt;&gt; But I want you to think about this. Jesus in Matthew chapters 26 when he goes to the garden of Gethsemane. Uh there I could read from other places where you find that Jesus the son of God goes to the garden and he asked his disciples will you pray with me? &gt;&gt; And he asked him will you watch with me? &gt;&gt; And here in verse 38 he says then he said unto them and this is not just the first time this is maybe I think the third time my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death. tear you here and watch with me. &gt;&gt; You know what Jesus is desiring in this moment? You know what he wants to feel from his disciples is sympathy. &gt;&gt; He actually wants them to be there with him. And he's expressing this very deep desire and hungry for sympathy from those he loved. &gt;&gt; Yes, he was the master and he was the teacher and he was the son of God. But in this difficult moment, he experiences how much it would mean to him if somebody else could enter into and feel what he was feeling and watch with him and pray with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He expressed a desire. He wanted to feel sympathy from those that he loved. I shared this because I was thinking about it this week when I was studying on this. I remember one time, this was early on when computers were becoming more common in households and one of the first computers we had and uh I was on the computer and it was kind of late at night and we were uh I can't remember what even I was doing on the computer and just learning these things and I remember I deleted the DAT file or whatever like man this is a giant file that seems to be hogging a lot of my RAM right now, you know, and I'm thinking well I I deleted it and just everything fell apart immediately, right? for for those of you here who know uh floppy disc, you know exactly where I'm coming from. And I remember I was like, "How in the world am I going to fix this? I don't know what to do." And my brother Dave was like, "I'm going to bed." I was like, "No, no, no, no. Stay. Just sit here. Stay with me. I've just destroyed this thing." And I didn't think he he wasn't going to be able to help me, but I just wanted someone to be there with me. And in that way, I was very Christlike. Watch with me. You can't keep me from this death. you can't fix the computer, but just sympathize with me. And he stayed with me. We figured it out. Got Microsoft support on the line. And we're going, this is back in the mid 90s, I believe. So, this is quite a while ago. But Jesus desired sympathy from those he loved. And having felt the hunger for sympathy and the need for sympathy, he now sympathizes with your sufferings. &gt;&gt; He knows just how much you will feel at times a crave and a hunger for sympathy. &gt;&gt; That that's what you want. I know our minds may immediately go to Moses like Moses was looking for sympathy and God just kicked him around. Well, whenever you've been a prophet for those that many years, God may do that to you. But right now, where we sit as in this role playing exercise, we are the lowest of the lows with no reputation, pretending to be the neighbors in the apartment next door. Right? And what do we find ourselves? We find ourselves feeling very low and degraded. And God can sympathize with you. &gt;&gt; Why can he sympathize? Because he knows what it's like to want it. &gt;&gt; In Romans 8:es 1:5, there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. Now this overlap with Sunday morning who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. In Galatians Paul teaches that if we walk in the spirit we will resonate with the spirit and not respond to the temptations of the devil will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. There's this damping of this appropriate damping on that frequency or those chords that can be struck by temptation and the Holy Spirit suppressing that allows us then to be available to the resonation of the Holy Spirit. For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death. &gt;&gt; For what the law could not do, and that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh. This is a repeated repeated refrain throughout scripture. Jesus Christ, the son of God, was sent in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh. that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh. Not us here, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, care for, respond to, are moved by the things of the flesh. But they that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit. This is a new resonance. When Christ was in his flesh, he related and resonated to the things of man. He could be tempted like as a man uh yet without sin. He knew what it was like to experience pain and rejection and suffering. There's all these ways that Jesus Christ was made as a man. I say all these ways. I'm just want you to think of the full experience he had from birth until his death to where now he was able to condemn sin in his flesh and forever consecrate away so that you do not live solely according to that dynamic of being flesh tempted by sin &gt;&gt; but could now after the spirit mind the things of the spirit. It's a new resonance. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As long as you're only human and strictly only an individual. If we only remained uh uh the sin the after our sinful birth, then there's just that constant resonance as it says here, they that mind the fle or after the flesh mind the things of the flesh. If that's all you are is after the flesh, that's what you respond to. &gt;&gt; But this is a new resonance. Not after the flesh to sin, but after the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a resonance after the word. This new resonance, we can put it in this context. Now, there's faith and this in this new resonance, faith is what provokes and even responds to the sympathy of God in Christ. &gt;&gt; Because now you have faith which is which feeds off the word. &gt;&gt; And it's like those two omnipotents. You had the frequency of the word and what does faith do? Responds right back with the same frequency &gt;&gt; and it meets it. We don't have this before the birth, the new birth. So those who have received his spirit now have a new resonance in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:es 9-16. But as it is written, I have not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of men the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. Growing up and just in my experience, I found that most often when this scripture was read, it was almost as if we closed the Bible and said, "You're just going to have to stay there not knowing." But uh there is a there's a big butt here. Verse 10, but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. Even revealed past tense. &gt;&gt; There's a way that the devil wants to say, well, 1 Corinthians chapter 2:9. And then I think the Holy Spirit should resonate. But 1 Corinthians chapter 2:10, God's revealed these things that God has prepared for you. &gt;&gt; He's revealed them to us by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. Now this might be you might say well this is just a common trope by brother Aaron to use these scriptures but he says for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him. &gt;&gt; What example do I often give when I read the scripture? Dogs rolling around in their own scat right in the backyard and loving every minute of it. And we look at that as humans like oh my goodness what is he doing? Where is the dog next door? It's like right on buddy. I'll be doing that later willing. Right? They they relate to one another by these spirits that they have. For what man knoweth the things of man, save the spirit of man which is in him? They that are after the flesh mind for care for or moved by the things of the flesh. And we know and can relate to other humans because we are human. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. In the day and age that we're living in, one of the one of the uh most harmful things I think that the devil gets over on us is he starts making us less human &gt;&gt; by changing our humanity &gt;&gt; where it's avatars and synthesized reality and different personas that become all digital and we hide behind man-made imaginations and figments of well I identify with this and I and we could have these constructs. They're not even human anymore. biologically they belong to Hollywood because it's just the imagination of a man who creates worlds and and and genders and relationships. It's all fiction &gt;&gt; that's been portrayed through media. There's no reality to it. It's solely for the means of entertainment. And now people begin to live in that. And what have they become? Less human &gt;&gt; because there's ways that we can divide what is humanity. Right. &gt;&gt; We used to be able to say that humanity is comprised of male and female. We found out a brother was expecting a baby the other day with his wife. He and his wife were expecting and the brother was on the phone and it was on speaker phone and the brother said, "I can just be I'm 100% positive. I'm absolutely sure it's going to be a boy or a girl." I was like, "Amen to that." And maybe that needs to be said. But you know, things have changed now where you can have things that aren't human. It's just not human. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Even so, the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. So there he says there's a a way that we relate with the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God, which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. Brother Alfonso, aren't you glad you're not interpreting me tonight? I am like just on. We've cranked this up to 12 here. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him. Neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. &gt;&gt; Things of God, things of man. Natural man, spiritual man. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. A lot of rich things here. I'm just wanting to get this picture of how Paul's describing this. For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him? And he says, "But we have the mind of Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when you receive the mind of Christ, I want you hopefully you're following me in this uh very hurried and uh uh fast-paced service sermon tonight. Christ is sympathetic to you. Christ having experienced humanity now has ascended into heaven fully glorified there as a high priest supernaturally who liveth and abideth forever who can be touched now by your human weaknesses and your temptations and can adapt himself to you individually and whatever you're going through and this is the heart of Christ which is above but now we have the mind of Christ &gt;&gt; so in the same way there ought to be this blending of the word and flesh where the lives that we have lived. We can become sympathetic to those who are lost, those who are hurting, those who are backslid, those who are deceived, those who are lusting, those who fall in all these different ways. But now it's joined together with the heart of God so that we have become a part of God's sympathy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not using this now just to get a bunch of amens or hands raised, but how many of us have heard of sympathy pains? And it can be really interesting how they manifest in different ones. But sympathy pains probably do not need any uh defining. But it's when you physically or emotionally feel echoes of what you see another person is going through. &gt;&gt; You emotionally or even physically feel you resonate with another's discomfort. One of the worst kinds of embarrassment is secondhand embarrassment. What is that? That's it's like a sympathetic response. There is when you see somebody else uh something happened like somebody is telling you, "Oh man, the other day I was I was carrying a load of firewood and I went around real quick behind the pickup truck and I kicked my shin right into the the uh the ball and hitch." And what do we see? Some of you probably felt it right now. There's a brother back there cringing. He he might be bleeding in the shin right now just because of it. Why? Because immediately we're like, "Oh." and someone says, "Oh man, I had this happen the other day." And you start going, "I'm getting sympathy pain. Stop." We begin to actually feel a response within our bodies &gt;&gt; because we can what? Identify. &gt;&gt; And you tell that story to a narcissist, they're like, "I have no idea what you're talking about. My uh investment in Bitcoin went up today." And you're like, "Oh, okay. Well, my my shin has a like an indentation into it now." You feel me? You know what? No. Uh-uh. I'm smart enough to not do that. They even have done brain imaging and whenever someone is witnessing someone else's pain or discomfort and in this brain imaging someone's pain when someone else is going through pain when you saw that brother uh kick his shin against his truck hitch his trailer hitch that that pain when we visualize that and see that it actually activates the neural regions in our minds that are active in that brother when he's hurt. the same spot. And that's why when you see it, you're like, "Oh, it's like, wait, who got hurt? Me or you?" &gt;&gt; Because it's the same part of the brain. &gt;&gt; And they find it especially in the parts that process the emotional part of pain. This is what sympathy pains are. I meant to look this up. I've just been reading it as I study. And I don't know if any brothers want to um identify with this or not, but it's syndrome. Anybody ever heard of it? Kuv, I don't know. COVID cuade syndrome. It's when a husband of an expectant wife develops pregnancy- like symptoms. And I know what you're all thinking right now, but no, my wife's not pregnant. Uh these symptoms I've come on my own, honestly. And these can literally be nausea, weight gain. Come on, give me some amens. Even labor like cramps. &gt;&gt; And I know some brothers going to be using this. I don't know. I think you should stream the service. Brother Aaron told you exactly why I'm this way. You're expecting I'm moody now. I'm overweight. I'm nauseous. I I feel cramped. Can I just sleep in today? Can you run and go get me a smash burger, extra sauce? And this is all within a human's ability to relate. And so now you have men whose wives are pregnant and they begin to develop physically and emotionally the same way she is. &gt;&gt; It's the human capacity for sympathy. Your mind, they say, has a mirroring system that simulates others actions and sensations internally that you see what they're going through and you internalize it and you process it. And that's why it helps us understand what other people are going through and actually begin to predict their experience and know even sometimes what's awaiting them, know exactly what they're going through. &gt;&gt; It's our means of re of relating to someone, anticipating and even responding to people in need. They say that your brain and your body sync with another state. And they say sometimes without even any conscious intent, &gt;&gt; you immediately begin to feel what they're feeling. You be immediately sometimes begin to know what they're going through, what they need, even if they don't see it, know it themselves. &gt;&gt; Now, do you realize how dangerous it would be as a Christian to lose that? He says in Philippians chapter 2, Paul now in verses 2 to 5, as we've read already from this chapter, fulfill you my joy that you be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Notice this one mind. We've already read about it here in the scripture how he's talking about us who are uh made free in this oneness, this one mind. And even as he mentions it in first Corinthians, we are of one mind, of one accord. Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory. That's division, politicking, partymaking. But in loneliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves. Every time I read that lowliness of mind, it reminds me is the worm in busy town lowly. Yeah. See, we need to we need to be like worms. Loneliness of mind. Let each esteem other better than themselves. We all can't be hucklecat, right? Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. This is looking beyond yourself. And look, if you lose feeling in yourself and you don't you're not self-conscious or aware of what you're going through, then you're you could be over there thinking like, well, I have everything under control and look at that guy who clearly doesn't. And now you're only concerned about everybody else's business, right? That's not what he's asking. From your own vantage point of need and bankruptcy and nakedness and your own loneliness of mind, you begin to look at others and say, "Oh, I know what it's like. I know what they're going through." And he says, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; Listen, this is a new way of processing pain. It's a new way of processing rejection. It's a new way of processing the suffering of yourself and others. &gt;&gt; It's a new way of processing evil and darkness. And something really began to uh kind of uh stand out to me as I've been studying on this subject over the last couple months is in the dangers of our modern thought process. And we could blame it on postmodernism. And I think they deserve that blame, but a lot of it is even just the evolution of western culture. And we have this emphasis and I say it ties into the spirit of Leodysia that there's this individualism &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and this relativism where everyone is afforded their own reality, their own individual uh convictions and it's this individualism. And so there's this idea that one can establish personal boundaries and this independence. And when we do that, we might think that we're honoring somebody by letting their them have their autonomy and let them be who they want to be and that we're we're giving everybody this individual basis. But what happens is we begin to reframe what even sympathy pain is. &gt;&gt; And when you feel for somebody else, you begin to feel for somebody else. And now you're just a uh you're just a nosy and you're controlling and you just want to do this and you you don't really care about my autonomy. And we reframe it as stress when you care about somebody else. Psychossematic is what they might call it. This is this is undue influence on you and this is bothering you and you shouldn't let them. And what we could say maybe is well you're just letting them live rentree in your head. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people who a lot of things that live rentree in our head. I think we need to figure out a way to monetize this. Yes. &gt;&gt; What's happened through this? When I can't sympathize with you because if I begin to feel sympathy, that stress on me individually or it imposes on your uh uh your free will. What happens is we lose that community, that community of feeling, we lose sympathy. And when we when we lose community, you either have lost community or you just replace it with cultish fetishes around other certain feelings and identities. You there's this need for sympathy. But if you begin to reject the basis of sympathy and you begin to reframe things individually and we're all autonomous, we all have our own individual needs and there's certain things. Then you'll still try to find community, but you'll you'll do it around things that are not pure &gt;&gt; around feelings and identities that they themselves are not sympathetic, but rather that's that petty human sympathy. If I could frame it this way, it was said of the telegraph that the telegraph changed things so much because now in the continuous scroll of information and these things, it changed the way we processed and re uh viewed information. Now let's just fast forward 150 years or whatever it is and you realize that now in this age of data and information it's deformed what knowledge is and intelligence is. &gt;&gt; Do you realize now we don't even we don't even worry about actual intelligence because we can refer to we can rely on artificial intelligence. &gt;&gt; The reason why we could probably ask people here what's your phone number and some of you might be like what's my phone number Siri what's my phone number right that you I'm just making sure no devices are going off. There's a way that we have so relied upon digital exercise that our brains have not been exercised. Our minds haven't been exercised. And so today, knowledge means knowing a lot of things but not knowing about them. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what social media has reduced us to? &gt;&gt; We can know a lot of things even about people. We know a lot of things about people, but do you know the person? &gt;&gt; Right? How many know of the big engagement this this past week? I only know because it was on Brother Lucas's Twitter account who's is in his status, but his gym teacher got married to his English teacher. And it's like, "No, sorry buddy. That ain't my gym teacher. That ain't my English teacher. I don't know who they are other than it's just always in my face." And we can know a lot of things about things and about people, but you don't really know them &gt;&gt; because you see the veneer. You see the polish, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we have to really catch ourselves in this in the time that we're living. What's being w what's being wasted away is the fact that we become less human. We identified people less as humans and more commodities, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you're also the commodity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and and we're looking for clout. We're looking for belonging and all of it's been is synthetic. Now I hope this is really hitting home &gt;&gt; and we in losing sympathy now even as Christians as we try to separate from that we have so commodities made commodities out of sin and the world and the flesh and the devil and all these things are so evil to where we don't have sympathy anymore for the lost. Wow. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam's telling the story. I believe it's a blind Barnameus. And he says that in all the rush and the hubb hubhub of everything that was going on, he got knocked over and fell down. And he's just dramatizing. He says one lady stopped, a follower of Christ stopped and said, "Are you okay? You got knocked down." He says, "People that follow Jesus have sympathy for people like that." Amen. &gt;&gt; That that that's kind of rip the needle off the record kind of statement where all of a sudden you realize that we have portrayed and allowed ourselves to be influenced by personalities that have brought us further away from God's sympathy and put us more in the vein of of arrogant uh uh legalism. People have suffered tremendously at that. When we as Christians, though we might blush at sin and there might be things that greatly offend us, as followers of Jesus Christ, we should have sympathy for the less fortunate. &gt;&gt; When we see the blind leading the blind, we ought not to uh adapt one another and say, "Oh yeah, what's up? They're about to fall in a ditch." &gt;&gt; No, you ought to have sympathy for them. If you're a follower of Christ, you sympathize with people like that. &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians 12 22 to 26, brother Ian, don't turn that into a drop or a sound bite or anything like that or your ringtone. Nay, much more those and and by saying that it's a done deal. Just share it with me. Nay, much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary. Remember this uh what we've been shared in this nakedness and this vulnerability and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable this necessity of evil lacking darkness void upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncumbly parts have we more abundant comeliness for our comely parts have no need no necessity maybe the strengths are obvious and the utility but God hath tempered the body together now here's this idea of one body having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked that there should be no schism division, separation in the body, but that the members should have the same care one for another. &gt;&gt; This is the body's sympathetic response. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it. How is how is does that happen? Because you're part of the same body. &gt;&gt; There's no division. There's no separation. We haven't taken all the ministers and all the ministers over the age of 35 get to sit at this table at Ryan's, right? why all the sisters and all the kids have to sit in this other section, right? And they're the ones that have to get all the all the food at the buffet bar, right? And the minister's over there just waving their dirty plate here. Fill this up. You know, the deacons are there protecting them. What? You create this dichotomy so much between classes of people in a church and they're no longer able to feel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; One of the biggest things I think worst things that could happen to a pastor is when he feel he forgets that he's a sheep, too. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't think his wool stinks cuz he doesn't even have wool in his own eyes, right? He He's not bothered at all. He's just so high above you. I'm the shepherd. You're the sheep. Ignorant little sheep. And it's like, and really what you ought to be hearing is a pastor who says it, you ought to be hearing Because that's what a pastor is. He's just like the sheep &gt;&gt; because Jesus Christ himself, the chief shepherd, is still yet a bloody lamb. &gt;&gt; And when one member suffers, we all suffer with it. Or when one member is be honored, all members rejoice with it. That's the body's able, the body's ability to sympathize. &gt;&gt; That when one part hurts, the other one hurts. Yes. &gt;&gt; And this is and wouldn't you want that if you're going to the your garden of Gethsemane, wouldn't you want to be able to look at somebody and say, "Could you watch with me?" &gt;&gt; And say, "Man, I know I know what you're going through. I'll be praying for you tomorrow when you go in for that test. I know I know what you're going through." Begin to be feel for somebody. Brother Brandham identified it quite often in these prayer lines that when he'd have ministers stand there to pray, he didn't say, "These are men of God who are so wellstied in the message of the hour that they know just at the right frequency to scream at that demon that'll cause him to run." &gt;&gt; He said, "These men know what it's like to be sick. &gt;&gt; They know what it's like to be weak. They know what it's like to be struggle." &gt;&gt; Sympathetic resonance. I I I I I think I'm gonna keep going. And if if it's long tonight, there's people who can sympathize with you. I I can sympathize with you. Sympathetic response with God is maybe one of the most powerful things we have as believers. Yeah, &gt;&gt; one of the greatest things we possess, and maybe I'm just taking a known principle and putting another label on it, but hopefully by doing that, it broadens your understanding of what it is you possess. When you have the mind of Christ, &gt;&gt; you have the ability, the tuning to God's mind, and you have the tuning now of human nature as it's being refined that makes you Christlike. &gt;&gt; And so, a sympathetic response with God is one of the most powerful, wonderful things we possess as Christians. In 1 Corinthians chapter 6:1 17, "But he that is joined into the Lord is one spirit." &gt;&gt; If we are yet but flesh, then we're one with the flesh. We identify solely with the flesh. But now, if you're joined in the Lord, you're one spirit. This is a tuning. This is a vibration. This is a feeling. This is a sensitivity. This is a discernment. And the sermon living, dying, buried, rising, coming. He says, "I'm so glad to know that he can be a found. He can be found amongst the brokenhearted. And in our sorrows, he's not one that would leave us. Maybe I should have put this up there, but I hope you're hearing the sound waves. In our sorrows, he's not one to leave you. He stands by us when all has failed and the last hopes of earthly reaching has come to its end. He's still God and he loves us. I think we think the exact opposite. We I think that when we get to the spot where we can't do anything else and all hopes is gone. It's at that moment that God's abandoned us, but because we've come to our end, it's at that moment saying, "God's saying, can I help now?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You know, hey, I I could have stepped in earlier, but I love you. I got confidence in you and I I I'm watching out over you. He says, "But when you're going through it, he's not one to leave us." He stands there when all is failed. Hopes have come to an end. He still loves us. He was the expressing of God. Think of Jesus Christ now. How I believe that he longs for his people to be so anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and troubles and scream and shout and dance and flail and pass out. Sorry, I sorry. We could go to each other in trials and troubles and give the expression of his sympathy &gt;&gt; as it pours from our hearts that's been born of his spirit to reflect in the church the love of the living God. &gt;&gt; And he refers to the poet that well expressed what the poet said living he loved me. &gt;&gt; Living he loved me. Now you living you living. He says I want to be so anointed with his spirit. Now I know that what that begins to do. There was a time in my life when I'd begin to read that and I'd say, "Watch out squirrels. You're coming." Right? We're going to be eating squirrel soup for months, right? You're just going to create it, right? I'm going to speak I'm going to speak a truck into existence. Bundles of cash right under my bed. It's coming. But he says, "Get so anointed with the spirit that you would enter into somebody else's burden and express his sympathy." &gt;&gt; How pitiful is that? That's not the John Wayne Jesus I want to serve. Come on. Let's go beat up the devil. But no, he says get to the point to where you could be so anointed where you give expression of his symphony as it pour symphony kuban as it pours from our hearts it's been born of his spirit &gt;&gt; to reflect the love of the living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12:12 12-4. For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being member are in one body, so also is Christ. You are joined to God in one spirit. For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have all been made to drink into one spirit. What is that experience? &gt;&gt; For the body is not one member but many. Uh I thought some of you maybe are well verssed in the body's own sympathetic nervous system. There's a Christ Christ sympathetic nervous system then for this body. &gt;&gt; In the same way that we have fight or flight and we have certain responses and that the body in response to danger there's certain biological processes that fire off for the preservation of life for survival. And so Christ has a sympathetic nervous system that is act. It's an activated unconscious response. That's what a sympathetic nervous system refers to certain body parts subject to the a common nervous system influence. If you're a member of the body, then you must avail yourself to that process. So anointed of the Holy Spirit that you can give expression of his sympathy. This is where the principle of actually being numb and not full of faith when you can't be moved anymore by other people's experiences. Man, I'm just so I'm so solid in the faith. I don't care what happens to anybody anymore. Just so grounded in the word myself personally that everybody else could just be dying and falling away and suffering and I'm just over there saying, "Thank you, God." Right? Well, there's that's not that's not faith. I I say this to comfort you that when when you grieve over somebody else's loss, when you feel the pain of something else, this is a Christlike response. Now, it's not nervousness and it's not panic and it's not doubt. And the sermon lean not to thine own understanding. And brother Benham says this in a number of different places from different uh aspects. There's times when he's saying this person over here has cancer and he says there's a dark line between them because this person over here has cancer of the same kind. He says what are they doing? They're crying out to one another. &gt;&gt; Right? What is that? That's a sympathetic response. He says that you might know that God is present. There's a lady sitting right next to her. And this was a woman from California. This is a woman with I believe with cancer. He said her name is Mrs. Harris. She's a total stranger to me. But when the spirit struck this woman, she also in sympathy with her. She had sympathy. And she comes from California and she's got trouble with her shoulder. You believe that God will heal you? If that's true, raise up your hand so the people can see. Total stranger. He says, "Lean not to your own understanding." What can do that? You can't explain that. That's a paradox. It's beyond explaining. &gt;&gt; Now, we could maybe begin to explain what happened between the one that had cancer and the other one had cancer. When this person was healed, something in her resonated, &gt;&gt; something responded and God saw the sympathetic response and in response to her response, she got healed. &gt;&gt; It wasn't in the way that he describes this in different places. It's not that the person just said, "Wow, this Mr. Brandom is so charismatic." When she saw that the spirit struck them and she received her healing. There was some sympathy. Maybe there was, "Oh, I'm so happy for you. I've got the same thing and God healed you." And in having the right response, do you realize that if we had the right response to somebody else's blessing, when you find out that this person's expecting, instead of say, "Well, I don't know if I'll ever have a baby." you find out this person's engaged like they got engaged and I haven't. This is a cruel world, but if you could find a way to rejoice in somebody else, God sees that kind of sympathetic response. Your blessings on the way. &gt;&gt; This may seem to be a unique scripture, but I I found this in the message of the hour and it just really really uh impacted me. In Acts chapter 3, I'll read the whole story from verses 1 to 10. Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer. This is after Acts chapter 2. They're now filled with the Holy Ghost being in the ninth hour. And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple. He is relying upon the goodness of people the alms and even their obedience to the word that would provide alms to the needy. Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms can I have can I have some money? And Peter, it says, "Fastening his eyes upon him with John." So he's letting this person know that he's seen. This is the opposite of what we do at a stop sign or a stoplight in Phoenix, &gt;&gt; right? Eyes straight ahead, doors locked, windows up. No. Is there somebody next to me? No. I have no idea. Don't see him. Right. Look straight ahead. But here Peter fastens his eyes upon him and said, "Look on us." Notice that that that look on us. I I see you. You see me. There's this connection that begins to take place. And he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have I give thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk." It may not look like it, but this is a sympathetic response. the need in this one who had been lame from birth was wanting alms. But Peter's able to get into uh into a greater sense of what his need was. And he says, I silver and gold have I none. And he's not lying. He's being honest. But what I have, I give you in the name of Jesus Christ. Rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up. And immediately his feet and ankles and bones receive strength. Feet and ankle bones receive strength. There's a verse for you, Brother Scott. And he leaping up stood and walked and entering with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God. And all the people saw him walking and praising God. And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at which had happened unto him. Peter had sympathy to this one. &gt;&gt; He didn't just kick a quarter into the the cup. He wouldn't even dismiss him. Well, if you had any faith to believe, you from around here, how many times did you see Jesus in the temple? Sometimes we could be so dismissive. Brother Brandham says in the sermon, without money or without price, this is speaking about Peter. He'd been to buy from him that had money and the joys of the wine of salvation. He had just come two or three days before that from Pentecost where something had happened. And the young man sprung with a great amen to it and looked into his face. What happened? the chain of sympathy, the compassion of him that said, "I have compassion on the sick." That same spirit had taken place in the old fisherman's heart. He said, "As far as money, I have none, but I got something that'll take its place a million times such as I have." What activated what he had? What became the channel through which the wealth he had, the riches he had, the power he had, what became the means by which that could re uh resonate with the sick to heal them? No posturing, no politics. No, we're better than you. No, we're the we are the ones that can lay our hands on you. But rather, it was such as I have. Brother Brandham called, as you can see here, the chain of sympathy where the compassion that Christ had, the sympathy that Christ had is now in the heart of a son of God who is human, who's been tempted, who suffered, but now has the spirit with it just as Christ would &gt;&gt; and he could have sympathy. In 1 Corinthians chapter 10 16 to17 Paul in talking about our communion says this cup of blessing remember in 1 Corinthians uh 12 he says we all drink of the same spirit now he says this cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ again these letters would seem to be quite striking if you didn't have a revelation of what he was referring to for we being many are one bread and one body many members, many callings, many different situations, many different struggles and trials, but we're still one body. For we are all partakers of that one bread. This is how we're able to sympathize with one another. Peter had to go to that fountain and buy that which had that had that honey and the joys and the wines of salvation. When he received that, there's a different experience now inside of him that allows him to empathize. We are when we are in Christ made to drink of the same spirit and eating the same bread. We become one sonic society. We become one. As we partakers of the one spirit and eat of the one bread, the Bible is saying as you read these scriptures, we coales and we combine into one loaf. We're bound and united to Christ. And therefore being bound and united to Christ, I'm we're bound and united to one another like a hundred pianos all tuned by the same tuning fork. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandon when he teaches on the Lord's supper, he said this Lord's supper and eating communion, it's a revelation that I'm a part of him and I'm a part of you. When people don't partake of it sympathetically, they heap conde condemnation on themselves. That's just Bible. In the sermon shalom, I like to read. It's lengthy. This wanting you to think about this sympathetic resonance. And I think it's multi-layered in terms of our response to the word, but now how's the word responding in us to the word, but now also how is Christ in us responding with other people? Maybe you could look at as I'm the one that's weak and I I've become a little inert and I I don't have any nothing's moving me and I I've become very uh uh stale in my experience. Oh God, I I need someone to resonate and quicken me. Brother Brandham says this, it's paragraph 180. He says, "Man could close his mortal eyes to earthly sight and live in the presence of Jesus Christ." When you see his word beat out in the great sympathy that we're living in now, changing remember brother called it a sympathy over and over again. &gt;&gt; And even though he comes later and he says, "Am I saying that right?" And and he says symphony here in a moment. But yet think of the application &gt;&gt; in the great sympathy &gt;&gt; that's beating now heart rhythm frequency vibration are you vibing with the Lord that's the subject of the next youth meeting the aura of Christ you must begin in the symphony excuse me he says symphony here now I'm doing it you must begin in the symphony the only thing you can do if you're in the symphony then you start you begin to get into the rhythm &gt;&gt; a sympathetic response. &gt;&gt; That's the way you do God. You don't stand off and look at it. You get into the rhythm of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's not be spectators when we come to church. Let's participate actively in the preaching of the word and the partaking in the communion a and the way that we fellowship one with another. Oh, it's so important that we not just come as a spectator. &gt;&gt; He says you get into the rhythm of it. How do you get in there? You're born into it. into the rhythm of the word. And when you become a part of that word, now come on, listen. You had to become part of the dance to get out of the dance. You have to become part of the ball game. Something you're interested in to get in the ball game, &gt;&gt; right? How many people go to these ball games and they could care less? Listen, for all those guys who are making fun of Swifties who fawn over Taylor Swift and act all crazy are the same ones with painted faces and Kelsey jerseys on going on Sunday just the same. He says to get into the ball game is something you're interested in. You get in the ball game. You got to become part of the word to know God's sympathy. &gt;&gt; His sympathy is when it's playing. You understand? You're marching with the beat of the time. &gt;&gt; You're watching for it. The works that I do shall you also greater than this shall you do. The last days, the great changing of time. We get into the beat of the word. Find his purpose. The hour that we're living in. Get into the rhythm of how he does it. If you get into the word, you'll find out how he did it at the beginning. Then you know how he's doing it all the time. &gt;&gt; Wow. Go keep reading these things. Get into it. It's very, very rich. Musicians, come. Let's stand to our feet. God's great sympathy. How do we become a part of it? When we get into the word &gt;&gt; and now that we're in the word, then we begin to resonate with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the only way that we know God's sympathy is then we begin to understand you're going to begin to relate to sinners differently. You'll begin to come to yourself in ways that's not just you being restored, but even those of you who at times were prodigal, those of you who are suffering from spiritual amnesia, you know what it's like to need to see a water tower. &gt;&gt; You know what it's like for someone to need to hear from God. Let's become more sympathetic. The devil would most likely, and I say most likely, the devil would want to twist my words and try to make it into something watered down. And it's it's advocating for spineless compassion and human sympathy. That's not it at all. is having the eyes of God to see someone as they are and the heart of God to be able to respond with sympathy such as I have. [Music] Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Our gracious heavenly father, tonight as we close this service and we'll perhaps linger just a little bit and worship you. I pray tonight that at the very least as I'm admonishing real solid believers here tonight, such a good audience. And perhaps it may seem that there is some emphasis on us becoming more sympathetic Christians where the word of God is resonating from us. We're so anointed with your Holy Spirit that we are now working in that chain of sympathy and that we can have your heart be used by you for the help and benefit of others. But Lord, maybe tonight in reality, what we need to feel is your sympathy for us. that when we failed and we've made mistakes and we've struggled and we found ourselves doubting and hurt, confused, we can believe at this very moment that you love us and you have not abandoned us in our sorrow. But you are waiting for that moment when we could just look up and be honest with you and say, "Lord, I really need you right now." And that broken and contrite spirit resonates and you sympathize with it. And you remember that time in the garden when it was watch with me, Terry with me. Could you just wait? And you know how hard it hurts to be abandoned. You know how hard it hurts to be rejected, to be confused, to be sick, to be hurt. And so you're glad to come to our aid. So Lord, I pray that your word, the rhythm of your word would be your heartbeat towards us, that you love us, that you're for us, that you're steadfast. And Lord, the more comfortable we can become in your sympathy, the better able we are to beat out that rhythm in our own lives and become that chain of sympathy for others. We're never going to be able to say to be your voice and see the lost saved if we're arrogant. But when we become sympathetic, Lord, may this great sympathy of your word continue to resonate in us. May we have this sympathetic resonance to your word, Lord. And then now as Christ's own body, a member of your body, may we then feel for others and even those in the body appropriately. We ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
