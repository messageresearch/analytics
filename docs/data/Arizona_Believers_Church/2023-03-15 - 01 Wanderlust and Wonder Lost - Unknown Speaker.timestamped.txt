[0:00] I believe you can all be excited tonight
[0:01] we have another installment of kids eat
[0:03] free
[0:04] and I know there's still a mystery and
[0:06] some Intrigue as to exactly what that
[0:08] means and I would I would want everyone
[0:11] to think about it especially those with
[0:13] Children what the concept of kids eat
[0:15] free is and maybe even go back over some
[0:17] of the sermons that we've ministered
[0:19] under this installment but based upon
[0:21] how the Lord has burdened me tonight and
[0:23] maybe for a few other services I wanted
[0:25] just to bring this back to our
[0:26] remembrance some of the things we
[0:28] mentioned last year it's probably been a
[0:30] while since we even referenced it kids
[0:31] eat free and the concept of kids eat
[0:33] free is that a restaurant would
[0:35] advertise it that if with the purchase
[0:37] of an adult entree and so the parents
[0:39] are paying but the kids are eating free
[0:41] that's the idea to get people in the
[0:43] restaurant to eat so however you want to
[0:45] think about that in the spiritual
[0:46] context you have that Liberty to do so
[0:48] but here's just another installment
[0:50] connected with the concept and the uh
[0:52] the series we were calling or segment we
[0:56] were calling kids eat free now my title
[0:59] tonight this is introductory just an
[1:01] introductory sermon on this subject is
[1:04] wonderlust and wonder lost and there
[1:08] might be a little bit of a play on words
[1:09] there for some of you I mentioned a
[1:10] Title Here recently to Elizabeth and she
[1:12] said you know whatever you do stick with
[1:14] what doesn't get lost in the translation
[1:16] and I'm not doing that tonight this
[1:18] could very easily get lost in the
[1:20] translation but the title is wonderlust
[1:23] and wonder loss and its potential series
[1:27] as I've been studying some things the
[1:28] Lord's been dealing with me on a number
[1:30] of different levels so it could be the
[1:32] beginning of a potential series but as
[1:36] we speak tonight I always just I yield
[1:38] to the Lord however he would want to
[1:39] bring it out there's times when maybe I
[1:41] feel that it's going to be a lot of dry
[1:43] teaching and the anointing just kind of
[1:45] grabs a hold of it and it comes out a
[1:46] little bit different manner than maybe I
[1:48] was thinking and there's other times
[1:49] when maybe I'm expecting things to be
[1:52] very maybe corrective and hard and the
[1:54] Holy Spirit just takes a hold of it and
[1:56] is able to bring it out in the way that
[1:57] he wants to so we're completely yielded
[2:00] to him in whatever manner that he would
[2:01] want the word to go forth but some of
[2:04] the scriptures we're going to use
[2:05] tonight and even some of the themes I
[2:07] think are often used in a very
[2:08] corrective way I don't want to say
[2:11] condemning way or a harsh way but just a
[2:13] corrective way where it's addressing
[2:15] something that's wrong and when I use
[2:18] them I by all means I want the Holy
[2:19] Spirit to correct where the correction
[2:21] needs to be made but I want it to be
[2:23] inspirational
[2:24] I want to be inspirational way to
[2:26] encourage us and I want to use the
[2:29] introduction tonight maybe just laying a
[2:31] lot of different pieces out there as I
[2:32] often do when I start a subject I have
[2:35] to kind of get my material out in front
[2:37] of me and then for the future Services I
[2:39] feel comfortable in just pulling from
[2:40] those different things to build but I'm
[2:42] hoping tonight we just use this as an
[2:44] introduction to provoke some thought and
[2:46] I think already the title has you
[2:48] thinking
[2:49] maybe one person okay I'm getting a nod
[2:52] just identify yourselves so I can face
[2:55] you tonight at the expense of everybody
[2:58] else who's already experiencing
[3:00] wonderlust and wanting to aimlessly
[3:02] travel home
[3:04] but wonderlust and wonder loss I was
[3:07] trying to find maybe a thesis statement
[3:08] to share with you at the outset so that
[3:10] you don't you're not sitting back
[3:11] waiting too long to kind of catch the
[3:13] thing but it's finding Wonder In Christ
[3:15] in the age of wonderlust
[3:17] and being able to find wonderment in
[3:20] Christ in an age where people are so
[3:22] restless and cannot be satisfied I
[3:25] believe that we it would be good for us
[3:27] to begin to find Wonder In Christ if
[3:31] we've never found it I want you to find
[3:32] it for the young people for any anyone
[3:35] who's never found Christ to be wonderful
[3:37] I want them to find it if that Christ at
[3:39] one time was more wonderful at one time
[3:41] than he is now I want you to find it
[3:43] again
[3:44] in Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 he says For
[3:47] unto us a child is born and unto us
[3:50] the son is given
[3:52] and we know that this is referring to
[3:53] Jesus Christ and we know that the
[3:55] conception by Mary was a miracle in
[3:57] itself and very wonderful the Bible says
[4:00] Behold a young Maiden a virgin shall
[4:02] conceive and going to bring forth this
[4:04] child and so this announcement is uh
[4:07] prophetic but yet it's spoken in the
[4:08] present tense for unto us a child is
[4:10] born unto us a son is given and the
[4:13] government shall be upon his shoulders
[4:14] so there is uh this is a this is the
[4:17] Messiah this is one who is going to have
[4:19] authority and Power in this the
[4:21] government being upon his shoulders it
[4:22] recognizes some God placing government
[4:25] into his hand it speaks of a king
[4:28] and then it says in his name Shall be
[4:30] Called wonderful there's some that might
[4:33] say it's wonderful counselor and use
[4:35] wonderful as an adjective a counselor
[4:37] but so many translations and even
[4:39] ourselves we recognize it that his name
[4:41] Shall be Called wonderful then it says
[4:43] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[4:45] father the Prince of Peace we know it's
[4:48] a con a paradox to have a child born but
[4:51] yet he's going to be called The Mighty
[4:52] God it's a paradox to have a child born
[4:55] and have his name to be the Everlasting
[4:57] father but yet it's true and it says his
[4:59] name shall be called that phrase his
[5:01] name shall be called it simply means he
[5:03] will be and that's something to the name
[5:06] Colin as we preached on it uh last year
[5:09] the the calling of a name and name
[5:10] calling how it's not just your name
[5:12] being uttered in the way that you were
[5:14] given by your parents but it says his
[5:16] name Shall be Called means he shall be
[5:18] wonderful
[5:20] and this word wonderful it means Wonder
[5:23] full of wonder it means Marvel a Marvel
[5:26] something that is marvelous something
[5:28] that's extraordinary even the way that
[5:30] he's described as far as the Mighty God
[5:32] the Everlasting father the Prince of
[5:34] Peace these are terms that would all
[5:35] cause some sort of um awe or thought of
[5:38] just the magnitude and how great he
[5:39] would be but something that is wonderful
[5:42] is extraordinary something that may be
[5:44] hard to understand it means to be
[5:47] marvelous
[5:48] and something to be marvelous it it has
[5:52] its roots in a Marvel is something and
[5:54] something is marvelous in itself it is a
[5:57] miracle Christ we could spend all night
[5:59] just talking about how wonderful he is
[6:00] Christ himself he is a miracle in
[6:03] himself if something is a Marvel it's
[6:05] something that causes astonishment
[6:07] it's something that would cause some
[6:09] sort of shock as we would say what I
[6:11] want you to think when I say uh
[6:13] wonderful and wonder it's something that
[6:15] would shock you to wonder is something
[6:18] that would be an amazement we might use
[6:20] the phrase Wonderstruck this is exciting
[6:23] and this Thrills me and this gets my
[6:25] attention and this something that
[6:27] energizes me when it says his name Shall
[6:29] be Called wonderful it means Christ is
[6:32] wonderful in his nature and his
[6:35] attributes and his manifestations he is
[6:37] something that is marvelous it's
[6:38] something that ought to cause
[6:39] astonishment
[6:41] and Jesus when he preached and in his
[6:43] early days of his ministry they were
[6:45] astonished the Bible says at his
[6:47] Doctrine it was something that shocked
[6:49] them something that caught them by
[6:50] surprise something that they would have
[6:52] been awe-inspiring
[6:54] this word that is used his name Shall be
[6:56] Called wonderful it's translated very
[6:58] uniquely in Judges chapter 13 verse 18.
[7:00] and the angel of the Lord said unto him
[7:02] why ask thou thus after my name seeing
[7:05] it is Secret
[7:07] that word means wonderful
[7:09] incomprehensible extraordinary
[7:12] its name is something you could just
[7:14] even track that through this name that
[7:16] no man knows and no man knows the father
[7:18] but the son and to he whom the son will
[7:21] reveal him there's this awe-inspiring
[7:24] concept about God how can I declare to
[7:27] you my name how can I tell you my name
[7:28] when it is incomprehensible when it is
[7:31] extraordinary where just a mere phrase
[7:33] cannot tell do it justice and how can me
[7:35] telling you an appellation or some sort
[7:37] of a phrase that's used to identify me
[7:40] how could that ever Encompass what I
[7:42] really am for it is wonderful passing
[7:45] our our imagination a wonderful Marvel
[7:49] something extraordinary something that
[7:52] causes us to be amazed or to shock with
[7:55] Wonder
[7:56] and I'd like to say this without
[7:57] spending too much time laying this part
[7:59] particular Foundation
[8:01] but it is the nature of Christ it is the
[8:04] nature of Christ to be awe inspiring
[8:07] and I believe that Christ being in the
[8:10] image of the invisible God in the Christ
[8:12] being the Revelation if I could put it
[8:14] this way Jesus Christ is the Living Word
[8:17] that makes God present
[8:19] so it's not just someone of History it's
[8:21] not just something of the future but
[8:22] even now Jesus Christ is the Living Word
[8:25] that makes God present and I believe
[8:27] that Jesus Christ can be the source of
[8:30] endless Wonder
[8:31] that Christ now when I when I say this I
[8:34] when you think of wonderment or
[8:35] excitement or awe and all these
[8:37] different adjectives maybe we use maybe
[8:38] they've been used of things that are
[8:40] natural maybe they're used of things
[8:42] that you enjoy and we might say oh
[8:43] baseball is a beautiful game and every
[8:45] time I watch it I'm always in awe of
[8:48] certain talents or gifts or the way that
[8:50] they play there might be things that
[8:52] inspire you when you go hiking and you
[8:53] see a sunset or you do certain uh make
[8:56] certain accomplishments there might be
[8:57] an excitement or a wonder that you're
[8:59] pursuing but I believe that Christ is a
[9:02] source of endless Wonder for the
[9:04] believer
[9:05] the Bible says in Exodus chapter 15
[9:07] verse 11 who is likened to thee O Lord
[9:09] among the gods
[9:12] who is like thee glorious and Holiness
[9:14] fearful and Praises doing wonders
[9:18] this is uh just honest questions in the
[9:22] rhetorical because there is none like
[9:23] him
[9:25] none can compare to him who is like thee
[9:28] and then it gives these different
[9:29] phrases glorious and Holiness fearful
[9:31] and Praises doing wonders different ways
[9:34] of saying in all that you are and
[9:36] everything that you do nothing can
[9:38] compare to you
[9:40] and I believe that God is a God that
[9:41] overwhelms that can overwhelm our human
[9:44] senses has anyone here ever been
[9:46] overwhelmed by the greatness of God
[9:47] overwhelmed by the goodness of God God
[9:49] is one that if you could catch just the
[9:52] tiniest bit of his nature just see any
[9:54] part of God even seeing him in creation
[9:56] seeing him in any way that expresses him
[9:59] in some uh minute or even just the skosh
[10:01] of detail God is breathtaking
[10:04] God is exciting
[10:07] and this is the truth that we could
[10:08] bring out through so many different
[10:10] scriptures
[10:12] that Christ is a source of wonderment
[10:17] now I want to introduce and Define what
[10:20] I mean by Wonder loss it's wonderlust
[10:22] and wonder loss by Wonder loss what I'm
[10:26] referring to is when we lose our sense
[10:28] of awe
[10:30] when we lose that reverential feeling of
[10:33] awe and excitement and amazement of
[10:36] Christ
[10:37] when we're no longer inspired by him we
[10:40] never have a sense of all about him
[10:42] maybe we could say that there's things
[10:43] about Christ that seem to become common
[10:46] or it doesn't quite do for us what it
[10:49] used to do at one time and if there's a
[10:51] way that you could relate to personal
[10:53] relationships or maybe personal
[10:55] interactions or things that you love in
[10:57] order to understand this but we're
[10:58] wanting you to consider that there's
[11:00] things about Christ that ought to be
[11:02] enthused in you and maybe there was a
[11:03] time when just the Bible and the word
[11:05] and and things of God were things that
[11:07] got you excited and you smiled about it
[11:09] and you could laugh you look forward to
[11:10] church you were excited to go and maybe
[11:13] just different things that can happen in
[11:14] your life and you say well that was a
[11:15] that was a time of of love and a time of
[11:19] thrill and things were taking place and
[11:20] it felt really really good but in the
[11:22] process of time it feels as if something
[11:24] begins to wane a little bit and you're
[11:26] you kind of get whether it be jaded or
[11:28] you just become numb or you become
[11:30] hardened whatever it might be you're not
[11:32] quite feeling the same way you used to
[11:35] about Christ and the things of God have
[11:37] kind of lost their their wonderment
[11:40] I want to use the children of Israel as
[11:42] an example
[11:43] of Wonder lost and I want to use it as
[11:45] they took as they left in an exodus
[11:48] and just use some different scriptures
[11:50] this particular scripture here combines
[11:52] the elements together so we'll start
[11:53] with Psalm 78 verses 11 and 12.
[11:59] and speaking of the children of Israel
[12:01] it says and forget his works
[12:03] and his Wonders that he had showed them
[12:05] marvelous things did he in the sight of
[12:09] their fathers in the land of Egypt in
[12:10] the field of zoen and we could read more
[12:13] in other scriptures and even just take
[12:14] you through the Journey of The Exodus
[12:16] the things he did in Egypt the things he
[12:17] did the Red Sea even the things that he
[12:19] did in the wilderness and how that God
[12:21] was always declared in his presence
[12:22] amongst the children of Israel despite
[12:24] opposition and difficulty despite uh
[12:27] maybe desires to go back despite maybe
[12:29] the concern for bread despite a lot of
[12:32] different things that may be naturally
[12:34] and humanly it would have been
[12:36] understandable if they begin to worry
[12:37] but God was always doing something in a
[12:40] wonderful way to get their attention to
[12:42] be able to say hey I believe he's with
[12:44] us even if it was just looking down at
[12:46] their shoes and recognizing that they
[12:48] never wore out even if it was
[12:49] recognizing Health that was amongst them
[12:51] and oh a promise of overcoming enemies
[12:53] and it says that they forgot his works
[12:56] and his Wonders that he had showed them
[12:58] when it says these wonders I I we ought
[13:01] to think just how extraordinary it would
[13:03] have been for all the Egyptians to be
[13:05] groping in darkness and the Israelites
[13:07] to see clear as day
[13:08] it would be remarkable because it didn't
[13:11] just say there was light in Goshen but
[13:12] it said the Israelites had it in their
[13:14] dwelling so wherever they it may have
[13:16] been if they were dwelling in the house
[13:17] of an Egyptian as a servant they had
[13:20] light with them and they could see
[13:21] differently than the rest that were
[13:23] around them these were tremendous
[13:25] Wonders that would have been rehearsed
[13:27] in the ears of the children and been
[13:28] rehearsed amongst themselves and as God
[13:30] brought them out across the Red Sea
[13:32] think about how awesome that was how
[13:35] awe-inspiring it would be to see the
[13:37] Pharaoh's Army get swallowed up by the
[13:38] Sea so when the Bible says they forgot
[13:40] his works and his wonders we're not just
[13:42] talking about someone testifying that
[13:44] they had a headache and now it's gone
[13:46] these are incredible things marvelous
[13:49] things did he these are the things that
[13:52] cause wonderment or astonishment these
[13:54] are the things that would have been so
[13:56] remarkable to them that would have
[13:57] caused them to say remember when
[13:59] remember when and the things that they
[14:00] could have looked at and recognized
[14:03] but now in Numbers chapter 21
[14:05] I found myself just getting lost in this
[14:07] today and wanting maybe to Veer in
[14:09] different areas but I'll just be very
[14:11] strict to some principles here to bring
[14:13] out but this journey to me is so
[14:15] striking and how that they it worked on
[14:17] them to cause them to lose sight of his
[14:20] works and his wonders and The Marvelous
[14:22] things that he did in other words this
[14:24] is how Israel's Wonder of God was lost
[14:28] as it says his name Shall be Called
[14:30] wonderful there should have been
[14:32] something that was always God was
[14:34] awe-inspiring to them as long as he
[14:36] whatever he was doing they should have
[14:38] been in awe of it
[14:39] and it says and they journeyed from
[14:41] Mount hore by the way of the Red Sea to
[14:43] Compass the land of Edom I want to come
[14:46] back to the land of Edom and what that
[14:48] would represent and the soul of the
[14:50] people were much was much discouraged
[14:51] because of the way
[14:53] and the people spake against God and
[14:55] against Moses wherefore have you brought
[14:57] us up out of Egypt to die in the
[14:59] wilderness for there is no bread neither
[15:02] is there any water and our soul lothis
[15:05] this light bread
[15:08] now it's not using light maybe in the
[15:11] way that we do about uh you know skim
[15:14] milk and or whatever it might be that's
[15:15] light light sour cream and things that
[15:18] are just light in the fat Department it
[15:19] says this light bread the bread that
[15:22] they were loathing was the manna that
[15:25] was daily falling from heaven
[15:27] and and this is where the children of
[15:30] Israel got that every day they woke up
[15:32] and there was Manna which means what is
[15:34] it and the rich oral tradition
[15:37] surrounding the Manna uh to the Jews
[15:39] they believed that the phrase using what
[15:41] is it that to whoever ate it was to them
[15:43] the thing that they desired the most and
[15:45] so this one person could eat it and it
[15:47] taste one way another person could eat
[15:48] it and taste another and and that's the
[15:51] way that it could have always been
[15:53] but they they came to a place where even
[15:56] though God is continually to do
[15:57] something that only God can do in
[16:00] providing them bread their whole
[16:02] perspective of everything had changed to
[16:04] her now says their soul lothith the
[16:07] supernatural bread that is daily falling
[16:11] this is an incredible condition to be in
[16:14] that as they come to a particular place
[16:16] in their Journey where God is continuing
[16:19] to give them what they need to sustain
[16:20] them day by day but their attitude
[16:23] towards it has changed
[16:24] and I believe that there's a lot here
[16:26] that I I just want to mention and get to
[16:28] uh to be able to go further in this and
[16:31] with with you that are here tonight
[16:33] being the mature Believers you are I
[16:35] believe that maybe you could you could
[16:37] think a little bit more broadly than the
[16:38] way that I referred to it but it says
[16:40] that as they traveled the soul of the
[16:43] people was much discouraged because of
[16:45] the way
[16:47] so the way made them discouraged the way
[16:50] he speaks of their manner of Life a
[16:52] manner or a habit
[16:54] but something in the way discouraged
[16:56] their souls
[16:58] it wasn't where they were going
[17:01] and it wasn't so much just the path they
[17:03] were taking though if you look at the
[17:05] way that they were going there's a point
[17:06] where God said turn northward and they
[17:07] could have just crossed right over him
[17:09] but they decided to go a little bit
[17:10] different route and so now as they're
[17:12] traveling they are going by the way of
[17:14] the Red Sea to Compass the land of Edom
[17:16] and it's as they go past this land of
[17:18] Edom that the Bible wants to say the way
[17:20] the soul of the people were discouraged
[17:23] because of the way
[17:25] the course of life you could even say
[17:27] the way that they were journeying the
[17:29] way that they were going
[17:30] but when it said the land of Edom this
[17:32] is what caught my attention
[17:34] they were faced with other descendants
[17:37] of Abraham
[17:38] these would been the uh come from Esau
[17:40] they would have been related to Israel
[17:42] and the Israelites through Esau as they
[17:44] passed by Edom there were certain
[17:46] declarations made in Deuteronomy chapter
[17:47] two about Edom that uh year to not make
[17:50] any alliances with them you you paid
[17:52] them for whatever they give you uh you
[17:54] were to they were to pass through it and
[17:55] they should and God said I'll put fear
[17:57] of them upon you you'll be able to pass
[17:59] through and so they had already been
[18:01] told how they ought to approach Edom
[18:02] they had delayed even that passing
[18:04] through and there's a lot of things that
[18:06] just go along with this but now as they
[18:08] pass Edom no doubt something about Edom
[18:12] influenced them
[18:13] something about the way and even the
[18:15] journey they had to take they're
[18:17] considering well what about these and
[18:18] what about those and what about what
[18:20] they do and and I want to use this even
[18:22] if even if we can't make the direct
[18:24] connection that Edom was specifically
[18:27] saying things to them and showing them
[18:28] things the Bible tells us that once they
[18:30] pat they're going to go about the land
[18:32] of Edom that their souls were
[18:34] discouraged because of the way and I
[18:36] believe it wants us to consider the
[18:37] example of Edom
[18:39] the Bible says in Genesis chapter 25
[18:41] verses 29 to 34
[18:44] and Jacob sod pottage he was maybe
[18:46] that's a good way to define cooking
[18:48] these days what do you do I'm just
[18:49] sodden pottage
[18:50] uh Jacob sod pottage and Esau came from
[18:53] the field and he was faint so here's uh
[18:56] Jacob cooking Esau's hungry after
[18:58] hunting and Esau said to Jacob I know
[19:01] you're familiar with this so we'll just
[19:02] read it the way the scripture is
[19:03] describing it feed me I pray thee with
[19:05] that same red pottage for I am faint
[19:09] therefore was his name called Edom which
[19:12] is red or Ruddy so he Esau is given this
[19:14] new name Edom based upon the pottage
[19:16] that he sold his Birthright for him and
[19:19] Jacob said sell me this day thy
[19:20] Birthright wow what what a what a heel
[19:23] grabber oh you're hungry you're about
[19:26] you think you're about to die tell you
[19:27] what I'll give you some of this red
[19:28] pottage if you'll give me your right as
[19:30] the firstborn
[19:31] and Esau said behold I'm at the point to
[19:33] die what prophet shall this Birthright
[19:35] do to me Jacob said swear to me this day
[19:38] now remember the Bible in Hebrews called
[19:40] uh Esau a profane person
[19:43] because of these things
[19:46] and Jacob said swear to me this day and
[19:48] he swear into him and he he sold his
[19:50] birth right unto Jacob
[19:52] then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage
[19:54] of lentils and he did eat and this
[19:57] phrase to me just stood out to me so
[19:58] much this this week
[20:00] he did eat and drink and Rose up and
[20:02] went his way
[20:04] this is this is the transaction just
[20:05] sold his Birthright and he saw eats
[20:07] drinks raises up and goes his way
[20:09] he says thus Esau despised his
[20:13] Birthright
[20:15] and the ancient Hebrew translation and
[20:17] the ancient text uh that they've uh from
[20:21] Jerusalem it says he despised his part
[20:23] in the world to come and denied the
[20:25] resurrection of the Dead
[20:27] this is quite a turn no wonder the Bible
[20:29] calls him a profane person there's a lot
[20:30] of uh there's some you know teachings in
[20:33] the Hebrew tradition and he went out and
[20:35] did five different things to profane
[20:36] himself and to violate God's covenant
[20:38] but says he did eat drink rose up and
[20:41] went his way and Esau despised his
[20:43] Birthright this is what rep Edom
[20:46] represents there's there's the eating
[20:49] the drinking going their way but this
[20:51] despising this disassociation this
[20:53] deprivation from the birthright and as
[20:56] the children of Israel passing by Edom
[20:58] it says their souls were much
[20:59] discouraged because of the way and they
[21:02] actually begin to detest and no longer
[21:04] enjoy and look forward to the wonderful
[21:06] things that God was doing
[21:09] and I believe that even for us as we try
[21:11] to make this relevant to us I believe
[21:13] that the way has a way of discouraging
[21:15] our souls
[21:16] there is a the life now as we enter into
[21:20] it and as we Labor Day by Day and we
[21:22] regardless of whether you're a student
[21:24] whether you're a parent whether you're a
[21:26] husband that's working a mother that
[21:29] stays at home all of us from the
[21:30] youngest that are here and able to
[21:32] understand my speech to the oldest that
[21:34] are here and able to endure we have the
[21:37] ability to relate to what I'm trying to
[21:39] say that there's just something about
[21:41] life and no matter how we live there's
[21:43] just a way of the demands and the things
[21:45] that get our attention that have a way
[21:47] of discouraging our souls
[21:49] and I want to say this and maybe come
[21:51] back to it later but this is where my my
[21:54] using this idea of Wonder loss begin to
[21:56] come so real to me and God confirmed me
[21:58] and it was so many different things that
[22:00] there's just a way that the way
[22:02] manipulates our senses causing us to
[22:05] feel a loss of wonder
[22:08] that if the CH that way is what
[22:10] discouraged The Souls of the children
[22:12] and as the way cause them to be
[22:14] discouraged and their souls are
[22:15] discouraged they're no longer moved by
[22:17] the Supernatural and their soul begin to
[22:19] load this light red and they actually
[22:20] wanted to go back to Egypt because
[22:22] something in their minds begin to tell
[22:24] them that it would be better in Egypt
[22:26] and so there was things about Egypt they
[22:28] must have been remembering quite well
[22:30] but there also must have been things
[22:31] about Egypt that they were forgetting
[22:33] quite easily
[22:34] because there ought to have been no
[22:36] desire to go back to Egypt surely they
[22:38] were better off wandering on their way
[22:40] to a permanent possession than
[22:42] languishing in Egypt under bondage but
[22:44] yet that's just how much their soul had
[22:46] been manipulated their minds have been
[22:48] manipulated and they they had the Wonder
[22:50] had been lost and now they find
[22:52] themselves wanting to go back to Egypt
[22:56] and I believe that this life has a way
[22:58] of manipulating our senses to cause us
[23:00] to lose a sense of wonder of the things
[23:02] of God
[23:04] like Esau the Israelites Israelites had
[23:07] lost The Wonder of what God was doing
[23:09] for them presently in sin and bread and
[23:12] what God had promised to do for them by
[23:14] giving them a possession in the Promised
[23:15] Land
[23:17] they they were they had lost and this is
[23:20] so important and I realized that now I
[23:22] had taken a few things out of my notes
[23:24] in terms of other quotes
[23:25] there had been a quote I was wanting to
[23:27] use
[23:28] I think it's from things that are to be
[23:29] where brother Brown says we're going to
[23:30] a real place
[23:32] I was wanting to use that in the subject
[23:33] of rewards he says we're going to work
[23:35] and brother man I was saying he's
[23:37] describing it in a way that we would
[23:38] describe the life we're in now and it's
[23:40] a real place it's a real place that
[23:42] we're going to
[23:43] and so
[23:45] that just like Esau in the moment was
[23:49] willing to sacrifice his future
[23:52] for a little bit of satisfaction he had
[23:55] lost respect for the birthright
[23:57] the fact that he was the firstborn if
[23:59] you just think in terms of The
[24:01] Coincidence of it or just the sheer fact
[24:03] that he was had another brother that was
[24:05] in the womb with him and to think my I'm
[24:07] the one with the birthright having just
[24:09] been born first that there could have
[24:11] been something that he always found
[24:12] comfort and in some uh position with his
[24:15] father and relationship that he had we
[24:17] feel like oh this is something to be
[24:19] treasured this is something that is
[24:20] worth something but then in some moment
[24:22] he begins to weigh it and says what is
[24:23] it to me if I die and uh oh it's not
[24:26] going to be worth anything to me anyway
[24:27] so I went ahead and traded it so Esau
[24:30] there was some sense uh what he had been
[24:32] able to be deceived that's the phrase I
[24:35] think I'm looking for he deceived
[24:37] himself into a transaction that was
[24:38] completely worthless
[24:41] it says he despised the birthright and
[24:43] so in that way Israel
[24:45] like Esau has allowed themselves in this
[24:48] place as we read it in numbers to begin
[24:50] to think well they're not even
[24:52] recognizing what God's doing and sending
[24:55] them Supernatural bread day by day to
[24:57] feed them
[24:58] and they're complaining about other
[24:59] things and complaining about this but
[25:01] there are so many other things God was
[25:02] doing to declare to him as present to
[25:04] them his presence and they were no
[25:06] longer in all what he was doing
[25:08] presently and they were no longer in
[25:10] Wonder of what he was going to do
[25:12] and bring them into the promised land
[25:14] and my thought to you is this if I
[25:18] repeat it over and over again I won't
[25:19] apologize we cannot lose our sense of
[25:22] wonder for the things of God
[25:25] there has to be
[25:28] if if in any way
[25:30] we have resigned
[25:33] to some sort of pattern
[25:36] or condition and we have just accepted
[25:39] if it be through the war of attrition
[25:41] are just having so long been in a
[25:44] certain way we cannot allow ourselves to
[25:47] just be resigned to a routine and say
[25:50] this is it
[25:51] this is just what we this is just what
[25:53] Christians do it's just the mundane it's
[25:56] just wow you just go and wow I don't
[25:58] enjoy it well you just go and I don't
[26:00] get anything out of it well you just go
[26:01] and and I don't feel the presence of God
[26:03] well it doesn't matter and this doesn't
[26:05] happen well it doesn't matter listen we
[26:07] we cannot allow ourselves to live below
[26:10] our privileges we cannot allow ourselves
[26:11] to be beaten into submission to the
[26:14] deceptions of the enemy let's not be in
[26:16] the mindset of an Esau let's not be in
[26:18] the mindset of Israel let's not lose our
[26:21] sense of wonder to where we just accept
[26:22] things as routine and we say well this
[26:25] is just it what I believe that can
[26:27] happen and this is my heart's crying for
[26:29] us as Christians is oh God awaken me to
[26:32] your Wonder
[26:33] awaken me to it let it be real to me let
[26:37] it be let me walk out every morning and
[26:40] see the man and say oh my goodness honey
[26:42] you won't believe it there's fresh man
[26:44] in the field
[26:46] even if it's happened for days and
[26:48] decades and decades still just beat this
[26:51] sense of it's still there
[26:55] there's something about the routine that
[26:58] the devil wants to just rub our nose in
[27:01] it
[27:01] and in doing so get us cause us to kind
[27:04] of lose a focus
[27:07] of the Divine
[27:10] the Bible says in Revelations chapter 3
[27:12] verse 16
[27:17] so then because Thou Art lukewarm this
[27:19] is the condition of laodicea
[27:22] and and I'm just kind of narrowing this
[27:24] down
[27:25] it says so then because Thou Art
[27:26] lukewarm
[27:28] and either cold nor hot I will spew thee
[27:31] out of my mouth this is the Judgment of
[27:33] laodicea lukewarm it's tepid
[27:36] and the word that's used there it means
[27:39] that there is they're sluggish or numb
[27:42] as you're studying again trying to get
[27:44] just New Perspective on it
[27:46] and it's definitely if you tie this in
[27:50] later on we'll come to it how that
[27:52] laodicea is kind of like the final
[27:53] product of something
[27:55] and as they come to the end and the
[27:57] church is coming to its end it's
[27:59] sluggish it's numb it's indifferent
[28:02] I I would that you either be hot or cold
[28:04] that there is whether we look at it as
[28:06] some sort of fervency or some sort of
[28:09] disdain I I would that you'd be in some
[28:11] some extreme and have a take on
[28:13] something and have an opinion that it
[28:15] care that it mattered but he says you're
[28:17] just kind of indifferent in other words
[28:19] you're not moved you're not excited and
[28:22] this is the condition of laodicea
[28:24] and the more that we realize now you
[28:27] realize just how remarkable is or maybe
[28:29] maybe remarkable is not the right word
[28:31] but I think more and more
[28:33] the the
[28:35] identity of this age is laodicea it's
[28:37] been Vindicated it's been validated
[28:39] we've never questioned it but the
[28:41] existence of it is more pronounced than
[28:43] ever it's people's rights
[28:46] and it's such an age of people's rights
[28:49] to where there's you almost have to be
[28:52] indifferent lest you take a tank you
[28:54] have a taker you have a position the
[28:56] chances are you're going to offend
[28:57] somebody
[28:58] but it's just the age it's the spirit on
[29:01] the age just wearing us down and
[29:03] overwhelming our senses and causes to
[29:05] become indifferent and it's not just the
[29:08] it's not an indifference towards Natural
[29:10] Things the indifference is towards the
[29:12] things of God
[29:14] and brother Branham says about the
[29:16] things of God he said it should thrill
[29:18] us
[29:19] should be fresh every day
[29:21] I know this may seem to be old-fashioned
[29:23] and they say well brother Aaron that was
[29:24] back in the days when they had all night
[29:25] prayer meetings it was then this
[29:27] happened that happened all that was
[29:28] before the seals are open whatever you
[29:29] want to say people are going to have
[29:32] their excuses but I trust that you left
[29:33] your excuses uh with The Neighbor Next
[29:36] Door and they're handling them they're
[29:37] dealing with them tonight at home and
[29:39] that you're here without an excuse and
[29:41] you're here without reasons to wiggle
[29:43] out of the the pressure of the word of
[29:44] God he says it should be fresh every day
[29:46] and you know what I would do if I was
[29:49] you I wouldn't judge Myself by that I
[29:52] would actually tell God that's your
[29:54] promise and if that's your promise
[29:55] deliver on it because I want this word
[29:58] to Thrill me I want this word to be
[30:01] fresh every day and instead of trifling
[30:03] with it and arguing with it and blame it
[30:04] on everybody else say Lord the prophet
[30:06] said this message should be fresh every
[30:08] day I want it fresh today I want it to
[30:11] fill me every day I wanted to be real to
[30:13] me every day
[30:15] so it should be fresh every day just new
[30:18] to us all the time just Thrills us to
[30:20] feed
[30:21] and feast on the word of God
[30:25] this is an old-fashioned outdated
[30:27] Antiquated ideology this is the truth
[30:30] this is this can be a present tense
[30:32] reality in the face of everything that
[30:34] exists in the world today and all its
[30:36] lights and glamors and shows and all ITS
[30:38] Technologies and all its bells and
[30:39] whistles and all the ways that it has to
[30:41] enthuse us and get inside our minds
[30:43] listen layover to see it at its peak has
[30:45] figured out a way to make touch every
[30:47] single bias point you have in every
[30:49] trigger you have and you're completely
[30:51] hooked up to it
[30:55] but the word of God should thrill us
[30:59] in the same way to the same measure that
[31:01] laodicea will find a way to to move you
[31:05] the word of God has a greater capacity
[31:09] but that's where the wonderlust comes in
[31:14] if we if the Wonder
[31:16] has been lost
[31:19] the wonderlust is any anybody here
[31:22] familiar with the terminology
[31:23] wonderlust
[31:25] Preston thank you
[31:27] you know I that there's it's a phrase
[31:30] that I think it's pretty common
[31:32] maybe it has a kind of a really charged
[31:34] lust and you say that maybe you get
[31:36] everybody kind of gets nervous on what
[31:39] what the subject's gonna be just that
[31:40] the lust there does speak about a strong
[31:42] desire but it's a strong longing or
[31:44] impulse towards moving about aimlessly
[31:47] and this in no way is directed to those
[31:50] of us who like to travel
[31:52] but there's some that like to travel
[31:54] just for the sake of traveling
[31:57] there's no destination in mine
[31:59] it's just they want to be out on the
[32:01] road they want to be out they just want
[32:02] to be ambling and roaming and moving
[32:04] around and that's what wonderlust is
[32:06] it's a strong longing or a four or an
[32:09] Impulse towards moving about aimlessly
[32:11] or roaming
[32:12] and it has a German
[32:15] roots and its etymology but so
[32:17] wonderlust is lust which is a desire
[32:19] appetite or inclination for one Doreen
[32:22] and the wondering this is the way the
[32:23] phrase is originally used though we
[32:25] could use wonderlust as oh I just want
[32:26] to go on a road trip or oh I just want
[32:27] to go hiking and see where to lead me
[32:29] but the wonderless I'm wanting to zero
[32:31] in on is how that it's a Lust For
[32:33] wondering and wondering is pointless
[32:35] movement
[32:37] it is irrational and irrational course
[32:40] where it's just this restlessness it's
[32:43] aimless Meandering aimless movement it's
[32:47] roaming or hiking or traveling and
[32:49] there's no goal in mind
[32:51] that there's no progress to except
[32:53] counting steps
[32:55] it's just it's really pointless
[32:58] this it's a Lust For wandering pointless
[33:01] movement
[33:02] this wonderless is a strong impulse to
[33:05] being aimless untethered without
[33:07] Direction
[33:08] and the way that I'm wanting to present
[33:10] it it's wonderlust and wonder lost
[33:14] and there's a way that these are working
[33:15] together
[33:17] and so in Ephesians chapter 4 verse 14
[33:19] just to pull a principle out for you on
[33:21] this now the the word of God is to be
[33:23] preached in love and God is giving gifts
[33:26] that can express to you the things of
[33:28] Christ that we can grow up and be him
[33:30] which is the head that we can there can
[33:33] be some maturity to come into the
[33:34] fullness of Christ it says that we
[33:36] henceforth be no more children
[33:38] and it uses this phrase toss to and fro
[33:42] and carried about with every wind of
[33:44] Doctrine
[33:45] so this is this is to me what would
[33:47] become this wonderlust is that if
[33:50] there's just some feeling you just
[33:52] follow it that there's some enticement
[33:54] you just pursue it and certainly that is
[33:57] the mark of immaturity this is the mark
[33:59] of children that whatever whatever kind
[34:01] of captures their attention in the
[34:02] moment that they're in it they want to
[34:04] go to pursue whatever desires driving
[34:06] them in the moment without much thought
[34:08] as to what the consequences may be later
[34:10] or what the task was in the moment that
[34:12] they ought to be doing it it's just this
[34:14] to and fro it's aimless it's rambling
[34:17] it's it's without Direction and it says
[34:19] carried about with every wind
[34:22] that's kind of even to me it speaks to
[34:24] that wonderlust just wherever the wind
[34:25] takes me and I just have a desire to
[34:27] move on and I just and it's not really
[34:29] directed and it's not a Visionary it
[34:31] doesn't have a goal in mind but notice
[34:33] what the source of inspiration it says
[34:36] in cunning craftiness
[34:38] so there is some influence through
[34:40] cunning craftiness and this deceit
[34:43] that causes ones to be to and fro to be
[34:46] aimless to have this wonderlust where
[34:48] there's always sense of dissatisfaction
[34:50] and always just trying to find the next
[34:52] the next thrill the next Adrenaline Rush
[34:55] that's kind of what I'm thinking I said
[34:56] this wonderlust is It's kind of chasing
[34:58] the dragon and well I remember what it
[35:00] was like when this happened you're just
[35:02] trying to find the next time that you
[35:03] could just get that
[35:04] come on it's good yeah but it's cunning
[35:08] craftiness and deceit that works to
[35:10] cause people to become Restless
[35:14] and have a wonderlust that is pointless
[35:16] or aimless
[35:18] and I mean this both in a worldly sense
[35:20] and a religious sense
[35:22] and I find that I find it for myself
[35:25] with the audience that's present here
[35:27] tonight I find that I don't feel
[35:30] the the need to address it in a
[35:32] religious sense that oh we've got these
[35:33] religious heirs and we're we're pursuing
[35:36] things religiously
[35:37] and and I don't know that it would have
[35:39] to be this drastic to those that are
[35:42] present here this evening this drastic
[35:44] admonishment you know to cut ties with
[35:48] the world but I I I I would say that
[35:51] you're in this
[35:52] you're you're going in the right
[35:53] direction and I'm just going to push you
[35:55] in that direction
[35:57] but let me just say that both in a
[35:58] worldly sense in a religious sense
[36:01] that this tossing to and fro and carry
[36:03] it about and there's this cunning
[36:04] craftiness trying to do just as it did
[36:07] to Esau and the children of Israel and
[36:08] just what I'm trying to say trying to
[36:10] cause us to lose our Wonder for the
[36:12] things of God and once the wonderful the
[36:14] things of God is lost it becomes
[36:16] wonderlust
[36:19] they were just we're just we're just
[36:20] moving after things and we're Desiring
[36:22] things and maybe there's ways that the
[36:24] what the with the loss of Wonder people
[36:25] just become stagnant they become stale
[36:27] they're unmovable they just accept
[36:29] things there's no even itch or desire to
[36:31] move on they just accepted defeat but I
[36:33] wanted us to think very broadly both in
[36:35] a worldly sense and a religious sense
[36:36] how that there's things that come and
[36:39] try to work against us to cause us to
[36:43] lose the Wonder for the things of God
[36:45] and this can be anything that diminishes
[36:47] the amazement and the cause to wonder
[36:49] for the things of Christ
[36:52] Jude 13 says speaking of these
[36:55] characters that are fit for punishment
[36:57] he calls them Raging Waves of the sea
[36:59] foaming out their own shame and this
[37:01] phrase wandering Stars
[37:03] to whom is reserved the Blackness of
[37:05] Darkness forever
[37:06] brother random picks up on this this
[37:08] concept of wondering stars in a few
[37:10] places I'll maybe share them at a later
[37:11] date but this wondering Stars it means
[37:14] roving
[37:15] misleading this is the wonderlust it's
[37:18] something that becomes a vagabond
[37:21] uh that you know any port will do
[37:24] right that that I'm I don't have any
[37:26] particular place I need to sell my goods
[37:28] I don't have any place I need to park I
[37:30] don't have any particular place I'm
[37:31] going just to vacuum on a one
[37:33] who's just tramping just wondering this
[37:35] is what's meant by that phrase wandering
[37:37] stars and they're being led into air and
[37:40] they're misleading because they're just
[37:41] roaming wondering aimless
[37:45] and there is a
[37:47] H let me just try to think of how I want
[37:50] to say this if you could turn to
[37:51] Revelations chapter 2 verse 4 I want to
[37:53] I want to go into this this verse here
[37:56] but let me I want to think of a way that
[37:58] I could express this to you
[38:00] uh to this point maybe as a halfway
[38:02] point
[38:04] this wonderlust
[38:06] there are forces now you you the way
[38:09] that you're feeling you say well this is
[38:11] the way I feel and this is the way I'm
[38:12] Desiring to act
[38:13] there are influences that are causing
[38:16] that
[38:18] and and we need to recognize that that
[38:20] the way you're feeling and I say this
[38:22] with Grace
[38:23] if you're not as excited about the
[38:25] things of God as you once were that's
[38:27] not you that's something doing that to
[38:29] you
[38:30] if you're if you're not praying as much
[38:33] as you ought to that's not you that's
[38:34] something doing that to you if you're
[38:36] not feeding on the word of God like you
[38:39] ought to listen this is Grace that's not
[38:41] you that's something doing that to you
[38:44] there are forces that are pushing these
[38:47] aimless Pursuits
[38:50] and it causes the loss of Wonder for
[38:52] things that are real
[38:53] things that are simple
[38:55] things that are of God
[38:57] I hope you catch this because as I said
[38:59] this is introductory and I'm not trying
[39:01] to hide anything but I want to be very
[39:03] careful that I I I that I say it in a
[39:06] way that you don't just hyper focus and
[39:07] even one example
[39:09] but if I could say this
[39:12] well maybe I'll just try to use an
[39:14] innocent example
[39:16] the first birthday that we ever
[39:18] celebrated my wife and I her birthday
[39:20] after we got married she wanted me to
[39:22] take her to Pizza Hut
[39:25] that's where she wanted to go eat
[39:28] and
[39:29] to that point that was something that
[39:32] she enjoyed and for her birthday that's
[39:33] where she wanted to eat
[39:35] now where she wants to go right
[39:38] because now her taste buds have been
[39:41] awakened
[39:43] and she's been she's been made aware of
[39:45] better things
[39:47] and now she can't go back to Pizza Hut
[39:50] right because she knows that there's
[39:52] something better
[39:54] right and this is now that's in a
[39:56] natural sense that once you've been
[39:58] awakened to something it's like hey do
[40:00] you want to go get pizza there's a pizza
[40:02] and it's like seriously
[40:03] Pizza Hut why don't we just go to
[40:05] Pizzeria Bianco and wait four hours it's
[40:08] worth it right or we might have
[40:09] somewhere or at least a regular nose
[40:10] right because it's like hey I've had the
[40:13] good stuff I can't go back to that
[40:15] now that's just that's just a natural
[40:17] example but it shows how the mind works
[40:20] that once the Flesh and once our
[40:23] feelings our taste buds our emotions are
[40:25] moved in a particular way you can't go
[40:27] back to the way that it was before
[40:29] and so there's a way that the world has
[40:32] begun to sensitize us and work on us to
[40:35] stir us up in an emotional realm and
[40:37] when that is more often exercise then
[40:41] the Soul then the thing that you're more
[40:43] conscious of is the wonderment that the
[40:45] flesh seeks which is the Wonder lost and
[40:48] you begin to lose your Wonder for the
[40:49] things of God and you're being pushed
[40:52] into things that seem to be more real
[40:54] and more animated and more exciting and
[40:56] the things of Christ seem too simple for
[41:00] you anymore
[41:02] like who would want to sit down
[41:04] and listen to brother Branham
[41:08] when you could put a VR headset on
[41:11] and immerse yourself in an alternate
[41:13] reality
[41:14] I would even go so far as to say some
[41:17] people don't read their Bibles or listen
[41:18] to the message anymore because there's
[41:20] too many charismatic message preachers
[41:21] out there that you can stream on YouTube
[41:24] and I said charismatic so I'm in no way
[41:27] including myself
[41:35] but let's ponder that
[41:38] forces
[41:40] that are pushing you into aimless
[41:42] Pursuits
[41:43] that cause you to lose a sense of wonder
[41:45] for things that are real that are simple
[41:47] and of God
[41:50] Revelations chapter 2 verse 4
[41:53] he says nevertheless I have somewhat
[41:55] against thee we've already read his
[41:56] complaint to a portion of his complaint
[41:58] to the laodicean church age you're
[42:00] lukewarm you're indifferent you don't
[42:02] care nothing moves you
[42:04] nothing excites you but this is the
[42:06] beginning of it he says nevertheless I
[42:08] have somewhat against thee because thou
[42:09] Hast left thy first love
[42:13] it means forsaken left means to leave to
[42:17] die
[42:18] you've left it dying
[42:20] so there's a process I think that's
[42:22] evoked in this thou has left thy first
[42:24] love you have left it dying
[42:27] you have failed to nurture it
[42:31] that love is something that's living
[42:33] and something that love is something
[42:35] that's really says you've left your
[42:36] first love and first means the chief the
[42:38] first in influence the first in rank and
[42:40] you've left it and the love it's the
[42:42] love that speaks in a very broad way the
[42:44] sagape when it speaks of a person to
[42:47] welcome to entertain to love dearly
[42:50] to be pleased with to be content with
[42:52] you left your first love you've left
[42:55] dying the thing that used to content get
[42:57] bring you contentment you've left dying
[42:59] the things that you were pleased with
[43:00] you left dying the thing that stirred
[43:03] you that you were entertained by and you
[43:05] desired to entertain there was you've
[43:07] left dying the thing that made you feel
[43:09] welcome and that you welcome think about
[43:10] how it was when you first begin to serve
[43:12] the Lord and how new things felt and how
[43:15] fresh things felt like I say Elliot I
[43:17] thought of you today and how he must
[43:19] have felt when he at that last Camp he
[43:21] said called me and said dad I got the
[43:22] Holy Ghost and just how fresh things
[43:24] feel and how new things feel and there's
[43:26] a way that some of us might be thinking
[43:28] even now oh I remember that and God help
[43:31] us if we have to strain to go back to
[43:34] those days when he's just as real now as
[43:36] he was then
[43:40] but they had lost love brother Branham
[43:42] uses it in a phrase not just left thy
[43:44] First Love they lost it
[43:46] and so the passion and feeling as they
[43:49] left dying their first love this passion
[43:52] and feeling begins to die out
[43:54] now I say this and I hope to maybe
[43:56] revive this subject in another service
[43:58] and come back to it because God is
[44:00] dealing with me very heavily even in the
[44:03] emotional realm husband the wife and
[44:05] Family's fathers to children
[44:07] that the love is there
[44:09] he says Thou have left thy First Love
[44:12] there the love is there but it hadn't
[44:14] been nourished
[44:17] it doesn't say your love is dead but you
[44:19] left it dying
[44:21] because no matter how real and strong
[44:23] love is if it's not nurtured it'll
[44:25] weaken and lose power
[44:27] this is a this is true of any love
[44:30] this is the true of our love for things
[44:32] this is true of our love for one another
[44:33] this is true of our love that we have
[44:35] for our children it's Truth for the love
[44:36] we have for our spouse if we let too
[44:38] many things get in the way and we don't
[44:40] do enough to nurture that love the love
[44:42] is there it just gets weak The Love is
[44:45] Real it just gets covered up with other
[44:46] things no matter how real your love is
[44:48] for your spouse no matter how real your
[44:50] love is for your children if it's not
[44:52] nurtured correctly it will weaken and
[44:53] lose power and your love for God is real
[44:56] and your love for God is there but with
[44:58] the wrong kind of nurture whether it be
[45:00] in the church that you attend or the
[45:01] things that you feed on the right kind
[45:03] of wrong kind of nurture will actually
[45:05] cause the fervancy of that love to
[45:07] weaken
[45:10] brother Branham diagnosis the Ephesians
[45:12] Church age through a lot of different
[45:13] ways in the church age book
[45:15] and he begins to speak I cut this quote
[45:17] down quite a bit just to be able to
[45:19] share how you're saying and remember how
[45:21] he he brings out this idea that one has
[45:24] a genuine experience and in the second
[45:27] generation it begins to die out by the
[45:29] third generation it's good gone and he
[45:31] said this speaks to the principle that
[45:32] God doesn't have grandchildren so the
[45:34] first generation is a genuine experience
[45:36] but by the time you get to the third
[45:37] everything dies out and and he then he
[45:41] kind of he's just wants to track that
[45:42] that in order to avoid that you need
[45:45] fresh experiences for each generation
[45:46] you can't just live on the prior one
[45:49] and now but then he says this about the
[45:52] current generation he says I don't say
[45:54] that some of them aren't right with God
[45:56] not for a minute do I say that
[45:59] now he's I think he's pointing out
[46:01] something that's very uh thought
[46:03] provoking I'm not going to say they're
[46:05] not right with God and when he says
[46:07] they're not right with God I'm not going
[46:08] to say they're not right with God I
[46:09] believe that he is at least trying to
[46:11] indicate that they've had an experience
[46:13] that they had a genuine experience as
[46:15] he's saying this is salvation Salvation
[46:16] is of the Lord this generation where the
[46:19] Revival fires begin to burn they're
[46:21] right with God but that he says he says
[46:23] not for a minute do I say that but the
[46:25] original fire has died down
[46:28] they're not the same anymore
[46:32] think about that
[46:34] they're still right with God
[46:37] but they're not the same anymore
[46:40] I want this to inspire you
[46:42] I I think that if I could just even say
[46:45] it in my own self that there's maybe
[46:46] this little bit of deceiving ourselves
[46:48] if it's cognitive dissonance I don't
[46:50] know what it is that wants to tell us
[46:51] well what I'm feeling this is actually
[46:53] faith and I think we touched on that in
[46:55] the series Nam is this Faith or am I
[46:57] numb but there's this idea that well
[46:59] this is the realm that I am that I'm in
[47:01] and this is just to mature love and and
[47:03] I'm just going by faith because nothing
[47:06] moves you anymore
[47:08] the message doesn't the word doesn't
[47:10] healings don't there's nothing that you
[47:13] can get excited about when it comes to
[47:14] the word of God and we say oh well this
[47:16] is just maturity I don't know about that
[47:19] I I I'm not going to say it's not I'm
[47:21] not going to say that you aren't right
[47:22] with God but are you the same anymore
[47:27] he says they're not the same anymore
[47:31] the fervent desire to please God
[47:34] there's your there's some tie-in too
[47:36] judgment Rewards
[47:40] and when we go maybe into the third or
[47:42] fourth part in this there's this
[47:44] connection to rewards that to me there's
[47:47] so the reward the concept of rewards is
[47:49] just so perfect he said the forever
[47:51] desire to please God the passion to know
[47:52] his word the cry for reaching out in the
[47:54] spirit all begins to fade
[47:57] and instead of that church being on fire
[47:59] with the fire of God it has cooled off
[48:00] and become a bit formal
[48:03] that's lost Wonder
[48:06] and as soon as you lose wonder it
[48:08] becomes wonderlust
[48:10] I could line up the quotes
[48:12] where brother talks about just how then
[48:13] they begin to go
[48:15] from Pillar To Post
[48:16] roaming around what are they trying to
[48:18] find the Wonder again
[48:20] and true there's times where they go
[48:21] somewhere it's corrupt they do this and
[48:23] it's not what they're looking for what
[48:24] are they looking for they're real
[48:29] Matthew chapter 24 verses 11 and 12 it
[48:31] says in many false prophets shall rise
[48:33] and shall deceive many
[48:35] this is both this is an ecclesiastical
[48:38] religious theological sense but there's
[48:40] also false prophets in the world today
[48:42] that are deceiving us through technology
[48:43] through social media
[48:46] and because iniquity shall abound
[48:49] the love of many shall wax cold
[48:52] iniquity is unrighteousness
[48:55] the wondering or deviation from things
[48:58] that are virtuous from things that are
[49:00] real unrighteousness is a deviation from
[49:02] truth and righteousness is truth
[49:03] perverted
[49:06] the just the wondering from it it's that
[49:08] which causes a cooling love
[49:11] if there's a leaving of the first love
[49:13] brother Ram says they left the first
[49:15] love of the word
[49:16] I know there's a way that we can make it
[49:18] so Technical and so sterile that while
[49:20] just one step away from the word of God
[49:23] and and we make a sound well if you just
[49:25] deny baptism Name Lord Jesus Christ in a
[49:28] technical sense in a very real sense
[49:29] those are the theological steps that
[49:31] people take to get away from God but
[49:33] what about the individual that's right
[49:34] with God but they're not the same
[49:36] anymore
[49:37] how is it that that love begins to cool
[49:40] off how is it that they find themselves
[49:42] with their what love is waxing cold it
[49:44] means just go getting cold getting cold
[49:46] The Embers are no longer hot
[49:49] brother Brandon when he preaches the
[49:50] sermon entitled The Seven Church ages in
[49:52] 1954. he said what's the matter at the
[49:55] Tabernacle so glad we didn't name our
[49:57] church a tabernacle
[49:59] he says a man ought to be didn't expect
[50:01] some real fervents on that but that will
[50:04] consider that a vote everyone's in favor
[50:06] of Arizona Believers Church
[50:07] he says what's the matter at the
[50:09] Tabernacle a man ought to be able to say
[50:11] when you meet a man okay listen to this
[50:13] all right
[50:14] those of you who are old enough to be
[50:16] awake I want you to be awake
[50:18] a man ought to be able to say a man or
[50:20] woman a son or daughter of God ought to
[50:22] be able to say when you meet someone he
[50:23] says amen is your Christian experiences
[50:26] when was it the dearest to you
[50:29] you ought to be able to say right now
[50:33] this is what we ought to be able to say
[50:35] again I want you to take this with a
[50:37] measure of Grace that when he says that
[50:39] it should thrill us and it should be
[50:41] fresh every day that this is what we
[50:43] ought to take is this is a promise this
[50:44] isn't an indictment this isn't God
[50:46] taking my temperature and I've got a
[50:48] favor this isn't God calling me out I'm
[50:49] being sick this is a prophecy and this
[50:52] is a promise that his word can be fresh
[50:54] every day his presence can be fresh
[50:56] every day and this is a promise and a
[50:58] prophecy over my life that I can be able
[51:01] to say when would your Christian
[51:02] experience the dearest to you right now
[51:05] it ought not took Harkin back to the
[51:08] days of Revival it ought not to be back
[51:10] at a time at a camp meeting it ought not
[51:12] to be when you went to this church
[51:13] you're the greatest moments of your
[51:15] Christian experience ought to be this
[51:17] moment
[51:21] and then he kind of brings in this
[51:22] retort well
[51:25] my best experience was back when I first
[51:27] got the baptism of the Holy Spirit when
[51:29] I come
[51:31] he says just say oh brother you've
[51:33] fallen from Grace
[51:34] that's right look has left thy First
[51:37] Love he's quoting from the scripture
[51:39] left thy first love
[51:41] showing that they had something in the
[51:43] beginning and had left it
[51:46] this is what he said about Revelations 2
[51:47] 4. an example that he now brings into us
[51:50] as Believers is that when we are asked
[51:52] what's the dearest moments of your
[51:54] Christian experience our answer ought to
[51:56] be this one right now
[51:59] that ought to be the way that we should
[52:01] feel about our church experience it's
[52:02] the way we ought to be feeling about
[52:03] about our relationship with the word of
[52:05] God when was it when was it the most
[52:07] Clarity and you go well I mean it's just
[52:09] so cloudy now let me think about this
[52:11] uh man you know I need to go back to my
[52:14] timeline
[52:15] let me go back and look at my post on
[52:17] Facebook
[52:19] and find when it was real to me let me
[52:21] let me cycle back through my comments on
[52:23] Instagram uh and see when I was getting
[52:25] a little bit more feedback from my post
[52:26] when was it clear to me he's saying no
[52:28] you ought to be able to say right now
[52:33] that there's it's something about the
[52:34] now this is the best
[52:37] it's
[52:38] I I just think that it should not bring
[52:41] any it doesn't bring any shame to where
[52:42] we've been at this if this where we are
[52:44] now is the best
[52:46] it's the way that it ought to be
[52:50] but the wonderlust
[52:52] if someone says what's the what's the
[52:54] what's been the best experience when was
[52:57] the experience the best for you it's
[52:58] like oh
[52:59] man I don't know
[53:01] it's the wonderlust
[53:03] it's the aimless what are you looking
[53:04] for you're trying to find something
[53:06] you're trying to find something
[53:08] he says they had it in the beginning
[53:09] they left it now once you've left it
[53:12] all you will be as aimless till you come
[53:14] right back to it
[53:17] and if I could say this to the young men
[53:19] that are before me the young ladies here
[53:21] the young people to all of us but I
[53:23] certainly have a heart for the young
[53:25] people in this age the young adults in
[53:27] this age
[53:28] uh to to
[53:30] for Christ to become a Wonder to them
[53:33] to become real to them be more real than
[53:36] the things that they see in this flesh
[53:37] but can I say this if there has been any
[53:40] sense of loss of wonder
[53:42] I I can we restore that
[53:46] can we restore our sense of wonder
[53:49] where we kind of shed the lukewarmness
[53:50] the indifference
[53:52] I think if I could I just a purpose in
[53:54] my heart that I would just follow
[53:55] however the Lord was pulling and
[53:57] wherever the needs would be
[54:00] but I think we just get caught up in so
[54:02] many so many so much of the polarization
[54:03] and the message
[54:05] so much of the criticism so much of the
[54:07] extremes
[54:08] that it just caught we just we just get
[54:10] indifferent
[54:12] well how do you feel about prayer lines
[54:14] well I mean
[54:16] how do you feel about them first you
[54:18] know like I don't want to have a take on
[54:20] it unless you know I'm the one that you
[54:21] mentioned the next time you talk to
[54:23] somebody else about it yeah you won't
[54:24] believe what he thinks about prayer
[54:25] lines but it's just like you almost like
[54:28] no matter what it is
[54:30] you have to do you just get beaten
[54:33] into submission even to take it the way
[54:35] this guy sees it or take it the way this
[54:37] other guy sees it or you just want to be
[54:38] like hey you know what I you know I just
[54:40] don't even
[54:42] and you know what that makes a lot of
[54:43] sense when it comes to politics
[54:45] right euthanasia write me debate me
[54:47] let's go for it you know you take a side
[54:49] you take a side let's let's hash it out
[54:50] and he said hey you know what I'm just
[54:51] gonna finish my turkey you guys you guys
[54:54] just if you want to talk about this
[54:55] there's a lot of things that maybe would
[54:56] be great just to bow out but when you
[54:58] can't talk about the word of God anymore
[55:01] and you get to the place where you can't
[55:03] mention this and you can't mention that
[55:04] you can't mention this and we just get
[55:06] indifferent what it does cause you to be
[55:07] lukewarm
[55:09] and whatever it is that's caused you to
[55:11] become lukewarm can we have our sense of
[55:13] wonder restored
[55:15] rekindle a waning love
[55:18] and I want to say this
[55:21] before we get to our closing quote
[55:24] if you want to rekindle a lost love if
[55:26] you want to restore a sense of wonder
[55:27] Begins by identifying those influences
[55:30] that are numbing you
[55:33] to the sensitivity to God's greatness
[55:36] you have to recognize when I mentioned
[55:38] earlier you still have the love but if
[55:40] you don't have the passion anymore you
[55:41] still have it but something did that to
[55:43] you if you don't want to pray that's not
[55:45] you something did that to you
[55:47] there's this conscious acknowledgment
[55:49] that's why I was going to use the
[55:50] scripture he says it to this Revelations
[55:51] chapter 3 where he says be zealous
[55:53] therefore and repent he says you're
[55:56] lukewarm you're tepid ah you're just
[55:57] indifferent I I don't even know that it
[56:00] it describes maybe on and off on and off
[56:03] it's just like man you're just you're
[56:05] just in the middle
[56:06] I can't tell if you know you don't even
[56:08] hate you don't even love you're just meh
[56:10] you're great you're just lukewarm you're
[56:12] muddy you're everything's just muddied
[56:14] up you're just indifferent
[56:16] and and if if there's this recognition
[56:18] he says be zealous in other words
[56:20] come out of that lazy Zone
[56:23] get out of that place of complacency and
[56:25] that's numbness and everything's just
[56:27] caught a common come out be zealous and
[56:30] the first thing we need to do is repent
[56:32] and that's a recognition that there that
[56:35] if I could say this and I know
[56:37] I know may seem very very simplistic
[56:40] but I I love being able to say it
[56:42] because I know it's true
[56:44] this message is awesome
[56:47] Christ is awe-inspiring
[56:50] there is not a greater thing in this
[56:52] earth than Jesus Christ there's not a
[56:54] greater wonderment there's not a greater
[56:56] miracle and I just have I have absolute
[56:58] confidence to say it in the in the face
[57:00] of critics and deniers or and whatever
[57:02] more whether it be agnostics or atheist
[57:04] I I can say this about Jesus Christ but
[57:08] then we ought to have this recognition
[57:09] that we repent of those things that have
[57:12] caused us to lose that sense of wonder
[57:15] for the things of God
[57:17] to recognize there's just things that we
[57:19] do in daily life in a repetitive habits
[57:22] goals things that we can pursue
[57:25] that just wear us down
[57:27] and train us
[57:30] to seek after other things instead of
[57:33] Christ
[57:34] and and I I sense it now to where I
[57:36] could say I could just say what you're
[57:38] thinking
[57:39] it's so hard
[57:42] to do the things that you know you ought
[57:43] to do
[57:45] so hard to pray it's so hard to read my
[57:47] Bible it's so hard to meditate on the
[57:49] things of God it's so hard it's so hard
[57:51] to find that or I try and it just
[57:52] doesn't excite me anymore I try and
[57:54] listen what you're trying to do is come
[57:56] right out of the sensitizing of all your
[57:59] senses
[58:00] through whatever it might be from the
[58:02] YouTubes to the switches to whatever
[58:04] else boy I could preach a sermon on
[58:06] getting the switch back in the home
[58:11] can I get a witness
[58:12] yeah I like this is write it down
[58:15] freshly inspired
[58:17] we need to switch back in the home
[58:20] but there's we come right out of having
[58:22] all of our senses energized and
[58:26] sensitized with all the things that are
[58:28] in the world or just even a few of them
[58:30] and then we we come right out of that
[58:32] that chamber right and then we just try
[58:35] to connect to the word of God it's like
[58:38] yeah church is just kind of boring right
[58:42] church is born hey you know what I
[58:44] guarantee you if if you're used to
[58:46] tick-tock
[58:48] I don't know how you get out of a tick
[58:49] tock but you you I mean your thumb can't
[58:51] move fast enough while I'm preaching
[58:52] right
[58:54] like move keep going brother Aaron right
[58:56] keep going until you find something you
[58:57] like
[58:59] and that's just if you think about that
[59:01] and this is where I'm just going to
[59:03] crack the door open and look at it we've
[59:04] become slaves to a dopamine cycle
[59:07] this is a true story I think this is
[59:09] where some you're like okay that
[59:10] Escalade quick because now this is
[59:11] getting real
[59:12] you don't realize it but it's the truth
[59:14] you've become addicted to a dopamine
[59:16] cycle
[59:18] and this is why wonder is lost
[59:21] and this is why it's wonderlust
[59:24] you're craving this brain chemical
[59:26] release
[59:27] with each new text comment like follow
[59:32] right
[59:33] with each new notification with each new
[59:36] achievement
[59:37] why else would an adult forsake the duty
[59:40] that they have to their children or to
[59:41] their job to play a game
[59:44] why else would they do it except the
[59:46] dopamine cycle
[59:48] that wants to achieve the next level
[59:51] that wants to get the next chest
[59:54] right
[59:55] that wants to achieve the next level
[59:57] that wants to get the star get the badge
[59:59] remember when Yelp well had you check in
[1:00:01] and you'd earn badges
[1:00:02] you'd just be in the parking lot start
[1:00:04] checking in at places right because you
[1:00:06] wanted the badge hey I got my liquor
[1:00:08] badge I just just happened to be next to
[1:00:11] the liquor store I was getting gas right
[1:00:12] didn't happen to me I'm dramatizing
[1:00:14] somebody else
[1:00:16] but that's just the you're chasing the
[1:00:18] badge you're chasing the Merit you're
[1:00:20] chasing the recognition and we say Hey
[1:00:22] you won't believe it I'm on level nine
[1:00:23] no way take it to the bank all right
[1:00:27] get a job with that there's nothing to
[1:00:30] it
[1:00:30] right I'm being serious it's wonderlust
[1:00:35] and this is what it's all because of the
[1:00:37] way that the bar the world is
[1:00:40] manipulating us and our attention span
[1:00:43] and our capacity for God has shrunk
[1:00:46] hello
[1:00:48] our attention span and our capacity for
[1:00:51] God has shrunk because the portal is
[1:00:53] closed off you've got a soul that can
[1:00:56] take it in
[1:00:57] you've got a soul that could feed on
[1:00:59] them in perpetuity there's a part of you
[1:01:01] that loves it enjoys it can live by but
[1:01:04] you've allowed your attention span and
[1:01:06] your capacity for God to be cut off
[1:01:09] because all that's shaped anymore is our
[1:01:11] emotions
[1:01:13] deep thought and deeper experiences are
[1:01:16] more difficult than ever
[1:01:17] I'm speaking the truth
[1:01:19] I know I'm standing on thus there thus
[1:01:21] saith the Lord deep thought and deeper
[1:01:23] experiences are more difficult than ever
[1:01:24] even nowadays the things that people
[1:01:26] call experiences are so shallow because
[1:01:28] it's just in their flesh
[1:01:31] just our mindless Scrolls this is the
[1:01:33] wonderlust Mindless scrolling
[1:01:36] meaningless Pursuits Wanderlust is
[1:01:38] robbedness of our Wonder
[1:01:43] and the Wonders lost I don't know if you
[1:01:45] could tell in that title slide
[1:01:47] I'm not trying to
[1:01:49] draw attention to my Photoshop chops but
[1:01:52] it's it's just crumbling
[1:01:56] the Wonders just fading away
[1:01:59] that's what's happening to us
[1:02:02] we've got we need to have our sense of
[1:02:04] wonder awakened
[1:02:06] and I want to say this to anyone here
[1:02:08] tonight who sees themselves as a leader
[1:02:13] I speak this to the heads of households
[1:02:15] I speak this to young men who have
[1:02:16] authority over their domain whether Mike
[1:02:18] have soon going to be married I say this
[1:02:21] to the fathers I say this to the mothers
[1:02:23] because
[1:02:24] you have the power to restore the sense
[1:02:27] of wonder
[1:02:28] to your children
[1:02:30] or to even give them the sense of wonder
[1:02:33] when you think about what these young
[1:02:35] men can do
[1:02:36] not only can they enjoy the things that
[1:02:38] have been done but they the things they
[1:02:40] can do and create and the world they can
[1:02:42] live in I mean think about it with
[1:02:43] Minecraft the world you can create and
[1:02:46] the engines that are out there they just
[1:02:47] updated an Unreal Engine the things that
[1:02:49] they can do these days
[1:02:51] it's so incredible
[1:02:53] to where the things that they're able to
[1:02:55] tap into in ways that they know that
[1:02:56] they can even begin to trigger certain
[1:02:58] Sensations even to the point where it's
[1:03:00] not just Audible and it's not just
[1:03:02] visual but there's going to be things
[1:03:03] that you can taste and feel and smell
[1:03:05] and hear and there's a way that they're
[1:03:06] going to be able to completely immerse
[1:03:08] the individual in a fabricated reality
[1:03:12] and when we think about what the world
[1:03:13] has to offer to our children and how the
[1:03:16] world just creates this hunger and it
[1:03:18] gets more and more and more where that's
[1:03:19] what enthusiasm that's what they want to
[1:03:21] see that's what they want to hear and
[1:03:23] that's what they want to listen to have
[1:03:25] them listen to the things of the world
[1:03:26] today and the music of the world today
[1:03:27] and then just try to play them the
[1:03:29] specials in church they don't have an
[1:03:31] appetite for it
[1:03:33] and I'm wanting you to recognize what it
[1:03:35] is and you think well how can I how can
[1:03:38] my child ever get excited about the
[1:03:40] things of God they can because God is
[1:03:44] greater God is more exciting it's just
[1:03:48] the truth of it and you as the the
[1:03:51] leaders within your home we have it I
[1:03:53] say this to my wife I say this as a a
[1:03:56] father and mother together I say this in
[1:03:58] the presence of my children I say this
[1:04:01] to you tonight as your pastor you can
[1:04:03] create and Quicken the sense of wonder
[1:04:06] for this message and the things of God
[1:04:08] in your home it's not a lost cause the
[1:04:12] ship hasn't sailed Christ is a Wonder
[1:04:16] and we can create a Wonder in our home
[1:04:19] for the things of God
[1:04:22] the sermon leadership
[1:04:25] this is where I bring it down to us
[1:04:28] as this leaders and there's so much more
[1:04:31] that we'll share
[1:04:32] well I just want to take a quick form
[1:04:34] formal poll how many would like for me
[1:04:37] to continue on the subject raise a hand
[1:04:39] okay I'll talk to those who didn't raise
[1:04:41] their hands later
[1:04:42] get feedback on that will be speaking to
[1:04:45] those that didn't raise their hands on
[1:04:47] hell fire and brimstone
[1:04:49] on Sunday evenings during the months of
[1:04:51] month of August
[1:04:55] in the sermon leadership everybody
[1:04:57] raised their hands as far as I could
[1:04:59] tell
[1:05:00] brother random says now to the children
[1:05:02] I don't know if you've caught this it
[1:05:03] just stood out to me when I was reading
[1:05:05] it this week and I don't know why it
[1:05:06] hadn't hit me with this much weight
[1:05:08] before now to the children and to the
[1:05:10] adults and all I want to make this
[1:05:12] little message just as timely as I can
[1:05:15] and as quick as I can
[1:05:17] my emphasis is on the timeliness he says
[1:05:19] and I want to take for text follow me
[1:05:21] I want to take first subject leadership
[1:05:24] follow and someone to lead leadership
[1:05:26] and follow me
[1:05:28] and he says I want to make this message
[1:05:30] just as timely as I can
[1:05:34] as he's here in October 1965 and he's
[1:05:37] preaching this to The Young and the old
[1:05:39] the children the adults he wants to make
[1:05:41] it when he says timely relevant
[1:05:44] he says and is quick and I don't think
[1:05:46] he's just talking about timing he wants
[1:05:47] it to be relevant he wants to speak to
[1:05:49] something that that means something in
[1:05:51] the day and age that they were living in
[1:05:53] and this principle now this is where I
[1:05:55] want to take this principle of the
[1:05:57] Unseen influences that are pushing you
[1:06:00] to wonderlust
[1:06:03] and pushing you away You've Lost Your
[1:06:05] Wonder
[1:06:06] so it's wonderlust and wonder lost and
[1:06:09] now you're being pushed to this there's
[1:06:10] influences worldly or religious whatever
[1:06:13] it is it's worldly influences this
[1:06:15] wonderlust in your life this aimless
[1:06:16] wondering and you've lost wonder is lost
[1:06:20] now doesn't matter to me which was first
[1:06:24] it's a wonder lesson a Wonder loss it
[1:06:25] doesn't matter if it's just one or the
[1:06:27] other you don't want to be in either
[1:06:28] state
[1:06:29] but think of how there's a wonderment
[1:06:31] that is lost
[1:06:33] and this Wonder lust which is just
[1:06:35] aimless just the flesh just this
[1:06:37] fleeting thing
[1:06:39] and I want you to connect it to this
[1:06:40] principle that he says of leadership
[1:06:43] so now I'm gonna skip a few paragraphs
[1:06:45] and he basically expresses this thought
[1:06:48] through Parenthood that you've always
[1:06:49] had someone leading you and he says you
[1:06:51] won the first Legend your steps was your
[1:06:52] mother because she's the one there at
[1:06:54] home he starts talking about fathers and
[1:06:55] mother and he does continue on in
[1:06:57] paragraphs 27 or 28 on those same or 26
[1:07:00] or so on these same principles he says
[1:07:01] now in paragraph 23 now somebody helped
[1:07:03] you
[1:07:05] when you first made when you made your
[1:07:07] first step
[1:07:08] and now catch this
[1:07:10] and your last step you'll ever make in
[1:07:12] life somebody will be leading you
[1:07:16] there's an influence in the first step
[1:07:18] there's always an influence and there's
[1:07:21] an influence in the last step if there's
[1:07:22] one someone leading at the beginning
[1:07:23] someone leading at the end it tells us
[1:07:25] right now where we are right now there's
[1:07:26] influences
[1:07:27] there's leadership
[1:07:29] he says see that's right I want you to
[1:07:31] remember that your first step somebody
[1:07:33] LED you
[1:07:34] and your last step someone will be
[1:07:36] leading you we have to be led parents
[1:07:39] leaders young men fathers in the home
[1:07:41] husbands moms wives the adults you have
[1:07:45] to be led
[1:07:48] says you know God likened us unto sheep
[1:07:50] and did you know a sheep can't lead
[1:07:52] itself
[1:07:55] maybe they're well if you the Sheep are
[1:07:58] such that if they're not cared for
[1:08:00] they'll they can die
[1:08:03] that's just it's just something about
[1:08:04] the nature of sheep if they get away
[1:08:06] from the shepherd their coats can grow
[1:08:08] so thick it'll blind them
[1:08:10] get caught in thickets they'll topple
[1:08:12] over they won't be able to feed
[1:08:14] so there's something it tells us there's
[1:08:16] something about the nature that God
[1:08:17] wants to give us as sheep that we rely
[1:08:19] upon the shepherd
[1:08:22] and unless anyone twists that
[1:08:26] Christ is the shepherd
[1:08:29] a pastor is only in type or allegory a
[1:08:32] shepherd
[1:08:33] because he's still sheep
[1:08:36] right
[1:08:37] the pastor is not in in reality typed as
[1:08:40] an intelligent human being leading a
[1:08:43] bunch of dumb animals
[1:08:44] whenever a man thinks that it's obvious
[1:08:48] right whenever a pastor thinks that it's
[1:08:50] obvious because he's the one that knows
[1:08:52] it all and you guys are just a bunch of
[1:08:53] dumb sheep making them look bad but a
[1:08:56] pastor is a sheep himself
[1:08:57] right and in case you can't get that
[1:09:01] through your head the only reason why
[1:09:03] Jesus is the chief Shepherd the Good
[1:09:04] Shepherd and the grape Shepherd is he
[1:09:06] became a sheep
[1:09:07] it's what it takes to make a Good
[1:09:09] Shepherd what it takes to make a chief
[1:09:10] Shepherd you have to be sheep so there's
[1:09:12] no way we're going to topple this over
[1:09:13] to where the pastor is somehow you know
[1:09:16] the raw raw guy it's leading everybody
[1:09:17] without needing to be led himself we
[1:09:19] have to be led you know God likened us
[1:09:21] unto sheep did you know a sheep can't
[1:09:23] lead itself
[1:09:24] he'll wander away and stray away and he
[1:09:27] just can't lead himself
[1:09:29] and he has to have somebody to lead him
[1:09:38] maybe we'll have brother blessing come
[1:09:40] sing rain on a tin roof
[1:09:43] when we close
[1:09:46] but crack if you could just look at this
[1:09:49] the the maybe I could have broke this up
[1:09:51] a little bit better but that's second
[1:09:52] last sentence and he has to have
[1:09:53] somebody to lead him if I could say this
[1:09:55] you will be led by something
[1:09:58] you're going to be led by something so
[1:10:02] the shepherd is supposed to lead the
[1:10:05] Sheep
[1:10:06] now that was back in the days of the
[1:10:07] Lord Jesus he was the Good Shepherd that
[1:10:09] led the Sheep but today now notice how
[1:10:12] he just touches on it and I'm just going
[1:10:13] to wrap this up but today you see we're
[1:10:15] living in another day everything has
[1:10:17] changed and perverted
[1:10:20] you know what man has to lead sheep
[1:10:21] today a goat
[1:10:23] and you know where that goat leads them
[1:10:25] right into the slaughter
[1:10:27] then little sheep don't know where
[1:10:28] they're going so that the goat goes up a
[1:10:30] pin up at the slaughter and the Sheep
[1:10:32] don't know no more than to follow a
[1:10:33] leader so it leads them right up to this
[1:10:36] Slaughter and then the goat jumps over
[1:10:38] the track and the sheep goes in and gets
[1:10:40] killed
[1:10:41] see the goat a wrong leader
[1:10:46] I if I could say this I desperately want
[1:10:48] to close don't be a goat
[1:10:51] okay let's not be goats and let's not
[1:10:54] follow goats
[1:10:55] I know this runs contrary to everything
[1:10:57] we've been taught about being the
[1:10:58] greatest of all time
[1:10:59] but don't be a goat
[1:11:02] right don't be the one that's the wrong
[1:11:05] leader
[1:11:06] don't be the one we can get so
[1:11:08] frustrated with our children and I think
[1:11:09] maybe I've gone completely too far
[1:11:10] tonight maybe just in length toward this
[1:11:13] becomes a lot more practical than just
[1:11:14] the inspirational part but we've got to
[1:11:17] recognize the forces that are leading us
[1:11:19] and drawing us and it's the goat that
[1:11:21] caused us to lose our wonderment of
[1:11:23] Christ because we're wondering where the
[1:11:25] goat's going to take us
[1:11:26] what could it be where is he going oh my
[1:11:29] goodness this is amazed this is so
[1:11:31] awesome right
[1:11:33] you're running to the slaughter
[1:11:37] a goat's the wrong leader but Jesus the
[1:11:39] Good Shepherd who led the Sheep he he
[1:11:41] led them to life and held their hand and
[1:11:43] see somebody has to lead the Sheep
[1:11:46] I say that let's let's pursue Christ
[1:11:49] that with everything that is in us as
[1:11:51] the Bible says to us in Isaiah chapter 9
[1:11:53] verse 6 in his name Shall be Called
[1:11:55] wonderful Christ This Good Shepherd
[1:11:58] Christ this Chief Shepherd if he will
[1:12:01] just turn our eyes to him he is
[1:12:03] wonderful he is not just called
[1:12:06] wonderful he is wonderful he is
[1:12:08] awe-inspiring he is a miracle in himself
[1:12:11] he's the unending never ceasing to amaze
[1:12:14] us God and if we could just take our
[1:12:16] eyes off the goats we can recognize that
[1:12:19] he still Thrills us today
[1:12:21] that I take it as a promise not an
[1:12:23] indictment it could still be fresh every
[1:12:25] day he can still thrill my soul my
[1:12:28] Christian experience can be at its peak
[1:12:30] today
[1:12:32] for his name Shall be Called wonderful
[1:12:36] Brothers if he could come to your
[1:12:38] instruments
[1:12:39] I was reading this scripture and I'll
[1:12:41] share it with you to close in Psalms 119
[1:12:44] 18.
[1:12:45] open thou mine eyes
[1:12:48] that I may behold
[1:12:51] wondrous things out of thy law
[1:12:54] that's right let's make that our prayer
[1:12:56] open up my eyes Lord
[1:12:59] then I may behold wonderful things
[1:13:02] awe-inspiring things amazing things the
[1:13:05] shocking things
[1:13:06] thrilling things
[1:13:09] from Thy Word
[1:13:12] to where I could read the Bible and it
[1:13:13] Thrills me
[1:13:18] don't even charge
[1:13:20] has no battery
[1:13:21] this is real technology
[1:13:24] this ink
[1:13:26] don't need to charge it
[1:13:28] don't need to update it
[1:13:31] you never open it up and get a blue
[1:13:32] screen of death hey you know it it never
[1:13:36] just Cycles off while you're using it
[1:13:38] because it needs to update
[1:13:40] I haven't got a notice
[1:13:42] from God that he's not supporting it
[1:13:44] anymore
[1:13:46] and it just seems it's just a book
[1:13:48] the words are sometimes weird English
[1:13:51] but you know what it could thrill you
[1:13:54] just as much as those graphic novels the
[1:13:56] world puts out
[1:13:58] it could thrill you just as much as the
[1:14:01] things that are on this Thrills you
[1:14:03] can thrill you just as much as the
[1:14:05] things that are on this Thrills you
[1:14:07] if I need to I'll grab the laptop I'll
[1:14:09] grab the desktop just what what screen
[1:14:11] do I need to wave in front of you to
[1:14:12] compare it in reality Nothing Compares
[1:14:16] to what God can show you in this
[1:14:19] this message may seem old but it's still
[1:14:21] living
[1:14:23] and it's more applicable and more
[1:14:24] relevant today than even for myself than
[1:14:27] it was when I first gave my heart to the
[1:14:29] Lord
[1:14:30] why because it's Christ
[1:14:32] it's awe-inspiring and I would somehow
[1:14:35] someway as a church we could begin to be
[1:14:39] leaders
[1:14:40] that restored The Wonder of Christ to
[1:14:43] those who are hungry for it
[1:14:45] Christ is no longer a Wonder let's just
[1:14:47] be honest Christ is no longer a Wonder
[1:14:50] to a lot of people we love
[1:14:51] to a lot of people we know
[1:14:54] and it's not even of their own doing
[1:14:57] it's influences that have done it
[1:15:00] and if we're ever going to be
[1:15:02] forever going to be water towers that
[1:15:04] others see so they can begin to walk
[1:15:06] around in God's word and find their way
[1:15:08] back home we need to be wonders of
[1:15:10] Christ too
[1:15:11] we need to have our sense of one to
[1:15:13] restore we need to begin to make
[1:15:14] decisions in our daily lives where I'm
[1:15:17] not going to allow myself to be
[1:15:18] repeatedly bombarded with the things of
[1:15:20] this world because it's caused me to
[1:15:22] lose my Wonder
[1:15:25] and I'm on this wonderlust
[1:15:28] and my wonders lost
[1:15:30] and I want to say Lord open thou my eyes
[1:15:33] open up my eyes to see
[1:15:35] wonderful things could that be your
[1:15:38] heart's cry does anybody feel that with
[1:15:40] a passion tonight is there anybody that
[1:15:42] feels that this is real in their hearts
[1:15:44] that this just isn't this is not just
[1:15:46] emotion this is just not trying to find
[1:15:47] some sort of gimmick to get you worked
[1:15:49] up that this presses a button deep
[1:15:51] inside your soul that says this is
[1:15:53] something that that I could say I
[1:15:55] haven't been able to quite articulate
[1:15:57] and you're in the you're in the malaise
[1:15:58] of all the wonderlust and you're in the
[1:16:00] Clouds of all the wonderless and
[1:16:02] something is shouting beyond that
[1:16:03] something's crying out to you beyond
[1:16:05] that what is it it's a wonder
[1:16:08] it's a wonder it's Christ
[1:16:10] wonderful counselor
[1:16:13] the almighty God it's that God who's
[1:16:15] awesome he's calling to you fill the
[1:16:17] wonderlust I say open thou my eyes just
[1:16:20] see wonderful things
[1:16:23] get out my eyes Lord just see wonderful
[1:16:26] things
[1:16:28] open up my eyes to see wonderful things
[1:16:33] Lord granted for me Lord Jesus
[1:16:36] open thou my eyes to see
[1:16:39] wonderful things
