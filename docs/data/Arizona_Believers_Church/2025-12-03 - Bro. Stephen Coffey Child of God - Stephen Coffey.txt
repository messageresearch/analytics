TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Galatians the 4th chapter starting in verse one. Now I say that the heir as long as he is a child defereth nothing from a servant, though he be the Lord of all, but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father. Even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son. And if a son, then heir of God through Christ. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. You can be seated. Uh yeah, it's good to be here. I I I wanted to uh uh my my brother Andrew, I'm Andrew's brother in case you didn't know. And uh I know a lot of you, but not all of you. So I hope I hope we get to meet one another. But uh I was uh just thinking before the service and uh back there and I uh it it is so wonderful to be here with you tonight and and friends and family, but uh I'm I'm real honored to be here uh uh for brother Aaron and and I know he's sick and not feeling well. So I'm I'm really thankful that he gets time to rest. Uh pastors don't get a lot of time to rest. Uh, so I'm glad that he's resting and he's um he's not pushing himself and uh so I'm glad to do that. But you know, I have a an interesting perspective of brother Aaron. Uh we've known him, our family has known him for a long time. Andrew's been friends with him for a long time. But my first uh I was a little little boy when in in Dallas, Texas. First time I ever saw Brother Aaron. And um uh he comes through the front door and he has on a uh you know he looked real real sharp, real put together and he had a briefcase. I think he was still in law school if I'm not mistaken. And he comes through the door and I'm just a seven-year-old uh I don't even know how old I was. He was very very young, six, seven, eight. And just, you know, uh up to no good. And I was just looking at him, just looking at him up and down and I was like, "Wow, he's cool." And uh from that time on, since I was a young boy, I've been in in the front row looking up at brother Aaron, and I've seen um his his ministry grow all that time. And uh I I feel like I've had a a a front row seat. Uh and then now being here with you all is really special. Uh and I I think that's a testimony to what the Lord will do uh through an individual and that's a really special thing. So, I'm very honored to be here with you tonight and um I'm excited uh just to be able to share what's on my heart with you tonight. And I I love um I love Wednesday night service because we're all running on about 30% of our brain capacity. 30 25 35 uh% and we're we're tired. We've had a long a long week. Uh so if it's okay, I'll just be myself tonight and I just want to share something that has been pressing on my heart and uh I I've my heart has been at on on this passage of scripture I feel like the whole year and uh for whatever reason I I I've just been drawn to this passage. So if it's okay, let's just go through that tonight, Wednesday night. Let's relax, just enjoy being in the presence of the Lord and go through it together. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, I want to uh uh I want to just jump right in here and look at this passage. And if you have your Bibles, I want you to keep your finger there. I might jump to a few other scriptures here, but I I I want to just um dwell on this passage. And uh I was reading it even this morning and I I just think what a what a passage. What a what a string of statements uh that is being made here by Paul to the church at Galatian. Um I was thinking as as you as you're drawn to verse 7, wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son. And uh just all of us in this room, we all come from a mother and a father. Uh I hope so. If you did not, I'd like to see you after service. But I think we've all come from a mother and a father. whether or not you knew them and whether or not you had a good relationship with your mother or your father, whether you had a good upbringing by them or whether you had an amazing upbringing by them. We all have a mother and a father. And the amazing thing about this and about what is being discussed here by the apostle Paul is that I I uh as a as a as a son to my mother and my father. There is absolutely nothing that can be done to change that. I am my father's son. I am my my mother's son and I always will be. Try as they might have to have changed that. They it it won't change. I I am I am my parents son. I'm I'm I'm a member of the family. I just am. But what I have been drawn to with this passage is the implication that the child should not always remain in its infancy, but that it should become an adult, a functioning adult. So although I remain my father and my mother's son, which I always will be, and there's nothing that could change that, there's nothing that would change the the physicality of it or the nature of that. It just is. Even though that be the case, the scriptural implication is that I move from a child to a functioning adult with accountability, with responsibility, able to function as the Lord sees fit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nowhere in the scripture do you see the uh there is there an admonition to remain childish &gt;&gt; to to be immature. &gt;&gt; The the challenge the the implication is that you would grow up &gt;&gt; is that you would no longer remain a a child but you would be an adult while knowing you are a child. &gt;&gt; You you are a son. You are a daughter to your parents. That just is true. But the idea is that you would no longer be childish, but you would be grown up. &gt;&gt; It's an amazing thing. Now, the other uh thing that I I'm always drawn to and and just thinking about this, especially towards the beginning of this passage, now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, he deferth nothing from a servant, though he be the Lord of all. Now, I will tell you, uh, and I don't know about you, but I, like I said, I'll be myself and I'll just be personal and I'll be a little bit vulnerable with you tonight if that's okay. Uh, I sometimes in my life, we look at this passage of scripture and we think I I I see that, brother Steve. I I understand that yes, the scriptural implication is to become a mature functioning adult and not remain a child even though we are still the children of God. and he is our father. But what Paul is teaching is that we are no longer a servant but a son with inheritance. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you uh I in in in just my life um Peter refers to the hidden man of the heart, the hidden the hidden person of the heart. And every single one of us in this room, young, middle-aged, old, how, wherever you sit, wherever you lie, there's every single one of us in this room that is uh that person, that hidden person of the heart. Now, the Hebrews, they didn't have a term for the brain. Uh they just they didn't have a they didn't refer to the brain. They they referred to the heart as a man thinkketh in his heart. They refer to that person that is you. That that hidden person that no one else sees. The person that is really who you are. And that's who Peter was referring to. The hidden man of the heart. That that place that is very intimate. And that is a that is a place that is the person that all of all of you are. All of you have that that hidden person of the heart. And that person may or may not be spiritually healthy. You may be okay. You may not be okay. And the amazing thing about it is that pe the people around you may never know. They may never see that. &gt;&gt; They may pick up a few things and say so and so is acting a little bit different or you know I hope they're okay or maybe they seem like they're going through something. But really what's going down on the on the on the deep of the deep of the deep inside of you that hidden person of the heart that is the that is the person that the Lord wants &gt;&gt; as I walk in in in the light of the day and the message of the hour as a as a Holy Ghost fililled believer that's who the Lord wants is that hidden person of the heart the real you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that person has to deal with a lot of different things. Um, we know the avenues of of the spiritual realm that that Satan utilizes, memory, conscience, reason, all those different things. Satan has has access to that uh that person that is you. As a man thinkketh in his heart, brother Brandon was very clear that that's where the battleground rages is that that person and that person has to deal with a lot because memories aren't erased. Memories are a very physical thing. It is a it is a physical thing that happens in your brain that God himself fashioned and gave to you and the experiences that you have throughout your life. All the different things that every single one of you have done, the the vast difference of our lives here in this room. If we could all tell our stories, the places that we've been, the people that we've seen, our upbringing, who our father and mother were, how they raised us, all of that impacts the hidden person of the heart. And that person is who the Lord wants to get get attention. He wants intimacy with that person. He wants fellowship with that deep down person. &gt;&gt; But that deep down person is affected by so many different things. &gt;&gt; I was talking to um a young lady recently and um she was taken advantage of when she was a young girl um not once but three times. And uh she um she never told anybody and she she never felt comfortable telling anybody um because when she tried to bring it up um they dismissed it. And so there was never anybody that she she was not in a strong church. She was not in a healthy church by any means obviously. uh and she never felt comfortable opening up and and saying anything to anybody. So, she never did. And she lived uh all of her young life, she lived all of her young life carrying that in the hidden person of the heart, never being able to adequately deal with that, properly address it. And so she shoved that down and tried to to cope with the feelings of shame and regret and all the things that would accompany that. She felt at fault. She felt uh used. She felt dirty. And so her um when when you when you see uh scriptures that your father loves you and that you are valuable and that you are precious in the sight of the Lord, she she had to deal with that that feeling way deep down that nobody knew that she was dirty. And that may be true for somebody else, but that was certainly not true for her. And it was so intimate that nobody nobody knew. Nobody talked about that. But that's how she she came to church. She sat down. She did all the things. She she walked uh as as best a Christian life as she could, but there was still that that deep down feeling of shame and that that an awareness or um feeling that very few of us could ever truly empathize with that she was not really a daughter of God. even though she believed and she walked and she came to church and she had all all of that was happening deep down. I've talked to uh and you you can go through each one of your own stories and each one of your own lives and you deal with different things. You have so much that you carry with you. Failures, your own inequalities, your own concerns, your complexities, the the complexity that is you. And that person that you got ready, you fed, you you you dragged them to church tonight. You're sitting here and you're tired and you've got uh difficulties at work, difficulties in career, you've got questions, you've got um things that you're trying to figure out, sort through, not just for yourself, but perhaps for your family or for a friend or for whatever. and then you've got work things and then you've got all these and you're just you're just trying to to um exist somewhat healthfully. That's the person that the Lord wants to deal with intimately. That's that's the real you. The deep deep down, not the not the part that I see, although it's beautiful and it's pretty. It's the real deep down. That's who the Lord wants to know and to affect. And that's who Paul is talking about here in Galatians. &gt;&gt; I want you to um uh uh Paul is saying, I want you to understand that a a a servant, it defers nothing even though he is a child. He's thinking like a servant. And I want you to start thinking like a child of God. And I I um that even if you go to to Psalms 139 and I was reading that just the other day and we were talking about that uh in our church, you are fearfully and wonderfully made. And he says, "Thou hast searched me. Thou hast known me. Thou understandest my thought a far off." The Lord is is concerned with that hidden person of the heart. He is concerned with you. &gt;&gt; Personalize it now. Don't say, "Well, he's concerned with somebody else because they are more spiritual or they are something else." He is concerned with you as an individual. &gt;&gt; Every single one of you in this room, &gt;&gt; the Lord is concerned about you. There was a uh the I I always go back to um this thought in in Revelations chapter 4 and what the message of the hour is. And to me, the the the message of the hour and walking in the truth and in the light of this day is a voice out of heaven that called to me. &gt;&gt; It was personal. &gt;&gt; He called to me and he said, "Come out of h of her, my people, and and walk in newness of life." It is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Not in somebody else, in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in you, &gt;&gt; personalize it. And in that hidden man of the heart, that's who the Lord wants to speak to and to deal with intimately and personally and and cultivate and bring to a place of health. &gt;&gt; Not just existence or striving, but of health. &gt;&gt; As cheesy as it may sound, the Lord really does want you to be spiritually healthy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just existing, not just striving and and just going from one service to the next or feeling like you're you're not where you should be. Um uh uh and and striving for acceptance. If I could only maybe some of you, you have this idea of this spiritual titan that's out there somewhere that is you. Um at some point in time that you will eventually be. And when you're that person, then everything will be fine. everything will be um uh spiritually uh peaches and cream when I can become that that person that I I know I should be. But right now there's I'm not worthy. I I'm I'm not deserving of that. I'm not I'm I'm um and and you you exist in that place of just continually putting yourself down when that's not how the Lord speaks about you. &gt;&gt; The Lord says you are fearfully and wonderfully made. And that was true before you were formed, &gt;&gt; before your earthly bodies were here. &gt;&gt; The fact that the Lord David wrote that a long time ago that you are fearfully and wonderfully made and you know that if there's a deep that calls to the deep in in you, if you feel compelled to the Lord, that is not the devil. &gt;&gt; So if you are here tonight and you feel compelled to to um respond to the Lord, that is the Lord. There is a deep there because you're responding to the Lord. The devil would not put that in you or lead you to do that. That is the Lord that you would want to respond to the presence of the Lord and want to know the Lord more intimately. Deep down. That is the Lord who did that. And if that's the case, then you were in his mind before the foundation of the world. There's something there. You were you were his before you were you were formed in this fleshly body. So you are fearfully and wonderfully made before you were even formed. So therefore I had in mind for you in the future. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that you can you as old as whoever it may be? I want you to I want you to really uh understand. Do you understand that the scripture says that yet while we were in sin God came to you. &gt;&gt; It was while we were in sin that God came to you. and the mistakes that you've made and all the things that you've done uh uh do not diminish the fact that he said about you, he fearfully and wonderfully made you. &gt;&gt; You are fearfully and wonderfully made. But because of perhaps that unhealth that exists in the hidden man, we can exist spiritually like a servant and we can walk with a servant's mindset instead of living with the life of a son and daughter of God. So, as a result of of all the things that the enemy can do towards you or all the things that that maybe have happened in your life to to cause you to think, well, that's not me. I I'm not um I'm not worthy of of of Jesus Christ or the gospel or whatever it may be deep deep down now. And you think, well, I'm I'm I'm never going to be that spiritual titan that I want to be. I want you to understand that many of us and I'm speaking from personal experience. I just call it a testimony if you will that you're you're walking with a servant's rel. If I if I do this then the Lord will be pleased with very big difference because a servant in a home is very different than than a a child living in that home heir to all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A servant lives in the household to please the master. A servant lives in the household to please the master and on the basis of what they and on the basis of what they do. A child exists in the home because of who they do. A child exists in the home because of who they have me whether they like it or not. They have me of the life that I have now is that I so longingly want to be then everything will be fine. And you're living essentially you're leaning toward a legalistic mindset. Brother Vanom, he he and I said, Brother Vanom, he he and I I I don't have the exact phrase here tonight, but he said uh I don't have the exact phrase here tonight, but he said uh essentially something um essentially something um uh talking about legalism. And he said uh talking about legalism and he said a legalist will make you uh a legalist will make you uh can be done. That person didn't do this be done. That person didn't do this. that person a servant lives with a legalistic and a servant's mindset is a very unhealthy place to stay &gt;&gt; because all of us might be in that place but you don't have to stay like that &gt;&gt; because you're a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; So you can very quickly move from a servant's mindset to living the life of a son and daughter of God. A servant is um exists on the basis of what they can do. They strive and I'll be and I'll be honest with you that is exhausting honest with you that is exhausting. Now there's a different legalistic mindset which is a dangerous place to be because what what will very quickly um uh root in that kind of an attitude is a religious spirit and a religious spirit is the hardest thing to uproot and to get out of an assembly. you if I it should be called out and dealt with so quickly a religious spirit and it can happen so fast if there is a legalistic mindset um that that that is is is staying in you. It starts with you &gt;&gt; to say, "Well, that person isn't doing that and that person isn't doing that, but I'm doing this." And that's a that's a very unhealthy place to be. &gt;&gt; And you that that happens inside of you, a servants's religion. Now, that that thing and I I I believe this kind of servants religion to me is precisely what Paul told Timothy. They have a form of godliness and deny the power thereof because the scripture says that they would endure doctrine uh but not sound doctrine. &gt;&gt; And that's in a message church too. I don't believe he's just talking about denominational people and message people here. I believe he's talking about to an individual a person who can be even in a message church and think very um in a very denominational way. They can have uh uh they can um tolerate doctrine but not sound doctrine. &gt;&gt; They can tolerate it until it it it uh kicks against the pricks as Paul would say until it until it hits that very deep intimate place that you are guarding and it hits that place that you don't want to really open up. You don't want to deal with because you're trying to cope and you've you've coped with it for so long. If you kind of open it up, whatever it may be, uh an attitude, an issue, um a personal issue or or something that has happened to you a long time ago and you're trying to keep that down and you don't want to deal with it. It's a very uh it's it's a very exhausting thing to do to strive as a servant with a servant's mindset, with a servant's religion. It's utterly exhausting. And you try and you try and you say, "Well, if I could just if I could just overcome this." And so you try to overcome that and and you you understand that there's there's an effort that Paul says you've got to put into your spiritual walk. But the difference is putting your effort in with just your flesh without the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. &gt;&gt; How you move from a a son's or a a servant's religion to a son's life is you embrace Christ that is in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is, as brother Benham said, a bubbling well from the inside out. And you've got to run to that instead of embracing your sheer determination and your sheer will. When the Apostle Paul said, I it's not that I I um beat the air as nothing. He says, I get under my body. Whether it be something that you are trying to overcome, whether it be an attitude, a thought, something like that, you bring it into subjection and the obedience of Christ. You grab a hold of that thing and you you actually bring it subject to the obedience of Christ. Anything that would set itself against the knowledge of Christ. You grab a hold of that thing and bring it into the obedience of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's how you walk. That's how you live. Think on those things which are true and are pure. You actively do that. You you you die daily to bring yourself to that that action to that thinking. That is effort. That is what what Paul says to do. Not as one beating the air, but I get under my body so that I can bring it into subjection to the spirit that is within me. &gt;&gt; It is no longer I who live, yet though I live in the flesh, it is now Christ who lives in me. Paul in Galatians chapter 4 is speaking to Holy Ghostfilled people. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm addressing you who have been born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the hidden man, the memories that you carry, all of those things don't get deleted when you have the new birth. &gt;&gt; You carry those with you. &gt;&gt; There I think um brother Donnie Reagan preached a sermon years ago called scars. I believe it was called scars. I don't know what the title was, but he was saying those scars don't get deleted when you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I'm speaking to Holy Ghost-filled people this evening. All of you who have received a new birth, a supernatural change in your life. &gt;&gt; And now you are sitting in newness of life. There should be then no more condemnation. &gt;&gt; You should be free. You should have the mindset and walk in the life of as a as a son and daughter of God. In the very next few verses here in Galatians chapter 4, he says, "So then why?" He says, "How be it then, when you know not uh when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them. But now after the ye have known God, or rather are known of God." Very important passage. I'm reading in chapter 4 and verse 9. He says, "Now that you know God, or rather have been known of God," and that's the difference between a message believer and someone who is not, is that God knows you. He knows who you are. There's so many that would be there in front of him. Matthew chapter 24 and Jesus and they would say, "Have not we cast out devils in your name." We knew you. Why? I I knew you. I I served you. I I did all that I could. I strived to be a person that would be pleasing to the person of Jesus Christ. And he said, "But I did not know you." The difference between a a a person who has received a new birth, a message believer and someone who is not is that he [snorts] filled you. &gt;&gt; You did not get the Holy Ghost. He got you. &gt;&gt; He knew you. So now that you know God and rather have been known of God, why go back then? And he says, why go back again to the weak and the beggarly elements where unto you desire again to be in bondage? In other words, if you are heir to to of of Christ in all things and you now have the life of Christ and you are no longer a servant, but you are a son and daughter of God, why on earth then would you want to go back &gt;&gt; and live by the the beggarly elements, the the things that offer no life, which would be the flesh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then why strive with the servants's religious mindset of if I do these things then I will be okay. If I achieve this idea of spiritual titan that I want to be then I will be someone who be will be accepted by God when he said I knew you before the foundation of the world. You are a child because I I I knew you and your birth is a manifestation of that that that fornowledge. Your birth you were predestinated unto the adoption of sons. And the spirit that now works in you is it's no longer I who live, yet do I live. It is Christ who lives in me. So when Paul says, "Now I don't beat the air as someone who uh uh is is doing nothing. I bring that into subjection to Christ." He's talking about the hidden man of the heart. He's talking about the real you deep deep deep down that nobody here really would see. Your spouse may not even really know who you are deep deep down. You try to communicate and you try um uh uh because nobody has communication problems in their marriage, but you try to communicate and you try to share who that person is. But there's still difficulty in even sharing to your spouse who you really are deep down. What thoughts play out uh the the doubts that you may have, the thoughts that you have, the really intimate parts that only the Lord really knows. That's that's where the Lord wants to have fellowship with you is in the deep parts of your heart as a Holy Ghost-filled believer to really know who you are. And I'll be honest with you, the servants's religion, it comes from a heart that is unhealthy. I believe it really comes from a place that you're you're trying to hide. um you're trying to keep uh uh you've got such a guard up for whatever reason and a real surrender to walk with the spirit is is to open up that place to the Lord is to really allow the Lord to be intimate with you and say, "Lord, I'm I'm I'm unhealthy right now." Just to be honest with yourself. And this takes boldness. Come boldly before the throne of grace. And this takes boldness to say, "Lord, I I I I'm I'm struggling. I'm I'm I'm playing the part in church, but I feel like I'm striving for something that I can't achieve." And it takes resting in who you really are. And who you really are is not a servant in in the in God's kingdom. You are a son and a daughter of God. That's what the scripture says of you. But if you're coming at your walk or you're living thinking like a servant, then you'll never be at rest because you'll always be striving. If I could just do that or I shouldn't have done that. I got to I got to do this by my sheer will. Do you understand that by your sheer will you cannot give yourself eternal life? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is life. He is the truth, the life, and the way. &gt;&gt; And when Christ is in you, now you have the life, Christ in you, the hope of glory. And it is by that life now that you live. It is by the power of the life of Christ that is now on the inside of you that you can actually bring things subject to the obedience of Christ. That you can actually reach out and grab a a thought and bring it into the obedience of Christ. But the choice to do so is yours. Because the Lord does not take free moral agency away from every single person in this room now. The Lord does not take free moral agency away from you when you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. You still have it sitting in your seat tonight. You have the ability to choose to grab a thought and bring it subject to the obedience of Christ or to dwell on it &gt;&gt; and let it turn over and turn over and turn over. And you know what that is? Is maturity. &gt;&gt; The scriptural implication and all throughout the New Testament and all throughout the no old testament is that you don't remain a childish kid. You're a son. You're a daughter. That's by predestination. That is by election. You are a son and daughter of God with value. You are not a servant. You are a true son and daughter of God with value in the presence of God, able to come boldly before his throne. &gt;&gt; But you've got to be willing to surrender to him in a way &gt;&gt; where you are no longer thinking like the servant, but you're acting like a son &gt;&gt; to the point where milk can become meat. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I became a man, I put away childish things. Brother Bham, I've got so many quotes here. I'm just paraphrasing just for the sake of time here. So many different places, Brother Brandham would say, where we are in a season of ripening. Now, there's a difference between ripening and growth. And the bride is in a period of ripening. The sun the the seed will uh um lay out in the presence of the sun and ripen. fruit ripens and it is manifesting time. The fruit is on the vine. So here we all are in this room in the midst of le oysia as believers who the voice of God is directly called to which is the message of the hour. He's directly called to you and said come up hither. Revelations 4 1 and 2. It's a voice out of heaven saying uh come up hither. It's it's Revelations 10 8-11. We focus so much on Revelations 10:7, but Revelations 10:8-11, that's me. That's who I am. That's what the Lord has done in me. And as a result of that truth and that reality, I am in this room. You are in this room and we are together walking in the light as he is in the light. As a response to that voice in the in the final age directly to you as an individual, &gt;&gt; you've received a new birth. Now you walk in newness of life. And you are we are all all carrying that hidden person of the heart along with us and we have to grow up in a stage of ripening. Now the stock all throughout the church ages grew but the fruit ripens and that's where maturity comes into play. All throughout the scripture you see the implication of of of maturity of growth. And I'll be honest with you, sometimes as believers, we need to grow up. Uh my parents would say to me frequently, uh you need you need to grow up because what you're doing right now is not good. It is not wholesome. You need to stop it and you need to do what I've instead told you to do. And sometimes uh that um that was met with fierce resistance by my tiny brain. and uh and and thus uh there's a lot of conflict there with me. Uh and I I needed someone in my face to say what you're doing is destructive. Stop it. This is the healthy thing to do and this is the right thing to do. So do it. Whom the Lord loveth, he chastineth. &gt;&gt; So the hidden man of the heart, even though we've made mistakes, we're on the basis of free moral agency, he fills you with his spirit. Separation is implied by a member of the of of of the bride of Jesus Christ. Come out of her, my people. But we are not called to isolation. We are not Amish people. Right? We are we are called out of her, my people. We are filled with the spirit of the Lord and then turned right around and sent back into the world to be a witness and to be the an expression of who the person of the Lord Jesus Christ is to those in our community. Amen. &gt;&gt; I always look and I was saying this to the church just a little bit ago. If we are just a group of people that come in and have a wonderful service every service and then that's it and we have no expression to the community around us, then of what value is the church? &gt;&gt; Why don't we just get a a a um a a convent and just all exist in the building like the Amish? If you cannot express Christ to your very own community, then of what what value are you to it? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Lord filled you with the Holy Spirit and sent you right back out into the world to be a witness, to be a testimony &gt;&gt; just to express go the Christ to in your community. I believe all of our communities need to see you &gt;&gt; because for many that will be the only grace that they will ever experience. &gt;&gt; So let your light shine. Don't be ashamed of the gospel. &gt;&gt; You've got a wonderful church here. Let it shine. Your community needs you. &gt;&gt; But as a result, that that um maturing that milk to meet that is the implication. We are no longer uh um we have not I believe it's Romans chapter 8. We have not received the bondage again unto fear, but we have the received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." As a result of being Holy Ghost believers, the responsibility to the children of God is that you no longer be children tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, &gt;&gt; but that you be adults. &gt;&gt; In other words, you are able to understand this is the truth. Discernment is something that I believe is a gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is he will give every person who asks of it wisdom liberally. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we have situations where we need wisdom. Anybody have that? I'm not speaking about just the church. I'm speaking about you as an individual, your family, your marriage, all of the situations that you face in your career and at work. You need wisdom. You need to grow up. in addition to the church because a church is a living organism. It grows, sometimes it contracts, sometimes it get it gets unhealthy, sometimes it's in a period of growth. A church is an amazing thing. Sometimes it gets sick, sometimes it gets it's really healthy. Sometimes it's strong. Sometimes it's it's it's uh has vitality. Sometimes it doesn't. And it takes maturity to be able to weather those things and to think on those things which are pure. To be able to discern that's unhealthy. When you when somebody's talking to you in the lobby and you start to gossip back and forth, the ability the actual ability to say, "I'm not going to do that." &gt;&gt; Because a spiritually immature, and I'm speaking on a very simple level here, but a spiritually immature person needs the validation to say, "You know what? I heard this as well. So and so said something and I I I you know I I um uh uh brother William here I I don't like his shirt. So did you see the shirt that Brother William had? and then I'm going to go and tell somebody and I you know it's it's a really funny example because I do like your shirt but that happens so frequently and uh on in in some issues that can cause a real problem in a church &gt;&gt; and it takes individuals in the presence of the Lord to be really honest with themselves to say I'm not going to spread that. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop that in its tracks. You know, the best way to stop gossip is to say nice about that. Say something nice about the person that someone is saying bad about. It's it's so awkward because they're saying, "Did you see brother William's shirt?" And you can say, "Yeah, at least he had a shirt on." And they're thinking, "I don't know where to go from here." And then spiritual immaturity thrives off of off of um letting your guard down. And I I I I I look at this scripture and what it challenges me to do as a as a message believer filled with the Holy Spirit living in the midst of Leodysia. And it gives it challenges me on such an intimate level to stop thinking like a servant and stop trying to get validation and and and and tr strive and just to rest as a son and daughter of God and knowing that he who began a good work in me will finish it. knowing that I I I I am no longer uh uh um in bondage again to fear &gt;&gt; of boy I I I if I you know if I'm not spiritual enough then the Lord won't be pleased with me or if I don't if I don't you know um if I because I did this and I got to do this and this and this and this to make up for it and to exist in that kind of a lifestyle is exhausting when with the power of the Holy Spirit We are not bondage to fear. &gt;&gt; And fear is a valless element, but it's very powerful. There's nothing to it. Fear is nothing. It's it's the it's the the question that something may or may not happen. That's what anxiety is. It may or may not happen. I am anxious uh that I'll trip over this um uh monitor. It hasn't happened yet, but if I'm if I allow myself to be so fearful that I may do it, then I'm just I'm going to I'm just going to live in fear my whole life. And then I'm going to I'm just I'm I'm going to navigate all around it because I'm nurturing that thing that may or may not have happened. &gt;&gt; It's I I I'm I'm I hope this is okay because I'm being just sharing my heart very simple and straightforward, but I am shocked at the amount of individuals who allow themselves to exist in fear and anxiety. Holy Ghost-filled people that are crippled by anxiety and and fear and the and the the striving wi living with a servants's religion and say, "Oh, if God will only be pleased with me if I do this or I do that or if so and so likes me or if so and so doesn't like me." and they're not able to be strong and sure and and and live with the strength of the Holy Spirit. And the understanding that I will make mistakes and I have made many, but by the mercy of Almighty God, he has made me clean. &gt;&gt; He has created a clean heart in me. He makes my paths straight. &gt;&gt; He leads me to to to still uh waters and and green pastures. He is his goodness is is um it's inexhaustive. I I I can't exhaust his mercy to to me. And to be able to walk strong and confidently in that knowledge of your identity in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ that he has made you no more a servant but a son and a daughter. &gt;&gt; Amen. walking as a Holy Ghost believer, being able with the maturity and the and the desire to move towards maturity and to go through the process and to to allow the Lord to chastise you because whom the Lord loveth, he does chastise. He brings maturity. It's the process of ripening. It's the process of changing. And that's very difficult. I was I was studying the other day. I was I was looking at just different things and um I was just uh uh unrelated but I was looking at progress and if you ever look at progress it's an amazing thing because we think as progress as starting from point A and moving to point B and and moving in this in this direction but if you look at actual actually what progress looks like it it goes up and it goes down and it goes up and it goes down and it goes up and it goes down. If you look at um uh uh uh I I don't know um Edison, you look at Edison in in the development of a light bulb, the amount of money that Edison was spending trying to create the light bulb and he was going it was going down and down and down and from an outward perspective, the pro the the um uh uh the uh you know the way that that project was being handled, the amount of money that was being spent, there was no real progress in our eyes. You understand? And it was going down and down and down. I think it was,00 times or near there that Edison failed to make the light bulb. And it would seem like everybody was saying, "Eddie, let's cash it in. Just cut the losses. Let's move out of here. We're making no progress." And in actuality, every single failure was progression towards the light bulb. &gt;&gt; And then one day, the light bulb came on. &gt;&gt; Progress looks so different to us. And do you understand that the Lord is progressing you? &gt;&gt; You are changing. You are being molded. You are being shaped. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm not what I want to be. I'm not I'm not what I should be. But praise the Lord that I'm not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; He is slowly changing me. He who started a good work in me is finishing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is. You are here tonight by some means of of of mercy and grace. You you are here tonight. You you He hasn't let you go. You are here this evening. The Lord is working on you. You are being pro progressed. You are being matured. You are being worked on. The The Lord is fashioning the clay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is finishing the work that he started in you. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; But at some point, you've got to move out of the mindset of of a servant and living a servant's religion and start walking like a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; And what that looks like is surrendering to the Holy Spirit and being vulnerable with him and saying, "Lord, I I'm I'm struggling. Lord, I I'm trying to overcome this thing and I can't. Lord, I want to be the kind of husband that I want to be. I want to be the kind of wife that I need to be. I want to be the kind of parent that I want to be. But I can't. I need guidance. I need help. I I need I need uh guidance. I need uh uh your help making a decision, whatever it may be, and walking securely, knowing that you are an heir of all things. Now, just in closing, and I I want to just stop with this, but living as a son and daughter of God, how many of you believe you're a son and daughter of God? &gt;&gt; Living like that and moving away from a a servants's religion. Now, the reason I use that term servant religion is not only because Paul uses it, but because I was raised in a message church. And for the vast majority of of my young life, I had this mindset. I can strive. I can do things. If I'm doing the sound in the church or I'm doing the video in the church, then I'm, hey, I'm, you know, I'm I'm participating and I'm just going to strive and I'm going to try to do it. It took it took the Lord really getting a hold of me to understand that I could rest in his acceptance based on what he already made me to be before the foundation of the world and not striving for it. He already made a way for me to be his son. He already the the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world. I receive that gift of the Holy Spirit. He made a way for it. I'm not striving for it. &gt;&gt; It's mine. Every promise in the book is mine. To be able to walk in assurance and not fear. To be able to walk securely and strongly even in the midst of trials. Now, understanding that moving from a servant's mindset to a to a son and daughter of God does not mean that you're you're the absence of difficulty and trials. It means you're able to withstand them as a son, as a daughter, strongly, assuredly. &gt;&gt; I know my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; This situation that is before me, I will deal with it head on and appropriately &gt;&gt; and effectively. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether it be a struggle, whether it be something personal, whether it be your marriage, whether it be your children, whatever it may be, I'm going to I'm going to directly deal with this situation appropriately and seek the Lord for his help within it. Obeying the Lord out of love, not out of pressure. Pressure to perform. listening to the spirit, not the flesh, bringing those things subject to the obedience of Christ. Standing in authority and not not begging for permission &gt;&gt; to be able to stand like Joshua and speak directly to the son. &gt;&gt; It takes assurance. It takes a son's life and a daughter's life to be able to have the assurance to speak directly to the son to stand still. &gt;&gt; Amen. and not beg for permission, but to stand in the assurance of the word and in the authority of the word of almighty God that is in you. &gt;&gt; Growing into maturity by receiving correction, being able to receive correction. The biggest um uh roadblock to maturing effectively is your inability to receive correction &gt;&gt; to the point where the minister will say something. God will send minister after minister after minister and you'll just say, "Don't want to hear that. I don't like that. So, I'm just going to I'm going to spit that cherry seed out even though it's not a cherry seed." Right? We take the cherry seed, we spit it out. That's referring to wrong doctrine not in accordance with the word. That is not res that is not a cherry seed is not the Lord trying to get your attention because you are doing wrong. &gt;&gt; So don't spit that out and say, "Well, that's a cherry seed." You need to swallow it &gt;&gt; like an adult &gt;&gt; and and take that as correction. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Be able to receive correction. That's walking as a son and daughter. Because whom the Lord loveth, he chastneth. and your the your the main uh uh uh contributor to your maturing process and your ability to be strong and to be sure in your walk with the Lord is to be able to receive correction from him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Living in peace and not condemnation. I was looking the other day um uh at Joshua at Joshua chapter 5 and uh all throughout chapter Joshua chapter 5. It's a really interesting transition because all the time that they were in the wilderness and things like that, they had they they ate of the mana of the land and they were in the wilderness. They had not possessed the land. But then when Joshua comes into the land, things changed. And what happened was in Joshua chapter 5, and you don't have to turn there, but I'll just read it just briefly here because I'm coming to a close. He says, "And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the marorrow after the Passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day. And the mana ceased on the marorrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land. Neither had the children of Israel mana anymore, but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year." You know what is an amazing thing? And I just I stumbled upon that u um a while back and I just focused on that and I was thinking they went from mana to corn. We see so much about the mana and the goodness that God had given them the mana. It was a very supernatural thing. Now they began to grumble and complain about it and the Lord dealt with them very uh uh swiftly about their grumbling against what God had given them in their time of need. But when they were in the wilderness, they were living off the mana which was a daily sustenance. It went bad really fast. It was daily. It was daytoday today today. They had mana. They went and got it. If they didn't collect it, it would rot except for the um uh the the hidden mana that was behind. It was around the ark. It it it stayed fresh. All the rest of the stuff that the people were living, it went dead. It went bad every single day. They were living day to day and and and literally going out and striving for that. But when they came into the land, understanding Ephesians, Joshua, the possession of the land is you receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit and walking as a Holy Ghost fil believer. That is living in the land. &gt;&gt; Right? Once they left from the wilderness and possessed the land, the mana stopped. &gt;&gt; In other words, they started to eat from the corn. And you know what was the amazing thing about the corn is that it it it it it exemplifies permanent residence. There was no turning back. &gt;&gt; They were eating uh uh it was permanent possession. They went from asking every morning and and uh what they needed to owning the land that God had given them. They were planting. &gt;&gt; Now remember, brother Vandom was asked the question, "Will the bride have a ministry um you know and things like that?" And he said, "Well, sure. Go and plant the potatoes. &gt;&gt; Live like he's coming tomorrow, but go and plant the potatoes. In other words, the idea of your life focusing intently on your maturity and your growth is submitting to the life of Christ that is on the inside of you is literally giving yourself to the power of the Lord Jesus Christ that is in our midst. Let him do the maturing. Listen um uh listen to what he is trying to do. receive the correction that he is trying to give you. Uh be intently focused on that transition. When I became a man, I put away childish things and letting your mind be run to and fro by every wind of doctrine, but being sure and being strong. When they moved, when Joshua moved from the wilderness to the land, they were per there was permanence. There was maturing. I'm going to plant the corn. We don't need the mana is not not we don't need that dayto-day um uh striving anymore. We're here to stay. We are going to work the land that God gave us. Now you go back to what Peter referred to as the hidden man of the heart. That person that is really that that that person that is you nobody in this room really knows about. you can bring that that person before the Lord because that's who he's interested in. He wants the real you deep down. That person that you're you're probably perhaps really, I don't know, scared of. You're scared of of letting that go. Maybe you've got control issues and you're afraid of letting go and saying, "Lord, I I want you to search the inward parts." As David would say in um uh uh in in Psalms 139, possess my reigns. That means your temperament, the inner emotion, the deep parts of you. Let the Lord there. Because when you get to that level of insincerity and that depth of really coming before the Lord, that's where maturity begins to really take place. Because now you're no longer afraid or in bondage of fear, keeping that down or just tiptoeing your religious life, just tiptoeing by all of these different things. Now you're able to say, "Lord, you know me. I am known of you. Search me, oh God." Would you bow your heads with me? I want to stop right there. Musicians, don't you come? And I I think so many times about this passage. Wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son. Wonder if we can say the song. I have a father. And just with our our heads bowed and our eyes closed, I I think about this passage. I I'm not a servant any I'm not a servant. I believe it's John chapter 15. He says I I call you no more servants. I call you friend. So if you're sitting there thinking not me, brother Steve, you don't know me. You don't know what's deep down. You don't know how much I've pushed back. I I want you to just just for a moment take a break from that and understand that the Lord speaks very differently of [music] you than what you're you're seeing yourself as because he doesn't see you as a servant. [music] He sees you as a friend. He doesn't see you as a hired help in [music] his kingdom as a hired hand. He doesn't see you as someone who's he's telling go get me a drink. [music] He doesn't look at you like that. He looks at you as a friend. He looks at you as a son and a daughter of God. Thereby his grace and his mercy. He found [music] value in you because you were in his mind before the foundation of the world. You are valuable. I don't know how you feel tonight. Maybe you think, well, you know, I don't care. Maybe you're struggling with apathy. Well, then let the Lord deal with that. [music] Bring that to the Lord. Come boldly before him. Say, ' Lord, I'm just I'm struggling to really have that vitality of life as a son and daughter of God. Then bring that to him. Whatever it is, wherever you are at, bring that to him and say, "Lord, here am I. Deal with me. I I'm I'm I'm being I'm going to open myself up. I'm going to be vulnerable with you. [music] Deal with me. Speak to me. And let the Lord have his way. Let the Lord have his wonderful way. Whatever it may be, wherever he may want to go, allow him to go. Maturity begins [music] right there. And you are able to be humble. And before we [music] pray, humble is not saying, "Oh, I'm I'm I'm a no. I'm a nobody. I'm a loser." No. I think true humility is is saying, "Lord, no, I am a child of [music] God. You you fashioned the clay that I am. You made me who I [music] am. You fearfully and wonderfully made me. So I humbly bow before you, knowing that in my flesh [music] I can't become who I need to be. It is only by your spirit that I live." That is humility. Come to the Lord as he made you uh to be. He who began a good work in you is finishing it. He is continuing it. Heavenly Father, Lord, on this wonderful Wednesday night, we're all in this room. We're all gathered together. Lord, you've made every single person in this room. That's not a Sunday school cliche. That is a a an amazing thing that you made us and you brought us all here. All different kinds of of people, all different kinds of backgrounds. And in each one of us, there is a hidden [music] person of the heart. And that's who you're after. And you said, "Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together." Here we are assembled together in your presence. And I pray Lord that you would have the freedom and the ability to move through our hearts and minds and bring them both subject to the word of God so that we could come face to face with who we really are in Christ. And from identity, I believe, comes maturity. When we really know who we are, you can begin to use us more effectively. I don't want to I don't want to be someone always striving. I don't want to be someone who who has a servant's religious attitude, always striving and never feeling like I can attain. Lord, you've already made a way. I am your son. Here sit your sons and your daughters. Lord, I pray that as as the bride of Jesus Christ, we could stand in strength and confidence and assurance that we are [music] the redeemed, not in arrogance, not in pride, but in humility with authority to claim the victory that is ours. I pray that you would give strength to the weak. I pray that you would lift up the downcast. Have your way in us, Lord. I pray have your way in us. I pray in the name of the [music] Lord Jesus Christ we ask. Amen.
