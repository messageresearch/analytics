[0:02] today by the grace of God we want to
[0:04] speak on something I I believe that is
[0:07] very important
[0:08] in this hour and and
[0:11] you know there's a whole lot going on
[0:13] and
[0:14] if you ask the question in the religious
[0:16] ranks or in in a political rinks or
[0:20] whatever in the world how do we judge it
[0:22] you know and and the prophet kind of
[0:25] made it clear
[0:26] you know when you when you look at
[0:28] something or you judge something it's
[0:30] two things you can judge it by you you
[0:32] can judge it by the motive and objective
[0:34] what a man is trying to achieve and you
[0:37] can also judge it by its character
[0:40] and today that's kind of what we want to
[0:42] deal with the ingredients of character
[0:45] you know if you if you look at yourself
[0:47] and and you can't really say uh where we
[0:52] say this a lot you know when certain
[0:53] things happen you say well that's just
[0:55] not my character
[0:56] you know and normally when people say
[0:59] that it's they're standing against
[1:01] something that they pretty much don't
[1:03] want to do
[1:04] you know but the character of a thing it
[1:06] speaks on its own you don't have to say
[1:09] well that's just not my character your
[1:12] expression in the works that you do will
[1:14] tell me what your character is
[1:16] but if we look at character just wanted
[1:19] some definitions of character just to
[1:21] kind of lay out you know kind of where
[1:23] we're going character can be defined as
[1:26] a collective personality traits within
[1:30] our behavior that shows who we are amen
[1:33] so the behavior of a thing it can kind
[1:36] of identify the character of it amen if
[1:38] you take a lion Hallelujah a lion he
[1:41] doesn't bounce around on two feet
[1:44] no that's that's not his behavior you
[1:47] know a a a a lion there's something
[1:50] about it the strength of a lion that it
[1:52] just it just bears that it just oozes
[1:54] out it just comes out you know the way a
[1:57] lion hunt is different from the way a
[2:00] giraffe goes and eats his food why
[2:02] because the characteristics he's made up
[2:04] with and you know that's something that
[2:06] doesn't have to be taught as it grows
[2:09] and grows the characteristics of that
[2:12] lion it just comes out even when it's in
[2:16] a little kitten form the characteristics
[2:18] of his nature is already inside of it
[2:21] when it's a little kitten but as it
[2:24] grows and grows and that it eats and
[2:26] feeds and goes around it begins to
[2:29] develop the characteristics Hollywood
[2:31] where the characteristics of that lion
[2:33] begins to come out and you know if we
[2:36] look at the world today and we got
[2:39] churches all over the place we got
[2:40] preachers all over the place but what
[2:43] are we looking for we're looking for the
[2:45] true identity of God
[2:47] we're looking for the true
[2:48] characteristics of God
[2:50] but I kind of want to bring out the
[2:52] ingredients of this thing so we don't uh
[2:55] fall fall short look at that false
[2:59] prophets and false teachers and false
[3:00] christs because the prophet of God said
[3:03] when you said false Christ that means a
[3:06] false anointing
[3:08] amen for there to be a false anointing
[3:10] there has to be a true anointing but the
[3:13] two can be so close it can deceive
[3:16] Hallelujah not the very elect Hallelujah
[3:19] but it can deceive those who are so
[3:21] close looking at it they'll think it's
[3:23] real
[3:24] but what we want church we want to be
[3:26] able to identify something by the
[3:28] characteristics that is oozing that's
[3:31] coming out of it now what makes us
[3:33] different from denominational churches
[3:35] they have healing in their churches they
[3:38] pay tithes they have nice buildings all
[3:40] these things so what are we looking for
[3:42] there has to be some ingredients within
[3:44] our within us that separates us from
[3:48] them
[3:49] hey man the ingredients of our character
[3:51] amen and you know the uh the prophet of
[3:54] God he will say that character is a
[3:57] victory hallelujah it's not a gift so we
[4:00] look at the the the coming out of
[4:03] character something has to mold you into
[4:06] the place where I can see Christ in you
[4:09] amen if we look in the Bible we can see
[4:12] that there are some ingredients
[4:13] Hallelujah that shows a man's character
[4:16] and you know I kind of want to take two
[4:19] Prophets
[4:20] two prophets in the bible both were were
[4:24] considered to be true prophets amen
[4:27] but one was lacking some ingredients
[4:31] and the other one had all the things
[4:34] that God hallelujah were made up of the
[4:38] first one I want to use is a man named
[4:40] Balaam Hallelujah and Balaam we know
[4:42] that the Bible says that he was a man he
[4:45] was a he was a prophet of God even our
[4:48] Prophet said he was a true prophet he
[4:50] had contact with God he could go to God
[4:53] and pray and God will respond to him
[4:57] my church there are people hallelujah
[5:00] all over the Earth who will pray and God
[5:03] will answer their prayers but does that
[5:06] mean their bride material
[5:09] um
[5:12] we hear it all the time I'm here because
[5:15] God led me
[5:16] I did just because God spoke to me I
[5:19] heard the voice of the Lord so here I am
[5:22] what makes us different
[5:27] and keep in mind I'm not pointing a
[5:30] finger at anybody
[5:32] Hallelujah but I want us I want us to
[5:35] catch I want us to catch our true
[5:38] characteristics of God
[5:39] you know your character there's things
[5:42] about you that'll just speak out whether
[5:44] you want it or not and I can tell
[5:45] certain characteristics hey young man
[5:47] what's your name
[5:49] say it again
[5:50] villain
[5:52] rolling okay all right roll it
[5:54] I want you to catch this ball with one
[5:56] hand
[5:57] all right only one you can't use two
[5:59] only one
[6:02] all right let me throw it back
[6:04] I need two
[6:06] now I'm gonna step back a little farther
[6:08] you can only use one hand
[6:11] oh that's pretty good throw it back
[6:15] all right you can only use one hand all
[6:17] right you ready here we go everybody
[6:19] watching
[6:21] rolling did I say it right
[6:23] you ready to roll it
[6:26] oh all right did y'all see that
[6:29] now can we all tell they're rolling am I
[6:33] saying it right rolling is what
[6:35] right-handed
[6:39] why because the characteristics of him
[6:41] using his one hand he never switched
[6:44] hands but every time I throw the ball he
[6:46] used one hand and before he even got
[6:48] ready he took his left hand and buried
[6:50] it
[6:53] to show me what the characteristics of a
[6:56] right-hand young man
[6:57] see I didn't have to guess at it he
[7:00] showed it to me the more I threw that
[7:02] ball the more that right hand come up
[7:03] and the higher I threw it
[7:06] he used the same hand right what was it
[7:09] it's the characteristics of a person
[7:11] who's right-handed amen and you know
[7:13] something to cast the richness of your
[7:15] behavior it'll just come out in whatever
[7:18] you're doing if you're a Christian the
[7:21] characteristics of a Christian will come
[7:23] out if you got faith Hallelujah the
[7:26] character reasons of faith will come out
[7:28] when you're in tight situations if you a
[7:31] Believer hallelujah amen you will search
[7:34] the scriptures Hallelujah to find things
[7:36] Hallelujah that can identify with you
[7:40] a lot of characteristics has come out
[7:42] now if I take this same ball
[7:44] and I give it and I'll tell one of the
[7:46] girls over here
[7:48] and I say you can only use one hand
[7:52] I ain't gonna put y'all on the spot
[7:56] Hallelujah but if I take it and I throw
[7:59] it back there to Eli you're not hold the
[8:00] baby so I ain't gonna do it
[8:02] but if I take it and I throw it back to
[8:04] somebody or one of the brothers or
[8:05] sisters you're going to use the hand
[8:07] that you're most comfortable with why
[8:09] because you're showing me your
[8:10] characteristics amen and when it comes
[8:13] to God Amen the characteristics of
[8:15] Christ in tight situations amen it'll
[8:19] just come out
[8:20] there's nothing special you have to do
[8:23] amen if you are a lover of the things of
[8:25] God Amen when somebody's persecuting you
[8:28] what comes out the characteristics of
[8:31] love
[8:31] amen those things are already we say God
[8:34] please give me more perfect love you
[8:36] know how you're going to get it when you
[8:38] receive perfect hatred
[8:44] that's how you yo yo that's why your
[8:46] character is a victory amen
[8:49] because amen character has elements in
[8:53] it Hallelujah that's molded and build it
[8:56] into you in situations that you can't
[8:59] explain it just comes out Hallelujah so
[9:02] we're going to look at Balaam and we're
[9:04] going to look at the character of Balaam
[9:05] even though he was a true Vindicated
[9:08] prophet
[9:09] sure
[9:13] balak came to him he said hey I want you
[9:15] to curse these people
[9:17] so he said I can only do what God tell
[9:19] me to do he goes and what he goes to
[9:21] have confidence with God am I in the
[9:23] book
[9:24] am I in numbers Hallelujah you know when
[9:26] he from from the south we say numbers
[9:29] you know some of you guys might say
[9:30] numbers real proper so I hope you
[9:33] understand what I'm saying and I can
[9:35] speak a little fast sometimes so I'll
[9:37] try to slow it down but you know I'm an
[9:39] evangelist those are my characteristics
[9:41] I'm not a teacher so I'm not going to
[9:43] stand back here too long this bothers me
[9:46] Hallelujah but as an evangelist there's
[9:48] certain characteristics about my person
[9:50] I'm loud I'm radical I'm wild and I
[9:54] can't be still why those are the
[9:56] characteristics of an evangelist
[9:58] s
[9:59] go away and then let me tell you this
[10:02] just in case you didn't know there's not
[10:05] another one like me
[10:06] [Applause]
[10:12] some men have the same characteristics
[10:14] as me Hallelujah but they don't have my
[10:17] person
[10:19] amen and there are churches who have
[10:21] some of the same characteristics but
[10:23] they don't have the person
[10:26] and the person is Christ
[10:28] if I'm gonna get back to Balaam you
[10:31] pulling real good and I got some things
[10:32] coming to me but there are people who
[10:35] look good look better than you but they
[10:37] don't have the person inside pushing hey
[10:40] man if you take Esau and Jacob
[10:42] Hallelujah the prophet of God said
[10:44] character-wise Esau was a better boy to
[10:47] his daddy
[10:50] shh
[10:51] oh
[10:53] Cain was just as a Believer as Abel was
[10:57] so there has to be some more ingredients
[11:01] that brings out the true character of
[11:03] God
[11:04] oh my
[11:05] and it has to be more than just hunting
[11:07] and fishing because Esau had that
[11:11] right you can't be just identified by
[11:13] hunting and fishing he so had that you
[11:17] can't just be identified by having a
[11:18] nice beautiful Game Room Esau had that
[11:24] if you know what I'm talking about
[11:29] Hallelujah but let's get back to Baylor
[11:32] that's the thing about an evangelist
[11:34] Hallelujah his subject is all over the
[11:36] place
[11:40] but we're looking for the true
[11:42] ingredients
[11:43] you know let's just say baking a cake
[11:46] most sisters when you bake a cake uh
[11:48] some of you may use box cakes and that's
[11:51] all right
[11:52] You Can Box Duncan Duncan Hines that's
[11:54] all right
[11:55] but you're a real cake baker you got
[11:58] your own ingredients
[11:59] you may get your your flower to rise and
[12:02] your eggs and your milk you know and add
[12:05] some more stuff in there and different
[12:07] stuff especially if you got Grandma's
[12:09] recipe
[12:11] there are certain ingredients in there
[12:13] Hallelujah that's been coming down from
[12:15] generation to generation and you don't
[12:18] add nothing to that why because you want
[12:20] the same product
[12:21] you want the same thing you grew up
[12:23] tasting and if it was good you
[12:25] definitely ain't going to change
[12:26] anything about it but you know sometimes
[12:28] people will add something to an ad
[12:30] something and what does it do it takes
[12:32] away from the original taste
[12:34] Hallelujah and then once you taste it
[12:37] you'll be like this ain't like
[12:38] Grandmama's own
[12:41] and if a person is a sister she getting
[12:43] her feeling she get mad well I just um
[12:48] and you're like you can say whatever you
[12:50] want that don't taste like Grandma's own
[12:51] but I got the same recipe I just add
[12:53] some paprika
[12:55] [Laughter]
[12:56] paprika and cake that doesn't go
[12:59] together
[13:00] it will never bring out Hallelujah the
[13:03] taste that we're looking for and a lot
[13:05] of times as Christians people try to add
[13:07] in things that will change the whole
[13:10] Taste of life
[13:13] we want the original life
[13:16] we want the original ingredients we
[13:18] don't want to add nothing to it why
[13:20] because we want to come out with what
[13:22] Christ
[13:23] we want Christ in Christ alone
[13:26] Hallelujah but if you go if you look at
[13:28] Balaam Balaam he says you know balak
[13:31] come to him and he says hey what I want
[13:32] you to do I want you to go curse these
[13:35] people he says okay all right let me go
[13:37] to God and see what God say first thing
[13:39] God said God said who you with
[13:43] first thing he was with the wrong people
[13:46] and first thing God did God like who
[13:48] these people you who you with he's like
[13:50] Lord I just want to know can I come guys
[13:52] they know you can't curse nobody you
[13:54] can't curse what's blessed
[13:56] so babe goes back to Bailey he says look
[13:59] I can't curse them better yet only thing
[14:01] I can do is bless them
[14:04] straight her straight from God
[14:07] Hallelujah
[14:08] a prophet what does the prophet do they
[14:11] normally hear from God
[14:13] and and when you judge those
[14:14] characteristics of Balaam he was a
[14:17] prophet
[14:20] but then after a while
[14:24] they like eat offers him something
[14:27] and he says you know whatever the
[14:28] scripture says money different things
[14:30] you know he offers him this and now his
[14:33] true nature is gonna come out
[14:36] even though he had straight contact with
[14:39] God
[14:40] his nature of who he really is is sent
[14:44] to override I just heard from God
[14:48] oh
[14:50] my
[14:53] God you can't hide it
[14:56] who you really are it's going to come
[14:59] out
[15:02] there's nothing you can do to stop it
[15:05] the nature of a thing will come out
[15:08] you know Hallelujah I was in I was in
[15:11] South Africa and I went to the lion Park
[15:14] and you know uh
[15:17] I'm from Carolina and we have a zoo
[15:21] foreign
[15:26] to South Africa
[15:29] going to the lion Park seeing those nine
[15:31] foot lions
[15:33] and comparing that to my Riverbank Zoo
[15:36] Lion my South Carolina
[15:38] I'm convinced
[15:41] after seeing what I saw in the
[15:43] characteristics of a lion in his habitat
[15:46] that my lion in Carolina is on dope
[15:52] beautiful
[15:53] I'm just being honest
[15:55] because I saw some lions and they
[15:57] habitat and they were just fiverring and
[16:00] moving and like if y'all get off this
[16:02] bus I'll eat y'all alive
[16:04] it was just the way they looked at us
[16:06] hallelujah they looked at us like we
[16:08] were praying
[16:10] they looked at us like y'all don't
[16:12] belong out here
[16:13] but back home in the zoo
[16:21] ain't even paying us no attention
[16:24] because they all shot up and dope up and
[16:26] tranquilized so they don't be who they
[16:29] really are
[16:30] Hallelujah go ahead cause a lion's not
[16:33] meant to be caged up it's meant to be
[16:36] out in a while it's called the king of
[16:38] the jungle because when it runs amen
[16:40] everything hushes his mouth I've seen
[16:43] that in person
[16:45] when that thing begins to roll and then
[16:47] let's lose it's like the crackling
[16:51] you're like okay I was on one bus one
[16:53] time and the lady holds me a couple
[16:55] years ago but I just went recently but
[16:58] this was a couple years ago the lions
[16:59] got to plan with each other they saw it
[17:02] was playing
[17:03] and they were growling and slapping and
[17:05] everything and and the two guys say oh
[17:08] it's time to go
[17:11] because even the plan with the Lions and
[17:13] different things they can hit you and
[17:15] you'll be messed up
[17:17] she said one hit her just playing
[17:19] Hallelujah and cut her open she had to
[17:22] get 150 stitches
[17:26] what was it it's the power of the Lion
[17:29] the characteristics the power is already
[17:31] there even when it's in play mode
[17:34] Hallelujah and I want to tell the Church
[17:36] of the Living God the power is in you
[17:38] and some of you are playing with it
[17:43] foreign
[17:45] who he is it begins to come out and he's
[17:49] he says okay
[17:50] well I know God said you can't curse
[17:53] what's blessed but but let me go back
[17:55] and make sure
[18:00] that don't even sound right
[18:03] think about it
[18:04] if you heard from God
[18:08] if you heard the voice of God
[18:10] and you knew it was God
[18:12] would you be going back saying Lord are
[18:14] you sure
[18:17] that's the sign of what an unbeliever
[18:21] so even though this man had contact with
[18:23] God he wasn't really a believer
[18:30] oh my
[18:31] and there are people who in position
[18:34] there are people who are anointed in
[18:36] position but they're not really who we
[18:39] think they are
[18:41] and again I ain't personally talking
[18:44] about nobody
[18:46] what I want us to do is examine
[18:48] ourselves
[18:49] because church amen I stay on my knees
[18:52] and I don't just want to be an
[18:53] evangelist of gifts
[18:57] Hallelujah but I want it to be a life
[18:59] Hallelujah I don't want it to be how do
[19:02] you come to church and your gift is who
[19:04] are in the people and then when you see
[19:05] me out in the streets I don't reflect a
[19:07] Christian
[19:09] Hallelujah that means Hallelujah I'm
[19:12] projecting a different kind of
[19:14] characteristic than I am when I'm in the
[19:16] Pulpit Hallelujah hey church I want to
[19:18] be real with God Amen I want to be real
[19:21] with God's people amen yeah we got false
[19:24] we got ups and downs and all these
[19:25] things but what do you do when you fall
[19:27] the real you will tell
[19:30] holy the Bible says a righteous man
[19:32] follows what seven times
[19:35] what makes him righteous he gets back up
[19:40] then his sins are not imputed to him why
[19:43] because he didn't mean to do what he did
[19:46] holy that's what the scripture says
[19:47] David says will not impart it to him
[19:50] imputed him why because it wasn't in his
[19:52] heart to do
[19:53] he was caught up in the moment
[19:55] Hallelujah the characteristics of a man
[19:58] after God's very own heart he could
[20:00] repent
[20:01] he could say God I'm sorry look at the
[20:04] ingredients church he was a man being
[20:07] used by God a mighty warrior but when he
[20:10] failed the characteristics of
[20:12] forgiveness hardly and sorrow Hallelujah
[20:14] and repentance came out
[20:20] do you see all of Christ in you
[20:23] that's what we want we want all of
[20:24] Christ
[20:25] we don't want just a show like Baylor
[20:27] man
[20:28] Balaam had the show he could get in
[20:31] contact with God but there were things
[20:33] he were missing
[20:35] foreign
[20:37] no
[20:39] damn goes back and he says hey
[20:41] Lord
[20:44] um
[20:45] are you sure
[20:47] are you sure you want to encourage these
[20:48] people
[20:49] I believe he he came back
[20:52] was a 2003 times one or two
[20:54] three comes back
[20:56] and God is tired of him
[21:01] why because God doesn't change
[21:05] so if God is giving you direct
[21:07] instructions don't keep going back to
[21:10] God saying Lord are you sure
[21:12] are you sure God
[21:14] are you Lord is that what you want me to
[21:16] be is that what you are you sure
[21:19] basically what you're saying to God is
[21:21] when you do that Lord you ain't lying to
[21:23] me is you
[21:27] you go to God and ask God all you're
[21:29] lying to me that ain't even one of God's
[21:32] attributes
[21:33] God don't know how to lie God don't know
[21:37] how to play with your feelings
[21:39] oh
[21:42] so whatever God could tell me it has to
[21:44] be for my good
[21:45] so I shouldn't question God I should say
[21:48] Okay Lord that's what Balaam should have
[21:50] did but Balaam wanted that money so bad
[21:52] the characteristics of greed
[21:55] and money Hallelujah overall the voice
[21:58] of God
[22:00] oh my
[22:03] the characteristics of a thing it cannot
[22:06] it will come out no matter how you see
[22:09] God
[22:11] sure where does that come from that came
[22:14] from his father
[22:17] because the devil was in God's presence
[22:20] the devil was God's right hand man
[22:23] but what was in his heart the
[22:26] characteristics of want to be lifted up
[22:28] the characteristics wanted to be
[22:30] worshiped everything that he saw look at
[22:32] his ingredients
[22:36] there was no humility in Lucifer
[22:39] that's one of the key ingredients of
[22:41] character
[22:43] humility
[22:45] being able to have the power but don't
[22:48] want it
[22:53] how many people do we know like that
[22:58] got the power but don't want it
[23:01] and I'm gonna say this I know y'all
[23:03] gonna laugh but when I think about this
[23:04] got the power and don't want it I know a
[23:06] person who got the power won't power
[23:08] won't the problem and my guy Trump
[23:21] when you make a statement when you go
[23:23] over to Korea and you watch how this man
[23:26] leads the people have the people bowing
[23:28] down and everything and you make a
[23:29] comment and say I wish the Americans
[23:31] respected leaders like this
[23:35] you can see what his characteristics
[23:37] really are
[23:39] he wants the Lord over the people his
[23:42] best interest is not in for the people
[23:44] the best interest is for himself
[23:47] all right now get out of the politics I
[23:49] ain't talking about politics I'm talking
[23:50] about the nature of a man
[23:52] Hallelujah think about it you put all
[23:55] the power of the world in his hand and
[23:57] the real him comes out he says okay
[23:59] rocket man I'm gonna blow you up
[24:03] see the real nature of a man comes out
[24:05] when that power's in him that's why the
[24:07] prophet of God will say hallelujah
[24:09] character is a victory Hallelujah he
[24:11] said without character Hallelujah you're
[24:13] not even fit to rule
[24:16] without character is what satanic
[24:21] and we see it all the time when men get
[24:24] in position Hallelujah and they get
[24:26] certain power hallelujah what it does it
[24:30] overrides
[24:32] it comes out in such a way to it makes
[24:35] people feel so big that's not the
[24:37] courage of God
[24:40] 's character is to lift you up
[24:43] Hallelujah and I know brother Aaron
[24:45] practiced this Hallelujah as a pastor
[24:48] his whole job is hallelujah to heal your
[24:50] wounds and lift you up
[24:53] me my character is to blow you away
[24:55] because I'm an evangelist
[24:58] whatever I see a Spirit Boom Boom Boom
[25:01] whenever I see a devil
[25:03] why because that's my nature
[25:07] see I'm not connected to your feelings
[25:09] here I don't care
[25:13] that's the characteristics of a pastor
[25:16] he can see things going on in the church
[25:18] and won't touch it not me
[25:20] I'm built to touch it
[25:22] I'm building to slice it hammer it shoot
[25:26] it drill it however just to get to that
[25:28] spirit
[25:31] Hallelujah that's the nature of an
[25:33] evangelist
[25:34] but don't get it twisted the pastor sees
[25:37] the same thing I see
[25:39] but his makeup is different he'll bear
[25:41] with you not me
[25:47] I don't have that nature
[25:51] thank God I'm not
[25:55] I'll be going crazy dealing with the
[25:57] issues in the church
[25:59] why don't you just listen to me
[26:05] think about it church I want to lift
[26:07] your pastor for a second I want you to
[26:09] see his characteristics for a second now
[26:11] Aaron ain't telling me to preach on this
[26:13] but I want you to see his character
[26:15] missions for a second hold you he can
[26:17] give you earlier Godly instructions
[26:19] Hallelujah and you'll come back and ask
[26:21] him the same thing again
[26:23] and he'll bear with you me on the other
[26:26] hand I'm like didn't
[26:36] because some of you might twist or
[26:37] something like I ain't gonna be a
[26:39] Christian and he talk about hitting
[26:41] people
[26:41] [Laughter]
[26:46] hey
[26:48] if there's no fight in the Christian you
[26:50] got to take David out of the Bible
[26:53] Hallelujah you got to have some Godly
[26:55] fight inside of you
[26:56] for what's right
[26:58] amen not to hurt not to destroy but for
[27:02] what is right that's why David fought
[27:04] because there was a greater cause
[27:06] hallelujah what was the cause the cause
[27:08] was the things of God so even when you
[27:11] fight it has to be the right
[27:13] characteristics
[27:16] it can't be so you can sow I'm God's
[27:19] champion no
[27:23] and what I love about real Godly
[27:26] leadership amen we're gonna get back to
[27:28] the past defense but what I love about
[27:30] real Godly leadership Hallelujah you
[27:33] look at David amen David was a man he
[27:36] wasn't like his son Solomon Solomon
[27:38] believed in peace treaties
[27:40] Hallelujah he believed in peace treaties
[27:43] and and making agreements and and this
[27:45] and that no we're not going to do that
[27:46] we're not going to do this not David

[27:50] God's way you gonna die
[27:52] am I in the book
[27:54] Hallelujah remember label label day day
[27:57] because of David Neighbors whole country
[27:59] was protected David never asked anything
[28:02] David decides to come down there and
[28:05] says hey hey give me my man some eating
[28:07] drink and neighbors like who is David
[28:10] oh my God he didn't know
[28:13] he didn't know who's protecting him he
[28:16] didn't know that the wrath of David
[28:17] could come upon you and this man he he
[28:21] began to operate neighbor began to
[28:23] operate in the characteristics of his
[28:26] name
[28:27] his name meant what fool
[28:34] and now he said David who wouldn't get
[28:36] man we ain't giving nobody nothing
[28:39] and his wife Abigail heard about it
[28:42] and Abigail was like oh my God

[29:07] with the word

[29:14] Hallelujah but her characteristics were
[29:17] to protect what was hers
[29:19] even though she was living in misery
[29:21] even though she didn't really really
[29:22] love the man but her vow made her a
[29:25] protector
[29:27] and now she's protecting her full
[29:29] husband neighbor from the Giant Killer
[29:32] David

[29:39] characteristics she didn't have to do

[30:03] always give us grace and mercy before
[30:05] judgment
[30:06] I love that kind of God
[30:09] because if he give us judgment first
[30:11] none of us will be here
[30:14] because we were all born in sin
[30:17] shaped in iniquity came into the world
[30:19] speaking lies but God gave us what grace
[30:22] and mercy

[31:43] man make that man happy those are her
[31:45] characteristics
[31:47] Hallelujah she becomes one of the one of
[31:49] the key ingredients of characters
[31:51] becoming what selfless
[31:55] Hallelujah and being able to Hallelujah
[31:58] look at self and see what self is and
[32:01] forget about self and do for others
[32:03] Hallelujah because what is what is the
[32:06] ingredient of Christianity living for
[32:09] what oh
[32:12] sh and you can see in church Abigail she
[32:15] was thinking about her full husband at
[32:17] home and she goes and she says the food
[32:19] and all these things we know the story
[32:21] amen she says the food and all these
[32:23] things and David the fool gets to David
[32:25] what he asked for gets to him now
[32:29] and David's looking at all this this it
[32:31] was a feast
[32:33] David looks at it and now he's he's he's
[32:36] he's caught between her wrath and Grace
[32:41] she's like man what I asked for them
[32:44] came before me but he got me he got boy
[32:46] he got me hot
[32:49] once I get stirred up it's hard to stir
[32:51] me down
[32:52] but now earlier there was an anointing
[32:55] behind what Abigail did
[32:58] she gives the food and sends a message
[33:00] hallelu your hands made they come down
[33:02] then Abigail comes behind on her horse
[33:04] and she jumps off a horse and she bows
[33:07] down to David
[33:09] and begins to please her cases my Lord
[33:12] this and that don't she probably said my
[33:14] old dumb husband didn't know he didn't
[33:16] know who you are but King David we know
[33:19] we know who we are you know he's he's a
[33:22] Fool by Nature
[33:25] and David's like okay I'll have mercy
[33:27] ate that food up Abigail goes back home
[33:30] neighbor's drunk see his characteristics
[33:32] was I don't even care I didn't say
[33:35] something crazy to King David the Giant
[33:37] Killer of Nations the nation killer
[33:39] Hallelujah
[33:41] I didn't say something crazy to him and
[33:43] I ain't even thinking about it
[33:45] don't that sound like a fool
[33:48] coma and Abigail comes and save him save
[33:52] everything around Hallelujah and then
[33:54] she begins to tell them what happened he
[33:56] has a heart attack
[33:59] oh my when he came
[34:01] he came from his low miles about to die
[34:03] yes you were
[34:05] how often amen our own nature gets in
[34:09] the way of the nature of God
[34:15] church and when you think about the
[34:16] thing the characteristics of Balaam and
[34:18] how God told him say look why are you
[34:21] with these people I said no and now
[34:23] you're coming back then God said okay go
[34:24] ahead go ahead
[34:26] go ahead
[34:28] thus comes forth the message does God
[34:30] change his mind
[34:33] no he didn't change his mind he just got
[34:35] tired of Bala
[34:37] asking him to say more stuff
[34:39] so God said go ahead and in the midst of
[34:42] him giving Balaam his desire was what
[34:45] death
[34:47] because God was going to kill him
[34:50] for being disobedient
[34:53] be careful church that your
[34:55] characteristics Hallelujah who you are
[34:58] as a person is not leading you to your
[35:01] own death
[35:02] well brother that's just not my nature I
[35:04] just ain't ready to serve God well if
[35:07] you ain't serving God who you serving
[35:10] well I'm a good person are you
[35:13] but I ain't bothering nobody are you
[35:17] she's easy for us to say something about
[35:20] ourselves but your life will project Who
[35:23] You Are
[35:25] amen remember
[35:28] that right hand it just came up
[35:30] automatically
[35:32] if I threw it over there right
[35:34] that left hand and move one time
[35:40] because the characteristics of a thing
[35:42] it speaks to itself
[35:43] Hallelujah a robin a robin bird can
[35:48] never be an eagle
[35:50] they got some of the same
[35:51] characteristics though they fly
[35:55] or they have wings they have a beak they
[35:58] have claws Hallelujah but all the things
[36:01] I just named on an eagle it's a whole
[36:04] other level
[36:07] the height of his flying is a whole
[36:09] other level the strength of his calls is
[36:12] a whole another level the strength of
[36:14] his beak is a whole other level so
[36:16] though Robin has some of the same thing
[36:18] the eagle has it does not have the same
[36:21] characteristics
[36:23] amen it doesn't make up the same
[36:25] Hallelujah ingredients Church imma just
[36:27] throw this out there for you that's the
[36:30] strongest Eagle is called an African
[36:32] Crown eagle
[36:34] not these Gold Eagles not these bald
[36:36] eagles these things we see around here
[36:37] no it's called an African Crown eagle
[36:41] because the feathers on his head it
[36:42] looked like a crown and it's so strong
[36:45] whatever it grabs in its talents it has
[36:49] three thousand pounds worth of pressure
[36:53] wow
[36:56] and I've seen the videos on YouTube
[37:01] it go hunt baby monkeys and it grab the
[37:04] monkey by the skull crush it and fly on
[37:06] Earth
[37:08] it got a little stroke to crush a skull
[37:12] well that's heavy ain't it a robin I'll
[37:15] never be able to do that
[37:19] on its strongest day
[37:24] it'll never be it'll never be able to
[37:26] just get no way close to it
[37:29] Hallelujah
[37:30] Church in the true identity of a
[37:33] Christian Hallelujah the world will
[37:36] never be able to get there
[37:39] because there's things about Christ that
[37:41] just oozes out of that person
[37:43] amen back to Balaam you see church he
[37:46] denied the very thing God was giving him
[37:48] Grace with
[37:49] even though he had contact with God
[37:51] heard from God on us
[37:53] church we see it in the Bible all the
[37:55] time people hear from God looking
[37:58] directly at God but who they are on the
[38:00] inside denies him
[38:03] think about this church that spirit is
[38:05] so strong Cain was sitting there talking
[38:08] to God
[38:10] oh hearing from God having fellowship
[38:13] with God
[38:16] but when it's true character Richard
[38:18] started to come out none of that meant
[38:20] anything
[38:21] he lying God's face I don't know what
[38:23] you're talking about then he got
[38:25] arrogant we got am I My Brother's Keeper
[38:32] his ingredients start to come out
[38:35] and what I'm saying Church to you
[38:37] Hallelujah whoever you are you can say
[38:40] I'm bride I'm bride material but your
[38:42] ingredients will tell Who You Are
[38:46] you know uh you know there's a lot going
[38:48] on with what we call the message of the
[38:50] hour and people trying to prove this
[38:51] wrong and prove that wrong brother
[38:53] Brandon made this mistake in that
[38:54] mistake let me say it like this this
[38:56] might shock y'all I don't care
[39:00] my life is not resting on what kind of
[39:03] socks brother Brandon had on
[39:06] my life is not resting on whether there
[39:09] was a there was a a bridge or not
[39:13] my life is not arrested on whether he
[39:15] got a bear or not who cares
[39:20] my life is resting on whether this
[39:22] message Hallelujah introduces me to
[39:25] Christ
[39:28] oh my that's where we are to Rejoice
[39:30] because if the message brings you to
[39:33] Christ to live a better life without
[39:35] error when it comes to the word then
[39:37] you're walking in truth
[39:39] Hallelujah because that's what the
[39:41] message I'm supposed to do bring us back
[39:43] the truth and if the prophet Hollywood
[39:46] introduces the message to you brought
[39:48] you back the truth where the end of
[39:50] discussion
[39:54] I don't testify witness this message
[39:57] with what God did in the prophet no I
[39:59] witnessed it Hallelujah I witnessed this
[40:01] message but how I was changed
[40:07] thank God for the prophet
[40:09] thank God for his life
[40:11] because the things that make up the
[40:13] ingredients of real character one
[40:16] Vindication our Prophet had that
[40:19] Hallelujah
[40:20] to position he was positionally placed
[40:23] as a prophet in our day earlier free
[40:27] Hallelujah operating in the word for
[40:29] your age
[40:31] Hallelujah do we have the right
[40:33] ingredients for a message
[40:37] amen and if you can see yourself living
[40:41] with true Vindication Hallelujah
[40:44] operating in the right position
[40:45] Hallelujah staying with the word for
[40:48] your day which is the Holy Ghost
[40:54] because there's a lot of people speaking
[40:55] in tongues there's a lot of people
[40:57] dancing and shouting but can they stay
[40:59] with the word for their day the
[41:01] Vindicated word for that day that's the
[41:03] true characteristics of your hour
[41:06] Hallelujah that's the ingredients we are
[41:09] to live by amen
[41:10] not just amen because you could have you
[41:13] could have Vindication and be out of
[41:15] position Balaam
[41:19] oh my
[41:21] and you get Hallelujah you can be in
[41:23] position and not crave the promise for
[41:25] your day Esau
[41:30] cause he was a position to receive the
[41:33] blessing but he didn't care about the
[41:34] promise of the Holy Ghost
[41:37] he didn't care about the promise
[41:39] Hallelujah of that Birthright
[41:42] so you got to have all of it Church
[41:45] and again he was a better person than
[41:47] Jacob but what did Jacob do Jacob put
[41:50] himself in position
[41:53] Hallelujah he wasn't even the one that
[41:56] was supposed to get the blessing but he
[41:58] put himself in a position to be blessed
[42:00] out of here then God came what God came
[42:03] and Vindicated it ugly and then Jacob
[42:05] Hallelujah stay with the promise for his
[42:07] day that your seed Hallelujah will be
[42:11] like the stars of the Sun that came
[42:13] through Jacob
[42:14] with the 12 tribes of Israel
[42:21] I feel my helper coming on
[42:25] Hallelujah ain't God good
[42:28] I can't understand why people don't want
[42:29] to serve him
[42:31] God is good
[42:33] especially when he reveals himself
[42:35] that's the greatest thing we can have
[42:36] when God comes to you personally and
[42:39] reveals yourself amen when when the word
[42:42] of God is talking to you and to make you
[42:44] smile like you do in Hallelujah you know
[42:46] that's the spirit of God having
[42:48] communion with you
[42:50] oh
[42:54] you can call me crazy all you want but I
[42:56] like being like this
[42:59] see I know what God has done for me
[43:03] y'all know Holly
[43:04] Heal Me from casting my brain
[43:07] just to put me in position
[43:09] first of all that was a Vindication
[43:11] Hallelujah the Vindication that God Is A
[43:13] Healer heal me with no medication no
[43:17] treatment all I had was Isaiah 53 the
[43:19] word for my day Hallelujah the
[43:22] ingredients will bring out the right
[43:24] vindication
[43:27] or should I say the right
[43:28] characteristics
[43:30] oh my
[43:31] but before I close on y'all know I'm
[43:33] about to close
[43:35] if y'all if some of y'all don't know I
[43:39] might say that five more times
[43:41] but just remember I'm about you
[43:44] I'm not lying I'm about to I didn't say
[43:46] I was
[43:48] I said I'm about to
[43:50] but if you take Balaam and you switch it
[43:52] over to Moses who was in his day
[43:54] Moses not only did he have the
[43:58] Vindication he had to position also
[44:01] but what made them different was Moses
[44:03] could obey the word
[44:05] that God gave him Hallelujah with all
[44:08] his shortcomings God said Moses come
[44:10] back to God and he says Lord but I can't
[44:12] talk God said shut up Moses who made
[44:14] your mouth
[44:16] Moses say that's it for me
[44:20] zip
[44:21] you heard him complain about that no
[44:23] more he said let Aaron be your Prophet
[44:26] oh my church oh my God knows who we are
[44:30] so it's up to God's job Hallelujah to
[44:33] give us confidence
[44:35] did you hear me it's up to the Lord to
[44:38] give you confidence
[44:40] he has to show himself true to you is up
[44:43] to him to show that he's a deliverer I
[44:46] don't have to do that it's up to him to
[44:48] show that he's a savior I don't have to
[44:50] do that
[44:51] hallelujah it's up to him that shows
[44:54] he's a Lord amen I don't have to do that
[44:56] all I have to do is believe
[44:58] and look what he does to Moses he comes
[45:01] to Moses Moses shut up stop complaining
[45:03] let Aaron be your prophet and then he
[45:05] elevates Moses his whole speaking his
[45:08] whole characteristic he said you be God
[45:10] to the people
[45:12] and
[45:15] Hallelujah
[45:17] man you talking about getting elevated
[45:19] earlier Hallelujah he tell Moses shut up
[45:22] now I want you to be God
[45:25] oh my I want what you really are to come
[45:28] out
[45:35] any last element
[45:37] and I'm gonna move on from this but you
[45:39] look at how God Vindicated Moses Holly
[45:42] in all of his shortcomings
[45:44] all his crying and mistakes Moses kept
[45:48] coming back see to do between him and
[45:49] him and him and Balaam
[45:52] Moses kept coming back and say Lord
[45:54] these people you gave me what we're
[45:56] gonna do
[45:57] babe kept coming back I want this money
[45:59] let's kill him
[46:04] and God come and say Moses you're doing
[46:05] too much now I'm gonna put your spirit
[46:07] on the people on 70 men so y'all can
[46:10] share the burden
[46:13] Moses was so much like God hallelujah
[46:15] how he felt about the people God could
[46:18] take that anointing on him and put it on
[46:20] some other men that could help him run
[46:22] the church Hallelujah I hope some of you
[46:26] brothers are sharing brother Aaron's
[46:28] burden
[46:34] make it a little easier for him
[46:38] cause you know what the true sign of a
[46:42] real Church the characteristics of a
[46:44] real Church it can run just as smooth
[46:47] when the pastor's here and it'll run
[46:49] even smoother when he's not here
[46:56] that's the sign of a true church
[46:58] because it shows that the people have
[47:00] the spirit of God in them and they share
[47:03] the same burden so the pastor will have
[47:05] to be did you do this
[47:09] man go enjoy yourself and leave us alone
[47:16] Hallelujah
[47:17] I speak by experience
[47:20] I mean how many miles a young guy
[47:21] Hallelujah me and me and me and another
[47:23] brother in our church both of us were
[47:25] young ministers coming up our pastor
[47:27] will just leave
[47:30] he's just leaving call us while you're
[47:32] away say hey I'm gonna be out of town a
[47:34] couple days y'all just take care of the
[47:35] service
[47:36] like huh
[47:37] who does that
[47:39] you're the leader and you want us to
[47:41] just
[47:44] so what we would do because you know
[47:47] both of us were ministers both of us
[47:48] could do the song service you know and
[47:50] run to church but in that in those
[47:53] moments he didn't tell us what to do so
[47:55] who we were it was just gonna come out
[48:01] and what if one of us wanted to beat a
[48:03] great preacher
[48:05] you were like you do this I'm preaching

[48:09] and what if one of us was a song we had
[48:11] a voice like an angel man you can't sing
[48:13] and let me sing I can sing
[48:16] see the real you gonna come out in those
[48:18] positions of power those times of power
[48:20] Hallelujah the real you gonna come out
[48:23] but you know we were
[48:25] I was more comfortable
[48:27] leading the song service
[48:29] so I was like and he was more
[48:31] comfortable preaching
[48:33] so it wasn't hard for us I was like I
[48:36] seen you preaching he was like you sing
[48:37] I preached it was over no argument
[48:42] Hallelujah and whenever the pastor left
[48:44] we didn't change that we were like oh
[48:46] it's my turn to preach now you preached
[48:48] last week
[48:50] no it was all about making sure Christ
[48:53] was on display
[48:54] making sure the right anointing was in
[48:56] the worship and the right anointing was
[48:58] in the preaching holy in church what I
[49:01] what I look back on we didn't even
[49:03] realize that at that time
[49:05] we were just doing what we were
[49:07] comfortable with
[49:08] Hallelujah yeah I could preach but I
[49:11] wasn't comfortable preaching
[49:12] so I like I can see let me see
[49:15] I love the scene
[49:18] amen let me get up there and do my job
[49:21] let me lead the people into some worship
[49:24] Hallelujah cause I love to worship God
[49:27] anybody like that
[49:30] about about 10 of you
[49:35] the rest of y'all better get ready
[49:37] cause ain't gonna be no preaching in
[49:39] heaven
[49:40] it ain't gonna be enough but hours and
[49:42] hours and days and days and years and
[49:44] years of worship
[49:47] ain't no man gonna come over there I got
[49:49] a new inspiration I got a text nope

[49:53] we're gonna be with the Eternal Word
[49:55] forever the word is going to be fully
[49:58] revealed ain't gonna be no more need for
[50:00] sermons
[50:03] so if you ain't worshiping now you
[50:04] better get on track
[50:07] cause I promise you if you're not a
[50:09] worshiper down here you won't be a
[50:11] worshiper up there and if you're not a
[50:13] worshiper up there How You Gonna Stand
[50:14] in his presence because God is an object
[50:17] of what
[50:22] it blows me away y'all just y'all just
[50:24] bear with me it blows me away doing a
[50:27] song service people sitting in church
[50:28] they'd be like
[50:32] we singing
[50:34] speaking to my heart
[50:43] oh my
[50:44] God that song my sins are gone
[50:47] you asked me why I'm happy
[50:50] is the reason why because my sins are
[50:53] gone how can you not sing that and I how
[50:57] can you sing that and not rejoice
[51:00] but I've seen that song be singing and
[51:01] people like
[51:09] they must don't realize their sins are
[51:11] gone
[51:12] they must don't realize the price has
[51:14] been paid
[51:15] Hallelujah you know the problem is
[51:17] church down here we got too much
[51:19] mannequin worship
[51:28] that's Wednesday Sunday
[51:32] change clothes same position
[51:37] and you think you're gonna be in God's
[51:39] presence like that
[51:42] oh no I ain't trying to make you jump
[51:45] and Shout I'm trying to prepare you
[51:48] Hallelujah because some of us gonna be
[51:51] up there I'm just saying me I'm gonna be
[51:54] up there acting the food

[52:05] Agony No More Pain I'm In His presence
[52:08] forever
[52:09] [Applause]
[52:10] but think about it you can experience
[52:12] that down here
[52:16] Hallelujah because if Christ is the head
[52:18] of your life your problems belong to him
[52:21] your sickness belong to him your
[52:23] depression belongs to him Hallelujah
[52:28] it's just who he is
[52:31] remember the scripture says every knee
[52:33] shall bow
[52:34] every tongue shall confess in that day
[52:37] so that means everybody that sees him is
[52:40] going to worship
[52:41] now if you think you see him and you're
[52:43] gonna be able to keep your compulsion
[52:47] trust me
[52:49] if you think that I uh hello I just hate
[52:52] to I just hate to tell you this
[52:54] but if you think you're gonna be able to
[52:56] keep your composure in heaven you won't
[52:58] be there
[53:00] foreign
[53:03] Hallelujah
[53:04] oh my
[53:06] church just think about it
[53:08] the characteristics of this age
[53:11] and all that we go through all that we
[53:13] come through
[53:14] and I get that you know I see I'm
[53:16] already envisioning myself there
[53:18] you know and when I get there and I meet

[53:56] taller than your quarterback
[54:03] that's little brothers
[54:07] that was a little Jab
[54:10] but think about it Church
[54:13] it's going to be something that we've
[54:14] been living for all this time
[54:17] Hallelujah and I can just see myself
[54:20] hardly having fellowship with Paul I'm
[54:22] gonna just be dancing Messiah is the
[54:25] king of King
[54:27] Messiah is a lot of laws
[54:31] and don't worry about it I know uh we we

[55:10] oh my God I see some of you smiling you
[55:13] believe that
[55:14] hallelujah it's gonna be a timing God
[55:20] let's think about it Paul because hey D
[55:21] you come out of you come out of ladder
[55:23] to see it you my angel come on up I was
[55:25] like yeah man we came to let it see hey
[55:28] Peter James John Philip Martin Timothy
[55:33] y'all come here hey come here you see
[55:35] this man right here he came out of the
[55:38] age when the devil was at his full
[55:40] strength
[55:43] whoa
[55:45] Hallelujah
[55:47] that's the characteristics of this
[55:48] Church Holy amen we're able to withstand
[55:52] anything the devil this house
[55:55] why because of the Devils at its full
[55:57] stream God is at his full strength in
[56:00] his bride
[56:02] Hallelujah
[56:04] oh my I I I got to come down to close
[56:07] man rolling I'm having too much of a
[56:09] good time
[56:10] Hallelujah but this is our church is
[56:13] supposed to be
[56:14] we're supposed to come and be refreshed
[56:17] they say oh my God it's so good
[56:20] but know that he's good in you it ain't
[56:22] just brother Diggs amen this anointing
[56:24] that's here you create that
[56:27] come up to God say what good is it for
[56:29] the man the preacher to be anointed and
[56:31] the people not to be anointed
[56:35] and I'm sure by now you can tell I could
[56:36] preach to myself
[56:38] but it's that much more refreshing when
[56:40] I got people who feel like I feel
[56:45] Hallelujah and if I'm saying something
[56:48] easy you just don't quite see yourself
[56:50] there yet keep coming keep believing let
[56:53] God work on it's his job to clean you up
[56:55] it's his job to give you understanding
[56:58] Hallelujah the bad the Bible say the
[57:00] battle is not yours but it's the laws
[57:06] see Moses Moses could just do what God
[57:08] tell him to do
[57:10] even when he didn't understand
[57:12] he did Moses go to God cries like Oh
[57:15] Lord You're a pharaoh on our back you
[57:17] told me to we was going to be delivered
[57:19] this and that he tell Moses again Moses
[57:21] shut up
[57:22] stop crying why cry to me speak
[57:27] see God kept reminding Moses that he was
[57:30] a god
[57:34] oh my that's what our trials are all
[57:37] about God's trying to remind us who we
[57:39] are
[57:40] the key element to the victory of
[57:43] character is what suffering
[57:45] oh my let me read you a quote I'm gonna
[57:47] get out of here
[57:48] oh my God
[57:51] let me find it
[57:52] oh my I sent this to you bro John I hope
[57:56] you got it
[57:57] I might have did it a little late but
[57:59] you know hope you got it this is in uh
[58:01] Sumerian Church age
[58:03] listen to this
[58:05] oh my
[58:08] God why does he stand by
[58:10] the reason he's talking about trials and
[58:12] stuff
[58:13] he said the reason is in Romans 8 17-18
[58:16] if ye and if children then ask Heirs of
[58:21] God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be
[58:25] that we suffer with him that we may
[58:29] be also glorified together for I reckon
[58:33] that the sufferings of this present time
[58:35] are not worthy to be compared with the
[58:38] glory which shall be revealed in US
[58:41] think about the church the glory of God
[58:43] is now being revealed in US
[58:47] I thought God no share his glory with
[58:49] nobody you're right we must be the same
[58:52] as he is
[58:54] in order for God to share it it has to
[58:56] be with himself
[58:58] [Applause]
[59:01] that's why you can say when you see me
[59:02] you see the father Hallelujah that's why
[59:05] we'll be able to say he said make us one
[59:07] like make them one like We Are One
[59:11] oh if you abiding me and I buy to you
[59:14] Hallelujah she's constantly telling us
[59:17] church we should have the same
[59:18] characteristics
[59:21] we should have the same ingredients Oh
[59:23] my he said well I reckon that the
[59:25] sufferings of this present time are not
[59:27] worthy to be compared with the glory
[59:29] which shall be revealed in US unless we
[59:31] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[59:35] anybody suffering
[59:39] oh my
[59:43] you suffer to reign
[59:47] suffering is one of the key ingredients
[59:50] how do we get here we got here because
[59:54] of the cross
[59:55] God's suffering nobody suffered like he
[59:59] did
[59:59] but that suffering did what gave mankind
[1:00:02] the greatest Victory ever
[1:00:06] the death burial of Jesus Christ that
[1:00:09] suffering Hallelujah gave us the
[1:00:11] greatest Victory ever
[1:00:15] Hallelujah
[1:00:17] he said unless we suffer with him we
[1:00:19] cannot reign with him you have to suffer
[1:00:22] to Reign the reason is the reason for
[1:00:25] this is that character simply is never
[1:00:28] made without suffering so if you're
[1:00:30] suffering what is God doing he's
[1:00:32] perfecting your character
[1:00:34] you say everybody I ain't got no answer
[1:00:36] that's the best part that means God has
[1:00:38] to do it
[1:00:43] character is what a victory
[1:00:46] Hallelujah not a gift
[1:00:50] oh my see I could come and give you a
[1:00:52] gift but if you earn it that means
[1:00:55] something different
[1:00:58] victory
[1:01:02] not a gift a man without character
[1:01:05] cannot Reign because power apart from
[1:01:07] character is satanic but Power with
[1:01:10] character is fit to rule
[1:01:12] power without character is satanic and I
[1:01:16] ain't gonna call no name but we had a
[1:01:18] man say hey we're gonna build a wall and
[1:01:20] we're going to separate the children
[1:01:22] from the from the parents
[1:01:24] love power that's satanic
[1:01:28] Hallelujah bring the people under this
[1:01:30] point government make all of them suffer
[1:01:32] Hallelujah do y'all realize Russia is
[1:01:36] almost about to a place where they got
[1:01:37] refugee camps
[1:01:41] because of this war they're going
[1:01:42] through
[1:01:44] I know this is going to be on video but
[1:01:46] Putin
[1:01:54] I don't think it's all up there
[1:01:58] because he got the same massive
[1:02:00] mannerisms of who the same character
[1:02:02] regions of who Hitler
[1:02:07] same characteristics
[1:02:09] he's so wired
[1:02:11] he keeps changing the laws that he can
[1:02:13] never be voted out
[1:02:18] he basically said I'm gonna die in
[1:02:20] office
[1:02:23] I'm sure you guys have heard about it
[1:02:26] does uh uh uh basketball player Brittany
[1:02:30] um Ghana
[1:02:32] she got nine years in jail
[1:02:35] for having I think a little tube of uh
[1:02:37] CBD oil
[1:02:39] nine years
[1:02:42] yeah and you got murderers
[1:02:44] doing the same time
[1:02:46] she ain't took no life she had she took
[1:02:48] her life
[1:02:50] but you think about it what is it all
[1:02:51] about it's all about him showing y'all
[1:02:54] can't tell me what to do
[1:02:56] I run this country
[1:02:58] and she got caught with it and she gonna
[1:03:00] do some timing
[1:03:02] the only thing that'll get her away is
[1:03:04] what the grace of God
[1:03:07] the only thing that can give up peace in
[1:03:09] that jail think about it she's locked up
[1:03:10] in a place can't even speak the language
[1:03:15] think about it the only thing can help
[1:03:17] her is the grace of God
[1:03:19] but when you got satanic leadership
[1:03:24] power without character is not fit to
[1:03:26] rule
[1:03:29] the man say 18 to 35 you automatically
[1:03:32] got to join this war
[1:03:34] did y'all know that
[1:03:37] in the Russian music um but I'm out of
[1:03:39] here I'm gone
[1:03:41] they start packing up without leaving
[1:03:42] the country
[1:03:46] this is where we are Church
[1:03:49] all the ingredients
[1:03:51] are upon the Earth
[1:03:53] now ask yourself what are you
[1:03:55] manifesting
[1:03:58] are you in manifesting the ingredients
[1:04:00] of Godly character
[1:04:02] Hallelujah are you in manifesting the
[1:04:05] ingredients of something that could be
[1:04:06] false
[1:04:10] because false don't mean that you look
[1:04:12] at it and you'll be like ah no that
[1:04:13] can't be God no it looked just like the
[1:04:15] real thing
[1:04:18] so close they didn't see the very
[1:04:20] elected if possible
[1:04:22] you look at what's going on now all
[1:04:24] these all these big these big um
[1:04:27] televangelism the ones who the big mega
[1:04:30] churches and got all these people money
[1:04:31] now they turn around and say no you
[1:04:33] ain't got to pay tithes

[1:04:39] saying you ain't got to pay taxes you
[1:04:40] gotta get no money
[1:04:42] because they're under pressure

[1:04:51] line your church up give everybody back
[1:04:54] all the money you didn't talk over the

[1:05:03] right Church what we believe we're gonna
[1:05:05] stand for
[1:05:07] it ain't just gonna be coming out of our
[1:05:09] mouth it's gonna have to be a life
[1:05:12] Hallelujah Moses represented the life
[1:05:15] amen not just amen opposition or just a
[1:05:19] Vindication no it was the word
[1:05:20] everything amen Jacob Hallelujah it
[1:05:24] wasn't just a Vindication amen or just a
[1:05:26] a position no amen he sought after the
[1:05:29] promises of God
[1:05:31] and I said we should become a musician
[1:05:33] I'm closing
[1:05:35] that should be our life
[1:05:38] looking for the true ingredients of
[1:05:40] character
[1:05:42] because character never fails real
[1:05:46] character
[1:05:47] because the real character of God will
[1:05:50] produce the love of God
[1:05:53] Hallelujah
[1:05:55] and the real love of God Amen amen you
[1:05:59] don't have to come you don't have to
[1:06:00] stand back here and say I got perfect
[1:06:02] love no all you will be able to feel it
[1:06:07] if you hear somebody always tell me I
[1:06:08] got perfect love I'm in a day I got
[1:06:10] perfect love

[1:06:18] how often and I read the scripture did
[1:06:21] Jesus toot his own horn
[1:06:24] he said if y'all don't believe the words
[1:06:27] that's coming out of my mouth
[1:06:30] look at the
[1:06:33] believe me for the works I do
[1:06:36] Judge Me by that
[1:06:38] he could have eaten say I'm God
[1:06:39] everybody Bow Down
[1:06:42] we didn't do that
[1:06:43] why because he wanted the people to love
[1:06:45] him the characteristics of Love
[1:06:48] real love that'll pushed through trials
[1:06:51] that are pushed through tribulations you
[1:06:53] know Church you look at how he did the
[1:06:55] church you just take you just take my
[1:06:56] Guy Peter for a second
[1:06:58] God had had to develop that character
[1:07:01] out of him
[1:07:02] because at first he was just a good
[1:07:04] churchgoer
[1:07:06] we don't want to be just good church

[1:07:11] of God
