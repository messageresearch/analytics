[0:00] genesis chapter 13 verse 11
[0:02] says then lot chose him all the plain of
[0:05] jordan and lot journeyed east and they
[0:08] separated themselves the one from the
[0:10] other
[0:11] abram dwelled in the land of canaan and
[0:13] lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and
[0:15] pitched his tent towards sodom but the
[0:17] men of sodom were wicked and sinners
[0:20] before the lord exceedingly reading this
[0:22] portion is a part of my text because i
[0:25] just want to
[0:26] kind of enter this into the record as it
[0:28] were by reading it now and maybe make
[0:30] reference to it but i want this to this
[0:32] image to really stand out
[0:34] to us today and the lord said unto abram
[0:37] after that lot was separated from him
[0:39] this becomes a critical um qualifier or
[0:42] condition that after lot was separated
[0:45] now god's gonna speak to him in this
[0:46] manner and would not have done so
[0:49] until
[0:50] uh until he had separated brother ram
[0:52] teaching us that god left him alone
[0:54] until he stayed away from him he didn't
[0:55] come and visit him in this way until he
[0:58] had separated
[0:59] god speaking lift up now thine eyes and
[1:02] look from the place where thou art
[1:03] northward and southward and eastward and
[1:05] westward
[1:07] for all the land which thou seest to
[1:09] thee will i give it and to thy seed
[1:11] forever
[1:12] we realized that he would have looked
[1:13] out upon the very place that lot chose
[1:16] and so
[1:17] abraham is assured
[1:19] that though you may not possess it now
[1:21] there is a time that it will be given to
[1:22] you
[1:23] and so there was no regret or loss or
[1:25] jealousy any enmity that he would have
[1:28] and i will make thy seed as the dust of
[1:30] the earth so that if a man can number
[1:32] the dust of the earth then shall thy
[1:33] seed also
[1:35] be numbered
[1:36] arise walk through the land and the
[1:38] length of it and in the breadth of it
[1:41] for i will give it unto thee then abram
[1:43] removed his tent and came and dwelt in
[1:45] the plane of memory which is in hebron
[1:48] and built there an altar unto
[1:50] the lord the desire god would bless this
[1:53] word which we've read you can take your
[1:55] seats today
[2:00] i believe this is part 13
[2:02] of supreme faith
[2:04] revealed in abraham
[2:07] and just i'm going to jump right into it
[2:09] really looking at where we were
[2:11] connecting where we were last sunday
[2:13] though we went into in greater detail
[2:15] wednesday night we're kind of looking at
[2:17] the aspect of abraham's journey being
[2:19] connected to adam's fall and how there's
[2:21] a
[2:22] there's a mystery that's hidden those
[2:24] first four chapters of genesis that's
[2:26] tied to the life and calling of abraham
[2:29] and i personally had been studying
[2:32] uh quite a bit on different aspects of
[2:35] the garden of eden
[2:37] and the city jerusalem naturally to
[2:39] israel and the new jerusalem
[2:41] spiritually in the bride and then
[2:43] literally to come in the eighth day and
[2:45] in the eternities
[2:46] and uh seeing how these themes were
[2:48] connected and i had thought in my heart
[2:50] just in the the depth of things that i
[2:53] was looking at being inspired by and
[2:54] being quickened to me and certainly
[2:56] excited about um i had felt in my heart
[2:59] that yesterday was going to be an easy
[3:01] day getting ready for service because
[3:02] for weeks these things had just been
[3:04] compiling and then yesterday morning it
[3:06] was just it was dead to me and i was
[3:08] like i don't like this
[3:10] i'm not writing a paper i'm not giving a
[3:11] speech so material means nothing it has
[3:14] to be anointed it has to be quickened
[3:16] and really just i wrestled all day long
[3:20] in just trying to find the channel and
[3:22] god opened up something to me that was
[3:24] part of it's been also stunning at the
[3:26] same time on
[3:27] the particular aspect in abraham's life
[3:29] which is very pronounced in the message
[3:31] of the hour of separation from lot to me
[3:34] i viewed it in the sense that it was
[3:36] this is a significant circumstance and
[3:38] it's very important
[3:40] uh to recognize and i thought well it
[3:42] would be worthy of maybe more attention
[3:44] than how i was feeling led uh or worthy
[3:46] of its own service in a way and i kind
[3:48] of was putting it way down the road in
[3:50] terms of looking at the subject
[3:52] but god uh had been
[3:55] answering the question to me of why why
[3:58] separate from law what was the what was
[4:00] the real purpose in that and we even
[4:02] posed the question last week why did he
[4:04] have to leave his family why did he have
[4:05] to separate from lot
[4:07] and we recognized that once he did and
[4:09] i'll just kind of get into it now well
[4:12] i'll just say that the lord has given me
[4:13] direction i'm not worried anymore
[4:15] and the lord just came on the scene and
[4:17] really focused me in on a particular
[4:19] thing that we'd been studying on and
[4:20] just amplified it and i just felt like
[4:22] it was anointed for this morning
[4:24] and so we're leaving some of the themes
[4:26] of wanting to really look at the garden
[4:28] of eden and what it represented and how
[4:29] abraham's life is the beginning of the
[4:32] foundation of bringing that and raising
[4:33] that back up
[4:35] and just identify how that when we were
[4:37] looking at abraham being separated from
[4:39] lot it reproduced the image that existed
[4:42] after the fall and this is answering the
[4:44] question well why did god separate him
[4:46] from family from his kindred from his
[4:48] country and then even from his family
[4:50] because god wanted to produce this
[4:52] particular image
[4:53] and in genesis chapter 3 verse 23 it
[4:56] says therefore the lord god sent him
[4:58] forth from the garden to till the ground
[5:00] from whence he was taken so adam being
[5:04] separated from the garden of eden as he
[5:06] walks out he walks shoulder to shoulder
[5:07] with his wife and we see man and woman
[5:10] leaving the garden moving towards death
[5:13] that's the image that we have man and a
[5:14] woman one man one woman leaving the
[5:17] garden no children as of yet a broken
[5:19] promise going forth
[5:21] out of the garden eden and we know that
[5:23] they're headed towards death so that's
[5:25] that's the image that we have of
[5:28] abraham and sarah as they come out of
[5:30] babylon and as they're traveling and
[5:32] then once god separates them from lot we
[5:34] see a man and a woman uh without
[5:36] children and really just ordained to
[5:38] death this is their lot in life they're
[5:40] going to come to a grave eventually
[5:42] but it also brings back the image of one
[5:45] man and one woman over under a covenant
[5:47] that existed just prior to the fall so
[5:49] he had the image of a man and his wife
[5:51] and that exists after the fall thrust
[5:53] out of the garden driven away and the
[5:56] way kept by these cherubim and it's uh
[5:59] they're banished from the garden of god
[6:01] we see this this image but i want to
[6:04] consider that also
[6:07] abraham and sarah are also reflecting
[6:09] the image that would have existed just
[6:11] prior to the fall
[6:13] and it says in verse 25 of chapter two
[6:16] kind of the closing words of the
[6:18] creation and the positioning of man
[6:22] in the garden and it's the kind of the
[6:24] last glimpse we get before we're
[6:25] introduced to the serpent who's the most
[6:27] subtle beast in the field it says and
[6:30] they were both naked genesis chapter 2
[6:32] verse 25
[6:33] and i haven't provided these scriptures
[6:35] and some of these statements i'm going
[6:36] to use here in a moment on the slideshow
[6:38] so don't think that brother john is lost
[6:41] i did not include these because i wanted
[6:43] to
[6:44] um
[6:45] i guess i just wanted you to look at me
[6:47] while i read these but i just felt like
[6:48] if you could just listen to what i'm
[6:49] saying i'm not going to maybe be
[6:51] dissecting these in great detail i just
[6:53] wanted to kind of use these in the
[6:55] foundation
[6:56] but it says in genesis chapter 2 verse
[6:58] 25 and they were both naked the man and
[7:00] his wife and were not ashamed now kind
[7:03] of a very peculiar scripture maybe if we
[7:06] would consider it in modern language or
[7:07] modern condition
[7:09] but this closes the scenes of god's
[7:12] perfect eden and this this garden of
[7:15] eden and we could spend so much time
[7:18] just rehearsing the perfection that
[7:20] existed but the man and the woman are
[7:22] existing in the garden of eden the
[7:24] garden of god this place of delight this
[7:26] paradise
[7:27] and they've been given a perfect promise
[7:29] and this perfect promise has been given
[7:31] by a perfect god and they're living with
[7:33] perfect love
[7:34] and it's the perfection of perfection
[7:36] and this is are these are the
[7:38] circumstances that the man and the woman
[7:40] are existing in
[7:42] and it's important to note that it's
[7:44] from perfection in perfect conditions
[7:46] that mankind fell
[7:49] and we and i think we realize that and
[7:51] it's part of the narrative it's part of
[7:53] what we accept but here they are in the
[7:55] perfection of perfection a perfect god
[7:57] with the perfect promise a perfect
[7:58] covenant perfect conditions everything
[8:00] around them was perfect but yet they
[8:02] fell from that condition
[8:04] and so as you would just read right from
[8:06] verse 25 into genesis chapter 3 it
[8:08] details the circumstances under which
[8:11] mankind fell from god's perfection this
[8:14] is where we're just we're identifying
[8:16] how
[8:16] the
[8:18] um
[8:20] there's this myth there's a hidden
[8:21] mystery in these chapters that's
[8:23] connected to and tied to abraham and so
[8:26] if you look at the circumstances of the
[8:27] fall in verse 4 genesis chapter 3 verse
[8:29] 4 it says and the serpent said unto the
[8:32] woman ye shall not surely die really
[8:35] there's a more more to the conversation
[8:37] that was held but this is a clearly a
[8:40] contradiction against god's word
[8:42] certainly he lies about the motives of
[8:44] god and he says because god knows the
[8:46] day you eat
[8:47] you're going to become enlightened and
[8:48] become his gods and no good from evil
[8:51] and suggesting that god is withholding
[8:53] good from the woman
[8:54] but it's in this statement you shall not
[8:56] surely die
[8:58] that therein is a lie it's just one word
[9:01] god said you shall die but now satan is
[9:03] contradicting the word and he he says
[9:06] you shall not die and so we read in
[9:08] genesis chapter 3 and we see that the
[9:10] fall is represented by the act of eating
[9:13] but we know that there's more
[9:15] that has transpired and it's just
[9:17] symbolic of a natural act but the the
[9:21] language that is used whether it be in
[9:23] the conversation that caused eve to
[9:25] believe a lie
[9:26] and then perverted her perception of the
[9:28] fruit to believe that it was good for
[9:30] food and to make one wise
[9:32] it represents an eve it represents the
[9:35] wrong conception
[9:36] the woman receiving the wrong thought
[9:38] receiving a lie and then it produces the
[9:40] act and so there's the wrong conception
[9:43] in heart and then there there's a wrong
[9:45] conception in body uh that produces uh
[9:48] the the what we would call the serpent
[9:50] seed or a hybrid blood but the original
[9:52] sin it produces the act of the original
[9:55] sin and the fallout from it it's all
[9:57] represented in this act of eating but
[9:59] notice some of these statements that
[10:01] brother branham makes about this he says
[10:03] it was one word that caused the whole
[10:05] mess to come
[10:06] eve disbelieved one word of god
[10:10] in the first of the bible one word
[10:12] caused the trouble that's this this
[10:15] interaction of the devil's lie causing
[10:18] eve to receive it and to believe it and
[10:20] he says it's just one word one word
[10:22] disbelieved and it caused trouble then
[10:25] he says one little word is what taken us
[10:27] in all this trouble i want you to kind
[10:29] of recognize that the emphasis on
[10:31] trouble and then he puts it in this
[10:33] light not disbelieve it but just
[10:35] misplace it in other words it wasn't an
[10:37] utter rejection of the whole thing it's
[10:40] just one part misplaced eve just had
[10:43] satan
[10:44] eve just had satan to miss just give her
[10:47] a reason
[10:48] so eve just had satan give her a reason
[10:50] that's all she needed
[10:52] now think about that
[10:53] it's not uh it's not that you would
[10:56] reject it in its entirety but just give
[10:58] you a reason not to receive it just give
[11:00] you a reason maybe just to believe it's
[11:02] not for you just give you a reason to
[11:04] think that it's not this way or that way
[11:06] all he had to do was just give her a
[11:07] reason and he says it's take it's what's
[11:09] given us all this trouble he says in
[11:11] another place eve questioned one little
[11:14] phase of god's word and what did it do
[11:16] caused all this trouble that we have
[11:19] numerous statements over and over and
[11:20] over again showing that it was in this
[11:23] in this act and this wrong conception
[11:25] that brings forth all the chaos we know
[11:27] all the sorrow we know all the misery we
[11:29] know all the trouble that we have all
[11:31] the conflict all the strife
[11:34] is derived from this this moment of this
[11:37] wrong conception
[11:39] and paul says in romans chapter 5 verse
[11:41] 12 wherefore as by one man's sin entered
[11:45] into the world and death by sin so death
[11:48] passed upon all men for that all have
[11:50] sinned
[11:52] i would love to take time to amplify
[11:54] this but i know i'm looking at a group
[11:55] of message believers who are well taught
[11:58] and and i believe that there would be a
[12:00] benefit in the exercise of amplifying
[12:02] this principle in scripture but we know
[12:04] that sin is unbelief
[12:06] there's a way that we look at sin and
[12:08] recognize that there's certain
[12:09] attributes of sin or all unrighteousness
[12:12] is sin
[12:13] but yet there is a but the ultimate sin
[12:17] really is disbelieving and it is
[12:19] unbelief and you can substantiate that
[12:20] by scripture and we'll touch on it in a
[12:22] moment just briefly but it's
[12:26] it's by by sin as one man's sin through
[12:30] as by one man's sin enter into the world
[12:32] and then death by sin so it's through
[12:35] the the through the fall in the garden
[12:38] that sin enters in unbelief enters in
[12:41] and then because of unbelief there is
[12:42] death
[12:43] and i want you to recognize that sin
[12:47] being unbelief and it it leads to death
[12:50] so this is if you want to die just
[12:52] disbelieve you want to remain in death
[12:54] just disbelieve sin is unbelief
[12:56] and now
[12:58] so there is a
[13:00] um
[13:02] maybe just a in my mind just to catch
[13:05] where i'm at
[13:07] we have adam
[13:08] and the woman
[13:10] represent as one man
[13:12] and his wife with a promise now thrust
[13:14] out of the garden of eden under a broken
[13:16] covenant
[13:17] and then there's um we come back and we
[13:20] see that even prior to the fall there
[13:22] was one man and one woman
[13:24] and so these things that i i want you to
[13:26] begin to consider is
[13:28] this points the fact that eve
[13:30] disbelieving brought trouble and through
[13:32] her disbelief sin entered and it brought
[13:33] death it points to another element that
[13:36] god is showing
[13:37] in abraham's separation from lot
[13:40] i wanted to i think in my mind i wanted
[13:42] to maybe do it a little bit different
[13:43] order but we'll do it this way that god
[13:46] is
[13:47] now in this we can see and recognize
[13:50] some a principle that god was wanting to
[13:52] establish in separating him from lot
[13:55] and the separation that god has
[13:57] portrayed
[13:58] relates to the sin in the garden of eden
[14:01] now i want you to ponder that so
[14:03] you can say well this is my thesis
[14:04] statement this is what i'm what i wanted
[14:06] to establish is that when god separates
[14:09] abraham from lot
[14:11] he is portraying something that was
[14:13] taking place in the garden of eden it's
[14:15] it it relates to the sin in the garden
[14:18] of eden
[14:19] so let's look at genesis chapter 13
[14:21] verse 5 and i believe this is where
[14:23] my some of my slides begin
[14:25] genesis chapter 13
[14:27] uh i want to read to i believe i'll be
[14:29] reading verses 5 to 13.
[14:32] but we'll kind of maybe go through it
[14:33] piece by piece here and lot also which
[14:36] went with abraham we identified prior
[14:38] that god said get away from your family
[14:41] but from the very moment that abraham
[14:42] began to journey his dad goes with them
[14:44] and lot goes with them he leaves his dad
[14:46] but lot goes with them goes down into
[14:48] egypt lot must have went with him
[14:49] because when he comes out lot's still
[14:51] with them and now comes this now comes
[14:53] the uh the scene and lot also which with
[14:56] abraham abram had flocks and herds and
[14:59] tents so lot now has accumulated a lot
[15:01] of resources a lot of
[15:03] servants and
[15:05] animals and possessions
[15:07] and the land was not able to bear them
[15:10] that they might dwell together this is
[15:13] peaceably and to be cohesive for their
[15:15] substance was great both of them both
[15:17] abram and lot so that they could not
[15:19] dwell together notice that there's it's
[15:21] just not working out
[15:23] all these cattle all these herdsmens all
[15:25] the flocks all the tents um they're in
[15:27] this land or this area
[15:29] and they're not harmonizing it says and
[15:31] there was strife
[15:32] between the herdmen of abram's cattle
[15:34] and the herdman of lot's cattle and the
[15:37] canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then
[15:39] in the land so you could say wow it was
[15:42] they're having conflict with one another
[15:44] but there's also conflict outside of the
[15:46] two of them
[15:47] listen we have enough conflict with the
[15:49] world right we have enough conflict in
[15:50] the job we have enough conflict with
[15:52] with people that we're distantly
[15:53] associated with and then we have
[15:55] conflict very close to us within family
[15:57] relations and conflict that becomes very
[15:59] near our house you can say well there's
[16:01] canaanite and parasite that made it
[16:02] difficult enough for abram but now
[16:05] there's conflict there near him within
[16:07] his family through lot and his herdsmen
[16:09] and the cattle
[16:11] and so abram recognizes this as the
[16:13] bible says there was strife
[16:15] and then abram recognizes this and abram
[16:17] said unto lot let there be no strife i
[16:20] pray thee between me and thee in between
[16:23] my herdman and thy heardman for we be
[16:25] brethren.
[16:26] notice that one could say well it was
[16:28] just the herdmen that were fighting well
[16:29] if that's where it began that's not
[16:31] where it ended because that naturally
[16:34] escalated to a conflict between abram
[16:37] and lot
[16:38] and it was not it would be natural that
[16:39] there could be conflict between servants
[16:41] and other family members and
[16:43] and this conflict of resources and all
[16:46] these different things and ultimately it
[16:48] would spill out into the relationship
[16:49] that abram had with lot and so lot
[16:52] recognizes that let's not have strife
[16:54] between you and i or between our herd
[16:56] men and so this to me is important to
[16:59] recognize that here when abram begins to
[17:02] speak this is our introduction to lot
[17:06] because to this point we just know that
[17:07] he's there
[17:09] but we don't know anything else about
[17:10] him other than maybe we could ascertain
[17:12] that he was either really dependent upon
[17:14] abram he was a good follower or he was a
[17:16] leech or he recognized the potential in
[17:18] abram or maybe he heard the promise we
[17:20] don't know exactly why lot keeps hanging
[17:23] around but to this point we just know
[17:25] he's there kind of in the shadows
[17:27] wherever abraham goes but now we're
[17:29] being introduced to his character
[17:32] now we are we recognize in our
[17:34] introduction to lot is he's causing
[17:36] abraham trouble
[17:38] i want you to recognize that part that
[17:40] now when we're introduced to lot and we
[17:41] begin to recognize the influence that he
[17:43] is having or the impact that he has in
[17:45] abraham's life he's causing trouble
[17:47] because the bible says that there was
[17:49] strife between the herd men abram said
[17:50] let there not be strife between you and
[17:52] i that means contention
[17:54] that means there was some sort of
[17:55] competition among the among the herdsmen
[17:58] competition among resources there was
[18:00] competition between abraham and lot and
[18:03] when the word strife is used it speaks
[18:05] of a provoking
[18:07] so lot's presence and his actions and
[18:10] his activities as they were very near
[18:11] abram were provoking abraham into
[18:14] certain feelings
[18:16] he said let not there be strife abraham
[18:18] is experiencing this maybe conflict and
[18:20] he's experiencing strife and he's
[18:22] experiencing this striving and maybe
[18:24] even a competition and saying well isn't
[18:26] there enough for us here and why does he
[18:28] do this and why does he do that and so
[18:30] there's this conflict that abraham
[18:32] begins to experience this is our
[18:34] introduction to lot he's causing trouble
[18:36] and brother brahm says as long as
[18:38] as long as lot hung around they had
[18:41] trouble
[18:43] recognize this
[18:44] characteristic then
[18:46] of lot he causes trouble and remember
[18:48] what began when eve disbelieved trouble
[18:52] now let's continue in verse 9 abram
[18:55] continue and let the not there be strife
[18:56] he says is not the whole land before
[18:58] thee
[18:59] separate thyself i pray thee from me
[19:02] if thou will take the left hand then i
[19:04] will go to the right if thou orth i'll
[19:06] depart to the right hand then i will go
[19:08] to the left
[19:10] i want you to recognize this abraham
[19:13] is bringing a separation
[19:15] his
[19:17] it's abraham's focus on the word
[19:21] that causes the separation but notice it
[19:23] causes lot to separate
[19:26] abram is actually kind of bringing
[19:28] abraham's faith is what forces the issue
[19:30] of separation and he says all right lot
[19:32] you go
[19:34] and wherever you go i will take the
[19:36] opposite it wasn't so much that abraham
[19:39] tried to pack up his stuff and move and
[19:40] pack up his stuff and get away and in
[19:42] the middle of night everybody be quiet
[19:44] we're leaving he's not going to know
[19:45] where we are
[19:46] he just he he said why don't you go and
[19:49] wherever you go i'll do the opposite and
[19:51] i so i want you to recognize there was
[19:53] something within abraham's stand in his
[19:55] conviction
[19:57] where he forces the issue and by
[19:59] deciding
[20:01] and recognizing what the word of god
[20:02] called him to do it causes lot himself
[20:06] to separate
[20:07] it's the shock that pulls away the seed
[20:10] can do nothing but stand in the position
[20:12] that it's placed and stand according to
[20:13] the word of god but it's abraham's faith
[20:15] that forces the issue and so he says you
[20:18] go left i'll go right you go north i'll
[20:20] go south you just choose because we
[20:22] can't keep hanging around i need to
[20:24] separate and we recognize that that was
[20:26] abraham obeying the word that was
[20:28] originally given to him
[20:31] and then as we begin to look at lot's
[20:32] decision it points to unrighteousness
[20:35] that lot in making his decision reveals
[20:37] more about his character remember this
[20:39] is our introduction to lot we want to
[20:40] know who this what this nephew was all
[20:42] about and what he stood for and what
[20:43] kind of person he was well when we start
[20:45] getting into the details his family is
[20:47] causing trouble his resources are
[20:49] causing trouble his servants are causing
[20:51] trouble for abraham
[20:52] and now when given an opportunity to
[20:54] separate his decision is
[20:57] through unrighteousness because he says
[20:59] let's separate in verse 10 and lot
[21:01] lifted up his eyes
[21:03] and beheld all the plain of jordan that
[21:06] it was well watered everywhere before
[21:08] the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrh now
[21:11] notice
[21:12] what what these cities represent in our
[21:15] understanding
[21:16] at the time they would have existed with
[21:18] this great beauty that you would have
[21:20] been in all of the cities and there
[21:21] would have been a an attraction and
[21:23] allure in terms of their amenities and
[21:24] their resources and where they were
[21:26] planted and
[21:27] and how beautiful it was even to the
[21:29] extent that god inspires moses to say
[21:31] even as the garden of the lord
[21:34] like the land of egypt as thou comest
[21:37] unto zoar it's describing something very
[21:39] fertile and
[21:40] verdant and very rich with minerals and
[21:43] access to water and
[21:44] and it would have been a very abundant
[21:46] place to live and even the bible
[21:48] identifies that this is the way it was
[21:50] before god destroyed it so there's some
[21:52] fallout consequence and there's
[21:54] there's death that resides in the land
[21:56] and it's not as beautiful
[21:58] today as it would have been then but
[22:00] this is not looking at it and the bible
[22:03] wants god wants you to recognize that
[22:05] lord is choosing sodom and gomorrah it's
[22:08] even it but it's beauty
[22:10] it has some sort of connection and
[22:12] relationship to the garden which has
[22:14] been lost to men but notice how it
[22:16] continues then lot chose him all the
[22:19] plain of jordan and lot journeyed east
[22:22] it's a lot of a lot of principles as it
[22:24] relates to him journeying east
[22:27] says and they separated themselves the
[22:29] one from the other there comes the
[22:31] separation
[22:32] and abram dwelled in the land of canaan
[22:34] and lot dwelled in the cities of the
[22:36] plain and pitched his tent towards sodom
[22:39] this is where the separation came now
[22:41] lord is clearly in sodom
[22:44] abraham dwells in canaan he's more in
[22:47] the wilderness he separated out from
[22:48] this plain of jordan because he said he
[22:50] saw all the plane and he chose him all
[22:53] the plane and this is what he wanted he
[22:54] chose the good land the choices the best
[22:56] and he kind of left abraham with the
[22:58] leftovers and something not to be
[22:59] desired but then the bible wants us to
[23:01] recognize that what lot chose he chose
[23:07] he chose knowing the wickedness and the
[23:09] unrighteousness even as it vexed them as
[23:11] the bible told us it says but the men of
[23:13] sodom were wicked and sinners before the
[23:15] lord exceedingly
[23:17] so recognize now as lot chooses he
[23:21] chooses something very beautiful and
[23:23] very pleasing to the eye
[23:25] and we can see in the temptation of lot
[23:27] as he lifted up his eyes and saw the
[23:29] plains of jordan well watered like the
[23:31] garden of god and this is what he
[23:33] chooses in the temptation of lot we see
[23:35] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[23:36] flesh and the pride of life
[23:38] that lord has chosen according to these
[23:40] things is the lust of his eyes the lust
[23:42] of the flesh and the pride of life these
[23:44] are the motivating factors and causing
[23:46] lot to choose sodom and gomorrah and all
[23:49] the plains of jordan instead of choosing
[23:51] something else he said well why would he
[23:52] chose something else well there the
[23:54] those men of sodom were wicked and
[23:57] sinners before the lord exceedingly
[24:00] but yet he is tempted to choose it
[24:02] because of these different desires that
[24:04] he has in these forces and these
[24:06] influences that are working upon him and
[24:08] we recognize these are the same
[24:10] temptations in the garden of eden where
[24:12] eve was tested she fell to the lust of
[24:15] the eyes the lust of the flesh and the
[24:16] pride of life
[24:19] and lot's decision is associated with
[24:22] unrighteousness
[24:23] and wickedness
[24:25] and it's bringing up this image of lot
[24:27] choosing sodom and gomorrah now at the
[24:29] time
[24:30] that doesn't seem striking but to us now
[24:32] in hindsight we realize this speaks
[24:34] something about lot's character
[24:38] now abraham's separation
[24:41] from lot
[24:42] was
[24:43] literally from family as even as abraham
[24:46] called him his brother we realized that
[24:48] he was his nephew
[24:49] but yet it was this was family this was
[24:51] a close a close relationship
[24:54] and abraham's separation was from family
[24:57] and it would it was physical
[25:01] and so this is literally it's family
[25:02] that he separates from it's literally
[25:04] physical where he goes you choose a
[25:06] place i'm going to go the opposite we
[25:07] need to get physical distance between
[25:09] ourselves
[25:10] and and what it represents is this
[25:12] untangling where there had been this
[25:14] mixture and this working together and
[25:17] herdsmen of lot's household and herdsmen
[25:18] of abram's household and servants and
[25:21] resources and cattle and tents and they
[25:24] were always kind of mixed together where
[25:25] maybe one would say well whose cattle is
[25:27] this and whose land is that and whose
[25:29] tents are these and who's heard them to
[25:30] these maybe to the naked eye you
[25:32] wouldn't be able to tell the difference
[25:33] between abram and lot but god is not
[25:36] happy that it stayed that way
[25:38] god does not want there to be any
[25:40] confusion as to who the promise pertains
[25:42] to is that not what happened in the
[25:44] exodus out of egypt that god said that
[25:46] they must that the people will know that
[25:48] i the lord put a difference between
[25:50] israel and egypt he wants to divide
[25:52] between the two he wants to bring this
[25:54] distinction of the one who has the
[25:56] promise and the one that's just kind of
[25:57] hanging out near it
[25:59] and so there's an untangling of lot
[26:02] from abram
[26:04] they're mixed together they're kind of
[26:06] associated together but now god wants to
[26:08] unyoke them where they were together in
[26:09] one place serving in one place feeding
[26:11] in one place living in one place god is
[26:14] separating them out physically from
[26:16] family and there's this unyoking that
[26:17] transpires
[26:19] but i want to say this because i think
[26:21] it's very important that we have the
[26:22] right balance on this because it
[26:24] represents something deeper for us
[26:27] you say
[26:28] well abraham separated from his family
[26:30] and abraham got physical distance from
[26:32] his family
[26:34] it's that oh that in itself would never
[26:37] achieve the separation that god calls
[26:40] if that's all you think you need to do i
[26:41] just need to get away from my family i'm
[26:42] just going to get physically away from
[26:43] them well that that that that's without
[26:45] principle that's just you could just be
[26:47] physically distant from somebody
[26:49] and you can just be ghost in your family
[26:50] and it's not really going to produce
[26:52] anything
[26:53] so it represents a deeper principle for
[26:55] us
[26:56] and it expresses it expresses something
[26:58] very uh very important for us to
[27:00] recognize and this is just the real crux
[27:02] of how god dealt with my heart yesterday
[27:04] and the deeper principles related to the
[27:07] fall in the beginning
[27:09] and so listen to these statements from
[27:10] the message expectation
[27:13] god told abram it told him to separate
[27:16] himself from all of his kindred
[27:19] and god never did bless him anymore till
[27:21] he obeyed him fully he was blessing him
[27:24] but further blessing required full
[27:26] obedience as long as his father hung
[27:28] along why the old fellow caused trouble
[27:33] and then he got with lot and then lot
[27:35] caused
[27:36] trouble
[27:37] and until he separated himself and got
[27:39] away from all the unbelief
[27:43] shook away from him
[27:45] then god came down and talked to him and
[27:47] something happened
[27:49] now you're going to find this over and
[27:50] over and over again to the point to
[27:51] where i have pages and pages of
[27:53] statements where brother branham is
[27:55] zeroing in on this principle that when
[27:57] god separated abraham from lot it
[27:59] expressed the principle that we are to
[28:01] separate completely from unbelief
[28:05] it wasn't well find the family member
[28:06] that doesn't quite believe it the way
[28:07] you do and have nothing to do with them
[28:09] it's the principle of separating from
[28:11] all unbelief
[28:12] until he separated and got away from all
[28:15] unbelief why because lot lot was causing
[28:17] trouble his dad was causing trouble but
[28:19] the principle was he had to get away
[28:20] from unbelief
[28:22] and the sermon jehovah jireh abraham
[28:24] started off he had trouble as long as
[28:26] his daddy was with him the old fellow
[28:29] died he says he said as long as his
[28:31] daddy was with him he had trouble the
[28:33] old fellow died then he took his nephew
[28:35] and as long as lot was along there was
[28:37] trouble
[28:39] god said separate yourself
[28:42] now this is a
[28:43] characterization of the influence that
[28:46] these relationships are having upon
[28:47] abraham trouble
[28:49] as long as it's around there's trouble
[28:51] as long as there wasn't unbelief in the
[28:52] garden there was no trouble now the
[28:54] unbelief is hanging around abraham he
[28:57] has trouble separate yourself walk alone
[28:59] with him that's the way god wants you to
[29:02] do separate yourself from all unbelief
[29:05] and walk alone with god
[29:08] this is the principle now and i want to
[29:09] reinforce it with a couple other
[29:10] statements uh at least another statement
[29:13] that
[29:13] god is calling abraham to separate from
[29:16] lot and what it represents is separation
[29:18] from unbelief
[29:20] a couple more statements in this brother
[29:23] abraham says in genesis the 15th chapter
[29:25] when he taught abraham the separation
[29:28] when abraham was ready to separate
[29:29] himself from unbelieving lot the
[29:31] lukewarm church member
[29:34] so now he's calling him to separate he
[29:36] taught him separation when he was ready
[29:38] to separate from unbelieving lot what is
[29:40] unbelieving lot he's the lukewarm church
[29:42] belief member so he's not a believer
[29:44] he's more akin to the make-believer or
[29:46] unbeliever because it's not genuine
[29:48] faith he's the lukewarm church member
[29:51] this is what god told abraham to do now
[29:55] again i want him to express the
[29:56] principle that we're not merely looking
[29:59] at it on a family level or physical
[30:01] level or even a literal level in terms
[30:03] of the relationships that we have but it
[30:06] has a deeper meaning to separate from
[30:08] unbelief
[30:10] he said he's ready to separate himself
[30:11] from unbelieving lot he says in another
[30:13] place then abraham was commanded
[30:16] to separate himself from all unbelief
[30:18] and walk with god alone
[30:20] well who what was he asked to do it
[30:22] wasn't just to become nomadic and a
[30:24] loner it wasn't just isolation for the
[30:26] sake of isolation yes god was wanting to
[30:29] get one man alone with his wife so he
[30:31] could raise back up the image of the
[30:32] fallen man and the fallen woman but
[30:34] there's also a deeper principle
[30:36] connected to the separation that god
[30:38] wanted to separate abram from unbelief
[30:42] so he says he commanded him to separate
[30:44] himself from all unbelief and then it
[30:46] says and instead of getting weaker he
[30:48] got stronger
[30:51] so whereas when unbelief entered in the
[30:52] beginning it led to death now as abraham
[30:55] begins to separate from unbelief instead
[30:57] of getting weaker he gets stronger so
[30:59] abraham's strength and his growth of
[31:02] character and the the robust faith he
[31:05] had to stand upon mount moriah and offer
[31:07] up his son as a sacrifice he did not
[31:09] reach that perfection of faith while
[31:11] unbelief hung near but he achieved it by
[31:14] removing himself from things that
[31:16] brought the wrong influence and
[31:18] expressed the wrong image
[31:21] and he got stronger instead of weaker
[31:23] so abraham's separation from lot lays a
[31:26] pattern of our separation from unbelief
[31:29] that's what it expresses
[31:31] as we read wednesday night god calls for
[31:32] a total separation to abraham's seed
[31:34] this is an abraham and his seed after
[31:36] him god calls for a total separation to
[31:38] abraham's seed because that's what he
[31:40] called abraham
[31:42] and he asked are you patterning it
[31:45] are you following the pattern
[31:48] this instrument is abraham
[31:50] this instrument represents this seed
[31:53] after him
[31:54] he's the measure
[31:56] he's the means by which something is
[31:58] measured he's the he's the thing that's
[31:59] calibrating and measuring and he's the
[32:01] one that's taking the temperature he's
[32:03] the one that's uh uh that we used to uh
[32:06] as a means of correction and as a
[32:08] standard he said this instrument is
[32:10] abraham the instrument represents his
[32:13] seed after him
[32:14] god called abraham from a total
[32:16] separation from unbelief
[32:19] we do not establish the principle that
[32:20] you should not have anything to do with
[32:22] your nephews that's not the principle
[32:24] expressed in abraham it's a principle of
[32:26] separation from unbelief
[32:30] i don't think this would surprise you at
[32:31] all but the uh the the name
[32:34] lot means covering
[32:36] and what i mean surprise you just that
[32:39] not that you all would have guessed that
[32:40] but that it would have some meaning or
[32:41] significance behind it but lot means
[32:43] covering
[32:45] and here
[32:46] god is calling abraham to separate from
[32:48] lot it's a separation from unbelief it's
[32:50] a separation from make belief
[32:52] it's a separation from religion
[32:55] because religion is a covering
[32:57] and so here's lot hanging near as a
[33:02] as a representation his name is lot and
[33:04] he's kind of hanging near and he
[33:06] represents this religion this covering
[33:08] and what was it that man did in the fall
[33:10] as soon as he fell he went and made
[33:12] himself a covering to hide his guilt and
[33:15] his sin and now here's law that is just
[33:18] expressing what mankind's response was
[33:21] to unbelief instead of addressing the
[33:23] sin addressing the air and making
[33:25] himself available to god he runs from
[33:28] the voice of god and he makes himself
[33:30] his own covering to hide his doubt to
[33:33] hide his unbelief and this is what lot
[33:35] is representing
[33:37] a religion that a dissonance that tries
[33:40] to cover up the fact that one knows
[33:42] they're wrong knows they're not right no
[33:43] something is out of order in god's word
[33:46] lot represents the religion that hides
[33:48] unbelief that hides sin that hides doubt
[33:54] the choice of sodom by lot
[33:57] if i could just lay this seed in there
[33:59] when lot chose sodom and gomorrah at the
[34:02] time
[34:03] it's all the plain of jordan because it
[34:04] looked good financially and economically
[34:07] and for the pleasures of life but what
[34:09] does sodom and gomorre represent the end
[34:12] time condition of satan's eden
[34:15] the climax the pinnacle the peak as it
[34:17] was in the days of lot it represents the
[34:19] mystery babylon here he is making this
[34:21] decision that is identifying the end
[34:25] time conditions of satan's eden and
[34:27] what's attached to it judgment
[34:30] moses right in there before the lord
[34:31] destroyed sodom and gomorrah they're
[34:33] wanting us to understand that that lot
[34:35] chose falsely
[34:37] based upon appearance something that
[34:39] appeared that looked like the garden of
[34:41] god but yet it was a it was a mystery
[34:44] babylon it was a harlot it was filthy it
[34:46] was wicked and it was subject to
[34:48] judgment
[34:52] and so with this
[34:55] and i think this is probably this is
[34:56] evident and the the course that we've
[34:58] been taking this morning
[35:00] of course if that it's not like it's a
[35:02] class you're not getting credit for this
[35:03] with me but there's no quizzes no grade
[35:06] but in the past that we've been
[35:07] traveling in this subject i want you to
[35:09] recognize this god is addressing the
[35:12] root of sin in the beginning
[35:13] that caused the fall of mankind
[35:16] this is what's taking place when god
[35:18] separates abraham from law and you're
[35:20] like well you know if he's like well is
[35:22] that really what he's addressing
[35:24] we're identifying the clear type
[35:27] it's very clear in the message of the
[35:29] hour we could say that in the beginning
[35:32] it was these circumstances existed and
[35:34] now begin to look at what was behind
[35:36] god's separating abraham from lord and
[35:38] we'll see that there's a clear parallel
[35:39] to what happened in the beginning even
[35:41] down to lot meaning covering envelope to
[35:43] cover up
[35:45] and then that is that is religion and
[35:47] that is the covering and that's what man
[35:48] resorted to in genesis chapter 3 to
[35:50] cover his sin and his guilt there's a
[35:52] clear connection in parallel there's a
[35:55] mystery hidden in genesis 1 to 4 which
[35:57] is connected to the call of god in
[35:59] abraham's life which is instructive to
[36:02] us to recognize the faith that's being
[36:04] cultivated in us as believers today
[36:08] so god is addressing the root of sin in
[36:09] the beginning that caused the fall
[36:12] brother makes this statement i've got a
[36:13] few statements here that i want to read
[36:16] just to clinch this
[36:18] remember when god called abraham to
[36:20] separate from lot what was he doing
[36:22] calling him to separate from unbelief
[36:27] brother branham and the message deity of
[36:28] jesus christ that man lost his origin in
[36:31] the garden of eden
[36:32] his relationship communion with god was
[36:35] cut off there because of sin and
[36:37] unbelief
[36:39] unbelief in what the word of god
[36:42] this is what caused the fall sin and
[36:44] unbelief unbelief in the word of god a
[36:45] picture was painted one time to eve and
[36:48] told her how much brighter it would be
[36:50] if she just
[36:51] discard the word of god look over here
[36:54] to reason
[36:55] and lot looked up and saw the
[36:56] well-watered plains of jordan
[36:59] and now eve is caused to look up over
[37:01] here and was just given a reason to
[37:03] reason
[37:04] there is a difference between reason and
[37:06] god's word
[37:07] god's word is true reason is false you
[37:09] can't reason out nothing our mind is not
[37:12] good enough nor never will be to fathom
[37:14] god's eternal wisdom therefore you can't
[37:17] reason it
[37:20] and that could be comforting right when
[37:22] we don't understand it realize well i
[37:23] guess
[37:24] that makes sense got my little human
[37:26] brain here
[37:27] got the mind of god it's not always
[37:28] going to make sense so this can be a
[37:30] comforting notion right it doesn't have
[37:32] to make you feel foolish i'm like yeah
[37:34] that makes sense that's why sometimes
[37:36] i'm not always really fully grasping why
[37:38] god's allowing certain things and why
[37:40] things happen a certain way and that's
[37:41] why things don't often make sense it's
[37:43] because i'm really here in my canary
[37:44] brain and here's god with this professor
[37:46] from purdue this one who's speaking uh
[37:49] divine things in high wisdom that i can
[37:51] only understand through the spirit
[37:52] that's what brother brahms identifying
[37:54] here the mind can't grasp it
[37:57] and he says you can't reason it you just
[37:58] got to believe it and so then the
[38:00] picture was painted out back there
[38:02] through the our first father and mother
[38:04] and they fell and that broke off
[38:07] relationship with god and was driven
[38:09] from the garden of eden
[38:13] it's this is very
[38:15] beautifully put and well detailed
[38:18] but unbelief broke the conditional
[38:20] covenant in the garden of eden
[38:24] and i want i want to say this so you
[38:26] recognize this
[38:28] unbelief
[38:30] unbelief can't survive the conditional
[38:32] covenant unconditional covenant given to
[38:34] abraham that you're also a member of
[38:37] part of
[38:38] i think about that unbelief broke the
[38:40] conditional covenant but unbelief can
[38:43] never survive
[38:47] it breaks a conditional one but it can't
[38:49] survive an unconditional one
[38:51] that means it's it's got to go
[38:54] and so this is unbelief that causes the
[38:56] fall christ is a mystery god revealed
[38:58] what killed eve
[38:59] unbelief
[39:02] is that right their unbelief in what the
[39:04] unbelief in god no
[39:06] she had faith in god oh
[39:10] sure did she did she say there is no god
[39:12] no sir she wasn't an infidel well she
[39:15] said you know i don't believe his word
[39:17] at all oh no she believed all but one
[39:21] little thing
[39:23] and one little thing with all the
[39:24] unbelief it needed to what
[39:26] kill her
[39:27] what killed eve unbelief what was the
[39:29] sin in the beginning unbelief what
[39:30] caused the fall unbelief
[39:33] it says in first timothy chapter 2 verse
[39:35] 14 and adam was not deceived but the
[39:38] woman being deceived was in
[39:40] the transgression in other words she's
[39:42] the one that crossed the line she went
[39:44] over against the word of god and just
[39:47] one promise slightly doubted caused all
[39:49] the fall
[39:51] it's what caused the fall it's what
[39:52] caused the woman to conceive death
[39:54] that's what caused the woman to bring
[39:56] forth wickedness that's what caused the
[39:57] woman to bring forth a child who was of
[40:00] that wicked one all it took was for her
[40:02] not to reject god in his entirety but
[40:04] just misplaced the promise just one
[40:06] promise slightly doubted just one
[40:08] promise slightly disbelieved
[40:10] just a slight turn away oh just look for
[40:13] a moment at this and consider whether
[40:16] this be fair and reasonable and then
[40:18] heard transgression if we really thought
[40:20] about said yep god made a perfect eden
[40:22] and all eve did was eat an apricot
[40:24] and this is what we get for the next 6
[40:26] 000 years
[40:28] and we think man god is just really
[40:29] trigger happy i mean this is really
[40:31] unfair that escalated quickly and you're
[40:33] thinking just overeating the fruit
[40:34] that's it and we could think that this
[40:36] is very unreasonable this is very harsh
[40:37] and this is a very
[40:39] wicked god but it was her sin in itself
[40:42] is very tremendous and great and
[40:43] violated many different principles but
[40:44] there's a way that you look and says
[40:46] what was what was wrong with just this
[40:47] slight as as many people believe it just
[40:50] the partaking of fruit but do you
[40:52] realize that the lot's wife her sin in
[40:55] the same way just a slight look back
[40:59] in the place that looked like
[41:02] the garden of eden now sin conceived in
[41:04] sodom and gomorrah and it's like lot's
[41:06] wife can't pull herself away
[41:09] from what it represented and just
[41:11] slightly turning back she's turned to a
[41:13] pillar of salt
[41:14] what condemned her unbelief
[41:19] the transgression just crossing that
[41:21] line
[41:22] and the sermon what shall i do with
[41:23] jesus called christ
[41:25] like by the same means that the mother
[41:27] eve corrupted the whole world to a
[41:29] physical death the mother eve mother eve
[41:32] corrupt corrupted the whole human race
[41:35] to physical death by rejecting the word
[41:37] and accepting something almost like it
[41:40] oh just how subtle that it was by
[41:42] accepting something almost like it by
[41:44] rejecting the word and accepting
[41:46] something almost not a complete
[41:48] repudiation like the devil showed up and
[41:51] he he sewed together a red suit with a
[41:54] pitchfork tail you know a fork and tail
[41:56] and and a pitchfork he showed up with
[41:58] horns he's like aha
[42:00] andy and he was trying to scare her and
[42:01] she's like you know what you're a much
[42:02] better representation of the god i want
[42:04] to serve than this other one that comes
[42:05] down the cool the evening and created
[42:07] all this it's something very much like
[42:09] it
[42:10] she caused all physical death because
[42:12] she left the word and believed the true
[42:14] word all but just a little bit
[42:17] one little disagreement with the full
[42:20] word of god caused every heartache every
[42:22] death and everything has ever been on
[42:23] the earth eve done it the mother of
[42:25] death
[42:27] now you see where we're coming the
[42:30] mother of death notice she just
[42:31] disbelieved the word
[42:33] so eve how did you become the mother of
[42:35] death but just disbelieving one little
[42:37] promise one little thing
[42:39] skip in a little bit just to um to con
[42:42] make this more concise in just a
[42:43] paragraph or so later he says notice a
[42:45] daughter is a product of a mother and a
[42:47] father by union now here's something
[42:49] shocking
[42:50] but death physical death is the uniting
[42:53] of mother eve and satan together by
[42:55] disbelieving god's word it's very heavy
[42:57] very heavy but i think if you recognize
[42:59] the concept that's even symbolically
[43:01] being represented in the garden this
[43:02] isn't very hard to digest
[43:04] in terms of it being right but it is
[43:06] very weighty very heavy it says they
[43:08] united and brought in the product of
[43:11] death death is a product of uniting
[43:13] satan and eve together eve had the word
[43:15] satan is against the word and almost 99
[43:18] and 99 hundredths of it
[43:19] satan admitted was right so close the
[43:21] bible said in the last days it would
[43:23] deceive the very elect if it was
[43:24] possible so how it comes in how it
[43:26] always been how how is it going out
[43:30] the same way united of unbelief and all
[43:32] the full word of god that's what brought
[43:34] death is uniting unbelief with the word
[43:37] unbelief just a little bitty part of it
[43:39] little bitty teeny bit 100th of one
[43:42] percent
[43:44] but it must be 100 percent
[43:46] that's all
[43:49] what caused the fall in the beginning
[43:51] unbelief what brought in all the trouble
[43:53] unbelief
[43:54] what did abraham have as long as he hung
[43:56] around lot trouble
[43:58] what was he doing when he called him to
[43:59] separate from lot
[44:01] calling him to separate from unbelief
[44:04] in john chapter 16 verses 8 and 9 this
[44:06] is just one scripture
[44:08] you can use to establish the principle
[44:09] that sin is unbelief and he's speaking
[44:11] of the comforter and when he has come he
[44:13] will reprove the world of sin and of
[44:15] righteousness and of judgment and then
[44:16] jesus comes
[44:18] of of sin righteousness and judgment and
[44:20] the next few several verses he says he
[44:22] will reprove the world of sin because
[44:25] they believe not on me
[44:28] this is showing us that sin is related
[44:30] to unbelief
[44:32] that sin in itself when it's distilled
[44:34] down at its most basic principle sin is
[44:37] unbelief
[44:38] sin is the root excuse me unbelief is
[44:40] the root of sin
[44:42] unbelief is the sap of sin it's the life
[44:45] of sin it's the chief power of all sin
[44:47] and i can say this unbelief is the sin
[44:50] unto death
[44:51] if all unrighteousness is sin and
[44:53] there's a sin not unto death there is
[44:54] there are attributes of sin but sin
[44:56] itself being unbelief it is the sin unto
[44:59] death
[45:01] and this is the part i want you to
[45:02] consider
[45:03] and i bring this in uh just knowing
[45:05] where where it stands in the word of god
[45:07] unbelief is the head of the serpent that
[45:09] christ was to crush
[45:11] it's the power of satan it was the power
[45:13] of the serpent it was the very thing
[45:15] that gave life
[45:17] that perverted life and gave
[45:19] manifestation to the devil's lies it was
[45:22] unbelief so unbelief is the head of the
[45:24] serpent that christ was ordained to
[45:25] crush
[45:26] it is the source of wickedness it is the
[45:28] source of evil it is the source of death
[45:30] it is the source of sin so in christ
[45:33] that he would bruise and crush the head
[45:34] of the serpent it was unbelief that he
[45:36] was going to crush
[45:39] so when god designated genesis chapter 3
[45:42] verse 15 the seed of the woman that
[45:44] would crush the serpent's head then he
[45:46] designated to abraham abraham came under
[45:48] anointing that required him to
[45:50] ultimately separate from unbelief
[45:53] he had to
[45:55] because it was part of the promise that
[45:57] was designated to him that he would
[45:58] crush the head of the serpent which is
[46:01] unbelief
[46:03] think of it this way as i need to kind
[46:04] of move this along
[46:07] sarah's womb was dead the bible even
[46:09] tells us that abraham did not even
[46:10] regard the deadness of his own body
[46:13] so there's no way that life could ever
[46:15] come to sarah by abraham until there was
[46:18] separation
[46:20] until there was separation from unbelief
[46:21] because unbelief brought death and until
[46:24] there could be life come through abraham
[46:26] he had to separate himself from lot
[46:31] now i want i'd like to take i would have
[46:34] wanted to take more time on this
[46:35] particular aspect
[46:37] but i um
[46:40] i have confidence in your robust
[46:42] imagination
[46:43] and your ability to paint a picture in
[46:45] your mind
[46:46] and to allow something just to rise up
[46:50] and create an image an accurate image
[46:53] but think about abraham now he's in a
[46:56] wilderness
[46:57] this is the contrast between what lot
[46:59] chosen what abraham chose the bible's
[47:01] wanting to be wants us to take the
[47:03] liberty to realize that
[47:05] lot took the good land
[47:07] i mean he has the he has the yard in
[47:10] phoenix that's over an acre and it's all
[47:12] real grass
[47:13] not a synthetic in it
[47:15] it's all real grass and it's well
[47:17] watered and it it it thrives all year
[47:19] long and actually has trees because
[47:21] elliot doesn't believe there's any trees
[47:23] in arizona at least not in phoenix and
[47:25] everything is just this is beautiful and
[47:28] abra abraham i mean
[47:30] you wouldn't even call it a rock garden
[47:31] i mean he just doesn't have anything
[47:33] he's just in the dust
[47:35] he's in the wilderness
[47:37] and here is abraham in a wilderness
[47:39] roaming growing old uh facing conflict
[47:42] in a land he's a stranger in this land
[47:44] he's concerned about the perizzites and
[47:46] the canaanites fierce people and abraham
[47:49] is just kind of plucking up his tent
[47:51] moving around going here and there
[47:52] roaming to and fro in a vast world and
[47:55] it's not even able to enjoy the riches
[47:58] of the land that god had promised him
[48:00] that's the picture of abraham and now
[48:02] just picture the woman
[48:05] in the garden of eden
[48:08] you you can't get a more contrasting
[48:11] picture not just because it's a man in
[48:12] the wilderness and a woman in a garden
[48:14] but just you start to drill down on what
[48:16] the wilderness was and what the garden
[48:17] was and here
[48:19] abraham is in
[48:21] the the dry
[48:23] desert with the body that is failing him
[48:25] with the wife with the dried up womb
[48:28] without any natural possession without
[48:30] any children after him yet seemingly
[48:32] able to accumulate great wealth and
[48:34] escape from conflict but it's a great
[48:36] contrast to the woman in a perfect
[48:39] garden in a paradise surrounded by
[48:42] perfection perfection perfection
[48:44] perfection
[48:46] and that's the contrast
[48:48] and this is what is said of abraham
[48:50] romans 4 19 to 21
[48:53] abraham being not weak in faith he
[48:55] considered not his own body now dead
[48:57] when he was about 100 years old neither
[48:59] yet the deadness of sarah's womb he
[49:02] staggered not at the promise of god
[49:04] through unbelief
[49:06] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[49:09] god and being fully persuaded that what
[49:12] he had promised he was able also to
[49:14] perform
[49:16] wow that's remarkable especially when
[49:18] you consider the fact that eve was in
[49:19] the middle of everything that was
[49:20] perfect and slightly doubted just a
[49:22] little bit
[49:23] and abraham really has no reason to kind
[49:25] of look around like
[49:27] i'm fine everything's great
[49:30] but yet he's he says all is well
[49:32] his disposition is that he was fully
[49:34] persuaded no matter how far away it was
[49:36] he staggered not at the promise of god
[49:38] through unbelief
[49:40] didn't consider the deadness all around
[49:42] him all the confirming circumstances all
[49:44] the confirming situations
[49:46] once he's separated from unbelief no
[49:48] matter how long time passed by his faith
[49:52] didn't get weaker it actually got
[49:54] stronger
[49:56] it's a paradox but think about it had
[49:58] abraham had the child at 75 he would
[50:01] have thought ah this whole boy still
[50:02] gots it right say sir i knew you could
[50:05] do it and they would have just thought
[50:06] hey we just you know just just happened
[50:09] late
[50:10] but it gets to the point to where it can
[50:12] only be god
[50:15] and so then it becomes only faith that
[50:17] you're counting on and that makes faith
[50:20] stronger when you're not
[50:22] not taking your focus and propping it up
[50:24] by all the other avenues all the other
[50:26] possibilities and everything well you
[50:28] know what maybe god will give me a job
[50:30] or the lottery's looking pretty good as
[50:32] long as you feel that you've got another
[50:34] escape route then faith is not loose to
[50:37] full be fully
[50:39] or if i could say it this way your faith
[50:41] is not free to fully persuade you
[50:46] but being fully persuaded so are we
[50:48] patterning it
[50:50] seems like such a clumsy word to say
[50:52] patterning it but are we patterning it
[50:56] how do we measure to this kind of faith
[51:00] abraham's faith growing stronger year
[51:02] after year why because it became more
[51:04] clear to him it was going to be god that
[51:05] does it
[51:07] and so he trusted in him alone as he
[51:08] walked with him and unbelief got further
[51:10] away he never had a reason
[51:13] to reason
[51:15] this part of the separation from lot
[51:16] there'd never be there wouldn't be this
[51:18] confusion about the promise
[51:20] notice what it says in 2nd corinthians
[51:22] chapter 6 verses 14 to 18.
[51:24] i want to bring out a very simple
[51:25] principle in this it reflected in god
[51:27] separating abraham from lot and it's
[51:30] connected to the fall in the garden
[51:31] which was by unbelief be not unequally
[51:34] yoked together with unbelievers for what
[51:36] fellowship hath righteousness with
[51:39] unrighteousness now notice the
[51:41] the um
[51:42] kind of the cadence here what communion
[51:45] hath light with darkness so what
[51:46] fellowship with righteousness
[51:48] righteousness with unrighteousness
[51:49] communion with light with darkness what
[51:51] concord
[51:52] with christ and
[51:54] have christ with belial or what part
[51:56] have he that believeth with an infidel
[51:59] and what agreement hath the temple of
[52:01] god with idols
[52:02] notice that beautiful cadence
[52:04] and the rhythm to that the fellowship
[52:06] that righteousness would have with
[52:08] unrighteousness the communion that light
[52:09] would have with darkness the concord
[52:11] that christ would have with below the
[52:12] part or portion that the believer hath
[52:14] he that believeth hath with an infidel
[52:16] would agreement would the temple of god
[52:18] have with idols and they are expressing
[52:20] different principles but it's more or
[52:22] less just to enrich this thought of what
[52:24] god is calling us to do when it says be
[52:26] not unequally yoked with unbelievers
[52:29] because then he brings it to this
[52:30] personal recognition as god hath he says
[52:33] for ye are
[52:34] the temple of the living god as god have
[52:36] said i will dwell in them and walk in
[52:38] them and i will be their god and they
[52:40] shall be my people this is a promise
[52:43] that was given to israel that repeats
[52:44] the promise that was given to abraham
[52:47] that i will walk with you and be your
[52:49] god this is some a promise he gave to
[52:51] abraham it's a promise repeated to the
[52:53] natural seat of abraham now paul is
[52:55] repeating to the royal seat of abraham
[52:57] it pertains to us wherefore come out
[52:59] from among them and be ye separate
[53:02] notice the call of separation as god
[53:04] separated abram out of babylon and
[53:06] brought him into canaan and ultimately
[53:08] separated him from lot he's now saying
[53:10] that we have to come out from under
[53:12] among them come out from among her my
[53:14] people wherefore come out from among
[53:16] them and be separate saith the lord and
[53:18] touch not the unclean thing and i will
[53:20] receive you
[53:21] notice the symmetry to the promise to
[53:23] abraham he had to separate then god
[53:24] could speak to him
[53:26] then god could come to him and will be a
[53:28] father unto you and ye shall be my sons
[53:30] and daughters said the lord almighty
[53:34] this is what god revealed himself to
[53:35] abram after separation i am the mighty
[53:37] god walk before me and be thou perfect
[53:41] this is a call clear call to separation
[53:43] from
[53:44] unbelief
[53:45] sometimes we just like to focus on the
[53:47] unbeliever
[53:48] so we we can pick and choose our friends
[53:50] well why don't you fellowship with
[53:51] someone oh well they're an unbeliever
[53:53] but it's not it's not the unbeliever
[53:55] it's the unbelief
[53:57] this is a separation from unbelief don't
[53:59] mix with things contrary to the word the
[54:01] contrary influences the contrary
[54:03] ambitions the things that try to take
[54:04] you away from the promise notice how it
[54:06] talks about fellowship communion concord
[54:08] part or portion agreement
[54:10] these are all terms of harmony
[54:12] these are all terms of unity and some
[54:14] commonality the portion they share in
[54:16] things what what sharing what harmony
[54:18] what agreement what common goal what
[54:20] motive do they commonly pursue
[54:23] and so he says do not be unequally yoked
[54:25] with unbelievers it means to join with
[54:27] one who has a different spirit to join
[54:29] one alien in spirit
[54:31] to not join so don't be unequally yoked
[54:34] don't don't join with something has a
[54:35] different nature don't join with
[54:36] something has it going a different
[54:38] direction because that causes conflict
[54:41] if a wagon train's going one way don't
[54:43] hit your wagon to it if you're wanting
[54:45] to go the other because that's competing
[54:46] in the in the progress you want to make
[54:49] this is the principle that's being
[54:50] expressed and it's drawn from paul is
[54:52] literally drawing from deuteronomy 22 10
[54:55] wherein the law spoke thou shalt not
[54:57] plow with an ox and an ass together
[55:00] in other words don't unequally yoke a
[55:03] beast of burden
[55:05] don't take an ox and place them with a
[55:06] donkey or a mule don't have them plowed
[55:08] together why according to deuteronomy 14
[55:11] the ox was a clean animal
[55:14] and the the ass was unclean
[55:17] and what what was it what did it relate
[55:18] to they had different natures
[55:21] the bible is pointing this uh this this
[55:23] uh this principle out that paul's saying
[55:26] be not unequally yoked and so one who
[55:28] had been read in the law and paul being
[55:30] versed in the law he's drawing from this
[55:32] image that's raised up in the law to
[55:34] where you wouldn't want to put an ox
[55:35] with a donkey you wouldn't want to put
[55:36] an ox with a mule because they have
[55:38] different kind of natures
[55:40] different work ethics respond to
[55:41] different kind of
[55:43] of commands and they're going to plow
[55:45] differently have a different canes a
[55:46] different pace can even have a different
[55:48] uh endurance and body structure he said
[55:50] this is this is not prudent this is not
[55:52] wisdom this is not going to facilitate
[55:54] the proper tilling of the ground
[55:57] and so when god is telling us through
[55:59] the word to not be unequally yoked we're
[56:01] considering more than just this physical
[56:04] isolation we're considering more than
[56:06] just this knee jerk while you don't
[56:07] believe life can't have fellowship with
[56:08] darkness we're considering what it is
[56:10] that god is wanting us to focus on and
[56:12] by virtue of our faith being focused it
[56:15] causes a necessary separation from all
[56:17] the forces that are trying to manipulate
[56:19] our view of the word of god and keep us
[56:21] back from the promise
[56:23] because think about it abraham and lot
[56:25] had different promises
[56:27] they had different natures as soon as
[56:29] god called abraham he begins to operate
[56:30] under a different nature they had
[56:32] different destinies
[56:33] therefore it was necessary for god to
[56:35] separate abraham from law to distinctly
[56:38] identify abraham's calling
[56:40] i cannot emphasize this enough to you to
[56:42] recognize that we have to be careful
[56:45] there's a way that satan wants to fold
[56:48] in
[56:48] different layers of unbelief and
[56:51] different colons and different uh
[56:53] stations and and and salvations
[56:56] and make us kind of all just one thing
[56:59] to where at the end of the day we find
[57:01] ourselves saying well then really how
[57:03] much different am i as the bride from
[57:05] everyone else
[57:07] what what what is difference is it we
[57:09] just get an early you know we get an
[57:11] early preview of eternity is that it
[57:14] like we get a sneak peek like buy
[57:16] fullest virgin we're getting to see this
[57:17] early but you'll be right where we are
[57:19] in just a moment
[57:20] we just get to see it we got like a vip
[57:22] pass we're in the green room there's
[57:24] more to it there is you are different
[57:28] the bride of jesus christ is different
[57:30] there's a there's such a uh god is very
[57:33] particular and distinct in the way that
[57:34] he describes things and the parables
[57:36] that are given and i cannot emphasize
[57:38] enough that you've got to recognize how
[57:40] how much different abraham was from lot
[57:43] lot that lukewarm formal cold foolish
[57:46] virgin unwise church member laodicean
[57:48] church member all the ways that he's
[57:50] described he has different promises he
[57:53] has different access to eternity he has
[57:55] different things he's judged by he is
[57:57] way different than abraham
[58:00] and god says as long as they're kind of
[58:01] hanging around and milling around then
[58:03] we're not going to recognize just how
[58:05] distinct i've made abraham
[58:07] and this difference that god is
[58:08] establishing within abraham comes up
[58:11] again when the king of sodom comes to
[58:13] him after the battle of the kings and
[58:15] wants to share a reward with abraham and
[58:18] he says i don't even want to take one
[58:19] thing from sodom
[58:21] because i don't want there to be any
[58:22] confusion as to what's blessed me and
[58:24] where my promise and my inheritance is
[58:26] he refused it whereas lot accepted it
[58:28] and lived there now abraham has this
[58:30] separation from unbelief and he knows
[58:32] there's a difference between those of
[58:33] sodom there's a difference of those that
[58:35] would pitch their tent towards sodom
[58:37] there's a difference and i am different
[58:41] as we mentioned wednesday night i want
[58:42] to mention it here as we
[58:44] oh goodness i'm about to say we're going
[58:46] to close but i got another page
[58:48] i didn't realize that whoa what are we
[58:50] going to do
[58:52] lot is still tied to babylon
[58:56] remember he leaves babylon but where
[58:57] does he end up sodom
[59:00] like man lot you did great you left
[59:02] sodom or you left babylon where are you
[59:03] now um i'm in sodom
[59:06] could you imagine you mail something to
[59:07] lot and it gets a change of address and
[59:09] you get a notice back and says his
[59:10] address has changed he's no longer in
[59:12] babylon you're like glory to god
[59:14] lot got the revelation
[59:16] his new address is sodom 666 sodom way
[59:22] sodom
[59:23] what is he doing anything oh that's
[59:25] horrible they start out so well hanging
[59:28] out with abraham
[59:30] and ends up in sodom
[59:31] what did he represent a distraction
[59:33] abraham
[59:35] a an influence upon him a a murmur we
[59:38] see in the the word of god how he's a
[59:39] murmur a complainer in the messenger
[59:41] kind of highlights some of those things
[59:43] and so lot signifies a confusion about
[59:45] the promise he he's representing what
[59:47] the mixing of the carnal with the
[59:48] spiritual
[59:50] him being family to abraham represents
[59:52] the old nature of abraham
[59:54] what does he measure by carnal eyesight
[59:57] carnal understanding this looks good
[59:58] this looks great unable to weigh the
[1:00:00] wickedness as being a detraction from
[1:00:02] wanting to have it
[1:00:04] this is what lot represents this is what
[1:00:06] lot signifies this is what god is
[1:00:08] separating abraham from
[1:00:11] and then the the message the communion
[1:00:13] then god showed in abraham what he would
[1:00:14] do for all
[1:00:16] not only was this blessed promise of the
[1:00:18] resurrection and eternal life given to
[1:00:20] abraham but to his seed after him the
[1:00:22] called the elected of god and we noticed
[1:00:25] that abraham out in the field where he
[1:00:26] was sojourning his brother he called it
[1:00:28] lot it really was his nephew his
[1:00:29] brother's son and the time come for the
[1:00:31] testing
[1:00:33] and lot weakened under the testing
[1:00:36] he has a perfect picture of the carnal
[1:00:37] believer today when the testings come to
[1:00:40] stay on the barren land abraham gave him
[1:00:42] his choice and lot lifted up his eyes
[1:00:44] and saw the fields the valley and it was
[1:00:46] full of grass it was also full of uh
[1:00:48] fine homes it was full of gaytis also
[1:00:51] full of sin there's your contrast but
[1:00:54] lot being of the carnal nature
[1:00:57] loving this present world more than the
[1:00:58] things to come chose rather to live
[1:01:00] luxurious in this life than to have life
[1:01:04] hereafter
[1:01:06] remember the different natures being
[1:01:08] unequally yoked different natures
[1:01:09] different desires different ambitions
[1:01:11] different things that feed different
[1:01:12] things that motivate different things
[1:01:13] that you're trying to accomplish abraham
[1:01:16] a perfect type of the true believer
[1:01:17] who's been washed in the lamb whose
[1:01:19] affections was set on the things above
[1:01:21] said i'll take the way with the lord's
[1:01:22] despised few regardless if it cost my
[1:01:25] popularity whatever it cost i'll take
[1:01:27] the way with the lord's few
[1:01:30] the working title i had for a lot of
[1:01:32] these things that i was accumulating and
[1:01:33] studying the supreme faith walks
[1:01:36] alone by necessity
[1:01:39] but by character
[1:01:42] he chose a perfect type of the true
[1:01:43] believer
[1:01:45] whose affections are set on the things
[1:01:46] above so abraham his sights are on
[1:01:49] eternity his side strong glory he seeks
[1:01:50] the city not made with hands whose
[1:01:52] builder and maker is god lot is only
[1:01:54] looking with the natural eye eventually
[1:01:57] that that's what drew them apart
[1:02:01] that lot was willing to go a direction
[1:02:03] that abraham was not willing to go and
[1:02:06] brother braham says in the message faith
[1:02:07] of abraham separate yourself think about
[1:02:09] this just let this kind of shake you i
[1:02:11] know we're kind of in the lateness of
[1:02:12] the service here but he says let's get
[1:02:15] out with god alone like abraham
[1:02:18] we are abraham's seed let's show it show
[1:02:21] that we believe god
[1:02:23] this is it's necessary
[1:02:26] there's a way maybe it's easier for men
[1:02:28] just to kind of just to simulate in and
[1:02:30] their wives to really stand out but
[1:02:32] there has got to be there is a calling
[1:02:34] and a measure given in the word of god
[1:02:36] whereby others will know they may not
[1:02:38] know exactly what we are and where we
[1:02:40] come from but they'll know there is a
[1:02:42] difference
[1:02:44] and there's enough in this word of god
[1:02:45] that we can embrace there's enough that
[1:02:47] we can stand for there's enough
[1:02:49] influence it can have on what we say
[1:02:51] what we do what we watch what we wear
[1:02:53] how we treat other people to where we
[1:02:55] can be show that we believe god
[1:02:59] but notice where the problem was
[1:03:01] and as long as abraham held on to two
[1:03:03] little things
[1:03:06] two little things was his dad and his
[1:03:08] nephew
[1:03:10] as long as abraham held on to two little
[1:03:12] things
[1:03:13] it was holding him back
[1:03:15] just two little things
[1:03:17] i ask you today
[1:03:19] what little things are you holding on to
[1:03:23] what are what little things could it be
[1:03:24] ideas
[1:03:26] could it be the past
[1:03:28] just little things that are holding you
[1:03:30] back they held back abraham
[1:03:32] because don't for a minute think that
[1:03:34] i'm uh
[1:03:36] this challenge is to lot
[1:03:39] it's to abraham
[1:03:41] you're abraham's seed
[1:03:43] so you're being challenged because you
[1:03:45] have a promise that is greater you have
[1:03:46] a calling that is greater and we could
[1:03:48] take a step and say are there things
[1:03:50] that are holding me back
[1:03:52] just two little things my past
[1:03:54] my future my ambitions my goals my ideas
[1:03:57] certain ideals
[1:03:59] bill graham says in the message look
[1:04:02] when your mind and eyes can be single to
[1:04:04] that word and focus that in until you
[1:04:06] see exactly what god is doing what a
[1:04:07] wonderful thing
[1:04:09] do you hear that when your mind and eyes
[1:04:11] can single be single to the word focus
[1:04:14] in on what god is doing
[1:04:16] that's a wonderful thing abraham saw it
[1:04:18] he did not look into the
[1:04:19] misunderstandings of the promise because
[1:04:21] there were
[1:04:22] but he didn't look to him what if he
[1:04:24] would look and see here i'm 75 years old
[1:04:27] and such as such a voice spoke to me and
[1:04:28] said i'm to have a baby my wife she's 65
[1:04:31] years old about 15 20 years past
[1:04:33] menopause what would have he done
[1:04:35] but what did he do he never paid any
[1:04:37] attention to what the natural things
[1:04:38] were he looked at what god said it
[1:04:41] became such a reality to him till he
[1:04:43] didn't see anything else but what god
[1:04:45] said he left his home he separated
[1:04:47] himself from all unbelief anything that
[1:04:49] would try to pull him away he separated
[1:04:51] himself so he could walk alone that's
[1:04:54] what every genuine believer has to do
[1:04:56] separate yourself from these doubters
[1:04:58] and unbelievers and walk with christ
[1:05:00] it's life to you and abraham did such a
[1:05:03] thing and 25 years later we find him
[1:05:06] still believing the same promise
[1:05:09] why he had focused his mind to the will
[1:05:11] of god by the word of god and believed
[1:05:13] it
[1:05:14] if we can focus ourself to the plan of
[1:05:17] god to what god wants for us and what
[1:05:19] god promised us and let everything else
[1:05:22] alone
[1:05:22] no matter how long it is just keep
[1:05:24] believing romans 4 here we find romans 4
[1:05:27] 14 it said and he staggered not at the
[1:05:29] promise of god through unbelief he
[1:05:31] didn't let unbelief contaminate him at
[1:05:34] all
[1:05:35] it's going to be nearest it's going to
[1:05:36] be in the land it's going to be right
[1:05:37] there in our face but we can't let it
[1:05:39] contaminate his he looked to one thing
[1:05:42] that was the voice that spoke to him
[1:05:44] that's what the church ought to do today
[1:05:45] look to the one thing the voice the word
[1:05:47] of god that speaks to us churches and
[1:05:49] people can speak any way but look to the
[1:05:52] voice
[1:05:53] it's the voice that eve disobeyed
[1:05:57] it's the voice that abraham submits to
[1:05:59] it's a contrary voice that sold the
[1:06:01] seeds of unbelief that caused her to
[1:06:03] stray to bring trouble
[1:06:05] and so when god calls abraham he's
[1:06:07] bringing us right back to the same image
[1:06:09] it's now a voice calling him to separate
[1:06:11] from the unbelief that has been sowed
[1:06:12] into humanity
[1:06:15] therefore abraham's separation from lot
[1:06:17] stands for our separation
[1:06:20] from unbelief
[1:06:22] to now begin to crush the head of the
[1:06:25] serpent
[1:06:27] that brought forth sin in the beginning
[1:06:32] the nature
[1:06:33] and character of lot
[1:06:36] points back to the nature and character
[1:06:37] of the woman in the garden
[1:06:41] where is she united with unbelief lot is
[1:06:43] united with unbelief he's characterized
[1:06:45] by it
[1:06:46] she's in a perfect eden
[1:06:48] with a perfect promise and a perfect god
[1:06:51] but the woman fails on one promise
[1:06:53] that's it
[1:06:54] just one
[1:06:56] and when god separates abraham
[1:06:59] he does it to release his faith
[1:07:02] so the promise could be fulfilled
[1:07:04] remember unbelief broke the covenant
[1:07:06] now unbelief can't survive the new
[1:07:08] covenant
[1:07:09] so god has to crush it he has to
[1:07:11] separate it he has to call abraham
[1:07:13] completely out of it
[1:07:16] we mentioned it wednesday night
[1:07:18] and it comes to my it comes in the image
[1:07:20] here now as i ponder this as we close
[1:07:23] the process that's taking place in
[1:07:25] abraham's life was a matter of god
[1:07:26] putting him in position to receive the
[1:07:28] promise
[1:07:30] everything's intentional everything even
[1:07:32] is symbolic he's an instrument and he's
[1:07:34] expressing something what god does to
[1:07:36] abraham he does to a seat after him now
[1:07:37] he's the instrument he's laying a
[1:07:39] pattern he's portraying something he's
[1:07:40] painted a picture and so god the process
[1:07:42] that's taking place in abraham's life is
[1:07:44] the process of god placing abraham in a
[1:07:47] position
[1:07:48] he's getting abraham in a condition to
[1:07:50] manifest the promise
[1:07:52] and so much of the things that are
[1:07:54] taking place in abraham's life we refer
[1:07:56] to as a preparation getting him in
[1:07:58] condition what is he doing he's
[1:07:59] conditioning abraham for supreme faith
[1:08:02] he's putting him through the paces he's
[1:08:03] exercising him he's causing conflict
[1:08:06] conflict delayed is conflict multiplied
[1:08:08] so he's allowing conflict to come and
[1:08:09] it's addressed he's increasing his
[1:08:11] character he's brought in his vision
[1:08:12] he's putting footsteps to the promise
[1:08:14] all these things are taking place in
[1:08:16] abraham because god is removing him and
[1:08:18] walking him through things and he's
[1:08:20] being put in the condition to what
[1:08:22] received the promise
[1:08:24] being placed in position
[1:08:27] brother branham says in the message
[1:08:28] perfect faith and i just
[1:08:30] i was wrestling with whether or not i
[1:08:32] should just leave this off and come back
[1:08:34] to it but i've been uh
[1:08:36] drawn to this the last few service
[1:08:38] services when a man lives by faith and
[1:08:40] walks by faith i mean substance faith
[1:08:43] he is isolated from the entire world and
[1:08:45] becomes a new creature in christ
[1:08:48] there
[1:08:49] now you're getting into bride material
[1:08:54] notice what the separation was for
[1:08:56] to make a difference of the material
[1:08:58] to make a difference in the condition
[1:08:59] you're getting into rapture and
[1:09:01] condition now that means for each one of
[1:09:03] us not just the pastor deacon's trustees
[1:09:04] that means for the laity every
[1:09:06] individual walks in a world with god
[1:09:08] alone
[1:09:10] you're baptized into this kingdom
[1:09:11] there's nobody in there but you and god
[1:09:12] he gives the orders and you pack them
[1:09:14] out whatever he says there's not a
[1:09:15] shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right
[1:09:16] on if the lord says this there's nobody
[1:09:18] in the world can talk you out of it you
[1:09:20] go right on just the same he says now
[1:09:22] when we see this
[1:09:23] now you're coming into perfect faith
[1:09:26] perfect perfection that cannot fail
[1:09:29] i love the addendum perfect perfection
[1:09:31] that cannot fail
[1:09:33] that faith never fails yes
[1:09:36] he is speaking of christ he was a mystic
[1:09:38] to them with his perfect faith
[1:09:41] and so is it now with those who have
[1:09:43] perfect faith
[1:09:44] are a mystic to others
[1:09:47] this perfectly describes abraham
[1:09:52] he is the he is the first mystic as it
[1:09:54] was
[1:09:56] christ was a mystic with his perfect
[1:09:57] faith we know that we're taught that
[1:09:59] abraham's faith reached perfection made
[1:10:01] perfect by his offering of isaac upon
[1:10:03] the altar
[1:10:04] but a mystic is a person who seeks
[1:10:06] whether it be by contemplation or
[1:10:08] meditation or thought but seeks by even
[1:10:10] self-surrender to obtain a union with
[1:10:13] deity
[1:10:14] even if you just put it in a mysticism
[1:10:16] or some other uh other religion in the
[1:10:18] world a mystic would be somebody who by
[1:10:20] meditation and by discipline and
[1:10:21] self-surrender they're going to achieve
[1:10:22] this oneness and become one in this
[1:10:24] harmony with some sort of deity bible is
[1:10:27] using this language to describe jesus
[1:10:29] it's a language we can use to describe
[1:10:30] abraham and he is one who sought to
[1:10:33] become one with the divine
[1:10:36] it's one who believes in the spiritual
[1:10:38] apprehension of truths that are beyond
[1:10:40] intellect that's what a mystic would be
[1:10:41] in even a romanticized spiritual way or
[1:10:44] even kind of a uh um some of the
[1:10:47] religions of the world that want to
[1:10:48] attain to a nirvana or have some sort of
[1:10:51] uh style of meditation and reflection
[1:10:53] and contemplation or some sort of inner
[1:10:55] peace and some sort of harmony with
[1:10:57] nature it's one who believes in the
[1:10:59] apprehension of truths that go beyond
[1:11:01] the flesh and beyond the intellect
[1:11:04] and in this mysticism of christ we can
[1:11:06] see the same mysticism in abraham
[1:11:08] whereas he was seeking a city beyond the
[1:11:10] flesh a city whose builder and maker was
[1:11:12] god he was believing in things that
[1:11:14] could not even be ver verified
[1:11:16] physically abraham you're sterile
[1:11:20] your wife doesn't have any eggs there's
[1:11:22] no way you guys can have children no
[1:11:23] matter how bad it would seem he was
[1:11:26] bonded with the promise beyond he had
[1:11:28] crossed over he has a different
[1:11:30] viewpoint versus lord who all he can
[1:11:32] judge by are natural things and lack the
[1:11:34] spiritual discernment of the wicked that
[1:11:36] lays within the beauty
[1:11:39] what a difference
[1:11:41] and we are likened to the same when you
[1:11:43] come into perfect faith you are a mystic
[1:11:45] to others you're different you're an
[1:11:47] outlier you're separated from them
[1:11:50] brother mike if you could come
[1:11:52] in the message perfect faith again
[1:11:55] you just
[1:11:56] catch this
[1:11:58] this is at the very very end he says i'm
[1:12:00] working out something see it's taking
[1:12:01] this charge of faith
[1:12:03] and going right back to begin and come
[1:12:05] in
[1:12:06] to kind of raise faith in the bracket
[1:12:09] so this is a higher faith
[1:12:11] this is a growing faith this is a
[1:12:13] supreme faith this is a perfect faith a
[1:12:15] bracket where you've never noticed it
[1:12:17] that way before
[1:12:18] not a faith but a perfect faith
[1:12:23] remember eve had a faith
[1:12:26] but just
[1:12:27] misplaced a promise not a faith but a
[1:12:30] perfect faith built up in here and watch
[1:12:32] a perfect god with the perfect heart
[1:12:34] keep a perfect promise by his perfect
[1:12:36] word
[1:12:39] now we're right back where the woman was
[1:12:41] but in satan's eating
[1:12:43] watch a perfect god with a perfect heart
[1:12:45] keep a perfect promise by his perfect
[1:12:46] word that's right where abraham was
[1:12:49] he had an opportunity to watch a perfect
[1:12:51] god with the perfect heart keep a
[1:12:52] perfect promise by his perfect word
[1:12:54] which is sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:12:56] and a discerner of the thoughts of the
[1:12:57] heart it's what god manifested before
[1:12:58] abraham in genesis 18. so he says we are
[1:13:01] coming now to the perfection because the
[1:13:04] people have to come to this in order for
[1:13:06] the rapture
[1:13:08] notice the order perfection first then
[1:13:10] the rapture
[1:13:11] it's not rapture into perfection but
[1:13:12] it's rapturing condition
[1:13:14] for a rapture
[1:13:16] that's what's holding it away right now
[1:13:18] it's waiting for the church to come into
[1:13:20] that perfect raptured faith
[1:13:24] some uh transcribing that says i'm
[1:13:26] looking for it he says looking for it it
[1:13:28] means a lot of shaving down for me some
[1:13:32] of the earlier uh um transcription said
[1:13:34] shaking
[1:13:36] i think the same thought is conveyed in
[1:13:38] both but shaving down
[1:13:40] think about that a lot of shaving down
[1:13:43] a lot of carving away
[1:13:44] a lot of honing a lot of separate it
[1:13:46] means a lot of shaving down for me
[1:13:50] it means a lot for you could i say a lot
[1:13:52] more maybe
[1:13:53] means a lot for you
[1:13:55] but together we'll make it by the grace
[1:13:57] of god
[1:13:59] why abraham made it
[1:14:02] you're the seed of abraham you can't
[1:14:03] miss it
[1:14:04] but it means a lot of shaving down
[1:14:07] for me he says he's saying about himself
[1:14:09] a lot more for us
[1:14:11] perhaps but together we'll make it by
[1:14:14] the grace of god
[1:14:17] the image that's portrayed to us in god
[1:14:18] separating abraham from lot is not that
[1:14:20] we have some sort of disdain for family
[1:14:22] or those that don't see things the way
[1:14:24] that we do
[1:14:25] mention it wednesday night and it
[1:14:26] behooves us it behooves me to mention it
[1:14:28] again
[1:14:29] abraham's separation from lot produced
[1:14:31] no nastiness in abraham's spirit towards
[1:14:34] lot he maintained a christian spirit one
[1:14:36] that was willing to go to great lengths
[1:14:38] to see that lot was redeemed and rescued
[1:14:42] and sometimes the false conception of
[1:14:43] separation is what produces a nastiness
[1:14:46] produces a separation on the basis of
[1:14:48] personality and pretense and politics
[1:14:51] and for really
[1:14:52] the narcissistic ambitions of men who
[1:14:56] are afraid to be vulnerable and afraid
[1:14:58] to uh to admit mistakes and try to build
[1:15:01] up their own kingdoms and isolate and
[1:15:03] tear down other things and what we
[1:15:05] realize with abraham is he was fine with
[1:15:07] lot having everything was beautiful and
[1:15:09] perfect and he would take those things
[1:15:11] which weren't perfect knowing one day he
[1:15:12] would possess them all and he still
[1:15:14] maintained the right attitude towards
[1:15:16] lot
[1:15:18] we must do the same thing
[1:15:21] and recognize that the principle that
[1:15:22] god portrays in the supreme faith of
[1:15:24] abraham
[1:15:26] is that in separating from lot he
[1:15:27] reproduced the image of one man and one
[1:15:29] woman with the promise of children in
[1:15:32] the possession of a land
[1:15:34] identified in the first covenant to the
[1:15:36] man and the woman and the possession of
[1:15:37] a garden in eden
[1:15:40] but mankind lost that through the fall
[1:15:42] so in the separation from lot there's
[1:15:43] more that's represented he's also
[1:15:45] representing that abraham was being
[1:15:47] called away from unbelief that destroyed
[1:15:50] the original covenant
[1:15:52] and it's a testimony to us that we ought
[1:15:54] to accept right now as believers that if
[1:15:56] there be anything in me that's contrary
[1:15:59] to the word of god it shall not survive
[1:16:02] the unconditional covenant and that god
[1:16:05] will as long as necessary work upon me
[1:16:08] and shave me until every attribute of
[1:16:12] unbelief is gone
[1:16:14] so the separation is not so much
[1:16:16] external and my fingers pointed at you
[1:16:18] and my fingers pointed at that but it
[1:16:19] begins with me focusing on faith
[1:16:23] and that when abraham focused on the
[1:16:25] promise and he focused his eyes upon the
[1:16:27] word brother man said he focused his
[1:16:29] eyes on the voice it was when abraham
[1:16:31] began to focus his eyes upon the promise
[1:16:34] and he said lot why don't you separate
[1:16:37] from me we can focus on the promise and
[1:16:40] it'll be our refocused and re-energized
[1:16:43] and more
[1:16:44] deliberate purposeful faith that'll
[1:16:46] actually begin to cause the separation
[1:16:48] of unbelief that exists within ourselves
[1:16:51] the contrary nature the memories the
[1:16:53] ideas anything that's holding us back
[1:16:55] that's the separation that god wants to
[1:16:57] achieve
[1:17:01] if that's not what starts it
[1:17:04] then we're just cultish
[1:17:06] when we cut other people out
[1:17:09] we're just cultists when we look down on
[1:17:10] other people and cultists when we talk
[1:17:12] about this and talk about that and have
[1:17:14] a kind of elitist attitude towards
[1:17:16] everything else
[1:17:17] separation begins with inner
[1:17:19] self-reflection
[1:17:21] and self-awareness
[1:17:23] of god you're separating the royal seat
[1:17:24] in me from the seat of lot
[1:17:29] and let that be
[1:17:30] let that be the work that god does in us
[1:17:32] as believers
[1:17:33] let that be the principle that's
[1:17:35] expressed to us it's a very vast
[1:17:36] principle that has application a lot of
[1:17:38] areas but i want you to see that
[1:17:39] principle
[1:17:41] that it's a separation from unbelief
[1:17:46] stand together today
[1:17:47] [Music]
[1:17:52] thank you for your attentiveness today
[1:17:55] it's evident
[1:17:56] by
[1:17:58] the
[1:18:00] expression on your faces it's evident by
[1:18:03] the pull that you have upon the word
[1:18:07] as we close
[1:18:09] in prayer
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:13] you have every right as the seed of
[1:18:14] abraham to lift
[1:18:16] a thought to him a prayer to him a heart
[1:18:18] to him
[1:18:19] it's a lot of needs that exist uh in
[1:18:23] in our church if you just look at it
[1:18:25] that way our local body here different
[1:18:27] relationships that we have and families
[1:18:28] that are represented here there's a lot
[1:18:30] of
[1:18:30] difficult decisions being made and
[1:18:34] difficult parts of journeys
[1:18:36] we have a lot to pray for
[1:18:38] it's a troublesome time
[1:18:41] in the world today
[1:18:43] but we can find solid footing
[1:18:46] i don't believe you can find it in him
[1:18:49] it's bowerheads
[1:18:51] you have a need look to him now
[1:18:53] heavenly father
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:19:00] your word calls for a total separation
[1:19:02] from unbelief
[1:19:03] [Music]
[1:19:06] and i
[1:19:11] i come to you today with the desire
[1:19:14] that you as the potter
[1:19:18] would mold me in the image
[1:19:20] that you see me in
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:23] lord i come to you willing to be
[1:19:25] vulnerable i come to you willing to be
[1:19:26] open
[1:19:28] about things that exist in my thought
[1:19:29] process and my instincts and my behavior
[1:19:31] even in my attitude towards others
[1:19:34] that more aligns with lot than it does
[1:19:37] with abraham
[1:19:40] and i want to be honest with myself
[1:19:41] today and maybe even self-aware enough
[1:19:43] to say lord i need help
[1:19:46] this isn't about what others have done
[1:19:48] to me it's about what is in me
[1:19:50] but what i allow to continue to exist
[1:19:54] about the lot instinct to the religion
[1:19:56] that tries to cover up
[1:19:59] and lord for a moment i'm willing to be
[1:20:01] vulnerable before your presence and let
[1:20:02] your heart
[1:20:04] word search mine
[1:20:08] and lord if there be anything in me
[1:20:10] that's contrary to the promise anything
[1:20:12] that would hinder and delay
[1:20:14] your visitation as it was with abraham
[1:20:16] lord i pray
[1:20:18] now you would bring a separation
[1:20:22] lord i can in my own self focus on the
[1:20:25] word of god and i do that now and i
[1:20:27] begin to take inventory of my daily
[1:20:29] habits and the life that i'm leading and
[1:20:31] things that i'm pursuing and the
[1:20:34] things that have become very close to me
[1:20:35] and begin to shape my thinking
[1:20:38] and my perceptions oh god i pray now
[1:20:40] that you would just
[1:20:42] catch the attention of every believer
[1:20:43] that's here this morning that is
[1:20:45] allowing themselves to have their view
[1:20:47] of this world shaped by a lot
[1:20:49] whether it be their own instincts their
[1:20:51] own feelings or view of the world or an
[1:20:53] ideology or anything that would try to
[1:20:56] mix itself with the promise or cover up
[1:20:58] something that needs to be made right oh
[1:21:00] god i pray today
[1:21:02] that there could be a genesis 13
[1:21:04] experience in our lives to get the
[1:21:06] distance from sodom to get separation
[1:21:08] from the nature of lord
[1:21:10] to walk alone with you
[1:21:13] bless us we pray lord as we remember the
[1:21:15] requests that have been made
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:18] lord the challenges that we're facing we
[1:21:19] commit ourselves to you bless us now
[1:21:22] as we are dismissed soon may your
[1:21:24] presence go with us may you be with the
[1:21:26] people may our eyes be upon the promise
[1:21:29] continually
[1:21:31] we love you we ask this in the name of
[1:21:32] the lord jesus christ
[1:21:34] amen
