[0:00] title tonight might seem when you look
[0:03] at it a little bit grammatically clumsy
[0:06] but it is deliberately phrased that way
[0:10] but it's how does love look and you
[0:13] admit maybe it sounds like a little bit
[0:15] slangy or maybe not exactly how you'd
[0:17] say it but how does love look and
[0:19] phrased it this way kind of just struck
[0:21] me a little bit different angle this
[0:23] morning just to title what I'd been
[0:24] working on differently
[0:26] and we're maybe not going to take time
[0:28] to review the other parts that we've
[0:30] been in thus far because I think each
[0:31] one of these can stand on their own but
[0:33] they certainly build into a very
[0:35] beautiful picture but what we are doing
[0:37] in looking at perfect love is addressing
[0:40] those things that hinder us from fully
[0:43] receiving perfect love and then in turn
[0:45] and maybe by consequence if we can't
[0:47] fully receive perfect love then we
[0:49] certainly can't fully Express perfect
[0:51] love or we have a difficult time
[0:52] expressing perfect love so if you want
[0:55] to jot down this title I think you'll
[0:56] find that there's a lot of ways that
[0:58] this is going to unfold to us but we're
[1:00] looking at the title is how does love
[1:01] look
[1:03] now as we've
[1:04] red already in this how bringing that
[1:07] comparison between slay Cain who slew
[1:10] his brother and then us who ought to lay
[1:11] down our lives for the Brethren it says
[1:13] in John chapter 15 verses 12 and 13 He
[1:16] says this is my commandment that you
[1:18] love one another as I have loved Jews so
[1:21] he kind of he inches us towards it's not
[1:23] just having feelings for one another and
[1:25] saying I love you but it can manifest
[1:28] itself in the same way that as I have
[1:30] loved you and that love caused him to
[1:32] sanctify himself for other sake it
[1:34] compelled him to do things for their
[1:36] sake and love drove him to do things oh
[1:39] well as Christ loved me I ought to love
[1:42] others likewise so that's kind of the
[1:44] standard he raises but then he says
[1:46] greater love hath no man than this that
[1:48] a man lay down his life for his friends
[1:51] so He suggests not just a high standard
[1:54] but maybe the highest standard this is
[1:56] not just a great love but it's the
[1:58] greatest love is he calls it a greater
[1:59] love and he's pointing to the ultimate
[2:02] sacrifice of laying down our life lives
[2:05] and we could look at this in the sense
[2:07] that it refers to a life of living for
[2:09] others so this is eternal life is living
[2:11] for others and I think we could probably
[2:13] do some mathematics to say that Zoe life
[2:16] or God's own life is eternal life and
[2:18] then say that God is love and then kind
[2:21] of do the math and so eternal life is
[2:23] love and eternal life is living for
[2:25] others so perfect love is living for
[2:26] others and I think that's scripturally
[2:28] correct it'd be correct according to the
[2:30] word and so it refers to living for
[2:33] others and having a life of service but
[2:35] I I'll be honest I studied this from the
[2:39] standpoint of is there any way at all
[2:41] that we could break these words down and
[2:43] shoehorn in any other definition or
[2:46] meaning to suggest that we wouldn't he's
[2:48] not talking about literally laying down
[2:50] your life but it is he is speaking of
[2:52] the culmination of death
[2:55] and so not just service but actual
[2:57] sacrifice and giving of himself
[2:59] he says in John chapter 10 verse 11 I am
[3:01] the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd
[3:03] giveth his life for the Sheep so Christ
[3:06] says love one another as I have loved
[3:08] you and greater love nobody has any
[3:10] greater love than this and this is the
[3:11] greatest love that a man laid down his
[3:13] life for his friends so and he's
[3:15] speaking of his own not just service but
[3:18] sacrifice of himself for us and for our
[3:21] the Forgiveness of our sins
[3:23] so when John says in First John 3 16 I
[3:26] believe he's carrying forward these
[3:28] things that Christ taught and he says
[3:30] hereby perceive we the love of God I
[3:32] believe last Wednesday we said he's
[3:33] talking about trying to figure out God's
[3:35] love and what it looks like and how we
[3:36] can kind of grasp and catch oh he must
[3:39] love me because he did something for me
[3:40] he says hereby perceive we the love of
[3:42] God because he laid down his life for us
[3:45] so there's a there's a thought that I
[3:47] want you to hold in mind but then he
[3:49] says and we ought to lay down our lives
[3:51] for the Brethren so we know and
[3:54] understand the love of God and that he
[3:55] acted according to that love he gave
[3:58] himself he sacrificed his life for us
[4:00] and then he takes it a step further and
[4:02] says and we ought to lay down our lives
[4:05] for the brethren
[4:07] now
[4:08] um I think there's it begs certain
[4:11] questions
[4:12] and I'll qualify this because I'm not so
[4:14] much wanting to get him maybe into the
[4:16] specifics and details of this but we
[4:18] cannot physically die to redeem somebody
[4:21] else
[4:22] we understand that when he says that we
[4:25] ought to lay down our lives for the
[4:26] Brethren that we cannot say oh I'll die
[4:29] so that my son can be saved or I'm
[4:31] willing to die so that um so that they
[4:33] can receive eternal life that sacrifice
[4:35] has already been done it's not necessary
[4:37] that any one of us would need to give
[4:38] our lives physically in order to redeem
[4:41] someone so when he says that we ought to
[4:43] lay down our lives for the Brethren I
[4:45] feel like we could say what does that
[4:46] even mean
[4:47] right what does it mean I got to lay
[4:49] down my life for the Brethren and then
[4:52] even it kind of carrying back to even
[4:54] the Genesis of it as Christ taught the
[4:56] disciples how do I love others as Christ
[4:59] loved them and we look at Christ and say
[5:01] well here he was he was sinless he was
[5:03] born with the nature of God inside of
[5:04] him had a perfect relationship with the
[5:06] father and uh it must have been easy for
[5:09] him to love or it must have been so
[5:11] clear that he could look out upon others
[5:12] and say well I know you gave me the
[5:14] leaven and this one is of the wicked one
[5:16] and and he could just look at everything
[5:18] the right way maybe know the end from
[5:19] the beginning and we might think well
[5:21] just made it easier on him so we think
[5:23] well then how is it that I can love as
[5:25] Christ's love
[5:26] and and again we're just asking the
[5:28] question I know you're jotting this down
[5:29] saying all right great we're going to
[5:30] get answers tonight but I think it's
[5:32] just good to stimulate thought
[5:34] and and get a lot of questions out there
[5:36] and make us desperate for answers and go
[5:37] to him whom as who has the answers the
[5:39] Lord but I think it kind of moves into
[5:42] that territory where I believe that
[5:43] we're all sincere tonight and if we
[5:45] could speak to the children and maybe
[5:47] just a hinting that kids eat free is
[5:50] that I think children ought to be
[5:51] desired to be to love their parents more
[5:53] correctly and show them honor and to
[5:55] obey them and do as the scripture tells
[5:56] them but maybe it's more applicable to
[5:59] us as believers who are filled with the
[6:01] Holy Ghost and serving God is if I'm to
[6:03] love others as Christ loved them how is
[6:05] it that I can be Christ to my spouse
[6:08] how can I be Christ to my family how can
[6:11] I be Christ to my neighbor and if I'm to
[6:13] love my neighbor as myself how do I love
[6:16] myself correctly to in turn love my
[6:18] neighbors correctly and it really does
[6:20] kind of open up a whole area of thought
[6:22] to say I know I want to be christ-like I
[6:24] know I want to be the love of God
[6:26] extended in his hands and his eyes and
[6:29] his feet but what does that even look
[6:31] like
[6:32] I mean if we're if we're driven by the
[6:34] scripture and even it's just it's letter
[6:36] it's black lettering on white paper that
[6:39] well if someone sees their brother and
[6:41] in need and I shut up the bowels of
[6:42] compassion uh then how can the love of
[6:45] God dwell in me does that compel me then
[6:46] whenever I see a need that I've somehow
[6:49] got to fulfill it and do it just because
[6:52] the needs there I got to fulfill it and
[6:53] if I don't him I somehow uh bankrupt of
[6:55] the love of God and we'd say these are
[6:58] good questions could you please answer
[6:59] them in the next 45 minutes right
[7:02] and I would say that we have to look at
[7:05] the love of God to understand what the
[7:07] love of God is instead of just grasping
[7:09] a hold of the letter and trying to
[7:11] carnally fulfill it thinking that in
[7:13] doing so we have the love of God or that
[7:15] we're fulfilling his love
[7:17] and so I think it begins by again by the
[7:20] kind of the track that we've been on to
[7:22] the first five services in that if we do
[7:24] not perceive God's love correctly
[7:27] then we can never manifest his love
[7:30] correctly
[7:31] if there's any anything that interrupts
[7:33] our perception of it that if we in turn
[7:35] try to express it and we try to express
[7:38] a perverted uh understanding then we're
[7:40] going to get similar results and if I
[7:42] don't understand his love for me and I'm
[7:45] in turn with the misunderstanding trying
[7:46] to express the Misunderstood love then
[7:48] my love isn't going to be projected
[7:50] correctly what I'm projecting isn't
[7:51] going to match the image of God's true
[7:54] love
[7:55] and so we're maybe the question could be
[7:57] what does love look like
[7:59] and so we need to see it correctly in
[8:01] order to express it correctly
[8:03] and I will uh I'll say this just by the
[8:07] very very remote chance that anyone in
[8:10] the smallest of ways remembers a sermon
[8:13] that I preached over a year and a half
[8:14] ago on barriers and boundaries and on
[8:17] love has limits and
[8:20] go ahead and say that again a little bit
[8:21] louder
[8:22] okay this is great all right we're just
[8:25] going to relax tonight
[8:27] but or maybe I should get nervous that
[8:28] you remember it that well but on I love
[8:31] having limits I believe it's Part Parts
[8:33] eight and nine of the series on berries
[8:35] and boundaries and so and I've looked
[8:37] back through the things we've ministered
[8:39] in the last couple years and see that
[8:40] there's a lot I'm repeating a lot of
[8:42] things we've already covered and we're
[8:44] uh we're revisiting some common themes
[8:46] but I'm hoping tonight that by grabbing
[8:49] a hold of things that we've already
[8:50] taught on and that you know very very
[8:51] well even prior to when we taught on it
[8:53] that we can actually gain better
[8:55] perspective of these things because I'm
[8:57] I'm not afraid to keep just preaching
[8:59] the same thing over and over again
[9:00] because really at the end of the day
[9:01] this could just be titled Jesus Christ
[9:04] part 243.
[9:06] right and we could just call it that and
[9:08] so we know that we're preaching the word
[9:10] over and over we're faithful we want to
[9:12] be faithful to the nature of Christ when
[9:14] we preach so I'm not really afraid of
[9:15] repeating the same thing over and over
[9:17] again uh I remember a friend of mine
[9:19] brother Mike Price one time as uh we
[9:21] were talking about preach I don't know
[9:22] if I was even preaching at the time but
[9:25] um I was visiting or traveling with him
[9:27] when he was preaching and I said Do you
[9:29] ever write down what you preach because
[9:30] he preached a different place three or
[9:31] four times a week and he goes no I never
[9:33] write it down I go
[9:35] what if you end up preaching the same
[9:36] thing twice and he goes well if God led
[9:39] me to preach it the first time and I go
[9:41] by that the second time then God that's
[9:42] my excuse as God just led me to do it
[9:45] and I was like well that's really really
[9:47] good so I I was didn't make a habit of
[9:49] writing things down and just being a
[9:50] young preacher I mean when I finally
[9:51] started preaching I preached something
[9:52] at my home Church there in Texas at the
[9:55] time and after it was all over with the
[9:57] brother was standing outside he goes
[9:58] yeah brother Aaron I really enjoyed that
[10:01] service and it was good when you
[10:02] preached it a few months ago he said but
[10:04] you guys it was good again I really
[10:06] enjoyed it is that the moment was like
[10:07] oh
[10:09] I just preached the same thing a few
[10:10] months later so if I'm doing that at
[10:13] least I'm very much self-aware tonight
[10:15] that I hope that in looking at it again
[10:17] we're able to get a little bit deeper
[10:19] into it because I believe we should not
[10:21] Tire of hearing the truth as long as
[10:23] it's inspired and it's in season and so
[10:26] I will be covering a lot not necessarily
[10:28] length but there's a lot that I'm going
[10:30] to be covering I think it's going to be
[10:31] real heavy real Heavy Deep stuff that
[10:33] we're covering and I know that you've
[10:36] heard it before but I'm hoping that in
[10:38] being able to repeat these things it
[10:39] makes a deeper impact and that we could
[10:42] just make a little bit more relevant
[10:43] emphasis maybe emphasize a little bit
[10:45] different angle as we look into this
[10:47] and so the love of God
[10:50] and and I I would say the love God's
[10:52] love that he has for us and even our
[10:54] love for God is not always in the image
[10:56] that we would expect it to be in even if
[10:59] we borrowed from trying to do God of
[11:00] service without it being his will we
[11:01] might think oh well if I love God this
[11:03] is what I do this is what I would do and
[11:05] God would say that might look
[11:06] extravagant to the world but I don't
[11:08] that means nothing to me and so we know
[11:10] that there's a certain way that we may
[11:11] try to love God that he cannot receive
[11:14] because it's not his will and then also
[11:16] the love that he has for us is not
[11:19] always in the image of what we would
[11:20] expect so it's kind of how love looks
[11:24] and in first John chapter 4 verse 16 he
[11:27] says and we have known and believed the
[11:30] love that God hath to us so when he says
[11:32] we have known and believed the love that
[11:34] God hath to us it's essential to know
[11:36] his love and to trust his love and John
[11:38] just says it so absolute and kind of an
[11:41] assumptive way and I think that it's
[11:42] okay for us to revisit this and say I
[11:44] want to know it more I need to trust it
[11:46] more and this be kind of instructive to
[11:47] us and so he's saying we had known and
[11:50] believed the love that God had to us and
[11:52] I'll say that this true love that he's
[11:54] talking about is tied to knowledge and
[11:56] experience
[11:58] that for us just to say oh I know God's
[12:01] love
[12:01] could just just mean that we've heard
[12:04] about it or we have some knowledge but
[12:05] it's important that we experience it
[12:07] that we that we know it by experience
[12:09] and not just knowledge so I think that's
[12:11] true faith is John's teaching it is
[12:13] knowledge and experience he goes we have
[12:15] known and believed the love that God had
[12:16] to us God is love and he that dwelleth
[12:19] in in love dwelleth in God and God in
[12:22] him now in verse 80 also says God is
[12:24] love so this is something that he has
[12:25] repeated twice in the same chapter God
[12:28] is love
[12:30] now if I can say this God having many
[12:32] different attributes and many different
[12:34] characteristics that the way that he's
[12:36] saying it and we're drawing this from
[12:37] other scriptures that this is kind of
[12:39] the crowning reigning attribute of God
[12:42] this would be like the Capstone as it's
[12:43] described in the Statue of a perfect man
[12:46] this charity that resides on the capping
[12:48] of a perfect man this is God's reigning
[12:50] attribute it's one of those uh it's it's
[12:53] a sense the essence of his divine nature
[12:55] this attribute of love so God is love
[12:58] and I think we've mentioned this before
[12:59] but not all love is God
[13:03] because you say that when it says God is
[13:05] love we have to be careful to say it's
[13:06] not that God equals love because we said
[13:09] God equals love then whenever we see
[13:10] what we think to be loved we say oh well
[13:12] that's god well that's not true God is
[13:14] love but you can't necessarily invert it
[13:16] whenever I look at something like that
[13:18] the the the example I like to use is all
[13:21] lafontaines are singers right
[13:24] but not all singers are LA fontaines and
[13:27] that to me we can all just immediately
[13:28] yeah I get that I perfectly understand
[13:30] that and so we can see that what one
[13:32] thing may be true of God that God is
[13:34] love but then we can't just try to
[13:35] invert that say well God equals love and
[13:37] wherever we see love that's God no you
[13:39] kind of have to tap the brakes because
[13:41] not all love is God so it can't just be
[13:44] perfectly inverted that I think how we
[13:47] could read this I hope that reading this
[13:48] in a way to not breaking any new ground
[13:51] with you but I think this is the way
[13:53] that I like to share it because it's
[13:54] helped me through the years to
[13:55] understand love he says God is love
[13:57] whatever God is whatever God does
[14:00] whatever God says that is perfect love
[14:04] that God God cannot and I'm going to
[14:06] just keep hammering this home God cannot
[14:09] do something like well that's not love
[14:12] whatever he does is love because God is
[14:15] love so it's something that true love
[14:16] this true love it's a pure love it's a
[14:19] it's without hypocrisy that there's
[14:21] times when maybe we we we try to express
[14:24] love and we realize well I I love this
[14:27] is love but is it was it really truly
[14:29] love in the end or what was it well
[14:31] that's this is done in such a way he
[14:33] says that's not love that's anger that's
[14:35] frustration that's fear that's doubt and
[14:37] maybe it's kind of hid behind this this
[14:39] covering of Love With God whatever God
[14:42] says whatever he does that is love
[14:44] we could accept it as such God who is
[14:47] love and this God who is Charity he is
[14:50] in the Bible he is light he is fire he
[14:53] has Mercy he is jealousy he is gracious
[14:55] he's referred to as Holiness and
[14:57] righteousness there's all different ways
[14:58] that we could characterize God even we
[15:01] say God is love but God is a light God
[15:03] is a fire
[15:04] there's a lot of ways we can describe
[15:05] him and so if we I would put it this way
[15:09] as it says God is love he said this is
[15:12] one of those
[15:13] some is this this umbrella attributes
[15:16] and one of these tying reigning themes
[15:18] when it comes to love God that this is
[15:20] something that is it at the essence
[15:22] inherit in all his other attributes
[15:24] or this this fact that he is love is
[15:27] kind of what SEALs the Perfection of all
[15:29] other attributes so God could be a
[15:31] jealous God but if he wasn't love that
[15:33] jealousy could be perverted so there's
[15:35] different ways you can look at realize
[15:36] there's something that is sealing this
[15:38] that love is so essential to his nature
[15:40] and his character
[15:41] and if we broke it up as God is light
[15:43] God is jealousy God is righteous God is
[15:45] Holiness or God is this rainbow of
[15:47] different attributes
[15:48] I all of God's characteristics
[15:51] every single one of his attributes
[15:53] harmonize with all the other attributes
[15:55] so a singular attribute of God must
[15:58] harmonize with all the other attributes
[16:00] of God there can't be one that's Out Of
[16:02] Tune there's not an outlier where God is
[16:05] love and God is this and God is that and
[16:07] then all of a sudden well and God does
[16:08] this which is really a complete opposite
[16:11] of all his other attributes and
[16:13] characteristics it doesn't work that way
[16:14] every single expression or manifestation
[16:17] will harmonize with all the other
[16:19] expressions and manifestations and will
[16:22] contribute to the understanding or the
[16:24] working out of all those other
[16:25] attributes in other words they're never
[16:28] at odds
[16:29] God's love will never compete with if
[16:31] you say he's a jealous God a loving God
[16:33] cannot compete with his the the his
[16:35] other nature of being jealous a God of
[16:38] Justice cannot compete with the god of
[16:39] righteousness there's I guess just used
[16:41] a word that's exactly the same in the
[16:42] Old Testament so I just stated the
[16:44] obvious but God cannot work in any way
[16:46] to have some sort of manifestation that
[16:49] is at odds with or competes with any of
[16:51] his other attributes
[16:53] I would say therefore as his attributes
[16:55] we should not compete with one another
[16:58] but as we've looked at Divine love and I
[17:00] think
[17:03] let me just refer back to something
[17:05] we've said before that we say that agape
[17:07] love is God's love and uh filial love is
[17:10] human love now we're not wanting to be
[17:12] super strict in that and doctly strict
[17:14] to where we just stay with those Greek
[17:16] words to understand love but we use
[17:18] those to understand the truth that there
[17:19] is a love of God there is a true love of
[17:21] God
[17:22] and that love when we use Agape it
[17:24] speaks of a love of a higher
[17:26] intelligence so perfect love is a love
[17:28] of a Divine intelligence it is a love
[17:30] that's attached to purpose it's a love
[17:32] that's attached to reason and an
[17:34] expected end and just as we know that
[17:36] God's ways are not our ways and his
[17:39] thoughts are not our thoughts and his
[17:40] ways are higher than our ways and his
[17:42] thoughts are higher than our ways then
[17:43] there's a love Which is higher than our
[17:45] love and there's a love that's um that's
[17:47] not like our love and it is that love of
[17:50] God
[17:51] is perfect love
[17:52] in First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 5
[17:55] 5 this is a Chapter 13 of First
[17:58] Corinthians would be a very obvious
[17:59] place to spend a lot of time in
[18:02] it says love speaking of Charity doth
[18:04] not behave itself unseemly I'd like to
[18:06] come back to that but look at these
[18:08] three other attributes seeketh not our
[18:09] own is not easily provoked thinketh no
[18:12] evil I think when we looked at this
[18:14] before we saw what love is what it isn't
[18:16] what it does what it doesn't that you
[18:18] could just see this as you read through
[18:19] First Corinthians this is what it is
[18:21] this is what it isn't this is what it
[18:23] does and this is what it doesn't and it
[18:24] kind of tells us the limits to love and
[18:26] how it operates within certain things
[18:28] and so and it says that it seeketh not
[18:31] her own there's a lot that we could
[18:32] spend on this but I'm just mentioning it
[18:34] as this is part of part of the
[18:36] attributes and characteristics of God's
[18:37] love or Divine love or charity it's
[18:40] selfless it does not seek does not act
[18:44] solely for its own benefit or for its
[18:46] own advantage or its own gain so it's
[18:48] not going to say well love love acts in
[18:51] a way to where it's like I can benefit
[18:52] from this so I'm going to do it
[18:54] it's not merely interested in self so
[18:56] love
[18:58] this is going to be a challenge to our
[18:59] female love our human love love does not
[19:02] seek to gratify its own want
[19:04] and is not solely interested in its own
[19:06] happiness
[19:08] now I could say that love will act in
[19:10] interest of its joy and love will act
[19:12] and interest of its desire but that's
[19:14] not the sole thing it wants to achieve
[19:16] is like I know I'd be the worst thing
[19:18] for you but I want you right it's it's
[19:20] an understanding of what is best and
[19:22] what is proper when it says it's not
[19:24] easily provoked it's not easily
[19:25] irritated or angered so it's speaking
[19:27] kind of back to its long suffering and
[19:30] those attributes of it then it says
[19:32] think of No Evil and I wanted just to
[19:33] throw this in there as I feel that I'm
[19:35] sensing I'm running out a little bit of
[19:37] time tonight
[19:38] but when it says it think of No Evil
[19:40] it fully forgives just freely it's free
[19:45] to forgive it fully forgives instead of
[19:47] imputing evil against Defenders so when
[19:49] I have been offended against when it
[19:51] says love pure love or perfect love
[19:53] thinketh no evil it's when if I'm
[19:56] operating in this kind of love this
[19:57] charity this Agape when it says it
[19:59] thinks no evil it's referring to
[20:01] thoughts of forgiveness and that I don't
[20:03] I'm not just oh you did this to me I'm
[20:05] imputing evil to you but it just has
[20:07] this Liberty to forgive but Abraham
[20:09] mentioned it on Sunday I believe we're
[20:11] Stephen uh even in the moment that he's
[20:13] crying out I said don't lay this to
[20:15] their charge I mean what what beautiful
[20:16] words
[20:17] in the face of anger in an unrighteous
[20:20] judgment on their part and it's akin to
[20:22] the love that Christ expects on the
[20:24] cross
[20:24] father forgive them for they know what
[20:26] not what they do that's that that's
[20:28] charity operating where it's not seeking
[20:31] evil in the face of evil being done to
[20:33] you
[20:34] so and and hope you're paying attention
[20:37] but when love is operating and it says
[20:39] it seeketh it thinketh no evil it
[20:42] doesn't kind of mull on retribution
[20:44] it's not meditating on Revenge or
[20:46] contriving evil against others and while
[20:49] he did this to me then this is what I
[20:50] want to do to him
[20:52] and so it's not in that it's free from
[20:55] that and it's forgiven and I realize to
[20:58] me how much this connects with the love
[21:00] of God because to do that as Mortals
[21:03] we're really trusting the Lord
[21:05] because the part of us that wants to
[21:06] hold on to an offense hoping that it's
[21:08] addressed and that the person pays and
[21:10] gets what they're due for it but when we
[21:12] can just let go of it then we're
[21:14] trusting the Lord that he's the judge
[21:16] that that God who sees all things and
[21:19] knows all things that he'll be the one
[21:22] that that'll see that uh it what is done
[21:24] what is right and what is just will be
[21:26] done
[21:26] now as we back up to do not doth not
[21:29] behave itself unseemly
[21:32] the word that's used there is it means
[21:34] not Unbecoming or unfitting in other
[21:37] words Love Is Never inappropriate
[21:39] and it comes from the word which means
[21:41] indecent or deformed and that to me was
[21:44] really striking and it's it's used of a
[21:46] word that is related to schema and kind
[21:50] of the alternate form of the words as
[21:52] they're kind of related and worked
[21:53] together it's kind of fashion and it's
[21:55] that which comprises everything in a
[21:57] person which strikes the senses the
[21:59] figure the bearing the discourse the
[22:02] actions and manner of Life the habitus
[22:04] and so when love behaves itself does not
[22:07] behave itself inappropriately in other
[22:09] words it'll it never acts out of
[22:11] character of its image
[22:13] that if if love is a certain way you
[22:15] don't all of a sudden see these outliers
[22:18] you don't see that that love has two
[22:20] arms and ten fingers and and this is
[22:22] love but then all of a sudden it kind of
[22:24] grows this other gnarly arm it's like
[22:26] love just won't do that because it does
[22:29] not behave itself unseemly it's not
[22:31] inappropriate it'll never act outside of
[22:33] what is right and appropriate for it so
[22:36] Christ or we say charity which is God or
[22:39] Christ never acts out of character
[22:42] so when God acts when he speaks or Acts
[22:45] and let's say in truth God speaks or he
[22:47] acts that if we perceive it as evil then
[22:50] we've misunderstood it
[22:53] or if anything supposes to be God
[22:57] an action or word but it is evil then
[23:00] it's not
[23:01] because God cannot there's no way that
[23:03] he can ever act in a way that's
[23:05] inappropriate and outside of his
[23:07] character and outside his fashion so
[23:09] when it says charity does not behave
[23:10] itself unseemly that perfect love is
[23:13] always right
[23:15] perfect love is always correct
[23:18] in Romans chapter 13 verse 10 love
[23:20] worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore
[23:23] love is the fulfilling of the law I
[23:26] think it's remarkable when we look in
[23:28] the what sums up all the law and the
[23:30] prophets and how all the law and
[23:32] everything hangs on his Commandments to
[23:33] love the Lord thy God with everything
[23:35] and thy neighbor as thyself he said this
[23:38] is what fulfills the law
[23:39] because there's something incredible
[23:41] about loving God perfectly
[23:44] and then being able to love others like
[23:47] that and listen that if you do that then
[23:49] you're God you're Godlike like you've
[23:51] you've fulfilled the purpose of the law
[23:52] and I think they should speak to us a
[23:54] lot of what God's trying to accomplish
[23:55] but says love works no ill
[23:58] to his neighbor and I think this fits
[24:00] right back in the verse 5 of chapter 13
[24:02] of First Corinthians therefore love is
[24:04] the fulfilling of the law that that last
[24:07] part I want just to hang over this as we
[24:10] read this but love worketh no ill it's
[24:11] not capable
[24:13] of working evil against somebody else
[24:16] it's not evil of figuring conspiring and
[24:18] contriving evil against your neighbor it
[24:20] can't do it so if you commit evil
[24:23] against your neighbor unto the guise or
[24:24] pretense of love right it's not
[24:28] no matter how much you claim well love
[24:29] is corrective and you'll sometimes love
[24:31] hurts and we believe in tough love
[24:33] around here and no matter how much you
[24:35] say it if it is evil if it works ill to
[24:37] the neighbor then it's not it's not love
[24:40] love can never defraud
[24:43] love never works through deceit love
[24:45] will never injure love is never never
[24:47] works in a way that's selfish or jealous
[24:50] and in a negative sense
[24:52] and so there is
[24:54] uh
[24:55] there is nothing that you can do Under
[24:57] the pretense of love that would defraud
[25:00] or deceive or injure somebody because
[25:02] love works no ill
[25:04] to his neighbor
[25:07] the Jews have a saying there is no
[25:08] service like the love of God
[25:11] because it's pure
[25:13] and so there can be if this is what true
[25:15] love is or perfect love there can be no
[25:17] evil motive that we attribute to God's
[25:19] love that oh he only did this because
[25:21] and there's some sort of nefariousness
[25:23] or some wickedness there or we can't
[25:25] attribute any kind of wicked objective
[25:27] so his motive and objective is always
[25:28] right
[25:30] it's not selfish it's not self-serving
[25:32] and can we not admit that as humans
[25:34] there's times when our love and the
[25:36] things we do to express love there's
[25:39] maybe something we want back in doing it
[25:41] maybe it's not always pure unselfish
[25:44] and so if I could say this I might maybe
[25:47] just going to hit these scriptures very
[25:48] quickly and just move on
[25:50] but because love
[25:52] Works no ill to his neighbor
[25:55] and love love never acts out of
[25:58] character of God's nature and his his
[25:59] manner of life or all his other
[26:02] essential attributes
[26:04] love will never withhold a good thing
[26:08] it gives what is proper if something
[26:11] good is due love gives it
[26:14] now we sometimes wrestle as humans in
[26:17] our love where maybe we withhold a good
[26:18] thing maybe maybe there's something
[26:20] we're a little bit reluctant and this is
[26:21] where we're drawing a lot on these
[26:23] complexes uh that that complicate God's
[26:25] love and we're thinking oh well this and
[26:27] that and I want to be a little bit
[26:28] selfish I need to be guarded I need to
[26:30] be a little bit sure but love will not
[26:31] withhold a good thing nor will it ever
[26:33] give an evil thing
[26:35] it's always proper it's always
[26:36] appropriate it's always just first
[26:39] Thessalonians 5 15 see that none render
[26:41] evil for evil unto any man
[26:43] but ever follow that which is good both
[26:45] among yourselves and to all men
[26:48] and though there's it maybe leaves a lot
[26:50] to be desired in that what does it mean
[26:52] to fall after charity what does it mean
[26:53] to follow good with all men and to
[26:55] ourselves and to one another what is
[26:57] that what does that look like and that's
[26:58] kind of the question we're asking but
[27:00] it's at least saying that we should
[27:02] never rindle evil for evil because
[27:03] that's not right
[27:05] to when someone has done evil to you and
[27:07] you render it back that's not love
[27:10] so he says that we should follow that
[27:11] which is good both among yourselves and
[27:14] to all men that we that's that's our
[27:16] objective as Christians because that is
[27:18] Christ
[27:20] as we read this in First Peter chapter 3
[27:22] verses
[27:23] 8 9 10 and 11.
[27:26] I think it kind of just speaks to this
[27:27] theme and maybe we won't spend a lot of
[27:29] time amplifying it
[27:30] but it will it'll definitely
[27:32] um kind of Target some things that are
[27:34] very very relevant in this finally be
[27:37] you all of One mind having compassion
[27:40] one of Another Love is Brethren be
[27:42] pitiful be courteous some of us may not
[27:45] have a hard time being pitiful but some
[27:47] of these other things we may need to
[27:48] really work at but of one mind having
[27:51] compassion love his brother be pitiful
[27:53] kind of merciful be courteous these are
[27:56] attributes that we ought to Aspire to
[27:58] not always being that you know I'm I'm
[28:00] strict and I'm serious and you know this
[28:03] this word you know it's it's it's the
[28:04] Rapture and bust and we we kind of all
[28:07] use it as just a means to be mean to
[28:08] people
[28:10] and we're using well it's the word of
[28:12] God isn't it right
[28:13] and we and we try to do as the thieves
[28:15] did to the uh the the man on the on his
[28:19] way to Jericho that we just Rob him and
[28:21] beat them and take everything away from
[28:22] and we don't care that they're clothed
[28:24] we don't care that they're wounded well
[28:26] the word of God is sharp
[28:28] you mess with it you're going to bleed a
[28:29] little bit and so there's a little bit
[28:31] of way we're justifying these things but
[28:33] it's kind of saying having compassion
[28:34] one of Another Love is Brethren be
[28:36] pitiful be courteous
[28:38] um I took the scripture out and I
[28:40] realized now just maybe how necessary it
[28:42] was but I mentioned it before in Luke
[28:44] where he says if any man doesn't hate
[28:46] right then he's not worthy to be my
[28:48] disciple
[28:51] the the hard sayings of Christ are only
[28:54] pure to those who find them hard
[28:58] right
[28:59] in other words if he says to hate and
[29:01] you're like yes
[29:03] yes right
[29:05] I hate them with the perfect hatred yes
[29:06] favorite scripture and some of you could
[29:08] probably quote it
[29:10] right because it's your password
[29:12] whatever Psalm that is Boom hashtag
[29:14] dollar sign this is it
[29:18] and perfect spelled p three right and
[29:21] you got it you just perfect hatred as
[29:23] your password some of you get nervous
[29:26] and if that's easy
[29:28] then it's not pure
[29:32] if it's if it's and so I think I think I
[29:35] kind of mentioned that because it
[29:37] doesn't spill over to this other side oh
[29:38] we're just compassionate and we just
[29:40] love
[29:41] man love is not what you think it is
[29:44] but you have to have compassion you have
[29:45] to love his brother and be pitiful be
[29:47] courteous not rendering evil for evil or
[29:49] railing for railing well if you're going
[29:50] to talk about me I'll talk about you but
[29:52] contrary rise blessing
[29:54] do good unto those who use you and and
[29:56] just and harm you knowing that you're
[29:59] there and too cold that you should
[30:01] inherit a blessing for he that will love
[30:03] life and see good days I think that's
[30:06] good do we want to love life and see
[30:07] good days let him refrain his tongue
[30:09] from evil and his lips that speak no
[30:11] guile let him assure evil and do good
[30:14] let him seek peace and ensue it
[30:17] these these virtues are are no longer in
[30:21] the conscience of modern day Christians
[30:24] they're not they're completely perverted
[30:26] and if they're not completely perverted
[30:28] they're repudiated
[30:30] and they and they they I think the
[30:32] comparison is they wanted Jesus who's
[30:34] more like John Wayne than the Jesus that
[30:35] actually was Jesus
[30:38] and so they these are things that are
[30:39] very uh applicable to love and the
[30:42] expression of love and how that I ought
[30:43] to have a heart for other people and
[30:45] having love and compassion and not
[30:47] rendering evil for evil because love's
[30:48] not going to give evil back when evil
[30:50] has been given so what perfect love does
[30:52] is it pursues righteousness
[30:54] this is the good and not speaking evil
[30:57] and not and speaking no guile a shoe
[30:58] evil do good seek peace and Sue it these
[31:01] are things saying that love pursues
[31:03] righteousness it's always going to act
[31:05] to promote truth
[31:06] it's always going to act because it
[31:08] wants to fulfill God's perfect will
[31:11] now do you hear that love is always
[31:13] going to act to promote God's perfect
[31:15] will
[31:16] now that right there is a great
[31:18] moderator of behavior
[31:20] now it might appear cruel
[31:22] it might hurt it might even offend it
[31:25] could even be called in some ways uh
[31:29] offensive and harmful in demeaning and
[31:32] derogatory it might be a lot of ways a
[31:34] lot of language that the world would use
[31:35] for things that are in fact
[31:37] righteousness but that's only the human
[31:39] instinct
[31:40] that's only the human understanding
[31:42] that's the human view that's what human
[31:44] love looks like and that's how it looks
[31:47] to us and that's how human love use
[31:49] things so whenever we see something a
[31:50] certain way we may shrink back I'm like
[31:52] oh that's awful
[31:54] could could we not make the argument
[31:55] that how could love demand the sacrifice
[31:57] of one son
[31:59] and so just upon that basis alone we
[32:01] could realize that the love of God could
[32:02] look very messy it can look very hard it
[32:05] could look very cruel it can be
[32:06] offensive it might not comport with all
[32:08] our ideas of sensitivity and fairness
[32:10] and Equity but yet God's word is always
[32:13] right
[32:15] and his love will always line up with
[32:17] his word
[32:19] now because of this
[32:21] the the fact that I hope I'm hope I've
[32:23] been able to with these scriptures
[32:24] present that love perfect love
[32:28] acts within the character of God
[32:32] and that it is and that we all likewise
[32:34] want to act within the character of God
[32:36] but from someone else's vantage point
[32:38] the way that God's character is
[32:40] expressed the way love is expressed it's
[32:42] it doesn't always wash over it says
[32:44] now that's love right like we don't
[32:47] always recognize it that way
[32:49] in Revelations chapter 2 verse 9
[32:51] this is the scripture that brother
[32:53] Branham is drawing from when he goes on
[32:56] a very lengthy writing in the smyrnian
[32:58] church age chapter for the church age
[32:59] book about God's love and perceiving
[33:01] God's love he's taken it from this
[33:03] phrase Revelations chapter 2 verse 9. I
[33:06] Know Thy Works in Tribulation and
[33:08] poverty but Thou Art Rich so we'll just
[33:11] look at this I Know Thy works and
[33:12] tribulation and poverty
[33:14] he's saying I know it
[33:17] I know what you're going through I know
[33:19] your tribulation I know you're poor and
[33:20] however you'd want to amplify that with
[33:23] all the different translations or
[33:24] commentaries God is acknowledging their
[33:27] pain their suffering what they're going
[33:30] through what they've lost what they
[33:31] stand to lose what they have not gained
[33:33] all their toil and everything that
[33:35] they're going through God is
[33:36] acknowledging it and brother Adam looks
[33:39] at it this way in chapter 4 the church
[33:40] age book now the Lord God Almighty says
[33:42] I know
[33:43] there he is walking in the midst of his
[33:45] people there he is the chief Shepherd of
[33:48] the flock but does he hold back the
[33:50] persecution
[33:51] does he stem the tribulation nope
[33:55] he does not
[33:56] right so this is this is the point of
[33:58] contention that here he is he's right
[34:01] there he's looking at everybody's
[34:03] suffering and he's got the power to stop
[34:05] it
[34:06] he's got the power maybe to draw back
[34:08] the hands of the persecutor he's got the
[34:09] power to keep them from feeling the pain
[34:11] he's got power to keep them from death
[34:12] but yet he doesn't do it he simply says
[34:15] I know your tribulation
[34:17] I'm not at all unmindful of your
[34:18] suffering
[34:20] in other words maybe it would be one
[34:21] thing if God just kind of had this
[34:23] filter where he couldn't see suffering
[34:26] and and to him he literally is just
[34:27] perceiving everything is just Rosy God
[34:29] has these Supernatural rose-colored
[34:31] glasses where whatever you're going
[34:32] through to him he's like that's awesome
[34:35] I'm so glad they're going through that
[34:37] but he's saying no I I that that is not
[34:40] good
[34:41] that is nasty I cannot believe you're
[34:43] having to go through that God's looking
[34:45] at it real he's like man that's horrible
[34:46] that's awful and brother I'm saying he's
[34:48] saying yeah I know I know you're
[34:50] suffering I know you're going through
[34:51] tribulation I know this is very painful
[34:53] this is very very deep no I know I'm not
[34:55] being deceived I'm not blinded I'm not
[34:57] somewhere where I can't see and he goes
[34:59] what a stumbling block this is to so
[35:00] many people
[35:02] the fact that God knows and he doesn't
[35:03] intervene so then he brings us to Israel
[35:06] like Israel they wonder if God really
[35:08] loves them how can God be just in loving
[35:10] if he stands by and watches his people
[35:12] suffer
[35:14] and this is the this is the uh the
[35:17] softest view this is the argument this
[35:19] is the philosophy this is the the one
[35:21] that reasons against God this is the one
[35:23] who says in his heart the fool who says
[35:25] there is no God he says if God says he's
[35:27] love but he does not intervene on his
[35:29] people's behalf in the face of genocide
[35:31] and the Holocaust and pain and the
[35:33] suffering of even the the martyrs
[35:34] throughout Christendom said that can't
[35:36] be God because if there was a god this
[35:38] bad things wouldn't be happening
[35:40] and this is where people get hung up
[35:42] this is where people struggle is he says
[35:44] I know your poverty I know your
[35:46] tribulation I know what you're going
[35:48] through but yet he does not stop it
[35:50] but let me say this this is the point
[35:52] that brother Branham is emphasizing
[35:53] perfect love is pure
[35:56] it can only Act
[35:58] or not act
[36:00] so either it's either he's overt overtly
[36:03] acting or he's refraining from acting to
[36:06] serve and fulfill God's purpose
[36:09] so God the love of God is pure so the
[36:12] love of God may see tribulation and I
[36:14] hope you're catching this may see
[36:16] suffering but it won't act
[36:19] because it has to allow things that work
[36:22] to the good has to allow things that
[36:25] work to God's perfect will so pure love
[36:27] will only act or it will not act unless
[36:31] it fulfills or serves to fulfill God's
[36:33] Divine Purpose
[36:36] now our human concepts of just our human
[36:38] concepts of equity or fairness or
[36:40] sensitivity or human concept of love
[36:42] those are impure
[36:45] those are not perfect things they're
[36:47] they're partial they're prideful so when
[36:50] we think of love we think well how can
[36:52] God love people if he doesn't intervene
[36:53] when they're suffering we're using our
[36:55] our human love
[36:57] and say well I mean if they're dying
[36:59] stop it if they're suffering why
[37:00] wouldn't you if you had the power to do
[37:02] it and so since we're not finite or
[37:05] since we're not infinite and we don't
[37:06] have infinite power we think if God is
[37:09] Supernatural and if a train was
[37:11] barreling down a train track and it's
[37:12] headed for 300 a car of three cars of
[37:14] 300 people on the train track and if the
[37:16] train keeps going that direction 300
[37:18] people are going to die but you can
[37:19] switch the tracks and the train can
[37:21] detour its course and kill three people
[37:23] on a track that's being repaired what
[37:24] would you do
[37:27] and it's this ethical question and and
[37:29] the human starts to wrestle well do you
[37:32] just allow fate to transpire that this
[37:34] is the path the car was supposed to go
[37:36] on so it's ethical to allow the train to
[37:38] continue down the path that would go
[37:39] down and kill the majority of people
[37:41] because it wouldn't be ethical to switch
[37:43] the track and actually choose to kill
[37:45] three people would it
[37:47] we need to take an Ethics Course
[37:50] right and so then they derive from that
[37:52] do that which is performs the greater
[37:54] good for the greater number of people
[37:55] right greater for Humanity and they
[37:57] wrestle with these questions well
[37:58] because that's what humans have to do
[38:00] right they're trying to come up with
[38:02] some sense of what is right but then we
[38:04] would say God why don't you just take
[38:06] that train and float it right your God
[38:09] why don't you just cause it to transport
[38:11] on the other side so we think well God
[38:13] met if God God is all-powerful and
[38:15] all-knowing then he could just move
[38:17] things around and cause a breach in the
[38:18] space-time Continuum and let it pass
[38:20] through some sort of portal on the other
[38:21] side because that's what we would do as
[38:23] humans right
[38:25] we could keep people from suffering and
[38:27] dying and never having any pains or
[38:28] aches we would just figure out a way to
[38:30] make that happen but that is an
[38:32] imperfect love
[38:34] I want to use the phrase but at the risk
[38:36] of maybe focusing too much on a hit from
[38:38] 1964 but it's Tainted Love
[38:41] is what it is it's something that's an
[38:43] impure love it's something that's not uh
[38:46] there's something that's missing messing
[38:48] with it we can even say well humans have
[38:49] the capacity to love and let's just say
[38:51] it stands on it's it's its own thing but
[38:54] it stays it has all these other
[38:56] roommates right in the spirit they're
[38:59] kind of saying well you know
[39:01] right and they influence it and love all
[39:04] of a sudden now has jealousy that kind
[39:05] of leans against it or hatred
[39:07] retribution right or memory reason
[39:09] affection all these things kind of leans
[39:10] against it it's like oh I think you
[39:13] should do this and so love can get
[39:14] weighed down where it's not just even if
[39:16] I can say it's not just maybe the feelio
[39:18] love but what anger
[39:20] acts remember talks about how that human
[39:23] love will murder somebody
[39:25] there's something even powerful about
[39:27] the human love where human love will lay
[39:28] down its own life a mother will do that
[39:30] for its child and so this is where the
[39:31] confusion comes in that love can be
[39:33] contained and just because we say it's
[39:35] love and it is love it may not be
[39:37] perfect love
[39:39] brother Branham says then this is the
[39:40] next part after he quotes from Malachi
[39:42] he says you see they could not figure
[39:44] out God's love what a stumbling block
[39:46] why does God if he loves him why does he
[39:48] let him suffer they could not figure out
[39:50] God's love they thought that love meant
[39:52] no suffering they thought that love
[39:53] meant to baby with parental care and
[39:55] some of you are saying oh my goodness I
[39:57] can repeat this back I can spell it
[39:59] backwards I hear it so often and I know
[40:02] maybe we hear it a lot and I've repeated
[40:04] it a lot and I trust that it's always
[40:06] coming from a good place if I'm
[40:07] repeating it
[40:08] but they thought that love meant no
[40:10] suffering they thought that love meant
[40:11] no meant a baby with parental care
[40:14] so we know that a a natural attribute
[40:17] and I'd even say a correct attribute of
[40:19] a parent would be that parental love
[40:22] will protect an innocent baby
[40:24] so when they say that they thought that
[40:26] love meant no suffering
[40:28] then they draw from this idea that a
[40:30] mother or a father would never let their
[40:33] baby suffer and endure pain or
[40:35] difficulty but we could say then but
[40:38] there has to be a better understanding
[40:39] of love because if you narrow that
[40:41] that's God's love it's kind of that
[40:42] doting love or that that love of a
[40:44] newborn parental love will protect an
[40:47] innocent baby but it may also enable a
[40:49] stubborn adolescent
[40:52] hope you caught that
[40:56] just parental love I'm not talking about
[40:58] perfect love but parental love may be so
[41:01] careful for their child that they don't
[41:03] want them to suffer they don't want them
[41:05] to be bullied they don't want to go
[41:06] through this I don't want them to feel
[41:07] pain and that's coming from a good place
[41:08] but that same kind of love later on in
[41:11] adolescence
[41:13] can actually enable
[41:15] right back the wrong kind of character
[41:18] in their child
[41:19] and it's all because parental love
[41:22] I don't want them to have to go through
[41:23] that I went through that as a child and
[41:24] I was raised in a really strict message
[41:26] home and I had it shoved down my throat
[41:28] and it was all a bunch of legalism and I
[41:30] don't want my child to grow up that way
[41:31] and they do it because they have some
[41:33] sort of compassion and synth feeling for
[41:36] the child and they don't want them to
[41:37] live through what they live through but
[41:38] yet it can be that very concept of love
[41:40] that thinks it's looking out for the
[41:42] child's character that actually is doing
[41:44] more harm and damage or just as much
[41:50] phrase if you if you love me then you
[41:53] would right
[41:55] and when we say that or if you love them
[41:58] you would or if you loved me you would
[42:00] it implies some sort of preconceived
[42:01] idea of what love should feel like when
[42:03] we when we receive it or what it should
[42:05] look like when we give it
[42:08] but God's love
[42:10] in this example that brother Brandon's
[42:12] using both in Revelations 2 9 and then
[42:14] even with the Jews it was being
[42:16] manifested in a way that was opposite of
[42:17] the human Notions of love
[42:20] but perfect love always protects God's
[42:23] purpose
[42:25] perfect level always protect God perfect
[42:27] parental love may try to protect the
[42:29] person
[42:31] parental love may try to protect the
[42:32] parent or the person but God's perfect
[42:35] love will always protect God's purpose
[42:38] it may offend it may hurt but it never
[42:41] will offend or hurt God's will
[42:43] notice in First Corinthians chapter 10
[42:45] verse 13 there hath no temptation taken
[42:47] you but such as common to man but God is
[42:50] faithful
[42:53] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[42:54] above that year Abel
[42:57] but will also with the Temptation excuse
[42:59] me but will with the Temptation also
[43:01] make a way of to escape that you may be
[43:03] able to bear it
[43:05] if we kind of rephrased it in other
[43:07] words it's saying God is faithful who
[43:10] will suffer you to be tempted
[43:12] right
[43:13] it's it's implied explicitly in the text
[43:17] God is faithful he will allow you to be
[43:19] tempted
[43:20] but the second part is he'll allow you
[43:22] to be tempted but he won't suffer you to
[43:25] be tempted above that you're able
[43:27] so perfect love allows temptation
[43:30] we now this is when it starts getting
[43:32] real
[43:33] God in his perfect love will allow
[43:36] temptation
[43:37] but he will not allow it above that
[43:39] which you're able
[43:41] but he will equip and give you the tools
[43:44] and the resources you need to escape
[43:45] whatever Temptation he allows
[43:48] so God perfect love allows Temptation
[43:50] perfect love allows tribulation it
[43:51] allows suffering
[43:53] but it's not always so with parental
[43:55] love
[43:57] parental love can be tainted
[44:00] parental Love Can it can be in a way Act
[44:05] can it acts on a waitress says well I
[44:07] don't want them to suffer
[44:10] perfect love will allow you to be
[44:12] tempted parental love which is Tainted
[44:15] or or it's it's not it's not in harmony
[44:17] uh with God's perfect will it can act in
[44:21] a way says I don't want them to be
[44:22] tempted
[44:24] but God says I'll allow him to be
[44:26] tempted
[44:27] so what we do is we just don't ever want
[44:28] them to be tempted and we do it through
[44:30] legalism and controls but we're never
[44:32] actually equipping our children to deal
[44:34] with temptation we're just keeping them
[44:36] from it completely
[44:39] so that whenever they are tempted
[44:40] they're like wow
[44:43] oh my goodness I didn't even know this
[44:45] existed
[44:46] this is an arcade of fun
[44:49] right because you did so good at keeping
[44:52] them from anything
[44:53] that you haven't quipped them to say oh
[44:55] nope
[44:57] I gotta get out of here
[45:05] so this parental love
[45:08] in that God will allow you to suffer
[45:10] will allow excuse me perfect love allow
[45:13] you to suffer like to go tribulation but
[45:15] it has its limits right it's not gonna
[45:17] let you go too far
[45:18] it's going to equip it's going to teach
[45:20] it's going to it's going to help you
[45:22] but the parental love can be tainted but
[45:24] let me say this not in some sort of
[45:26] overtly evil way
[45:29] because we'd say somebody who says they
[45:30] love their kid and they're just going to
[45:31] punch him in the face and say no you
[45:32] can't even confuse that as love
[45:34] right and so there's certain things that
[45:37] can be pure aggression pure abuse
[45:40] but then even in the more subtle ways is
[45:42] what I'm talking about that we think oh
[45:44] this is I I'm just gonna I just want to
[45:46] love them and I just want to protect
[45:47] them I just want to Shield them
[45:49] now this might come come at you from a
[45:51] little bit of a different angle but
[45:52] first John chapter 3 verse 20.
[45:54] for if our heart condemn us God is
[45:57] greater than our heart and knoweth all
[45:58] things
[46:00] yeah
[46:01] this stands for the principle that God's
[46:03] love is greater than our human love
[46:06] and as I was studying it this week it
[46:09] just
[46:10] became so
[46:12] powerful to me in light of these things
[46:13] that I'm sharing with you this evening
[46:16] that our human love says if our heart
[46:18] condemn us God is greater than our heart
[46:20] God who is love
[46:21] if our hearts condemn us love is greater
[46:24] perfect love is greater than our hearts
[46:26] and perfect love knows all things but we
[46:28] don't
[46:30] so and what did the way I came to me and
[46:32] struck me is that there's almost this
[46:34] competition between the human love and
[46:36] God's love
[46:37] that our hearts condemn us but God is
[46:39] greater than our hearts so that our it's
[46:41] our human love judging God's perfect
[46:43] love
[46:44] it's this human The Condemned heart is
[46:47] this battle between perfect love and
[46:49] human love
[46:50] perfect love and parental love
[46:52] that maybe I've got this notion I've got
[46:54] this idea I've got this concept but then
[46:56] we have this sense so God help me to
[46:58] express this I have the sense of the
[47:00] Divine I have perfect love in my soul I
[47:03] have that welling up within me this is
[47:05] what this is what I need to say this is
[47:07] what I need to do this is what's right
[47:09] perfect love starts to operate but then
[47:11] the heart goes oh oh no you can't do
[47:13] that
[47:15] and it's your heart that is condemning
[47:17] condemning God's perfect will condemning
[47:19] your unction condemning your inspiration
[47:21] and so there's this wrestle between what
[47:23] perfect love is and what your heart
[47:25] thinks perfect love is
[47:27] perfect love will act or not act in your
[47:31] best interest
[47:33] perfect level always act in the best
[47:35] interest of the one who's receiving the
[47:37] love perfect love is it's being
[47:39] projected is always acting in the best
[47:41] interest of the one who is being loved
[47:43] when the Bible says that Jesus saw the
[47:45] Rich Young Ruler he projected love to
[47:47] him as he projected love to him he told
[47:49] him what he needed to hear
[47:51] told him maybe what hurt and it was the
[47:53] very thing that caused him to walk away
[47:55] and we might all be like oh no no no no
[47:57] no no no no no you should have just said
[48:00] hey buddy come along let's do this and
[48:02] it's going to be okay and kind of work
[48:04] with them a little bit because I mean
[48:06] this guy's Rich if he just starts paying
[48:07] his ties gets a little bit of offerings
[48:09] we can knock down another wall we can
[48:11] add the mezzanine we're looking at right
[48:13] there's a lot of ways we start thinking
[48:14] you know walk softly right let's figure
[48:16] this out but Jesus knew what he needed
[48:18] that was love
[48:20] that there was no selfishness in it
[48:22] there was no impurity in it he he was
[48:24] spoken in such a way where this is what
[48:26] he needed to hear so pure love perfect
[48:28] love when it's projected
[48:30] it is always in the interest of a
[48:32] person's salvation there's always in the
[48:33] interest of their perfection and their
[48:35] Glory that that's the way that it works
[48:37] perfect love can never manifest and then
[48:39] tend to someone's corruption
[48:43] now one can reject the manifestation and
[48:45] that's what where the corruption is
[48:47] so it says if our heart condemn us God
[48:49] is greater than our heart and then Noah
[48:51] says there's knoweth all things this
[48:52] might be my my huge turn here
[48:55] our hearts condemn Us in other words our
[48:57] hearts judge God's love it judge's
[48:59] perfect love it's at odds with it they
[49:01] couldn't figure out God's love they
[49:02] thought it meant always meant like a A
[49:04] Parent's Love for a baby but you know
[49:06] what as that baby grows the expression
[49:08] of Love Changes
[49:10] right because you realize that what this
[49:12] child needs is it it needs it needs
[49:14] discipline it needs correction it needs
[49:16] to grow he says for our heart if our
[49:17] hearts condemn us and we wrestle with
[49:19] God's perfect love perfect love is
[49:21] greater than our love and he says and
[49:23] this love knows all things
[49:25] this is the way I want you to look at it
[49:27] tonight I'm not putting a period on and
[49:28] I'm not trying to change the meaning of
[49:29] the scripture but since he knows all
[49:31] things he sees the big picture he not
[49:34] only knows perfectly what has been and
[49:36] we don't
[49:38] there's so many times in our
[49:39] interactions with one another that we
[49:41] see something happen in a certain way
[49:43] but from the other person's vantage
[49:44] point it's the complete opposite
[49:46] and so what we see and what they see is
[49:48] completely different so their reaction
[49:50] completely befuddles us
[49:52] why do you do that why did he act that
[49:54] way why did he respond that way because
[49:56] we see it one way but to them they
[49:58] completely see it another and so we have
[50:00] a hard time trying to figure out why the
[50:02] person's acting this way why they're
[50:03] responding that way why they're going
[50:04] through that way we feel really
[50:06] justified in how we feel and how we
[50:07] think we got a beat of the situation the
[50:09] other person is looking at the same way
[50:11] I don't can't believe they would do that
[50:12] why would they say that to me and they
[50:13] see it completely different but God
[50:15] knows all things
[50:16] he sees it exactly for what it was
[50:19] and because he knows all things he
[50:20] looked beyond the moment
[50:22] he knows the past perfectly that got him
[50:24] there we don't and he sees beyond the
[50:26] moment and knows where it's taken them
[50:29] and so he can see the true need in that
[50:31] moment so in perfect love acts he this
[50:34] is this is how love looks and that's why
[50:35] I phrased it that way how does love look
[50:38] well not only what does it look like but
[50:40] how does it see things
[50:41] how does love look how does it look to
[50:44] me but how does it see how does it view
[50:46] things and this is how God looks it
[50:48] knows more than what our human heart
[50:50] knows and so we just judge and we
[50:51] condemn and we even condemn ourselves
[50:53] God says I'm looking at the bigger
[50:54] picture here buddy
[50:55] you may think that love dictates this to
[50:58] happen in this moment but I know what
[51:00] has been to get us here
[51:01] and I know what will be
[51:03] and I know where where you need to be so
[51:06] I know what you need right now to get
[51:07] you where you want to be
[51:09] listen to this in the sermon why Christ
[51:11] speak welcome to the after hour
[51:13] it says many times when we look at the
[51:15] scriptures in our own way of looking it
[51:17] seems very hard
[51:19] can we say Amen to that
[51:21] we can look at scriptures of your heart
[51:22] we can look at our life and our
[51:23] decisions and the things we go through
[51:24] it can be very hard but now he's saying
[51:26] we look at scriptures in our own way of
[51:27] thinking it seems very hard but if we
[51:29] studied a little while we find out that
[51:32] the all-wise God knows just what he's
[51:34] doing
[51:39] let that if those of you who are jotting
[51:41] this down I hope you get the wording
[51:42] just right so you can look this up we
[51:44] find out that the all-wise God knows
[51:46] just what he's doing and he knows how to
[51:48] do these things and how to deal with man
[51:52] he knows what's in man
[51:56] he knows him we don't
[51:59] we only know from the intellectual side
[52:01] he knows what's really in the man
[52:06] now the sermon title why Christ speak
[52:09] and in this summer there was a lot of
[52:11] tough love towards Moses but brother
[52:13] Brown gives us this great key to say
[52:15] this isn't the template for how you deal
[52:17] with everybody
[52:19] it says God knows we find out the
[52:22] all-wise God knows just exactly what
[52:24] he's doing could I say this to us who
[52:25] are parents we realize that even within
[52:27] our own family that the more kids we
[52:29] have that we realize that one thing
[52:31] works for one but it may not work for
[52:32] the other and what can be super
[52:34] effective for one child can be actually
[52:36] super ineffective or destructive for
[52:38] another
[52:40] and you would leave that up to the
[52:42] parent to know
[52:43] and you'd hope that that's something
[52:44] they're invested in and they're
[52:46] conscious of
[52:47] so he says he knows
[52:49] the all-wise God knows what he's doing
[52:51] and I want you to think this is perfect
[52:53] love perfect knows perfect love knows
[52:55] what it's doing
[52:57] he knows perfect love knows how to do
[52:59] things and how to deal with man perfect
[53:01] love knows what's in man
[53:04] perfect love knows him we don't human
[53:06] love doesn't we only know from the
[53:09] intellectual side perfect love knows
[53:11] what's really in the man
[53:14] so no it that's the that's where it says
[53:16] God is greater than our heart and knows
[53:17] all things
[53:19] that it it can see things from a
[53:21] different perspective
[53:22] so look at Revelations 2 9 again I Know
[53:24] Thy Works in Tribulation and poverty he
[53:27] knows all that
[53:28] I know how you're struggling I know
[53:30] you're poor I know you're going through
[53:32] tribulation I know you're suffering but
[53:35] Thou Art rich
[53:37] and I feel it's put in there in such a
[53:40] way to say I know your works I know your
[53:42] tribulation I know your poverty and even
[53:44] though you may not see it I do you're
[53:46] actually rich it's the exact opposite of
[53:49] what he had to say about laodicea you
[53:50] think you're rich increase with good
[53:51] head needed nothing but you're actually
[53:52] the opposite you know it's perfect love
[53:54] knows when somebody's destitute
[53:57] and they may think they've got it all
[53:58] but perfectly says no they don't have
[54:00] what they need but then in the opposite
[54:01] someone may feel they have nothing at
[54:03] all but he says but I know you're rich
[54:04] if I can say this perfect love knew
[54:07] something they didn't
[54:09] they only saw suffering we only see
[54:10] suffering they only saw poverty or
[54:12] experience poverty but he saw the real
[54:14] value of what they did have
[54:16] they had Works they had Faith they had
[54:19] these other things that they knew the
[54:20] blasphemy within this say they were Jews
[54:21] and God looked and says if you have that
[54:23] you're rich
[54:25] and we fixate on other things well if
[54:27] God really loved me I'd have no Cloudy
[54:28] Skies if God really loved me I'd have
[54:30] this if God really he's looking he says
[54:31] no we'll think about what you have
[54:34] what you're rich in he saw what they
[54:37] didn't see and this is what perfect love
[54:39] sees
[54:40] this is how perfect love looks
[54:43] this is what perfect love looks like
[54:46] then in the midst of their tribulation
[54:47] and their suffering and their poverty
[54:48] and everything they were going through
[54:49] he says but you're rich
[54:54] the man said you see they could not
[54:55] figure out God's love
[54:57] they thought that love meant no
[54:58] suffering
[55:00] they thought that love meant to baby
[55:01] with parental care but this is his
[55:03] response to that but God said that his
[55:05] love was elective love
[55:08] in other words it's deliberate
[55:10] it's intentional I know that elective
[55:12] love and especially in the way that
[55:14] brother Branham emphasizes initially is
[55:16] like well God chooses us
[55:18] but if in light of the choosing where
[55:20] God is making this is where so many
[55:21] scriptures start coming into view God is
[55:23] making all things work together
[55:24] according to his perfect will
[55:27] according to that that which he purposed
[55:29] in himself in the beginning so instead
[55:31] of just looking at his gun saying well I
[55:33] chose you
[55:34] I chose you and I chose you and that's
[55:36] God's love but God's love is elective
[55:39] love and that God has something he's
[55:41] wanting to accomplish
[55:43] it's very it's very deter the
[55:45] determinate is wisdom is deliberate it
[55:48] is intentional so his love isn't well I
[55:50] just chose you and whatever happens to
[55:51] you at least I love you right
[55:53] right can't you all just be happy with
[55:55] God's love and like okay I guess I'll be
[55:57] happy with God's love but it's more than
[55:59] just knowing that he loves us but it's
[56:01] trusting the love that he has to us
[56:03] realizing that his love is elective in
[56:05] other words it's deliberate and it's
[56:06] intentional
[56:08] that God has a purpose in it
[56:11] and if I could say this that God our
[56:13] character our happiness our pure joy
[56:16] our well-being our meant to well-being
[56:18] our physical health all those things are
[56:20] the totality of our person God will
[56:22] perfect that which concerneth me our
[56:25] character is at the heart of God's love
[56:27] when we preach character development and
[56:30] the judgment and rewards series part
[56:31] seven these these all those themes could
[56:33] just be considered in here to where that
[56:35] suffering perfects our character
[56:38] and it may be the Instinct of human love
[56:40] to shelter
[56:41] to protect
[56:42] that could somehow if I could somehow
[56:45] construct a home
[56:47] and and construct a life and put all the
[56:50] safeguards in to where they they never
[56:52] know one they never know one Temptation
[56:54] they never know one difficulty they
[56:56] don't know any suffering at all I'm just
[56:58] going to make everything work for him
[56:59] and I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do it
[57:00] and I'm just going to try to figure out
[57:01] a way that's what level it'll provide
[57:02] and level do this and level do that and
[57:04] we start pursuing that then we're
[57:06] actually acting in a way
[57:09] that is not perfect love because perfect
[57:11] love simply put keeps God's will
[57:16] his love may allow us to suffer
[57:19] his love may allow us to endure
[57:20] tribulation his level allow us to
[57:22] experience loss
[57:24] but it's always intentional
[57:27] it's always deliberate
[57:29] God will only allow it to serve his
[57:31] purpose
[57:32] God will only allow it to the extent
[57:34] that it perfects our character God will
[57:36] only allow it because he knows that
[57:37] it'll produce the true joy that he
[57:39] desires for us
[57:41] whereas we want the synthetic Joy right
[57:44] we want to we want to we want things to
[57:46] kind of be contrived and figured out and
[57:48] and manipulate and and produce the
[57:50] Perfect Image but God says I know you're
[57:52] only going to have peace one way
[57:55] and I know that it has to come with the
[57:57] price
[57:58] and if we take the if we take the
[58:00] Tainted Love and we take the approach
[58:01] The Human Side of Things We actually Rob
[58:04] ourselves of the glory that God has for
[58:05] us
[58:06] is it making sense
[58:09] I I think that maybe we could have
[58:11] emphasized this a little bit different
[58:12] way tonight but I trust we'll have more
[58:13] opportunities
[58:16] when C.S Lewis wrote actually I think it
[58:18] was post published after his death it
[58:21] was actually done
[58:22] in a pseudonym a different name I can't
[58:24] remember why they actually did this but
[58:26] anybody familiar with a grief observed
[58:28] and C.S Lewis wrote it at the loss of
[58:30] his wife
[58:31] and he makes this statement to me this
[58:33] statement is so up moving
[58:36] because as he suffered this great loss
[58:38] and as he's observing grief and what it
[58:39] does to a person and if I could back up
[58:42] and just maybe look at it in general
[58:43] that we might say well I never want my I
[58:45] never want love would never let someone
[58:47] cry never let them experience loss it's
[58:48] just going to shelter and coddle and
[58:50] nurture and so we have this idea of that
[58:51] perfect love now hopefully this is
[58:54] helping you in the vertical and the
[58:55] horizontal that we we sometimes
[58:57] misunderstand God's love because brother
[58:59] Branham says it explicitly in the
[59:01] smyrnian church age I'm summarizing a
[59:02] lot in this he says we say oh well bad
[59:05] things are happening to me means God
[59:06] doesn't love me he said no Cloudy Skies
[59:08] don't mean God doesn't love you neither
[59:09] do you know clear skies mean that he
[59:11] loves you don't ever go by that
[59:14] is God's will for us is perfection and
[59:16] he left a measure of suffering for us
[59:17] that while suffering we'd be made
[59:19] perfect and he teaches us those things
[59:20] so we can understand this so whatever it
[59:22] is that God's love is allowing that God
[59:24] in his wisdom and in his love allows us
[59:26] to go through these trials that's God's
[59:28] love that lets it happen because if it
[59:30] wouldn't produce righteous fruit if it
[59:32] wouldn't be able to produce peace if it
[59:34] wouldn't be able to perfect your
[59:35] character God would stop it
[59:37] right
[59:39] because all things work together for the
[59:41] good I I guess this is maybe one way I
[59:43] could say the reason why that works is
[59:45] because God loves us and he'll never let
[59:47] anything happen that can't work for our
[59:49] good
[59:50] all right
[59:52] and so as God would intervene in that
[59:54] particular instance or we would expect
[59:56] him to not to suffer not to feel pain
[59:58] not to sorrow not to read all these
[1:00:00] different disconcerting emotions and
[1:00:02] pain and suffering that we feel human
[1:00:04] love might say oh no no no no no no
[1:00:05] let's save them from that
[1:00:08] C.S Lewis is looking at what he's gone
[1:00:09] through and the suffering and his
[1:00:10] perspective on it I think is very
[1:00:12] helpful he says God has not been trying
[1:00:15] an experiment on my faith or love in
[1:00:17] order to find out their true quality
[1:00:19] their quality
[1:00:22] in other words
[1:00:23] I I love you and I have faith and God's
[1:00:25] like well let's see about that
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:29] oh I love you with the perfect love I've
[1:00:31] got perfect faith and God says well let
[1:00:33] me test you first so I can figure this
[1:00:35] out
[1:00:36] and that's the way that we view tests
[1:00:37] right in our experience tests are only
[1:00:40] ever given and this is our natural
[1:00:42] experience only ever given so that the
[1:00:44] instructor knows where we're at
[1:00:45] right so when we think of a test right
[1:00:47] oh God's trying to find out how much
[1:00:49] he's taught me
[1:00:50] he knows how much you know hey he's not
[1:00:53] testing you so he can well they're not
[1:00:55] getting the material I need to kind of
[1:00:56] change this a little bit no the test is
[1:00:58] for you
[1:01:00] the test is so that I'm awakened and I'm
[1:01:02] made aware of where I'm at so that I
[1:01:05] recognize I know I love you but my
[1:01:07] love's falling short and I know I
[1:01:09] believe you but my faith is falling
[1:01:10] short this is the principle that C.S
[1:01:11] Lewis is expressing he's not trying an
[1:01:13] experiment in my faith in my love to
[1:01:15] find out what their quality is like oh
[1:01:17] well I'll show you you know we'll see
[1:01:18] whether or not you love me he says he
[1:01:19] knew it already
[1:01:21] it was I who didn't
[1:01:24] now this is coming from a safe place
[1:01:26] because this isn't God trying to expose
[1:01:27] you as a fraud this is God trying to
[1:01:29] unloose the perfect love instead of the
[1:01:31] human love because we can love God with
[1:01:33] the human love and be very Ardent right
[1:01:35] people can give their lives
[1:01:37] you know for Muhammad right they can
[1:01:39] give us a love a passion a Zeal for
[1:01:41] something and not be real he says in
[1:01:44] this trial he makes us occupy the dock
[1:01:46] the jury box the witness box and the
[1:01:49] bench the judge all at once
[1:01:51] in other words you're on trial and
[1:01:53] you're the judge you're the witness and
[1:01:54] you're the jury
[1:01:56] we're the only ones trying and being
[1:01:59] tried
[1:02:00] God's not being tried his words not
[1:02:02] being tried
[1:02:03] uh he's not trying us because well you
[1:02:06] said you believe me can I just dig
[1:02:08] around in your heart a little bit to
[1:02:09] find out if it's true
[1:02:10] he knows all things
[1:02:13] he knew it already I was the one that
[1:02:15] did in this trial this examination he
[1:02:17] says we occupy the doc the witness box
[1:02:19] the bench he always knew that my temple
[1:02:22] was a house of cards
[1:02:25] his only way of making me realize the
[1:02:27] fact was to knock it down
[1:02:29] what would do that
[1:02:31] only love would
[1:02:33] do you realize how sometimes we act with
[1:02:35] our children that when they get
[1:02:36] something wrong we don't tell them
[1:02:38] you say well what how what how much is
[1:02:40] this or what oh right that's good right
[1:02:43] we don't want them to fix we don't want
[1:02:45] them to be told they're wrong we don't
[1:02:46] want and I'm not saying it's wrong
[1:02:47] necessarily do it just I'm just
[1:02:48] referring to the Natural Instinct that
[1:02:50] we have sometimes to encourage
[1:02:53] to to to to help along and to make
[1:02:55] people feel good and try to make them
[1:02:57] feel great and we say oh well brother
[1:02:58] Brown said a great man is one who makes
[1:03:00] you feel great so we think well we just
[1:03:01] pump them up with a bunch of nonsense
[1:03:03] right
[1:03:05] but this is God this is true love
[1:03:07] God knew
[1:03:09] that you had something that was merely
[1:03:11] pretense
[1:03:12] God knows that you have something that
[1:03:14] in the gut check time you can't actually
[1:03:17] rely on it God knows that what that is
[1:03:19] isn't perfect it's not pure he knows
[1:03:21] that's tainted so he and his wisdom
[1:03:23] allows something to happen so that we
[1:03:24] realize oh no that was a house of cards
[1:03:28] it's love that makes us realize this is
[1:03:30] the love that I think is just so
[1:03:32] different and contrary to the human idea
[1:03:34] of love it was his only way of making me
[1:03:36] realize the fact was knocking down my
[1:03:38] house of cards and yes that may not feel
[1:03:40] good yes that may may be messy yes that
[1:03:43] may be hard but love is what allows that
[1:03:45] and I believe this is the lesson that we
[1:03:47] need to learn in receiving perfect love
[1:03:49] but also in showing perfect love
[1:03:53] because what perfect love is doing is
[1:03:54] removing all the tainting
[1:03:56] all the imperfections it's removing all
[1:03:59] the perversion from our human love
[1:04:01] how does love look
[1:04:04] in its expression then also in how it
[1:04:05] sees
[1:04:07] Brothers if you could come to your
[1:04:08] instruments we'll close with this
[1:04:09] statement
[1:04:11] from the message shalom
[1:04:20] he says sometimes they ask me
[1:04:22] why
[1:04:24] why must these things happen what why
[1:04:26] why did this happen to me
[1:04:28] why did I start and this happen
[1:04:33] and I had this trouble here and this
[1:04:35] upset me here and I lost this here all
[1:04:37] right good questions have some of us
[1:04:40] asked these before
[1:04:42] why did this happen
[1:04:43] why did I lose this why did I start here
[1:04:45] and not be able to finish there why did
[1:04:47] why does this happen and these questions
[1:04:50] are natural
[1:04:52] and these questions arise because what
[1:04:53] are what is what is someone trying to
[1:04:55] figure out what's the reason for this
[1:04:57] why did this happen so when we ask why
[1:05:01] it's because we lack a satisfactory
[1:05:03] answer as to the intent
[1:05:06] that if we say oh I know exactly where
[1:05:07] that happened because if that hadn't
[1:05:08] happened this wouldn't happen I see it
[1:05:10] perfectly right when we can figure that
[1:05:12] out we're satisfied and we don't ask the
[1:05:13] questions anymore
[1:05:15] and I don't think we should necessarily
[1:05:16] try to figure it out ourselves because
[1:05:17] that's human nature to try to come up
[1:05:19] with an answer to these questions what
[1:05:20] why and you may say well brother Adam
[1:05:22] said if you question God you can't
[1:05:23] believe God
[1:05:25] next statement in the very next
[1:05:27] statement sometimes I've asked why
[1:05:31] because it's a natural human response
[1:05:33] because perfect love knows all things in
[1:05:35] our imperfect love
[1:05:37] is left saying why
[1:05:40] why when I was a young Minister first
[1:05:42] started out did God take my wife right
[1:05:43] out from under me take my baby right
[1:05:46] from beneath me right beneath my heart
[1:05:48] why did he do that
[1:05:51] I didn't know
[1:05:53] I do now
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:05:56] but perfect love knew and I know that's
[1:05:59] that's that's maybe just honing in on a
[1:06:01] particular area that we should just
[1:06:02] probably just say you know what we don't
[1:06:04] know let's just leave it alone
[1:06:06] but even though we don't know doesn't
[1:06:08] mean God didn't God knew exactly what he
[1:06:10] was doing God knows how to orchestrate
[1:06:12] things in our lives because he knows
[1:06:14] what's best for us
[1:06:16] he's not just after making you feel good
[1:06:18] he's after perfect character
[1:06:20] he's not just out for making your life
[1:06:22] easy and fine and everything seemed neat
[1:06:24] and Rosy God's after he's looking at the
[1:06:27] end and he knows what he has to put you
[1:06:28] through in order to get you where you
[1:06:30] need to be to be perfect to be satisfied
[1:06:33] to be trusting
[1:06:34] why why did he do that I didn't know I
[1:06:37] do now
[1:06:39] I just held my hand in his and kept
[1:06:42] trusting
[1:06:42] he knows every Junction he knows the
[1:06:45] Rhythm must when it must take place he
[1:06:48] knows what it takes to mold you
[1:06:51] he knows what kind of material he's
[1:06:54] going to use
[1:06:55] oh this makes me become so much more
[1:06:57] sincere with my if I say filial love or
[1:07:00] with how I'm expressing love I want the
[1:07:02] love of God to be shed abroad in my
[1:07:04] heart but Lord I it needs to be
[1:07:05] according to knowledge it's got to be
[1:07:07] according to your perfect will it can't
[1:07:09] be according to my preconceived ideas of
[1:07:11] what I think is going to make things
[1:07:13] work
[1:07:14] and those perfect love sees what is
[1:07:16] actually needed
[1:07:18] it knows in that particular instance
[1:07:20] this is the right thing that's what
[1:07:23] makes perfect love so beautiful it never
[1:07:25] acts wrong
[1:07:27] even if when we see it we're like well
[1:07:28] that seems really really hard but if
[1:07:30] it's perfect love it's right
[1:07:32] even when we sit like well that seemed
[1:07:34] kind of lazy or lousy that seemed kind
[1:07:36] of soft-handed where where's the rebuke
[1:07:38] where where's the tough love brother
[1:07:40] Aaron should you should have really come
[1:07:42] down hard on it but let me just say if
[1:07:44] that is God's perfect love then it's
[1:07:46] right
[1:07:48] so what we ask ourselves is what is
[1:07:50] God's perfect will what is he trying to
[1:07:53] achieve and Lord let me never act in a
[1:07:55] way that undermines what you're trying
[1:07:57] to do
[1:07:58] brother Brown are many times if you just
[1:08:00] you kind of take this from the message
[1:08:02] there's this very clear principle oh oh
[1:08:05] I got a devil I'm sick heal me it's like
[1:08:08] well
[1:08:09] can we talk a little bit and figure out
[1:08:11] why
[1:08:13] because God could be using that for a
[1:08:15] reason
[1:08:16] there could be a reason that God allowed
[1:08:18] it why not to prove that that sin is
[1:08:20] wrong but to perfect something that's
[1:08:22] lacking inside of us to not leave us as
[1:08:25] we are we've built this beautiful house
[1:08:27] of cards God is nice God is just nice
[1:08:29] and he wants to say you've tried really
[1:08:31] hard making this house of cards and
[1:08:34] maybe he he wants he wants to make us
[1:08:36] feel good for all our efforts but he
[1:08:38] realized I'm not doing you a service
[1:08:41] by letting you live in a house of cards
[1:08:43] so he just lets the devil bump the table
[1:08:45] and everything falls apart
[1:08:48] and this is love that does that
[1:08:51] and he says he knows what it takes to
[1:08:53] mold you he knows what material he's
[1:08:55] going to use he says God knows what's in
[1:08:57] a man he knows him we don't he knows
[1:08:59] what's really in the man and he's taking
[1:09:00] it from why Christ speak we're here
[1:09:02] Moses came to a place and he's kind of
[1:09:04] groveling he's kind of whining and God
[1:09:06] took tough love
[1:09:08] I says I told you what to do I told you
[1:09:11] exactly what to do just do what I told
[1:09:13] you to do and brother answered God
[1:09:14] wanted to kick him while he was down he
[1:09:16] said oh my goodness how is that even
[1:09:19] right God knew what was in Moses he knew
[1:09:22] what Moses needed in the moment
[1:09:24] and then you come later to Elijah and
[1:09:26] here he is he's depressed he's he goes
[1:09:28] to hide and he's fleeing he comes he's
[1:09:30] running away says oh no he's wanting to
[1:09:31] run away and he's like oh no and he
[1:09:33] flees to a cave and he's driven there
[1:09:35] and he's all depressed and God says I
[1:09:37] know what he needs he needs a still
[1:09:39] small voice
[1:09:41] he needs an angel with the softest hands
[1:09:44] why you just kick Elijah while he was
[1:09:46] down
[1:09:47] perfect love knows what's in a man
[1:09:50] knows how to mold us
[1:09:53] perfect love is so easily misunderstood
[1:09:56] when it's taken out of context of God's
[1:09:57] perfect will
[1:09:58] when we take it out of the context of
[1:10:00] God's Eternal purpose that God love is
[1:10:02] always acting to promote God's perfect
[1:10:04] will perfect love is
[1:10:07] this is how love looks
[1:10:09] I want this kind of perfect love
[1:10:13] I want this kind of perfect love for my
[1:10:15] children
[1:10:16] I want this kind of perfect love for my
[1:10:17] neighbor I want this kind of perfect
[1:10:19] love for others to where I'm not trying
[1:10:21] to force an image of Love or a Look of
[1:10:24] Love that's pleasing and placable
[1:10:25] applicable to others and kind of makes
[1:10:28] everyone happy and it just kind of it's
[1:10:30] something that'll kind of help grow the
[1:10:31] church in a real Dynamic way that that's
[1:10:33] always going to fail
[1:10:35] even if it succeeded in ways that the
[1:10:37] world says great job your numbers are
[1:10:40] awesome
[1:10:41] you want to do it in a way that
[1:10:44] satisfies God's perfect will
[1:10:48] that kind of love won't withhold the
[1:10:50] good that is due to someone
[1:10:53] but it also won't avoid necessary pain
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:02] I think I could ask all the questions I
[1:11:04] did in the beginning because I don't
[1:11:05] believe that we've even answered what
[1:11:06] does it look like we just know
[1:11:08] better that it doesn't always look like
[1:11:10] we think it will
[1:11:11] could we stand together tonight
