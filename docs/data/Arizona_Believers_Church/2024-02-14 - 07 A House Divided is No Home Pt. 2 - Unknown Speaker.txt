TRANSCRIPT
========================================
continuing on the subject of the house of the Lord I want to I know there's a lot of things we've already talked about that we could rehearse that we could emphasize but we're looking at the a place where the Lord has preeminence we've even wanted to use it in the sense that we want to make our hearts his home that our goal isn't so much just to make it to heaven but that we could have Heaven here on Earth according to the word and the house of the Lord is a place not only where he dwells but it's a place where he is welcome a place where there's peace and justice and tonight we're going to do another part on A House Divided is no home and so hopefully we can just go over this very quickly and we could maybe ask the question this way what makes a house a home to where it's not just simply a dwelling you could have a place where you live uh a place where you keep your belongings a place that you return at the end of an evening I remember there was at one time we were traveling so much that we realized maybe our youngest didn't know what where home was and uh you stay in a hotel a few nights you go on to the next one and sometimes we had Extended Stays and I remember one time I can't remember if we were still on the road and traveling but Jack asked the question mom do you remember that white house and we thought maybe it was referring to the one in DC because we had toured that but after a little bit more imploring he goes no the one in Texas he said where I had my own bed and um and so this was I think this is before we had even moved so there's this sense of uh a place where you keep your belongings and you have your own bed but it's more than just a place where you keep your possessions we're talking about what makes a house a home and Jesus touches on a very remarkable characteristic of what I'm trying to point out in the house of the Lord and even our own individual lives as individuals Our Lives as family our lives as church family says in verse 25 and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand we looked in the word and we saw that house could refer to a residence it can refer to a temple a church a gathering a building where people gather it can also refer to the human body and it refers to a household or family so you can say the house of meiri and and it wouldn't just refer to a physical address that they own but you might just think of the whole family and you see that in the scripture where a house house kind of invokes a family or a household and we were taking we could even point back to the Gates of Heaven and how that the church and the the your house where you live and your body these are all uh Gates where God should be welcome points of interaction with the super natural even to where as Jacob viewed it you don't have to have heaven in your heart but others could come to a place where Heaven is and it's through those Gates or through those entrances or those contact points with the Supernatural and as we're looking at even this verse here that A house divided against itself cannot stand I'm hoping that you're making an effort uh to apply it to yourself that you're making it personal and that you look at it on a more than just one layer uh I know that maybe a phrase that we like to use some times maybe not myself but others that there's layers of complexity and there's different Vantage points and sometimes we're only looking at it through one slice only from one angle but to every in any way that you can make it practical and personal to you I invite you to let the Holy Spirit do that for you a house whether we talk about you as an individual your your family home or your the place that you dwell or the church if it be divided against itself that's separated into groups or factions but it's not just separation but it's separate into groups that are against each other divided against itself so it's one thing to cause a separation and somebody just say hey I'm leaving I'm out of here or I'm I'm I'm gone or whatever it might be and I hope you could kind of just conceptualize this it's one thing to be separated but it's one thing to be standing shoulder to- shoulder United together as one and then separate and not just separate but turn against each other so it's not just uh things separating uh and well we've just moved on but there's kind of this uh uh combativeness or this competitiveness where there's a separation against each other and any time a house is turned against itself inwardly that house cannot stand and there's a lot of Rich meaning to that word cannot stand it's unable to be established it cannot be placed it cannot grow brother Bram teaches us the word in in the right kind of ground will produce it'll grow and so you have to have the word in its season in the right place and if you're not if you're divided a home that's divided an individual that's divided cannot be spiritually placed cannot mature cannot grow there's a lot of things there that we hope that you can uh uh conceptualize and then there is uh and looking at this A House Divided is no home so we're kind of wanting to Define what home is a home requires certain characteristics and this is kind of where we're trying to do the quick review and then we're just going to jump right almost in our notes exactly where we were on Sunday where we begin to skip a little bit brother Bram said a house it's not the uh building that makes it what it is he says the characteristic of it I'm just going to go through this very quickly he says a home isn't the house you live in it's the order of the house that's what makes a home and another place again we've read these already the home is a order of the house you see the order that's in it order of the family so the it's the characteristic of it when he says what I mean by characteristic it's the order the order in the house is what makes it a home he repeats it again in another place and it's the order of the family so he's not just referring to how the furniture is arranged he's not just talking about kind of a schedule throughout the day he's talking about the family how's the family re arranged one to another and if you'll kind of welcome that thought in your mind and think oh how's the family arranged together I I I know there might be some instinct to think well you've got the the man of the house and it's his domain and it's his castle and everyone else is just there to make him happy that's not what brother Bam's talking about and and whatsoever he says it's the character on the inside that makes a home so there got to be the right kind of character and if I could say this kind of piggybacking on our knowledge of what it takes to receive character character is a victory not a gift so no home has the right kind of order and character by gift but by suffering by effort and by labor it's not just going to come naturally but it really comes supernaturally when we take the word of God we're willing to suffer because we're going to obey the Lord we're going to sacrifice and we're going to be proactive there's a lot of effort that goes into it and there may be some rough spots but what we're doing is we're building character within the home uh through that discipline and through that sensitivity to the things that make a house a home so we could summarize in many different places where brother B said it's the order that makes the house a home uh a family's known by its order you could say well that family's this way that family that way and I know maybe you've said it before and maybe you've interacted with somebody I think it's uh maybe we've noted it in the family that lives in the apartment next door that we know the the wife is the one that runs that family have you ever said that we know who wears the pants in that family or oh those kids control that family why because uh it's whatever the kids need the family just uh they do it and and they're willing to even sometimes comprom compromise the word of God and their excuse is the kids or their kids need this or their kids need that and so sometimes we have a we have a way of defining a family and it's it's instinctual and maybe it's just our perception the way we observe but it's true that a family is known by its order right and brother Brandon saying it so much I think this emphasis invites us to dive into what order is I want to say it's order it's order it's order uh we we want to it invites us to kind of look into what this order means and there's a couple ways that you could Define order and I think they still give the same uh uh image or expression order is the arrangement of people or things in relation to each other according to a particular sequence pattern or method so it's the disposition of people or things in relation to each other it's probably the most important part there uh it's in relation to other things an order has to have some sort of relationship the arrangement of people in relation to each other According to some pattern method or sequence so we may all have some order but what have we made our pattern what what have we used to order ourselves are we just merely looking at some sort of Optics or we looking at some something that serves a particular agenda and so the arrangement of people in relation to each other According to some method or pattern would be a really good way of looking at it some of the synonyms that might be used for this order is sequence Arrangement organization disposition structure a system series or secession these are things to think about that you could only almost plug into what brother bradam says where a home isn't the house you live in it's the arrangement of the house it's the disposition the structure the system the the the the the organization of the house these are the things that he's looking at and so when we say a house is divided we can make the comment uh that maybe that's anti to these synonyms A House Divided is a disorganized house uh I'm not talking about how clean clean it is yet a house can be uh defined by its cleanliness some of you may be like this I don't mind a hearty amen if this is true but some of you may not be able to get anything else done until you have a clean room or the floors picked up or the clothes have to be folded and I was that way especially in law school I I could be in the law school library trying to study and if I knew I had a messy room back home I couldn't study it was like the room had to be clean there had to be some order and I think a lot of people could relate to that so a house that's divided is a house that is out of sequence to some pattern it's disorganized According to some system of structure now we're uh we're Christians tonight we're message Believers so we know what this system would be we we have an idea of what how we'd want to be arranged we we we sing order my steps in your word so and there's been a there's a lot of good preaching that you hear quite frequently and I'm not just I'm I'm not referring to myself at all I'm thinking about the services that I enjoyed while I was gone that are giving us the this pattern in God's word to live by and there so it's a system of parts that are subject to some uniform uh Rank and proportion this is where this belongs and this uh is what it is in relation to this other part so it's a system of things working together uniformly in some sort of established uh uh position and some sort of established relationship or parameters and and when we speak of a sequence or we think of that kind of uh order we're not thinking top down we're just thinking more in relationship to each other and that's a very important part of order now there is a way that we could look at order as an authoritative command um direction or instruction so you give an order and that order is to be followed and in that sometimes we can create an order or sequence that has something that is we're we're looking at it more be more top down and I'm very I guess I kind of find myself being very deliberate how I describe this when we come to this place cuz we know that there's a head Christ is the head of all things things and the head of Christ is God and the head of the man is Christ and so we see that there's rankings and arrangements and with there there can be an order that's a command or direction or instruction so there can be an order that refers to a group of people or a body of persons that are living under some discipline the order of nuns or the the order of this or the order of that and and so there could be some way of looking at something as an order it's an arrangement it's a this it kind of comes from that meaning a position or an estate a rule or regulation is what we're looking at and this is when brother say it's the order of the house it's the order of the family what command do they follow what instructions are they Guided by what kind of discipline do they form and gather themselves around that makes it what it is and now in looking at the atmology of the word order as I was studying it uh quite a bit it comes from the the Latin as a row or line line and so if there's a row or line it starts to look as if a rank but it's more of a series or a pattern it's an arrangement this is the meaning of it's a routine now I'm kind of hearkening back to the very beginning of this series when we saw that the Tabernacle and the Wilderness and then later the temple had divisions but it's not a division but a union it's not divided in the sense that oh man the outer Court that's where you want to be cuz you can see the stars and uh uh oh no no the inner Court that's where you want to be because that's where you can do this and that no no no no the holy of holies like n only one guy can go there and you start ranking it and you start making it exclusive no it's it was all necessary it was not divided but there was distinctions because it had different roles different functions and different offices even in looking at the house of the Lord you found that the outer Court was necessary to be in the inner Court the inner Court was necessary to go to the holy of holies and you couldn't kick any one of them else out they kind of all worked together that's what God saw in the beginning that's that's how that he had arranged it and and as this relates to you as an individual or to your families or to the church ORD is necessary to function properly there has to be some sort of order Church order uh the church has given even government and structure as far as pastor and different offices and it's done so that there can be uh uh it can function properly we have a church order and we have an order of service and and that establishes expectations and that gives rise to roles and responsibilities and without there if there wasn't order that's where you get Strife you get contention you get chaos you have friction if there wasn't uh decision makers in in families if there wasn't decision makers in organizations if there wasn't uh uh something to go by or abide by that's what leads to infighting and that's what leads to friction and difficulty and I I want to Breeze past this hopefully very um uh in um I want it to be efficient but I want it to be sufficient as well in Romans chap 12:4 I want to look at this order says for for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office Paul's obviously teaching on a lot of things here in this particular passage and so he says we not we have many many members in one body now your body's that way your body has many members so there's this image of the human body then your family is that way a church is that way so the house the family the church even yourself uh he's using the human body these things operate the local church and even our families operate like the union of the human body and he says they don't all the members of one body don't have the same office in other words they don't have the same function they don't have the same work or undertaking they don't transact in the same same things they don't have the same abilities and and of course the I can say to the nose I see things better than you right did I say that right the eye can say to the nose I see better than you yeah I mean of course right and the nose could say well that wasn't hard to sniff out right because it's just it's obvious you have this ability I have that ability and everything works together and Paul goes to Great Links to say hey how can one part of the body say to the other and he kind of lifts up those uncomely parts to say man we all kind of work together because though we're different members and we have different functions these functions are all connected so what does he say in 1 Corinthians 12 he says as he describes it's much larger teaching he says that there be no Schism in the body so again he's looking at how the human body functions and its different parts and its organs and its uh it's vast systems and how they all interrelate and work together and what we see even in your movements that you witness with me right now it's the working together of many different parts right and and even still I I don't know I kind of drawn into this that even when it comes to artificial intelligence a a and Robotics what are they trying to produce that symmetry of movement in a human right even in patterns of speaking that they can now they can replicate the voice but yet there's just something about how an individual a live voice can articulate and can function to where they're getting better and better so don't get me wrong I'm just trying to make a point uh that it it still has something that's missing even the robots man with uh uh is it I can't remember Boston Electronics or whatever Boston robotics or whatever boy these dogs and everything they're creating can do a lot of stuff but you even notice in its movement there's something about it where if I guess if you put um you know a uniform on it like yeah that's a robot it can jump higher than me it can run faster than me but yet you could tell it's not as graceful as I am but these they all these functions in the human body are connected a and Paul says it this way when he's writing to the Ephesians in Ephesians 4:16 that's my birthday for whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint suppli I think this is just a huge mouthful from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part maketh increase of the body un the edifying itself in love and if I asked you what he was describing we would be tempted to say a paper clip because it is it is seems to be so complicated and so detailed and complex maybe better word to put it but yet he's talking about how the human body works together and Paul puts it in a language that maybe only he could have that the whole body is fitly joined together the word that he used there fitly joined together means to sew together it's been woven it's been sewn together in such a way towards one you look at a an individual garment you say oh well that's a suit or that's a shirt but all the individual fabrics and all the individual elements all kind of uh weaved together or sewn together to make something one and this word jointly fit together it is used it's applied to musical Harmony as we mentioned on Sunday several different instruments all playing different parts even sometimes reading in in uh they're reading from maybe individual Sheep music where sometimes and I you could recall this those of you who've played in these organized contexts that if you were to forget your music and you played the Trump oh man I forgot my music I'll just borrow it from the OBO player right you're looking at a different piece of music you can't just you can't just cheat off of somebody else so everyone has even something else that's been given to them and instructed them but the OBO wouldn't just say well just let me play I got this everything's working together so it's applied to musical Harmony every joint so or it's fitly joined together and I'm realizing here that maybe okay yeah that's right I I trimmed my notes up quite a bit I was like wait a minute what's happening I trimmed it up because there's diff beautiful meaning to compact in these different things but as it's it's uh fitly joined together and compacted I think that's important by by which every joint supplieth to the effectual working and every measure of every part maketh increase of the body and the edifying itself and love the the language speaks in this musical Harmony of the circulation of blood throughout the body and the nourishment of each part of the body to one another and as he says that the whole body and think about these different members the it's fitly joined together and compacted you think about the graceful movement of the foot could anybody imagine how graceful the foot moves I don't know if anyone here could imagine that but think about everything that works together the tendons the nerves the muscles and the bones and how they're all kind of sewn together and that's what allows the graceful movement do you want me to demonstrate the graceful movement of a foot brother Michael wow that's a vigorous knot up and down and how it moves gracefully right and you're and and there's something fluid to it and what does that how it's it's not just the foot in the sense oh that's just the foot but there's a joint there's bone structure there's muscle there's tendons there's cartilage there's all things that work together and all you need to do is just find that one thing's missing and one thing gets degraded or one thing gets impaired and all of a sudden a foot just do won't work anymore it doesn't function properly why because the function the graceful movement of that foot is relying upon a lot of things that make it what it is and then those joints those important uh places is he's using this fit joined together the joints become that point of Union from one piece to another and there at that joint there's a lot of pieces that go into that joint of cartilage and tendons and muscles and attachments and and that's how Paul's wanting us to think about the church our family and above all that the body of Christ so he says the body is fitly joined together and the Original Latin of the word order as it was used it was used as a row of threads in a loom so order is speaking to this weaving together it comes from the root or which means to arrange or the arrangement the source of it the or is to begin to weave to fit together to beautify to take one thing and weave it with another to produce something uh uh more beautiful or stronger the rows of thread and aloom as they they're woven together they fit together if anybody's if you want to just think a little bit about what we're I'm I'm considering here how I want us to think about it uh the brothers here if you to make this point just try to uh braid your daughter's hair or your wife's hair find out real quick that there's a way that things have to be done right there's a way of weaving it together it produces something beautiful and it's not just kind of twisting it and putting a rubber band on it and so the house must be woven together into a home just as God weaves together the the body of Christ just as God sews the body of Christ together in all parts fit together for the the supplementing and the nourishment of the whole and no one part is able to go H I'm more important than you that it's all sewn together to where it's one it's one the the the foot cannot say I'm not part of the human body and the head can't say well I am the human body it's like that's what makes it a body everything's been sewn together so when brother B's talking about order it's a mouthful brother talking about the order of the family it's not just being ble to establish some sort of rank where go in this family the the husband's the major general and everybody else is privates it's not a matter of just establishing it that way but it's an arrangement of the family members in relationship to each other so we've emphasized this a number of times especially when we're talking about uh the body of Christ and even the local church and how we work together it's not a hierarchy I think that when we talk about the head that establishes something maybe as H the head or the leader the guider The Protector the lifegiver and we recognize that Christ as our head and we recognize that in that spiritual sense but there's a way that we begin to take some of that language and we remove the life from it we Lo we lose the pattern of the scripture and it can definitely be something else that the scripture has not intended because we talk about the order of the family it's not just merely creating a top down structure or from the important to the least but it's how all the parts work together yes could you imagine just a man in his own home recognizing that he is not the head and he hasn't taken Authority he hasn't taken his place within the home because he's not uh he hasn't kind of stepped into that role as the protector and the provider and the head and he hasn't served in that capacity so he just wakes up one day and says this is my house I'm the head I got to take control so he just shows up says I'm the dictator I'm the boss everybody's going to do what I'm going to do and if you don't like it you got to get used to it and and just started ruling things that way and then he says hey I'm the head I've got to be the head and so just one by one everybody just said well see you later right and the the children leave one by one the wife leaves and finally he's like I did it Lord I did it I'm the master of this house I'm ruling it in all gravity and Authority I I finally found that place and position well you kind of that's not that wasn't the goal the goal wasn't you know just to produce HH um to produce you as the head at the expense of losing everything I know I've shared this before and I'll just repeat it I remember one time I was at lunch with my mom I at least went to lunch with her uh uh once a week if I could when I was in college and and I remember we went to lunch and we're sitting there eating and so I'm just a young man servant Lord probably early 20s or was was my early 20s she said yeah I've noticed Aon it's time for you to get married and of course I realized I'm glad somebody is recognizing these leadership abilities that I have in my and my w wisdom and and all I'm just thinking you know what I've been waiting for you to say this Mom right I mean this is an important moment for me and I'm like say on and she says it's time for you to find your own family to boss around Chips please right or check please who are you anyways I the reason why I remember it so well it's the last time I ever had lunch with my mom yet there's something about the fact that there's a way you can act where you're wanting to be the boss and there's other way where you just are that's what you are but it's not it's not acting as a dictator it's not acting as a boss and everyone else is a doormat underneath you and this is where I wanted to take over this presentation I I've referenced this a number of times you've heard the statement the low man on the totem pole and and in saying the low man on the totem pole we kind of mean the lowest rank the least important but if and and it's actually called the low man on the totem pole myth might well maybe that's just the way I describe describe it because it is somewhat of a myth as you study this are you able to see this okay uh it's somewhat of a myth uh because that's not how it's represented within this mythology or this religion or or within the Native American uh system is that the low man was worthless because what would happen if you took out the guy on the bottom it would topple this big great beautiful one on top and even what's unique about this one is this one here the lowest one on toble is kind of inval by the next level which holds up the next level and really the totem pole is what it is in total we call it a total pole no it is what it is totally working together the way it's arranged otherwise it would just be a statue but it's not to create a hierarchy where this this one is the greatest and this one's the least but they even kind of there's some conjecture but yet there's even some history on it that the smallest the one on the bottom rather not the smallest one about them sometimes was the biggest the grandest and considered the strongest because it's what supported everything else but in our language oh the high man on the totem pole the one that's on top and so we kind of get this idea this is the structure but if you were to take this idea in Native American culture you could even say that the real head is the one down here that's lifting up the rest of the family the husband's not saying wife you need to support me children you need to support me and that's what's created the order from the top down but maybe this is a good way of representing that there is an order but some sometimes the order is the strongest and the most able in the head is the one that's lifting and supporting everything else but but it establishes within this kind of nomenclature or mythology what we mean by an order where we're not just trying to create someone who's the dictator on top now does anybody remember what my my subject matter is A House Divided is no home so and we're talking about the order of the house so we're not just just trying to pay lip service to an order of husband wife children that's not going to work if it was just a matter of creating a relationship among those three elements then I mean you just get it naturally yeah but that's not what we're talking about anybody know what these are called am I missing something here did I go too far I may be missing a quote Oh well don't look yeah I am I'm going to come back to this brother bam says any man in his family a correct good Noble obedient family is one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere so in the moving apart That's A disruption of the order that we're talking about they should be one father with Mother Mother with father children with parent parent with children remember when brother bam said uh to the congregation submit yourself to the pastor Pastor submit yourself to the congregation Let's us all submit ourselves one to another if we are to submit ourselves one to another but one and how how do we submit ourselves one to another if there's always has to be one who's the greatest in that in that there there has to be someone on the top of the to totem pole that doesn't work so it has to mean something else he says all in agreement and when you see that you'll see the one lovely picture when you see the right kind of arrangement in order then you'll see that lovely picture that's God's purpose now brother John if you could go back to that first uh uh picture of the stairs there maybe I've given it away does anybody know what this is please somebody anybody pin row stairs there you go you knew it right knew it as we're talking about different parts arranged together when you look at this which one's up and which one's down which and it's this illusion in the sense to create this idea of and I think it's another way way it's called The Impossible stairs but when you look at it which is higher which is lower yeah and and this is the impossible triangle uh that they call it to where it's hard to tell which is which when looking at it and the way that it can be arranged where uh is one going up one's going down is one the lowest is one the highest and this is the way I'm want you to picture how we're arranged together in some ways maybe one is important in this area and another one's really important in this area unless we try to create just a top down we have to realize that maybe there's a way it works when sometimes it runs up sometimes it runs down sometimes this is needed sometimes that's needed and so just so you could demonstrate it to where you realize wow what is happening you think does it is it keeping is it still is it still going downstairs if it's still going downstairs how does it end up going back down to where it was before and so should we just read this quote again this is where I'm wanting you to think about this how things are arranged together and I'll put it this way there is a head and there is headship but it's the head because and it's the head and as the head it has a greater service not that it served greater let me ask you this do you serve Christ do you serve God do you serve him greater than he does you some might call that a nasty lawyer's trick but it's true think of it he that is greatest May became a servant that's that's what it means if in other words if you are the greatest in the Kingdom if you're the greatest in the house if you're the head is the terminology I want to use then you have the greater service and that's what makes you the greatest that what's why is it the head it's the lifegiver it's the protector it's the it's the thoughts it's the Warner without that you cut off the head anything else is just knee-jerk muscle movements for a short period of time before everything goes away so it's wanting to change the idea that the body exists to serve the head the head exists to serve and give the body its complete unity and function and so in some ways yes I'm challenging the men in their own individual lives the men and their families and even us men in this church that as the heads of families that we hold the greater responsibility to serve not be served brother Brandman doing God a service without it being being its will he talks about the order of the anointing and and how I could maybe draw from that it to emphasize this is It's think in terms of value think in terms of what is ultimately valued is it just power that's valued than a dictatorship a top down works if it's pretense if it's Pride I I if it's just popularity if it's position any other PW you want to throw in there if that's what it is then you can achieve that carnally yeah but miss the order of the anointing what's it what what's the ultimate what what do we what do we ultimate ultimately value now in Mark chapter 3: 27 I mean I really don't want to have to skip again but yeah here we are Mark chapter 3: 27 no man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his Goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house I know that I've made my title and even my emphasis has revolved a lot around verse 25 A house divided against itself cannot stand but I think it's this verse that forms a a greater key and is a greater point of emphasis for me in looking at the house of the Lord and even this our homes and turning houses into homes this right here is a is the the key because this is his teaching Point built upon his Parables and no man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his Goods Christ did not cast out Devils by being a part of the house and being be elub kicking something out but he entered into the house bound the strong men of the house that gave it house its identity and kind of made it of effective and you uh useful and Satan's kingdom and he bound him and then he was able to cast out the demons so bying ing the strong man is how you divide the house this is by binding the strong men Jesus was able to kick these demons out if you can bind the St the strong men then you allowed to be defiled and allowed to be destroyed so this is this is kind of it's just another layer to this because A house divided against itself cannot stand so divided House Is Not a Home how do we make a house a home through this order through Arrangement disrupt the correct order wrong sequence wrong organization wrong pattern then that's what divides the house that's what allows it to be spoiled there are if you heard the phrase united we stand divided we fall it's origin comes from asap's fables the one on that united we stand divided we fall I think is most often tracked back to the Fable of the four oxen and the lion and the way that the story is told is that a lion would prowl about in a field where there was four oxen and and whenever he came to attack them they would turn their tails into each other so they were facing outward so whichever way that he approached him he was met with the horns of The Oxen and as the story goes through the passage of time they kind of began to fight among themselves and each went off to eat on their own and then the lion attacked them one by one and made an end to all four and the statement is United to stand divided we fall it's also alluded to in the the Fable of the bundle of sticks and how a father had a family that was always fighting and he tried many times to get them to reconcile by saying we shouldn't fight we should be in this together and and he thought well I I need to demonstrate something to them so that they could understand what I mean by we shouldn't always be fighting and so he took his sons and he told them to lay some sticks before him and so they took these sticks and laid them out there and he he had each one of them uh he had them tie them into a bundle and he told them one by one take these bundle of sticks and you break them and as they took up the bundle of sticks and tried to break them one by one they were unable to break the bundle of sticks that tied together they couldn't they couldn't uh snap them so then he untied it these sticks were bound together now he unti them and then he says break them and they're able to take them and break them one by one and they did it very easily and the father said thus my sons as long as you remain aned are a match for all your enemies but differ and separate you are undone United together arranged correctly there's a strength there there there's a power there's a beauty there's a symmetry there's an upholding there's a supporting that comes when we're arranged together prop properly and you can be United against all your enemies you can find the power you need in the moment you know it you can find the protection you need in the moment you know but if you begin to differ and separate and you're always quarreling then you're undone united we stand divided we fall United together uh remaining together it's as that bundle of sticks another Fable that would could be included in this is about the lion and the Bulls now all these different lions and Bulls and we're mixing football and basketball here it gets kind of confusing but there's three bulls that were in the in the field together and they were they had great peace amongst themselves and there was always a lion that kind of was watching and waiting wanting to eat them and he he found that there were he never had an opportunity uh to attack them as long as they stayed together these three Bulls is a three-fold cord is not uh quickly broken there was just something about the three together where it was imposing to the lion and so the lion began to seow Discord he began to secretly spread evil and slanderous reports of the one against another until he had form intoed jealousy and distrust amongst the three no sooner did the Lions see that they avoided each other and fed by themselves then he fell upon them individually and made easy prey of them and this to me is outstanding the quarrel of friends are the opportunities of foes right amen how did Satan get advantage and how did this work in and how did this happen just get a quarrel among friends get a quarrel in the family I had this statement and maybe I should have out brought it but he says you just get one member of the family worked up and everyone else gets worked up there's a way that he begins to try to quarrel within the family a quarrel among the parents is a quarrel among the children and then it becomes an opportunity of the foes becomes an opportunity for Satan I hope you can see really what's being intended not just by referring to Illusions and and fables and these things to realize that when Jesus says binding the strong man which I think it's such beautiful language in light of A house divided against itself takes something that was together and separates it right and then he uses a language to say bind the strong man yes it it it almost seems to be a paradox because it was a family bound together but you got to find something else to bring it to and so it's the unraveling of the strength of the family is the Bowing down of the family to the wrong kind of order or Arrangement I'll come I'm drawing that from places in the scripture that's used by Jesus in different instances where to bind the strong man it's a bowing it's a subjection to the wrong kind of order in other words Jesus could say it this way Satan has his kingdom I entered in and brought it subject to a different order now if we're going to use this as an example for us and our own families it's when we have an order according to the word of God after a pattern of sequence or Arrangement there's a beauty as we've already read in here that this the family that's correct good Noble and obedient we're one we're all in agreement and it's in honoring God's word then all we have to do to bind the strong men of the house and all we have to do to see that our house is uh is spoiled is to divide that by bowing down to the wrong kind of sequence order p are patting ourselves after the world and not the word in judges 20:1 says so all the men of Israel were gathered against the city knit together as one man there's your order the sewing together the weaving together it's not enough that the whole Army shows up that day it's not enough that they all physically lined themselves up and the scripture wasn't just saying that well they all found their position on the battlefield you go here you go there you go here you go there they were knit together as one man they knew what part they'd played I think have some of you seen I think it's uh I can't even remember what you'd even call it but where you have it's just walking and and they just walk in these in the rhythmic way and it's synchronized to where one's walking this way one's walking this way and they don't touch each other at all and they start weaving in now anybody seen that can I get any hands you think I'm crazy you do you think I'm absolutely crazy and there's a way that they walk and the way that they work and they're all doing their part and they're blending together did you guys conspire to not nod at one point like when he asks his third question everybody just BL every at the same time but there's a this knitting together by of one man it wasn't just a visual representation that signifies some sort of symmetry but they're knit together as one man they would move like one body one thing wouldn't get a ahead of the the next and you know sometimes people are clumsy and they trip over their own feet or they just can't stay out of their own way this wasn't going to happen they were knit together as one man it was fluid it was strong and there was strength in that order there was strength in that arrangement in that sewing together and brother bam says we are identified with our families in this human life and he says by marriage which is a sewing together that's a uniting with their wives we marry our fames identified by the union of our marriage the union of our marriage I want to take that word and just use it as the arrangement the weaving together how how do the two parts relate to one another and in doing that how does it establish a family identity a a and the character to the family that the children then are woven into because a family that is divided against itself or is it saying A house divided against itself it's the upsetting of that Harmony it's the disruption of that Arrangement and the order and so when I used and I really touched on something by using the term contempt on Sunday and I'm not purposely doing it again uh to today at 15 past the hour to just be able to just say it and move on but it's to have contempt I was W you to recognize that's when order's been upset it there there's a wrong kind of order it's the upsetting of the order once the order is broken you're divided and that that and I think there's a lot more that we could share on that and we may continue in it in other places but The Binding of the strong man is bringing this the man of the head or from the whole thing subject to the a different subjection a different order that's what Christ did in the positive sense but in the this negative sense in our own house when the prior order sequence or patterns disrupted you've B you you bind the strong man and I want you to think personally I want you to think deeply about that because we cannot we ought not to allow ourselves to become subject to the world there's an order we must be following and then there's a way that we break that order united we stand divided we fall the qual among uh friends is the opportunity of foes that if we as long as we stay together we can be strong individually divide us up break that order arrange us to some other pattern and we say oh well we're all together and we're all doing this but you're do you're not arranged cuz this is where I could even put it this way sometimes I just need to focus on the family I just need to get with my family I need to spend more time with my family that's great but if you not putting the Lord first if you're not letting Christ have preeminence in the home in your personal life if you haven't found the pattern of the word and say as a family this is what we ought to have preeminence it's not just that we get together as a family we do things as a family we're all together in family and the children are going to live at home and we're going to do all these great recreational things together that that's wonderful but that's not the kind of focus that a family has in order to be strong the family has to be United together all in Harmony and agreement to the word we were doing Ah that's what I was going to ask all right I think there's enough families here parents there's a question have any of your children talked to you this week about Isaac raise your hand if any of your CH parents talk to you about Isaac in the Bible anybody anybody really God bless you what do you want Chick-fil-A gift cards in and out cash you just let's talk later okay some more hands never mind I take that back we talked to the young people about that on um on Sunday about Isaac Abraham's following God Supreme Faith Abraham's going to offer Isaac upon the altar but God never showed that to Isaac something to think about when we lose headship of the word that's when the order in the home is broken brother BR said in the world has fallen apart the beautiful virtue that God gives a woman to be a mother has been marred and that's the backbone of the nation you break motherhood you broke the nation right then that's one thing that helps hold it together real genuine I love how he comes to this Parenthood now the what stands out to me the backbone of the nation is not in Washington DC it's not not in the halls of Congress it's not in the white house it's not in the Pentagon the backbone of this nation is not in the cour houses it's not in the government institutions or in any of the assemblies it's in the home the backbone of the Nations is in the house house it's a it's the real genuine Parenthood that forms the backbone of the nation so he said if you want to know how to divide the nation divide the family if you want to know how to break up the nation break up Parenthood he says it in thirsting for life that's what breaks up homes that's what spoils children that's what makes neurotics that's what makes teenage delinquency is when motherhood and fatherhood is broke I hope you recognize now that motherhood and fatherhood is the office of being a mother the hood ship of being a father it's an order it's an arrangement it's a calling it's a it's a duty it's a responsibility and the only and the way that you can get uh spoiled children make neurotics and break up homes and cause teenage delinquency Isn't So Much by broadcasting things and making pornography available and making video games that are this way and saturating the airwaves with a bunch of nonsense all of that can be out there but if you want it to be effective you've got to break the backbone of the home and that starts with Mom and Dad now that may seem to be hard but that's maybe one of the most encouraging things I could ever say to a church this world is perverted because they broke Parenthood and you want to know how to keep perversion out of your home be a real parent be a real proactive God-fearing H mother and father who will have a backbone and stand up to the things Lord stand up even to your children's whims be diligent raise some Isaacs that when it comes to applying the token and say we're going to kick it out we're not going to do this anymore yeah I've let it go too far but I've got to apply the talken to my home we got to stand for truth we got to stand for right you want to have eyes and like okay I know this is sacrificing a lot that I like and this is a lot for me to lose but you know what you've got to obey the Lord you've got to do what you're supposed to do amen motherhood and fatherhood are the backbone it's the strength of the house and my you could just I as I mentioned contempt before you look at the selfish ambition that some parents have and the inability to F for any anybody else in the family they don't have the ability to feel for their spouse they don't have ability to feel for their children it's just all about themselves and the way they view things this is how you spoil families because it's not holding that real true position in the family as a father as a mother and Isaiah chap 32: 18 this scripture is used quite frequently for myself in ministry here especially in my people shall dwell not just in tents not just in houses with foundations not well furnished and sealed walls and permanent dwellings but he says they shall dwell in a Peaceable habitation and Ure dwell dwellings and in quiet resting places I set forth or I suggest to you tonight that what he has described has nothing to do with the physical structure it was more than a building what he's describing as a home a Peaceable habitation is a place where there's no fighting not Disturbed with the alarm of War there's there's no enemies within there's no quarreling amongst the members there's no infighting there's no division within therefore it's a sure dwelling where it's secure it's confident there's provision it's not against itself there's no infighting it's a quiet resting place it's not it's not there as a place of Labor and strife and unfortunately our homes become that for many people and when I think about it it's almost as if the pandemic Consolidated a lot of things where the husband leaves and he goes works and then he comes home and the wife is she's a housewife she works at home she works where she sleeps she works where she eats she works where she raised the kids she's laid in within the home and home is not just a place of work just a place of Labor just a place of trying to keep up the children homeschool at home they don't even get away everything the father's working from home now and then H the house becomes a place of school work labor chores and if it gets into that Rhythm that's not a really Pleasant Rhythm it's become a place of school it's become a place of work it's become a place of chores it becomes a place where all these things are happening and I believe that all those things can be in the house but if we find a way to make a house a home it's as if all those moving parts and responsibilities begin to harmonize themselves and you have a peaceful Peaceable habitation a sure dwelling and a quiet resting place because it's just not merely a place to lay my head it's not just merely a place of Labor or Strife brother Brandman the sermon Masterpiece speaks of that Great Masterpiece of the family in the garden he says the husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they are one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family and then notice this language I think we've been used this a lot maybe used it Sunday wife pulling one way the husband another A House Divided amen that would make an awful family but in agreement with love one to the other that's a family and now that was God's Masterpiece and now all the true family here portrays that think about all the work that goes into family pictures coming to the last quarter of the year we need to send out our Christmas cards New Year's cards we got a Happy Valentine's Day card but there's uh there's there's family pictures that they do and they send out and the work and the preparation and all the colors matching and everything being arranged just right you you come forward here you do this you do that we're making sure you get the picture right want everything to be right because people are going to see this but the real the way the what the real family of God portrays the real family picture the real family portrait is harmony Unity the right kind of order and brother bam teaches us he says your family is what you are so he says raise your children in a certain environment it's got to 98% better chance to go right than it has if you bring it up in the wrong way what does that do should stop us at our tracks that if I can raise them up in the right order if I can get the order right in my home if I can get a backbone as a father if I can have a backbone as a mother if we can be woven together correctly in the right sequency in the right order if we can have this in the house if we can make a house a home if this house is not divided we give our children a 98% better chance to go right than if it's out of order A House Divided is no home we should stri this should be something we labor for something we work for for order in the house to make it a home in Ephesians chap 4:3 endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace give diligence haste tend to carefully to keep Unity agreement order brother Brandman how can I overcome I think it's where he's talking about it looked at the stars and the heavens and I thought man what would happen if one of them got out of place when one gets out of order now he's speaking of us it holds it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace that word bond in the Greek is the ligaments by which members of the body are united together a sewing together in the bond of Peace it's translated to one rest quietness it's that Harmony security exemption from fighting that's what makes a house that's the bond of Peace when everyone's at peace when everyone's in Harmony when things are being AR it doesn't mean we all agree necessarily on all things but we have an agreement sure I tell my children quite often it's and I tell them and if I'm wrong in this I know the Lord will help me but they get frustrated I say it's okay that you're frustrated how how uh I I mean I'm trying to think of the right word but I mean that would just be so insensitive to say you're frustrated you're grounded that frustrates you you're grounded for a week that frustrate a month a year leave I mean where do you go with that right I mean if they're going to you just more frustration more frustrated and they blow up and you're like you know what I've had enough this is ridiculous so there's got to be a point where wisdom prevails it's okay that you're frustrated I'm frustrated that you're frustrated but I'm not breaking things right and there's a way that you address the frustration I tell my children I understand it's okay if you're frustrated but it's how we handle frustration I tell them it's okay if you disagree with me I I I don't I I'm not upset or I'm not it doesn't bother me that you think your opinion is better than me and I had to do that in order to get anywhere right it was like okay I know I'm wrong but there's a way that you look at it you're no I know you've got an opinion I know they have a Viewpoint I know you see it a certain way son I know that there you might think that this is a better way and that I'm crazy and to acknowledge and then start from there yeah you know what you feel that way and just because you feel differently than me isn't Disobedience it's not disrespectful it's not being obstinate it's not Rebellion it's how we address and handle a lack of meeting of the minds I think it's fair this way I think it's fair that way someone say oh that H that family's broken up man they're headed for ruin brother Aaron that's contempt No contempt is when well you're an idiot for feeling that way and I hate you can't wait till I turn 18 because you feel that way that that's allowing one dis difference in seeing things to cause a fight instead of just looking at and saying hey we're not we're not on opposite sides here we're in this together we I want to know what's best for you I want you to understand what I feel is best for my family and you begin to approach it from that standpoint to where it's not we're endeavoring to keep the unity there's a there's it's not the fighting because it doesn't have to always be seeing things the same way but have a Meeting of Minds to where now there's an understanding you find a place to meet when it in contract languages I alluded to it on Sunday there's a meeting of the minds now if I'm a seller my mind is high price if I'm a buyer my mind is low price right I remember one time I was in a mediation uh and I was representing a defendant the opposing party made a account an offer and asked for a bunch of money and so the mediator came to me and said how much are you going to offer I said Z doar it worked it worked I had a pretty good argument for it but the idea is that if if there's a meat of the minds what happens when you come to a conclusion is if not that you don't think you should get that you should have to pay them anything and it's not that they don't think they deserve a million dollars but you work to finally come to a place where you ackowledge something there's give and take and you arrive at a conclusion and it's mediated and then you draw up the contract and there's a meeting of the M you say well I wanted I only wanted to pay a dollar I wanted to get a billion dollars but we somehow mediated and negotiated a price and there was ultimately a meeting of the minds we're on the same page the terms are being spelled out I know there's a lot there and I've run out of time but the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 14:40 let all things be done decently and in order in the proper form remember how we looked at this it's well formed and it speaks of that Forma Beauty the the the the beauty the shapeliness the Symmetry there's a way that something works where you you see the way that something's supposed to function H my brother and I we used to kind of joke around that we that we and we would do it sometimes where you would just you would do something that was out of symmetry how a person would behave when you're in a social context just to see if people would pick up on it and and if if if after a while they'd kind of creep him out we actually had I think he still does it but not me uh I need to tell Matthew we're not playing anymore there is a way we tell a story and he'd say you remember when we were at the store I go no it wasn't a grocery store it was a ball game he goes you're right it wasn't a ball game and the Cowboys were playing saying no it wasn't Cowboys it was it was the Dallas Stars and we would do this for 5 minutes where nothing ever we never the story hadn't even begun and and that that that's the way to tell a story that's no way to interact it's it's disconcordant it's chaos it's out of order says let all things be done decently in an order or is that fixed Arrangement it's the due course it's the right way it's an orderly condition it speaks of a a a position A ranked a post of Duty based upon a person's quality based upon their character based upon their calling why because Paul says for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace he's not the author of instability or disorder but he's the author of Peace Harmony Accord as brother Bram makes this statement in God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same let all things be done decently in an order that's what brings true beauty the way symmetry the weaving together the right kind of order we've been drawn a lot from this now I think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God not the outside by Optics and by Design and architecture and materials and facade but the inside right the Box Car Can Be Heaven on Earth the palace can be hell on Earth if the inside's right by order by character he says to be grateful to the god this will not just only be a beautiful building that we've come to but may everyone that comes in not just a beautiful building but a home is what I'm saying see the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in order in the individual order in the families order in the church may it be a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is and we do appreciate the beautiful structure the beauty of the church is the character of the people these are my words the order the character and he says I trust it'll always be a house of God of beauty a house of God's Beauty a home filled with the beauty of the Lord I know I've gone over time but I still want to finish with another scripture 1 Corinthians chapter 3: 9 and 10 this will give us a good stopping point on A House Divided is no home I think we'll just move into some other areas on this but but building on this so don't leave this in your minds I want this to be uh a conversation starter yeah if I can put this way this sermon is not the subject this is an idea this is a suggestion for a subject within your home this isn't just sign seal delivered put a bow on it period let's move on to the next subject and you start thinking about oh what's the what's the next series or what's the next subject no this is a conversation suggestion this is something for you to consider in your family take this material take these principles examine Yourself by it think about it he says in 1 Corinthians chap 3: 9 and 10 he's going to come to where we call chapter 14 later let all things be done decently in an order God's not the author of confusion but of Peace he's going to deal with the symmetry of the body and let there be no Schism in chapter 12 and so there's all these things he says in chapter 12 all these things he deals with in this tremendous book and addressing different things but he he he establishes in the beginning we are labors together with God ye are God's husbandry you're the vineyard you're his field you're also his building so now whether you want to use agriculture or farming or you want to use architecture building you are God's husbandry you are God's Building they serve a purpose according to the grace of God which is given un me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation another buth thereon what what it might seem to be maybe some uh arrogance on his part but what humility it's been given to him as a wise master builder is he saying that God the master builder has hired him to lay the foundation was he calling himself a master builder he says I've laid the Foundation another will build let every man take heed how the buth how he buth there upon my challenge to all of us is to make your house a home whether it be your heart whether it be your house your residence your dwelling or this church we are called to make a house a home when brother bam said it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God he says it's a beautiful building but we have a duty to make the inside right in order for it to be a home of the Holy Spirit in order for it to be a Gate of Heaven so that when people walk in they don't just see Church order they just don't see that the message is believed here they're just not seeing the elements and the accoutrements of a message believing church but they come in and there's a Gate of Heaven because God is welcomed there and everything's done decently in order and it becomes a house of the beauty of the Lord where people can come and inquire of the Lord and see his character and see his Beauty in order and I say this to all the men that are here from the youngest to the oldest the youngest here I don't know maybe looking around who the youngest might be maybe it's Theo might be the youngest boy that's here tonight or it might be Joseph actually and you say from the youngest and he might be a little too young to be trained he's not even uh training diapers yet but you are called to be a homebuilder and some of you might think I know what I'm going to be when I grow up you're called to be it you're called to be a home builder that's what we're called to do as men is to build houses into homes I know there's a lot of talk about well with the generation this day growing up I think about it even with my son and my children it's becoming increasingly difficult especially in some areas even here in Maricopa County where it's difficult for young couples to own homes and it's very difficult uh that the entry level to find a good residence in an area you want to live and you have to go further and further out it's it's really hard to buy a house but listen it it it it's within your ability to make wherever you live a home you may not be able to right now afford your own house and own it as a house but wherever you live you can make it a home because you were called by God men are called by God to be home builders and you're either in that place right now or you're being trained for it so whether it be Joseph or James or Theo or however young or Jack and start going all the way up to the oldest that's here and different on if you're not there yet you're in training for it now to be a home builder and you say well what about the sisters well they're called to be home makers men are to be home builders ladies are to be home makers you're called to make a house a home from the youngest to the oldest you're either in training now or you're in the on the job and it's our duty it's our duty to make a house a home and we do that by looking at the order of it and we can determine whether or not we have the right order by taking an honest look at the way our house functions and at the end of the day does the picture what does the picture indicate what what value does the picture indicate when you look at the picture what could we determine based upon that portrait the things the family values am I know maybe some might say why preach this on a Wednesday night I I think this is where it's easier it's easier to preach it maybe on a Wednesday night if the musicians could come to their instruments I want to read one last statement or just make reference to it you know it brother's talking about in the early early 60s and we talk about Revival what does Revival mean and and there's a lot of really good conversations about it recently I think there was a Min there was a Minister's meeting I think the subject was going to be what is the bride's Revival and there's a Believe It or Not despite the very clear things that brother bradam said there's always differences of opinions of what that looks like and sometimes people have opinions that are just exactly against what brother brandham said uh and it can become very uh combative in some ways but brother man's talking about how a minister can't bring a Revival preacher doesn't bring a Revival that when a minister comes into town and as we have brother Jason Watkins coming in town I I don't care if he's bringing a series of notes on Revival and he's packed it in his bag he's going to bring it it's on his iPad and he had to go get an iPad Pro and get it with one terabyte of data on it in order to have everything there brother B said he doesn't pack it with them the only thing a minister can do is be loyal to God and His word is what he says but where where does the Revival come he says it comes by the people and we think oh okay the Revival comes by the people so I'll bring the Revival or I'll cause the Revival but he says in your home in your life the real Revival listen we know that Revival Services have kind of Taken on a language of its own Revival is when the church holds special services and and there's a there's maybe a certain way of worship and preaching and oh they're having a Revival and it happens within the building we hear of the Revival in Kentucky we feel the Revival here in churches have Revival services and it's all based around the building and what goes on within the building but brother bradam kind of he doesn't take away from that and he's not trying to uh throw a wet blanket on somebody's Fire or the moving of God in a church service but really what he's doing is saying this is awesome this is awesome but you want to know where the real Revival comes is when if this preeminence that the the Lord has in church services if that if you have that in your home the Revival comes in your home in your life that's how the real Revival comes we can somehow try to create some sort of dynamic and structure where you all just leave your home life under the uh under the beautiful patio that we have in the awning and you just all kind of leave it there and we kind of say leave it there leave it there we kind of leave our home life at the doorstep and we come in here and we play church and if we could all agree to do that you know what we could have some really awesome church church services would you agree we can have some really really awesome church services and you'll have some really really crummy days at home and my goal is not to have awesome church services and crummy families I would I wouldn't mind if people looked at our church and said they have the most boring crummy church services and you guys have the most awesome radiated powerful home lives that this Valley's ever seen and the critics are like ah there's no revival going on in Arizona Believers Church because all they see is what happens on this box as they call it you got a new background brother Aaron he's still preaching in a box to your F your the five people in your family that sit in a chair is it just you say I it doesn't matter to me what they think about this but I want you to know as an individual it doesn't matter to me what they think it matters to me that you know in your family you can have a Revival and that the order can be right and relationships can find the right kind of balance and symmetry that we can quit being selfish we can quit we the mother pulling One Way father pulling another the daughter's out doing this the sun's out doing that but we find a way to catch or Shake ourselves we say I I don't want this house to be divided anymore I want this house to be United oh God make this house a home because that's where the Revival comes is in my home life oh God help me Lord Jesus are you willing to embrace that challenge are you are you willing to embrace the challenge to be be a homebuilder you might think man I I'm I'm not a home builder you know what I'll just admit it I can I could hardly hang a picture in the house you just look behind the picture see how many holes are there I drilled a hole into Eliza's room from the garage the other day oh whoops because I thought I found the stud I wasn't I wasn't in the right spot like oh that's that's that that's going to give right just right through so that might I might be inept when it comes to maybe actually building a house but I am confident tonight that there's a wise master builder who's called me brother Aaron to be a home builder and by his grace I can do it and I could say this too for the ladies here there's a wise master builder that's called you to be a homemaker and by Grace God's grace you can do it let's embrace it let's Embrace this beautiful calling this calling to make houses homes
