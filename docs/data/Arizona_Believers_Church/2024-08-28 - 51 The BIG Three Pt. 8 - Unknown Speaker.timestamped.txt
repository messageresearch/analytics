[0:00] As we mentioned, we're going to continue
[0:02] on the big three. I feel that every time
[0:04] we say this uh that it might bear some
[0:07] explaining what we mean by the big
[0:09] three, but it's that satanic trinity of
[0:11] the lust of the eyes, the lust of the
[0:13] flesh, and the pride of life. And we've
[0:15] seen the symmetry of the desiring of the
[0:18] lust of the flesh being akin to the
[0:21] desire for money and the filthy lucer
[0:23] and the love of money is the root of all
[0:24] evil and how that even in the lust of
[0:27] the eyes that it's uh connected with
[0:29] that lust of the flesh that lusting
[0:31] after something you see how it can be
[0:34] that lusting in a physical sense after
[0:36] something uh in a that not necessarily
[0:38] in a physical sense but in that
[0:40] spiritual sense we saw that in the
[0:42] temptation of Christ the temptation of
[0:44] the woman in the beginning. And so
[0:46] tonight, just in this uh outset in
[0:49] discussing
[0:51] uh the the pride of life, I want us to
[0:54] recognize its association with
[0:56] popularity. We can bring it to Jude 11
[0:58] wherein there's the gain saying of
[1:00] Korus. So we have the heir of Balum um
[1:02] and the way of Cain and then we have the
[1:05] gain saying of Kora. There's your three.
[1:07] and then how that now this popularity
[1:10] and this temptation of popularity is
[1:12] represented by King Saul. So we read
[1:14] some of his story tonight. So the big
[1:17] three is all that is in the world and we
[1:19] know that it's designed by Satan and uh
[1:23] directed by Satan as a temptation to all
[1:25] that he might delude us uh and also
[1:28] ultimately I believe to destroy us,
[1:29] cause us to fail. And I was thinking
[1:32] about this earlier today and I think I
[1:34] began just to move some things around so
[1:36] that we could give more context to this
[1:38] on Sunday. But really at the heart of
[1:40] this faith in the word is the only
[1:43] protection against these things. That
[1:46] it's faith in the word. Faith and word
[1:48] together. Faith in the word of God. No,
[1:50] you can't put faith in something else.
[1:52] But faith in the word is the only thing
[1:53] that has absolute power over the lust of
[1:56] the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the
[1:57] pride of life. And in order for any of
[2:00] those things to thrive in our soil or to
[2:03] gain root in our lives, there has to be
[2:06] something lacking in our faith,
[2:07] right?
[2:08] Uh the word's perfect. There's nothing
[2:09] wrong with the word, but there's got to
[2:11] be some deficiency somewhere in order
[2:14] for those things to begin to take root
[2:15] and grow. And and I say that by no means
[2:18] to discourage you. I say it just to so
[2:20] we could be like, "Oh, well, that's why
[2:21] this is becoming problematic. I need to
[2:23] feed my faith by the word of God to
[2:25] become a little bit more robust to
[2:27] overcome fear and complexes and these
[2:29] different things.
[2:31] Now, I'm going to I want to jump right
[2:32] into uh pride of life. And we mentioned
[2:36] this before how uh Jude says and they've
[2:38] gone in the with in in the gains of
[2:41] Kora. And we realized that Kora and his
[2:44] group rejected the prophet and the word
[2:46] of God because they wanted a part of the
[2:49] leadership. Moses, you and your family
[2:51] put too much on yourself. we being
[2:53] Levites, we should have a place in the
[2:54] priesthood. And they didn't want it
[2:57] because they really wanted to help. They
[2:59] wanted to show off.
[3:00] They wanted to be just as visible as
[3:02] Moses and his family. So, uh there's a
[3:05] little bit of in the pride of life, I
[3:07] want you to think in terms of showing
[3:08] off wherein you may do something, but
[3:11] your motive and objective is essentially
[3:12] to be seen or acknowledged. So, the
[3:15] pride of life is the desire for
[3:17] recognition. That hunger for prestige
[3:19] and for honor. Maybe to say it in a less
[3:22] nefarious way, it's it's the longing to
[3:24] be accepted. And immediately we all
[3:26] should go, "Ooh, really?"
[3:27] Right.
[3:28] That that's the pride of life. Oh, I
[3:30] forgot. I wanted to welcome Bella here
[3:31] tonight. And I've completely forgotten
[3:33] all my announcements. It's good to have
[3:35] you both here tonight. Bella, it's good
[3:36] to see you. But they there's this des
[3:38] this longing for acceptance. Well, as
[3:40] you get to the heart of that, sometimes
[3:42] it's it's not coming from a really good
[3:44] place, even though we could understand
[3:45] it, but it's the pride of life. There's
[3:48] this coveting praise. You're you're
[3:50] jealous for rank or clout or uh or or to
[3:52] be status. You want to be identified.
[3:55] And I believe the world has caught on to
[3:56] this and that's why you can earn badges.
[3:58] And there's ways that you can signify
[4:00] through social media who you are. Uh I
[4:02] think what I did on my WhatsApp some
[4:03] time ago is I actually put verified on
[4:06] my profile so that people would be like,
[4:07] "Wait, how do you get that? How do you I
[4:09] want to be verified. I'm willing to pay
[4:11] for it." And and so there's just this
[4:13] desire to to achieve certain ranks and
[4:16] certain statuses. And I think the world
[4:17] has recognized that. And so pride of
[4:19] life is connected with that showing off
[4:22] that pretense for the purpose of
[4:23] acceptance or recognition. And when I
[4:26] say that, we should think about the
[4:27] Pharisees who according to the word of
[4:30] God acted not that they might keep the
[4:32] law, but tried to keep the law in such a
[4:34] way to where it's like, hey, did anybody
[4:36] see that? Anybody notice what we did?
[4:39] And so in Matthew chap 23:es 5 and 6,
[4:42] but all their works they do for to be
[4:44] seen of men that they make broad their
[4:46] felacttories and enlarge the borders of
[4:48] their garments and love the uppermost
[4:51] rooms at feast and the chief seats in
[4:53] the synagogues and greetings in the
[4:55] markets and to be called of men rabbi.
[4:58] Rabbi, this is what is in their heart.
[5:02] They may be doing things that it they
[5:04] may be pious and they're acting in a way
[5:05] that appears to be righteous. And they
[5:07] seem to be keeping their distance from
[5:09] the world, but they're doing it to be
[5:11] seen of men. And they make their Bibles
[5:13] really, really big, so people know
[5:15] they're carrying the the word of God.
[5:17] And and they enlarge the borders of
[5:19] their garments so they appear more holy.
[5:21] And they love, notice this, the upper
[5:22] rooms at feasts, right? There's a
[5:24] there's a separate table for the
[5:27] ministry. There's they're they're
[5:28] better. They're a separate class. the
[5:30] upper rooms and the chief seats in the
[5:32] synagogues. They want people to see them
[5:34] when they come in. They want to be on
[5:36] the platform for people. Oh, there's a
[5:37] rabbi. Oh, he's here. He's there. And
[5:40] the greetings in the market. They want
[5:41] people to know who they are. Rabbi,
[5:44] rabbi. It's like that story I heard one
[5:46] time where this traveler who I guess
[5:48] maybe was semi famousamous or thought
[5:49] that they were somebody and they were
[5:51] really really upset and they're at the
[5:52] ticket counter wanting to board their
[5:53] flight and they're not getting
[5:54] attention. They cut line and uh and it's
[5:57] like I I I want to be heard. I I have a
[5:59] problem. I want to be heard. And he and
[6:00] the lady said, "You can get in the back
[6:02] of the line like everyone else." And he
[6:04] said, "Ma'am, do you know who I am?" So
[6:07] she just looked at him and she got on
[6:08] the intercom and she said, "Attention
[6:09] everyone at gate 28. If anybody knows
[6:11] who this man is at the counter, he seems
[6:14] to have forgotten who he is." And so the
[6:17] question, "Do you know who I am?" A lot
[6:18] of times maybe come in the place maybe
[6:19] you don't know who you are because you
[6:21] think too much of yourself. But that
[6:23] would be these rabbis who wanted to be
[6:25] recognized and acknowledged and that's
[6:27] why they looked the part. We've we've
[6:30] gone through this in great detail
[6:32] already. How that in Luke chapter 4 in
[6:34] the temptation of Christ in the
[6:36] wilderness when Jesus was tempted with
[6:38] the lust of the eye, the lust of the
[6:39] flesh, and the pride of life, uh which
[6:41] correspond to the temptation of the
[6:43] woman in the garden that when Satan
[6:44] said, "Well, let's come to the pinnacle
[6:46] of the temple in public before all the
[6:49] people and you jump and if you are the
[6:51] son of God, God will save you because
[6:53] this is what he said." And it's not it's
[6:57] not acting in a manner in obedient to
[6:59] obedience to the word of God so that God
[7:01] fulfills his word but it's showing off
[7:04] doing it public show doing it in a way
[7:06] that people say oh well this is what God
[7:08] said this Messiah would do and he
[7:09] wouldn't let his foot be dashed against
[7:11] a stone he was doing it because oh the
[7:13] Bible says you shall take up deadly
[7:14] serpents and they shall not harm you. So
[7:16] we pass out the snakes to what? Show
[7:18] off. or we act in a way to try to prove
[7:22] who we are that we're sons of God by
[7:24] being able to manufacture a promise of
[7:27] God.
[7:28] And so he says, "If you're the son of
[7:30] God, jump and God will save you and
[7:32] that'll prove that you're the son of
[7:33] God." And with the woman in Genesis 3:6,
[7:36] when she saw with her eyes that the tree
[7:38] was be to be desired to make one wise,
[7:41] and what was at the heart of that? To
[7:43] make her godlike,
[7:44] right?
[7:45] But not truly godlike. godlike in the
[7:48] way that Satan wanted to be God. Satan
[7:50] had an image of God and it was a
[7:52] perverted image yet he wanted to be like
[7:54] that. So it was in her mind she wanted
[7:56] to become godlike. It's rooted in that
[7:58] desire to make one wise. That desire for
[8:01] worldly knowledge. It's rooted in the
[8:02] pride of life.
[8:04] Now the pride of life is connected to
[8:07] Saul. We see this in the message of the
[8:09] hour that that sin of Saul was um the
[8:13] pride of life. I say the pride of life,
[8:14] but we know Saul's connected with
[8:16] popularity. This coveting for honor and
[8:18] applause. Keep this in mind too about
[8:21] Saul since I'm sure you're all very
[8:22] familiar with his life story that
[8:24] ultimately with Saul, it's manifested in
[8:26] his unwillingness to repent because of
[8:28] his pride.
[8:29] Right?
[8:29] So, this is at the heart of a Saul
[8:31] complex or the manner of Saul. And
[8:34] brother Brandham makes this statement in
[8:36] 1956. He says, I know there's two or
[8:38] three things that a minister has to
[8:39] watch and one of them is money. So,
[8:41] money, women, popularity, and so forth.
[8:43] And we've showed that that's not just
[8:45] for preachers, it's for people, right?
[8:48] And that uh if a preacher has to keep
[8:49] these things clean, keep himself clean
[8:51] in these things, it's because he's going
[8:53] to teach you to keep yourself clean in
[8:55] these things. And he doesn't want to
[8:56] undermine that teaching. He said, "So, I
[8:58] made a pledge to God and found out that
[9:00] Samson fell because of Delilah, the
[9:02] woman, and I found out that Saul fell
[9:04] because of,
[9:06] he says, pride." Right.
[9:08] And so the money, women of popularity,
[9:10] it's connected as popularity is connect
[9:11] with pride. Balam fell because of money
[9:13] and all those things are written for our
[9:15] example. Said the book of Hebrews. We're
[9:17] learning from these. They're written for
[9:18] our example. He says, "And we watch
[9:20] those things and keep the blood covered
[9:22] between us and those things." There's
[9:24] your secret. Keep the blood that buffer
[9:27] of the blood of Jesus Christ between you
[9:29] and those things. So Saul Saul's sin or
[9:33] Saul's temptation or his weakness as it
[9:35] was man as Balam manifested the weakness
[9:38] to money Samson the weakness to women we
[9:41] could see that in Saul there was a
[9:43] weakness to popularity and popularity if
[9:46] we just used a definition that fits for
[9:48] our English language and for those of us
[9:50] who are familiar with the word it's
[9:52] being beloved by people that doesn't
[9:54] sound too bad to be beloved by people
[9:57] it's being liked or admired and
[9:59] supported by many and to be popular is
[10:02] to be well-liked or admired by or
[10:04] enjoying the favor of the people. So
[10:07] popularity is that condition or state of
[10:10] being well-liked by people admired by
[10:12] the people or enjoying popular is
[10:14] enjoying the favor of the people. And I
[10:18] would say that we could find a way just
[10:19] to kind of massage that a little bit and
[10:21] said that the the uh the uh popularity
[10:24] is being accepted by many people or
[10:26] having this particular opinion of you.
[10:28] And there's a way that in speaking of
[10:30] it, we wouldn't kind of have a
[10:31] resistance to it. But the Bible cautions
[10:34] us about popularity. In Luke 6:es 24-
[10:38] 26, it says, "But woe unto you that are
[10:40] rich, for ye have received your
[10:42] consolation." There's these woes that he
[10:45] begins to express here in chapter 6. And
[10:48] one of them is to the wealthy or the
[10:50] rich. And what does he say about him?
[10:52] Not even not trying to use even an
[10:54] analogy. Just says, you know, it's hard
[10:55] for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
[10:57] of heaven. like a camel through an eye
[10:58] of the needle. And he and he's just
[11:00] being very literal, but he's using this
[11:01] exaggeration to say that's how hard it
[11:03] is. Paul, we're taught that many that be
[11:06] rich fall into a snare. And James, they
[11:08] fall into a snare and a temptation and a
[11:10] trap. And so, it's at the heart of these
[11:13] temptations to be drawn to these things.
[11:14] And Jesus said, "Woe to you that are
[11:16] rich. You've received your consolation.
[11:18] Woe unto you that are full, for you
[11:19] shall hunger. Woe you into that laugh
[11:22] now, for you shall mourn and weep."
[11:24] There's a lot that we could mine out of
[11:26] this. But then he says, "Woe unto you
[11:28] when all men shall speak well of you,
[11:31] for so did their fathers to the false
[11:32] prophets."
[11:37] We'll be coming to a scripture in Samuel
[11:39] a little bit later, maybe we could bring
[11:41] this out in some greater detail. Just
[11:43] not sure if we'll have the time. But we
[11:45] can't we can't take this scripture to
[11:47] mean that you're better off if everybody
[11:49] speaks evil of you,
[11:51] right? because that it just might be
[11:53] easy to make that happen for all the
[11:55] wrong reasons. So, there's something
[11:57] about what he's saying that's not just
[12:00] uh we should say, "Well, everybody hates
[12:01] me and nobody likes me, I'm going to go
[12:03] eat some worms or however the song
[12:05] goes." And and because you're a
[12:07] narcissist, because you're a liar or
[12:08] you're a serial serial killer, that's
[12:10] why everyone doesn't like you. And you
[12:12] just say, "Well, the Bible says, you
[12:14] know, beware if if people like you."
[12:16] There's something more to this that's
[12:18] being expressed. Woe unto you when men
[12:21] speak well of you, for so did their
[12:22] fathers to the false prophets. And the
[12:25] sermon, we read this recently in the
[12:27] sermon, to whom should we go? Brother
[12:29] Brham is speaking about Christ. He says
[12:30] he's the only eternal salvation. We may
[12:32] have a lot of other foundations, but
[12:34] Christ is the only eternal salvation
[12:36] foundation. He says everything else will
[12:38] fall except Christ.
[12:40] And that's nothing but the truth.
[12:42] Everything else will fall but Christ. He
[12:44] says your money doesn't have an eternal
[12:46] foundation. So we're looking at these
[12:47] woes that that Jesus is talking about.
[12:49] You cannot have an eternal foundation
[12:51] upon popularity.
[12:53] That's the great sin of America is
[12:55] trying to be popular. Women trying to
[12:57] dress popular, men trying to act
[13:00] popular.
[13:01] So where in a woman's temptation might
[13:03] be to the lust of the eye and those
[13:05] things that are pleasing to the eye, uh
[13:08] the man here is tempted to uh this to
[13:11] leads to men trying to act popular.
[13:14] Notice how this popular, we're all we're
[13:16] all kind of caught up into it. He says,
[13:18] "Being popular, I hope you hear this
[13:21] because this is really at the heart of
[13:22] this study. Being popular, popularity
[13:25] usually leads to sin and disgrace."
[13:29] And so, if you were a sinner in high
[13:30] school, you could say, "Well, I was kind
[13:32] of popular when I was in high school."
[13:34] But being popular leads to sin and
[13:36] disgrace. He says, "Tree or four
[13:37] marriages and all kinds of stuff. It has
[13:39] no eternal foundation." Now, that that
[13:42] kind of is eye-catching that being
[13:44] popular usually leads to sin and
[13:46] disgrace. So, someone is wellknown or
[13:47] famous uh or there's some reason why
[13:50] they're renowned and they have a name
[13:51] amongst the people, it doesn't mean
[13:53] they're destined for sin, but there's
[13:55] something about human nature when joined
[13:57] with uh broad acceptance to where
[13:59] there's this temptation. and he says
[14:01] multiple marriages and he's saying being
[14:03] popular, being accepted, being the cool
[14:04] guy, having a lot of friends doesn't
[14:06] necessarily mean that you're uh that
[14:09] you're secure. And and if you are in
[14:12] that status, it doesn't necessarily mean
[14:13] that you're going to fall. But you have
[14:15] to be more careful because popularity
[14:17] tends to lead to sin and disgrace. Even
[14:20] the Bible says when a man has a lot of
[14:21] friends, he shows himself friendly. But
[14:23] it's not necessarily speaking that if
[14:25] you want to have a lot of friends, be
[14:27] friendly, though it speaks to that
[14:28] proposition. But a man who wants to have
[14:30] a lot of friends has to spread himself
[14:32] really really thin to make a lot of
[14:34] people happy and usually doesn't have
[14:36] those close friends
[14:38] uh that really know him and appreciate
[14:40] him for who he is but they just want to
[14:42] be popular and accepted. So it says
[14:44] beware when all men or woe on you when
[14:46] all men speak well of you. This is that
[14:49] sin of pride this danger of popularity.
[14:53] And when we are tempted to the pride of
[14:56] life or popularity, I'm wanting to kind
[14:57] of use them as one and the same. It is a
[14:59] snare and it is a trap. As brother
[15:03] Brandham is saying, being popular
[15:04] usually leads to sin. That means that
[15:06] there's a trap in being broadly
[15:07] accepted. There's a there's a snare when
[15:09] we're tempted to want to act in a way
[15:10] that to make others want to be a part of
[15:13] or make us a part of what they're doing.
[15:15] In John 15:E 19, I want you to catch
[15:19] just uh the the heart of this. If you
[15:21] were of the world, the world would love
[15:22] his own. But because you are not of the
[15:25] world, but I have chosen you out of the
[15:28] world, therefore the world hateth you.
[15:31] We do not instinctively embrace hate.
[15:36] Some people may, they may be quick to do
[15:37] it, but there's a lot of suffering and
[15:40] there's a really complicated character
[15:42] narrative when there's people who in
[15:44] their adult life just instinctively
[15:46] embrace hate. But we don't instinctively
[15:48] do it as humans. We're we're not
[15:50] welcoming of rejection. If anything, in
[15:53] the society that we live in now, we're
[15:54] kind of all being coddled to be
[15:56] comfortable and wherein where we should
[15:58] in some cases embrace being
[16:00] uncomfortable and and be willing to
[16:02] experience difficulty. But this speaks
[16:05] to the human condition that when someone
[16:06] hates you, it generally will hurt even
[16:08] if you don't know them.
[16:10] I'm sure that if I if I came up to you
[16:12] and said, "I met this guy and he
[16:14] absolutely hates your guts." You who?
[16:16] Who?
[16:18] And it may not be something you ever met
[16:20] before, but it like, you know, I don't
[16:22] like the fact that they hate me. They've
[16:23] never met me. How do they know that? Or
[16:25] like, oh, you mean someone hates me?
[16:27] That's awful. I wish they could meet me
[16:29] that so they know I'm not really a bad
[16:30] person. And so, it's natural for us to
[16:33] not want to be hated. It's certainly
[16:34] natural to not want to be rejected. And
[16:36] many of us understand the pain that
[16:38] comes with that. So Jesus is saying,
[16:40] listen, if the world hates you, know
[16:42] that they hated me before they hated
[16:44] you. And the reason why they hate you is
[16:46] because you're not of them and that
[16:47] you've been chosen out of the world.
[16:51] So there is just on the most basic level
[16:54] this idea that you cannot be friends
[16:56] with the world and be a friend of God.
[16:58] You can't just be broadly accepted by
[17:00] the world and like, man, the world loves
[17:02] me. Everybody loves me. Everyone
[17:04] everywhere just thinks I'm a great guy.
[17:06] and actually really really really be
[17:07] living in the truth.
[17:09] And I would say as much as I have it in
[17:11] my heart to be a witness to the
[17:12] community and as much as I believe I
[17:14] have a grace for those in different
[17:16] lifestyles and different backgrounds and
[17:18] their sinful living and and whatever
[17:20] they might have been mixed up in and
[17:21] whatever their life stories are and I I
[17:24] want to be respected by people in the
[17:25] community and I want fellow uh people I
[17:28] work with and different professionals
[17:29] and clients, you name it. I I want to
[17:31] have a good report and a good testimony,
[17:33] but I realize if that's all I'm after,
[17:35] it would lead me to compromise when
[17:37] certain subjects come up and I'm like,
[17:39] "Oh, well, that's great."
[17:42] Or you try to compromise in different
[17:45] social situations, and brothers here may
[17:47] know this very well, that you find
[17:48] yourself in some sort of mandatory
[17:50] meeting or conference, and guess what?
[17:52] There's drinks being served. You don't
[17:54] want to alien anything. You don't want
[17:55] to be out oddball. You could find
[17:58] yourself being pressured what to
[17:59] assimilate or fit in because you you
[18:02] want to be a witness. You want to be
[18:03] friendly. You don't want to make anybody
[18:04] feel bad. This is all connected with
[18:07] this pride of life and popularity.
[18:11] But there is a point at which you must
[18:13] stand for the word of God.
[18:15] And that's when thousands of people
[18:17] would leave you. That's when people
[18:19] would turn against you. Now, we're not
[18:20] doing we're not being persecuted for
[18:22] evil's sake. It's like, well, you lied.
[18:24] You did this. You did that. But when we
[18:26] do well and we're hated, that's not what
[18:28] Jesus is saying when he says, "Beware
[18:30] when men everyone speaks well of you."
[18:33] But he and and in this scripture that
[18:35] they hate you. They don't hate you for
[18:36] evildoing. As Peter said, "They hate you
[18:37] for welloing."
[18:40] And Jesus says, "Woe unto you when all
[18:41] men shall speak well of you."
[18:45] And and he says, "For so did their
[18:47] fathers to the false prophets." What did
[18:49] they do? The fathers in Israel spoke
[18:51] highly of the false prophets. They spoke
[18:54] well of the false prophets. Well, why?
[18:57] Micah says it this way. Chapter 2 11. If
[19:00] a man walking in the spirit and
[19:01] falsehood do lie,
[19:04] saying, I will prophesy unto thee of
[19:06] wine and of strong drink, he shall even
[19:09] be the prophet of this people. What's
[19:12] the scripture saying? That if he tells
[19:15] you what you want to hear, he's your
[19:18] prophet.
[19:20] If he's prophesying strong drink and
[19:23] he's prophesying to you wine, he's
[19:24] prophesying to you years of blessing and
[19:26] he's yay sayaeth the Lord, although you
[19:28] have rejected me, I'll pour out my
[19:30] blessings upon you regardless for you
[19:32] are forever betrod to me, regardless of
[19:34] your harlotry and your wanderings. You
[19:36] are my beloved forever and I'll never
[19:38] forsake you. And everybody's like that
[19:40] is a vindicated prophet if I've ever
[19:42] heard one. And it's this temptation.
[19:45] This is the pressures of popularity. In
[19:47] other words, a prophet, one who a false
[19:50] prophet speaks kind words to the people
[19:53] so that they will embrace him, so that
[19:56] they will accept him and that they will
[19:58] acknowledge him as being the prophet of
[20:00] his people. So Jesus says, "Beware and
[20:02] woe unto you when all men speak well of
[20:04] you." Because so did the people speak
[20:07] well of false prophets because he wanted
[20:09] to be accepted and he was giving them
[20:11] what they wanted and they were happy to
[20:13] accept somebody who wasn't speaking the
[20:15] truth.
[20:17] And in John 12:es 36-43
[20:21] well let's start with verse 40.
[20:24] He hath blinded their eyes and hardened
[20:27] their heart. It's it's quoting from
[20:28] Isaiah. That they should not see with
[20:30] their eyes nor understand with their
[20:32] heart and be converted and I should heal
[20:34] them. And this is preceded by Christ
[20:38] speaking of walking in the light. And he
[20:40] says these things said Isaiah when he
[20:42] saw his glory and spake of him. Now
[20:45] Christ has been prophesied by Isaiah.
[20:47] Christ is the Messiah and there's many
[20:50] whose eyes are blind and their hearts
[20:51] are hardened. But then it says this in
[20:53] verse 42. Nevertheless, among the chief
[20:56] rulers also many believed on him. So
[20:59] there are those who fulfilled the
[21:00] prophecy of their eyes being blind and
[21:02] their hearts hardened. But now this is a
[21:04] category of people who we could say
[21:06] hearts aren't necessarily hardened or
[21:07] their eyes aren't blinded. But because
[21:10] of the Pharisees, they did not confess
[21:12] them, lest they should be put out of the
[21:14] synagogue.
[21:16] So there were uh chief rulers
[21:20] uh uh well-known people of that day,
[21:22] some sort of standing whose eyes were
[21:24] not blinded, nor were their hearts
[21:26] hardened. So in their hearts they said,
[21:27] "This must be the Messiah. This is him."
[21:30] They're they're not of the ilk that
[21:32] Isaiah is prophesying of. But because if
[21:36] they confessed Christ, they'd be kicked
[21:38] out of their church. They kept their
[21:39] mouth shut.
[21:41] They didn't say anything. Why? Verse 43.
[21:44] For they love the praise of men more
[21:47] than the praise of God.
[21:49] This is the pride of life. This is
[21:51] popularity. When you love the praise of
[21:54] men, the acceptance of men, the
[21:56] assimilation into a group or the
[21:58] acknowledgements amongst a certain uh
[22:00] number of people. When you love the
[22:02] praise of men, the popularity, the
[22:04] acceptance, the belonging more than the
[22:08] compliments of God, more than the praise
[22:11] of God, wherein he's pleased with you
[22:12] because you have simply believed and
[22:14] kept his word.
[22:18] This is at the heart of the sin of
[22:21] popularity or the weakness, the
[22:23] temptation of popularity, the pride of
[22:26] life being connected with this
[22:31] desire to be admired, the desire to be
[22:34] accepted. We can say popularity is being
[22:37] well-liked and and accepted by many
[22:39] people and being beloved u supported by
[22:42] many uh broadly accepted by a lot of
[22:44] people. If that's what popularity is,
[22:46] the temptation of popularity is that you
[22:48] would want to be accepted by many, that
[22:51] that that works on you, that if you feel
[22:53] like you were going to lose some
[22:53] followers, right? You wouldn't dare post
[22:56] something that might cause you to lose
[22:58] followers. If anything, people will just
[23:00] do the craziest things in order to get
[23:02] them. Why? Because they they want a
[23:04] following.
[23:06] Now, Saul is a great example, and I I'm
[23:09] hoping that we don't belabor anything
[23:11] tonight, and we'll try to make it
[23:12] through a little bit on Saul and pick up
[23:14] on it Sunday morning. Saul is an example
[23:17] of how that all of us can be tempted
[23:19] with the pride of life and and this
[23:21] popularity. He's a king. He's well known
[23:24] in scripture, but he represents
[23:26] something that every person struggles
[23:28] with. Some struggle with things uh
[23:30] privately and they struggle with things
[23:31] in and they're not on the stage. But
[23:34] Saul is somebody that's put on a stage
[23:36] and struggles with something that's very
[23:37] common to man. We realize according to
[23:39] the scripture, there's no temptation
[23:41] that have taken you but such as common
[23:42] to man. And then Jesus Christ was
[23:44] tempted in all points and like manners
[23:46] we were. And so there's those that
[23:48] suffer on a grand stage. There's those
[23:50] that have suffered in public and they do
[23:52] it not to say, "Oh, well that's the
[23:54] dangers of being king and good thing
[23:56] none of us are part of the royal family,
[23:57] right?
[23:58] But that's not the point. It's the point
[24:00] that this is this is common to man.
[24:03] And brother Brandham said and through
[24:04] popularity about Saul, he wanted to be
[24:06] big and above someone else and he fell
[24:09] by this.
[24:10] Now notice that when we get to the
[24:12] scripture, Saul was quite tall. He was
[24:14] already above everybody else.
[24:16] But that wasn't enough.
[24:19] He fell by this, brother Bam said. And
[24:20] brother Brandham equated these things
[24:22] and he makes this tag to one of these
[24:23] statements. trying to think you're just
[24:25] a little better than somebody else. And
[24:28] if I could say this, when you think
[24:29] you're better than somebody else, you'll
[24:31] often speak and act to prove it.
[24:35] Whether that means you try to do things
[24:37] to make yourself look good or things to
[24:39] make someone else look bad,
[24:40] right?
[24:41] We could probably just break out into
[24:44] sessions, just do breakout groups on
[24:45] that right there. Think about it. If you
[24:47] think you're better than somebody else,
[24:49] you're generally going to act in some
[24:50] way to prove it.
[24:54] And Saul's undoing is rooted and and
[24:57] this is very important for me to say
[24:58] this now. If we have time to read
[25:00] through these scriptures, I want you to
[25:01] catch this now. So I' I've been reading
[25:03] through the life of Saul, studying the
[25:04] life of Saul, and I want to say this
[25:06] before we get to the scripture. His
[25:07] failure, his undoing, his fallen is
[25:09] rooted in the opinion he had of himself
[25:12] or how he viewed himself and how he
[25:16] viewed in his opinion of the praise of
[25:17] others.
[25:19] He had a complex. He had a complex about
[25:21] the way he saw himself and he had a
[25:23] complex about what how others saw him.
[25:26] We often talk about a Saul complex and
[25:28] we speak of a Saul complex as it relates
[25:30] to Saul looking at David, the one who
[25:32] would inherit his throne or some young
[25:33] buck who's coming up and how he was uh
[25:36] seeking to kill him and didn't want his
[25:37] throne taken away from him. But before
[25:39] we see how it manifest in that murderous
[25:42] spirit, then it's important to come back
[25:43] and see what it was like in Saul in its
[25:45] innocence and find out what was the
[25:48] source of this Saul complex we talk
[25:50] about,
[25:51] right?
[25:51] What made him that way? And you'll find
[25:53] it's how he viewed himself and it's how
[25:54] he viewed others. And it was his pride
[25:57] that drove him to prove himself to
[26:00] himself and to prove himself to others.
[26:04] In 1st Samuel chapter nine, let's just
[26:06] start with verse 17.
[26:08] We read already these things and how
[26:10] that uh Saul is well we could have gone
[26:13] back further and how that Saul was
[26:15] looking uh for the livestock that had
[26:17] gotten away and that the Lord had
[26:18] appeared unto Samuel and said there's
[26:20] going to be one coming and as Saul
[26:22] approaches and he's going to find the
[26:25] seer's house according to the the
[26:27] maidens that gave directions and you
[26:28] you'd find all this uh in prior in this
[26:31] chapter and when Samuel saw saw Saul the
[26:35] Lord said unto him behold the man who I
[26:37] spake to thee of this same shall reign
[26:39] over my people. So we read how that Saul
[26:42] draws near and he says, "Is this the
[26:44] prophet's house?" And Samuel says, "I am
[26:46] the prophet. Come with me to a high
[26:48] place and we shall eat and and tomorrow
[26:51] you can leave and I'm going to tell you
[26:52] things that are in your heart." And to
[26:55] prove in verse 20 that he's this
[26:57] prophet, he says, "Your asses that were
[26:58] lost three days ago." There's this uh
[27:00] pinpointing these things. Uh don't worry
[27:03] about them. They've been found. And he
[27:06] makes this extraordinary statement. Now,
[27:07] I think I've given you enough already.
[27:09] And I can say that as you read this
[27:11] story, starting in chapter nine there.
[27:13] There's not a lot a lot of other context
[27:15] to Saul except one part that we'll read
[27:18] here in a moment, but that his Israel
[27:21] wants a king. His his asses are missing
[27:24] of his father's stock. He's going out to
[27:26] find him and Saul is looking for him.
[27:28] And now he says, "And on whom is all the
[27:32] desire of Israel?" What is all the
[27:35] desire of the people looking to? and
[27:37] projected to and what is it they want
[27:39] and what is it they're longing for and
[27:40] he says is it not on thee and in all thy
[27:44] father's house as quite a statement and
[27:48] Saul answers and says in verse 21 not I
[27:51] a Benjamite
[27:53] of the smallest of the tribes of Israel
[27:55] now think of that and my family the
[27:57] least of all the families of the tribe
[27:59] of Benjamin wherefore then speakest thou
[28:02] so to me and when we read that I know
[28:04] we're first thinking man Saul that's my
[28:06] always humble.
[28:08] Saul wasn't so much humble as he was
[28:10] insecure.
[28:11] Right.
[28:12] And so immediately he's demonstrating
[28:14] his insecurity when the pro prophet
[28:16] says, "All the desire of Israel is upon
[28:19] you in your father's house." He's like,
[28:21] "Well, we are the smallest tribe and
[28:24] what's so great about my family in the
[28:26] tribe of Benjamin?"
[28:28] He's fixated on his family's reputation
[28:30] and the size of the tribe
[28:32] that there's things that are that are
[28:34] kind of in his orbit that he's thinking
[28:36] about and he demonstrates this
[28:38] insecurity. Matt, may seem humble, and I
[28:40] don't want to necessarily paint a
[28:42] different picture of Saul at this point,
[28:43] but I I do want you to recognize that
[28:46] though it seems humble, it foreshadows
[28:49] this insecurity in Saul's heart.
[28:52] That it's what he says isn't like, "Oh,
[28:55] I'm I'm nothing." He throws off on his
[28:58] dad,
[28:59] right?
[29:00] I'm gonna be something. Have you ever
[29:01] met Brother David?
[29:02] Huh? You ever seen my brothers? Right.
[29:05] He's not honest about himself. He's just
[29:07] immediately starts throwing his family
[29:08] under the bus and the whole tribe.
[29:13] He says, "So, how could you say this to
[29:14] me? We're a small tribe. I wish maybe
[29:17] he's thinking, man, I wish I was part of
[29:18] a Levite or I wish I was in the tribe of
[29:19] Judah."
[29:21] And so, there's something about this
[29:23] that I want you to just read and you're
[29:25] free just allow the Lord to speak to you
[29:27] however you want to, but let's just
[29:29] suggest or propose right now that could
[29:31] this be insecurity on uh Saul's part.
[29:35] And let me say that insecurity is often
[29:38] rooted in pride.
[29:40] Sometimes we think, oh, it's weakness,
[29:42] it's smallalness, it's it's humility.
[29:44] No, a lot of times our insecurity comes
[29:46] back to pride.
[29:49] I I'll say it this way. A lack of
[29:51] trusting God and more looking to what
[29:52] you lack.
[29:54] 1st Samuel chapter 9:es 1 and 2 has
[29:56] already told this about Saul. So when
[29:59] Saul is approached and said, uh, all the
[30:01] desire of Israel is on you and your
[30:02] father's house. and says, "Well, I'm
[30:04] just a Benjamite, smallest tribe, and my
[30:06] family's the least of all the families
[30:07] of the Benjamites." So, the Benjamites
[30:09] are the worst, and we're the worst of
[30:10] the worst.
[30:12] But in verse one, it says, "Now there
[30:13] was a man of Benjamin whose name was
[30:14] Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zor,
[30:17] the son of Basharoth, the son of Apha, a
[30:19] Benjamite, a mighty man of power." The
[30:23] word of God tells us that Kish, Saul
[30:25] being the son of Kish, that Kish was a
[30:27] mighty man of power. And so, he's no
[30:31] small potatoes. And it says, "And he had
[30:33] a son whose name was Saul. A choice
[30:36] young man and a goodly." Isn't that what
[30:38] we all want to be? A goodly.
[30:40] He was a choice young man and a goodly.
[30:43] And there was not among the children of
[30:45] Israel a goodlier person than he. Now,
[30:48] this is the Bible's uh uh just being
[30:50] real about it that Saul was a choice,
[30:53] young man. Goodly. I'm not going to
[30:55] spend much time breaking these words
[30:56] down because I think that it's okay for
[30:58] to let your imagination run wild about
[31:00] what it's saying. There wasn't a
[31:01] goodlier person than he from his
[31:03] shoulders and upward. He was higher than
[31:06] any of the people.
[31:08] All right? He wasn't some short king. He
[31:10] was taller than everybody else
[31:13] by a head.
[31:16] So there wasn't this short man's
[31:17] complex.
[31:19] He's a tall guy. He's the tallest of all
[31:22] the smallest of all the tribes.
[31:24] But despite the reputation of Kish as a
[31:28] mighty man of power and his own great
[31:30] stature and his character as a choice
[31:32] young man and goodly he was insecure
[31:36] still after all this when it comes up
[31:38] he's kind of like well I don't know I'm
[31:40] kind of the tribe of Benjamin if you
[31:42] didn't know and I don't really come from
[31:43] a really good family
[31:46] and if I could just uh put this part in
[31:49] here because if you're struggling at all
[31:51] like where in the world is brother Aaron
[31:53] going with is I've read the story to the
[31:56] end, right? I'm not just picking up the
[31:58] book and say, "Man, I read the first
[32:00] chapter on this guy, Saul. He seems like
[32:02] a real rough neck. This guy's a bad
[32:04] character. I I can read it all over him.
[32:06] He's going to probably end up trying to
[32:07] murder somebody." No, I've read the
[32:09] story, right? So, I have the benefit of
[32:11] hindsight's 2020. Had the benefit of a
[32:13] prophet of God who's taught us on these
[32:15] things to to look on these
[32:16] characteristics of these men. And so it
[32:19] says in 1st Samuel 10:9, "And it was so
[32:22] that when he had turned his back from
[32:23] Samuel, from this moment that they
[32:25] meet," so in the next chapter 10, Samuel
[32:27] begins to tell him all the things that
[32:28] are in his heart, the things that are
[32:29] going to be. And so Saul knows that he's
[32:31] going to be king. And from the moment
[32:33] that he turns away from Samuel, God gave
[32:36] him another heart.
[32:38] And all those signs came to pass that
[32:40] day. Saul began to prophesy. Saul begin
[32:43] to be counted as one of the prophets.
[32:45] But notice, I want you to ponder this.
[32:48] God gave him another heart.
[32:51] Why?
[32:53] You don't find this being said of David.
[32:57] But it says it of Saul that before now
[33:00] that he's going to be anointed, he's
[33:01] going to go forth prophesying and he's
[33:02] going to he's going to be among the
[33:04] people and being looked at and revered,
[33:06] God gives him another heart. Now I want
[33:10] to say this and again I'm trying to say
[33:12] this with force or I say it with force
[33:14] or some sort of sense of uh uh uh
[33:16] shurnness on my part but I want the Lord
[33:18] to speak to in this and I don't want to
[33:20] just say it so absolutely you just
[33:22] accept it but think about this consider
[33:24] this that once he's made king God has to
[33:26] give him another heart. So think about
[33:29] why he's king. Why is he king? Is he
[33:34] king because God told Samuel alone
[33:36] that's what happened is God showed up to
[33:37] Samuel's doorstep one day and spoke in
[33:39] his ear and said make him king
[33:42] or did he do it because the people
[33:44] wanted a king.
[33:45] Amen.
[33:46] It was the people's choice and the
[33:48] people's perception.
[33:50] Right.
[33:50] The people had rejected God when they
[33:53] wanted a king.
[33:54] That's right.
[33:55] Look at this in 1st Samuel chapter 8. Do
[33:57] I have any of those scriptures there? I
[33:59] I had a lot. Yeah. So, I had a lot and
[34:00] I'm just going to I'm going to skip
[34:02] through this. I I want to hurry here. He
[34:04] says, "And and if you look in chapter 8
[34:07] at the beginning, Samuel's sons are uh
[34:11] disobedient. They're ungodly. They're
[34:14] acting in a manner that's not fit for a
[34:15] prophet's sons. They're a reproach to
[34:17] Israel and to the to the office of a
[34:20] prophet. And this is the day of judges."
[34:23] And so Samuel as a prophet is ruling,
[34:25] his sons are are judges. They're going
[34:26] to be ruling. And the people, "Ah, we
[34:28] don't want this." and what they asked
[34:30] for now. And they said unto him, Behold,
[34:32] thou art old, and thy sons walk not in
[34:34] thy ways. This is verse five. Now make
[34:37] us a king to judge us like all the
[34:39] nations.
[34:41] Notice what's at the heart of the
[34:42] people. The people aren't seeing his
[34:44] boys going wayward and like, man, we
[34:46] need rightness. We need uprightness. But
[34:48] they're also looking at the sin of the
[34:50] prophet's sons and they're using it as
[34:52] an excuse to reject the office of a
[34:54] prophet
[34:55] and want to be like the world.
[34:58] Hello.
[34:59] Come on, somebody.
[35:01] Right. That that's when you begin to
[35:03] think about it's exactly what happens in
[35:04] this instance is that they use the
[35:06] excuse of the failure of the family and
[35:08] those closely associ.
[35:11] Let's be like everyone else. Make us a
[35:13] king to judge us like all the nations.
[35:16] And then there there's a lot more to
[35:18] this narrative, but the Lord says to
[35:19] Samuel, "Listen to the people and all
[35:21] that they say to thee. For they have not
[35:23] rejected you, but they have rejected me
[35:24] that I should not reign over them." So
[35:27] when the people wanted a king, they
[35:29] weren't rejecting Samuel. They're
[35:31] rejecting God.
[35:33] The very thing that God spoke to him and
[35:35] said, "I will send a prophet to you."
[35:37] Samuel is the first one in the order of
[35:39] the prophets. When when Moses says that
[35:42] I will send you prophets, Samuel's the
[35:44] first one that God sends and he speaks
[35:46] to him lipto ear just as he did to
[35:49] Moses. The first time we see God raising
[35:50] up a prophet according to Deuteronomy
[35:52] 18. And so in some ways he's the first
[35:54] of the prophets and they're immediately
[35:56] like, "No, this is not what we want."
[35:58] Notice how finicky the people are. God,
[36:00] don't speak to us. Let a prophet speak
[36:03] to us. God, don't let a prophet speak to
[36:06] us. Let a king speak to us on their way
[36:09] to what? No headship.
[36:13] And so God says, "Speak to them." But
[36:15] then when you hearken to their voice,
[36:17] protest solemnly unto them. Because God
[36:19] tells them, "This is what's going to
[36:20] happen." and show them the manner of
[36:22] king that should reign over them. And it
[36:25] says in verse 10, "And Samuel told all
[36:26] the words of the Lord unto the people
[36:28] that asked of him a king." So the people
[36:31] said, "We want a king." And Samuel comes
[36:32] to him and he continues in these these
[36:35] next eight verses, saying, "Well, he's
[36:37] going to do this, and he's going to do
[36:38] this, and he's going to do this." And go
[36:39] through and read it, and you'll find
[36:40] that everything the king asked for is
[36:42] not for the people's sake, but his own.
[36:45] that in some way all the servants and
[36:47] all the tithing and all the soldiers and
[36:50] all the armor in some ways he's saying
[36:51] that though you may have a king to judge
[36:53] you and this king may be able to rally
[36:55] armies and defend you, he's going to ask
[36:57] more of you than I ever did.
[37:00] There's going to be a greater price. And
[37:02] so if you read this in 1st Samuel
[37:03] chapter 8, he spells it all out very
[37:05] very plainly to him. It says,
[37:07] "Nevertheless, the people refused to
[37:08] avoid the basa voice of Samuel and they
[37:11] said, "Nay, but we will have a king over
[37:13] us."
[37:15] And listen to their words, "That we also
[37:17] may be like all the nations, and that
[37:20] our king may judge us and go out before
[37:23] us and fight our battles."
[37:26] Now, I want to put it in this context.
[37:28] God had sent a prophet. God is ruling by
[37:31] that prophet whose none of his words
[37:32] fell to the ground, and he's ruling over
[37:34] them. He's got a good testimony. Did
[37:36] they use the excuse of those associated
[37:38] with him and others around him to tear
[37:40] down his testimony to question him now
[37:42] you're too old and there's this problem
[37:44] and instead of them calling upon God to
[37:46] raise up another prophet to continue
[37:47] ruling them by the word of God they say
[37:50] give us a king Samuel kind of takes that
[37:52] to heart it displeases Samuel and when
[37:54] he goes to the Lord the Lord says Samuel
[37:56] they have not rejected you as a prophet
[37:58] when they reject the leadership of the
[38:00] prophet they're rejecting me
[38:02] and they've asked for a king so when God
[38:04] says go ahead and do what they say but
[38:06] warn them and they choose a king the
[38:09] choice of having a king is not God's
[38:13] choice. So when God chooses the king he
[38:16] wants them to represent their choice.
[38:19] He wants this king that they have asked
[38:21] for to be reflective of who they are.
[38:25] And I believe it's exactly where
[38:26] America's arrived where now no matter
[38:28] who you vote they are died in the wool
[38:31] Americans.
[38:32] They represent America. America's
[38:34] getting what she asked for. And so God
[38:36] gives them a leader who's just like
[38:40] them.
[38:43] So then Saul receives another heart.
[38:48] Why? Because he's he's head and
[38:50] shoulders above everybody else. He's
[38:52] really really good-looking. He's
[38:54] charismatic. He's wellreceived. But he's
[38:57] got a complex.
[38:59] And that's a nasty thing when somebody's
[39:02] in the position he has.
[39:05] So after Saul
[39:07] is told, am I not the least? And why do
[39:10] you speak to me this way? And he tells
[39:12] us about his complex. And I hope I kind
[39:14] of put in some things here to recognize
[39:16] that the people wanted the king and God
[39:18] had to give this king another heart
[39:20] because the king he chose is to teach
[39:21] Israel something about their desire,
[39:23] something about their heart. So in verse
[39:26] 22 of 1st Samuel chapter 9 after Samuel
[39:30] kind of objects and I'm saying
[39:31] foreshadows his insecurity. It says and
[39:32] Samuel took Saul and his servant brought
[39:35] them into the parlor and made them sit
[39:37] in the chiefest place among them that
[39:40] were bidden which were about 30 persons.
[39:43] This is this is quite a ceremony.
[39:46] This has been a banquet that has been
[39:47] called and this prophet has invited
[39:50] people to this and by way of prophecy
[39:53] and foresight and he's made him sit
[39:56] in the chiefest place.
[39:59] He he's in that upper room of the feast
[40:02] in the the chief seats where everyone
[40:04] can see him. And then Samuel said unto
[40:06] the cook, "You remember that uh that
[40:08] pork shoulder that I had you cook and
[40:11] set aside for a special guest? go ahead
[40:13] and bring it.
[40:15] So he took the portion of that which I
[40:17] said they set it by thee. And the cook
[40:20] took up the shoulder. Maybe in more
[40:21] modern parliament we might say a good
[40:23] old Texas Packer brisket.
[40:26] Cook the shoulder to that which was upon
[40:28] it and set it before Saul. So now Saul
[40:32] has got the choice food that has been
[40:34] set aside specifically for him. And he
[40:36] has the portion and this piece and he
[40:39] says, "Behold that which is set be set
[40:41] left. set it before thee and eat for to
[40:44] this time hath it been kept for thee
[40:46] since I said I've invited the people
[40:47] calls a feast this is the great reveal
[40:49] this is the moment these 30 people and
[40:52] now Saul is feasting in the presence of
[40:54] all these invitees and he's eating the
[40:56] choice part in front of everybody made
[40:58] to sit chiefest among all them that were
[41:00] bidden among these 30 people
[41:03] and then it says and when they were come
[41:05] down from the high place into the city
[41:06] Samuel communed with Saul upon the top
[41:09] of the house.
[41:11] Saul is getting some MVP treatment,
[41:14] right?
[41:15] Saul Saul is being catered to. I want
[41:18] you to catch this.
[41:22] Forgive me. Forgive me if I if I am
[41:24] taking some liberty with this, but when
[41:25] I read this, and I want to contrast this
[41:27] later,
[41:29] Saul's ego is being stroked a little
[41:31] bit. Yes.
[41:32] Oh, I'm I'm just the smallest person and
[41:37] I don't really mean much, do I? Right.
[41:40] Looking down at Samuel. I'm just a wee
[41:43] little man.
[41:45] And he takes him and he takes him to the
[41:46] chief seat and and spend the day with me
[41:49] and he's being seen with the prophet and
[41:51] everyone has this fear for him. And all
[41:52] of Israel is communicated with this
[41:54] prophet, the seer. They've asked for a
[41:56] king and now everyone's looking at the
[41:58] the the flight patterns and who's
[41:59] visiting who and what's happening and
[42:01] who's with who. Photographs and the
[42:02] paparazzi are all popping up saying,
[42:04] "Did you see who Samuel was with? This
[42:06] could be the next king." He's like six,
[42:07] whatever.
[42:12] And so
[42:14] Saul
[42:17] is going to be made king. And in 1st
[42:18] Samuel chapter 10, let's read verses 17
[42:21] to 27.
[42:23] And now this is the moment of his
[42:25] coronation as it were. And Samuel called
[42:26] the people together unto the Lord to
[42:28] mispa and said unto the children of
[42:30] Israel, thus sayith the Lord God of
[42:31] Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt
[42:33] and delivered you out of the hand of the
[42:34] Egyptians and out of the hand of all
[42:36] kingdoms and of them that oppressed you.
[42:38] And this is very direct. And you have
[42:40] this day rejected your God, who himself
[42:43] saved you out of all your advers ad
[42:45] adversities and your tribulations. And
[42:47] you have said unto him, nay, but set a
[42:49] king over us. And now therefore present
[42:51] yourselves before the Lord by your
[42:53] tribes and by your thousands.
[42:55] And to me the silence is deafening.
[42:59] It does not record at all that the
[43:01] people said wait what we did what?
[43:05] We've rejected God. That's not what we
[43:07] meant.
[43:08] That is all God please and sackcloth and
[43:10] ashes and repentance. Like okay he's
[43:12] picking up what we were laying down.
[43:14] This is good. All right. Good. He heard
[43:16] our demands. God we've got grievances.
[43:18] He's heard them. He's going to give us
[43:20] what we asked for. But God made it very,
[43:22] very clear. You rejected me. I did all
[43:24] this for you. You rejected me. So
[43:26] present yourselves. And they may have
[43:28] been coming kind of like, we're getting
[43:29] our king. We're getting our king. And
[43:31] when Samuel had caused all the tribes of
[43:33] Israel to come near, the tribe of
[43:34] Benjamin was taken. And when he had
[43:36] caused the tribe of Benjamin to come
[43:37] near by their families, the family of
[43:38] Matri was taken. And Saul, the son of
[43:40] Kish, was taken.
[43:43] And when they sought him, he could not
[43:44] be found.
[43:46] I I like not just exactly sure how long
[43:49] this would take and just exactly how
[43:51] it's represented and how we could see
[43:53] back in the Exodus that uh they came
[43:55] tribe by tribe, family by family and
[43:57] they come man by man to where every
[43:58] household had to answer and give an
[44:00] account. And so in the same manner
[44:02] there's this judging and this narrowing
[44:03] down narrowing down to where they come
[44:04] to this family and it's and they come to
[44:07] the house of Kish and they come to Saul
[44:10] and Samuel knows Saul's the one where is
[44:12] he? Where is he? And it says, "When they
[44:14] saw him, he could not be found.
[44:16] Therefore, they inquired of the Lord
[44:18] further, if the man should yet come
[44:20] thither. And the Lord answered, behold,
[44:23] he hath hid himself among the stuff."
[44:25] And I just love it that they say God
[44:27] said that. He hid himself among the
[44:30] stuff.
[44:32] And they ran and fetched him fence. So
[44:34] they knew exactly what he meant by the
[44:35] stuff.
[44:37] And when he stood among the people, he
[44:40] was higher than any of the people from
[44:41] his shoulders and upward.
[44:44] And Samuel said unto all the people,
[44:45] "See ye him whom the Lord hath chosen
[44:47] that there is none like him among all
[44:49] the people." Do you realize can do you
[44:52] see what's happening?
[44:54] They asked for a king and God said, "You
[44:56] want a king? I'll give you a king."
[44:59] This is exactly what he's going to do.
[45:00] And the people like, "Okay, sounds good.
[45:02] We'll have our king.
[45:04] Going to give us the king we want. We
[45:05] want to be like everybody else. Give us
[45:06] a king." God says, "Okay, if you want to
[45:07] be like everyone else, I'll give you a
[45:09] king who's very kingly. I'll give you a
[45:11] king that even the world would admire.
[45:14] I'll give you a king so that all the
[45:15] nations would be like, "Yep, that's a
[45:17] king." If I've ever seen a king, that's
[45:18] a king. And I'm going to give him the
[45:20] look of a king, but he's not going to
[45:22] have the character of a king.
[45:23] I'm going to give him the look of a
[45:24] king, but he doesn't have a heart of the
[45:25] king. So, I've got to give him a
[45:26] different heart.
[45:27] Right?
[45:28] And so, in this moment, he stands up
[45:30] there and he's head and shoulders above
[45:32] everybody else. And he says, "This is
[45:34] whom the Lord has chosen. There's none
[45:36] like him among all the people." In other
[45:37] words, he's saying this is what you
[45:39] wanted when you wanted a king. You were
[45:41] doing it for popularity. You were doing
[45:43] it for pretense. You were doing it for
[45:44] pride. You were doing it to look good
[45:45] amongst all the other nations and
[45:47] acceptance. And all the people shouted
[45:49] and said, "God saved the king." I
[45:52] thought that's what they did in England.
[45:54] But this is where God saved the king.
[45:58] It's not a mighty Monty Python skit.
[46:00] This is actually what they did. God
[46:03] saved the king
[46:06] after their rebuke after it should be
[46:09] some sort of apparent like I could was
[46:11] there anybody in the audience going
[46:14] okay
[46:14] all right what's going on he's told us
[46:18] we've rejected him now this good-looking
[46:20] seven foot dudes up there he's trolling
[46:22] us right like this is too good to be
[46:24] true this is exactly what we wanted this
[46:27] is who he'd want to be king someone tall
[46:29] somebody fearsome then Samuel told the
[46:31] people the at the manner of the kingdom
[46:33] and wrote it in a book and laid it
[46:34] before the Lord. It says, "And Samuel
[46:37] sent all the people away, every man to
[46:38] his house."
[46:41] Now, you've got enough material to work
[46:43] with to pray about, wrestle it out, but
[46:46] I've got a few more minutes I can use
[46:47] tonight. And look at what it says in
[46:49] verse uh verse um 26. And Saul also went
[46:53] home to Gibia. And there went with him a
[46:56] band of men whose hearts God had
[46:58] touched.
[46:59] I know that in reading this we might
[47:01] want to we could preach a really really
[47:02] good sermon on hearts being touched by
[47:05] God
[47:06] and these men following after Saul
[47:09] but let me let me suggest this that you
[47:11] could pray about God had to touch their
[47:13] hearts for them to follow him
[47:16] and did he do it because of Saul's
[47:17] complex
[47:20] that if Saul would have went home alone
[47:21] something would have been eating at him
[47:24] if he didn't all of a sudden get some
[47:25] followers if he didn't have somebody by
[47:26] his side would this be too much for Saul
[47:28] all. But the children of Balile said,
[47:30] and there's a lot to give context who
[47:32] the children of Bile are, but it's
[47:34] basically suggesting that by their
[47:36] attitudes they're rejected. How shall
[47:38] this man save us? And they despised him
[47:40] and brought him no presence. And guess
[47:42] what? He noticed,
[47:45] but he held his peace.
[47:47] This isn't just there because this
[47:49] chapter needed 27 verses for the
[47:51] numerology to be balanced out.
[47:54] This is given to us. We understand a
[47:55] little bit more about Saul's character.
[47:57] God touched hearts of men to follow him
[47:59] to Gibbia. And those that didn't give
[48:02] him gifts, Saul took note.
[48:04] The people that didn't give him the
[48:06] things that he thought he was do, he's
[48:07] like, I'm noting that.
[48:10] And could it be that had Saul not had a
[48:12] different heart, he would have done
[48:13] something right then and there.
[48:15] Saul has a different heart. So, at least
[48:16] as of now, he's behaving kingly,
[48:19] behaving maturely and reasonable. And I
[48:22] want to point this out as I try to
[48:24] continue to in uh to the the finish line
[48:26] here. We find that he had hid himself
[48:28] among the stuff and the moment where
[48:31] he's to be set before the people and
[48:32] everyone is to acknowledge him. And this
[48:34] is his great moment. His hiding himself
[48:36] was not an act that was purely humility.
[48:40] If I can say this way, it was not pure
[48:41] humility. It was not humility alone, but
[48:43] it was a complex about himself
[48:46] and others.
[48:48] Maybe he had a complex about whether or
[48:50] not he could do it, whether or not he
[48:52] should do it, whether or not he was good
[48:53] enough. He knew he was tall. He knew he
[48:55] was handsome. But maybe he questioned
[48:56] his own abilities. And maybe he was
[48:58] afraid that the people go boo
[49:02] boo.
[49:04] And because of that, he wasn't willing
[49:05] to stand before the people.
[49:09] He was insecure about himself.
[49:12] That's true. But he was really insecure
[49:14] about whether or not the people would
[49:15] accept him.
[49:18] Are you considering this tonight?
[49:20] Think about it in a way that maybe has
[49:21] always been there and you thought about,
[49:23] but this is in Saul's story. His sin is
[49:26] popularity. His temptation's popularity.
[49:28] This pride of life. Why won't Saul
[49:32] come to the platform?
[49:34] He's afraid of being rejected.
[49:37] Saul had eye disease.
[49:39] Did you know that?
[49:44] Capital eye disease.
[49:45] Right.
[49:47] If he could have just thought to
[49:49] himself, "The Lord said,
[49:52] the prophet said I'm king.
[49:55] I'll do what the Lord says. I'll embrace
[49:57] it. This isn't me. This isn't what I
[49:59] want." But um I'm going to run from it.
[50:02] And you know what? It reminds me a lot
[50:03] of times when there's that preacher who
[50:05] really really wants to be a preacher,
[50:07] that pastor that really really wants to
[50:09] pastor, but they know what Brother
[50:10] Brandham said about someone who really
[50:11] wants to do it. So what do they do? Oh
[50:13] well.
[50:14] Well,
[50:16] Well, brother, no, I I don't really want
[50:18] to preach. It's like, okay, no, that's
[50:20] fine. You don't need to. But, um, you
[50:22] know, right? You start backing out of it
[50:24] all. But you know what? You know, God
[50:26] said, and no, no, brother. It's fine.
[50:27] It's fine. You're on duff.
[50:32] But he had eye disease. He had a complex
[50:35] about himself and how people perceived
[50:36] him, whether or not people would accept
[50:38] him. And it's Saul's desire for
[50:40] popularity. I'm winding this down, but I
[50:42] want to give some context so you
[50:43] understand better why I made these
[50:44] conclusions. that Saul's desire for
[50:46] popularity, this craving to be accepted,
[50:49] how he's the way he's perceived was very
[50:52] prominent. His own complexes about
[50:54] himself, God said he was king and he
[50:55] couldn't even overcome his own
[50:56] complexes.
[50:57] Pride.
[50:59] God wanted him to come to the platform
[51:00] and be acknowledged as a prophet. He
[51:02] didn't do it because he was afraid that
[51:03] people would reject him.
[51:05] Whereas, if he had a different heart at
[51:08] its core, he would have said, I if
[51:10] whether I be rejected, whether I be
[51:11] received, I got to obey the Lord. Amen.
[51:13] I got to do what he wants me to do.
[51:16] But it's his desire for popularity, the
[51:18] temptation to popularity that led to his
[51:20] downfall. So very quickly, maybe we'll
[51:22] pick up on more details on these on
[51:24] Sunday, but in 1st Samuel 13:11, first
[51:26] time we see this real transgression in
[51:28] Saul's life. And Samuel said, "What have
[51:31] you done?"
[51:32] And Saul said, "Immediately, because I
[51:35] saw that the people were scattered from
[51:36] me."
[51:38] He asked him what he did. And instead of
[51:40] telling him what he did, he told him why
[51:42] he did it.
[51:44] I saw the people leaving me.
[51:47] Wow.
[51:48] I saw the crowds getting smaller. I saw
[51:52] things happening and that thou camest
[51:54] not within the days appointed. It seemed
[51:56] like you were tearing too long and
[51:58] things were getting more difficult and
[51:59] criticism was coming. And the
[52:01] Philistines gathered themselves together
[52:02] at mishmash. And so I saw that people
[52:05] were leaving and I saw that people were
[52:07] doing this and I saw that people were
[52:08] scared. And because of the threats of an
[52:11] enemy, the criticisms of a defiler and
[52:13] those that are walking away, he changed
[52:15] his gospel,
[52:17] right?
[52:18] And he intruded on the office of a
[52:20] prophet.
[52:21] Didn't wait for the prophet. Didn't wait
[52:23] on the Lord.
[52:25] Because I I saw the people were
[52:26] scattered from me. What was it? Pride of
[52:29] life.
[52:31] Popularity. In 1st Samuel 15:4, it's
[52:33] wherein Samuel goes, "What's this
[52:35] bleeding of rams I hear?
[52:38] I'm leaving a lot out, but catch this.
[52:39] And Saul said unto Samuel, because this
[52:42] is after Samuel calls him out. He says,
[52:44] I've sinned. We're like, okay, he's
[52:46] doing better, right? Before he said, I
[52:48] was afraid the people were leaving me.
[52:50] I've sinned for I have transgressed the
[52:53] commandment of the Lord and thy words.
[52:55] Now, it sounds like he's doing good, but
[52:56] then he falls back on the usual because
[52:58] I feared the people and obeyed their
[53:00] voice.
[53:01] We says the people wanted to offer
[53:03] sacrifices. The people wanted to worship
[53:06] this way. The people want the people
[53:08] want the people. The people the people.
[53:14] Saul may have been too woke to be king.
[53:19] I feared the people and obeyed their
[53:21] voice.
[53:23] And notice in chapter 13, if we're kind
[53:25] of going back and forth and back and
[53:27] forth, notice it says this. After he
[53:28] first does this transgression, "What
[53:31] have you done?" He says, "Because the
[53:32] people were scattered from me and and
[53:35] you hadn't come yet and the Philistines
[53:37] were gathering. The people were afraid.
[53:39] Everyone was troubled. People were
[53:40] leaving. And I wanted to do something to
[53:42] rally the people together." And I stood
[53:43] up before the people and I did this. And
[53:44] notice exactly what Samuel says in verse
[53:47] 14. But now thy kingdom shall not
[53:49] continue. Your families hold upon the
[53:53] throne will end. The Lord hath sought
[53:55] him a man after his own heart.
[53:58] And the Lord hath commanded him to be
[54:00] captain over his people because that
[54:02] thou hast not kept that which the Lord
[54:04] commanded thee. When we find him in
[54:06] chapter 15, why is he not keeping the
[54:08] commandments of the Lord? He fears the
[54:09] people
[54:10] and so he obeys their voice.
[54:12] Popularity.
[54:14] How he's perceived as king. He was
[54:16] constantly on Twitter. He was constantly
[54:19] following the polls. He was always
[54:21] getting the feedback. He was reading the
[54:22] op-eds. He was wanting to think, "How do
[54:24] people think of me? How do they view me?
[54:25] How do they feel about me? What's the
[54:26] polls? What's the What are you getting?
[54:28] What are you hearing? Well, it sounds
[54:29] like everybody's leaving you. Why?
[54:31] Because you haven't because Samuel
[54:32] hasn't showed up yet. It's making you
[54:34] look kind of bad. You might want to do
[54:35] something about it.
[54:36] Oh, the people are kind of upset that
[54:38] they're having to kill everything and
[54:39] they can't keep some rams. They can't do
[54:40] this. What if you did it and said they
[54:42] need to worship and you do this and you
[54:44] do that and there's all sorts of talk
[54:45] about how they could uh uh how he could
[54:48] politically handle this in a way to
[54:49] where he obeys God cuz he claimed he did
[54:53] but win the favor of the people. Right?
[54:56] And this is where sin, popularity
[54:58] usually leads to sin and disgrace
[55:02] because when it begins to be this rub
[55:04] where you're willing to please men and
[55:06] you love the praise of men more than you
[55:07] love the praise of God,
[55:09] right?
[55:10] Is God not able himself to provide a
[55:12] sacrifice?
[55:13] Amen.
[55:14] Is God not able to see what's in the
[55:16] hearts of the people and himself provide
[55:18] a sacrifice? Even if it's not just a ram
[55:21] caught in a thicket, but if it's a ram
[55:22] for a house, is he not able to provide?
[55:25] But yet using the excuse of religion,
[55:27] which we can get into more on Sunday, he
[55:29] allow they put pressure on Saul.
[55:33] And it says, "The Lord hath sought him a
[55:36] man after his own heart because you
[55:38] couldn't keep God's commandments."
[55:41] Why could Saul not keep the commandments
[55:43] of God? What was in his heart?
[55:46] the pride of life and this temptation to
[55:49] popularity.
[55:50] Who is it that's going to take his
[55:52] place? It's not Jonathan
[55:55] who scripturally is a great man.
[55:58] It's not going to Jonathan. It's not
[56:00] going to his house. It's going to be a
[56:01] man after God's own heart.
[56:05] So once again, in just a few chapters,
[56:07] in chapter 8, they ask for a king. In
[56:09] chapter nine, saw Samuel seeing who he
[56:11] who this king's going to be. Already in
[56:13] chapter 16,
[56:16] God is bringing Samuel to another house.
[56:19] And if you remember, Samuel's story is
[56:22] really, really dramatic, right? Lost
[56:25] livestock. He's on his search for three
[56:26] days. And prophecy here. Maidens are
[56:29] saying, "You go see the prophet." And
[56:30] and all these things working. The
[56:32] prophet's made a huge dinner. They're
[56:33] cooking brisket. 30 guests are coming.
[56:35] They're going to the high place.
[56:36] Everything. This is getting the choice
[56:38] things, right? They got the reservations
[56:40] already. They got the the celebrity chef
[56:42] cooking. Everything's going just right.
[56:44] And finally, the great moment when Saul
[56:46] meets the tallest or Samuel meets the
[56:48] tallest man in all of Israel, the
[56:50] prophet and and Saul. And he's like,
[56:53] "All desire of Israel is upon you." And
[56:56] he's thinking, "Oh, well,
[56:59] little old me coming from a really bad
[57:03] family and really small tribe.
[57:05] Why? Why would they be after me?" He
[57:08] says, "Come, let me tell And he takes
[57:10] him to this high place. He ch has the
[57:12] chief seed and he begins to prophesy. He
[57:14] he he takes him there and he lets him
[57:15] eat and then he comes down to the high
[57:17] place. He carries with him all night and
[57:18] then he begins to tell him, "You're
[57:19] going to be king and this is going to
[57:20] happen. You're going to prophesy and
[57:21] signs and wonders are going to follow
[57:22] you." Go ahead and read what he says in
[57:24] chapter 10 and gives him a new heart.
[57:27] That happens. And he prophesies and
[57:29] everything he says comes to pass. And
[57:31] the people are is is Saul one of the
[57:32] prophets now? Is he one of the seers?
[57:35] That's the coronation of Saul. And in
[57:38] before all the people of Israel, he's
[57:40] supposed to come forth and we find him
[57:42] hiding. I'm suggesting that that he hid
[57:45] because of pride, not because of
[57:46] humility.
[57:47] But yet, there was something about that,
[57:51] something about that moment
[57:54] that had it not had it just been that he
[57:57] was small in his own eyes, God could
[57:59] have used it.
[58:00] Right?
[58:01] if that was all that it was.
[58:05] But now the prophet Samuel comes to the
[58:08] house of Jesse and he's told to go
[58:10] there. And I think in some ways he's
[58:12] thinking, I've seen God do this before.
[58:15] Had a pretty good idea which way it
[58:16] would go. For it came to pass when they
[58:18] were come that he looked upon Elab and
[58:21] said, "Surely the Lord's anointed is
[58:24] before thee." Why? He looked good. He
[58:27] was good. He He was a goodly, right? and
[58:30] he was tall. He says, "This is it. This
[58:33] is the king." But the Lord said unto
[58:34] Samuel, "Look not on his countenance or
[58:36] on the height of his stature, because
[58:38] I've refused him. For the Lord seeth not
[58:41] as man seeth,
[58:42] for man lookth on the outward
[58:43] appearance, but the Lord lookketh on the
[58:46] heart."
[58:48] Saul was an example of what power apart
[58:50] from character can do. Saul was an
[58:53] example of what pride will do and
[58:55] pretense will do and a lust for
[58:56] popularity will do when one begins to be
[58:58] driven by whether or not the people
[59:00] accepted him. I would suggest that Saul
[59:02] had this problem in his heart and it
[59:04] would have manifested in some way in
[59:06] business, not just as a king, but it
[59:08] would have manifested in his life
[59:09] anyways.
[59:10] If he was the one that was to take over
[59:12] his father's business, he would have
[59:14] been looking at all the other cousins,
[59:15] the little brothers. He would have been
[59:16] the one that was worried about how his
[59:19] dad perceived him, about how the
[59:20] businessmen were seeing him, about
[59:21] whether or not he was fitting in in this
[59:23] tribe
[59:24] because it because it was at the core of
[59:26] who he was.
[59:28] The Lord was looking for a man after the
[59:30] Lord's heart. Saul was somebody that God
[59:33] had to give a different heart just to be
[59:35] king long enough.
[59:36] Amen.
[59:37] And God says, "I look on the heart." And
[59:40] so in verse 12, he goes to the whole
[59:42] family and Samuel's like, "Okay, is
[59:45] there anybody else?" Because God's they
[59:47] go, "Oh yeah, the youngest."
[59:50] He's out tending sheep. This is such an
[59:52] anticlimatic coronation. Like we could
[59:55] make a movie off of Saul's coration,
[59:57] right? With David, it's just like, "Give
[1:00:00] me some YouTube ads."
[1:00:02] Like, "This is boring."
[1:00:05] Like, "No." Next. Samuel's just swiping.
[1:00:08] I don't know which way you swipe to
[1:00:09] reject. So, it's like he's just swiping,
[1:00:11] right? Nope. Next. Next. And finally
[1:00:13] like, is there anybody else? It's
[1:00:16] getting late in the day. Everybody's
[1:00:17] tired. Yeah. We got this little guy out
[1:00:19] there. He's uh tending to the sheep.
[1:00:21] Well, bring him. And he comes and it
[1:00:25] says he was ruddy and with all of a
[1:00:26] beautiful countenance and goodly to look
[1:00:28] to. So, I mean, he's not complete
[1:00:31] rubbish, but he's ruddy and he's got a
[1:00:33] beautiful countenance. And so, maybe
[1:00:35] it's just a little bit softer, a little
[1:00:36] bit more fair. where Saul might have had
[1:00:38] the nice cheekbones, you know, tall,
[1:00:40] broad shoulders, dark hair, you know,
[1:00:42] tall guy. And David's cute, you know,
[1:00:44] he's like, "He's a cute kid. Come over
[1:00:45] here and pinch his cheek." Samuel just
[1:00:47] wanted to rub him on the head. Come
[1:00:48] here. Come here. Go.
[1:00:52] And he says,
[1:00:54] "And the Lord said, arise, anoint him,
[1:00:57] for this is he."
[1:00:58] Amen.
[1:00:59] I know just at home, no special guest,
[1:01:03] no special brisket, kosher, of course.
[1:01:05] Then Samuel took the horn of oil and
[1:01:07] anointed him in the midst of his
[1:01:08] brethren. And the spirit of the Lord
[1:01:09] came upon David from that day forward.
[1:01:12] He didn't give David a new heart. Didn't
[1:01:15] give him another heart is what it says
[1:01:16] about Saul. Gave him another heart. In
[1:01:19] other words, he kind of had to
[1:01:20] manipulate Saul's spirit. He hardened
[1:01:22] the heart of Pharaoh. So what does he
[1:01:24] do? Kind of softens the heart of Saul
[1:01:26] long enough to make an example.
[1:01:29] Long enough to teach us something in the
[1:01:31] scripture. And he does something with
[1:01:33] David. Now, on Sunday, maybe we could
[1:01:35] make quick references to this, and I
[1:01:36] don't want to get caught up in the
[1:01:37] comparisons so much of a David and a
[1:01:39] Saul because we're learning from Saul
[1:01:40] about the pride of life and popularity.
[1:01:42] But with David, David makes terrible
[1:01:44] mistakes.
[1:01:45] And in many ways, mistakes that we could
[1:01:47] say are greater than Saul's. Saul's are
[1:01:50] very particular, very specific. But the
[1:01:52] problem is at the heart of it is a heart
[1:01:55] problem.
[1:01:56] Whereas David may have seemed to fail on
[1:01:58] a greater stage in worse ways, David had
[1:02:01] a heart that was willing to repent.
[1:02:04] And Saul had a heart to say,
[1:02:07] "I I I was afraid of the people.
[1:02:10] I was worried about how they perceived
[1:02:12] me. I I was worried that the people
[1:02:13] would panic and we wouldn't defeat the
[1:02:15] Philistines."
[1:02:17] But the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[1:02:18] David from that moment forward and
[1:02:22] doesn't get another heart. But notice
[1:02:23] immediately what happens in verse 14.
[1:02:25] But the spirit of the Lord departed from
[1:02:26] Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord
[1:02:29] troubled him.
[1:02:32] It was a difference of heart,
[1:02:34] right?
[1:02:35] I'd like to say it this way. It's a
[1:02:36] difference of soul.
[1:02:39] There was something about at the heart
[1:02:40] of David
[1:02:42] that God was pleased with that heart.
[1:02:45] God loved it despite all the other
[1:02:48] optics, despite all the failures,
[1:02:49] despart despite David having different
[1:02:52] uh uh tendencies and different ways and
[1:02:56] being a a man of unfaithfulness and a
[1:02:59] murderer. And David's life is just it's
[1:03:01] a complicated tale. But you know in
[1:03:03] David, he represents the Messiah. It's
[1:03:06] going to be a son of David that ascended
[1:03:08] to the throne. It's going to be the root
[1:03:09] of Jesse.
[1:03:10] And God saved it secondly. Not Saul the
[1:03:14] first choice, not the flesh the first
[1:03:15] birth, but he was saving it for David.
[1:03:18] David who had a heart after God. That is
[1:03:21] what we get when we receive the baptism
[1:03:23] of the Holy Ghost. The soul becomes born
[1:03:24] again and new. It's a soul after God
[1:03:26] like God.
[1:03:29] And it's because Saul didn't have the
[1:03:31] right kind of heart. When the spirit of
[1:03:32] the Lord departs from Saul, what is Saul
[1:03:34] left with? His character.
[1:03:37] He's left with who he really is at the
[1:03:38] end of the day.
[1:03:40] And he manifested in his life. And in
[1:03:43] the next chapters, he's showing the
[1:03:45] insanity of a man who's left to the grip
[1:03:49] of the pride of life,
[1:03:52] who's so taken with the limelight and
[1:03:54] the platform
[1:03:56] that he fears ever losing it
[1:03:58] and will murder
[1:04:00] to keep it.
[1:04:06] It's quite a story
[1:04:09] that I think we should all learn from.
[1:04:12] Has he not made usth bo both made us
[1:04:15] kings and priests?
[1:04:18] And while we yet live here in this
[1:04:20] flesh, you're subject to temptation
[1:04:25] in body and mind.
[1:04:28] And I'll say this and and I've already
[1:04:30] been preparing for Sunday morning, but
[1:04:33] it's the pride of life is the most
[1:04:35] outstanding characteristic of an unborn
[1:04:37] again soul.
[1:04:40] Therefore, we must be born again.
[1:04:42] We must be born again because it's our
[1:04:44] only source of victory over
[1:04:48] the big three.
[1:04:50] If we could stand together and musicians
[1:04:52] coming to your instruments.
