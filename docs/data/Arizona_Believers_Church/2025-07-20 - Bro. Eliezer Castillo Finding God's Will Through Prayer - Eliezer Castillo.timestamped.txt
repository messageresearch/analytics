[0:01] And this is um of course the scene where
[0:04] Jesus goes to the garden of Gethsemane.
[0:08] He knows what's going to take place. Um
[0:11] of course his disciples, I'm sure
[0:13] they're very nervous and they know what
[0:15] that there's some kind of impending doom
[0:18] going going on. And um brother Brandham
[0:22] says that this was the greatest decision
[0:23] that Jesus had to make. And it says,
[0:27] "And he went a little further and fell
[0:29] on his face and prayed, saying, Oh my
[0:32] father, if it be possible, let this cup
[0:35] pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I
[0:38] will, but thou wilt." You may be seated.
[0:42] What a um
[0:45] beautiful surrender that Jesus gave to
[0:48] to God. Um there there's a there's a lot
[0:51] of quotes that brother Bham speaks on
[0:54] this and and he gives a good
[0:56] illustration and paints a picture of of
[0:58] what was going on and not only just
[1:00] physically that or the things that we
[1:02] have read but he said that spiritually
[1:04] there was things going on around him
[1:07] here in in communion in in 1957. He says
[1:11] that Jesus was confronting the greatest
[1:13] test that he ever had. Gethsemane laid
[1:16] before him and where at once all uh
[1:20] final and all sufficient test must come
[1:23] when the burdens of the entire world
[1:25] laid upon his blessed shoulder. There
[1:28] was no one in heaven in all of heavens
[1:31] or in earth could ever uh stood it but
[1:34] him. So I I I honestly believe that
[1:37] there's things that we go through that
[1:39] no one can ever stand but us. There's
[1:42] decisions that we have to make in our
[1:44] lives that only we can make that
[1:46] decision.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; So God laid this burden on him. No one
[1:51] could ever stand it but him. And to know
[1:54] all of the sins of past sins and present
[1:57] sins and future sins rested upon this
[2:01] decision. So he had a decision to make.
[2:04] First of all, you want you have to
[2:06] understand that God gave him the free
[2:09] will to make a decision. God didn't
[2:11] arrest him to the burden of the cross.
[2:14] God didn't make him do it. He had the
[2:17] same exact decision that we make today.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; It was one of the most uh greatest
[2:25] victories that Christ ever won or proved
[2:29] his messiahship. And when he said to
[2:32] God, "Not my will, thine be done." That
[2:36] was the greatest victory he had ever
[2:38] won. all demons of torment uh was around
[2:42] him to tempt him and to try him. So here
[2:46] he says that every single demon and
[2:49] devil was there because this was the
[2:52] opening. This was the time where where a
[2:55] sh a shift was going to happen
[2:58] &gt;&gt; and and every single devil was there to
[3:00] triumph. But in another uh scripture or
[3:03] another quote, brother Benham says in
[3:05] conferences where he says even Michael
[3:08] and Gabriel were there sitting there
[3:10] while he was there on that rock. Every
[3:12] angel stood and every single thing was
[3:15] just looking at him waiting to see what
[3:18] decision he was going to make.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Now whenever he made his decision didn't
[3:22] say okay I'm going to go or but what he
[3:25] did was Lord not my will.
[3:28] That was the greatest thing that Jesus
[3:31] could ever do.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say, "You know what? I'm
[3:34] going to make my own decision. I'm going
[3:36] to take my free will and do what I can."
[3:38] But he said, "Lord, not my will."
[3:42] &gt;&gt; And honestly, Jesus didn't have to pray.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't. He just could have just went
[3:46] to it. But he went and brother Brandham
[3:49] says it was a conference between the
[3:51] dove and the lamb. and he went and he
[3:52] began to to commune with God and say,
[3:56] "I'm having an issue here. I'm having an
[3:59] issue with my flesh, but Lord, whether
[4:02] my flesh wants to go or whether it
[4:04] doesn't, it's not my will. I submit it
[4:07] to you.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; I that's the greatest thing that a
[4:10] Christian can do is is finding the will
[4:14] of God."
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. in prayer
[4:18] that that everywhere we go, we are in
[4:21] prayer. Lord, not my will but yours.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Because the greatest gift or one of the
[4:27] greatest gifts that God ever gave to man
[4:29] and and woman was free will.
[4:33] That's that's the thing that has made
[4:36] contentions throughout the whole world
[4:39] all through time
[4:40] &gt;&gt; because we see evil here and evil there
[4:43] and things going on and and we want to
[4:46] point to blame but God gave us the ball.
[4:49] God gave us the authority to say Lord
[4:53] what am I going to do?
[4:55] &gt;&gt; And so he gave us that authority to make
[4:58] whatever life we want to do. Whatever
[5:01] life you want, it's up to you.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Whether you want to be a Christian or
[5:05] you don't want to be a Christian, that's
[5:07] up to you.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; Whe you know, of course, young young
[5:11] people whenever they have to go to
[5:12] church, they're dragged to church. Yes.
[5:14] But one day you're going to make that
[5:16] decision.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; But when you realize that there is a
[5:20] reality that there is a God that is is
[5:22] waiting on your decision, you submit it
[5:25] to God and then he takes over the rest.
[5:28] Amen.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Um I I think that's the greatest thing
[5:30] and and you know I
[5:33] um found a lot of inspiration on the
[5:34] last time I spoke. I spoke on from the
[5:36] heart to the home and and
[5:39] speaking on uh I I drew from this uh
[5:42] scripture in John 17:20 where Jesus was
[5:46] praying his prayer and and he says that
[5:49] I pray for thee not these alone but for
[5:51] them also which believe on me that and
[5:54] then he begins to expound how he want
[5:57] them and them in him and and him in God
[6:00] and and he wanted something that that is
[6:03] a heartfelt religion. He wanted
[6:06] something from the heart. He wanted a
[6:07] communion with the people and not just,
[6:10] you know, we could go to church the all
[6:12] of our lives, but if there is not a a I
[6:15] and you and you and me, there is no
[6:17] connection with God.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; There there has to be a spiritual
[6:21] connection with God. And so I I was
[6:25] thinking about that how how everything
[6:27] flowed out of God, you know, everything
[6:29] that was created, everything that was
[6:31] good, it came out of his heart. And it's
[6:33] it's a great example of how we are known
[6:37] by our own fruits. So everything that we
[6:40] live, everything that we do, whether
[6:42] it's home life or where whether we're
[6:44] we're at school or work, we are
[6:47] projecting what's already in our heart.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; We are creating atmospheres and we are
[6:52] doing those things whatever is in our
[6:55] heart right now. Yes.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; And and I I I think as a Christian, what
[7:01] needs to happen is this communion with
[7:04] God.
[7:06] This communion. And a lot of times when
[7:07] we think about prayer, we think about it
[7:10] as a duty. And you know what? Let's pray
[7:12] for our food and let's pray to when we
[7:14] wake up and we go to sleep and and it
[7:16] becomes this monotonous duty. But it is
[7:19] a constant communication with God. I
[7:23] think um if you start thinking about
[7:25] Jesus's life now this is a very simple
[7:28] um topic but I I think is a very needful
[7:30] one even for my life but um even going
[7:34] into Jesus's life
[7:37] see that that the first time he appears
[7:39] on the scene he's praying before getting
[7:41] baptized while he's getting baptized the
[7:45] last time he leaves the scene on the
[7:47] cross of course physically as a a mortal
[7:50] he's praying to the Father, uh, Aba,
[7:54] Father, why have you forsaken me? So, so
[7:57] he's he's crying out to the Lord every
[8:00] step of the way. Even even to uh in
[8:04] every single uh great event, he prayed
[8:09] when he went to the Mount
[8:10] Transfiguration. He prayed before
[8:13] whenever the uh he began to feed the
[8:15] 5,000 people. He prayed whenever he
[8:18] walked on the water. He went out to the
[8:20] mountain and he prayed first. So there
[8:23] is this pattern of Jesus Christ always
[8:26] praying, always in constant prayer. In
[8:31] Luke 11:1,
[8:33] um here the disciples ask him a
[8:36] question. It says, "And it came to pass
[8:39] that
[8:42] as he was praying in a certain place and
[8:44] when he ceased, one of his disciples
[8:46] said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray."
[8:50] And John also taught his disciples. So
[8:54] they asked him this question. And if you
[8:55] would like to turn with me to Matthew
[8:59] uh 6:es 5-13
[9:02] here, they both uh are in correlation
[9:05] with one another. But here in Matthew,
[9:08] um, we see the background of why these
[9:10] people wanted to ask Jesus, "Lord, how
[9:12] how do we pray? Teach me how to pray."
[9:15] You know, I I just had a a buddy at at
[9:18] at work ask like, "Well, what do I do?
[9:21] How do I pray?" And it reminded me of
[9:23] Brother Brandon whenever he had to write
[9:25] on a piece of paper because he didn't
[9:26] know how to talk to God. I think what he
[9:29] told me was he started looking at
[9:30] YouTube channels to see how to pray. But
[9:34] it's just like talking to a friend.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; It it it's when you begin to understand
[9:40] that there is an ear listening to your
[9:43] prayer,
[9:44] &gt;&gt; watching you, waiting for you to say
[9:46] something to him, then it begins to be
[9:49] real easy to begin to commune with the
[9:51] Lord.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; So Matthew 6 5-13 it says, "And when
[9:57] thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the
[9:59] hypocrite are." hypocrites are. For they
[10:02] love to pray standing in synagogues and
[10:05] in corners of the streets, that they may
[10:07] be seen of men. Verily, I say unto you,
[10:10] they have their reward. But when thou uh
[10:13] but thou when thou prayest, enter into
[10:16] thy closet, and when thou has shut the
[10:19] door, pray to thy father which is in
[10:22] secret.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; And thy father which seen thee in secret
[10:27] shall reward thee openly. Amen.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; But when ye pray, use not vain
[10:32] repetitions as the heathen do, for they
[10:34] think that they shall be heard um for
[10:38] their much speaking.
[10:40] Be uh be not therefore like unto them,
[10:44] for your father knoweth what things ye
[10:46] have need of before ye ask them.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; So this is not a thing where God's like,
[10:52] well, if there's no communication, how
[10:54] do I know? No, God already knows. But
[10:57] God has a formula.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; God God has agents on earth.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; God works through agents and that's us.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; He needs men on the ground, women on the
[11:10] ground.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; So it says
[11:15] and and then verse n he says after this
[11:17] manner therefore you pray. Now um I've
[11:20] heard this many times. I don't know if
[11:22] brother Brandham said it but he said but
[11:24] I I like how he says he didn't say pray
[11:26] this prayer pray like this.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; So you know that's how Catholicism they
[11:31] want to pray prayers and chant prayers
[11:33] but Jesus is saying pray like this not
[11:36] pray this prayer.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; He's saying pray therefore um or after
[11:41] this manner therefore pray ye. Our
[11:44] father which art in heaven hallowed be
[11:46] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[11:48] done on earth as it is in heaven. Give
[11:50] us this day our daily bread. And forgive
[11:52] us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[11:55] And lead us not into temptation, but
[11:57] deliver us from evil. For thine is the
[12:00] kingdom and the power and the glory
[12:02] forever. Amen. I think that's one of the
[12:05] greatest things that Jesus ever taught
[12:07] us was how to commune with God himself.
[12:12] Now, to think that that Jesus is the
[12:15] greatest human being to touch the earth,
[12:18] that everything everything he did was a
[12:21] miracle,
[12:22] &gt;&gt; that that he walked on water, he raised
[12:25] the dead, he he spoke life, and he spoke
[12:28] death.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; He he was he was the greatest person.
[12:32] And and I don't know if you know a
[12:35] natural person that would be walking
[12:37] around with him as they were following
[12:39] him, they could ask the Lord, "How do
[12:41] you do that? Teach us how to do that.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Teach us how to be like you. Teach us
[12:47] how to walk on water. Teach us how to
[12:49] how to uh cast out devils.
[12:52] Maybe somebody could have done it." And
[12:53] and it kind of reminds me of when
[12:55] Brother Brandham came on the scene, many
[12:58] people began to ask him the wrong
[13:00] question.
[13:02] They didn't ask him, "L how do we you
[13:04] become consecrated with the Lord? How do
[13:07] you get this connection? Teach us how to
[13:10] do that." No. Just like Tommy Osborne
[13:13] and all these people. Brother Brandham
[13:14] once said that he was running around the
[13:16] car all nervous and says, "Do you think
[13:18] I've got a gift of healing?"
[13:20] &gt;&gt; What? He saw Brother Brandham face that
[13:24] maniac in front of him. He was there and
[13:28] he saw whenever he just spoke the word
[13:30] in love and and how the devil crumbled.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; And and and when people saw that, they
[13:37] wanted that same thing.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says that that um
[13:43] he says, "Look, Tommy, after this
[13:44] revival starting like this, there'll be
[13:46] so many divine healers in the land." I
[13:49] said, "It'll be pitiful. It'll be so um
[13:53] the people won't even won't even have a
[13:56] meeting unless they've got divine
[13:58] healing.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; What do they do? They they begin to
[14:01] major on a minor.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; They begin to see all the miracles and
[14:05] that's what they wanted to copy. That's
[14:07] what they wanted.
[14:09] The disciples, they they were wise. They
[14:13] asked Jesus the important question.
[14:16] Lord, teach us how to pray.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm sure they've asked him a lot.
[14:20] They there was a lot of questions about
[14:22] a lot of things but explicitly they
[14:25] asked him Lord teach us how to pray.
[14:32] They they saw him. They saw him pray.
[14:36] In the Bible, the the Bible says in two
[14:39] scriptures where it says that in the
[14:41] morning before everybody was would wake
[14:43] up in the dawn, Jesus would schedule a
[14:46] time to go out and pray.
[14:48] Before the morning even started,
[14:51] before people were going up, Jesus was
[14:54] there praying.
[14:56] Many times you see in the Bible where he
[14:58] went in a solitary place. He went out in
[15:01] the wilderness. He went by himself and
[15:03] he prayed.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; When the sun came up, he would tell his
[15:08] disciples, "Let's go down to town. Let's
[15:10] go downtown." Now, after his prayer,
[15:14] see, he wouldn't go and do his thing. He
[15:16] after his prayer, then he was ready.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's go downtown." And there,
[15:22] that's when miracles would happen.
[15:25] That's when he would speak and things
[15:26] would happen. The blind would see and
[15:28] and and everything would happen. Why?
[15:31] because he was a man connected to God.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure the disciples, they they
[15:37] understood something from that. I I once
[15:40] heard a preacher say that that when you
[15:42] spend hours with God in prayer, you'll
[15:45] spend seconds with men.
[15:48] When you say spend hours in prayer with
[15:50] God, then that issue that we have, it
[15:53] should not be a big issue. But a lot of
[15:56] times we're screaming and yelling at at
[15:59] at this issue to go away, but we never
[16:02] have a connection with our Lord and
[16:04] Savior.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; There there has to be a connection with
[16:08] God. There has to be a Lord, what's your
[16:11] will?
[16:13] &gt;&gt; What's your will in my life? And a lot
[16:15] of times, I think the one of the biggest
[16:18] problems today is people don't want to
[16:21] let go of their own will.
[16:24] It's it's a I I've got it. I've got it
[16:28] all under control kind of world today.
[16:31] Everybody wants the control.
[16:34] Everybody wants a control of their
[16:36] lives.
[16:37] And whenever the hardest thing to do is
[16:41] to surrender to the Lord
[16:43] &gt;&gt; or in in general to surrender to
[16:46] anybody,
[16:47] &gt;&gt; a lot of times it's built on pride.
[16:51] a man, you know, a man's got it. A man,
[16:54] you know, I'm the man of the house. I
[16:56] I've got this. And and we begin to
[16:58] create this thing where it's like, no,
[17:00] nobody needs to help me. And it
[17:02] sometimes is hard just to ask for help.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; And now we see it in in the other way
[17:07] where where women want the control in in
[17:09] the nation and all of these things.
[17:11] Everybody wants control.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; They not only want to control their
[17:16] lives, but they want to control others.
[17:19] and to be a sheep,
[17:21] to be meek,
[17:24] to lose the control.
[17:26] Man, you don't want that. That's not the
[17:29] American way.
[17:31] That's not that's not how we're we're
[17:34] built and taught.
[17:37] Jesus says, "Not my will."
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus go.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus let go of all of his thoughts, all
[17:46] of his ideas.
[17:48] Maybe he had really good ideas. Maybe he
[17:50] had really good thoughts, but he had to
[17:51] let them go
[17:53] &gt;&gt; in order for God's will to take place.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; That's where we have to be.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, let it be your will.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; And the only way God's will can work in
[18:06] our lives is when we get down in prayer
[18:10] and we begin to commune with the Lord.
[18:14] Not to get ahead of my message, but but
[18:16] that's where God's sovereignty lies,
[18:20] &gt;&gt; people um unbelievers in the world.
[18:23] That's a big problem for people. How
[18:26] somebody can say, "Man, God's will was
[18:28] in my life." You know, you know, us
[18:30] Americans when we say, "God was with us
[18:33] and he blessed us." And yet people in
[18:36] Syria and Africa, they're they're
[18:38] starving. They're dying. People
[18:41] Christians are are getting killed.
[18:44] and and a person can sit there and say,
[18:47] "How can God bless you here, but he
[18:49] can't touch those people over there?"
[18:52] And and and many believe or unbelievers,
[18:54] they have quarrel against those things.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Well, how can God's sovereignty be on of
[19:00] one person and not the other? I think a
[19:04] lot God's sovereignty lies in the
[19:07] prayers of saints. Amen.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; God's sovereignty lies with his children
[19:13] because God, he licensed licensed us to
[19:16] be his hands and feet.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; God, he can't move until we speak.
[19:23] God, he can't do something in your life
[19:25] until you begin to cry out to him.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; And when we begin to cry out, we'll see
[19:31] the move of God in our lives. whether
[19:34] people might see it on another uh
[19:36] perspective and say, "Man, that doesn't
[19:38] look good." But you can say, "All things
[19:40] work for good
[19:42] &gt;&gt; cuz I love the Lord.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz I've been called."
[19:46] But what is it? It's that connection.
[19:49] Jesus, he gave that definition of being
[19:52] prayed up.
[19:54] You know, every time he encountered
[19:57] something, every time he went through
[19:59] something, he was prayed up. He prayed
[20:02] in a in in a solitary place. He prayed
[20:05] in the morning. He prayed. And whenever
[20:08] he was encountered by those things, he
[20:11] was ready.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; A lot of times when we're encountered by
[20:14] those things, we're we're praying right
[20:16] then and there.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; We're trying to catch up on our
[20:19] &gt;&gt; prayer that we forgot last week.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; But remember, prayer is our lifeline.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; It's not a duty. It's not a ritual. It's
[20:28] not something that we're supposed to do
[20:29] amongst men and all of those things.
[20:31] It's a connection, a lifeline between us
[20:34] and God.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; It's a communion. Communication is key
[20:38] in any relationship.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; How much more God
[20:43] &gt;&gt; whenever we go and we pray and we get to
[20:46] know who this God is,
[20:49] &gt;&gt; how good he is,
[20:51] how how something can change from from
[20:54] death unto life.
[20:56] I'm sure many of us, we can testify how
[20:59] how death was in a body and prayer
[21:02] changed the situation.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; How somebody was was destined for hell
[21:07] and prayer changed the situation.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; It's not us. It's God saying, "All
[21:13] right, you made the connection.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; You've you've made it through your
[21:17] faith.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; This is a learned activity. This is not
[21:23] something that comes whenever we become
[21:26] Christians
[21:27] &gt;&gt; and saying, "Oh yeah, you know what?
[21:28] This is part of the package." No, this
[21:30] is a learned activity.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Just like I said, brother Brandham, he
[21:34] had to write to the Lord first
[21:36] and he realized, "Okay, this is not
[21:38] working." And it got to the point where
[21:41] he got so desperate where he said,
[21:43] "Lord, I need you so much
[21:46] there in that old shack." He began to
[21:49] cry out to the Lord until he saw him
[21:51] physically and he received what he
[21:54] needed.
[21:57] I think um it's more than just uh
[22:01] just small talk. I I think it's a
[22:04] consecration.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; I think that's the key to to uh fruitful
[22:10] life as a Christian is a consecrated
[22:13] life. I I honestly I I can say I need
[22:16] more of that. Because because the thing
[22:19] is it's so easy to live in this flesh.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to get caught up in work.
[22:25] It's so easy to just get busy with
[22:28] everything
[22:29] &gt;&gt; and forget that the reality is a
[22:32] connection with the unseen God.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; That that's where that's the reason why
[22:37] you're blessed in the first place.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why uh God has has
[22:42] kept you in the first place because
[22:44] there has been a connection.
[22:47] Sometimes we just forget. Brother
[22:50] Bandham, he says in in the message
[22:53] perseverance, he says you must find the
[22:55] will. You must first find the will of
[22:58] God before you can do um you can do the
[23:01] will of God. You must first know what
[23:04] his will in the matter.
[23:07] Then don't turn turn it loose. As the
[23:10] lady said today, she was trying to get
[23:12] beyond the sound barrier. Then the plane
[23:15] just um picks up speed and goes on un
[23:19] unlimited when it passes the sound
[23:21] barrier. Well, when you when you pray
[23:24] until you pass the doubt barrier,
[23:27] &gt;&gt; then you're running free.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; You go you go on and then you're there's
[23:33] nothing that can bother you then
[23:35] &gt;&gt; because you're running free past
[23:37] unbelief.
[23:39] It's done. It's been settled. It's all
[23:41] over. And when you get the insurance in
[23:44] your heart, that's it. Um, it's going to
[23:47] be that way. You're just as happy as it
[23:50] if it had already happened.
[23:53] There's there's this finding the will of
[23:56] God, finding what he wants in our lives.
[24:00] Lord, what do you want? Sometimes we
[24:02] want, there's so many things we want, we
[24:04] need, but Lord, what do you want in my
[24:06] life?
[24:08] Every big decision that we have, put it
[24:10] to the Lord and see
[24:12] &gt;&gt; see the Lord do something.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it doesn't look like the
[24:17] right decision.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it looks like he's leading you
[24:21] right to a ledge, but just keep going.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; If you trust in the Lord, you'll see him
[24:26] provide a way every single time.
[24:29] You know, one of my favorite stories,
[24:31] and it kind of reminds me of of uh my
[24:34] life, me and my wife's life, of when
[24:36] brother Brandham, he uh went hunting
[24:38] with his wife, and he went out there and
[24:41] and his conception was, I'm the best
[24:45] hunter in the world. I'm a great hunter.
[24:49] I've been doing this since I was a
[24:50] child. I know how to do all of this. and
[24:52] and and whenever he he um found himself
[24:55] lost, he be to run those things in his
[24:58] mind.
[25:00] Those conceptions that used to work, you
[25:02] know, we have conceptions of who we are
[25:04] and they they work when everything's
[25:06] running fine.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; But whenever things begin to get shaky,
[25:10] we begin to realize, man, I'm not who I
[25:14] thought I was.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not as strong. I I don't have
[25:17] control. I I don't have what what I
[25:20] thought I had.
[25:22] That's what brother Brandon began to
[25:25] think.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know what? When he
[25:28] realized, he had to realize that it
[25:30] wasn't in his his hands anymore.
[25:33] And when he realized that, then he got
[25:35] down to his feet and he prayed and he
[25:37] said, "Lord, I'm lost.
[25:40] Lord, I'm lost. I'm not a great hunter.
[25:43] I'm not what I thought I was."
[25:46] &gt;&gt; And whenever after he prayed, he didn't
[25:49] go up and still think those things.
[25:52] He didn't go up and and and begin to try
[25:54] to reason with himself. He just got up.
[25:57] He said, "Everything is going to be in
[25:59] his hands now."
[26:01] And he looked at one way and he said,
[26:03] "Okay, I'm going to go that way."
[26:06] &gt;&gt; That's the best thing to do. You don't
[26:08] know where you're going to go. You don't
[26:10] know what what's going to happen. But
[26:12] you you after the prayer, after giving
[26:14] your your will and seeking his will,
[26:17] then you've got to go
[26:19] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, now I'm going to go this
[26:20] way."
[26:22] &gt;&gt; And he began to walk that way. And then
[26:24] a hand touched him on his shoulder and
[26:26] he turned and then he saw an opening
[26:28] there.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; What was it? It's when you seek God, you
[26:33] take your own will out, begin to walk
[26:36] because you know it's in his hands. Now
[26:38] he's got to do something.
[26:40] He's got to touch you on the shoulder.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; If he's got to show you through a
[26:45] whirlwind, if he's got to show you
[26:46] through a dream, or if he's got to show
[26:48] you in your heart,
[26:51] &gt;&gt; you begin to walk and God will guide
[26:53] you.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; What you're seeking his will.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; You're not the greatest hunter in the
[27:00] world anymore. You're not the big bad
[27:02] man. You're not the smart woman. You're
[27:04] not this. You're just a child of God
[27:06] that is seeking his will. Amen.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; Saying, "Lord, it is your will."
[27:13] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants from us.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 1:26, he says, "Let us make
[27:18] man in our image." Now, he's talking to
[27:21] himself. He says, "In our likeness, and
[27:24] let them have dominion over the fish of
[27:25] the sea, over the fowl of the air, over
[27:27] the cattle, over the earth, and over
[27:29] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[27:32] the earth."
[27:35] I've heard a brother say that every
[27:37] source of every the source of every
[27:39] creation is its sustainer. So the wa the
[27:42] fish needs the water the the beasts need
[27:46] the the the dirt
[27:49] because that's how they came out of the
[27:52] the dirt. The beast came.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; But when God created man, he said, "Let
[27:59] us make man in our image."
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Ma man came out of God.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; So our sole sustainer and provider is
[28:10] God.
[28:11] Whenever we need something, whenever
[28:13] there's a need, whenever there's a lack,
[28:17] it's God that we're asking for.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Without
[28:23] God's
[28:25] uh extension,
[28:27] man cannot uh have dominion over this
[28:30] earth. He can can't exercise it without
[28:33] the power and the influence of God.
[28:36] Um, it reminds me of Matthew 6:10 where
[28:40] it says, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be
[28:42] done on earth as it is in heaven."
[28:44] There there has to be God's perfect
[28:47] will. And you have to say, Lord, your
[28:50] perfect will that has already been laid
[28:52] out in the heavens
[28:55] that has already been there before the
[28:56] foundation of the earth. Let it be in
[28:59] me.
[29:01] that phrase it what it's doing it's
[29:03] linking those two requests of thy
[29:05] kingdom come thy will be done
[29:09] on on earth as it is in heaven
[29:12] &gt;&gt; your kingdom your will let it be done
[29:16] how it is up there how it is in you let
[29:19] it be done in me
[29:22] &gt;&gt; and what happens it it begins to to
[29:25] harmonize earth begins to harmonize with
[29:28] heaven
[29:30] Why? Because you begin to walk in his
[29:31] will.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; You begin to reflect what's in the
[29:35] heavenlies.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; You begin to to uh portray his image
[29:40] because man was created in the image of
[29:42] God. And of course, it's not a physical
[29:44] image. It was his character.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; It is his will. It is his word. And when
[29:50] we say, Lord, let thy kingdom come. Let
[29:52] thy will. Let your word work in me. Then
[29:56] this earth,
[29:58] this this piece of dirt begins to
[30:00] reflect God himself.
[30:04] So we need God
[30:06] to be a Christian, to be the best
[30:07] Christian.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; How can we be a Christian without a
[30:11] connection with God,
[30:13] &gt;&gt; without a reflection of God?
[30:16] &gt;&gt; That's that's where we see the churches
[30:18] today. That's where we see religion
[30:21] today where there's this image being
[30:24] portrayed of Christianity
[30:27] without the connection of the father. So
[30:30] it begins to be just this this fake this
[30:33] copyright as brother Aaron says this
[30:36] this this thing that is has been copied
[30:40] and it's not being portrayed the way it
[30:42] should be.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; And I truly believe it's because that
[30:46] connection has been lost. There has to
[30:49] be that connection. So, Matthew 6:10,
[30:52] it's it's a call for God's reign to
[30:55] shape our world as a fully
[30:58] uh as as it is fully in heaven.
[31:01] And and what it does, it reflects both a
[31:04] hope of the millennial reign and a
[31:06] present desire for God's manifestation
[31:08] in our lives.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; So, it's com combining the longing, the
[31:14] submission, and the action of God's
[31:16] kingdom.
[31:17] So God God he has he has subjects today.
[31:21] God's kingdom is here today and that's
[31:23] through you. That's what I like about
[31:26] when you read the gospels, you know, we
[31:29] we've been so uh people have been so
[31:34] groomed to think that that Christianity
[31:37] is a religion
[31:39] &gt;&gt; that it's churches and it's all these
[31:41] things and it's it's all all this
[31:45] churchianity.
[31:47] But when Jesus came,
[31:49] &gt;&gt; the desire of the people were a change
[31:52] in the kingdom.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; They they were being they were under the
[31:57] rule of the Roman Empire.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; And they needed a change in the kingdom.
[32:02] They need they didn't need a church.
[32:04] They didn't need any of that. They
[32:06] needed a king
[32:08] &gt;&gt; to change the kingdom. And whenever
[32:10] Jesus came, of course, he wasn't in the
[32:12] image or the the likeness of what they
[32:14] wanted it because they thought he was
[32:16] going to come down. He was going to
[32:17] overthrow their kingdom and and and the
[32:20] rule of the the Israelites was going to
[32:22] be there.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; But he said, "My kingdom is in here."
[32:28] &gt;&gt; That's where the kingdom is.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; So when my kingdom come, it starts from
[32:34] the heart. And there's people like
[32:36] brother Brandham says are little
[32:37] messiahs.
[32:39] Yes.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Walking around
[32:41] projecting his kingdom that is coming
[32:44] and is and is here already.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; There'll be a f fulfillment and a
[32:50] fullness of his kingdom. But right now
[32:52] we are establishing his kingdom. Now
[32:56] &gt;&gt; that's what church is.
[32:58] If you look at that word church whenever
[33:01] he says uh uh my church shall be built
[33:03] upon this revelation that's what he
[33:05] means. this establishment or this
[33:07] kingdom.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus wanted.
[33:13] So when when a person he doesn't
[33:16] communicate with God
[33:18] when when he begins to be separated,
[33:22] what happens is we begin to be governed
[33:24] by dirt.
[33:25] We begin to be governed by our our flesh
[33:30] &gt;&gt; once that connection is done
[33:32] &gt;&gt; because we are made
[33:35] by a sustainer which is God.
[33:38] So, so we need that to survive.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; You take water from a fish, he ain't
[33:44] going to survive.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; You take those things from from those
[33:48] animals, they ain't going to survive.
[33:50] You take God from a man and he will
[33:52] wither and perish.
[33:55] He could be the greatest man in the
[33:56] land, but there that the soul that
[33:58] sinnth shall surely die.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; There has to be a connection with God or
[34:04] then we begin to be governed by this
[34:06] dirt.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Which is um one of the things that the
[34:09] devil wants us to do.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; We're not supposed to make our own way,
[34:13] our own decisions concerning good and
[34:15] evil.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be describing or making a
[34:20] definition of what's good and what's
[34:21] evil.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; That's not up to us.
[34:25] We're our sole duty is to say, "Lord,
[34:29] what is your will?" I honestly believe
[34:32] that's what Lucifer did. That's what Eve
[34:35] did. She She wanted to take a bite from
[34:39] the tree of the of the tree of the
[34:41] knowledge of good and evil.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; She wanted the knowledge of what good
[34:45] and evil is.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; And then people now they want to weigh
[34:49] out what's good and what's evil in their
[34:51] own lives.
[34:53] And now you you see society and and
[34:56] maybe way back when uh George Washington
[34:59] was there. Maybe they there's things
[35:01] that they did that they thought was
[35:02] good. And many things were probably more
[35:05] good than it is now. But there was still
[35:07] slavery there.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; There was still evil there. But they
[35:12] weighed out what was good and what
[35:13] wasn't.
[35:15] Now you see people changing their
[35:17] genders, their identities, their
[35:19] whatever they wanted to. And they're
[35:21] saying they're calling this good.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; What it was the tree of knowledge of
[35:26] good and evil.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; They they they'd rather pick their own
[35:31] good, pick their own evil and say,
[35:34] "Okay, well, let's see what's this." And
[35:35] that's where all this fuss is about.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm sure the automobile, like
[35:40] brother Brandham says, that was a good
[35:42] thing. But brother Brandham, he said in
[35:45] a quote, "Umobiles kill more than than
[35:49] gunpowder does.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; It's out of good. It's out of good
[35:54] intentions." But every time we bite out
[35:56] of that tree, that's what happens.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Every time we're governed by our own
[36:01] selves, maybe it looks good. Maybe we
[36:05] think it's all right. Maybe we think
[36:06] it's our own our own way and it's good.
[36:09] It's always going to lead to evil.
[36:16] always going the other way will always
[36:18] lead to evil.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; I realized that even with Satan, he uh
[36:25] I truly believe that he thought he had a
[36:27] better way.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; It was not so much like Cain where he
[36:32] had uh
[36:35] a wealth of evil that he wanted to kill
[36:38] his brother. But think about Cain. In
[36:40] the beginning, he thought his sacrifice
[36:43] was a better one.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; That was good intentions.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Lucifer, he probably had a better way.
[36:51] It wasn't so much that he wanted to take
[36:53] over and he he's like, "No, I want a I
[36:55] have a better way."
[36:57] &gt;&gt; And he says once he went out of the way,
[37:00] he went out of the word. And every time
[37:02] we leave the word, evil there is
[37:05] present.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Darkness is there. Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; And those were the seeds of it. And now
[37:11] we see the fruit of it.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Every time we make our own way, maybe it
[37:16] looks innocent. Maybe it looks all
[37:18] right.
[37:19] Look at the fruit.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Look at the end product. And we'll see.
[37:24] Wow. Because I made my own way. Because
[37:27] I took control of my own will.
[37:32] Jeremiah 10:23 it says
[37:35] 10:23 and 24 it says, "Oh Lord, I know
[37:40] that the way of man is not in himself.
[37:44] It is not in man that walketh to direct
[37:48] his steps. Oh Lord, correct me but with
[37:51] judgment and not thine anger, lest thou
[37:54] bring me to nothing."
[37:57] That's my prayer today. Lord, it's not
[38:00] my my job to go my own way or do those
[38:03] things because every time we do it,
[38:05] we're going to find ourselves in the
[38:07] mud. We're going to find ourselves in
[38:09] trouble. But Lord, correct me with your
[38:12] judgment, not in your anger.
[38:14] Brother Brandham, he says in the
[38:16] message, "Believest um thou this." He
[38:19] says how beautiful
[38:22] um that his uh that is of the Holy
[38:25] Spirit our sustaining strength to carry
[38:28] the church on. If they failed to eat
[38:30] mana they died. If we fail to eat on the
[38:34] Holy Ghost we die. If we failed to pray
[38:37] through daily all the time keep under
[38:40] the blood you will wither up and die in
[38:43] your Christian experience.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Prayer is important. Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have the form and we have
[38:51] the scaffold work of a Christian, but
[38:53] whenever we leave that source, man,
[38:56] we're withering up. We need it. We need
[39:00] it. And you know what? We're I'm not
[39:03] going to point any fingers. I'm just
[39:05] going to tell me I need it.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; How many times do do I forget to pray?
[39:11] Why Why should it be a um a duty? Why
[39:15] should it be something? It should be a
[39:17] very desire
[39:19] &gt;&gt; to in every matter in everything in
[39:21] every every desire that you have every
[39:24] person that you love they you put them
[39:26] in prayer
[39:28] &gt;&gt; and so say Lord I'm putting this person
[39:30] up
[39:32] &gt;&gt; I'm putting this person in your will
[39:35] &gt;&gt; man there's a partnership in prayer it's
[39:38] not a duty it's not this it's a
[39:41] partnership
[39:43] that's why a child of God he can reason
[39:45] with God.
[39:47] Abraham, he pleaded with God. Lord, if
[39:50] if there's 50, please don't burn down
[39:53] Sodom and Gomorrah.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; What was it? It wasn't just a casual
[39:57] conversation. It was a desperate prayer
[40:00] &gt;&gt; for his his uh family member Lot.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's only there's 50, Lord,
[40:06] all right, there's 40. If there's 30, if
[40:09] there's 20, if there's 10, and God
[40:12] reasoned with him the whole time.
[40:15] The amazing thing is God was working
[40:18] through him.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think we're praying our own
[40:21] desires, but it's God's will in you
[40:24] &gt;&gt; already.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Baram he says in presuming he
[40:31] says all right so Israel called out
[40:33] Moses. So Israel God called out Moses uh
[40:37] and said I am going to destroy the whole
[40:39] nation. Just step aside. Moses
[40:42] interceded, throwed himself in the
[40:44] breach. It was Christ and Moses. You
[40:47] see, God would have killed the whole
[40:50] world one time of um one time for sin.
[40:55] Christ throwed himself in the breach for
[40:57] the whole human race. Moses throwed
[41:00] himself in the breach for Israel. He
[41:02] said, "You made a promise, God. You made
[41:05] a promise that you would take them into
[41:07] the land." Now, you think he was a wise
[41:09] man. You think he had a better thought
[41:11] than God?
[41:12] &gt;&gt; He was projecting God's very heart.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; He says, "You made a pro uh" He says,
[41:22] "That's right. What did Moses do to
[41:25] God?" When it looked like God was going
[41:27] to do something contrary, he throwed the
[41:31] word in his way. Amen. Oh, I love that.
[41:34] How now I feel like shouting just just
[41:37] talking about it. See, put the word in
[41:40] the way. God can't walk over his own
[41:43] word.
[41:44] Said you promised to do it. You You said
[41:48] you would take them to a good land that
[41:50] was flowing with milk and honey.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; I told them what you said and here we
[41:56] are. We are in your hands.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; You know, it sounds disrespectful, but
[42:02] God wants us to make them feel
[42:04] obligated.
[42:06] Say, "Lord, you're obligated to heal me.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, you you said it in your word.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; It's not my own thoughts that I'm giving
[42:15] you, Lord. It's your word."
[42:18] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's It's God communing with
[42:20] himself. Again,
[42:22] &gt;&gt; just as he said, "Let us create man in
[42:24] our own image." Now, he's reasoning with
[42:26] himself, allowing the flesh to project
[42:30] his very heart
[42:32] &gt;&gt; and said, "Lord, we're in your hands."
[42:35] Yes,
[42:36] &gt;&gt; I'm in your hands, Lord.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; You said it in your word.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Don't bring your own ideas. Don't bring
[42:42] your own will. Don't bring your own
[42:44] wisdom. Bring him his own word.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; That's man, that's the greatest thing.
[42:50] The greatest people I've ever met is men
[42:53] of the word.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Imagine God.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what makes me a
[42:59] Christian because God is a God of his
[43:02] own word. And and if you stand on his
[43:05] word, do not deviate from one side. He
[43:08] has to. He's obligated
[43:11] &gt;&gt; to take you over.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; He's obligated to heal you. He's
[43:15] obligated to restore you.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Well, it hasn't happened yet. Well, keep
[43:20] on waiting.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Well, man, I'm I'm worse than I was
[43:24] yesterday. Well, keep on trusting
[43:28] &gt;&gt; because God, he does not forsake his
[43:30] people. If there's a doubt, if there's a
[43:33] barrier, break that barrier away.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Break those things that that are
[43:38] contrary to God's word and put his word
[43:41] in his way
[43:42] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, this is your word.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; I have nothing else. I don't have my
[43:47] thoughts anymore. I failed three, four,
[43:49] five times already because I thought I
[43:51] had a better way. But now I'm putting
[43:53] your own word
[43:55] &gt;&gt; and I'm here on my knees with the thing
[43:58] that I need, Lord.
[44:02] How can my prayers affect
[44:05] the predetermined will of God?
[44:09] Do we change his mind? No. Our prayer is
[44:13] inspired by the Holy Spirit.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; It becomes the very decrees of God. Our
[44:19] prayer. That's why when we profess with
[44:22] our mouths when we confess
[44:25] the Bible I think it's homoglo homologio
[44:30] it means to say the same thing
[44:33] it homo means the same and logos means
[44:37] the word
[44:38] &gt;&gt; it says to say the same word
[44:41] &gt;&gt; so when we're confessing it's not only
[44:44] sins that we're confessing we're
[44:45] confessing his own word back to him
[44:49] &gt;&gt; and saying Lord Lord, you said it. I
[44:52] believe it. Lord, you have to do it.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; This is not a a petition of selfish and
[44:59] personal gains. Hey, who's guilty of
[45:02] that? Lord, I need another car, Lord. I
[45:06] need a raise. I need this.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; That's human nature.
[45:12] But whenever we can get into his will,
[45:16] &gt;&gt; when we can get into his spirit,
[45:21] you'll see him move.
[45:23] I I I believe he will give us what we
[45:27] want. I believe sometimes whenever
[45:31] there's a leak, whenever there's this,
[45:33] we can ask the Lord, "Lord, help me,
[45:35] Lord."
[45:36] &gt;&gt; And he'll do it.
[45:39] But when we're in his will, the Bible
[45:42] says in James 4:3, it says, "Ye ask and
[45:45] receive not because ye asked amiss
[45:48] &gt;&gt; in vain you for selfish reasons that ye
[45:52] may consume it upon your lusts."
[45:56] Brother Brandham, he says in the Godhead
[45:57] explain, he says, "You must test your
[45:59] motive and your objective first.
[46:02] First find the will of God and then you
[46:06] find your objective and then test your
[46:08] motive and see if your motive is right.
[46:12] Then as Jesus said in in in Mark 11:23,
[46:15] if you say to this mountain, "Be moved
[46:17] and you don't doubt in your heart." But
[46:19] as long as you've got doubt in your
[46:21] heart, whether it's the will of God or
[46:24] your motive or objective is wrong, how
[46:26] is it going to move? Man, he said a
[46:29] mouthful there. He says everything has
[46:32] to align. Your motives, your objectives,
[46:36] your faith,
[46:38] you everything has to align. If there's
[46:41] doubt, even though the motive is right,
[46:43] it ain't going to work.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; If the objective isn't right, it ain't
[46:47] going to work. If you still got faith,
[46:50] &gt;&gt; if if the motive isn't right, but you
[46:53] have everything else, it ain't going to
[46:54] work. It has to be, Lord, I'm here in
[46:56] faith. I'm in your word mountain me be
[47:00] moved and watch it move. Watch the
[47:04] things that you need happen.
[47:07] God's faithful to his word.
[47:12] When you begin to plead his own
[47:13] promises,
[47:15] then your will is his will.
[47:18] You begin to be so in Christ when you
[47:21] begin to pray, "Thy kingdom come, thy
[47:23] will be done on earth as it is in
[47:24] heaven."
[47:26] It's God's legal right to work and to
[47:29] act through you. You begin to be an
[47:32] agent.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; You begin to see the sovereignty of God
[47:36] where it's not in other places.
[47:38] You begin to see things where people
[47:41] might not see God at all, but you see
[47:43] him every step of the way.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Whether it's in the simple things or the
[47:48] big things. You know, I like whenever a
[47:52] person begins to see God in the simple
[47:54] things, you know, even if it's this it's
[47:59] traffic, it's just good. Say, Lord, it's
[48:03] praise God.
[48:05] You know,
[48:06] &gt;&gt; when you see God in everything. Brother
[48:08] Brandham says when somebody receives the
[48:10] Holy Ghost, they begin to see God in the
[48:12] birds.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; They begin to see God in the sky. I'd
[48:16] rather see God everywhere I go and
[48:18] everything I do and blame it on God
[48:21] &gt;&gt; than to be a pessimist
[48:23] &gt;&gt; than to be negative thinking
[48:26] &gt;&gt; to kick the kick the dog and kick
[48:28] everything and be be angry about
[48:30] everything
[48:31] &gt;&gt; because nothing is working. I'm always
[48:33] late. I'm this. I'm that. Say, "Lord,
[48:36] thank you.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I was probably late
[48:39] because there was a crash.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you for this and thank you
[48:43] for that." and you begin to give
[48:45] everything with thanksgiving and prayer.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Thank you, Lord, for the
[48:50] life you've given me."
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Well, you're in this condition. Thank
[48:53] you, Lord, that I'm still alive.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Well, look at what's happening to this
[48:58] and that. Well, thank you, Lord, because
[49:00] he's going to find a way.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; That's God.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; God is in every single thing. God does
[49:08] not he's he's more attention to detail
[49:11] than the devil
[49:12] &gt;&gt; because what is it um the devil's in the
[49:14] details
[49:16] God beat him way more
[49:19] &gt;&gt; God is a prem premeditated God
[49:23] &gt;&gt; everything that has happened everything
[49:25] that is happening is it's Christ in
[49:28] there
[49:29] &gt;&gt; that's what brother Brandham said in
[49:30] Christ is the mystery of God it revealed
[49:32] he said every single dot every single
[49:35] iota every single cross He in the word
[49:38] is Christ.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; And he says, "How about us?"
[49:43] &gt;&gt; And everything we do, everything that's
[49:45] around us, we see Christ in it.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; And we say, "Lord, it's your will.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, it's your will."
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Divine intervention. It starts with your
[49:56] prayer.
[49:58] Just like Daniel, think about it. That
[50:01] was God's will to give that prophecy.
[50:05] That's if you ever dissect that
[50:07] prophecy, it's one of the greatest
[50:10] to to somebody is unbelieving, if
[50:13] somebody is struggling, you look at that
[50:15] prophecy of the 70 70 weeks of Daniel
[50:18] and people will say, "Oh, no, that must
[50:20] have been written way after." Because it
[50:23] literally to the dot it says what's
[50:26] going to happen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; It says what kingdoms were going to take
[50:30] place before they were even there.
[50:33] They say, "No, that must have been
[50:34] written after."
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that prophecy was so rich
[50:41] &gt;&gt; to the very day, to the very minute for
[50:43] the Jews.
[50:46] And yet, it was Daniel's desire to know
[50:50] those things. It was Daniel's desire to
[50:53] pray those what 21 days.
[50:56] And as he was praying, he thought that
[50:58] was his desire. It was God's will in him
[51:02] &gt;&gt; saying through you and and honestly I've
[51:06] already listened to you but there's
[51:08] things that have to happen
[51:10] &gt;&gt; and the amazing thing is while he was
[51:12] praying
[51:14] maybe while he was thinking that nobody
[51:16] was answering
[51:18] maybe in the mid mid two weeks he was
[51:20] like wow this fasting this praying woo
[51:24] yet there was there was a war happening
[51:28] in on another dimension
[51:30] There was there was devils trying to
[51:34] stop the answer.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; There was angels there fighting for him.
[51:40] Sometimes your prayer maybe it hasn't
[51:43] been
[51:45] hasn't been answered yet, but yet hearts
[51:48] are changing.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; People's thoughts begin to change.
[51:53] Maybe that person that continues to be a
[51:56] rude person at work or his heart is
[51:59] changing
[52:00] &gt;&gt; because of a prayer.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; There's many puzzles that begin to work
[52:05] into place while you're there in prayer
[52:07] saying, "Lord, I believe in you.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, I know this is going to happen."
[52:12] And maybe you don't see it. Maybe you
[52:14] think everything is dead and everything
[52:16] just, oh, there's no movement. There's
[52:18] no movement in my life. There's no
[52:20] movement in the church. There's
[52:21] &gt;&gt; there's pieces being moved.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; There's things happening, spiritual
[52:26] things.
[52:28] Sometimes it gets worse. But God is
[52:31] obligated to his word.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; God is so good.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Let us stand to our feet.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; You know the prayer it changes
[52:45] everything. It even brother Brandham
[52:47] says that prayer it sweetens tempers.
[52:51] It says sometimes you know people step
[52:53] on your toes. What do I do to overcome
[52:55] that?
[52:57] Brother Brandham, he says, "Sweeten your
[52:59] temper with prayer."
[53:02] You want to change things, even change
[53:03] your life? Prayer.
[53:07] There was one person that asked, "Lord,
[53:09] how do I get closer to the Lord?
[53:12] How do I get a deeper relationship?"
[53:15] I'm sure they were waiting for this
[53:17] great mystery. He said, "Read your Bible
[53:19] and pray."
[53:21] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.
[53:24] It maybe seems like a duty. Maybe it
[53:26] seems like work, but when you realize
[53:28] that there's a lifeline, that there is
[53:30] somebody waiting on that line,
[53:33] &gt;&gt; there's somebody listening,
[53:36] somebody waiting to work.
[53:42] Let us bow our heads.
[53:45] Heavenly Father,
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, it's your will,
[53:50] it's your will that we're here, Father.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; It's your will that we're going through
[53:56] what we're going through.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; It's your will that you've called us,
[54:00] Lord.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; It's your will in all things.
[54:06] And Father, it's even your will in the
[54:08] things that I don't want to let go.
[54:11] Sometimes, Father, we don't want to let
[54:13] go of that thing because we don't feel
[54:15] like anybody's got it. Nobody will take
[54:18] care of it. Only me. But Lord, allow
[54:21] that that spirit of control just to get
[54:24] away.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; And Lord, take control in each and every
[54:28] person's life. Father,
[54:31] &gt;&gt; let your will be done, Lord, on earth as
[54:34] it is with you, Father.
[54:36] Touch each and every person that needs
[54:39] more of you, Father. But Lord, sometimes
[54:42] our will is too strong, Lord. Show them,
[54:45] Father, that you've been knocking.
[54:48] Show them that, Lord, you have so much
[54:50] more to give.
[54:53] We thank you, Jesus. We thank you for
[54:55] your will. We thank you for allowing us
[54:58] to let you in in our lives and that we
[55:00] can understand your word and be here in
[55:04] the last days. Father, what a pleasure.
[55:06] Father, we thank you, Jesus. We ask that
[55:09] you bless each and every person here.
[55:12] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[55:13] pray. Amen. Amen.
