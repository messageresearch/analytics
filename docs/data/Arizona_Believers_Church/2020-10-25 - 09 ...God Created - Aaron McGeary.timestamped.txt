[0:00] psalms chapter 1 read verses 1 2 and 3
[0:03] blessed is the man that walketh not
[0:05] in the counsel of the ungodly nor
[0:08] standeth in the way of sinners
[0:10] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[0:12] you notice as the progression if you
[0:14] walk in the counts of the ungodly
[0:15] eventually you're standing
[0:17] in the way of sinners and then
[0:18] ultimately you're just going to sit
[0:20] right down in the seat of the scornful
[0:21] so it's a treacherous path that we walk
[0:24] when we walk with under the council of
[0:26] the ungodly
[0:27] but his delight blessed is the man who
[0:29] doesn't do that this man this blessed
[0:31] man his delight is in the law of the
[0:33] lord his commandments his precepts
[0:35] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[0:37] night and he shall be like a tree
[0:39] planted by the rivers of water that
[0:42] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[0:44] his leaf also shall not wither and
[0:47] whatsoever he doeth
[0:48] shall prosper amen you may be seated
[0:58] we're continuing on the subject of
[1:02] uh god created we we had a number of
[1:05] services when we were
[1:06] looking at in the beginning we're still
[1:09] looking at in the beginning but we
[1:11] wanted to just take it from genesis
[1:12] chapter 1
[1:13] verse 1 and take it a step further
[1:17] and in the beginning god created and by
[1:20] looking at
[1:21] this phrase god created we're looking at
[1:23] a divine attribute
[1:25] which god alone creates and with a
[1:28] divine purpose so god
[1:29] had the ability to create but as he
[1:31] created he did it according to a plan
[1:34] and a desire that he had within his
[1:36] heart
[1:37] and as god is creating and bringing
[1:39] forth the firmament
[1:40] and separating water from land and light
[1:43] from darkness he's establishing order
[1:46] and this is a god who's actually
[1:48] determining destiny we see in the
[1:49] beginning
[1:50] he's putting things in their position
[1:52] and he's painting a picture
[1:54] in creation that holds a mystery and
[1:56] that's
[1:57] that's a key that we've kind of been
[1:58] identifying is that when we read this we
[2:01] read it
[2:01] and then we see that there's something
[2:03] being told to us
[2:05] but yet there's more to what's taking
[2:07] place and so when god creates it's
[2:10] important for us to think that
[2:11] i understand that there was no external
[2:14] pressure working upon god when he
[2:15] created
[2:16] all there was was an eternal desire so
[2:19] there's no
[2:19] there's no factors on the outside that's
[2:22] influencing him there's no false motive
[2:23] there's no
[2:24] a false instigator something pestering
[2:27] him and bothering him
[2:28] so it's just the divine elohim there in
[2:31] the beginning who dwelt alone
[2:33] and something moving within himself
[2:36] causing him to create so it's all
[2:38] according to
[2:39] a divine intelligence and i use that
[2:42] phrase
[2:43] not to somehow compete with the
[2:44] evolutionists that no just look at
[2:46] creation there's got to be some
[2:47] intelligence behind that
[2:48] i think that's obvious and i think even
[2:51] those
[2:52] those inside scientists who would
[2:54] believe in evolution
[2:55] have to at least concede that there's
[2:58] some design
[2:59] intelligence within the organism itself
[3:02] that allows these things to come forth
[3:04] and
[3:04] maybe i'm just assuming they would at
[3:06] least concede on that point one thing's
[3:08] for sure if you ask them could you be
[3:09] wrong they'll all say
[3:11] yes could you be wrong they'll all say
[3:13] yes
[3:14] but there's one thing you can't be wrong
[3:15] about and that's the revelation of jesus
[3:17] christ personally to you once it's
[3:19] revealed to you
[3:20] you don't know by rigorous scientific
[3:21] methods you know by revelation
[3:23] and so as we read in the beginning god
[3:25] created the heaven and the earth
[3:27] this verse stands at the start of the
[3:29] revelation of god
[3:31] and and it caused us to ponder just to
[3:34] stop for a moment and think what is this
[3:35] what are
[3:36] what are the oh these opening chapters
[3:38] of the bible doing
[3:39] they're teaching us the knowledge of god
[3:41] and his will
[3:43] and it's very important regardless of
[3:45] what scripture we're reading we cannot
[3:47] read
[3:48] any scripture from the standpoint that
[3:49] it's merely a historical record
[3:52] and this is especially so with respect
[3:53] to creation we cannot read of creation
[3:56] only as a historical record of what god
[3:58] was doing or what he has done
[4:00] because when we read this we're not just
[4:02] merely being told what god did
[4:04] when we read this it's not just well
[4:06] this happened and that happened like we
[4:07] would
[4:08] like we read the newspaper we read the
[4:10] newspaper and we find out that there's
[4:12] there's been a fire in one part of
[4:14] arizona we're like no news there that's
[4:16] common then we read there's one in
[4:17] california and there's one in colorado
[4:19] and they're all just kind of moving
[4:20] towards each other we might say yep you
[4:22] know
[4:22] the br the bible prophesies that this
[4:24] earth is going to burn up
[4:26] that's why i don't argue about global
[4:27] warming i mean it's right there in the
[4:30] bible there's definitely a global
[4:32] warming that's coming but when we read
[4:33] that you're just being told what's
[4:34] happening
[4:36] you don't expect some inspiration of
[4:38] revelation and you're not looking for
[4:40] symbols or foreshadowing uh
[4:42] that's just reading a historical record
[4:44] what has happened we do not read the
[4:46] scripture from the standpoint
[4:47] just to learn what god has done but
[4:49] there's more to it
[4:51] we've read in romans where it said these
[4:53] things that were written before were
[4:54] written for our learning that we through
[4:56] um learning and patience of the
[4:57] scripture could have hope
[4:59] the bible says that all scripture is
[5:00] given by inspiration
[5:02] of of god and it is good for doctrine
[5:04] and for correction and reproof
[5:06] so every scripture even if it's telling
[5:08] you a story
[5:09] has some power to it to give you insight
[5:12] into the heart of god to give you a
[5:13] revelation of jesus christ
[5:15] and transcend historical record and do
[5:18] something for you presently
[5:19] so when we're looking at genesis chapter
[5:21] one and we look at chapter two in
[5:22] chapter 3 if we
[5:24] walk through those chapters it's not
[5:25] just to think about what god has done
[5:27] but to find the knowledge of god and to
[5:29] know his will
[5:30] and one statement that we used last time
[5:33] and we're
[5:34] going to pick up on it is in the message
[5:36] power of transformation
[5:38] where brother graham's identifying two
[5:40] different kinds of power
[5:41] a power to create or transform and a
[5:44] power to deform
[5:45] god alone has the power to create god
[5:47] alone has the power to transform
[5:49] something
[5:50] and and satan can only deform he only
[5:53] has to take exist he can only take
[5:55] existing substance
[5:56] and and pervert it manipulate it hybrid
[5:59] it do something to it but he cannot
[6:00] create
[6:01] something from nothing and in the
[6:03] beginning god created he was not taking
[6:05] something that previously existed
[6:06] but he was doing a new thing something
[6:08] new altogether
[6:10] and and so in this message power of
[6:12] transformation
[6:13] brother ram says there was adam and eve
[6:15] walking in the garden
[6:16] every seed bringing forth now this
[6:20] this expresses to us the silence between
[6:22] genesis the end of genesis chapter 2
[6:23] in the beginning of genesis chapter 3
[6:25] because we see that the woman comes
[6:27] forth from the man
[6:28] adam gives this great prophetic
[6:29] utterance and then brother branham
[6:31] saying what was happening
[6:32] is that they were walking in this garden
[6:34] of eden
[6:35] and every seed was doing exactly what
[6:37] the bible said it would do
[6:40] as god said in genesis 1 11 let the
[6:42] earth bring forth grass the herb
[6:43] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[6:45] yielding fruit after his kind
[6:46] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[6:49] and it was so
[6:50] so this was god's law the seed is in you
[6:52] the power of transformation to bring
[6:54] forth fruit
[6:55] it's in you and he says here's adam and
[6:57] the woman walking in the garden
[6:58] genesis 1 11 is being fulfilled he says
[7:01] every seed is being enforced
[7:03] and then with that image in mind he says
[7:06] oh i wish we could just stop here for a
[7:07] moment
[7:08] there is where we are facing yet the
[7:10] completion of that word
[7:13] so the the language that he's using is
[7:16] to say
[7:16] this is what we are doing right now says
[7:19] this is what we're facing this is what
[7:21] we're beholding
[7:22] this is what we're called to right now
[7:24] is genesis what began in genesis
[7:26] is now being completed we're facing the
[7:29] completion the finishing
[7:31] the fulfilling of what those seeds
[7:33] represented we're facing
[7:34] the completion of what adam and eve were
[7:36] walking in what they represented what
[7:39] they were to fulfill
[7:40] and and it's just establishing that just
[7:43] as uh
[7:44] foundational building blocks as we go
[7:45] forward
[7:47] now where we stopped last time and i
[7:49] apologize to anybody who wasn't here
[7:50] last time if this just seems to be like
[7:52] a real abrupt just
[7:53] bust through the wall like the kool-aid
[7:56] guy hey i'm here
[7:57] this is where we're at but i want to
[7:59] just go right to this
[8:00] uh to where we were last time because it
[8:04] looks
[8:04] it it helps us to fully better
[8:07] understand
[8:07] a number of different things but
[8:08] specifically how god created something
[8:11] with the plan
[8:13] and as he does something satan's right
[8:15] there to meet it
[8:17] so what say in satan's approach to god's
[8:20] creation and how satan now steps forward
[8:24] after the woman's come forth now we see
[8:26] satan animating the serpent now we see
[8:28] satan doing something
[8:30] it helps us to understand what god's
[8:32] purpose is and it may seem a little bit
[8:34] odd to say that
[8:36] but when you recognize the attributes of
[8:38] satan what he's trying to achieve
[8:40] you realize wow the the principles that
[8:43] we believe in the bible
[8:45] the truths that have been restored to us
[8:48] it's so much more than just what the
[8:51] original sin was
[8:53] and like oh well that's what caused the
[8:54] fall it's not just what caused the fall
[8:57] why did why did it fall
[9:00] why did it even happen how could god let
[9:02] that happen why would god let that
[9:04] happen
[9:04] and why would satan choose to cause it
[9:06] to fall that way
[9:09] because there's more to it than just a
[9:11] man satan just must have found the weak
[9:12] spot it
[9:13] it there's something that was taking
[9:15] place and satan's attack against the
[9:17] woman
[9:18] has to do with the hidden mystery of god
[9:21] the fact that he went right there
[9:23] and so i'm going to ask a question why
[9:24] did he target her
[9:27] satan and there's a number of scriptures
[9:29] that i think will hold off
[9:31] for next time lord willing satan opposed
[9:35] god's will
[9:36] he opposes the divine intelligence he's
[9:38] opposing the plan of god
[9:40] and we used some references last time to
[9:44] substantiate this claim
[9:45] and in doing so in being very quick to
[9:47] oppose god's plan
[9:49] he unwittingly played a part in
[9:51] fulfilling god's plan
[9:52] he didn't mean to but he did just as we
[9:55] read had the princes of this world known
[9:56] that crucifying christ
[9:58] would would be the beginning of
[9:59] redemption they would have never done it
[10:02] that's why brother branham he talks
[10:03] about the seventh seal if he gets a hold
[10:05] of this he could do great damage
[10:07] and you think well how that's really
[10:09] weird if satan really knew what the
[10:11] seventh seal was he really knew
[10:12] this truth that's unfolding the
[10:14] revelation was given if he really knew
[10:15] how could he do great damage that
[10:17] doesn't make sense
[10:18] in the same way that had the princes of
[10:20] this world known
[10:21] what the messiah was on earth for in his
[10:23] first coming and they would have
[10:24] hindered it they would have resisted
[10:25] they would have not played their part
[10:27] and so there's that there's a there's a
[10:29] paradox to that but if there's a truth
[10:31] to it
[10:33] and so satan uh without intending to do
[10:36] so
[10:37] was used in god's divine purpose and
[10:39] plan
[10:40] in ezekiel chapter 28 verse 13 speaking
[10:43] of
[10:44] lucifer and satan and used as a using an
[10:47] allegory
[10:48] of a king he says thou hast been in eden
[10:50] the garden of god
[10:52] so now we place lucifer satan the devil
[10:56] we place him in eden the garden of god
[10:59] or the garden of eden how we may say it
[11:02] and the satan now being placed there
[11:06] where we see him act is he immediately
[11:08] attacks
[11:09] the woman and
[11:12] if we could try to only uh
[11:16] hypothetically put yourself in satan's
[11:19] shoes
[11:20] don't want to scare anybody off but just
[11:23] think about how
[11:24] lucifer this angel would have been there
[11:28] witnessing these things unfold so god
[11:31] did not create all of creation create
[11:33] heaven and earth and then
[11:34] place and then create lucifer and he
[11:36] kind of just shows up all of a sudden in
[11:37] the garden he's like now what do i do
[11:38] what should i do
[11:39] he's there and he witnesses all of
[11:41] creation
[11:43] he witnesses the order that god
[11:44] established in heaven
[11:47] he witnessed before the throne and the
[11:49] cherubims and all that order
[11:50] he saw an image of something
[11:54] in heaven and then he witnesses god
[11:57] making man
[11:58] creating earth evoluting on up to man
[12:00] and then when he gets to man
[12:02] he sees that god is declaring these
[12:04] things about being things being very
[12:06] good
[12:07] and he sees that god expresses something
[12:09] in that
[12:10] man ought not to be alone and then he
[12:13] brings the woman
[12:14] out of the man satan is witnessing each
[12:16] one of these things
[12:17] so satan is just not blindly stumbling
[12:20] upon the man
[12:21] and the woman and then kind of think how
[12:22] can i what can i do this is my
[12:24] opportunity
[12:25] he sees something and satan is learning
[12:28] as he sees this and he has a particular
[12:30] understanding and insight
[12:32] and so this is what he witnesses in
[12:34] genesis chapter 1
[12:35] verses 27 to 28. so god created man in
[12:39] his own image genesis chapter 1
[12:41] verses 27 and 28 so god created man in
[12:44] his own image and the image of god
[12:45] created he him
[12:46] male and female created he them so now
[12:50] when man was made he was made in the
[12:52] image of god
[12:53] and in that image was male and female
[12:56] and then immediately it says and god
[12:57] blessed them and god said unto them
[12:59] be fruitful multiply and replenish the
[13:01] earth and subdue it and have dominion
[13:04] over the fish of the sea over the fowl
[13:05] of the air
[13:06] and he's establishing that adam is to be
[13:08] a god upon earth
[13:10] this man is to be fruitful multiply and
[13:12] replenish
[13:13] and now he is a reflection satan
[13:16] realizes he's a reflection of divine
[13:17] intelligence
[13:18] he's a reflection of the knowledge of
[13:20] god in the will of god that adam
[13:22] was not just uh the the next step as it
[13:25] were like well what can i do next what
[13:27] can i do if i've built how can i improve
[13:29] on on what i did last time and all we
[13:31] created animals and we created all the
[13:32] way up to this
[13:33] beast-like serpent and oh you know what
[13:35] let's put a soul inside of him and let's
[13:37] let's make that the next step no god all
[13:40] along
[13:40] was operating according to a purpose and
[13:42] a plan
[13:44] and so it says to this man and now i'm
[13:46] just going over these not to
[13:48] teach you because i know that you know
[13:50] these things but rather
[13:52] just to think ponder how that satan
[13:54] lucifer
[13:55] would have heard these things or had
[13:56] some knowledge of these things
[13:58] so the man is told to be fruitful which
[14:00] means branch off multiply which means
[14:03] become many
[14:04] and then the word replenish this really
[14:06] holds to me like the
[14:08] the the the the glue that just kind of
[14:11] holds
[14:11] brings those two together he's to branch
[14:13] off
[14:15] he's to become many and he's to
[14:18] replenish
[14:18] that doesn't mean just stack up bodies
[14:20] like cord wood
[14:22] until there's no more space upon the
[14:23] earth but it means accomplish
[14:25] it replenish the earth it means com
[14:27] accomplish or satisfy
[14:29] the earth so god had a desire that he
[14:33] wanted to achieve
[14:34] you can look at it in the sense that god
[14:36] had in his mind
[14:38] two million people and so to replenish
[14:40] the earth would be to bring
[14:42] that to two million bring the people to
[14:46] that place where you have
[14:48] you have that many am i already at an
[14:49] hour that's my timer
[14:52] take the name of jesus we will just pick
[14:55] up next time
[14:57] you can just turn it right off it's not
[14:59] going to bother me guess what i'm going
[15:00] to do it
[15:01] look at that let's see how long that
[15:04] lasts
[15:05] it usually lets me know when there's
[15:06] been an hour up and i start thinking i
[15:08] better hurry up but now i don't have
[15:10] that today
[15:10] take a deep breath stretch a little bit
[15:14] take a five hour energy i don't know can
[15:17] you remember where i was so here we are
[15:18] re replenish the earth you could look at
[15:21] in this sense that means to fill it up
[15:22] to its completion
[15:24] so it's not just merely make use of
[15:26] every single inch of space
[15:28] but rather if god had in his mind and
[15:30] i'm just using this hypothetically
[15:32] had in his mind that there would be 2
[15:33] 000 names written on the lamb's book of
[15:36] life
[15:36] he says bring those names forth and then
[15:38] once each one has been represented it's
[15:40] replenished
[15:42] like it's not just keep going in
[15:43] perpetuity but fill it up to my desire
[15:45] to what i've
[15:46] what i have in my mind if there's a
[15:47] dinner and there's 50 spaces
[15:49] at the table then it's replenished when
[15:51] all 50 take their seat
[15:53] and it has this meaning to accomplish or
[15:55] satisfy
[15:56] the earth so adam was to multiply
[16:00] be fruitful multiply and replenish or
[16:03] satisfy the earth
[16:05] satisfy the earth's purpose wow that's
[16:08] beautiful
[16:10] and if i get excited if you all you can
[16:13] do is get excited for me that'll work
[16:16] and so just so now we know the earth had
[16:18] a hidden purpose
[16:19] what was the purpose of the earth to get
[16:21] a bride out of it plain and that's
[16:23] exactly
[16:23] what god's purpose of creating the earth
[16:25] was for is to get a bride of his own
[16:27] choosing
[16:27] to get a bride out of it so just like
[16:29] the earth had a hidden purpose
[16:31] the woman now because she's represented
[16:33] in this male and female the woman held
[16:35] the mystery
[16:36] of god's heart purpose so satan looking
[16:39] at the man
[16:40] knows he's under a commandment to be
[16:42] fruitful multiply and replenish the
[16:43] earth
[16:44] and he's asking himself how is he going
[16:46] to do it
[16:48] he sees how it's represented in creation
[16:50] male female male female male female but
[16:52] now
[16:52] how is adam going to do it now brother
[16:55] branham writes this
[16:56] he says the first son adam was the
[16:57] spoken seed word of god
[16:59] he was given a bride to reproduce
[17:02] himself
[17:03] that is why the bride was given to him
[17:05] now we're not reading this to understand
[17:07] historical record
[17:08] purpose divine knowledge understanding
[17:10] to know god's will that is why the bride
[17:13] was given to him
[17:14] to reproduce himself to produce another
[17:17] son of god so genesis 1 28
[17:20] was a god's commission as brother bannon
[17:23] called it god's commission
[17:24] he called it an oncoming thing a promise
[17:27] so this was a promise that adam
[17:29] was to take through the woman he was to
[17:31] reproduce himself
[17:33] produce another son of god so adam being
[17:36] in the image of the son of god or
[17:38] in the image of god needed the woman or
[17:41] the female part in order to bring forth
[17:44] another son of god that's the reason why
[17:47] the woman was taken out of the man
[17:49] so satan is watching this and i wanted
[17:52] to put us in this
[17:53] standpoint of this beast in the
[17:54] beginning so then brother banner makes
[17:56] this statement the word that god spoke
[17:58] to multiply and replenish the earth
[18:00] it couldn't find a place to land
[18:04] in other words when the woman began to
[18:06] bring forth children
[18:08] she did not fulfill god's commission of
[18:10] genesis 1 28.
[18:12] when she had children and no matter how
[18:13] many children she had
[18:15] regardless of who the father of the
[18:17] children was it did not
[18:19] fulfill genesis 1 28 because god's word
[18:22] has to be in its season
[18:24] has to be the right person the right
[18:25] season and we know all those mosques
[18:28] that have to line up for god's word to
[18:29] be complete
[18:30] so brother branham says this prophecy
[18:32] and he takes handkerchiefs
[18:34] and and i wasn't there to see it you say
[18:37] well you look
[18:38] you look old but not that old i wasn't
[18:40] there to see brother graham demonstrate
[18:41] this unfortunately there's not a video
[18:43] of it
[18:43] and i always appreciate whether it be
[18:44] brother billy paul or brother george and
[18:46] different ones share with you what
[18:48] brother branham actually drew on the
[18:50] the white board or chalkboard and
[18:51] different things to know but he's using
[18:53] a handkerchief
[18:54] and the way it strikes me is he says
[18:56] here's this promise be fruitful multiply
[18:58] and replenish the earth
[18:59] and that never was fulfilled by the
[19:01] woman he said it just
[19:03] laid their dormant all the time it
[19:05] couldn't find a place to land
[19:08] so realize now the commission of god
[19:11] and the will of god and the desire of
[19:13] god for
[19:14] the man is never fulfilled in genesis 1
[19:17] 2 or 3 or 4 5 6 or any of those
[19:20] it's not fulfilled in the beginning
[19:23] and so it's lays there couldn't find a
[19:25] place to land and then brother branham
[19:27] in part two of spoken words the original
[19:28] seed
[19:29] in the afternoon he says the life sperm
[19:31] of eve never happened
[19:34] so there was something that was given to
[19:36] eve there was
[19:37] the woman had was committed certain
[19:40] attributes certain characteristics
[19:43] and it held a promise or a potential and
[19:46] he's saying the life
[19:47] that she was to bring forth never
[19:49] happened even though she
[19:50] had gotten life from the lord it wasn't
[19:53] according to god's commission
[19:55] it wasn't according to genesis 1 28. so
[19:57] that word couldn't find a place to land
[19:59] the life the the egg the life of eve
[20:02] that she was to bring forth
[20:03] never happened why why did it not happen
[20:06] because satan caused the woman to fall
[20:09] through deception
[20:11] he he met her and defiled her mind
[20:15] and then through that mind came forth an
[20:17] act that caused her to fall now
[20:22] this speaks to the the connection is
[20:26] this is why satan did what he did
[20:29] he knew the woman's under this
[20:30] commandment this is god's commission
[20:32] this is a promise so satan's going to
[20:35] try to cause confusion about the promise
[20:37] satan's going to try to now not as a
[20:39] creator but as a deformer he realizes
[20:42] life has to come forth from this woman
[20:44] so i i want to be able to create i want
[20:47] to be able
[20:48] to have life so he goes he's trying to
[20:50] find the source of life
[20:53] now in genesis chapter 3 verse 1 he says
[20:56] now the serpent was more
[20:57] subtle than any beast of the field he
[21:00] was shrewd he was crafty
[21:02] he was intelligent it doesn't mean
[21:04] shrewd and that you would look at him
[21:05] say oh my god this guy looks like a
[21:07] shyster
[21:08] but rather he would have been someone
[21:09] that was intelligent articulate he could
[21:11] talk
[21:11] he is more subtle than any beast of the
[21:13] field and we know that it speaks to his
[21:15] intelligence
[21:16] and the way he would work and the way he
[21:17] would think and that it would have been
[21:19] something that would have looked
[21:20] human-like otherwise
[21:22] genesis chapter 3 verse 2 would have
[21:23] been
[21:26] right because the snake just talked to
[21:27] me but we know it doesn't unfold that
[21:29] way
[21:30] so he says the serpent was more subtle
[21:32] than any beast of the field which the
[21:33] lord god had made he's a
[21:35] he's an upright creature he looks
[21:37] man-like he can talk he was
[21:39] had a duty that he had to fulfill in the
[21:40] garden he said unto the woman
[21:42] yea hath god said you shall not eat
[21:46] of every tree of the garden it's a
[21:48] question he wants to know
[21:51] what did god say to you about trees
[21:55] what trees are you allowed to eat of
[21:58] what trees are you allowed to partake in
[22:01] and we must think more deeply about this
[22:03] we know there's more to this
[22:05] than what the denominations teach and
[22:07] and their theological conundrum
[22:09] is what kind of fruit it was
[22:11] [Music]
[22:12] apricot pear apple but we know it's more
[22:16] than that
[22:17] and we've got to think maturely to catch
[22:19] the revelation of this question
[22:22] is satan just coming and wanting to know
[22:25] what fruits she's allowed to eat
[22:28] is he just there uh wanting to know
[22:31] which trees
[22:32] hey i haven't been here before what's
[22:33] good all right we go to a restaurant we
[22:36] ask what's good
[22:37] and the worst answer is when the server
[22:39] goes oh i don't know i really don't eat
[22:40] here you're like oh
[22:43] the one person who's been in the kitchen
[22:44] doesn't eat here okay
[22:47] what satan is doing is he's asking about
[22:49] life
[22:50] he's asking about creations and he's not
[22:54] asking a question about literal trees
[22:55] and literal fruit or permissible diet
[22:58] he's wanting to know about life and how
[22:59] it comes forth he's wanting to know
[23:01] about something more substantial
[23:03] than just what you should eat in isaiah
[23:05] chapter 14 verses 12 to 14 and i know
[23:07] that some of this is review
[23:09] from last time speaking to satan and
[23:11] lucifer how thou
[23:12] art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer
[23:16] son of the morning howarth thou cut
[23:19] down to the ground now what does the
[23:21] scripture do
[23:22] it takes lucifer and it joins him to the
[23:25] serpent which is what
[23:27] cut down to the ground on thy belly
[23:28] they'll crawl the rest of thy life
[23:30] so the scripture now later on is making
[23:33] this direct
[23:33] connection that it's just not a beast in
[23:36] the field a beast there in
[23:38] in uh the garden of eden but rather
[23:40] satan has taken control of this beast
[23:42] so how can he do that remember those
[23:44] evil spirits entered into swine
[23:47] the bible even says and we'll maybe go
[23:48] into more detail on this later
[23:50] how that satan having entered into judas
[23:54] so he realized it's not it's not a
[23:55] scriptural prohibition that satan would
[23:57] be in the garden of eden because he said
[23:59] to be in the garden of eden
[24:00] nor is it prohibited that he would
[24:01] possess the serpent to cause him
[24:04] to make eve fall and here it says now
[24:06] you were cut
[24:07] down to the ground so by allegory or
[24:10] symbolically satan is cut down to the
[24:12] ground
[24:12] when the serpent is cut down to the
[24:14] ground so now it
[24:16] continues lucifer he said you've been
[24:18] cut down to the ground which did this
[24:20] weaken the nations so satan weakened or
[24:23] disabled the nations and that means
[24:25] humanity
[24:27] and the the serpent who's cut down to
[24:29] the ground
[24:30] he is characterized as having weakened
[24:32] the nations and then verse 13
[24:34] for so through and because of this
[24:37] you weakened humanity because thou said
[24:40] in thy heart
[24:42] i will ascend into heaven i will exalt
[24:44] my throne above the stars of god which
[24:46] is are the sons and daughters of god
[24:48] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[24:50] congregation we realize there's more
[24:52] symbolic meaning to this
[24:54] than a literal congregation or a
[24:56] mountain and a congregation on it
[24:57] in the sides of the north it speaks of
[24:59] procreation
[25:01] a secret place i will ascend above the
[25:03] heights of the clouds
[25:04] i will be like the most high so because
[25:08] of this ambition in verses 13 and 14
[25:11] he weakened the nations this is exactly
[25:14] what the bible's telling us
[25:15] he wanted to be like the most high he
[25:17] wanted that secret place he wanted to
[25:19] have the ability
[25:20] to procreate he wanted this mount of the
[25:22] congregation the sides of the north he
[25:23] wanted to be as the god before the
[25:25] children of god he wanted to be their
[25:27] father
[25:28] he wanted to be the first he wanted to
[25:30] be above them so what he does then is he
[25:32] comes in
[25:33] and according to this ambition of verse
[25:35] 13 and 14
[25:36] he weakened humanity so this being part
[25:40] of his ambition
[25:41] he he comes to the woman and the devil's
[25:45] question
[25:46] was regarding whether this woman knew
[25:48] the secret of life
[25:51] he was asking this woman whether or not
[25:53] she held the secret for eternal life
[25:58] and i i'm not i can't speak in absolute
[26:01] terms
[26:01] because again i wasn't there but
[26:06] it satan wouldn't have known everything
[26:08] so he's
[26:09] he's trying to find out remember just
[26:12] like he did jesus
[26:14] if thou be could you be
[26:18] i mean he's looking like why why was
[26:20] abel immediately murdered by cain
[26:23] he's wondering is this the seed is this
[26:25] the one
[26:26] who is it who's my competition who do i
[26:29] need to destroy
[26:30] because i want to be the preeminent one
[26:32] i want to be the the one that holds the
[26:34] key
[26:35] and so he goes to the woman and he
[26:37] didn't attack the man
[26:39] but he goes to the woman and he begins
[26:40] to ask her do you have
[26:42] knowledge of this he knew she was given
[26:46] to the man for genesis
[26:48] for genesis 1 28 he knew that the woman
[26:51] came forth
[26:52] to fulfill be fruitful multiply and
[26:54] replenish the earth he knew that she had
[26:56] something to do with creation
[26:58] she had something to do with bringing
[26:59] forth of life she had something to do
[27:02] with finishing and fulfilling god's
[27:04] purpose replenishing the
[27:06] earth now
[27:10] if you're if you still have your bibles
[27:12] handy and i i apologize not having a
[27:14] a slideshow today brother tom asked me
[27:17] you're gonna have a slideshow today i
[27:18] said no i'm not going to have a
[27:19] slideshow
[27:20] he thought i was taking umbrage to the
[27:23] use of
[27:23] slide show like i only use slide decks
[27:26] no i just i don't i don't have a
[27:27] powerpoint presentation i don't have
[27:29] anything to show you today i apologize
[27:30] but i will make these notes available if
[27:32] you need them
[27:33] and he says this and let's look at
[27:35] genesis chapter 2 verses 17 to 18
[27:39] because now we're getting down to the
[27:41] question you shall
[27:42] eat of every tree of the garden what
[27:43] trees can you eat of in verse
[27:45] this is very um very astounding
[27:48] and if you've never connected these
[27:50] things together we we want we want god
[27:53] to connect dots for you today so now
[27:56] this is what the woman is told the man
[27:58] and the woman are told to given this
[27:59] commandment the male and female the man
[28:01] being in the image of god
[28:03] genesis chapter 2 verses 17 and 18. but
[28:05] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[28:07] evil
[28:08] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[28:10] that thou eat us thereof
[28:11] thou shalt surely die
[28:15] so the tree of knowledge of good and
[28:16] evil is a tree of death potentially
[28:21] there's a there's an eating a partaking
[28:24] of this tree that will result in death
[28:25] the day you eat this
[28:26] you will die so god gives this
[28:28] prohibition genesis 2 17
[28:30] if you eat of the tree of knowledge of
[28:32] good and evil you will
[28:33] in that day you shall surely die
[28:37] and now there's a conjunction
[28:41] this is going to seem very very odd for
[28:42] god to join the two thoughts together
[28:45] and the lord god said it is not good
[28:47] that man should be alone
[28:48] i will make him a help meet for him
[28:52] so satan is watching this progression
[28:55] and satan is watching as god creates
[28:59] and when the tree of knowledge of good
[29:01] and evil is characterized as a tree of
[29:03] death potentially
[29:04] and then god immediately gives the
[29:07] introduction to the need for a woman
[29:09] satan is now making a connection of what
[29:11] this woman represents
[29:13] and what this tree of knowledge of good
[29:15] and evil potentially represents to the
[29:17] man and the woman
[29:18] because to this to this point if satan
[29:21] never knew that there was another
[29:22] attribute of god that was going to be
[29:23] expressed
[29:24] apart from even adam now he realizes
[29:27] it's not good for man to be alone
[29:29] i will create a help meet for him
[29:32] i will create a second self someone
[29:34] who's equal but opposite someone who's
[29:36] complementary to his purpose
[29:38] someone that's going to help him achieve
[29:41] genesis 1 28
[29:43] and it comes immediately after genesis 2
[29:45] 17 not that satan was reading the bible
[29:47] then
[29:48] but he sees the command don't eat of
[29:49] this tree the tree of knowledge of good
[29:50] and evil
[29:51] the day that you eat thereof you are not
[29:52] to eat of it if you eat of it that day
[29:54] you'll die
[29:55] and it's not good for man to be alone i
[29:57] will make him
[29:58] a mere self so satan's watching this
[30:03] now in the message marriage and divorce
[30:05] and boy i think that's a sermon that's
[30:07] really really we kind of really missed
[30:09] the whole point
[30:11] you know all the guys walk away saying
[30:13] he can he can he can
[30:15] you know right i can i can you can't i
[30:18] can't
[30:19] and that's all they get out of it and i
[30:21] feel like they didn't get
[30:22] anything out of it if that's all you got
[30:25] out of it
[30:26] i think at the very least what you
[30:27] should get out of is never do such a
[30:29] thing as that again
[30:30] and teach your children not to do it hey
[30:33] if we're all
[30:34] if we were all sitting around in 1965
[30:37] then we could say you know go remain as
[30:40] you are
[30:40] and we would have consequences that we
[30:42] have to deal with but listen
[30:44] the commandment that was given in that
[30:46] from from god
[30:47] the grace that he gave to his people had
[30:50] a part to say go
[30:51] remain as you are but then this
[30:53] commandment to us
[30:54] as believers as sons and daughters of
[30:56] god was to never do
[30:58] something like that and teach your
[31:00] children not to do it
[31:03] i do not believe that what that did is
[31:05] give me as a man
[31:06] a card that i can play as a message
[31:09] believer
[31:10] that if my wife gets out of line
[31:13] i can play it
[31:17] a man told me one time he said you know
[31:20] based upon these things that
[31:22] if your wife ever tells you if you ask
[31:24] her to do something if she ever tells
[31:25] you
[31:26] that she's going to pray about it you
[31:27] have a right to divorce her right there
[31:30] and my immediate thought was i really
[31:32] feel sorry for your wife
[31:35] and i thought well no i wouldn't would
[31:38] divorce her
[31:40] so in reading this apologize for the
[31:42] detour there
[31:43] marriage and divorce holds so much more
[31:44] truth for us
[31:46] than who can marry who can remarry who
[31:48] can divorce all those things
[31:50] every man that's born of a woman is born
[31:52] in death as soon as he comes
[31:54] is that true bible teaches these things
[31:56] but when he is born into the creation of
[31:58] god he cannot die
[32:00] in the beginning god created the heavens
[32:02] and the earth in the beginning was the
[32:04] word
[32:05] and the word was with god and the word
[32:06] was god in the beginning of the creation
[32:10] jesus christ who is the beginning of the
[32:12] creation
[32:13] of god we had a creation that unfolds
[32:17] for now jesus christ is the beginning of
[32:19] the creation of god
[32:20] now in the beginning when god created
[32:22] that established one thing
[32:23] right but now the beginning of the
[32:26] creation of god is something different
[32:29] so he says but when a man is born into
[32:30] the creature of god he cannot die
[32:32] he is from that other tree that was in
[32:35] the garden of eden
[32:36] christ eternal life comes by the tree
[32:40] oh you say she was a tree sure well they
[32:43] said thou shalt not take of this tree
[32:45] god said in genesis back there thou
[32:47] shall not take of this tree
[32:49] well this woman is the tree she is the
[32:52] fruit tree
[32:53] you're the fruit of your mother the
[32:55] fruit of the womb is you
[32:56] that's right and then the fruit of the
[32:59] tree of life that was in the garden of
[33:01] eden is christ
[33:02] through the woman come death through the
[33:05] man in the original creation
[33:06] come life to be born of a woman is
[33:10] death to be born of christ is life
[33:14] so if if i could try just to unpack that
[33:17] very quickly
[33:18] in this way not adding to not trying to
[33:20] clarify i think brother branham says it
[33:22] very very well
[33:23] but maybe just to rearrange it he is
[33:25] saying that jesus christ
[33:28] is the eternal is is the fruit of the
[33:31] tree of life
[33:33] he's placing him as the tree of life in
[33:35] the garden
[33:36] there's christ as a tree of life he's
[33:38] saying the woman is also
[33:39] a tree now he's looking at it now
[33:43] in the sense that you have and there are
[33:45] trees
[33:46] in creation now today where you have a
[33:48] male and a female of the trees
[33:51] and they had recently found two
[33:53] thousand-year-old
[33:54] uh fig tree seeds from israel
[33:58] and a group of scientists in israel
[33:59] begged
[34:01] those who had these seeds please give us
[34:03] a chance
[34:04] to try to allow these seeds to
[34:07] to to grow to bring them to life is that
[34:09] even possibly yes
[34:10] seeds are amazing let us have them we
[34:13] can let them come
[34:14] and in this particular specie of tree
[34:16] there's male and female
[34:17] and if you have the male you can't bring
[34:19] forth fruit unless you have the female
[34:21] that's pollinated by the male and so
[34:25] brother branham is correctly identifying
[34:27] now in a type
[34:29] that you have the woman as a tree but
[34:32] yet then you have another tree
[34:34] but in order for there to be fruit there
[34:37] has to be pollination
[34:38] there has to be both so he's saying the
[34:40] woman was a tree in the garden
[34:42] and then the tree of life represents
[34:44] christ
[34:46] and the fruit of that tree would be
[34:47] eternal life which is christ it's all
[34:49] one life
[34:50] not a different life if you have eternal
[34:51] life you have the life of
[34:54] christ so there's these this
[34:57] woman through the woman in the beginning
[35:00] she brought forth death as a tree
[35:03] but the man who spoken of that's
[35:05] represented there in genesis chapter 1
[35:07] that is christ who is of the original
[35:09] creation there come forth
[35:11] life so to be born of a woman is death
[35:12] to be born of christ is life
[35:14] so the tree of life equals eternal life
[35:17] and now the woman
[35:21] is a redesigned tree because satan is
[35:25] her designer
[35:26] right so now the woman had this
[35:28] potential she had these attributes she
[35:30] had these characteristics that she must
[35:31] not defile
[35:32] but now through the knowledge the tree
[35:34] of knowledge of good and evil
[35:35] she doesn't produce the fruit that she
[35:38] ought to produce
[35:40] she produces a hybrid fruit a different
[35:43] kind of fruit so she's a tree
[35:44] but yet the tree has now lost its
[35:46] correct representation
[35:48] so going back to genesis chapter 3 verse
[35:50] 1
[35:52] i'm going to ask you personally are you
[35:53] following me so far
[35:55] okay good if i haven't told you the
[35:57] story before i asked
[35:58] a church one time and said i said
[36:01] is everyone following me and nobody said
[36:03] anything
[36:04] and i almost got discouraged and i
[36:06] realized this is a sharp group of people
[36:08] no one can answer for everyone
[36:12] so nobody said anything so i said are
[36:15] you
[36:15] following me resounding yes and i was
[36:17] like oh these these people are really
[36:18] sharp
[36:21] you're really sharp so the question
[36:24] yeah hath god said you shall not eat of
[36:26] every tree of the garden
[36:28] what is he trying to do discover the
[36:30] secret of life
[36:31] trying to understand the tree trying to
[36:34] understand the commandment
[36:36] the tree satan wanted to get to was the
[36:39] tree of life
[36:40] now do you think satan knows that knows
[36:42] what it is how it's represented how it's
[36:44] manifested like he's over there looking
[36:46] at this tree of life going
[36:47] uh if i could just have that tree of
[36:48] life god is hiding things
[36:53] and satan cannot create he can only
[36:55] pervert so he's want to know
[36:56] how can i gain access to the tree of
[36:58] life
[37:00] if i can do that according to genesis 1
[37:04] 11
[37:05] each seed is as in each species to bring
[37:07] forth the life
[37:08] after its kind that's god's law of
[37:10] product reproduction
[37:12] let each specie bring forth of its kind
[37:14] of the seed that's within itself
[37:16] if he could just find that seed and
[37:18] somehow attach himself to it through the
[37:20] serpent
[37:21] then i'll have access to this eternal
[37:23] life
[37:25] and so this woman that came out of man
[37:27] he's asking himself
[37:28] does she hold the secret to creative
[37:30] power
[37:32] it looked like the woman would be the
[37:35] one and
[37:36] if you want to say brother aaron you're
[37:37] just it's just conjecture you're just
[37:38] supposing
[37:40] and i'll admit that but notice satan
[37:42] goes to her
[37:43] starts asking the question about fruit
[37:45] of trees
[37:47] and he's looking to her could she be the
[37:49] one that's to bring forth
[37:51] another son of god is she the one that's
[37:54] going to bring forth the promised one
[37:58] and so the question is asked yeah hath
[37:59] god said you shall not eat of every tree
[38:01] of the garden
[38:02] verse 2 is not it's and the woman said
[38:05] unto the serpent
[38:07] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[38:09] the garden which
[38:10] is true the bible said every tree that
[38:12] grows out of the ground is good for food
[38:14] so she's referring to fruit trees yes
[38:17] but
[38:19] notice the language here it's important
[38:20] but the fruit of the tree which is in
[38:22] the midst of the garden
[38:24] god hath said you shall not eat of it
[38:26] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[38:29] so now she's using a singular reference
[38:32] the tree
[38:34] referring to it as being in the midst of
[38:35] the garden but she says it's
[38:37] death if you eat it i want to point this
[38:41] out
[38:41] eve is confused about the promise and
[38:44] the confusion stems
[38:46] from satan's reasoning
[38:49] she knew by the devil's question he's
[38:51] asking about more than just fruit
[38:54] so she gets down to this it's about life
[38:57] and death
[38:59] and the if i could say this the
[39:01] conversation is allegorical
[39:03] i wouldn't even i'm not even suggesting
[39:05] that this is the literal conversation
[39:08] but this is the way it's described and
[39:10] if we take it literal
[39:12] we think that satan was actually
[39:14] peddling apples
[39:16] he was the original johnny appleseed
[39:19] almost said serpent seed
[39:21] he's the original here he is hey you
[39:23] know would be a great idea you don't you
[39:25] can't imagine the things you can get out
[39:26] of apples cider
[39:28] pies cobblers but it was
[39:32] there's this it's symbolically
[39:33] represented so now in
[39:35] satan's questioning about life she's
[39:37] saying now there's fruit trees we can
[39:39] eat of but now there's a tree in the
[39:41] midst of the garden
[39:42] and if i eat of that tree the tree
[39:45] that's in the midst of the garden
[39:46] then she says i can't even touch it lest
[39:48] we die even though the part about
[39:50] touching it's not even mentioned in the
[39:51] commandment
[39:52] which isn't it amazing that it comes to
[39:55] the book of life that sealed
[39:56] i can't even touch it let alone look on
[39:58] it
[40:00] so this tree of life the book of life
[40:02] the ceiling of the mystery
[40:03] there's this congruency in genesis to
[40:05] revelation
[40:06] so she knew he's asking about life and
[40:08] death now notice this about the trees
[40:11] genesis chapter 2 verses 8 and 9.
[40:14] she says the fruit of the tree which is
[40:15] in the midst of the garden
[40:17] if you eat it you die now watch this
[40:20] genesis 2 8 9
[40:21] and the lord god planted a garden
[40:23] eastward in eden
[40:25] i would love to expound upon this more
[40:27] in the future this is symbolic of a
[40:29] spouse
[40:31] a garden is representative of a wife so
[40:33] eastward in
[40:34] in storytelling is also used
[40:37] allegorically of the beginning
[40:39] eastward at the beginning of eden god
[40:41] had already planted a garden which
[40:43] represented a wife
[40:44] it represented the bride that he wanted
[40:45] to have and then it says and there he
[40:48] put the man
[40:48] whom he had formed what is he
[40:50] foreshadowing that he
[40:52] is going to be in her this union of
[40:55] of husband and wife bridegroom bride
[40:57] christ and the woman
[40:59] in his bride and then verse 9 and out of
[41:01] the ground made the lord god to grow
[41:03] every tree that is pleasant to the sight
[41:07] now this means to the natural eye
[41:10] that it was pleasing that you look and
[41:13] say
[41:14] wow this fruit looks appetizing there's
[41:17] a lot of things we eat and we ask
[41:18] ourselves
[41:19] whoever took the first bite right
[41:21] because it just doesn't even look good
[41:22] to us
[41:23] but there's other things we're looking
[41:24] at oh wow this is appetizing
[41:27] and that's what it means it means to the
[41:28] mind to the eye it looked visually
[41:30] pleasing
[41:31] but after satan is done talking to the
[41:33] woman and she sees the
[41:34] tree and sees that it was pleasant to
[41:37] her eyes
[41:38] and the language that's used there has
[41:39] nothing to do with the mint
[41:41] the part that would say to the eye as it
[41:43] struck the eye it was pleasant looking
[41:44] fruit
[41:45] it speaks of something being stirred up
[41:47] within her lust it was pleasant to her
[41:49] desires
[41:51] so the bible tells us that if a tree
[41:53] goes out of the ground
[41:54] it's pleasant to look upon visually and
[41:57] good
[41:58] for food so god was not intentionally
[42:01] trying to trick adam and eve
[42:03] by causing every tree that grew out of
[42:05] the ground to be good for food
[42:07] telling them it's good for food and then
[42:09] actually saying but there's two of them
[42:10] that aren't figure it out
[42:13] if it was a literal tree that grew out
[42:15] of the ground it was good for food
[42:16] next notice what it says here
[42:21] the tree of life also in the midst of
[42:24] the garden
[42:25] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[42:27] evil it's the tree of life that is
[42:29] characterized as being in the midst of
[42:31] the garden
[42:34] the other tree is the tree of knowledge
[42:35] of good and evil now god does not
[42:38] characterize the tree of knowledge of
[42:39] good evil being in the midst of the
[42:41] garden
[42:41] it's the tree of life that's in the
[42:43] midst of the garden
[42:45] but when satan asks the woman about the
[42:48] tree
[42:49] about eating fruit of the trees she says
[42:51] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[42:53] the midst of the garden
[42:55] she says i can't eat it but if i do i'll
[42:57] die but she's actually referring to
[42:59] genesis 2 17
[43:01] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[43:03] if you eat that
[43:04] you die it's eating of this tree of
[43:07] knowledge of good and evil
[43:08] in genesis 2 17 that god says results in
[43:11] death if you eat it
[43:13] now i know this is teaching in genesis
[43:16] chapter 3 verses 22 to 24 can i entice
[43:19] you with the promise of brisket
[43:20] in a little while
[43:24] if you can hold out to the end i'll tell
[43:25] you the address of where the luncheon is
[43:28] genesis chapter 3 verses 22 to 24. now
[43:31] pay attention to this
[43:33] now this is after the fall after they've
[43:35] eaten of the tree of knowledge of good
[43:36] and evil
[43:37] and the lord god said behold the man has
[43:39] become as one of us to know good and
[43:41] evil
[43:41] now lest he put forth his hand and take
[43:44] also of the tree of life and eat and
[43:47] live forever
[43:49] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[43:50] from the garden of eden to till the
[43:52] ground from whence he was taken
[43:53] so he drove out the man and he placed at
[43:55] the east of the garden of eden
[43:57] cherubims a flame and a flaming sword
[44:00] which turned every way
[44:02] guarding all four sides to keep the way
[44:04] of the tree of life
[44:07] this is again symbolic language pointing
[44:09] to who
[44:10] christ i am the way the truth the life
[44:13] this is christ the mystery of god in
[44:16] genesis 3 22-24
[44:18] it is the same christ the mystery of god
[44:20] who's the seed of the woman in genesis 3
[44:21] 15.
[44:22] it is all portraying and representing
[44:24] christ who is in the image of god
[44:26] male and female whom the bride is
[44:28] embodied within
[44:30] so now after man has eaten of the tree
[44:32] of knowledge of good and evil
[44:34] he's told they're going to guard the way
[44:36] from the seed this power this life of
[44:38] the tree of life
[44:39] because it's repre symbolically now if
[44:41] he takes of the tree of life
[44:43] he will eat and live forever so i want
[44:46] you to notice that when eve says if you
[44:48] eat of the fruit of the tree which is in
[44:49] the midst of the garden
[44:51] which was the tree of life she says if
[44:52] you eat that you die
[44:54] she's confused on the promise
[44:59] so satan says in genesis 3 4-5
[45:03] there's a tree that you eat and if you
[45:05] eat it you don't die right
[45:07] you actually live forever then there's
[45:09] another tree
[45:10] that if you eat and you partake of it
[45:12] that day you die
[45:13] so notice what satan's response is and
[45:15] the serpent said to the woman ye shall
[45:17] not surely die
[45:20] so notice how he's trying to create
[45:22] confusion
[45:23] about the tree of knowledge of good and
[45:25] evil and the tree of life
[45:27] if she says if i eat of the tree of in
[45:30] the midst of the garden
[45:32] and she's thinking that the tree in the
[45:33] midst of the garden is the tree of
[45:35] knowledge of good and evil
[45:36] and satan knows no the tree in the midst
[45:38] is a tree of life that's what i'm trying
[45:39] to find
[45:40] then he says well no if you eat that you
[45:42] won't die
[45:46] thinking about this this is how shrewd
[45:48] satan is
[45:49] this is how he lies now he tries to
[45:51] confuse us in our minds and twist and
[45:53] pervert
[45:54] so he says you shall not surely die
[45:57] for god doth know that in the day you
[45:59] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[46:01] opened
[46:01] and you shall be as gods knowing good
[46:04] and evil
[46:06] so now he's perverting the tree of
[46:07] knowledge of good and evil saying no
[46:09] god doth no he's twisting the word to
[46:11] confuse the woman about the promise of
[46:13] life
[46:14] he's mixing the trees already in his
[46:15] conversation
[46:18] and he says god doth no he's trying to
[46:20] confuse her on this promise why
[46:22] he's wanting to destabilize her
[46:25] and he's actually trying to produce fear
[46:28] oh god hasn't told you everything
[46:31] oh you didn't know god knows this is why
[46:33] god doesn't want you eat of that tree
[46:35] god knows that when you do you'll be
[46:36] like him he says ye shall be as gods the
[46:40] word god's there is elohim
[46:42] ye shall become as elohims little
[46:44] elohims you shall become
[46:46] sons and daughters of god why is this
[46:49] important
[46:50] this is exactly what satan's ambition
[46:52] was in isaiah 14 14
[46:54] i will be like the most high he's saying
[46:57] if you eat of this you will be like the
[46:58] most high
[46:59] he's projecting his inspiration his
[47:01] aspiration he's projecting his desire
[47:04] if you eat of that tree you'll be like
[47:06] the most high and he wants to be the
[47:08] progenitor of that he wants to be the
[47:10] father of that
[47:12] now when he says you shall be like the
[47:14] most high he's not only revealing his
[47:16] agenda
[47:17] but he's targeting god's ambition he's
[47:20] targeting the heart purpose of god and
[47:23] expo when he exposes his true motive
[47:25] because brother branham said it was
[47:26] god's purpose to bring forth a people
[47:29] like unto himself that would be a word
[47:32] bride so god's desire
[47:36] is that the people would be his gods
[47:39] god's desires that he would have a bride
[47:41] of his own choosing a people that would
[47:43] be
[47:44] like unto himself that would be like the
[47:45] most high god created the earth for a
[47:47] purpose
[47:48] to get a people who are like himself out
[47:50] of it to get a word bride
[47:52] in other words god wanted a god-like
[47:54] people
[47:55] he wanted a bribe that would be in his
[47:57] image and in his likeness there would be
[47:58] life of his life power of his power
[48:00] that's what god wanted so satan's not
[48:02] way off in left field
[48:04] about what god's ambition is but he's
[48:06] confusing the way to it
[48:08] he's obscuring the truth of it and he's
[48:10] actually enticing her to death not life
[48:16] the bible says in first timothy chapter
[48:18] 3 verse 16.
[48:20] and without controversy great is the
[48:22] mystery of godliness
[48:24] great is the mystery of equality with
[48:26] god great is the mystery of god-likeness
[48:28] god was manifested in the flesh
[48:31] justified in the spirit
[48:32] scene of angels preaching to gentiles
[48:34] believed on in the world received up in
[48:36] the glory
[48:37] who was this jesus christ
[48:41] the mystery of god likeness or equality
[48:42] was manifested in the man
[48:44] jesus christ who is that
[48:47] the last adam who is he connected with
[48:50] who does he represent the tree of life
[48:54] he's the the promise genesis 1 28
[48:57] be fruitful multiply and replenish earth
[49:00] that's god's original spoken word seed
[49:03] it never landed in the womb of a woman
[49:07] until mary received it
[49:11] one day genesis 1 28 the original spoken
[49:14] word seed caught in the womb of a
[49:16] fifteen-year-old girl
[49:18] so then the man that she brings forth is
[49:21] not like the fallen creation
[49:24] not coming through a redesigned tree as
[49:26] being part of her fruit but rather it's
[49:28] the seed of the woman apart from human
[49:30] instrumentality and it revives the
[49:32] commandment of genesis 1 20.
[49:33] it's the beginning of the creation of
[49:35] god why did it happen that way
[49:37] god wanted it that way god planted it
[49:40] that way
[49:41] the folly of man had to be manifested
[49:43] the sin of man had to be expressed there
[49:44] had to be death and disease and darkness
[49:47] and doubt and unbelief
[49:48] and failures and ups and downs and ups
[49:50] and downs in israel has chosen
[49:52] up and down and in and out finally
[49:53] restored back out again finally restored
[49:55] finally god's like you know what behold
[49:57] i send elijah the prophet
[49:58] i'm going to turn to the gentiles and
[50:01] then the very next chapter
[50:03] the very next book the birth of jesus
[50:06] was on this wise
[50:07] different than every other man that came
[50:09] before the child in her is conceived of
[50:11] the holy ghost
[50:13] so this is the mystery of god likeness
[50:15] this is the mystery of godliness
[50:18] manifested in the man christ jesus it's
[50:20] the same
[50:21] mystery of god-likeness or equality
[50:23] that's manifested in his bride in this
[50:24] last days
[50:26] ephesians chapter 5 verses 31-32 for
[50:29] this cause shall a man
[50:31] leave his father and mother and shall be
[50:33] joined unto his wife
[50:35] where does this phrase come from genesis
[50:36] chapter 2
[50:39] and they too shall be one flesh because
[50:41] what did adam say you are born of my
[50:42] bone
[50:43] flesh of my flesh you shall be called
[50:45] woman because you're taken
[50:47] from the man
[50:50] and so paul now picks up the mystery of
[50:52] genesis chapter 2
[50:54] speaking to the ephesians church which
[50:56] is the church that can be placed
[50:58] and he says for this cause shall a man
[50:59] leave his father and mother
[51:01] and shall be joined unto his wife and
[51:03] they too shall be one flesh
[51:05] has he not already said that no man had
[51:08] have ever yet
[51:08] hated his own flesh speaking about his
[51:11] wife
[51:12] who is this true of adam
[51:15] because let's be honest guys our wives
[51:18] are not
[51:19] literally our own flesh our own dna
[51:23] but the woman in the beginning was
[51:25] adam's flesh
[51:27] and the bride of christ is the flesh of
[51:29] christ
[51:31] so no man has ever yet hated his own
[51:33] flesh it speaks of adam and christ and
[51:35] what's their instinct to redeem
[51:37] not put away they too shall be one flesh
[51:41] and he says
[51:41] this is a great mystery but i speak
[51:43] concerning christ
[51:44] and the church not you men and your
[51:46] wives i speak of the great mystery
[51:48] which is christ and his bride that they
[51:51] shall be
[51:52] one flesh they will be power of his
[51:54] power life of his power
[51:55] she will be him
[52:00] elohim and elohir
[52:04] all right don't criticize me and get
[52:06] onto me for that it's just a play on
[52:08] words
[52:11] he's saying that this in the bride will
[52:12] be the original plan
[52:14] manifested the mystery finished
[52:17] she is him so he says you shall be as
[52:20] gods
[52:22] he's looking at he knows what god's
[52:24] desire is
[52:26] right equality a woman like unto himself
[52:30] he wants to become a bride so he has to
[52:33] first become a bridegroom
[52:35] he didn't become a woman first he became
[52:38] the man first
[52:39] why because god wanted to achieve a
[52:41] bride and the only way he could achieve
[52:42] a bride is become a bride
[52:45] he could just become a bride until he
[52:46] first became the bridegroom brother
[52:48] braham said in christ as a mystery he
[52:49] loved fatherhood
[52:50] in order for him to become a father he
[52:52] had to become the son
[52:53] of man so god has to become to fulfill
[52:56] his purpose
[52:58] so now we see this mystery of god
[52:59] likeness so he says ye
[53:01] shall not surely die he's using the
[53:05] characteristics of the tree of life
[53:08] in and twisting it with the tree of
[53:10] death tree of knowledge of good and evil
[53:12] he's trying to gain access to the power
[53:14] of that tree
[53:15] now we read this last time we start with
[53:17] the fact that there were two trees in
[53:19] the midst of the garden
[53:24] the tree of life was jesus the other
[53:27] tree is definitely satan
[53:29] because of what came forth of the fruit
[53:31] of that tree
[53:35] this was the fruit of that tree was the
[53:38] female tree mixing with the wrong tree
[53:40] that brought death
[53:41] right i mean the woman it was the woman
[53:45] conceived death she didn't
[53:48] she wasn't carrying death to begin with
[53:50] because that means death would have been
[53:51] an atom
[53:52] she had to conceive it so the wrong
[53:54] hybriding the mixed pollen
[53:56] pollenization now of trees using that
[53:58] type or that allegory
[54:00] so now he says the other tree is
[54:01] definitely satan because of the fruit of
[54:02] the tree that came forth it says now
[54:04] skipping a little bit now the word most
[54:07] definitely sets forth that from before
[54:09] the foundation of the earth the purpose
[54:11] of god was to share
[54:13] his eternal life with man
[54:16] so he wanted to have a means by which he
[54:18] could share eternal life
[54:21] and and i'm just going to inject this
[54:24] now
[54:25] god in order to share eternal life
[54:27] wanted to first
[54:28] deal with death
[54:32] just so that your eternal life can be so
[54:34] secure
[54:35] and so certain i'm gonna defeat death
[54:38] for you
[54:38] i'm gonna allow it to mature i'm allowed
[54:40] to come forth i'm allowed to seemingly
[54:42] burst forth first
[54:43] but i'm gonna hide a mystery in this
[54:45] listen no wonder god allowed adam and
[54:47] the woman to come forth and we all are
[54:49] represented in them
[54:50] that's our first birth but god hid the
[54:53] revelation of a second birth
[54:56] there's a new birth and i i wanted to
[54:58] maybe go down this line today
[55:00] that there is a new birth in christ to
[55:02] become a new creature
[55:04] old things are passed away behold all
[55:06] things are become new
[55:08] that's your promise that's what we ought
[55:10] to be tied to
[55:11] and that's why the most foul doctrine
[55:13] that can be perverted
[55:14] is the doctrine of the new birth you
[55:18] pervert that to the peril of god's seed
[55:20] because with the false revelation of the
[55:21] new birth the person can't come to life
[55:26] one of the most damnable heresies
[55:31] and so he says it's god's purpose
[55:34] to share his life with man eternal life
[55:37] with man
[55:37] and then and then i'm going to skip over
[55:39] it but he says and because of that
[55:41] it was necessary that god predestinated
[55:42] a man who required salvation to give him
[55:44] what
[55:44] reason to exist purpose of existing
[55:48] so he says thus what god worked out in
[55:50] here in the garden
[55:51] was his predestinated plan used satan's
[55:55] ambition against him
[55:56] he knew satan would go after that woman
[56:00] he knew that he could use satan's own
[56:03] ambition to bring forth the product
[56:06] that would need that only god could
[56:08] redeem
[56:11] god didn't god didn't make it wicked god
[56:14] didn't
[56:14] make it sick god didn't pervert it for
[56:17] you to go to him like some kind of
[56:18] master manipulator and some kind of
[56:20] control
[56:20] it's always making you feel sick and
[56:22] always making you feel broken and always
[56:23] making you feel like you need them
[56:25] brother
[56:25] satan played that part so you know who
[56:28] the true
[56:28] lover of your soul is the one who wants
[56:30] to feed you and heal you
[56:33] and anybody that always makes you feel
[56:35] broken so they can feel necessary
[56:37] is somebody you need to be armed linked
[56:38] with
[56:40] somebody always makes you feel
[56:41] compromised because they're the one that
[56:43] can give you relevance always makes you
[56:44] feel sick
[56:45] because they're the ones that got what
[56:46] you need to be healed always makes you
[56:48] feel broken because they're the ones
[56:49] that knows how to fix you
[56:50] there's one that knows that that's
[56:52] christ and he's not the breaker he's the
[56:54] healer
[56:55] the one that breaks you in order to fix
[56:57] you as someone who's got some kind of
[56:58] ulterior motive
[57:01] but god will let satan run amok so you
[57:03] can know who the real healer is
[57:06] i know it's a pair of dogs he said what
[57:09] god worked out here in the garden was
[57:10] his predestinated plan
[57:12] and when satan had brought about that
[57:13] which was necessary to the purpose of
[57:15] god
[57:16] then man could not get to that tree of
[57:18] life in the garden
[57:20] certainly not it was not time
[57:25] so god had represented somewhere somehow
[57:29] according to god's original spoken word
[57:31] seed there was going to be some
[57:33] access to that tree of life some access
[57:36] to eternal life
[57:37] some access to power in order to produce
[57:40] another son of god
[57:42] but he said it was not time god had an
[57:44] appointed time for this
[57:47] so now let's look at psalms chapter 1
[57:49] verses 1 to 3.
[57:50] aren't you glad i didn't say psalms 19.
[57:54] psalms chapter 1 verses 1 to 3 blessed
[57:56] is the man that walketh not in the
[57:58] counsel of the ungodly
[58:00] now we could even put the woman in this
[58:02] nor standeth in the way of sinners nor
[58:04] sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[58:05] we can actually look at the history of
[58:07] the antichrist how it
[58:09] it starts with the doctrine a deed
[58:12] then it becomes a doctrine then it
[58:13] becomes death
[58:16] you're walking in the council of the
[58:17] ungodly then you're standing in the way
[58:19] of sinners it becomes a doctrine a way
[58:20] of life it becomes binding
[58:22] and then it results in the seed of the
[58:23] scornful which is death it becomes
[58:24] enthroned in death
[58:26] crowned in death and you can actually
[58:28] see
[58:29] this scripture is psalms 1 1-3
[58:33] is speaking allegorically uh of this
[58:36] but his delight is in the law of the
[58:38] lord and in his law doth he meditate day
[58:39] and night the man who
[58:41] has rejected satan's lies the man who
[58:44] does not follow the council of the
[58:45] ungodly and because he does not follow
[58:47] the council of the ungodly he doesn't
[58:48] stand in the way of sinners
[58:50] and because he has not fought walked and
[58:52] has not stood then he's not crowned with
[58:54] death
[58:55] he doesn't sit in the seat of the critic
[58:57] he's not crowned with death
[58:59] he says but he delights in the law of
[59:01] the lord what god says what his
[59:02] commandments are don't do this don't do
[59:04] that
[59:04] he delights in them in the law doth he
[59:06] meditate day and night and he says and
[59:08] he shall be like a tree
[59:11] planted by the rivers of water that
[59:13] bringeth forth fruit
[59:15] in his season because what did brother
[59:18] brahm say
[59:19] he's now guarded the tree of life he
[59:22] says they couldn't get to it because it
[59:23] wasn't time
[59:26] so now he says he shall be like a tree
[59:29] planted by the rivers of water
[59:30] that bringeth forth his fruit in season
[59:33] his leaf
[59:33] also shall not wither and whatsoever he
[59:36] doeth shall
[59:37] prosper so now the man is described as a
[59:40] tree that's planted by rivers of water
[59:42] that has a season which his fruit is to
[59:43] come forth
[59:45] and genesis 2 10 says and a river went
[59:48] out of eden to water
[59:49] the garden
[59:53] and vincent was parted and became two
[59:55] heads
[59:57] in the garden where the tree of life was
[1:00:00] the tree of life in the midst of the
[1:00:02] garden it says there was a river that
[1:00:03] went out of eden to water the garden
[1:00:05] in the gardens where god put the man in
[1:00:07] the garden is where the tree of life is
[1:00:09] and now he's describing man as a tree of
[1:00:11] life that brings forth fruit in his
[1:00:13] season he's talking about christ
[1:00:17] so brother branham says in spoken words
[1:00:18] the original seed the life sperm of eve
[1:00:20] never happened it never did
[1:00:22] why she mingled it she kept it away
[1:00:26] and i know you're familiar with this
[1:00:28] statement brother man says eve would
[1:00:29] have finally
[1:00:30] brought that child forth
[1:00:35] eve would have eventually brought forth
[1:00:37] the word
[1:00:39] so the potential is there but then
[1:00:41] brother branson says mary is the one
[1:00:43] that brought forth eternal life
[1:00:44] right and then what did god write pick
[1:00:47] up your pen and write the word is in the
[1:00:48] bride
[1:00:49] as it was in mary oh wow
[1:00:53] this is really the puzzle just all these
[1:00:55] pieces coming together
[1:00:57] so he says it never happened she mingled
[1:00:59] it kept it away
[1:01:00] instead of adam coming to her for a
[1:01:02] bride
[1:01:03] when the time appointed would be
[1:01:06] so there was a time appointed for the
[1:01:08] tree of life to bring forth eternal life
[1:01:11] there was a time appointed to partake in
[1:01:13] it but brett says it wasn't
[1:01:14] time satan according to his own will and
[1:01:17] his own plan
[1:01:18] seems to interrupt god's plan but what
[1:01:21] happened
[1:01:21] what god worked out in the garden was
[1:01:23] his predestinated plan
[1:01:24] and once it was brought to pass what was
[1:01:26] necessary to give god purpose
[1:01:28] then man is now sealed off from the tree
[1:01:30] of life at that time
[1:01:33] until the appointed time so he says
[1:01:36] now he changed his picture just like
[1:01:38] christ would have come to the
[1:01:40] group who the next woman the church
[1:01:43] christ would have come to his church he
[1:01:45] promised to do it god
[1:01:47] promised to multiply but they had to
[1:01:49] wait until god's time
[1:01:52] so again when the woman comes forth
[1:01:53] that's one part
[1:01:55] but then there's a season there's an
[1:01:56] appointed time there's a predestinated
[1:01:58] purpose and plan
[1:01:59] in order for there to be oneness to
[1:02:01] finish god's purpose and he's saying
[1:02:03] christ would have come the bridegroom
[1:02:05] tree would have come to that bride tree
[1:02:07] on the day of pentecost but they didn't
[1:02:09] wait
[1:02:10] the bride tree comes forth at the birth
[1:02:12] of the church but they had to be with
[1:02:13] the bridegroom tree
[1:02:15] in order to bring forth the fruit that
[1:02:17] god intended for the tree
[1:02:21] they had to wait until god's time we see
[1:02:24] it in genesis chapter 18 verse 14
[1:02:26] which is one of the most outstanding
[1:02:28] scriptures to us in types for us in this
[1:02:30] message
[1:02:32] that you have the the image of three
[1:02:34] angels
[1:02:36] coming before abraham and his wife who
[1:02:38] are under a promise
[1:02:40] but seemingly with no way to bring it
[1:02:42] forth
[1:02:44] and it says he looked he saw three men
[1:02:46] that came
[1:02:48] and he says my lord because now he knows
[1:02:50] there's only one
[1:02:53] and as they come
[1:02:56] and they said unto him they said
[1:03:00] where is sarah thy wife
[1:03:04] so now one is the lord but all three are
[1:03:07] asking about the woman to whom the
[1:03:08] promise is given
[1:03:10] who's going to bring forth the son
[1:03:13] right and there's a prophecy
[1:03:17] the seed is not isaac
[1:03:21] the seed is christ right
[1:03:24] so it's not just the natural
[1:03:27] part the royal seat is being represented
[1:03:30] in this so all three want to know about
[1:03:32] sarah but notice only one has a message
[1:03:34] for
[1:03:35] everyone to talk about the church talk
[1:03:37] about the bride but only one had the
[1:03:38] message
[1:03:38] they said where's sarah and he said this
[1:03:41] now in verse 10 i will certainly return
[1:03:43] unto thee
[1:03:44] he said the lord according to the time
[1:03:46] of life because abraham said she's in
[1:03:47] the tent behind me
[1:03:50] now everyone's asking but now there's a
[1:03:52] message for her only one has a message
[1:03:53] for sarah
[1:03:54] i'll return unto thee according to the
[1:03:56] time of life and lo
[1:03:57] sarah thy wife shall have a son this is
[1:04:00] the message to her then verse 14.
[1:04:02] because she laughs she's thinking how in
[1:04:04] the world can i have a son how is this
[1:04:06] even possible
[1:04:06] doesn't make any sense he says is
[1:04:08] anything too hard for the lord
[1:04:11] at the time appointed i will
[1:04:14] return at the appointed place the
[1:04:16] appointed time
[1:04:17] at the tent of meeting at a secret time
[1:04:21] in a secret place
[1:04:22] broadband said the brides to come on the
[1:04:24] scene in the last days and it's at a
[1:04:25] time and a place that's appointed to her
[1:04:27] i will eternity according to the time of
[1:04:29] life and sarah shall have
[1:04:31] a son it speaks of the same potential
[1:04:35] that was in the woman in the beginning
[1:04:37] to reproduce another son of god now
[1:04:39] abraham chosen by god
[1:04:41] who is the father of our faith his wife
[1:04:43] is to have a son it seems like she can't
[1:04:45] he says is there anything too hard
[1:04:47] i will return according to the time of
[1:04:48] life the season for her conception and
[1:04:50] delivery
[1:04:51] the season to bring forth the promised
[1:04:53] son
[1:04:54] paul says in romans 9 9 for this is the
[1:04:56] word of promise at this time will
[1:04:58] i come and sarah have a son i will
[1:05:02] return unto thee i will come again unto
[1:05:05] thee
[1:05:05] and sarah shall have a son
[1:05:09] do you realize what the devil's question
[1:05:11] was then in the beginning
[1:05:13] what was he looking at trying to get
[1:05:16] things out of god's timing
[1:05:18] trying to get it out of god's way
[1:05:20] because if when eternal life comes forth
[1:05:22] you can't die you can't kill that
[1:05:24] just as eternal as god is eternal so he
[1:05:27] knew there was one
[1:05:28] tree one way to bring death
[1:05:32] and is by the tree that god put there
[1:05:35] remember now just symbolically so he
[1:05:37] knew he could bring death but he also
[1:05:39] wanted to get to life
[1:05:42] so satan had a question and this is
[1:05:44] where we ended last we were ending last
[1:05:45] time
[1:05:46] i'm going to read these very very
[1:05:48] quickly
[1:05:51] christ is the mystery god revealed just
[1:05:52] a few places i'm talking about the
[1:05:54] headship of christ
[1:05:55] being personally identified by the
[1:05:57] original headship
[1:05:58] so once you have the headship united
[1:06:00] with the body he says this
[1:06:01] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:06:03] question we have what he was looking for
[1:06:07] amen glory we have the answer to the
[1:06:10] devil's question
[1:06:12] i think we should associate it with
[1:06:13] genesis 3 1
[1:06:15] what he was looking for what he was
[1:06:16] trying to achieve what he was trying to
[1:06:18] gain access to
[1:06:19] we have it he christ is risen and has
[1:06:22] paid the price
[1:06:23] and raising up the body so now there's
[1:06:24] no more penalty
[1:06:26] death no longer holds over you but but
[1:06:29] they were born according to the detroit
[1:06:30] knowledge of good evil it doesn't matter
[1:06:31] there's a new birth
[1:06:32] price has been paid the wicked one is
[1:06:35] snared in the works of his own hands oh
[1:06:37] my what have i
[1:06:38] done i i've played right into god's
[1:06:41] hands and even when he crucifies the
[1:06:42] lord of glory
[1:06:43] it only furthers god's predestinated
[1:06:46] purpose and plan
[1:06:47] because now through that we have access
[1:06:49] to life
[1:06:51] there's no more stain there's no more
[1:06:53] penalty there's we're not
[1:06:54] subject to his wrath anymore we have the
[1:06:57] answer to the devil's question he paid
[1:06:59] the price raising up the body
[1:07:00] he says the devil can't stand it why
[1:07:04] this is what he wanted to defeat in the
[1:07:05] beginning
[1:07:08] that's the reason these ecumenical
[1:07:09] kingdoms are setting up that's the
[1:07:11] reason they're all coming into what
[1:07:12] they're doing now
[1:07:14] because it's the reason why he met the
[1:07:15] woman in the beginning
[1:07:17] i'll just get to it very very quickly so
[1:07:19] i can skip over it
[1:07:20] it's immediately why revelations chapter
[1:07:22] 12 says that he cast satan to earth and
[1:07:25] the dragon stood before the woman which
[1:07:27] was ready to be delivered for to devour
[1:07:29] devour her child as soon as it was born
[1:07:31] who is it
[1:07:32] the great dragon the old serpent called
[1:07:34] the devil and satan
[1:07:37] and where was he he was there in the
[1:07:39] garden and now he says he's spoken as
[1:07:42] being
[1:07:42] in the first seal the red dragon in
[1:07:44] heaven stood at the woman to devour her
[1:07:46] child as soon as it was born
[1:07:48] who was it he tried to devour the child
[1:07:49] when it was born the red dragon
[1:07:51] here's your prince here's your beast
[1:07:56] he was there to devour the child god
[1:07:59] caught it up into heaven to sit on his
[1:08:00] throne that's where christ
[1:08:02] is now till the time appointed
[1:08:06] until the time appointed brother mark
[1:08:07] says now this isn't another message now
[1:08:10] is the time for the seed to come forth
[1:08:15] now is the time he said and jehovah
[1:08:17] jireh
[1:08:18] he said i hope you got spiritual
[1:08:19] discernment he's talking about abraham
[1:08:21] now it's time for the revelation for the
[1:08:23] son that's been promised to be revealed
[1:08:25] to abraham's royal seed of the promise
[1:08:28] so now it's time at one time it wasn't
[1:08:31] time
[1:08:32] but now this time is the time where it
[1:08:34] is time
[1:08:36] right it's time remember i'm just
[1:08:39] fishing this morning
[1:08:41] time's not allotted to a man while he's
[1:08:42] fishing
[1:08:45] so now he's that's the reason he's
[1:08:46] setting up all these things that's the
[1:08:48] reason that the devil is hiding the way
[1:08:49] he is
[1:08:50] he was always there trying to destroy it
[1:08:52] but now
[1:08:53] he can't stop it everything he's tried
[1:08:56] he can't stop it
[1:08:58] whether it be to kill take a prophet's
[1:09:00] life or discredit the prophet
[1:09:01] take your life discredit your life tear
[1:09:03] you down get you mixed up cause you ups
[1:09:05] and downs and in and out look where you
[1:09:06] are you're here
[1:09:09] the devil's howling right now and you
[1:09:11] know what aggravates him when i point to
[1:09:13] each one of you and say think about
[1:09:14] everything you went through
[1:09:15] the hurts the pains the disappointments
[1:09:17] the backs being turned the stab in your
[1:09:19] back the the failures the lies
[1:09:21] everything you're here
[1:09:23] the devil couldn't stop it he wanted to
[1:09:26] he wanted to squash it out when there
[1:09:27] was total blackout in lao to see the
[1:09:29] devil said
[1:09:30] finally i found it total blackout
[1:09:35] total and complete blackout the tree of
[1:09:39] life
[1:09:39] has been squished out
[1:09:42] and then all of a sudden the lamb steps
[1:09:44] forward to take a hold of the book that
[1:09:46] you couldn't eat
[1:09:48] or touch
[1:09:51] and he's like wait a minute that's where
[1:09:53] it was all along
[1:09:56] you mean it wasn't in man it went back
[1:09:58] to god and he held the mystery of it and
[1:10:00] he sealed it
[1:10:00] and after i've done my last move now
[1:10:02] it's still there and no there's one
[1:10:04] worthy it's the lamb it's genesis 1 28
[1:10:06] it's genesis 3 15. it's him and he takes
[1:10:09] the book and opens it
[1:10:10] and it gets gooder and gooder then he
[1:10:12] gives it to you
[1:10:13] and you who weren't worthy to look on it
[1:10:16] can now eat it
[1:10:18] hallelujah the tree of life restored
[1:10:20] again
[1:10:22] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:10:24] that's why the devil's all howled that's
[1:10:26] the reason he's how on the way is
[1:10:27] his wicked scheme has been uncovered by
[1:10:29] the risen resurrected christ
[1:10:31] in the headship over his body headship
[1:10:33] husband to wife headship you think i'm
[1:10:35] beside myself i'm not
[1:10:37] i want to say it for myself too you
[1:10:39] think i'm beside myself i'm not
[1:10:41] he's he's excited glory our night says
[1:10:43] we've got the devil's answer
[1:10:45] what what what not me that liveth but
[1:10:47] christ the word living in me
[1:10:49] the tree of life eternal life it's not
[1:10:51] my idea
[1:10:52] it's his power not my idea it's his word
[1:10:55] he promised it here it is he said
[1:10:59] it would be here and here it is we got
[1:11:02] his answer
[1:11:04] it's time for you to come partake of
[1:11:06] this tree of life
[1:11:08] we have what he wants what he can't get
[1:11:12] what he was looking for in the beginning
[1:11:13] brother bram said it's here it's here
[1:11:15] it's here he says in paragraph 588 we
[1:11:17] have satan's answer
[1:11:19] god has vindicated himself god proves
[1:11:21] himself to his promise in this day
[1:11:22] hallelujah the headship
[1:11:24] is here amen christ the risen lord is
[1:11:26] here
[1:11:27] in the same power of his resurrection
[1:11:29] that he ever was manifesting himself
[1:11:31] there's the devil's answer the
[1:11:33] manifestation of christ
[1:11:35] in you is the devil's answer oh he hates
[1:11:38] it
[1:11:41] because the full words being born into
[1:11:42] manifestation the very thing he thought
[1:11:44] he could stop in the beginning
[1:11:47] you're bringing it forth so he says oh
[1:11:48] the devil is howling about this
[1:11:50] this is what he's talking about the
[1:11:51] manifested truth of the promise of the
[1:11:54] word in her alone
[1:11:55] they don't have the answer he says when
[1:11:58] jesus come he says he stood alone and
[1:12:00] his church stands alone
[1:12:03] she is his body the manifested truth of
[1:12:05] his promised word for the last days and
[1:12:07] she
[1:12:08] and she alone stands by it that's why
[1:12:11] the devil is howling
[1:12:15] what is he telling us the bride tree
[1:12:18] has united with the bridegroom tree
[1:12:21] it's manifesting the fruit of eternal
[1:12:24] life
[1:12:25] why because there's a people who will
[1:12:27] not
[1:12:28] die death
[1:12:32] is destroyed through you he shall crush
[1:12:35] satan under your feet shortly
[1:12:38] death came through the woman now death
[1:12:41] is defeated
[1:12:42] by the woman only god only god could
[1:12:46] write a story like this
[1:12:49] and had the benefit of knowing the end
[1:12:50] from the beginning
[1:12:52] so he could write the story
[1:12:56] and just put all the pieces where it
[1:12:57] needs to be
[1:12:59] so that we in the end could look back
[1:13:01] and see a perfect picture
[1:13:03] it's from the very moment that god
[1:13:05] became the logos
[1:13:08] all that momentum has come to this
[1:13:16] you could look at revelations chapter 12
[1:13:18] revelations chapter 13.
[1:13:20] brother calls him satan and his satanic
[1:13:22] religion are in both of these beasts
[1:13:24] what does this message do it exposes the
[1:13:26] trail of the serpent
[1:13:28] so that you can see his trail relates to
[1:13:31] you
[1:13:33] what do the twins do they intertwine why
[1:13:36] he's trying to choke out the life
[1:13:38] so the trail of the serpent if you
[1:13:39] follow the trail of the serpent you see
[1:13:40] the footprints of god
[1:13:43] and he's always there nipping at him
[1:13:45] serpent always nipping at him
[1:13:47] and he can never defeat it because here
[1:13:50] you are today
[1:13:54] brother branham says this and god of
[1:13:55] this evil age
[1:13:58] he says what god what would god call a
[1:14:02] people out of this evil age for
[1:14:04] his name why would he do this
[1:14:07] the reason of it is to try her his bride
[1:14:10] when she is made manifest because
[1:14:13] remember this is the devil's answer
[1:14:16] in other words satan asked a question in
[1:14:18] the beginning
[1:14:20] eve got confused on the promise and gave
[1:14:22] the wrong answer
[1:14:23] but we got the right answer amen so
[1:14:25] that's why
[1:14:26] satan comes in his eden six thousand
[1:14:29] years right
[1:14:30] took god six thousand years to make his
[1:14:32] eden satan's had
[1:14:34] six thousand years to make his satan
[1:14:37] after god had made his eden
[1:14:38] came and tempted the woman and caused
[1:14:40] her to fall now after satan has reached
[1:14:42] his perfection of his eden he's the god
[1:14:44] of this evil age
[1:14:45] god raises up a bride a woman within his
[1:14:47] eden
[1:14:48] to do the damage
[1:14:52] when she is made manifest been tried
[1:14:54] been proven
[1:14:55] proved to satan here's the key phrase
[1:14:59] like it was at the beginning so shall it
[1:15:01] be at the end
[1:15:03] as a seed starts in the ground it comes
[1:15:05] up through carriers the life of it
[1:15:07] but it ends up the same seed that it was
[1:15:09] when it went in the ground
[1:15:11] in the same way the seed of deceit fell
[1:15:13] in the ground in eden is the same way it
[1:15:14] ends up in the last days
[1:15:16] just as the gospel when it fell to a
[1:15:17] denominational idea at nicaea
[1:15:19] it ends up a super organization as the
[1:15:21] seat of christ
[1:15:22] seat of the church fell back there when
[1:15:24] the signs and wonders and the living
[1:15:25] christ among them
[1:15:26] it ends up in the last days under the
[1:15:28] ministry of malachi 4
[1:15:29] and restores back the original faith
[1:15:31] that once was given
[1:15:33] you have a super organization then you
[1:15:35] have what a super people
[1:15:37] which is the bride pick up your pen and
[1:15:39] write it's all in there he says we find
[1:15:41] now
[1:15:42] that this evil age is to prove to satan
[1:15:44] she
[1:15:45] is not like eve she is
[1:15:48] not that type of a woman
[1:15:52] like it was in the beginning so shall it
[1:15:53] be at the end but this time we have the
[1:15:55] answer to the devil's question
[1:15:57] she will be tried by his word the bride
[1:15:58] as adam's bride was tried by the word
[1:16:00] and adam's bride believed every bit of
[1:16:02] the word all but
[1:16:03] confused on one promise
[1:16:07] she was confused on wrong prose that
[1:16:09] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:16:11] forever
[1:16:12] today see but failed on one promise
[1:16:15] under the temptation of the enemy face
[1:16:17] to face
[1:16:18] where does he try to pervert the promise
[1:16:20] the promise today
[1:16:22] i could get you to look forward to
[1:16:23] something that i'm telling you is going
[1:16:24] to happen and that's all you look
[1:16:25] forward to
[1:16:26] is what's going to happen and i can
[1:16:27] always put it off long enough where
[1:16:29] you're always just under expectation
[1:16:30] and i can always tell you what happened
[1:16:33] and really got no way of proving it so
[1:16:34] you just have to take my word for it it
[1:16:35] happened
[1:16:36] but where is he found in the today in
[1:16:38] the now
[1:16:39] that's where you want to find him if you
[1:16:41] know where he is today
[1:16:42] you'll know what he's been and you'll
[1:16:44] know what he'll be
[1:16:46] today but failed on one promise under
[1:16:48] the temptation of the enemy
[1:16:50] face to face and now the people that's
[1:16:52] called for his name
[1:16:54] a people liking unto himself of course
[1:16:56] is his bride
[1:16:57] she is to come in contact again by the
[1:16:59] same thing
[1:17:00] not by just denominational truth or
[1:17:02] something but
[1:17:03] every word
[1:17:08] every word well john your father-in-law
[1:17:11] was sending me all sorts of quotes
[1:17:12] yesterday brother paul
[1:17:13] just loaded me up and i kept thinking
[1:17:15] should i just print these out and read
[1:17:16] them
[1:17:18] and i just wrote back it's like wow
[1:17:20] you're really going to enjoy
[1:17:21] the archives because
[1:17:25] this is one of the quotes he sent me
[1:17:27] it's right here in my notes the word
[1:17:28] bride is heading up in the person of the
[1:17:30] word of god made manifest in this evil
[1:17:32] age that we're living in
[1:17:34] same message god of this evil age see
[1:17:36] where it's heading up
[1:17:37] and satan will soon take his
[1:17:38] intellectual bride and exalt this great
[1:17:41] one
[1:17:41] which is the antichrist the hierarchies
[1:17:43] and set them upon a throne
[1:17:44] and the whole world will wonder at him
[1:17:47] this is what happens when finally
[1:17:49] the bride is taken out of the way this
[1:17:52] can't happen as long as the bride is
[1:17:54] here
[1:17:54] because greater is he that is in you
[1:17:56] than he that is in the world
[1:17:58] and as long as you're here he can't take
[1:18:00] that place over the deceived
[1:18:02] every time he listen to this and it says
[1:18:05] that this great dragon
[1:18:07] he deceived all them whose names were
[1:18:10] not written
[1:18:11] in the lamb's book of life and that's
[1:18:14] so this discer this this power is only
[1:18:17] on those whose names are not
[1:18:18] in that lamb's book of life those who
[1:18:21] have the tree of life inside of them
[1:18:23] and every time that brother branham not
[1:18:25] every time but notice the connection
[1:18:27] between
[1:18:27] the beast in revelations 12 and
[1:18:29] revelations 13 and the bride
[1:18:32] he says and who is this melchizedek now
[1:18:34] we find him at the beginning his
[1:18:35] attributes
[1:18:36] and now you are in him then this is when
[1:18:39] the book of life comes into view
[1:18:41] you in him then now we read over here in
[1:18:44] revelation
[1:18:44] the 13th chapter the eighth verse the
[1:18:46] beast that comes upon the earth
[1:18:48] in these last days will deceive all
[1:18:50] those people on the earth
[1:18:51] whose names were not written in the
[1:18:52] lamb's book of life before the
[1:18:54] foundation of the world
[1:18:56] the beast in the end does not have power
[1:18:59] over the bride
[1:19:00] so it's only until she's taken out of
[1:19:02] the way that he can deceive
[1:19:06] but the man says the god of this evil
[1:19:08] age the beast has come upon the earth
[1:19:10] would deceive all those who names are
[1:19:11] not put in the lamb's book of life
[1:19:13] slain before the foundational world in
[1:19:15] god's own thinking
[1:19:16] god the great spirit in the beginning
[1:19:18] before there was a beginning he was god
[1:19:20] did you know you were in him then
[1:19:23] if you're a christian now you was in him
[1:19:25] then and if that be so the whole godhead
[1:19:28] bodily shaped up in the person of jesus
[1:19:30] christ
[1:19:30] and when jesus died on the cross i died
[1:19:33] with him for i was in him
[1:19:34] then for he was the fullness of the word
[1:19:37] manifested
[1:19:38] knowing that we would be manifested
[1:19:40] later
[1:19:42] hallelujah knowing that we who for the
[1:19:44] joy
[1:19:45] was set before him knew that as the tree
[1:19:47] of life
[1:19:48] one day there would be a bride tree that
[1:19:50] would bring forth the promise word
[1:19:53] knowing that the fullness would be made
[1:19:55] manifest again in the end
[1:19:56] it's the word bride heading up in the
[1:19:58] person of the word
[1:19:59] of god made manifest in this evil age he
[1:20:02] says just as satan has taken his
[1:20:03] intellectual bride
[1:20:04] god first is taking his bride and he who
[1:20:08] now letteth will let until
[1:20:09] she is taken out of the way
[1:20:15] oh i'm doing great on time i might
[1:20:18] actually have to start stalling
[1:20:21] because i we not eating for at least
[1:20:24] over another hour i'm not going to take
[1:20:27] a vote or anything
[1:20:31] now let me read just from christ is the
[1:20:34] mystery god revealed let's go
[1:20:36] i'm going to close on this
[1:20:40] now christ the works that i shall do
[1:20:43] shall you do also
[1:20:45] john 14 12 what is that and greater than
[1:20:47] this shall you do
[1:20:48] that's in time he goes where the greater
[1:20:51] work is going to come from
[1:20:53] it's kind of come from his body it comes
[1:20:54] from the bride see the same god
[1:20:57] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:20:59] more than this for i go into my father
[1:21:01] she says the church will be a little
[1:21:02] longer in the light vindicating his
[1:21:04] promised word
[1:21:06] as god did his promises in christ's body
[1:21:09] so was christ
[1:21:10] doing the same works in christ body the
[1:21:13] church
[1:21:18] i want to say this slowly so you you can
[1:21:20] catch this
[1:21:21] see now making his mystery known to his
[1:21:24] bride tree
[1:21:26] in the last day bringing forth the
[1:21:29] fruits
[1:21:29] that was in the tree at the beginning
[1:21:34] making his mystery known to his bride
[1:21:36] tree
[1:21:38] bringing forth the fruits that were in
[1:21:40] the tree at the beginning
[1:21:42] and then he begins to describe the
[1:21:43] pruning of every denominational branch
[1:21:45] that came forward
[1:21:46] because it came forward as soon as it
[1:21:47] denominated organized it died and he
[1:21:49] says she's all gone
[1:21:50] so what did her husband do come by and
[1:21:53] pruned it
[1:21:54] it brought forth denominational fruit
[1:21:55] lemons on an orange tree so he pruned it
[1:21:57] off brought forth kept up
[1:21:59] but where is the heart of the tree
[1:22:03] right in the middle and he's pruned them
[1:22:06] all down to right
[1:22:07] in the top he's got a seed down here in
[1:22:09] the root
[1:22:10] heart purpose of god life of his life
[1:22:13] power of spirit just think at the heart
[1:22:15] of the tree
[1:22:16] like a tree that's planted by the rivers
[1:22:18] of water
[1:22:19] he takes god's laws and loves in his
[1:22:21] heart and he shall be like a tree psalms
[1:22:24] one planted by the rivers of water
[1:22:26] his leaves shall not wither in his
[1:22:27] season he'll bear his fruit
[1:22:29] and here it is right
[1:22:33] and he's relating to the bride tree
[1:22:36] and where does the fruit ripen quickly
[1:22:39] in the top of the tree
[1:22:40] why the lights on it that's right in
[1:22:43] right
[1:22:43] in the top of a tree in this last days
[1:22:46] he's bringing forth a bride tree
[1:22:48] now remember he is that tree of life
[1:22:51] contrary to the serpent seed
[1:22:53] you see so it's it's
[1:22:56] it's a contrast the doctrine of serpent
[1:22:59] seed wasn't so that we could sit around
[1:23:02] and talk about how oh you know they're
[1:23:04] serpent seed right
[1:23:06] like this is like the 12th message
[1:23:07] church they've tried
[1:23:09] brother branham said usually if you're a
[1:23:11] seed you catch it like that quick
[1:23:13] they've been in and out that's not the
[1:23:15] reason why we have that doctrine
[1:23:17] is to contrast the tree of life
[1:23:21] to make you realize no matter how good
[1:23:23] you think you are how much of the
[1:23:24] message you think you believe how long
[1:23:26] you've been in
[1:23:26] that you must be born again
[1:23:29] quick into life by the baptism oils that
[1:23:32] must happen
[1:23:32] he says can't you see he's that tree of
[1:23:35] life contrary to the surface seed
[1:23:37] you see he's that seed the woman seed
[1:23:39] the tree of life in the garden

[1:26:00] adam and eve again man and woman which
[1:26:02] are one
[1:26:03] made out of the same blood and same
[1:26:04] spirit and everything else
[1:26:11] he says the anointed man now
[1:26:15] the anointed people
[1:26:18] he says oh my to bring back the anointed
[1:26:21] bride
[1:26:22] in the bridegroom anointed
[1:26:26] by accepting what eve turned
[1:26:29] down that means the time is here
[1:26:34] the time is now we have it's the season
[1:26:37] now
[1:26:38] the headship is here he's telling us by
[1:26:40] accepting what eve turned on and adam
[1:26:42] coming back with the anointing of the
[1:26:44] word because he said my word is spirit
[1:26:46] anointed with the word what eve turned
[1:26:48] down he comes back
[1:26:50] and we accept see how that hybrid
[1:26:52] condition again just exactly what he
[1:26:54] done
[1:26:54] eve he told eve don't you do this and
[1:26:56] don't you do that and you can do this
[1:26:58] and that and satan said oh you know
[1:27:00] but she turned around and listened to
[1:27:01] him
[1:27:03] but in but the eve in the last days
[1:27:07] is not going to do it and i believe i
[1:27:09] read this
[1:27:10] uh just a few weeks ago why
[1:27:14] even the last days because remember
[1:27:16] she's not like you she's not that type
[1:27:18] of woman
[1:27:20] she's gonna but she's gonna be tested
[1:27:22] tested she's gonna come and contact it
[1:27:24] again
[1:27:24] by the same thing she's gonna be tried
[1:27:27] so it's not because she's not tried
[1:27:28] everything's the same he says but the
[1:27:30] eve and the last day is not going to do
[1:27:32] it
[1:27:32] because she's predestinated not to do it
[1:27:38] because now that satan has acted to
[1:27:39] fulfill god's purpose and plan
[1:27:41] now god in the last days has ordained a
[1:27:43] woman not to fall yes sir
[1:27:45] god's going to do it he knows it he'll
[1:27:47] have it he said his church would be here
[1:27:49] without spot or recall she's going to
[1:27:51] stand there
[1:27:52] in the splendor of him his word
[1:27:55] made manifest
[1:27:58] she is going to stand there in the
[1:28:01] splendor of him
[1:28:03] the tree of life restored again
[1:28:06] that's your that's what we are today
[1:28:09] is the tree of life restored back to him
[1:28:11] as husband and wife
[1:28:12] let's stand to our feet
[1:28:17] the tree of life restored
[1:28:21] back to him
[1:28:26] in the beginning god created
[1:28:33] and in creation was his plan and purpose
[1:28:37] expressed in creation so once
[1:28:40] god was finished creating
[1:28:44] and had brought forth the woman he was
[1:28:45] even it's almost as if he was waiting
[1:28:48] right because he doesn't attack till the
[1:28:50] woman's come forth
[1:28:52] and now that the woman comes on the
[1:28:54] scene after six thousand years
[1:28:58] even after god's day of rest now
[1:29:01] in that age that could have been eternal
[1:29:04] in potential
[1:29:07] he's there and he comes and he tries to
[1:29:11] attack
[1:29:12] the woman why
[1:29:16] she represented the purpose of creation
[1:29:20] the potential of it the power of it she
[1:29:21] was a tree
[1:29:25] that there was going to be an appointed
[1:29:26] time in a season
[1:29:28] so satan's attack helps us to understand
[1:29:30] what we're doing today
[1:29:33] we are his and his alone
[1:29:37] and the truth of the original sin is so
[1:29:39] important
[1:29:41] the results of the original sin being in
[1:29:43] the surface it's so important to
[1:29:45] understand
[1:29:45] i know it's it's weird to some people
[1:29:47] and they try to pervert it and make it
[1:29:49] out to be
[1:29:50] you know they're the ones that claim
[1:29:51] we're being too literal with things and
[1:29:52] they're the ones that go too far on
[1:29:54] other i know there's a lot of criticism
[1:29:55] about it
[1:29:56] but the truth of it is beautiful
[1:30:02] i hope you can see yourself the beast at
[1:30:05] the beginning
[1:30:07] is the beast at the end same purpose
[1:30:09] same objective same goal
[1:30:11] but the bride at the beginning was hid
[1:30:15] in the tree of life but now in the end
[1:30:19] she comes forth let's bow our heads in a
[1:30:21] word of prayer
[1:30:44] i'm not sharing with you data
[1:30:48] i'm not merely just sharing with you
[1:30:50] facts
[1:30:54] it's not depth for depth's sake
[1:30:58] it's not types for type's sake i'm not
[1:31:00] trying to out-type somebody
[1:31:02] you bring out more in the book of
[1:31:03] genesis so someone can tell me later
[1:31:05] oh i've never heard that before i don't
[1:31:08] always take that as a compliment
[1:31:12] though it is complimentary at times the
[1:31:14] point
[1:31:16] is for us to value the word of god
[1:31:20] and to know we've been born again amen
[1:31:24] to know that you've been baptized into
[1:31:26] the body of christ by one spirit
[1:31:29] the holy spirit the baptist holy ghost
[1:31:31] is eternal life
[1:31:34] we're not just we we don't possess
[1:31:36] eternal life
[1:31:37] by merely claiming to have it we don't
[1:31:39] possess eternal life
[1:31:40] by merely accepting jesus christ as a
[1:31:43] savior
[1:31:44] it has to come by union
[1:31:49] and we take the time to walk through
[1:31:51] this and we're
[1:31:52] looking at it with such a
[1:31:56] weight and a heaviness in our hearts
[1:31:58] these things in the scripture
[1:32:01] it pondering it over and over we've got
[1:32:03] to come
[1:32:04] to a birth we've got to come to be new
[1:32:07] creatures in christ jesus
[1:32:09] and i know i may be narrowing
[1:32:12] the audience down with such a marvelous
[1:32:15] group such as this
[1:32:17] but i just challenge you today to search
[1:32:19] your heart
[1:32:21] and ask whether or not he's wooing you
[1:32:23] calling to you
[1:32:25] to surrender to him let us all
[1:32:28] purpose in our hearts to be
[1:32:31] the manifested truth heads bowed now
[1:32:34] let's just
[1:32:35] say a word of prayer gracious heavenly
[1:32:37] father
[1:32:38] lord i thank you for your presence that
[1:32:41] is with us
[1:32:43] for the assurance that your never
[1:32:44] failing presence is with us wherever we
[1:32:46] go
[1:32:48] therefore we should not fear to go
[1:32:49] anywhere or do anything
[1:32:52] i desire today lord that your people
[1:32:55] would know that you're with them
[1:32:58] that they could see your perseverance
[1:33:00] and your dedication
[1:33:03] and how that you've pursued us from the
[1:33:06] beginning
[1:33:08] that at no time in the record
[1:33:12] did you ever cast us off
[1:33:15] at no time in the record did you deviate
[1:33:17] from your purpose and your plan may we
[1:33:22] lord take great assurance by seeing so
[1:33:24] many loose ends tied up
[1:33:27] take such great assurance and seeing so
[1:33:29] many dots be connected
[1:33:31] lord i know the picture that it paints
[1:33:33] to the world is odd and scary and to
[1:33:36] some blasphemous
[1:33:39] but lord it makes scriptural
[1:33:42] sound sense
[1:33:46] to know why your son came the way that
[1:33:48] he did
[1:33:50] to know why it was blood that was
[1:33:51] shed upon the cross
[1:33:53] to know why he had to be resurrected for
[1:33:56] our
[1:33:57] our sakes it couldn't just merely be
[1:33:58] death
[1:34:00] but he had to come back again in life
[1:34:04] to share that life with us
[1:34:08] and then we can be partakers of that
[1:34:10] life
[1:34:12] and you see the whole record of the
[1:34:14] wheat plant even the bride tree being
[1:34:16] restored back again in these last days
[1:34:19] not just to stand there with leaves
[1:34:20] clapping in the gifts
[1:34:23] but there to be a season now when the
[1:34:25] headship comes
[1:34:27] and the fruit the fullness of the word
[1:34:29] is brought forth again
[1:34:31] the same seed that was in the beginning
[1:34:34] not just
[1:34:34] the day of pentecost but genesis 1 28
[1:34:40] and it will be so lord that one day
[1:34:43] through the efforts of this bride
[1:34:46] that last seed will come forth
[1:34:50] and the earth's purpose will be
[1:34:52] satisfied
[1:34:54] and we'll go to meet you in the air
[1:34:57] my heart calls out to any seed that
[1:35:01] remains
[1:35:02] unexpressed and may we be the light that
[1:35:06] strikes the seed may we do our part in
[1:35:08] this valley
[1:35:09] together with our sister churches
[1:35:11] together with the other churches
[1:35:13] many all over arizona represented here
[1:35:15] today may we do our part
[1:35:18] because one day when that last seed
[1:35:21] comes forth to maturity
[1:35:24] immediately the harvest is finished
[1:35:28] and will meet you in the air and then
[1:35:31] shall be brought past the saying
[1:35:33] that death is swallowed up in victory
[1:35:37] what a wonderful time to be alive lord
[1:35:40] what an exciting time to be alive lord i
[1:35:44] found myself saying i don't mean any
[1:35:45] disrespect to those who've suffered
[1:35:47] lord i know i've suffered personally
[1:35:49] there's disappointments and hurts and
[1:35:51] heartaches and great loss lord
[1:35:53] and i know many have suffered to
[1:35:55] tremendous degrees
[1:35:57] but lord i just found myself feeling
[1:35:59] like this is the best year ever
[1:36:02] not because of economics not because of
[1:36:04] politics not because of science not
[1:36:06] because of sickness lord
[1:36:08] not because of health but because of the
[1:36:10] word
[1:36:12] your word proves true it's proven itself
[1:36:16] alive
[1:36:18] it's proven itself honest and sure and
[1:36:20] that we anchor our souls in this word
[1:36:23] we will not be moved from it lord not
[1:36:25] one iota
[1:36:26] lord i rebuke the enemy that still today
[1:36:29] tries to cause confusion
[1:36:32] on the promise may your bride receive
[1:36:35] clarity knowledge wisdom and revelation
[1:36:40] and may the intelligence that has come
[1:36:42] become her possession
[1:36:43] because you yourself have stepped into
[1:36:45] it this hour the intelligence is here
[1:36:47] she has the mind of christ and may she
[1:36:51] stand on her feet in the splendor of you
[1:36:54] we commit the people to you now father
[1:36:56] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:36:58] pray
[1:36:59] amen if you have a personal way that you
[1:37:02] like to express thanksgiving feel free
[1:37:04] to do so
[1:37:06] if you have a personal way you like to
[1:37:08] express it don't let
[1:37:10] don't let the color of the walls hinder
[1:37:12] you
[1:37:13] there's a personal way if it's whisper
[1:37:15] if it's head bowed if it's arms raised
[1:37:18] just express yourself to him
