[0:00] just uh request your prayer tonight that
[0:02] you be attentive I know that Wednesday
[0:04] nights can be difficult for a number of
[0:05] different reasons but God bless you for
[0:08] laboring to come to sacrifice especially
[0:10] the families with children who've been
[0:12] sitting still all day long in school and
[0:14] whether you homeschool or they go to
[0:15] school they're told to sit still and you
[0:17] drive a long ways to come and be in the
[0:19] house of the Lord and there's a lot of
[0:20] sitting still and now you want them to
[0:22] be quiet and stay awake for the the next
[0:25] hour or so so I know it's difficult but
[0:26] I believe your your efforts and your
[0:28] labors to be here this evening are work
[0:30] worth it your uh it'll pay div dividends
[0:32] down the road as as we've been speaking
[0:35] on the subject of the house of the Lord
[0:36] tonight I want to take the title of this
[0:39] is his house and I just felt I was going
[0:43] to be ministering more on where we had
[0:44] been on the man of the house and the
[0:46] foundational principle of headship but I
[0:49] just want to kind of stay in that vein
[0:51] that we were in an Out of the Dust and
[0:53] into heaven just along the lines of
[0:55] encouraging you and I want to take some
[0:58] time tonight in the outset just to go go
[1:00] back over several scriptures I think
[1:02] that we've been over already and that
[1:03] were just this last Sunday but in doing
[1:05] so it's just to lay a little bit of a
[1:07] foundation and come to a point in it
[1:09] that I trust will motivate you and
[1:11] encourage you in Isaiah chapter 28 verse
[1:15] 16 it says therefore thus saith the Lord
[1:17] God behold I lay in Zion for a
[1:19] foundation stone and so it's a founding
[1:23] Stone this foundation stone that is
[1:25] going to be laid is a tried Stone a
[1:27] precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation
[1:30] those are the characteristics of this
[1:33] foundation and God wants you to know
[1:34] that I'm going to lay this corner this
[1:37] founding Stone it's going to be tried
[1:39] it's going to be precious it's going to
[1:40] be sure and he that believeth uh he that
[1:43] believeth shall not make haste shall not
[1:45] be confounded will not be ashamed so
[1:47] there's a lot uh that that foundation
[1:50] and that Cornerstone gives to somebody
[1:52] who will believe and when it says I will
[1:54] lay for a foundation stone it could even
[1:56] be said for a beginning Stone when I
[2:00] begin this I'm going to lay a stone and
[2:02] we know that Jesus Christ is the
[2:04] foundation stone you didn't learn that
[2:06] this past Sunday I only repeated it to
[2:08] you but we know that Jesus Christ is the
[2:10] foundation stone and he is a sure
[2:13] Foundation it is a a a tried Stone a
[2:16] precious Cornerstone it says a sure
[2:18] foundation so I in the beginning I'm
[2:20] going to lay a stone and this is going
[2:22] to be a secure beginning and I'm going
[2:24] to secure things in the beginning by the
[2:26] way that I start and I hope that's
[2:28] something that uh kind of holds in your
[2:30] minds I got some feedback by way of
[2:33] telephone the game of telephone today uh
[2:36] that really encouraged me my son ellot
[2:38] uh was the first to share things with me
[2:40] on Sunday just how much he enjoyed the
[2:41] service it was all I needed to hear to
[2:43] be encouraged he had some just real
[2:45] wonderful things to say and to express
[2:47] so I was real encouraged then just today
[2:48] some things were shared with me and I
[2:50] could see that there was those that were
[2:52] really thinking about what God was
[2:54] expressing and that there's this is
[2:55] leading to something and it certainly is
[2:57] and that's something to think about that
[2:59] in the beginning I'm laying a stone and
[3:01] I'm securing things at that very moment
[3:03] even though you don't see it now I'm
[3:05] securing for the future now and as we
[3:08] look at Jesus Christ as this foundation
[3:10] stone kind of the thought that I thought
[3:12] I would build a little bit tonight uh
[3:14] but I'm just moving a little bit away
[3:16] from it is a firm foundation having a a
[3:19] firm foundation and in 1 Corinthians
[3:22] chapter 3:1 it says for other Foundation
[3:25] can no man lay than that is laid which
[3:28] is Jesus Christ amen so there is no
[3:30] other Foundation I if there is another
[3:33] Foundation it's not a good beginning it
[3:35] won't last it won't remain so there's
[3:37] only one tried Stone there's only one
[3:39] precious Cornerstone there's only one
[3:41] firm foundation or sure foundation and
[3:44] that is Jesus Christ that's the one that
[3:47] every single individual must be built
[3:49] upon every individual must be built upon
[3:51] this if you had a church and it doesn't
[3:53] matter how wealthy the church was no
[3:55] matter how faithful the church members
[3:57] were no matter how big and everything
[3:59] you could have a big million church
[4:00] members like McDonald's does but if they
[4:03] don't have a foundation themselves
[4:05] that's a weak church because the
[4:07] individuals have to have their own
[4:09] Foundation because they become the very
[4:11] uh Bedrock of the church the individuals
[4:13] doing the same goes for your families
[4:15] and your marriages and the relationships
[4:17] that you have in the sermon God's only
[4:19] provided place of worship and I just
[4:21] found a lot of instances where brother
[4:23] bram's talking about foundations in this
[4:26] and Capstone even in this particular uh
[4:29] subject that that he administered on a
[4:30] few times says and the name is and the
[4:33] name is in the word because he is the
[4:35] word amen what is he then I love this
[4:38] statement the word interpreted is the
[4:40] manifestation of the name of God so when
[4:43] you hear about the name of God the word
[4:44] interpreted is the manifestation of the
[4:47] name of God so God interprets his word
[4:49] by bringing it to pass the the
[4:51] interpretation is the Vindication and
[4:53] he's saying that this word when it comes
[4:55] to pass that's the manifestation of the
[4:58] name of God not just saying Jesus
[5:00] but it's the word being expressed that
[5:02] is the name and the character of God he
[5:04] says no wonder flesh and blood has not
[5:06] revealed this to you but my Father which
[5:09] is in heaven has revealed this to you
[5:11] who I am and Upon This Rock I'll build
[5:14] my place of worship and the gates of
[5:16] hell can't shake it down he says amen
[5:19] and he says oh Living Church of God
[5:22] stand in firm foundation on Jesus Christ
[5:26] alone that's the one place you know
[5:28] you're secure when you're stand standing
[5:30] on the word of God the word of God
[5:32] that's been brought to pass the
[5:33] manifestation of the name of God stand
[5:35] in firm foundation on Jesus Christ Alone
[5:39] he says you can sing the song but if
[5:41] you're not on Christ the word you're on
[5:44] teetering faulty faltering sand but Upon
[5:47] This Rock Christ my
[5:49] word you might sing on Christ the solid
[5:53] rock I stand but unless you actually are
[5:55] you are on sinking sand he calls it
[5:58] teetering faltering green sand you may
[6:01] call It Rock You may call it sure you
[6:02] may say well this will work but no you
[6:04] can't Upon This Rock Christ my word
[6:07] you've got to be standing that's what
[6:08] the Church of the Living God is built
[6:10] upon well that's I recognize just uh and
[6:14] I'm sure that you do as well I'm just
[6:15] kind of repeating myself uh from even
[6:17] Sunday but boy it feels good to know
[6:19] that we have a firm
[6:21] foundation now in Zechariah Chapter 4:9
[6:24] it says the hands of zerubba have laid
[6:26] the foundation of this house and it says
[6:30] also his hand shall also finish it and
[6:33] thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts
[6:35] hath sent me unto you when it says the
[6:38] hands of Zer rubbable we know there's
[6:39] prophecy contained in this there's
[6:41] actually some historical touching points
[6:43] but prophecy of even Christ and it says
[6:46] it's laid the foundation and I I want to
[6:49] even say it this way he's laid the
[6:51] foundation and His Hands shall also also
[6:54] finish it so the foundation is just the
[6:56] beginning you say he's laid the
[6:58] beginning of this house I I lay in Zion
[7:01] for a beginning a stone so this
[7:03] Foundation is the basis or we could even
[7:06] say the Baseline in some ways and it has
[7:09] the purpose of supporting a super
[7:12] structure brother Brandon uses that
[7:14] language in the church age book and the
[7:15] writing of the church age book and how
[7:17] the pillars in the house of God are part
[7:19] of the foundation for they uphold and
[7:21] they support the super structure and the
[7:24] super structure is that part of the
[7:25] building that is above the foundation
[7:28] it's a super structure it's the
[7:29] structure above the foundation and so
[7:32] the structure it's the structure that is
[7:34] built or supera super above or on top of
[7:38] a foundation so when you say a a
[7:41] foundation foundations speak of
[7:44] Beginnings when it doesn't say behold I
[7:47] lay in
[7:48] Zion for a foundation a stone and it's
[7:51] like ah yeah rub that see then ain't
[7:53] that nice isn't that smooth it's I do it
[7:56] for a beginning so it means it's the
[7:58] start of something
[8:00] and so a foundations speak of Beginnings
[8:02] it declares in it to say that there's a
[8:04] foundation is immediately a signal that
[8:07] ah there's more than just the
[8:09] base this is the Bas line this is the
[8:11] beginning this is marking out H H the
[8:14] Bedrock the the territory the structure
[8:16] the the meats and Bounds of it this is
[8:18] going to tell us a little bit about what
[8:19] it's going to look like so there there's
[8:21] more to be built there's more to come
[8:24] because he says the hands of zerubabel
[8:25] have laid the beginning this founding
[8:28] Stone of this house but he's also going
[8:30] to finish which means complete it he's
[8:33] going to accomplish what he set out to
[8:34] accomplish and we know that according to
[8:36] Zachariah that it's The Headstone that
[8:38] is the finishing it's the cap it's the
[8:40] finishing off of the house so the house
[8:44] will be built God is going to build the
[8:47] house Jesus said destroy this temple in
[8:50] three days I'll build it up again
[8:51] speaking of this own self and and yet it
[8:53] speaks of even the restoration of the
[8:55] temple the house will be built and it
[8:58] saying and it speaks to how how the
[8:59] foundation stone we looked at this on
[9:01] Sunday it will become the Capstone Jesus
[9:05] Christ the Chief Cornerstone That Base
[9:07] even that that most critical element to
[9:10] the building they reject the uh the
[9:13] Cornerstone and in rejecting the
[9:15] Cornerstone they reject The
[9:16] Headstone Psalms 18:22 the stone which
[9:20] the builders refused is become The
[9:21] Headstone of the corner a stone that was
[9:24] refused as a Cornerstone may find place
[9:26] somewhere in the structure but for to
[9:29] ever be used as the capping stone that
[9:32] doesn't work at all if you to reject it
[9:34] as a Cornerstone it's not fit it's not
[9:36] fit for a crowning that's not fit for
[9:38] that but it's saying this very one
[9:40] that's refused who came to his own and
[9:41] was rejected Christ who was the Chief
[9:44] Cornerstone the founding Stone he's
[9:46] going to be the finishing Stone the
[9:48] Capstone and the climax to whatever he's
[9:50] building it says it is become That's The
[9:53] Headstone or that Capstone we looked at
[9:55] how that was prophecy and so the
[9:57] Capstone is Christ again I think the way
[9:59] I said it on Sunday is if you're ever
[10:01] going to be the head you got to First be
[10:03] the
[10:03] floor we we like to think of ourselves
[10:05] as the the the head but if if you want
[10:08] to be a good head you better have a good
[10:11] foundation so it's that final piece of
[10:13] perfecting or finishing the house oh as
[10:16] we've already read a few verses to you
[10:18] already and we want to turn to Matthew
[10:19] 16:1 18 I want to express don't let
[10:23] these verses be common to you I know I
[10:26] may repeat them a lot and if in some
[10:28] ways I'm just trying to cover my own
[10:30] complexes I still think it's worth
[10:31] considering uh what's being said and
[10:33] don't let them become common do not
[10:35] undervalue them and our desire would be
[10:37] that they would uh through Revelation be
[10:40] made alive to us I know this I've heard
[10:42] this it's a revelation to me but I just
[10:44] think there's always greater depths that
[10:46] we could enter into on things that even
[10:48] uh have repetition to us in the word of
[10:50] God as brother brandom already alluded
[10:52] to these scriptures flesh and blood has
[10:54] not revealed this to you but he says
[10:55] Upon This Rock I'll build my place of
[10:57] worship he says in Matthew 16 18 I say
[11:00] also unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon
[11:03] This Rock I will build my church and the
[11:05] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[11:10] it so much that we could say about the
[11:13] stone the rock the foundation of
[11:16] Revelation but it's the it's the
[11:18] statement I will build my
[11:21] church upon this foundation stone I will
[11:24] lay in Zion for a beginning of stone
[11:25] tried Stone precious stone sure Stone
[11:27] there's no other Foundation that could
[11:28] be laid there's no other beginning than
[11:30] Jesus Christ and the hands have laid the
[11:33] beginning of this house and the stone
[11:35] which the builders refus is not only
[11:37] just the the Cornerstone but it will be
[11:39] the The Headstone it will be the
[11:41] Capstone but he says I I will build my
[11:44] church we know that this prophesies of
[11:47] the Bride of Jesus Christ he said I'm
[11:49] going to have a church which the Bible
[11:50] shows us by Revelation as Paul teaches
[11:53] it that this church is his body of which
[11:56] he is the head and so this is Christ I
[11:59] he says I will build my church so it's
[12:03] him building it's his church as we've
[12:06] read already in Ephesians chapter 2: 20
[12:08] 21 and 22 I say already but just
[12:11] recently and we are built upon the
[12:13] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[12:16] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[12:18] Cornerstone so this is our foundation in
[12:21] whom all the building now that's the one
[12:24] building all of that building fitly
[12:27] framed together grow unto a holy Temple
[12:31] in the Lord this is what this is such a
[12:34] beautiful language you have a foundation
[12:36] which is Jesus Christ and then there's a
[12:39] super structure and this whole building
[12:41] is framed together and as it's framed
[12:44] together it grows into it increases to
[12:46] the Temple of the Lord to the house of
[12:49] the Lord you are a stone you are a
[12:50] pillar in the house of the Lord you are
[12:52] part of that that that manifestation of
[12:55] the name of God that place of worship
[12:57] that chosen place of worship
[12:59] in verse 22 in whom ye also are builded
[13:02] together for in habitation of God
[13:05] through the spirit your body is a temple
[13:08] of the Lord you are a stone in this
[13:10] Temple whether you want to look at
[13:12] yourself individually as a house of the
[13:14] Lord you are that house then as a part
[13:16] of that you are in the big picture part
[13:18] of this habitation of God you are part
[13:21] of that
[13:22] building I will build my church the
[13:25] foundation is Jesus Christ then there is
[13:28] a building that that is fitly framed
[13:30] together and it grows to the house of
[13:32] the Lord it's built together for the
[13:34] habitation of God as Peter says in 1
[13:36] Peter 25 ye also as Lively stones are
[13:39] built upon built up a spiritual house a
[13:42] holy priesthood to offer up Sac
[13:45] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[13:47] by Jesus Christ and he wouldn't build up
[13:50] a spiritual house unless he began with a
[13:52] stone a precious stone a foundation so
[13:56] he says I will build so this is the work
[13:59] that he is personally
[14:01] undertaking the the foundation the fit
[14:04] framing the the building the growing is
[14:07] something he does so when he says I've
[14:10] laid a foundation well we we can see the
[14:13] foundation and we accept that it's Jesus
[14:14] Christ and then maybe we see that the
[14:16] capstone's coming he says he's the alpha
[14:18] he's the Omega he's the perfect
[14:20] Foundation he's the perfect Capstone and
[14:22] then we look at the message and we see a
[14:24] load of building materials like well
[14:25] I've got to somehow take all this this
[14:28] Lumber and all this wood and build the
[14:31] house that he can come settle on and uh
[14:34] let's just let's just go get a
[14:36] tent right let's just forget about it
[14:39] but it's him that is
[14:42] building this is his building now I say
[14:45] that but then I also want to orient
[14:47] ourselves to our responsibility because
[14:49] we're talking about the man of the home
[14:50] we're talking about ourselves being uh
[14:52] uh the heads of households and the wives
[14:55] respecting their husbands and all these
[14:56] different things that start coming into
[14:58] view and I said this is a huge task it's
[15:00] a great work that we've been asked to do
[15:02] there's scriptures that we know pertain
[15:04] to us personally there's standards that
[15:05] we see in the word of God that we desire
[15:07] we sincerely desire to meet and so it's
[15:10] a tremendous labor to be the Shepherd in
[15:13] a home that's a big
[15:15] ask as we mentioned before uh recently
[15:18] to be the Watchman in the house the one
[15:20] who's up a little bit higher the one
[15:22] that's supposed to see things coming
[15:23] into the home and all of a sudden you
[15:26] find out one day that your kids are
[15:27] chatting on Reese's and you're like I
[15:28] don't need even know what a recus is
[15:30] when it comes to chatting like there's
[15:31] things that are evolving and things that
[15:33] are turning and Technology that's
[15:34] entering in and there's ways uh to
[15:36] communicate with the world there's ways
[15:38] to do things uh even to where uh there's
[15:41] there's stimulants and there's drugs and
[15:43] there's things that can excite and
[15:45] entice there's all sorts of things out
[15:47] there and you're supposed to be a
[15:48] Watchman in the home making sure that
[15:50] the token is applied say man it's tough
[15:52] being a
[15:53] Watchman it's difficult to be the
[15:55] shepherd it's difficult to be a priest
[15:57] in the home I guess it' kind of be nice
[15:59] to be able to just say wow that's the
[16:01] pastor he's the one that's ordained to
[16:02] see you through as long as we just go to
[16:04] church and pay our ties and he's living
[16:05] a holy life if we can just to the line
[16:07] when it comes to going to church we're
[16:09] going to be all right but listen that's
[16:10] not it at
[16:11] all that's not it at all and it's the
[16:14] reality that that's not it makes what I
[16:16] do even more important because I'm
[16:19] trying to support those that are trying
[16:21] to be Shepherds trying to support those
[16:22] that are trying to be priests I'm trying
[16:23] to support sisters who are trying to be
[16:25] the Fifth Gospel and walk in harmony
[16:27] with their husbands and you real that's
[16:29] that's where the rubber meets the road
[16:31] that's where the payment comes and so
[16:34] you've got to be sure that you're
[16:35] meeting the Mark here or it makes it
[16:37] much harder to meet it there and so I
[16:40] recognize this as a great task I realize
[16:43] as it's been mentioned to me quite a bit
[16:45] lately just how challenging some of
[16:46] these services are and it is challenging
[16:49] and it ought to be challenging I I I
[16:52] might be a little bit worried if people
[16:53] just walking out going well I've got
[16:55] that licked I I think it's good to kind
[16:57] of feel like more that we got
[16:59] right now that put me in my place it's
[17:01] good it's good to be challenged but
[17:03] don't forget this is his
[17:05] house that that there is a there is a
[17:08] foundation that's been laid and there's
[17:10] a perfect campstone that's coming and
[17:11] there's a lot of really good material
[17:13] that we see in the word of God but
[17:14] you're not doing this on your own you're
[17:16] not left to build the superstructure on
[17:18] your own if anything and maybe I'm
[17:20] giving really what's in my heart away I
[17:22] don't know if I'll come to it at the end
[17:23] but really you just need to get out of
[17:24] the way and be a bu be a material that
[17:27] he uses to build it up
[17:29] God is the one that's building and
[17:31] making you says in Ephesians chap 2:10
[17:34] we are his workmanship created or made
[17:38] in Christ Jesus unto good works which
[17:41] God hath before ordained that we should
[17:42] walk in them if it's a good work if it's
[17:45] a good building if it's a good growing
[17:46] if it's if it's something that's being
[17:48] edified you've been ordained to it
[17:49] already made in Christ Jesus for we are
[17:52] his workmanship you are the thing that
[17:54] is made you are the works of God as a
[17:58] creator
[17:59] that's why you're called New
[18:01] Creations so we we ourselves as we look
[18:04] at ourselves we say well I want to be
[18:06] the house of God well I'm on a firm
[18:07] foundation you're going to build
[18:09] yourself up brother Brandon when he
[18:11] preaches the statue of a perfect man he
[18:12] says you don't add
[18:13] nothing you see the danger of saying
[18:16] well you've got faith now make yourself
[18:17] into the perfect man and then he'll cap
[18:20] you go ahead and add add add yourself
[18:23] and then he's going to give you the Seal
[18:24] of the Holy Ghost there's a real danger
[18:26] in not getting that teaching right he
[18:28] says don't add nothing he said that
[18:30] would be like a blackbird putting
[18:31] peacock feathers in himself you have the
[18:34] life and it's the nature of the Holy
[18:36] Ghost to add to to add to and to grow
[18:39] you are his
[18:41] workmanship in Isaiah chapter
[18:43] 64:8 but now now oh Lord Thou Art Our
[18:47] Father we are the clay Thou Art our
[18:51] Potter and we are we all are the work of
[18:55] thy
[18:56] hand I want to be with wants me to be
[19:00] make me what you want me to be you're
[19:02] you're the I'm the I'm just the clay I I
[19:04] don't have I don't have the vision I
[19:06] don't have the mind I don't have the
[19:08] tools of the resources to make myself
[19:10] into something I'm your clay You Are The
[19:13] Potter I Am the work of your hand I'm
[19:15] going to yield to the Master's Hand you
[19:18] are our father says in Psalms 103 know
[19:22] ye that the Lord he is God it is he that
[19:25] hath made us and not we ourselves we are
[19:29] his people and the Sheep of his pasture
[19:32] I feel that if we could revisit this
[19:35] just as a church family tonight that we
[19:37] are his workmanship that me as an
[19:40] individual that I whether I'm a husband
[19:43] or a father or a mechanic or I'm a
[19:45] laborer what whatever the thing calling
[19:47] may be as a man if you're a housewife
[19:49] you're stay-at-home mother maybe work
[19:51] from home as a mother you maybe you work
[19:53] out of the home as a mother whatever you
[19:55] are in life is you look at your own
[19:56] individual challenges and I want to be a
[19:59] Christian I want to be a good
[19:59] representation of the word of God I want
[20:01] to I I want to be a light to others I
[20:03] want to see soul safy my own witness and
[20:05] testimony what whatever burden you might
[20:08] have to to be a Christian and overcome
[20:10] your past and overcome Temptation I want
[20:13] you to recognize that in your own
[20:15] spiritual growth he's the one that's
[20:18] wanting to develop you that you as an
[20:21] individual are a the object of his
[20:24] desire and he's not saying I saved you
[20:26] and now that I've saved you make
[20:28] yourself out of something and why don't
[20:29] you do something with the message that I
[20:31] gave you why are you wasting this
[20:32] salvation and you're a sorry excuse for
[20:34] a bunch of message Believers no if
[20:36] anything he's disappointed when we try
[20:38] to make
[20:40] ourselves it's only when we're trying to
[20:42] make ourselves he's like Ah that's not
[20:44] going to
[20:45] work he's like let me help you why don't
[20:48] you just let me help you he wants to
[20:51] help us I think it's just one of those
[20:53] things I I accept that it's actually a
[20:55] great Paradox but spiritual maturity
[20:59] is evidenced by the more you depend upon
[21:02] Him whereas it's kind of the reverse
[21:04] when we look at it in humanity we're
[21:06] like well the more mature our kids are
[21:07] the more independent they become more
[21:09] responsible they are on their own the
[21:11] more that they take initiative but
[21:13] really it's almost as if God is looking
[21:14] it in the inversion that our spiritual
[21:16] maturity is dictated by coming to a
[21:18] greater dependence and it's full
[21:20] maturity when you come to Absolute Total
[21:23] dependence could it be that we need to
[21:25] be depending upon him from start to
[21:27] finish that at no point we say oh
[21:30] perfect Foundation Lord that's awesome I
[21:32] got it from here but it's a it's a
[21:34] yielding to him in recognizing I am his
[21:38] workmanship and become and and it's not
[21:41] that and we're coming to this here in a
[21:43] moment it's not that we become uh
[21:45] Spectators in it but we recognize that
[21:48] we are this is a joint venture together
[21:51] that we are in this together with him
[21:53] and I'm an active participant in what
[21:55] he's
[21:56] doing Philippians 1:6 being confident of
[21:59] this very thing that he which hath begun
[22:02] a good work in you will perform it until
[22:07] the day of Jesus Christ I want to ask
[22:09] you I I mean this as a personal
[22:11] directive to everybody here I want to
[22:13] ask you do you believe he has begun a
[22:16] good work in you whether Philip raises
[22:17] his hand every hands are being raised do
[22:19] you really believe it do you believe
[22:21] he's begun a good work in you if maybe
[22:24] you don't even feel that you have the
[22:25] Holy Ghost do you believe that there's
[22:27] something a seed in you there's a desire
[22:29] that there's something that's begun that
[22:31] if he has begun it he's telling you now
[22:33] what I start I
[22:35] finish I will not have any unfinished
[22:38] product projects in in in in my man cave
[22:41] I won't have jobs half finished there
[22:43] won't be a house on the side of the road
[22:44] like look they they he didn't finish the
[22:46] house he didn't build it yeah that one's
[22:48] been that way for weeks they ran out of
[22:50] months they've run out of Finance it's
[22:51] been that way for years he that has
[22:54] begun a good work will perform that
[22:56] means he will bring it to an end he will
[22:58] will accomplish it he that begun a good
[23:00] work in you it means he will perfect it
[23:02] complete it finish
[23:05] it he that has begun it will perfect it
[23:10] as a psalmist said in Psalms 138:8 the
[23:12] Lord will perfect bring to an end
[23:16] complete perform that which concerneth
[23:20] me thy mercy oh Lord endureth forever
[23:23] and then the prayer forsake not the
[23:25] works of thine own
[23:26] hands it's that acknowledgement that I
[23:28] am your
[23:30] clay I am your work don't forsake it
[23:33] Lord finish what you
[23:36] started it's a it's a coming back to him
[23:38] on the center of his will to say Lord I
[23:41] want you to finish what you
[23:44] started the statue of a perfect man
[23:46] brother bandam says now you're going to
[23:48] build a house there's a lot in
[23:50] this uh to consider and you pour the
[23:53] foundation say boy I got her see you got
[23:56] the foundation to build your house on
[23:58] now you've got to build the
[24:00] house brother B using this even in the
[24:03] light of you have faith or you you're
[24:05] born again you have that Holy Ghost oh
[24:06] I've got it I'm done this is it this is
[24:09] it's all over he said no you got to
[24:10] build the
[24:11] house now this is where the thing comes
[24:13] in this morning we're going to talk
[24:14] about now and we've quoted some Snippets
[24:18] from these from this uh this sermon and
[24:21] I wanted building the spiritual House of
[24:23] God the dwelling place of God's presence
[24:24] he says all right a house this
[24:27] Foundation is first
[24:29] what is the foundation of Christianity
[24:31] faith in the word of God that is your
[24:36] foundation then you begin to
[24:39] grow then you start you begin to add to
[24:44] this Foundation now building a house you
[24:47] put your uprights and everything else so
[24:49] now he's drawing from a very literal
[24:52] process of building a house that you
[24:54] begin with a foundation there's
[24:55] different types of Foundations there's
[24:57] different requirements for Foundation
[24:59] based upon the ground God knows what
[25:01] he's doing he knows what those
[25:02] requirements are but you're building a
[25:04] house you start with a foundation
[25:05] brother B saying now once you have the
[25:07] foundation you don't say boy I got her
[25:09] doesn't matter how deep you might have
[25:11] drilled foot or poured Footers a a and
[25:14] dogout footage doesn't matter how big it
[25:16] is you don't say well I got her I got a
[25:19] loan for a million dollars to build a
[25:20] house and I poured a million dollar
[25:22] Foundation we spent the money we got it
[25:24] but he says no you got to build you got
[25:25] to grow from there he said brother would
[25:28] and some you carpenters and contractors
[25:29] here tell us how you build your house
[25:32] and and he said so we could take from
[25:34] the the handyman here and the builders
[25:35] here they could tell us how to build a
[25:37] house he says but I'm going to tell you
[25:38] how to build your spiritual house where
[25:40] God can
[25:41] dwell he says he wants to dwell in
[25:44] you and then he says he wants to make
[25:47] you like
[25:48] himself so he wants to make you it's he
[25:51] that makes you he wants you to be
[25:52] reflecting his
[25:54] being this is something that he wants to
[25:56] do so he realized that what he's begun
[25:58] in us as a foundation it's the guarantee
[26:02] that he's working on you the beginning
[26:05] means if I've started it I'm going to
[26:06] finish I'm not going to forsake you I
[26:09] I'll be a little uh I'll share my own
[26:11] testimony just very very briefly one
[26:13] thing that seemed to haunt me for uh
[26:16] just my whole life in some ways but even
[26:18] in the adult life and and just even a
[26:21] few years ago is back in 2020 that there
[26:23] was this seemed to be this complex in my
[26:26] mind that God could just at any minute a
[26:29] as a father just like yeah never mind
[26:32] you know what just forget about it I'm
[26:34] done like this little bit of thought is
[26:36] could it be that at any moment God could
[26:38] say all right I'm just going to move on
[26:40] to somebody else and I had to come to
[26:43] the Revelation that what God has started
[26:45] he'll
[26:47] finish and that I'm better off not I I'm
[26:50] better off just accepting that and
[26:52] yielding to that and there's no virtue
[26:55] in worrying about whether or not he's
[26:56] going to forsake the works of his hand
[26:58] hands or that he's going to walk away
[26:59] from this and leave me as an unfinished
[27:01] product I've just accepted the fact that
[27:03] he loves me he'll always love me I'm the
[27:06] object of his desire and that he will
[27:08] finish
[27:10] this he will do it because he wants to
[27:13] dwell in me he wants to make me like
[27:15] himself he wants me to be reflect in his
[27:17] being it's just not my pleading prayer
[27:19] it's not just my heart's cry it's just
[27:21] not some vain repetition that I pour out
[27:23] to him say Lord I want to be like you
[27:25] Lord I want to grow I want to be a
[27:26] Christian I want to serve you I Want to
[27:28] Be Free it's not just some empty prayer
[27:31] it's actually a Hearts cry a song from
[27:34] my heart that matches a tune in his
[27:36] heart he's like that's right that's
[27:38] right cuz that's what I
[27:39] want he wants you to reflect his being
[27:43] we're not pining for his affection and
[27:45] he's just kind of mocking at
[27:47] us oh yeah you want to be perfect you
[27:50] want to be like me well good luck no he
[27:53] he desires
[27:56] this let's look at Psalms
[28:00] 127 and I was ministering on Sunday I'd
[28:03] come with just the full you know full
[28:06] full notes I was like I'm going to be
[28:08] long and I hope it doesn't get too long
[28:10] and then I preach less than an hour and
[28:12] I'm wondering if I'm going too fast and
[28:14] I asked my family nobody
[28:16] answered and so tonight I come with much
[28:20] less than what I had on Sunday and so we
[28:22] could be very very short I'm probably
[28:24] going to ask is it too fast nobody's
[28:25] going to answer but we'll beat the crowd
[28:28] to In and Out so everybody will be
[28:30] happy but in Psalms 127: 1 to5 it says
[28:34] except the Lord build the
[28:36] house they labor in vain that build
[28:39] build it except the Lord keep the city
[28:42] The Watchman waketh but in vain as we
[28:45] used the example of a Watchman in the
[28:48] scripture as a type of a father and a
[28:50] husband within the home listen if he's
[28:53] not watching you're watching in vain now
[28:56] does that mean you don't have to watch
[28:59] nope it means your watching will be
[29:01] fruitful because he watches
[29:04] also it tells us to watch tells us to
[29:07] wake and to look then it says it is vain
[29:09] for you to rise up early to sit up late
[29:11] to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he
[29:13] giveth his beloved sleep Lo children are
[29:16] inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of
[29:17] his womb is his reward as arrows are in
[29:20] the hand of a mighty man so are children
[29:23] of the youth happy is the man that hath
[29:26] his quiver full of them who's got five
[29:28] who's got five kids God bless you you're
[29:30] scripturally correct Quivers five so all
[29:33] of us with four or three or whatever
[29:36] well bless their hearts we'll just pray
[29:39] for them he says they shall not be
[29:41] ashamed but they shall speak with the
[29:44] enemies in the gate some people are
[29:45] counting right now how many does brother
[29:46] Aaron
[29:49] have now if I want to look at this kind
[29:51] of as as a top view it's only five
[29:53] verses but notice how it says that that
[29:57] speak speaking of these couple verses of
[30:00] building a house watching out over the
[30:03] house and then in verse two it speaks of
[30:04] kind of our labor our working our
[30:06] efforts to make a living and then it
[30:09] brings into view those last three verses
[30:11] how that there this is rearing children
[30:13] having a family so in just five verses
[30:16] it really captures a lot in terms of
[30:19] laboring uh and Rising uh to work and
[30:22] eating and raising children it's all the
[30:25] things that we do we eat we sleep we
[30:28] work we get uh money we buy food we
[30:30] raise children it kind of brings a lot
[30:32] into view and these passages these very
[30:36] scriptures Express that our endeavors
[30:38] will only succeed if God blesses them
[30:42] they'll only succeed by God's grace and
[30:46] if you studied this on your own you
[30:47] might find some that uh think that this
[30:51] uh different interpretations of it it
[30:52] may refer to a reference to the building
[30:54] of the temple by Solomon except the Lord
[30:57] buil the house those that build build in
[30:59] vain as Solomon built the house of the
[31:01] Lord it could also be associated with
[31:02] Solomon building his own house the
[31:04] palace CU he does both a and you'll see
[31:07] those images in the scripture we may
[31:09] visit that on Sunday and so this house
[31:12] that it speaks of and it's the song of
[31:14] degrees for Solomon except the Lord
[31:16] build the temple those that build the
[31:18] temple labor in vain except the Lord
[31:20] build the Palace of the house he that
[31:22] builds his house labors in vain so
[31:25] regardless of how motivated you are to
[31:27] build the house regardless of how much
[31:29] resources you have how skilled you are
[31:31] how wealthy if the Lord does not give it
[31:33] success it'll be in vain because we're
[31:35] all dependent upon him
[31:37] anyways as the oral the tarum the oral
[31:41] Hebrew Bible wrote it if the word of the
[31:43] Lord does not build the house if the
[31:46] word of the Lord does not build the
[31:47] house brings us back to the beginning
[31:49] that Foundation it's got to be the word
[31:51] that does it if the word is the
[31:53] foundation the word is what builds the
[31:55] superstructure except the Lord buil the
[31:58] house they labor in vain that build
[32:01] it now if we were really picky we might
[32:05] say that doesn't make much
[32:08] sense except the Lord build the house
[32:11] they that labor to build it do so in
[32:14] vain it's like well if the Lord builds
[32:18] the house that then I'm not building the
[32:21] house am I does the sentence suppose
[32:23] some kind of weird uh Switcheroo where
[32:26] it's like well yeah of course if the
[32:27] Lord build the house if he doesn't build
[32:29] the house then that's just me building
[32:31] the house but if he builds it am I still
[32:32] building it that's what it's trying to
[32:34] say that you are it means that there
[32:36] must be some joint work except the Lord
[32:40] be building the house also all your
[32:42] labors in building are in vain but
[32:45] you've got to labor to build it you've
[32:47] got to be engaged in the process you've
[32:49] got to be willing there's got to be a a
[32:51] desire to say Lord I want to be an
[32:53] instrument I want to be used I mean if
[32:55] we've all been called tools at some
[32:57] point so we got got say I want to be a
[32:58] tool Lord I want to be used I want to be
[33:01] laboring together this means there there
[33:03] got to be something except the Lord be
[33:05] building also all my building is in vain
[33:08] so as I stand Upon A sure Foundation I
[33:10] see a lot of good material that can make
[33:12] a good house I say Lord I want to put
[33:14] myself to use but I don't want to be the
[33:17] one working by myself I want the word of
[33:19] the Lord to be working in me to build
[33:22] this
[33:23] house so it must be some joint work
[33:27] except the Lord build the house they
[33:28] that labor to build will build in vain
[33:32] so we must be laboring to build we must
[33:33] be waking to watch but he must also be
[33:37] watching he must also be building am it
[33:40] says in verse three Lo children are
[33:42] inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of
[33:44] his womb is his
[33:45] reward as the arrows are in the hand of
[33:47] a mighty man soore the children of the
[33:49] youth happy is the man that hath his
[33:51] quiver full of them the the the parents
[33:54] they shall not be ashamed nor shall the
[33:56] children be ashamed because they shall
[33:57] speak with the enemies in the gate in
[33:59] other words those children will be there
[34:00] as a witness as a testimony in a time of
[34:03] trial time of judgment in the gate it's
[34:05] a beautiful picture but he's drawing the
[34:08] image of the family into the picture of
[34:10] God's work except the Lord build he that
[34:15] builds builds in vain except the Lord
[34:17] watch he that watches watches in vain
[34:19] and then it just almost seems like well
[34:22] what is he talking about because he says
[34:23] children are inheritage of the lord it's
[34:24] the reward uh the fruit of the womb is
[34:26] his reward it's bringing this into look
[34:28] that this the house of the Lord builds
[34:33] together a as he builds together we're
[34:35] building together with him and this
[34:37] house of Lord's being built it can be
[34:39] understood to be now not just the temple
[34:41] not the palace but even a family even
[34:45] your own household as it says in Ruth
[34:48] 4:1 and all the people that were in the
[34:50] gate and the elders said we Are
[34:52] Witnesses so it's not speaking of Ruth
[34:54] the Lord make the woman that has come
[34:56] into thine house like elel and like Leah
[34:59] which two did build the house of Israel
[35:04] so it's showing that through the the the
[35:06] relationship of a husband and wife and
[35:08] the children that are the the the his
[35:10] reward to a family that that's the
[35:12] building of the house now when you read
[35:16] this look at how that comes together to
[35:18] say except the Lord buil the house the L
[35:20] the he that builds it builds in vain so
[35:23] mother and father husband and wife are
[35:25] building it but we might say Lord you
[35:27] you be the general contractor I'll be
[35:29] your sub let let me work together with
[35:33] you the one that has the master plan the
[35:34] Lord make Miss woman to come into that
[35:37] house may she be like Rachel which did
[35:39] build the house of Israel so except the
[35:42] Lord build the house and saying to those
[35:44] that are having families to those that
[35:45] are husband and wife to those who are
[35:47] father and mother to those who relate to
[35:49] one another as Brothers and Sisters in
[35:51] Christ Jesus as the children of Lord
[35:53] It's the Lord that's building this house
[35:56] andless God builds with us we build in
[35:59] vain unless he watches with us we watch
[36:03] in
[36:04] vain the work is vain meaning it's
[36:07] emptiness it's actually
[36:10] destructive and he's saying it
[36:13] just if you even look at it this way and
[36:17] I'm wanting to wrap this up here very
[36:20] soon so God just help me to be able to
[36:23] summarize these verses
[36:25] here labor
[36:29] is Vanity without
[36:31] reward or it's a
[36:34] strain there's
[36:36] uh it's destructive there's a price that
[36:39] pays when you when you labor and you
[36:41] don't see the fruits of your
[36:42] labor and it's actually saying in the
[36:45] scriptures that you rise up early and
[36:47] you work and you sit up late to eat the
[36:50] bread of
[36:51] Sorrows that the very thing you you've
[36:54] worked to provide when you eat is the
[36:57] bread of
[36:58] Sorrows that's the fruit of your labor
[37:01] it's the bread of Sorrows if he doesn't
[37:03] labor with
[37:05] you the Bible says man goeth forth unto
[37:07] his work and to labor until the evening
[37:10] in Psalms 104: 23 it's saying oh a man
[37:13] works and he strives and he rises up
[37:16] early and he labors to the late to eat
[37:18] the bread of Sorrows this is what man
[37:20] does he goes forth and he works and
[37:22] works until the
[37:23] evening and so it says that God does not
[37:27] not only bless your labor with bread but
[37:31] he rewards you with
[37:33] rest that without him it's just the
[37:35] bread of Sorrows but it says that this
[37:37] is what a man does he rises up early and
[37:39] he sits up late to eat the bread of
[37:41] Sorrows and it would just be vanity if
[37:43] that all that was so what he does is so
[37:45] that it's not vain he gives you
[37:47] sleep notice how he's dealing with
[37:49] vanity if you build without him it's
[37:51] vanity if you watch without him it's
[37:52] vanity if you rise up and work and labor
[37:55] without him it's vanity unless you find
[37:57] rest in what you're
[37:59] doing so God does not only bless your
[38:02] labors with the fruit of uh wages and
[38:04] those things but he rewards you with
[38:06] rest the Bible says having food food and
[38:08] rment let us therewith be content and
[38:10] and he wants to put you give you a mind
[38:12] that is at
[38:14] peace and he's saying that about our
[38:16] labor and so look at what he says about
[38:18] raising children children are inheritage
[38:21] of the
[38:23] Lord and and as it speaks to
[38:26] this and and and and and it references
[38:29] this what he does then is he gives us
[38:33] Grace he
[38:35] recognizes the challenge that it has and
[38:39] it's something he's with us in
[38:42] it it's a difficult thing but they in
[38:45] Heritage of the
[38:52] Lord in Hebrews chap 12:
[38:56] 1-2
[39:01] it says seeing also wherefore seeing we
[39:04] also are compassed about with so great a
[39:06] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[39:09] every weight and the sin that does so
[39:11] easily beset us and let us run with
[39:14] patience the race that is set before us
[39:17] we have our course we have our
[39:20] race but it's not a race that we run on
[39:22] our own he says looking unto Jesus the
[39:24] author and finisher of our faith
[39:28] the author and finisher of our
[39:30] race who for the joy which was set who
[39:32] was that was set before him endured the
[39:34] cross despising the shame and is sat
[39:35] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[39:37] God he is the author in other words our
[39:39] faith has its beginning
[39:41] point he lays for a beginning a stone
[39:44] Jesus Christ our faith has its Genesis
[39:46] in him and it has its finisher it has
[39:49] the Perfection of our faith in its God
[39:51] that does it he's the beginner he's the
[39:54] finisher he's the one in
[39:56] between we don't want him to be the
[39:58] beginner and the finisher and then we're
[39:59] just the ones in between and listen the
[40:02] between is this the between is the
[40:05] rising early and the going to bed late
[40:07] the between is the eating the bread the
[40:08] between is raising our children and he's
[40:10] saying I give rest I give
[40:13] Grace I I'm a participant in this I'm
[40:16] I'm to be there with you I'm not a God
[40:18] that's just sitting by waiting to
[40:19] chastise you when you get something
[40:21] wrong as a husband waiting to chastise
[40:23] you and you get something wrong as a
[40:24] mother that's not God's IMO if you've
[40:26] experienced that in Christianity through
[40:28] leadership that's not how God leads God
[40:31] is a participant with you in this he
[40:33] wants you to succeed he wants you to be
[40:35] an image of him he wants you to grow
[40:37] into a dwelling place and he wants to
[40:39] raise you he wants to rear you he wants
[40:41] to encourage you he wants to love you he
[40:44] wants to wash away all your difficulties
[40:46] he wants to smooth away your rough
[40:48] places he wants to heal your Brokenness
[40:50] God is there as a
[40:54] finisher as much as God word calls us to
[40:57] Perfection it's his word that gets us
[40:59] there if not
[41:00] more as much as he's calling us to it
[41:03] it's double that he's going to get us
[41:04] there he says come unto me all ye who
[41:07] labor and are heavy laden and I will
[41:10] give you rest we've got a work to do
[41:14] we've got laboring to undertake for to
[41:17] be the Fifth Gospel for to be preached
[41:19] within our homes these things that God's
[41:21] requiring of us a and I say this with
[41:23] the unction of the Holy Ghost behind me
[41:25] that the Holy Ghost is challenging us as
[41:27] Christians in this end time to move
[41:30] ourselves away from all these
[41:31] distractions come back to the attraction
[41:33] of the world and realize it's not
[41:35] Theology and itching ears but it's
[41:36] living the life it's doing what we ought
[41:38] to do as brothers and sisters in the way
[41:40] that we treat one another the way we
[41:42] behave not only in the house of the Lord
[41:43] but how we raise our children the things
[41:45] we talk about our Recreation all these
[41:47] things it's all it all adds up to living
[41:50] the
[41:50] life and because of that we realize we
[41:53] got a work to do but he's saying I don't
[41:55] want you to run off and try to do this
[41:56] on your own right this isn't message
[41:58] theater where we all just dress
[42:00] up and we're acting on some stage but we
[42:04] come to him yes and he's going to give
[42:07] us
[42:08] rest that means he's going to refresh us
[42:11] it's a it's a promise to take our
[42:14] ease to cause one to cease from
[42:16] something to recover and collect
[42:19] strength and he wants us to quit
[42:21] straining on our own come to him to find
[42:26] our source of strength and rest in order
[42:28] for this house to be
[42:30] finished if you labor on your own you
[42:33] labor in vain because there's no
[42:36] virtue and you weary even in what you
[42:38] think is well dooing because you've
[42:41] forsaken the
[42:42] Builder but this is his house and I'm
[42:48] not talking about this house that's been
[42:50] converted into a church such a huge
[42:52] house they were able to have a balcony
[42:53] in it mind you great campus
[42:57] but it's I'm talking about
[43:00] you you are his house your marriage is
[43:04] his house you're a picture of God's
[43:06] desire your family is the household of
[43:09] God that the body it's his doing it's
[43:14] his and Luke chap 14: 28 to30 we'll
[43:18] invite the brothers to come to their
[43:20] instruments and that this is this is
[43:22] kind of uh this is forecasting where we
[43:25] want to go maybe for a couple services
[43:27] say for which of you intending to build
[43:29] a tower sth not down first and cth the
[43:33] cost whether he have sufficient to
[43:35] finish
[43:36] it I've laid the
[43:38] foundation I'll also finish it he that
[43:41] has begun a good work in you is just and
[43:43] faithful to perform it to complete
[43:46] it so it says lest happily after he ha
[43:49] laid the
[43:51] foundation and is not able to finish it
[43:54] all that behold it begin to mock him
[43:59] saying this man begin to build and was
[44:02] not able to
[44:04] finish this is why he's saying what man
[44:07] is going to start building something lay
[44:10] the foundation they get so far I'm like
[44:11] oh man I never had enough lumber I
[44:13] didn't have enough financing I didn't
[44:14] have enough materials I didn't know they
[44:16] discontinued that product I didn't know
[44:17] I had this didn't have that and as it
[44:21] spoken here let's just kind of take it
[44:24] as a general principle and let's apply
[44:27] it to
[44:29] God is God going to lay a
[44:31] foundation is God going to draw a bride
[44:34] out of the church is God going to invest
[44:36] a lot of vindication in the profit only
[44:38] for us to kind of figure out well he was
[44:40] kind of wrong on a few things let's just
[44:41] move on let's just go up a little bit
[44:43] higher one guy told me that the bride
[44:45] was going to do the math and figure out
[44:48] that brother Brandon was wrong in his
[44:49] calculation about certain days and that
[44:51] was going to be the bride's Revelation
[44:53] and it was like you mean to tell me that
[44:54] you believe that God invested vind ation
[44:57] and a prophet yes Vindicated Prophet but
[44:59] the Revelation is going to be where he
[45:01] did his math
[45:03] wrong I don't know why I said that you
[45:05] know whoever streaming that but there it
[45:08] it is God has started something he knows
[45:13] what he's working
[45:15] with and and even when we've made a mess
[45:17] of things can we just admit we make a
[45:19] mess of things sometimes you know when I
[45:21] was going through that several years ago
[45:23] as I alluded to it earlier it wasn't
[45:25] like I I was doing everything right my
[45:27] life was perfect and it was like I've
[45:28] come to the Pinnacle and all a sudden
[45:29] God says that's good enough and he walks
[45:31] away I'm like well I was kind of hoping
[45:32] that there was more you know sometimes
[45:33] we just do our own things and we
[45:36] disappoint ourselves we disappoint
[45:37] others and there's struggles that we're
[45:39] trying to work through and growth and
[45:41] things and we realize man maybe I'm
[45:42] making a big mess of this maybe maybe
[45:45] I'm bumbling and stumbling and maybe I
[45:47] just grab this I know what you you guys
[45:49] do you grab that Ikea box you rip it
[45:51] open you start building it cuz you're
[45:52] like this makes sense you don't realize
[45:55] this was originally done in another
[45:57] language right and to me there's always
[45:59] a piece that's upside down there's
[46:01] always something extra and we just want
[46:03] to think those Europeans don't know what
[46:04] they're doing and we just rush ahead
[46:07] we're not following the instructions we
[46:09] we torque something a little bit too
[46:10] tight we build something wrong oh I've
[46:12] made a mess of it I made a mess of it
[46:13] and God says look I anticipated
[46:17] that I I knew that would happen this
[46:19] this I can fix this it's not
[46:22] wasted oh is it the whole thing going to
[46:25] top is the whole thing ruined did I
[46:27] do I need to go buy something else did I
[46:29] did I waste away your resources he's
[46:31] like no I plan for
[46:33] this because he laid a
[46:36] foundation and he knew he knows what it
[46:39] takes to finish it because it's not
[46:41] going to be said of him that he began to
[46:44] build and he wasn't able to finish do
[46:46] you believe that God's able to finish do
[46:49] you believe God's able to finish in your
[46:51] life God is able to
[46:54] finish in the sermon unwelcomed Christ
[46:57] this might seem to be a little bit oddd
[46:58] I don't have the the it on the slide for
[47:01] you so just please listen I'm going to
[47:03] close with this brother man says I've
[47:05] gotten my home my home City one of
[47:07] Mayo's nurses Mayo's brother's Clinic
[47:09] the nurse looking out a cancer case this
[47:13] woman only weighed 30 lbs when male
[47:15] brothers gave her up she lost her mind
[47:17] they brought her to the meeting she was
[47:19] to die in 24 hours so her sister brought
[47:22] her and her husband while preaching I
[47:24] saw vision and told all about her
[47:27] and it commanded her to rise up in
[47:29] jesus' name that's been 10 years ago in
[47:32] a year's time the woman weighed 170 lbs
[47:35] perfectly normal and well now that's
[47:38] just one of
[47:39] hundreds something has to create there
[47:43] CU notice what he says faith has to
[47:45] create her organs were
[47:48] gone why even cancer had eating her so
[47:51] bad big holes went in her intestines it
[47:53] had eat her
[47:55] up I want you to think of of this image
[47:57] of the the physical body as a as a house
[47:59] it's a temple and there was organs that
[48:02] had been birthed and formed and grown
[48:05] through adult life had functioned but
[48:06] now cancer had eaten it up and there was
[48:08] holes he says today there's not a
[48:10] blemish about her all because of Jesus
[48:13] Christ says now look what happened to
[48:16] her
[48:17] there that don't have to happen to you
[48:20] that's crippled the spirit's gone out
[48:23] polio and paralysis he's saying that it
[48:25] doesn't have to necessar go in and
[48:26] create where things have been completely
[48:28] destroyed he says it's just like the
[48:29] devil going into a house and breaking up
[48:33] the lamp tearing up the bed than going
[48:35] out that's the results of
[48:38] him but God is the
[48:41] one remember when we were saying how
[48:44] that we get this chaos and things get
[48:45] messed up and things get out of order
[48:47] and brother Brown just says well that's
[48:48] just the devil that's the devil that
[48:51] done it he says that's the results of
[48:52] the devil but God is the one the
[48:55] housekeeper
[48:56] [Music]
[48:58] Hallelujah he's the house Builder he's
[49:00] the home builder he's the housekeeper
[49:02] who comes in and straightens it up again
[49:06] oh if this house is a mess I don't have
[49:08] to clean it up on my own he's the
[49:10] housekeeper that will come and he will
[49:12] straighten it up again if it's shut
[49:15] through with holes if it's been torn
[49:16] down if it's been ruined if there's been
[49:18] a flood come through and sweep things
[49:20] away if there's been a fire that's
[49:22] shaking something if it seems as the
[49:24] whole earth Shook and the foundation's
[49:26] been broken he's the housekeeper that
[49:28] comes and straightens it up
[49:31] again if a body that was riddled with
[49:34] cancer that was eaten up with holes and
[49:36] the Holy Spirit could come and not be a
[49:38] blemish in that Temple and cannot God do
[49:41] that for us can we not trust that
[49:45] housekeeper to come and straighten it up
[49:48] again if you've made a mess of it just
[49:50] say Lord I want to clean but I don't
[49:53] want to clean without you lord I want to
[49:55] fix but I don't want to fix without you
[49:57] lord I want to build but I don't want to
[49:58] build without you pick up your hammer
[50:00] and your sword and say Lord I'm coming
[50:02] to work and I'm coming to war but I
[50:03] ain't doing it without you and come back
[50:06] to your place tonight and say Lord I
[50:08] want to do this with you rise to your
[50:10] feet tonight
