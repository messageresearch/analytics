TRANSCRIPT
========================================
romans chapter 5 verses 12 to 19. romans chapter 5 verses 12 to 19. it says wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed where there is no law nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adam's transgression they had not committed the same act or were not present and complicit in it but he says who is the figure of him that was to come but not as the offense so also is the free gift for through the offense of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many i'm sure you understand the emphasis that paul is making he's comparing adam to jesus christ it's a very interesting contrast compare and contrast and not as it was by one that sinned so was the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification forth by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but were sin abounded grace did much more abound and we know he deals with this in the next chapter do we send that so there's more grace god forbid he says that is sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord amen you may be seated i was tremendously blessed by the the special sister wendy saying and really just uh i felt the presence of the lord come behind it just immediately and it was a tremendous strength and confirmation to me just gave me courage to uh to take the word of the lord and just deliver it uh with confidence today because i mean that could have very well been the title of what i would ministering today is down from his glory and it's just wonderful you'll see how we start here in the beginning we're continuing on the subject of god created and i i apologize if it seems like i'm jumping right into the middle of something but we were last time we walked through last service we walked through the uh first chapter of the book of the bible genesis chapter one and in doing so we were showing things in the first three chapters and a comparison to the last three chapters of the book of revelation and and so we've we went verse by verse and it was kind of laying a foundation for what was on my heart uh for the next few services and i was wanting to take chapter two and just go verse by verse but i just feel so overwhelmed in this way just to kind of take it from just kind of the sow the seeds of it and take it from a ten thousand foot view and then go back and go specifically through chapters 2 and chapter 3 verse by verse lord willing and it's become more and more uh profound to me how that the first three chapters of genesis are necessary to understand god and his purpose and one of the key things that we were identifying last time is god is laying a pattern and brother branham even identified how that god was foreshadowing things and he was sowing seeds and it was a pre-figure and things god was doing things even in the six days of creation in the seventh day of rest that the bible says it was a pattern that was later followed in worship and and taking the sabbath day and so there's there's god was laying something down and a track so to speak we looked at the trail of redemption and how brother brahma identified and began to talk about the the beast at the beginning the beast at the end and the trail of the serpent but there was this trail of christ that we can see from the genesis to revelation and to understand god's relationship to man we truly need an understanding of the creation and the fall of it and it's as i study this and just labor in looking at this becomes apparent that the the brand of christianity that exists uh that pervades in most churches and most people's understanding is one that's so narrow to the true purpose of god that it salvation has really lost its true meaning and god's relationship to man has been lost i want to start with romans chapter 3 verse 23 and in reading this scripture use something that may be familiar to all it might resonate in terms of what salvation is and and if you were to witness to somebody and they didn't know god then you you might actually say something to the effect of well all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god and so you would you would start with this scripture for someone to recognize their need for repentance their need for redemption their need for a savior and as it said i just quoted it just uh so readily for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god i just want to use that phrasing there and ponder this because there's a there's a deep truth that's contained in this for all have sinned so there's none that have not sinned and in this sinning they've come short of the glory of god now we know that sin uh entered into satan and we looked at this in isaiah chapter 14 so we could see that sin or iniquity began in satan but then it was brought into creation through adam and it says in romans chapter 5 verse 12 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned so this sin which says all have sinned it's because of adam says death passed upon all men by one man's sin enters into the world and by this man centering in sin entering in death passes upon all men so we have all come into this world as sinners all have sinned and come short of the glory of god so we see all men are sinners through adam we all become sinners and therefore being sinners we're under the judgment or penalty of death and it says come short of the glory of god now this is not solely a reference to god's praise of man can we say all uh all men have sinned for all have sinned and come short of god's uh compliment or god's praise or or god's satisfaction and you could use that phrasing to uh to the phrase fallen short of the glory of god to express that sentiment that god is displeased with the sin of man but it's not a reference merely to god's pleasure in man but rather it's a reference to god's image for all of sin and falls short of god's glory or god likeness and also a man has now fallen short of what he was originally intended to be for the scripture says in first corinthians 11 7 as he which is the man is the image and glory of god so paul teaches us that the man is the image and glory of god but yet when you see mankind today you're not getting the full reflection and manifestation of the attributes of god there could be some similitude in certain similarities but then we know that god is not like man that he would lie and there's a lot of things about man that we know are not in the image of god so when paul says all have sinned and come short of the glory of god they have fallen short of this image that they were to be in they are no longer god-like it's no longer the divine image that's being expressed and in genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and 27 and we're reading a lot of the same scriptures but i feel that we're coming from just a little bit different angle to where i'm not just repeating myself it says and god said as we've looked at this in great detail for these through these several services god said let us make man in our image and our likeness and it says and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over all and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth so this dominion as god describes it notice what description he gives man very quickly if we make him in our image and in our likeness now i've got to empower him i've got to give him something that is also god-like so this dominion in government is essential to god's image had adam been made uh had been made in the image of god and not granted this dominion then that would say something about god's likeness or god's power but he's made in the bible continues so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and again that part we've gone we looked at very closely that is also an image of god a reflection of what is in god but this dominion this government this power to have dominion over the fish over the fowl over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing upon the earth this is part of the image of god and it's part of the divine nature as adam is placed upon earth and he becomes a god upon the earth so he says god now we're pondering this god made man then in his own image god created man in his own image so this is the original description of the composition of man how he's constituted his makeup you can say his character his nature his instincts his impulse his thinking god made man created man in the beginning god created man in his own image this is the composition of man and brother branham says in the message fundamental foundation for faith man was made as a secondary god on earth he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth all elements of the earth so he's given power to control but it's not it's not well you can control this cow and you can control that dog all the elements all the atoms all the molecules everything that would uh come together to comprise these elements he's given power over them and he says that was adam adam was given and i want you to kind of grasp a hold of this phrase adam was given these great powers so adam is constituted a certain way he has a certain composition a makeup a character attributes this becomes part of who he is and this is in him because of his god-likeness because of a divine quality and so he's given these great powers so god has granted it to him and then notice how brother branham makes a connection here and this is where i i might just be amplifying this statement uh through the remainder of the service but then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell dramatic pause the power he was given to make himself the power he was given to recreate the power that was granted him by god so you could define it anyway the power that was given to him it's through that power is where he fell now we know that it could not be according to divine operation or in other words it couldn't have been perfectly in the character of god uh we just know this by virtue of looking back in history hindsight's 2020. but we know he used that power and that's where he fell brother ram saying the power that was given to him to make himself is where he fell and i'm trying to be very deliberate my language as we go forward because there's such a tremendous uh truth that i want you to catch today so the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell in genesis 1 28 says and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful become many and multiply them so be fruitful just you're going to put forth seed and multiply become many and replenish the earth and subdue it so you could break this commandment up into two parts be fruitful and multiply applies to him uh and his image and him and the woman but then also there to replenish the earth and subdue the earth so there's a part of them that must be multiplied up to completion but then there's uh there's also this uh portion that relates to the earth to subdue it and replenish the earth and this is an all-or-nothing provision brother branham said the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it we saw this in genesis 1 22 this is the power to procreate this is the power to make himself and so this is to fulfill this you have to do all the ends so this is an all or not nothing provision it wasn't be fruitful or multiply or replenish the earth orbs to do it if it was ore you could just get one and say we did it right just like they say wash your hands or wear a mask right then we would all just say clean hands but it's not a it's not a this wasn't an either or this was all or nothing it was an and be more be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue the earth and so this prophecy whether it be multiply and re um be fruitful and multiply or replenish and subdue the earth and specifically i want you to ponder this replenish and subdue the earth this is prophecy brother branham called it an oncoming thing a promise so it was a promise and since it was oncoming it was prophecy and it's this word which is the original seed this is the seed this is something that's original god spoken word and when it says the scripture says and god blessed them the phrasing that's used and the word that she's god bless them it's not like bless your heart or god you know and just saying something over them but god in blessing them is communicating to them the ability to reproduce this is the blessing the blessing wasn't you know i hope your days are long and you have sandy shores and and it's always 75 degrees with no humidity and that would just be a wish right i just wish you well i'm just blessing you god bless you uh safe travels but rather this is a communication of a divine a covenant the blessing is a divine covenant for their continuance it says he blessed them and he said unto them so him speaking to them it becomes the covenant then the spoken word of god which grants them power and so the word which we call a blessing and it's it's a phrase as a blessing the blessing the blessing the word communicated to adam by god speaking it the spoken word empowered adam or gave adam a basis to place his faith and be able to reproduce so it was spoken beforehand that adam could take himself make himself subject to that word and so the blessing gave him the ability to increase gave him the ability to satisfy and subdue the earth's purpose because god blessed him and in giving them the blessing it's communicated by the original spoken word adam the power to be fruitful to multiply and then replenish the earth and subdue the earth so this was power then to reproduce the image of god if adam is made in the image of god and after the likeness of god then this power that's conveyed to him is to reproduce god likeness and so adam had the potential of divine power and it laid within him be fruitful multiply replenish the earth he's told that he's going to have and we'll come to it maybe here in a moment he's going to have dominion he's going to subdue he's going to have control he i've given you these things this is god conferring upon him a blessing god given him power and so this divine power laid within adam power to impart life power to bring forth power to multiply power to replenish power to subdue it's all laying in there so this divine power if i could put this way existed deep within adam it's deep inside of him it's there it's laying there it's part of the image of god but yet it's not developed the power lays within them but it hasn't been manifested it's hidden or concealed and we could see that this great power that he was given to make himself could not be expressed unless there was a woman so it laid within him as a potential and a possibility as even an oncoming promise but yet it had yet to be manifested or developed so it's hidden it's concealed if i could put it this way it's as if the power is in the seed but it lays dormant and in the principle of a seed you can take a seed and the life is in there and it can lay dormant for thousands of years but once germatized it will bring out whatever's in the seed so the power is in the word the power is in the seed adam is given possession of it and it lays dormant until the time the right season it's got to come forth in the right season now so adam conferred with this divine power to be fruitful multiply replenish the earth and subdue it we know that he acts to bring forth and he has he has a son abel and we see that he has other sons so these acts according to what we would think was being fruitful and multiplying so in genesis chapter 3 verse 22 it says in the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and live forever so i'm just going to stop there because i want to i want to take out of this before the scripture continues and i think we're going to pick up on it here in a moment in uh in verses 23 and 24 because it says therefore the lord god so god acts because of this but take what the preface is and what he says the man is become of one of us as one of us to know good and evil so he says lest he put forth his hand and in doing so take also the tree of life and in taking of the tree of life eat and live forever therefore so by god's own words if you could follow this and if see if i'm going slow and i'm and if i'm going slow it's a miracle in itself but i'm wanting just to be very patient to emphasize this by god's own words the man has become as one of us man has further become something in the image of god you catch that man was made in the image of god after he made man he said this is very good so man was in the image of god but yet there was more to be developed that we this is very simple genesis chapter 2 is what unfolds this and reveals to us though creed god rest in the seventh day and everything's created there's still more that needed to be manifested more that needed to be expressed and by god's own words he's saying man has now done something to make him more like us because he says man has become as one of us he has done something to further develop this image and he's now further in the image of god so adam's image was perfect in creation he couldn't speak anything against him he was granted powers which was the blessing to make him god-like in earth but genesis chapter 3 shows us that through free moral agency adam exercises his god-given power but in doing so it brought death by free moral agency he's made a free moral agent through his own uh free will he acts according to this god-given power but being misplaced it doesn't produce what the seed was supposed to produce so you're introduced very quickly in the bible the the the the sin of mixing something if you take the original and change it it can't reproduce itself and so genesis chapter 3 shows that that adam's act of free will was an unfolding of a power that god had given them but it brought misery it brought woe it brought suffering it brought death now if you've if i've been able to make myself clear and i have a lot of confidence in your ability to follow so if it's not clear i i shoulder the blame if we could be looking at a picture now we're adam in genesis chapter one and even chapter two comes forth it's the picture is developing the picture's developing adam and the woman in the garden every seed bringing forth of its kind everything is placed perfectly and now man acts in genesis 3 in god's responses man has become as one of us now and then what what transpires as a result of that is misery woe suffering death disease you name it right now i want you to consider this could have god been fully expressed if adam only ever knew the garden of eden this is where it just this is where i want you just to ponder that could have god ever truly been made known if all adam ever knew was the perfection of the garden perfect love perfect understanding of the love of god perfect fellowship everything perfectly in operation so let's think about this phrase then the man is become as one of us man had developed we could say even evolved to something that was closer to god in genesis chapter 3 verse 5 notice what satan says he says for god don't know this is in the temptation of the woman for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil we can say this is the devil's lie it's his promise as well the devil's promise is always a lie if he promises you to wash your car don't count on it right just don't don't bank on it it's not going to happen so his promise is a lie but yet the devil's promise is confirmed by genesis 3 22. notice how he says it if you the day you eat thereof your eyes shall be opened and you shall become as gods as elohims and god says the man has become one of us to know good and evil he's the the promise of satan has actually been confirmed now remember his temptation of the woman wasn't merely about dietary restrictions it wasn't about what they could eat what they couldn't eat are you are you gluten intolerant or are you a vegetarian what are you able to eat here caffeine what can you do it wasn't anything about that but it was about procreation it was about the tree of life it was about the power to create and so when he's talking to him he's trying to entice her god knows that the day that you act is a day that you'll become wiser your eyes will be open and you'll become as elohim and as a result you will know good and evil this is the devil's promise but yet it's a lie why because he he hid death from him and so the devil is actually referring to the growth of mankind he says if you if there's an act that you can take undertake there's something that you can do and in doing so there's going to be a further expression of yourself there's going to be a further understanding and enlightenment enlightenment so he's preaching and he's sowing something but it's sown in deception and it results in death or if i could say this way he hid he lied about the consequence which is death because man did in fact become his gods to no good from evil but yet the result and the consequence was death so he brought so the the bible says since man has become as one of us now lest he take also of the tree of life i i i think this is very simple but it's if i don't if i don't do it correctly i could be complicating this man is in a per in creation he's perfect but he has potentials that are not yet realized prophecies that are not yet fulfilled when he acts according to a power that he was given god realizes that man has now become in my words more like us there's been a further unfolding into the image of god now there's still more because he says lest he take also the tree of life it suggests there was more that could develop so he wants to stop him before in this condition he takes a hold of the tree of life and eats and what happens has eternal life because if he took of the tree of life and ate now all in everything that's represented that the symbolism of it it means that god now man in his condition he is going to be forbidden from something can go no further because the further expression the next expression would have to be the tree of life or eternal life oh my goodness this is just thrilling maybe you'll just watch me for the rest of the rest of the afternoon whoa there i just told you how long it will be morning lord willing so it's it's showing that there was more that could unfold and i hope my humor is not taken as a reverence there's nothing more precious than this than than you as god's purchase and the minister of the word to you there if he took hold of the tree of life he's already become like us to know good and evil now let's stop him lest he act further and live forever it is do you understand that can you follow that but since now there is a vulnerability or a weakness because he exercised his power of his own will god says this in verse 23 so it says now therefore lest he take all put forth his hand take also the tree of life eat and live forever because of this vulnerability that's crept in because when it happens man's fearful for the first time so now for the first time he feels fear and he you wouldn't want to act out of fear you can't be motivated out of fear so god is laying some very significant principles in the very beginning that's uh that's uh instructional to us and good for us to understand but because of this vulnerability in this weakness that he has now exposed himself to by exercising his power this power that got to him in his own time in his own will god has to do this and it says this in verse 23 and 24 therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to kill the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life i want to identify just a few things very quickly here god sent him forth from the garden so he drove out the man so it's god sending him it's god driving him god is the god is the force that takes man in the garden here he is in a perfect garden of eden and it's god that moves him out of the garden into the world in still in eden but yet not in the garden and it's perfection so something in the divine order had been upset at least uh to the to the optics to the eye to what we read something's been upset but let me emphasize this this is not the accident of sin if we if we look at god the garden of eden is perfection that perfection and then god's subsequent response to it being god moderating things and changing things and rearranging things and trying to make man suited for the fall and figure out redemption we're missing the story completely what begins to unfold is not the accident of sin but it was actually god's purpose and i know this is hard for me to understand completely but i know the more i ponder it the more i accept it the more i say amen to it the more i appreciate my salvation the more i fall in love with jesus christ to understand the plan from the beginning down from his glory so if you could focus with me very intently on this god led adam into the wilderness of eden god sent him forth god drove out the man and he leads him he drives him out of this garden into i want to use the phrase wilderness to contrast what the garden would have been to till the ground a focus on that it's it's god is being very deliberate i'm going to drive him out and he uses the phrase i'm going to drive him out and now he's given a purpose to till the ground from whence he was taken till the ground it speaks of the earth so now he says i was from whence he was taken now he's sent forth from the garden and now he has this task of tilling the ground which was the origin of his body in genesis chapter 2 verse 5 god says this and i'm looking at this to understand that this is god's not genesis chapter 3 and four and the rest of the bible is not god readjusting and it took him two thousand years or four thousand years to finally figure out oh finally i figured it out we need to send a savior there's it was all laid out from the beginning so look it says he sent out to chill the ground from which he was taken notice what god says in genesis chapter 2 verse 5. and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not man to kill the ground so when god has kind of given a description of the generations of the creation of heavens and earth and he's wanting you to understand the condition of things and how seeds were sown and i this is when i'll go back to this when we go through this verse by verse what i want you to catch is that before the fall god places man as a tiller of the ground so this is part of his constitution especially in light of the blessing in black in light of his powers and light of his commission god is going it says he says before the herb was in the field before it grew before anything was coming forth before it's in the earth or before it's manifesting he says before man had even come to till the ground and it continues to describe these things but god before the fall man is being described as one who's going to till the ground so in genesis chapter 2 verse 5 15 sorry in the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden so as it says in genesis chapter 3 god drove the man out of the garden of eden he sent him out to till the ground but notice it says he took the man put him in the guard of eden to dress which is the same word as till and to keep it so he's called he says man is to till the ground and when man is going to be brought forth he places him in the garden of eden and he has a purpose his purpose is to dress the garden which is to till it and to keep it so he has a commission then and this is something he must do to keep he must preserve he must protect he must perform keep he must perform that which is spoken of the earth he needs to till and to keep in order to achieve earth purpose there was one man that was given the responsibility in genesis chapter one and two to see that the earth was satisfied that the earth and whatever it was pregnant with the earth and whatever potentials it had and whatever it could do and whatever it could produce man was given the commandment you were to till the ground and you were to you're to dress it kill it and you were to keep it to cultivate it bring out the life in it preserve it protect it and perform it that's his responsibility i want you to look at it this way i trust you can see it from this perspective that god specifically equipped adam or gifted adam with abilities suited for his commission amen abilities that were suited for his calling he was called to dress and to keep so in genesis chapter 2 verses 5 and 15 and and we'll look at it also in genesis chapter one he is to be a tiller he's to be a dresser he is to be a keeper and this is the love of god expressed this is the grace of god to take man and give him certain attributes and characteristics that he would possess and that would be his to use this is the love of god being expressed because then god drives adam out of the garden in genesis chapter 3 verses 23 and 24 we read it god sent him forth from the garden god drove out the man and then he guards the way to the tree of life where he could eat and live forever and then you don't need to eat anymore right you don't need to continually eat for healing you don't need to continue to eat to preserve the body and keep it going so he's cut off from that in order to live forever and he's told he's going to be sent forth from the garden even to till the ground from which he was taken so when god drove adam out of the garden it was not before he had fully adorned the earth and specifically had furnished adam to dress it and to keep it god had already placed everything that man would need in the earth and also in himself can you see the grace of this we read genesis chapter 3 and it seems so much judgment so much condemnation but god knowing what was coming in his grace was fashioning man to deal with the fall i'm gonna make you a killer of the ground why couldn't adam just tell the serpent to do it but he was equipping him he was making him able he had already placed it in the earth and placed it within adam himself as it says in genesis chapter 2 verse 1 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them this is the conclusion before god rest on the seventh day it says creation is complete we can say it's a perfect picture we understand already that there can be more to be developed but the seeds are sown amen everything's furnished everything's there god will not have to speak later to amend god won't have to readjust well satan oh man i had my six moves planned but i wasn't anticipating that one i need to readjust my seventh my my sixth move there was no choose your adventure here though it might look like it to satan all the heavenly earth were finished all the host of them for man before man was created and even before he was made flesh the earth was fully arranged creation was fully expressed and genesis chapter 1 verses 28 to 30 it establishes the order and the purpose of mankind and also for creation all of creation has meaning in light of genesis 1 20 to 30. all of mankind is established placed and arranged under genesis chapter 1 verses 28 to 30. it is the commission to man and this is what he must keep and now everything in its play everything is given a purpose and everything has a place and there's a place for everything it's the easiest way to stay clean right everything in its place and a place for everything and and there was a place for it that's how you wouldn't have chaos you wouldn't have disorder like what is this doing here everything had a place and everything was in its place and genesis chapter 1 verses 28 to 29 places things in relation to each other as it says in verse 29 and god said behold to the man male and female i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the witch is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat take that you vegetarians means food he says i have given you in this commission commission in this blessing in this empowering every herb every tree which yields fruit is your food it's part of god's divine blessing so even before adam was made flesh i want you to catch the order of this before adam is even in a body from the earth and even before that body falls and is driven out of the garden god created substance for life and then empowered man to partake of it in order to sustain his life this is before he's even in a body that would need it and before he would even fall god said i've made fruit and i've made vegetation i've made these things for you to eat of it every herb that brings forth you can eat every tree that yields fruit you can eat it's for you for meat for your flesh and so god before adam even existed in the body before genesis chapter 3 god created and commanded the substance for sustaining adam's flesh god was already sustained god was already making provision god was already looking out after adam before he fell and if god would do this for man who is imminently going to fall would god not do the same for you today can you not rest in his provision can you not rest in his promise so in genesis chapter 2 verse 7. it says in the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul so the image of god is now placed in a fleshly body which came from the dust came from the earth but the man talks about how all our bodies laid in the earth talking about our bodies are already in the earth all the elements everything's already in there and so now the image of god which adam was made in which god is a spirit adam's made in that likeness made in that image genesis chapter 2 does not re-explain or rewrite what happens in chapter one it's a further development genesis chapter one is perfect all creation is made everything's expressed all the host everything it's ever gonna be is already there but now seeds have to come forth and genesis chapter two is god's spoken word developing and it's expressing things and god is bringing things forth so he hasn't created again in genesis chapter two and then i want you to ponder this genesis chapter 3 is also a development maybe just in the the loosest use of the phrase it's a development you might think well that's not a development that's a that's a fall backwards but it's a development but this is a necessary development him being placed the man he's formed man from the dust of the ground this is a necessary development for man to fulfill the prophecy or the commandment of genesis 1 28. as long as he's a spirit being he cannot do all the ends be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue the earth he could not fulfill genesis 1 28 unless he was in a body so now adam is composed of an earthly body with a heavenly soul and a spirit which came direct from god so now it's an earthly body we know adam is made in the image of god which is heavenly and then it says god breathed into his nostrils the breath of life so this is a spirit which comes direct from god and when man now is placed inside an earthly body now that he's body spirit and soul man becomes a little world himself he actually becomes like creation heavens and earth because the soul and spirit came from god which is the heavenly the body came from the earth so adam is almost a little earth in a little world a little creation in himself and brother bottom says this i'm going to read from three places i had a dozen that i could have read from because brother bannon makes a very direct connection any time most of the time that brother bannon talks about adam's body being formed he makes specific references to certain things and in these three statements you'll see how brother adam's identifying what the evolution was for and i will restore in the beginning when god made man in his image the first man adam was a man like god he was a spirit man he says then later on we find after he made man in his image there was no man to till the soil brother branham when he's looking at this genesis 2 7 he points to this phrase there was no man to till the soil that it was necessary for god to put adam in a body to till the soil man had to do that then he says this this is the other part that he mentioned so often accord when he refers to genesis 2 7. so he put man in five senses to contact his earthly home that's the purpose of the body so god in genesis chapter 2 verse 7 gives adam a body which is going to allow him to properly relate to and go through and interact with all of creation his earthly home the garden of eden without that he would have had a peculiar relationship to creation in the same way that god was still a mystery to animal life and that god still would have been a mystery and unable to partake in the grass and and and the fruit and all of creation there was a way that adam had to be expressed and he had to be equipped with certain senses in order to make his way in the perfect eden so brother branham points to he had to come into flesh in order to till the soil and he was given senses to contact his earthly home that's the purpose of the body he says in jehovah jireh he says when he formed man the first time he made them in his own image and god is a spirit in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and then still there was no man to till the soil then god formed man out of the dust of the earth and put his dual spirit in him and that was the first adam so just adam further expressed and god's power to transform he quotes genesis 1 27 and he says and then he goes on and many things happened upon the earth then we say man was made in his likeness and in his image and he says then many things happened upon the earth then we come to find out there's no man to till the soil then god created man out of the dust of the earth he goes that was a different man now i don't find anywhere else where brother who teaches that this is a a separate entity from adam it's a different it's it's a different expression of the same adam that was a different man and he breathed the spirit of life into him and he became a living soul now what god has done is he's taken man and he's made him into something that puts him in relationship to creation as the highest in creation and he says and man became so brother man i'm saying he was given senses the body genesis 2 7 so he could have a body with five senses to contact his earthly home that's what it's for and then it's for him to also till the ground to fulfill his purpose and so this process of making a body out of the dust of the earth breathing a breath of life into his nostrils man becomes a living soul brother says and then he became a living soul that that word is living and nephesh living soul nephesh it's a that's what the hebrew is that's what a living soul is what he has done now by making adam a living soul now in our minds we think living soul we think a soul of man which comes direct from god and we think this is acquainted him further with the divine and this has made him more godlike but actually the opposite is true what god has done is now he's given him an affinity to the creation that he's to help he's actually connected him to the ones that the commission and the commandment applies to genesis 1 28-30 applies to mankind animal life and all the the all the the vegetation and life anything that would grow anything that would come up and it's given this relationship man you could eat of the fruit and you could eat of the herb animal life you can eat of the vegetation and the grass and everything was placed in its order and everything had an understanding what their role was and what they were to do and so when god makes man a living soul he's given him an affinity to the living creatures genesis chapter 1 verse 21 and god created wells and every living creature guess what that phrase is living soul it could have very well create said and man became a living creature because it's the very same uh uh kae it's the same living creature so in the fifth day god brings forth living creatures then in the sixth day verse 24 and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature this is all happening before adam becomes a living creature so when adam is made flesh and i've given you this i've made you this way and when i kick you out of my garden i've given you what you need adam you will make it amen you may not be able to live that thousand years because what i said the day you eat that day you die but adam you'll live a long time because of the gifts i've given you provision i've made for you i wonder if god wanted to say adam i'm sorry but i'm painting a picture you'll understand one day better the day when he woke eve up he said honey he's here that one i told you about the one that was to come despite what adam lost when he forfeited that title deed god made adam knowing that trouble would come i think we should rethink god's judgment he made him knowing that trouble would come and in genesis chapter 3 verse 21 he says unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skin and clothe them i'd like to emphasize it more later but chapter two ends where they're both in the garden they're naked and unashamed but now their nakedness is exposed and there's shame that comes with it but god cares about nakedness and it says that god the lord god made coats of skin and clothed him this is when death full death fully enters because an innocent creature had to be slain for men's clothing so when we read it it just says and the lord god made coats of skins and clothed them that means god had to take the hide of an animal and in order for him to do it he had to kill it or it had to be killed rather i want to say it that way it had to be killed so it says the lord god made coats of skins and clothed them god did not literally stitch together clothing but rather he provided for it and i may i may just have to stop here cutting this this sermon in half i just i i i want to labor on this point now the lord god made clothing out of animal skins to cover them but god didn't himself because god's not in a body and though god could have supernaturally done anything he wanted created skins but that would have been complementary to his purpose what god did is he provided everything that was necessary for that clothing to eventually cover them now watch this in revelations chapter 19 verses 7 to 8 because now this is another parallel genesis 3 in revelations 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready she's dressed herself but is she dressing herself with her own clothing is she dressing herself with what she thinks is good and what she had her own possessions no but she's taken something and made herself ready and it says in verse 8 and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the linen is the righteousness of his saints brother man refers to the scripture says his own word and he says his righteousness that's what she was granted to be dressed and so the bride is granted furnished the necessities furnished what was necessary she was appointed and commissioned just as god blessed them now the bride is granted when she's granted she is furnished with what is necessary and she's also appointed and she's commissioned she has given what she needs to dress herself so she not only has the elements but she has the understanding to take it she has the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word so he has not only furnished the word but given her the revelation to take it and wear it properly oh hallelujah think about what the scripture speaks of that god had granted god granted to her he had given her a revelation of the word of how to prepare herself how to make herself ready so in revelations chapter 21 verse 22 what do you see and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband revelations 19 7 says made herself ready that phrase is used prepared same word made herself ready is the same word that's used it's just translated to his wife hath prepared that's that's what one translation could say his wife half prepared and the understanding would be she prepared herself because you read the next verse because she was given righteousness the word to clothe herself so she was given the elements of it she took it and by revelation knew how to wear it so when john sees the city he says i see a bride a city prepared made ready made herself ready prepared as a bride adorned which means made ready for her husband now this is the same thing that happens in genesis 3 21. you may say that's a very very bold statement to make i i believe you're catching just exactly what god did in genesis 3 21 just as the white in the end was given the material and the understanding and knowledge how to use the material god foreshadows this in genesis 3 21 and the lord god made coats of skin and clothed him the same thing happens in genesis 3 21 god how did it happen how did it unfold in the sixth day god created the lamb he had already before before man was even created in the sixth day this is the beautiful symmetry man is coming i'm gonna create an animal in the sixth day before adam even has any before he comes forth from god in the image of god before genesis 1 26 and 27 god created the lamb that would dress him the very one that would clothe him god said i must make preparation before he comes and he takes this lamb god creates the lamb and then right there in genesis 3 21 grants them the knowledge and gives them the revelation that this innocent must die and they must wear it that's how god made them close he creates the lamb in the sixth day before man has even come forth but yet he's premeditated he's foreseen and it's a lamb that's gonna what die think about that here came an innocent lamb in a perfect eden and god made him he would die but he was gonna use it to dress his son and his bride it's further understood that it was a revelation because in genesis chapter 4 verse 4 and abel he also brought of the first lings of his flock and the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering why because his his revelation was connected to the revelation that was given in the garden his revelation was connected with genesis 3 21. he had a revelation that in the garden what was used to cover man when he fell was a lamb that had been slain and they were driven out of this garden in these bleeding skins that were flapping on them flop bump bump bump his brother bam describe it abel caught the revelation that adam had adam had a revelation given it to him by god in your condition in your nakedness i provided islam here's the lamb you're gonna have to kill it and you're gonna have to dress yourself on those skins we see that abel now has the same kind of revelation because he takes the first slings of his flock and he sheds the blood and he offers it back to god to create that connection and that symmetry of the first thing to die before being sent out from the garden and the very first proper sacrifice made to god all foreshadowing what the lamb that would come that was slain when before the foundation of the world i said brother why are you so emotional i didn't sleep that this was just precious to me i feel i feel more connected to the lord than ever every scripture means so much more to me to walk through it this way to see these things that are taken that just dovetail so abel by revelation offers the first things and that's what hebrews 11 4 says by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice something that excelled than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous his revelation granted to him gave him righteousness god testifying of his gifts and by he being dead yet speaketh but it was more excellent than cain's offering so what was cain's offering genesis chapter 4 verse 3 and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought up the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord now you see the vast difference between the two abel's offering is connected to god's mystery abel's offering is connected to life his offering by revelation expresses that the innocent has to die to appease god's justice so and this is what man must be dressed in this is what he must be covered in so that's abel's revelation it's directly connected with the revelation given in the garden adam god created the innocent lamb gave adam the understanding that it needed to be slain and stitched and dressed and placed over him he had the understanding what to do with it so abel's revelation connects to that but notice cain's revelation is connected to the ground which is cursed so his knowledge not revelation we could call it revelation but his knowledge his inspiration is not connected with the mystery of what was hid in the garden or what was granted before adam was driven out but rather it's only tied to the earth which god himself had cursed so he offers from the fruit of the ground but now notice the connection and the symmetry to the fallen knowledge in fear-based religion or fear-based dressing fear-based response when it's not faith or revelation genesis chapter 3 verse 7. are you dizzy yet good thing we all use our phones and our tablets now or there'd be dust everywhere genesis chapter 3 verse 7 and the eyes of them both were open so now they're open and what no good from evil there's been a further step in the development but something's not right about it because it says and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons so before god gave adam and the woman to revelation they tried to cover themselves by their own will it's the very same thing that got him in trouble the enticement of the flesh the knowledge of man the the the seed of the serpent now is sowing this in through discourse with the woman it's caused them to fall but now they're acting they're motivated completely out of character and they know they're naked and they know something needs to be done but what do they grab they grab fig leaves from a fig tree god never said the trees that bear figs have leaves for clothing he never said that but yet they go to a fig tree that would have had figs on it and they take the leaves thereof and they make themselves clothing so it's they have now some understanding of how to close themselves and cover up their parts but this is before the revelation is made no what's happening god is letting his story be told divine love is being expressed sometimes we get so focused on the judgment that we miss his plan so focused on the curse of the woman the curse of the serpent the curse of the earth and we get so focused on them being driven out and and the of the sin and the wickedness of the woman and we're so focused on those things that we completely miss the pattern that god is laying in the beginning brother branham writes this thus what god worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan and he's referring to genesis chapter 3. what god worked out in genesis 3 what happened in genesis 3 god allowed it to be worked out it was part of his predestination plan genesis chapter 3 is a development not an interruption the development was an interruption but it was part of the development it was a necessary one because he says and when satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of god i have i have more to share than i've even covered now but i'm just going to close with this had adam remained in the garden of eden the mystery of god would have forever been hidden think about it he just stayed there and every seed came forth there would have been a part of god that would have been left unsatisfied there would have been things about god that he would have wanted to express but couldn't had adam remained in the perfection of eden who god is would have forever been lost the full manifestation of god all god is would have forever laid dormant in the image the potential there the power there the desire there but never expressed and this is what i want to leave you with i would at least like to get to my text says nevertheless death reigned romans 5 14 nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over all them that had not sinned after the similitude of adam's transgression adam who is the figure of him that was to come god only used adam as a signpost he only used him as a figure because god's purpose could not be revealed without redemption his full character couldn't be expressed without redemption the very essence of his name could not be expressed without redemption if i can say it this way his need and his desire to be a redeemer is at the center of god's character it wasn't it wasn't so much that god's heart purpose was to have a bride of his choosing but one that he could reveal himself totally to one that would experience every single part of his being one that would know him in the fullness of his abilities one that would know all of his characteristics all of his attributes not just really know you know god is a really good artist and god knows how to paint a sunset and god knows how to make high mountains but all the things that he was whether it be a comforter or a deliverer or a healer or a savior he wanted her to know him in all of his names in all of his character and all his attributes so his need to be a redeemer his desire was insatiable he had to be a redeemer it was an absolute necessity man was placed upon the in the garden and god knew unless he falls i will forever be longing and i read genesis chapter 2 verse 1. it says in the all the heavens and earth were created and all the host of them it so struck me last week with such full force in revelation god said that's it from this will come my desire i'm done creating i will get what i want from this one i will not create another alternate reality i will not ever create again my desire will be satisfied in this and it was an insatiable desire for redemption so not only did he foreknow adam's fall but he arranged all things according to the plan of redemption and then he sealed it and let me say this as the worship team comes that's what they say at the bible churches if the team will come let me say this maybe we could sing that song down from his glory i was going to express it through so many different scriptures let me say this the mystery of redemption is that whenever god redeems it's always greater [Music] the work of redemption and the mystery of redemption i just i i i want to stop but i just feel god it has to be impressed in someone's heart god's need to be a redeemer can we just spiritually relax then a little bit when we see the chaos when we see things turned upside down and we see something that seems so far beyond hope god sees it and says i need that right and the situations that we face in the end of laodicea my goodness we could despair but there's things that we will face as the bride as we triumph and as we're being raised and being lifted there's great acts of redemption in store and let me let me add my personal conviction i am here in phoenix arizona in this in this state to walk in his plans of redemption and to be a co-laborer for god's purpose to redeem anything that is lost no matter how far lost it will be and if we have things in our own life that are upset and things that we go through and losses and things don't fret don't despair there must be loss in order for god to have meaning there must be renting and torment god envisioned in the very beginning he not only envisioned and foreknew that man would fall but he arranged everything knowing he would fall for the sake of redemption and could we not believe that god had your redemption in mind your claims in redemption your promises under the open lord good could did god not already provide it if he was providing for adam in the beginning in genesis 1 and genesis 2 and genesis 3 for his reality in genesis 4 and on would god not then in the end provide you what is necessary to get to the condition of the end of revelation would god not do it and what would cause him to do it his need his desire for redemption that's what would do it i i say that we should just reverence him praise him and worship him and exalt him and say god i trust you i trust you adam and that fear brother brown describes it this way the brandon gets the story and he just kind of turns it around and he has adam and the woman being dressed in the bleeding bloody skins of an innocent lamb they're walking out of their garden and they're so tore up and so anguished and fear is coming over him in the woman they don't know what's going to happen but brother branham rearranging it you can see then that god as he begins to curse the serpent and the woman and then the earth he was actually trying he was actually sharing something which was the mystery of redemption and he was telling adam adam i got this i've made you for this i've already planned it i may i put you upon this basis adam i didn't make you sin but i put the capacity to do it in you i didn't force the woman to sin but i put her on the basis that she could fall i arranged it this way and so as he's forcing him out of the garden and the sphere might have come over and god said as they're walking about to take that last step into the wilderness brother brown describes how something dropped down out of heaven and he spelled it a little funnel l o v e called love and he said stop as the tears were flowing and the fear was gripping them and they were so anxious about the future he said stop don't worry adam i will redeem you don't worry redemption has already begun don't worry i've already made a way one day one day you'll stand upon this earth one day the suns will be manifested one day genesis 1 28-30 will be expressed don't worry adam the seed will come through a woman and you'll crush the serpent and adam must have taken that and lived on it all his days we need to live by the revelation there's a redeemer coming a revelation that god made me for this yeah this is my job yeah i'm gonna sweat yes this is gonna be hard but he made me a tiller of the ground it's not gonna be easy but he made me for this it's not gonna be easy but god has arranged it honey eve don't worry he's made it a certain way and we can work with his seeds we can work with his laws and we're going to be okay how many years do you live around 900 years let's stand if he would do that for him he did it for you whether you see it or not whether you recognize it or not he did it for you you may not even understand it but he did it i know there's a song he didn't have to do it but he did but i'm just going to say it this way he had to he had to or he would have forever been a mystery let's bow our heads is there anyone that want to give their heart to the lord today anybody feel the love of god beaming upon a lost soul there's something inside of you it says lord i want to accept the plan of redemption for me if anybody would give their heart to the lord you could just lift your hand lord i surrender my heart to you if you want to stand for somebody else say lord i'm staking redemption claims today redemption he said lord i stand for one [Music] today bow our heads in a word of prayer a gracious heavenly father we're humbled by your presence lord i i'm emotional today and i know that that can be a little bit of a danger dangerous area lord because i'm certainly not wanting to merely provoke emotion in the people something so deep within me has been struck to i i i'm enveloped by something lord and every way i turn i see it and i even realized that even as of late and even in preaching on these things i myself found that i was trying to to juggle what became redemption what turned into a redemption story and what seemed to devere and change course the lord this past week it's just finally this this picture is almost fully developed and that it always was the plan of redemption therefore lord i take great comfort in knowing that i was in you before there was time and my expression is in time and it's fallen and it was weak but you have begun a good work in me and the seal which you have placed upon my soul is good until the day of the fullness of redemption and father i pray today for any young person whether it be my own children or someone else's children someone streaming at home who has a recognition that they have sinned and come short of your glory lord i pray that they would yield their hearts to you for your purpose and you could begin a work in them as they repent of their sins change directions lord seek water baptism because they know that in repenting there is forgiveness of sins and as sins have been emitted inwardly we go to the water as an outward sign that sins have been omitted lord that would be my my plea to anyone that is lost and fathers we stand as your elect as adam was one who was a figure of him to come lord we stand with the word of god today on our side and we make claims on our loved ones upon our seed lord we make claims upon those that have gone wayward we make claims upon marriages that seem to be here beyond repair we make claims upon health it seems beyond restoration we make claims for salvation in cases that though so the critic and the skeptic and the the the ones that doubt uh the the very ones that we would might even believe to be akin to us lord they would look at those situations too far gone but lord we join our faith to this word that whatever exists in the world today is a disease whatever exists in the world today is an infirmity whatever exists today is a weakness in humanity your word had already made provision for a remedy and we accept it today lord we commit ourselves to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ touch your people amen
