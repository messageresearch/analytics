[0:00] Revelations 1:es
[0:02] 10-16.
[0:05] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day,
[0:08] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[0:10] a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and Omega,
[0:14] the first and the last. And what thou
[0:17] seeest, write in a book, and send it
[0:19] unto the seven churches, which are in
[0:22] Asia, unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and
[0:25] unto Pergamus, and unto Thitara, and
[0:28] unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and
[0:30] unto Leodysia. And I turned to see the
[0:33] voice that spake with me. And being
[0:35] turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks.
[0:38] And in the midst of the seven golden
[0:39] candlesticks, one like unto the Son of
[0:41] Man, clothed with the garment down to
[0:43] the foot, and gird about the paps with a
[0:46] golden girdle. His head and his hairs
[0:49] were white like wool, and white as snow,
[0:51] and his eyes were as a flame of fire,
[0:53] and his feet like undefined brass, as if
[0:57] they burned in a furnace, and his voice
[0:59] as the sound of many waters. And he had
[1:03] in his right hand seven stars, and out
[1:04] of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[1:06] sword, and his countenance was as the
[1:08] sun shineth in his strength. If we could
[1:12] just pray again. Our heavenly father, we
[1:14] ask that you'd bless the words which we
[1:16] have read, commit them to you. Lord, may
[1:19] you be on the receiving end, just
[1:22] weaving these things together. I know
[1:24] there's a responsibility on my part to
[1:26] rightly divide the word of truth, but
[1:27] I'm helpless without you, Lord. We trust
[1:30] that you'd come and just uh take these
[1:32] things and make them alive to us by
[1:34] revelation in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:36] Christ. Amen. You can be seated. The
[1:39] title today is music's movement. We were
[1:42] talking about music's momentum on
[1:44] Wednesday. Today is music's movement and
[1:48] kind of capitalizing this idea of motion
[1:50] and movement. a lot of different ways
[1:51] that we could overlap that with uh with
[1:54] art and how artists are able to convey
[1:56] even in visual arts movement and motion
[1:59] and momentum. Uh but we're focusing
[2:01] specifically in these last few services
[2:03] on music. That's a broad subject. It's a
[2:06] can be a uh a tricky one sometimes to
[2:09] navigate. Uh but I think there's just a
[2:11] lot here for us to look into that can be
[2:13] a great strength to us. Already we've
[2:15] looked into the word of God and we've
[2:17] seen that music uh is not a human
[2:19] invention. This is not something that
[2:21] man has contrived or worked up himself,
[2:23] but it was created by God and music is
[2:25] ordained by God as a way of worship to
[2:28] him. God sings and God has harps and God
[2:31] creates and builds within his creation
[2:34] music. And as we were looking at
[2:36] momentum on Wednesday night, momentum is
[2:39] an energy or impelling force. And so
[2:42] music has an energy to it and it has an
[2:45] impelling force. And so it can uh we saw
[2:47] how it can heal. it can it can give
[2:50] moving power. So there's a there's a
[2:52] energy and there's a strength that goes
[2:55] that can be conveyed through music. And
[2:58] one of the themes that I trust that
[3:00] you've been exploring in some of the
[3:01] sermons that we've encouraged you to
[3:02] listen to as of late, we can see that
[3:04] God's word can be typed as a musical
[3:07] composition. So, we're not trying to
[3:09] force uh any of the scriptures or any of
[3:11] these types and shadows into a very
[3:14] literal like you the only way that you
[3:16] can read the Bible is if you if you know
[3:18] uh music technically and the whole thing
[3:20] is actually just a song book and you
[3:22] have to know the minors. It's it's not
[3:25] uh that emphasis. It's just that God's
[3:27] word can be typed as a musical
[3:30] composition where there's different
[3:32] elements to musical composition. And
[3:34] there's melody, there's harmony, there's
[3:35] rhythm, there's dynamics and form and
[3:37] pitch and timber and even uh you know
[3:41] tempo duration. There's all sorts of
[3:43] there's even texture when it comes to
[3:44] music and a musical composition. So
[3:46] there's a lot of things that play into
[3:49] what uh a musical composition is. And if
[3:52] it's God's word is typed to musical
[3:54] composition. You look at musical
[3:55] composition, there's a lot of different
[3:57] nuances to it, a lot of different ways
[3:58] that things are working together. I've
[4:00] been looking in particular at sheet
[4:02] music and how that if brother Brandham
[4:04] emphasizes the use of sheet music and
[4:06] God's sheet music and there's different
[4:09] ways that you can uh or there's
[4:10] different ways that things are laid out
[4:12] in sheet music. Some of us like to just
[4:14] have a piece of paper that says C D C D.
[4:19] We want to just know the letter chord,
[4:21] but there's sheet music that people know
[4:23] how to read. Raise your hand. This is
[4:24] your moment you've been waiting for.
[4:25] Raise your hand if you can read sheet
[4:26] music. This was your chance. This was
[4:29] your moment. See, there's a few that
[4:30] can. And so there's staff, there's
[4:32] cliffs, there's rhythm, there's
[4:34] dynamics, even articulations all in the
[4:37] sheet music that tell you what the key
[4:39] signature is, the scales, the the time
[4:41] signature. There's even accidentals.
[4:45] We're like, that's I know that. I play
[4:47] that part all the time in the sheet
[4:48] music is the accidentals. There's a lot
[4:50] of different things that work into sheet
[4:52] music. Now, uh I'm not trying to conjure
[4:56] or trigger anybody who has piano lessons
[4:58] on Tuesday or anything like that, but if
[5:01] you look at it in this sense, life lived
[5:04] by the word becomes the performance of
[5:07] the composition.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; If you have if God's word is typed as a
[5:11] musical composition and then it's laid
[5:13] out a certain way and it expresses
[5:15] certain things, then that's just the
[5:16] sheet music. That's just the song book.
[5:18] That's just the chords and the cliffs
[5:20] and the scale and all the time signature
[5:21] and the accidentals all kind of in the
[5:23] in the word. But then when we live the
[5:25] life, your life becomes the performance
[5:28] or the expression of the notes and the
[5:31] dynamics and the rhythm and the scale
[5:32] and the accidentals. Your life becomes
[5:34] that. So the performance or the
[5:37] expression itself builds momentum for
[5:40] you the performer. If if God's word is a
[5:43] composition and you're not getting into
[5:46] the composition and you're not following
[5:47] the composition, you're never going to
[5:48] build the momentum.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; It it's never going to do for you what
[5:52] the word intends for it to do. If you're
[5:54] just reading it like sheet music, if
[5:55] you're just reading in the sense of ah
[5:57] man, I got to practice the piano or
[5:59] whatever it might be. It's never going
[6:00] to give you the benefit that it ought to
[6:02] give you. But it builds momentum for you
[6:05] the performer. But then also since music
[6:08] has momentum, it impacts and touches
[6:10] others as a way of drawing others into
[6:12] the composition so that they themselves
[6:15] can perform their part. In the sermon
[6:18] the mighty God unveiled before us,
[6:20] brother Bram makes this statement, the
[6:21] whole symphony is right in harmony with
[6:23] the word. He says it's going and brother
[6:26] Bram claps his hand through hands three
[6:28] times. And so he's kind of showing that
[6:30] this this uh rhythm to it. There's a
[6:32] beat. There's a tempo and he said that's
[6:34] it. Oh, it's a magnificent thing. The
[6:37] director and the composer must be in the
[6:40] same spirit and so must the musicians be
[6:43] in the same spirit to act it all out.
[6:45] And that's one thing that brother
[6:46] Brandham calls it a drama. When he's
[6:48] talking about this musical composition,
[6:49] he refers to it in the sense of a drama.
[6:52] So he said, "There's it. It's going.
[6:54] We're acting things out." So this is
[6:56] where we're using this term movement
[6:58] today. Now to the musicians here, those
[7:01] who've studied music, there's a a
[7:04] concept in music, maybe more might see
[7:06] it more in classical music, but then
[7:08] it's also been adopted and used in other
[7:10] forms and other genres. But a movement
[7:12] is a self-contained section within a
[7:15] larger musical composition. So we can
[7:17] say it's self-contained. In other words,
[7:19] it can be played on its own. It can
[7:21] become its own standalone. And maybe we
[7:24] hear a lot of things sometimes where you
[7:26] hear that like oh I really really love
[7:28] that that particular thing. So, do you
[7:29] realize that's one and three of
[7:31] different three different movements
[7:33] where oh, I really love that piece by
[7:34] Beethoven and you think it's really just
[7:36] a five and a half uh uh song minute
[7:39] song, but then it's much a part of a
[7:41] much larger group and so a
[7:43] self-contained section within the larger
[7:47] complete and whole musical composition.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; And within these movements, they have
[7:52] their own tempo, they have their own
[7:53] key, they have their own themes, and
[7:55] even they have their own emotional
[7:56] character. A brother brought one up to
[7:59] me this week after we ministered
[8:00] Wednesday night or even my I think it
[8:02] was around that time Wednesday night how
[8:04] you listen to a certain sonata by
[8:05] Beethoven and you hear the beginning and
[8:08] the middle and the end and just how
[8:10] varied and different those tunes are and
[8:12] how they feel and so there can be just a
[8:14] different even emotional character to a
[8:17] particular movement. Remember this is
[8:19] not a music class. This is about the
[8:22] word.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; And as you start focusing you realize
[8:25] wow different emotional characters to
[8:28] different times and movements. And so an
[8:32] entire musical composition is meant to
[8:34] unfold uh in a sequence to shape a a
[8:37] common theme or unified narrative or
[8:40] even an emotional arc. And so the
[8:42] movement though it can be played in
[8:44] itself and be good and be enjoyed it
[8:46] it's intended to fit with an overall
[8:49] picture so that with that works to
[8:51] unfold in the sequence to to give the
[8:54] full picture the shape a unified
[8:56] narrative an emotional arc so you can
[8:58] see the beginning as it flows to the
[9:00] end.
[9:02] As brother Brandham uses the term
[9:04] symphony quite a bit when he's looking
[9:05] at this concept of God's work being an a
[9:09] composition, a musical composition, he
[9:11] says that he says it's God's symphony.
[9:13] It's God's symphony. A symphony
[9:14] typically features four movements. This
[9:16] is just the typical or most common. And
[9:19] the these four movements are used to
[9:22] unfold an overall story. One piece may
[9:24] tell a story, but you're only getting
[9:26] half the story or a third of the story
[9:28] or a fourth of the story. It's that
[9:30] within the whole that gives you the
[9:32] complete piece, the whole masterpiece
[9:35] in the traditional arrangement and focus
[9:38] on this is I'm going to come back to
[9:40] this here in a little bit in the four
[9:41] part the four movements that unfold uh
[9:44] in a symphony and I'm using this because
[9:45] brother Ram is using the term symphony
[9:47] for us that you have the first part
[9:49] which has a very fast and dramatic
[9:51] opening. Then you have the second
[9:53] movement which is very slow and lyrical.
[9:55] So you have the first movement which is
[9:57] dramatic, very fast. It gets your
[9:58] attention. Then a second slow lyrical
[10:01] movement. Then the third kind of
[10:02] dancelike. I it's more of a lively or or
[10:06] dancing. Kind of has more of a dance
[10:07] theme to it. More movement maybe amongst
[10:09] the bodies. That's the third movement.
[10:11] And then you have this final movement.
[10:12] This last movement is very lively. It's
[10:15] the finale and that's what wraps it up.
[10:17] He said that's a complete work. That's a
[10:19] masterpiece. That that is a finished
[10:21] thing. And when brother Brandham is
[10:24] preaching the mighty God unveiled before
[10:26] us, he's looking at how that by one
[10:28] spirit, we're all baptized in to the
[10:30] body of Christ. So we become part of
[10:32] Christ by that spirit. He says we are
[10:34] invited to share his glory. Now what
[10:37] now? We're invited to share his glory.
[10:39] We're be made partakers of these
[10:41] promises and these precious promises and
[10:43] these scriptures through his spirit by
[10:46] this baptism. He says it's just like a
[10:48] great symphony that's playing out or
[10:50] acting out a drama. So when we are
[10:53] invited to share in his glory, we become
[10:56] a part of this symphony. We have our
[10:59] place within this this work and we say
[11:02] we're not the entire thing.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; You we're not the the complete thing. We
[11:06] realize that there is other parts that
[11:08] fit into this great symphony. In the
[11:11] sermon shalom, he says in paragraph uh
[11:14] 149, he says his word is just like a
[11:16] great symphony. It's where we're drawing
[11:18] this from. And while we're looking at
[11:20] music from a higher level, but then also
[11:22] drilling down on uh momentum or or sheet
[11:25] music and composition and hear movement,
[11:28] his word is just like a great symphony.
[11:30] A symphony is when music is played in a
[11:33] drama. Now, he's given you a definition
[11:35] of what he intends where it's not just
[11:38] free form music where I just kind of I'm
[11:41] going to riff off of what you're doing
[11:42] there and we're just going to see kind
[11:43] of where this goes and it's not uh free
[11:47] form, but it's something that unfolds in
[11:49] a drama to convey something to express
[11:51] something. He says it's all done by
[11:53] signs and motions. And he's referring
[11:55] then, I believe, to the director or the
[11:57] conductor who's conducting things. It's
[11:59] all done by signs and motions, but it
[12:00] acts out a drama in this symphony.
[12:04] And that's what is being portrayed.
[12:05] Often times you may hear music and it's
[12:07] just an instrumental and you enjoy the
[12:09] music but there's a story behind it and
[12:12] there's something being conveyed through
[12:13] those movements and through the styles
[12:15] and through the tempo and the texture
[12:17] that's being expressed in the music. So
[12:20] brother said God's word is like a
[12:21] symphony. It's being played out and it's
[12:24] done by signs and motions and it's
[12:26] acting out. It's expression. There's a
[12:28] performance to this composition.
[12:31] Now to jump right into my emphasis today
[12:35] or how I'm how I'm wanting to use this
[12:38] principle as a way of conveying as a
[12:42] type of this truth of the church ages.
[12:44] The church ages uh work like movements.
[12:47] I want to just use it as a type of
[12:49] movements. In other words, each age has
[12:52] its own tempo. It has its own key. It
[12:54] has its own theme. It has its own
[12:55] character. That's the way that the
[12:57] church ages work. As you look at them,
[12:59] you'll see that there's a rhythm and a
[13:00] character to the church ages. Even with
[13:02] the seven seals, if with the seven
[13:05] seals, you see that there's a certain
[13:06] rhythm to it. There's a certain uh arc
[13:08] to it where there's an announcement,
[13:09] there's an opening, there's an
[13:11] unfolding, there's a there's a sounding,
[13:13] and then there's a there's a falling
[13:15] down. There's different things that take
[13:17] place in each one uh in each one of
[13:21] those elements to the seven seals. So,
[13:22] there's particular characters. You see
[13:24] one part, you say, "Oh, well, there's a
[13:26] trumpet that sounds." Well, look at the
[13:28] context in the whole and you realize,
[13:29] "Oh, that's not under the seal or that's
[13:31] not a seal opening. That's just a
[13:33] trumpet sounding." But in the seven
[13:35] seals, there's an announcement, there's
[13:37] an opening, there's an unfolding,
[13:39] there's a there's a sounding, and
[13:41] there's different things that take place
[13:42] under these seals, just as there is, and
[13:45] those work together even with the church
[13:46] ages. But I don't really know how to
[13:48] read sheet music, so I'm not going to
[13:49] try to make that work
[13:52] in terms of music. But there's a way
[13:54] that they overlap and you realize, wow,
[13:55] they're part of the same composition.
[13:57] The seals and the church ages work
[13:59] together. There's an overlapping to it.
[14:01] Now, if you look at Revelations chapter
[14:03] 1, I'd just like to read verses 12, 13,
[14:05] and 14 so we could get this image of
[14:10] these church ages. And I turned to see
[14:12] the voice that spake with me because now
[14:14] he's he is in the spirit of the Lord on
[14:16] the Lord's day. There's something to
[14:17] that. So he's he's caught up in this uh
[14:20] realm of prophecy and into an a heavenly
[14:23] realm. And being turned, I saw seven
[14:26] golden candlesticks. And in the midst of
[14:28] the seven golden candle, seven
[14:30] candlesticks, one like unto the son of
[14:32] man. Now he's described clothed with a
[14:35] garment down to the foot and g about the
[14:37] paps with a golden girdle. And his head
[14:40] and his hairs were white like wool, as
[14:42] white as snow, and his eyes were as the
[14:44] flame of fire.
[14:46] So we see here in looking at this that
[14:50] there is a picture he's trying to convey
[14:53] through words and we could just
[14:54] summarize it very easily by saying
[14:56] there's a picture of Christ standing in
[14:59] the midst of the church. That's what we
[15:02] understand this to be. Christ standing
[15:04] in the midst of the church. So this one
[15:06] who stands in the midst of the seven
[15:09] candlesticks in the middle of the seven
[15:11] golden candlesticks is Christ. And then
[15:13] Christ tells us in verse 20 uh these
[15:16] different elements that we read about
[15:18] the mystery of the seven stars which
[15:19] thou sawest in my right hand and the
[15:22] seven golden candlesticks. Here's the
[15:24] mystery. The seven stars are the angels
[15:27] or the messengers to the seven churches.
[15:29] And the seven candlesticks which thou
[15:31] sawest are the seven churches. So
[15:34] there's really no mystery in terms of
[15:37] what th those symbols represent. But
[15:39] there is still yet an unfolding of what
[15:41] those actual messengers and churches
[15:44] will be. But as Jesus said, I am alpha
[15:46] and omega, the first and the last. What
[15:49] thou seeest write in a book and send it
[15:52] to the seven churches which are in Asia.
[15:54] Just even in that sense, he's going to
[15:56] write in the book. Now, here comes it's
[15:57] like a composition. Write in a book.
[16:00] Write these things. And it's Christ that
[16:02] he sees in the middle of the church. In
[16:05] Psalms 22:22, as we read recently, I
[16:08] will declare thy name unto my brethren.
[16:11] In the midst of the congregation will I
[16:13] praise thee. Here, this prophecy in
[16:16] Psalms 22 is now being expressed. In the
[16:18] midst of the seven churches is Christ
[16:22] standing, and it's Christ praising,
[16:25] Christ in the midst of the church. But
[16:28] it's not just praises. That word praise
[16:31] has a musical connotation. But in
[16:33] Hebrews 2:12, saying, I will declare thy
[16:36] name unto my brethren, in the midst of
[16:39] the church will I sing praise unto thee.
[16:42] So here's Christ in the midst of the
[16:44] seven golden candlesticks that John
[16:46] sees. And there's prophecy in the Old
[16:49] Testament carried into the New Testament
[16:51] that Christ will be in the church
[16:53] singing.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; And as Christ is in the church singing,
[16:57] it's not just a solo. It's not just him
[17:00] regailing us with his vocalization. and
[17:02] his great control. But it's Christ as
[17:05] the director. He's leading the church
[17:08] according to God's composition.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; He's an impelling force.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit in the church. He
[17:15] prophesied of this in John 14 26. But
[17:18] the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,
[17:20] whom the father will send in my name, he
[17:22] shall teach you all things and bring all
[17:25] things to remembrance whatsoever I've
[17:27] said unto you. Amen.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; So this the Holy Ghost is the inside
[17:32] teacher. He's the teacher.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; He's going to teach you. What is he
[17:35] going to teach you? The word of God.
[17:37] What is he then going to do? Bring it to
[17:39] your remembrance.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Just as in a symphony or an orchestra.
[17:42] And if anybody was in band, there's a
[17:44] constant practice. You're being taught.
[17:46] You're learning the sheet music. It's
[17:47] being taught. You're learning it. You're
[17:48] learning it. And then a lot, it's not
[17:50] just learning the music. You do it for
[17:52] performance. There's something where you
[17:54] demonstrate this talent, what you've
[17:56] been learning, but it's done for this
[17:57] performance. And then even at the time
[17:59] of the performance, you're not just on
[18:01] your own. The same one who's been
[18:03] teaching you, the same one who's been
[18:04] guiding you, the same one that's been
[18:05] showing you things will bring things to
[18:07] your remembrance through the signs and
[18:09] motions,
[18:11] &gt;&gt; giving the tempo, telling when something
[18:12] needs to happen. And there's ways that
[18:15] cues that are being given. This is what
[18:16] the Holy Spirit is to do alongside you,
[18:18] the inside teacher, teaching you, and
[18:21] then putting it into practice. Chapter
[18:24] 15:es 26 and 27. But when the comforter
[18:27] has come whom I will send unto you from
[18:30] the father, even the spirit of truth. So
[18:32] the comforter is the teacher and it's
[18:35] the spirit of truth. It's the holy
[18:36] spirit which proceeded from the father.
[18:38] He shall testify of me. There's going to
[18:42] be an instruct instruction to testify to
[18:45] implore. There's going to be some
[18:47] encouragement, some teaching, some
[18:49] direction, some dis discipling. He's
[18:51] going to implore in witness of the
[18:54] father. And then in turn, verse 27, and
[18:56] ye shall bear witness. It's the same
[18:58] word you're going to implore. So as the
[19:01] the conductor directs you with the mind
[19:03] of how it's to sound, and as he teaches
[19:05] you, you become the sounding out
[19:07] yourself, and you shall bear witness
[19:09] because you've been with me from the
[19:11] beginning. Chapter 16:es 13 to 15. How
[19:14] be it, when he, the spirit of truth, has
[19:16] come, he will guide you into all truth.
[19:20] This is this direction. He's going to
[19:22] lead you. He's going to guide you into
[19:23] all truth. For he shall not speak of
[19:25] himself, but whatsoever things he shall
[19:27] hear, that shall he speak, and he will
[19:29] show you things to come. Now, I want you
[19:31] to focus on that part. He will show you
[19:34] things to come. Even when there's a a
[19:37] choir director, and there's one that is
[19:40] uh conducting an orchestra, I'm not one
[19:43] of these. I I wouldn't even pretend to
[19:45] know uh um what the hand gestures are,
[19:48] but sometimes you see there's sound
[19:50] happening and all of a sudden you see
[19:51] this little bug bunny. That's the one
[19:52] I'll imitate, right? Just get that going
[19:54] over here and he's conducting something
[19:56] over here and it and it's long before it
[19:58] happens, but it's a signal to somebody
[20:01] who knows our part's coming, right? And
[20:04] as they're getting ready and maybe they
[20:06] begin their tune, then there's something
[20:07] that's being drawn up and then he takes
[20:08] his hand out and the glove stays there.
[20:11] And that's just what I know how the
[20:12] conductors work according to Warner
[20:14] Brothers. And so it says the spirit of
[20:16] truth is come. He'll guide you into all
[20:18] truth. He'll show you things to come.
[20:20] He's even going to prophesy going to
[20:22] tell you what's going to happen. So
[20:24] you're not going to be left blind. It's
[20:26] not a jazz composition. And you just try
[20:29] to find well where's you know I want to
[20:31] get in the groove and where where's he
[20:32] at? Where's he going? And you just work
[20:33] together enough to where I know where
[20:34] he's going on this one. You go ahead
[20:36] buddy. No, it's a it's a he tells you
[20:38] ahead of time what's going to happen.
[20:40] Show you things to come. He shall
[20:42] glorify me. There's praises given.
[20:44] There's singing. He's going to glorify
[20:45] for he shall receive of mine and shall
[20:47] show it unto you. All things that the
[20:50] father hath are mine. Therefore said I
[20:52] that he shall take of mine and shall
[20:54] show it unto you. So notice when he says
[20:56] he shall glorify me and and shall
[20:58] receive of mine and show it unto you.
[21:00] He's saying but what I have is the
[21:01] father's. So the glorification is to
[21:04] God. It's to the father. Here's Christ.
[21:06] Here's the Holy Spirit, the comforter,
[21:08] the spirit of truth, the Holy Ghost in
[21:09] the church in these church ages as
[21:12] they're represented here leading a
[21:15] symphony
[21:16] leading God's body leading the body of
[21:18] Christ which we is how we share in his
[21:21] glory. Brother Bam said the voice of
[21:22] Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost down
[21:24] through the ages. Amen.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; That's what's being depicted in this
[21:28] imagery is the voice of Jesus Christ by
[21:31] the Holy Ghost down through the ages by
[21:33] his messengers and by the individuals
[21:35] who are part of that symphony. Now in
[21:38] Revelations 1 15 and 16, if we could
[21:41] look at this just a little bit more,
[21:43] we'll find that it says it characterizes
[21:47] his feet like unto fine brass, as if
[21:50] they burned in a furnace. If one was
[21:52] just really wanting to become typeheavy,
[21:55] you say, "Well, there's your brass
[21:56] instruments." And uh and there's a
[21:58] sounding in that, but we don't need to
[21:59] lean too much into it because sometimes
[22:01] I think you just fall over if you try
[22:03] too hard. But his feet were like unto
[22:05] fine brass as if they burned in a
[22:06] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[22:09] many waters. And he had in his right
[22:12] hand seven stars, which we know are the
[22:13] seven angels and messengers. And out of
[22:15] his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword,
[22:17] and his countenance was as the sun
[22:19] shineth in his strength. So there's a
[22:21] lot of details in this that express
[22:25] his nature, his character. It's in
[22:28] symbolic form. So we're not looking for
[22:31] a 900 foot Jesus with um Air Force ones
[22:35] that are brass.
[22:38] We're not looking for something that's
[22:40] going to look a particular way um just
[22:43] so strictly according to this
[22:44] description. But these things are
[22:46] symbolic. And it says that his voice was
[22:48] like the sound of many waters. This
[22:50] phrase, the sound of many waters, is
[22:52] musical. It's a polyonic sound where
[22:55] there's a lot of different sounds that
[22:57] create and produce uh the sound of an
[22:59] ocean.
[23:01] A and there's tone to it. And there's
[23:03] different uh pitches that even in the
[23:05] roar of of of water. That's why water
[23:09] can be very pleasing and satisfying and
[23:12] very restful. So, it evokes this this
[23:15] thought of saying this the sound of many
[23:17] waters. It evokes some deep resounding
[23:20] rhythm. There's a rhythm to it. In
[23:22] Psalms 29:es 3-4, the voice of the Lord
[23:25] is upon the waters. The glory and the
[23:28] God of glory thunderareth. The Lord is
[23:30] upon many waters. The voice of the Lord
[23:32] is powerful. The voice of the Lord is
[23:34] full of majesty. So here there's in in
[23:37] type this expression when you hear uh uh
[23:40] the waves roaring and you see the the
[23:42] the majesty of the sea. There's this the
[23:45] voice of the Lord is upon the waters.
[23:47] This is some greatness, some majesty.
[23:49] The voice of the Lord is powerful. So
[23:51] God's voice is associated with and
[23:54] likened unto waters.
[23:57] In Psalms 96 11-13, he says, "Let the
[24:00] heavens rejoice. Let the earth be glad.
[24:02] Let the sea roar and the fullness
[24:05] thereof. Now the sea is being given
[24:07] character to roar to the fullness
[24:10] thereof. The depths of it, the deep is
[24:11] how the sea is often referred to. Let it
[24:13] let it pour out praise. Let the field be
[24:15] joyful. So now the field is being
[24:18] characterized in its movements as joyful
[24:21] and all that there that is therein. Then
[24:23] shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
[24:28] &gt;&gt; before the Lord. So this is this is
[24:30] characterizing nature in a worshipful
[24:32] way having some sort of expression in
[24:36] its movement and its sound as praise.
[24:39] For he cometh for he cometh to judge the
[24:41] earth. He shall judge the world with
[24:42] righteousness and the people with his
[24:44] truth. And so this is the impetus to the
[24:46] praise in chapter 28 or excuse me 98.
[24:51] Make a joyful noise unto the Lord all
[24:53] the earth. Make a loud noise and rejoice
[24:55] and sing praise. This is all the earth.
[24:58] Sing unto the Lord with a harp, with the
[25:00] harp and the voice of a psalm, with
[25:02] trumpets and the sound of a cornet. Make
[25:03] a joyful noise before the king Lord the
[25:05] King. Let the sea roar and the fullness
[25:08] thereof. This is this is not
[25:12] uh a discordant sound. It's going to
[25:15] blend
[25:16] with all this praise with the trumpets
[25:18] and the cornet and the a and the the
[25:21] harps. All this. It says, "Let the sea
[25:23] let the sea roar and the fullness
[25:26] thereof." This isn't chaotic.
[25:29] This is musical. The world and they that
[25:31] dwell therein. Let the floods clap their
[25:34] hands.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; So there's a very explicit
[25:39] expression that the waters clap their
[25:41] hands. Let the hills be joyful together.
[25:45] Bible even speaks of the hills dancing
[25:47] and skipping before the Lord. For he
[25:48] cometh to judge the earth with
[25:49] righteousness. He shall judge the world
[25:51] and the people with equity. So if the
[25:53] judge is at hand, that's that's when
[25:55] there is a an expression back to him.
[25:59] Isaiah 44:23, "Sing, oh ye heavens, for
[26:02] the Lord hath done it. Shout ye lower
[26:04] parts of the earth. Break forth into
[26:06] singing the lower parts of the depths of
[26:08] the sea. Break forth into singing, ye
[26:10] mountains, O forest, and every tree
[26:13] therein.
[26:15] For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob and
[26:16] glorified himself in Israel." So here
[26:18] again is this singing this uh expression
[26:21] of praise and worship in Revelations
[26:23] 14:es 2 and 3. And I heard a voice from
[26:26] heaven as the voice of many waters and
[26:28] as the voice of a great thunder. These
[26:31] things working together. There's that
[26:32] resounding rhythm, a drum, a thundering,
[26:36] the voice of many waters together with
[26:38] it. And I heard the voice of harpers
[26:39] harping with their harps and they sung
[26:42] as it were a new song. This is not one
[26:45] thing and another. This is all working
[26:47] together. that the voice of many waters
[26:49] is expressed through the drum and the
[26:51] harp and together it it forms this
[26:54] natural polyonic sound.
[26:58] Then there's the inverse of this in
[27:00] Revelations chapter 17 as it begins to
[27:03] describe
[27:04] the great that sits upon many
[27:07] waters. And so here we and we know
[27:10] waters represents people. And so people
[27:13] can have the capacity to great harmony
[27:14] and beauty or they can have a great
[27:16] capacity to evil. But here sitting upon
[27:19] many waters, it is not in a very
[27:21] pleasing harmonious sense. But as Isaiah
[27:24] 17 tells us, "Woe to the multitude of
[27:26] many people which make a noise like the
[27:29] noise of the seas." Now this is this is
[27:32] a judgment upon this noise. Isaiah
[27:35] 17:12-13 it says and the to the rushing
[27:37] of nations that make a rushing like the
[27:39] rushing of mighty waters the nations
[27:42] shall rush like the rushing of many
[27:43] waters but God shall rebuke them. So
[27:47] this is not a sound that pleases him.
[27:49] God this is not the same sound he said
[27:51] the voice of God is like the sound of
[27:52] many waters. This sound is tumultuous
[27:54] and chaotic. This has a different
[27:56] texture
[27:58] than the sound of God's people as the
[28:00] voice of many waters. This has a
[28:01] different tone. There's a different
[28:04] dynamic and rhythm to this. Just as
[28:06] Moses when he was on top of the mountain
[28:07] and he was coming down, he says, he
[28:09] says, "Well, I I hear the sound of war."
[28:11] And he could tell just by the music,
[28:14] something was wrong.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; He could tell that just by the way the
[28:18] rhythm or the way that the people
[28:20] expressing themselves that it wasn't the
[28:22] kind of worship that they had given at
[28:23] the Red Sea.
[28:26] Though they might have used that for
[28:28] their excuse,
[28:30] it can have a different texture to it, a
[28:32] dynamic to it.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Some sometimes we can say, well, what we
[28:38] need is dynamics, so that's just what we
[28:40] get. We just get whatever dynamics we
[28:42] can. And let me tell you, there is a
[28:45] huge misunderstanding of what dynamics
[28:47] are.
[28:50] Or there can be. Everybody's like, "Oh
[28:52] man, I didn't realize I didn't know."
[28:53] But there can be a tremendous
[28:54] misrepresentation of what dynamics are.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; So coming back to our text, Revelations
[29:01] 1:es 10 and 11.
[29:04] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[29:08] and heard behind me a great voice as a
[29:10] trumpet saying, I am alpha and omega. So
[29:14] now even the voice of Christ is
[29:17] characterized as a musical instrument
[29:20] saying I am alpha and omega. So there's
[29:22] a beginning and there's the end. The
[29:24] first and the last. Something that
[29:26] starts it and there's something that
[29:28] finishes it. Says what thou seeest write
[29:31] in a book. Just using this type of maybe
[29:34] a musical composition
[29:37] and send it unto the seven churches
[29:38] which are in Asia under the Ephesus and
[29:41] unto Samrna unto Ephesus and unto Smyrna
[29:43] and under Pergamis and under Thotyra and
[29:46] under Sardis and unto Philadelphia and
[29:48] unto Leo dea.
[29:51] doesn't take long to read it, but if you
[29:53] aren't familiar with it, and the next
[29:54] two chapters, chapter two and chapter
[29:56] three, the things that he's asked to
[29:58] write in a book are recorded in the next
[30:00] these ch next two chapters. Uh the
[30:04] letter or the message to seven churches.
[30:08] Now, this doesn't come as any surprise
[30:10] to us as message believers, but I'm just
[30:12] going to cover this maybe in an
[30:13] elementary way, but the seven churches
[30:15] in Asia are these are not an address to
[30:18] the church as it presently set in that
[30:21] they needed to have this for the moment
[30:23] that then at that time, but it's for
[30:26] church. They're they're using these
[30:28] churches are being sent letters for
[30:31] future church ages. So, it's prophetic
[30:33] regarding how it will unfold. is
[30:35] prophetic regarding a future unfolding.
[30:39] Revelations 1 verse 19, he says, "Write
[30:41] the things which thou has seen and the
[30:43] things which are and the things which
[30:45] shall be hereafter."
[30:47] So the Holy Spirit, the comforter is
[30:49] going to tell you things to come. It's
[30:51] going to give you a road map of what to
[30:53] expect and what's going to unfold. Now,
[30:56] I'll acknowledge now that at the time
[30:59] that John's in, he's caught up into
[31:02] etern an eternal realm. So you could see
[31:04] all history in that sense. But what he's
[31:07] g telling him when he in his present
[31:09] time the things that are going to happen
[31:12] are in the future. Now for us we read it
[31:16] and we start looking past at what's
[31:17] already been expressed.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; If we could time travel and and we were
[31:23] found ourselves with John on on Patmas,
[31:25] we'd say, "Oh,
[31:28] I know exactly what's being said here.
[31:31] This is what's going to happen. this is
[31:32] what's going to respond and this is how
[31:33] it's going to finish and this and we
[31:35] would have a little bit more
[31:36] understanding specifically of where
[31:38] things were going to go to write the
[31:40] things which will shall be hereafter.
[31:43] Verse three of the same chapter, blessed
[31:44] is he that reth and they that hear the
[31:47] words of this prophecy.
[31:50] So it's prophesying future things and
[31:52] keep those things which were written
[31:53] therein for the time is at hand. So I'm
[31:57] going to tell you what you should do.
[32:00] I'm going to tell you what the the uh
[32:03] climate's going to be like. I'm going
[32:04] tell you what the societyy's going to be
[32:05] like. I'm going to tell you what the
[32:06] pressures are. I'm going to tell you
[32:07] what the tension's going to be. I'm
[32:08] going to tell you all the forces are
[32:10] going to be oppos you. But I'm going to
[32:11] tell you what you need to do in your
[32:13] age.
[32:14] That's prophecy beforehand.
[32:17] And then blessed is he who does what I
[32:20] tell them to do.
[32:23] We realize that these churches that are
[32:26] mentioned are limited to a very small
[32:29] area in the western part of Asia Minor
[32:31] in present day Turkey.
[32:34] But just as the seven stars are not
[32:37] literally in Christ's hand and it's not
[32:39] literal stars from heaven but
[32:42] represented future messengers, these
[32:43] seven churches ti are typed or these
[32:46] seven churches typed by these churches
[32:48] in Asia represent future time intervals.
[32:52] to come.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; So, there's going to be an Ephesus age
[32:56] and then there's going to be a change
[32:58] and there's going to be another age and
[33:00] there's going to walk through these
[33:01] different ages, each one having its own
[33:03] distinct character, its own messenger,
[33:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[33:06] &gt;&gt; And there's going to be a rhythm to it.
[33:08] Paul says in Ephesians chapter 2:7 that
[33:10] in the ages to come, he might show the
[33:14] exceeding riches of his grace and and
[33:15] his kindness towards us through Jesus
[33:18] Christ. Christ in the midst of seven
[33:20] golden candlesticks which are the seven
[33:22] church ages which are the ages then to
[33:25] come. The seven churches are the ages to
[33:27] be hereafter.
[33:29] There's prophecy about how the gentile
[33:32] ages are going to unfold.
[33:36] I trust that you're each one of you
[33:38] individually are kind of collecting
[33:40] together on where we are in this.
[33:42] in Revelations 2:es 1:4. Let's just look
[33:45] at this first movement as it were. Unto
[33:49] the angel of the church of Ephesus,
[33:50] write these things saith he that holdeth
[33:53] the seven stars in his right hand. Well,
[33:55] this is the beginning, right? So again,
[33:57] there's this setting the stage, this
[33:58] dramatic opening. You find that in the
[34:01] idea of a symphony, that dramatic
[34:03] opening uh sometimes very quick. It's
[34:06] going to get to the point. He says, "The
[34:07] seven stars in his right hand, which are
[34:09] the seven messengers, who walketh in the
[34:11] midst of the seven golden candlesticks,
[34:13] which are the seven church ages." And
[34:15] now his this is where we set the scene.
[34:19] I know thy works and thy labor and thy
[34:22] patience, and how cannot bear them which
[34:25] are evil, and thou hast tried them,
[34:27] which say they're apostles, and are not,
[34:29] and hast found them liars, and has
[34:31] borne, and has patience, and for thy
[34:33] name's sake hast labored, and has not
[34:36] fainted. We look back historically and
[34:39] we impose that over the that age, and we
[34:41] can see it. Like, there you go. There
[34:43] you go. There you go. But if we were
[34:45] living in the age and we knew this was
[34:47] for us, we'd say, "I my works, my labor,
[34:51] my patience," we would know our
[34:53] character and what we ought to perform.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I have somewhat against
[34:57] thee because thou hast left thy first
[34:59] love. Think of it this way that this is
[35:01] sheet music for future ages here
[35:04] symbolically condensed.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; But it represents a a movement within a
[35:09] larger composition. Amen.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; It's telling us if we look at it from
[35:14] the standpoint of prophecy, say, "Well,
[35:16] oh, I I see this symbol here and I see
[35:18] this marking here and algro and and
[35:20] this. I see all these details." And if
[35:22] you don't know music, you don't know
[35:24] exactly what that means. And so, when
[35:27] there's symbol forms, it's in symbol
[35:29] form. You can say, "Well, it represents
[35:31] something." But then once you know what
[35:32] the symbols are, it gives body, it gives
[35:34] texture, gives tone, it gives a timber
[35:37] to it. There's some there's something in
[35:39] there. You can even see op there's the
[35:41] accidentals.
[35:43] But here he says they will leave their
[35:45] first love in Matthew 24:12. And because
[35:47] iniquity shall abound, the love of many
[35:49] shall wax cold.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; And so it's iniquity which causes this
[35:56] letting go of the first love. In 2
[35:58] Thessalonians chapter 2:es 3-10, we'll
[36:01] just summarize it very quickly. Paul
[36:03] prophesies of a falling away because of
[36:05] the mystery of iniquity. Right?
[36:08] &gt;&gt; So, here is the Bible. Jesus is
[36:10] prophesying ahead of time, there'll be a
[36:11] fallen away or there's going to be the
[36:14] love of me is going to wax cold. Paul
[36:15] says, "You don't even have a love of the
[36:17] truth."
[36:18] &gt;&gt; And because of the mystery of iniquity,
[36:20] it's going to cause people to let go of
[36:23] their passion and their ardent
[36:24] dedication to the pure word of God and
[36:26] adopt creeds and hybrid the gospel.
[36:31] And so we can see then that just as
[36:34] Revelations chapter 2 verse4 says, this
[36:37] is future prophecy.
[36:39] And we can see it unfold.
[36:42] As the age unfolds,
[36:45] it happens just as the word has said.
[36:47] The notes, the chords, the labor, the
[36:50] works, the patience, the trying, the
[36:52] highs and the lows, they're all laid out
[36:54] in it.
[36:56] If we were able to uh if we were able to
[36:59] give a
[37:01] u
[37:03] a temperature
[37:05] to that age and a and a temperature to
[37:08] that scripture, you'd find they're
[37:10] exactly the same.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; If we were to represent it a graphically
[37:14] in terms of sound or an equalizer, you'd
[37:16] find it's just exactly that sound print
[37:19] be exactly as it is. Its waveform to be
[37:22] exactly as the scripture said it was.
[37:24] Now, let's just look at verse verse 8
[37:27] and just look at a different uh church
[37:29] age here and the next one, the church to
[37:31] SRA. It's a shorter one, so we'll we'll
[37:33] see maybe a little bit more elements
[37:34] that you'll see in all the ages, but we
[37:36] just kind of cut them out a little bit
[37:37] in the first one. It says, "And under
[37:39] the angel of the church in Smyrna,
[37:41] right? Though there was a church there
[37:43] then present." Paul wrote a letter to
[37:45] the Ephesians. This is representing the
[37:47] second church age or as I'm putting it
[37:49] today in type, the second movement.
[37:52] These things sayaith the first and the
[37:53] last which was dead and is alive. I know
[37:55] thy works and tribulation and poverty
[37:58] but thou art rich. And I know the
[38:00] blasphemy of them which say they are
[38:02] Jews and are not, but are of the
[38:04] synagogue of Satan. So now this is a
[38:05] different tone than what we have in the
[38:08] first one.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Different emotional arc. There's
[38:10] something different that's taking place
[38:12] in this than what took place in the
[38:14] first. He says, I I know your works,
[38:16] tribulation, poverty. It's creating a
[38:18] different feel uh feeling. Fear none of
[38:20] those things which thou shalt suffer.
[38:22] Behold, the devil shall cast some of you
[38:24] into prison that you may be tried. You
[38:26] shall have tribulation 10 days. Be thou
[38:28] faithful unto death, and I will give
[38:30] thee a crown of life. Telling them
[38:32] what's going to happen
[38:35] &gt;&gt; ahead of time to know. Now
[38:38] I I say this um
[38:42] we have the benefit of the history
[38:43] unfolding and hindsight's 2020 and
[38:46] prophetic hindsight is even clearer to
[38:50] know that these things are so
[38:52] &gt;&gt; and there's a lot of historians and and
[38:55] theologians and different ones that have
[38:56] looked back historically at the church
[38:58] and they themselves have recognized
[39:00] these church ages and and draw it out
[39:03] and map it out
[39:06] And
[39:08] we can look at this and read this and
[39:10] see what they did. Wouldn't it wouldn't
[39:13] it have been really really neat though
[39:14] if you're in that age to know this was
[39:15] your promise
[39:17] and I'm going to be I'm going to be
[39:19] tested. I'm going to be tried but hold
[39:20] out because there's a crown of life to
[39:21] be given to me. He that hath an ear, let
[39:24] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[39:25] churches. That comforter, the spirit of
[39:27] truth. He that overcometh shall not be
[39:29] hurt of the second death. You find
[39:32] there's a certain rhythm. There are
[39:33] certain elements to each one of these
[39:35] movements as I have it just written down
[39:36] here. This salutation, a compliment, a
[39:38] complaint, and a reward or warning and
[39:42] reward
[39:44] and they're all to be expressed in their
[39:46] time.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Historically, we say, well, Revelations
[39:50] chapter 2 talks about tribulation and
[39:51] persecution and being cast into prison.
[39:53] And at the end of the second century,
[39:55] the persecution of the Christian church
[39:56] intensifies to where during the third
[39:59] century, we see that great persecution
[40:01] of the church begin
[40:03] &gt;&gt; and it coincides with these ages and
[40:06] even there's overlapping with the seals.
[40:10] And so the condition of the church
[40:14] a and future time periods and I'm just
[40:16] giving that summary because I know
[40:17] you're all here. Everyone here is well
[40:19] taught and your Bible readers and
[40:20] students of the message well taught
[40:22] through years not just here uh maybe
[40:24] especially not here but in other places
[40:26] you know these things but we could see
[40:27] then the church that has unfolded since
[40:29] this prophecy of given was given and the
[40:32] future time periods fits with Christ's
[40:35] address to the seven churches.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; We'll see that there was a messenger and
[40:40] what he taught and these different
[40:41] things unfold perfectly. So God
[40:45] chooses these cities.
[40:48] I chooses the churches of these cities
[40:50] because they have certain
[40:52] characteristics that foreshadow the
[40:54] future ages. I'm going to choose this
[40:56] one because Leodysia because it's named
[40:59] after this wealthy uh divorcee woman and
[41:03] she it consolidates power and she has
[41:05] great wealth and she has great power and
[41:07] there's even the history of the city. go
[41:09] and you read the church age book, you'll
[41:11] find that even when it comes to Smyrna
[41:12] and Sardis and all these places, there's
[41:14] some character even about the region,
[41:16] the economics, its political history
[41:18] that fits with the the message to the
[41:21] church because there's other parts that
[41:23] are being played.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; And so he chooses the characteristics of
[41:27] the city or he chooses the city and the
[41:30] church because the characteristics that
[41:32] are going to be present in that age.
[41:34] Right.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in the sermon has
[41:37] unfailing words of promise.
[41:40] He says
[41:42] he says today when denominations are
[41:44] saying come here and come there. It's
[41:48] this is a good phrase here to remember.
[41:49] It's the old trend of some school or
[41:51] something.
[41:53] They just can't seem to get out of this
[41:55] trend. This cycle the old trend. They
[41:57] they they'll rebrand it. They'll call it
[42:00] something else. All right. You could you
[42:03] could preach for 40 years against the
[42:04] Thunders and when you roll out Thunders
[42:07] 2.0, you're not going to call it
[42:08] Thunders 2.0.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; You're going to call it the bride's
[42:11] revival, but it's nothing more than the
[42:14] same old thing rebranded.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; And so he says it's the old trend of
[42:19] some school or something. He says, which
[42:20] is perfectly all right. It has to be
[42:23] there. It's part of the symphony. Right.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; So there's this is where to me it
[42:29] becomes even more like whoa you're going
[42:32] to play.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; You're going to be playing to some
[42:35] symphony. You're going to be playing
[42:36] some part.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; He said it's all part of the symphony.
[42:42] So when God chooses these churches, he
[42:44] says, "Oh, there's this wickedness.
[42:46] There's this economic condition. There's
[42:48] this ge uh geographical resource.
[42:50] There's these different things." And it
[42:52] all speaks to the condition of the age.
[42:55] Even when it comes to the science and
[42:56] medicine, there's ways that you can find
[42:58] direct connections to the characters,
[43:00] the character of the church and those
[43:02] that oppose it in future ages that then
[43:06] existed at the time that Jesus is
[43:08] telling John to write the composition.
[43:13] In the sermon shalom, the one in January
[43:15] 12th of ' 64,
[43:18] he says they had a sheet in their hand,
[43:20] but what but what would they do?
[43:25] I I use my own summary here in
[43:27] non-alics,
[43:29] but listen to this closely. They were
[43:31] trying to look back to a beat that had
[43:34] already been played out.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; You know, when somebody sampled that too
[43:38] much, he said, "It's already been played
[43:41] out." That's what the churches do today.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; They look back, see what part Luther
[43:48] played, the Lutheran does. They don't
[43:50] know the change of music. Amen.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; So there's brother Ram using a very
[43:55] specific language. If you're sitting
[43:56] there going, "How in the world did
[43:58] Brother Aaron come up with the idea that
[44:00] the church ages had like their own sheet
[44:02] music?" I didn't come up with it.
[44:06] Maybe I shouldn't have said anything. I
[44:09] didn't come up with it. Brother Brandham
[44:11] says it.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; I keep This is what I keep seeing.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; They played They see what he played and
[44:18] they play it. They don't know the change
[44:19] of music.
[44:21] They don't know what God's doing today
[44:23] when he does these things. The Lutheran,
[44:25] the Pentecost say, "Oh, we got it." And
[44:29] this statement here is never been more
[44:31] true. You got sheet, a sheet that played
[44:34] out 50 years ago,
[44:38] &gt;&gt; and this is exactly they're playing a
[44:40] hundredy old sheet music,
[44:43] &gt;&gt; trying to drum it up
[44:44] &gt;&gt; as if that's where the music is today.
[44:48] says certainly
[44:50] let's just keep his word in our hands
[44:52] and watch when the changes come then
[44:54] we'll know what we're doing.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; It's got to be according to the word.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Now there here in the trouble because
[45:00] then you could take you could take the
[45:02] word and like well no no right over here
[45:05] says right here in Revelations 3 under
[45:07] the church in Philadelphia says it right
[45:09] there. It's in there said but what time
[45:10] are we in?
[45:12] &gt;&gt; They'll take they could take quotes and
[45:13] you could stack them up say whoa whoa
[45:15] whoa right here. Brother Brandham says
[45:16] it simply. You're getting all your pages
[45:17] out of order.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; You're holding a sheet that worked 50
[45:21] years ago. You're trying to drum up
[45:23] things from the message that that were
[45:25] from 50 years ago,
[45:27] &gt;&gt; but how does it look today?
[45:30] &gt;&gt; What what was what if we look at how
[45:31] what how does that piece fit
[45:35] &gt;&gt; within the overall composition
[45:38] &gt;&gt; so that we don't get it wrong?
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Where you got your cow up in the tree
[45:41] chewing a grass.
[45:45] So, I like this part as he continues.
[45:49] He says, "You know what? We're doing
[45:51] now. Begin with him right here. I don't
[45:52] know if you're following along, Brother
[45:53] Jack. Now, and begin with him at the
[45:55] cross. Repent and be baptized in the
[45:57] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[45:59] of sins, and you shall receive the
[46:01] music,
[46:02] the direction.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; See, his word, the Holy Ghost, that
[46:07] manifest the word." This is Brother
[46:09] Brandham that ties these things
[46:10] together. He ties the comforter and the
[46:12] spirit of truth to the music, the the
[46:13] the direction, the leader. Says, "Then
[46:16] follow through with the rhythm of the
[46:18] word." Whatever the music beats for that
[46:21] hour, beat with it.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Don't keep trying to go back to brother
[46:27] said, "Brother Bam said he was going to
[46:28] be this. He said I was going to be going
[46:29] to say this." Like, yes, that's true. He
[46:31] said that in Rejected King. Yes, it's
[46:32] true. He said that there. Yes, it's
[46:34] true. He said that there. But did you
[46:35] follow the sheet music? Amen.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Did you catch when the music changed and
[46:40] it wasn't it shall be but thus sayeth
[46:43] the Lord it is. He said it will be and
[46:45] this is and that there was a change to
[46:47] where we it's our time now
[46:50] &gt;&gt; that brother Brandham was there as a
[46:52] director saying this is it right here.
[46:53] It's coming. It's coming now. It is.
[46:55] It's moved into that cycle. Here we are
[46:56] &gt;&gt; and we're all not just sitting there
[46:58] waiting. Well, I can't wait till we have
[47:00] that huge concert in the tent, man.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and by then your the c the
[47:04] read on your saxophone is split and dead
[47:06] and there's so many cobwebs and dust in
[47:08] your trumpet and the the leather on the
[47:10] the drums is dried and cracked and
[47:12] everybody forgot the tone and the tune
[47:14] and nobody knows what to do
[47:16] &gt;&gt; cuz everybody been sitting around
[47:17] rusting
[47:19] [Music]
[47:23] &gt;&gt; follow through with the rhythm of the
[47:24] word. He says you're holding sheet music
[47:26] that played out 50 years ago.
[47:28] He he even talks about it to those at at
[47:31] Life Tabernacle there in Shreveport.
[47:33] It's one of his constant rebukes to that
[47:35] church which to me would kind of
[47:36] represent maybe that pinnacle that
[47:38] Pentecostal movement who identify
[47:41] themselves and even still presently
[47:43] today there's those who identify their
[47:46] movement
[47:48] their movement with Isuza revival
[47:51] &gt;&gt; the Pentecostal outpouring in Leodysia
[47:54] their movement is associated with those
[47:56] those prayer meetings and bullets
[47:57] falling off addresses and those things
[47:59] that's how they identify
[48:02] where they are in the sheet music right
[48:03] now.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; And one of the things they tell you is
[48:07] they say, "Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no,
[48:10] no, no, no, no, no, no. I know Brother
[48:12] Bham said, I know he said that, but
[48:16] that's not true.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; We're playing out today what they were
[48:21] practicing in 1906."
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Like that. No, that was that wasn't that
[48:26] really wasn't a Pentecostal. That wasn't
[48:28] really genuine. That wasn't really that
[48:30] wasn't really Leodosia. I was just ah,
[48:32] well, we don't really know what it was.
[48:33] And I know Brother Bam said a lot of
[48:34] things about it, but this fits where I
[48:37] want to be. This is where I feel good.
[48:39] This is this is my favorite part of the
[48:41] orchestra. So, humor me a little bit.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; And they want you to think that we have
[48:47] to play the part that the Pentecostals
[48:49] play.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; The sermon, God's word, calls for a
[48:54] total separation from unbelief. He says
[48:56] as I preach to you Sunday the great
[48:58] symphony of God's word being beat out
[49:01] that's your tempo your rhythm he says
[49:05] and and he's saying that whatever the
[49:07] music beats for that hour beat with it
[49:10] &gt;&gt; the changes and junctions is only God
[49:12] changing times like the director in the
[49:15] symphony
[49:18] &gt;&gt; when we see these changes of ages and
[49:20] changes of times look down on the sheet
[49:23] here
[49:24] &gt;&gt; it's brother Brandham's language
[49:26] they call the changing of ages and the
[49:28] church ages as a musical composition.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; I'm just using the terminology of
[49:32] movement. So you can see that within an
[49:34] overall composition there's not a
[49:36] ripping of the needle off the record and
[49:38] let's change the band
[49:40] &gt;&gt; but it's a different movement. He says
[49:42] look down at the sheet here and you'll
[49:43] find out we're supposed to be here.
[49:46] Where are we supposed to be? Are we in
[49:48] chapter 2? Where are we at in chapter 3?
[49:53] We'll find out where we're supposed to
[49:54] be. We're supposed to be here. They've
[49:56] got to do this. There's no way for them
[49:59] to keep from it. Recognize how he's
[50:01] saying this is your part.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; This is what you have to play.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; And then zero in on this thought. He
[50:09] says, "And the music to a man that
[50:11] doesn't understand the symphony, what is
[50:13] it? It's a bunch of rattling noise."
[50:18] Think of this in two ways. To somebody
[50:21] who doesn't understand the symphony,
[50:23] what he hears is a bunch of rattling
[50:26] noise. But to the one who sees the sheep
[50:28] music and doesn't know how to play it,
[50:32] &gt;&gt; all he can produce is a bunch of noise.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; All he can produce is frenzy and
[50:37] fanaticism and emotionalism or
[50:39] intellectualism. That's all they can
[50:40] produce is noise
[50:42] &gt;&gt; and try to tell you, "Isn't that
[50:43] beautiful? Didn't that sound good?"
[50:44] Like, "Well, it's a bunch of shrilling.
[50:49] It's a bunch of rattling noise. He
[50:51] doesn't understand it. He's not even
[50:52] interested. He's wishing I'd wish they'd
[50:54] shut up so I could go home. He's not
[50:57] interested because he doesn't know the
[50:58] symphony.
[51:00] He doesn't know it.
[51:03] But the composer knows the end from the
[51:05] beginning.
[51:06] And if the director isn't in the same
[51:08] spirit of the composer, he cannot act it
[51:10] out because all of it's done by signs,
[51:14] indications, motions. And if the sign
[51:16] don't vindicate it, how's a musician's
[51:18] going to play it? There's your order.
[51:21] God's composition,
[51:23] the director.
[51:24] You have the composer, you have the
[51:26] director, the conductor, the one that's
[51:28] leading, the one that's directing, and
[51:30] then you have the ones who are playing,
[51:32] &gt;&gt; the ones that are performing God's great
[51:34] symphony. That's what these church ages
[51:37] express. That's what that's unfolding
[51:39] here in Revelations chapter 2 and
[51:41] chapter 3 is the sheet music
[51:45] where we can go back and we can see what
[51:47] Ephesus played, what Smyrna played,
[51:49] right? We can go back and hear what they
[51:52] played.
[51:53] Then there's what are we going to play?
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Are we going to choose one of their
[51:58] compositions?
[52:01] I
[52:01] &gt;&gt; I I was wrestled on how much to get into
[52:04] at this point and Lord willing just
[52:06] picking up Wednesday night on a few
[52:07] things on this thought. So I'll just use
[52:11] two things I know and I'll I'll try to
[52:12] summarize them very quickly because I I
[52:14] know that you're very familiar with
[52:15] these things. But the preview of the
[52:16] bride you're familiar with brother
[52:18] Brandham is giving that preview of the
[52:20] bride and in this churches are
[52:22] introduced and identified by music.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; The churches are but also for the bride.
[52:27] So there's a music, a soundtrack, a
[52:29] score, a certain feeling, a certain
[52:31] texture, a certain signature that
[52:33] relates to the churches, but then
[52:35] there's also one for the bride. And the
[52:37] masterpiece, Brother Brandham says the
[52:38] voice said, "Now we will review the
[52:41] churches." He says, "And they come and I
[52:43] noticed them coming up. And when they
[52:45] come up, each one looked like got worse.
[52:48] I never seen such a filthy bunch in my
[52:50] life. And when he said next, I heard a
[52:51] noise and it said next and said, here
[52:53] comes the American group." So with the
[52:56] churches, there's going to be a review
[52:58] of the churches. Brother Bam's already
[52:59] used this language that to each age
[53:02] there was a sheet music, not a separate
[53:04] piece so much as we could say a part
[53:06] within the composition. They had a part
[53:08] to play. The Ephesus group, you play
[53:10] your part. There's their movement. Then
[53:12] the the the Simrna group, you play your
[53:14] part. And it each unfolds each one. And
[53:17] he says that as they come up, he says he
[53:19] hears a noise. And the rapture, he says,
[53:22] "And as soon as it went out, every time
[53:24] one of them would come, they'd go out to
[53:26] a certain place, then drop off." And he
[53:28] says, "I would just hear the sound of it
[53:30] as it went away."
[53:32] So, as he sees it, there's a sound to
[53:35] it. There's a feeling. There's something
[53:37] being conveyed through all the imagery.
[53:39] And once it gets out of sight, he can
[53:41] still hear hear its music. And as soon
[53:44] as it went out, every time one of them
[53:46] would come, they'd go out to a certain
[53:48] place and then drop off. and I would
[53:49] just hear the sound of it as it went
[53:51] away.
[53:52] So in that it's like that you hear
[53:55] something coming
[53:58] and it goes away. So he hears something,
[54:00] it comes and then it goes away and he
[54:02] can hear it going away. And he says,
[54:03] "Then I heard something like onward
[54:05] Christian soldiers. There's your music
[54:09] that's gonna accompany those that are
[54:12] composed and directed and who are
[54:15] following the sheet music and they have
[54:17] a music that's sounding and what what
[54:20] does he describe is they went past as a
[54:23] as a director get back in line
[54:26] &gt;&gt; and there's ways that the compo composer
[54:28] just can move just a little bit to get
[54:30] everything on on beat
[54:33] &gt;&gt; get everybody back in their part in the
[54:36] sermon recogn recognizing your day in
[54:37] its message. He said, "Then he turned me
[54:38] to the right side and he showed me each
[54:41] church as they come up out of the ages."
[54:44] And oh, how vulgar. And the last one was
[54:46] this last day church which was led by a
[54:49] witch.
[54:52] And they were so immorally dressed, so
[54:54] filthy looking, and they were marching
[54:56] to the time of twist and rock and roll.
[55:01] and was he says it was marching to the
[55:03] or time or twisted and carrying on with
[55:05] that music walking up. So they were
[55:07] marching their time the music was
[55:10] causing him to twist carry on walking up
[55:13] and said that is the church.
[55:18] Brother Brandham
[55:20] in might have been in this sermon here.
[55:22] I'm just trying to remember where it
[55:23] was. He even says I I just realized it
[55:25] just now. The church that he saw in the
[55:27] preview, that church from America was
[55:28] naked
[55:30] in Revelations 3:17.
[55:33] He said, "That's the church. The last
[55:35] church is naked."
[55:38] Leodysa is marching to what? The wrong
[55:41] time,
[55:43] &gt;&gt; the wrong music. Why? It's blind.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; It can't read the sheet music.
[55:49] If there's a sin of this age, they're
[55:52] just trying to mimic the sound that went
[55:53] before him,
[55:54] &gt;&gt; right? Well, we can't read the music, so
[55:56] let's just try to do what they did. We
[55:59] don't fully understand it. Let's just
[56:00] try to make sense of it.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Then this principle, that's the
[56:04] principle of the preview of the bride.
[56:08] But then the countdown principle in the
[56:11] sermon, the countdown, brother's looking
[56:14] at from the standpoint of a countdown.
[56:16] 10, 9, 8. Well, that has to be
[56:20] there has to be timing to that, right?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Right. If it's like 10 9 8 6 5 4 33,
[56:31] &gt;&gt; right? There's got to be a So, you know,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; that's why even athletes at the track
[56:36] and field, they train them that whenever
[56:39] you hear the gun sound, flinch,
[56:42] &gt;&gt; go to a track meet, uh maybe a Mormon
[56:45] one, how they're maybe dressed a little
[56:47] bit better than the way they dress these
[56:48] days. I don't know if the Mormons do it
[56:49] right anymore either. I don't know. the
[56:51] Amish Olympics
[56:53] and there will be there you'll find guys
[56:56] just over on the side stretching and
[56:57] they'll be maybe the women's 100 meter
[56:59] hurdles over there and they'll just sit
[57:01] there talking to their coach and they're
[57:02] not even the gun gun sounds they go
[57:06] because they've been taught every time
[57:08] you hear the gun twitch because there's
[57:11] going to be a moment when you're at that
[57:12] starting thing and you want your brain
[57:15] trained
[57:16] &gt;&gt; to move to that
[57:18] &gt;&gt; the very moment it sounds move.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; And so in the countdown, there's a lot
[57:24] of uh things that Brother Bam's using
[57:26] and bringing out. And what's his theme?
[57:28] It's time for the bride to move from an
[57:31] airplane age, from Pentecost, from
[57:32] Pentecostalism,
[57:34] from gifts, from all that realm that
[57:37] which is God orained, God established,
[57:40] bonafide, legitimate, 100% God, and use
[57:44] the momentum of that
[57:46] to move into an astronaut age.
[57:50] which he said it's the same power but
[57:52] more power more power to be lifted
[57:53] higher and so this countdown it
[57:56] indicates a a change in the time a
[57:59] change in music as he uses that phrase
[58:01] so where are we
[58:04] suggest to you that we're Revelations
[58:06] 4:1
[58:08] after this I looked and behold a door
[58:09] was open in heaven the first voice which
[58:11] I heard was as it were of a trumpet
[58:13] talking with me which said come up
[58:14] hither and I will show you show thee
[58:17] things which must be hereafter.
[58:21] You have your church ages,
[58:24] but it's in that last church age that
[58:26] the bride is called to go up higher.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; There's a finale that comes.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; You have your church ages, but whether
[58:34] I'm say it's the capstone age.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; I'll get into this maybe, Lord willing,
[58:39] Wednesday night. Church ages are marked
[58:41] by a cycle of revival and death. Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; They all have a movement that ends
[58:47] definitively.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; But at the rising of the sun and once
[58:51] you come to this bride age or the
[58:53] capstone age, this is an age which
[58:55] prefigures the millennium and eternity.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; And so it's not subject to the death
[59:02] that struck every church age because
[59:04] this word cannot die.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; So you have come up higher and I'll show
[59:11] you things which must be hereafter. So
[59:13] listen, we're not trying to figure out
[59:15] where we are within the seven church
[59:17] ages. They've played their part. We're
[59:20] not holding 50-y old sheet music. We're
[59:22] looking at present day. This is what it
[59:25] is right now.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; He says in the sermon, influence, God is
[59:31] sending gifts to try to create in us a
[59:33] faith that'll move us out of here into a
[59:36] rapture. Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; And if I could say this, with the
[59:41] overlap of the the symphony, the Leodysa
[59:43] age, which brother said is Pentecost,
[59:46] it's stuck in that third dancelike
[59:49] movement.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; It's where they're stuck. They can't get
[59:54] out of that loop. But we must change.
[59:57] The prophet came to change us to that
[59:59] last lively finale, the last great step.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. which he said if we have four
[1:00:06] movements you had four death messengers
[1:00:09] and so there that that's that's the
[1:00:10] symphony of death but now you have the
[1:00:12] symphony of life
[1:00:14] and you have traditionally four
[1:00:16] movements justification sanctification
[1:00:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost and in there's
[1:00:20] the clapping of the hands the leaves
[1:00:22] that are shaking there's the outpouring
[1:00:23] of the gifts the restoration of the
[1:00:24] gifts and there brother Bam says and the
[1:00:27] next step is into that lively finale
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; right
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; the next step is the omega to the alpha.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; The next step is right into the Holy
[1:00:37] Ghost itself. And if we're if we have to
[1:00:39] follow the sheet music to that step.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Now, I I I could re respect somebody who
[1:00:47] says, "Brother Aaron, I believe we're
[1:00:48] right here solidly in the third
[1:00:50] movement. I believe we're right here
[1:00:51] solidly uh at the end of the second
[1:00:53] pull. this is where we rest and this is
[1:00:55] where we're going to stay because but
[1:00:57] one day we know according to the word of
[1:00:59] God there's going to be this that's
[1:01:01] going to come and you're looking for
[1:01:04] then keep looking keep listening keep
[1:01:07] praying keep reading keep studying stay
[1:01:10] you in it get in the spirit of the
[1:01:12] conductor get under the harmony of the
[1:01:13] word he'll lead you right where you need
[1:01:15] to be and be with the word of God
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; but to those who want to just pin it
[1:01:20] down and say no there's no such thing as
[1:01:21] this there's no such thing as
[1:01:23] What's the There's There ain't no such
[1:01:25] thing as divine healing.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; What's the present day for that?
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Because everybody believes in that.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, God don't do that. There's no such
[1:01:33] thing as this. There's no such What is
[1:01:34] it today? There's no such thing as a
[1:01:35] bride age. There's no such thing as a
[1:01:37] rapture cycle. There's no such thing as
[1:01:38] this. There's no such thing as the
[1:01:39] reveal of the son of man. There's no
[1:01:40] such thing. It's the same spirit that
[1:01:42] denied divine healing. It's the same
[1:01:44] spirit. Listen to how hypocritical it
[1:01:46] is. It's the same spirit that called
[1:01:48] everybody holy rollers. But now it's the
[1:01:50] holy rollers,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Let her name Colin.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Okay, I will read this. All right.
[1:02:10] Thank you.
[1:02:18] and the mighty God unveiled before us
[1:02:19] because I think this is really really
[1:02:21] pinned down where I where I'm drawing my
[1:02:23] inspiration to even use this type. But
[1:02:25] now what happens if the composer writes
[1:02:27] something and we find out that it isn't
[1:02:29] just acted outright?
[1:02:31] What would it sound like if we were all
[1:02:33] musicians and we had a dire? We had a
[1:02:36] composer who composed something and the
[1:02:37] composer is also the com the director
[1:02:40] and conductor and and he's given
[1:02:44] everybody the sheet music and we're all
[1:02:45] supposed to be taught and studied and
[1:02:46] trained and we're ready and we all show
[1:02:48] up and we play something different
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; and this happens over here and this
[1:02:53] happens over there and it's everything
[1:02:54] just they play something different. He
[1:02:56] says we find out then that there's
[1:02:58] something that happens. There's
[1:03:00] something lacking when we see them. He
[1:03:02] who composed it, has made it up and
[1:03:04] wrote it out, and then the symphony is
[1:03:07] playing it, hits a wrong note, there's
[1:03:09] something wrong,
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; man. I What is it? Uh, let me let me ask
[1:03:17] the local expert here. Um,
[1:03:21] Skill Rex, what is that kind of music
[1:03:22] around? There's this this music
[1:03:24] sometimes just it does it just sounds
[1:03:25] like it's it's accidental
[1:03:28] like I'm just going to take my keyboard
[1:03:29] and throw it on the couch and however it
[1:03:31] lays upside down
[1:03:34] like okay I like just put that in a loop
[1:03:38] and the baby walks through the room
[1:03:39] going and they're like oh I like that
[1:03:42] and they just they just make a bunch of
[1:03:43] no and what do they do? They convince us
[1:03:45] it's like it's got a nice hook to it.
[1:03:51] a but that and what do we've all fallen
[1:03:54] for it all of us right you all have your
[1:04:00] skill wrecks playlist on Spotify
[1:04:05] but this is and that's what it's a
[1:04:06] psychology then today in Christianity
[1:04:09] and spirituality where we just have this
[1:04:12] you know message mixtape and a message
[1:04:15] DJ over there they're just spinning one
[1:04:16] thing from this and dropping in that and
[1:04:18] slowing it down and just mixing
[1:04:19] everything up and Everybody's got to be
[1:04:21] drunk on some other influence to think
[1:04:23] this is really cool.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; And they all got their Pentecostal
[1:04:25] pacifiers in their mouth,
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; dancing all night long to something that
[1:04:30] isn't timely.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; That isn't according to the sheet music.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; He composed it. They made it up. Then
[1:04:36] the symphony's playing hits the wrong
[1:04:37] note. There's something wrong. The
[1:04:38] director gave the wrong motion. And
[1:04:40] that's what's the matter today. My
[1:04:41] Lutheran brethren, my Baptist brethren,
[1:04:43] my Pentecostal brethren,
[1:04:45] all my brethren from different
[1:04:46] denominations, that's what it is. You're
[1:04:48] trying to give a note that he hit back
[1:04:50] in the days of Luther. Wesley liked that
[1:04:52] when actually the music sheet here shows
[1:04:56] that it's another day.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; We cannot live in the light of Luther.
[1:05:01] He was a reformer. We appreciate his
[1:05:03] part. But we played that out.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Man, he even uses the music for it. The
[1:05:07] word you played that out. You play that
[1:05:08] too much. We call it spamming in our
[1:05:11] house. That's played out. We're way over
[1:05:14] here at the back of the book now. We
[1:05:16] can't play it out like that.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Now, the only way that you're ever going
[1:05:20] to be able to do it, my brethren, is
[1:05:21] this. And brethren of the world of the
[1:05:24] different parts of the world, I might
[1:05:25] say there's only one way for the
[1:05:26] director to do. And we could even see
[1:05:28] this maybe in a microcosm. He says the
[1:05:30] director, he's got to get in the same
[1:05:32] spirit that the composer was in. Then
[1:05:34] he's got it. I can see brother Brandham
[1:05:36] in that place. He's not the one that
[1:05:39] composed it. God's the composer. Brother
[1:05:43] Brandham here is a director to the age.
[1:05:45] He's got to be in the same spirit. And
[1:05:47] when the church, the symphony itself,
[1:05:49] where the world is watching for these
[1:05:51] signs and wonders, where the church and
[1:05:53] the composer and their director all get
[1:05:54] in the spirit of the composer.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful, isn't it?
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; That's what we've got to do. We got to
[1:06:04] get get ourselves. Now, some of you may
[1:06:07] leave today and feel that God's called
[1:06:09] you to be the composer of the age.
[1:06:12] and you'll be the 8,000th eighth
[1:06:15] messenger of this year. Hey,
[1:06:20] and you're just going to be another one
[1:06:21] who thought he was the composer. And
[1:06:22] some of you may say, you know what,
[1:06:23] bless God, I'm the director. And you're
[1:06:25] going to be the eighth director for the
[1:06:28] eighth millionth time.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; But let me just say, find your part.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Find your part.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Learn it.
[1:06:38] Practice it.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Play your part.
[1:06:42] In the sermon, the invisible union of
[1:06:43] the bride of Christ, brother Bam says,
[1:06:45] "Some of you people that really believe
[1:06:46] this to be the truth, we're we're that
[1:06:48] we're entering another age. We're
[1:06:50] entering the rapture age." The language
[1:06:51] he uses almost exclusively from this
[1:06:53] moment on is bride age. You know, the
[1:06:56] church can't go in its condition
[1:07:00] with that composition, right? These are
[1:07:01] my words with that sheep music. And it
[1:07:04] can't get better. It must get worse. How
[1:07:06] many knows that? It's got to get worse.
[1:07:09] And it can't go like this.
[1:07:11] It's got to be something.
[1:07:15] Remember when he preaches the seals.
[1:07:18] They've all played their part. There's
[1:07:19] been no real stirring. We need
[1:07:21] something. He says that'll move the
[1:07:23] bride out.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; He says it's got to be something. And
[1:07:27] it's moving right now, friends. It's on.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; It's on.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; The move is on for the bride. That's the
[1:07:37] truth. that is thus saith the Lord.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; If I could put it this way, there's no
[1:07:45] more movements.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be another
[1:07:47] movement.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; It's momentum
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; now.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; And and and we're not trying to put any
[1:07:54] other phrase to it, you know, but now
[1:07:57] the bride's move
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; is on
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; her turn.
[1:08:02] And those who played in other ages,
[1:08:04] whether it be Leo Deier or Philadelphia,
[1:08:06] Thire, all those, they played it well.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; They did their part.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; They they have run their course. But now
[1:08:13] you must sing. You must play. You must
[1:08:16] do your part. And we have thus sayith
[1:08:18] the Lord. Our move is on.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; That to me is the conductor. That's the
[1:08:22] director standing there before the
[1:08:24] orchestra saying, "Now it's your part."
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; And thank God he didn't leave us without
[1:08:30] the sheet music.
[1:08:33] Thank God we're not just running this
[1:08:34] blind. Said, "All right, well, I guess
[1:08:35] I'm just going to I just
[1:08:38] I'm just going to uh freestyle.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Give me a beat." Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah.
[1:08:42] Shane and Shane, that works. Got a Hill
[1:08:43] Song United in there. Perfect. That'll
[1:08:45] work for me. And just give me the beat
[1:08:47] and I'm going to freestyle now over that
[1:08:49] beat. And just whatever comes to mind if
[1:08:51] I can make it rhyme.
[1:08:54] That's not what we're doing, saints.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; It's already written for us.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Stay in it. I'll read I'll read a few
[1:09:00] more statements for the message on
[1:09:01] Wednesday night. How he just emphasizes
[1:09:04] that we've got to get this rhythm of
[1:09:05] this message. Be in the heartbeat of it.
[1:09:07] Lord willing, Wednesday night, we'll
[1:09:08] preach the bride's move. Let's stand.
[1:09:14] Don't hold me to the title. It may
[1:09:16] change.
[1:09:20] I I was thinking maybe titling it
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; the bride song,
[1:09:25] but then I thought maybe would think I
[1:09:27] misspelled bird.
[1:09:30] But there's ways that we can you look at
[1:09:32] this. This is your part. This is your
[1:09:34] time. God, help me to know the music
[1:09:37] we're in now. And play your part. You
[1:09:40] can only be honest to the your
[1:09:42] heartbeat. You can only be honest to how
[1:09:44] the Lord's leading you. So, play the
[1:09:45] part that he's given you to play. And I
[1:09:48] do believe that the way you play it, the
[1:09:52] way you perform it is going to indicate,
[1:09:54] and you'll know maybe better than
[1:09:56] anybody else, will indicate whether or
[1:09:57] not it truly is the spirit of the
[1:09:59] composer
[1:10:00] it working in you. And we're all at
[1:10:03] different intervals. We're all at
[1:10:04] different times maybe, but that's what
[1:10:05] the purpose of the preaching of the word
[1:10:06] is. That's what the purpose of all this
[1:10:08] time unfolding is so that we can all
[1:10:10] begin to blend as one voice. Our
[1:10:14] gracious heavenly father, today as we
[1:10:16] close our service, we ask your blessings
[1:10:18] upon the people as they're soon
[1:10:20] dismissed into this hot summer day. I
[1:10:23] pray that you be with them, that you
[1:10:26] would continue to
[1:10:29] comfort their hearts and speak words to
[1:10:31] them and their spirits that are
[1:10:33] encouraging, that are uplifting.
[1:10:37] Lord, I know that in our hearts we have
[1:10:41] great needs and pressures and battles
[1:10:43] that we experience on a number of
[1:10:45] different levels.
[1:10:46] Life can be so chaotic.
[1:10:50] Lord, even ourselves sometimes
[1:10:51] disappointed when our lives can get
[1:10:52] really flat or pitchy or we just don't
[1:10:54] seem to have any desire to sing.
[1:10:58] So Lord, I pray that we could just be
[1:11:00] get a little a little touch today.
[1:11:04] Come and feed us by this brookside.
[1:11:06] Lord, come and touch us under this
[1:11:08] juniper tree that we can have an
[1:11:12] ambition to play our instrument.
[1:11:15] And Lord, as any musician who wants to
[1:11:17] be proficient, who wants to play in a
[1:11:20] way that edifies and that is beautiful
[1:11:21] or skillful, they must put in the hours.
[1:11:23] They must put in the practice. Lord, may
[1:11:26] we likewise take a serious look at our
[1:11:28] time. Lord, it's one of the reasons why
[1:11:31] we ministered on the thought of
[1:11:33] wasteland in terms of the product, the
[1:11:35] work product that is produced. Lord, may
[1:11:36] we
[1:11:38] do things and enjoy things that
[1:11:40] cultivate spiritual character so that
[1:11:43] our lives could be in tune.
[1:11:46] May we take this type that brother
[1:11:48] Brandham taught us through a number of
[1:11:50] different sermons about the sheet music,
[1:11:52] the timing and the music and the
[1:11:54] composition and the changing of the
[1:11:57] movement or the page.
[1:11:59] May we take it, Lord, not to become
[1:12:01] fanatical about the types and lean into
[1:12:04] music more, but to learn and grasp the
[1:12:10] truth of it for our spiritual walks. I
[1:12:14] do believe that the bride who consumes
[1:12:16] your word, who reads it, who prays, who
[1:12:19] yields to it, submits to it, will be the
[1:12:21] expression of it. In the same way that
[1:12:24] we are given sheet music as musicians in
[1:12:27] a band or an orchestra, and we learn it,
[1:12:32] we practice it so that we could perform
[1:12:35] it
[1:12:36] even still with the aid of the sheet
[1:12:38] music and the director. Lord, that's
[1:12:40] what we're looking for in our own lives
[1:12:41] is to be the performance of this
[1:12:43] beautiful present day sheet music of the
[1:12:47] bride and Christ singing together as
[1:12:50] one. We commit the people to you today,
[1:12:53] Lord, praying that you bless those that
[1:12:54] are traveling. Bless those that will
[1:12:56] soon be leaving on trips, Lord. Even
[1:12:58] those leaving today or whatever
[1:13:00] pressures they have as they leave
[1:13:02] service, who may be even having to leave
[1:13:04] early, whatever it might be. We pray
[1:13:05] that you'd be merciful.
[1:13:07] We ask all these things in the Lord
[1:13:09] Jesus Christ. Amen.
