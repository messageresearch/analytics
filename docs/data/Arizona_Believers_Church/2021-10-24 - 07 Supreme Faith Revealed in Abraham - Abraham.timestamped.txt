[0:00] genesis chapter 12
[0:02] verses 1 to 9.
[0:04] genesis chapter 12 verses 1 to 9. my
[0:07] thought this morning is going to be very
[0:08] compact in the sense that we're wanting
[0:11] just to deliver
[0:13] a very
[0:14] a simple thought related to the life of
[0:16] abraham
[0:18] and continuing on the subject of supreme
[0:20] faith revealed in abraham and i just
[0:22] trust that the lord will
[0:25] bless you with this thought i had been
[0:26] wrestling all day yesterday
[0:29] and not feeling well
[0:30] and then also just really
[0:33] burdened in terms of what direction to
[0:34] take in the service
[0:36] and then elizabeth had just mentioned to
[0:38] me just how much the morales family was
[0:40] hurting
[0:41] and it was just in that moment it
[0:42] crystallized to me and i just felt this
[0:44] uh it just felt like the picture became
[0:46] completely clear
[0:48] and so i really feel that the lord has
[0:50] um
[0:51] given me a direct thought and a trust it
[0:53] would be a blessing to you genesis
[0:55] chapter 12 we're going to start with
[0:56] verse one read the verse nine we will be
[0:58] reading some of these verses again
[1:00] and we'll provide some backup
[1:03] and some context to this
[1:05] as we continue now the lord had said
[1:06] unto abram get thee out of thy country
[1:09] and from thy kindred and from thy
[1:11] father's house and to a land that i will
[1:13] show thee and i'll make of thee a great
[1:15] nation and i will bless thee and make
[1:17] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[1:19] blessing and i will bless them that
[1:21] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[1:23] thee and in thee shall all families of
[1:25] the earth be blessed so abram departed
[1:28] as the lord had spoken to him and lot
[1:30] went with them and abram was 70 and 5
[1:32] years old when he departed out of haren
[1:35] and abram took sarah his wife and lot
[1:37] his brother's son and all their
[1:38] substance that they had gathered
[1:40] and the souls that they had gotten in
[1:41] herein and they went forth to go into
[1:44] the land of canaan and into the land of
[1:46] canaan they came and abram passed
[1:48] through the land unto the place of
[1:50] shechem unto the plain amore and the
[1:52] canaanite was then in the land and the
[1:55] lord appeared unto abram and said unto
[1:57] thy seed will i give this land
[1:59] and there builded he an altar unto the
[2:01] lord who appeared unto him
[2:03] and i removed from fence into a mountain
[2:05] on the east of bethel and pitched his
[2:07] tent having bethel on the west and haiy
[2:09] on the east and there he builded an
[2:11] altar into the lord and called upon the
[2:13] name of the lord and abram journeyed
[2:16] going on still toward the south by just
[2:19] on
[2:20] on the move can you relate today
[2:22] even as a church
[2:23] even they just journeyed a little bit
[2:25] further south amen god bless you can be
[2:27] seated
[2:36] the
[2:38] subject is as i mentioned a moment ago
[2:40] supreme faith revealed in abraham
[2:43] and
[2:44] maybe finding a way just to succinctly
[2:46] um
[2:47] kind of capture what my thesis statement
[2:50] is with respect to this subject is that
[2:52] we're trying to
[2:53] we're looking at how his life makes
[2:55] perfect faith relatable and we talk
[2:58] about perfect faith and rapturing faith
[3:00] and the faith of god's elect and end
[3:01] time faith is a way that that faith can
[3:04] seem impossible out of reach or not
[3:06] practical um even some might feel that
[3:10] it's unattainable and that the the faith
[3:12] of this hour and what the word of god
[3:14] has been revealed to us they feel that
[3:16] they can only believe it not live it
[3:18] but really if you begin to look at the
[3:20] life of abraham you find that his uh his
[3:23] faith is more relatable than we might
[3:26] think it is we think of the father of
[3:27] our faith it's a is a very relatable
[3:29] faith
[3:31] and abraham's faith and even the outcome
[3:33] of that faith
[3:35] was a was a journey
[3:36] and it wasn't that in genesis chapter 12
[3:39] that god as they did as he bragged on
[3:41] job he's not necessarily bragging the
[3:43] same way on abraham because he's just
[3:45] saying hey get up away from thy country
[3:47] from my father's house and thy kindred
[3:50] and so abraham begins an adjourning and
[3:52] there was a process that began to work
[3:54] within abraham's life and it's through
[3:56] that process that abraham becomes the
[3:58] father of our faith he wasn't designated
[4:00] on day one look at this man of robust
[4:03] faith and perfect faith i'm going to
[4:04] choose him among all the unfaithful in
[4:07] the world he picked him
[4:09] by grace he was an ordinary man chosen
[4:11] by god
[4:12] and so we want to look at his faith in
[4:14] order to make it relate relatable to us
[4:17] and also give us courage
[4:18] and then i remind you that abraham's
[4:22] faith grew
[4:24] as he routinely trusted god it was it
[4:26] was something that god gave him a
[4:28] promise and when he trusted in that
[4:30] promise and he waited on god to fulfill
[4:31] that promise and so this is how his
[4:33] faith grew he grew through this routine
[4:35] of recognizing the promises of god
[4:37] submitting to the promise of god and
[4:39] watching god bring it to pass and so in
[4:41] that uh in that daily routine there was
[4:44] obedience to the call of god and there
[4:46] was worship
[4:47] and i wanted to take a few moments and
[4:49] this kind of maybe picks up some of the
[4:51] themes that we've been ministering onto
[4:52] the last few services
[4:54] as a reminder how that abraham's
[4:56] obedience to offer isaac as a sacrifice
[4:59] to god was not blind trust
[5:02] and there's a way that we kind of look
[5:03] at the faith of abraham and say well he
[5:05] just heard a voice he thought it was god
[5:06] he just believed it and he obeyed it and
[5:08] we kind of may we can make abraham's
[5:11] obedience on mount moriah just kind of
[5:13] like well whatever god says and going to
[5:15] do it and abraham's just kind of
[5:17] covering his eyes and bearing his head
[5:19] in the sand and just doing whatever god
[5:20] says
[5:21] and abraham was obedient specifically to
[5:24] what god asked him to do but by this
[5:26] time he's decades into walking with god
[5:29] and he's not just blindly following a
[5:31] god who told him to kill his only son
[5:33] but he has an understanding there's a
[5:35] revelation behind what he is doing
[5:37] and james captures it in james chapter 2
[5:39] verse 22 it says see us thou how faith
[5:42] wrought with his works and by works was
[5:45] faith made perfect
[5:47] and so by this offering of isaac and
[5:50] specifically
[5:51] in james chapter 2 i realize now i just
[5:53] kind of pulled the scripture out very
[5:54] quickly he's referring to how that his
[5:57] it's when he offered up his son upon the
[5:59] altar and that this was a justification
[6:02] of his faith and that his works
[6:04] demonstrated his faith had been made
[6:06] perfect it reached its full supreme
[6:09] expression when he willingly offered
[6:11] isaac upon the altar and so this was
[6:13] abraham's perfect faith he began in
[6:16] faith and as he walked with god it came
[6:18] to a perfect faith and it was not
[6:21] let me put it this way in order for his
[6:23] faith to be perfect it required an
[6:25] understanding of god
[6:27] in order for his faith to be perfect it
[6:29] required more than just him saying well
[6:31] oh that's what god said that i'm going
[6:33] to do it but it was through this this
[6:35] understanding of the nature of god the
[6:36] character of the nature of the promises
[6:38] to to abraham so we've identified in
[6:41] this scripture that abraham had been
[6:44] given a promise even as we see here i'm
[6:46] going to bless you and all the families
[6:48] in the earth are gonna be blessed
[6:49] through you that as he walked with god
[6:52] and the promise became more clear more
[6:53] crystallized i'm gonna give you a land
[6:55] i'm gonna be your god forever i'm gonna
[6:57] give you a son that he could come to a
[6:59] place where he could say hey
[7:01] god promised me many descendants through
[7:04] isaac then if i if i'm sacrificing isaac
[7:07] today the scripture tells us that he
[7:09] obeyed knowing that god was able to
[7:11] raise him from the dead
[7:12] and so his willingness to sacrifice
[7:14] isaac was based upon a revelation that
[7:17] had unfolded in his understanding that
[7:19] god has power over death and he
[7:21] quickened my body he quickened the womb
[7:24] of my wife he can quicken my son back to
[7:26] life if he doesn't spare his life so it
[7:28] was one with understanding his perfect
[7:31] faith
[7:32] was uh based upon an understanding of
[7:34] not just god said it and i believe it
[7:36] but
[7:37] an understanding of the nature and the
[7:39] character of god that spoke
[7:41] in hebrews chapter 11 verses 5 and 6 it
[7:44] says by faith enoch was translated that
[7:47] he should not see death and was not
[7:49] found because god had translated him for
[7:52] before his translation he had this
[7:55] testimony that he pleased god so enoch
[7:58] had a faith which translated him a walk
[8:01] with god that wasn't it wasn't uh one
[8:04] morning he was walking with god and it
[8:05] was the first time he ever walked with
[8:07] god and god said hey enoch get out of
[8:08] bed let's go on a walk but this was a
[8:10] daily life a life where he uh a daily
[8:13] routine of walking with god and so he
[8:16] had a life where it says he was uh he
[8:18] had this testimony that he pleased god
[8:20] he walked with god
[8:21] he had a testimony that he was close to
[8:23] god and so this is what was required for
[8:26] enoch's translation
[8:28] and then it says but without faith this
[8:30] is instructive to all of us hebrews 11 6
[8:33] but without faith it is impossible to
[8:35] please him
[8:37] and this to me amplifies the faith of
[8:39] enoch that enoch was walking with god
[8:41] and in his walk with god he began to
[8:43] understand the nature and character of
[8:45] god he could trust in him more and he
[8:46] began to know more about his desires and
[8:49] more about his will and more about his
[8:51] his certain attributes and
[8:52] characteristics because it says without
[8:54] faith it's impossible to please him so
[8:56] enoch had that faith he says for he that
[8:58] cometh to god must believe that he is so
[9:02] this is a belief in god and an
[9:04] understanding of his existence and his
[9:06] presence and that he is a rewarder of
[9:09] them that diligently seek him
[9:11] so it tells me that enoch's faith was
[9:13] not just believing in a deity or
[9:15] believing in a higher power or believing
[9:17] in one that was greater than him and
[9:19] looking at creation and saying wow this
[9:21] just couldn't be by accident but enoch's
[9:23] translating faith grew through a walk
[9:25] with god
[9:26] that he had a walk with god and in
[9:28] walking with god his faith grew and as
[9:30] he walked with him he began to
[9:31] understand more about the nature of god
[9:34] and he gained an understanding of god's
[9:36] character because we could say that
[9:37] enoch had translating faith and a faith
[9:40] that pleased god so he believed that he
[9:42] was but he also knew that he was a
[9:44] rewarder
[9:45] he knew something about the things that
[9:47] god wants to give he knew something
[9:48] about the character of god and what it
[9:50] responded to so there was more about
[9:52] just believing in a higher power it was
[9:54] something about his promises and his
[9:56] nature and his character and his
[9:58] trustworthiness
[10:00] it wouldn't be
[10:02] difficult maybe for some of us to look
[10:04] at a physical specimen and say wow
[10:06] you're stronger than me you could beat
[10:07] me up
[10:09] but then it's something else to be able
[10:11] to trust the nature and the character of
[10:12] that person to do what they say
[10:14] and so it wasn't just believing that god
[10:16] was a higher power and supernatural but
[10:18] it was understanding his character and
[10:20] what constrained him and what motivated
[10:22] him
[10:23] so this i'm wanting just to emphasize
[10:25] this part of there's a journey and a
[10:27] process when it comes to perfect faith
[10:30] and luke chapter 6 verse 40
[10:32] jesus is talking about the blind being
[10:34] leaders of the blind he says the
[10:35] disciple is not above his master
[10:38] and we realize that that uh if one is
[10:40] being discipled and one is being taught
[10:42] the student is not greater than the
[10:43] teacher but it says but everyone that is
[10:46] perfect shall be as his master
[10:49] and jesus is specifically identifying
[10:51] this process of learning
[10:53] a process of growing in a process of
[10:56] development wherein you have a student
[10:58] you have a disciple who has a teacher
[11:01] has a master who is disciplining them
[11:03] and teaching them and the student begins
[11:05] to learn to trust
[11:08] and as they they touch that decision the
[11:10] teachers they just trust the master
[11:12] they're learning to trust but then
[11:14] they're also learning from trusting
[11:17] so as you learn to trust and you trust
[11:19] in someone through that trust and that
[11:21] reliance you can learn from trusting
[11:25] and really if you think about it what
[11:26] you have to get you have to have
[11:28] confidence in the one that's teaching
[11:29] you and once you learn to trust them
[11:31] then you can learn from your trust and
[11:33] that's exactly what jesus is identifying
[11:35] as a process where you begin not knowing
[11:38] you begin unable you begin just simply
[11:40] learning to trust and relying on but
[11:42] he's demonstrating
[11:44] expressing this principle that the
[11:46] student though he may begin so far below
[11:49] his master through learning to trust and
[11:51] then learning by trusting and learning
[11:53] through this trust and through this
[11:55] relationship the the master's desire is
[11:58] to raise the disciple up to his level
[12:00] and this is exactly what jesus is
[12:02] identifying because he says look be ye
[12:04] therefore perfect even as your heavenly
[12:06] father which is in heaven is perfect now
[12:08] it's god's desire through discipleship
[12:11] and mentoring and teaching and the
[12:13] process of trusting that you could
[12:15] become like him
[12:18] so god does not desire to just always
[12:20] beat you down and make you feel
[12:22] uh completely broken and helpless that's
[12:25] that's that's human mechanisms that have
[12:27] capitalized on certain things in the
[12:29] word of god to always make you feel sick
[12:31] and broken and unable so that you can be
[12:34] manipulated and controlled
[12:36] but god wants to raise you up to a place
[12:38] of trust and confidence in him that you
[12:40] could be a perfect expression of his
[12:42] character and his attributes
[12:44] we we used this statement a number of
[12:47] times in this pro in these number of
[12:49] services we spoke on the subject but
[12:52] brother braham says in the sermon baum
[12:54] and gilead he says the one thing that we
[12:55] have to move up to now is a supreme
[12:58] faith to what we have had so he's saying
[13:00] you have a faith but there's a level
[13:02] there's a rapturing faith there's a
[13:03] growth in faith to a supreme faith he
[13:06] says you cannot have that faith until
[13:08] you know perfectly what you were doing
[13:10] abraham's willingness to offer isaac as
[13:13] a sacrifice was a supreme faith and he
[13:15] knew what he was doing not just blindly
[13:18] trusting he knew what he was doing then
[13:20] he uses this example you just say well
[13:22] i'm going home i'm going out i'm going
[13:24] to start the car that's all an act of
[13:26] faith
[13:27] he's he's mentioning these regular
[13:29] routine the daily habits as an act of
[13:31] faith tomorrow i'll meet you at a
[13:32] certain place that's all an act of faith
[13:35] because you've just done it so much
[13:37] because it's a regular routine with you
[13:39] well that's the way the things of god
[13:41] are
[13:42] after you have trusted him and watched
[13:44] him do so many things till it becomes
[13:47] just like a regular routine
[13:49] that doesn't mean that it's common
[13:50] doesn't mean that it loses its uh
[13:52] supernatural significance or this
[13:54] character of being divine but he's
[13:56] saying that you learn to trust him and
[13:58] entrust in him so frequently and
[14:00] watching him stand behind his word time
[14:03] and time again it just becomes a routine
[14:05] that if god said it i believe it's going
[14:06] to happen
[14:07] and then we're able to take a step back
[14:09] and say well he said he would do this
[14:11] and he did it and he did this for this
[14:12] person and he got me out of this
[14:13] situation and then you're able to kind
[14:15] of begin to put the puzzle together and
[14:17] say well why am i so worried about this
[14:19] if he did this for me did that for them
[14:21] if he's answered this prayer if he's
[14:22] brought me this far if he's arranged all
[14:25] these other things then why can't i
[14:27] believe for this part
[14:29] and so it's through this trust in him
[14:31] you watch him do so many things to where
[14:34] you just get in this routine inhabit and
[14:36] this instinct of trusting god and he
[14:38] said that's the way the rapture is going
[14:40] to be
[14:40] it's going to happen through the regular
[14:42] routine of following the scriptures and
[14:43] the plans of god that's exactly the way
[14:46] the rapture is going to take place now
[14:47] to the world it just looks like we're
[14:49] doing the regular thing to the world it
[14:51] just looks like we're doing common
[14:52] things but we have an understanding that
[14:54] rapturing faith is being developed and
[14:56] cultivated through the regular routine
[14:58] of following the scriptures and the
[15:00] plans of god for our life
[15:02] even if the routine doesn't seem it seem
[15:03] extravagant even if the plans of god
[15:05] don't seem to have that pizzazz and
[15:07] sizzle like maybe we think it should
[15:10] it's still bringing out of us rapturing
[15:12] faith
[15:18] now i want to
[15:19] just i'm going to kind of
[15:21] want to take a step back and begin to
[15:22] look at abraham's journey
[15:25] and and focus on some specific details
[15:27] but just to kind of weave a a story
[15:30] that's very direct in terms of his
[15:32] making his experience relatable
[15:34] because abraham's journey to perfect
[15:36] faith is a
[15:38] parallels the path that all of us take
[15:40] as children of god
[15:41] you are the royal seed of abraham we
[15:43] looked at a number of different
[15:44] statements where brother branham said
[15:46] that abraham's faith was an example to
[15:48] our faith that he had been determined to
[15:50] be an example for the people today
[15:52] and that for all of us who have faith in
[15:54] god you have the faith of abraham so we
[15:57] don't want to put him so far off to
[15:59] where he becomes an idol but he becomes
[16:01] one that is an example
[16:02] and that we can relate to him and so he
[16:04] is his faith his journey to perfect
[16:06] faith or supreme faith
[16:08] is a parallel example to us who are
[16:10] children of god
[16:12] and in romans chapter 4 verse 20 i'm
[16:13] going to start with the scripture that
[16:15] immediately makes us feel as if we can't
[16:17] relate to him at all but it says he
[16:19] staggered not at the promise of god
[16:21] through unbelief
[16:22] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[16:24] god
[16:25] now when we read that it's immediately
[16:27] begin to say oh well never never mind i
[16:30] can't be like abraham because we know
[16:31] we've staggered
[16:33] and we might even be able to testify
[16:35] that in our own experience in our own
[16:36] lives that we've staggered through
[16:38] unbelief
[16:39] that there was times when we didn't
[16:41] believe and we resisted and we ran away
[16:42] and there's some that uh can be very
[16:45] belligerent and adamant that this is
[16:46] false and this is an error this is no
[16:48] longer true but then god comes around
[16:50] and makes himself known and he moves
[16:52] upon the scene and hearts are changed
[16:54] and they look back and say well i
[16:55] haven't always been like abraham and i
[16:57] did stagger
[16:58] but it says he's staggered not at the
[17:00] promise of god so it's the promise of
[17:02] god that kind of becomes the point of
[17:04] his staggering but it says he didn't
[17:05] stagger through unbelief but was strong
[17:08] in faith giving glory to god
[17:10] there's a lot of ways that we could
[17:11] approach this but let me just put it
[17:13] this way as we read brother branham's
[17:14] statement last week where he said you
[17:16] could tell that man didn't write the
[17:17] bible
[17:18] because if abraham was in charge of
[17:19] writing the bible we wouldn't know about
[17:21] any of his mistakes he says would he
[17:22] talk about his cowardness would he write
[17:24] about all of his lies what's important
[17:26] in the writer now and the inspiration of
[17:29] god in romans 4 20 isn't writing about
[17:31] abram in his beginning in genesis 11.
[17:35] his reference point isn't genesis 11
[17:37] genesis 11 saying he staggered not at
[17:38] the promise of god the the what's
[17:41] written in romans 4 20 is the conclusion
[17:43] of the matter
[17:45] what's written in romans 4 20 is kind of
[17:46] like the final picture not the build up
[17:48] not the work not the process he's not
[17:51] showing us the work he's not showing us
[17:52] the dirty dishes he's not showing us all
[17:54] the
[17:55] the wood chips and the shavings and he's
[17:57] not showing the the progress he's
[17:58] showing you the finished work
[18:00] and i think that's one of the rules if
[18:02] you're posting a remodel project is you
[18:04] show the finished product first
[18:06] and then you show the progress i think
[18:08] isn't that one of the rules if you're
[18:09] going to post something you show the
[18:10] finished product first
[18:12] for all you bloggers instagramers and
[18:14] social media influencers you got just a
[18:16] little bit of help today if you if it's
[18:17] monetized show your love
[18:19] uh hit that subscribe button and
[18:21] whatever else you need to do
[18:23] but uh you you show the finished product
[18:25] that's exactly what's happening here
[18:26] when we read romans 4 20 abraham
[18:29] staggered not at the promise of god
[18:30] through unbelief was strong in faith
[18:32] giving glory to god
[18:33] because we know this isn't the whole
[18:35] story
[18:36] but it's the outcome
[18:38] it's the conclusion when you take
[18:40] abraham's life in total it's the
[18:41] conclusion when you look at his journey
[18:43] from what he began and where he ended up
[18:45] you say here's a man who ultimately came
[18:47] to a place where he could walk in a
[18:48] plain path with god
[18:50] this is his testimony in the end
[18:53] this is the testament how that faith
[18:55] began albeit small it prevailed
[18:57] ultimately in the end
[18:59] because when it says he's staggered not
[19:00] at the promise of god through unbelief
[19:02] it doesn't mean he was without weakness
[19:05] in james chapter 1 verse 12 it says
[19:07] blessed is the man that endureth
[19:09] temptation
[19:10] god said that he would bless abraham
[19:12] abraham was blessed blessed is the man
[19:13] that endureth temptation for when he is
[19:15] tried
[19:16] he shall receive the crown of life when
[19:19] he remains steadfast under trial when
[19:21] you persevere when tempted when you get
[19:23] back up after you fall he shall receive
[19:25] the crown of life which the lord hath
[19:27] promised to them that love him this
[19:29] scripture speaks beautifully of abraham
[19:31] because he remained steadfast under
[19:34] trial he was tempted he was tested he
[19:36] was tried he his testimony when you look
[19:38] at his life it it demonstrates a
[19:40] cowardness it demonstrates a line but
[19:42] yet he persevered through those
[19:44] situations
[19:45] he got back up when he fell down
[19:48] and this is wherein how we could relate
[19:50] to abraham because we all have imperfect
[19:52] records
[19:54] my loudest amen this morning i'll refer
[19:56] back to that if i need to wake you up we
[19:58] all have imperfect records
[20:00] right sister eliza as young as you are
[20:04] it's an imperfect record no matter how
[20:06] perfect we think she is as parents
[20:08] but there's a there's an imperfection in
[20:10] our lives we realize i've made mistakes
[20:12] i've wondered i've done things i
[20:13] shouldn't do we have moments of weakness
[20:15] even as born again christians
[20:17] we're driven to do things minor things
[20:19] that we don't want to do there's times
[20:21] when we know that our faith isn't
[20:23] followed
[20:25] that this is what i believe and this is
[20:26] what i'm convinced of but our actions
[20:28] don't necessarily line up with with what
[20:31] our profession is and what we say that
[20:33] we believe and we say well you know this
[20:35] is how i prove my love to him by
[20:36] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[20:38] trials that he and his wisdom comes
[20:41] allows to come to pass and you're on the
[20:42] phone sister brother branham said that
[20:44] we show our love to him by conducting
[20:46] ourselves with joy amidst the trials
[20:48] that he and his wisdom allow us to come
[20:50] to pass so put your shoulders back and
[20:51] your chin up god's with you he's going
[20:53] to bless you and you hang up the phone
[20:54] and what our plans got canceled
[20:59] we don't we don't always follow the same
[21:01] advice we give everyone else it's faith
[21:03] unfollowed it's moments of weaknesses
[21:05] there's misunderstandings
[21:08] we don't always understand the word of
[21:09] god perfectly
[21:11] there's things that we can profess and
[21:13] believe and there's many that could
[21:14] probably testify that there was things
[21:16] you were just convinced about in the
[21:17] message of the hour and this is the way
[21:18] that it is and i believe this and as you
[21:20] walked with god you come to find out
[21:22] well that wasn't exactly the entire
[21:23] truth part of it part of the process but
[21:26] god washes you and encourages you builds
[21:28] you up you realize that i have the
[21:30] record that wasn't always perfect i have
[21:31] faith that's not always followed i have
[21:33] times of struggle and doubtings and
[21:35] maybe disputings and
[21:37] battles in my mind and weaknesses and
[21:39] misunderstandings and though abraham in
[21:41] the end staggered not at the promise of
[21:43] god through unbelief he prevailed
[21:45] ultimately in the end and that can give
[21:47] us courage
[21:49] because his path was not without
[21:51] distress
[21:53] his path in life was not without
[21:55] disappointments
[21:57] i think this is where god kind of began
[21:59] to really deal with my heart is to try
[22:01] to relate to abraham in that abrahamic
[22:03] suffered extreme discouragement
[22:06] and he had these different crises
[22:08] there's several different instances in
[22:09] scripture
[22:11] where i think you could count uh several
[22:14] maybe up to 10 and that you can count
[22:16] where these are crises these are moments
[22:18] in his life where he's battling
[22:20] something he's facing something he's
[22:22] struggling with something and these are
[22:24] just the ones that are written of
[22:27] there's several chapters that cover his
[22:29] life
[22:30] and
[22:32] and many and really we can say the
[22:33] entire old testament from this point on
[22:36] uh covers his family's life
[22:38] but in just these several chapters it
[22:40] highlights these different instances
[22:42] over decades period of time and you have
[22:44] to realize not every instance not every
[22:46] crisis not every discouragement is
[22:48] mentioned but though there's certain
[22:50] ones that are recorded for our benefit
[22:53] in genesis chapter 12 just make mention
[22:55] of it quickly
[22:57] it tells us that famine drives him out
[22:59] of canaan into egypt
[23:02] and as we've mentioned recently based
[23:05] upon the promise that god had already
[23:06] given him he had reason to trust god
[23:09] and believe that famine could not
[23:10] interrupt the promises of god but famine
[23:13] drives him out of cain and it's
[23:14] different i believe with jacob later on
[23:16] he by instruction of god during a time
[23:18] of famine goes down in gerar but in this
[23:21] time it in not obeying explicit
[23:23] commandment famine drives abraham into
[23:26] into egypt and as they begin to enter in
[23:28] he's like hey honey
[23:30] i'm going to tell a half truth here
[23:31] you're just my sister not my wife
[23:34] because i'm afraid that if they like you
[23:36] they're going to kill me because i'm
[23:37] your husband
[23:39] and he lies about sarah because he's
[23:42] afraid of being killed
[23:44] and we looked into the scripture and
[23:46] realized wow you know that was obviously
[23:48] a lack of understanding on his part
[23:50] because he couldn't die
[23:52] right there's no way that he could have
[23:54] been left for dead permanently he god
[23:56] had made him a promise and he had fully
[23:58] understood i'm not saying he didn't
[24:00] believe the promise but he had yet to
[24:02] fully understand that this promise
[24:04] dictated that if they took his life and
[24:06] murdered him god would have to raise him
[24:08] right back up again
[24:10] and so that just is a an example of
[24:13] abraham striving in a moment of crisis
[24:15] of how will i provide for my wife and
[24:17] how will i provide for my house and and
[24:19] then being afraid of death and lying and
[24:21] fudging with the truth a little bit in
[24:22] genesis chapter 12.
[24:24] in genesis chapter 13 verses 7 and 8 it
[24:27] says and there was strife between the
[24:28] herdmen of abram's cattle and the
[24:30] herdman of lot's cattle and the
[24:32] canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then
[24:34] in the land so there's this conflict
[24:36] not only with the canaanite and the
[24:38] perizzite where they had to be worried
[24:39] about these fierce tribesmen and they
[24:41] had to be worried about competition for
[24:43] water and in plains and they had to kind
[24:45] of carve out their territory but now
[24:47] it's right within his own family
[24:50] strife with the with the nephew and it
[24:51] says there's strife between the herdmen
[24:53] of abram's cattle and the herdman of
[24:55] lot's counter then abram says the lot
[24:57] let there be no strife i pray thee
[24:59] between me and thee
[25:00] so the conflict of the herdman the
[25:02] conflict of the extended family members
[25:04] this this began to create family drama
[25:06] within with abraham's life he says let
[25:08] there not be strife between me and then
[25:10] between the heard men and thy heard men
[25:12] for we
[25:13] brethren
[25:15] it's okay if we read into this a little
[25:16] bit
[25:18] or at least come to the apparent
[25:19] conclusion that abraham is having
[25:21] difficulty within his family and maybe
[25:23] there's a struggle over resources and
[25:25] who has a right to this and who has a
[25:27] right to that and who got there first
[25:28] and who gets the best water and who gets
[25:30] this and who gets and whose cattle is
[25:32] that and this was maybe a common thing
[25:34] that may not be related to herds herding
[25:36] sheep or cattle
[25:38] anybody having family problems over
[25:40] livestock we can we can draw from this
[25:43] example here in genesis 13. but there's
[25:45] uh but we have differences and we have
[25:47] disagreements and this is something that
[25:49] happens with abram's life and that
[25:51] should make him relatable
[25:53] abram had to deal with family drama
[25:56] and in genesis chapter 14 verse 12 this
[25:59] very one whom he had to separate from
[26:01] and divide himself from it says he is
[26:03] attacked or there's a siege upon these
[26:05] different cities and sodom gomorrah and
[26:07] lot who had chosen to dwell in these
[26:09] watered planes of sodom gomorrah he's
[26:11] made
[26:12] made captive or held captive kidnapped
[26:14] by these kings it says they took lot
[26:16] abram's brother's son who dwelt in sodom
[26:19] and his goods and departed and what does
[26:21] abram do in response he goes out to
[26:22] rescue his nephew the one he was just
[26:25] fighting with in the chapter before he's
[26:26] now no he's a he's a nephew in need he's
[26:29] a he calls him his brother he's a
[26:30] brother in need i've got to go out i've
[26:32] got to rescue him and he takes his his
[26:34] trained servants and he goes and does
[26:35] battle with these different kings to
[26:37] rescue uh to rescue his nephew lot and
[26:40] we read it like abraham is like oh
[26:42] awesome this is a fight i've got these
[26:44] trained servants we all got our uh we
[26:46] have all got our weapons of warfare
[26:47] let's all just go and hunt these kings
[26:49] down like they were hired mercenaries
[26:50] and this is something they did in their
[26:52] spare time but this would have been a
[26:53] crisis
[26:55] this would have been something where
[26:56] he's like what do i do and i don't have
[26:57] armies and these are five different
[26:58] kings and look what they've done to
[27:00] these cities but there had to be a
[27:01] decision made in the moment of crisis
[27:04] and he follows his faith and he follows
[27:06] his love for his lost loved one to go
[27:08] out and to rescue him from this
[27:10] captivity
[27:12] just a few instances of distress and uh
[27:15] stressors and conflict in abraham's life
[27:19] we come to genesis chapter 20 many years
[27:21] later
[27:22] many different appearances of god to him
[27:24] and the promise unfold and becoming more
[27:26] plain you think oh this is where
[27:28] abraham's faith he will not stagger this
[27:30] is when abraham will have a perfect
[27:31] record and a perfect testimony but he
[27:33] goes down into gur and he's there with
[27:35] abimelech and abimelech thinks his wife
[27:37] is beautiful and he wants to take her to
[27:39] to be one of his own and what does he
[27:40] lie do he lies again
[27:44] he lies again about sarah being his
[27:46] uh sister and what did he what did he
[27:48] say to the abimelech well i mean she is
[27:51] my sister but not of my mother but of my
[27:53] father so we are brother and sister but
[27:55] we just don't share the same mother but
[27:56] she's also my wife
[27:58] right
[28:00] and he tells us kind of half truth to
[28:02] kind of justify himself but he makes
[28:04] this statement in verse 11 and genesis
[28:06] 20 and abraham said because i thought
[28:08] surely the fear of god is not in this
[28:10] place
[28:12] when you read it you find there was a
[28:13] little bit of a misunderstanding because
[28:15] i think it's in the next chapter uh or
[28:18] maybe it's at the end of genesis chapter
[28:19] 22 where the abimelech is like look i
[28:22] know that you fear god the blessings of
[28:24] god are upon you and and forms a treaty
[28:26] with abraham and he's making the name of
[28:28] abraham great so he might have misjudged
[28:30] the character of abimelech and the
[28:32] people he says they don't fear god and
[28:34] they will slay me for my wife's sake
[28:37] we're not talking about abram in genesis
[28:38] 11. we're talking about abraham in
[28:40] genesis 20.
[28:42] this is abraham who had a lord appeared
[28:44] to him in a dream and division in
[28:46] genesis 15 the lord who confirmed the
[28:48] promise and changed his name in chapter
[28:50] 17 the lord who appeared to him in
[28:52] genesis 18 the the one who was in the
[28:54] form of melchizedek in genesis 14. these
[28:56] are many many years later he'd been in
[28:58] the message for a real long time
[29:01] he had been following the word of god
[29:03] for a really really long time and he's
[29:05] still prone to some of the same mistakes
[29:06] and he's still subject to the same fear
[29:09] of death and willing to tell the same
[29:11] lie that he told in genesis 12 and it
[29:13] still has not come to that full deep
[29:16] understanding abraham you have no reason
[29:19] to fear your own demise nor your wives
[29:23] and that would have been a time of
[29:24] distress and conflict he's a fearful of
[29:26] his life and he's making decisions based
[29:28] upon fear and not fully upon the promise
[29:30] and there's no doubt that that would
[29:32] have led to a discouragement for abraham
[29:35] he might have been discouraged that he
[29:36] had to separate from lot and didn't
[29:38] quite understand why it couldn't work
[29:39] out or
[29:41] just trying to identify briefly
[29:43] different times of distress or
[29:45] discouragement or disappointment in the
[29:46] life of abraham
[29:48] does it give you courage
[29:50] to think that abraham had many different
[29:52] crises and conflicts
[29:54] and it says in second corinthians
[29:56] chapter four verses eight to nine
[29:59] and i had spent all week on a beautiful
[30:01] slide show you should have seen it
[30:09] it says second corinthians chapter four
[30:11] verses eight to nine if you could turn
[30:13] in your bibles to look at this
[30:15] or open your app
[30:18] hey siri open the bible to second
[30:19] corinthians chapter four verses 8 and 9.
[30:23] it says we are troubled on every side
[30:26] yet not distressed
[30:28] we are perplexed but not in despair
[30:31] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[30:34] but not destroyed
[30:37] it's very familiar scripture to us we've
[30:38] heard it ministered on in very deep ways
[30:40] and relevant profound ways and
[30:42] very gifted men of god have used this to
[30:45] encourage and strengthen our faith so
[30:47] i'm just stirring up your pure minds by
[30:48] way of remembrance to look back at this
[30:50] scripture
[30:51] where we stand today
[30:53] and realize that what paul is saying
[30:55] this he's not qualifying it he's not
[30:58] saying to some
[31:00] they they're perplexed and to others
[31:02] they're this and to others they're that
[31:05] he's saying we are
[31:08] and as we often put ourselves in the in
[31:09] the the shoes of the writer and we
[31:11] gather that he's not merely making a
[31:13] statement of how that we are on our way
[31:15] uh to rome or we are on our way
[31:17] to cyprus but he's saying that this is a
[31:19] characterization of us as christians we
[31:22] are troubled we are perplexed we are
[31:25] persecuted we are cast down in other
[31:27] words god allows trouble
[31:30] god allows perplexing god allows
[31:32] persecution and casting down
[31:35] and that there is no reproach in these
[31:37] things
[31:39] that when we find ourselves cast down or
[31:41] troubled it says troubled on every side
[31:43] and we find ourselves uh persecuted
[31:46] there is a there is a a way that there's
[31:49] a stigma that would try to be attached
[31:50] to us and a scarlet letter that we would
[31:52] wear when we're troubled or persecuted
[31:55] uh or perplexed or cast down but listen
[31:59] when paul writes it this way he's taken
[32:02] away and removing any stigma or reproach
[32:05] associated when a child of god is
[32:07] troubled
[32:09] he said well i'm troubled on my right
[32:10] side well i'm troubled on every
[32:12] side and there's still no reproach in it
[32:16] now i want you to look at this
[32:19] and i know that you've done this before
[32:20] but i want to remind you that when we
[32:22] look at this and he says we are troubled
[32:24] we are perplexed we are persecuted we
[32:27] are cast down
[32:28] there's this this is what god allows
[32:32] now i want you to look at this this the
[32:34] next part to it when he says yet not but
[32:36] not but not but not
[32:38] that that's satan's desire
[32:41] one is what god allows
[32:43] the other side is what satan desires he
[32:46] desires the distress the despair the
[32:48] feeling forsaken
[32:50] the believing that we are destroyed
[32:53] out so then catch this satan's objective
[32:56] is not to trouble you on every side
[32:58] that's what god allows
[33:00] satan's objective is to not it is not to
[33:03] perplex you that's what god allows
[33:05] satan's objective is not to persecute
[33:07] you that's what god allows his objective
[33:09] is not to cast you down that's what god
[33:11] allows but what satan would want to do
[33:13] is to take those things that god has
[33:15] allowed and to manipulate them in such a
[33:17] way and make them so large in your mind
[33:19] and cause you to forget the promise
[33:22] and to forget your faith in the promise
[33:25] of god it's not that abraham all of a
[33:27] sudden stop believing but in the moment
[33:29] he forgot about the promise in the
[33:31] crisis and the gravity of the situation
[33:33] that he's facing if he could have taken
[33:35] a step back and said now god's allowed
[33:37] me to be troubled god's allowed this
[33:38] famine god's allowed this circumstance
[33:40] god's allowed me to be persecuted and
[33:42] then said that which god has allowed i
[33:44] can accept but what is satan trying to
[33:46] do in this moment
[33:49] trying to cast my faith down he's trying
[33:50] to cause me not just merely to feel this
[33:53] way but to think that i am destroyed
[33:57] so satan's desire is to cause distress
[34:00] despair feeling forsaken believing that
[34:03] we are destroyed
[34:04] but the word of god says we are not
[34:09] right we can accept it the bible says
[34:12] i'm troubled the bible says and i'm
[34:13] perplexed the bible says i'm persecuted
[34:15] the bible says i'm cast down but notice
[34:17] how definitively
[34:19] paul expresses what we are he expresses
[34:22] in the same to the same intensity and
[34:24] emphasis what we are not
[34:28] and so no matter how much you may feel
[34:30] that you are forsaken or destroyed
[34:32] or despair or perplexed i want you to
[34:35] understand or not perfect despaired or
[34:38] forsaken or distressed or destroyed no
[34:40] matter how much you may feel we could
[34:42] say that we are not
[34:44] because paul says we are this but we are
[34:46] not that we are not distressed we are
[34:48] not disparity we are not forsaken we are
[34:50] not destroyed
[34:52] and in everything that abraham went
[34:54] through his life was full of trouble
[34:57] his life was full of situations that
[34:59] would seem to be distressing
[35:01] but in the end he was not deterred
[35:04] and we have to begin to relate to the
[35:06] faith of abraham that through everything
[35:08] he endured and went through in the in
[35:10] the journey and the path that he took
[35:12] that in the end hit the faith that he
[35:14] had was going to see him through
[35:17] he was going to move beyond it mature
[35:19] beyond it we're going to identify
[35:21] ourselves with it
[35:23] and the message three kinds of believers
[35:25] he says you have got something to do
[35:28] god's got something for you to do
[35:32] could we all accept that today
[35:34] every single one of us who are here no
[35:35] matter how long you've been serving the
[35:37] lord and no matter if it seems things
[35:38] have passed you by
[35:40] and opportunities or long gone or i had
[35:42] my i had my time in the in the service i
[35:45] had my time in the front line listen god
[35:47] still has something for you to do
[35:50] he says you may now if we could
[35:52] establish that that god has a purpose in
[35:54] your life then he says you may have some
[35:56] heartaches and some troubles you may
[35:59] have some disappointments
[36:02] and and and we can all say amen to that
[36:04] continued disappointments continued
[36:06] heartaches and things that resurface
[36:08] after many years in situations we find
[36:10] ourselves in like i'm back at this door
[36:12] again i'm in this trouble again yes
[36:14] these things take place he says but do
[36:16] we pray to shun them
[36:18] and we're all like yes
[36:20] yes
[36:22] yes we do that's exactly what we do
[36:25] and he says no
[36:26] i'm like oh right that's what i meant i
[36:28] misunderstood the question
[36:30] we we pray lord get me out of this keep
[36:33] me from it oh lord i don't want to have
[36:34] to go through this he says no this is
[36:36] the prayer lord take me through them
[36:40] whatever they is
[36:42] whatever it is
[36:43] don't let me escape them if they're set
[36:46] for me just give me grace to go through
[36:48] that that's all
[36:50] what a different approach
[36:51] because you realize that if god has set
[36:53] a a trial for you or god is going to
[36:56] allow you to be troubled gonna allow
[36:58] perplexing can allow persecution allow
[37:00] you to be cast down and this is what god
[37:02] is going to allow in his wisdom and as
[37:04] you come to it you see that it's coming
[37:06] and we begin to pray keep us from it and
[37:08] the devils are going yeah yeah ask him
[37:09] to keep you out of him
[37:11] because that's where he wants the
[37:12] distress to come
[37:14] that's where he wants the despair to
[37:16] come that's where he wants the i'm being
[37:17] forsaken god's thrusting in this trial
[37:19] this is where he wants us to believe
[37:21] that we're going to be destroyed by the
[37:22] thing that is coming
[37:25] but then when we put our shoulders back
[37:26] and say lord take me through it whatever
[37:27] it is
[37:29] if they're set for me give me the grace
[37:31] to go through that
[37:33] and this is this is the disposition of
[37:35] abraham ultimately lord whatever trial
[37:37] it is you've set before me give me the
[37:39] grace to go through it whatever
[37:40] mountaintop i have to ascend to whatever
[37:43] difficulty i'm faced with lord give me
[37:45] the grace to go through it
[37:50] now
[37:52] maybe i
[37:53] uh
[37:54] wrestled with the order of this and just
[37:55] exactly which order to take these
[37:57] different things but
[37:58] i felt to take this part which might
[38:00] seem to be oh you're taking a step back
[38:01] and that was kind of
[38:03] uh that was your your climax there if
[38:06] that was my climax that was part one i'm
[38:07] gonna start part two this is the evening
[38:09] service beginning now at 11 10 sunday
[38:11] morning
[38:12] so we can build to another climax
[38:13] brother branham teaches about two
[38:15] climaxes so this wouldn't be difficult
[38:16] for us to do this this morning
[38:19] but i wanted to establish
[38:20] that the principle
[38:23] that if you could trust god and his love
[38:25] towards you and you can have this
[38:26] comfort he's got something for you to do
[38:28] that will change change the way in which
[38:30] we approach difficulty in hard times and
[38:33] situations that are very grievous or
[38:35] sorrow even as we think of the moralist
[38:37] family something that's unexplainable
[38:39] how do we explain this how do we make
[38:40] sense of this that there's a trust in
[38:42] god that lord give me a grace to get
[38:44] through this may there be a grace on
[38:46] sister melissa may there be a grace on
[38:47] the mother of james and may there be a
[38:48] grace
[38:50] in the church and in the family to be
[38:51] able to navigate through this
[38:54] have the right things to say
[38:56] the right way to minister
[39:00] and and so with that as a
[39:03] kind of within the focal point of
[39:05] abraham's faith and his conviction and
[39:07] how he suffered these different
[39:08] situations in his life but in the end we
[39:10] find him on mount moriah willing to
[39:12] offer up his son because he fully trusts
[39:14] the lord he's fully persuaded now
[39:18] but when we think of that as it says in
[39:19] romans chapter 4 verse 21 and being
[39:21] fully persuaded it says that he
[39:23] staggered not at the promise of god
[39:24] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[39:27] giving glory to god and being fully
[39:29] persuaded that what god had promised he
[39:30] is able to perform
[39:32] being fully persuaded that what he god
[39:34] had promised god was able also to
[39:37] perform being fully persuaded that what
[39:38] god had promised to him abraham also was
[39:41] able to bring the past the promise that
[39:43] was given to him
[39:46] but even though the bible memorializes
[39:48] abraham's faith in that manner being
[39:49] fully persuaded abraham didn't always
[39:51] know the full plan of god
[39:54] in order to completely trust him
[39:56] he didn't know the full plan of god in
[39:58] order to completely incorrectly trust
[40:01] the plan of god
[40:02] because being fully persuaded does not
[40:04] imply full perfect understanding
[40:07] it says he's fully persuaded so in other
[40:09] words god can say i promise to do this
[40:11] and he's fully persuaded that god's
[40:13] going to do it but he doesn't yet
[40:14] understand perfectly how god's going to
[40:17] do it so it becomes somewhat of a
[40:19] wrestling within himself i'm fully
[40:20] persuaded god that you're going to do it
[40:22] but i don't know exactly how you're
[40:24] going to do it so he's always trying to
[40:25] figure out how
[40:27] maybe abraham knew that he was going to
[40:30] have an heir but the tension is created
[40:32] around who is the air going to be
[40:35] because it says in genesis chapter 15
[40:37] verses 2 and 3
[40:39] after the lord appears to him in a
[40:40] vision after these things after
[40:41] melchizedek serves in communion genesis
[40:44] 15 the lord appears to him in a vision
[40:46] fear not i am thy exceeding great reward
[40:48] thy shield i buckle exceed my your
[40:50] protector your cover your provider and
[40:52] abraham's response is lord god what will
[40:55] thou give me
[40:57] see and i go childless
[41:00] in other words it kind of seems to be
[41:02] somewhat of a disputing
[41:04] a a remark back to god don't be afraid
[41:07] abraham well what what can you do for me
[41:08] saying that i don't have a kid
[41:11] what good is all these things you can
[41:12] give me and all these blessings you can
[41:14] pour out upon me if i don't have an heir
[41:16] and he says and the steward of my house
[41:18] is this eliezer of damascus because he
[41:21] had traveled there into syria and was in
[41:23] that that area in that region and had uh
[41:25] obtained the servant in his house
[41:27] eliezer
[41:28] and abram said behold to me
[41:32] thou hast given no seed
[41:36] so this is him he's being very upfront
[41:38] and honest look you've made this promise
[41:40] to me and in making this promise to me
[41:42] you've told me that i would have these
[41:43] this particular
[41:45] uh things that would be granted to me
[41:46] and i would have these promises that are
[41:48] mine he says but i don't have a child
[41:51] but i have one in my house
[41:54] is eliza damascus and lo one born in my
[41:57] house is mine heir
[41:59] you notice what he's just told god
[42:02] i don't have a son
[42:04] but eliezer does
[42:06] and being born in my house he is my
[42:08] possession he's one of my servants and
[42:10] he's part of my household and he would
[42:11] be one that would be identified with my
[42:13] stewardship and he's saying what about
[42:16] his son
[42:18] this is abraham in genesis chapter 15
[42:21] fully persuaded that he was going to
[42:22] have an heir but there's tension around
[42:24] who the air is going to be
[42:26] and he's offering up the son of one of
[42:27] the stewards now we read this month oh
[42:29] no no abraham you don't understand no no
[42:31] no you don't understand it's going to be
[42:32] your son
[42:33] but this hasn't been fully developed in
[42:35] abraham's understanding yet then in
[42:37] genesis 16 verse 2 and sarah said unto
[42:40] abram behold now the lord hath
[42:42] restrained me from bearing i pray thee
[42:44] go in unto my maid it may be that i may
[42:48] obtain child children by her
[42:52] so now sarah saying i can't have a kid
[42:56] and to that point
[42:57] there are some commentators that
[42:58] speculate that maybe she was trying to
[42:59] test abram so that the blame could be on
[43:02] him too
[43:04] and and i don't i can't but maybe i can
[43:06] obtain children by my own servant so now
[43:08] it's not just the son of eleazar but
[43:11] it's going to be the son of abraham but
[43:12] it's going to be through a servant of
[43:14] sarah's and it says abram hearken to the
[43:16] voice of sarah
[43:18] in other words he'll obey to her
[43:20] because he doesn't fully understand that
[43:23] the promise is through sarah alone
[43:26] so he says that's i hadn't thought about
[43:28] that why don't we do obtain children
[43:31] through your servant and sarah kind of
[43:33] gives it her stamp of approval and then
[43:35] we've read the story immediately it
[43:36] doesn't work out well for abraham
[43:38] right it causes this distress apparently
[43:40] now it's confirmed that abraham can
[43:42] bring four children she shoulders the
[43:44] blame uh on herself and there's this
[43:46] conflict and this torment within her
[43:48] spirit and it causes strife within the
[43:50] family again strife within the marriage
[43:51] abraham's having to deal with this why
[43:53] because he hearkened to the voice of his
[43:55] wife unsure of who the heir would be
[43:58] but yet still fully persuaded
[44:02] now we're not arguing with the scripture
[44:05] when it says he's staggered not at the
[44:06] promise through unbelief
[44:08] but in some ways he's trying to find
[44:10] just exactly where that solid footing is
[44:13] in genesis 15 could it be eliezer's son
[44:15] now in genesis 16 could it be the son of
[44:18] hagar
[44:19] then we get into genesis chapter 17 this
[44:21] to me verses 15 to 18. it is so
[44:23] remarkable
[44:25] this exchange
[44:27] and god said unto abraham
[44:29] god's speaking now
[44:31] okay in my notes i actually took what
[44:34] god says here and put it in red letter
[44:36] as for sarah thy wife
[44:38] thou shalt not call her name sarai but
[44:41] sarah shall be her name
[44:43] and i will bless her
[44:47] and give thee a son also of her
[44:51] yea i will bless her and she shall be a
[44:53] mother of nations kings of people shall
[44:56] be of her
[44:57] now now in doing this god has taken what
[45:00] he expressed to abraham and he's
[45:02] unfolded the same if we could put it
[45:04] this way there's this promise
[45:07] given to abraham
[45:10] and and let's just say maybe a promise
[45:11] given this is the promise to abraham god
[45:14] doesn't change the promise he opens it
[45:16] up more deeply it says when i gave you
[45:18] the promise
[45:19] that you were going to have a son
[45:21] when i first spoke it that son was going
[45:24] to be through sarah when i said you were
[45:26] going to be a blessing and be a father
[45:27] of nations i was saying sarah would be a
[45:30] mother of nations when i said kings
[45:31] would come from you i was saying they
[45:33] were going to come from sarah so he's
[45:34] just turned the same promise around to
[45:37] where abraham's not changing his faith
[45:39] he's not saying oh well that's not the
[45:41] promise you made to me before god is
[45:43] unfolding that promise remember he said
[45:46] leave thy father's house and thy kindred
[45:48] in thy country just get out i'll show
[45:51] you the land later and then he journeyed
[45:52] into the land and god said this is the
[45:54] land i was talking about god wasn't
[45:56] saying i got to figure out a place to
[45:57] place abraham just wherever he goes
[45:58] wherever he ends up and we'll have to
[46:00] figure it out send angels out to find
[46:01] where he's going get ahead of him figure
[46:03] out where he's going
[46:04] oh god knew all along and then when he
[46:06] got to a particular place he says now i
[46:08] can show you
[46:09] now i can show you the promise so that
[46:11] in his journey this was very critical
[46:13] when we looked at this before so that
[46:15] when he got there it's faith that got
[46:17] him there
[46:19] and not the postcard or the pictures
[46:21] before
[46:22] abram didn't show up because there was
[46:24] this really really good photographer in
[46:26] kanan who used forced perspective and
[46:28] just the right kind of light and had all
[46:29] the best filters but yeah that's i want
[46:31] to go there who doesn't want to live in
[46:32] canaan
[46:33] it's gorgeous out there
[46:34] they've got these these cave walls with
[46:36] these nice angel wings that you can
[46:38] stand in front of and and do the duck
[46:40] face and post it and get a lot of
[46:41] followers there was nothing visual about
[46:43] it was all faith
[46:46] there was no there was no drama there
[46:48] was no filter there was nothing that
[46:50] drew it was all faith and god withheld
[46:52] it so when abraham arrived it's faith
[46:54] that got me here but then the revelation
[46:56] begins to dawn and the details begin to
[46:58] get filled in and then it begin to
[47:00] anchor in him the promises of god so now
[47:02] god has opened up the promise further to
[47:04] abraham listen you're going to be a
[47:06] father of many nations you've proven
[47:08] that you had some persuasion of that
[47:10] because you offered up your elie's your
[47:12] son as one in your own house and you've
[47:14] offered up the sun you've had the sun by
[47:16] your servant and he's trying to show him
[47:18] more specifically and plainly who this
[47:21] heir was going to be and you all know
[47:24] what he says next right
[47:27] verse 17 then abraham fell upon his face
[47:31] and laughed
[47:32] and said in his heart anybody want to
[47:34] guess what he said
[47:36] shall a child be born unto him that is a
[47:38] hundred years old
[47:40] we know sarah gets all the
[47:42] the the flack for laughing in genesis
[47:45] 18.
[47:47] she's just doing what her husband said
[47:49] i think his brother uh
[47:51] brother jewel foreigner brother burley
[47:53] williams was talking about in marital
[47:54] strife and
[47:55] and your wife and her demeanor and her
[47:57] nature and he basically said behold your
[47:58] creation
[48:00] to us husbands right
[48:02] we've made her this way
[48:04] whatever we sow into her we get that out
[48:06] of her
[48:07] right
[48:08] and so here abraham we we give sarah a
[48:11] lot of grief in genesis chapter 18
[48:14] uh uh for laughing abraham did it first
[48:17] in the face of god shall a child be born
[48:20] unto him that is a hundred years old and
[48:22] shall sarah that is 90 years old bear
[48:25] and he says based upon this and didn't
[48:28] the bible say that he staggered not at
[48:30] the promise of god through unbelief
[48:32] and considered not the deadness of his
[48:34] own body or the deadness of sarah's
[48:35] woman i mean that's what the bible says
[48:37] right i'm not just using you know the
[48:40] message search program and trying to
[48:41] find all the places where brother
[48:42] branham contradicted himself i'm just
[48:44] reading the bible
[48:46] and that it says and he says here and
[48:48] i'm not implying there's a lot of places
[48:49] where he does but i'm just referring to
[48:51] the critics who try to make things
[48:52] compete and work against themselves but
[48:55] he says he's saying shall this happen to
[48:57] me whose body is dead and to her whose
[48:59] womb is dead and in verse 18 and abraham
[49:01] said unto god oh that ishmael might live
[49:04] before thee
[49:06] think about this exchange
[49:09] god this is this is genesis chapter 17.
[49:12] he has spoken to him when he was in ur
[49:14] he has spoken to him when he was in iran
[49:16] he he built an altar to him in genesis
[49:18] chapter 12 god defended him when he lied
[49:21] to pharaoh and rescued him he has made
[49:24] himself known to him and allowing him to
[49:26] rescue his brother his nephew lot he has
[49:28] he's expressed himself manifest himself
[49:30] as melchizedek he's appeared to him in a
[49:32] vision as his cover and his defender and
[49:34] and he's changed his name and he's going
[49:37] through all these things he's changed
[49:38] sarah's name and he's fully expressed
[49:40] the promise abram you are now abraham
[49:42] because you're not just going to be a
[49:43] father of a son but you're going to be
[49:45] the father of many nations and sarah is
[49:47] going to be sarah because she's also
[49:49] going to be a mother of many nations
[49:50] this is who the promise is through and
[49:51] abraham's instinctive response is oh let
[49:54] ishmael be the one
[49:58] i'm this this reads in your bible right
[50:00] i mean it's the same one do i need
[50:01] somebody else to give me another
[50:02] translation
[50:03] instead of hey siri let's say okay
[50:04] google
[50:05] all right let's open up genesis chapter
[50:07] chapter 17. so we could read this
[50:09] together to realize he still is offering
[50:12] up this isn't this isn't because of the
[50:14] lack of faith
[50:16] he's fully persuaded
[50:18] that god is able to keep the promise but
[50:20] there's tension about who the heir is
[50:22] going to be
[50:24] he's not he's uncertain
[50:26] he's uncertain who this one
[50:29] who is going to be the one
[50:31] to fulfill the promise
[50:33] and not through unbelief
[50:35] but through a lack of understanding he
[50:37] said oh but could it be
[50:38] ishmael could it please be ishmael that
[50:41] would live before thee
[50:43] and if you look at abraham's journey
[50:45] it's one of increasing tension between
[50:47] god's promise to him
[50:49] and all the things that threaten it
[50:52] it kind of follows a literary technique
[50:54] of the maybe the hero's journey might be
[50:56] one that you could look at he's called
[50:58] out has this crisis has this moment of
[51:01] epiphany so there's maybe some literary
[51:03] techniques that you could use to
[51:04] identify and understand the story of
[51:06] abraham's journey but there's this
[51:08] obstacle that's always in his way
[51:10] god makes a promise but your wife is
[51:12] barren
[51:14] god makes a promise but there's a famine
[51:16] in the land god makes a promise but
[51:17] pharaoh's trying to take your wife god
[51:19] makes a promise but this is happening
[51:20] and that's happening and there's always
[51:21] this tension between the promise of god
[51:23] and all the things that threaten and
[51:25] there's always this question okay we
[51:26] accept the fact that god said i'm going
[51:28] to have an heir but who's it going to be
[51:29] anyways
[51:32] and one one final thought that i want to
[51:35] i want to use just to kind of look at
[51:36] this uh process and this journey of
[51:38] faith will bear these things in mind
[51:41] about abraham suffering these
[51:42] disappointments and discouragements and
[51:44] being cast down and all these different
[51:46] things that he went through and then now
[51:48] if this specific
[51:50] uh uh channel
[51:52] of this difficulty that he he faces in
[51:54] that trying to
[51:55] not fully understand the plan of god
[51:57] though he's fully persuaded of it not
[51:59] fully understanding the plan of god
[52:02] i want just to look maybe we could do it
[52:04] very quickly
[52:07] but abraham was always on the move
[52:12] the bible tells us that he
[52:14] was always seeking and always searching
[52:16] for something
[52:17] and if you look at his life it kind of
[52:19] seems unstable
[52:21] because he travels and he has these
[52:23] several years of travel and he finally
[52:24] gets to a place and god said this is the
[52:26] land i told you
[52:28] that i was going to give to thee but yet
[52:29] he's still nomadic
[52:31] he's still a wonderer
[52:33] he still travels from place to place
[52:35] notice what it says in genesis chapter
[52:36] 11 verse 31 and terror which took abram
[52:39] his son in lot the son of on his son's
[52:42] son and sarah his daughter-in-law his
[52:44] son abram's wife and they went forth
[52:46] with them from ur the chaldees to go
[52:49] into the land of canaan and they came
[52:51] unto heran and dwelt there this is the
[52:53] first step in this process in abraham's
[52:56] journey and so he moved once
[53:00] there are people here who've moved
[53:01] several times
[53:02] you know how the devil tries to create a
[53:03] stigma you know oh well you how many
[53:05] churches have you been to and how many
[53:07] times have you moved all right i got the
[53:09] father of my faith okay
[53:13] and so you want to argue with me about
[53:14] moves and and
[53:16] and there's some that would try to make
[53:17] it a reproach that we as a church are
[53:19] meeting in different tents
[53:21] all over the valley
[53:23] but uh but that was exactly what moab
[53:25] had to say about israel
[53:27] right criticized her oh she didn't even
[53:29] have a home church brother member even
[53:30] says that didn't even have a home church
[53:32] as it was and that was a criticism of
[53:34] the children of israel but you know
[53:36] we're in exodus
[53:38] we're in a rapture and if this thing's
[53:40] going to be wrapped up real soon then we
[53:41] would have had this duplicate expression
[53:44] within our journey even as a church that
[53:46] we existed from one place of fellowship
[53:48] and one house and one tent the
[53:50] tabernacle was always in motion as we
[53:52] went to that time of translation and
[53:53] crossing the jordan into that promised
[53:55] land and that meeting in the air but
[53:56] that's always a source of criticism
[53:59] moving moving moving roving roaming
[54:01] roaming
[54:02] there's one move from urban the counties
[54:04] to go into the land of canaan and they
[54:06] don't quite get to the land of canaan
[54:08] it says in genesis chapter 12 verses 5
[54:10] and 6 and abram took sarah his wife and
[54:12] lot his brother's son and all their
[54:14] substance that they had gathered and the
[54:15] souls that they had gotten in iran and
[54:17] they went both to go into the land of
[54:19] canaan
[54:21] and into the land of canaan they came
[54:25] and abram passed through the land and to
[54:27] the place of shechem so he comes into
[54:29] the land of canaan and he doesn't settle
[54:30] down he still keeps going but notice
[54:32] this place shechem under the plain of
[54:34] mora
[54:35] and the canaanite was then in the land
[54:39] if you look kind of like a map in the
[54:41] journey of abraham from where he began
[54:43] in irv the caudis and it would have been
[54:45] a very beautiful city and he would have
[54:46] been traveling along the euphrates river
[54:49] and along a established trade route it's
[54:51] very remarkable when you dig into the
[54:52] life of abraham how there's many uh
[54:55] archaeologists and scholars who say that
[54:57] in his travel uh from the euphrates and
[55:00] following along to where he entered into
[55:01] canada he would have passed dozens over
[55:03] 30 different altars built to false gods
[55:07] and these would have been constant
[55:08] reminders to him of all these false
[55:11] deities and these false gods and from
[55:12] earth to her end he would have traveled
[55:14] about 700 miles
[55:16] and then another 700 miles to syria
[55:18] where he would have been entered into
[55:20] begin to enter into what we would call
[55:22] canaan and he would have come through
[55:23] syria maybe dwelt around damascus for
[55:25] some time and then he begins to travel
[55:27] through canaan because it says he passed
[55:29] through the land into the place of
[55:30] shechem
[55:33] so 700 miles another 700 miles in
[55:35] genesis chapter 12 verses 8 to 10 and he
[55:37] removed from fence unto a mountain on
[55:39] the east of bethel and pitched his tent
[55:41] having bethel in the west and haye on
[55:43] the east and there he builded an altar
[55:45] unto the lord and called upon the name
[55:47] of the lord he invoked the name of
[55:48] jehovah
[55:50] and
[55:51] abram journeyed going on still towards
[55:53] the south i'm already losing count
[55:57] because it doesn't tell us how many
[55:58] times he unpacked the boxes or packed
[56:00] them back up how many tents he set up
[56:02] how many days he spent there how many
[56:03] days he spent there
[56:05] i remember as we were traveling quite a
[56:07] bit as a family through a few years and
[56:09] then in 2019 we were gone for six whole
[56:12] months
[56:14] and uh and then we moved to north
[56:16] carolina and we're in north carolina uh
[56:18] for a few months and jack came to me i
[56:19] think was in early january and he said
[56:21] dad are you done preaching in north
[56:23] carolina yet
[56:24] i think he i think he just thought that
[56:26] we finally decided just to bring all our
[56:28] stuff with us when i go out and preach
[56:29] and we just take in his bed and put it
[56:31] in this room
[56:32] and he felt unsettled there's even a
[56:34] point where he said mom you remember the
[56:35] white house and we're like when we
[56:37] toured the white house in d.c and he's
[56:38] like no the white house in texas he was
[56:40] referring to our house
[56:42] in texas and it was usually in terms of
[56:44] do you remember and this isn't after we
[56:46] moved this is why we still live there
[56:50] because that's just how much we are
[56:51] muslim now when we count our moves we
[56:52] have to count the month we spent in cays
[56:54] or north carolina the month we spent in
[56:56] in lake leland michigan and the month we
[56:58] spit this we've moved dozens of times
[57:01] take heart my friends
[57:05] and here he is traveling yet again
[57:08] it says in genesis 12 18 and removed
[57:09] from fence unto a mountain on the east
[57:11] of bethel now he's moved to the east of
[57:13] bethel then verse 9 and abraham
[57:15] journeyed going on still towards the
[57:17] south
[57:18] he leaves irv the chaldees he moves
[57:20] along the recipes river and as he moves
[57:22] along this river he starts coming down
[57:24] to what would be modern-day syria he's
[57:26] entering into canaan land but he doesn't
[57:28] stop once he's there and god says see
[57:29] this land this is land i told i was
[57:30] going to give you and then he keeps
[57:31] going
[57:33] that's as you journey towards the south
[57:34] verse 10 and there was a famine in the
[57:36] land and abram went down into egypt a
[57:38] soldier in there for the famine was
[57:40] grievous in the land he goes another 800
[57:42] miles
[57:44] into egypt
[57:46] this is the this is the father of your
[57:47] faith
[57:48] this is his journey
[57:50] then in genesis chapter 13 verse 1 and
[57:52] abram went up out of egypt he and his
[57:54] wife and all that he had in lot with him
[57:56] into the south now he's going back and
[57:58] decaying going right back where he left
[58:01] then it says in verse 18 then abram
[58:03] removed just tint and came and dwelt in
[58:05] the plain of mammary which is in hebron
[58:07] and built there an altar unto the lord
[58:10] notice how his journey is taking place
[58:12] and travels into canaan builds an altar
[58:14] keeps going south goes into egypt comes
[58:16] back out builds another altar he's
[58:18] traveling and he's always moving always
[58:21] on the go genesis chapter 20 verse 1 and
[58:24] abraham journeyed from fence towards the
[58:26] south country and dwelled betw between
[58:28] cadus and sher and sojourned in gerard
[58:32] moving once again
[58:35] it says in verse 34 of chapter 21 and
[58:37] abraham's soul journeyed in the
[58:38] philistines land
[58:40] many days
[58:42] but there was another move because in
[58:43] genesis 23 verse 2 it says sarah died in
[58:46] kurthara
[58:47] the same as hebron in the land of canaan
[58:50] and abraham came to the mount to mourn
[58:52] sarah and to weep for with her for her
[58:56] just trying to do so quickly with the
[58:58] number of scriptures just paint the
[58:59] picture
[59:01] that he begins he begins in er and he
[59:03] travels
[59:04] along these trade routes but then he
[59:05] starts headed south to go into the land
[59:07] of canaan and then he does go into the
[59:08] land of canaan and he comes in the land
[59:10] of promise but then he continues to the
[59:12] place of shechem and then he keeps
[59:13] journeying south
[59:15] and he comes to bethel and then he
[59:16] leaves bethlehem he comes down into
[59:18] egypt and then he comes back up and then
[59:20] he goes a little bit further and then he
[59:21] comes down over here and he comes back
[59:23] over here and abraham's moving all over
[59:25] the place and as he moves he's building
[59:26] these altars
[59:28] and it may seem like this long fruitless
[59:31] journey
[59:32] where abraham has these ups and downs
[59:35] and maybe he invites conflict and he
[59:36] struggles because he's done this and he
[59:38] went there and he went down in egypt and
[59:40] he created this problem and he went over
[59:41] here with with lot and created this
[59:43] struggle in this fight and he finds
[59:44] himself in this place and it puts his
[59:46] family in trouble and he has to go out
[59:47] and fight and you can look at abraham's
[59:49] journey from the moment he called them
[59:50] out of ur with these great big plans and
[59:52] promises
[59:54] right we dramatized it before how he's
[59:56] bragging as he leaves er be the father
[59:58] of many nations all right you know
[1:00:00] through me all the families of the earth
[1:00:02] can be blessed and 20 something years
[1:00:03] later he's still just a tent caravan
[1:00:07] his wife dies he has to buy a burial
[1:00:09] plot can you give me a possession i'm a
[1:00:11] stranger in this land he's saying this
[1:00:13] in genesis 23 3 i'm a stranger in this
[1:00:15] land i'm a soldier i have no plot i have
[1:00:17] no possession i want to buy a place to
[1:00:19] lay my wife's body
[1:00:21] you're like man here's a guy
[1:00:24] with a lot of boast a lot of brags
[1:00:27] and yet he's not this harambe he's not
[1:00:29] this nimrod he's not this one you're
[1:00:30] like oh my goodness this guy is so great
[1:00:32] he has such a great name he's a
[1:00:34] conqueror he's a king he's a he has a
[1:00:36] name and he commands authority he's
[1:00:38] having to buy a grave to bury his wife
[1:00:41] decades after the promise
[1:00:45] and it may seem very very frustrating
[1:00:47] maybe for those who believe in father
[1:00:49] abraham but think about how abraham must
[1:00:51] have felt
[1:00:53] but you always go back to the word of
[1:00:55] god to find the reason find the promise
[1:00:58] and in genesis chapter 13 verses 17 to
[1:01:00] 18 all right wake yourselves up this is
[1:01:02] the part that really really got me
[1:01:03] excited so if you've just been hanging
[1:01:05] on to this point you know take your luca
[1:01:07] energy shot
[1:01:09] uh put some lavender
[1:01:11] under your tongue
[1:01:12] or is it your big toe whichever works
[1:01:14] for you
[1:01:15] because we're on our home stretch now
[1:01:18] or maybe some peppermint on your temples
[1:01:21] rub it in a little bit
[1:01:23] you have a prayer line to anoint you
[1:01:24] with peppermint get rid of that headache
[1:01:26] kind of wake you up clear your sinuses a
[1:01:28] little bit i want to hear some amen
[1:01:29] sister julia this is your chance to get
[1:01:31] out of that special at the end
[1:01:33] and genesis chapter 13 verses 17 and 18
[1:01:36] this is god speaking i put it in red
[1:01:37] letter in my notes arise
[1:01:40] walk through the land and the length of
[1:01:41] it
[1:01:42] and the breath of it
[1:01:44] for i'll give it unto thee
[1:01:47] you look at the travels of abraham from
[1:01:48] one perspective this guy just can't get
[1:01:50] a grip he doesn't know when to stop look
[1:01:52] what he's doing but yet he keeps moving
[1:01:54] he keeps traveling he keeps there's
[1:01:56] variances and archaeologists and people
[1:01:58] reading into the text say you know it
[1:02:00] was more than likely that he went here
[1:02:01] and did this and he went there and did
[1:02:03] that and he's doing some exploring he's
[1:02:04] doing some side hikes and he's doing all
[1:02:06] these side quests and all these other
[1:02:07] adventures and he's walking through it
[1:02:08] and it's god who said walk through the
[1:02:10] land
[1:02:12] listen abram didn't just show up to the
[1:02:14] message and say i believe it and i'm
[1:02:16] just going to sit down and wait until
[1:02:17] one day this body's changed he had a
[1:02:19] commandment this is your promise dig
[1:02:22] everything you can out of it walk in it
[1:02:24] learn it love it know it take it in your
[1:02:26] bosom and feed on it and he walked
[1:02:28] through the land he said walk the length
[1:02:30] of it walk the breath of it in other
[1:02:31] words walk all the way through it
[1:02:35] this is the commandment that abram was
[1:02:36] under walk through the land and the
[1:02:37] length of it and the breath of it for i
[1:02:39] will give it unto thee then abram
[1:02:41] removed his tent and came and dwelt in
[1:02:44] the plane of memory which is in hebron
[1:02:45] and built there an altar unto the lord
[1:02:47] and you're thinking well why didn't you
[1:02:48] just read that verse first
[1:02:50] why do you read verse 17 before you read
[1:02:52] verse 18. you tricked us into thinking
[1:02:54] that abram is just this aimless wonder
[1:02:56] nomad running through the desert with no
[1:02:58] place to find but god had said get up
[1:03:00] and walk through it
[1:03:02] and by walking in it abraham was taking
[1:03:04] possession of it
[1:03:06] because even in the civil law at that
[1:03:08] time when you were going to take
[1:03:09] possession of something you walked it
[1:03:11] you wanted to identify the parcel of
[1:03:13] land that was going to be sold to you
[1:03:15] and that you were going to buy you
[1:03:16] walked it
[1:03:17] you measured it out you put footsteps on
[1:03:19] it because according to the civil law at
[1:03:21] the time you would have you would have
[1:03:22] demonstrated this is the land
[1:03:25] for dog lovers he's marking his
[1:03:26] territory right
[1:03:28] he's walking through and said this is
[1:03:30] mine i own it this is mine i own it this
[1:03:33] is mine i own it and he's walking
[1:03:35] through the land this walking was
[1:03:36] possession
[1:03:38] and it puts in context now this is where
[1:03:40] i'm wanting to turn the corner limit
[1:03:41] you've all have pulled so well this
[1:03:42] morning that i it's your fault that i'm
[1:03:44] getting a little bit long-winded
[1:03:46] but notice the promise now when it's
[1:03:48] given and not many of you laughed then
[1:03:50] so i apologize
[1:03:51] but the more it's better i'll keep going
[1:03:53] in deuteronomy 11
[1:03:55] when god begins to speak to israel
[1:03:56] they're going back to the promised land
[1:03:57] we just think well god's saying go back
[1:03:59] in there and chase these people away
[1:04:01] there had already been a precedent
[1:04:03] and this is what i want you to catch the
[1:04:04] life of abraham what it demonstrates for
[1:04:06] us and what it how it blesses us god
[1:04:08] says in deuteronomy 11 24 every place
[1:04:11] where on the soles of your feet shall
[1:04:12] tread shall be yours
[1:04:15] from the wilderness and lebanon from the
[1:04:17] river the river euphrates even under the
[1:04:19] uttermost sea shall your coast beam and
[1:04:22] when you look at the journey of abraham
[1:04:24] he went along the euphrates went along
[1:04:26] the coast went to the river went down
[1:04:28] into this place abraham had already
[1:04:30] walked the length of it and the breadth
[1:04:32] of it
[1:04:33] and so now when he talks to the children
[1:04:35] of israel and he says go in there and
[1:04:37] every place the souls of your feet shall
[1:04:38] tread from the wilderness if so shall
[1:04:41] your land be it shall be yours their
[1:04:44] father abraham to whom the promise was
[1:04:46] given had already marked it out for them
[1:04:51] and joshua in joshua 24 3 it says god
[1:04:54] speaking as they're there getting ready
[1:04:56] to cross over in genesis 24.
[1:04:58] he says get ready to take possession and
[1:05:00] take full possession he says i took your
[1:05:02] father abraham from the other side of
[1:05:04] the flood
[1:05:06] and led him throughout all the land of
[1:05:08] canaan
[1:05:10] who led him in canaan
[1:05:12] who had led him he here led him there
[1:05:15] and let him what's the most important
[1:05:17] thing that's the
[1:05:18] leading
[1:05:20] and he says i let him throughout all the
[1:05:22] land of canaan
[1:05:23] meanwhile his extended family kind of
[1:05:25] grabbed the popcorn where is he moving
[1:05:26] this time
[1:05:28] i wonder how active that whatsapp group
[1:05:29] was
[1:05:30] where are you going this time abraham
[1:05:33] and yet it's god that led him throughout
[1:05:35] all canaan and multiplied his seed and
[1:05:37] gave him isaac
[1:05:38] you know god had a purpose in him being
[1:05:40] quote unquote aimless
[1:05:42] god had a purpose in this frustrating
[1:05:44] journey
[1:05:45] and if abraham ever had developed a
[1:05:47] sense of frustration all he had to go
[1:05:49] back to is walk through the land
[1:05:52] the length of it and the breadth of it
[1:05:54] god himself
[1:05:56] gives us this understanding that i'm the
[1:05:58] one that took abraham
[1:06:00] and led him throughout all the land of
[1:06:01] canaan
[1:06:02] i'm the one that took him on the other
[1:06:04] side of that and he's the one that
[1:06:05] crossed over i'm the one that made him a
[1:06:07] hebrew
[1:06:10] and when abraham crossed over he says i
[1:06:12] took your father abraham from the other
[1:06:13] side of the flood and let him throughout
[1:06:15] all the land of canaan joshua's standing
[1:06:16] there
[1:06:17] in this spot in this particular place as
[1:06:20] he gives this commandment
[1:06:23] and in genesis chapter 12 abraham's
[1:06:25] first stop once he crossed the flood the
[1:06:28] river was at shechem
[1:06:30] and there he built an altar
[1:06:32] what i read about in genesis chapter 12.
[1:06:35] 500 years later
[1:06:37] joshua stands in the exact spot
[1:06:40] he says in verse 1 of joshua 24 and
[1:06:42] joshua gathered all the tribes of israel
[1:06:44] to shechem
[1:06:46] and call for the elders of israel for
[1:06:48] and for their heads and for their judges
[1:06:50] and for their officers and they
[1:06:51] presented themselves before god and
[1:06:53] joshua said unto all people thus saith
[1:06:55] the lord god of israel your father's
[1:06:57] dwelt on the other side of the flood in
[1:06:59] old time even tara the father of abraham
[1:07:01] and the father of nicor and they served
[1:07:03] other gods and i took your father
[1:07:05] abraham from the other side of the flood
[1:07:08] and led them throughout all the land of
[1:07:09] canaan and multiplied his seed and gave
[1:07:11] him isaac and now joshua is saying this
[1:07:15] as he stands exactly where abraham stood
[1:07:19] as he stood in shechem in the very place
[1:07:21] that abraham had already built an altar
[1:07:23] it was a ground that abraham had already
[1:07:26] consecrated a ground that abraham had
[1:07:28] already possessed so joshua wasn't just
[1:07:30] guessing he wasn't just saying all this
[1:07:32] looks good but he was standing in a
[1:07:34] place that had been bought he stood at a
[1:07:36] place that had purchased he stood in a
[1:07:38] place had been consecrated
[1:07:40] where his father had stood before and
[1:07:42] built an altar it was not aimless it was
[1:07:45] not baseless it was not blind trust but
[1:07:47] he had precedent
[1:07:49] can we relate to the faith of the royal
[1:07:52] seed of abraham to know that the seed of
[1:07:54] abraham jesus christ has already stood
[1:07:57] on this ground and has asked us to take
[1:07:59] it with him
[1:08:02] not very far from that place abraham's
[1:08:04] grandson jacob
[1:08:07] dug a well
[1:08:08] not too far from here
[1:08:10] and then 1500 years later
[1:08:12] john chapter 4 says jesus had needs to
[1:08:15] go by samaria and he came to a city
[1:08:17] which is called saikar
[1:08:19] shashem
[1:08:20] comes to the same city near a parcel of
[1:08:23] ground that jacob gave his son joseph
[1:08:26] jacob the grant the son of isaac the son
[1:08:28] of abraham
[1:08:29] given to his son joe look at this chain
[1:08:31] of command and jacob's well was there
[1:08:34] it's about the sixth hour of the day he
[1:08:36] comes
[1:08:37] to the well and the woman of samaria is
[1:08:38] there and he says give me a drink
[1:08:41] what becomes the focal point
[1:08:44] our fathers dug this well
[1:08:46] and it's all going back to abraham
[1:08:50] why because abraham visited that spot
[1:08:53] and abraham had claimed that ground
[1:08:56] and it was abraham's possession that was
[1:08:58] given to isaac that was given to jacob
[1:08:59] that was given to joseph and there was a
[1:09:01] well built there and it becomes the very
[1:09:03] canvas the very context the very
[1:09:05] parameters within which all the promises
[1:09:08] of god are going to unfold
[1:09:11] and abraham traveled that land as if it
[1:09:13] was required that he touched every inch
[1:09:15] of it to possess it
[1:09:18] think about just looking at this
[1:09:19] frustrating journey of abraham but i
[1:09:21] want you to realize that god through all
[1:09:22] of it had a purpose
[1:09:24] abraham visited every single land that
[1:09:26] bordered canaan he was in egypt gaza
[1:09:28] lebanon syria
[1:09:31] they say today that there's no place an
[1:09:33] israelite can go within the promised
[1:09:34] land where he didn't go
[1:09:37] there was nowhere to live in the
[1:09:39] promised land where he didn't already
[1:09:40] live
[1:09:42] there was no place to fight where he had
[1:09:44] not already fought
[1:09:46] no war to win that he hadn't already won
[1:09:49] this is the legend of abraham's faith
[1:09:51] this is the outcome of his journey why
[1:09:52] you went there why you went there
[1:09:54] but in every place that abraham
[1:09:56] journeyed he placed footsteps of
[1:09:57] possession
[1:09:59] and he built altars to the lord
[1:10:02] the countries he soldiered in the places
[1:10:04] the sojourned in the places he
[1:10:06] worshipped in
[1:10:08] we took a map and we began to identify
[1:10:10] he came here that he entered down he
[1:10:11] traveled this way if you look at his
[1:10:13] life in total the places he visited are
[1:10:15] later possessed by or visited by his
[1:10:17] descendants
[1:10:19] jacob at bethel joseph and egypt joshua
[1:10:21] shashem samson and philistia boaz and
[1:10:24] jordan samuel shiloh david on moriah
[1:10:26] solomon in jerusalem jesus at shechem
[1:10:29] paul at damascus
[1:10:31] think about all these prominent places
[1:10:34] where the you have these uh remarkable
[1:10:36] events in the seat of abraham taking
[1:10:38] place and abraham's already wearing the
[1:10:40] shirt been there
[1:10:42] he's already got the but his his water
[1:10:44] bottle always has a sticker from the
[1:10:45] visitor center on it
[1:10:48] and here's samuel and shiloh and and
[1:10:50] abraham's over there looking at his
[1:10:52] shiloh sticker
[1:10:54] yeah i remember that hike that was a
[1:10:55] good one
[1:10:56] right they don't that he's been there
[1:10:58] he's walked it
[1:11:01] all these places abraham had already
[1:11:03] visited
[1:11:04] sacrificed worshipped possessed
[1:11:08] and what i want you to think about right
[1:11:09] now
[1:11:10] and if you could just somehow begin to
[1:11:12] think now that as the pattern was laid
[1:11:14] down in the father abraham of the
[1:11:16] natural seed jesus christ the seed of
[1:11:18] abraham has already possessed certain
[1:11:20] promises for you by his stripes you are
[1:11:23] healed he has already suffered the
[1:11:25] rejection he has suffered the sorrow he
[1:11:28] has suffered the grief and as it were
[1:11:30] that david could be at jerusalem solomon
[1:11:32] jerusalem jesus that's shechem paul of
[1:11:35] damascus samuel shiloh boaz and jordan
[1:11:38] and
[1:11:39] joseph and egypt and all these places
[1:11:41] it's almost as if abraham had already
[1:11:44] consecrated them had already claimed all
[1:11:47] these places for all of them
[1:11:50] he had already done it so that when they
[1:11:51] were there samuel can say my father
[1:11:54] abraham was here when joshua was there
[1:11:56] my father abraham was here no matter
[1:11:59] where paul went he could say my father
[1:12:02] was here
[1:12:06] even in what seemed to be his wonderings
[1:12:08] in his frustrations and his sorrows god
[1:12:11] was in control
[1:12:14] god was using him as a forerunner as a
[1:12:17] father of our faith who has to
[1:12:18] experience certain things so that once
[1:12:20] he's experienced it he could radiate
[1:12:22] back to those of us who find ourselves
[1:12:24] in the same place he's saying that where
[1:12:26] you are today sister i've already
[1:12:28] consecrated that ground that where you
[1:12:30] are today brother i've already built an
[1:12:32] altar there this is hallowed ground
[1:12:34] god's already met me there there's no
[1:12:36] place where we ought to despair but
[1:12:38] jesus christ has already made it a place
[1:12:42] consecrated forever for you
[1:12:45] god was in control
[1:12:47] in the message victory day
[1:12:49] this will just try to sum it all up to
[1:12:51] you he says god lets disappointments
[1:12:53] happen
[1:12:55] to show victory
[1:12:58] abraham's disappointments were just
[1:13:00] progress towards
[1:13:01] victory
[1:13:03] get up and go wasn't that he lost that
[1:13:05] ground there was another ground he had
[1:13:07] to consecrate
[1:13:08] it wasn't that all that altar wasn't
[1:13:10] good enough there was another altar he
[1:13:11] had to build
[1:13:14] oh if we can only see that
[1:13:17] god let's disappointments happen to show
[1:13:18] victory
[1:13:19] oh if we can only see that
[1:13:21] you'd only see that these things that
[1:13:23] seem to be so burring you and upsetting
[1:13:26] you
[1:13:27] they are trials
[1:13:28] they are things to stand still and focus
[1:13:31] your glasses on the word of god
[1:13:33] the things that seem to be burning us
[1:13:35] and bothering us so much and upset us
[1:13:36] and getting us to talk and and worry and
[1:13:39] express frustration and disappointments
[1:13:40] and fear he said if no they're there so
[1:13:43] that you can take your glasses
[1:13:45] your binoculars your scope
[1:13:48] and take it off the negative
[1:13:50] and put it on the promise
[1:13:52] if all we did was zero in on and abraham
[1:13:54] moved and abraham moved and oh my
[1:13:56] goodness look at this character and
[1:13:57] abraham moved and have you seen their
[1:13:59] linkedin profile i've never seen so many
[1:14:01] cities lived in in my life can you
[1:14:03] believe this guy
[1:14:05] and then just take her glasses off of
[1:14:07] his google timeline
[1:14:08] and just zero right in on the verse 17
[1:14:11] oh god said walk through the land and
[1:14:12] the length of it in the breath of it oh
[1:14:14] god says right here i took abraham from
[1:14:17] the other side of the flood and led him
[1:14:18] throughout all the land of canaan well
[1:14:19] then never mind
[1:14:22] maybe i shouldn't be so critical of
[1:14:24] abraham it was god that was doing it
[1:14:27] he said oh just focus your glasses on
[1:14:29] the word of god and speak the word and
[1:14:31] then just walk forward
[1:14:34] that's all there is to do it the time we
[1:14:36] say god i don't know what to do i'm up
[1:14:38] against it speak the word lord i believe
[1:14:44] and just start walking forward
[1:14:47] god does the opening of the sea you just
[1:14:50] keep walking
[1:14:52] that gives us courage
[1:14:54] that if abraham suffered these
[1:14:56] disappointments and these
[1:14:56] discouragements and he seemed to be this
[1:14:59] itinerant farmer and this wonder and
[1:15:00] this nomad this merchant that's just
[1:15:02] following these trade routes and seeking
[1:15:04] opportunities and and having to pack up
[1:15:07] and and move and to go all these
[1:15:08] different places and finds himself in
[1:15:10] strife and these different chapters and
[1:15:12] these different crises then we can look
[1:15:14] at the example of abraham and there he
[1:15:16] built an altar and there he worshipped
[1:15:18] the lord then we too as the royal seed
[1:15:20] of abraham can just praise them when we
[1:15:22] come into trouble praise them when we
[1:15:24] come into these situations praise them
[1:15:25] when we find ourselves in these
[1:15:27] circumstances because we are troubled we
[1:15:29] are perplexed we are persecuted we are
[1:15:32] cast down but we are not distressed we
[1:15:35] are not in despair we are not forsaken
[1:15:38] we are not destroyed so that i can
[1:15:40] praise him in this trouble let me
[1:15:43] encourage you this morning that you can
[1:15:45] build an altar right there in your
[1:15:47] sorrow you can build an altar right
[1:15:49] there in your distress it's father
[1:15:51] abraham built an altar he's like this
[1:15:53] ground has been purchased by my lord
[1:15:56] this sorrow has been claimed by my lord
[1:15:59] and right here i'm building an altar to
[1:16:01] worship
[1:16:04] we could do as abraham did
[1:16:07] possess that ground for your children
[1:16:10] consecrate that ground for future
[1:16:12] generations right now in your sorrow
[1:16:14] right now in your difficulty right now
[1:16:15] in your stress and your tribulation
[1:16:17] right now and whatever you're going
[1:16:18] through i'm going to consecrate this
[1:16:20] ground because one day my son's going to
[1:16:21] find himself at this same altar one day
[1:16:23] my son's going to find himself in the
[1:16:25] same place one day they're going to
[1:16:27] visit shiloh one day and they'll be back
[1:16:29] at shechem one day they'll find
[1:16:31] themselves in egypt one day they're
[1:16:33] going to be in damascus but i've already
[1:16:35] been there and i've prayed and i've
[1:16:37] consecrated and i've declared that this
[1:16:40] is my possession and it is theirs also
[1:16:46] that's the promise of god
[1:16:49] you could right now you could just build
[1:16:51] an altar
[1:16:53] say i'm consecrating this ground i'm
[1:16:55] claiming this ground because one day my
[1:16:57] child is going to come to this
[1:17:01] but mike if you could come
[1:17:05] there's other musicians you're welcome
[1:17:08] to play
[1:17:13] i took your father abraham
[1:17:16] out of her
[1:17:17] of the chaldees
[1:17:19] i'm the reason why
[1:17:21] he traveled all the land of canaan
[1:17:24] why because footsteps were possession
[1:17:27] and as he walked it he claimed it and as
[1:17:29] he walked it he offered up sacrifices
[1:17:30] and he built altars in every place he
[1:17:32] visited later on you find
[1:17:34] these descendants of abraham
[1:17:36] back in the same place
[1:17:39] they were already purchased
[1:17:41] it was ground that already been
[1:17:42] conquered it was a place where there had
[1:17:44] already been a victory why because god
[1:17:45] let disappointments come to show victory
[1:17:49] and the message i know brother branson
[1:17:51] said neither could death and old age
[1:17:52] take abraham
[1:17:54] until the purpose of god
[1:17:56] had been finished
[1:18:02] he says neither can it take you
[1:18:05] or can it take me
[1:18:07] until the purpose of god of our life is
[1:18:09] finished
[1:18:11] we've heard this a number of times right
[1:18:14] now
[1:18:15] if we could relate to abraham
[1:18:18] all things work together for the good
[1:18:20] right to them that love god or be called
[1:18:22] according to his purpose
[1:18:25] the tension isn't around that he's gonna
[1:18:27] make it work for good the tension around
[1:18:28] his what's in all things
[1:18:30] right
[1:18:32] that's where the tension is sometimes
[1:18:34] because we don't know what all things
[1:18:35] i'm gonna have to suffer
[1:18:36] we don't know all the ingredients that's
[1:18:38] working into this thing to come out good
[1:18:40] and so while we're in kind of the mix
[1:18:43] and we're in the process of things
[1:18:44] unfolding we can act just like abraham
[1:18:46] and we're like
[1:18:47] well
[1:18:48] uh what what what is the good that's
[1:18:51] gonna come out of this
[1:18:52] why is this happening
[1:18:55] but there's a place that we could come
[1:18:56] to to realize
[1:18:58] that god is in control
[1:19:02] and then we look at the example of
[1:19:03] abraham how that through his wonderings
[1:19:05] and his
[1:19:06] movements he was laying this pattern in
[1:19:09] these footsteps
[1:19:10] that his seed would one day follow
[1:19:13] and i said oh god always had it in
[1:19:15] control
[1:19:18] we can trust god the same way
[1:19:20] and not even have to do it the way
[1:19:22] abraham did
[1:19:23] because he was the forerunner
[1:19:26] we don't even have to do it in the same
[1:19:27] way that brother branham did we've
[1:19:29] already been afforded an example
[1:19:31] i was thinking of it this morning my my
[1:19:32] dad's birthday is this coming
[1:19:35] and
[1:19:36] and i was just thinking this morning of
[1:19:38] how i had the benefit of being raised in
[1:19:40] a home
[1:19:41] where parents who had already accepted
[1:19:43] the message
[1:19:45] and so there's this progress there's
[1:19:47] this process that that i'm a beneficiary
[1:19:49] of now just amplify that by brazilian
[1:19:51] and you'll realize that you have the
[1:19:53] benefit today of all history
[1:19:56] and all accumulation of all faith of all
[1:19:58] believers through all ages all prophets
[1:19:59] all sages here we stand today with so
[1:20:02] many different clouds of witnesses can
[1:20:04] we not have confidence
[1:20:06] and the god that has called us
[1:20:09] just as abraham did being the first one
[1:20:13] if not more
[1:20:14] neither can it take you or take me until
[1:20:17] the purpose of god of our life is
[1:20:19] finished so we gather from their
[1:20:21] consolation
[1:20:24] and he says and why does god let
[1:20:25] troubles come
[1:20:27] god harnesses trouble
[1:20:30] puts bits in its mouth he doesn't just
[1:20:32] say this about death he says it about
[1:20:34] trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes
[1:20:36] it obey him
[1:20:38] and those troubles bring us into a
[1:20:40] closer fellowship
[1:20:42] with god
[1:20:44] we thought trouble was just driving
[1:20:46] abraham all over canaan
[1:20:48] god had put bits in trouble's mouth
[1:20:50] and with every move and every uprooting
[1:20:52] and every progress and everything it was
[1:20:54] just bringing him into closer fellowship
[1:20:56] with god can you trust him today
[1:20:59] can you just yield to his process
[1:21:02] accept the plan that he has for you
[1:21:03] could we stand together
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:12] jesus christ has already gone before us
[1:21:17] and purchased every
[1:21:18] every possession and every promise
[1:21:22] you have every right as abraham did
[1:21:23] every right as abraham seed did
[1:21:26] to worship and to claim those promises
[1:21:29] today with our heads bound
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:41] with our heads bowed if you
[1:21:44] need the lord to touch you
[1:21:47] could you take him at his word today
[1:21:51] just accept him
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:21:56] you need to lift your hands to him so
[1:21:57] god i'm lifting up my hands as abraham
[1:21:59] did in those plains and those valleys on
[1:22:01] those hills
[1:22:03] on a mount moriah
[1:22:05] at an altar surrounded by philistines
[1:22:07] lord
[1:22:08] i'm lifting up my hands to you
[1:22:11] wherever i may be in my situation
[1:22:13] whatever i may be in my heartache or my
[1:22:16] struggle lord i can find that i can
[1:22:18] worship you
[1:22:20] on a ground that's been consecrated by
[1:22:22] your blood
[1:22:24] at an altar that has been
[1:22:26] opened up to me as your son or daughter
[1:22:30] a gracious heavenly father
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:22:34] lord as we stand in your presence today
[1:22:37] we each want to have
[1:22:39] a different path
[1:22:41] in a different journey that has brought
[1:22:42] us
[1:22:43] to this house of worship
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:47] and regardless of the path that we have
[1:22:48] gone we relate to abraham's
[1:22:51] wandering
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:54] we relate to his uprootings
[1:22:57] we relate to how unsettled he might be
[1:23:00] might have been
[1:23:03] lord i believe that what we need today
[1:23:05] is a reminder of the promise
[1:23:08] abraham never stopped believing it was
[1:23:10] just times where he forgot
[1:23:13] and lord we can never stop believing
[1:23:15] there's just times that we forget
[1:23:18] and may we be reminded today lord of
[1:23:20] these great promises you have made
[1:23:22] towards us
[1:23:24] may we be reminded of the promise of
[1:23:26] comfort the promise of peace the promise
[1:23:28] of blessing the promise of our children
[1:23:30] the promise of salvation the promise of
[1:23:32] healing
[1:23:34] promise of comfort
[1:23:36] lord the fruits of the spirit
[1:23:39] the deep settled peace that we can
[1:23:41] benefit from that's within our souls
[1:23:42] lord whatever
[1:23:44] the struggle may be whatever the land
[1:23:46] that needs to be possessed maybe today
[1:23:47] lord we need to go on a walk
[1:23:50] we need to follow you we've got to
[1:23:52] hunker down and we've dug in our hills
[1:23:54] and we've tried to claim the ground that
[1:23:56] we're presently standing on but you want
[1:23:58] us to walk
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:00] because that's not the place you're
[1:24:02] gonna bless us we've got more footsteps
[1:24:04] to make on these promises and lord we've
[1:24:06] kind of cabbage down we've hunkered down
[1:24:08] but lord lose us now lord may we
[1:24:10] unburden ourselves and walk through
[1:24:12] these great promises
[1:24:13] been sitting on our hands sitting back
[1:24:15] for too long folders shoulders hands
[1:24:18] crossed hands on our hips lord just
[1:24:20] waiting and you're saying no walk in

[1:24:27] may we no longer be sitting still
[1:24:30] and lord may we not fear what man can do
[1:24:32] to us may we not fear what the future
[1:24:34] may hold but when we have a boldness
[1:24:36] knowing that you have already forever
[1:24:39] consecrated this way you have already
[1:24:41] built the altar you have already offered
[1:24:43] the sacrifice you have already shed your
[1:24:46] blood you have already manifested your
[1:24:48] presence
[1:24:51] so that there's no place we can go where
[1:24:52] you are not there
[1:24:55] no place we can travel where you have
[1:24:56] not been no place we can live where you
[1:24:59] have not lived no battle we can fight
[1:25:01] that you have not already won

[1:25:22] your leadership
[1:25:24] and you led abraham from altar to altar
