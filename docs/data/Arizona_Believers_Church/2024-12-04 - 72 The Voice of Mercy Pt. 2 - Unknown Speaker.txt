TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to just get right into the voice of Mercy part two and um just say a few things at the outset in order to catch everybody up on the same page but I'm wanting uh to continue in the subject but maybe drop back and just do a little bit U deeper dive on one particular aspect since Wednesday nights I feel affords us that privilege or that opportunity but we know that the house of the Lord as we looked again kind of refreshed this view of the house of the Lord being an image of God's Throne which is in heaven and it was AE figure of Christ and so we're wanting to look at even in using this title the voice of Mercy we're want to know the way to Mercy today how is it that we can receive Mercy in this hour especially considering the scriptures that have been fulfilled in this time and the Very wey and heavy heavy things that brother brandham said take place on these particular events whether it be the open of the seals the revealer of the son of man there's a lot of lines that we could draw on the sand and say oh that's it nobody's been saved since' 63 or nobody's been saved since 77 whatever it is people want to do but I believe that stems from misunderstanding of what's actually transpired and sometimes uh there's just an outside an allout rejection of what's happened because of the scarecrows that come up so we're wanting to look at where the word is today where Christ is today and using this example of the secret place of the Tabernacle this Dwelling Place of God I think it really really helps us to see what God's doing in this hour because it was a throne of Mercy mercy and judgment now we read this on Sunday brother BR makes this statement in Revelation 4 part 2 says first he was in the heavens above and shining in the Stars he say that was his first Throne second he was on Earth shining through the shikina glory that was in the temple and the Tabernacle behind that Veil next he come and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us still wearing his patience that's Christ so you see a throne in heaven then Moses makes a tabernacle the house of the Lord on Earth which is in the image of what he saw in heaven it's the throne room the Throne of God all these different things that we can bring out then God comes and he dwells in the flesh of his son and he's still wearing his patience he's still being longsuffering he said then he redeemed Man by his blood and came into his church in the form of the Holy Ghost he says and speak against that it's a finished thing done and that's a quite a statement we'll read that scripture uh here in a little bit I believe and he says now you can see where the shaking come we're at a time they don't really realize people can't comprehend what it mean and I believe that he's looking at a change in dispensation kind of an accumulation of the wickedness of Le to seea the darkness that has descended upon the world even his own Ministry being a under the spirit of Elijah being a messenger to the church going to be a son of man revealing the son of man the seventh a angel messenger in Revelations 10 uh there's a lot of things transpiring that he knows he's facing and that he knows he's coming up and he says that people don't realize what's happened they can't comprehend what it means he says first Throne was in heaven judgment seat second Throne was in Christ the third Throne is in man so he's bringing out those uh elements of the Throne of judgment or The Mercy Seat and how it's moved how we saw it in the temple in the Tabernacle we see it in Christ and now he says The Mercy Seat today is in the heart of man so that notice again the throne is The Mercy Seat and God's judgment seat or God's judgment throne and Jesus Christ then is one of these uh he's that dwelling place that house of the Lord in there throne in heaven throne in the temple now there throne in Christ then there's a throne in our heart but Jesus Christ became the dwelling place of God and in him we see the perfect image of the Fulfillment of the type of The Mercy Seat in Hebrews 12: 24 it says in Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel on Sunday we were wanting to point out in Scripture and according to the message of the hour how the blood speaks and how it's where that Voice of Truth is and where they're speaking the blood testifying there's where you'll find Mercy and here Christ has become the mediator of a better Testament a better Covenant that speaks better things than the blood of Abel and him being the meteor it's one that comes between two people with differences to remove those differences to bring them together on I want to say on equal footing but an equal understanding it's one who intervenes to make peace peace where there's a dissatisfaction where there's been a breach in a relationship a mediator restores that relationship or a mediator comes and confirms what promises have been made between two parties and and confirms the Covenant and in Job chapter 32: 33 I think this is just per put perfectly for he is not a man as I am that I should answer him and we should come together in judgment he's speaking about God how is it that he is a man that me as a man how can I get God to answer to me how can I get him to uh argue with me or come to my terms he says and we should come together in judgment to decide things to reconcile our differences he says neither is there any daan betwix us that might lay his hand upon us both may seem to be a little bit of an interesting phrase but this daan betwix us or this daan between us is a mediator one that would stand between it's this perfect picture of one who is a mediator stand between two parties and you have this desparate relationship between job who's a man and God who is not a man and and how are those two going to be reconciled how are they going to have a meeting of the minds or resolve differences or come to some sort of agreement on an issue but there's one he says we need somebody to stand between us and put their hands on us both to bring us together in reconciliation and that daysan is Christ this is the one that job knew he needed and in 1 Timothy chap 2 veres 5 and 6 it says for there's one God and one mediator between God and Men boy this will kind of get get some people choked up the man Christ Jesus yeah Read that read that and just make God one like your fingers one or the way the Pentecost does want to make them one not God's not three he's one there's one God and one mediator between God and man and Men the man Christ Jesus and this he says who gave himself Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified if IED in due time so this this Greek word mediator that's used here that root mesos it's one who's in between in the middle or as the Bible says in the midst in the middle of it's even used in the term midnight it's something that's in the middle of things he is the mediator between God and men and there's only one mediator between God and men and that's Christ he is the so mediator he's the daysan who can stand between two people stand between an Angry God and a Sinner and bring them together and reconcile them in Hebrews 7:22 by so much was Jesus made aurity of a better Testament just uses a little bit different language it's not necessarily an intercessor or a mediator but here it's aurity Christ is the Pledge or the guarantee that all elect will come into eternal life he will be there forever standing there as a mediator to bring every seed into relationship with God Amen because he has by the sacrifice of himself and the shedding of his blood once he's entered into heaven presented himself as a sacrifice and and in that there is no time that's an eternal thing so when a Believer accepts Christ and is identified with this sacrifice that's been met in Christ in the day when he appeared on the day of atonement in the throne room of God in heaven and he is our shity that's a sponsor it means it's under good security or a guarantee a bondsman I know none of us have any uh familiarity with what a bondsman would do but he is the one that gives us a full Assurance of redemption this is his uh this is his this is his position that he is assurity and I would say the New Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the guarantee of our faith the sealing of our faith in that guarantee in that shity so Christ is The Mercy Seat Christ is our mediator it's a special position that he has he is our intercessor and he is a Recon iler and this is the word of life this is the word it's uh we can see this image in the blood I've been studying the token sermon I really would encourage uh th those of us here and in our church to listen to one of the token sermons I've been listening to the one he preached in Jeffersonville September 1st 63 and and listen to it in light of these things we've been studying on mercy and what he's preaching there is what I'm trying to preach here trying to draw from those things to see when brother M's emphasizing the time that we're in when judgment's coming and there's only one place of safety under the blood and it it was the only place you could be saved was under the blood uh and he says to that today is the life that's the token now let's look at Christ and what we want to look at here is and just for we're not going to be lengthy this evening but I want to just look at Christ in this role as the mediator or The Mercy Seat even this voice of Mercy in the sermon the unveiling of God this is June 14th 1964 I would encourage this one to be one uh that you would listen to I've got a whole list of sermons uh that I've been putting together of kind of like a chronological listening uh list just to see these themes in great great detail in the message of the hour and we talk about uh the fullness of redemption and a and the interceding over ignorance that when the full word comes into manifestation and you have an absolute then God can't make an EXC excuse if the absolute's rejected so you could just begin with the absolute that brother Brandon preacher he just calls it uh absolute and then just start there and there's so many different sermons you can see where brother B I'm standing in the Gap why because he knows judgment's coming a and people aren't ready and he's preaching the flashing red lights of the signs of his coming he and he brings us right to the Third Exodus which is where we are in the token and then he preaches the indictment God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him and then Christ is the mystery of God revealed there's only one provided way God only have one provided Ed way H uh perfect Faith the token desperations Souls that are in prison now there's a man here who can turn on the light Shalom and those different messages that go with that theme and turn on the light then he preaches a trial he preaches it more than once and so you can see this theme of things unfolding through there and then he preaches and there's several other sermons mixed in here the unveiling of God and the unveiling of God is just before he preaches the presence of God unrecognized God has provided a lamb to the trumpets recognizing your day in its message The God Who is rich in Mercy these are all Talent this is a theme that brother Bram is laying out a beautiful picture that he's seeing and he's trying to minister to us and the the Mighty God unveiled before us or here the unveiling of God is such a tremendous sermon to really consider because it's these things he's preaching that summer that causes him to make statements of the next few months that c that make people think who what's going on and that's why you have four services on question and answers because of these things that he's preaching of course there's a lot of questions about what kind of pajamas should I wear and what honey should I use in my oatmeal but a lot of the questions revolved around things that he says in these sermons I don't think there's a question about honey in your oatmeal that was just me uh riffing a little bit but notice he says when that veil was rent on the day of crucifixion so you can just start thinking about this text that we've read um and we could have read in other places that at this critical moment there was an earthquake and the veil of the temple was written too and what did they say there's no Ark there's no blood on the The Mercy Seat this has all been a facade it's gone it's over but despite its limits and despite what was missing there was still Mercy up to that moment so he says when that veil was rent on the day of crucifixion the veil that was wrapped it was rent on the day of crucifixion the whole Mercy Seat came into view now the Jews could not understand how that God could have mercy upon a sinful foul people like we are that would be Gentiles but they couldn't see this one who is giving Mercy because he was hid he's hid but he's right there in plain view but they don't lack he's there for their eyes to see but they don't have that understanding he was behind the mercy seat on the inside with Badger skins hanging down covering him before if any man walked in behind that Veil it was sudden death he says we're going to get a lesson here in a minute if you can receive it to walk behind them skins even one of the priest son tried to do it one time and died don't go behind that Veil the man that walked behind why there was no Redemption yet in that right so you couldn't go through that curtain into the shikina glory and the life of that blood on the altar being that of a bull or a lamb or mingled blood or whatever it would have been that can't come back upon the believer uh and to protect them in that moment so you couldn't enter into the veil because there was no redemption in the shadow it was potentially it was just potential and anything potential is not the real thing yet just potentially it was Redemption sin covered not remitted remitted is divorced and put away and so the blood of sheep and goats could not do that so Jehovah was hid behind a veil now back behind this Veil where he was hid to enter into that a man dropped dead to try to enter into it I brother Brams In this passage we're just reading through it it's kind of repeating these things alternating them he says but since Pentecost since the crucifixion when that veil was rent from the top to the bottom for that generation now it's important to look at for that generation when this event happens Everything Changes it's a new dispensation that this is for them they could have said they could have stood there and said hey you were fine under bulls and goats you were fine under these you were fine under that but that's all been changed recently this is recently changed well when when Christ was crucified and you're a worship was exposed as bloodless Christ became the mercy seat so it says that veil was rent from top to bottom for that generation Jesus was that God veiled and when he died at Calvary God sent fire and lightning ripped that Veil from top to the bottom that the whole Mercy Seat was in plain view but they were too blind to see it as Paul said about reading of Moses when Moses is read yet that Veil is still on their heart I could listen for the statement oh brother sister that's what the Jews did when the veil was rent and brought God into Plain View hanging on the cross he was in plain view but they could not see it what was on the cross what was bleeding The Mercy Seat the perpetuation that lid that covers a a that symbol what was symbolized in the most holy place is now literally being fulfilled there on that rock or on that on that mountain on that cross there it is deity hung upon wood bleeding for us a mercy seat lifted up not between two cherabin but between two thieves what an image so as he's hanging there on the cross this is the mercy seek Christ Our mediator intercessor this reconciler this shity this is this a very uh simple lesson but it's it's tied to such deep things or critical things important things in the message of the hour so here in verse 33 these sayings upon the cross are very weighty and his words were very limited so Luke 23:33 and when they were com into the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the malifa these two thieves one on the right hand and the other on the left now we're going to read some things in verses 35 to 37 but this is what Jesus says in response to these events that are transpiring around them Father forgive them for they know not what they do here they've crucified him and this is what they're doing they parted his reignment and cash lots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided him the people the rulers are saying he saved others why can't he save himself let him save himself if he be Christ The Chosen of God they're mocking him and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the Jews save thyself and they made sure it was printed in all the tongues so everyone would know in this sarcastic mocking tone in verse 38 here he is King of the Jews so while all this is taking place below him at his feet there on the on Calvary that day Jesus intercedes for the ignorance of the people no matter how nasty it was no matter how cruel it was no how much they derided him and mocked him he said father forgive their ignorance now I'm not misreading that father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing forgive them for their ignorance while this is while he's in plain view this is while he's bleeding this is while his some of his last words before he can before he dies he has to still remain ever that lamb that intercessor or here this one who had intercede for ignorance and he's making intercession for the guilty primarily the ignorant and you can see why the Bible says in Acts 17:30 in the times of this ignorance God winked at because here they are mocking him deriding him crucifying him and Jesus doesn't say 10,000 angels come lightning lightning shuck and tore the veil of the temple Why didn't it just strike all those knuckleheads deriding him I mean is that what we would have done in that situation oh you don't think I'm the Christ the son of living God I'll show you right we would have had a lot of things we would have wanted to do but it says God winked at their ignorance the old Covenant winking even all through the Old Testament those things stood as a temporary atonement pointing to Christ who had come and redeem all the Seed of Abraham at this time of this ignorance God weak De Jesus even points to it in Mark chapter 3: 28 to 30 be sure I've got my right scripture here nobody else is turning in their Bibles I'm the only one flipping Pages here hope now all the dust so here he says verily I say unto you there's a lot here about a kingdom being divided against itself and how they were D they're calling him beel he's unclean and so he deals with uh how their statements are uh ridiculous because Satan's wouldn't be divided against himself he says verily I say unto you all sins shall be forgiven Unto the Sons of men in blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme now blasphemy that's that one of those heavy words right oh you blasphemed the Holy Ghost you're lost and if you blaspheming blaspheme is a pretty uh a pretty heavy weighty word and the blaspheming means to speak evil blashe means to slander to detract from something it's injured speech speech that inur injures and so I believe that would be slander lials in print slander in spoken is that right am I getting this right somebody ask a lawyer and so here there can be all sorts of blasphemies he says but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of Eternal damnation because they said he hath an unclean Spirit Jesus saying they all sins shall be forgiven under the sons of men and these blasphemies that they're speaking even about Jesus and it's a paradox even about Christ they can speak evil of they can say things that are inous that can detract from his reality who he really is they can water down the truth they can lie about the truth they can lie about Christ they can lie about um him even as he hangs upon the cross he says father forgive them for their ignorance they don't know what they're doing and God will forgive the sins of them even if it be blasphemy but to blaspheme the Holy Ghost they are in danger of Eternal damnation have NE never forgiveness now so that it puts us that there is something where you can cross the line then we have Paul in first Timothy 1113 he says of himself I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and injures but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief here's that theme where brother man said the Holy Ghost interceding over the ignorance of the people Christ that Son of God that role that he plays over the ignorance Paul himself is set forth as an example I believe first verse 15 tells us that that I was I I I'm an example of how someone could know everything about the law know everything about the one true God know everything about Christ and even the message and the word and still miss it and that God did that so that when the Revelation came when I received it there was a mercy for me though I blasphemed and persecuted and murdered and injured I did not face the Judgment of Eternal damnation because God forgave me I found forgiveness in Christ he says I obtained mercy so here's Christ hanging upon the cross The Mercy Seat in plain view it's life soon is going to be leaving him and he stands there bleeding with arms stretched wide saying father forgive them for their ignorance forgive them for even crucifying me hold that in your minds we'll come back to it here in a moment but verse 39 to verse 43 and one of the malifa which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us so he's he's joining in on the sarcasm and the snark I guess maybe sarcasm really Waters it down just the this nasty deriding and the other Thief hears it and says he rebukes this other malifa do you not fear God you are in the same condemnation you're hanging on the cross you're going to die and you're going to rebuke him he goes and we hang we're hanging there dying justly we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our Deeds he says but this man has done nothing wrong well here's he's recognizing something he's seeing through the lies he's seeing through the condemnation I mean do you realize just how easy it would be kind of like the guy guys's in prison and they says what are you in here for go oh well I didn't do it and everybody's like yeah yeah none of us did anything yeah we're all here cuz we're innocent and you could just imagine a thief hanging on the cross is like I know I'm guilty and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't just crucify an innocent guy he must have done something to deserve these nails and yet he sees through the lies he ceases the cobbling together of this detraction and he says Jesus unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom it's not just recognizing the innocent of a a citizen or one who's been false accused but Lord Master the king remember me you are King they can mock you they can deride you they can put all sorts of false inscriptions but here in with my last breath I want to declare that you are the king and when you come into your kingdom remember me amen and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise now I'm not trying to make a technical distinction but I would want you to recognize two different things that transpire very near each other in one instance he's interceding over the ignorance of the people that are crucifying him and now he's not just interceding but he's mediating and reconciling one who stands condemned and dying as a sinner and if he with that breath leaves in this moment he could face Eternal damnation but God there re honors the the sacrifice in Christ imparts eternal life to the thief dying on the cross I want you to really think think about that go listen to that day on Calvary really weigh what's happening with this Christ is dying on the cross he sees a bunch of people who are ignorant and hateful and spiteful and blaspheming he says father forgive them for they know not what they do Lord be merciful to them let it not be this blasphemy that would result in death and eternal damnation forgive them for they know not what they do and in the face of all that here's one who confesses them and he doesn't say well father forgive him for his ignorance he he doesn't want to do that he's not ignorant anymore but he asked for Mercy he asked for to be remembered Remember Me this is what job prayed oh that you would remember me in a time of judgment in the end hide me till your wrath be over paath past but then remember me today you'll be with me this is what the Throne of Mercy does it makes a way to life into life his brother B was saying a moment ago the old Covenant covered sins the New Covenant remits sins Christ is remitting the sins of the the thief on the cross this is exactly what's happening I realize there's this dispensation that's transpiring at this time where the I I know there's some that make the argument that the thief dying upon the cross invalidates the necessity to be baptized I think you got to be careful what kind of platitudes you you you make uh when you see this instance and so I'm not I'm not just being loose and playing loose with this I recognize there you don't want to go too far and make it out to be well all you got to do is just say Lord remember me don't need to be baptized does need you to be changed but it's here as an example showing it's the power of the one who is covered in the blood the one who had the blood of God this is uh the Son of God he says you will be with me in Paradise imp Parts life he remits this thief sins he pleads Christ in this singular moment he's pleading for mercy on the ignorant and grants life to that who's in the one who's enlightened the one who sees and remember in Acts chapter 17 verse 30 at the times of this ignorance God winked at what was the second part but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent so there's a winking at ignorance that works for a season but then there comes a time where it's not like you can say well I mean look he said father forgive them for they know not what they do so there's just this imp perpetuity of winking because you're ignorant and someone say well you know that this is right you know this is true yeah but you know what uh he Winks at our ignorance or I escaped this and he forgave me for that and there's this idea well this will just always remain but no he says now I'm commanding everywhere to everyone to repent so let's see how this works in Acts chapter 2 verses 36-39 thank you everyone for being wide awake tonight and amen and get behind the word God just made sure the people who showed up tonight were awake got their energy drinks in right before service everybody's be wired not be able to go to bed tonight I appreciate it acts 2: 36-39 therefore let all this is Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost one thing to think about which is remarkable is there already been a great deal of commotion and speaking in tongues and things happening right it's already been the spirit of God's poured out and they're they're starting to uh manifest in this excitement and this Zeal and it's kind of causing people to ask questions and then Peter preaches this sermon this inaugural sermon on the church the day that the church is born and he's he's preaching and this is one of his concluding statements or this is his concluding statement therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ guilty he has just indicted them for crucifying Jesus Christ it's already happened he's died he shed the blood he went to the Grave he rose he's ascended into heaven and now Peter says you've crucified him this Jesus whom you have crucified God has made him Lord and Christ and notice what happens now if we could just dramatize and speculate and you might say well let's just run the numbers ask chat GPT you know what's the probability that someone who was there that day on Calvary deriding Christ was there uh uh on the day of Pentecost there in Jerusalem and let's just uh think that maybe there's one guy who is there mocking Christ and there he stands in Acts chapter 2 hearing this and all of a sudden he realizes when he said father forgive them for they know not what they do that was me I crucified the Lord Of Glory I I have blood on my hands it says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart it said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do they knew they were guilty they didn't say wouldn't me and then Peter said unto them repent you say well how just just a little bit ago just there so many days ago what is it 50 days or whatever just just some time ago God was winking forgive them they don't know what they're doing and Peter doesn't repeat the Mantra he doesn't say oh uh listen while you had cruci while you were crucifying and why you were there mocking him and deriding him as he was hanging on the cross he said father forgive them for they don't know what they do so there's still Mercy for your ignorance he he's Still the Lamb on the throne he's still on The Mercy Seat today interceding for your ignorance he says repent it's exactly what he says repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins it's not the baptism that remits your sins but it's the repenting and believing in the shity and your faith in the shity that your sins have been remitted it's what the thief on the cross said he said oh we hang here justly he is innocent Lord God remember me King Jesus Remember me when you come into your kingdom says repent and for the remission of sins be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the Seal of your faith for the promises unto you and to your children and all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call the voice of Mercy is The Voice of Truth amen if Peter was to go back to Luke Chapter uh 23 and saywell father forgive them for they know not what they do it wouldn't have been it wouldn't have been timely right but he had to speak the truth and if you reject that there's nothing left but judgment so on the cross at that time he's hanging there this Mercy seat's hanging there there's forgiveness for ignorance for that generation but now it's either repentance or rejection now that they've heard the word and Peter says that one you crucified God has made him Lord in Christ and then the response is well what what can we do says you have to repent for doing it repent of your sins be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now I'm going to pick up in the unveiling of God the very same place we were just reading oh brother sister that's what the Jews did when the veil was rent and brought God into Plain View hanging on the cross he was in plain view but they couldn't see it everybody listening I speak too soon about sleeping could it be possible that the Gentiles have done the same thing when then now what could it be possible that the Gentiles he says has did the same thing could it be that the Gentiles are guilty of crucifying Jesus Christ and God has revealed him in plain view right he says oh God when they've had the church ages of the Son of God but when now Church ages of the Son of God here he is the Holy Ghost revealed himself as a Son of God through seven Church ages but in the end before he's son of David in the Millennium he reveals himself as what the son of men this is a judgment dispensation that comes Son of God through the church ages but then when denominations are rejected and God Christ is kicked out of the church and he stands on the outside of the seven Church ages right now there's a prophet standing there ministering an entrance into fellowship with Jesus Christ again because he can't be found in denominations this is his theme in the Feast of the trumpets and these different sermons he's preaching could it be possible they've done the same thing they've had the church ages of the Son of God but now the veil of denominations and things this veil of traditions that we've got since Pentecost when the church Traditions have been rent and there was even a continued veil of tradition since Pentecost you could say back at the beginning of church but even in Lea which represents Pentecost again the things that the people said days of Miracles has passed in these things God has taken the veil off of it and brought it in plain view and they're ready to crucified again just exactly like here it is in plain view just exactly what the Jews did to their Messiah he said it's happening today the same thing's happening today he said well that's wa we didn't see a physical Messiah you're saying brother brandham was that was it brother brandham is that who was no our mate is the revealed word the promises to the Jews are physical they were promised a physical Messiah the bride was promised the revelation of Jesus Christ revelation of who God is God cannot be seen with eyes God can only be touched and felt and known by his Divine communication which is revelation it's not in the flesh and so this is the moment that God has been building too to reveal himself who he is to a bride that will love him for who he is not the flesh not after the flesh so he says now he's being revealed and what are they doing they're crucifying him again now where my real wrestling's today and I think I took paid a real price just in my spirit trying to find uh which direction to go at this moment and I I want to read a statement from the indictment and we probably cut this a little bit short there's a lot a lot here for you to chew on but in the indictment if you follow the trajectory of some of these sermons we've read this is July 7th 1963 and he's preaching the indictment so all these things should just start kind of wow I mean we're like we're just tracking these things that he's preaching there uh at the at in Jeffersonville even say he's preached the Third Exodus now he's preaching the indictment why because it's the Third Exodus judgment striking and he says what are you going to do about it stay out there in your Creeds stay out there in your dogmas and die you are guilty with Wicked hands you've taken the Prince of Life The Word of Life and crucified it to the people now what did they do now this is days of Christ he's saying today what are you going to do about it you're going to stay in denominations they're guilty of crucifying them if I could put it in the words of Peter this message what you have crucified is Jesus Christ and the answer should be well then what should we do what do we need to do well then he preaches the token says why this is the sermon that needed to follow the seals why because this is what you need to avoid it the Judgment he says now what did they do they didn't know it today men walk ignorantly they don't know that's the truth they think it's some kind of ism they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough they just lightly take it oh well I believe there's a God sure now go listen to the Token brother BR brings it right down to us message believers who will agree with everything the prophet says say what the tape say believe believe the prophet brother man goes into great detail about how much you could follow the messenger how much you could believe in the prophet how much you could believe the message and believe the message and you know what it's almost as if he knows where we're going to be in this end time and he says a lot about take boys and we're like yeah in your house I don't have to go to church anymore and he says you can do all that but if you don't get under the token he says you don't call upon God enough you don't like you just lightly take it oh I believe I believe he said well there I believe there's a God sure the devil believes the same thing the devil believes it more than some people claim to believe it the devil believes it and trembles people just believe it and go on but the devil trembles knowing his judgment is coming I I realized Maybe now it's not uh I'm trying to remember just maybe it's in the uh in the token brother says Luther knew it was coming Wesley knew it was coming they all knew something was coming here people they know judgment is coming and people believe it and don't pay no attention the judgment is coming guilty of crucifying him sure I indict this generation and then I love finding them guilty wait what happened to my trial he indicts him and finds them guilty I indict this generation finding them Guilty by the same word that found them guilty at the beginning that's right Jesus said who can condemn me he was the word made flesh and today the same word is made flesh go listen to the trial God told me that 33 years ago it's fulfilled right here this afternoon God keeps his word he's the same yesterday today and forever what is the very Christ that he was sent to point to they've crucified him and these are some statements he says after this he says we can't do nothing else but head for judgment we're already there we're already there to judgment that's why he can indict them and find them guilty don't have to do any kind of Discovery can't do any kind of pre-trial motions no jury selection why because in the token he says the very judge became our Advocate our attorney and so having been rejected God said would you like me to appoint counsel for you I don't need a counsel he's like all right fine I won't represent you I find you guilty he says therefore the time for repentance for nation is a nation is gone I believe that this nation can never be great again no he says I believe that this nation cannot repent you all are thinking how do we miss that like I believe that this nation cannot repent I believe it's cross the line between mercy and judgment I believe she's toddling in the balance he says if this generation has rejected the same Mercy that was spurned in them days God would be unjust to let them get by without judgment judgment judgment judgment judgment and so then he comes to the end he's praying listen to the prayer he prays in this and he's like I plead for Mercy for the people and he starts pleading for God's mercy the souls that are in prison now what is he saying God please don't let it be too late he's looking at these events and he's seeing the type in the day of the Christ first pull second pull third pull he's seeing him being rejected and crucified he sees that he's amongst the people for a period of time that he ascends into heaven and the day of Pentecost it was repent repent repent Jesus sees this pattern unfolding and he's thinking oh God forgive them for they don't know what they're doing oh what where where are we living could the door be shut really soon so why is he saying Lord forgive them people walk ignorantly he's saying please forgive him God have mercy because ignorance would no longer be an excuse he was changing from father forgive them for they know not what they do father forgive them for their ignorance too repent now when I I'd like to see this go look into what the Greater Works are a part of that Greater Works that the bride's supposed to be doing that the Christ body is supposed to be doing at a time where it looks as if judgment is absolutely certain will there be a voice on Earth that says Lord forgive them and not just I mean I think today this kind of idea of apply the token to your family is merely covering right I'm just going to hide the fact that my children have rejected the message of the hour and I'm just going to apply the token on them and we won't even go to church we want to offend them you know we'll just pret we just believe and apply the token and it's so far from what the applying the token means so far from what Mercy is I don't know why I haven't been able to get to it but I've had this just some scriptures together showing that Mercy is not a pushover Mercy is not being willfully ignorant about the ignorance of the people Mercy is calling exactly for what it is and saying they're ignorant and they're facing Eternal damnation father just forgive them and that Mercy as it moves would say do you realize you need God's help you need God's grace and so here we are he says could it be that the Gentiles have done the same thing that they're so blind miserable and wretched that they don't realize they're rejecting Christ they don't realize here they are religious have need of nothing and don't realize Christ isn't with them anymore that their worship has been exposed as less bloodless christless s zi says they'll go on thinking they're going on worshiping Satan thinking they're worshiping God why because Christ isn't in that anymore he that one time that was okay at one time that was fine and he might have received worship through that because he's winking there's a H an interceder I think we'll get into this sometime soon is an interceder means he'll hit the mark when you can't so it's like making up the difference make up the difference finally gets to that PL place where there's no more Shadow it's like I can't make up any more difference you've got to come to me so here we are in the Le Dean age and when he calls him out for being blind and miserable and wretched and he's been rejected what does he say in verse 19 Revelations 3:19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be jealous therefore and repent the Zeal of this age is to repent there has to be repentance why is it all of a sudden be zealous therefore and repent why are they called to repent now because the times of ignorance are over right there's no partial anymore so it says you have to repent men and Brethren you're guilty of crucifying the Lord Of Glory well what can we do repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and here at the end time he says as many as I love I rebuke and Chase I'm counseling you I'm telling you this is what you need to do be zealous therefore and repent and here's our here's our repentance behold I stand at the door and knock If any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me am the supping is that communion the speaking amen he's interceded through the church ages as a lamb the token brother bam saying I know I'm maybe giving some things away here and maybe not getting into much detail but in the the token he's saying it was the lamb in Luther it was the lamb in Wesley was always the lamb but now he's saying we've entered he's using it as a type now we've entered a time a moment in the evening time the death Angels passing and the lamb which has been kept you must have the life he's interceded through the church ages brother brand I'm saying but when the veil is broke the veil is rent and everything things exposed now if I could use it in the image of the Cross and I I say this very very carefully father forgive them for they know not what they do he's interceding over ignorance this day you'll be with me in Paradise he's reconciling for Redemption he's not just saying forgive them for they don't know what they do but now in this moment he's bringing them together he's reconciling for Redemption Brothers come to your instruments let me close with this statement in the unveiling of God the whole Mercy Seat is setting in plain view anybody can see it the veil is rent glory to God the whole Mercy Seat comes into Plain View how God could have mercy on foul Sinners as us when he hid himself was a mystery and now it is in plain view or in full view revealed by his word it's always the word constantly that is God it's the word that opens up it's those people who have know the word of God that day when Jesus died they would have seen The Mercy Seat they would have seen who he was there's that in the indictment that day this day these things that have just been recently as he would say there in 63 The Mercy Seat today is in plain view he says well in full view man I see it plainly but in full view it's the word of God The Mercy Seat if they would have only recognized him in that day so he says it was Jesus hanging on the cross The Mercy Seat and what was it the people were too blind to see it unless you think was common a moment ago could it be is it possible that the Gentiles had done the same thing if you thought that was just an outlier or a mistake in the transcription now it's repeated again their Traditions how then on the day of Pentecost the word came was in the form of the Son of God and they begin to organize it at NAA the first thing they went to the Methodist Baptists Presbyterians Pentecostals and so forth It's organized tradition till a man don't know where he stands but glory to God he promised in the last days that he would do it he would show his word in plain view open before us again open it up they only had know the word they know who Jesus was if a man only knew the word of God he'd know the hour we're living in and what's going on has it happened then it's happening today they just refused to listen to that word their Traditions what caused those Jews to see that they look like they could have actually seen because the thing was tore open you'd think they would see it you would think that as maybe they those who are there on the leaders that day who crucify them and these strange events start happening they go home and they run into one of their priest buddies and says you won't believe what happened at the temple today at such and such hour the Earth Shook and lightning struck and the veil was rent from bottom to the top completely open and it exposed now everyone knows there's nothing there and you think say when was that and you think their mind would start saying wait there's the there's an innocent one hanging on the cross who pla to be the Son of God there's deity nailed to Wood here's the blood is bleeding this is the day uh this is the Feast of the Passover all these things are happening you'd think that a moment at this moment maybe someone say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute what's H what's happening what in the world is happening what's this surely this was the son of God he says but it was tore open for a purpose what did he say in the breach because he wants to gather his bride to his side it's the revealing of that Mercy Seat we're drawn to that it's the revealing of Christ we're drawn to that so it has a purpose the purpose is redemption the fullness of [Music] redemption and I believe that we can be a voice in this hour to say father forgive them for they don't know they're doing that there could be by God's grace repentance the voice of Mercy will find the righteous believe it's in the token says it'll find them it'll get there somehow it'll find it'll find the seed but it's going to have to take a voice as Peter stood there on the day of Pentecost and said men and Brethren you've crucified the Lord Of Glory there's got to be a voice that could tell the people what they do yes and if I believe as myself personally I believe that the mer Mercy is in the bride that there's been a transition from Christ the son of God as an interceder through the church ages but now we've entered in this different dispensation and say well Christ there's still Mercy there's still Mercy available and I say that the bride is that way or that place or that voice of Mercy I'm not saying the Bride Can Shed her blood for anyone's sins I don't think anyone needs to put their hands on the bride and and identify themselves with the bride or they've got to believe in the bride's blood no but she's dressed in the bleeding word in type in symbol she's dressed in the bleeding word in other words she is a representative I had it in my notes and I I guess I just took it out when Paul said we've been given the ministry reconciliation maybe I'll pick up on that on Sunday morning we've been given that word reconciliation means it's been translated to atonement we have the ministry of atonement because we are the voice of the bleeding word we are the final voice to the final age and oh that God go and look into it I'll just kind of give give my thunder away brother bam says we have power to remit sins we've got power to impart eternal life and you that there has to be Mercy there has to be Mercy in us today let me be merciful oh God if it means I have to start with myself and not be so hard on myself and know that I know that I know that I've obtained his mercy and have receive Mercy I can give Mercy oh God help me to do it let's stand and pray tonight
