[0:00] Romans chapter 1 vers 18 to
[0:03] 2 and I'm going to be focusing
[0:06] specifically on verse 25 but this will
[0:08] give us a little bit of the background
[0:10] for this Romans chapter
[0:13] 1 verse 18 for the wrath of God is
[0:16] revealed from Heaven against all
[0:19] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[0:22] who hold the truth in
[0:25] unrighteousness because that which may
[0:27] be known of God is Manifest in them for
[0:30] God hath shown it showed it unto them
[0:33] for the invisible things of him from the
[0:34] creation of the world are clearly seen
[0:36] being understood by the things that are
[0:38] made even even his eternal power in
[0:41] Godhead so that they are without excuse
[0:44] because that when they knew God they
[0:47] glorified him not as God neither were
[0:50] thankful but became vain in their
[0:51] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[0:54] darkened professing themselves to be
[0:56] wise they became fools and changed the
[0:59] glory of the uncorruptible god into an
[1:01] image made like to corruptible man and
[1:03] to birds and a four-footed beast and
[1:05] creeping things wherefore God also gave
[1:08] them up to uncleanness through the lust
[1:10] of their own Hearts to dishonor their
[1:11] own bodies between themselves who
[1:14] changed the truth of God into a lie
[1:18] worshiped and served the creature more
[1:19] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[1:23] amen amen you can have your
[1:26] seats you can see uh from my title Slide
[1:29] the title of my sermon today pseudo
[1:32] christs and I'm not capitalizing either
[1:35] word there I wouldn't want there to be
[1:36] any confusion as to the legitimacy of a
[1:39] false Christ if you uh want to dig into
[1:43] some places in the message where or a
[1:44] place in the message where this thought
[1:46] is explored in much greater detail
[1:49] anointed ones at the end time would be
[1:51] something that would be very on point
[1:53] for this but we're going to use this
[1:54] title pseudo Christ on Wednesday night
[1:57] we were wrapping up a thought on how
[1:59] unbelief is anti-faith and using that
[2:01] thought that sin is mistrust or doubt in
[2:05] God and it's not just those attributes
[2:07] of sin where we see somebody doing
[2:08] something that might be ungodly we say
[2:10] that's sin that's sin we know that at
[2:12] the root of it is mistrust in God or
[2:15] doubt and so sin is unbelief unbelief is
[2:18] against or anti-faith and to be
[2:21] anti-faith or to doubt or to fear that's
[2:23] the product of Satan's system if he has
[2:26] a something that's working and something
[2:28] that's moving the product is death out
[2:30] and he he will always work he's always
[2:33] laboring he walketh about seeking whom
[2:35] he may devour he's always looking to
[2:37] erode our confidence in God and His word
[2:40] if you can just get us to question his
[2:41] character even to the point where you
[2:43] say well that's true but I just don't
[2:45] think God knows what he's doing or I
[2:46] don't like the way God does it if he
[2:48] could just cause you to put a question
[2:49] mark on the word or on God's character
[2:52] then it will that's Satan's objective
[2:55] and I would even go so far as to say
[2:57] that doubt or mistrust in God's word is
[2:59] is one of the consequences for those of
[3:01] us who abuse the world so the overuse of
[3:04] the world and too much interaction with
[3:06] the world uh doesn't feed our faith but
[3:09] feeds our flesh and therefore in the
[3:10] weakness of our uh spirits and the
[3:12] weakness of the inner man we can begin
[3:15] to doubt or lose confidence in God so
[3:17] Satan's working to do it and sometimes
[3:18] we can do it to ourselves now on this
[3:21] title pseudo Christ like is I mentioned
[3:24] anointed ones at the end time we could
[3:26] put it this way that there's many that
[3:27] will profess uh Christ
[3:30] and profess to be Christians or to
[3:32] Believe In Christ but in fact are
[3:34] influenced by the Antichrist or they're
[3:36] driven by anti-faith
[3:38] and the what I what I'm speaking who I'm
[3:41] speaking to today is very clearly the
[3:43] bride I almost titled this pseudo Brides
[3:45] but I wanted to use pseudo Christ so I'm
[3:47] not I'm not taking this as an
[3:49] opportunity to really needle the a
[3:52] pseudo Christ or the Antichrist or to
[3:55] Target uh you know some group but I'm
[3:57] speaking in a way that's to encourage
[3:59] the Bride of Jesus Christ and anything
[4:02] that is a pseudo Christ as we're using
[4:04] that phrase and we'll substantiate it
[4:05] here through the scripture really at the
[4:07] end serves to distract the true bride or
[4:11] tries to at least deceive the believer
[4:14] now if you look at verse 25 of where we
[4:15] just were in Romans chapter
[4:19] 1 it says who changed the truth of God
[4:22] into a lie and worshiped and served the
[4:25] creature more than the Creator who was
[4:27] blessed forever amen
[4:30] now it's talking about those that hold
[4:32] the truth and unrighteousness and really
[4:34] speaking to humanity and Mankind it's
[4:37] not that we're specific names mentioned
[4:39] here but this is all of us collectively
[4:41] as humankind have been guilty of doing
[4:44] this in our societies and through
[4:45] history it says they changed the truth
[4:47] of God into a lie and I want to focus to
[4:50] on this middle phrase just for a moment
[4:52] and worshiped and serve the creature
[4:54] more than the Creator so their worship
[4:57] and service those two things together
[4:59] they were Incorrect and they were taking
[5:03] the creation obviously out of context
[5:05] because it says they were worshiping the
[5:07] creation or that which was created the
[5:09] creature more than the Creator and by
[5:13] with their service and their worship
[5:15] being Incorrect and they're worshiping
[5:16] the creation they've taken creation
[5:18] outside of the plan of God they don't
[5:20] recognize that uh God they may say well
[5:23] God put this here and God created it but
[5:25] they begin to worship it and it's
[5:27] separated from the plan of God and being
[5:29] separated from the plan of God they
[5:31] there's no there's no glory to God in
[5:33] their service uh there's no worshiping
[5:36] of God in their worship and so they
[5:38] worshiped and served what God had made
[5:40] or what he had created what he had
[5:42] brought forth by his word and not the
[5:44] God who created it so you see that
[5:47] separation uh that they begin to do is
[5:49] they're honoring or venerating or giving
[5:52] uh glory to the creation but it's
[5:54] separate from God and once they've once
[5:58] they've changed and separated God or
[6:01] take separated that God out of the
[6:03] creation and that separation from the
[6:05] context of it God the creator of it God
[6:07] in the process of doing it uh it changes
[6:11] their worship it changes their service
[6:13] I'm going to give service to I'm going
[6:15] to do something we could say that uh as
[6:17] Believers and as Christians we should
[6:19] have a we should be conscious of how
[6:20] we're using the Earth's resources and
[6:23] that there's a certain
[6:24] conservationist uh in US as Believers
[6:27] that we want to take care of the
[6:28] environment we want to do things right
[6:30] but if you separate the context of God
[6:32] being the creator of all of it it
[6:33] there's really no service that's being
[6:35] done to God or any value to the creation
[6:39] and once we've been once Satan is able
[6:41] to and this is drawing from where we
[6:42] were last Sunday to kind of question
[6:44] God's character or separate God from
[6:46] something to allow us in ourselves to
[6:49] take
[6:50] shortcuts and in doing so maybe model an
[6:52] idea maybe manufacture something or
[6:54] pretend without being
[6:56] genuine some of these are just
[6:58] foundational things I like to share in
[7:00] this that this worship and service to
[7:02] the creature more than the Creator if we
[7:04] can do that it'll get it'll allow us to
[7:07] model something but not be genuine about
[7:10] it so it says that they changed now if
[7:12] you could just look at this first part
[7:14] here they changed the truth of God that
[7:16] means to change it means to exchange one
[7:18] thing for another it means to transform
[7:20] so it's a cause to take the form of it's
[7:23] a very interesting phrase they change
[7:25] the truth Althea of God which is truth
[7:28] into aive and that word there is
[7:31] pseudos so they change the word word of
[7:34] God into pseudos which is a conscious
[7:36] intentional
[7:38] falsehood whatever or whichever that is
[7:41] not what it seems to be it's a change
[7:45] into another form into a form that it
[7:46] actually isn't and in doing so it's
[7:49] perverted or
[7:50] deceitful and those are the things we
[7:52] identified as
[7:56] Abomination so this Greek word pseudo
[7:59] it's a word that we're we're familiar
[8:00] with in terms of something that is a
[8:02] pseudo have you ever heard it as a noun
[8:04] I'm not sure if you have maybe we're
[8:05] used to hearing it as pseudo as a word
[8:07] forming element that kind of points to
[8:10] something that is false or that's only
[8:12] in appearance only and it's not to
[8:15] deceive or to cheat or to an untruth but
[8:18] a pseudo is a false or spirous thing
[8:22] especially a person falsely claiming
[8:24] Divine Authority that's its original
[8:27] meaning
[8:30] I think you're probably all jealous of
[8:31] my cup now I am drinking hot tea because
[8:34] my allergies have gotten my throat
[8:35] feeling
[8:36] funny relax if it's co we're all immune
[8:39] by
[8:41] now but to be a pseudo is something that
[8:43] is false and that was used originally
[8:46] because it's scriptural meaning of one
[8:48] that is turning the truth of God into a
[8:50] pseudo it has to do with one who claims
[8:53] to be divine Authority but falsely so in
[8:56] our modern parlament that what we would
[8:58] probably say is something that is
[9:00] imitated or exaggerated something that
[9:03] is pretentious or insincere so that's
[9:05] what I'm looking at in terms of a pseudo
[9:07] Christ what they've done here is they
[9:09] have transformed the truth into a
[9:12] falsehood they change changed the truth
[9:14] into a lie now maybe to help you
[9:17] understand what's being presented here
[9:19] is they make a lie or falsehood appear
[9:22] as
[9:22] truth so you can't if you have the truth
[9:26] truth is immutable it's especially as it
[9:28] relates to God in his word and his
[9:30] character you can't change truth so what
[9:32] do you do you take a lie and you make it
[9:34] look like truth I remember brother John
[9:36] La Fontaine telling a story many years
[9:38] ago of how uh truth was uh walking into
[9:42] a city and saw a nice little place to
[9:44] swim and so he took his clothes off and
[9:46] went for a swim and as he was swimming a
[9:49] lie came by and put on truth's clothes
[9:51] and went into the city so he says a lie
[9:54] is uh has truth's cloth on but in the
[9:56] heart in the end it is a lie
[10:00] now if you'd look at John chap 14 verse
[10:02] verse 6 for me and then Mark 13:22 those
[10:06] two places I want to go to see this
[10:07] phrase pseudo
[10:13] Christ let's first begin here in John
[10:15] 14:6 how they make a lie appears truth
[10:19] Jesus says unto them I am the way the
[10:21] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[10:24] the father but by me so when they turn
[10:26] the truth into a lie they've taken
[10:28] Christ and they've they've falsified
[10:31] something and presented it as Christ
[10:34] they've taken a lie and said this is the
[10:36] truth that's where you get the pseudo
[10:38] from I am the way the truth and the life
[10:41] they've changed the truth of Christ the
[10:43] reality of Christ and they've and they
[10:46] have cast that aside and taken a lie and
[10:50] present that as truth or as Christ in
[10:53] Mark chap 13: 22 it says for false
[10:57] Christ and false prophets this word in
[11:00] the original is the pseudo Christ pseudo
[11:03] Christos pseudos Christos for there
[11:05] shall be false Christ and false prophets
[11:07] that will arise and shall so show signs
[11:10] and wonders to seduce if it were
[11:12] possible even the elect so where I'm
[11:15] drawing this idea of pseudo Christ from
[11:17] they're not really Christ they pretend
[11:19] to be Christ they're not really truth
[11:21] they just purport to be truth but in the
[11:23] heart at their core they are a mistruth
[11:25] or a lie it says pseudo profits they act
[11:28] as divinely inspired prophets they utter
[11:30] falsehoods under the name and the
[11:32] pretense of being divinely inspired so
[11:36] it's not just false Christ but it's
[11:38] false prophets these pseudo prophets
[11:40] pseudo Christ they purport to be
[11:42] something and notice they purport to be
[11:44] anointed or Christ or they purport to be
[11:47] prophets and they do it as a means of
[11:48] seducing another into unbelief false
[11:52] Christ and false prophets will do things
[11:54] and purport to be something in order to
[11:57] seduce that's what a pseudo does they
[11:59] purport to be something that they're not
[12:02] in 2 Corinthians 11: 3 and 4 but I fear
[12:05] lest by any means as the serpent begil
[12:07] Eve through his subtlety so your mind
[12:09] should be corrupted from the Simplicity
[12:12] that is in Christ for he that cometh
[12:14] preacheth another Jesus what would it be
[12:17] a pseudo Christ if they preach another
[12:20] Jesus whom we have not preached or if
[12:21] you receive another Spirit which you
[12:23] have not received or another gospel
[12:24] which you have not accepted you might
[12:26] well bear with him what is the what is
[12:29] this pseudo Christ it's another Jesus
[12:32] and he's not saying that they preach
[12:34] another Jesus in the sense that they say
[12:35] oh I know this Jesus is really cool but
[12:37] you should meet the Jesus from Syria no
[12:39] they will purport to be preaching Christ
[12:42] and because it changes Christ it is a
[12:45] so-called another Christ another Jesus
[12:48] and it's done to corrupt or what It
[12:50] ultimately does is it corrupts our faith
[12:52] in the word of
[12:54] God and this is what we could parallel
[12:57] to what happened in the beginning
[13:00] he's saying that what he is concerned
[13:02] about is that as the serpent beguiled
[13:04] Eve and just subtly corrupted her faith
[13:07] that another Jesus we might be patient
[13:09] with it and bear with it and it has this
[13:11] ability to corrupt our own faith
[13:14] Galatians chap 1: 6 and 7 I Marvel that
[13:17] you are so soon removed from him that
[13:19] called you into the grace of Christ unto
[13:22] another gospel we could say another
[13:25] Jesus another gospel but here he says
[13:27] which is not another other words because
[13:29] there is no other gospel there is no
[13:30] other Christ another Jesus is not really
[13:33] another Jesus it's something false per
[13:36] purporting to be Jesus which is not
[13:39] another but there's be some that trouble
[13:41] you and would pervert turn
[13:44] around change the gospel of Christ and
[13:47] he says they'll trouble you which means
[13:48] to agitate you to take away the calmness
[13:51] of mind to cause this inner
[13:53] turmoil it make you feel anxious or
[13:55] strike you with
[13:57] fear so they want to throw the gospel
[14:00] into a different
[14:01] form they want to Fashion it in in a
[14:04] shape that it's actually
[14:06] not and to adulterate the word of God by
[14:09] mixing it here Paul specifically talking
[14:11] about mixing it with works of the law so
[14:13] it changes the nature and composition of
[14:15] the word it changes the nature and
[14:16] composition of Christ let's pull from
[14:18] here and pull from here and it forms
[14:20] something that in itself he says will
[14:22] trouble you and cause you turmoil and C
[14:24] cause you
[14:26] anxiety the way that it says it here
[14:29] that he'll come in a very subtle way and
[14:33] he's concerned that if you will
[14:35] entertain another
[14:38] Christ it'll trouble
[14:40] you if you'll give it room if you'll
[14:42] give it space to work if you'll if
[14:44] you'll ponder it if you'll believe its
[14:47] lies if you allow something to throw the
[14:50] gospel into or paint the gospel in a
[14:52] different picture by mixing things in it
[14:57] it takes away your inner peace Amen in 2
[15:00] Corinthians 11: 1314 and 15 for such are
[15:05] false Apostles deceitful workers I want
[15:07] you to focus in on that phrase deceitful
[15:09] workers and as deceitful workers they
[15:12] transformed themselves into the Apostles
[15:14] of Christ these would be pseudo Apostles
[15:17] because they're deceitful workers they
[15:19] couldn't be true Apostles and being
[15:21] deceitful workers uh they are working in
[15:24] a a way to present themselves as one way
[15:27] here they transform themselves they turn
[15:30] themselves into the form of an apostle
[15:31] of Christ then he inserts this in verse
[15:34] 14 and don't Marvel at this because
[15:36] Satan himself transforms himself into an
[15:38] angel of Light he presents himself as
[15:41] light he presents himself as truth he
[15:43] presents himself as one that has
[15:45] understanding yeah hath God not said and
[15:47] this is why he said it and this is the
[15:48] reason behind it therefore it is no
[15:51] great thing if his ministers also be
[15:53] transformed as the Ministers of
[15:55] righteousness whose ends shall be
[15:57] according to their Works deceit F
[16:00] Works their end is going to be according
[16:02] to what they do now this puts a false
[16:05] anointed one or even a sudo Christ into
[16:08] a very alarming category that they're
[16:11] not going to appear as Angels of
[16:13] Darkness but they'll appear as angels of
[16:14] light they transform themselves into
[16:17] Apostles so there's pseudo Christ pseudo
[16:19] Apostles pseudo prophets who will
[16:23] present truth in a certain way and
[16:25] present themselves in a particular way
[16:27] all for the purpose of dis
[16:29] seat and these pseudo
[16:33] christs if you'll look at 1 John chapter
[16:35] 3 I I I really want to be able to nail
[16:38] this down through the scripture before
[16:40] we go further but pseudo Christ are not
[16:43] where we're wanting to zero end on this
[16:45] and remember I'm speaking to the bride
[16:46] of Christ I'm not trying to call you out
[16:49] as being a pseudo Christ that's not my
[16:50] goal today at all I don't believe I'm
[16:52] doing that but pseudo Christ are not in
[16:54] the world but they try to get as Clos to
[16:56] the word as they can
[16:59] pseudo Christ if I could put it this way
[17:01] this is uh at the core here and I'm
[17:03] going to use Cain and you're already
[17:04] picking up on some of these things here
[17:05] as you look at this but pseudo Christ I
[17:08] want to ident where you'll find them and
[17:09] what they're identified as are
[17:11] unbelievers pretending to be Believers
[17:14] so we're going to draw a little bit from
[17:15] Brother bram's teaching on three kinds
[17:17] of Believers so they pretend as
[17:20] deceitful workers they pretend for the
[17:22] purpose of destroying faith faith or
[17:24] causing the believer to
[17:26] stumble so a believer
[17:29] is impersonated by the unbeliever are
[17:32] you following me now pseudo Christ or
[17:35] pseudo bride or anything pseudo or fake
[17:37] or false or something purporting to be
[17:40] something that's not or impersonating
[17:41] something a True Believer you have a
[17:43] True Believer but when that believer is
[17:45] impersonated by an unbeliever it creates
[17:47] a hybrid called a makeb
[17:50] Believer so we say there's three
[17:52] categories of people there's the
[17:53] believer and there's unbeliever and we
[17:56] would put those in categories because we
[17:57] feel that we could identify them one
[17:59] that rejects the word of God outright
[18:01] another one that claims to believe the
[18:03] word outright but if you take an
[18:04] unbeliever who tries to be a believer he
[18:07] produces this middle category of a mate
[18:09] believer where he has hybrid the True
[18:12] Believer by joining it to an unbelieving
[18:14] heart and here we see in 1 John chapter
[18:17] 3 Cain was a make believer not as Cain
[18:22] verses 12 and 13 not as Cain who is of
[18:24] that Wicked one he himself was a hybrid
[18:27] and slew his brother and where slew he
[18:29] him why did he slay him because his own
[18:31] Works were evil and his brother's
[18:33] righteous so he says Marvel not my
[18:35] brethren if the world hate you Cain was
[18:38] a hybrid between the woman and a serpent
[18:41] and in being a hybrid between the woman
[18:44] and the serpent he is now bred between
[18:48] what should have been the pure and
[18:50] something else he is a make believer
[18:54] when Cain brought forth of the fruit of
[18:56] the ground he worshiped and served
[18:57] without faith he did not have a
[18:59] revelation of God's will so when he
[19:02] worshiped he didn't worship as an
[19:03] unbeliever but yet he didn't worship as
[19:06] a True Believer when presented with an
[19:07] opportunity to worship correctly he
[19:09] resisted it so what was he he was a
[19:12] makeb Believer so a make believer or the
[19:15] make believer is a unbeliever that
[19:17] masquerades as a Believer and you'll
[19:19] find them among other
[19:23] believers a wolf in sheep's clothing
[19:25] among other wolves is just inviting an
[19:28] attack
[19:30] and so the make believer is an
[19:31] unbeliever who's paraded himself as a
[19:33] Believer among other believers Judas is
[19:37] another one that is identified in the
[19:38] word of God as a make believer again not
[19:41] one that outright rejects the word of
[19:43] God but one that is a hybrid in Mark
[19:46] chap 14: 18 Jesus sitting down uh there
[19:50] here at one of his last meals with the
[19:51] disciples and they sat and did eat Jesus
[19:53] said verily I say unto you one of you
[19:55] which eateth with me shall betray me' so
[19:59] it was one that was at the
[20:01] table Judas was not uh in the halls of
[20:04] another Court he was not in the
[20:06] government of Rome he was not even
[20:08] within the Pharisees or the Sadducees he
[20:10] was one that sat amongst them as a
[20:13] disciple Jesus said in John chap 6: 70
[20:16] and 71 have not I chosen you and one of
[20:19] you is a devil well that's putting it in
[20:22] plain
[20:23] language and though this is early on in
[20:25] the writing of John John gives us tells
[20:27] us who it is he spake of Judas the scary
[20:29] the son of Simon for he is not for he it
[20:32] was that should betray him being one of
[20:34] the 12 I love how John never really
[20:36] calls himself out but he's always quick
[20:38] to name other people Peter gets it Judas
[20:41] gets it but John is just the one that
[20:42] Jesus loved and you just have to guess I
[20:45] wonder who he's talking
[20:46] about have I not chosen you but one is a
[20:49] devil and it is Jesus who was one of the
[20:52] twel so notice how close this comes that
[20:55] whenever in the very beginning when a
[20:57] man and a woman have children but one is
[20:59] born of The Serpent and born by the will
[21:01] of Satan it's not something from the
[21:04] outside that attacked but it was
[21:06] something from the family within and
[21:08] here you have a a spirit or you have one
[21:10] who is betraying and he is one of the 12
[21:15] there's a lot of things brother brah
[21:16] says about Cain and Abel and Judas and
[21:18] Jesus they're Brothers in the same
[21:19] church and I'm not saying this to cause
[21:22] us to try to figure out who in the
[21:23] church directory is a Judas and who's a
[21:25] make believer and wondering if there's
[21:26] ever going to be another tab where it
[21:27] says families birthdays and make
[21:29] Believers and and if you ever if you get
[21:32] on probation you're put into this
[21:33] category and there's an asterisk or your
[21:35] name why is my name a different color
[21:37] well we're trying to figure out whether
[21:39] or not you're a genuine
[21:42] believer but he said that in the seat of
[21:44] discrepancy the enemy joins church and
[21:46] becomes very Orthodox in a Creed or
[21:49] something it's the enemy who will join
[21:52] and become very Orthodox but that's
[21:54] discrepancy anything that interferes
[21:56] with that strain of the genuine truth of
[21:58] God's word the make believer is a hybrid
[22:01] believer with the fake faith and he can
[22:03] be very adamant about certain things but
[22:05] notice how he says that this enemy will
[22:07] join church and then interfere with that
[22:10] strain of genuine truth of God's word
[22:13] this is the goal of a hybrid is to
[22:16] interfere with the genuine anything that
[22:19] is mixed or anything that is solidated
[22:22] the purpose is to take away that which
[22:23] is pure and to confuse it or to to
[22:26] degrade it Judas was there there as one
[22:29] of the 12 this is the effect of this
[22:32] make believer John 13:2 and supper being
[22:36] ended the devil having now put in the
[22:37] heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to
[22:39] betray him he's now influenced by the
[22:44] devil when we Are Born Again by the word
[22:47] of God and we have his Spirit dwelling
[22:49] in us we can be influenced driven to do
[22:52] minor things that we don't want to do we
[22:54] can make mistakes but when we make those
[22:56] mistakes we repent amen
[22:59] but here one who has a is a make
[23:01] believer can be driven to actually
[23:04] betray
[23:05] truth we can make mistakes but we or a
[23:09] mistake wouldn't be saying well I don't
[23:10] believe there's anything such thing as
[23:11] God and just going ahead and living that
[23:13] way and then well I'm sorry I I made a
[23:16] mistake I should have never done that
[23:18] we're talking about one that is going to
[23:20] oppose truth interfere with the strain
[23:23] of the truth of God's word the devil now
[23:25] puts it in the heart of Judas to betray
[23:27] Christ it's a strong word there's one of
[23:29] you here who will betray me there's one
[23:32] of you who is a devil the devil then
[23:33] puts it in the heart of Judas to betray
[23:37] Christ now this is where I'm having to
[23:40] take kind of a a fast forward a little
[23:43] bit so you can see how this directly
[23:45] impacts the True Believer in Luke chap
[23:49] 22: 47 to 50 we find ourselves here in
[23:52] the garden and Jesus is praying and he's
[23:54] speaking H and he's encouraging the
[23:57] disciples and they're having the convers
[23:58] ation and while he yet spake this is in
[24:00] the Garden of Gethsemane this is at the
[24:02] very moment that he is betrayed Behold a
[24:04] multitude and he that was called Judas
[24:06] one of the 12 this is the one that
[24:08] betrays him this is the one who was a
[24:10] devil this is the one that the devil has
[24:11] now put it in the heart of Judas to
[24:13] betray him went before them and Drew
[24:15] near unto Jesus to kiss him that Judas
[24:19] kiss what a what a what a action he told
[24:22] them this is how I'm going to identify
[24:24] the one that I'm betrayed I will kiss
[24:26] him and Jesus said unto him Judas betray
[24:29] us thou the son of man with the
[24:31] kiss and then the disciples who are of
[24:34] the TW but they're not the one that's a
[24:36] devil they're not the one that has
[24:37] betrayed him when they which were about
[24:40] him saw what would follow they said to
[24:43] him Lord shall we Smite with the
[24:46] sword should we defend you should we go
[24:48] to battle here and what happens is Peter
[24:50] draws his sword it's described here in
[24:52] verse 50 and one of them smok the
[24:53] servant of the high priest and cut off
[24:55] his ear what it what happened is the
[24:58] action of the Judas caused Peter to act
[25:02] out of character and to actually fight
[25:05] against what Christ had been prophesying
[25:07] over and over again needed to happen so
[25:10] we need to be very sensitive to how the
[25:12] make believer is going to act up in an
[25:14] acting up he's wanting to draw you off
[25:16] sides he's wanting to get you worked up
[25:19] or get you thinking about something or
[25:20] get you really really defensive you're
[25:22] not the one betraying Christ but you
[25:24] draw your sword seemingly in defense of
[25:27] Christ but what has provoked you is not
[25:30] Christ himself who said it must be that
[25:32] I uh give my life and this is going to
[25:34] happen but it's your response to the
[25:36] make
[25:38] believer this is that thorn or the bur
[25:45] that needling that agitation that the
[25:48] make believer can
[25:50] be the make Believers we're using the
[25:53] phrase pseudo Christ and that may be a
[25:55] really strong word but I wanted that to
[25:57] kind of catch in our heads but the make
[25:59] believer is a
[26:01] fabrication it's a hybrid it's an
[26:03] unbeliever pretending to be a believer
[26:06] and it's meant and used for the purpose
[26:08] to dissuade
[26:10] you it's used for the purpose of
[26:12] discouraging you or deceiving you if you
[26:14] don't like to think in terms of you
[26:16] being the genuine believer and somebody
[26:17] else being the make believer it's the
[26:18] make believer in you that exist to try
[26:22] to discourage you it's your own thoughts
[26:24] as a shadow of that person who's now
[26:26] dead and buried in the sea of
[26:28] forgetfulness that kind of hovers around
[26:30] in your memory and it's meant to
[26:31] discourage you and dissuade you or
[26:33] deceive you 1 Timothy 4: 1 and two now
[26:37] the spirit speaketh expressly that in
[26:39] the latter time some shall depart from
[26:41] the faith why will they depart from the
[26:43] faith they give heed to seducing
[26:46] spirits and doctrines of
[26:49] devils these seducing spirits and
[26:51] doctrines of devils speak lies and
[26:52] hypocrisy having their conscience seared
[26:55] with the hot
[26:56] iron they depart from from the faith
[26:58] because of
[27:00] Seduction acts 20:30 just some quick
[27:03] scriptures here to look at this uh this
[27:06] principle of this
[27:09] thought of
[27:12] Seduction
[27:14] influences very near us also of your own
[27:18] selves shall men
[27:19] arise speaking perverse
[27:22] things to draw away disciples after them
[27:25] make themselves prophets they make
[27:27] themselves leaders
[27:29] and what did what do they get they get
[27:30] pseudo Brides for pseudo
[27:33] Christ also of your own selves of your
[27:36] own uh people of your own congregations
[27:40] of your own beliefs and those that may
[27:42] be near you they will rise up and speak
[27:44] things that change or pervert the gospel
[27:46] of Christ and they do it to bring people
[27:48] to
[27:51] themselves 1 Corinthians 11: 19 for
[27:54] there must be also heresies among you
[27:56] that heresy means Visions among you that
[27:59] they which are proved may be made
[28:00] manifest among you refers to separatists
[28:03] who set up their own tables and they try
[28:06] to distinguish themselves through their
[28:08] unique doctrines and teachings they
[28:10] they'll subtly change the message and
[28:11] maybe they'll do it at the beginning uh
[28:13] in a way of just I'm trying to bring
[28:15] clarification but give it enough time
[28:16] and eventually it's such a huge
[28:19] departure from truth that if nobody
[28:22] catches it at the beginning and they
[28:24] stay steadfast with the word they can
[28:25] find themselves totally off the word of
[28:27] God
[28:29] and deceived into a
[28:33] heresy a seducing Spirit doctrines of
[28:37] devils lies in hypocrisy in other words
[28:40] it's a lie presented as truth a lie with
[28:43] truth closing on there will be divisions
[28:46] arise among you men who separate
[28:48] themselves or set up their own tables
[28:50] but he says this is done this is
[28:51] remarkable statement it's done so that
[28:53] they which are approved may be made
[28:55] manifest among you in other words it'll
[28:58] prove your character can you give me
[29:00] that that slide again there for First
[29:01] Corinthians I the division reveals
[29:05] character it's that it's that make
[29:08] believer that God uses to bring out the
[29:11] True
[29:15] Believer in 2 Timothy chapter 2:
[29:20] 18 who concerning the truth have
[29:23] aired saying the resurrection is passed
[29:26] this would be a false Doctrine this
[29:28] would be a mistruth this would be
[29:29] somebody who's not preaching against
[29:31] Christ being the Messiah but preaching M
[29:34] the Messiah and the Christ in a way to
[29:36] change the truth and they're saying oh
[29:38] but this Resurrection is passed and
[29:40] because they perverted the truth it
[29:42] overthrew the faith of
[29:45] some notice that phrase to overthrow the
[29:48] faith of
[29:49] some somebody who teaches the word of
[29:52] God incorrectly may be
[29:55] sincere and may not in their heart s
[29:58] have evil intent or evil motive but
[30:01] there's no level where false Doctrine is
[30:06] innocent and it shouldn't be where we
[30:08] get all nasty and costic about it it's
[30:09] like I want to I want to I want to honor
[30:12] the word of God I want to keep the
[30:13] message pure I don't want to interpret
[30:15] the Bible for my own purposes and God
[30:18] helped me to discern truth help me to
[30:20] know what truth is and and let me not be
[30:23] dismissive if the if the word of God is
[30:25] being changed and presented in a way to
[30:27] just feel like well we can make that
[30:29] piece fit in the overall
[30:31] puzzle false Doctrine only serves to
[30:35] seduce and and and false Doctrine only
[30:38] serves to corrupt or
[30:40] defile it will overthrow or cause Faith
[30:44] to fall that overthrow means to be laid
[30:47] down overthrow pressed down hinder the
[30:50] faith of some well could you imagine if
[30:54] a preacher got up here whether it be me
[30:55] or maybe somebody that you really look
[30:57] up to or more confidence in and they got
[30:59] up and said I'm here to tell you now the
[31:01] Rapture is over and the last have been
[31:02] translated and we're all left
[31:05] behind a and what that might
[31:08] do to cause you to think we've missed it
[31:10] what's happened that's this is just a
[31:12] he's saying that some had been told the
[31:13] resurrection has passed and it shook
[31:15] their
[31:16] faith their faith was
[31:20] overthrown now if you'll turn to 1
[31:23] Corinthians chapter 10 veres
[31:25] 1-6 there's a parallel I'm not going to
[31:27] be able to get through the entirety of
[31:29] this story today but I want to use the
[31:31] Exodus now as a
[31:33] parallel of this makeb believer the
[31:36] pseudo
[31:40] Christ and how that it's impacting it's
[31:43] very near it's going to be right there
[31:44] with us and how The Exodus gives us a
[31:46] great example of this 1 Corinthians
[31:48] chapter 10: 1-6 moreover Brethren I
[31:50] would not that you should be ignorant
[31:52] how that all our fathers were under the
[31:54] cloud and the language is all and all
[31:57] passed to this sea and were all baptized
[31:59] into Moses and the cloud in the sea and
[32:01] did all eat the same spiritual meat and
[32:03] did all drink the same spiritual drink
[32:05] for they drank all of that spiritual
[32:07] rock that follow him and that rock was
[32:09] Christ it's great movement this great
[32:11] Exodus and all are participating in the
[32:14] Supernatural aspects of it they're under
[32:16] the cloud they pass to the Sea they're
[32:18] baptized in this in the cloud and in the
[32:20] sea they eat the same spiritual meat
[32:22] they eat the quail they eat the Mana
[32:23] they drink from the same Rock and that
[32:26] rock was Christ
[32:28] verse five but with many of them God was
[32:30] not well
[32:32] pleased what happened what what does it
[32:34] take to please God with sin you cannot
[32:37] please God with unbelief you cannot
[32:39] please God what they were receiving as
[32:41] far as the quail and the man and these
[32:43] Supernatural things it was not being
[32:44] mixed with faith and when they heard it
[32:47] and when they were told it and when they
[32:49] experienced it God was not pleased
[32:51] because they lacked faith for they were
[32:53] overthrown in the
[32:55] wilderness despite all these
[32:57] Supernatural happenings they are laid
[33:00] low and they die Jesus said your fathers
[33:02] did eat man in the wilderness and they
[33:04] are all
[33:05] dead they were overthrown in the
[33:08] wilderness now Paul is telling Timothy
[33:10] there's some that are among you there's
[33:12] those that will rise up of their own
[33:13] themselves there's going to be those
[33:15] that depart from the faith there's going
[33:16] to be those who have heresies among you
[33:18] there's going to be those who speak
[33:19] perverse things and in doing so it'll
[33:22] overthrow or hinder or bring low the
[33:25] faith of some
[33:28] and in The
[33:29] Exodus the faith of many were overthrown
[33:32] and they died in the wilderness in verse
[33:34] six he says now these things were our
[33:37] examples to intent we should not lust
[33:41] after evil things as they also
[33:45] lusted this example of those in The
[33:47] Exodus who all do this and all do that
[33:49] and all do this and all do that but they
[33:51] were overthrown they are an example that
[33:54] we should not lust after evil things so
[33:58] it was their lust for evil things that
[34:00] caused their faith to be overthrown so
[34:03] The Exodus is an example to us it is
[34:05] there for us to realize just as their
[34:07] lust LED their faith to be degraded to
[34:09] be overthrown we cannot let ourselves
[34:12] experience the
[34:14] same there's a pattern that evolves in
[34:16] this Exodus where we can look at how
[34:18] their faith was overthrown and in
[34:20] Numbers Chapter 11: 4 to6 it says and
[34:23] the mixed multitude that was among them
[34:25] fell austing this mixed multitude was
[34:29] just a it kind of means a collection or
[34:31] a rabble it's the diverse group of
[34:33] non-israelites who were following Israel
[34:35] in The Exodus and could you imagine if
[34:38] you were not an Israelite and you were
[34:40] in Egypt and you saw what was happening
[34:41] you might be like I'm going to get on
[34:43] board with this especially if they
[34:45] started taking things of your ears and
[34:46] you're like well I figure I might as
[34:47] well go out with you but there were many
[34:48] that left who were not
[34:50] Israelites so when the Bible says that
[34:53] there were many that were overthrown in
[34:54] the wilderness it's actually speaking of
[34:56] Israel but it's not just Israel that
[34:59] leaves there's a multitude of others
[35:02] that follow with them and it says and
[35:04] the children of Israel also wept again
[35:06] and said who shall give us flesh to eat
[35:11] do you catch what happened here happens
[35:12] really really fast you need to see it if
[35:14] you're looking at it there in numbers
[35:15] 11:4 there's a mixed multitude amongst
[35:18] Israel and they start to
[35:21] lust they don't know they're not Jews by
[35:24] ethnicity they not Jews by birth these
[35:26] things AR really real to them as it
[35:28] would be to a Jew because listen to be a
[35:30] Jew then you just had to be born
[35:32] one so there there there is that's what
[35:35] so remarkable about uh being an
[35:37] Israelite or a Jew is your religion is
[35:39] your birth uh it's everything was
[35:42] encompassing in it so it shares a great
[35:44] type for us but now these are people
[35:45] that were born of other nations and have
[35:48] other beliefs and did not serve the true
[35:49] God and they start lusting and the Bible
[35:52] says that the children of Israel begin
[35:54] to weep and ask for flesh to eat
[35:58] we remember the fish which we did eat in
[36:01] Egypt freely the cucumbers and the
[36:03] melons and the leaks and the onions and
[36:05] the garlic the
[36:07] garlic but our soul is dried away but
[36:11] there's nothing at all beside this Mana
[36:14] before our
[36:15] eyes man they really they had become
[36:18] jaded bread bread from Heaven which is
[36:21] said to taste in their uh their lore
[36:25] their tradition taste like whatever they
[36:26] wanted
[36:28] and they got tired of it maybe they just
[36:30] needed a better
[36:32] imagination but here they go lusting and
[36:35] the Bible already tells us why it's
[36:38] because somebody was
[36:40] complaining and it wasn't the children
[36:42] of Israel initially but it was the make
[36:44] believer amongst them the one that
[36:45] started out who was driven by the flesh
[36:48] driven by lust and it influenced the
[36:50] Israelites to begin to look at the Mana
[36:55] differently I could imagine at one point
[36:57] it's like this is what our God does
[36:58] right here he gives us Ros for breakfast
[37:01] lunch and dinner in the form of what
[37:04] appears to be nothing more than a
[37:05] tortilla but it tastes like whatever I
[37:07] want it to you can eat the Mana for an
[37:10] appetizer for the main course and for
[37:12] dessert and it was Supernatural but then
[37:15] all someone had to do is start to act
[37:17] get them to question it and just look at
[37:19] it
[37:20] differently well you do realize it's the
[37:22] same thing every every morning and they
[37:24] don't played it properly and the timing
[37:25] is really really awful and they begin to
[37:27] think very very differently about the
[37:29] meals they're eating and it's the makeb
[37:33] believer who lusted and is now calling
[37:37] those who are under the promise to lose
[37:39] their
[37:40] faith it's the make believer that'll
[37:42] cause you to
[37:44] complain it's the make believer that
[37:46] causes you to lust it's the make
[37:47] believer who hand you the question mark
[37:49] and suggest where you ought to put it in
[37:52] Jude verses 3 4 and 5 beloved when I
[37:55] gave all diligence to write unto you of
[37:57] the common salvation it was needful for
[37:58] me to Rite unto you and exhort you that
[38:02] you should earnestly contend for the
[38:04] faith there's only one Faith there's
[38:07] only one truth there's only one way of
[38:09] righteousness contend for stand for the
[38:12] faith which was once delivered under the
[38:14] Saints for there are certain men crept
[38:17] in unawares subtly they crept in they
[38:21] snuck in these men are described as who
[38:24] were before of old ordained to
[38:25] condemnation ungodly men
[38:28] certain men crept in it says and change
[38:31] turn the grace of our God into
[38:33] lasciviousness they changed the gospel
[38:35] of
[38:36] Christ they're not on the outside
[38:39] protesting not on the outside throwing
[38:40] Spears they're on the inside now
[38:42] questioning changing the grace of God in
[38:44] lascivious and denying the only Lord God
[38:47] and our Lord Jesus Christ I will
[38:49] therefore put you in remembrance and now
[38:51] notice the parallel put you in
[38:53] remembrance though you once knew this
[38:54] how that the Lord having saved the
[38:56] people out of the the land of Egypt
[38:58] afterward destroyed them that that
[39:00] shouldn't come as a surprise to you
[39:02] believed
[39:05] not maybe to put it in a really strong
[39:07] way make belief is a greater danger than
[39:09] blatant
[39:11] unbelief it's covert it creeps in
[39:14] unawares this it's uh make belief is
[39:17] undercover
[39:19] unbelief right it's what it is as we
[39:22] said before uh that it's uh make belief
[39:25] is unbelief with up on trying to present
[39:29] it it's not real truth and I guess it
[39:32] was the PLS who said in that good or
[39:33] whatever it is they do when they hear
[39:35] something they really like the preacher
[39:36] does that's where I got it
[39:41] from make belief for ourselves is a
[39:44] greater
[39:46] danger and in The Exodus the children of
[39:48] Israel were caused to doubt and to
[39:51] question
[39:53] in by those who fell austing
[39:59] verse 16 there in Jude we'll read a few
[40:01] more verses here it says these are
[40:03] murmurers
[40:05] complainers walking after their own lust
[40:08] and their mouth speaketh great swelling
[40:10] words having men's persons and
[40:12] admiration because of
[40:14] Advantage a lot to unpacked there the
[40:17] carnality of it the politics of it but
[40:19] beloved remember ye The Words which were
[40:21] spoken before of the Apostle of our Lord
[40:22] Jesus Christ how that they told you
[40:25] there should be mockers in the last time
[40:28] who should walk after their own ungodly
[40:30] lust these be they who separate
[40:33] themselves sensual having not the
[40:39] spirit these are ones that will carve
[40:42] out something it's this
[40:45] uh a little departure deviation and then
[40:48] it's come Feast at this table because
[40:50] that's what the separatist the heresies
[40:52] among you it's not uh laying down all
[40:54] ideas and laying down all false
[40:55] doctrines and coming to the one true
[40:57] table which the prophet has set up and
[40:59] asking us to come and eat of this
[41:00] particular Feast but it's coming out and
[41:03] setting up your own table and then
[41:05] asking that a bigger Circle be drawn to
[41:07] include
[41:08] him they separate themselves he says
[41:10] they do not have the
[41:12] spirit I'm I'm going to cut the sermon
[41:15] short today because I think it would do
[41:17] us some good maybe to think about these
[41:19] things and not go too much further into
[41:22] the
[41:23] Exodus but in The Exodus there was clear
[41:26] influence that caus the one who ought to
[41:28] have overcome to fail and it was written
[41:31] for our example not that we would have
[41:34] an example of our failure but the
[41:36] example of our over how we overcome not
[41:38] that we would look back and say well
[41:39] there's going to be those who are under
[41:41] the promise those that are born again
[41:42] those who cross to this and did that and
[41:43] they're not going to make the they're
[41:45] not going to make the Rapture no I'm not
[41:46] presenting that at all we're looking
[41:48] back and seeing through this lens that
[41:50] God has given us to recognize the tricks
[41:52] of the devil and say that's how he works
[41:54] and because he's going to open our eyes
[41:56] to how unbel Bel Works within our hearts
[41:58] and how make belief Works within our
[41:59] hearts or works in the in the the
[42:01] atmosphere around us in the environments
[42:03] that we're a part of and it all works to
[42:05] try to dis dissuade us discourage us
[42:07] deceive us to overthrow our faith to to
[42:10] push it
[42:12] down in 2 Corinthians chapter 6: 14 to8
[42:15] be not unequally yolked together with
[42:20] unbelievers to be unequally yed is to
[42:22] join with them in one Spirit you can't
[42:23] they have a different nature they have a
[42:25] they have a different desire that would
[42:26] cause
[42:27] conflict well the make believer is of
[42:30] The Same Spirit as the
[42:33] unbeliever so be not unequally Yol
[42:36] together with unbelievers for what
[42:37] Fellowship notice this run of
[42:39] comparisons what Fellowship hath
[42:40] righteousness with unrighteousness what
[42:42] communion hath light with Darkness what
[42:44] Concord with C hath Christ with b or
[42:46] what part hath he that believeth with an
[42:48] Infidel and what agreement hath the
[42:50] temple of God with
[42:51] Idols that's a lot the fellowship
[42:55] communion Concord part
[42:57] agreement of righteousness light Christ
[43:02] belief in the temple of
[43:04] God they have none with unrighteousness
[43:07] Darkness bile Infidel Idols for ye are
[43:11] the Temple of the Living God as God hath
[43:13] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[43:15] them and I will be their God and they
[43:16] shall be my people wherefore come out
[43:19] from among them and be ye separate amen
[43:22] sayith the Lord and touch not the
[43:24] unclean thing and I will receive you and
[43:26] will be a father and you and you shall
[43:27] be my sons and daughters sayith the
[43:29] almighty the word of God calls for a
[43:32] total separation from
[43:34] unbelief it is a separation from
[43:37] unbelief we cannot mix with anti-faith I
[43:40] know that we've probably got this
[43:41] figured out to where well what we want
[43:43] to do is when we separate ourselves
[43:45] we're separating ourselves from the
[43:46] person but if you if you don't recognize
[43:49] the spirit of unbelief if you don't
[43:52] recognize the spirit that is anti-faith
[43:54] then then we become of no use to who are
[43:57] subject to the spirit we just write off
[44:00] anybody who doesn't believe like us and
[44:02] we all do it in the name of the
[44:03] scripture but it's a sensitivity to
[44:05] recognize I have to separate myself from
[44:07] all unbelief I cannot mix my faith with
[44:11] something that is anti-faith and just as
[44:13] the Bible says be not unequally yolked
[44:16] to yoke yourself with an unbeliever
[44:18] would be something that would be unlo
[44:20] unequal it's the same with make belief
[44:24] we can't out have that Fellowship
[44:25] communion that part that agreement that
[44:27] Concord speaks of Harmony and unity and
[44:30] commonality we cannot do that with make
[44:33] belief remember a make believer is an
[44:36] unbeliever pretending to be a
[44:39] believer what you'll find in The
[44:42] Exodus is the make believer ultimately
[44:44] was the one who couldn't follow all the
[44:47] word of
[44:50] God in 1 Corinthians chapter 5:
[44:53] 11-13 I'm sharing this these these next
[44:56] few scriptures I'm just sharing
[44:59] these uh for wait for you to consider
[45:03] but now I have written unto you not to
[45:05] keep Company If any man that is called a
[45:07] brother be a fornicator or Covetous or
[45:10] an idolator or a or a drunkard or
[45:12] an extortioner with such a one know not
[45:15] to eat it's heavy stuff isn't it don't
[45:19] you wish we had a list some of the
[45:21] things I do there's a black list of
[45:23] attorneys you can't use and uh I don't
[45:25] check that list I want to know if I'm on
[45:27] it no they uh I know that I'm not on it
[45:29] because I continue to do work for this
[45:31] the for this agency but there's they
[45:34] they blacklist somebody they don't trust
[45:36] anymore and it makes it very easy if
[45:38] they're on the list you can't you can't
[45:39] be used and some of you going to try to
[45:41] find
[45:42] it and in some ways it would be good if
[45:44] we could just be told who do who should
[45:46] who should I not mix with and who is it
[45:47] that I shouldn't have anything to do
[45:48] with but you know let's dispatch with
[45:51] trying to identify people in particular
[45:53] but just notice how heavy this is don't
[45:56] keep company or sit down to eat with a
[45:58] person who claims to be a brother but it
[46:00] fornicates as Covetous as idolator a
[46:03] a drunken or
[46:05] extortioner now at the very least what I
[46:07] want you to do is to recognize that Paul
[46:09] is identifying some Lev some influence
[46:13] some danger line that we ourselves are
[46:16] presented with if we keep company or mix
[46:20] with someone of
[46:21] that for what have I to do to judge them
[46:24] also that are without do not ye judge
[46:26] them that are
[46:27] within but them that are without God
[46:30] judges therefore put away from among
[46:32] yourselves that Wicked
[46:35] person the Bible teaches that it's done
[46:37] for the purpose that the one who is
[46:39] wicked and doing the sinning could
[46:40] recognize that something is
[46:43] wrong I believe that there has to be a
[46:45] Christlike way that we can measure
[46:47] ourselves my wife and I were discussing
[46:49] this morning on what it means that
[46:51] charity thinketh no evil and when you're
[46:54] presented with evil Behavior by somebody
[46:56] or somebody does something and and you
[46:58] feel that it's for the wrong motive or
[46:59] the wrong objective or there's something
[47:01] that's not right are we to just kick
[47:03] that out of our minds are we to learn
[47:04] from it to understand it how do we
[47:06] wrestle with it this scripture presents
[47:08] to us a similar situation that I'm to
[47:10] put a wicked person from among myself
[47:13] whatever that might be literally Paul is
[47:15] saying that the wicked person the make
[47:17] believer has a leav influence hallelu
[47:22] Hebrews 12:16 says a fornicator is a
[47:25] profane person or our F person as Esau
[47:28] Esau as a fornicator sold his Birthright
[47:31] for a morsel of
[47:33] meat the message teaches us that Esau
[47:35] himself too Cain Judas Esau were make
[47:39] Believers and all because of how hungry
[47:41] he was he was quick to despise the
[47:44] birthright and sell it for a bowl of
[47:49] soup these are strong influences 2
[47:52] Timothy 3: 5 to8 they have in this end
[47:56] time these have a form of goddess they
[47:58] take on the shape and form of God they
[48:00] take on the pretense as a Christian they
[48:03] have a form of godess they are pseudo
[48:05] Christ but they don't have the power of
[48:07] Christ because they've denied the power
[48:08] of
[48:10] Revelation from such turn away do not
[48:13] behold them do not admire them do not
[48:15] let them influence you I think it should
[48:18] give us great pause the people that we
[48:19] listen to in their
[48:23] podcast there's a wonderful brother in
[48:25] Tucson named brother Jordan Peterson who
[48:26] started a podcast and watched his
[48:28] numbers just Skyrocket not quite
[48:30] realizing
[48:31] why but even though uh Dr Jordan
[48:35] Peterson might have some really neat
[48:37] takes on things that's not the gospel
[48:39] you want to swallow
[48:41] wholesale and I can't remember some of
[48:43] these other ones that are out there the
[48:45] Kirks and the Ben and the Von John's or
[48:49] whatever the people out the Joe rogans
[48:51] they might have a lot of talking points
[48:53] that speak to something in your heart
[48:55] but you have to realize
[48:57] those things can solely your
[49:00] minds to to very great
[49:06] levels those should be the ones that we
[49:08] would naturally have a very strong all
[49:10] the filters on when it comes to
[49:13] listening to those we should not be so
[49:16] quick to digest
[49:17] them turn away it's saying but not just
[49:21] from those who are overtly in the world
[49:23] and and espousing and and sharing things
[49:26] that are ungodly or or
[49:29] destructive but to turn away even from
[49:32] those who have a pretense of
[49:36] Christianity for this sort are they
[49:38] which creep into houses and Lead captive
[49:40] silly women Laden with sins LED away
[49:42] with diverse lust there is the influence
[49:44] now of The Pretender the make the pseudo
[49:47] Christ creating a pseudo
[49:50] bride ever learning never able to come
[49:53] to the knowledge of the truth now as
[49:55] Janice and jambers with stood
[49:57] Moses so do these also resist the
[50:01] truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate
[50:03] concerning the faith what's the one
[50:06] thing I like to always point out when we
[50:08] refer to jennice and J how did they
[50:10] withstand Moses they didn't call him a
[50:12] false prophet they just did what he
[50:16] did they just impersonated there's a lot
[50:19] of men today that'll try to impersonate
[50:23] the
[50:24] prophet with gifts of discernment
[50:26] prophecy that
[50:29] fail and never
[50:32] repent now what kind of influence would
[50:34] that be what are you opening up your
[50:37] spirit to now I wouldn't necessarily
[50:39] just judge it in the moment look at the
[50:41] trajectory of something and many people
[50:42] find themselves there is one that we
[50:44] might have all called brother Edgar
[50:46] Rosco for many many years and thought of
[50:48] him as a as a brother that preaches the
[50:50] message and maybe he got off into these
[50:51] different ways but now they call him
[50:54] Elohim
[50:56] and and uh I was fellowshiping with
[50:58] brother Tim do the other day and he
[51:00] referred to brother Edgar Rosco and I
[51:02] said I believe he's Elohim don't
[51:03] misgender him and so I thought well
[51:05] there's a new a new take but how do
[51:08] people get there slowly
[51:13] subtly and you become numb maybe even in
[51:15] your own country you don't want to
[51:16] accept the fact that this person you
[51:17] looked up to this person you love this
[51:19] person that God used mightily is now
[51:21] prophesying falsely and everything the
[51:23] whole story gets changed so that they're
[51:25] never wrong
[51:27] wow Janice and jambre withstood Moses by
[51:33] impersonation that's what the make
[51:35] believer does he withstands Truth by
[51:37] impersonating truth not having
[51:40] it Hebrews chapter 3: 12 to
[51:45] 19 Brothers if you could come to your
[51:47] instruments we'll we'll close here and
[51:49] then we'll get into The Exodus and
[51:51] another service go back to the Book of
[51:53] Numbers take heed Brethren lest there be
[51:56] any
[51:57] of you in any of you an evil heart of
[51:59] unbelief and departing from the Living
[52:01] God now that's that's remarkable isn't
[52:03] it that he would say you take heed think
[52:05] about yourself think about what's in
[52:06] your heart and consider whether or not
[52:08] there be any unbelief because it's
[52:10] unbelief that causes us to depart from
[52:13] God so we must exhort one another daily
[52:16] why it is called today lest any of you
[52:18] be hardened through the deceitfulness of
[52:21] sin this is what unbelief will do it's
[52:24] deceitful and it hardens us for we are
[52:27] made partakers of Christ if we hold the
[52:29] beginning of our confidence steadfast un
[52:31] the
[52:31] end now this is hearkening back to the
[52:34] resurrect excuse me The Exodus which
[52:35] he's already referenced earlier just
[52:38] even in this chapter while it said today
[52:40] if you will hear his voice Harden not
[52:41] your hearts as in the
[52:42] provocation for some when they had heard
[52:45] did provoke how how did they provoke how
[52:50] be it not all that came out of Egypt by
[52:53] Moses so some provoked but not all but
[52:56] with whom was he grieved 40 years who
[52:58] was
[52:59] it was it not with them that had sinned
[53:03] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[53:04] this is what Paul described as their
[53:06] faith being
[53:08] overthrown in the
[53:10] [Music]
[53:17] [Music]
[53:19] wilderness it's those that Jews said did
[53:22] afterwards believed
[53:25] not and to whom swear he that they
[53:27] should not enter into his rest but them
[53:30] that believed
[53:32] not sin is unbelief he says so we see
[53:36] that they could not enter in because of
[53:40] unbelief and I want to go back to
[53:43] numbers
[53:44] 11 and I want you if you have time
[53:46] follow through in The Exodus you could
[53:47] go to chapters 13 and uh 14 of numbers
[53:50] and even carry it on through maybe just
[53:52] picking spots and reading and you'll
[53:53] find it was the
[53:55] influence it was that influence that
[53:57] ultimately caused people to reject the
[53:59] truth that there was going to be a
[54:01] crossing
[54:03] over our faith must
[54:05] remain unsoed by
[54:08] unbelief it cannot be influenced by it
[54:11] cannot be motivated by cannot be shaped
[54:13] by pseudo
[54:16] Christ one of the big biggest dangers to
[54:18] us as Believers is not the
[54:22] unbeliever that bold outspoken blatant
[54:28] unbeliever but it's the unbeliever that
[54:30] assumes the character of a True
[54:33] Believer and becomes the source of
[54:35] friction becomes the force the source of
[54:38] criticism becomes the source of uh
[54:41] seducing
[54:42] spirits and again this is true this is
[54:45] just the reality we have there's three
[54:47] kinds of Believers and there's those
[54:48] that reject there's those that pretend
[54:50] to accept and then there's those that do
[54:51] accept and if that reality sometimes has
[54:53] been used to abuse and to used as a a a
[54:57] a bully Club to bully people well look
[54:59] at it within your own
[55:02] self look at it within your own self
[55:05] just how easy it is to wrestle and to
[55:07] fight and when you would do good there's
[55:08] evil present with you what is it it's
[55:10] that one who was born by the first birth
[55:13] still has breath still has memory still
[55:14] has affection it's that make believer
[55:16] that wants to influence the faith that
[55:18] you have in your soul and he's the one
[55:20] that you've got to bring under
[55:23] subjection so if it makes you anxious to
[55:26] look without just look within if it
[55:29] makes you anxious to look within get
[55:30] over it look
[55:33] within and recognize that what I'm
[55:35] ministering to you today is not a metric
[55:38] by which we can begin to measure others
[55:40] and determine whether or not they make
[55:41] Bel but something that we can use to try
[55:44] to keep the forces of unbelief at
[55:46] Bay to recognize that instead of saying
[55:49] that person's an unbeliever that
[55:50] person's a makeb Believer recognize the
[55:53] power of anti-faith to take a believer
[55:56] and cause them to begin to act as a
[55:58] conduit of make
[56:01] belief that they could recognize that we
[56:03] could all see together we have been
[56:05] given a word which is right a word that
[56:07] is correct and I want to stand for that
[56:09] I want to support it I want to live
[56:12] it and it's make belief it's the pseudo
[56:15] Christ that may be leading pseudo
[56:18] brides and I don't want to jump into the
[56:22] parade oh my goodness this one looks fun
[56:26] and next thing you know it's going it's
[56:28] descending
[56:29] down meanwhile there's a genuine Christ
[56:31] with a genuine bride there's been many
[56:33] churches churches Brides brides a lot of
[56:34] pseudos there's been a lot of pseudo
[56:36] Christ there's been a lot of pseudo
[56:37] Brides but there's come one in this hour
[56:40] the revelation of Jesus Christ there's
[56:42] come one in this hour and it's calling
[56:43] forth the true
[56:45] bride and the devil wants to use the
[56:48] make believe the make believe the make
[56:49] believe to keep you from going all in on
[56:54] Jesus Christ God help us today let's
[56:58] stand to our feet brother Michael if you
[56:59] don't mind getting ready just uh need a
[57:01] little bit of help with my
[57:03] throat thank you for your attentiveness
[57:05] today I'm excited about getting into the
[57:08] Exodus on this and just how they were
[57:13] influenced the spirit of unbelief if we
[57:15] could just bow our heads in a word of
[57:17] Prayer
[57:19] [Music]
[57:27] let's bow in prayer gracious Heavenly
[57:29] Father Lord today as we close this
[57:31] service as we worship for a few moments
[57:34] afterwards and as we are
[57:36] dismissed we can say within our hearts
[57:38] Lord I believe in
[57:40] you and as our brother said one day in
[57:42] the scripture Lord I believe help thou
[57:44] my
[57:46] unbelief perhaps Lord the reason why
[57:49] unbelief is
[57:51] so powerful in our lives as we look
[57:54] inward is because we mistook it for
[57:58] belief because it's
[58:01] pretending and Lord I pray that none of
[58:03] us would be confused by unbelief that we
[58:05] would not be deceived by
[58:07] unbelief but that we could just call it
[58:09] out for what it
[58:11] [Music]
[58:12] is it's a failure of intellectual Faith
[58:15] it's a failure of emotional
[58:17] Faith so Lord even if we could just
[58:19] realize that sometimes it's just our
[58:21] minds it's just a hope so but dig down
[58:24] deep to that spot that's within us that
[58:26] says Lord I believe you at all cost I
[58:28] believe you and let Faith take its final
[58:31] resting place on your word and nothing
[58:34] else and Lord as I struggle today to
[58:36] bring forth this thought in Greater
[58:39] Clarity
[58:40] and perhaps the same intensity that you
[58:43] revealed it to me I trust that we could
[58:46] all take it in the balance that it's
[58:49] intended that these pseudo Christ these
[58:52] false christs these things that pretend
[58:53] to be Christian pretend to be m message
[58:56] purport to be
[58:58] true they're the things that end up
[59:01] influencing us the
[59:03] most it's where this battle has
[59:06] evolved Lord if there's a brother here
[59:09] today who's addicted to something evil
[59:11] and something filthy Lord we know to
[59:13] fight that battle through prayer we know
[59:15] to fight that battle maybe a demon needs
[59:17] to be cast
[59:18] out but Lord It's these religious
[59:22] ideas it's this false doctrines it's the
[59:27] pretense of
[59:29] sincerity it's those things that can so
[59:32] subtly hold our faith
[59:34] back lord I don't want to I wouldn't
[59:36] want anyone here to exaggerate in their
[59:38] response like a Peter and draw their
[59:40] sword and go to cut and no Lord that's
[59:41] not it at all we cannot respond to make
[59:44] belief as a make
[59:47] believer help us Lord to stand our
[59:49] ground for the sake of the one that's
[59:51] pretending for the sake of the one who
[59:53] has not renounced all unbelief for the
[59:55] sake of one who's caught up in error the
[59:56] one that's caught up in movement the one
[59:58] that's caught up in a cult the one who's
[59:59] being deceived led to sleep Lord help
[1:00:03] us to not be drawn off sides to be too
[1:00:07] defensive and to be
[1:00:09] CTIC to be Antichrist in
[1:00:14] ourselves Lord I pray that you bless us
[1:00:16] today with your presence as we worship
[1:00:18] seal these things in our hearts as only
[1:00:20] you can we commit each one to you now in
[1:00:23] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:26] amen
