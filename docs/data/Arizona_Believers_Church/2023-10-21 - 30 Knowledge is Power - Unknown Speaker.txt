TRANSCRIPT
========================================
such exciting scriptures to read uh so much depth and richness in these things I want to hope hopefully by God's grace today just uh maybe not even scratch the surface but at least point to it and look at some of the things that are contained here just so beautiful my title today is knowledge is power and I know that might sound like a little bit of clickbait and maybe in some ways it is because that might seem to be a little bit of a controversial statement uh before you judge it uh just hold tight get to a place in the scripture I think it'll become clear what we mean by this I thought about calling it knowledge is empowering that might help some be able to swallow it but I just uh felt settled on this title yesterday knowledge is power and this power that we're talking about may not be the power that we think about in terms of physical strength the knowledge that we're talking about may not be the knowledge we're talking about in terms of mental prowess but we're talking about manifesting Heaven's mystery here on Earth right now today as Believers uh manifesting the kingdom of God in our lives and having a Kingdom Life seeing Kingdom order established in our relationships and we're just uh uh hope that this uh particular subject matter will be a blessing to you Isaiah 11:9 I want to start here because we were at this juncture on Wednesday says they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea Wednesday we looked at how what that meant to say the waters cover the sea and as the waters in the oceans extend down to all the depths and fill up all the trenches and caverns and caves uh in the Seas so shall the knowledge of the Lord be it's just going to find its way into every crevice and uh anywhere that there's space anywhere that it can fill up it's going to do so and that's the kind of the idea behind the um this knowledge of the Lord shall fill the Earth as the waters cover the sea and if I could just back up a little bit we when we ministered on no more shadows and I believe manifesting your measure of Glory we touched a lot on this but our future home will have no death no sorrow I maybe it doesn't excite you that there'll be no death there I think after all those prayer requests that might have there might have been at least an extinctive thank goodness but there will be no disease there'll be no sin there'll be no shadows and as it says here they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain I want to say this at the outset just to get this kind of in your mind a little bit says they shall not hurt I know that they there may seem a little bit ambiguous and it's kind of alluding uh to some things it says they shall not hurt it means to be bad to be evil or displeasing uh to hurt it's to be uh sad or ous and it means to do an injury or to do evil comes from the the root in the Hebrew there's to break or to shatter says that they shall not hurt they will not do evil they will not do injury there will be nothing displeasing that's quite a statement there will be nothing nothing no injury no Hurt No Evil in my Holy Mountain it says and they shall not destroy that means to corrupt or to ruin something kind of being decayed and something be be changed uh in the Hebrews to Mar or to spoil in other words it's to pervert something something in its Purity when it's perverted it's destroyed it's no longer what it was it's no longer in the condition that God originally intended it to be so it's quite a statement to say they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain and then it says for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord and in the sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride brother Bram says now have you got have you got the city see it's a Holy Mountain it's in that place where he's describing it's not a cube it's a pyramid it's a mountain and he says nothing shall hurt or destroy in all my Holy Mountain saith the Lord and if you've been looking at this sermon uh future home and been studying it a little bit you'll find that this use of this scripture here in isaah is 11 is quite striking because what he has done is he's carried this description here in Isaiah 11 into the New Jerusalem into the eighth day as he's calling it The Holy Mountain and he's wanting us to see this picture that God has in his mind and he uses this imagery of a mountain not a cube uh maybe not uh uh what people might think of Mount Zion there in Jerusalem or near Jerusalem but that Mount Zion stood for the bride that Mount Zion stood for something spiritual that Mount Zion is that New Jerusalem the city of God coming out of heaven of God coming down to the Earth and so brother Bram it's picking up on this imagery of Isaiah 11:9 when he says they shall nothing shall hurt or destroy in all my Holy Mountain and in Revelations 21:4 we read where it says and God shall wipe all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are ped away this is in that in that Eighth Day in Revelations 21 in this city God's wiping all tears away tears will have no more purpose pain will have no more purpose sorrow will have no more purpose death will have no more purpose it's actually going to be cast in Lake of Fire itself and completely destroyed and so there's none of those things there anymore then in verse 27 it says and there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth this is into that City into this place neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life this is our future home this is us being able to read uh in in in these words here in this description and even the symbolic desri descriptions contained around here that this is the the world in its final condition this is the world in its the final outcome of this Redemptive process and brother Bram describes it this way in future home so it's just a great Mountain like the pyramid and the city is on the mountain Glory there you are there is the par Paradise of God the light of the world that perfect Kingdom that's the Perfection of perfection of perfection that perfect Kingdom not the seventh day the Eternal one not the Millennium the new Earth and that's he's wanting to shift perspective there a little bit so you're not looking at these things necessarily Millennium because seems like a lot of things might fit but he's saying these things in Revelations 21 this future home it's not the Millennium but it's the new Earth in that Eighth Day the paradise of God and how is it that we've arrived to this condition this paradise of God the light of the world the perfect Kingdom this city on this mountain as brother br's describing it Revelations 21 Revelations uh uh uh as it's described brother BR and the future home describing it how did it get there through that plan and process of redemption we've been using this very carefully over the last few Services it's uh this process of redemption has created this perfect Kingdom and what's kind of been uh um the theme over the last few Services is even though this Plan of Redemption is in three stages we shouldn't just look at our lives as being well I'm Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and kind of like that's it you're on a shelf let's go get the next one and get them to the Stations of the message and they can they can do the do all the check the boxes of the new birth it's there's it may be a three-stage process but it opens up so much more it it it that's if I could say it this way that's the beginning because that's the new birth something's just been born Uh Uh something's begun and so it's not when we think of three stages of redemption and we might think oh we've got these three classes we have these three stages while there's so much more to it and that even pertains to the Earth yes brother Bram says in the future home God has tabernacled in Man by redeeming him by these three processes so we know it's a three- States process he says now God is going to redeem the earth and the Tabernacle in the Earth with the subjects of the earth which he brought forth from from the earth and he's saying has God redeemed you through a three-part process that's how he redeems the Earth and I'm wanting you to recognize there's more to the Earth's Redemption and if we could see that connection that parallel well what God does to me he does to the Earth and we begin to see what he does to the Earth and if I could take scripture for you to see what is included in that process of redemption then it'll open up our eyes to see what's included in our process of redemption and all the benefits of redemption if the new birth places you in the body of Christ and makes available you all the promises of God then with yes the baptism of the Holy Ghost seals your Eternal Destiny but now I want to walk and enjoy all the benefits that are available to me as a born- again believer as we read recently I think in thirst that that there's so much privilege there's so much the skies are full of so much genuine that we can be partaking in so there they shall not hurt nor destroy and all my Holy Mountain for the Earth think of that phrase for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord and as as we looked at the knowledge of the Lord on Wednesday night it doesn't mean to have knowledge of God and to have your mind just full of God to where every thought is God God God God God God God and everything is God God God God God God that's not what it thinks to what it means to say that you're full of the knowledge of the Lord but it means God's knowledge his judgment his opinion his discernment it speaks of the perception of God so that really your eyes see as God sees your mind processes things as God processes things so the Earth shall be full of the correct understanding of things somehow some way the correct understanding of things is going to uh uh dominate the Earth the way God would do things is the way the Earth is going to be run the way that God sees things is how things are going to be done so for the earth to be full of the knowledge of God it's full of his Perfection and his plans and and his claims the way he is and it so it speaks of a familiarity or an acquaintance with the character of God there's some intimate understanding of the will of God to have the mind of God is to know what he wants done with the word to have the mind of God is to know the will of God that's that's what always says the knowledge of the Lord it says Ah this is God's thoughts towards that this is what God would want done this is how God sees things and as we've read this several times I want you to catch this the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord and brother B says now compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people compare with our own eyes to see what he's done to redeem the world he's done the same thing to redeem his uh his people and so Earth's Redemption produces a perfect Paradise no sin no sickness no death no fear no doubt it's full of Glory it's full of light it's full of the knowledge of the Lord and as we've been looking at Revelations 21 using future home as our example this perfect Eighth Day uh uh that we see in uh uh in in the Scripture it follows that last stage of redemption which brother calls a baptism of fire and it receives its baptism this perfect Kingdom as brother bandam calls it it follows that last stage of redemption that's the Plan of Redemption for the Earth and God's Plan of Redemption for his people if the Earth is going to be in this glorious condition and the Earth is going to have this after its last stage of redemption I want you to think about this our three stages of redemption doesn't even include the change of this body right it's talking about the Redemption of the Soul so the Earth not being a three-part being itself not being a person as you are it in type goes through the justification sanctification the baptism of fire brother just bringing that out of the scripture to see look what the world how the world ends up in this beautiful glorious perfect Kingdom and he shows us this parallel of redemption for the Earth and that's how it ends up in this glorious perfect Kingdom in the end and that's after its baptism of fire now let me ask you who are born again when did you receive your baptism of fire and so that Eighth Day condition that's reflected in future home in Revelations 21 God's Plan of Redemption for us then can produce a glorious Kingdom in our own lives because we've already received that stage of redemption in our souls as we read in Colossians chap 1: 9 and 10 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding I think this scripture punches enough just with the way that it's written that it doesn't necessarily need different uh the Greek to be brought out of it in different translations and read it through the Amplified and the parallel but it says that you might walk worthy of the Lord into all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of Goden that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will filled you want to know what filled is just tell your kids that you're going to fill their cup wi with some soda pop a a a and just fill it halfway if you want to know what filled means they're gonna like nah I no you said you were going to fill my cup and so it's this this filling here it says that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding this is the knowledge of the Lord and through this process we begin to walk worthy pleasing unto him fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God God Amen I believe that you can find this theme throughout the scripture and throughout the message that the purpose of the Holy Spirit just to put it in language maybe that serves my My overall title in this series the purpose of the holy spirit is the ever expansion of the Kingdom in our lives just to continue to expand its Dominion to expand its domain God Saves your soul now we're going to start from there that's home base that's the throne now just to expand and to work out and to grow and increase and this knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding increasing in the knowledge of God fruitful in every good work that's the purpose and the nature of the holy spirit this is how we know that we've been born again is uh not not only has our desires changed but we begin to realize that because of a changed desire our Direction changes and we look back and throughout our ups and downs and whatever's happened we say you know what this has been growing it it the trajectory might all might not just be straight up but you look back and say you know what it's always been growing because that's the nature of the Holy Ghost that's how it works the Bible says in 2 Peter chap 3:18 I I did originally have this at the end of my notes for so if you amen hard enough and loud enough I might just stop here just instinctively because this was my last two last two uh last quote in scripture at the very end and I just felt to move it here but it says but grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as newborn babes we desire the sincere milk of the word of God that we may grow thereby and as we grow we grow in Grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ this is this is what we do as Believers we grow we increase this is the purpose of the Holy Ghost the expanding of the Kingdom in our lives this statement here I want to come back to it Lord willing in the future brother Braham says and Christ is revealed in his own word that's the thing that's the matter with the message today I mean think about that phrase CU when we say the message today and we would say it this way we would think about people who believe the message kind of like the association of churches and and he uses it in that sense here that's the matter with the message today those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened if we've obtained the message in our hearts if we've obtained the word in our hearts and we've got the word it says we must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened this is the emphasis lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the green out of you making matured Christians think of that greenness that that's young the green can bend and they wave brother ra talks about those young little trees and the wind blowing and and and how they dance and they shout and the old dead trees are they're all mad at the Young trees but guess what those young trees are growing and if they're growing by the life they're not going to become a dead tree but they mature they grow up they increase and brother says we got to be in the presence of the sun to bake all the greenness out of us and hey greenness May mean something for you it may mean something for me but that's what the sunlight is doing in this hour it's baking out greenness even the youthfulness and the immaturity in those things making matured Christians increasing in the knowledge of God so when Isaiah says that we shall be full the whole Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord that the truth contained here in in Isaiah chapter 11 is so vast and extremely applicable and I want you to turn to Proverbs 1:7 I want you to but you don't have to it's voluntary it's not compulsory anymore a lot of times turning doesn't make sense I guess you tap and you scroll or you flip you swipe or we just imagine it we just imagine in our minds we just I read the Bible before I got a picture perfect memory let me just browse to Proverbs 1 verse 7 I feel this is important to touch on this where knowledge begins this kind of knowledge because to say knowledge is power it may be controversial considering what we're taught in the message what brother Bram says about carnal wisdom and what the Bible warns us about knowledge of man and the intellect of man and intelligence and things that relate to humanity to say knowledge is power and even if we use the Latin it's like science is power it would be even though kind of what it would begin to read to us and we're thinking wait mm we don't want anything about we don't want that and so I want you to understand the knowledge I'm talking about has a beginning says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction we can get sidetracked talking about the fools who despise wisdom and instruction but I want to focus on the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge this is the reverence and obedience to God without which all other knowledge is vain now I want you to make sure that that's been entered into the record when you think about knowledge is power that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge if we do not have the reverent reverential fear of God and the respect for God that love for God then all other knowledge is vain so the fear of the Lord is the beginning of true knowledge but to the fools those who are indifferent to God and His word they do not they do not desire the knowledge of God they're IND different about it you try try to even those who claim to love God and love his word and and and and have received the word of God you try to show them in the word of God something they don't want to know the word of God they want their own ideas they want their own Traditions they want their own uh uh whatever it might be their bent or their taste and so it's the fool who despises wisdom and instruction and they're kind of cold on the word of God they do not desire the knowledge of God but the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge says in Proverbs chapter 9: 9 and 10 give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learning the fear of the Lord I think that's a beautiful statement I wanted to have that uh in our minds just how we can increase the wise increase the just increase in this wisdom and learning the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding the knowledge of the Holy is understanding so we talk about knowledge and understanding or we say the knowledge of the Holy is understanding we talk about having understanding it's not so much about scientific princip principles in the nature of man and how how uh how the the periodic table and formulas and all sorts of things that relate to uh Academia it's not that kind of understanding oh I know how a car works or I know how the this happens and I know how Nutrition Works I know these processes and I know these things I I I figured out how to use AI or I figured out how to use data analytics and these different things that's not the understanding that we're talking about but it's talking about knowledge of the Holy now that's understanding to have knowledge of of God to have knowledge of divine things now that's understanding would it not be true that if you had the mind of God that you would be in a position to understand anything God having been the creator of all things and he's the original scientist in that way and he's the one that brought everything forth he knows the composition of things he knows how things interact and react he knows knows the cause of things he knows the end of things he knows the beginning of things that's that's real understanding amen Psalm 111:10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom nowhere this wisdom and knowledge and understanding where it's rooted a good understanding have all they that do his Commandments his praise endureth forever those that do his Commandments are said to have a good understanding now we could say the chicken or the egg is it because they have a good understanding they do his Commandments or they do as Commandments and they're given a good understanding well you could break out and try to figure that out but I would say this it's assumed that if someone doing the will of God they got understanding if they're doing the will of God they have a good understanding and because they there's some there's some acknowledgment of this works and this is why it works and this is why we do it and so we can never have true knowledge if we do not begin with God who is the Fountain of all knowledge so this speaks to say that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge when we talk about knowledge knowledge then in this respect it speaks of our minds being influenced by the fear of God and the love of God being influenced by the respect for God not a vain knowledge not a knowledge disconnected from God but a knowledge that is inspired by and informed by and influenced by our love for God and our respect to God in 1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse1 now as touching things offered unto idols and I I'll say it this way Paul is is dealing with different levels of understanding uh things offered under Idols people that might eat something offered under an idol uh what and kind of that whole that whole issue and so he says as things offered under Idols he says we know that we all have knowledge so he's acknowledg we know these things these are things that we know he goes knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth and the knowledge he's talking about here would be a a knowledge that's disconnected from God disconnected from the mind of God the will of God the purpose of God and a knowledge without love Is Just puffed up there's no substance there it's posturing if I could say it this way that when something puffs up trying to present itself as bigger trying to present itself as something that it's not it fills itself with air when something's puffed up you fill yourself with air and you get Ed up and you might look bigger and you might sound bad and you might you might appear to be bigger and Bolder but when the air is let out oh well that's really what it is and so it has something to do with posturing this kind of knowledge disconnected from love puff Puffs up whereas charity has substance to it it can add to it looks to edify so the kind of knowledge that we're talking about is a knowledge that is connected with God not disconnected from God in anything that we might have in our minds that we understand and we have all knowledge of the message and we have all knowledge of the church or we have all knowledge of what brother M taught about certain things if it doesn't come back to a fear and reverence for God instead of a reverence for appearance and a reverence for Optics and a reverence for certain things and the way they look then that's the kind of knowledge that puffs up but there's a kind of knowledge that's connected with the love of God that builds up so the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge the beginning of wisdom and knowing and this is just advancing a step further knowing this Foundation of knowledge I believe it's easier for us to appreciate the power of knowledge that when we speak of true knowledge and he that has a good understanding uh they do his Commandments and that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge that if I Fear God I reverence God I love God there's this kind of piety difference to him it's not it's not a dread it's not oh god he's a he's a fearsome God and he's a he's tough he's strict he's severe uh if you don't want to go to hell you better do what he says it's not that it's the reverence respect is to be in awe of him to have some man I love this guy and I I and I respect him and I it's that's the kind of feeling when you have this about God like man I love him I respect him I I'm in awe of him I acknowledge his greatness and his power there's a the fear of the Lord is the beginning of that knowledge if we if we if that's where knowledge is coming from then that tells us there's power to this knowledge and I'm going to start with uh this a scripture that just kind of kicks the door open on where I'm wanting to focus in Hosea 4:6 my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou Hast rejected knowledge I will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me I should mean something to us when we profess that we're going to be made Kings and Priests or that we are right now made Kings and Priests so there's a duty to a priest there's a duty in this priesthood says that you destroyed for a lack of knowledge so that's a statement that stands on its own and now he gets into this because you've rejected knowledge I'll reject you you will not be a priest to me seeing thou Hast forgotten the law of thy God I will also forget thy children woo because you have forgotten the law of God I will also forget thy children the Bible says in Psalms 1978 the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul The Testament of the Lord is sure making wise the simple this is what they rejected when they forgot the law of the Lord they forgot the very thing that's perfect and converts the soul the very thing that makes simple a wise the simple the statutes of the Lord are right rejoice in the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes this is what they had forsaken to say that they were destroyed for lack of of knowledge and because they rejected knowledge he rejects them they had forgotten the law of God therefore God says I'll forget your children I made you a promise there was something sure that if you would just pursue the word of God pursue the law of God there were certain promises attached to it but now you will be no priest to me and in Malachi 2:7 it says for the priest's lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts this is the responsibility of a priest which you ought to make yourself in type one where it says the priest lips should keep knowledge that means knowledge should be on your lips that's why we got to be so careful with what we repeat and the things we read the things we hear the things that's in the news the things that we share with other people the speculations we make about things and events and people because these lips ought to keep knowledge they should seek the law at his mouth because he's a messenger of the Lord of hosts and what God is rebuking even in Malachi and Hosea is is not not the children but the parents and the priesthood and those who ought to have kept the knowledge of God on their lips those who ought to have sought the the law of God out his mouth they had not done so they had rejected the word they had rejected knowledge my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge a lack of knowledge has nothing to do with just data but discernment the lack of knowledge here is perception they lacked WID wisdom the wisdom of Solomon was it to be able to say well there's a mom and a mom two alleged moms and one um one baby the the wisdom of Solon wasn't to tell you what was to read the room in the sense that well I got one here that does this and one that does that and this claiming this the wisdom of Solon was above and had an insight as to how he could provoke these two people in particular and knew it was discernment was it not discernment because there's certain situations where you could have a a mom who doesn't like their baby at all and one who does and and and is just trying to get rid of the baby and it's a big huge confusion he said well go ahead and cut the baby in half and the real mom says go for it right there had to be some wisdom on the situation which was discernment perception this is what it means to have the L knowledge of God or this lack of knowledge that's being called out here in Hosea is a lack of understanding and wisdom perception discernment knowledge isn't knowing information or facts but as I think as we've said this before it's the anal it's the the right kind of analysis to understand it you've got a lot of facts you got a lot of data and and I we could hand we can do your blood work and we could hand you all the results of the blood work and go okay well this is that and this is that and this is that and might even be able to tell it just by the way they do the chart that this is out of range and that's out of range and this is that way and that's that way but you'll still find that they have tools that analyze all that data to tell you whether or not there actually is a problem right because it's not just a matter of collecting the information but it's the analysis to understand it and then use it which is exactly what Paul is calling out in 1 Corinthians 8 he says we all have knowledge but you don't know how to use it we all have knowledge that about things sacrificed to Idols we know that it's not right we know there that we shouldn't do this we know we shouldn't do that but you use it carnally and you're going to do things to cause another brother to stumble and you're going to do things to cause some to offend somebody else and you're going to do this say you have no wisdom right right you have no real knowledge that's not just to know something but to actually understand the why in the use of something and he said and if I could put it this way it's the difference between data collection and data analytics and sister Morgan I cleared this with brother Michael before I used it uh he's our data analytics guy at least he presents himself as that he does a pretty good job but and the data collection it it concerns itself with collecting and measuring yes going to take the temperature we want to count the beans we want to and it's all about Gathering and and that's what it that's what it does data collection get the uh uh collect it collect it and now there has to be some a a way that your data collection is done the right way so that you know you're collecting the right kind of things if you're collecting beans you don't want to start counting rocks and so there is some there is some standards to that but that's not all that's meant in the knowledge of the lord it's not just collecting and measuring but there's the analytics which data analytics concerns itself with the analysis of it the interpretation of it to understand it in order to use it and and I think I wouldn't be dismissive of the collection part because as brother Michael pointed out to me that your analysis is only going to be as good as your collection but the collection could be perfect but without the analysis you don't get the use of it what does it mean to know that we've got this much and we've got that much and this is what it is and this is how we measure it and this is what was said you need the mind to come behind it to be able to know not what God Said but what he wants done with what he said because we have the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with his word not just to know what he said and to know what his word is but to know the use of it the application and the placing of it I I think I've seen this more and more how the people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge we got the message at our fingertips to be able to run it and search and run a quote to print out every quote print out you know copy and paste every quote into a digital document I what brother BR had to say about a particular instance or situation or teaching and we can know what he said but have no knowledge of how to practically apply that and what it ought to look like it says my people are destroyed means caus to cease means to perish to be cut off from God the the this the people are destroyed at the word picture that's formed in the Hebrews are read be brought to silence there's they're ineffective they can't they don't speak for God anymore there there the Hebrews were to be God's chosen people they they were people to look at them and think of their God yes and they were to express the one true God and their voice was to articulate the greatness of the one true God the way they live the way they acted where they live what they supported what they worshiped how they worship was to all declare the true God he says my people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge they've been brought to silence they profaned me with their lives their lives can no longer speak of my character what they pursue can no longer speak of my vision they're completely they've ceased to be what I've called them to be he says they're destroyed for lack of knowledge in Proverbs 1: 27 28 and 29 we're looking at the power wanting to appreciate the power of knowledge and maybe we're doing this by the inversion it says when your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me I'll just Ponder this for a little bit in that black and white and the font that I use which is what the highway system uses for their signs for easy reading little little inside information there my clear view font I think it's 2B or something like that but just look at this when fear come comes as desolation your destruction comes as a whirlwind your distress and anguish come upon you it's in this moment that we kind of expect then I will hear and I will rescue you and I will shelter you under my that's what we want to read he goes then shall they call upon me and I will not answer answer wouldn't that be a horrible typo he says I will not answer they shall seek me early isn't that what they're supposed to do but they shall not find me get that image in your mind right now and look at the condition of the people fears come as desolation destruction as a whirlwind distress and anguish are upon him and now what they ought to do is call upon him and what they should do is do it quick and do it early and God said I won't answer and you won't find me you want to know why in verse 29 for that they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the lord why did their Destruction come because they hated knowledge why did their desolation come because they hated knowledge why did they have distress and anguish because they hated knowledge and they did not choose to fear the lord that's why in their moment of distress oh now they want to call upon the Lord if I could say this your anxiety and your distress and your anguish and your desolation and destruction it it may come upon you but if it is upon you because you you didn't fear God that's what he's saying if you don't fear God and you hate knowledge that's when you're in trouble but if you have these things in your life if you fear God if you had love knowledge that's when he'll hear you that's when you seek him early you'll find them Hallelujah just invert the truth in this scripture when your fear comes on you and your Destruction come as a whirlwind and your distress and anguish come upon you will you when you call upon me I'll answer when you seek me early you'll find me because you love knowledge and you chose to fear me Hallelujah think of this and these scriptures speak of The Perils of ignorance never underestimate the devil's desire to keep you ignorant so he can just shove anything he wants down your throat and you'll just swallow it in the name of the message these scriptures are speaking about The Perils of ignorance the lack of knowledge creates a void that's only going to be filled by unrighteousness my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge watch how this chapter opens in hosiah 4: 1 and 2 hear the word of the Lord ye children of Israel for the Lord hath the controversy with the inhabitants of the land remember verse six says my people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge they rejected knowledge and they forgot the law and notice with the description because there is no truth nor Mercy nor knowledge of God In the Land by swearing and lying and killing and stealing and committing adultery they break out and blood toucheth blood these are the devastating effects of the lack of knowledge there's no truth no mercy no knowledge of God in the land therefore it's swearing lying killing stealing committing adultery there's a breaking out and blood toucheth blood the the this is the Perils of ignorance where there's ignorance where there's a lack of knowledge where there's not a love for knowledge and a choosing to fear the lord and I'm talking about the true knowledge this is what gives rise to these very things of swearing and lying and killing and stealing and committing adultery the lack of knowledge creates a void that Humanity will fill the lack of knowledge creates a Chasm that carnality will fill the lack of knowledge creates all these crevices and all these spots and all these holes and all these blind spots that the carnal mind wants to fill I believe I was I was fellowshipping with brother Andrew and then even felling with brother Paula Fontaine over the weekend on some of the same things and and how that it's man has a desire that if there's a loop we always want to close it right we don't like open-ended things we we want to explain things we want to close loops and sometimes it's just an insatiable appetite to be able to figure it all out and button it up and make clear things and the mind has got a really sneaky trick that it'll do that where there's a blank spot your mind will fill it in with the information that's around it thinking that's good enough that's what happens in your peripheral vision there's a blind spot in all of our eyes that there's actually there's no there's no sight whatsoever there your brain is receiving no information but your brain instead of just giving you a DOT fills in that spot with the information that's around it and I think a lot of people start to do that with the things of God they come to a blank spot and they just want to fill in the blank spot with all the information that's around it and they produce a picture in their mind and not the mind of God because in God there are no blank spots you may not see it all because he doesn't want to show it to you and just be happy with the spots you can't see and ask God to give you his mind that fills in the spots good because our carnal Minds when they're darkened and they're blackened something's going to fill it up and it's not it's it's it's usually not good but some what akin to this no Truth No Mercy swearing lying killing stealing committing adultery and break out Romans 1:21 I hope this isn't too much of a just of an outlier here but to me it just has a has the same emphasis because they that when they knew God so they have some knowledge right there's they knew God not that they had the mind of God but they knew God says they glorified him not as God neither were thankful this lack of gratitude and not glorifying him as God in beginning because that's where the fear of the Lord be is to glorify God to be gra this gratitude and the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge so they knew God but they did not begin in the fear of God therefore they never had true knowledge of God but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened it's through the lack of knowledge what's next when they when you know God but you do not fear God then it produces vain imaginations and your Foolish Heart Is darkened and so through the lack of knowledge or Not a Love of the truth that vanity comes in pride comes in a man is driven by prideful ambition he's driven by his emotions he's driven by pretense he's driven by all these other things and he'll present a certain way and it doesn't mean he has to be swear and lying stealing and committing adultery literally in the flesh but he can have all those same markers spiritually all those same markers in other subtle ways why because the mind is not full of the knowledge of God but it's filled in all the blank spots en closed all the loops in a carnal mind and now it's chasing after things and has an agenda that's not pure you can kind of track the Thessalonians and the having received the love of the truth to love truth it's the fear of God and God being truth that there's this there's this love the seeking after it we should seek the law at his mouth we should our lips should keep kn knowledge it's the the law of the Lord the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes this is what they've rejected so their imaginations become Vain and their foolish heart is darkened there's no Enlightenment there in Isaiah chapter 60 verse two I'm referring to this just knowing that you all are such a privilege to preach to such uh mature message Believers have had decades on in good teaching and in the message of the hour so you'll know just how important this scripture is cuz verse one is arise Shine for thy light is come and verse two for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people now I'm drawing from uh there's a man here who can turn on the light the Shalom sermons and those different places there at the end of 63 and beginning of 64 even preached right here in Arizona uh and Phoenix these different things where he's talking about this the scripture and he's making it relevant to the end time and he's speaking about how Darkness has covered the Earth and gross Darkness has covered the people so there's a spiritual Darkness upon the Earth but an even greater darkness in the people that's right and it's a darkness of spiritual understanding he's telling us he pointing us out that there's a there's been a there's a there's a lack of an understanding of the word of God and because they do not understand the word of God because if we get back on it they do not fear God therefore they do not know God therefore they do not understand God therefore they do not know his will and it just leads to chaos right even if it's religion it leads to chaos even if they're trying to be spiritual it leads to car ity because they haven't begun in the fear of the Lord because they have not kept knowledge with their lips because they have not sought the word at his mouth because the word isn't what has preeminence because they don't believe it's the word and the word only they got to fill it in with other things and in filling in with other things it leads to carnality it leads to chaos it leads to spiritual adultery in a lot of cases it leads to the actual adultery and it leads to worldliness and letting go of the standards and things because they put up a different kind of image of what it's supposed to be and they don't have the life behind it this is exactly what brother Bram is calling out in the church world at this time and he says in the message Shalom he says the church ages are fading out God has pressing the darkness into a place it has to do it to fade out the church organizations Fade Out the world I love that CU think of this he says the world is covering the thing over and worldism has took the whole thing then isn't God right by worldly things and worldly dressing and worldly acting and worldly living it's the world this is what's happening in the church brother br's diagnosing this a prophet's telling us what's happened he's saying Darkness covers the earth gross Darkness the people it settled into the church Le DEA is Darkness he's referring to Revelations chapter 3 it's gross Darkness upon the people the the the the the light has been blackened out there's no more light left in the church Christ has been rejected Christ has been put out it's Darkness it's chaos it's descended into the pit and brother tells us all these things that are happening all the while they are the church is continuing to worship God they're still going to church they're still preaching Jesus Christ the Pentecost are still baptizing in Jesus name it's not that they've rejected religion and they've rejected the name they're continuing on but brother and sister look at them it's worldly look at the worldliness look at the darkness look at the darkness and he's calling it out and it's because the gross Darkness is the result of a vain imagination we can bring it's because they had rejected Christ but he says you are not of the world Little Children You are of Heaven this is not your home this sin loving world this church World these these organizations these religions all these things all the carnality all the pretense all the pride all the darkness all the worldism that's not your home he says you are of heaven and I love this he says God is pressing the darkness to a place to fade out the world think of that he's pressing the darkness to a place to fade out the world that's what God's wanting to do in your life he's pressing aside the darkness to fade out the world press it away press it away press it away than you Lord they had rejected him we're anointed by accepting him and they had rejected him what is it result in the increase of sin why why is it so bad in Leo deia they rejected Christ right they rejected knowledge they rejected him so it leads to wickedness and sin job CH 28: 28 and unto man he said behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom and to depart from Evil is understanding that that's a good that's a good summing isn't it the fear of the Lord that's Wis wisdom you want to know who's wise somebody who reverences God somebody who fears God respects his word somebody who looks at the word of God and says you know what I I wouldn't want to transgress that I wouldn't want to take away from that I wouldn't want to add to that I wouldn't want to make them fight each other that that's that that's when someone has some wisdom is they fear the Lord amen and they trust God yes there's a lot of things that happen remember one time a brother shared with me know kind of his reasons for something and his I guess I could just be real open and honest CU it's not like anyone of you would know who I'm talking about but he he basically was wanting to reject the principle of predestination because how much people misused it I don't like how people misuse predestination they just use predestination as an excuse and and and that's somebody looking at a problem and saying wow here's a truth of God and people are abusing it and misusing it now this is just me all right but wisdom would be like that's wrong but the word's right they're wrong to misuse it but the word's right and I just have to trust God that his word is the way that it is and if people misunderstand it he'll deal with their hearts appropriately and whatever I can do to lift up the truth of that to help them to understand it and see it that would be wisdom now this is just me talking to me what's not wisdom is to say oh you're going to misuse it well then there's no such thing as predestination right right to completely just change it because the way people are abusing it and do that with any Doctrine in the word of God say oh I don't like the way what people have made out of it well look what they've made out of Christ look what they've made out of Christ do we do away with him because of the nonsense no we appreciate the truth of it more look what they've made out of the message look how they've crucified the word again are we ashamed of it no do we try to change it would we reject it no why because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom to fear God that is wisdom and to depart from Evil is understanding I I think there's a it's kind of just what's in the maybe The Ether here for me as I digest these things that just that simple Christian Life can be so devalued where it's like ah well you know that's just the that's legalism that's Clos line you know what does that matter and I'm just being and I think I have I've been repeating this theme quite a bit in this series so it's not like this is something new but how we live how we act how we treat one another how we love our our wives and and how we pay our bills and and pay our taxes and all just honesty and decent living and cleanliness and applying the token and Holiness and modesty all those things these things matter we should know enough to know it's not just if we do all that we're right but if we have the Holy Ghost shouldn't we do that shouldn't we do do it and then to distill it down to where we're kind of bottling up the bride's uh uh interaction with the word of God down to a church service and what takes place between be among four walls fine kick the walls down and do it out in the parking lot that's still not it that's still not it and we so trivialized the life behind it we can't do that because to depart from Evil that's understanding Bible tells us to good understanding have all they that do his Commandments should we not with all our getting get understanding yes does it make a little bit of sense now why the proverb would tell you with all your getting get understanding why because to depart from Evil is understanding with all my getting the more understanding I get the less evil has hold over me ow if I could just take a step further then they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain this ISS Isaiah 11:9 for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea so the Earth is full of the knowledge of the lord we just took some time beginning with the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge and how the lack of knowledge causes sin could I summarize the last whatever however minutes that was 30 minutes in that way the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge so that's knowledge and knowledge the lack of knowledge causes sin yes wickedness lying stealing all these things all the depravity and now the the scripture says the Earth Earth is full of the knowledge of the Lord the Earth is full of the knowledge of the Lord that has a consequence but let's look at how this happens look at Isaiah 11 verse1 I'm going to go through this quickly and if the Lord wants us to go into this a little bit more which is a lot here to do we'll do but I just want to bring out something very simple in this in this closing thought and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and the branch shall grow out of his roots remember what we read in verse 10 these are the book ends then to everything we're reading between verse two and verse 9 verse 9 the Earth shall be full the knowledge of the Lord as the waters covers the sea and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ins sign of the people to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious so now it's this is where it begins that's kind of a book in that creates a beautiful little framed picture for us to look at and there shall come forth a rock out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots to look at this fulfillment in d uh in Jesus Christ as the throne had been vacant for the the family of Jesse that there's a lot of truth that we could bring out in that season in that time but this is speaking of the Messiah King it's speaking of Jesus Christ The Royal authority of the House of David but the Bible doesn't say a out of the stem of David cuz David was a king uh David as a king as a prophet King as one that they all look to that that's high Authority and that would speak of royalty and that would speak of greatness that would speak of the throne out of the stem of David well that would be an heir of David would be the rightful Heir but notice the character of the Messiah is humble first humble and so it doesn't say from the House of David but from the the stem of Jesse to identify the humble character that the Messiah would come in not first identifying him with the throne but a stump yeah of the House of Jesse a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him and notice the TR pay attention to the true character of the influence of the spirit of the Lord if we say the spirit of the Lord is upon me I'm in the spirit of the Lord the spirit of the Lord is manifested himself where the spirit of the Lord is now think of that where the spirit of the Lord is and where we talk about the spirit of the Lord the spirit of the Lord the spirit the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him and now it's basically defin it the spirit of wisdom and understanding what's the spirit of the Lord the spirit of wisdom and understanding what is the spirit of the Lord the spirit of counsel and might what is the spirit of the Lord the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord this is the spirit of the Lord this is where we would want it to manifest most supremely I I I've been studying on so many things maybe things certain things are spilling out but there's been a particular subject I've been studying on because there's ways that we can we want to be very very careful that when the spirit of the Lord moves and I'm going to say this definiely when the spirit of the Lord moves people can shout people can dance people will dance people will shout the spirit of the Lord caus people to speak in tongues real true genuine Spirit of the Lord be careful what you say about it because the when the spirit Lord and listen we're not talking Pentecost this this is what the spirit of God has done from the beginning the Holy Spirit caused miam to dance the Holy Spirit caused David to dance that has nothing to do with Pentecost has nothing to do with the day of Pentecost which was a new birth that's what the spirit of the Lord does so that's things that people can enjoy if they want to right but just because you see that isn't that a Vindication that someone's filled with the Holy Ghost nor does it always mean that it is the Holy Ghost because brother says I've seen naked heathen do the same thing amen I know I'm I'm making it maybe controversial making some people uneasy but I'm wanting to at least point you to to the real evidence of the spirit of the Lord the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord the Bible says in Zechariah not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts what is the spirit of the lord it's the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord this is the spirit that's now resting upon the Messiah because we're looking at the whole Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord how is the earth going to be full of the knowledge of the Lord it begins with Christ the Messiah the king and shall make him of quick understanding the fear of the Lord now we're looking at his character and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither we prove after the hearing of his ears so it's not carnal understand it's not carnal wisdom it's the spirit of the Lord that's got discernment just as a man judges by the outward appearance but God weighs the heart but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the Earth for he shall Smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked what is this speaking of the word of God the word of God and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his Reigns this is how the world is brought into this glorious condition this kind of authority this kind of King this kind of one that's ruling and reigning if I could even speculate this that had Adam not followed even the transgression that there could have been an Eden that persisted and so now as we come to this picture and it begins to describe an Eden condition there's one who cannot fall there's one who has the spirit of God who has the spirit of counsel and might who has the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of knowledge of the fear of the Lord who has a quick understanding of the fear of the Lord who judges not after the eyesight in the Optics who reproves not after the sounding in his ears but with righteousness he judges in habac 2: 12 13 and 14 well to him that builth a town with blood and establishthedeen look at the condition look at the glory look at the Splendor look at the magnitude look at how beautiful it is and I says well to him that build a town with blood established a city by iniquity the New Jerusalem isn't established by iniquity sir that this town is not established by Blood behold it is not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labor in the very fire and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity there's a lot being said there says for the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the Waters cover the sea it's a knowledge of the glory of the Lord that's going to establish this Condition it's the knowledge of the glory of the Lord that builds the city it's the knowledge of the Lord Lord that builds the town not with the blood of man but has been established by that which the blood of God purchased and watch how the scripture unfolding through Isaiah we see these glimpses in these other chapters of the Bible verse 6 the wolf also shall dwell with the the lamb huh and the leopard shall lie down with the kid what and the calf of the Young Lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them a lion's going to eat hay with an ox a child's going to play at the opening of a deadly Viper we the fear is gone right there there's there's no there there all these things the images that begin to come out of these scriptures I want you to catch this and I'm just going to close with this kind of this pack this in here under the reign of the king of righteousness all Natures changed peace peace Reigns because of the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord that the the lion will lay down with the lamb we see that the the the leopard and the kid you anytime you see see a leopard uh with a kid he's up in a tree tree the goat right he's going to he's going to take that thing up into a tree he's going to eat that there there's but now you're talking about they're on the ground together hanging out if you can get this image in our minds I know that we think about these things we hear these things maybe we even sing about it it's poetry to us but this is the power of the spirit this is the real power of the spirit right here and when you begin to see Natures are changed and things are getting along that normally wouldn't and things that had been upset from the beginning now man is not afraid man is not the predator who's who's looking after prey the kid is not prey to the leopard the lion is eating is not eating meat it's eating straw think about this image Nature has completely changed Harmony's been brought back order has been brought back there's nothing Topsy Turvy nothing Ru you don't have a king of the jungle you have the king of the earth that now's reigning Supreme good it's the power of the spirit that's the power that brings the per Perfection that's why the Bible says they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain why for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters covers to see I hope this could I want you to see it I want you to see it with eyes of faith I want you to be able to picture this even in your mind's eye all wickedness and evil is held at Bay nowhere it's bound all that is displeasing remember hurt and destroy what we read in the beginning all that is displeasing all that is ous is put down all corruption all perversion every Power to spoil every corrupting influence is no longer working anything that spoils is no longer effective it's not that the Lion's going to have a muzzle it's not that the leopard's going to change his spots but something's changed all things Unholy all things unkind all things things unhappy stem from the lack of the knowledge of God all things impure all things Wicked all things Evil all come from a lack of God's knowledge it all comes from ignorance but here there'll be no unkind word no selfish deed no destruction of property no Wars no taking of life because the spirit of the Lord is gonna rest and he's gonna reign in the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord in this reign of righteousness and peace I don't know if you caught it but it's not describing Revelations 21 do you recognize this yet you mean I've been able to hide it to this point he not talking about the Eighth Day it's not talking about Revelations 21 it's not talking about the Earth after its last stage of redemption but it's talking about the Millennium in Revelations 20:6 blessed and holy is he that hath part of in this first resurrection on such the second death hath no power not forboding it's not dread but they shall be priests they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years I just described you in the beginning of re Isaiah 11 the reign of the Messi now you're a priest with him now you're a king with him and you are going to Reign Hallelujah a thousand years and it's during this rain that we see the change of nature it's during this rain we see all things perverse all things unkind all things Unholy held it Bay there will be a kingdom of knowledge there will be a kingdom of glory and it's before the Earth's final stage of redemption I hope you're catching this before the Earth's final stage of redemption therefore I believe that as we can see that in type for the Earth that the believer now can be full of the knowledge of the Lord the believer now can be full of the glory of the Lord if God will bring the Earth to a millennial condition before that baptism of fire changes the Earth's body then God can do the same for us now that all things that hurt and Destroy can be subdued so that peace can rign for the Bible says in Proverbs chap 24:5 a wise man is strong yeah or yay a man of knowledge increaseth strength this is why I say knowledge is power this very verse right here A wise man is strong yay a man of knowledge increaseth strength I read it in I think 30 different translations you want me to read them all so I think someone said no so I won't I'll maybe read 18 how's that maybe 12 and all the translations it's rendered it basically the same a wise man is strong a wise man is strong wise man is strong wise man is strong a wise Warriors in strength Mighty is the wise of strength a wise man is strong a man of knowledge increases strength think of how I saying it a man of knowledge increases strength a man of knowledge increases might a man of man of knowledge makes strength greater a man of understanding increases strength the man of knowledge strengthens power revelation and knowledge increases strength in one translation wisdom brings strength and knowledge gives power the very atmology of the phrase knowledge is power and though they attribute it to different ones became quite common with Thomas Jefferson I think Francis Bacon may be one who quoted it but I think it was even someone that he learned from that originally maybe it begins but it comes back to the scripture right that when they try to track it down where would have they come up with this idea that knowledge is power all you got to do is go to Proverbs 24:5 a man of knowledge increases strength that knowledge gives power knowledge is empowering brother BR even says it this way we don't lack power we lack knowledge we lack Faith you got power but what's he saying you've got power but it lays dormant until there's knowledge there to use it so knowledge gives power its strength knowledge is empowering to power knowledge is power for your power however you want to look at it that you can sleep at night and be at peace what your pastor preached today whatever you need to do to make sense of it I don't mind just know that in knowing him there's power that knowledge is power that sometimes we can have uh we can have a lot of power by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have power but we need Faith to use that power we need that knowledge to unlock that power not M mental knowledge not by might not by power in a carnal sense but by a Spirit by his Spirit sayith the Lord knowledge is empowering I I've been kind of sitting on this for a while now but a family testified a sister in the church testified to my wife just the mighty things that God was doing in their family and just how how amazing it was and and I got permission to use this I'm not I just it's it's been inspiring me ever since and and she testified about what God's doing in their family and made this comment if this is what God would do when we were clueless I think about that now let's get real think about what he did for us when we had no idea we we we didn't know it wasn't like well Lord really what I need for you to do if you'll just listen to me kind of what we do to our doctors sometime right we just tell him what treatment we need just write me a script doctor I think this is what it is and there's a paradigm that they follow and they do it for a good reason but we we we just want to go ahead and tell God what we need and we're completely clueless even at a point to where we didn't even really think L we could think about when we were saved we didn't really know how much we needed God right it wasn't like we could go to God and quantify and say well I need you because this is what's going to happen that's going to happen God's like oh my goodness I had no idea I better save you real quick but if God would do it she says when we were clueless of how much we needed him and this is a part that inspired me there was this recognition that God does things when we're ignorant God does things for us when we're cluess when we did not know him when we were aranged from him when we didn't know his he yet loved us still when we ran from he chased us when he did it when we were closed she said how much more will he do when our hearts are hungering and thirsting for the righteous fruit of his word in our hearts and lives think of that if he did that for you when you were cless how much more can he do for you when you're seeking it if he does it for you and you didn't know how much more when you do know how much more when you're hungry Hallelujah musicians if you'd come the Bible says in Colossians 3:15 and let the peace of God rule in your hearts the Bible says that that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith says for he must Reign there's the throne it's in you and maybe I'll take some more time on this subject I I feel I'm very near maybe in my heart in terms of where the series is going but if one day the Earth Revelations 21 after its baptism of fire is going to be in a glorious condition never will be death sin nothing think of all those scriptures nothing to defile no lying cheating stealing nothing no up and down no in and out Perfection forever the perfect Kingdom it's ushered in permanently forever that's going to happen after the Earth receives its baptism of the Holy Ghost then what about you what about you before your body's changed the Earth's going to have its Millennium before its body's changed what about you yeah what about I'm talking about I'm not talking about the Earth but I'm talking about you about in your heart right now with the king of righteousness ruling and reigning in your hearts can not the peace of God rule is not the spirit of God able to put down everything that's unkind Unholy unruly disciplined is it able oh brother Aaron you're making me nervous cuz I'm going to have to live a perfect life and if I ever make a aake no uh that's not it at all I mean even after the Millennium you got to deal with sin you got to deal with death you got to button it all up you got to take care of it but we're just talking about an acknowledgement right now that the power of God that's on the inside of you right now is able to subdue every fear every doubt every sin every weakness and to have the kind of confidence to know that to the extent that sickness is not put down God must have a reason for it am to the extent that this something's taking place and things aren't changing I seek and pursue to humble myself to make sure that I'm in the right place with God I'm checking his word I'm I'm living the life I'm I'm doing everything I know is right I just trust him all the more that he's going to turn this all out right and how do we know cuz look what the Millennium is going to be after all the nonsense 6,000 years before look what eternity is going to be after everything that took place before God is able amen and if God will do the things he's done for us when we didn't know when we didn't know what to ask when we didn't know what to think when we didn't know what he would do we didn't know what the word said but how much more can he when we know I pray that you'd be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding you find that the very language that Paul is using in the scripture is essentially taking the very description of the Messiah where in the spirit of God will rest upon him in the spirit of wisdom and understand the spirit of counsel and might and the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord that Paul is basically preaching that same message over the elect and brother Brandon preached the same message over the elect to dress her in that to clothe Us in that and the he says that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work The Perils of ignorance is sin distrust disloyalty failure wickedness but the power of knowledge is righteousness and the knowledge of the Holy that that's understanding to depart from Evil that's understanding I pray that the Lord will give you strength today we can be honest with ourselves honest with each other there's times we have settings where we can Fellowship we're honest with one another it's easy when I'm the only one facing you and you're you're just looking at me and we're not really conscious about everything that's going in the room we can think about things in a very isolated uh insulated way and maybe it discourages you a little bit maybe it scares you a little bit but we could all be honest with ourselves these are difficult times these are Troublesome times there's a lot of stuff that's going on in the world a lot of stuff going on socially a lot of stuff going on even in the message that's just trying to Rattle to shake and to unnerve people but listen he's here he's got it all in control and when the Bible says let the peace of God rule in your hearts it means let him control let the peace of God control let him who is the king of righteousness just let him Reign amen I'm not I'm not praying it for a millennium it'll come God prophesied it I'm not praying it for the eighth day it's going to come nothing's going to stop it but I can be in the way right now of a millennial peace rising up brother Bram begins to preach a day new day is Dawning a new day is Dawning I can feel it bubbling over I feel it pouring over me right now in your hearts just purpose in your heart I'm going to let you rain Lord I want you to rain Supreme I want you to have preeminence and let the peace of God control you from the control tower stand with me today
