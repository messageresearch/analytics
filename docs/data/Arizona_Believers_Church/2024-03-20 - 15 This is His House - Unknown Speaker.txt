TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just uh request your prayer tonight that you be attentive I know that Wednesday nights can be difficult for a number of different reasons but God bless you for laboring to come to sacrifice especially the families with children who've been sitting still all day long in school and whether you homeschool or they go to school they're told to sit still and you drive a long ways to come and be in the house of the Lord and there's a lot of sitting still and now you want them to be quiet and stay awake for the the next hour or so so I know it's difficult but I believe your your efforts and your labors to be here this evening are work worth it your uh it'll pay div dividends down the road as as we've been speaking on the subject of the house of the Lord tonight I want to take the title of this is his house and I just felt I was going to be ministering more on where we had been on the man of the house and the foundational principle of headship but I just want to kind of stay in that vein that we were in an Out of the Dust and into heaven just along the lines of encouraging you and I want to take some time tonight in the outset just to go go back over several scriptures I think that we've been over already and that were just this last Sunday but in doing so it's just to lay a little bit of a foundation and come to a point in it that I trust will motivate you and encourage you in Isaiah chapter 28 verse 16 it says therefore thus saith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation stone and so it's a founding Stone this foundation stone that is going to be laid is a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation those are the characteristics of this foundation and God wants you to know that I'm going to lay this corner this founding Stone it's going to be tried it's going to be precious it's going to be sure and he that believeth uh he that believeth shall not make haste shall not be confounded will not be ashamed so there's a lot uh that that foundation and that Cornerstone gives to somebody who will believe and when it says I will lay for a foundation stone it could even be said for a beginning Stone when I begin this I'm going to lay a stone and we know that Jesus Christ is the foundation stone you didn't learn that this past Sunday I only repeated it to you but we know that Jesus Christ is the foundation stone and he is a sure Foundation it is a a a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone it says a sure foundation so I in the beginning I'm going to lay a stone and this is going to be a secure beginning and I'm going to secure things in the beginning by the way that I start and I hope that's something that uh kind of holds in your minds I got some feedback by way of telephone the game of telephone today uh that really encouraged me my son ellot uh was the first to share things with me on Sunday just how much he enjoyed the service it was all I needed to hear to be encouraged he had some just real wonderful things to say and to express so I was real encouraged then just today some things were shared with me and I could see that there was those that were really thinking about what God was expressing and that there's this is leading to something and it certainly is and that's something to think about that in the beginning I'm laying a stone and I'm securing things at that very moment even though you don't see it now I'm securing for the future now and as we look at Jesus Christ as this foundation stone kind of the thought that I thought I would build a little bit tonight uh but I'm just moving a little bit away from it is a firm foundation having a a firm foundation and in 1 Corinthians chapter 3:1 it says for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ amen so there is no other Foundation I if there is another Foundation it's not a good beginning it won't last it won't remain so there's only one tried Stone there's only one precious Cornerstone there's only one firm foundation or sure foundation and that is Jesus Christ that's the one that every single individual must be built upon every individual must be built upon this if you had a church and it doesn't matter how wealthy the church was no matter how faithful the church members were no matter how big and everything you could have a big million church members like McDonald's does but if they don't have a foundation themselves that's a weak church because the individuals have to have their own Foundation because they become the very uh Bedrock of the church the individuals doing the same goes for your families and your marriages and the relationships that you have in the sermon God's only provided place of worship and I just found a lot of instances where brother bram's talking about foundations in this and Capstone even in this particular uh subject that that he administered on a few times says and the name is and the name is in the word because he is the word amen what is he then I love this statement the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God so when you hear about the name of God the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God so God interprets his word by bringing it to pass the the interpretation is the Vindication and he's saying that this word when it comes to pass that's the manifestation of the name of God not just saying Jesus but it's the word being expressed that is the name and the character of God he says no wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who I am and Upon This Rock I'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down he says amen and he says oh Living Church of God stand in firm foundation on Jesus Christ alone that's the one place you know you're secure when you're stand standing on the word of God the word of God that's been brought to pass the manifestation of the name of God stand in firm foundation on Jesus Christ Alone he says you can sing the song but if you're not on Christ the word you're on teetering faulty faltering sand but Upon This Rock Christ my word you might sing on Christ the solid rock I stand but unless you actually are you are on sinking sand he calls it teetering faltering green sand you may call It Rock You may call it sure you may say well this will work but no you can't Upon This Rock Christ my word you've got to be standing that's what the Church of the Living God is built upon well that's I recognize just uh and I'm sure that you do as well I'm just kind of repeating myself uh from even Sunday but boy it feels good to know that we have a firm foundation now in Zechariah Chapter 4:9 it says the hands of zerubba have laid the foundation of this house and it says also his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you when it says the hands of Zer rubbable we know there's prophecy contained in this there's actually some historical touching points but prophecy of even Christ and it says it's laid the foundation and I I want to even say it this way he's laid the foundation and His Hands shall also also finish it so the foundation is just the beginning you say he's laid the beginning of this house I I lay in Zion for a beginning a stone so this Foundation is the basis or we could even say the Baseline in some ways and it has the purpose of supporting a super structure brother Brandon uses that language in the church age book and the writing of the church age book and how the pillars in the house of God are part of the foundation for they uphold and they support the super structure and the super structure is that part of the building that is above the foundation it's a super structure it's the structure above the foundation and so the structure it's the structure that is built or supera super above or on top of a foundation so when you say a a foundation foundations speak of Beginnings when it doesn't say behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone and it's like ah yeah rub that see then ain't that nice isn't that smooth it's I do it for a beginning so it means it's the start of something and so a foundations speak of Beginnings it declares in it to say that there's a foundation is immediately a signal that ah there's more than just the base this is the Bas line this is the beginning this is marking out H H the Bedrock the the territory the structure the the meats and Bounds of it this is going to tell us a little bit about what it's going to look like so there there's more to be built there's more to come because he says the hands of zerubabel have laid the beginning this founding Stone of this house but he's also going to finish which means complete it he's going to accomplish what he set out to accomplish and we know that according to Zachariah that it's The Headstone that is the finishing it's the cap it's the finishing off of the house so the house will be built God is going to build the house Jesus said destroy this temple in three days I'll build it up again speaking of this own self and and yet it speaks of even the restoration of the temple the house will be built and it saying and it speaks to how how the foundation stone we looked at this on Sunday it will become the Capstone Jesus Christ the Chief Cornerstone That Base even that that most critical element to the building they reject the uh the Cornerstone and in rejecting the Cornerstone they reject The Headstone Psalms 18:22 the stone which the builders refused is become The Headstone of the corner a stone that was refused as a Cornerstone may find place somewhere in the structure but for to ever be used as the capping stone that doesn't work at all if you to reject it as a Cornerstone it's not fit it's not fit for a crowning that's not fit for that but it's saying this very one that's refused who came to his own and was rejected Christ who was the Chief Cornerstone the founding Stone he's going to be the finishing Stone the Capstone and the climax to whatever he's building it says it is become That's The Headstone or that Capstone we looked at how that was prophecy and so the Capstone is Christ again I think the way I said it on Sunday is if you're ever going to be the head you got to First be the floor we we like to think of ourselves as the the the head but if if you want to be a good head you better have a good foundation so it's that final piece of perfecting or finishing the house oh as we've already read a few verses to you already and we want to turn to Matthew 16:1 18 I want to express don't let these verses be common to you I know I may repeat them a lot and if in some ways I'm just trying to cover my own complexes I still think it's worth considering uh what's being said and don't let them become common do not undervalue them and our desire would be that they would uh through Revelation be made alive to us I know this I've heard this it's a revelation to me but I just think there's always greater depths that we could enter into on things that even uh have repetition to us in the word of God as brother brandom already alluded to these scriptures flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but he says Upon This Rock I'll build my place of worship he says in Matthew 16 18 I say also unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so much that we could say about the stone the rock the foundation of Revelation but it's the it's the statement I will build my church upon this foundation stone I will lay in Zion for a beginning of stone tried Stone precious stone sure Stone there's no other Foundation that could be laid there's no other beginning than Jesus Christ and the hands have laid the beginning of this house and the stone which the builders refus is not only just the the Cornerstone but it will be the The Headstone it will be the Capstone but he says I I will build my church we know that this prophesies of the Bride of Jesus Christ he said I'm going to have a church which the Bible shows us by Revelation as Paul teaches it that this church is his body of which he is the head and so this is Christ I he says I will build my church so it's him building it's his church as we've read already in Ephesians chapter 2: 20 21 and 22 I say already but just recently and we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone so this is our foundation in whom all the building now that's the one building all of that building fitly framed together grow unto a holy Temple in the Lord this is what this is such a beautiful language you have a foundation which is Jesus Christ and then there's a super structure and this whole building is framed together and as it's framed together it grows into it increases to the Temple of the Lord to the house of the Lord you are a stone you are a pillar in the house of the Lord you are part of that that that manifestation of the name of God that place of worship that chosen place of worship in verse 22 in whom ye also are builded together for in habitation of God through the spirit your body is a temple of the Lord you are a stone in this Temple whether you want to look at yourself individually as a house of the Lord you are that house then as a part of that you are in the big picture part of this habitation of God you are part of that building I will build my church the foundation is Jesus Christ then there is a building that that is fitly framed together and it grows to the house of the Lord it's built together for the habitation of God as Peter says in 1 Peter 25 ye also as Lively stones are built upon built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up Sac spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ and he wouldn't build up a spiritual house unless he began with a stone a precious stone a foundation so he says I will build so this is the work that he is personally undertaking the the foundation the fit framing the the building the growing is something he does so when he says I've laid a foundation well we we can see the foundation and we accept that it's Jesus Christ and then maybe we see that the capstone's coming he says he's the alpha he's the Omega he's the perfect Foundation he's the perfect Capstone and then we look at the message and we see a load of building materials like well I've got to somehow take all this this Lumber and all this wood and build the house that he can come settle on and uh let's just let's just go get a tent right let's just forget about it but it's him that is building this is his building now I say that but then I also want to orient ourselves to our responsibility because we're talking about the man of the home we're talking about ourselves being uh uh the heads of households and the wives respecting their husbands and all these different things that start coming into view and I said this is a huge task it's a great work that we've been asked to do there's scriptures that we know pertain to us personally there's standards that we see in the word of God that we desire we sincerely desire to meet and so it's a tremendous labor to be the Shepherd in a home that's a big ask as we mentioned before uh recently to be the Watchman in the house the one who's up a little bit higher the one that's supposed to see things coming into the home and all of a sudden you find out one day that your kids are chatting on Reese's and you're like I don't need even know what a recus is when it comes to chatting like there's things that are evolving and things that are turning and Technology that's entering in and there's ways uh to communicate with the world there's ways to do things uh even to where uh there's there's stimulants and there's drugs and there's things that can excite and entice there's all sorts of things out there and you're supposed to be a Watchman in the home making sure that the token is applied say man it's tough being a Watchman it's difficult to be the shepherd it's difficult to be a priest in the home I guess it' kind of be nice to be able to just say wow that's the pastor he's the one that's ordained to see you through as long as we just go to church and pay our ties and he's living a holy life if we can just to the line when it comes to going to church we're going to be all right but listen that's not it at all that's not it at all and it's the reality that that's not it makes what I do even more important because I'm trying to support those that are trying to be Shepherds trying to support those that are trying to be priests I'm trying to support sisters who are trying to be the Fifth Gospel and walk in harmony with their husbands and you real that's that's where the rubber meets the road that's where the payment comes and so you've got to be sure that you're meeting the Mark here or it makes it much harder to meet it there and so I recognize this as a great task I realize as it's been mentioned to me quite a bit lately just how challenging some of these services are and it is challenging and it ought to be challenging I I I might be a little bit worried if people just walking out going well I've got that licked I I think it's good to kind of feel like more that we got right now that put me in my place it's good it's good to be challenged but don't forget this is his house that that there is a there is a foundation that's been laid and there's a perfect campstone that's coming and there's a lot of really good material that we see in the word of God but you're not doing this on your own you're not left to build the superstructure on your own if anything and maybe I'm giving really what's in my heart away I don't know if I'll come to it at the end but really you just need to get out of the way and be a bu be a material that he uses to build it up God is the one that's building and making you says in Ephesians chap 2:10 we are his workmanship created or made in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them if it's a good work if it's a good building if it's a good growing if it's if it's something that's being edified you've been ordained to it already made in Christ Jesus for we are his workmanship you are the thing that is made you are the works of God as a creator that's why you're called New Creations so we we ourselves as we look at ourselves we say well I want to be the house of God well I'm on a firm foundation you're going to build yourself up brother Brandon when he preaches the statue of a perfect man he says you don't add nothing you see the danger of saying well you've got faith now make yourself into the perfect man and then he'll cap you go ahead and add add add yourself and then he's going to give you the Seal of the Holy Ghost there's a real danger in not getting that teaching right he says don't add nothing he said that would be like a blackbird putting peacock feathers in himself you have the life and it's the nature of the Holy Ghost to add to to add to and to grow you are his workmanship in Isaiah chapter 64:8 but now now oh Lord Thou Art Our Father we are the clay Thou Art our Potter and we are we all are the work of thy hand I want to be with wants me to be make me what you want me to be you're you're the I'm the I'm just the clay I I don't have I don't have the vision I don't have the mind I don't have the tools of the resources to make myself into something I'm your clay You Are The Potter I Am the work of your hand I'm going to yield to the Master's Hand you are our father says in Psalms 103 know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture I feel that if we could revisit this just as a church family tonight that we are his workmanship that me as an individual that I whether I'm a husband or a father or a mechanic or I'm a laborer what whatever the thing calling may be as a man if you're a housewife you're stay-at-home mother maybe work from home as a mother you maybe you work out of the home as a mother whatever you are in life is you look at your own individual challenges and I want to be a Christian I want to be a good representation of the word of God I want to I I want to be a light to others I want to see soul safy my own witness and testimony what whatever burden you might have to to be a Christian and overcome your past and overcome Temptation I want you to recognize that in your own spiritual growth he's the one that's wanting to develop you that you as an individual are a the object of his desire and he's not saying I saved you and now that I've saved you make yourself out of something and why don't you do something with the message that I gave you why are you wasting this salvation and you're a sorry excuse for a bunch of message Believers no if anything he's disappointed when we try to make ourselves it's only when we're trying to make ourselves he's like Ah that's not going to work he's like let me help you why don't you just let me help you he wants to help us I think it's just one of those things I I accept that it's actually a great Paradox but spiritual maturity is evidenced by the more you depend upon Him whereas it's kind of the reverse when we look at it in humanity we're like well the more mature our kids are the more independent they become more responsible they are on their own the more that they take initiative but really it's almost as if God is looking it in the inversion that our spiritual maturity is dictated by coming to a greater dependence and it's full maturity when you come to Absolute Total dependence could it be that we need to be depending upon him from start to finish that at no point we say oh perfect Foundation Lord that's awesome I got it from here but it's a it's a yielding to him in recognizing I am his workmanship and become and and it's not that and we're coming to this here in a moment it's not that we become uh Spectators in it but we recognize that we are this is a joint venture together that we are in this together with him and I'm an active participant in what he's doing Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ I want to ask you I I mean this as a personal directive to everybody here I want to ask you do you believe he has begun a good work in you whether Philip raises his hand every hands are being raised do you really believe it do you believe he's begun a good work in you if maybe you don't even feel that you have the Holy Ghost do you believe that there's something a seed in you there's a desire that there's something that's begun that if he has begun it he's telling you now what I start I finish I will not have any unfinished product projects in in in in my man cave I won't have jobs half finished there won't be a house on the side of the road like look they they he didn't finish the house he didn't build it yeah that one's been that way for weeks they ran out of months they've run out of Finance it's been that way for years he that has begun a good work will perform that means he will bring it to an end he will will accomplish it he that begun a good work in you it means he will perfect it complete it finish it he that has begun it will perfect it as a psalmist said in Psalms 138:8 the Lord will perfect bring to an end complete perform that which concerneth me thy mercy oh Lord endureth forever and then the prayer forsake not the works of thine own hands it's that acknowledgement that I am your clay I am your work don't forsake it Lord finish what you started it's a it's a coming back to him on the center of his will to say Lord I want you to finish what you started the statue of a perfect man brother bandam says now you're going to build a house there's a lot in this uh to consider and you pour the foundation say boy I got her see you got the foundation to build your house on now you've got to build the house brother B using this even in the light of you have faith or you you're born again you have that Holy Ghost oh I've got it I'm done this is it this is it's all over he said no you got to build the house now this is where the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about now and we've quoted some Snippets from these from this uh this sermon and I wanted building the spiritual House of God the dwelling place of God's presence he says all right a house this Foundation is first what is the foundation of Christianity faith in the word of God that is your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this Foundation now building a house you put your uprights and everything else so now he's drawing from a very literal process of building a house that you begin with a foundation there's different types of Foundations there's different requirements for Foundation based upon the ground God knows what he's doing he knows what those requirements are but you're building a house you start with a foundation brother B saying now once you have the foundation you don't say boy I got her doesn't matter how deep you might have drilled foot or poured Footers a a and dogout footage doesn't matter how big it is you don't say well I got her I got a loan for a million dollars to build a house and I poured a million dollar Foundation we spent the money we got it but he says no you got to build you got to grow from there he said brother would and some you carpenters and contractors here tell us how you build your house and and he said so we could take from the the handyman here and the builders here they could tell us how to build a house he says but I'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house where God can dwell he says he wants to dwell in you and then he says he wants to make you like himself so he wants to make you it's he that makes you he wants you to be reflecting his being this is something that he wants to do so he realized that what he's begun in us as a foundation it's the guarantee that he's working on you the beginning means if I've started it I'm going to finish I'm not going to forsake you I I'll be a little uh I'll share my own testimony just very very briefly one thing that seemed to haunt me for uh just my whole life in some ways but even in the adult life and and just even a few years ago is back in 2020 that there was this seemed to be this complex in my mind that God could just at any minute a as a father just like yeah never mind you know what just forget about it I'm done like this little bit of thought is could it be that at any moment God could say all right I'm just going to move on to somebody else and I had to come to the Revelation that what God has started he'll finish and that I'm better off not I I'm better off just accepting that and yielding to that and there's no virtue in worrying about whether or not he's going to forsake the works of his hand hands or that he's going to walk away from this and leave me as an unfinished product I've just accepted the fact that he loves me he'll always love me I'm the object of his desire and that he will finish this he will do it because he wants to dwell in me he wants to make me like himself he wants me to be reflect in his being it's just not my pleading prayer it's not just my heart's cry it's just not some vain repetition that I pour out to him say Lord I want to be like you Lord I want to grow I want to be a Christian I want to serve you I Want to Be Free it's not just some empty prayer it's actually a Hearts cry a song from my heart that matches a tune in his heart he's like that's right that's right cuz that's what I want he wants you to reflect his being we're not pining for his affection and he's just kind of mocking at us oh yeah you want to be perfect you want to be like me well good luck no he he desires this let's look at Psalms 127 and I was ministering on Sunday I'd come with just the full you know full full notes I was like I'm going to be long and I hope it doesn't get too long and then I preach less than an hour and I'm wondering if I'm going too fast and I asked my family nobody answered and so tonight I come with much less than what I had on Sunday and so we could be very very short I'm probably going to ask is it too fast nobody's going to answer but we'll beat the crowd to In and Out so everybody will be happy but in Psalms 127: 1 to5 it says except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain as we used the example of a Watchman in the scripture as a type of a father and a husband within the home listen if he's not watching you're watching in vain now does that mean you don't have to watch nope it means your watching will be fruitful because he watches also it tells us to watch tells us to wake and to look then it says it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep Lo children are inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of his womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them who's got five who's got five kids God bless you you're scripturally correct Quivers five so all of us with four or three or whatever well bless their hearts we'll just pray for them he says they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate some people are counting right now how many does brother Aaron have now if I want to look at this kind of as as a top view it's only five verses but notice how it says that that speak speaking of these couple verses of building a house watching out over the house and then in verse two it speaks of kind of our labor our working our efforts to make a living and then it brings into view those last three verses how that there this is rearing children having a family so in just five verses it really captures a lot in terms of laboring uh and Rising uh to work and eating and raising children it's all the things that we do we eat we sleep we work we get uh money we buy food we raise children it kind of brings a lot into view and these passages these very scriptures Express that our endeavors will only succeed if God blesses them they'll only succeed by God's grace and if you studied this on your own you might find some that uh think that this uh different interpretations of it it may refer to a reference to the building of the temple by Solomon except the Lord buil the house those that build build in vain as Solomon built the house of the Lord it could also be associated with Solomon building his own house the palace CU he does both a and you'll see those images in the scripture we may visit that on Sunday and so this house that it speaks of and it's the song of degrees for Solomon except the Lord build the temple those that build the temple labor in vain except the Lord build the Palace of the house he that builds his house labors in vain so regardless of how motivated you are to build the house regardless of how much resources you have how skilled you are how wealthy if the Lord does not give it success it'll be in vain because we're all dependent upon him anyways as the oral the tarum the oral Hebrew Bible wrote it if the word of the Lord does not build the house if the word of the Lord does not build the house brings us back to the beginning that Foundation it's got to be the word that does it if the word is the foundation the word is what builds the superstructure except the Lord buil the house they labor in vain that build it now if we were really picky we might say that doesn't make much sense except the Lord build the house they that labor to build it do so in vain it's like well if the Lord builds the house that then I'm not building the house am I does the sentence suppose some kind of weird uh Switcheroo where it's like well yeah of course if the Lord build the house if he doesn't build the house then that's just me building the house but if he builds it am I still building it that's what it's trying to say that you are it means that there must be some joint work except the Lord be building the house also all your labors in building are in vain but you've got to labor to build it you've got to be engaged in the process you've got to be willing there's got to be a a desire to say Lord I want to be an instrument I want to be used I mean if we've all been called tools at some point so we got got say I want to be a tool Lord I want to be used I want to be laboring together this means there there got to be something except the Lord be building also all my building is in vain so as I stand Upon A sure Foundation I see a lot of good material that can make a good house I say Lord I want to put myself to use but I don't want to be the one working by myself I want the word of the Lord to be working in me to build this house so it must be some joint work except the Lord build the house they that labor to build will build in vain so we must be laboring to build we must be waking to watch but he must also be watching he must also be building am it says in verse three Lo children are inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of his womb is his reward as the arrows are in the hand of a mighty man soore the children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them the the the parents they shall not be ashamed nor shall the children be ashamed because they shall speak with the enemies in the gate in other words those children will be there as a witness as a testimony in a time of trial time of judgment in the gate it's a beautiful picture but he's drawing the image of the family into the picture of God's work except the Lord build he that builds builds in vain except the Lord watch he that watches watches in vain and then it just almost seems like well what is he talking about because he says children are inheritage of the lord it's the reward uh the fruit of the womb is his reward it's bringing this into look that this the house of the Lord builds together a as he builds together we're building together with him and this house of Lord's being built it can be understood to be now not just the temple not the palace but even a family even your own household as it says in Ruth 4:1 and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we Are Witnesses so it's not speaking of Ruth the Lord make the woman that has come into thine house like elel and like Leah which two did build the house of Israel so it's showing that through the the the relationship of a husband and wife and the children that are the the the his reward to a family that that's the building of the house now when you read this look at how that comes together to say except the Lord buil the house the L the he that builds it builds in vain so mother and father husband and wife are building it but we might say Lord you you be the general contractor I'll be your sub let let me work together with you the one that has the master plan the Lord make Miss woman to come into that house may she be like Rachel which did build the house of Israel so except the Lord build the house and saying to those that are having families to those that are husband and wife to those who are father and mother to those who relate to one another as Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus as the children of Lord It's the Lord that's building this house andless God builds with us we build in vain unless he watches with us we watch in vain the work is vain meaning it's emptiness it's actually destructive and he's saying it just if you even look at it this way and I'm wanting to wrap this up here very soon so God just help me to be able to summarize these verses here labor is Vanity without reward or it's a strain there's uh it's destructive there's a price that pays when you when you labor and you don't see the fruits of your labor and it's actually saying in the scriptures that you rise up early and you work and you sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows that the very thing you you've worked to provide when you eat is the bread of Sorrows that's the fruit of your labor it's the bread of Sorrows if he doesn't labor with you the Bible says man goeth forth unto his work and to labor until the evening in Psalms 104: 23 it's saying oh a man works and he strives and he rises up early and he labors to the late to eat the bread of Sorrows this is what man does he goes forth and he works and works until the evening and so it says that God does not not only bless your labor with bread but he rewards you with rest that without him it's just the bread of Sorrows but it says that this is what a man does he rises up early and he sits up late to eat the bread of Sorrows and it would just be vanity if that all that was so what he does is so that it's not vain he gives you sleep notice how he's dealing with vanity if you build without him it's vanity if you watch without him it's vanity if you rise up and work and labor without him it's vanity unless you find rest in what you're doing so God does not only bless your labors with the fruit of uh wages and those things but he rewards you with rest the Bible says having food food and rment let us therewith be content and and he wants to put you give you a mind that is at peace and he's saying that about our labor and so look at what he says about raising children children are inheritage of the Lord and and as it speaks to this and and and and and it references this what he does then is he gives us Grace he recognizes the challenge that it has and it's something he's with us in it it's a difficult thing but they in Heritage of the Lord in Hebrews chap 12: 1-2 it says seeing also wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us we have our course we have our race but it's not a race that we run on our own he says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith the author and finisher of our race who for the joy which was set who was that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God he is the author in other words our faith has its beginning point he lays for a beginning a stone Jesus Christ our faith has its Genesis in him and it has its finisher it has the Perfection of our faith in its God that does it he's the beginner he's the finisher he's the one in between we don't want him to be the beginner and the finisher and then we're just the ones in between and listen the between is this the between is the rising early and the going to bed late the between is the eating the bread the between is raising our children and he's saying I give rest I give Grace I I'm a participant in this I'm I'm to be there with you I'm not a God that's just sitting by waiting to chastise you when you get something wrong as a husband waiting to chastise you and you get something wrong as a mother that's not God's IMO if you've experienced that in Christianity through leadership that's not how God leads God is a participant with you in this he wants you to succeed he wants you to be an image of him he wants you to grow into a dwelling place and he wants to raise you he wants to rear you he wants to encourage you he wants to love you he wants to wash away all your difficulties he wants to smooth away your rough places he wants to heal your Brokenness God is there as a finisher as much as God word calls us to Perfection it's his word that gets us there if not more as much as he's calling us to it it's double that he's going to get us there he says come unto me all ye who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest we've got a work to do we've got laboring to undertake for to be the Fifth Gospel for to be preached within our homes these things that God's requiring of us a and I say this with the unction of the Holy Ghost behind me that the Holy Ghost is challenging us as Christians in this end time to move ourselves away from all these distractions come back to the attraction of the world and realize it's not Theology and itching ears but it's living the life it's doing what we ought to do as brothers and sisters in the way that we treat one another the way we behave not only in the house of the Lord but how we raise our children the things we talk about our Recreation all these things it's all it all adds up to living the life and because of that we realize we got a work to do but he's saying I don't want you to run off and try to do this on your own right this isn't message theater where we all just dress up and we're acting on some stage but we come to him yes and he's going to give us rest that means he's going to refresh us it's a it's a promise to take our ease to cause one to cease from something to recover and collect strength and he wants us to quit straining on our own come to him to find our source of strength and rest in order for this house to be finished if you labor on your own you labor in vain because there's no virtue and you weary even in what you think is well dooing because you've forsaken the Builder but this is his house and I'm not talking about this house that's been converted into a church such a huge house they were able to have a balcony in it mind you great campus but it's I'm talking about you you are his house your marriage is his house you're a picture of God's desire your family is the household of God that the body it's his doing it's his and Luke chap 14: 28 to30 we'll invite the brothers to come to their instruments and that this is this is kind of uh this is forecasting where we want to go maybe for a couple services say for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and cth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it I've laid the foundation I'll also finish it he that has begun a good work in you is just and faithful to perform it to complete it so it says lest happily after he ha laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man begin to build and was not able to finish this is why he's saying what man is going to start building something lay the foundation they get so far I'm like oh man I never had enough lumber I didn't have enough financing I didn't have enough materials I didn't know they discontinued that product I didn't know I had this didn't have that and as it spoken here let's just kind of take it as a general principle and let's apply it to God is God going to lay a foundation is God going to draw a bride out of the church is God going to invest a lot of vindication in the profit only for us to kind of figure out well he was kind of wrong on a few things let's just move on let's just go up a little bit higher one guy told me that the bride was going to do the math and figure out that brother Brandon was wrong in his calculation about certain days and that was going to be the bride's Revelation and it was like you mean to tell me that you believe that God invested vind ation and a prophet yes Vindicated Prophet but the Revelation is going to be where he did his math wrong I don't know why I said that you know whoever streaming that but there it it is God has started something he knows what he's working with and and even when we've made a mess of things can we just admit we make a mess of things sometimes you know when I was going through that several years ago as I alluded to it earlier it wasn't like I I was doing everything right my life was perfect and it was like I've come to the Pinnacle and all a sudden God says that's good enough and he walks away I'm like well I was kind of hoping that there was more you know sometimes we just do our own things and we disappoint ourselves we disappoint others and there's struggles that we're trying to work through and growth and things and we realize man maybe I'm making a big mess of this maybe maybe I'm bumbling and stumbling and maybe I just grab this I know what you you guys do you grab that Ikea box you rip it open you start building it cuz you're like this makes sense you don't realize this was originally done in another language right and to me there's always a piece that's upside down there's always something extra and we just want to think those Europeans don't know what they're doing and we just rush ahead we're not following the instructions we we torque something a little bit too tight we build something wrong oh I've made a mess of it I made a mess of it and God says look I anticipated that I I knew that would happen this this I can fix this it's not wasted oh is it the whole thing going to top is the whole thing ruined did I do I need to go buy something else did I did I waste away your resources he's like no I plan for this because he laid a foundation and he knew he knows what it takes to finish it because it's not going to be said of him that he began to build and he wasn't able to finish do you believe that God's able to finish do you believe God's able to finish in your life God is able to finish in the sermon unwelcomed Christ this might seem to be a little bit oddd I don't have the the it on the slide for you so just please listen I'm going to close with this brother man says I've gotten my home my home City one of Mayo's nurses Mayo's brother's Clinic the nurse looking out a cancer case this woman only weighed 30 lbs when male brothers gave her up she lost her mind they brought her to the meeting she was to die in 24 hours so her sister brought her and her husband while preaching I saw vision and told all about her and it commanded her to rise up in jesus' name that's been 10 years ago in a year's time the woman weighed 170 lbs perfectly normal and well now that's just one of hundreds something has to create there CU notice what he says faith has to create her organs were gone why even cancer had eating her so bad big holes went in her intestines it had eat her up I want you to think of of this image of the the physical body as a as a house it's a temple and there was organs that had been birthed and formed and grown through adult life had functioned but now cancer had eaten it up and there was holes he says today there's not a blemish about her all because of Jesus Christ says now look what happened to her there that don't have to happen to you that's crippled the spirit's gone out polio and paralysis he's saying that it doesn't have to necessar go in and create where things have been completely destroyed he says it's just like the devil going into a house and breaking up the lamp tearing up the bed than going out that's the results of him but God is the one remember when we were saying how that we get this chaos and things get messed up and things get out of order and brother Brown just says well that's just the devil that's the devil that done it he says that's the results of the devil but God is the one the housekeeper [Music] Hallelujah he's the house Builder he's the home builder he's the housekeeper who comes in and straightens it up again oh if this house is a mess I don't have to clean it up on my own he's the housekeeper that will come and he will straighten it up again if it's shut through with holes if it's been torn down if it's been ruined if there's been a flood come through and sweep things away if there's been a fire that's shaking something if it seems as the whole earth Shook and the foundation's been broken he's the housekeeper that comes and straightens it up again if a body that was riddled with cancer that was eaten up with holes and the Holy Spirit could come and not be a blemish in that Temple and cannot God do that for us can we not trust that housekeeper to come and straighten it up again if you've made a mess of it just say Lord I want to clean but I don't want to clean without you lord I want to fix but I don't want to fix without you lord I want to build but I don't want to build without you pick up your hammer and your sword and say Lord I'm coming to work and I'm coming to war but I ain't doing it without you and come back to your place tonight and say Lord I want to do this with you rise to your feet tonight
