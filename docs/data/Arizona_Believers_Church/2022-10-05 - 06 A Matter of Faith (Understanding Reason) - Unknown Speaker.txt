TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and my subtitle today is uh understanding reasons our title is a matter of faith and subtitle is understanding reason and I'll say this um at the outset as a uh not a thesis statement but I'm going to be very careful I feel like I'm kind of walking a tightrope maybe this maybe how I felt even in the subject matter because there are ditches on each side of the road that you have to be careful of but I'm wanting to look at the role of knowledge wisdom understanding and reason as it relates to Faith because there's certainly a way that we could say there's faith and then everything else and so we have faith and we throw out the window knowledge wisdom and understanding and reason and there is I would say a false division or dichotomy between faith and reason and that false dichotomy is one that always takes reason and faith and makes them enemies or makes them Rivals and pits them against each other in such a way to where you have uh um rivalry or enemies against each other and I would say there is a proper distinction and a proper placing but there's a false way that you could position them you can take Faith you could take reason and position them in the false way and and I trust that here at the outset with some of these introductory statements as we have it Amplified with a little bit of an echo that it'll have a greater impact but uh I want you to just hold real tight to what I'm saying in the beginning because it can be very important as we go forward and I don't think this will be mentally taxing tonight but I want you to be focused very intently because I'm going to be saying things uh that if you're if you're not listening and it's not building could be easy for you to slip to the one side and not really catch what we're trying to express and so let me say it this way at the outset as I say there could be a false dichotomy of what faith is and what reason is so there's a there's a way that you could present them in a false way or pit them against one another and the world pushes a narrative this is going to be important to catch at the very beginning the world pushes a narrative that faith is void of reason and in doing so they misrepresent Christianity so they kind of take Christians and they say we're there they're brainwashed or they're they choose not to exercise their minds and they choose not to to use reason and they're intellectually dull and there's a way that they try to paint Christianity or misrepresent Christianity by pushing a narrative that faith is absent or void or has nothing to do with or no connection or relationship to reason and then on the other hand maybe even accepting that narrative or as a pushback against it Christians almost are willing to bear that mantle and say that's right and nominal Christianity in many ways has let go of reason and has let go of understanding and so in that and I'm moving very quickly today in that because you could have one side that says there is a faith and reason our Arch enemies and and faith is void of reason and the world tries to present that to make Christians look as if they're ignorant they're dumb and they're not and they don't understand and they just accept things without any thought process whatsoever and then on the other hand Christians maybe say that's right you know we just go by faith and faith alone and in doing so separate themselves from reason and understanding there's uh there's sides that people take even with respect to and within Christianity itself and so what happens is and we could these are maybe broad categories that might not maybe seem to be over simplistic but we can certainly identify this that within Christianity there becomes a divide and I think it's getting bigger and bigger kind of in the nominal realm but I think you'll recognize this that there's the side that's intellectual and then there's a side that's emotional so there's people very fundamental very intellectual uh uh you know and and they present themselves maybe in an academic theological way that's their theology that's the exercise of their faith it's in an intellectual sense but then you have the other side that's more charismatic uh maybe more Evangelical and they are more the more emotional side and So within Christianity you kind of have this divide even today with the nominal Christianity of the intellectual side and the emotional side and brother Branagh makes these two statements that highlight this he says the Full Gospel Church is divided in two ways right now one of them is getting cold formal and indifferent he says a danger line right so cold formal and different is a danger line the next one's getting a bunch of all kinds of Mystic here and high things that's not even scriptural so so he's saying one's a danger line and the other's a danger line one is so cold formal and legalistic or indifferent that they've created a danger line but then the other side has gone off into a bunch of mysticism and a bunch of high things that's not even scriptural right because they're kind of if I'm really getting deep within my thought they piggyback on this idea of a mysterious God and knowing things by faith so they can present things that really have no basis nothing that can be verified and they push things and it's kind of a mysticism even to the people that believe it because they've kind of co-opted certain things within the word of God and it's become untethered from a real solid base and so they go off into this other side and he says uh he says stay right he says watch it stay right in the middle of the road brother so there's a danger line on each side and he's saying there's some that have gone off in this mysticism there's others that go off in this cold dead formalism and he's saying stay in the middle of the road and he says in another place and that's about the way churches have got just took in a bunch under cold formal profession some Mystic dance or some sensation so there's the two sides you have one that's got a cold formal profession but then another that has some sort of Mystic dance or some sensation it spills over to the other side and what did they do disbelieve the word so we got a nest full of rotten eggs it's kind of that idea of having not been with uh um the seed you know having not been birthed the proper birth now in each one of those conditions you have the cold formalism or the kind of the intellectualism or the emotional side both conditions are not the characteristic of true faith and and they have their they have their residence uh in another realm I think I have that slide by the Chris that maybe shows the body uh spirit soul I kind of put it in there at the last minute uh just so we could look at this if you recall the last time we ministered on this subject a couple Wednesdays ago we were taking that um breakdown of the human who is Body Spirit Souls you have this body that has the senses that are outlined there you have a spirit the mind the heart the emotions the thinking and then you have the soul this would be the representation of a person who is born again who in their soul has only one sense its faith and so this idea or this emotionalism and even the formalism they reside solely within the realm of the spirit and you could say maybe expressing itself within the body but that's all it exists within is in that Spirit of the man and that's why we could call it intellectual faith emotionalism and and formalism are both fruits of an intellectual faith not a soul faith a carnal Faith a human faith and someone can look at the word of God and hear things and see things and believe things and all they're doing is using their human part to grab a hold of something and exercise it or use it or believe it or look to it and the only and those are the those are the extremes that you can fall into emotionalism or formalism but both are intellectual faith think about that because there's a way that not that often it's expressed this way that intellectual faith is the cold formal Ted Talk teachers and people who only teach the word and talk about the word only and and don't believe in the gifts and don't manifest themselves in signs and wonders and miracles and they say that's intellectual Faith but intellectual faith is also emotional charismatic and can and and effusive about certain things and and maybe by Optics are very different in their mannerisms and the way they conduct themselves but both of them are intellectual faith because the devil would love to be able to characterize one as being indicative of intellectual Faith so that if you see the other you just say oh well then that that's the real deal that's the soul Faith but both can manifest in intellectual faith and so when we think of intellectual Faith it's born solely from the human emotions and that Spirit realm that mind and it goes no deeper it goes no deeper to that faith that we as we have it represented here yeah we could put it at the top of his headship but we put it here at the bottom as it's undergirding everything it's that Foundation it's the it works all within that and so this I know they were just sharing principle after principle tonight intellectual faith can be cold formal can be dead or it can be emotional and fanatical it can be legalistic or it can be a licentious it can be a license because it's all within the human realm and it can operate within the bounds of how a human could think and act whatever whatever personality gets a hold of it and it could express itself and very energetic very charismatic but it also be very cold and very formal and all it is is just the human part the intellectual part a few statements here I think I have three statements here to read to you at the outset to recognize how brother Branham even divided this because I believe it's extremely helpful to us to see this better man says a man could have an intellectual faith and there's where most people today calling themselves Christians the reason you see such carrying on as they do under the name of Christianity it's only intellectual faith so even that carrying on is an intellectual Faith what do you mean by intellectual faith brother this is it man believeth unto salvation now Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word say just using this phrase here he says now I could preach the word you could accept and say that's all right yeah I believe that well now if that's all the father it ever goes it's if it's only ascented to in the mind and it ever goes deeper to the soul or we could even use the phrase heart that never goes deeper than that he says then you'll never get very far with God he says intellectual faith so it's ascending even to something that's true but except in it only intellectually as long as you've only accepted it intellectually it's subject to reason because it's not in the soul which is only one one sense its Faith so as long as it's in that realm and he brings this out I think it's in these few statements we have here or you'll catch that theme as we go on that's the reason people don't get healed is because they only have an intellectual view of it what their mind conceives but the mind will reason so you can accept it yeah I believe in my healing but if it never goes any deeper as it exists there within the mind there's these other voices that go but I don't know if you're feeling any better or well the doctor says this is a pretty bad case and so it's in there and you really want to believe it you're like oh no no I believe it no no I believe it and then after a while you kind of it's peer pressure in your head right there's so many other voices like okay well maybe I should listen to these other voices in my head and there's a little bit of a loosening because it's all within your emotional Realm it says the mind will say it cannot be I'm no better my sense of sight says marm is no straighter than it was yesterday my sense of feeling says I don't feel any different than I did yesterday reasoning mental theology will reason out and say well now wait a minute I believe that's foolishness see your reasoning that intellectual faith will do that and there is uh there can be uh an improper conflation of reason and reasoning and even in terms of making an argument and being convincing and setting something out you can have reason and then reasoning and so there's this is where the problem is is in the reasoning there's a reasoning with it he says this reasoning uh that's intellectual faith that will begin to reason then and I have heard but now see he says then faith has a channel to move into I think we've been reading this lately he says if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith not genuine Faith from God that intellectual faith will get you nowhere might get you emotional so he's saying yeah maybe somewhere might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing that you're looking for so intellectual Faith Can can manifest itself an emotion and certain feelings and convictions but he's saying it it doesn't bring that permanence it doesn't bring that final outcome that you're looking for because faith it hasn't opened up that channel into the soul then in the sermon God keeps his word he says now just a moment is it in the into prayer uh wanting to pray for the sick everyone be reverent don't move stand still pray with all your heart now don't be emotionally in other words don't get emotional have faith unique he's presenting those two together because one is it one is that danger there's this danger line of if you cry if you feel it if you get emotional he says don't get emotional have faith your emotions will never build he says it'll build a material intellectual faith he says but it'll never build a faith in your heart let the word sink down just believe God if you if thou can't believe all things are possible so that's just a few statements to recognize that that intellectual faith and how it can move within the sense of feeling and even the sense of logic and reasoning and it only exists within the realm of the body and the mind the senses of the body and the spirit as it gives information and the mind begins to process it and reason it out and so it this intellectual Faith we're using that as a phrase just to kind of help us move along because we could categorize so many things by it I think we've called it mental Faith or emotional Faith it's characterized by either a a religious rationalism where there's uh there is it's a religious uh expression of well it must be by Logic and it must be academic and it must be figured out or kind of this religious emotionalism for one for the one side this kind of this religious rationalism they would say that reason is the ultimate Authority that that's what we go by is reason and they have a very strict maybe even approach to scripture and it has to be historical you have to examine it by its original language and you have to do this and they use that rigorous process to achieve a result that they now say because we've exercised this examination of the scripture and we've used this thought process and they've got all sorts of fancy words to describe it then this is how we've ended up with this and so reason is the ultimate Authority whereas on the other side experience becomes the absolute they're looking merely to what they've experienced and what they felt and they said all right it doesn't matter what you say this is what I've experienced it doesn't matter what this says this is what I felt doesn't matter what you say this is what I'm feeling this is we like this expression and this enthusiasm and we get results don't we and and the way that they feel and that's this is just within the Realms of Christianity now let's look at that uh that dichotomy and I realize now maybe presenting different divisions that you have on one level the world that wants to take Faith and reason and pit them against each other and say our Christians are just void of they're they're dumb they're dulled down they're being brainwashed they just accepted these things and and it's laziness or whatever and they kind of put in that category and then that kind of mindset is even within the Realms of Christianity where you have some that want to be extremely rational and some that want to be extremely irrational and it's all in its and it happens because there's no real Soul faith now this is Paul bringing these things out and I think he kind of nails this and is using a language uh that can be real tight to us he says for the preacher of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness right First Corinthians 1 18. but us which are saved it is the power of God so preaching the word to the world is like that's crazy right even to the world today I was even say maybe two modern Christians today be like why is that guy wearing a suit and tie you know can he get us can he get a hold of some Yeezys or something and a pair of blue jeans and a a linen shirt or something come and mix it up there dude and uh and so there's just a way that there's a way that preaching just looks foolish there's a way that even the exercise of taking scripture and ministering things is foolishness and so the preaching of the Cross to those that are lost and to those who will perish its foolishness but to those who ordained to Salvation it's like this is the power of God now it's important to say recognize this that not we're not just giving lip service to it but to the save there is this reality that these things relate to the Divine the highest power the greatest in verse 19 for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent now we could take that and we can say oh see there if you're wise you're going to be destroyed if you have understandings can be brought to nothing if you're prudent if you're wise if you if you're perceptive these things are going to be destroyed and you'll be laid waste but he's talking about that which is solely the wisdom of this world he says where is the wise where's the Scribe where's the disputer of this world the one that believes solely in logic and rigorous training and intellectualism and those things he says hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world so there is a wisdom versus Faith but that wisdom is solely and only worldly wisdom for after that in the wisdom of God so now there is a a true wisdom the World by wisdom knew not God for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe it is a mouthful but there is a wisdom of God and the World by its wisdom knows not the wisdom of God verse 22 for the Jews require a sign in the Greek seek after wisdom see now you have even in this way you have maybe the Jews who are looking for something physical looking for something tangible they they're gonna they're gonna operate and react to something totally different whereas the Greek's going to be maybe looking more the the philosophical side the wisdom side the intellectual side and Paul says but we preach Christ crucified we need not cater to either one we preach Christ crucified which is in itself a sign which it is in itself the wisdom of God under the Jews it's a stumbling block under the Greeks it's foolishness but yet it is truth so one thing to remember and to keep in mind is we're kind of going down this line of understanding reason and I think it's maybe a little catchy right understanding reason that all truth is God's truth all truth is God's truth and so there's this stigma that can be placed on things but all truth is God's truth and so this is but to the Jews it's a stumbling about to the Greek's foolishness but unto them which are called whether they be Jews or Greeks both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God this is the power of God this is the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men not that there is foolishness with God not that there is weakness with God but that is how the world perceives it right the world perceives it as foolishness the world perceives it as weakness if we're not careful as Christians we want to proceed be perceived as foolish and weak on our own terms as the world would want to see it and we've missed it because we we bought into this idea Christians are dumb Christians are ignorant Christians are foolish Christians are weak and and but yet that's how the World Views you when you're in the truth not when you've tried to manufacture that and I would say this that even intellectually we can reason with these scriptures where pits wisdom versus God and knowledge and and these things as Paul even continuing with Paul and he's talking about how these things manifest in the glory of Lord and how he's confounding the wise with uh foolish things and there's a way that we could even wrestle with the principle and I say this because I believe it and brother Branham taught it that faith has no reason and and that has a meaning to it right faith has an Iranian it has a meaning to it and I think in the future services will be able to unpack that a little bit more but if we aren't careful with the things that we've read and even the things that we've kind of referenced I realize now that I had taken out quite a bit maybe that that look at this idea of reasoning and intellectual the being intelligent and thinking and these things uh maybe there's a stigma associated with it but if we're aren't careful we can reject very specific scriptural principles and even very important scriptural processes in Matthew chapter 12 verse 7 just going to read this it's I know it's kind of taken out of context a little bit or at least it's not within the context of the larger narrative but Jesus says but if you had known what this meaning I will have mercy and not sacrifice had you known had you understood if you knew what it meant when God said I will have mercy and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the Guiltless Jesus is saying if you if you understood the Commandment if you knew what it meant if you if you really had caught what he meant when he said it if you'd had kind of the reasoning the logos because there can be word which is Rima only it's just the spoken part it's maybe the semantic it's the part that carries the thought but all you're kind of grabbing onto is the the shell in the word itself but the thought behind it he's basically saying yeah you say all day long I'll have mercy and not sacrifice and you've accepted you're the Scribe you believe it you believe every word you've built a whole tradition and religion around the things that God had said but if you had only knew what it meant you wouldn't have condemned the Guiltless so he's identifying with the Jews despite all their wealth of knowledge and this and that maybe the the literal word that they had there was a lack of understanding if you knew what it meant there was a lack of knowledge about that and if I could say this not to use a buzzword brother Andrew and I were Fellowship in on this yesterday in a way they weren't they weren't really thinking I know maybe venturing into some dangerous territory but they weren't really thinking about the Commandments of God yeah I believe it yeah that's great I believe it but they're not thinking about it like if that's if God says that what does that mean what are what what is that what are the consequences of that or why would God feel that way and and in that way you're not questioning God like oh that's not God and why would he do that but you're wanting to know that if if God gives a commandment he's a god of reason he's a god of purpose he's a god of a higher intelligence and you're looking at just saying well I accept it and I believe it but in my heart I would real I really want to know your heart behind it I want to know your reason behind it and it was really a blessing to me uh this afternoon I had reached out to brother loyal and I said hey if you have a song on your heart it'd be wonderful if you could sing and excellent timing thank you and uh and so I was I just said if you have a song on your heart singing and he sent out a text message to the musicians and he asked them you know do you know the song Oh I want to know you more and I'm thinking oh wow awesome it was very think of the very words of those song of that song that I want to know you more deep within my soul I want to know you to fill your heart and know your mind that it warns my hungering to behold that there's there's this desire and even brother Michael saying uh more of you that there's this idea and say well I've accepted your word I believe your word but that's only given me an appetite that's only stirred up within me a hunger to know the one that spoke it to know the one that gave it to not just look at it on its surface like yep I got it and run out and try to mimic it or walk in it or just accept it intellectually but want to get down as Jesus said if you'd only know them known the meaning well I want to know the meaning I believe it but I want to know the meaning of it and so it's a lack of critical thinking maybe about the Commandments of God where there's no consideration there there's no deeper thought there's no wisdom that is birthed by it say ah I've caught them I I caught the understanding of that and then it leaves it loses that that rigorous legalistic way sometimes that we adhere to certain things and when we were very we're very diligent to do things but because we've kind of lost the wisdom of it we never really get the full benefit of it and we're never able to really advance in it because it's just it's by pure discipline it's by pure uh sweat and perspiration that we're adhering to the letter of the law instead of kind of catching the spirit of it and recognizing how that can then have a domino effect into other areas I think that's why so often people put a period on things and that's how denomination started is they just wanted to kind of have the be able to put it on their website right like these are this is what we believe period and then just stay within that instead of really understanding that these things if they're truth represent something that's Eternal Without End in Hosea chapter 4 verse 6 he says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge I will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me see in thou has forgotten the law of God I will also forget thy children but notice how succinctly it's put my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge it's not characterized that my people are destroyed for lack of belief or lack of faith but it's a rejection of knowledge if Jesus says you had you only known what it meant to say I will have mercy and not sacrifice maybe it could be said that they believed what he said but they lacked the knowledge of what he said and because they lacked the deeper understanding of the principles of God they're destroyed and because they rejected digging deeper to know the heart of God behind his precepts and behind the law and behind the things he was expressing he says I will also reject thee there's this veneer there's this pretense that we could have in a religious sense where we just want everything to kind of check the box in terms of the the the the the the the the surface but we never have a desire to go beneath that and intellectually we can take great comfort in kind of just checking the boxes right God thought it brother man spoke it I believe it that settles it right just press play and Obey there's a there's a comfort level in that because man if salvation is just as easy as low two steps uh then then we figured it out but man what a total perversion of what it means to obey because they've don't know what it means or they're lack they're destroyed for a lack of knowledge now in Colossians chapter 1 verses 9 to 10 I've got three three verses here we're doing great tonight we have enough time to make it over to Freddy's and uh and people trying to read too much into my references to restaurants and they're wondering why I haven't mentioned ritos in a while but it doesn't mean I'm not thinking about ritos on a regular basis because Rito's has the best burritos right we all like greedos ritos ritos does that help we evened it out now Culver's isn't in the lead Colossians chapter 1 verses 9 and 10 he says now recognize these three verses we're gonna read three places in Colossians Ephesians and second Corinthians notice how Paul is alluding to let's just accept it on some level an intelligence a thinking a knowledge a wisdom a discernment a Justice a judgment of righteousness he says for this cause since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will we want you to be filled with the knowledge of his will Paul's the one that hearkens back and he's the one that says I'm going to speaking from Isaiah I'm going to destroy the wisdom of the wise I'm going to bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent but yet he's the one that is now saying he's he's drawing even I believe from Hosea that my people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge so Paul's prayer is that you would be filled with all with with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom in spiritual understanding knowledge wisdom spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and what is this condition and prefaced upon his prayer is that they would be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding and that's what's going to give birth to a walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and by that increasing in the knowledge of God now that phrase the knowledge of God do not make the mistake of distilling the knowledge of God down to just the black and white of the Bible or doctrinal precepts or historical acknowledgment of things that we attribute to God but recognizing that he is the author of Creation with an intelligence and with the mind that was rooted in a heart purpose there's a I think uh whether it be religion or science or the agnostics or or certain philosophers have tried to turn God into something detached this is just an experiment or it doesn't even exist and one thing that I absolutely love about the message of the hour is it didn't just it's not just um precepts and principles and doctrines that we can just elicit but it was pointing us to a thought a mind a desire a a an Earnest longing to have a fellowship and it brings us all the way back to the back part of God's mind to realize that all of this is intelligence all this is the plan of God for the purpose of redemption and so to be filled with all the knowledge of God and increasing in the knowledge of God means that there's a wisdom and understanding of everything under the sun I was drawn to even the creation story I think I'll come come back to it maybe here soon that in the beginning when God created that God pre-exists this intelligence this desire this thought the this is the creative act of a of a of a higher being and so when you say to be filled with all the knowledge of God that there's not this bifurcation where you have all the things of the world and knowledge and truth and Science and and all these things may be objectively verified and then over here you have God God created everything that exists Ephesians chapter 1 verses 17 and 18. again this is where Paul's prayer comes down that God of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him these are not just words there's just there's not really a way that we can just say oh well that's just saying faith faith faith faith but it's something related to Faith something that comes after Faith after you believed after you've been born again now his prayer for the birth is that the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him would come the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you might know what is the hope of his calling and the riches of the glory of his inheritance and the Saints has used the language to bring in the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him it's as if you know if you were a Greek you were a Jew you were a Roman or whatever he's gonna it's scratching your ear right even bringing it to the glory the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance and the Saints that they say that the Romans were all about Glory about Splendor the Greeks were about knowledge and understanding and philosophy the Jews were about light the Lord is a light in Salvation that that's what they were kind of Tethered to and Paul is saying in in all of your little ideologies in your camps there's a truth that can bring you all back to Center and God and unify them if there is a unifying theory that brings all theories together in some sort of wrestling with string theory and what's the what's the one theory that makes sense God is the one truth that brings all truth together and makes sense of it the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened this is the prayer for you tonight that your eyes of understanding would be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 6 again this relates to that uh division among Jews and Romans and Greeks to see that it's in Christ that philosophy and truth and experience are all United in one he says for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ where is their Glory not in government it's not in Emperors not in armies and not in power but in Christ where is knowledge not in books not in institutions not in academics but in Christ where is light it's not in the flesh it's not in the world it's not in science it's not in semantics it's in the face of Jesus Christ can you see then just through I I have here just five verses that if we're just that I guess we could I guess I realize that it this would be a perfect example of how I've read things that to the the emotional would say yeah that's it that's right wisdom is foolishness and what God has caused wisdom to fail and this and and all that there's a there's a one side people can just take it on the surface take it run with it and then I read these and the other side there could be that academic the intellectual right The Exodus of the scripture and all these things and they take this other side and the homiletics and we're over here and this is it right and and they've run with this and they take these scriptures but I would say neither one of you know what it means right to to to look at these things and take the camps and kind of cherry pick the things that kind of support your position it's what's always doomed one's efforts to know truth is they go to the source to confirm their bias to confirm how they already feel I'm emotional so I want to find confirming evidence in the things of God to confirm my bent to confirm the way I see things and then if you're intellectual or you're this kind of non-emotional uh rigorous cold formal side then you're going to go to the sources in order to find things to confirm how do you already feel instead of going with the heart of faith that knows truth comes from God and I'm going to approach this with the basis of Truth and with the belief that this word is infallible and I'm going to come to it to know truth and that the light of it may shine upon me to either expose what is false or to position what is truth because if to the Romans it was all glory then the face of Jesus Christ takes the True Glory and places it to the Greek who likes to philosophize and have knowledge it could take the truth of knowledge and place it to the Jew who wants Enlightenment science can take the truth and place it and so I'll say it this way instead of separating faith and reason and this is this is where I want you to I don't think it's too late now I'm not going to fall for the trick of looking at the clock I kind of like the fact that this church has no clock the only clock I have is your face right and there's just a way that the hands move sometimes where it's like it's like I'm like well it's approaching nine o'clock so instead of separating faith and reason I I want to be careful how I say this and I want to present it in a way that it's even at the outset you could see where I'm going instead of taking faith and reason and saying you're the bad guy you're the good guy what we ought to do is establish the order of dependence that if Jesus is castigating the Jews for not knowing what the word meant and that they were destroyed for the lack of knowledge and Paul is wanting us to be filled with the knowledge of his will with wisdom and spiritual understanding increasing in the knowledge of God with the spirit of wisdom and the Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding Enlightenment may know what the hope of this calling the riches of his glory and to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God that maybe there's something more to what we say faith is and maybe more to what is reason and wisdom and knowledge and understanding than what we say it is and recognize the order of dependence or the relationship among them we know that faith is a gift of God we know that God is only known by faith that you do not know God by science you do not know God by by having a hypothesis that then becomes a theory that then can become a fact that is not how you know God through a scientific method you can truly only know God as he's revealed to you in the truth of things so then we we recognize them that faith is to God this faith when we talk about faith we're talking about faith to God now there's a faith that we could have intellectually that we could it's our own faith that we we can put towards anything even in one another but there is a Divine Faith even I I didn't have time to get to it before but there's a Ophelia love and agape love and philio love produces a trust or dependence what is it that's human towards what if I love you I love my wife in a filial sense there's a trust and a confidence there but then when it's the love of God an agape love and there's a love of God then there's a faith and trust in another level that's a different kind of Faith with a different kind of love and those are the kind of the um another example of how you can have human Faith or Divine faith so there is a Divine Faith which is of god it is that Faith which we know God not by science so now with that established that that's where the faith is that we're talking about God does not depend upon Humanity or Reason he's just he's not dependent upon it he's not that is not what we rely upon to know him we know God by faith and God does not rely upon Humanity or reasoning but humanity and reason depend upon God so when we've placed God as the absolute or the ultimate as the supreme authority is the highest intelligence and if we look at it that way not that we are we are the brains of this outfit like what are we going to do tonight brain well we're going to figure out whether or not God exists right and and that's how we look at things that we're the we're the Smart Guys in the room and we're going to try to figure out God no we recognize there is a God he's the higher intelligence he's the greatest and that's what we believe by faith so then now God is Not depending upon our Humanity or our reason but our reasoning and our Humanity or our reason is entirely dependent upon him therefore this is the real key here and I even wrote this down so I wouldn't miss it rationality and reason then are part of our relationship with God we use rationality reason wisdom understanding knowledge those things are all part of our relationship with God and they cannot this is the problem they cannot become independent however you want to draw it up in your notebooks and show me later and say if you just would have drawn it out this way it all made sense but you have knowledge and wisdom and understanding and reason and rationality and thought all these things and as long as they are a part of your relationship to God then God can place those things or they can they can operate in their proper context but as soon as you make them independent that's where they begin to fail so if you divide faith and reason and it started is said instead of establishing the proper order of dependence that you have faith that is to God in faith that is from God and that reason is in relationship to it and dependent upon it as soon as you separate them you'll either abandon reason or demand that God comply with yours you've abandoned it like I don't need reason at all or you you make God meet or comply or abide by your wisdom strip reason from our faith I know I'm making some statements tonight but maybe I'll let you cause you to come back for part seven you strip reason from our faith and we're left emphasizing what feeling experience we had a phrase one time I was like that's it lazy Dogma it's exactly what it becomes when we strip knowledge wisdom understanding reason it's no longer part of our relationship with God and what we've done is we've thrown away as the side as the enemy to our faith I know these are difficult things I hope you're understanding where I'm bringing this from that if we've taken all these things that Paul talked about and we've made them bad on their face and once we've stripped that from our faith then it just becomes lazy Dogma because you just tell people what to do or don't you question it I'm your pastor you do what I say you write me a check for twenty thousand dollars tonight right that it gets that way you know you're not gonna go to Heaven until we build a church that has a gold pulpit and things like that and don't question it and there's no search in the scriptures there's no employing the heart of God or looking into the things of God in the mind of God to know what where where's the what what upholds this and so you could take this the I'm using the term reason but I hope it's pointing to more than just that worldly reason you take it out of it then all you have is experience all you have is feeling and everything you believe is just lazy Dogma yet on the other hand if we make our faith subject to reason or unrelated so there's this you you take well you make it in the sense that I am going to arrive at truth through rational thought and through human discipline and effort to figure things out then you make faith in it's now subject to reason it's dependent upon reason and then you just you gravitate to skepticism you become you be you lose your morality because the more that you're looking to things from that academic standpoint and through just that method alone there's no absolute truth that upholds it it's just human inspiration uh from a scientific standpoint and what's best and what's right and what's ethical and it's not coming back to what are the principles of God what is the nature of God how does God judge things because listen we've recognized it that God's equity and fairness does not operate by human laws and instincts of equity and fairness say it a lot and I'll say it over and over and over again whatever God says is true whatever God does is just and that's it when he speaks it's the truth when he acts it's right and if you then make the things of God kind of the product of our reasoning then we delve into skepticism and it results in immorality and I'll say this it isn't necessary to create create a rivalry between faith and reason it's necessary to put them in order it's necessary stand the hierarchy ours not Paul's called speaking to us and saying hey I know you've never really heard of these things before but get knowledge and get wisdom and get understanding but there's those who have been enlightened through that ecstasy through that birth through that Soul realm to have this other sense that that now want it needs to awaken inside of us this mind of Christ which is the mind of the Divine who is the creator of the Earth and the one that is set in motion all laws and all principles when you look at and I may be getting a little bit uh on Shaky Ground here because I don't have any of these things in front of me but some of the most renowned scientists in human history and and through the the real Enlightenment period And when there was great advances in the establishment of great truth those men were Christians and and their discipline and their efforts and their desire to achieve things weren't this uh conspiratorial effort to undermine the truths of God but it was this this understanding that God's the one that formed these things and that the more that we can learn about the Earth the more we're learning about God the more that we can learn about the planets the more great God seems and and that the more knowledge of creation is the knowledge of the Creator in a sense because we are taught in the Bible that the visible invisible things of God are declared To Us by the visible creation and so there was tremendous scientists who founded a lot of the basic principles that uphold science today and they were God-fearing bible-believing Christians am I right anybody who reads Wikipedia can you tell me whether or not I'm right it's true a lot of the mathematicians and the scientists philosophers were Christians they believed in the Bible they believed in the things of God but look how far man has gone with science once they turned away their faith in God and put it in themselves that's how we went from a horse and buggy to a rocket ship because man took the faith he had in God and they took it and they separated faith and reason the faith of God and they took their own faith and put it in their reason and yeah man has been able to do a lot with his faith and his own ability been able to go from horsepower to Rocket Power and put a man on the moon in a short period of time just a few decades able to accomplish that because he let loose of his faith in God and gave himself over reasonings and such right and so he's able to accomplish a lot but what has it delve into nothing is certain everything's always changing uh I I mean you just think about the rhythm of what you ought to eat and what you ought not to eat right MSG is going to come back in style here pretty soon right you know we're realizing all along that processed flowers were the Bedrock to a healthy lifestyle please right it's like this is just how it goes because science is ever learning they let loose of their faith in God and now what we've achieved is a great scientific knowledgeable community and we have tremendous advancements but anymore it's less moral than it's ever been and it's constantly wrestling with the morality and the ethics of its developments and they have no they have no Bedrock by which to judge what is right and what's moral and so it's just given itself over to immorality in the very disciplines that ought to be the most knowledgeable the most understanding in the most precise and the ones that rely upon science now have given themselves over to Absolute insanity because they want to be sensitive they don't want to offend because they've left they've left they've separated faith and reason and I would say that I hope that that I hope that makes um I hope you can see the connection that there's a way that man just merely operates in his head and it's no longer Guided by those principles that ought to be of the heart of righteousness and justice a true wisdom and knowledge and when it comes to you as a person that separation of the faith in your soul from the condition of your spirit and your body can create a disharmony that will plague your development because you're almost living you become bipolar you have what you have in your soul and then kind of the rest of it is like this enemy instead of realizing that they're they're that the the desire that Paul is speaking of is a Harmony among Body Spirit and soul that your body which feels and your spirit which reasons would be in harmony with your soul which has faith that the soul with its Faith then comes into and takes spirit and body and says this is this is the way walk ye in it I know these are familiar scriptures to you now just I'll end on these maybe I had a statement to read I'll maybe hold off on it but he says in Proverbs Chapter 2 Verse 6 for the lord giveth wisdom and out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding so the Lord gives wisdom and out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding and these are principles these are truths for life they're not just principles and truths that that make for a good church service or or are that are the fodder for church bulletin boards it is a knowledge and a wisdom which pertains to All Things the Lord gives wisdom out of his mouth mouth cometh knowledge and understanding again in Proverbs chapter 9 verses 9 and 10 it says give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learning this is not said in a way to mock deride or devalue wisdom and teaching but it's saying that this principle of instruction and teaching increases the right kind of wisdom and knowledge that's what we ought to get right with all that getting get understanding verse 10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding this was the secret to the success of the early scientist is they feared God that's the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holiest understanding that if we are able to attain to facts but yet it's separated from truth what does it get us in the end if there's facts that point to a truth we remind ourselves again that all truth is God's truth doesn't matter what it is if it's truth it's God's truth and the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so true understanding or true wisdom is found in the fear of God outside of this all there can be is worldly wisdom which will fail but if I fear the lord then I can Avail myself and ask and God will not upgrade me saying God give me more wisdom give me more discernment and it's the knowledge of the Holy the knowledge of the things of God that is understanding I don't have maybe the I I I just what what wells up inside of me I I just don't feel that I can articulate it but if we as Christians could labor to have the mind of Christ to see things the way he sees things to have his nature and his sensitivity to have the spirit of the word and not just the letter of it what it gives you puts you in the position of true wisdom true understanding and knowledge Kurt you don't need to argue the political points of the day you don't need to find yourself in the extremes and the platitudes and the platforms that have caused all all the partisanship that exist within society today you could have the wisdom that actually takes the truth of the polars and can bring people to the reality of a living God who has designed nature who is set in motioned these things and satisfy the hunger of all those seeking people that have found themselves in the ideologies and the extremes to status to to to placate the fear that they have you have the answer to it the knowledge of the Holy is understanding we're going to stop there let's stand
