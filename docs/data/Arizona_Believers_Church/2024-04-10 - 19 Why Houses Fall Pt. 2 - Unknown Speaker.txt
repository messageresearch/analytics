TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just GNA jump right into it I think I probably say that every time I preach uh I'm gonna not give much time maybe in some preliminaries to this but if you just look at verse 24 this is part two on why houses fall so I'm just trying to finish what we started on Sunday and just a part two on why houses fall I hope that you're able to kind of build in this thought uh together as a congregation um I I love it when different ones mention that they stream the services that they miss uh and that way we're kind of all in this together but yet if you haven't heard any of the other parts I think the things in here are instructive and stand on their own but in verse 24 it says therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and this is immediately after expressing the uh uh those that come to him and do not the will of the father and they uh they've done many wonderful works but they're not doing works of righteousness they're not obeying the will of the Lord and so this is kind of the parable that he gives he says he that hears and does and we looked at obedience quite a bit uh and how that obedience to the word of God is what righteousness is it's not trying to do God a service and it not being his will and saying oh that's righteousness but it's when you do his will it's obeying the will of God is righteousness so he that hears and does is like a wise man who builds his house house upon a rock and that's says it's and when he gives the description of the storms that come he says it was founded upon a rock so Jesus is identifying something uh that is foundational to success and that is the at the basis if we're going to please the Lord if we're going to uh do righteousness he's saying very simply the foundation the best foundation is hearing and doing to hear the word of God to know the word of God and then to do the world the word of God and uh as we've looked at foundations represent what upholds something what gives it strength and what supports something else so the foundation is not the house but the foundation is what holds the house up and we saw in the word of God if the foundations be destroyed then doesn't matter what's built on it it will be destroyed as well you could have the best materials on a foundation but if the foundation fails the materials will fail also so Jesus calls this person a wise P person so it could be a providential Provident prudent those may be some other words we could use but it's one who's Discerning and recognizing things they act very deliberately based upon what they can discern it means to foresee wants and make Provisions to supply them this is what to have wisdom is to see the need and to provide that which is needed so this wisdom this is Insight this is a a foresight by faith I know by faith I hear the word of God the word of God tells me something is a certain way and then you respond to that and it's that wisdom that builds the house and then richly fills the house Insight by faith is what's going to build it establish it make it firm and the Bible teaches us that it's that very thing that's going to fill it with the right kind of things and so through Providence Jesus is saying that this one has built his house upon a rock this is an example of someone who knows the word of God and does the word of God but then in verse 26 and it says everyone that heareth these says of mine and doeth them not shall be liken unto a foolish man so those are the two uh competing things wise and foolish those are things that we could see are are uh the contrary one to another or two categories that we're looking at a foolish man which built his house upon the sand this foolish we could just invert what it means to be wise he's unknowing he's not providential he's not prudent he doesn't understand or if he has any understanding or knowledge at all he doesn't he can't appreciate what it means he may know something but he doesn't understand it he can repeat something but it doesn't really it's not really striking and so to be a foolish would be to uh not know at all or to even know but not act accordingly because you can't appreciate how serious this is reminds me how that there's different standards and law to where one could be negligent and then there can be gross negligence at to where one can still be guilty uh not knowing they don't know so they're they're negligent but then there can be gross negligence where you knew or should have known or if you could prove they knew but they didn't change anything they didn't act you knew that was a hazard you knew a lot of people had gotten hurt on that but you never did anything about it that would be foolish and so that's the thought behind uh even the wise they know and they do and the foolish they they may not know and then if they know they still won't act that's very key in Luke Chapter 6:48 he is like a man which built a house and dig deep this is the wise man he dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded it was settled it was grounded this is uh it was founded upon a rock this founding speaks of principles the first principles the very foundational things of something so if something starts right it can go right if it starts wrong it's going to end up wrong so this so this is at the core of what it means to have of a foundation it's not physical as much as it is these guiding principles this wisdom in the beginning and one thing just if you could look at Psalms 125 this is where I'm I guess I am kind of just wrapping up or bringing back into view some things from Sunday that obedience that comes from trust gives us security think I might have said it on Sunday that Revelation obedience by Revelation puts us in a safe place you're on a rock you're this this is a good place to be so when your obedience comes from trust and not fear but comes from faith that gives us security but foolishness brings trouble the Bible says in Psalms 125: 1 and 2 they that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion which cannot be removed but abideth forever the wise man who heard the word of God and then built his house upon a rock is is one who the winds beat upon it the rains come the floods come but it stands sure and the foolish man hears hears the word of God builds a house suffers a storm but his house Falls so there's a lot of similarities and the key difference is they that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion which cannot be removed but abideth forever as the mountains are round about Jerusalem so the Lord is round about his people from hence forth even forever I I I I I share this because I want to make this point as where we were ending on Sunday and looking at being f founded upon a rock when you are founded upon a rock it makes you one with that rock and that this the storms the hurricane can only consolidate what's already in you and anything that can be taken away we want the winds to take it but we want anything that's settled to the Rock Lord Make Me sure and as we're emphasizing us building making our houses homes and uh being homebuilders as men and hom makers as sisters God gives us a promise of a positive outcome he he's round about those uh uh that fear him he's round about Jerusalem they that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion and in First Peter excuse me second Peter chap 1:1 and this is tying into uh this obedience doing what you hear wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure Jesus said that the man who built his house upon a rock dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock this is uh give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall if you continue if you're to back up just a little bit he's talking about that we've been given divine power and we can be partakers of these things through through his through his power and through his life he says give diligence to add to your faith and it begins to walk through add to your faith uh uh virtue and begins to take us through all those uh elements of the Statue of perfect man and so there's diligence diligence to grow diligence to increase it says give diligence to make your calling an election sure houses fall because they're not built on the right foundation houses fall when they're not built correctly and and houses will fall and our our structure will fall we could call it a house of cards because there's some pretense to it it's not built the right way it fall it falls when Builders aren't sure sure of the foundation and I think what how we were concluding on Sunday is they're not sure of where they stand and they're not proactive about things it says give diligence to make your calling your location your work what you're to do a calling to a particular position a calling to do a particular action if if you're a lady be a lady if your man be a man make your calling and election sure let me say this your calling and election are not uncertain it's your confidence in it it it's not confirming to God he made the right call or confirming to God that he made the right choice when electing you but to make your call in election sure is not from the standpoint of whether or not God has called you or elected you but it's your own confidence it's your own Revelation your own certainty because if you're not confident I I believe that God has called you and God has elected you and given you having elected you he's called you and you could do a really nice series on those two different concepts and even their differences and they're overlapping but it's not that God hasn't called you if something goes wrong it's not that You're Not Elected if the House of Cards Falls it's that you're not standing squarely you where you need to be and I think it's as uh CS Lewis might have said it that God wasn't me to play some game on me he he knew that I had a house of cards all along it was I that didn't know and so God tested me to show me where I was at and so the testing isn't to take away your election it isn't to take away your calling but it's for us to recognize man I'm a little off center here I'm not fully trusting in the foundation or I've built the house of cards on a really good foundation or I'm trying to build really really good without the right foundation maybe there's a lot of different uh choices it could be but this we've got to give diligence to make our call and an election sure but that has to do with our confidence in our foundation and our confidence in the work that's being done now Luke 6: 49 it says but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the Earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great there's something to be said about the fact that the wise man built upon a revelation he built upon a rock therefore having been founded upon a revelation he can say it's not me that does this but it's the spirit of God which is in me to Will and to do of his good pleasure because it's born from Revelation but then the one who here without a foundation builds upon the Earth the it's in the one of the things to point out is the fact that there's those that do many wonderful works but it was obviously in their flesh so when we build upon the Earth we build Upon Our Own carnal ideas our own carnal Works our own carnal uh you know discipline well it's all it's built on well I think I'm doing right I want to do good I want to I want to be a Christian I want to have many wonderful works and here someone's built on fleshly Works built on carnal things the stream will beat against it heavily hard and he says immediately it fell and the ruin was great and we could say this the house fell because of foolishness why do houses fall because of foolishness why do houses stand because of wisdom this house fell because of foolishness not taking heed to the word of God so there was a lack of awareness or what little awareness ever really stuck and said whoa we should probably do something about that or this is what the word of God says we need to act now so this house Falls because of foolishness in that it doesn't answer to the word of God it doesn't respond it doesn't react and do what the word of God is asking them to do Luke Chapter 12: 47 it's given this is kind of Jesus giving a principle after the parable uh of being watchful and your loins being GED about and your and your uh W your lights burning watch uh G yourself let your lights be burning it's this preparation it's this anticipation and expectation and he says that servant which knew his Lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes now I'm not threatening to give you a spanking and I'm not that wanting you to worry about a switch but it's the principle that the one that knows he knows the Lord's will he's heard God's word just as that one that the the foolish man hears the word of God but doesn't do it he builds his house upon the Earth so you know the will of the Lord and to know the will of the Lord and not do it that sin to know the word and to prepare not yourself that you suffer loss right says that servant will be beaten with many stripes there's a lot there you could get into in Luke chapter 12 to see more of this but to say he prepared not himself he didn't make the necessary preparations in get everything ready for his Lord's return uh to do as the Lord said that he ought to have done and this is where we're wanting to use this phrase of pro being proactive and may I don't know if it's a buzzword necessarily uh anymore they probably have a much better word so you corporate guys just let me know how I can upgrade uh to 2024 but it's to act in advance to deal with expected or anticipated difficulty that well if we get into this experience tells me that this may happen so let's do something now in anticip of the difficulty we know there's going to be trials ahead we know the enem is going to come in like a flood we know that these types of things happen so what can we do now to prepare for it when it does happen so a fool in this case the fool puts off the hard work finds a place where I could build there and doesn't worry about digging deep doesn't want to exert himself at the outset just wants to hurry up and get the house up so he can enjoy it the fool does not put in the hard work and if you say well what does this have to do with us it's a t human tendency to go take the shortcut or the easy way out it's the principle of least effort that it's just built within us that people naturally choose the path of least resistance we're kind of like water in that way that we're just going to go the easy route if there's a shortcut we want to take it that's why you could see on some campuses maybe in some neighborhoods or some parks there'll be a really nice expensive pathway and a sidewalk and nice pavers and it goes at a nice L and it angles this way it looks really really beautiful and there's a a lot of nice grass put in there and then you'll just see a path worn right through it why because people won't take the clearly defined uh uh paved route they'll take the shortcut because it's easier and that's the that's how we're all wired just as humans we're we're wired to go the take the shortcuts we're wired to go the easy route it's just a human tendency and and I I don't want to necessarily say that we're wired to be fools but maybe there's some truth to that Jesus says in Matthew 7: 13 and 14 enter ye in enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction in many there be which goeth in there at why is it a lot of people go this way because it's easier it's broad it's more convenient it's more inviting but he says you've got to enter into that the Straight Gate and he says the Straight Gate is narrow it says narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few there be that find it so there is a Broadway there is a a shortcut there's something that's easier to navigate and that's going to tend to death and destruction corruption but then there's a harder way a more difficult way he calls it the Straight Gate and narrow path but that's the only way to find blessing it's the only way to find life and it says few find it and as reminded of the statement that that prophecy that was given to brother Bram in French it says because you have chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou Hast walked of your your own choosing so let me say this uh the easy path is going to present itself and the momentum the flood as it were is going to push you that way if you just want to go with the crowd you want to do what everybody else is doing you want to do the easy thing it's just the momentum will carry you that way but you've got to make a choice to go the opposite way you've got to make that conscious Choice especially in the day and age we're living in and I'm not just talking about the world I'm not just talking about nominal religion I'm even talking about sometimes within the the social scene and the message theater that surrounds us everyone's wanting to do a certain thing or go a certain way and we have to make our own choice sometimes to choose the plain meaning of the message of the hour to choose the standard of the gospel and we might be swimming up stream and the social current but you've got to choose the harder way the narrow way because that's the only one that leads to life you've walked of your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision thou Hast made I know that that is very particular to brother brandom but I believe the principles in the scripture are the same for us that when we choose the right way it's usually the harder way it's not a shortcut it's not an easy path but when we have chose that God will bless us for it that it's a it's a it's a momentous decision anytime we choose to resist the pull of the world the flood of the social current and to do the the things that we know we ought to do as Believers and if I could say this I think I'm kind of maybe I think I'm seeding some things maybe for later this evening if we can get to it but to choose the harder way to take the the narrow way and straight As the gate to dig deep to lay the foundation uh all these things I'm talking about I'm using maybe a scriptural language and a message language I me just say it's difficult task these are hard things to do and so let me just make this point because I want to be very practical learning to communicate learning to say things that are hard to say but need to be said learning to say them in the right way communicating one with another being honest with each other learning to Humble ourselves this willingness to communicate this willingness to Humble ourselves learning to communicate learning to be humble this is why houses stand this is why houses fall is when we develop these very These Foolish habits uh that's when things can creep in and we become susceptible to storms these are the things that we could use in a scriptural language digging deep finding Bedrock building a foundation learning to communicate willing to Humble ourselves these are things that give strength to the house and guard against future failure amen I'm just going to start amening myself I need a little Dropbox here where I can just go and fire off an amen so laying a g a good foundation or building a house whether it be in the foundation or building there on requires hard work it's something that is requires hard work early on if I can put it this way it you have to be working during times of Peace during times of Peace that's when you work in times of War that's when you War it's in times of peace that you train it's in times of war that you fight and so there's laying a good foundation and building a house some of the principles we could say to so you can understand what we're pointing at it requires hard work early on and you can see yeah we're talking about practice we're talking about putting in the hard work not when it counts but in times of preparation you do it before the storm comes you you do it you do it before H uh uh things things get difficult in Proverbs chapter 28 it said we're not waiting till the Trouble Comes you're doing it in anticipation that you have an enemy and an adversary who's making do use of opportunity to find a weakness in a soft spot so you guard against the punch Proverbs 28: 19 he that tth his land shall have plenty of bread but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough it's a very simple proverb very simple principle that in order to have success in planting and growing and harvesting you have to till the land you can't just say well I got land I'm just going to throw some seed out there and expect to really yield what you should from those seeds you've got to till the land you've got to prepare the land you've got to get things out of it you've got to cultivate it you've got to dig it up and you've got to do the things necessary so that the sewing of seed can be successful he that tilth his land will have plenty of bread he that puts in the hard work long before the Harvest is the one who's not only going to have grain be able to make bread out of that grain see what the proverb is saying he that kills a land and does the work early on maybe even in the winter he's the one that'll enjoy the bread in in the coming winter but he that followeth after their vain person shall have poverty enough in Proverbs 21:25 the desire of the slothful kth him for his hands refuse to labor what a what a statement the desire of the slothful kth him for his hands refuse to labor because he's slothful he doesn't want to work what does he do but yet he still desires so he chases desire without true effort he he acquires things accumulates he does things without having a necessary Foundation to enjoy them to keep them the desire of the slothful will kill him this is coming back to how straight is the gate and narrows the way that leadth unto life there's a right way to live there's a white right way to be fruitful the desire of a slothful man will kill him because his hands refuse to labor I want to use that to emphasize this we need to be exerting greater effort in the beginning of something and in the Foundation to ensure the fitness of a of our home and our testimony in our lives in the time to come we've got to exert greater effort uh when when families are young that's when you do the really really hard work it's going to pay off later train up a child in the way that he should go don't wait till he's going to say now as you leave you got to do the work early on and I'm saying that if you're if there's a recognition now or an awareness now of anything do the work now don't put it off any more Proverbs 22: 3 and 4 a prudent man foresee the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished that would be a foolish man The Prudent the wise the providential foresees the evil and hides himself in other words he sees it come and he doesn't become a Target he doesn't make it easier he does something to protect himself knowing the Evil's coming but the simple they don't regard it enough says they pass on they're punished by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life if you want riches honor and life you have to anticipate by wisdom that what that's what wisdom does it anticipates it realizes something beforehand it and it's under expectation a a and and so it can be ahead of time and we said it this way on Sunday failure under pressure in a in a given moment when you fail it it's often the result of earlier poor effort not the the effort in the present it why did I fail now why did the house why is the house suffering so much difficulty now and say wow uh it's not that I I I don't want this to happen and I I want to get serious and I want things to be different say well this is the reason why things are hard right now is the storms are coming and it's not your lack of faith now it's you need to look and realize wow I'm suffering now for all the things I've swn before I haven't been faithful in cultivating the right things and that's not to cause us just to give up and say go ahead condemn it you know I I can't do this is to realize oh I'm only suffering now because certain things weren't done all I got to do is get that right and go on and I can weather the storm the next time a slothful man a foolish man a vain man these are all these things that keep being brought up and this may be a little bit different in terms of the emphasis but it's that wise versus foolish and in Proverbs 6: 6 to12 or maybe we'll just read to verse 11 it says go to the ant th sluggard consider her ways and be wise which having no guide overseer or ruler provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the Harvest I mean this is everyone's probably heard this scripture maybe some of the the young guys here heard it this morning uh learn from the ant thou Slugger thy slothful man who's trying to kill himself consider his ways get your example from The Ant And he says and use exercise wisdom that the ant is laboring it's working it provides meat and summer gathers food for the Harvest so it's eating in the summer but it's not eating everything it's not it's not exhausting itself it's providing for the future says how long wil thou sleep oh sluggard when wilt thou rise arise out of thy sleep get a little sleep a little Slumber Slumber little folding of the hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as one that tra travelleth and thy want as an armed man yes it's talking about uh being lazy being slothful that as the ant is proactive it's creating or controlling a situation by causing something to happen rather than just responding to it after it's happened the ant knows the Winter's coming so it's going to it knows that there's no longer going to be things that are readily available so it it creates it controls the situation ahead of time so I can say it this way if we're going to be proactive we we we can control a situation or we can create certain things by causing doing other things in anticipation of what's going to come instead of just responding immediately to what's happening and here it's saying go to the ant thou sluggard it's talking about someone who's lazy help me tonight if it makes sense and your spirit can say Amen go ahead and give me forceful amens because I I'm trying to make sense tonight and I may not be doing it and I don't mind silence you you guys could just go just just do that to me like and I'll know be like okay wow I'm completely missing it right but if I get some amens then I'll you'll be the ones that I'll look at and I'll avoid everybody else who's going but basically when one has wisdom and acts accordingly willing to put in the hard work we're saying proactive I think that's a good word to use uh prudent providential uh uh they're they're they're motivated to work they see the need for it they want to act but the opposite of that is someone who's lazy and only acts when they're forced to this is what is the image of the ant the ant is eaten in the summer but not just eating for the summer it's storing up things and Gathering food in the Harvest knowing that there's going to be a winter and things are going to be available but what happens the opposite of that is someone who's just enjoying the summer enjoying the summer and then the winter comes around and there's a fam it's like oh I need to do something I need to do something we when we procrastinate what ends up happening is we will finally act when it's absolutely necessary when we're forced to but a wise person sees the need or the danger and does things ahead of time controls the situation is already uh uh doing something in the moment saying you know what this is going to happen so I want to save against that time in Proverbs 18: 9 and 10 he also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster just love the phrases of the scripture your brother to him that is a great waser now can you this would be a good subject maybe to throw out there to uh uh you know breakout session what does this mean but it's saying he that's lazy and doesn't want to work is no different than the guy who works hard but doesn't know how to or gathers a lot but waste it the one that Wast resources and waste what he has maybe he's a hard worker a and so because of that he gathers a lot of things but he's foolish with what he has he doesn't have wisdom with what he gets he's bad and the guy who doesn't work and has nothing they're Brothers maybe twin brothers CU a man that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster but then the the next verse is so awesome the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and is safe there's the wisdom there's the righteousness trusted in the Lord he realizes I will hide in the Lord that all my work and my effort doesn't make me righteous and what I acquire doesn't make me righteous but I'm trusted in the Lord who preserves the one who blesses by all all good things come from him so it's he who acts out of trust in the Lord he will be blessed he'll find life but the slothful he's not going to work and he's going to end up in ruin and even the foolish though he labors if he doesn't labor correctly he Wast whatever he gives there's a lot of principles we could use in terms of financial discipline and those things and and financial problems causes houses to Fall by not working or not having wisdom with what you acquire but I wanting you to think of it in terms of being proactive the example of these two houses that Jesus gives and the one who had the foundation on a rock the other one who built upon the sand of the earth these two houses these two structures and their lack of foundation and their Foundation it per personifies the wise or the righteous or the foolish and the wicked when you look at it in those terms you realize that we could you could look at scriptures you could look look at teaching you could look at principles that apply to the wise and it's going to come down to these very same principles that one who hears and does he's a wise man he that hears and does is a righteous man he does right hears the word of the Lord and does the will of the Lord he that hears and doesn't do he's foolish what does he do he does sin he does iniquity he's wicked and so the wise man we see in the scripture he's prudent The Prudent man foresees the evil and prepares the foolish one does not prepare the foolish servant was the one that knew the Master's will and prepared not himself as if they had never seen the wise man sees and prepares the foolish man he can know it but he doesn't do anything like wait you knew that was going to happen yeah I knew it was going to happen why didn't you do anything well in Proverbs chap 10: 24 and 25 says the fear of the wicked it shall come upon him but the desire of the right righteous shall be granted the fear of the wicked shall come upon him now we know that there's a tremendous principle when it comes to fear that fear can create and fear the very thing that job feared Came Upon him but job was not Wicked so there's a there's a contrast an example here where we're not just trying to say anybody has fear you're going to get what's coming to you but the wicked if we can use them in the same vein as a fool the one who knows better but doesn't do it the one who hears the word of God that says if you don't do this this is going to happen like if I don't do this this is going to happen and they're like oh no that could happen and it happens right because the fear of the wicked it comes upon him but the desire of the righteous shall be granted what a what a powerful uh oppos opposites there the fear of the wicked it comes upon him he the foolish does not prepare even if he knows it's coming even if he saw it coming he acts as if he never saw therefore the fear of the wicked it comes upon him but the desire of the righteous the wise it shall be granted as the Whirlwind passeth so is the wicked no more but the righteous is in an everlasting Foundation the wicked can anticipate the the wicked can in many situations recognize this is needful or we need to do this and hears enough and understands enough but they do nothing in the moment to address it they don't respond accordingly the word of God comes forth and the one who who hears and does is like a man who builds his house upon a rock and when the rains and floods and winds come it survives it doesn't fall because he built his house upon a rock in response to the word of God so that just becomes an analogy to describe anytime that someone hears the word of God and has been told some principle that if you obey you'll survive a coming test but if you don't you're going to fail it's that principle of obedience to the word of God secures us and gives us confidence in a time of trouble and so if someone hears and doesn't respond they're not doing what they need to do in that moment despite the fact that they ought to know a wind is coming so the Wicked the foolish can know but they don't do anything to change and if I could say this the right foundation we've been talking about laying a good foundation we're talking about building a house and turning our houses into home being a house of the Lord ourselves our families and this church church we got to use wisdom to avoid problems rather than just reacting to them in the moment to be reactive it's to act after some stimulus or in instigation some something stimulates you and that's a response we might call it a a reflex to act after some something has happened and something has occurred and in that moment when you react to something you're you're suddenly responding in a way I want to make a difference between those words uh just to teach something it's just it's not just semantics but when you're reactive you can you you in that moment you take action to mitigate damage oh I need to do this so that things don't go out get out of control I need to mitigate damage or I need to start repairing damage you see the the tree has fall and the tree falls and it hits the fence and if you don't bolst up the fence it's going to hit the Tesla and you're all of a sudden responding in the moment to make sure I need to fix this I need to do this we need to do that and you're trying to hold something back you're trying to fix something in the moment so you're reacting to to it but I want to say this be proactive not reactive in other words you should in initiate change or Implement change rather than just react to an event put it this way events will come storms will come troubles will come well what does the word of God teach us now in the message of the hour in the scripture what do we know according to the word of God things that we could be doing now as Christians and message Believers in our homes in our own personal lives what are things that I should be doing now that can become a defense for me when the storm comes instead of once it starts getting windy go H I should probably pray right I I I haven't done it or run this the data but I I you wonder sometimes how many people start getting faithful to things in church whenever things are going bad and it's like I've seen you four services in a row rough time right never see you otherwise and you just begin to wonder hey what is going on they're trying to they're trying to dig deep and find foundation so there's nothing wrong with that but a lot of times what's happens we reacting in the moment rather than implementing change beforehand act in advance to deal with expected difficulty say well I'm not expecting difficulty difficult coming difficult is coming right it's going to be hard Saints right so we got to do what load up our GS it's failure failure to anticipate at failure to act wisely in the moment is what results in problems when you don't prepare yourself it increases pressure when the pressure comes we're going to suffer pressure we're going to suffer stress there's going to be difficulties but when you fail to anticipate when you can anticipate but don't act wisely that's what really causes problems to be worse I I think I just want to say it this way that's what makes pressure problems that's what makes trouble uh uh catastrophes other the pressure is going to come The Temptations are going to come the rain's going to come the flood's going to come the winds are going to come and it but that's when we haven't acted wisely it's when we haven't prepared that those things cause failure inaction opens up an opportunity for error opens up an occasion uh for something to go wrong for something to get out out of Center and so when we haven't acted beforehand it gives an opportunity for TR for uh for failure and then that's what we re react to I hope this is making some sense you know I've got my little notes here just to know the things that I want to say and and it press upon but I'm willing just to keep laboring on a particular point until we get it if you if you God gives you wisdom and you prepare yourself the trouble's still coming right the Bible tells us in this Parable the storm came to the wise men just as it did the foolish man but when the storm came and the wise man was in his house he just gathered his family together and says don't worry this is why it took me so long to build the house and the kids are like I'm sorry for getting mad that it took so long and the wife's like honey you did the right thing I know you wanted to hurry up and she was always saying well the neighbors built right away they're already in their house right and meanwhile in the neighbor's house right's like oh my goodness son hold up that wall honey go get a bucket we got to get the water and everyone's panicking in the moment and they're worried about their house that's good but they are reacting in the moment to the storm and the reality is they probably haven't put in the work necessary to keep some difficulty from causing a problem and if I could say this this is where it gets really really practical I just didn't no other way know any other way to do this than just to maybe dial it down and just say it but when we're reactive that's when we tend to be more extreme when we're reactive we tend to be a little bit more emotional or knee-jerk and and as a result more regretful when we've planned ahead of time and we know there's trouble coming and if I could just use the analogy of cooking a dinner say well we we're expecting uh 100 guests so we need to make sure we have enough meat and does this work does that work and and you plan you have contingencies you make sure things are and so that whenever you realize we're running out of this is said don't worry just do this don't worry just do that you kind of respond in the moment based upon your preparation but if if you gotten to that point and you didn't plan correctly then that's when the pressure comes on and that's when you tend to act a little bit more emotional a little bit more knee-jerk more and it's those actions in that moment that become very regretful if you're if you're not proactive you'll most likely be impulsive so be proactive not reactive plan don't panic words if you have a plan you stick to the plan you don't panic to be impulsive is to respond to or to deal with difficulty without preparation if you're impulsive you respond to a difficulty without preparation you deal with the difficulty or wrong without preparation it's like whoa whoa what's going on this is wrong this shouldn't happen and you respond to it you're impulsive and when we're impulsive I said when we're when we're reactive we begin to be emotional kind of knee-jerk uh when we're impulsive we we tend to overreact and it's the overreact re action that I can say this about leadership impulsive leadership reactive leadership tends to overcorrect comes down way too hard way too harsh because there's no established parameters there was no expectation in terms of the way things we would expect things to play out and this is where it gets very very practical in our own individual relationships our accountability to one another the boundaries that we set in life and the way that we navigate even our home life when we're just reacting in the moment to whatever comes up that leads to a very negative dynamic very emotional reactive impulsive and so we let something happen and then we gets to a point where it's crisis mode and there's a problem when we're reactive or impulsive we can get extreme and then we overcorrect because beforehand we hadn't established some sort of guideline of what to do when that happens it's like what in the world are you talking about well let's just say that you your child ask you if they can go out with their friend and you say yeah you can go out and you never establish any other means of communication or parameters so when they get back at 3:00 in the morning you're like why' you do this why what what's happening and and there's a you're never going out again right you're grounded from your friends for the rest of your life and you respond in the moment very intense and very reactive because what are you to do you never set any expectations for the child's obedience or Disobedience and you yourself are responding the moment I never for a moment thought that they wouldn't come home after midnight it's like well maybe you should think about that maybe you should begin to run run through your mind these different scenarios that you say you establish ahead of time you can go out but I need need you home by a certain time and if you're not home by a certain time these are the consequences so that when they don't come home by a certain time it's like consequence right there's no fight shouldn't be no argument you knew ahead of time like well I didn't know you were serious you're a fool right right cuz you knew ahead of time that's right I told you ahead of time go to thou Slugger your brother to a great waster and and that you realize in that moment yes I've I've I've said my my children up for success by telling them what I expect and what the consequences are if they obey or if they disobey and I've done myself a lot of good by anticipating in doing some hard work in the beginning to have conversations and to think about consequences and and think about what what's happening I can say this just looking out upon the congregation a lot of us are in the same place in life where when you've got kids that are zero uh two days to 12 12 years old there's a lot of things you can control but once they start getting older there's a lot of things they have access to a lot of things they even need and you've got to be anticipating what the difficulties might be around that you buy your child a phone and then issues arise and in your anger you take this iPhone 16 Pro Max and you throw it on the ground because you caught them doing something you didn't want them to do they weren't obedient in the moment you you trash the phone because beforehand you didn't say we're going to buy you this phone these are the terms of use this is how you can use it this is what we want you to do within our home and if at any point you don't honor that these are the consequences that's right you don't have to react in the moment to completely abolish something when that happens typically if I can put it this way you're impulsive you're reactive you're caught up in the moment and this is this is why houses fall and I don't mean divorce and kids leave and you never see your children again but let me just say if you have a lot of negative uh toxic behaviors within your home you haven't set up boundaries and you haven't found ways to show love yeah it can happen in a really really bad way where it all falls apart but typically when you're impulsive or reactive you're not really addressing the issue you're just handling the the the symptoms you're just dealing with Fallout and in your overcorrection you just go from one error to another you didn't establish parameters so you you gave them a ditch that they could fall into uh and and I know maybe I'm being I'm focusing more on raising children uh and and I think that's just a really good place to hit it and then we can think about other ways it can apply in our lives but when you haven't you haven't given clear direction or you haven't done the hard work in the beginning of what does this look like what are the potential problems what does the word of God say how can we do these things you provide a ditch for them to get into but sometimes what we do and we jerk them out we just throw them right into another we find another ditch because now we've grounded them from everything we've thrown this away we've done this we've done that and it creates a real costic negative environment go from one error to another you you you buy something or you allow for something then we start threatening that we're going to take it away we're going to ground them and and that's impulse knee-jerk type of parenting when we're reactive we're not considering maybe something we should have done before hand or not even considering the real cause like what was the source of the problem why why did my child do this and you could ask yourself well I didn't control for the fact that maybe an 18-year-old going out with his friends would want to stay out as late as he wants and to tell him be home by such time now if that doesn't matter in your family you don't have curfew or whatever I mean I'm not trying to impose some sort of curfew I hope I was ambiguous enough let's just say a child of a certain age stays out to a certain time that we well brother Aaron said I could stay till 3: in the morning or brother Aaron says we have to be back at 10: you're the Pastors in your home don't ask me what curfew should be but there's uh it's the principle of consequence and and expect expectations and and watching out over your children and being that Holy Ghost that we we ought to be to our children and guiding them correctly when we just uh respond to something and we're reacting to something we haven't appropriately thought well what would they be doing in this situation and because we haven't thought about that it this confrontation happens and things start to get a little bit out of control and when that happens you're not ever really dealing with the fact that you ex there was a curfew or that there was Disobedience you begin to deal with the interaction that you have with the individual you just deal with the Fallout and the symptoms not the actual problem and days later you're arguing about what time they got home instead of the problem to begin with in Proverbs 18: 18 excuse me Proverbs 11: 18 and 19 I'm not going to be able to finish some things here but I I was wanting to read in Proverbs 11 later or earlier on in this when it this chapter begins with the false balances and Abomination to the Lord and it's talk about the Integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgressor shall def uh destroy them this is this this building principles in chapter 11 is things that are right they are the way that they ought to be there's no pretense there's no there's no deceit a false balance is an Abomination to the Lord but a just weight is his Delight Integrity of the upright will guide them if you're upright if you're wise Integrity is what guides us but the wicked by his own wickedness he's perverse it destroys them the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way the righteous are delivered from Death the righteousness of the upright shall deliver them there's this this if you go back and read through verse 11 there's a lot that this is built on but it says the wicked worketh a deceit but to him that Seth righteousness shall be a sure reward as righteousness tendeth to life so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death as we try to use that ification of wise and foolish righteous and wicked the Wicked the foolish Works a deceitful work it's that house of cards it's the pretense oh look at that nice house it's not on a rock it's not going to last no matter how beautiful is it it's not built to last no matter how inviting it might seem to be there's no life there in it's just destruction they're going to be starting all over but a righteous person SS and labors and works and he's going to get a sure reward righteousness wisdom doing the hard work all these things that we're using in the sense of being proactive not reactive that res tends to life but he that pursues evil is impulsive and overreacts and overcorrects and in the moment gets caught up in the emotions because they're just being reactive they're pursuing that's foolishness and it results in loss so wisdom reacts but let me put it this way wisdom all wisdom is proactive but it's also re it's it it's it's not reactive it's responsive and I'm I know this may seem like oh this is just some psycho Babble but it I labored very a lot years ago when I preached on this I labored a lot just to be able to convey it through terminology to catch the meaning of a lot of scripture and a lot of quotes that wisdom is anticipating Prudence is anticipating in doing the hard work now to avoid problems later that's being proactive foolishness is no one you need to do the work and when the storm comes reacting in the moment now it wouldn't be wise to have had wisdom and planned and heard different things and then things begin to change and circumstances change and not respond to a changing landscape to not respond say well it was yeah well they were 10 years old and they did this and it's fine well they're not 10 years old anymore right oh oh they grew up that way they were always doing that oh they're like best friends a boy and a girl oh they're just best friends they grew up together and now at 17 18 years old you want them to just keep doing the same things they did when they're seven or eight wait a minute time out you wisdom says you need to respond sometimes when circumstances change so what wisdom does is it's it responds so I say be responsive not reactive very dangerous to be reactive to a storm to respond in the moment in a panic but it's not wrong to respond when you need to if I could put it this way reactive is the negative emot emotional uh response the negative approach or the negative actions to a situation so it's something that's negative something that's harsh something that's overreactive or impulsive that would say that's being reactive but being responsive would be your positive uh uh spiritual wise actions to a situation and I would I I would argue this as I try to find a stopping point our ability to to respond and not react largely depends upon our planning largely depends upon our preparation then in the moment you say oh I knew this might happen so I need to respond so when we say wisdom and being proactive it doesn't mean you won't have to act in the moment to do something but in the moment you can respond instead of just react it doesn't buy yourself some future laziness it just buys you some future rest buys you some future confidence I put in the work when the time comes I may have to act I may have to respond but I'm not going to be overreacting I'm not going to be knee-jerk I'm not going to be impulsive I'm not going to be emotional I'm going to be able to respond because I've planned I've prepared in Proverbs 10: 1-6 a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother so the the wise son makes a glad father but a foolish son makes a sad mother cuz the father's going like it's not my fault you're the one responsible for for the kids which is not right A wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother Treasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness deliverthat scripture right there the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but he casteth away the substance of the wicked is that not what we see even in the parable of the wise men building on a rock and the foolish man who built upon the Earth God says if you do what I say it'll preserve you but if you don't you're going to lose things it'll be caused to be wasted away the Whirlwind will pass and the wicked will lose but the righteous is on an everlasting Foundation he becometh poor that dealth with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh Rich he that gathereth in summer is a wise son but he that sleepeth in Harvest is a son that causeth shame blessings are upon the head of the just but violence cover the mouth of the wicked it speaks to the the how the upright and the righteous are willing they're willing to work they're willing to do good they're willing to labor they're willing to do the things that are necessary for Spiritual success they're willing to do things necessary to see that no evil will come nigh their dwelling it's not just knowing that there's evil out there and then when the evil comes say well we need to fight this devil we need to fight this devil it's doing the right things to know that when the fight comes you're prepared for the fight but we become poor we become destitute we Cast Away we lose we're deprived of substance when we deal when we act foolishly and this is where some of these statements when it says who shall abide in my Tabernacle he that walks uprightly who works righteousness and speaks truth he doesn't backbite with his tongue he doesn't do evil to his neighbor he doesn't take up a reproach against his neighbor who who when he swears to his own hurt he doesn't change and in Psalms 15 1:5 it's going through all these things that have to do with Integrity with wisdom how we use our mouth how we use our words how we treat one another and it says he that doeth these things shall never be moved if you want to be strong during a difficult time live correctly during the good times if you want to if you want to survive in a time of War be good in a time of Peace if you want to be able to overcome the enemy in a time of Temptation live holy and write and do the hard things and live live close to God and serve one another in times of feasting be humble and so if I'm if I'm wanting to teach you tonight that as a Christian we ought to be wise in other words be be res uh to be proactive not just reactive kneejerk impulsive where we overcorrect we get real harsh we say and do things that just complicate things but then I don't I do want you to also respond in situations being responsive requires humility well let me say this it requires honesty like ah we need to respond to this I'm not just going to dig in my heels and say but we're a righteous family we've done everything we need to we built the right foundation no chances are it's not if you get a little hotti or arrogant because to be responsive we have to be honest there's a need and I need the humility to respond the honesty is to recognize that the humility is to take care of it you know what things aren't the way maybe I thought they were so I need to respond to this in no way would I want you to take these things I'm saying about being proactive to where you do what you ought to do and in the moment where it looks like things are falling apart you just go well my hands are tied brother Aaron said what I did yesterday is going to determine what happens today so I guess I just need to let the cards fall where they do no that's not what I'm saying that's not what the Bible says if you thought you did what you should have done the day before before and you were sincere but it didn't prepare you for what's happening in that moment prove you're not a fool and respond wisely that's where the Heathen knows and rages he doesn't realize he needs to react differently and I could say I'll say this the response our response in crisis is going to determine how we get through it when we're going through it when you're going through the store when things are happening when there's difficulty when there's misunderstandings when there's backsliding when there's sin at your door your response is going to determine whether this this temptation this battle resolves in Victory resolves in gain or whether this conflict is even resolved at all or escalated when the enemy comes like in in like a flood our response is going to determine whether or not we get swashed away or whether we stand and your response is going to determine whether or not we can find a way to resolve it ultimately or it just gets worse and that's where I say there's a difference between responding to a situation which means we're going to address this need and confronting a situation we all know the difference right if you say well I've never thought of it that way there's a difference when someone wants to address something that's not right and when someone confronts something that's not right it's a huge difference between confronting a problem and addressing it and I'm not just saying by terminology when you confront something you meet it h hosti you meet with hos hostility or argumented of intent to face with Defiance or hostility there's this anger there's this disappointment this displeasure typically when we confront something we're probably trying to shame the person who's who's made us upset or did something wrong but when you address something the word to address means to guide to aim or direct the righteous shall be delivered from difficulty the righteous shall direct his way the Integrity of the upright shall guide him the righteous the wise address a situation where they guide they aim or direct it means to go straight toward to set right or to make straight our reactions escalate our conflicts to where now we're no longer discussing what happened but how we responded to what happened this I think this characterizes just about most fights that we have if we get in a verbal argument is we start talking about how each person responded to the situation not really the situation right we just kind of get lost in the whole you don't talk to me like that well you and then next thing you know it's like all we're doing is we're talking the fight is all about the fight the argument is all about the argument instead of saying all right time out what's the problem again what's the issue the fact that I didn't tell you that I wanted you home by 11 o'clock that's the problem and and you took advantage of that child I'm sorry I should have been more clear right and and and you find a way to address what happened instead of just fighting and then getting into a conflict that further instigates more conflict to where you don't even know what you're fighting for anymore so it's our reaction that can make it worse and I'll say sometimes it's our inaction that's even worse when we're being reactive we're often times just mirroring the intensity of the other person so if they're offended we're offended if they're mad we get mad if they're jealous we get jealous if they want to throw some crazy terms out there we're going to throw crazy right back oh no you didn't all right I can too that's usually what happens when we respond we're reacting in the moment to something that's heated instead of addressing something like we ought to we just kind of mirror the attitude of the offender how many times have we acted like our child when we were correcting our child right don't ever hit someone ever h someone in Anger right it's like I'm just mirring I'm with the same I'm going to kill you for killing somebody else right it's that that conflict of logic but sometimes we're just doing the same thing we respond in kind I think our need jerk reaction is when we see a bully we want to bully him right it's our knee-jerk reaction when we see a bully especially as an adult we see a little kid boy like you don't do that who do you think you are man picking on somebody small than you you think you're all big and bad huh you want to go you want to go it's like well who's the bully you're the adult in the room but we'll mirror we'll we'll mimic we'll just disr back it's our reaction to a situation instead of addressing it but if you're responsive you're honest there's no pretense involved you're not stubborn you're not digging your heels in you're not just saying well I put in the hard work and I'm a Christian and I've served the Lord for so long and I'm a message believer and I laid the right foundation you assess you got wisdom you're like you know what something's wrong we need to address this we've offended somebody what can we do to make it right and not just say well I'm doing right or maybe even we're unwilling to recognize that there's issues in our family well my kids's not that way it's your fault or sometimes we just get to where we like well they just need to get over it and in the moment you're not responding you want to dig in I didn't do anything wrong I didn't say anything wrong and that may be true but you dig in and you get obstinate and you get stubborn and you don't respond in a way that can resolve it you respond in a way that just escalates it and it gets worse and it gets worse and gets worse so when we don't respond that's why houses fall musicians if you'd come when we're reactive that's why houses fall and so well how do we how do we sum this up well I'm not going to try to sum it up but I will say this we pray and ask God to give us wisdom because guiding being led in this hour is difficult as Leaders it's difficult as husbands and as fathers we live in a very difficult time with a lot of traps and a lot of ditches and we're we're constantly needing to be led ourselves and so we ask God to lead us we ask God to guide us because we've got to guide hearts hearts of our children we got to protect the hearts of our wives we got to be protect there's a lot that's on our plate even for mothers and wives there's a lot that we are wrestling with so what do we ask God for wisdom and he tells us to ask and he's not going to rebuke you for asking Lord I need wisdom in this situation I need to know how to respond and if I could say this as a way of trying to just bring it to a close is I think there's a lot if you're in a time of Peace if you're in a time of rest if you're in a time where things are going well this is the time to strengthen yourself this is the time to really dig in and apply yourself and uh uh find you know make sure that your Bedrock is secure and keep doing what you know you ought to do as a Christian because the winds will come and when the winds come you need to be secure where you're standing and so in that moment you can respond with praise respond with prayer respond in the way that you know the word has already dictated you to respond if you need to respond in a way it says whoa whoa whoa we've been doing this we've been doing this this was our plan we were going to do this we were going to do this and things start happening and you realize no this isn't working out you just respond I think there's sometimes we get it in our heads that this is what I got to do this is what I got to do and the Lord just starts trying to show us all sorts of ways like slow down don't do it but we get stuck ubn we're just going to no bless God this is what God wants me to do this is the will of God and we foolishly just plow ahead not recognizing all the warning signs that God's trying to give us so we have to ask God for we we need to ask him for wisdom and if you're in that storm now the walls are shaking if things are are or it looks like things are falling don't despair it's not a literal storm form you it's not your literal house it's spiritual you can say well there's my literal family brother Aaron but the problems that are being exposed are weaknesses that God can correct if we're willing to be honest and humble to act and if failure to hear was a problem say Lord open my ears to hear if failure to obey was a problem then say Lord forgive me for not responding forgive me for not acting I hear and now Lord I want to obey I'm going to yield myself and just know that in the same way that the problems came because of Disobedience I believe that problems can be reversed through obedience if by one man's Disobedience sin and death entered through one man's obedience death is conquered and sin has been vanquished it shows for us a pattern in our own individual lives where my Disobedience and stubbornness has caused me great harm my humility and asking for forgiveness and repentance will bring me great Victory and virtue and healing and I believe there are no lost causes whether it be your own adult children whether it be your own marriage whatever it might be I am not going to say there is a lost cause because I believe the word the word can but I want us to all be very familiar with this Dynamic more in terms of ahead of time so it can be wisdom so that we can begin to act in a way that we ought to so that when the difficulty comes we can rest securely in that house amen I trust it makes some sense to you these are things I've been tracking for quite some time maybe just the last couple years I've had these principles at different times and different sermons to share and I just felt impressed today even if it doesn't make sense in the context share it so if it was wrong and it it was messed up I'll respond the right way just please don't react the the wrong way just kind of guide me a little bit just address it brother Aaron it didn't make a lick of sense like that time when I got up and I said that my favorite vegetable was an onion and the brother from Africa had said that he didn't like honey and I thought he said onions and Jack thought he said onions so I was in good company and just out of the middle of nowhere I said my favorite vegetabl is an onion take that right and everybody's like well that's really weird he needs his blood sugar must be he needs a Snickers he needs some milk but you know there's situations where if someone makes a mistake all someone had to do is they came to me and said um I think he said honey and I was like oh right and you realize hey I need to make that right or I need to I need to clarify L people think I'm losing it and if when people approach you the right way it's easier to respond the right way and and I'm realizing now that just all these things are just so heavy on my heart it's just one big huge picture but if I could say this to the men maybe I'll pick up on this more later that when we can be responsive we can be proactive and responsive not reactive and not panicky when we can plan we can PR when we can do our part especially even as parents we make it easier on everyone else because when I'm learning to address a situation I don't I don't get maybe the same def defensive responses from my children when I learn to address a situation I don't get the same Rea prideful reaction from my husband why because I've learned that there's a way that I can approach this to resolve the issue instead of escalated and so there's there's what things that we can do to to strengthen our families to make our houses homes and I desire I desire that the peace of God would reign supreme in your individual house in your home and in this church God bless you let's stand to our feet
