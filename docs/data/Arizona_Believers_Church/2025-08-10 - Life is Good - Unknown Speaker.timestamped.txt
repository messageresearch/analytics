[0:00] Proverbs 8:es 32-36.
[0:06] Now therefore hearken unto me, oh ye
[0:08] children, for blessed are they that keep
[0:10] my ways. Hear instruction, and be wise,
[0:14] and refuse it not. Blessed is the man
[0:17] that heareth me, watching daily at my
[0:19] gates, waiting at the post of my doors.
[0:22] For who so findeth me findeth life, and
[0:25] shall obtain favor of the Lord. But he
[0:28] that sinnth against me
[0:31] wrongeth his own soul. All they that
[0:33] hate me love death. Again, that was
[0:36] Proverbs 8:es 32-36. I forgot to update
[0:40] my title slide there. So, you can be
[0:42] seated.
[0:45] I'm going to give the title today, Life
[0:47] is Good. And in giving it this title,
[0:50] it's kind of the opposite of what I'd
[0:51] originally been thinking about calling
[0:53] it that, you know, death is bad or
[0:55] something like that. Uh, but I figured
[0:57] there's been enough uh maybe emphasis on
[0:59] evil to where at least in the title we
[1:01] could just lighten it a little bit. And
[1:03] you'll see kind of the parallel in this
[1:05] to say life is good. And maybe we say
[1:07] that sometimes when things are going
[1:08] well, man, life is good when we're uh
[1:11] drinking Lacroy on the Colorado River
[1:14] looking at the beautiful mountains and
[1:16] we feel really good about life. We say
[1:17] life is good. But I mean it more than
[1:20] that. I'm meaning more to it than just
[1:21] maybe a moment where things are feeling
[1:23] feeling fine. And we've been looking at
[1:26] uh the art of music and using even the
[1:29] subject of music theory over the last
[1:31] few services on how that within a
[1:33] composition or piece of music there's
[1:35] the use of consonants which we've been
[1:37] uh we using as a type of good and also
[1:39] dissonance which we're using as a type
[1:41] of evil and how that God has even
[1:43] allowed those two to exist within his
[1:45] drum and what's unfolding in his great
[1:47] symphony. But we're not even saying
[1:49] about evil. part of the symphony, each
[1:51] one having its part and but yet it's
[1:53] something that God uses and this is
[1:55] God's way of even that tension and that
[1:57] relief of tension and those expectations
[2:00] and that it's just it's the way that God
[2:02] works. And so we've been looking at the
[2:03] subject of good and evil and also using
[2:06] uh the theme of music and exploring
[2:08] music in a lot of different ways. So
[2:09] that's where we're at today as we just
[2:11] ministered on good and evil Wednesday
[2:13] night. And in Ecclesiastes chapter 3, we
[2:16] looked at those first eight verses in
[2:17] that chapter and how that the writer
[2:19] Solomon the preacher he calls himself
[2:22] says that there's a time too. And in
[2:23] that we see these intervals, a time to
[2:25] be born, a time to die. And there's
[2:27] these different things that kind of go
[2:28] back and forth, plant and pluck. And
[2:30] there's those rhythms or cycles. And
[2:34] these are seasons or even changes in
[2:37] life. And those time too, it's not that
[2:39] we got to know what time it is so that
[2:41] we can do it. It just means occasions
[2:43] that there's times when we're laughing,
[2:45] there's times when we're c crying and
[2:47] there seems to be this cycle, these
[2:49] waves or circuits as it were where
[2:51] there's occasions of joy and we
[2:53] experience those and we enjoy those. But
[2:54] then there's also occasions of sadness.
[2:57] And when we look at that, we find that
[2:59] even where there's happiness and there's
[3:01] life and there's planting and there's
[3:02] rejoicing, that evil cannot be avoided
[3:06] in this life. It just seems like it runs
[3:08] its course. Just as the observer said,
[3:10] the preacher said in Ecclesiastes, I see
[3:13] that the earth ever remains and
[3:15] generation passes one to the next. But
[3:17] even then, the earth doesn't stay
[3:19] constant. Even the earth experiences
[3:21] these cycles and seasons of winter and
[3:23] summer and the sun coming up and coming
[3:25] down and the rivers running out into the
[3:27] ocean. So there's a lot there that
[3:29] happens even in the cycles of nature. We
[3:32] realize that there will always be good
[3:35] and evil.
[3:37] And so he concludes this in Ecclesiastes
[3:40] 12 13 to 14. Let us hear the conclusion
[3:43] of the whole matter. Fear God and keep
[3:45] his commandments for this is the whole
[3:48] duty of man. I will admit that until I
[3:51] began to look at this more deeply
[3:52] recently that I used to think that that
[3:54] is our whole responsibility. It's our
[3:56] singular responsibility is to fear God
[3:58] and keep his commandments. But it
[4:00] actually maybe means more than that just
[4:02] from the standpoint of duty where we
[4:04] have this responsibility. But rather it
[4:06] just means this is the totality of
[4:08] everything.
[4:09] &gt;&gt; This is everything. Fear God and keep
[4:11] his commandments. Not that it's well
[4:13] this is what you're supposed to do and
[4:15] this is what you must do and this is
[4:16] what you have to do. But he looks at all
[4:17] he says this is all there is. This is
[4:20] the only thing that resolves the the
[4:22] vexations. This is the only thing that
[4:24] can even give any kind of meaning to
[4:26] vanity whatsoever is to fear God and
[4:29] keep his commandments.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; So he took into consideration the
[4:32] vanities, the cycles, the ups and downs,
[4:34] the good and evil and all those
[4:36] vexations. And he says there's only one
[4:37] soloulless trust in God. There's only
[4:40] one thing that's going to make sense to
[4:42] a man because he says he does this, he
[4:43] does that. He labors, he strives, he
[4:45] accumulates, he tries to use, and then
[4:47] in the end it doesn't work out. And what
[4:48] is left? He dies. He's not even
[4:50] remembered. You don't even know what
[4:51] comes after you. And there's this
[4:53] thought where he says, "You know what?
[4:54] The only thing I can say is trust in
[4:56] God. Fear God. It's not to be nervous
[4:59] about him, but it's a trust. It's a
[5:00] reverence. It's to be in awe of him who
[5:02] controls all things."
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; And in Psalms 37:27, fear God and keep
[5:07] his commandments, for this is the whole
[5:09] duty of man. This is a totality of
[5:11] everything. He says, "Because God will
[5:12] judge everything, whether it be good or
[5:13] evil." So the psalmist says, "Depart
[5:16] from evil and do good and dwell forever
[5:19] more." So there's some sense of
[5:21] permanence and constants when we depart
[5:25] from evil and do good. We assue evil. We
[5:28] avoid it. We abhore it. We put evil at
[5:30] arms length. So there has to be some
[5:32] necessary recognition of evil. We don't
[5:35] want to be like those who call evil good
[5:37] and say, "Isn't everything wonderful?
[5:38] Isn't everything good?" But there is an
[5:40] evil. But then not just to depart from
[5:43] evil, but we must also do good. Now, on
[5:48] just another uh little added depth to
[5:52] the uh idea of good,
[5:55] I have to have to say that it's been a
[5:57] real uh wrestling and battling on this
[5:59] subject and getting ready for the
[6:01] service today and just trying to find
[6:02] the mind of the Lord and piece this all
[6:04] together uh in a way that I felt like
[6:06] met the burden that God was giving me.
[6:07] So, there's maybe a lot of things I just
[6:09] need your help in today. So, pray for
[6:11] me. But there's this idea of good and
[6:14] evil that I would say exist within our
[6:16] human realm
[6:18] &gt;&gt; and and then there's so there's that
[6:20] good and evil and I'm not and that's not
[6:22] even necessarily evil being the devil
[6:24] and good being God just a good and evil
[6:26] that's very human but then there's this
[6:28] other dimension kind of like this upward
[6:31] shift where we say there's a good that
[6:34] transcends all that
[6:36] &gt;&gt; and so as much as maybe we aren't
[6:37] getting into that I want you to see that
[6:39] particular aspect because you don't have
[6:41] to be Christian to experience times of
[6:43] being born, times of dying, times of
[6:45] joy, time of sadness. And so there's
[6:47] those cycles to life that exist within
[6:49] mankind. But then there's this other
[6:51] dimension, this third part where God
[6:53] says this other plan, he says, there's a
[6:54] good that is of God's alone. In Matthew
[6:58] 19 16-1 17, and behold, one came and
[7:02] said unto him, good master, what good
[7:05] thing shall I do that I may have eternal
[7:07] life? So there is this desire to live
[7:11] forever more, to never die, to have that
[7:14] permanent place in the Messiah kingdom
[7:16] forever. What may I do to have eternal
[7:19] life? And Jesus answered in verse 17,
[7:22] why callst thou me good?
[7:25] There is none good but one, that is God.
[7:29] Now, this would be a concept or idea
[7:31] amongst the Jews where those that lived
[7:33] well and abided by the law and observed
[7:35] certain commandments, they were good.
[7:37] And the they the the teachers, the
[7:39] Pharisees, the scribes, those of certain
[7:41] orders, they they were good. So now it's
[7:43] good master. We want to identify you as
[7:45] someone who's devoted, someone who's a
[7:46] teacher. He says, "Don't call me good
[7:48] because there's none good but one that
[7:50] is God. But if thou will enter into
[7:53] life, keep the commandments." So there's
[7:55] that symmetry once again. and fear God
[7:57] and keep his commandments. So God is
[8:00] good.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; We say God is good. We don't mean it in
[8:03] the same way that we might say eating at
[8:05] Ritos and say this is good. This is some
[8:08] inherent characteristic of God that God
[8:11] is good.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; He's pleasant. He's agreeable. He's
[8:14] honorable. We can maybe use another
[8:16] word. God is goodness.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Deuteronomy 6:4, "Hero
[8:21] is of the Lord. Our God is one Lord."
[8:25] So God is one. We should recognize that
[8:28] there is one God. As they say, as it's
[8:30] repeated in the New Testament, there is
[8:31] one God and he is one.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; This is God who is singular. It's God
[8:37] that lives on this one. He is Lord.
[8:40] That's Yahweh, the self-existing one.
[8:43] There's only one. And so God is good.
[8:46] And we know that God is a light and God
[8:48] is love.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Then good is one.
[8:52] Good is something singular. It's
[8:54] something whole. It's something
[8:55] righteous and pure. And in that good,
[8:58] there is light. That good is love.
[8:59] There's a lot we could say about God in
[9:01] his goodness. And that's a singular
[9:04] h oneness and a singular good. But I
[9:08] would say this that evil is indefinite.
[9:12] When you say indefinite, it just it's an
[9:14] undetermined length of time. It seems to
[9:18] be limitless, but it's not infinite.
[9:21] And it's varied. and it's fragmented and
[9:23] it comes in all sorts of different ways
[9:24] and it often times uh even the to the
[9:27] one that does evil to him it's not evil
[9:30] &gt;&gt; but to the one who experiences it may
[9:32] seem to be obvious. So there's something
[9:35] about evil where it is uh apparent
[9:39] but yet God is not like evil varied
[9:42] fragmented and and not infinite but God
[9:45] is eternal. Amen.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; He's one. He's complete.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; As William Kalper wrote in his hymn or
[9:50] the poem, he said, "God moves in
[9:52] mysterious ways his wonders to perform."
[9:55] That is a one God acting singularly
[9:57] according to one purpose. And his ways
[10:00] are mysterious. They're past finding out
[10:02] that he even himself hides the end from
[10:04] the beginning. And that God uh is a God
[10:06] who hideth himself.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; So there's a mysterious element even to
[10:12] this. Good.
[10:15] Goodness is that which is free from
[10:17] injury.
[10:18] Goodness is that which is uh free of
[10:21] violation. Evil it would be the
[10:22] opposite. Yet goodness itself and good
[10:25] remains mysterious because it's
[10:27] transcendent.
[10:30] So that is maybe just looking at this
[10:33] oneness of good
[10:36] and this good that is attributable to
[10:38] God. And therefore I say life is good.
[10:43] Life is good and I want to look at the
[10:46] subject of death not as an opposite to
[10:48] that life
[10:51] but this evil that exists within this
[10:53] stream of humanity and addressing the
[10:57] subject of death
[10:59] I think it it's good sometimes just to
[11:01] look at it and consider it
[11:05] for the purpose of understanding God
[11:07] better
[11:08] &gt;&gt; and I would say that this death is an
[11:11] evil that haunts mankind kind. It is
[11:13] unavoidable.
[11:15] In Genesis 2:9, it says, "Out of the
[11:18] ground, the Lord God made the Lord God
[11:21] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[11:23] the sight and good for food that
[11:26] springing forth." The Lord caused to
[11:27] grow or spring forth every tree that is
[11:30] beautiful to look upon. The symmetry I
[11:34] beauty, it's harmonious composition, and
[11:37] it's also good for food. So those trees
[11:39] that you could eat the fruit of grew out
[11:41] of the ground. Then in this separate
[11:43] designation, the tree of life also in
[11:45] the midst or the middle of the garden,
[11:47] he places it there. It's there within
[11:49] the middle of the garden. And the tree
[11:51] of knowledge of good and evil. I may for
[11:55] brevity sake today refer to the tree of
[11:57] life as the tree of life, but then the
[11:59] tree of knowledge of good and evil refer
[12:01] to it to the as the tree of knowledge.
[12:04] I'd like for you to consider that the
[12:06] tree of life and the tree of knowledge
[12:08] present to us two different kinds of
[12:10] conditions or maybe even existences
[12:12] where there's one of goodness and life.
[12:14] That's the tree of life. But then
[12:16] there's this other one of mixed
[12:18] knowledge. It's not purely good. It's
[12:20] not purely evil, but it's a mixed tree.
[12:22] And that would describe a another kind
[12:24] of existence. And being symbolic trees,
[12:27] they have fruits or characteristics of
[12:29] each one that is associated with the
[12:31] power or the life that exists within it.
[12:34] So there's a tree of life that would
[12:36] have certain characteristics that are
[12:37] made known by the fruit that it bears.
[12:39] Then you have the tree of knowledge and
[12:41] it is of that tree of knowledge that the
[12:42] woman parttook in the fruit of that and
[12:46] it has certain characteristics and
[12:48] certain consequences. In Genesis 2 16
[12:52] and uh 17. And the Lord God commanded
[12:55] the man, saying, "Of every tree of the
[12:57] garden, thou mayest freely eat, but of
[13:00] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[13:02] evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in
[13:05] the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
[13:07] shalt surely die." Quite a commandment,
[13:11] one that we're all probably very
[13:13] familiar with that this tree of
[13:14] knowledge has is a tree of a certain
[13:17] kind of consequence. The day that you
[13:19] eat thereof, that day you'll die. The
[13:23] fruit of the tree of knowledge brings
[13:25] death.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; In its description, it's merely the tree
[13:28] of knowledge of good and evil. But the
[13:30] fruits of this tree bring death.
[13:34] And the fruits of it are evil.
[13:37] They're temporary. They even exist
[13:38] within time.
[13:41] But the tree of life is associated with
[13:44] all that is good. Tree of life is
[13:47] associated with all that is eternal. The
[13:50] tree of life is connected with creation.
[13:52] The creation that God said he loved. The
[13:54] creation in the world that God said he
[13:56] loved. And the one that he looked at and
[13:57] said, "This is good."
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Now, I think this is important to
[14:02] recognize this that this there's a
[14:05] creation which is of the tree of life,
[14:07] sustained by the tree of life, and
[14:09] that's the world that God loves. That's
[14:11] the world that God said was good. So,
[14:13] there's the tree of life and its fruits.
[14:15] this is good. But now there's this
[14:17] ominous tree of knowledge of good and
[14:20] evil that God says if you partake of
[14:22] that fruit, you're going to you're going
[14:25] to exist in something that is not the
[14:27] original creation. And I'm going to
[14:30] characterize it ultimately as death.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; And now notice in Jeremiah 10:12
[14:38] because I want you to recognize
[14:40] Wednesday night we pointed out in the
[14:41] scripture how Jesus Christ is that tree
[14:43] of life. And it says he made God made
[14:46] the earth by his power and he
[14:49] established the world by his wisdom. And
[14:52] he stretched out the heavens by his
[14:53] discretion. How did God make the world?
[14:56] By his power. How did he establish it,
[14:59] sustain it? By his wisdom. How does he
[15:02] determine its breadth and its length? By
[15:04] his discretion. There's a lot that's
[15:06] said in just this one uh sentence here.
[15:09] He made the earth by his power. He
[15:10] establishes it and sustains it by his
[15:12] wisdom. and he stretches it out its
[15:14] lengths and its bounds by his own will
[15:16] or discretion, his his knowledge and
[15:19] discernment. So God made the world by
[15:22] his power and establishes it by his
[15:24] wisdom in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 24.
[15:27] But unto them which are called both Jews
[15:29] and Greeks, the gospel is what? Christ.
[15:32] Christ the power of God and the wisdom
[15:36] of God. So when it says that he made the
[15:38] earth by his power and established the
[15:40] world by his wisdom, this is done
[15:42] through Christ. This logos,
[15:45] &gt;&gt; he does it by Christ. When you read in
[15:47] the beginning, what do we read? There is
[15:49] Christ.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. There's
[15:52] Christ. In the beginning, God created.
[15:54] There's Christ.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; In Colossians chapter 1 15 to1 17,
[15:59] speaking of Christ, who is the image of
[16:01] the invisible God, the firstborn of
[16:03] every creature. For by him were all
[16:06] things created
[16:08] &gt;&gt; that are in heaven and that are in
[16:09] earth, visible and invisible, whether
[16:12] they be thrones or dominions or
[16:13] principalities or powers. All things are
[16:15] created by him by what? The power of
[16:17] God, the wisdom of God.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; And he has gone. He is before all things
[16:21] and by him all things consist because he
[16:24] establishes and it is sustained by
[16:28] Christ, the power of God.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; It's made by the wisdom of God. Amen.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; And so Christ being the tree of life, he
[16:36] is the wisdom and power of God that
[16:39] would have symbolized the source of all
[16:41] life and the sustaining power for all
[16:44] that was created.
[16:47] God's power and wisdom were demonstrated
[16:50] in how that he in in creating and
[16:54] sustaining and determining the bounds of
[16:55] life. And I say that's good because
[16:58] that's the remark that God made each
[17:00] time. It is good. Could even be said
[17:02] that creation was the purpose of divine
[17:05] love. That creation is what was his aim.
[17:10] Creation itself is an act of love.
[17:13] Creation being an act of love. Evil is
[17:16] the opposite
[17:17] &gt;&gt; of creation.
[17:22] in the dawn of evil or this dissonance
[17:25] that interrupts
[17:27] and we we come into this interval
[17:31] of evil
[17:33] it finds its its root or its basis in
[17:36] humanity through Satan's lie and what
[17:40] was it you shall not surely die
[17:43] &gt;&gt; the question was a setup to introduce
[17:45] the subject but ultimately he wants to
[17:47] express that you're un that you cannot
[17:50] die in direct direct contradiction to
[17:54] the prophecy that said the day you eat
[17:56] thereof the day you die. This is so
[17:59] uh clear. If you eat of that tree,
[18:02] you'll die. And Satan changes it. If you
[18:05] eat of that tree, you won't die. It's a
[18:08] lie. An outright lie. So in Genesis
[18:11] chapter 3 is spec specifically verse 6.
[18:14] It says when the woman saw the tree was
[18:16] something to be desired to make one
[18:19] wise.
[18:20] Now notice the contrast now and I I'm
[18:23] careful saying contrast. It is
[18:24] contrasting. But I don't I'm not even
[18:26] want you just to see it as an opposite
[18:28] because there is a way that we can act
[18:30] in a way to compensate for evil. And
[18:33] that good we try to do is just as evil
[18:35] as the evil.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; It's all in the same arena. But here we
[18:39] see something that was eternal and
[18:43] unblenmished.
[18:45] And when she sees this other tree
[18:49] to being able to produce something to
[18:52] make her wise,
[18:54] she takes of that tree having already
[18:57] been told that to eat it, you'll die.
[19:01] And in doing so, the woman rejects the
[19:03] tree of love and life.
[19:06] And she chooses that tree of desire and
[19:09] death because she saw it as a tree to be
[19:12] desired. But there was this other tree
[19:13] of life which was at the heart of God
[19:16] which is this aim of creation.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; And she chooses this tree of death.
[19:22] All that was good God brought by the
[19:24] tree of life.
[19:26] Then Satan perverts all that was good
[19:28] through this tree of knowledge. Satan's
[19:31] unable to create. The tree of life can
[19:33] only is the only thing that create. The
[19:35] tree of knowledge of good and evil is
[19:37] that fruit which takes that which is
[19:39] good and in changing it produces
[19:41] something that is not good.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; So when the woman chose the fruit of the
[19:47] tree of knowledge, she's actually
[19:49] choosing death.
[19:51] You say, well, she didn't think she was
[19:52] choosing death. She should have known
[19:54] she was choosing death because she had
[19:56] been told that she was choosing death.
[19:59] when she chose the tree of knowledge,
[20:01] not only did she choose death, but she
[20:02] rejected the tree of life, which was the
[20:04] wisdom and power of God. What a lie. The
[20:07] day you eat thereof, you're going to
[20:09] become as gods, knowing good from evil.
[20:11] Okay, that's true. But you won't die.
[20:14] So, what did she do? She rejected the
[20:16] tree of life, the wisdom and power of
[20:18] God.
[20:20] The Bible says in Romans chapter 6 verse
[20:22] 23,
[20:24] I'll try to hasten our pace maybe a
[20:25] little bit today just because I was
[20:27] informed that our AC unit uh just like
[20:30] clockwork froze up in the month of
[20:32] August. In Romans chapter 6 23 it says,
[20:35] "For the wages of sin is death, but the
[20:38] gift of God is eternal life through
[20:40] Jesus Christ our Lord." We use this
[20:41] scripture quite frequently and there's
[20:43] your eternal life through Jesus Christ,
[20:45] the tree of life, the wisdom and power
[20:47] of God. And then you have the wages or
[20:50] that which is paid or given of sin is
[20:53] death.
[20:54] We know the curse upon mankind that's
[20:56] given upon mankind is death. Sin itself
[21:00] is death. It's that perverted life that
[21:03] we're all born into. That's what
[21:04] marching to the grave. Brother Elliot
[21:06] and I were fellowshipping on. It's the
[21:08] one thing that's certain. I said and
[21:09] taxes. And he's like death is certain.
[21:12] In other words, we can avoid our taxes
[21:15] but death is unavoidable.
[21:18] Even in Greek mythology, there's
[21:21] which is which is represents death that
[21:23] it's a very interesting creature which
[21:24] seems to imply some balance. But it's
[21:27] it's something that's inedible.
[21:28] Inevitable.
[21:30] Whatever it is, inedible. We don't
[21:33] believe in edibles here.
[21:35] It's inevitable.
[21:37] It's going to come. It's going to
[21:38] happen.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; This life is a life that is bound by the
[21:44] grave.
[21:46] So when the woman partook of the tree of
[21:49] knowledge, God had said the fruit of
[21:51] that tree is death. And we know that
[21:55] death passed upon all mankind by that
[21:57] sin. That all are conceived in sin. And
[22:00] a man born of a woman is of a few days,
[22:02] meaning he's going to die. It's not a
[22:04] limitless time, though it may seem to be
[22:05] indefinite, but man is going to pass to
[22:08] the grave.
[22:10] And then we see in Genesis 4:8
[22:14] that this is a direct fruit of the tree
[22:17] of knowledge because it says that Cain
[22:20] talked with Abel his brother and it came
[22:23] to pass when they were in the field that
[22:24] Cain rose up against Abel his brother
[22:27] and slew him. This is quite shocking.
[22:31] When you see the first death in the
[22:33] Garden of Eden, we see that God gives
[22:34] this command that the man and the woman
[22:36] ought to cover themselves with clothes
[22:39] uh that would cover their body, not just
[22:41] things that would cover their loins and
[22:43] their private parts or those parts that
[22:45] excited shame, but they were to dress
[22:47] themselves in this bloody skins of a
[22:50] lamb. And there was death, and we could
[22:52] say a justifiable death in the garden.
[22:56] But now here we see that there is this
[22:58] act of murder.
[23:01] Murder is evil.
[23:06] What's striking about this act in
[23:07] Genesis chapter 4
[23:11] is this murder is it's the opposite of
[23:13] creation.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Creation brings life. It's something
[23:18] pure. It's something that in the
[23:19] beginning would have had no end under
[23:21] the according to the way that God would
[23:23] sustain it. But now to take life, it's
[23:27] the opposite of creation.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; To destroy something that is good is
[23:32] evil.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; To deprive somebody else of that which
[23:35] is good is evil.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; We really are wanting to understand
[23:43] evil at its depths.
[23:46] And so this agony of death which we see
[23:50] in the fruit of Cain murdering his
[23:52] brother Abel, it's unavoidable for the
[23:55] living.
[23:57] And I'm looking at from the natural
[23:58] standpoint even according to the
[24:00] scripture now because we know that
[24:02] there's going to be a time in a moment
[24:04] which is the ultimate fruit of the tree
[24:07] of life and that's to conquer death the
[24:09] last enemy. So I'm not I'm not preaching
[24:11] this like man I guess brother Aaron just
[24:12] forgot all about the body change of our
[24:14] those that are alive and remain. No, I
[24:16] haven't forgot about that. That's that's
[24:18] ever before us.
[24:21] This there is there are those that sleep
[24:24] and are those that the stain of humanity
[24:26] is that there is death ultimately
[24:30] and when one dies
[24:32] there those that remain there's no
[24:35] entering into fellowship with the one
[24:36] who's gone on.
[24:39] So let's beyond that veil and beyond
[24:40] that curtain we don't have personal
[24:42] knowledge of. So there's an emptiness
[24:44] and suffering for those who are left on
[24:46] this side of the curtain of time.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said death is hard any
[24:51] time. So it's painful. It's distressful.
[24:55] This is true of death.
[24:58] In Luke 22 42 to 44 Jesus is praying let
[25:03] this cup pass from me. This cup of what?
[25:06] Death.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; This cup of suffering. And the Bible
[25:09] says that that this angel came and
[25:11] ministered unto him and it strengthened
[25:12] him. But in the very next verse in verse
[25:14] 44, in being in agony, he prayed more
[25:17] earnestly. I believe this is the only
[25:19] place in scripture where the word agony
[25:21] is used.
[25:23] Jesus was agonizing over his death.
[25:29] True it was. It was that he agonized
[25:31] over the manner of death. He knew that
[25:34] it wouldn't be quick. He knew that he
[25:37] would have to suffer. Yet the son of God
[25:39] who knew no sin, who wouldn't have been
[25:42] guilty of sin, but yet having been
[25:44] pressed upon by every element which
[25:46] could cause sin, he still agonized over
[25:50] death.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Matthew 26, it said he was exceeding
[25:53] sorrowful even unto death and prayed,
[25:56] "Let this cup pass from me."
[26:00] Jesus is fighting against death.
[26:03] This is the one that would die. He's
[26:05] fighting against death. Brother Bam said
[26:07] the darkest part of the human spirit of
[26:09] human life is death
[26:12] and every man fears it.
[26:16] And there's this the death then that
[26:19] comes to us all. And then there's those
[26:21] of us who our time has not yet come and
[26:24] we have to face the loss of a loved one.
[26:28] Solomon wrote in Ecclesiastes chapter 9,
[26:30] "For all this I considered in my heart,
[26:33] even to declare all this, that the
[26:35] righteous and the wise, and their works
[26:36] are in the hand of God. No man knoweth
[26:39] either love or hatred by all that is
[26:41] before them. All things come alike to
[26:44] all. There is one event to the righteous
[26:46] and to the wicked, to the good and to
[26:47] the clean, to the unclean, and to him
[26:49] that sacrifice. To him that sacrificeth
[26:51] not. As is the good, so is the sinner.
[26:53] And he that swearth, as he that fearth
[26:55] an oath." What is this? What is this
[26:58] that comes to all? This is an evil among
[27:00] all things that are done under the sun,
[27:02] that there is one event unto all. Yay,
[27:05] also the heart of the sons of men is
[27:07] full of evil, and madness is in their
[27:08] heart while they live, and after that
[27:10] they go to the dead.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; What's the one of it for everyone? He's
[27:15] saying death.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; The good, the bad, the clean, the
[27:18] unclean, the him that sacrifices, the
[27:20] one that refuses to sacrifice, the
[27:21] sinner, the one that swears, the one
[27:22] that fearth an oath. All these it
[27:25] happens to all of them. For to him that
[27:27] is joined to all the living there is
[27:28] hope. For him who continues to exist
[27:32] there's hope to the one that lives.
[27:35] For a living dog is better than a dead
[27:37] lion.
[27:39] That's quite a a statement.
[27:42] A living dog is better than a dead lion.
[27:46] How could we say that it's better to die
[27:49] than to live? To say that death is
[27:52] better than life. He says, "At least a
[27:53] living dog has hope.
[27:56] It's better than a dead lion. For the
[27:57] living know that they shall die,
[28:01] but the dead know not anything. Neither
[28:04] have they anymore a reward. For the
[28:05] memory of them is forgotten.
[28:08] Also, their love and their hatred and
[28:09] their envy is now perished.
[28:12] Neither have they anymore a portion
[28:14] forever in anything that is done under
[28:16] the sun."
[28:17] Are you picking up what Solomon's laying
[28:19] down? that when a man dies
[28:23] he he vacates this life
[28:27] &gt;&gt; his life no longer remains in this
[28:30] stream of life in this channel of living
[28:32] this is what death represents
[28:34] &gt;&gt; this is the death he's contemplating is
[28:36] the death of the body the death of that
[28:39] body brother said this first death is
[28:41] separating from our loved ones so
[28:43] whenever there's death to that body that
[28:46] that that has those senses which
[28:48] occupied the stream of life in interact
[28:50] acted us within this stream of time.
[28:52] When that body dies, there's no good or
[28:55] bad that he accumulates. There's no
[28:58] portion whatsoever. There's no
[28:59] interaction. Everything that was in him
[29:01] of the spirit and of the flesh, the
[29:03] senses is gone and now perish from the
[29:05] earth. And there is yet this element
[29:08] that they could be forgotten. Sure.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; I have not I find it um that for myself
[29:14] in speaking on the subject of death,
[29:17] I am one who has not had to experience
[29:20] death much closer. I I I've experienced
[29:23] some very uh great tragedies with my
[29:26] cousins passing away. I've had uh aunts
[29:29] and uncles pass away. My grandparents
[29:31] have all passed away. And but that those
[29:33] in those things I haven't experienced
[29:35] death closer than that. So I I don't
[29:37] want to pretend as one who can stand up
[29:39] and say I know I faced it. I stared it
[29:41] down.
[29:43] But there's this
[29:46] when I've just hearing from people and
[29:48] they're sharing that one of the greatest
[29:50] fears is not being able to remember the
[29:53] sound or the face
[29:56] of one who passes away
[29:59] because there's nothing tangible
[30:00] anymore.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I have their shirt." Oh,
[30:04] that's just that's just a shirt.
[30:07] I have their picture. That's just a
[30:10] picture
[30:12] that that that's that's something that
[30:14] the way that the only way that you can
[30:16] interact and this is maybe another I'm
[30:18] just going to point to it real quick.
[30:19] There's this evilness of imagination
[30:21] that Satan's perpetuated upon all
[30:23] mankind where when someone passes, you
[30:25] only know them again through your
[30:26] imagination
[30:27] &gt;&gt; or memory.
[30:30] But the death he's contemplating here is
[30:31] that of the body. In Matthew 10:28,
[30:33] "Fear not them which kill the body."
[30:36] There is a death that comes to the body
[30:37] but are not able to kill the soul but
[30:39] rather fear him which is able to destroy
[30:41] both soul and body in hell.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; When a believer dies, he goes into the
[30:45] presence of God.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; And so if there's a second death, that
[30:49] is a death of the soul.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; But this death that we all we witness
[30:54] from this side of life
[30:56] is the death to the body.
[31:00] When we lose someone we love, we suffer
[31:03] because the one we love has become
[31:05] absent.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; I I I I'm taking this from the
[31:09] scripture. I'm trying to glean and learn
[31:12] wisdom
[31:14] as I have not suffered loss closer than
[31:17] that of a grandparent or cousin or aunts
[31:19] and uncles. But there is a there's a
[31:22] loss that is causes us to suffer because
[31:26] that one we loved is now absent.
[31:30] That's right.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; As I mentioned a moment ago too, it's in
[31:32] their absence their existence becomes
[31:34] unreal.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; It's not literal to us. So there's this
[31:39] emptiness. So their existence is
[31:41] imaginary. But the love you had for them
[31:42] was very real.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; And so it creates this emptiness in
[31:46] terms of this this absence of what your
[31:48] love was one time uh projected to. So
[31:52] the suffering caused by the death of
[31:54] others is due to that pain of absence,
[31:56] that reality that they're not there. And
[31:59] isn't that remarkable? This is a
[32:00] paradox. It's their absence that becomes
[32:03] their presence.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; I know that's a paradox, but it's the
[32:07] fact that they're missing. It's their
[32:09] absence is what's real to you. And
[32:11] therefore, it's what reminds you of the
[32:13] love that you had for that person
[32:17] &gt;&gt; because they can no longer exist.
[32:18] Solomon said they no longer exist in
[32:20] this world. There's no interplay.
[32:22] There's no communication. There's no
[32:23] accumulation. There's nothing real
[32:25] anymore in this life. It's emptiness in
[32:28] that void or that absence testifies of
[32:30] the one that you loved.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; And therefore, death is hard anytime.
[32:38] But we see if you turn to Proverbs
[32:40] chapter 8,
[32:42] we know that God has these laws of life.
[32:44] There's two laws. Law of life and the
[32:46] law of death. These are laws that exist.
[32:49] Now,
[32:51] so death on the horizon, death and its
[32:53] nastiness and its evilness, what's
[32:56] Solomon has even said we should see that
[32:58] all are in the hand of God.
[33:02] So in Proverbsap 8:es 32 to 35, excuse
[33:06] me, 35, now therefore hearken unto me,
[33:08] oh ye children, for blessed are they
[33:10] that keep my ways.
[33:13] Hear instruction and be wise and refuse
[33:15] it not. Such great uh admonition there.
[33:19] Hear instruction and be wise. Don't
[33:21] reject instruction. Instruction was
[33:23] given to the man and woman in the
[33:24] beginning. What did they do? They
[33:25] refused it. Blessed is the man that
[33:27] heareth me, watching daily at my gates,
[33:29] waiting at the post of my doors. That's
[33:31] something to write down. Blessed comes
[33:34] to those who hear,
[33:37] wait,
[33:39] watch and wait,
[33:42] looking for him
[33:45] or her as the scripture may refer to it
[33:47] as she refers to herself in the
[33:48] feminine. In Proverbsapter 8:1, it says,
[33:50] "Des not wisdom cry and understanding
[33:52] put forth her voice?" So what is it
[33:54] that's speaking here in Proverbs 8?
[33:56] Wisdom.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Hearken unto wisdom. Blessed are they
[34:00] that keep wise ways. hear instruction,
[34:02] be wise, and refuse it not. Blessed is
[34:03] the man that he hearth wisdom, watching
[34:04] daily at wisdom's gates, waiting at the
[34:06] post of wisdom's door. For who so
[34:08] findeth wisdom findeth life, and shall
[34:10] obtain favor of the Lord.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; This is the sum of all things. This is
[34:16] the totality of everything that there is
[34:18] a good that's transcendent beyond all of
[34:20] us. And that's a good that we want to
[34:22] pursue. That's the good that we want to
[34:24] be subject to. Not contrived,
[34:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Not in the way that we try to attain it
[34:29] within ourselves or try to fill the void
[34:30] in ourselves with what we think is good,
[34:32] but there's some yielding to it that it
[34:34] might operate.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 8 12 to13, I wisdom dwell with
[34:40] prudence and find out knowledge of witty
[34:42] inventions.
[34:43] The fear of the Lord is, we know it's
[34:46] the beginning of wisdom, but the fear of
[34:48] the Lord is to hate evil.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Pride and arrogancy, and the devil and
[34:53] the evil way, and the forward mouth do I
[34:56] hate.
[34:58] The fear of the Lord, which is the
[34:59] beginning of wisdom, results in hating
[35:02] evil. It also hates pride and arrogancy
[35:04] and the evil way and the forward mouth.
[35:06] These are things that God hates.
[35:09] So the consequence of loving good, the
[35:11] antithesis to the tree of life, but this
[35:13] consequence of loving truth is to hate
[35:16] evil in all of its forms.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; And that would include death.
[35:22] I say this recognizing there's a paradox
[35:25] to death. I'm trying to hurry here
[35:28] so we could relieve you of your
[35:29] suffering. Maybe I should have pre
[35:30] preached on suffering. Should have
[35:32] preached on hell.
[35:38] Proverbsapter 8:36 as we continue now as
[35:41] he's saying don't refuse it. Don't
[35:42] refuse it. Listen. He that has me, what
[35:44] does he say? Has finds life. There's
[35:47] life in wisdom.
[35:50] In verse 36, but he that sinnth against
[35:53] wisdom wrongeth his own soul.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Because the soul that sinnth it shall
[35:58] die.
[36:00] that soul which will partake in the
[36:04] second death, not just the body. The one
[36:08] whose body precedes
[36:10] uh its soul in death, that person's
[36:13] miserable
[36:15] because the soul that sinnth it will
[36:17] die. And to the Jew and even
[36:18] scripturally, a man living in pleasure
[36:21] and those that lived in sin were dead
[36:23] already
[36:24] &gt;&gt; because that's the ever abiding
[36:26] condition of the sentence upon the soul.
[36:27] And so if your body precedes your soul
[36:30] in death. In other words, if you have
[36:31] not died to death in your soul, it's
[36:34] invisible the one whose body dies before
[36:37] its soul.
[36:39] And he that sins against wisdom wrongs
[36:41] his own soul. And they that hate wisdom
[36:45] love death.
[36:49] Think deeply about this. They that hate
[36:53] me love death.
[36:59] To love life then is to hate death.
[37:04] Death isn't evil. Life is good.
[37:09] All those that hate wisdom
[37:12] love death.
[37:16] To desire what brings death upon your
[37:18] body or your soul
[37:21] is to love death itself.
[37:25] That's why we cannot love the things of
[37:27] this world and have the love of God in
[37:28] us.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Because God who is life, God who is
[37:32] good, to love those things that can
[37:34] destroy both body and soul is to love
[37:39] death itself.
[37:42] In Ecclesiastes 7 11 and 12, it says,
[37:44] "Wisdom is good with an inheritance and
[37:47] by it there's profit to them that see
[37:48] the sun." These are the observations of
[37:50] Solomon. For wisdom is a defense and
[37:52] money is a defense. And we all say,
[37:54] "Amen. I want more defense."
[37:57] But the excellency of knowledge is that
[37:59] wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Say
[38:07] defense buys championships.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Wisdom is a defense. Money is a defense.
[38:12] But the excellency of the knowledge is
[38:13] this. What? What? How is it so? How
[38:15] would money even be a defense? Because
[38:17] wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
[38:21] The fool and his riches is are and his
[38:23] money are quickly parted.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; There there's no defense in money in
[38:27] with a lack of wisdom. Wisdom is good
[38:30] with an inheritance because by wisdom
[38:33] there is a benefit under the sun. We
[38:35] could just speak that in natural things.
[38:37] But the excellency of knowledge is that
[38:38] wisdom gives life.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Wisdom is lifegiving. If you have
[38:43] wisdom, it is lifegiving. In Proverbs
[38:46] 3:es 13 and 19, happy is the man that
[38:48] findeth wisdom and the man that getth
[38:51] understanding. For the merchandise is
[38:53] better than the merchandise of silver
[38:55] and the gain thereof than fine gold.
[38:58] One of the greatest wrestlings amongst
[38:59] behavioral economists and psychologists
[39:01] and sociologists is can money actually
[39:03] buy you happiness?
[39:06] And there's many that conclude, well, it
[39:07] could at least make your mis misery a
[39:09] little bit more comfortable.
[39:11] and and it it's a raging debate in in in
[39:14] the philosophical realm, but a man that
[39:17] finds wisdom is indeed happy, and
[39:19] there's no amount of wealth that can buy
[39:20] that for him. Wisdom is more precious
[39:22] than rubies, and all things that thou
[39:24] can't desire are not to be compared unto
[39:27] her. Length of days is in her right
[39:30] hand, and in her left hand riches and
[39:32] honor. Her ways are ways of
[39:34] pleasantness, and all her paths are
[39:37] peace. This is good.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; This is the goodness. This is the
[39:40] conseness. She is a tree of life to them
[39:44] that lay hold upon her.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Christ is the wisdom of God. Christ is
[39:49] the tree of life. Surely wisdom is a
[39:52] tree of life to them that lay hold upon
[39:54] him.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; And happy is everyone that retainth her.
[39:58] And then this circles right back into
[40:00] it. The Lord by his wisdom hath founded
[40:02] the earth. By understanding he hath he
[40:05] established the heavens.
[40:08] These are the all sustaining
[40:10] lifegiving
[40:12] tree of life wisdom.
[40:16] The tree of wisdom is that tree of life.
[40:18] The tree of knowledge is that tree of
[40:21] death.
[40:24] In Genesis chapter 3 22, "And the Lord
[40:26] God said, this is after the fall, behold
[40:27] the man has become as one of us to know
[40:30] good and evil, just exactly as the devil
[40:32] had said. They did become as gods,
[40:35] knowing good and evil." And God said,
[40:36] "Behold, they have become as one of us
[40:38] knowing good and evil." But the part
[40:40] where the lie was is not that they
[40:42] wouldn't know good and evil, but the lie
[40:44] was that they would not die as a fruit
[40:46] of that.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now lest he put forth his
[40:49] hand and take also of the tree of life
[40:51] and eat and live forever."
[40:56] He then banishes them from the tree of
[40:58] life. Come back to this very meaning
[41:00] here. But catch that that this evil is
[41:03] that which separates you from the tree
[41:05] of life.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Evil is that which separates you from
[41:07] goodness. God who is eternal life. That
[41:11] which separates you from good or
[41:13] creation. What is death? Separation from
[41:16] God.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; So there was a separation from creation.
[41:23] Evil is then this absence of the tree of
[41:26] life.
[41:27] But remember how that one's absence is
[41:29] the very thing that declares their
[41:31] presence. It's this is the paradox. Evil
[41:34] in this world is what makes God known
[41:38] &gt;&gt; through the law of contrast.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Evil being the absence of the tree of
[41:42] life. Man being barred from that tree of
[41:44] life. Then we have this original reality
[41:46] which man has lost and become
[41:47] unconscious to. But it's the sinful
[41:49] condition and the sentence of death that
[41:51] testifies to a life that never ends.
[41:54] Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; And so what he says, take the tree of
[41:59] life and guard it and protect it because
[42:01] if they eat,
[42:03] they'll live forever.
[42:05] It was intended that this tree of life
[42:07] would not only bring forth life, but it
[42:09] would sustain. It would establish. By
[42:12] eating the fruit of that tree, all
[42:14] impairment, whatever it might be, would
[42:16] be repaired so as to prevent death
[42:18] forever.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; I gathered that from Revelations 22:es 2
[42:22] and 3. And in the midst of the street of
[42:23] it, this new Jerusalem, this eternal
[42:25] eighth day city. And on either side of
[42:26] the river was there the tree of life,
[42:28] which beare 12 manner of fruits, and
[42:30] yielded her fruit every month. And the
[42:31] leaves of the tree were for the healing
[42:33] of the nations,
[42:35] &gt;&gt; the sustaining of life.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; And there shall be no more curse. Why?
[42:41] Because the tree of life
[42:44] is blooming.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; It's present. It's living. Without the
[42:47] presence of the tree of knowledge,
[42:50] &gt;&gt; there is no tree of death. Therefore,
[42:53] there is no more curse.
[42:56] This tree of life was meant to give life
[42:58] and sustained life. In partaking of the
[43:00] tree of life, they would have lived
[43:02] forever. So, God bars man off from that.
[43:05] Therefore, she's continually taking from
[43:07] the tree of death.
[43:10] In Mark 3:es 1-6, I hope you could just
[43:13] kind of follow this with me more in in
[43:15] in uh and uh pushing forward momentum
[43:18] form. Christ who is that tree of life
[43:20] now. He entered again into the synagogue
[43:23] and there was a man there which had a
[43:24] withered hand. And they watched him
[43:26] whether he would heal him on the Sabbath
[43:29] that they might accuse him.
[43:31] What outright evilness?
[43:34] A man has a withered hand
[43:38] and they are watching to see whether
[43:40] they'll heal him. To me, that should
[43:42] have been awareness enough.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Should have been self-aware enough to
[43:45] say that, oh, here comes Jesus on the
[43:47] Sabbath day. Here's a man that's sick.
[43:49] I'm going to see if he dare straighten
[43:51] out that hand on the Sabbath day. You'd
[43:54] hope that you have enough self-awareness
[43:55] to say, wait, what?
[43:57] &gt;&gt; What am I thinking?
[43:59] This man has power to heal.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; This man is demonstrating those
[44:05] attributes and characteristics that we
[44:06] hold dear to the Messiah, to the tree of
[44:08] life, that which it would have healed
[44:09] the curse.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; The one that will break the curse. And
[44:14] we're more concerned about the timing of
[44:15] it.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; This is evil.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; It would be evil to deprive Christ of
[44:22] that power.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; It would be evil to contemplate
[44:26] withholding it from that man. And they
[44:27] watched him whether he would heal on the
[44:28] Sabbath day that they might accuse him.
[44:30] And he said unto the man which had the
[44:31] withered hand stand forth. So now he's
[44:33] singling them out. And he said unto
[44:35] them, notice how quickly he zeros in at
[44:37] the heart of the issue. Is it lawful to
[44:39] do good on the Sabbath day or to do
[44:42] evil?
[44:44] &gt;&gt; It's a question of good and evil.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; What What is it lawful to do on the
[44:50] Sabbath day? To save life or to kill?
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Think of how rich this principle is.
[44:56] just how how much more we could expand
[44:58] it to the subject we're ministering on
[44:59] this morning. Jesus is standing say on
[45:02] this seventh day of rest, what would be
[45:04] evil?
[45:07] &gt;&gt; To save life or to kill it?
[45:11] What what does the law prohibit? Evil or
[45:14] good?
[45:15] &gt;&gt; This is challenging.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; What was it that God was prohibiting on
[45:19] that seventh day when he took his rest
[45:20] and said, "Don't eat of this tree
[45:22] because it'll bring death." It wasn't a
[45:25] prohibition on good.
[45:29] And he says, "But they held their
[45:30] peace."
[45:32] And then I I I love this not because I
[45:34] want to justify my own reactions at
[45:36] times, but he says when he looked round
[45:37] about he l When he had looked around
[45:40] about on them with anger
[45:44] to be like Jesus
[45:47] to be Yes, Lord. Like Jesus
[45:52] on earth. long
[45:56] being grieved for the hardness of their
[45:57] hearts, he said unto them, Stretch forth
[46:00] thine hand.
[46:02] And he stretched it out, and his hand
[46:04] was restored whole as the other. And the
[46:06] Pharisees went forth, and straightway
[46:08] took counsel with the Herodians against
[46:10] him, how they might destroy him.
[46:15] On the same day that the tree of life
[46:16] was healing a withered hand, they
[46:18] conspired to take the tree of life
[46:22] &gt;&gt; to destroy. Herein is evil personified.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; They hated life and loved death because
[46:29] he presented the choice to them. What is
[46:31] what is prohibited under the law on the
[46:33] Sabbath day? To do evil. And to them
[46:36] they said they would say yes the law
[46:38] prohibits to do evil. But yet what do
[46:40] they do when they leave?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; They indict an evil matter. They
[46:44] conspired to kill him. Jesus says, "Is
[46:46] it is it lawful to save life or to kill
[46:49] on this day and and unmindful?" This is
[46:52] that paradox of evil. It is apparent to
[46:54] us when we suffer it, but to the one
[46:56] who's committing it. To him, I have not
[46:58] sinned.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; I have not done wrong.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; And here they conspire to kill the son
[47:05] of God.
[47:07] They hated life. Capital Li Fe. They
[47:10] hated life and loved death.
[47:13] Because when these Pharisees did good,
[47:15] they were doing it on the same level of
[47:17] evil.
[47:19] They to a Pharisee, they were virtuous
[47:22] out of obedience to the state,
[47:26] &gt;&gt; obedience to the nation, obedience to
[47:28] the law. That was that was from which
[47:30] their their goodness flowed.
[47:33] Therefore, if there in their absinence
[47:36] and their works did it through the
[47:37] obedience to the state, who are you to
[47:39] argue when one adheres to tenants of
[47:42] communism or socialism or other things
[47:44] to perform that which is evil? How are
[47:46] you more just than they?
[47:50] &gt;&gt; They performed good as the opposite of
[47:52] evil,
[47:54] but rejected the good that was absolute.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; You recognize what's happening?
[48:01] They they always they did what was
[48:04] righteous as their compensation for the
[48:07] evil that was in the world. But they
[48:09] rejected that good which was an
[48:12] absolute.
[48:14] I think maybe some of you are familiar
[48:16] with it. Some of the early church
[48:18] writers wrote about this and made this
[48:21] comparison. They actually called Plato's
[48:22] Republic and that conversation with
[48:24] Socrates that there was prophecy of
[48:26] Jesus Christ because in I think it's
[48:28] book two it speaks of a just man. If a
[48:30] just man entered into this world and
[48:32] when he say a just man it means one who
[48:34] wants to be good not just seem good
[48:38] &gt;&gt; that that one who is good which was
[48:40] Christ
[48:42] &gt;&gt; when he if he was to enter into the
[48:44] world the conclusion was if this just
[48:46] man who was good and didn't just seem
[48:49] good would appear evil to those unjust
[48:52] men
[48:53] &gt;&gt; and then the conversation the conclusion
[48:55] is the unjust would crucify
[48:58] &gt;&gt; the just man That's right.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what happened when
[49:02] Christ who is the way, the truth, the
[49:05] life, the one who was just, the one who
[49:07] did not just want to appear good. How
[49:10] was it not just appearance sake? He was
[49:12] eating with the heathen. He was doing
[49:13] things that was completely ringing up
[49:15] the aristocracy and the totalitarian
[49:17] religious system. They hated what he was
[49:19] doing, but he desired to be good than
[49:23] just seem good.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; And what did they do? They killed him.
[49:27] They crucified him.
[49:30] because that which was good was hated by
[49:32] evil.
[49:35] This further paradox as it relates to
[49:36] this good and evil and death. Jesus said
[49:38] in John 15:13, "Greater love hath no man
[49:40] than this, that he laid down his life
[49:41] for his friends."
[49:44] What a paradox.
[49:46] Jesus in dying
[49:49] willingly offered up his life.
[49:52] But it wasn't just this offering of his
[49:55] life. It was also punishment.
[49:57] He had to despite himself.
[50:01] He had to disregard himself and his own
[50:03] interest. The Bible speaks to that this
[50:05] duality of the sacrifice. It's a free
[50:08] will offering. But then he had to also
[50:10] deny himself in doing so.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; And listen, it's pretty much true about
[50:14] human nature. If all that we were asked
[50:16] is to give things up freely, that would
[50:18] be easy to do. But when we're asked to
[50:20] deny ourselves, whoa, wait a minute.
[50:22] Yes.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; It's not just taking up the cross and a
[50:24] free will offering, but to deny yourself
[50:26] and come follow him. It's that part of
[50:28] losing self. It's that part of dying to
[50:30] self. It's that that's the part that's
[50:32] the void that we so anxiously resist.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; But Jesus willingly laid down his life.
[50:40] His death was one of the most precious
[50:42] things given to man.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; We can say Christ is the greatest gift
[50:46] to man. But what made that gift a
[50:48] masterpiece? What made it beneficial to
[50:49] us? We can say the greatest gift ever,
[50:51] the most perfect holy thing that ever
[50:52] walked the face of the earth is Jesus
[50:54] Christ. And we merely would have been
[50:55] observers of a drama. But when he died,
[50:58] that death became most precious to us.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; To think the most precious thing that
[51:03] ever happened to the greatest gift ever
[51:04] upon the face of earth was the death of
[51:06] that Messiah.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; But in Acts 2:24, it says, "Whom God
[51:11] hath raised up, he did not leave him in
[51:13] that grave, having loosed the pains of
[51:15] death."
[51:16] &gt;&gt; That agony of death has now been loosed.
[51:20] because it was not possible that he
[51:21] should beholden of it.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Do you realize death was necessary
[51:28] &gt;&gt; in order for us to attain life?
[51:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I have the quote here.
[51:33] Yes, it's there in water separation.
[51:35] Death is the only thing that'll bring
[51:37] redemption.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; All right. This is this is a paradox.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; This is the paradox. Life, life, life,
[51:44] life, life, life life, life life. Life
[51:45] life is good, but death is the only
[51:48] thing that restores that good life.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; The tree of knowledge brought death.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; And now death is the only thing that can
[51:59] bring life back.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 2 14 and 15. For as much
[52:08] then as the children are partakers of
[52:09] flesh and blood, he also him like
[52:11] himself likewise took part of the same,
[52:13] that through death he might destroy him
[52:15] that had the power of death, that is the
[52:17] devil.
[52:19] The devil's the one that had the power
[52:20] of death. And deliver them who through
[52:23] fear of death were all their lifetime
[52:25] subject to bondage. This is the reality.
[52:29] They that fear death, which we all do as
[52:32] humans, there's some fear of death.
[52:35] Not to not to trigger anybody, but that
[52:37] to me was the biggest curse of CO 19
[52:39] besides the 19 pounds we all put on,
[52:42] &gt;&gt; but it was just the fear,
[52:44] &gt;&gt; the consequence of it.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Like, well, I've we've all had a sore
[52:47] throat before. We've all been sick.
[52:49] We've had fevers, you know, we we're
[52:50] still here. But then all of a sudden, it
[52:51] was like, well, but you could just
[52:52] immediately drop dead and die.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; And so, it's the fear of death. It was
[52:57] you're facing now your own mortality.
[52:59] Right? It
[53:00] &gt;&gt; it's it's more present, more of a
[53:02] reality than it for many of us than it
[53:04] has ever been before.
[53:06] So there is through the fear of death
[53:08] bondage.
[53:10] But having loosed the pains or the agony
[53:12] of death, death is destroyed by Christ.
[53:16] Through death, he might destroy him that
[53:18] had the power of death. And in
[53:19] destroying the devil, death itself is
[53:21] destroyed by death.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] By his death,
[53:36] he destroys death. Revelations 21:4,
[53:40] "God shall wipe away all their tears
[53:42] from their eyes, and there shall be no
[53:45] more death."
[53:48] There's death here. We've eaten from the
[53:51] tree of knowledge. Our lives are be born
[53:54] between Eve and Satan. We have death
[53:57] that works within our members. We have a
[53:59] sentence of death upon our soul. Death
[54:00] is ever present all around us. But there
[54:03] will be no more death.
[54:06] In Revelation 6, that pale horse rider
[54:09] is called death and hell follows him.
[54:14] But Revelations 20:14 says, "And death
[54:16] and hell were cast into the lake of
[54:18] fire. This is the second death.
[54:25] As I close this service,
[54:28] I think about that Psalm 23 verse4. Yay,
[54:32] though I walk through the valley of the
[54:33] shadow of death.
[54:37] Brother Brandham when he looks at that
[54:38] shadow, he said there has to be a
[54:39] certain amount of light in death to make
[54:41] it a shadow.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; This is the paradox of it.
[54:47] In the meantime, then if death has a
[54:50] certain amount of light in it, we should
[54:52] love life and hate death,
[54:55] we shouldn't hasten ourselves to death.
[54:58] We shouldn't just embrace that absence
[55:00] and and and pour ourselves into it.
[55:02] Jesus even himself resisted it a and
[55:04] didn't want to die. But we ought to
[55:06] pursue truth and mercy, reject evil,
[55:09] continue to hate death. In Psalms
[55:12] 116:15, precious in the sight of the
[55:14] Lord is the death of his saints.
[55:17] That takes it from the vantage point of
[55:19] God.
[55:21] We do not stand in thestead of God in
[55:22] this sense. We who exist here can only
[55:25] see the finality, the absence and the
[55:27] emptiness to God. He has watched out
[55:29] over life from the beginning. When it
[55:31] said precious in the eyes sight of the
[55:33] Lord is the death of his saints, God
[55:34] masters death.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; We know that he puts bits in trouble's
[55:38] mouths. But now death becomes this buggy
[55:40] or this this vehicle
[55:43] &gt;&gt; that ushers his saints into his
[55:45] presence.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; And therefore God watches out over it so
[55:50] that it is precious.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; He can prevent it and having been able
[55:55] to prevent it, he can allow it at such
[55:57] time that he desires
[55:59] &gt;&gt; in that manner that fits his purpose.
[56:02] We are taught that death cannot take you
[56:04] until the purpose of God is finished in
[56:06] your life.
[56:08] This stands for the proposition
[56:10] that as a son or daughter of God, you
[56:12] cannot die prematurely.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know that that it helps us
[56:17] deal with death at all from our vantage
[56:19] point. If you find ourselves in a a
[56:22] perilous situation and we're desparing
[56:24] of death, we might not be able to say,
[56:25] "Well, I guess it's just my time."
[56:27] There's still going to be a human
[56:28] reaction to it. And that even for those
[56:31] who've tasted it and we don't know what
[56:33] exists for them beyond and we have this
[56:35] hope and this faith and and they enter
[56:36] into the presence of God. Uh we believe
[56:38] that there is still yet for us some sort
[56:40] of emptiness and maybe it seems hollow
[56:42] sometimes and say well they were
[56:44] immortal till that time. I could think
[56:45] of when they die they could have died
[56:47] here when this happened or that
[56:48] happened. But yet it is true there is a
[56:51] sense of immortality on the elect of God
[56:54] until God desires to take them home.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] Therefore, the Bible says in 1
[56:59] Thessalonians 4:13 that we sorrow not
[57:01] even as others which have no hope.
[57:03] Brothers, if you could come to your
[57:04] instruments,
[57:06] our hope is in the knowledge that evil,
[57:08] this evil which we endure, this death
[57:11] that we hate, it's not infinite, but
[57:13] it'll have an end.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; We sorrow not as others because our hope
[57:17] is in the truth that in setting our will
[57:20] to do good,
[57:22] doing good destroys evil little by
[57:24] little.
[57:28] Paul suggests that those who do not know
[57:30] this hope
[57:33] are tortured with suffering and futility
[57:36] because they embrace and endure the
[57:38] cycle
[57:39] filling that bottomless pit with water.
[57:43] It never fills up. Right?
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Therefore, if you love truth, if you
[57:48] love life,
[57:50] then it means that you will endure
[57:52] suffering.
[57:55] And I'll say we accept death.
[57:59] That may be a hard statement.
[58:02] We accept injury. We accept that
[58:04] absence.
[58:07] And then our hope is in the tree of life
[58:11] which can heal those wounds presently
[58:14] that can fill that emptiness of its own
[58:15] accord
[58:18] because we have this hope that one day
[58:20] all this evil will end.
[58:23] That's the hope. How many of us standing
[58:26] where are today can look back and say,
[58:28] "Well, if I knew this is where I'd be, I
[58:30] would not have agonized so much then."
[58:36] And maybe in just
[58:38] looking at that good, you can look at
[58:41] the evil
[58:44] and know that God has a way of making
[58:46] this work out.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; If we're truly to appreciate the good,
[58:50] there is some sense of accepting evil
[58:52] and examining evil and recognizing evil
[58:55] to the fullest extent. Otherwise, we
[58:57] create that artificial good which is
[58:59] imaginary.
[59:01] And so if we're really to have faith and
[59:03] to trust in God and to believe in him uh
[59:05] with this real true hope,
[59:08] this hope of glory, then we believe that
[59:11] God heals all wounds.
[59:14] And that being Christians, we don't have
[59:16] to be afraid of death.
[59:19] That even in death, there's some glory
[59:22] to it. There's some beauty to it.
[59:25] But it's life that is real. As the psalm
[59:28] of life says and Henry Wadris Longfell,
[59:30] life is real. Life is earnest. The grave
[59:32] is not the goal. Dust thou art to dust
[59:35] returnest. Was not spoken of the soul.
[59:39] We have a hope that transcends this
[59:41] life. It's a hope in good that is
[59:43] greater than the good and evil that's
[59:44] even here on earth.
[59:47] And it's life. Thy loving kindness is
[59:50] better than life. What is that? This
[59:51] life.
[59:53] What is that life which is good? Eternal
[59:55] life.
[59:57] sit at the gates and watch for wisdom.
[1:00:02] Wait at its door. That's what we can do
[1:00:05] on a daily basis
[1:00:07] to make life good, to have life. Let's
[1:00:09] stand to our feet.
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:20] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[1:00:21] our gracious heavenly father.
[1:00:24] Lord, it
[1:00:27] thank you for being so kind to us, Lord.
[1:00:31] And we know that when it comes to the
[1:00:32] subject of death, there's a tremendous
[1:00:34] wrestling.
[1:00:37] There is a
[1:00:39] a war within ourselves
[1:00:43] to accept
[1:00:46] death
[1:00:48] as a good.
[1:00:51] Now Lord, there is maybe some relief in
[1:00:53] recognizing that death in itself is a
[1:00:55] consequence of the tree of knowledge
[1:00:56] that murder is evil, death is evil,
[1:01:00] but that there's this redeeming quality
[1:01:02] in death and that redemption of life had
[1:01:06] to come through death
[1:01:10] and that you have used death as a
[1:01:11] vehicle to deal with the devil himself
[1:01:15] and hell that follows him. that one day
[1:01:18] there will be this summation and this
[1:01:20] totality, this finishing up which it
[1:01:22] death of the body is placed under our
[1:01:24] feet and then the death, the second
[1:01:26] death will have finished its course and
[1:01:28] vanquished all evil forever.
[1:01:33] And Lord, I pray that
[1:01:35] those of us who have experienced death
[1:01:39] [Music]
[1:01:44] could be comforted by you.
[1:01:49] those that fear death
[1:01:52] could embrace the hope that it speaks
[1:01:55] of.
[1:01:58] Now Lord, there's so many evils that we
[1:02:00] could examine.
[1:02:02] So many evils that are ever pressing, so
[1:02:04] many dis so much dissonance that
[1:02:06] surrounds us. Somehow Lord, you used
[1:02:09] death for great glory.
[1:02:12] Somehow Lord, you've ordained it. You
[1:02:13] wrote the drama. You've you've composed
[1:02:15] this symphony to include those dissonant
[1:02:18] tones of loss,
[1:02:21] even the silence and the absence, but
[1:02:22] yet somehow, Lord, it just creates that
[1:02:24] tension and expectation of redemption.
[1:02:28] How is it that emptiness and absence
[1:02:30] could testify of your presence? How is
[1:02:32] it that death could point to your glory,
[1:02:35] but yet we see it? And ask, Father, that
[1:02:38] you be a comforter to those who have
[1:02:39] lost, Lord, to those who fear death.
[1:02:42] May they fear it no longer.
[1:02:45] Surely Lord, we can call it what it is.
[1:02:47] Surely we don't try to hasten our death.
[1:02:49] Surely we don't tempt you
[1:02:52] by pursuing it.
[1:02:55] But Lord, we pursue you, the tree of
[1:02:57] life,
[1:02:58] knowing that it is life to us.
[1:03:02] Keep us as the apple of your eye. Lord,
[1:03:04] lead us and guide us. We thank you for
[1:03:06] the visitors that are here, the
[1:03:07] perseverance to endure such heat. And
[1:03:09] Lord, I pray that you'd be a blessing
[1:03:11] upon the people as they are dismissed.
[1:03:13] We ask all this in the name of Lord
[1:03:14] Jesus Christ.
