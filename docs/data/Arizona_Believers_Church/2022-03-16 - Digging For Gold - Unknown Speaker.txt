TRANSCRIPT
========================================
first corinthians chapter 10 verse 31 i'd like to read this and provided it for you on the slide first corinthians chapter 10 verse 31 it's very short and i hope that you can just really ponder just the depth of this paul is teaching us um so many wonderful things in this uh talking about even how we ought to be servants and uses israel as an example and he's going to talk about proper worship and communion even get into the lord's supper diversities of gifts there's a lot that he's dealing with he makes this statement kind of in the middle of all these things i think is very very important whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god whatsoever therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever ye do and that kind of becomes all-encompassing due all to the glory of god lord bless you you can be seated all right i made uh i mentioned this now i made two statements or did two things on sunday that i think have had people a little bit perplexed the last thing i did is i in in praying at the end of service i entered into what is called intercessory prayer and i had at least a half a dozen people ask me if everything was okay afterwards and uh just because of what i was praying and so i think i'm fine but sometimes the spirit gives utterance to things that we don't know but it was just a feeling that came on me as i began to pray and i felt that i was praying for somebody else we talked about a decision a crossroads or being at a decision or being in a cycle that someone feels that they can't break out of that was just me opening up my heart and beginning to pray so i always i was happy to know that many people were praying for me i thought i had that going for me but i wouldn't want you to be worried that somehow everything's falling apart and i was losing having a crisis there at the end of service having said that the other thing i did is i just showed a graphic and it was kids eat free on wednesdays and i'm not even gonna explain it tonight you're just gonna have to ponder it but kids eat free and tonight i noticed that the slide didn't save right and i spent way too much time trying to figure that out but my title and i i first i want to let put this way i want to start a new segment being a segment it's not necessarily serious it doesn't mean we'll pick it up on sunday or even next wednesday just be a segment we get to every once in awhile called kids eat free you can just ponder that chew on it a little bit pun intended and uh you get what you expect so if you're expecting a kid's mill if you have enough faith maybe you'll get one but uh in the natural that is but this will be the first installment uh in this segment of kids eat free like to do it on wednesday nights as the lord would lead and the title this the subject i wanted to explore tonight is digging for gold and you could show the next slide whether john will just use this as our launching point and this subject matter digging for gold i want to use this kind of what has been burning to me is last november that the lord put this on my heart and began exploring it is that there's a hidden there's a hidden glory of the family there's ways that we look at the family think about the family and we see certain things that are maybe important or necessary even family can be a hot button topic politically in different ways but there's a hidden glory of the family that i want to explore and so my proposition tonight is that children are the glory of the family so i'm just i'm proposing that to you that children are the glory of the family and it being a proposition you can make up your mind in your hearts just exactly what that means or even if that's true but i would say that children are the family's gold it's a treasure of the family something very precious and the uh the limit that i'd want to place on that or something to take into consideration so that you don't take it too far outside of its bounds or the caveat as we have it listed here is this is a this is not the basis for per uh parenting from the point of pride or selfishness to where we think well we want to do everything vicariously through our children or we're constantly trying to force our children when we talked last year about no filter i think that was something that we emphasized quite a bit is that we don't want our children to live a life and live life in such a way to we feel it reflects good on us as parents what we should want is the best for our children and in desiring that know that at the end of the day that's what's going to give us the greatest satisfaction the bible says we there's no greater joy than to see our children walking in truth and and children walking in truth may not give you the political or social clout that you want even within a church right so it's not it's not this acceptance or feeling important and not that kind of gold where everybody thinks you're rich but it's in a real true way so the the disclaimer on that is we're not not mentioning children as being gold and the digging for gold and something selfish that you want to get out of your children the bible says in proverbs chapter 22 verse 6 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it i can still remember one of the first times i remember a minister really breaking this down it was brother tom for the tom ray ministering on it and expounding upon what this meant and to train up a child in a way he should go it uh leaves it's a principle maybe that begs a lot of questioning like well what does that mean what is the way that he should go but then it gives us principle and when he is old he will not easily depart from it this is something that has a guiding power upon the child and it's a principle that we've we've all heard this before right i mean this is a scripture that parents really really hold on to maybe his children oh yeah yeah i've heard it but one day if the lord tears you but yeah i believe it because it'll mean more to you but the way he should go even this phrase train up a child i think that has a particular meaning and emphasis that we can amplify in the way he should go that phrase is often misunderstood because we think uh train up a child and this is the way we probably process in the way that we think he should go straight up a child in what we think he ought to do but even the way the wording is used in the hebrew it's not our way but train up a child in his way so there's a there's a sensitivity and understanding even that there's a way that we want to train up a child to where we're training him up and raising him up i just want to be sure that i i'm going to be coming back to this scripture and i want to be sure that i i leave it right where i want it to be that there's a way that we train up the child that's peculiar to that child but and not necessarily our opinion or what we would desire i could have the desire as a father say well i have a i have a law practice that i could pass down to my sons and sons you need to be lawyers this is a tremendous opportunity for you and that could be my desire but there has to be a sensitivity that to train him up in the way that he should go that's different from the desire i might have naturally see my son accomplish something and that's where i think maybe we address that caveat this is nothing selfish from the point of parenting or any kind of negative pride or bad pride now this may seem to be kind of a huge leap from that but now that we've kind of established that kids eat free and tonight we're preaching about digging for gold and we've established that in mark chapter 1 verse 1 it says the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god this fits in very well these next several moments will fit in very well with the subject matter we opened up on sunday on i am an open book and i want to explore the things about jesus christ and so maybe this is just helping me a little bit by sharing some of these things now but mark writes it this way the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ describing him as we all believe the son of god we realize we use the language let's ponder a little bit more deeply tonight jesus christ was or is the son of god and the bible clearly and over and over again and jesus himself using this language quite often of expressing this relationship of the father and the son and the new testament it constantly expresses it this way and this is a dynamic that's very unique to the new testament because the the children of israel viewed abraham as their father and the god they worshipped as the god of their fathers and now jesus begins to use a language that's very unique and he's saying here here am i is what you believe to be a mortal man who has a relationship to god the god of abraham i have a relationship to him as a son which is not even a relationship that abraham shared and so for god to choose and i want you to recognize this is god's desire for god to choose this exact expression of the messiah and and savior since those are two distinct offices to the expression i say offices the jews believe in a messiah or an anointed one the concept of a savior wasn't ex wasn't exactly very clear to them but for god to choose the expression of sonship in the messiah and the savior was very unexpected and we looked at this on sunday in john chapter 5 verses 17 and 18 it says but jesus answered them my father worketh here the two and i work he's doing something on a sabbath this is against the law this is worthy of stoning and he says my father works so i work and this is jesus now they knew exactly what he was saying when he said my father they didn't go well joseph's not here he doesn't work on saturdays they knew he was talking about god the i am so therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father and this is what was in this is clearly what is understood by the jews when jesus says that god was his father making himself equal with god so this is there's a there was a reverence an honor a a pride a treasure embodied in a father-son relationship a parent to child to the jews and so when he said that the the god elohim jehovah was his father that they immediately began to relate to how important that would have been in their law and in their history and their structure think of they're called the children of israel just think how tightly they were bound to familiar relationship and bloodline like none of us call ourselves children of the name of our great great great great great great great grandpa right we don't we just don't do it and so but to them they were identified and measured by these relationships and by their fathers the god of our fathers the god of our fathers and to a jew when he says that he refers to the father my father works here too and the son works here to a jew even the word son which would be ben it means it comes from the word bana which means to build or continue and this so this is what even the word sun kind of assumes we think sun and we immediately say oh it's just a child of a of a parent it's a son is the male offspring of a mom a son is a male offspring of a father but it meant more for this in this word sun which would be ben it's the builder of the family name and for this the word that's used that was attached to the sun initially is the sun is the multiplication of the father and that's what god intended in the beginning that's why he gave the woman to the man was to multiply the man so a son is a duplication or a multiplication of the father and so in the scripture you could have been ben and i or ben haddad and it's the son of it could be written away son of my sorrow the son of haddad and so ben is the son of so if you think of being to use even the name benjamin it's to denote that this is something that comes from the parent so it's always related to the parent in the new testament simon barjona what is that simon son of jonah so he actually is identified by his father in his name because that's what a son represents he represents uh the father he's a multiplication of the father to the point to where now he says my father works and i work and they immediately say well then if you're saying that god is your father you've made yourself equal to god because that's what a son is that's his position his calling is to ultimately assume that place as the family the builder and the progenitor of the family name and even the legacy then of that name so it's upon this basis that jesus declared the father i come in my father's name multiple times he references the father and as the son he manifests the father's glory this is what is mentioned quite often in the scripture in john chapter 1 verse 14 it says in the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father no other man could claim that title at that time as being the only one that god has fathered the only man born of a woman that came from god came from the process of the word of god forming itself in the womb of a virgin and being brought forth as the only begotten son of god and now the word made flesh in jesus christ they're beholding his glory but not just the glory of jesus the son of joseph in the natural or jesus the man of galilee but the glory of the father is expressed in him and if that's not clear you could see how paul brings it back in second corinthians chapter four verses five and six for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ so where is the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ it is the face of jesus christ that we behold that declares to us and manifest to us the glory of god this is a familiar refrain to a jew because they they knew that when moses had met god on the mountain top his face was shining with this glow with this countenance having met the glory of god and they had to veil his face well that which was symbolized and represented in moses is made perfect in christ that it's through jesus christ you know the glory of god the light to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god on the face of jesus christ why the son is the glory of the father christ is the manifestation of the glory of god as his image as his expression philip said show us the father and the sight suffice he says have i been so long with you that you don't know who i am when you've seen me you've seen the father now we realized that in the literal sense if we tried to kind of get very literal on that uh and and try to make it in a literal sense we realize that he's saying that whatever god is in the invisible sense as this elohim this invisible god he is now tangible he's now expressed in me this there's a there's a glory of god that's being expressed hebrews 1 2 and 3 and i know i'm taking some time to do this but i think these are important things to be very fresh in our minds he says hath in these god have by pastimes spoken by the prophets but hath in these last days spoken us by his son whom he hath appointed air of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory in the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sin sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high all these scriptures are showing us that jesus as the son of god was declaring the glory of god his grandeur his majesty his character his attributes what he is you could know through jesus christ and this is then it's a very important relationship that god wants to establish because again just kind of backing up on in one sense the messiah could come as a natural man and and come as one who is born of a woman but yet uh according to all these different prophecies and and the jews would have received a man of that of that caliber of that stature and there's ones that the jews believe that lived natural lives and led the people and did certain things that were very very close to what a messiah should have been but yet didn't fully fulfill all the prophecies and they believed that those natural men were more like more of a messiah than christ was whom we believe to have come straight from god because they don't they don't see it that way but god wanted it to be a man he wanted it to be if we could say a son of man but he want he wanted to establish a relationship between himself the deity the divine and humanity he wanted to establish a relationship so that through that we could begin to understand ourselves and understand the relationship that he wants us to have with god so the son manifested and declared the father's glory we could say the son of man was the glory of god the only way that god could truly be made flesh is in his son brother branham in the message christ is the mystery god revealed he says but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father this is an essential characteristic of god he is a father parenthood originated in god brother abraham says and so he loved parenthood he loved fatherhood he was a father but the only way he could express it the only way he could express fatherhood was to become a son of man so if god is going to be a father he had to become a son if god is going to be a husband he has to become a bride right we understand these principles so consider this principle this father-son relationship and what it expresses for us if there's a principle if there's a reflection of something that god wants us to gather from it let's ponder this ephesians chapter 5 verse 1 it says be therefore followers of god as dear children now there's a commandment that we ought to follow god as children would follow their fathers a child inherits its nature from its parents and that i think it's very obvious and having got through maybe the foundation part i don't know if i'm going to slow down a little bit i just felt like i have to get that part in and maybe i'm very preachy tonight but a child inherits its nature from its parents so without any effort it imitates it it doesn't even have to try you say well there's certain instincts they have in them that are just inherent in they've inherited them they're in their gen their dna it's their genetics and so without any effort they can mimic their parents a son will mimic the father a daughter will mimic the mom and there'll be certain attributes and traits that children exhibit like oh that's just like their dad or that's just like their mom or that's just like me or that's just like you it's in them by nature now that that can it probably scares a lot of us right like oh no because when you're born again by the new birth you receive a new nature but for some reason god did not allow the new nature to pass genetically whenever you have children it follows your old nature unfortunately so think about this you're born in sin you're shaped in iniquity you know the life you live to the point that you got born again but you get born again you're filled with the holy ghost and then you get married and you have children because that's the proper order and then now having children you're like oh no they've got the nature i had before i was married before i had the holy ghost and then you realize that parenthood has a great the greatest power to influence and to shape the character of a child the single greatest power i know that there's a certain uh i know there's even a chinese proverb that men resemble their times more than their parents but we're not chinese and there's uh there's certain ideas that could be expressed that the children can be reflective of their generation and their school peers and things and that's if you let it that's if you let it but there's really no better way for a child to be influenced than by his parents and true parenthood is a calling it is an office think of how and we're just maybe touch on it very quickly god entrusted his own son to the care of parents so i'm going to send a savior i'm going to send the messiah i'm going to send him into the world he's going to be me replicated he's going to be bone of my bone he's going to be flesh of my flesh he's going to have my spirit without measure i'm going to pour myself into him but i'm going to from birth and trust him to a father and a mother and this is god wanting to reflect something very powerful to us so if we are parents then this responsibility matters and i would say it's responsibility that never ceases because it may be very easy for some to say well at this point brother aaron's talking about families talking about raising families my children are grown up then then that doesn't apply to me but really when do you when do you cease to become a parent you know by divorce you can cease to be a spouse but you'll never stop being a parent even when the child dies does it get serious all of a sudden ask anybody who's ever lost a child it's not like oh well they died so i'm not a mom anymore no they'll carry it with them as a mom their entire lives why because there's something so powerful about this office this responsibility matters so so tremendously and our manner of life in this calling how we conduct ourselves in this colonies of utmost importance in the message elisha the prophet brother braham says and how can you expect your children to go to sunday school and serve the lord when you yourself don't even go that's a pretty powerful statement isn't it so brother branham says you shouldn't send your kids to sunday school right you've heard that brother man said you shouldn't send your kids to sunday school he said you should take him and he's touching on this attitude where maybe you're expecting things of your children that they ought to do but how can you expect them to go to sunday school when you don't even go yourself right they i want them to be faithful i want to be persevered i want them to be church-going people i want them to honor the lord i want them to do this and to do that he said how could you expect them to do it if you don't do it yourself and he says this how can you expect your children to be something when you're nothing that's a heavy statement so that he he recognizes the heaviness i don't mean you wasn't nothing but i mean when you know that you make no profession when you know you're not this is brother aaron talking now when you know you're not doing something how can you expect your children to be that something hey i i'm going to step on everyone's toes but it's kind of like will you stop yelling right how do you expect them to stop yelling if that's all you do they're like okay yes mom there's a certain thing that's been reflected in conduct that children are naturally going to turn back around to you i said how can you expect something from them when you're not doing something yourself how can you expect your children to be righteous when you're putting such an example before them how can you do it you're the best example that they have they're going to look to you when they won't look for no one else because your nature is in them the example matters it's the example that in a lot of a lot of ways if you could i i have to just really rely on the holy spirit to maybe do with your hearts on to a deeper level but our parents took us to church took us to meetings put the word first sacrificed for years and then we have an experience with god we get the holy ghost and then we start we start doing those things by nature now by a new nature that our parents tried to demonstrate and expressed to us beforehand and let's not forget the positive things that were done that led to the place to where we could receive a baptismal holy ghost and go forward because if we're not if we're not doing if we don't do even the things our parents did then how can we expect better results all right to those on the radio the people are shaking their heads up and down vigorously to those who are tuning in by phone hookup and you can't see the the vigorous nods but the the people are agreeing think about that how humbling that can be that if a prior generation had it so hard and they met that they met that difficulty with a certain intensity and then this generation has it harder and we're not even meeting the intensity of the prior generation there's a tremendous imbalance that begins to take place something to consider so the the the children are to be followers we are told to be followers of god as dear children what i want you to recognize then as that god paul is referencing and even uses it later follow me as i follow god so that kind of is the right example if i'm your father in the gospel and i'm following the right thing there's no detriment in you following me right if it's the blind leaders of the blind or they all fall in the ditch but if you're following an enlightened leader if you're following one who knows the way and someone who knows the truth then even if you're blind the in the following you could come to the light you could come to sight because the the disciple would be as the master so there's this dynamic of then children then being predispositioned to mimic and imitate their parents that's a sobering thought and if they have your nature to begin with then they'd be better served by a different nurture right if if my sons have aaron mcgeary's nature by birth then what i would want to do is nurture them in the lord not in more aaron now in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 7 as i've kind of amplifying how the son christ was the manifestation of the father's glory now think about this scripture for indeed for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of god and the woman is the glory of the man now this is a familiar scripture but i'm just going to walk through it the man is the image and glory of god so the man reflects the glory the majesty the excellence of god we say in his original state man in his original state represented god's glory represented god's perfection that's what he was to be on earth as a god having dominion and power this was all reflected in the office of manhood when god made men and therefore manhood retains this image even still now as we talked about it last wednesday god is the good that there's still an element of deity in the divine a shadow that still shocks mankind to this day and it's when someone does really good it shocks us right because that if there's good it has to be god that has to be something divine and so man even still today holds an office or position that is reflective of god's nature it's the place that god has put him in the scripture and where what the office that he holds now as the bible is saying the man is in the image of god it says but the woman is the glory of the man so likewise the woman is intended to be an expression of man's glory that the man coming from god and being in the image of god is reflective of god's glory now the woman coming from the man she becomes a reflection of the man's glory but remember kind of the order at the order of that ascending she is now an expression of man's glory she's a reflection of his majesty his honor because she's come from the man and and i don't i i'd love to maybe express this and amplify this to greater detail but the woman represents a man's character if she is the woman who has come out from the man or she's the woman that is joined to the man she represents his judgment his opinion the woman is if i can say that she is the opinion of the man now that means that if and we're looking at a man and a woman is man and wife in that relationship the man is in the image of god and therefore he represents the glory of the father but now in the marriage the woman represents and is expressive of the glory of the man because she reflects his opinion she is his opinion so he's saying his opinion of this woman is that she's worthy to be a wife she's beautiful she's someone that i have i want to have so she represents his opinion but then also others can look at the woman and by looking at the woman derive some assessment about the man i don't know if i shared this with you but uh last election psych when i was getting some quotes from very close friends of mine saying that they believed that kamala harris fulfilled the prophecy of this woman rising up to power in the united states and kind of just jokingly cuz i i said well the only thing that tells me is you think she's beautiful and and that was their opinion of her and i didn't hear from him for a while so i had to text back and say hey hey i was kind of joking uh but the uh it's it's reflective of his opinion a man's opinion that if this is he believes that she is a quality woman to marry she says something about what he desires and what his expectations are and if you looked at her and said she has no desire to have children she has no desire to keep home or she has no desire to be a christian she has no desire to act with integrity or honesty then you would say that man it must not matter to him it must not have mattered to him at all to marry a woman that would be a compliment the bible says in proverbs 12 4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband she is the coronation of his office the coronation of his title she is a crown to her husband that to think of the crowning moment for man is this woman that he marries but she that maketh ashamed is rottnest in his bones now why why would she be rockness in his bones it's only the power to corrupt is only as great as it is because of the power she has to crown if she had no power to corrupt there'd be no crown but because a a woman that makes a shame is rottnest in his bones the the fact that she has power to corrupt by the reverse she has power to crown and we're familiar with this principle in choosing of a bride there's a lot of statements that fit this the kind of a woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition and his character the kind of man that a woman uh the woman is chosen by man when a man chooses a woman that ma that woman that he chooses reflects something about what's on the inside of them as we expressed it before there's something hidden about the man that's not revealed until he chooses a wife there's a this is uh well there's things that begin to rush into my heart that i'm thinking about even personally but there might be things that you recognize and you see and you may you could speculate at say well i'm not sure i don't know but then the choosing of a wife reveals a lot and brother batman even says that a man that when a man chooses a wife it says something about his future home and what he wants his home to be even though it does not yet exist it reveals the character of his heart and what he wants to achieve and that's why the bride is the new jerusalem previewed revealed beforehand because he chooses the bride to be wife and she reflects the future home of what he wants his home to be so there is a glory of the man which is reflective of the father and then you have the woman who is the glory of the man and now in this chain of glory it's it's not that it drops off this is the the man is in the image of god and therefore he represents the glory of god but now the woman is the glory of the husband and so in that image i want to ask you what about the children that are the product of that union if the man is the glory of god and the woman is the glory of the man there has to be some a equals b e well c a equals c going on there somehow right just in the there has to be some continuity of what the woman is represented when she represents the character of a man so if this is true of the man and the woman what about the children what about the whole as i think the saying is and there's a tremendous debate as to where it originates but the the whole is not just the sum of the parts that there's something greater that comes out of when the when the parts come together that you can't just look at you can't just look at all the ingredients of bread and say well there they are they they make bread but once it comes together in the right way the whole is greater than the sum of the parts i know i've kind of ventured into philosophy and some of you are either really liking it or you're wincing but i want you to ponder that in a family take a man all right you got the man you got the woman okay you got the woman and you got the children okay you've got them well you've got them let's just put them together and add them together well no that's not quite going to be enough what about when they're made when they're together when they when they're they become whole and it's the whole is greater than the sum of its parts it's something that god wants to reflect the man maybe he has a glory on his own but the man when he's joined to the woman there's some multiplication of that glory because now the woman is the glory of the man i'm saying then what about the children in psalms 127 verses 3 to 5 lo children are in heritage of the lord this is what children are they're a heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward that's why i have a saying you can't lose when you have kids i've been asked the question before do you know if you're having a boy or a girl and i'm like yeah is there a third option yeah we're having a boy or a girl and they don't necessarily appreciate my sarcasm but either way you can't lose boy or girl you can't lose as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth of youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them that's five brother travis five five not three five happiest man has this quiver full they shall not be ashamed but they the children speak with the enemies in the gate a man who has five children and i believe that a quiver would be five so a man who has many children is quiver full he's got these children of strength and vitality he will they will not be ashamed nor would the parents be ashamed but he has defenders protectors those that will will stand together shoulder to shoulder to speak against the enemies in the gate and so the word of god is validating this sense of the preciousness and the value of children children are a heritage an inheritance given to you if you have if you know someone that has children if you're one that has children yourself then there's a there's an acknowledgement to god i say saved or unsafe there's an acknowledgement to god that children are a gift from god and there's so much that could be said in that vein but consider then the glory that our children represent do we fully appreciate and and recognize the value of their worth i don't ask that in a rhetorical manner that you don't i'm just asking do you feel that you do brother branham in the message it wasn't so from the beginning it's the first place i found where he's making this direct statement but he says that a brother said to omnipotence me he said i have to write that down or the way that he references it it's like he had heard it and he says he says the two opposite impotence mean i wrote that down he says when god and a believer meets there's two omnipotents so god and a believer a believer is an omnipotent god is a nominee because a man is a part of god he is a son of god and what little he is joins with the entire body so in a couple other places where he references two omnipotence meetings he says something's got to shake he talks about how it creates a power why because god is an omnipotent and a believer is an omnipotent now i'm wanting you to think now as spiritual minded sons and daughters of god then that if i am a son of god and i marry a daughter of god and if me as a son of god meeting god is to omnipotence meeting because i'm a part of god then there must be something on some level somehow of an omnipotent joining together with an omnipotent when a believing man and a believing woman come together you begin to recognize how there may be a higher order to not being unequally yoked it may not be because your soul will be sent to hell but just think about the power that is resident in a family when a believing man and a believing woman are joined together in holy matrimony there's two omnipotence meeting in a promise he says it'll shake something something's got to shake it creates a power and think of all the instances where jesus is two or three two or three two or three and he even says if two will agree is it touching anything why it's it's those omnipotence meeting what does it say in mark chapter 10 verses six to nine i'll just skip to verse nine is it saying the two shall be one flesh when a man shall leave his father and mother in the beginning god created a male and female and when a man leaves his father and mother and cleaves to his wife there'll be one flesh not no more two but one flesh verse nine what therefore god hath joined together let no man put us under two omnipotents being joined together under a covenant marriage is in the covenant parenthood is joined with the covenant and i say children as that was my proposition children are the glory of the family i would say that children may often be the unrecognized or the hidden glory of this union of god because in there is in the in timothy it talks about how the woman shall be saved in childbearing brother branham if she continues in the in these things he makes a statement in marriage and divorce it's very unique and he says and remember she being a part of a man the bible said she nevertheless has suffered not a woman to teach or to usurp authority any authority but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived but the byproduct was deceived notwithstanding she shall be saved as she continues in holiness and sobriety and in childbearing and all such because then she becomes a part of this man you notice that because then she becomes a part of this man there is this this recognition in two instances in the word of god where brother branham kind of uses this to make the point not that there was some maybe literal uh some way that god had the option but he uses this to make the point that when adam took the woman and she was burying holding his son that god couldn't judge her because a part of the man was in her and then when it came to sarah he uses a very interesting take on it that when sarah laughs god couldn't judge her because she was going to be the one to whom the promise came so she's joined she's joined with the man and therefore she's part of the covenant but then once conception and birth takes place it's in the child that they've truly literally become one flesh it's like people i've said this a lot with my wife they say well who do you think i think maybe has asked the question who do you think your children are gonna look like or what are your children look like i said they're gonna look like what children will look like if aaron and elizabeth have a child and oh he looks like his dad yeah because that's his dad oh he looks like his mom yeah because that's his mom right it's a mixture it's a blending together there's actually now been a union and even this natural birth god gets the credit for it even brother man said the natural birth is more supernatural and you kind of figure that out but in that way that god brings this life together and this life comes forth and in looking at this life that is in that there has been a union of the dna there has been a joining together of father gene and mother jeans coming together and recreating and producing that child and brother man makes this statement that through child bearing then she becomes what an indivisible part of the man forever joined together with the man because now there's a product of their union that is the man and the woman now joined and being reflected out and he said then she becomes a part of the man what god hath joined together it cannot be divided in that child and i'm just saying to you with a very heavy heart that we must be thinking very spiritually very deeply very maturely about these things these are not things that are the property of dr dobson these are not the things that are the properties of men and their psychologies and their approach to families this is something divine this is something precious this is something that we've got to get right before we get out of here because it's it's the glory of the union even to use the language that at the opening of the seals the full word is going to be born into manifestation implies that the product of the union is the glory of the union in proverbs 22 6 we're coming back to this i'm not just starting over in my notes because it's only 8 13 i'm coming back to it proverbs chapter 22 verse 6 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he'll not depart from it initiate the child at the opening of his path inspire him motivate him at the opening of his path remember his path his way her way her path if i could say this and i hope that you can ponder this very deeply now and concentrate that in the natural there are hundreds of successful paths i know brother lucas might want us to think that all we should ever be are programmers but we all can't be programmers otherwise you'd programmers would have nobody to program for and you get paid bucks an hour but uh that's not that's not an argument to brother lucas but we can't all do that right and to that point brother lucas has a process to kind of find those who can be programmers because not everybody can program it's not everyone can cook right this isn't a disney movie or whatever that was there's things that some people are better predisposed to there's things that people enjoy and they like and even within the the world of coding and i'm getting way outside of my uh expertise is there's many different paths within that that you can be and some are better suited for different things and this is i want you to consider this that when it comes to natural things there's a lot of successful paths you can take oh this person is in this line of work and this person does this and this person does that and this person got their degree and this person got this trade certificate this person does this this person owns this business and there's hundreds and hundreds of hundreds of different jobs that we could have and call that we have and in that be successful and i want you to think of how remarkable this is we can have different ethnicities different cultural backgrounds different social economic statuses we can all have different jobs and we can all have so many varieties of taste and likes and desires and inclinations and all of that be be successful and be fine and be uh and be good but when it comes to the word of god we all take the same path now just scratch your head on that for a while think about that that god designed a word so beautiful and so perfect that it could take people from different ethnicities cultures we all have different experiences different backgrounds things that we've gone through losses hurts things that we've gained and been added to us but yet the word of god could somehow on some level be applicable to all of us and though there may be thousands of ways that we could be successfully naturally there's only one path we can take and be successful spiritually and so when it comes to the path that we should go we're initiating the opening of the child's path we need to consider how much that relates to the spiritual part and not so much the natural part if you train him up in the way that he should go when he's old he will not depart from it there is a spiritual success that we ought to desire for our children this is the one i believe that i'm probably the most uh and the most fervent of tonight as i speak this is it's a recognition of the value that our children hold in proverbs chapter 19 verses 26 to 27 he that wasteth his father and chaseth away his mother is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach these are very heavy words cease my son to hear the instruction that causeth to air from the words of knowledge now this is obviously pointed at the child right just by clear language he that wastes his father and chases his mother causes shame and brings reproach so son stop listening to the things that cause you to err from the words of knowledge so then what is our responsibility our responsibility is that we are giving the correct law the correct knowledge the the the rule the wisdom of the father the law of the mother we have to recognize our responsibility that's already assumed in this this is a presupposition to this that he that wasteth his father and chased his mother causes shame and brings reproach when what they have brought him to is the words of knowledge to ways just to spoil what has been given the bible is saying that he robs and insults those he ought to honor when they have initiated him in the right path when they had given him the right spiritual instruction when they've looked out over a spirit and despite all the nature that they gave him by natural birth they nurtured him in the holy spirit and nurtured him in the admonition of the lord and they and they used that holy spirit to work against their base instincts and and used it to apologize when necessary used it to moderate when necessary used it to guide their child's heart while they had the opportunity to keep that garden cleanest as a child that then wastes his father and chases the way his mother that causes shame and brings reproach but the power to waste and chase only existed because the power to raise and praise he would only have power to waste and chase if by the virtu by the opposite he had power to raise them up by he had the power then to praise his parents to be to be a legacy something that spoke of their legacy something to be cherished something to be honored just as the woman is a crowned or a husband but he she that make it ashamed is roughness in his bones she only has power to corrupt because she has the power to crown children only have the power to waste in chase because they have a power then to be the glory and an expression of something very beautiful in the parental union i say it this way there's glory in our children something that we have a duty to bring out of them that's why i came with the idea of digging for gold i'll be honest i asked a couple brothers how the title gold digger sounded and they cautioned me in my innocence i might not know exactly what that phrase means so i just uh took their advice and backed out but that's what we're doing as parents it may not look like it but that bag of dirt sitting next to you got gold in it right there's golden and those children that god has given us brother branham says in the message come follow me and i i want you now to ponder this as i i can't read the entirety of the statement but he's praying he says let us pray and he says lord jesus youth men and women for tomorrow if there is a tomorrow we must train them lord we feel that burden to train them like there will be a tomorrow if if we get so uh spiritual super spiritual to where we think wow what's the point you know the lord's already come or the lord's coming tomorrow what's the point that you're not you're just not listening to the word we have a burden to train them as if there would be a tomorrow why do we have a burden to train them as if there would be a tomorrow because that's our duty today and in the fail and failing to perform our duty it only would delay the inevitable that we're choosing using as a reason to delay you follow me well i don't have to raise my kids because the lord's coming tomorrow the lord's like saying if you don't raise your kids i ain't coming tomorrow just using your language it's incumbent upon us why is there a language they're waiting on us they're dependent on us why is there have to be some liberty of the holy spirit to move through us so freely that it replicates the image of christ and it touches all that have gone into the grave and we go in the rapture because we have a duty that we must fulfill and will never fulfill unless our eyes are awakened to see the gold that sits in the chairs next to us tonight oh would it strike the heart of a mother or father to see the gold right now sit in their rooms out doing something else the gall that is out in the world today that could be in the house of god tonight and you say well okay brother aaron where's where's the where in the world do you get digging for gold in this i just personally i say there's a way that god confirms things to me and i know that i found the channel and i think every man of god has a different way of knowing that they've they've come to that mind of god but i have such an absolute confidence that i found the mind of god that i cannot waver on what i'm saying tonight and in this where he says we must train them this thought just kept coming to me over and over we must train and we have a duty to train like there will be tomorrow so i went back and i was reading the message come follow me and brother branham and i took the paragraph numbers out when i grabbed the quote here i don't have it because it's very lengthy he says can we pray and this is what he says we have a duty to train them like there would be a tomorrow but right before he prays he tells two stories and the first story he tells is this fairy tell story of a man who found a flower and found the flower and he's going to provide some magic and he says you've been poor your whole life now ask what you want and i'll give it to you and the man says yonder there there's a mountain yonder if it would open up i could go there in and find the gold in the mountain but the prerequisite was okay you have to take me with you everywhere you go you have to take me with you wherever i am then you can ask what you will he goes to the mountain and the mountain opens up and he goes in he says brother man says shells full of golden diamonds this this flower this magical flower opened up to him this this mountain of gold and diamonds and he put the the flower down on a rock or a table and he says now i'm a rich man i have everything i need and he says and and he i think he says he's gonna run to go out and he wants to uh grab something to go out and show all of his friends and the flower says you forgot the main thing so he runs back i'll get a piece of gold i get a piece of silver and the flower says but you forgot the main thing he runs back says in here we find all kinds of materials so he picked up a stone he grabbed all these things i'm going to be able to show the people and show the people he said for the final time you forgot the main thing and he turns oh be quiet i don't want to hear anymore forgot the main thing ran out the door and the door closed behind him with the flower inside and he had no way to get back to the gold why because he forgot the main thing he forgot his access to those materials he forgot his what brings him to that and then immediately he says years ago when i was i as a kid on a cattle ranch in phoenix he said i was reading a piece of a paper about a prospector and he said the prospector had come had found a struck a lot of gold and he said that when he had got the gold there an outlaw that had been following and knew that he had this gold and so he was pondering oh i can get i can become a rich man i've struck gold i've got all the gold here so much of it and as he was trying to go to sleep a dog kept barking and as it kept barking and barking he told it to be quiet screamed at the dog be quiet dog whine tried to warn his master the danger was lurking why this outlaw is there and the dog is trying to warn him of the one that's going to take his gold and he says that he took the prospect or had a shotgun didn't want to be bothered anymore and he killed the dog but then the prospector was killed that night by the outlaw i know a lot of you are familiar with the story right he tells the story about gold right before he says i have a burden i have a burden to train these young people i have a burden to train these young men and women at this point in their life and he said there's nobody makes this statement he said all his fancy dreams did him no good he stealed the voice that was warning him says there's nobody can try to do anything you kids you would never be able to do anything wrong after being raised the way you are unless you feel something tell you not to do it now don't ever steal that voice that's warning you so he says come follow me this is the this is the emphasis brother branham is this is the image that brother adam has right before he brings us to this statement we must train them lord we must train them like there's going to be a mar tomorrow we feel the burden to do it now i'm i feel like i'm taking the liberty i feel the liberty to take the liberty so give me i so i hope you have liberty to hear me take the liberty with the liberty that i feel like taking because and the burden to train i want you to recognize that it has something to do with the gold it has something to do with what's valuable has something to do with the deity that god wants to join with in our children's hearts it has something to do with the character that can be mined out of the flesh that sits before us and there might be things about our children that we don't like there might be things that we do like but if you can ever get past the facade if you could ever get past the the flesh if you ever get past that that that what meets the eye and recognize that down inside of them is a soul that is very precious to god and that has value and has merit then then i believe you can have inspiration i believe you can have motivation i believe you can recognize that you are a very wealthy person if given the responsibility to look after and to care for a son and daughter's soul and have this burden to train them and they say oh god may may i not be guilty of the man who left the main thing behind may i not be guilty of quieting that voice that warns me but god may i also instill in my children to recognize that beyond all the material things beyond all the blessings beyond the natural things they see in my life that you've given because you have to realize saints that many times it's just the tangible things that our children most readily identify as being the blessings of god but we have to find some way to let them know about the joy that's on the deep part of your soul that resides sunny shot like wind a rain lord that is there all the time there has to be a way to convey to them a steadiness and integrity and honesty and uprightness and that they can begin to value the main thing and the voice that preserves us nice brother branham makes this statement in the message an absolute he says i see the word is the absolute and i'm tied to it and determined i'll know nothing else but jesus christ and him crucified now brother branham speaks very personally but i believe that it has application to all of us and applications to the children of god as we would view them but lucas even think about what we fellowshipped on just briefly today think about how he says this no matter what anybody he says he had a reason for it and i'm determined to hold that reason no matter what anybody else says i don't disfellowship them or discredit them but i know what i'm tied to wanted me like this he made me like this i was made like that for a purpose i had to be made up of all these qualities and so forth think about how often we try to force people to fit our way and our whole purpose either it's a church that gets misguided or parents that get misguided or whatever it might be we think to train up a child the way he should go is to beat him into submission of the image that we think they should be instead of promoting an experience with jesus christ that'll make him into the son or daughter that he wants them to be but he says i was made up of all these qualities and so forth and all these no accounts so he could dig it out of me now there's that you might think oh he's got to root it out and get it out but i don't read it as something he wanted to get out in order to make you better but to get it out because there's something valuable in there he says put something in there that was his word there's some i can say this there's something that maybe we can say god takes away but it's because there's something else in there that's more valuable that detracts from the value and he wants to bring out of you the gold why because he put something in you by birth from the very time you're born there's an elect seed there he says his word and i'm determined i'll know nothing else but christ i realized we could read these things different ways but i want to look at just turn it on a different angle that god wants to dig the gold out of you he put something in there his word and he wants to bring it out of you maybe there's a lot of things that get in the way and cover it up he says but i'm determined on nothing else but christ if our musicians could make their way to their instruments i closed i'm determined to know nothing else but christ whether therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever you do do all to the glory of god whatever i eat whatever i drink whatever i do do all to the glory of god this is our ambition as christians therefore we should inspire our children to pursue the glory of god we should inspire them to to pursue it by our example and by our instruction because whatsoever we do we do for the glory of god you could ask yourself in times of difficult decisions what gives god glory what what can i do to give glory to god we may feel there's times that we have to preserve our particular position on something we might feel that there's a moment where we we want something to be made very clear like wow this person did this and i don't want anybody to know that and i think i should do this and there's a lot of a lot of things that kind of get in the way and muddied up but if you take a step back and say what will give god the glory do you find that there's a better decision in that because we're not always just defenders of what's right am i right now where sometimes we go wrong because we're just these justice warriors and we want to demand justice we want we want equity we want what's fair we want what's constitutionally right but even on that people can't agree so we have to ask ourselves what gives glory to god in that instance where a man lied about brother branham and said brother branham's not here he can't make it he got called away brother brahms just off the side of the platform sitting there and he said he's told why don't you go out there and expose this man he's he's lying and he goes oh brother i can't do that not in front of his people now you think you might think well that man deserved it amen all right i mean we all know what we would have done we would have been coming out there you know doing a dance like hello you know here i am we would have exposed the man he said that may be what the man was he's a liar that may be what that man needed he he's lying but what would have glorified god brother branham acted with the metric he acted with some with a compass he was very sensitive to what would glorify god and is that not how christ as the son he only did that which would glorify the father he did that which would please the father therefore we as parents have a have a resource in our children and what we ought to be doing in our own lives is digging for gold but what we recognize then in our children that there's so much gold in them that we can we can look over this resource and we say lord help me i i desire to raise them so they can discover gold [Music] let's stand [Music] let's pray together tonight heavenly father as we draw the service to a close a natural way lord the sermon has been delivered in the literal function of and the activity of the preaching as paul referred to it that the world calls it foolishness that that has transpired [Music] that part has been done that i believe that that is furthering your vision your purpose your plan so it's not that anything has been initiated tonight or begun we're just working within the momentum of what you have already started and lord certainly in preaching this there is not a period that has been placed upon anything but lord it will continue as the people are dismissed my prayer would be that what was preached tonight would not only resonate as a good sermon lord i wouldn't even need it to resonate as a good sermon i would just that it would resonate in the hearts of your children as something that could be applied something applicable something mind altering and mood altering something that just moves the compass lord and father i know in my heart there's maybe there's many that i would like to as a pastor to be here to hear these things feeling that these wednesday nights give us an incredible opportunity to bring together a wonderful mix of believers and and capitalize on the atmosphere and the attentiveness and the expectation to do real teaching and to share on things that may are applicable where the rubber meets the road as it were and and to bring a transforming power to the lives of our children to relationships but lord we trust you in all these things and i would tonight that what we have ministered would hit the target for people and i know that maybe i'm using clever phrases and and things lord that might seem to be ambiguous but lord maybe you could speak to everyone differently on what it means the kids eat free [Music] but lord i'm speaking to prospectors tonight we have a job to do we have a duty [Music] and maybe we're not getting out of here to the last nugget of his mind [Music] it's the lord i busy myself and your kingdom and i take responsibility for the those that you've chosen for me to be responsible for i i own it lord and i pray for your grace and for your help tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ bless us help us i pray amen amen i know these things are challenging but a believer likes to be challenged
