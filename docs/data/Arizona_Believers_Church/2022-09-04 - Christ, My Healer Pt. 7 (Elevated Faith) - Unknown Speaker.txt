TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this uh this is part seven of Christ my healer and our Focus has been on uh Divine Healing and if you just look at verse 15 with me as he tells them to go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believes what is preached and is uh baptized shall be saved he who does not believe what is preached will not be baptized and therefore um it's not necessarily on hinges on the baptism but the lack of faith it says they'll be damned and it says these signs shall follow them that believe and one sign that is emphasized at the very end of that is the one sign that follows not just one but one of the signs that follows the Believers they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so we're focusing on Divine Healing and this scripture uh speaks to that and the Very act that we would play in that in laying hands on the sick and the sick recovering and then verses 19 and 20 declares that the Lord they went forth they preached the gospel and the Lord was working with them and then there was a confirmation of the word by signs following the Believers and we could look into the book of Acts and see that the very things uh that Jesus said would follow them these signs shall fall them that believe these are written of in the book of Acts and it's recorded in the the ministries of the Apostles and the Believers and so God does that very thing in this commission and this is the order of the commission go preach the gospel to them that believe signs will follow so the gospels preach first Faith Comes second signs follow and brother brandom in the sermon as I as I was with Moses so will I be with thee this has been um a sermon that uh has so much meat to it on this subject he says listen don't you fail to get this the sign is not the commission the sign only points to the commission and so you can have a commission a job something something that you're to do or something you're to accomplish and then a sign be given and the sign is indicating it's time it's the moment this is when it needs to happen and we could get enamored with the sign or the signification of it but not actually be working in it to accomplish what it signifies he says the sign is not the commission the sign only points to the commission you get at her on the road and see a sign and it says five miles to Phoenix he says that isn't Phoenix that's a sign to show you you're on the right Road he says Jeffersonville here but we'll just uh update it for the West here you see a sign it says so many miles to a destination and that tells you you're on the right Road it's giving you an idea how near it is but he says that's not it and so the sign the sign can be very phenomenal and it can be very attention grabbing you have to realize that when there's a sign given there's the voice to follow it there's something that comes after it and so the sign Jeffersonville in 5 miles is telling you you're on the the right Road and in five miles if you know how to keep track of distance um you should be arriving at the limits and enter into the place that you're Desiring to be and so the sign is not the commission it only points to the commission so the order of the commission is that these are people who have caught the revelation of Jesus Christ and then are commissioned by this to go preach the gospel and in preaching the gospel people to are to believe and if they believe they'll be baptized and they shall be saved and then there's signs will follow those who are believers those who have received the revelation of Jesus Christ those who've been baptized and have been saved those who are preaching the gospel there signs that are to follow and brother Bram is saying the sign's not the commission and and in this particular sermon he's referring a lot to how his particular gifts and signs that operated in his ministry were becoming the focal point and he was deviating even from his commission now just because the sign isn't the commission doesn't mean the sign is worthless and so we just I I think what is important is we need to understand its purpose and its utility because there's this um there's a slippery slope sometimes when you you see something and it's gone off into fanaticism or there's too much emphasis on it or it's being misused and it's become the commission instead of the sign you might want to just kick back against it and cut down the sign like w people will figure it out when they get there well that's not how God works and so there's a way to understand the purpose of it and its utility and so my title today or subtitle is elevated faith and and in looking at elevated Faith we're wanting uh and there's so many things that I could put in here but I just elevated faith is going to speak to how Divine Healing relates to rapturing Faith where how do these fit in what's it for uh should be should we disregard Divine Healing should we speak against laying on hands uh what kind of attitude should we have towards Miracles and signs and wonders how do these things fit into rapturing Faith or we can say perfect faith and I'm wanting to use this phrase elevated Faith because brother Bron makes the statement this is something I really want to be at the focal part of it he says we want to have we want the greater faith we want to run a higher level we want the greater faith we want to run a higher level he says the Lord Jesus wants us to believe him and so elevated faith it's faith that raises above the usual position and and I just noticed on the slide something was a little off-centered so if I seem distracted uh I want to start all over scratch the slide deck can we come back at 11:30 and try this again but it's um the Lord Jesus wants us to believe him and and that's that That's the basis thing he says we want a greater Faith a higher level he says Lord Jesus wants us to believe them they're one and the same and to be elevated means to raise above usual ual position is to lift up or to promote and so if you raise something up you're elevating it from where it normally is if something that's where where it's been then it wouldn't be elevated but from where it's been if you raise it up that's to elevate someone's faith above its usual position to lift it up uh means to promote or to assign to a higher position and I like that to be exalted to to elevate to a higher position and that's that's uh that's kind of our thesis for elevated faith in the sermon and then Jesus came I want to use this to kind of set up what we're going to be looking at today brother br's talking about um healings and signs and wonders operating and uh he speaks about one boy being healed I believe and then he says in the vision of the woman that had the baby had showed the baby being crosseyed and this is a this baby has come to him he's had this Vision this baby comes to him in the prayer line we looked down to the baby its eyes were just as perfect as anybody's no one prayed no one touched at all nobody here but God touched the baby this is he's saying this baby was healed without any hands being laid on it the presence of the Lord was here to heal why did it get it it was a baby and then he says it don't have the superstitions and calluses in wonderings that we have is that remarkable to think here's a baby that in my mind I'm thinking if a woman's holding a baby and the baby comes up maybe the baby's not catching anything that happens but God's present to touch touch and because the baby has if I could just say this an unconscious Faith or an innocence or no experience with which to reject God's touch or rationalize with the scenario and ask why are we up here why are we wanting to be healed what's this feeling I feel that it having this childlike innocence God is able to even Beyond it being fully aware of what's Happening touch it he says and heal it so we have superstitions and calluses and wonderings that keep the presence of God from impacting us like it could if we had that kind of free Faith because this is what happened on the baby according to a vision it was healed without anything else intervening and I would say that's the place that we need to come to that the presence of God can work the Miracles in our lives and accomplish the things that we need to accomplish without having to worry so much about how much of the bodily efforts we can put into it he says you stand there just caught the vision of it God healed the baby no prayer nor nothing God did it and he says that's the way God likes to do it God would love to be able to have that Liberty for you to believe him so fully that when you know his near you just trust him to do whatever he wants to do he says this is on a higher level than laying on of hands now in this particular instance he is speaking of his prophetic gift the gift of discernment and the the particular sign that God had given him to catch the people's attention he says you say well brother brandham if they lay your hands on he goes I know brother Roberts believe he's speaking of brother o Roberts brother Allan AA Allen I'm sure many of the other brothers who are out praying for the sick they lay hands on them maybe anoint them with oil this would be scriptural according to James chapter 5 that's exactly the scripture that's perfectly right see they have gifts of healing and I think we need to understand what he means by that uh what a gift of healing is it's to get someone else to believe CU a a person isn't a Healer he said this is a prophetic gift showing the difference between uh what these men operate under commission and then the sign that was operating within his ministry this is a prophetic gift that's to touch each one in the lay on of hands he says that's the Jewish way of believing it how many have heard that statement before brother man refers to the Jewish way of believing it I want to go into greater detail in the future on the actual mechanics of laying on of hands and its basis in scripture but he's saying that there's a laying on of hands and there's a prophetic level there's a prophetic order and he says the laying on of hands that's within the Jewish custom and then just a little bit later he says oh I want you to believe without hands laying on just simply believe that the presence of the Lord is here to heal the sick now this in no way is dismissive of laying on of hands but he's acknowledging a general commission to preach the gospel lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but then something running on a higher level and a level upon which there would be this childlike innocence or dependence upon God to trust him that when his presence is near he can have full control he can do whatever he would want to do and so why would he want us to Simply believe the Lord Jesus believe he's present to heal the sick without even hands being laid on and I would maybe recall the emphasis last Sunday on the prophetic order the prophetic commission uh to a a major or the major and a minor and how in the general commission we're to do certain things but then there was that major move of God something major happening a dispensational change and on a prophetic level all of us have to if I say this all of us come under the commission whether you're a prophet or a piano player we we are commissioned to go into all the world and preach the gospel but then a prophet has a different commit and on that order he was tasked with bringing rapturing Faith restoring back the faith and bringing us to Faith in Jesus Christ and so this is what I want to look at now is that continue on that subject and I realize uh if if it sounds like I'm just repeating myself over and over again I think I know that I am but you feel free to show me just how bad it is and maybe we can talk about a remedy in mark 5: 22 to 23 I think those are kind of my some things I've put out there for us're they're in our in our minds now so now I'm just going to start down a path and and hopefully just be able to uh run through this and um the story is told elsewhere in in um believe in Matthew chapter 9 and here in Mark chapter 5 it says and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue Jus bind name there's different ways you hear people say that and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lith at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live this is a ruler of the synagogue so this is someone who's familiar with the customs of the synagogue one of the rulers in the church um a man of reputation a man of skill or knowledge and he comes to Christ and he says come lay hands on my daughter that she will be healed now we could get into the specifics and even how the story is told and even in the telling I believe in Matthews it says she is dead and so what he wants Jesus to do is come physically to where she is lay hands on her and and heal her bring her back to life and you find in the reading of it Jesus does exactly that he makes physical contact with her and speaks the child to come forth now there's several instances in the ministry of Jesus Christ where he lays hands on the sick and they recover and the act of laying on of hands as brother bradam said it's a Jewish way of believing it um it is connected with um related to a Jewish tradition and this laying on of hands which is a sign that follows the commission right lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it's in this rabbinical custom it's something the Jews did it was something associated with their laws and the orders that they had under the Old Testament and I'd like to spend more time on this later but it's used in different ways to transfer a blessing or a gift to consecrate someone or even for someone to be identified the offered to be identified with the sacrifice and so there's physical contact made be identified with the sacrifice there's the time of consecration there had to be hands laid on and for the ordination uh hands being laid on or transfer of a gift or Divine uh a blessing you find even in the uh Joseph going to bless and the hands and being crossed in these different things there's hands to be laid on hands touched it's very Vivid in the scripture so gyrus is asking for Christ to come that his daughter may be healed so he believes in the power of God to heal his daughter believes in that he believes Christ has the power to heal his daughter but he believes and thinks that the laying on of hands is necessary or at least suggests so Master come my daughter's near death or my daughter is dead would you come and raise her from the dead H uh could have been what he he could have very easily said that but he specifically says come and lay your hands on my daughter she's at the point of death come lay hands on on her that she may be healed and live so he believed the actual physical laying on of hands was necessary for the daughter to be healed you catch that he believed in the power of God to heal his daughter but thought what needed to happen in the meantime is for the hands to be laid on in order for the power of God to be effective and I'm not meaning to put it in a way that sounds uh disrespectful but that is what he was wanting and in the same story we'll read it out of Matthew chap N9 he says well let's go let's go to Gus's house and in in Mark as you read the story there's a woman who had a blood issue and she was losing blood and she had a blood issue and she comes and it says behind the press and and so she kind of sneaks in and Away to just reach out and instead of asking like gyrus did a ruler of the synagogue come to my house lay hands on my daughter and she'll be well this woman now coming sees him believes in the power of God to heal and but sneaks in and press is in and with her particular need and her timidity her fear whatever it might be her consciousness of something she just wants to reach out and touch Christ to be healed and in Matthew Chap 9: 20-22 and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and touched the Hemm of His Garment in both instances gyrus wants Jesus to lay hands on his daughter so there's a point of contact now this woman makes contact with Christ garment says that I may touch his touch the Hemm of His Garment for she said within herself if I may but touch His Garment I Shall Behold now this is Faith Jus had Faith this uh this woman has Faith he says but Jesus turned him about but Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good Comfort now this is a word of endearment daughter acknowledging her faith being one of the Jews daughter be of good Comfort thy faith made thee whole and the woman was made whole from that hour you can read it in Mark 5: 24-34 and so Jesus now as he's been asked to go to gyrus his house to lay hands on the daughter to be healed a Woman intervenes by touching His Garment and virtue comes from him he perceives that he's been touched and in the press the disciples like what do you mean what's happened a a and he turns around and he recognizes this woman who had said within herself I think in Mark 5 she's a little bit worried when he says who touched me oh no and I in trouble but then she she made herself known and she said I Lord I'm the one that did it and he says daughter be of good Comfort thy faith hath made thee whole so it's faith that made her whole and we find that Gus's daughter is healed as well it would been an act of faith for him to ask Christ and it's an act of faith that she was healed now this is a very large statement that deserves a lot more um uh maybe more time than I'd like to than I'm able to give it today but these are instances of Christ as he says daughter be of good Comfort gyus being a ruler of the synagogue these are instances of the Messiah demonstrating his ministry to Those whom he was sent he was sent into his own the House of David sent to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and this was fulfilling the promise of a messiah to them and their promise was a physical Messiah that's what they were promised they were promised to Messiah so it was Abraham's seed after the flesh would receive a messiah in the physical flesh the Messiah would be in flesh he'd be a man he'd be a prophet he'd be a king he'd be a leader he'd be a deliverer he'd be a savior he was to be a physical sacrifice in the form of human flesh that's how the Messiah was promised to be revealed to the Jews and this is what I want you to think of this is that broad thought to the Jews everything is physical amen they have a physical Promised Land ours is a spiritual promised land they had a physical Messiah ours is the revealed word our mate right there there's certain things you begin to recognize that there's this visible tangible physical uh the seed of the Sands of the Earth the children after the flesh that's that's the seed that was promised to them right and this is just big this is summary language Jesus characterized their faith as little faith when he often spoke to him he said little faith several I think is uh four or five times just in the Book of Matthew um even in instances he said that they had no faith or um referred to their unbelief your unbelief or their unbelief in Mark chapter 6 this is in the chapter preceding these events of Gus's daughter and this woman says and he could do there no Mighty work this is where the Prophet is without honor in his own country he says sa that he laid his hands on a upon a few sick folk and healed them could do no Mighty work what he did is he laid his hands on a few sick people and they were healed and notice though there's some those there's some healings taking place he marveled because of their unbelief and he went round about the villages teaching he marveled at their unbelief this is these are the people who who believed in the Messiah and he's healing people and he's performing these signs and wonders in front of him and he says well I'm shocked how little faith they have or here he says their unbelief and so this these instances in these miracles in the ministry of Jesus Christ this is the manifestation of the Messiah to uh to the Jewish church at the end of their Church ages this is their Messiah their Capstone or their that that that Messiah to come at the capping time if I could put it this way and as he demonstrated these signs and wonders in their midst so that he could bring forth the faith because he's the one that introduced the faith to the church Christ is the one who introduces the faith to the church that that holds a type for us there's something in that for us in the sermon Christ is identified the same in all generations I think this is one of those sermons I referred to um last Sunday in um where brother brandham is saying that he wanted to preach unveiling of God he says we uh we we want the we're after the strength of the body of Christ he says um if you're getting nervous that I have multiple sets of notes up here that's fine he says in this sermon it's your faith in God that does the healing You Must Believe God and if you want to if you jot these things down you go back and read them you listen to the tape you'll find that after a while you find that I end up I'll end up quoting an entire two or three pages in a row just by visiting the different principle coming back to it and building the whole thought because it can be one paragraph that inspires me and so you can amplify one sentence with several other statements in scriptures and so there's statements before this and after this um that we're using says it's your faith in God that does the healing You Must Believe God and if you can touch him then nobody laid hands on you if you could touch him so I would say well then if he could be here I could touch him right if I could have Christ just as he was for this woman in Mark chapter 5 Matthew chapter 9 if he could be here then I'll Touch the Hem of His Garment and I'll believe that I can be healed but I don't have his physical garment here I don't even have that Corporal body here that physical flesh says if you can touch him then nobody laid hands on you it was your faith that touched him and your your faith brought the reality just prior to this and I want to use it in a future sermon brother BR was talking about how the reason why he wants this is it's easy for you to say oh brother so and so laid his hands on me and then like well I want brother so and so to lay hands on me right and uh I got to think of somebody who's a real good friend of mine so I don't get in trouble but if you all wanted brother Wayne Lawson to lay hands on you that would be awesome brother Wayne awesome right and and I have the confidence that you would be healed but there's a little bit of a detriment in that right I think the guy's booked up until the next decade okay and so if that's what you're waiting for here we might be waiting a while but brother brand identifies that as being problematic and brother Wayne is a very dear friend of mine so I feel like if he even knew I had a website with archives and he streamed this he'd be okay with it but that's the danger of being oh if I could just have brother brandom if I could just have brother or Roberts if I could just have brother Wayne awesome there then I know I would get healed and he and he's guarding against that so he's saying if your faith could touch him then nobody laid hands on you amen says it was your faith that touched him and your faith your faith brought the reality how encouraging is that you walk away realizing it was my faith that touched him it was my faith that brought the reality so then it wasn't no one touched you but you your faith touched him and so that brings real genuine testimony to him then right real genuine testimony to him then that's what we're here for to Magnify Him this is the real heart of the Prophet right here in the middle of April in Tampa 1964 uh brother Andrew your grandparents were there at those meetings sister marvar brother Ernest fure were there in those meetings brother Ernest I think was in the foury year going he hadn't went quite a Believer yet but he got there uh but it's um in this service he's saying what I want to do is Magnify Him I don't want to magnify myself he's using the language of John the Baptist I must decrease he must increase he must be elevated I I I don't want to have the preeminence and so brother bandam takes this this uh touching the Garment or this your faith reaching out and touching him as what we can do today but we know we can't be touching a physical Jesus but if he can declare his presence that he's here and we can by faith believe that he's here and then our faith Reach Out And Touch him then we have done something greater than what the woman in Matthew 99 did and so this greater Faith or this higher level of Faith this elevated Faith speaks to the bride's Faith at the end time amen which is what it means to have an elevated Faith right now in Matthew chapter 8 there's two instances in Matthew chapter 9 Mark chapter 5 where a Jew is looking to the physical presence of Christ and touch to be healed and what's remarkable is just prior to that these instances take place with both a man and a woman who are not Jews and in Matthew chapter 8 veres 5 to13 and when Jesus was entered into capernum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him so this would be a gentile this is not a Jew this is someone who's not a Believer saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of py grievously tormented and the and the other readings of this uh it would be that he sent he sent one to get Jesus and then he must have come on his own the way they rationalize with it is when Jesus said I'll come he must have realized oh he's coming let me go out and meet him and he says and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him so the he's coming Jesus ISS this is what he's used to right oh you need healing well I'll come I'll lay hands on them says the Centurion answered said Lord I'm not worthy thou should us come under my roof but speak the word only speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it in other words I recognize Authority when I see it I recognize a master in his domain when I see it I'm a centurion I'm I'm a leader I'm a ruler and I'm the one I'm the head within that Reign within that hierarchy and whatever I say goes and I recognize that you have that kind of power in a spiritual realm that all demons and everything is subject to you so he's saying look I know power when I see it so he believed in the power of God just like gyrus but now he believes it if I could say a little bit greater because he's like and I don't think hands are necessary because when I say something to my servants I don't need to lay hands on them there it is to get him to do it right so gives a difference to laying on of hands right God doesn't want to beat us into our healing he wants us to believe into our healing so he says I recognize that and then notice his response and I think if you look at this and what happens with gyrus and and the other tellings around this he says when Jesus heard it he marveled he's like whoa all right look at this guy he's marveling whoa and he said to them that followed he wanted everyone to catch this verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel the Israelites are the ones of the faith they were the faithful they were the Believers they believed in the one true God and here they all are they're part of the club right and this interloper who just happens to have a servant who was a a Jew is like can you come and heal my servant and very dear servant to him he goes yeah I'll come I'll pray for him and he says no no no no no you just need to speak the word I get it I I I've heard I know what's going on here just speak the word and Jesus turns to all the guys in the club right in the faith club and says I haven't seen so great a faith in all of Israel and like guy's a gentile and he calls it so great faith and I say unto you and this is he prophesies the coming in of the Gentile bride that many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob whoa the Patriarchs I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he invoked the the the their Holy Trinity he invoked something that was so significant to them that many will come reprobates uh Gentiles heathens as they may call them and sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom the Israelites the Jews those who of the natural Seed of Abraham shall be cast out into outer darkness and there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth he prophesies of the coming in of a gentile bride and Jesus said un the Centurion go thy way and as thou Hast believed so be it done unto thee it ended it it ended his journey it didn't matter to Jesus I you know I actually booked an Airbnb just right next to you that's a shame it's too late to cancel he's like that's fine it's over it's done as thou Hast believed what did he believe that at the word he would be healed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour because he spoke the word only holy and brother bradam I appreciate that brother that's exactly the truth and and the sermon Christ is identified the same in all generations we quoted from this just a moment ago and and let me catch a few statements at the beginning he says at the very beginning so this week the rest of the week let's put our faith up there like really Abraham's seed like we're supposed to be let's put our faith up there let's Elevate our faith to what Abraham seed ought to be let's believe God then we'll pray for the sick and doing everything we can to help alone amen let's put our faith up there like Abraham seed and we'll pray for the sick to help along he says this now my purpose in praying for the sick I'm going to talk about that now prayer for the sick purpose in praying for the sick I feel like you're all just right there with me so I'm loving how this is going today we don't try to say that's what we're here for one thing we're for what's that this one thing I seek after but praying for the sick is a minor you can never major with a minor so we enhan that quite a bit over the last two Services now in the next few paragraphs couple paragraphs he begins to describe or maybe it's just one paragraph how that a voice always follows the sign there's a sign given there's a voice that follows so he's really emphasizing I'm not just here for the healing I'm not here for the signs I'm not here for these things there's a message that I have there's one thing I'm here for the message and so I'm picking up now he says now what we try to do because this is the the purpose in praying for the sick what we try to do is to get the people to believe the Lord Jesus just to accept him without being hands laid on consider now consider this why why does he ask us why does he want this if laying on of hands would accomplish it why not do it why is he trying to elevate says now we know there's a scripture that says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and we don't try to belittle that scripture and neither should any of us right yeah because that was the commission Jesus Christ gave to the church to lay hands on the sick but if you'll bear with me that was more like a Jewish tradition and it's true and I don't think that belittles it at all or devalues it at all but it is was a Jewish tradition and that was adopted into Christianity remember the girl that was laying sick she died Gus's daughter he said come lay your hands upon my child and she will get well but the Roman Centurion a gentile just in the chapter prior said I'm not worthy that you come under my roof just speak the word and my servant will live and Jesus turned around and said I've never seen Faith like that in Israel the Gentile way is to believe him just absolutely believe him write that phrase down this is the bride's way and he says the Gentile way he's he's speaking of it in just the same way that you would have the elect out of of Israel the Gentile bride way the way that God wants his church to come to having been built on the proper Foundation he wants her to come to the peak and climax of Mount Zion to a place where she just believes him absolutely believes him says now we lay hands on the sick of course we do but we try to bring the reality that's the truth the althos the the by the scriptures of Jesus Christ being present that's by I want to bring the reality of him being present then when you by faith reach up and touch him yourself like the woman with the blood issue touched His Garment right that that's a as a Jew in that day you could have Christ come to your home and lay hands on your sick daughter your dead daughter and she could raise up or you could Reach Out And Touch the Hem of His Garment but the bride today can have access to a present Jesus Christ in by faith when she believes that he's here her faith can reach out and touch him just absolutely believe him this is what brother bam wants what I'm trying to do is to get the people to believe him and I'll skip absolutely believe him it's an absolute faith and Matthew Chapter 5 I believe we actually read this Wednesday night Behold a woman of Canaan in Mark chapter 7 it says this woman was a Greek a sarap phenician by Nation so in Mark chapter 7 she is identified as being a gentile a Greek s phenician a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter's grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word uh I mean this this goes down as racism or something right I mean on one hand look at look at the privilege gyrus gyrus has right a and the way that he treats this one comes hey my daughter's dying he's like hey sure butt I'll come over I'll lay my hands on him on her I I I'll pray for her and here comes another woman coming right begging or not begging but just say my daughter's vexed he won't he ignores her and his disciples came and beside him said send her away she crith after us and now they're trying to run interference and she's bugging them but he answered and said I am not sent but under the lost sheep of the House of Israel that's his answer then came and worshiped him saying Lord help me and let's watch the nature of Christ right but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs where when the woman that touched his h of His Garment daughter daughter I faith has saved thee another woman coming she's not pushing on him she's worshiping she's crying Lord help me and he says and he says I'm not sent unto the I am not but sent to the lost sheep of the House of Israel what's so amazing in the way that Christ acts he's hiding the mystery that this is actually the woman he sent to because what was the purpose he made the Earth to get a bride out of it what's the mystery of God what's the mystery of the Old Testament a gentile bride oh it's Israel it's Israel the mystery was a bride of his own choosing and here this woman is the type of it amen and he's hiding that mystery oh I'm not sent but to the law she of the House of Israel he's hiding the mystery that he comes back later and says oh there's going to be a time when people are going to come from east and west and and sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven one of them thinking kind of like that woman that you told to go away the other day yeah just like her and he says it's not meat to give it to cast it to dogs now let me just say this Jesus isn't operating by Prejudice he's not operating uh um under any perverted anointing he is demonstrating something he's doing what the father tells him his heart might have been moved to her and in his and his understanding of the mystery of God wanted to say behold one who types the Bride of the last days and he holds himself back and he's restraining himself to just heal her on the moment heal her on the spot she has a daughter that's vexed oh God heal her daughter he withholds himself withholds himself and she says it's not me he says it's not meat to cast it to dogs and she say truth Lord she knows truth when she hears it yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table and then Jesus answered and said in that moment he had release he had release for the love that he had for this woman oh woman great is thy faith he allowed this thing to unfold in a way where she could truly demonstrate the perseverant faith of the Bride of the last days where it seems as if he would holds it seems as if he's distant but she maintains her faith she absolutely believes him she didn't say oh well I heard wonderful things about you you're nothing but a misogynist you're nothing but a racist you're nothing but a a a narcissistic egomaniac she knew she believed she persevered says oh woman great is thy faith be it under thee even as thou Willl now to the woman who had the blood issue he said thy faith has made thee whole but now to this woman great greater is thy faith and her daughter was made whole from that very hour so we see it demonstrated in these two scriptures that Gentile Centurion at Thy word who believed he said I haven't seen so greater faith not not in all of Israel and his servant is healed the selfsame hour now on a gentile woman it acts to where all she does is she stands in his presence right he says woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt that's the third pull right be it unto thee even as thy Willl operating now on a woman who says that she knew what she wanted she wanted the Deliverance of her daughter the healing of her daughter I if you could um just uh pull on me please pull on me I want to get through this and the me the sign super the message super sign we don't need the prayer cards anyhow I've tried to get you away from that tradition always of laying hands on like the Jews did gyrus said come lay your hands on my daughter and she'll live the Romans said just speak the word that was the Gentile way of believing it not we're not belittling one we're not saying one isn't doesn't work but brother brandham as a prophet is wanting to push our focus on something not abandon Anything But realize that as the Old Testament blended into the new and as whatever Lane of hands accomplished let it do its work let it do its thing Let IT hand it off to take it to the Finish Line in the sermon the Good Shepherd of the sheep the American people are taught you got to lay hands on them was it Wednesday sometime recently maybe it was just in my reading and studying we B some of the Pentecostal people they desire it they desire the signs they desire the hands being they don't oh they love it they love the emotion they love this and so there's several instances where brother B talks about the American people need to be entertained they need a sign they need a miracle the American people are taught you got to lay hands on them and I guess you'll just have to do that that's all I know I'm trying to get you to believe it on a higher order to accept it without hands laid on you you just believe it walk away remember that phrase higher order is to accept it and believe it walk away to take God at his word and the sermon God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief if you could just take those two quotes in your mind kind of let them meld a little bit believe it on a higher order yes and this is uh I I cut a lot out here because I I wanted to be get to the point and not lose time and I'm running out of time says now to you stand in this prayer line to come down that line of discernment and he's wanting to understand hey this drains somebody this uh when I'm having to uh when this gift is being used that way Jesus saw one Vision he said I perceived that virtue is gone from me that strength is that right Visions you're in another world now he is here says do you stand in the prayer line do you that are standing pray to come through this line of discernment Christ is here right now hope you can pick Focus now with me Focus I know maybe it's hot it's Labor Day weekend we got a lot of things we want to labor in um but let's just focus here he says he's here that's him that touched you now it just only identifies that he's here with us the sign that's been demonstrated these things that are happening he's here with us now how many will believe if you'll just walk through this line let me pray and lay hands on you and you go back to your seat say now here's the sign being given now and brother man I'm lamented of this and as I was with Moses in those places that I'm I'm having to demonstrate this sign I want to get to the place where I just do the commission lay hands on them pray let them believe and walk away and not always work in this other realm so he said well how many will just believe if I lay hands on you he's them right I believe I believe like well then I'm just going to lay hands on you like anybody else can they're like h no tell me where I live right says do you believe if I pray for you here and then lay hands on you each of you will get well do you believe that was the Holy Spirit here it could just keep on doing it the the this line of discernment if you want to Forfeit that line and just keep on for some more why we'll do that see that's what if you want me to just keep doing the the sign we can keep doing that or and and bypass the line but he says see that's what the holy spirit is here it's just up to your thinking if it would make you believe more that's what brother brenham's after he wasn't trying to create a modality wherein we always have to do prayer lines and we always have to do certain signs always he just wants you to believe more at the end of the day we said last Sund whatever it takes Lord whatever it takes for us to believe that's my desire for our church for Arizona Believers Church is whatever it takes for the people to believe if it have to be gifts Lord if that's where we're at let it be but God let our faith rise let it grow let us believe more he says but many people have been taught lay hands on them the Bible said he sent his word and healed them so two different scriptures well that's what he did just now confirmed Med his word sent it to you confirmed it and it healed them talking about the very dynamics of that service the Jew said come lay hands on my daughter and she'll live the Romans said I'm not worthy you come under my roof just say the word that's what I'm trying to get you to believe you see there it is that's what I'm trying to get you to believe see what I'm trying to get you to believe is he's here his word is true if he's confirmed it with signs and wonders then we don't have to keep going back to him saying we'll do another one I I I had a whole I just basically if we want to have an evening service we could do it because I just had all a whole another sermon ready to preach on that particular aspect on the sign seeking and I it's like it almost what I what I want to look into is the feedback loop once that starts it's really hard to get out of it and and before you know it just become such a loud Echo chamber pretty soon nothing makes sense anymore says I'm trying to to get you to believe it trying to get you to believe I I'll if that's what you want it's up to your thinking if it would make you believe more I'll do what you need to believe more but hopefully there comes a point to where when you more believe right we move out of that cycle and our faith is elevated says I'm trying to get you to believe you see but if you want to be prayed for and hands laid upon you now I want every one of you to join with me in prayer as we pray for the people what Grace amen what beauty that's that's how God is for us you know we ought to have perfect Faith right but where does God meet us time and time again every day of our lives right there in our weakness of it he's not sitting there hands on hips going these message Believers right he meets us wherever we are he says by by now you ought to be teachers by now you ought to be you ought to be to the place to where you're you're overcoming this and you're overcome my this many years believing and you still struggle with that and he's like that's okay that's okay honey if that's what you need come on I'll meet you right where you are amen but he's trying to tell us the whole time remember this remember the process remember what I'm doing I'm always here with you so if you need me later you don't have to come back to this meeting you don't have to come back to this line you don't come back to these hands just remember who I am and when he finds you right in that same come on we can testify to this finds ourselves right back in that same place he's like is that what you need if you need hands laid on come on join with me in prayer but what he wants us to do is to believe him absolutely believe him he wants to make us believe more what's my purpose in praying for the sick right that's what we said earlier he says this Faith to get the people to believe just accept them to just absolutely believe him and he's using the example of this Centurian who takes him at his word versus gyrus who believed in the power of God but felt that it was absolutely necessary that hands be laid on same power to heal same Faith just an elevator Faith to take him at his word so he if you want hands laid on you then join me with prayers as we pray for the people now I could stop here and it would probably be a good stopping point that I may have to just cut some stuff out but Hebrews chapter 6 because this is going to be now the laying on of hands part and I want you to I want you to I want to share this I say want you to understand no that's not it I just want to encourage your faith in what you know how this Divine Healing relates to rapturing Faith he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works these are foundational things you can't get rid of the foundational things and of Faith toward God you can't get rid of that of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment so these are fundamental principles of our faith he says and this we will do if God will allow if God will permit oh let's move Beyond this laying in the foundation oh and we'll do it if God will permit and when we looked at this last week we saw how Paul was talking about a maturing Faith an elevated Faith a perfect faith we talked about brother said brother talked about we're coming now to the Perfection because the people have to come to this in order for the Rapture that's what's holding it away now is for the church to come into that perfect raptured Faith that's what Paul is talking about leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ and not laying in the foundation of those things let us go on into tell otaste the perfector Christ has introduced this foundational Faith now with this here behold Mount Zion let's go to the climax of Mount Zion let's let's Ascend to the Pinnacle let's apprehend as we are apprehended let me strive let me uh let me press towards the mark for the prize let let me do all these things looking into that perfect when that which is perfect has come these are the things that Paul is lifting up in this very moment uh these are the things that are standing before him when he says that's not nay these principles are down anymore and so let's let's go on to Perfection now a lot of this is tying back to where we were last week in the sermon the sign of this time I want to read a statement uh where brother talking about what what where we are today is into this Perfection and and just prior to this statement we're going to read he says the church has come through the score of the church ages after the first Ephesian Church age and if the Lord willing before I leave here I want to preach on a little subject called the countdown and see how we've come how we've progressed okay in the message the countdown hopefully we'll come to it and he says in a moment later before I come to the statement he says now we've left the Pentecostal age now we're coming to we like the pyramid we're coming not pyramid doctor says but it's the Capstone right so he talking about the three elements he says if Christ died there was three elements that came from his body water blood spirit these are the same elements of the birth right justification through believing water sanctification through the blood the baptism Holy Spirit there's your three steps now this last great step must come into the Perfection so there's your your Wesley or Luther Wesley Pentecost the full New Birth now born maturing to Perfection and he says this last great step this is where we are today this last great step must come to Perfection this is how it's described that the Holy Spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it makes the head in the body unite together that's where we are now the last great step is the holy spirit living perfectly within your life the message who is this mzc first justification like Luther preached second sanctification like Wesley preached third baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the Pentecostal age that's me injecting that about the Pentecostal AG third baptism the Holy Ghost that's right then comes the rapture this last great step then comes the Rapture that's what we're what the what the season we're in the seventh seal the kingdom of God is coming talking about the strange part of this week and people being healed the kingdom of God is coming and it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it has been the king go is becoming more positive than it's ever been now that ought to choke people from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then here justification sanctification Bap the Holy Ghost now some people want to make that the dispensational end right he says and then here amen right oh that's so good then here he says we're just drawn closer to God all the time listen to this question can't you see Methodist ministers how your message of sanctification was above that which Luther preached remember he said he wants to preach countdown before he leaves he says can't above what Luther preach you Pentecostals can't you see your message of baptism is beyond what the Methodist preached so then what about his message wouldn't it Beyond be beyond the Pentecostal message B bramman the Masterpiece mentions how the baptism Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down into Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself it's made way for I think I don't know if I have the statement here says now the entire Holy Ghost visits the church now that could be confusing for some people but it has to do with purpose dispensation on and these first principles that Paul talks about he says we have these principles of the doctrine of Christ and the foundations and he says let us go on these things I you can say these things are perfect in themselves right as far as what they are but they're part of something else let us go on onto Perfection I kind of want to do it this way in a linear way but it's the it let us go on into Perfection staying within that foundation and so these first principles these things that Paul talks about are the building blocks from which elevated Faith arises it's how you get perfect Faith you're never going to get perfect Faith by building on another Foundation Paul talking about this body in Ephesians 2:20 says we are built on the doctrine of the Apostles the foundation rather the foundation of the doctor of the Apostles and Prophets it's part of the faith it's part of the building these things but as we mentioned last time in Hebrews 69 I'm persuaded better things of you better things it's greater things perfect things right better things so he comes later in Hebrews chap 11 he says and these all having obtained a good report through faith by Faith by Faith by Faith by faith but he says they tamed a good report through faith received not the promise right they had Faith but didn't receive the promise God having provided some better thing for us amen Paul said I'm persuaded better things of you now he's saying for these Jews God having provided some better things with for us that they without us should should not be made perfect now it has a beautiful imagery to the G the Jewish Church beautiful imagery to the Jews and at the the the very beginning of the Christian church and this this what he says here that they God has provided a better some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect it holds a prophetic type for the Gentile bride holds a dispensational truth to us and to the church ages I know I'm going quick here and I kind of like how this is working out I'm not going to be long today says in the Statue of a perfect man he says those who died in here are depending and waiting on us this is him coming now at the very end of the Le Dean age and he's saying we've had all these Believers die and he's identifying them waiting under the altar he says the church has to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection all right so you want to know what's holding it away now we is right cuz the church has to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection it's not your perfect auntie that's going to bring the resurrection as she comes up out of the grave and we have this this uh theological 30-day period or so or so where we're going to be fellowshipping with our uh dead loved ones who've resurrected and that's going to kind of give us rapturing Faith but he's saying we've got to be perfect in order to bring the resurrection there under the souls under the altar waiting for the church to come to its Perfection here's that statement I was referring to a moment ago in desperations every age has followed that to see that it's brought forth and they could not be made perfect without us so he's identifying an element of this scripture to our day a a compound fulfillment as Paul was speaking to them all these Believers in Christ and the Seed of Abraham were waiting for that for Christ to come and it redeemed the whole lot of them so now there's going to be a gentile Church age that when it reaches its climax it draws the rest of them from the grave and the on the Rapture cuz you remember Paradise emptied out and there was a faith that came that made the rest of them perfect he says this now and now he says is they could not be made perfect without us and now the entire Holy Spirit visits the church making God in human flesh and that's just a mouthful entire Holy Spirit visits the church he's identifying something dispensation different with our age from the Pentecostal Age The Bride age from the leot to seen age he says and all the things that he hasn't done down through the ages in the same message in the church ages he's do is now doing back to the word because the messages and the messages and the messages have to wind up in the entire word amen and in the last days the Seven Seals being open we're to pick up every straggle that's been left off in it and make the whole thing in one great big body of the Bride that them who Liv back there were not perfect until this church be perfected this bride group in the last days to bring them in and all together be taken up so when Paul is saying let us go on to Perfection God having provided some better thing for us that they without them uh they without us should not be made perfect now think of what that means for us everything God has established in the ages in the first church restored that Satan taken away everything that is true in this Bible everything as it relates to Jesus Christ there is the ultimate to Redemption there is the change of this body there is listen there's not until you defeat death and it can be said that death is swelled up in Victory so despite the resurrection of Jesus Christ the full climax of his victory and the full proof that he paid the price and rose again is when you put the Last Enemy under your [Applause] feet and he says that's when this church is perfected so it's this last great step is on into Perfection and we got to take the doctrines of baptism laying on the hands build this all part of our foundation but then we got to take that last step into Perfection now I haven't I haven't changed the subject but now I hope you could you can make this connection of what brother brandham is wanting I just want you to believe him I want you to believe without hands being laid on just simply believe the presence of the Lord is here here to heal the sick and take them at his word and all the greater Faith the bride's faith and elevated faith and and if I could just say this I'll just cut to my uh the last statement I was going to want to refer to brother say just take him in his word just believe him just believe him that's what I want you to do is just believe him without hands being L I just want you to believe him wherever you are just take him his word and just believe him and then we realize we're at a time when our bodies are going to be changed and brother Bradman and God hide him himself in Simplicity says God just speaks and the Rapture will come [Music] amen and even as I was thinking of it this morning that this Faith he's wanting to build up inside of us it's to believe it's to absolutely believe him so that the impossible can be done and he's got to bring that up in order for the change in order for us to be perfected now in 1 Corinthians 12: 4-1 11 I just want you I want to read it I'm not going to amplify it I just want you to read it so you could recognize the diversities the differences and the manifestations of gifts Spirit administrations operations all by The Same Spirit now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operation but it's the same God work which worketh all in all and the trinitarian said I kind of like the way he wrote that but it's diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit differences of administrations but the same Lord diversities of operations but the same God it's all the same right but the gifts administrations and operations are all different but there can be different administrations of the Lord different dis diversities of the gifts of the Spirit different operations but it's all the same God verse 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all and these gifts that are given it when they're given the manifestation of spirit is given to profit others right for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles another Pro to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the self Same Spirit dividing every man severly as he will so when brother BR says the entire Holy Ghost visits the church it's always been the Holy Ghost but there's an Administration there's an operation there's something he's wanting to do in the end time and that's what makes things different right you say well is it a different Jesus is a different Christ and he was always in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks through the church ages so is it the same Christ what happened well we find at the End of the Age he's kicked out knocking trying to get back in and when he does it's not just to start the cycle all over again it's for the Rapture but there's diversities of gifts differences of administrations diversities of operations I can share with you a number of different statements to substantiate this but every Church age has had Miracles every Church age from the book of Acts all the way to the time we're living in right now there's always been miracles signs wonders and gifts it's always been in the church it's always been within Christianity in every age brother R said every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the believer in every age Believers have been sealed had received the true seal which is the New Birth the true seal of God Amen and been B by one Spirit baptized in the body of Christ so when we come to this the bride age and I I'm not using air quotes to belittle it because it's something very precious to me that's been demeaned I believe or misunderstood but we come to the bride age it's not oh now people are finally getting the real seal of God and it's not oh now the real righteous partaking of the gifts is going to take place no that the only chain if we did haven't had it in any church age we're frauds because the chain of evidence has been broken the chain of custody has been broken Jesus said go into all the world and teaching them whatsoever things teaching to obey whatsoever things I commanded you and the beauty of the Gospel is there's an unbroken chain back to that moment from Faith to Faith this is the way it works and so it's not like we're all of a sudden just arising out of a vacuum no there's always been in every age signs mirales wonders healings manifestations of the spirit and believers who are filled with the Holy Ghost and and was Sunday we mentioned that's the statement I remember I knew I grabbed these for a reason because I want to preach it again it was uh brother brandham saying that God the message of repentance to the church nominal and the message of Divine Healing to the church Pentecostal it's the message of Divine Healing is to the church Pentecostal and I haven't had the opportunity to check and verify but I have I have witnessed by by Miracle the internet Pentecostal ministers testifying to thousands of healings thousands cancers falling off dead raised crippled being healed limbs being extended deaf ears opening you name it I've heard a Pentecost Minister testified different ones multiple ones again it's the beauty of of YouTube you can you can listen to tens of thousands of hours and watch tens of thousand hours of Pentecostal services and you say how do you know well it's the 10,000 hour requirement I'm an expert on Pentecostalism now you can watch it and it's happening and I would say be very careful to say no it's not happening cuz my God's A Healer my God's a deliverer my God can c cancer to fall off my God can straighten out limbs we've heard enough to believe that my God can raise the dead if somebody says that God raised the dead they go well what church do you go to no I just say what God were you praying to who were you believing in my God raises the dead and if somebody testifies to you at work this week on next Thursday morning says I had a cancer fall off in church this past Sunday don't ask what denomination they're in just say that's my God that's what my God does I'm a Believer I believe in the those things yes sir come on you believe it good and so that's the message uh that that's that's with it's part of our part of our faith if you start if you don't believe in Divine Healing anymore just wait till I finish this up here soon you're in trouble now when brother brandham said I want to preach on the little subject the countdown see how we've progressed he says we've left the Pentecostal age and he say this last great step must come into the Perfection this is connected with that those countdown principles he wanted to preach on and in the message the countdown he refers to the Pentecostal age as the airplane age and he says they took off they left the Earth with tongues and he says great gifts of healing genuine real he says had healings and sicknesses being healed cripples healed blind had their sight restored to them what was it the power of God had left the Earth it's moving in his church in that later scen age with signs and wonders and miracles all taking place and brother Chris kaval in the couple Services he's preached for us has taken this thought of what was happening in the natural with the astronauts and these certain things and at the very same time because it's it's the principal brother bram's drawn from and I'm not trying to steal your thunder before the next time it's the very principal brother bram's drawn from says look look at our John Glenn look at where we've come at the open of the word and at the very same time man is leaving Earth's atmosphere no longer in a jet ship and he's talking about that this there's something that's happened and so this these things are he's typing these things out in the church age and even the the scientific advancements and in the airplane age everything that was happening in the church in Paul's day was taking place in the airplane age it was the it was the signs wonders Miracles at Pentecost the the uh restoration of the gifts baptism in Jesus name but elevated Faith goes beyond this right to elevate it actually in the uh it comes for L and Lavar which means to lighten or and the the Lavar is conjugated from levice which means to be light in weight elevated it's to to lighten brother talking about why you packing up right lighten yourself and what he's preaching the SE the first seal he's referring to the Seven Seals being open he's referring to Revelations 10 he's talking about the church needing something he says there's something in there that we just can't lighten oursel with and I never understood it until I caught this elevated part is to lighten yourself there's something something going to come under the open of the word to elevate us to lighten ourselves with it's your faith that touch to elevate ourselves with Bill Brandman the sermon countdown now but now friends may I say this remember what the airplane age is the horse and buggy the advancements the advancements the airplane age he says it's come to the age of the astronaut we've moved out of this airplane age we got more power astronaut age has come in what is it we've come into a spiritual age of the astronaut going above he says it's not and I not sure what he was going to say but he says it's the same Spirit only more power so there's no man boo boo right to the Pentecostals they have their measure they have their portion but he says it's the same Spirit only more power only lifted higher can go higher see more believe more be more like Christ that's good there's there's if you ever have triplet you can have see more believe more and be more go higher see more believe more be more like Christ not the automobile not the horse and buggy not even the airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on and above each one taking the power that they had and if it because says improving on it catching the real thought behind it there's some sort of propulsion that makes this go there's some sort of power and we can duplicate this power uh through this propulsion and if we have more of it and we get more aerodynamic and we learn from these things then we can actually get off the ground and they just Advance the same thing evolving and material iiz into something greater above each one it's the same power though it's a part I really don't want you to I I don't want you to miss that same power if you say that Pentecost didn't have power then what are we left with and it can this is now at the end of the sermon he's praying father count down now father so many things that could be said right here maybe the church wouldn't understand but I pray that you'll give them such a crave for it I love that yes you give them such a crave for it Lord that they'll come and see we're at the end time the astronaut AG not now as Paul think about what Paul said now if you're going to desire gifts you're going to Crave for going to desire desire the perfect desire charity he speaks that crave and Paul knows how to orient him Paul knows how to focus him because when that which is perfect has come he if you if you seek that which is perfect he says when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part is done away with if you only want the part you can have that but you won't have the perfect but if you get the perfect you got the parts if you get the perfect the parts are in it he says get a crave let this work work in your heart I'm almost finished here let that work in Your Heart Lord I want to Crave this he says I pray father that th'll realize that isn't trying to condemn what they had this may maybe where maybe even as a minister I've may you I could make that mistake of using some of these statements and quotes to come across as if condemning what somebody else has or what this church had or what this age had he says we're not trying to condemn what they had it's only trying to give them more rapturing grace and this is what you ought to Crave for more rapturing grace he's showing these things of the airplane in the Pentecostal age and Allen Ash on age which would be a bride age he's showing that the eagle ages he refers to it he says it's to give them more rapture Grace for the hour will come when we will have to have Rapture power not only to heal the body but to change it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Christ will be so real into their bodies till he can change it by his great death in what he purchased is it not by his great death in what he purchased that we receive our Divine Healing amen and he says we're going to have to have power not just to heal the body but to change it Christ can be so real into our bodies so real into our bodies as he tried to find that statement we read a moment ago where he says that that is this Christ is going to work within his church and move so perfectly in the church to till we raise the dead and we go in the resurrection he says Christ will be so real into their bodies till he can change it by what he purchased is he referred to this in the countdown it's Atomic power he says a greater power that presses him so much higher than an airplane how much greater is the astronaut from the old horsepower automobile power and the airplane power it's something that presses him so much higher it elevates him so much higher and that's where brother bandam want wants us to get you can't stay in an airplane age if you stay in that age you're always Earthbound you're always held within its atmosphere but I want you to believe him absolutely believe him because we're Liv in the time and the hour where a bride has to pierce through that atmospheric Veil and go into the air to meet him you'll have to have Rapture power and he says not only do heal the body to change it and what has he done Rapture power and he puts heal the body you have to have Rapture power not only to heal it but to change it why because Divine Healing is relevant to elevated faith Divine Healing is relevant to the perect perfect Faith the rapturing faith I'm only trying to give you more rapturing grace and how is he trying to give them rapturing Grace by showing them how we've progressed he doesn't say oh the horse and buggy it's a myth have you ever seen a horse and buggy anybody here ever actually seen a horse and buggy raise your hand if you've never seen a horse and buggy yeah how do you how do you even know they're real how do you know that we all just haven't got together and said let's make sister Nicole believe that there's actually horse and Buggies right Birds aren't real right the Earth is flat nice what was I talking about brother bam is not wanting them to doubt the horse and buggy the automobile the airplane he wants them to see that if the Same Spirit can cause do what he did in the horse and buggy age and then grow to an automobile age and then grow to an airplane age then the Same Spirit can do things in me that are necessary for the time that I'm living in and he can reveal it in the time that I need it and you could see the power of God grow and grow and grow he just doesn't wake us out of bed and say oh I'm drunk I'm hung over you got to change your body buddy there's a Rapture coming I'm trying no he takes you from birth to maturity Faith to perfect faith and Divine Healing is that very symbol of the change of our body remember the son of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings brother B said it's not the physical healing you're thinking of his spoken word will be Vindicated when the son of righteousness shall rise with heal in his wings in the healing part there this is Malachi 4's ministry will not be a physical healing as you think as somebody's got a sickness and it'll be taken away from him that's what he's doing now in type so when he's doing that now in type he's pointing to what it really means when the son of righteous will arise with healing in his wings I let me put it this way if just for you understand the greatest healing is when you get a body that never needs to be healed again right you know and someone says there I fixed it and it gets broke again and you said it broke again well I fixed it I just got to fix it again that's what Divine Healing is all about you're broke it gets fixed it's going to get broke again but when the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings you're you have a body that is never going to get sick never get never lose its hair never get inflamation right never get tired never get bent over never get weak I'm I haven't even mentioned a sickness yet have we changed the song there'll be no Co there we are going to see the King right there be no social distancing there I need the organ and the healing part will not be a physical healing as you think CU somebody has got sickness that it's taken away from him that's what he's doing now in type but the whole creature will be changed every time somebody heal is healed you remember the whole creature is going to be changed let it be the testimony in this church whenever someone testifies that God healed them let it be a reminder the whole thing is going to be changed I know it's really hard to imagine but really in an in alternate dimension in just mere Dimension we're all about 18 to 21 years old and this is a youth service the meeting there is going to look like a youth camp etern we're all going to be young again I'm going to look like Elliott Glory that's that's what every healing ought to testify to you the whole thing's going to change if somebody has a a a a back that has been out thrown out and it's healed they have a surgery and God comes along and heals it cancer sickness disease whatever it is let's say that's the evidence that there's a change coming let it testify that he's here and he's building rapturing faith in this church the whole creature will be changed this Mortal will take on immortality this old age will jump into youth this old age will jump into youth that's what it means when you you have a headache and you pray and it's gone this old age is going to jump into youth when you have something swollen you pray for it God heals it this old age is going to jump into you when somebody has blood test done they have all sorts of negative results from the blood test the doctors are concerned they need to do a scan they do the scan they look into it no there's nothing wrong your blood's completely clear there's a new blood coming there's a new body coming it's testifying every day of a whole change of our creature brother brandom says in 10 virgins but Divine Healing has more to it than just Divine Healing Divine Healing is a miracle of God it's God divinely remedying an ailment or a sickness or an Affliction in someone's spirit or body and when that happens he says there's actually more to it than that we think oh well I had a broken limb and it was restored or I had a something uh missing and it come grows back I had a cancer F he said no no no no that may be what you see but there's more to it he says Divine Healing only says there's a God who's coming again there's only a god who's going to be so real into the bride's body that it'll change it there's only a god who's going to be so one and uniting with the church it only testifies to a god who's here now and the bride coming to Christ to be so real to bring up a resurrection it only testifies there's a God coming again what does Divine Healing speak of it's the earnest of our Resurrection if there's no Divine Healing there is no Resurrection that's exactly what these things are to do is to remind us we're not here for this life on this body has a natural trajectory that when you ought to get when you get sick it ought just to lead to another one to another one to another one to a grave and when the body is bit down and get sick and God comes along and picks you up when need Elevate you out of that sickness that ought to remind you that this body is not going to go down to a grave but one day it's going to step right up into a resurrection because that's exactly what Divine Healing speaks of is a change of the whole [Applause] [Music] body and if I could end on this thought then if that's what Divine Healing types then our approach to it and our understanding of it will improve our approach to the body change right if if it's a type of the change of our body then our understanding of it and our approach to it will improve our approach to the Rapture because if I had my choice right now the Lord said now brother Aaron you could either be healed of these things for the rest of your life are you go in the Rapture and I me you're you're messing with me right have I been so long with you that you don't really know what my heart's cry is Lord but if I had the choice i' say you can give me whatever you want I'll take the Rapture that's what I want and then he says well Divine Healing is going to help you understand how to get there right good because it's a type brother random in the sermon go awake Jesus he's he's at the very end of the sermon he's talking about Just Surrender he may have been singing I Surrender Just Surrender to him yield these people who are being healed and sick Desiring their heal and he says everything is surrendered I'm no more my own thinking this is this is Rapture thinking I ain't going to think like I'd think Lord I'm going to think like you think and you promised that I was healed I think that other words I'm I'm going think I'm Healed I Surrender my thinking I won't more think I won't I won't no more think about my sickness I won't think about that disease I had I ain't thinking about nothing but thinking what you said and I know you've heard this statement before but watch how he puts this this beautiful poetry now now right out in front of you stands a person just like you were a few minutes ago he says you were sick down here but there's a well person standing there now however you want to look at that in in this this schema if you were to draw it out there's maybe just different ways you could look at it and draw it out but here he's saying there's a person just like you so here you are you're standing there says you were sick down there and he says there's a well person standing there Jesus Christ is calling to that well person right Beyond it now the way that it's often struck me is that you have somebody who is down here and just a little bit higher as a well body and Jesus Christ is a little bit higher on the other side of that wellbody calling to it amen that there's you're sick and a little bit higher as a wellbody but Christ is on the other side of it calling you to it and so this is this is for Divine Healing but think about this language and how it applies to our body change Jesus Christ is calling to that well person right Beyond it now you just by faith as You Close Your Eyes walk right into that well body then just keep on walking just keep on going I surrender all I can with my eyes I'm closing off anything when I close my eyes it's all these other senses that would speak contrary to this faith that is inside of me and I'm going to walk into that well body and just as I can walk into a well body and receive Divine Healing it's going to be that faith that becomes an elevated Faith to step right into a union with Jesus Christ and ultimately a meeting in the air Hallelujah Jesus Christ is calling and that's why you want to step into he says just keep on walking higher and higher and higher brother brandom that's what he wanted us to do is he wanted us just to take it and to believe it and just walk with it amen keep walking in it I probably should have highlighted those you remember what he said you don't okay he says just keep walking in it believe it on a higher order is to accept it without hands being laid on you you just believe it and walk away and with each step you rise higher each step amen with each step not falling back down again and repeating the cycle but each step going higher the this is this is talking about practice the Practical practice of our faith as we're pursuing this Perfection this is what it is that I have moments I have opportunities to exercise my faith because I I am I am believing this is my testimony as a Believer I believe that I will not die or that if I do die this body will be changed that I will not forever remain in a grave but that I my I will enter into dimension of waiting Saints waiting for the church to be perfected and I will enter into a theophany body but there will be a moment and a time when you will conquer death and at that moment I will come back to get my glorified body yours will be change and you'll meet your theophany and we believe we're actually going to meet in the air there's going to be a meeting we believe that that takes faith that takes rapturing Faith some of us don't even have enough Faith to make it to church right but we're going to make it to a meeting in the air and that's why we have church is to God for God to meet us time and time again wherever we are in whatever weaknesses we have whatever difficulties we're having to grow us to build us to that place we could just keep taking steps higher but it's a practical practice of your faith going to church paying ties taking uh communion washing one another's feet praying for one another all the different ways we have opportuni one serve one another it's the growing of this faith and there's your image of Divine Healing a well body you're sick there's a well body Jesus Christ is calling just beyond it by faith I'm going to step into that so your approach to being healed helps you in your approach to being changed that's my that was my thesis that was my point today the message influence brother says and God is sending gifts to try to create in us a faith that'll move us out of here someday into a Rapture Healing The Sick Open the Eyes of the blind raising up the dead why to create in us a faith that we can move out of here he's not doing these things so it can make it more comfortable for us to stay but he's doing it so we can grow our faith Elevate our faith to leave here now in this Healing The Sick musician the feet come Healing The Sick opening the eyes of the blind rais up the dead we know you can't major on these things but the major the major Christ the word can place these things and make them Stepping Stones Amen to elevate our faith amen God bless you thank you for your attention today elevated faith I think it's a beautiful thought let's stand
