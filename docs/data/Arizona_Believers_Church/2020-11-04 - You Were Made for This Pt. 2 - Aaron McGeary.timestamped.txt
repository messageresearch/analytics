[0:00] christ we pray amen amen
[0:03] i'd like to read from second corinthians
[0:04] chapter 1
[0:06] verses 3 to 11. second corinthians
[0:09] chapter 1.
[0:10] we'll start with verse 3 and we'll go to
[0:14] to verse 11.
[0:20] and we're going to try pick up where we
[0:22] were
[0:23] on sunday when we stopped i felt a
[0:26] little bit empty because we had
[0:29] maybe just shared about half of what was
[0:30] on our heart on sunday and then
[0:33] we just felt like it was the lord's will
[0:35] that we could pick up on these things
[0:37] and go a little bit further into it
[0:40] and trust it'll be a blessing to you as
[0:42] of right now i didn't check in the last
[0:45] couple hours or so but as of right now
[0:46] we
[0:47] we don't know who the next president
[0:48] will be and uh depending on who you ask
[0:51] um we just uh it's just remarkable how
[0:55] god does things
[0:57] and how god's in control of all things
[0:58] and i feel that the lord allowed
[1:01] the last 24 hours to unfold in probably
[1:03] the most reasonable peaceful way
[1:05] possible
[1:07] because it's too early for anybody to do
[1:08] anything and it'll probably just drag
[1:10] itself on in the courts for three months
[1:12] and by then any gander that was up any
[1:15] adrenaline any anger just everyone will
[1:17] be
[1:17] projecting it somewhere else and we
[1:19] might be able to transition either into
[1:21] a
[1:21] second term for president trump or into
[1:24] a
[1:24] first term and a transition to a new
[1:27] administration with uh
[1:28] joe biden but either way we are in god's
[1:32] care
[1:33] and either way regardless of what who
[1:36] the president is we
[1:37] we are represented we are identified
[1:40] with america as americans
[1:42] and so we we bear it shame we bear the
[1:44] reproach of it whatever it might be
[1:46] we just have to accept it uh but i think
[1:49] the
[1:50] what's transpired over the last 24 hours
[1:52] has actually been quite pleasing in
[1:53] terms
[1:54] of the way a lot of people thought
[1:55] things would go but we want to continue
[1:58] to
[1:58] discuss the elephant in the room the
[2:00] donkey in the room as we mentioned
[2:01] sunday
[2:02] but looking at this subject of you were
[2:04] made for this
[2:05] whatever's to come whatever the future
[2:07] holds we're not afraid of it because we
[2:08] know who holds our future
[2:10] first corinth second corinthians rather
[2:12] second corinthians chapter one verse
[2:13] three
[2:14] blessed be god even the father of our
[2:15] lord jesus christ the father of mercies
[2:18] the god of all comfort who comforted us
[2:21] in all our tribulation who comforts us
[2:23] think of that comforteth
[2:24] us in all our tribulation that we may be
[2:27] able to comfort them which are in any
[2:29] trouble
[2:30] by the comfort wherewith we ourselves
[2:32] are comforted of god so we are comforted
[2:34] in tribulation
[2:35] being comforted in tribulation we're
[2:37] able to comfort them also who are in
[2:39] trouble
[2:40] by the comfort wherewith we ourselves
[2:42] are comforted of god oh just what a
[2:44] beautiful
[2:44] beautiful sentence it says for as the
[2:47] sufferings of christ abound in
[2:49] us so our consolation also aboundeth by
[2:51] christ
[2:52] and whether we be afflicted it is for
[2:54] your consolation and salvation
[2:56] which is effectual in the enduring of
[2:58] the same sufferings
[2:59] which we also suffer and whether we be
[3:02] comforted it is for your consolation and
[3:04] salvation
[3:05] paul recognizing a purpose through his
[3:06] comfort or through his suffering
[3:08] he realizes god is going to accomplish
[3:10] something for the believer's sake
[3:12] and our hope of you is steadfast knowing
[3:15] that as your partakers of the sufferings
[3:17] so shall you also be also of the
[3:19] consolation
[3:21] for when we and that's just a comfort to
[3:24] us that if we partake in suffering
[3:26] there's also consolation
[3:27] that's joined with it for we would not
[3:29] brethren have you ignorant of our
[3:31] trouble which came to us in asia
[3:33] that we were pressed out of measure
[3:35] above strength in so much that we
[3:37] despaired
[3:38] even of life but we had the sentence of
[3:41] death in ourselves
[3:42] that we should not trust in ourselves
[3:44] but in a god who raiseth the dead
[3:47] who delivered us from so great at death
[3:49] and doth deliver us
[3:50] in whom we trust that he will yet
[3:53] deliver us
[3:54] ye also helping together by prayer for
[3:57] us so this is what's joined even with
[3:59] the deliverance of god
[4:00] you helped by praying that for the gift
[4:03] bestowed upon us by the means of many
[4:04] persons thanks may be given by many
[4:07] on our behalf amen you may be seated
[4:11] as i mentioned we're going to continue
[4:12] on the subject
[4:14] of you were made for this and
[4:17] i'm going to start by reading again just
[4:20] making reference very quickly to
[4:21] the quote we read in 1 in a million
[4:24] and brother braham says the time and the
[4:26] hour that we're living if a person don't
[4:28] know which way to go
[4:30] what to do or how to turn you're not
[4:32] walking by faith anymore you're just
[4:35] guessing you are presuming and presume
[4:38] is to advance without official authority
[4:40] and so there's as christians we don't
[4:43] ever want to advance without official
[4:45] authority
[4:46] assume presume here as he says presume
[4:48] is to go forward
[4:50] to do something to act without actually
[4:52] having the authority to do so
[4:54] he says so if we haven't got the real
[4:56] official authority to know what god has
[4:58] said would take place in this hour
[5:00] how are we ever going to face this hour
[5:03] so if we're going to face this hour
[5:04] then god's going to give us a word and
[5:06] authority that we can rely upon
[5:08] to face it and i believe that holds true
[5:11] if there's going to be a challenge if
[5:12] there's going to be a difficulty that
[5:13] the bride
[5:14] collectively is going to face and
[5:16] something some trial some tribulation
[5:19] that we're going to have to endure for
[5:20] his sake then we are
[5:23] if it's if we need the faith to face it
[5:25] if it's not in the word already if
[5:27] there's something extra that we need
[5:29] then he's going to give us the real
[5:30] official authority
[5:31] to know how to face this hour and we've
[5:34] got to face it knowing by faith in his
[5:36] word the things that's supposed to be
[5:38] happening now
[5:39] the condition of the nations condition
[5:40] of the people the condition of the
[5:42] church and so forth
[5:43] we've got to know that and then how to
[5:46] walk out to face it
[5:47] and if you don't know how to do that
[5:49] you're just what we used to call kind of
[5:51] haphazardly just jumping in hoping it
[5:53] would be there
[5:54] hoping this and hoping that will it be
[5:57] but
[5:58] god wants us to do that he wants us to
[6:00] god don't want us to do that
[6:02] he wants us to know what he has said
[6:04] about this day
[6:06] and then meet it by faith because he
[6:08] said it would be that way
[6:10] that's the part i really want to focus
[6:12] on he wants us to know
[6:13] what he has said about this day and then
[6:16] meet it by faith because he said it
[6:17] would
[6:18] be that way so in order for us to go
[6:21] forward as believers
[6:22] we need to advance with official
[6:23] authority we need to know what god has
[6:25] said about something
[6:27] not just guesswork not just well i think
[6:29] it might be and could it be
[6:30] but we want to know exactly what god has
[6:32] said about something
[6:34] and as we mentioned on sunday this is a
[6:36] time of great uncertainty
[6:37] there's a lot of instability and we see
[6:39] this in politics we see this in
[6:41] economics
[6:42] we see this in our social structures
[6:44] that there's a lot of
[6:45] uncertainty and instability and with
[6:48] that
[6:49] we want to find stability we want to
[6:51] give meaning to things we want things to
[6:53] have order and we want to be able to
[6:54] place things in certain ways that we can
[6:56] understand what's taking place and
[6:58] this means that and this means this and
[7:00] this is where it's going and maybe one
[7:02] of the biggest things that afflicts us
[7:04] is the fear of the unknown
[7:06] and they call that actually the the
[7:08] fundamental fear the fear of the unknown
[7:10] it's the
[7:11] fear of to rule them all as they say the
[7:13] fear of their own is probably the
[7:15] greatest fear in it
[7:16] instigates anxiety and it causes us to
[7:18] speculate
[7:19] and to guess and so that may be the
[7:21] biggest thing
[7:22] that uh hangs over us this is just as
[7:25] humans
[7:25] is not knowing what's going to happen it
[7:27] could go this way it could go that way
[7:29] and as we pointed out on sunday and i'm
[7:32] just sharing these things in the outset
[7:33] with a lot of review
[7:34] when we join these spheres with the word
[7:37] by presuming as braham says
[7:39] it makes the fear worse because we see
[7:42] something happening we're not sure
[7:43] what's going to happen we try to make
[7:44] sense of it we grab this piece of the
[7:46] word we grab this and we try to
[7:48] cobble it together and try to make sense
[7:49] of things if god hasn't spoken on it
[7:52] then that can't not that cannot inspire
[7:54] faith if god hasn't said
[7:56] this is what it is and this is what it's
[7:58] going to be then that's not going to
[7:59] bring this real strong
[8:00] solid feeling of this is what god wants
[8:02] me to do and this is what's going to
[8:04] happen
[8:04] it's just to hope so and so when we join
[8:08] our fears with prophecy we say well
[8:10] brother branham said this the bible
[8:12] says that i wonder if this could be this
[8:13] and this is the direction it's going to
[8:15] go
[8:15] it's only making the uncertainty worse
[8:18] and there's a number of statements we
[8:19] could read to you again but fear is one
[8:21] of the worst things that the devil can
[8:22] put on you
[8:24] it's worse than disease it's worse than
[8:27] than debt it's worse than depression
[8:29] it's worse than divorce it's the worst
[8:31] thing that the devil could put on you
[8:32] you say oh what's worse than being
[8:34] divorced well the fear and the fallout
[8:36] from it
[8:37] what's worse than a disease the fear of
[8:39] it what's worse than debt the fear of it
[8:41] what's worse than all these things
[8:42] the actual fear it's one of the worst
[8:44] things the devil can put on you is maybe
[8:46] not an affliction in itself but a fear
[8:48] of what the affliction means
[8:49] a fear of what the affliction can do to
[8:51] you so if you can take the fear out of
[8:53] something then it loses its
[8:54] real power over you as we read in romans
[8:58] chapter 8 last time we are
[9:00] led by the spirit of god we're not led
[9:03] by fear we have not come under
[9:05] a bondage of fear and it's not fear
[9:07] that's leading us it's not fear that's
[9:08] directing us it's not fear
[9:10] that we act upon sons and daughters of
[9:12] god are led by
[9:13] the spirit of god and that's what
[9:15] motivates us
[9:16] that's what's going to compel us to do
[9:18] something
[9:20] and these are just uh catching up on
[9:22] some things that we had laid
[9:23] as part of our foundation on sunday so
[9:26] if there's a prophecy
[9:28] in scripture there's a prophecy that's
[9:30] given in the word of god
[9:31] and it speaks of hardship the prophecy
[9:34] of a hardship is never meant to cause us
[9:36] to fear
[9:38] the bible does not say you will go
[9:39] through suffering you will be afflicted
[9:40] many are the afflictions of the
[9:42] righteous and
[9:43] and all that will live godly in christ
[9:44] jesus shall suffer persecution
[9:46] it's not meant to cause fear or weakness
[9:49] not meant to cause you well i don't want
[9:50] to live godly in christ jesus if i'm
[9:52] going to suffer persecution and
[9:53] i don't want to be righteous if i'm
[9:55] going to suffer affliction prophecy of
[9:57] hardship or difficulty is meant to
[9:59] inspire faith
[10:00] not fear just as we read in john chapter
[10:03] 16 verse 13
[10:04] it says all these things have i spoken
[10:06] unto you that in me
[10:08] you might have peace in the world you
[10:10] shall have tribulation
[10:12] but be of good shear i have overcome the
[10:15] world
[10:16] so jesus is saying i've told you
[10:18] difficult times are coming
[10:19] i've told you you're going to be kicked
[10:20] out of church and killed but i didn't
[10:23] tell you this so that you would be
[10:25] frustrated that you would be troubled in
[10:27] your hearts and you'd be worried and
[10:28] fearful but rather i told you these
[10:30] things
[10:31] that you might have peace have peace in
[10:34] me have peace
[10:34] in that i've shared these things with
[10:36] you beforehand have peace in the fact
[10:38] that
[10:38] i've already told you that this is
[10:40] what's going to happen so you can face
[10:41] it with boldness you can face it with
[10:42] confidence
[10:43] knowing he says even being of good cheer
[10:45] because i have overcome
[10:47] the world so there's no prophecy of hard
[10:50] times that should inspire fear
[10:52] there's no prophecy of suffering there's
[10:54] no prophecy of persecution
[10:56] that should cause us to doubt or dread
[10:58] or be worried about what the future
[11:00] holds
[11:00] do you believe that and i know it seems
[11:03] counterintuitive to our instinct of
[11:05] self-preservation and
[11:07] fight or flight that that whenever i get
[11:10] fearful of something i want to run away
[11:11] from it but jesus is saying if i tell
[11:13] you something is coming
[11:14] no matter how big it may see no matter
[11:16] how hard it may seem or how difficult it
[11:18] may seem
[11:18] you have no reason to fear it
[11:22] god's people have always suffered
[11:23] affliction
[11:25] we cannot look through any time in
[11:27] history and find where the people of god
[11:28] were not enduring afflictions
[11:30] they were not going through persecution
[11:32] they were not suffering loss there was
[11:34] not
[11:34] something that the a believer not
[11:36] necessarily the entire age or everyone
[11:38] or everyone in the church but we looked
[11:40] through every age
[11:41] and god's people have always suffered
[11:43] persecution
[11:44] they've always endured afflictions
[11:46] they've always had loss they've always
[11:48] suffered
[11:49] and the loss the persecution the
[11:51] suffering it's no evidence that god has
[11:53] forsaken you
[11:54] the fact that you would go through a
[11:56] difficult time is no evidence that god
[11:57] doesn't love you
[11:59] if somebody was to hate you and to spite
[12:01] you that's no evidence that god is angry
[12:02] with you
[12:03] trouble difficulty great loss and all
[12:05] those things are no evidence
[12:07] of god's a wrath it's no evidence of
[12:10] non-election
[12:11] it's no evidence that you're not the
[12:12] chosen of god as a matter of fact it can
[12:14] be the very affliction the suffering
[12:16] you're going through that people use
[12:18] to say how could you be of god and how
[12:19] could you be the chosen people as they
[12:21] would say about the jews how could they
[12:23] suffer such tremendous loss
[12:25] in persecution and be god's chosen
[12:27] people it's actually one of the things
[12:28] that stumbles the world
[12:30] is how god would let his people suffer
[12:32] but it's no evidence
[12:34] that god isn't with you in romans
[12:36] chapter 8 as we
[12:38] read last time suffering infirmities
[12:40] tribulation and distress and persecution
[12:42] and
[12:43] famine and poverty and death it's no
[12:45] sign that god has abandoned you
[12:47] it's no evidence that god's love isn't
[12:49] still upon you that his care
[12:51] is for you because none of those things
[12:53] diminish god's love
[12:55] if you're suffering god's love hasn't
[12:57] been diminished if you're going through
[12:59] a difficult time god's
[13:00] god's love hasn't been diminished it's
[13:01] not that god's love wanes
[13:04] that as long as he's loving me really
[13:06] passionately
[13:07] i have no troubles but when god gets
[13:08] cold on me and the love's gone out of my
[13:10] relationship
[13:11] and it's not like he loves me anymore
[13:13] and that's when things get rough no
[13:15] god's not like that
[13:16] he always loves you to attend he always
[13:18] loves you 100
[13:19] and god is always loving you as much as
[13:21] he could possibly love you
[13:23] it's just our understanding of the love
[13:25] that wanes and
[13:26] and that we filter it through our own
[13:27] human expression of love
[13:29] and and i'll say this that we we know
[13:33] that god loves us
[13:34] but the only knowledge we have of love
[13:36] is our own love
[13:38] the love we've received and the love we
[13:39] give so we filter god's love through the
[13:42] love we give and the love we receive
[13:44] and we know our love ain't perfect we
[13:47] give love him perfectly
[13:48] we've received an imperfect love and we
[13:50] can just attribute that to god then well
[13:52] then god must be like i am when i'm mad
[13:54] at somebody i love i'll give him the
[13:55] cold shoulder
[13:56] god's not like that right and so these
[13:59] difficulties these things we go through
[14:00] it's no sign that god's love has waned
[14:03] or diminished
[14:04] and there's no promise in the word of
[14:06] god that says we will not sorrow
[14:09] there's no promise in the word of god
[14:11] that says we will not have trouble
[14:13] but there is a promise that good will
[14:15] come from him
[14:16] there's no promise you won't suffer
[14:18] there's no promise you won't sorrow
[14:19] there's no promise you won't go through
[14:20] trouble but he has promised that he'll
[14:22] be with us in it
[14:24] and he has promised us that good will
[14:25] come from it
[14:27] we read last time in the church age book
[14:28] how he said that god
[14:30] when when we go through difficulties
[14:32] when we go through trouble when we go
[14:33] through things that are very very hard
[14:35] as he says suffering
[14:36] that god does it with a purpose if he
[14:39] didn't have a purpose what it would
[14:40] result in
[14:41] is frustration and not peace so
[14:43] regardless of what we go through how
[14:45] difficult it is
[14:46] understanding that god has a purpose is
[14:48] what offers peace
[14:50] if we don't know that god has a purpose
[14:51] it offers frustration
[14:53] he says his purpose is that we after we
[14:55] have suffered a while
[14:56] we would be made perfect be established
[14:59] strengthened and
[15:00] settled and then he makes a couple
[15:02] references in the scripture he says in
[15:04] plain language the very
[15:05] character of jesus was perfected by
[15:07] suffering
[15:08] and according to paul he has left his
[15:11] church
[15:12] a measure of suffering that they too by
[15:14] their faith in god
[15:15] while suffering for him would come to a
[15:18] place of perfection
[15:20] this is god's will for us it's his will
[15:23] that we would suffer
[15:24] now i would say this to us as
[15:25] individuals we all are going to have
[15:26] some measure of suffering
[15:28] but if we let suffering do its work and
[15:31] we yield to it
[15:32] take it patiently we recognize it's to
[15:34] produce something inside of us he says
[15:36] this measure of suffering is that after
[15:39] we have suffered
[15:40] we'd come to a place of perfection so he
[15:43] has
[15:43] a purpose to suffering we're promised
[15:46] that we're going to suffer but the
[15:47] suffering just isn't for suffering's
[15:48] sake
[15:49] he will use suffering to perfect our
[15:51] character
[15:52] and i realize all of you are have been
[15:54] taught these things and understand these
[15:56] things but i want to
[15:57] just kind of bring them into view right
[15:59] now when there's
[16:00] things coming that are we're guessing
[16:02] that there's things coming
[16:04] we're worried about things that are
[16:05] coming we've heard statements and we've
[16:07] heard
[16:07] sermons we've heard different things
[16:09] tell us oh it's going to be dark it's
[16:10] going to be terrible it's going to be
[16:11] horrible
[16:12] and and all that may absolutely be true
[16:15] but
[16:15] all those things should not raise fear
[16:18] in your heart
[16:19] should not cause you to be anxious
[16:21] should not cause you to be concerned
[16:23] that you're going to be cast out that
[16:24] you're going to be forsaken that you're
[16:25] going to suffer
[16:26] some affliction that you're not going to
[16:28] be able to endure and make it through
[16:29] if there's suffering coming it's for
[16:31] your perfection amen
[16:33] there's something that you're going to
[16:34] have to face as an individual there's
[16:35] something we're going to have to face as
[16:36] a church
[16:37] if there's something we're going to have
[16:38] to go through as a bride then we know
[16:40] god has a purpose in it
[16:41] therefore we will not let that something
[16:43] loom over us as something larger than
[16:46] what we can handle
[16:48] so regardless of what the future holds
[16:49] he's promised us protection
[16:51] and he's promised us perfection and we
[16:54] should just claim that no matter what
[16:56] comes
[16:56] we know this is for my good no matter
[16:58] what comes god's gonna use it for his
[17:00] glory no matter what comes
[17:01] it's for my perfection or god's going to
[17:03] protect me from it
[17:07] i wonder there's a little bit of a high
[17:09] sound in the in the sound and i don't
[17:11] know if i'm just
[17:12] blowing you on i'm trying to watch if
[17:13] the sister's hair is going
[17:16] whenever we get loud but we're still
[17:17] working through some new equipment and
[17:19] still trying to get everything set up
[17:21] and so i just
[17:23] i don't know if it's a little loud but i
[17:25] just feel like there's a little bit of a
[17:26] high
[17:27] high-end ping or pitch there to it and
[17:30] there's also a popping i notice
[17:32] that's a lot louder now so we might have
[17:33] to resolve this uh through trial and
[17:36] error
[17:37] now i want to go back to a statement
[17:38] that we read in the beginning brother
[17:39] bran says he wants us to know what he
[17:41] has said about this day
[17:43] and then meet it by faith because he
[17:45] said it would be that way
[17:47] and now this is i'm gonna what we've
[17:49] just shared through these first um
[17:51] several minutes is just recapturing some
[17:54] of the principles and things we were
[17:55] speaking on on sunday
[17:57] and now this is this is where i had to
[17:59] leave off a little bit
[18:00] brother says he wants us to know what he
[18:02] has said about this day and then meet it
[18:04] by faith because he said it would
[18:05] be that way so what he has said about
[18:07] this day we know it will
[18:09] be that way therefore we can meet this
[18:11] day with faith
[18:13] if he says tomorrow is going to be cold
[18:15] then we can meet it with a coat
[18:17] he says tomorrow's going to be raining
[18:18] we can meet it with a we can meet it
[18:20] with an umbrella why he said so
[18:22] so if we know what he has said about the
[18:24] future then we can meet it with faith
[18:25] knowing that it's going to be exactly
[18:27] the way he said it would be
[18:28] and so there's the the specter of
[18:31] persecution
[18:32] or the possibility of a squeeze can hang
[18:36] over us like a cloud
[18:38] and it's like a looming darkness that
[18:41] you just you never know when the
[18:42] government's going to show up
[18:44] with with guns and you never know when
[18:47] the government's going to show up with
[18:47] the lock and you never know when they're
[18:49] going to kick you out of your church you
[18:50] never know where there's going to be
[18:51] locks placed on the door
[18:52] you never know when it's going to be the
[18:53] last time they're going to be able to
[18:54] meet and when are they going to go door
[18:56] to door
[18:56] asking if you believe the message and if
[18:58] you do they're going to put you in a
[18:59] cattle car
[19:00] and ship you up to alaska and there's a
[19:02] lot of ways that things can be presented
[19:04] to us where we're always wondering
[19:06] i wonder if this administration is going
[19:08] to be the one
[19:09] that finally outlaws the message and
[19:12] there's always and
[19:13] i maybe i'm putting in a way that may
[19:15] seem comical or extreme
[19:16] but this is a this is a language that's
[19:18] sometimes used
[19:20] about what we believe and about what
[19:21] brother branham said and that one day
[19:23] we're going to face this
[19:24] we have to look down the barrel of a gun
[19:26] and we're going to have to stand for our
[19:27] faith and it could be
[19:29] it can always have this cloud kind of
[19:30] hanging over us that until that time
[19:33] comes
[19:34] and when that time comes that's when
[19:36] things are going to really start to
[19:37] happen
[19:38] and there's a danger to that number one
[19:40] you're really really afraid of that time
[19:42] so fear is always operating in the
[19:44] background or you've kind of got slack
[19:46] until that time comes
[19:48] and i imagine there's a lot of people
[19:50] that are waiting until the knocks on the
[19:52] door
[19:53] do you believe the message and they're
[19:54] like oh this is our chance honey turn
[19:57] the tv off this is our chance
[19:59] yes yes i believe the message like uh
[20:03] no sorry you don't know what the message
[20:06] is next door
[20:07] right because they're just they're just
[20:08] waiting until things get difficult
[20:10] things get hard and
[20:11] that's what happens sometimes
[20:13] coronavirus comes around covet 19 hits
[20:15] and people are
[20:16] oh no is this the plague is this the
[20:17] disease people are starting to find out
[20:19] where they can go to church
[20:20] then they find out all the church doors
[20:22] are closed people move across country
[20:24] trying to find god then
[20:26] why because something starts happening
[20:28] oh i guess now is the time to get
[20:29] serious
[20:30] so there's a way these things can impact
[20:32] us in the sense that causes some people
[20:33] just to slack off
[20:35] until things get really hot and heavy
[20:37] till the squeeze comes
[20:38] to things start happening and that's
[20:40] when we're all going to get serious
[20:41] that's when all of our kids are going to
[20:42] get saved
[20:43] or they say wow i'm always fearful
[20:45] they're always looking around the corner
[20:46] they're always wondering what's next
[20:48] and really you don't want to live in
[20:49] either of those realms you want to know
[20:51] what god has said about this day
[20:53] and then have faith to meet it and so it
[20:56] begs the question has god
[20:57] prophesied specific persecution
[21:00] or even a specific measure of
[21:02] tribulation for the bride has god
[21:04] prophesied it
[21:05] and if there's prophecies pertaining to
[21:07] persecution of the bride
[21:09] there's prophecies pertaining to
[21:11] difficulty that the bride's going to
[21:12] have to go through
[21:13] does your understanding of the prophecy
[21:16] inspire fear or does it inspire faith
[21:19] so what if we see it and we read and say
[21:21] well brother branham said here and the
[21:22] message says this there and the bible
[21:24] says this there
[21:25] now once we've read it and we process it
[21:27] does it bring a faith in our hearts to
[21:28] believe
[21:29] that god has provision that god's going
[21:31] to see us through it or does it cost
[21:33] fear
[21:33] and if it's causing fear i would suggest
[21:35] there's a misunderstanding somewhere
[21:38] because god would not say thus saith the
[21:40] lord you're going to go through
[21:41] persecution
[21:42] and then you received the revelation of
[21:44] the persecution and it inspired fear and
[21:47] inspired dread
[21:48] and inspire worry something would be
[21:50] missing somewhere
[21:52] then if there is a prophecy that
[21:55] pertains to these things then the
[21:56] question is are we taking
[21:58] the whole word into consideration yes
[22:02] it may say this here but what else has
[22:04] the word said
[22:06] maybe maybe there's more to what was
[22:08] said and it's just these sound bites or
[22:10] these phrases that we have
[22:11] and i call them message myths where it's
[22:13] we're quoting things
[22:15] and we say brother branham said you're
[22:16] like are you sure he ever said that
[22:18] because i've been looking for 30 years
[22:20] now and i've never found it
[22:23] and then the person oh no i'm telling
[22:24] you right now brother bam said say well
[22:25] here's my laptop
[22:27] i always travel with my 17-inch xps
[22:29] let's open this thing up
[22:30] let's bang away on these keys and let's
[22:32] find where brother branham said it
[22:34] and you can't find it like well i know
[22:36] it's in there somewhere
[22:38] like where you're going to have to use
[22:40] the bible code to find it
[22:43] you have to read it this way and then
[22:44] you have to read it this way
[22:47] and so there's sometimes we've just
[22:48] built this mythology around the message
[22:50] of these things that brother man said
[22:51] and he never did say it
[22:53] or you read it so far and you stop
[22:58] did you know brother brown said you
[22:59] should never send your kids to sunday
[23:00] school
[23:02] he said it that is almost verbatim he
[23:05] said you should never send your kids to
[23:07] sunday school
[23:08] he said you should take them amen
[23:12] and so if i left off on the first part
[23:14] we could rally against
[23:15] a campaign against sunday school right
[23:18] because you leave some of it off so you
[23:20] want to take the whole word into
[23:22] consideration
[23:22] without your private interpretation your
[23:25] own personal interpretation of it
[23:27] in revelation chapter 3 verse 10 it says
[23:29] this
[23:31] in the admonishment to the philadelphia
[23:33] age because thou has kept the word of my
[23:34] patience i will also keep thee from the
[23:37] hour of temptation
[23:39] we shall come upon all the world to try
[23:42] them that dwell
[23:43] upon the earth so this we could we look
[23:46] at this scripture and the scripture
[23:47] saying
[23:48] without any uh qualification that there
[23:51] will come a temptation
[23:54] upon the earth that will try everyone on
[23:57] it
[23:59] there's going to be a time when there's
[24:01] going to be a temptation that comes upon
[24:02] the earth
[24:03] and is going to try all them that are
[24:05] upon the earth god
[24:06] has said it will happen so as we face
[24:10] this
[24:10] as we look at this scripture and say
[24:11] there's going to be a temptation come
[24:13] upon the earth an
[24:13] hour of temptation that will come upon
[24:15] all the earth to try them that dwell
[24:17] upon
[24:18] the earth if you're dwelling upon the
[24:19] earth there's going to come an hour of
[24:20] temptation
[24:21] you know try everyone that's on the
[24:23] earth god said it would be there but
[24:24] then he also
[24:25] says in this very scripture that he
[24:28] promised to keep thee
[24:30] from the hour of temptation so when you
[24:33] read it he's actually saying i'll keep
[24:34] you
[24:35] from that hour not even necessarily
[24:38] in the hour or through the hour he will
[24:42] keep you
[24:42] from the hour so you can read a
[24:45] statement says
[24:46] oh everyone that dwells upon the earth
[24:47] their flesh is going to be eaten by
[24:48] birds and you just
[24:50] develop this real horrific scene of
[24:52] tribulation not take into consideration
[24:54] that the bible has already said the
[24:55] bride is gone
[24:57] before that happens so why should you
[24:59] fear about it
[25:00] why should you be afraid of tribulation
[25:03] why should you be afraid of the sights
[25:05] and things that are gonna be coming up
[25:06] on the earth
[25:06] after the bride's gone so the devil
[25:08] tries to cause confusion
[25:09] cause things to blend in mesh things
[25:11] into our uh the day we're living in
[25:13] to try to keep us under this suspense
[25:15] that at any moment we're going to seal
[25:17] our testimony with our own blood
[25:22] in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 13
[25:24] we referenced it last time there hath no
[25:26] temptation taken you
[25:28] but such is common to man but god is
[25:31] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[25:32] tempted
[25:33] above that you're able but will with the
[25:36] temptation
[25:36] also make a way to escape that you may
[25:40] be able to bear it
[25:42] this is the promise we should all be
[25:44] very familiar with that there's no
[25:46] temptation
[25:47] that you have been challenged with that
[25:48] you'll be tested with that another
[25:50] person hasn't been tested with before
[25:53] there's nothing unique to your
[25:54] temptation to where it hasn't been
[25:56] endured already there's no temptation
[25:58] such confronts you but such as is common
[26:00] to man
[26:01] and then we're so thankful for the
[26:02] faithfulness of god who will not suffer
[26:04] you
[26:04] to endure a temptation that you're not
[26:06] able to endure
[26:08] he will not suffer you to go through a
[26:10] temptation that you're not able to bear
[26:12] but will with the temptation
[26:14] every temptation has something special
[26:16] built within it and that's a way to
[26:18] escape it
[26:20] and the way of escape is how you're able
[26:21] to bear it
[26:23] not just getting used to it and and
[26:25] learning and learning how to live with
[26:27] it
[26:27] but rather a way to escape it so that
[26:31] you may be able to bear it
[26:33] now i want to read a lengthy statement
[26:35] from the message look away to jesus
[26:38] and those scriptures revelations three
[26:40] and first corinthians 10 to me
[26:42] speak to how that god has promised that
[26:45] there is there are temptations
[26:47] there are sufferings there are
[26:49] difficulties but there's more to the
[26:51] promise
[26:52] than just the fact that you're going to
[26:54] suffer there's perfection that comes
[26:56] with it paul said
[26:57] the sufferings of this present time are
[26:58] not worthy to be compared to the glory
[27:00] which shall be revealed in us
[27:02] so it's not just suffering for
[27:03] suffering's sake but there's something
[27:04] that comes out of it
[27:06] but then there's also another part of
[27:08] the word where so you could say well
[27:09] there's the perfection that comes from
[27:10] suffering
[27:11] all of us as individuals are subject to
[27:13] suffering at any time
[27:15] and and then there's but then on another
[27:17] level if there's
[27:19] a prophecy that looms large over us we
[27:21] feel like at any moment we're all going
[27:23] to be
[27:23] undergoing some difficulty some pressure
[27:26] a persecution or a squeeze then there's
[27:29] a there's other parts to those
[27:31] prophecies that speak to the perfection
[27:33] or the protection so we don't get so
[27:36] enamored with the fact that these things
[27:37] are coming these things are coming but
[27:39] what has god said about it
[27:41] what's the full picture what's the full
[27:43] scope and it's in the message look away
[27:45] to jesus that we find
[27:47] some of the most familiar statements
[27:48] when it comes to persecution
[27:50] when it comes to suffering as it relates
[27:53] to the bride specifically
[27:55] and brother branham's ministry and
[27:57] there's a few statements i've left off
[27:58] thinking maybe we'll get to him in
[28:00] another point but brother bam says this
[28:02] the third pull has now been vindicated
[28:05] he says and i'm sure you all know what
[28:07] it is
[28:08] but it will not be used in a great way
[28:12] until this council begins to tighten up
[28:15] and when it does when that does the
[28:17] pentecostals and
[28:18] so forth can almost impersonate anything
[28:21] could be done
[28:22] so the third pull and it's remarkable if
[28:25] you listen to it i was listening to it
[28:26] again here recently whether it says
[28:28] the third poll has been vindicated and
[28:29] i'm sure you all know what it is
[28:31] not one amen you can hear on the tape
[28:34] everybody's like
[28:35] we do huh what we know what it is
[28:38] because it's still to most of them they
[28:40] weren't zeroing in on what it was
[28:42] because
[28:43] the third pool's now been vindicated i'm
[28:45] sure you all know what it is
[28:46] he says but it'll not be used in a great
[28:48] way so now if you think about that he's
[28:49] saying it will not be used in a great
[28:51] way
[28:53] until this council begins to tighten up
[28:56] so the third pull
[28:58] now is is where the third pole we know
[29:00] it is thoroughly vindicated we know what
[29:01] it is
[29:02] he says but now it's not going to be
[29:03] used in a great way until the council
[29:06] begins to tighten up
[29:06] and when it does when that does so now
[29:09] we've in our minds think
[29:10] third pull is not going to be used in a
[29:12] great way until something happens
[29:15] he says the pentecostals and so forth
[29:16] can almost impersonate anything could be
[29:18] done
[29:19] so he's saying there's always going to
[29:20] be some impersonation there's always
[29:22] going to be some fanaticism or something
[29:24] that can be in
[29:25] says but when that time comes when the
[29:28] squeeze comes down
[29:29] and this is where we get how many here
[29:31] are familiar with the term the squeeze
[29:33] this is where it comes from this
[29:36] statement right here
[29:37] when the squeeze comes down then you'll
[29:39] see what you have seen
[29:40] temporarily be manifested in the
[29:43] fullness of its power
[29:45] so he's referring to the temporary
[29:47] manifestations of the third pool
[29:49] and brother brahms looking at it from
[29:50] the standpoint we've seen temporary
[29:52] manifestations of it
[29:54] it's not going to be used in a great way
[29:56] until something else happens
[29:57] and then when that happens you'll see it
[29:59] manifested in its fullness
[30:00] it says now i'll continue in evangelism
[30:03] just as i was commissioned first i must
[30:04] continue on
[30:05] therefore you've had the word and you
[30:07] know what to look for how to stand
[30:10] so we have the word we know what what to
[30:12] look for and how to stand
[30:14] so there's something that's been given
[30:15] to us already
[30:17] what to look for and how to stand and he
[30:20] says in
[30:21] paragraph 42 and everyone knows that for
[30:23] as certain as the first was identified
[30:25] the first pool
[30:26] so has the second been identified and if
[30:28] you'll think
[30:29] real closely you who are spiritual as
[30:32] the bible said here's to him that has
[30:33] wisdom
[30:34] the third is properly identified we know
[30:38] where it is so the third pool is here
[30:41] so there's no ambiguity of whether or
[30:43] not it's coming whether or not it's
[30:44] manifested whether or not it's here he
[30:46] said it is here
[30:47] thoroughly vindicated it's now here he
[30:50] says
[30:52] i it is so sacred that i mustn't say
[30:55] much about it so that
[30:56] informs us that brother adam's
[30:58] description and language he uses he's
[31:00] going to be reserved and sharing it
[31:02] there's more he would want to say but he
[31:04] can't say too much
[31:07] i mustn't say much about it as he told
[31:08] me in the beginning this say nothing of
[31:10] it you remember that years ago
[31:12] and he's referring to the tent vision as
[31:14] we call it the vision with the three
[31:16] pulls in it he says
[31:17] it speaks for itself i've tried to
[31:20] explain the others and i made a mistake
[31:22] he says this will be the thing that to
[31:24] my opinion i don't say the lord tells me
[31:26] this will be the thing that will start
[31:28] the rapturing faith for the going away
[31:31] so if you follow kind of the these bread
[31:33] crumbs as he's placing it in there
[31:35] the third poll has been vindicated
[31:37] properly identified
[31:38] and it's here he says i can't say too
[31:41] much about it but i believe this is
[31:42] going to be what causes rapture and
[31:43] faith
[31:44] i'd like to say more but this is going
[31:46] to be what causes the bride to be
[31:48] translated what
[31:49] the third poll so he says we have to
[31:52] wait here just a minute until
[31:53] this happens over here to catch up then
[31:56] the time comes
[31:57] and i really honestly don't know exactly
[31:59] what he's referring to there
[32:01] but he's looking at something and he
[32:02] uses the language which is very very
[32:04] general
[32:05] maybe in some ways cryptic that we got
[32:07] to wait here just a minute until
[32:09] this happens over here to catch up then
[32:12] he says the time comes
[32:14] but it's thoroughly identified now
[32:16] notice what he says
[32:17] there's coming a time in this nation to
[32:20] where this nation is going to exercise
[32:22] all the power that the beast had before
[32:25] which was pagan rome
[32:26] when it became papal rome so pagan roman
[32:28] papal rome are the same spirit
[32:30] this that this nation will do that so
[32:33] this nation
[32:34] is going to raise up and exercise all
[32:36] the power that the beast had he says
[32:37] revelation 13 plainly explains it
[32:41] the lamb came upon out of the earth the
[32:42] other beasts come up out of the water
[32:44] thickness in multitudes of people this
[32:46] lamb come up where there was no people
[32:48] a lamb represents religion he says and
[32:51] remember
[32:51] it spoke like the lamb it was a lamb
[32:54] then after a while it received power and
[32:55] spoke like a dragon
[32:57] and exercised all the power of the
[32:58] dragon had before him and the dragon is
[33:01] rome
[33:01] always so now we're connecting all this
[33:05] together and i realize
[33:06] i like being able to do this maybe on a
[33:08] wednesday night because
[33:10] you're it's maybe more of a teaching
[33:12] time
[33:13] but brother branham is saying talking
[33:15] about the third pull
[33:17] thoroughly identified thoroughly
[33:18] vindicated it's here now he's looking at
[33:21] something coming and his
[33:24] in his way he sees it he even says in my
[33:27] mind
[33:28] this will be the thing that will cause
[33:29] the rapture of the church the third pool
[33:30] will be
[33:31] he's looking at prophecy in the
[33:33] scripture that's coming he said do you
[33:34] realize that america is going to raise
[33:36] up
[33:36] and she's going to fulfill revelations
[33:38] 13 and she's going to exercise all the
[33:40] power of the beast
[33:41] and this is going to be papal rome even
[33:44] pagan rome
[33:45] and it's going to be speaking like a
[33:46] dragon exercising all the power that the
[33:48] dragon had before
[33:49] and the dragon is the rome always and so
[33:52] he's trying to get us to think about
[33:53] this thing that's coming
[33:54] in light of the third pull that's been
[33:55] given and the squeeze of the tightening
[33:58] the persecution that's coming
[33:59] he says don't you see the roman
[34:01] denomination a marked protestant
[34:03] denomination
[34:04] an image unto the beast making a power
[34:06] that'll force all protestants like a
[34:08] union
[34:09] says you'll have to be in this council
[34:11] of churches or you won't be able to have
[34:13] fellowship
[34:14] he says well it's practically that way
[34:16] now
[34:17] you can't go to a church and preach
[34:19] unless you have a fellowship card or
[34:20] some identification
[34:22] and now on persons like ourselves we're
[34:24] going to be cut
[34:25] out of all of that all together
[34:29] so you're going to be pushed out of
[34:31] their club so to speak
[34:33] you're not going to be able to
[34:34] fellowship with them or preach for them
[34:37] and and have a and have a
[34:40] you know be organized together and do
[34:42] things jointly why because you're not
[34:44] part of their
[34:45] system now this has been happening for
[34:48] over 40 years
[34:50] where men of god have taken a stand for
[34:52] the message of the hour and they've had
[34:53] to leave their denomination they
[34:55] were part of upc they were part of this
[34:57] organization this has been happening
[34:58] around the world where men in churches
[35:00] have stood for the message of the hour
[35:02] and because they did they were
[35:03] put out of their organization they could
[35:05] no longer have fellowship their
[35:06] fellowship card was taken and tore up
[35:08] there's actually
[35:09] literal fellowship cards and so he says
[35:12] that's exactly because they won't be
[35:14] able to do it now
[35:16] i look at that and realize maybe it's
[35:18] unclear what he's referring to
[35:19] but they won't be able to make the elect
[35:21] join
[35:22] their denomination they won't be able to
[35:25] make the elect
[35:26] join their organization their way of
[35:28] seeing things and so they're not going
[35:30] to be able to make you
[35:31] do that so you're going to be cut out he
[35:34] says it's tightening
[35:36] and when that time comes and the press
[35:39] comes to a place to where you were
[35:40] pressed out
[35:42] then watch what i'm fixing to tell you
[35:44] in a few minutes
[35:45] watch the third pull then it'll be
[35:48] absolutely to the total loss
[35:50] but it'll be for the bride and the
[35:52] church
[35:53] the church is the one that goes to
[35:55] tribulation but the bride's the one that
[35:57] goes into rapture
[35:58] so there's something in this third pool
[36:00] where brother i'm going to preach his
[36:00] souls in prison now and say could it be
[36:02] that it's to the eternally lost
[36:04] but we know there's something in it for
[36:05] the bride there's something in it for
[36:07] the lost
[36:09] there's something in it for the bride
[36:10] and there's something in it for the
[36:11] church
[36:12] so it's in these several paragraphs that
[36:15] we have
[36:15] that we have this understanding that
[36:17] brother brahma's teaching
[36:19] that the third poll is here it's
[36:20] properly identified as thoroughly
[36:22] vindicated
[36:23] that it will not manifest in its
[36:25] entirety or in its fullness
[36:28] until it comes time for the squeeze to
[36:30] come or this tightening
[36:31] he says we can see it now it's already
[36:32] happening revelations 13 come into
[36:34] existence the roman
[36:35] denomination this this dragon speaking
[36:38] this
[36:39] america becoming like this beast to
[36:41] enforce this religious persecution
[36:44] and he says this press comes when that
[36:45] time comes oppressed
[36:47] a place where you're pressed out he says
[36:49] watch the third pull then
[36:51] what i'm fixing to tell you you watch
[36:53] then what i'm fixing to tell you
[36:56] now i've read it to you so i'd be
[36:59] foolish to try to tell you
[37:00] he didn't say that
[37:03] and and it's in plain english for us to
[37:05] read and understand that brother man's
[37:07] definitely laying these things out there
[37:09] that gets our attention
[37:10] and it's these statements statements
[37:12] earlier in the year
[37:14] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[37:15] in different places where brother brahm
[37:16] is
[37:17] definitely pointing out that he has this
[37:19] understanding
[37:20] that the denominations are wanting to do
[37:22] something with their organization the
[37:24] world council churches has an agenda
[37:26] it has something it's trying to do and
[37:27] it's going to try to force everyone who
[37:29] names christ and everyone to join their
[37:31] league
[37:31] and if you don't join it there's going
[37:33] to be consequences for it
[37:36] that even though these prophecies and
[37:38] these statements by brother branham are
[37:39] very clear
[37:40] he didn't prophesy a persecution he
[37:42] didn't prophesy a tightening or
[37:44] press or the squeeze to cause us to
[37:46] despair
[37:48] the truth of this was never meant for us
[37:50] to be fearful
[37:51] it's never meant for us to chew our
[37:53] nails it was never meant for us to
[37:54] speculate oh when is the door is going
[37:55] to be shut and when are we no longer
[37:56] going to be at fellowship
[37:57] when is this going to happen he didn't
[37:59] prophesy these things to us to create a
[38:02] dark cloud or a shadow that always kind
[38:04] of follows us as a church
[38:06] and we never know when we never know
[38:07] when he told us these things because
[38:09] there's something to it
[38:10] amen and it's in these prophecies
[38:14] and i want to point this very very
[38:16] narrow part out and go into more later
[38:19] he prophesied this that we might gain a
[38:21] greater confidence
[38:23] he prophesied this so there would be
[38:24] something that we could receive in this
[38:26] in the totality of it not just there's
[38:28] going to be a squeeze there's going to
[38:29] be a persecution there's going to be a
[38:30] tightening there's going to be a world
[38:31] council churches if you don't join it
[38:32] they're going to shut your church doors
[38:33] not that we would all sit around say i
[38:34] guess that's going to happen one day
[38:37] but rather take the totality of it and
[38:39] recognize there's a promise
[38:41] in this that if i attach myself to this
[38:44] completely diminishes
[38:46] there's a promise that he's giving us
[38:48] he's pointing us to things he says i
[38:50] can't say too much but the third pull's
[38:52] here
[38:52] it's thoroughly identified properly
[38:54] vindicated look there's going to be
[38:55] things coming but this is
[38:57] just watch what i'm fixing to tell you
[38:58] in the next few minutes
[39:00] he shared these things as a foundational
[39:03] point
[39:04] to the sermon looking away to jesus
[39:07] he shared these things as a foundational
[39:09] point to this
[39:11] he's saying i want you before i preach
[39:15] this i want you to consider these things
[39:16] so
[39:17] these things were foundational you
[39:20] follow me
[39:21] they're a starting point not a
[39:22] conclusion
[39:24] so he wasn't he wasn't leading us to
[39:26] this place where boom that's it this is
[39:28] where we are
[39:29] all right let's wait for the squeeze
[39:30] let's wait for the persecution let's
[39:32] wait till we see all these things
[39:33] coming together and then when it does we
[39:34] can start looking around for the third
[39:36] point he's saying
[39:36] it's here properly identified thoroughly
[39:39] vindicated
[39:40] and so he's saying these things as a
[39:42] foundation to look away to jesus
[39:45] because in this very passage here and i
[39:47] don't think i brought it with me but
[39:48] he's saying
[39:49] look i i don't know i may be building a
[39:51] platform and he starts speculating to
[39:53] certain things he says but i know this
[39:55] this message will introduce jesus christ
[39:58] and it has it absolutely has
[40:02] so it's he's saying look away to jesus
[40:05] he said i can't say too much about this
[40:07] i don't want to say too much
[40:08] but he's laying these things out there
[40:10] and he definitely says there's going to
[40:11] be a titan there's going to be a squeeze
[40:12] there's going to be persecution
[40:13] the the america is going to raise up
[40:15] like a lamb that becomes this beast
[40:17] becomes this dragon
[40:18] he says but there's something else in
[40:20] this i'm saying but
[40:21] but there's something else in this that
[40:23] we need to look to because that was
[40:24] foundational
[40:27] it wasn't the conclusion it was the
[40:28] start and so the focus
[40:31] should be on the pull that keeps
[40:35] the focus should be on the pool that
[40:36] protects the elect when
[40:38] that time comes let's not lose sight
[40:42] of what keeps don't lose sight of what
[40:45] what protects because if we don't know
[40:48] what that time looks like
[40:49] because we don't have thus saith the
[40:50] lord it's going to be this way and if
[40:52] we're not exactly sure how these things
[40:53] are involved
[40:54] let's not lose sight of jesus
[40:57] not lose sight of the third poll not
[40:59] lose sight of of what the keeping powers
[41:01] the protection power is
[41:02] for when that time comes
[41:06] because these the reference each one of
[41:09] these references we read here and then
[41:10] some in other some places
[41:12] as well the reference to the squeeze of
[41:13] the tightening of the persecution
[41:15] it's in the context of the third pool
[41:19] so as brother branham brings up
[41:21] revelations 13
[41:22] as he brings up the world council of
[41:24] churches and the pentecostals
[41:26] impersonating anything and the
[41:27] power of the beast and all these things
[41:29] to bring everything into union
[41:31] it's not just in relation to but it's an
[41:34] opposition
[41:35] against the third pool so it's not just
[41:38] these things are all
[41:40] in there at the same time it you have to
[41:42] recognize that satan is against this
[41:44] message
[41:46] he's against this truth he hates this
[41:48] third pool
[41:49] because god has so hid it from him
[41:50] perfectly it's been it's been expressed
[41:53] and manifested in such a way where satan
[41:54] could not destroy it he could not stop
[41:56] it
[41:56] it came and it's manifested and it's
[41:58] having an impact even to this time
[42:00] and satan cannot stop it so he tries to
[42:03] cause confusion about it
[42:05] and so the the squeeze the tightening
[42:07] the persecution is not just in the
[42:09] context of the third pool
[42:10] but those things are in opposition
[42:12] against the third pool
[42:15] now in the message anointed ones at the
[42:17] end time
[42:19] brother branham says this the first bull
[42:21] healing second paul prophesying
[42:23] and we and we could get into the the
[42:26] specifics of that
[42:28] but i i'm sure you know these things he
[42:29] says third pool
[42:31] the open of the word the mysteries
[42:33] revealed
[42:34] prior to december 29 1963 brother
[42:37] branham had a lot of questions about the
[42:39] third pull
[42:40] could it be we don't know we're not sure
[42:42] even in early november
[42:43] he was saying i don't know i'm not sure
[42:45] could it be but after that fifth and
[42:47] final
[42:47] vindication of the third pool when
[42:49] brother branham preaches look away to
[42:51] jesus
[42:51] from this moment on he never has another
[42:54] question about the third pull
[42:56] why thoroughly vindicated properly
[42:59] identified
[43:00] it is here so he never questions it
[43:04] anymore
[43:05] but you find statements like this the
[43:07] few times he makes reference to it he's
[43:08] very certain about what it is the third
[43:10] poll
[43:10] the opening of the word the mysteries
[43:13] revealed
[43:14] that's what the third poll was the open
[43:15] of the word the mysteries revealed
[43:17] no more there's no more higher order to
[43:19] reveal the word than prophets but the
[43:20] only way
[43:21] the prophet can be vindicated is by the
[43:22] word and remember
[43:24] the third pool was the opening of them
[43:27] seven seals to reveal the hidden truth
[43:29] that's been sealed in the word
[43:32] it's so important for us to understand
[43:34] that this is what the third pull is
[43:36] the third pull is not circumstantial
[43:39] instances
[43:40] where something operates in your life
[43:43] and oh we're looking to the third pool
[43:45] and the third pool is going to be this
[43:46] the third pool is going to be bad
[43:47] the third pool was the open of the word
[43:49] the third pulls the seventh seal opening
[43:51] the third poll is revealing christ the
[43:53] third pose to open the seals it reveals
[43:55] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[43:56] the word and that's only given to a
[43:58] special class of people
[44:01] and so that's what the third pull is
[44:03] when he preaches the first seal
[44:05] he said there's coming seven mysterious
[44:07] thunders
[44:09] there's coming forth seven mysterious
[44:11] thunders it's not even written at all
[44:12] that's right and i believe that through
[44:14] these seven thunders
[44:16] will be revealed in the last days in
[44:17] order to get the bride together for
[44:20] rapturing faith so the third pull is
[44:23] the open of the seven seals which is the
[44:25] revealing of the seven thunders
[44:27] he says i believe which is what the
[44:29] seven thunders reveal it's
[44:30] they're all connected together he says i
[44:33] believe
[44:34] that this these seven thunders are
[44:35] revealed to get the bride together
[44:37] for rapturing faith so this is why
[44:40] brother branham says i believe this will
[44:42] be the thing that will start the rapture
[44:43] in faith for the going away
[44:46] because it's the revealing of the seven
[44:47] seals it reveals the hidden truth that's
[44:49] been still in the word
[44:50] and brother man says this is what's
[44:51] going to get the bride together for
[44:53] rapturing faith
[44:55] so this is we're just connecting these
[44:57] dots now
[44:59] the third pool is the opening of the
[45:01] word to give the bride
[45:02] rapturing faith now brother bam says in
[45:05] the message shalom
[45:07] and this is just two weeks within two
[45:10] weeks of this statement from look away
[45:12] to jesus
[45:13] he says now i think it'll lay just lay
[45:15] dormant for a little while
[45:17] until the great hour of persecution
[45:20] comes on
[45:21] he says i i think this is him saying i
[45:23] think it may just lay dormant for a
[45:24] little while so you may notice things
[45:26] are a little different i'm not talking
[45:27] about sin now but i may just take a step
[45:28] back
[45:29] he wasn't sure just how things would
[45:30] unfold until that great hour of
[45:33] persecution comes on
[45:34] it'll speak it'll be manifested will the
[45:37] brother bram say about the rapture god
[45:38] just speaks
[45:39] and the rapture will go it'll speak
[45:41] it'll be manifested just like the five
[45:43] straight signs without failure perfectly
[45:46] and i think just wait
[45:47] just see what does now there's something
[45:50] to
[45:51] these five temporary manifestations of
[45:53] the third pull
[45:54] he says these five straight signs
[45:56] without failure
[45:57] what they were applicable to what they
[45:59] referenced what they involved there was
[46:01] something to those things
[46:03] but it shouldn't create this idea in our
[46:05] mind that the third pull
[46:07] is just like that where it's just
[46:08] waiting for some day for it to happen in
[46:10] your living room waiting for some day to
[46:11] happen when you're on the boat waiting
[46:13] for
[46:13] some day to happen when you're out
[46:14] hunting there's more to this
[46:16] third pool it is the open of the seven
[46:19] seals it is the revealing of jesus
[46:20] christ because he is those seals
[46:23] the opening of all seven seals
[46:26] not just making clear the baggie where
[46:29] you know the candy bag is still sealed
[46:30] but you can see what's in it no it's
[46:32] opened
[46:33] what's in it is ours it's unfolding it's
[46:35] been open so he says
[46:36] now it's it's gonna it may lay dormant
[46:39] until that great hour persecution comes
[46:42] on
[46:43] then he says this in the very next week
[46:47] in his unfailing words of promise others
[46:50] i've tried to explain
[46:51] say how it was done this can't be
[46:53] explained what
[46:54] the third he said it can't be explained
[46:57] just
[46:57] wait it'll not be an operation so
[47:01] perfectly now
[47:03] wait till that council of churches
[47:04] brings on that persecution
[47:07] that's when it'll happen
[47:11] now let's just all agree that the way
[47:14] brother branham is saying this
[47:16] we get the sense that the third pool
[47:20] is going to going to lay dormant for a
[47:22] while this third pool
[47:24] of brother brown's ministry is is just
[47:26] gonna go away
[47:27] and fade maybe go off the scene with
[47:30] brother branham
[47:32] and everyone's waiting until an event
[47:34] takes place
[47:35] and then when this takes place the third
[47:37] pool comes back
[47:39] and if you read it it's almost this you
[47:41] get the sense that that's how brother
[47:42] brahms explaining it it's gonna
[47:44] it's gonna be lay dormant for a while
[47:45] till the great hour of persecution comes
[47:47] on
[47:47] wait till that council churches brings
[47:49] on this persecution that's when it'll
[47:51] happen
[47:52] but what will happen what is he
[47:54] referring to
[47:56] he's referring to the translation of the
[47:58] bride
[48:00] he says i believe the third pull what
[48:01] you've seen manifested temporarily
[48:03] is one day going to be manifest in the
[48:05] fullness of its power he goes and i
[48:06] believe that's what's going to start the
[48:07] rapture in faith for the going away the
[48:09] third pull is what brings rapturing
[48:10] faith for going away
[48:13] and he's saying now it may seem like
[48:14] it's laying dormant and it and it may
[48:16] not
[48:17] it may not be doing things that you
[48:18] expect it to do but the third pool is
[48:20] the revealing of christ
[48:21] the revealing of christ is what gives
[48:23] the bride rapturing faith
[48:26] he says wait till that council churches
[48:27] brings on that persecution that's when
[48:29] it will happen
[48:30] what is it the translation of the bride
[48:32] amen
[48:33] when our bodies are changed to meet the
[48:35] lord in the air
[48:40] and so much of this if you go and listen
[48:42] to the sermons in the summer of 64
[48:44] you find that brother branham brings
[48:45] great clarity to these things
[48:47] because when he preaches feasts of the
[48:48] trumpets everything that he was looking
[48:50] to happen in a physical realm
[48:52] completely changes and he realized and
[48:55] he makes this great point to us that
[48:56] this persecution
[48:58] this titan in this squeeze isn't a
[49:00] physical persecution
[49:02] but it's spiritual persecution
[49:05] it's a pressure that we feel even as
[49:07] message believers from other people that
[49:09] claim to be the
[49:10] believe the message why because you see
[49:12] the open of the word
[49:15] because you're not you're not you're not
[49:17] doing the things that they think you
[49:19] should be doing you're not expressing
[49:20] things the way you think you should be
[49:21] expressing
[49:22] listen don't be ashamed to just stick
[49:23] with god's word
[49:25] stay with god's word and he said these
[49:27] signs shall follow them that believe
[49:28] stay in the channel of the original
[49:30] gospel stay with exactly what he said
[49:32] and don't be pulled into fanaticism by
[49:34] what men are saying by what men are
[49:35] doing
[49:39] that's how you get baptized into 1977
[49:43] right none of you were baptized in 1977
[49:47] i'm sure
[49:48] but there's so much fear created in 1976
[49:52] about 1977 it's all going to be over
[49:54] that someone prophesied
[49:56] yea saith the lord you know we're just
[49:58] but a few hours from 1977 and hundreds
[50:00] of people were baptized
[50:02] unto 1977.
[50:05] now there's just no scriptural basis for
[50:07] it
[50:08] what's the baptism for it's an outward
[50:10] sign
[50:12] that you believe your sins have been
[50:13] remitted right
[50:15] you're you're it's something you do in
[50:16] obedience to the word of god
[50:18] and listen let me say this if you have
[50:20] been baptized in the name of the lord
[50:21] jesus christ and you know that you've
[50:22] been sealed by the holy ghost
[50:24] you never really ever need to be
[50:26] rebaptized
[50:27] what would cause you to be baptized fear
[50:32] because if you were baptized and sealed
[50:37] it worked it did what was supposed to do
[50:41] being re-baptized can't do any more for
[50:43] you
[50:45] so i would much rather just address the
[50:47] fear than create confusion by having you
[50:50] be rebaptized
[50:51] because then people think re-baptism is
[50:53] just a solvent that works that's what
[50:54] you do whenever you backslide whenever
[50:55] something goes wrong you just be
[50:56] re-baptized
[50:57] you don't need to be re-baptized when
[50:58] you go through difficulty
[51:00] you shouldn't be re-baptized every time
[51:01] there's a revival
[51:04] right and that's what happens when
[51:06] there's fanaticism and there's emotion
[51:08] and things get stirred up and people
[51:09] like oh
[51:10] let me get in the water stay steady stay
[51:13] in the word of god do you have the holy
[51:14] ghost you know you've been said yes then
[51:15] stand on your ground
[51:16] amen don't be pulled into fanaticism
[51:18] don't be drawn into something carnal
[51:22] but the random says this in question and
[51:25] answers part three
[51:27] and the seven seals was only revealing
[51:29] what they had left off back there
[51:30] and it opened up what they had left off
[51:32] what luther left what wesley left and
[51:34] all the reformers and pentecostals
[51:36] and down to the present time now
[51:39] the next thing left is the translation
[51:43] of the church the next thing isn't
[51:46] persecution
[51:49] the next thing isn't suffering now i'm
[51:51] not saying there won't be persecution
[51:53] right i'm not saying there won't be
[51:54] suffering but brother branham was not
[51:58] saying that pers physical persecution
[52:00] and being put into
[52:02] you know us being shuttled off to alaska
[52:04] is what happens next
[52:08] that's not what's going to happen next
[52:11] he says the next thing is left is the
[52:13] translation of the church
[52:16] and then he goes through the whole order
[52:17] the return of moses and elijah the
[52:18] millennium reign upon the earth with the
[52:20] bride and bridegroom in the groom for a
[52:21] thousand years
[52:22] and then the judgment bar then a total
[52:23] annihilation of sin he just tells us
[52:25] what's next
[52:26] so is he giving you faith to face the
[52:29] hour
[52:29] amen what's next translation that's what
[52:31] i need faith for is a translation
[52:35] brotherhood says in the first seal the
[52:36] seven thunders of revelation
[52:38] may he show the bride how to prepare for
[52:41] the great translation faith
[52:43] it says in the first seal this is what i
[52:46] believe will give the seven thunders
[52:47] will be revealed to get the bride
[52:48] together for rapturing faith
[52:50] so he says the seven thunders of
[52:51] revelation may he show the bride
[52:54] how to prepare for the great translation
[52:57] faith what does it the third pull does
[53:00] it
[53:02] not the squeeze the third pull
[53:05] not the persecution the third pull
[53:08] persecution and suffering without the
[53:10] third pull wouldn't do us any good would
[53:11] it
[53:13] so the focus is on the word
[53:16] just as we read before in john chapter 7
[53:18] verse 30
[53:20] here he is there's a conspiracy to
[53:23] murder him they want to murder him they
[53:24] would love to get their hands on him
[53:26] says then they sought to take him so
[53:29] they're wanting to do it
[53:30] but no man laid hands on him because his
[53:33] hour was not yet come
[53:35] what controlled the word controlled
[53:38] the word is what determined the destiny
[53:40] of christ the word is what determined
[53:42] when
[53:43] he would be crucified the word is what
[53:45] determined it nothing else
[53:46] not the meanness of man not the politics
[53:48] not the persecution
[53:50] it's all stayed back it was all withheld
[53:53] according to the prophecy
[53:55] and that's what we need to be rooted in
[53:57] is what the word says
[53:58] not what our minds drift off to what the
[54:01] word has said about it not what we're
[54:03] fearful of not the
[54:04] the mythology that develops where we get
[54:06] in our minds it's got to be a particular
[54:08] way
[54:09] lay aside all the private interpretation
[54:11] lay down all the speculation lay down
[54:13] all
[54:14] all the fanaticism and stay with the
[54:16] word of god
[54:21] now i'm going to i have a lengthy
[54:23] statement i want to read from
[54:25] the church age book in the philadelphian
[54:26] age brother braham is dealing with the
[54:29] scripture revelations chapter 3 verse 10
[54:31] it says it goes on to say to them
[54:32] because you have taken my word and i
[54:34] lived it
[54:35] and lived it and thereby become patient
[54:37] i will keep you from the hour of
[54:38] temptation
[54:39] we shall come upon the world to try them
[54:42] that dwell upon the earth
[54:44] now here again we see the overlapping of
[54:46] two ages
[54:47] for this promise has to do with the end
[54:49] of the gentile period
[54:50] which culminates in the great
[54:52] tribulation so
[54:53] this is where i'm saying that there's
[54:55] something spoken in philadelphia that's
[54:57] actually applicable to the end of
[54:58] laodicea
[55:00] because he's looking at something that
[55:01] the culmination or the end of the
[55:03] gentile age
[55:04] which is the great tribulation i will
[55:06] keep thee from the hour of temptation
[55:08] which shall come upon all the world to
[55:09] try them that dwell upon the earth
[55:12] this verse is not a declaration that the
[55:14] church will go
[55:15] into and through the tribulation if it
[55:18] meant that
[55:19] it would have said that but it said i
[55:21] will keep thee from the hour of
[55:23] temptation
[55:25] now catch this part this to me is so
[55:26] important this temptation is exactly
[55:29] like the temptation in eden
[55:31] it'll be a very inviting proposition
[55:34] held up in direct opposition to god's
[55:36] commanded word
[55:37] and yet from the standpoint of human
[55:39] reasoning it will be so
[55:41] very right so enlightening and
[55:43] life-giving as to fool
[55:44] the world only the very elect will not
[55:49] be fooled so you're not going to be
[55:51] fooled by it
[55:53] so according to matthew 24 24 we are not
[55:55] in fear that the elect
[55:56] will be deceived but there is a great
[56:00] power that's going to come that's going
[56:01] to deceive people
[56:02] so he explains it this way only the
[56:05] elect will not be fooled
[56:06] the temptation will come as follows
[56:10] so the great hour of temptation comes as
[56:12] follows the ecumenical move that has
[56:14] started on what seems such a beautiful
[56:15] and blessed principle
[56:16] fulfilling christ's prayer that we all
[56:18] might be one become so strong
[56:20] politically
[56:21] that she bears pressure upon the
[56:23] government to cause all to join with her
[56:25] either directly or through adherence to
[56:27] principles enacted into law
[56:29] so that no people will be recognized as
[56:31] actual churches
[56:32] unless under direct or indirect
[56:34] denominate domination of this council
[56:37] little groups will lose charters
[56:39] privileges
[56:40] until they lose all property and
[56:42] spiritual rights with
[56:44] the people for example
[56:47] right now unless the local ministerial
[56:49] association approves in many
[56:51] if not most cities one cannot rent a
[56:53] building for religious services
[56:55] to become chaplains in the armed
[56:56] services and hospitals etc it is now
[56:58] almost
[56:58] mandatory to be recognized as acceptable
[57:01] to the trinitarian
[57:02] ecumenical groups and these things are
[57:03] all true
[57:06] as this pressure increases and it will
[57:08] it'll be harder to resist
[57:10] for to resist is to lose privilege and
[57:12] so many will be tempted to go along
[57:14] for they will feel it is better to serve
[57:16] god publicly in the framework of this
[57:18] organization
[57:20] than to serve god at all publicly
[57:25] he says but they air but remember
[57:28] only the very elect will not be fooled
[57:32] so all this could be happening but the
[57:34] elect's not fooled
[57:36] now i know this starts ratcheting up the
[57:38] pressure a little bit like oh my
[57:40] goodness what is this going to mean for
[57:41] all of us then
[57:42] are we ever going to be able to rent a
[57:43] building are we ever going to be able to
[57:44] find a place to worship
[57:46] what's going to happen if joe biden
[57:47] wants if he becomes the president in
[57:49] this
[57:49] they do all pass all these tax laws and
[57:51] our donations are no longer tax
[57:53] deductible
[57:54] would you stop giving because of that
[57:57] does the bible say tithe because it
[57:58] works out in your tax
[58:00] return at the end of the year no but
[58:02] there's a lot of people who will stop
[58:04] a lot of churches that probably would
[58:05] fold if they took away property tax
[58:07] exemption
[58:08] took away certain tax uh benefits to
[58:10] churches and they say well look listen
[58:11] just to make it easy if you're donating
[58:13] to a church that is a of a recognizable
[58:16] organization then your taxes can be
[58:18] deducted and all
[58:19] your donations can be deducted all these
[58:21] things and they may go that way
[58:23] and if it happens it's money amen right
[58:26] it's just money
[58:28] and yes it makes it harder but who's
[58:30] going to be fooled by it
[58:32] who's going to give in well i know we've
[58:34] been an independent baptist all the
[58:36] baptist church all these years and i
[58:38] know we've been an independent
[58:39] pentecostal church
[58:40] but unless we join a federation we can't
[58:42] get property tax exemption
[58:44] unless we join a federation we can't
[58:46] have your deductions be tax deductible
[58:48] anymore
[58:49] and i know you'll all stop tithing if we
[58:50] don't so in order for us to survive
[58:53] we're going to have to join with an
[58:54] organization but you know what we're
[58:56] just doing it we might change a little
[58:57] bit of things on the website
[58:59] that we believe in the trinity and you
[59:00] might find little things different but
[59:02] we're just doing this because we can be
[59:03] an example in the community we can do
[59:05] this
[59:05] and maybe there's people that give in
[59:06] because of that but the elect won't be
[59:09] fooled
[59:09] right they say oh we're gonna have to go
[59:11] it alone well that's fine
[59:13] you know we were actually told
[59:14] beforehand this would happen
[59:17] but notice this he says to continuing
[59:19] but they air
[59:21] to believe the devil's lie is to serve
[59:24] satan
[59:29] even though you may want to call him
[59:31] jehovah
[59:35] but the elect will not be deceived
[59:39] notice the furthermore furthermore
[59:42] the elect will not only be kept but as
[59:45] this move becomes the image erected to
[59:47] the beast
[59:48] the saints will be gone in the rapture
[59:52] i'm not worried about revelations 13.
[59:57] i'm not i've heard revelations 18 4.
[1:00:01] i'm becoming the new jerusalem at the
[1:00:04] end of the book
[1:00:05] i i've heard the voice of revelations 18
[1:00:07] 4. i've gone to him who holds the book
[1:00:10] in revelations 10
[1:00:11] that there's something different that
[1:00:12] i'm fellowshipping in
[1:00:14] so when brother brenham's talking and
[1:00:15] look away to jesus that america will
[1:00:17] come to a place
[1:00:18] where she will exercise all the power of
[1:00:20] the beast and he's telling us about this
[1:00:22] image erected to the beast
[1:00:24] and the fulfillment of revelations 13.
[1:00:26] he's saying not only will the elect
[1:00:28] be kept but listen once it gets to that
[1:00:31] point the bride is already gone
[1:00:33] in the rapture
[1:00:36] you're already gone yes he'll keep you
[1:00:39] in the hour of temptation
[1:00:41] but he's also going to keep you from
[1:00:43] this hour of temptation
[1:00:46] there's certain things in the scripture
[1:00:48] we read about and like but the bible
[1:00:49] says this is going to happen
[1:00:51] and the bible says this is going to
[1:00:52] happen and brother bram said this is
[1:00:53] going to happen and brother brahm said
[1:00:55] and i'm just maybe getting into another
[1:00:56] area here brother man says
[1:00:57] that the plagues are going to come upon
[1:00:59] the earth
[1:01:00] and these plagues are going to be so
[1:01:02] horrendous and so terrible
[1:01:04] that only those who have the holy ghost
[1:01:06] are going to be kept from it
[1:01:08] you're familiar with anybody raise their
[1:01:09] hand where brother bram says those
[1:01:10] things
[1:01:11] and you do you realize that in the very
[1:01:13] scriptures where the bible
[1:01:15] is talking about these things coming
[1:01:17] upon the earth
[1:01:19] that the reason why you're exempt from
[1:01:22] it
[1:01:23] it's not just because you have the holy
[1:01:25] ghost but because all those who have the
[1:01:27] holy ghost have gone to the marriage
[1:01:28] supper of the lamb
[1:01:30] it's like how come i didn't see that
[1:01:33] that's the reason why you don't have to
[1:01:34] worry about if you have the holy ghost
[1:01:36] and that's why if there's a plague if
[1:01:38] there's a disease
[1:01:40] whether it be covet 19 or covet 20
[1:01:44] or whatever's next they said listen i'm
[1:01:47] not afraid of this as if
[1:01:48] this is some kind of litmus test as to
[1:01:50] whether or not i'm a believer
[1:01:52] you know how i know a believer i believe
[1:01:53] god's word i believe what he said in
[1:01:55] this hour i've seen
[1:01:56] i've seen him manifested in this day
[1:01:58] that's the litmus test
[1:02:00] is i believe his word i say amen to the
[1:02:02] word not whether or not i succumb to
[1:02:03] some disease
[1:02:04] whether or not my life is free from
[1:02:05] trial whether or not my wife leaves me
[1:02:07] whether
[1:02:08] those things aren't the evidence god has
[1:02:11] given us one evidence you amen the word
[1:02:13] of god for this day
[1:02:14] you recognize the word that's been
[1:02:15] revealed in this day
[1:02:17] and all these things that the devil
[1:02:18] tries to build to create this fear and
[1:02:20] this paranoia
[1:02:21] i say we stay with the word of god and
[1:02:23] not tend to paranoia tend to fanaticism
[1:02:27] very things that we could find in the
[1:02:28] scripture that speak about these things
[1:02:30] being poured out
[1:02:31] it actually says that these things have
[1:02:32] come upon the people
[1:02:34] but the bride has been called away to
[1:02:36] the marriage supper
[1:02:37] of the lamb and that's why we that's why
[1:02:40] we're exempt from it
[1:02:42] all those that have the holy ghost are
[1:02:43] somewhere else
[1:02:47] furthermore the elect will not only be
[1:02:49] kept
[1:02:51] but as this move becomes the image
[1:02:53] erected to the beast in other words
[1:02:55] what happens and look away to jesus
[1:02:56] brother abraham says
[1:02:58] what's coming when that time comes he
[1:03:02] says not only is the bride going to be
[1:03:03] kept
[1:03:04] she'll be gone in the rapture amen
[1:03:07] that's the third pool
[1:03:10] that's what that's what we're believing
[1:03:11] in i'd like to touch on it more in
[1:03:14] greater detail maybe the sunday
[1:03:16] you just keep praying you just keep
[1:03:18] asking god to meet your spiritual needs
[1:03:21] but the death that the the last plague
[1:03:24] that strikes the church is spiritual
[1:03:26] death
[1:03:26] amen if there's a plague
[1:03:30] that's going to take physical life that
[1:03:31] strikes the whole world you're gone
[1:03:33] right but the battle you overcome
[1:03:36] in the plague you defeat is spiritual
[1:03:38] death
[1:03:40] because in the end it's only the bride
[1:03:41] that's spiritually alive
[1:03:44] so it's a spiritual plague it's a
[1:03:45] spiritual battle thank god for the
[1:03:48] opening of the word
[1:03:49] to give us life
[1:03:55] as paul said as we read in second
[1:03:56] corinthians chapter one
[1:03:58] verses eight to ten he says for we would
[1:04:01] not brethren have you ignorant of our
[1:04:02] trouble which came to us in asia
[1:04:05] this is when we read from timothy before
[1:04:07] he says yeah we've had some difficulty
[1:04:09] this is it and we were pressed out of
[1:04:11] measure
[1:04:12] this is paul's word we are pressed out
[1:04:15] of measure thereby says when that press
[1:04:16] comes to a place to where you're pressed
[1:04:18] out
[1:04:18] pressed out of measure above strength in
[1:04:20] so much that we despaired even of life
[1:04:24] but we had the sentence of death in
[1:04:26] ourselves that we should not
[1:04:28] trust in ourselves but in god
[1:04:32] which raiseth the dead now why did paul
[1:04:35] believe that
[1:04:37] because he knew what god where he said
[1:04:39] he had to go
[1:04:41] paul knew that he had to get to rome
[1:04:44] paul knew there was a place that he was
[1:04:45] going
[1:04:45] paul knew that he was on an ordained
[1:04:47] path
[1:04:48] he had thus saith the lord he knew he
[1:04:50] had to get there
[1:04:51] and if something was going to intervene
[1:04:53] in the interim he's like well even if i
[1:04:54] die he's got to raise me up again
[1:04:57] so it wasn't that death had this such a
[1:04:59] great power over him he's like oh no if
[1:05:01] i die what's going to happen he's like
[1:05:02] if i die
[1:05:03] god has to raise me from the dead now
[1:05:06] that's paul's testimony
[1:05:08] and paul was going to be he was martyred
[1:05:10] and then those early believers they
[1:05:12] faced martyrdom
[1:05:13] and that's what they were anointed to do
[1:05:16] but we have not been called to martyrdom
[1:05:20] we have not been called to have to face
[1:05:22] death
[1:05:24] and give our lives as an oxen and be
[1:05:27] that sacrifice that would give our lives
[1:05:29] for what we believe
[1:05:30] though some may be called to do it
[1:05:32] that's not the spirit on this age that's
[1:05:34] not what the bride collective is going
[1:05:36] to face but verse 10 then we can take to
[1:05:39] heart
[1:05:39] about god who did who delivered us
[1:05:42] from so great at death so paul says i
[1:05:45] trusted in the god and now he testifies
[1:05:47] who delivered us
[1:05:48] from so great to death and doth deliver
[1:05:52] in whom we trust that he will yet
[1:05:55] deliver
[1:05:56] us it's a god who hath delivered
[1:05:59] a god who doth deliver and a god who
[1:06:01] will yet deliver us
[1:06:03] death has no hold over the believer
[1:06:06] the the specter of death the threat of
[1:06:08] death the threat of some sort of
[1:06:10] suffering and calamity or famine or
[1:06:12] trial or hurt or persecution
[1:06:14] or being left forsaken none of that
[1:06:16] holds any power of the believer
[1:06:18] because even death itself has lost its
[1:06:20] power over you
[1:06:23] because he delivers that's why i can say
[1:06:26] you're made for this
[1:06:28] no matter what it is god has spoken
[1:06:30] something over you
[1:06:32] and you can take it god bless you let's
[1:06:34] stand
[1:06:38] if the lord would will may perhaps
[1:06:43] look further into some of these things
[1:06:48] but do you do you know some peace like a
[1:06:50] river joy like a
[1:06:52] fountain kfc
[1:07:01] if our heads bowed let's just go to the
[1:07:03] lord in prayer i
[1:07:04] i know it's a wednesday night and
[1:07:06] there's
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:08] school in the morning and work and so
[1:07:10] many different demands on our time
[1:07:12] so much pressure if there's any way we
[1:07:15] can be of help to you let us know even
[1:07:16] if it's just through prayer
[1:07:18] there's a family who a sister just
[1:07:20] experienced a car accident we pray that
[1:07:22] god would be with her
[1:07:24] this request for brother michael's niece
[1:07:27] asking god just to be merciful in that
[1:07:29] need
[1:07:30] sister ruth brother elias god would have
[1:07:33] mercy on him we believe that's why we
[1:07:36] pray
[1:07:38] we're not praying praying in a way of
[1:07:40] just kind of hoping
[1:07:41] we know our prayers hit the target and
[1:07:44] we commit it to god
[1:07:46] if you have a need tonight you just
[1:07:47] bring your need before the lord even in
[1:07:48] your heart and in your prayers
[1:07:50] our gracious heavenly father lord as we
[1:07:53] stand before you tonight
[1:07:57] having taken this journey into the word
[1:08:01] i pray that you would bring the proper
[1:08:02] balance to these things
[1:08:05] and lord that if there be a an emphasis
[1:08:08] that you would desire may you
[1:08:10] grant it i realized for me as a minister
[1:08:13] i could read things and study things
[1:08:15] uh things be quickened to me and i in
[1:08:18] things i've experienced an
[1:08:20] advantage point that i have and i can
[1:08:22] share it from that vantage point
[1:08:25] but lord i i'm not trying to share my
[1:08:28] view that they would
[1:08:28] see it my way but what i want to share
[1:08:32] the word as you have said it
[1:08:35] so they could see it your way and lord i
[1:08:38] pray that you would help just take these
[1:08:39] things and melt them together and make
[1:08:41] them one and fuse them
[1:08:43] to realize that father we would be doing
[1:08:45] you a disservice to say ah there's no
[1:08:47] persecution ah there's no tightening
[1:08:49] there's no squeeze
[1:08:50] as brother brown said there was
[1:08:54] he said there would be something
[1:08:57] and lord we wouldn't want to be
[1:08:58] completely dismissive of it
[1:09:01] likewise lord we don't want to be
[1:09:02] dismissive of what it was he was
[1:09:03] pointing us to when he was talking about
[1:09:05] these things
[1:09:07] that you are here revealing yourself
[1:09:09] you're making yourself known
[1:09:12] so father i pray that above all you
[1:09:15] would help us to
[1:09:16] tie ourselves to this absolute
[1:09:19] join ourselves to the word feed on this
[1:09:22] message
[1:09:23] yield to the holy spirit take into our
[1:09:26] bosom these great truths in this hour
[1:09:29] for lord they are not leading us to a
[1:09:30] grave but they're leading us to a change
[1:09:33] and that's my prayer father that you
[1:09:34] would lead us to a meeting in the air by
[1:09:36] this word that we're feeding on
[1:09:38] recognizing that this translation of the
[1:09:40] bride it's this word that's in us
[1:09:43] this body is going to form around the
[1:09:45] word that's already in us
[1:09:47] it's already been activated so father i
[1:09:50] pray that this would help settle us
[1:09:52] it helps give us a stronger resolve to
[1:09:55] face the difficulties that are ahead
[1:09:58] that we would not be quick to speculate
[1:09:59] about what's to come
[1:10:02] lord the bible even says it's a time and
[1:10:03] everyone's like oh peace safety
[1:10:05] everything's great everything's
[1:10:06] wonderful
[1:10:07] and then sudden destruction comes
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:10] could it be lord that we're going to
[1:10:12] enter into a season where everyone
[1:10:13] thinks that everything's wonderful
[1:10:16] people slack off and they get
[1:10:17] comfortable the economic
[1:10:20] continue well the social unrest is kind
[1:10:23] of
[1:10:23] just finds its balance and the
[1:10:25] instigators and the agitators are out of
[1:10:27] view and
[1:10:28] everything just kind of gets back to
[1:10:29] normal again and the world's economy
[1:10:32] stabilized and
[1:10:33] the whole world just seems to enter into
[1:10:35] a peaceable season
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:38] lord how foolish we would be as your
[1:10:41] bride to get complacent then
[1:10:45] and lord if we would be foolish to get
[1:10:46] complacent because things
[1:10:48] get peaceful lord we be foolish now to
[1:10:52] wait for things to get
[1:10:55] difficult and hard to get serious about
[1:10:57] this message
[1:10:59] may we now lord be more sincere may we
[1:11:02] now father
[1:11:04] want to do better i pray lord you to
[1:11:07] help us to do so
[1:11:09] i ask that you'd comfort the people in
[1:11:12] this church and their loved ones and
[1:11:13] their family
[1:11:15] comfort our sister churches the
[1:11:17] believers lord around the world who
[1:11:18] suffer great affliction
[1:11:21] brothers in jail in china ministers
[1:11:24] imprisoned in iran
[1:11:26] doors closing in turkey
[1:11:29] fearful things happen in egypt threats
[1:11:31] in france lord we realize that
[1:11:34] very quickly message believers could
[1:11:36] come under a microscope
[1:11:37] of some terrorist become the subject of
[1:11:40] some hate law
[1:11:42] find ourselves on the wrong side of some
[1:11:44] legislation
[1:11:45] we realize that's always possible lord
[1:11:48] may we not wait till the time when the
[1:11:50] bible's taken out of our hand
[1:11:52] if it would be lord may we not wait for
[1:11:53] the time that a lock would be placed on
[1:11:55] the door
[1:11:56] to try to get serious because could it
[1:11:57] be lord before it comes to that
[1:12:01] the bride is already gone in a rapture
[1:12:03] so i pray lord you'd guess
[1:12:05] help us to do those things which are
[1:12:07] proper
[1:12:08] in your sight those things that are
[1:12:10] pleasing lord and comfort comfort lord
[1:12:12] comfort the people
[1:12:14] i ask in the name of the lord jesus
[1:12:16] christ amen
[1:12:18] peace
