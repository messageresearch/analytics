[0:01] as follows
[0:08] but seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[0:11] his righteousness and all these things
[0:12] shall be added unto you
[0:16] God bless you this morning
[0:18] you may be seated
[0:24] this morning God's inspired me to speak
[0:27] just a little
[0:29] um
[0:31] just a little about my testimony
[0:36] of what God's allowed me to go through
[0:38] this last year
[0:39] God is a strange God
[0:43] we have a strange God
[0:48] [Music]
[0:50] many times when you have to preach
[0:55] I was telling my brother Marcos in the
[0:57] back
[1:00] to preach gives me much stress
[1:05] not because it's difficult to stand up
[1:07] and speak
[1:10] because I believe my desire is always
[1:16] to bring forth something according to
[1:18] God's perfect will
[1:21] that first of all would help me
[1:24] and help the audience in which I'm
[1:26] speaking to
[1:29] [Music]
[1:32] idiots and God
[1:36] he'll inspire you in different ways
[1:42] [Music]
[1:46] about four or five months ago
[1:54] I started to talk to God
[1:59] I didn't feel close to God
[2:04] and with that being said I'd come
[2:06] Wednesdays and Sundays to church
[2:11] what's wrong with me
[2:15] assistant from God no
[2:17] no
[2:21] I felt as though I lost the communion
[2:23] with God
[2:28] and I started to cry out in My Heart
[2:31] Lord return back unto me
[2:35] I even lost the drive the desire
[2:41] to listen to the tapes
[2:43] the messages
[2:49] yes Brothers
[2:51] I I wasn't being precautious
[2:57] and I started to analyze my life
[3:02] and I started to cry out for months
[3:05] return unto me
[3:07] allow me
[3:11] for the desire to be close to you to
[3:13] come back to my heart
[3:15] to walk Close to You Lord
[3:18] and I look back to my house
[3:22] onto my family
[3:24] foreign
[3:40] I can't go and exceed my family to walk
[3:43] a hundred percent as a Christian
[3:46] when Mia is the head of that home is are
[3:49] not is not doing it
[3:52] and a cry started within my heart
[3:57] and I started then I saw
[4:00] problems over here
[4:03] problems over there
[4:08] I know God doesn't fail
[4:12] God he has his promises
[4:16] we're the ones that fail
[4:21] Senor Lord
[4:23] I need you
[4:30] my wife can't reach a spiritual level
[4:34] my son can't reach a spiritual level
[4:40] if me as the head is not at a spiritual
[4:42] level that I need to be at
[4:46] I am the head of this household
[4:52] and I've got to live a life
[4:56] we've been taught by this message
[5:00] it's better to live a life
[5:02] than to preach it
[5:08] reading the Bible
[5:10] even when Paul says
[5:15] because I've brought into your gospel
[5:18] not just words but of power
[5:23] and I don't have that power Lord
[5:27] maybe I have the gospel and I'm full of
[5:30] words but what good is it to me
[5:32] if the devil's taken away with my family
[5:37] and many times the devil taking away
[5:40] your family it's not that he takes it
[5:41] unto the world
[5:45] but you're not guiding them by the word
[5:47] of God
[5:51] if we are as uh
[5:55] went to go get some medical exams
[5:59] and God he's so strange
[6:02] I've learned like this
[6:05] we've got to be careful
[6:08] how we ask God for things
[6:13] Senor Lord
[6:16] one thing that I'm assured
[6:19] I'm tired of being a Christian
[6:24] that walks by the will
[6:26] your permissive will
[6:29] Cristiano I want to be a Christian
[6:33] there walks by the perfect will
[6:36] you know
[6:38] I don't want to continue by your
[6:40] permissive will
[6:44] I want to continue in your perfect will
[6:46] Lord
[6:48] but I need your help
[6:51] look Brothers
[6:54] and I've learned
[6:55] be careful
[7:00] you better be sure of what you're asking
[7:03] God when you ask him
[7:05] because God's perfect will
[7:10] it's completely different to your will
[7:14] are we sure
[7:17] many times we
[7:21] neces we're like those people that they
[7:24] need a driver Lord
[7:28] guide me by your perfect will
[7:32] and then we sit in the back of that car
[7:35] we give the steering wheel to God
[7:39] starts to drive
[7:43] but we want to keep telling them where
[7:45] to turn
[7:47] we want to tell him when to stop
[7:50] yes Brothers
[7:54] so we don't want God's perfect will
[7:57] the only thing that we want
[8:01] is to just deceive ourselves
[8:04] no somos
[8:07] we're not God's GPS
[8:14] if you're going to surrender your life
[8:16] to God's perfect will
[8:18] that's just like the airplane
[8:21] that little light turns on
[8:23] to put you to put your belt on
[8:27] because some turbulence is coming
[8:32] so you better be sure
[8:37] Medical
[8:41] I I went to go just get a routine
[8:43] medical exam
[8:47] and many things came about
[8:53] uh
[8:54] fatty liver
[9:00] high cholesterol
[9:06] I was suffering from uh uh pressure in
[9:10] my arteries me
[9:15] my heart rate was very low
[9:21] it would drop to about 39.40 in the
[9:24] evenings when I'm asleep
[9:26] we
[9:29] I went and well Brothers
[9:32] when I got out of there I said what did
[9:34] I even come for
[9:38] eign
[9:40] I left with the list of medications
[9:48] and I remember I got into my vehicle
[9:53] forgive me
[9:58] I know that I asked to be closer to thee
[10:01] yesterday
[10:02] but if this is your way
[10:07] help me
[10:09] and yes I got a little frightened
[10:15] because my liver the levels of my liver
[10:17] they were very high
[10:21] the doctor told me
[10:23] you've got to go to the liver specialist
[10:26] with the heart specialist
[10:29] I said okay
[10:35] that's when God started to deal with me
[10:38] that's when I noticed
[10:42] I just had a gospel of words
[10:47] why couldn't present myself before God
[10:51] how could I ask of him
[10:54] if I even turned around
[10:59] weeks that I'd pay my tithes and weeks
[11:01] that I wouldn't pay my tithes
[11:08] because we don't pay our tithes to God
[11:12] we give back to God what belongs to him
[11:17] even in that I was failing
[11:22] Lord as the leader of this family I'm
[11:24] just a disaster
[11:27] but I ask one thing of you
[11:31] I want to make a covenant with you
[11:38] help me to get through this Lord
[11:43] then I noticed one thing
[11:49] Maybe
[11:51] Poco the devil he deceived me a little
[11:55] then when I moved from Texas to Arizona
[11:59] I fell into a certain depression
[12:03] then myself I just didn't want to accept
[12:05] yes
[12:07] and that's what the devil loves
[12:12] for us not to accept our conditions
[12:15] because if you and I don't recognize our
[12:18] condition
[12:19] we're not going to ask for help
[12:28] so then as I was thinking Senor Lord
[12:32] help me
[12:35] I know that I've asked something of you
[12:38] for you to give back
[12:40] the desire to be close today
[12:44] brother when I was diagnosed with all
[12:46] those things
[12:49] at that moment I got a little scared but
[12:51] now I turn around
[12:54] that diagnosis was a blessing
[12:59] I got closer to God since then
[13:02] [Music]
[13:07] a sickness came to me
[13:13] I used to weigh 232 pounds
[13:17] now I weigh 186.
[13:22] a sickness Came Upon me
[13:24] yeah
[13:27] reflux raw reflux I'm sorry
[13:31] a reflux that caused me to not be able
[13:33] to eat there were nights
[13:37] that I felt as though I wasn't going to
[13:39] wake up
[13:41] from my own reflux I was gonna drown
[13:44] ing
[13:46] and I continue to feel without that
[13:48] power
[13:53] and the more that I felt that maybe my
[13:55] time was coming
[14:00] that got me getting closer and closer to
[14:02] God
[14:03] and I started to meditate upon one thing
[14:09] where I couldn't fall asleep
[14:12] Lord what is it that I'm doing wrong
[14:15] what am I doing wrong here
[14:19] help me to discover what I'm doing wrong
[14:24] and then the scripture came to my mind
[14:27] the second scripture that we just read
[14:31] seek ye first the kingdom of God
[14:36] and everything all things shall be added
[14:38] unto you
[14:39] Lord forgive me
[14:42] it's true I moved to Texas
[14:46] searching for the financial things
[14:50] all these years
[14:53] it's been my priority
[14:57] sadly as a Christian
[14:59] though I believe
[15:02] that I already had a real experience
[15:05] with you
[15:14] I'm a relationship that I had with you
[15:19] and from then on
[15:22] yes
[15:24] that doesn't leave my heart or my mind
[15:27] to seek first the kingdom of God
[15:34] I have the Holy Ghost
[15:39] the Holy Ghost is going to help you
[15:42] control your riches
[15:47] and all the Temptations that come along
[15:49] with that
[15:52] I would meditate upon all those things
[15:55] and what if God would have blessed me
[15:58] in this condition that I was in
[16:02] would I be able to resist all those
[16:04] Temptations
[16:10] without his holy ghost close to me
[16:14] but I don't have anything Senor Lord
[16:18] the only thing that I've got is
[16:21] your Holy Spirit today
[16:25] and even in poverty he's given me
[16:30] he's my comforter
[16:33] he promised to give me enough for every
[16:37] day but I forgot about that
[16:41] he didn't promise to give me riches
[16:45] not that he cannot give it to me
[16:49] but
[16:51] he never made that promise to me
[16:56] and many times I went in search of that
[16:59] much
[17:03] many years I spent searching for the
[17:06] things he'd add on instead of the
[17:08] Kingdom
[17:14] e well Brothers
[17:18] I remember one evening because
[17:27] I remember I walked from the living room
[17:29] to my bedroom and my wife would be
[17:31] asleep
[17:36] and if and if I call 911
[17:40] to come and help me
[17:45] or if I wake up my wife and we go to the
[17:48] emergency room because the hospital is
[17:49] nearby
[17:52] and I was in that condition for many
[17:55] hours
[17:57] until suddenly
[17:59] something came to me
[18:04] and what if I want to I want you to die
[18:09] you're in the best hospital
[18:13] even if you're in the best hospital
[18:14] you're going to die
[18:16] forgive me again Lord I failed you again
[18:21] I'm trusting in the hospital
[18:23] I'm trusted in an institution
[18:32] Assurance in my heart
[18:35] I'm not saying that it's bad to go to a
[18:37] hospital
[18:42] I believe everyone has to make their own
[18:44] decisions
[18:47] everyone has to be responsible
[18:50] for the consequences
[18:53] of your decisions
[18:56] there's many Christians
[18:59] they love to ask for advice
[19:02] so that afterwards if something wrong
[19:04] happens
[19:05] they can go blame the one they gave him
[19:08] the advice
[19:09] yes
[19:13] no no
[19:15] responsible every one of us are
[19:18] responsible
[19:21] now it's very good to have someone that
[19:23] can give us advice but at the end of the
[19:26] day
[19:27] you've got to be sure
[19:30] that you're the one that has to make the
[19:33] decision
[19:35] because you're going to suffer the
[19:37] consequences of that decision
[19:42] mm-hmm
[19:43] Osa foreign I remember that night it
[19:47] just came and passed
[19:49] I remember what I said
[19:52] I remember what brother Brandon said
[19:56] we can't do anything
[19:58] but
[20:03] the devil can't do anything more than
[20:05] what God allows him to
[20:07] sign if it's not my time to die okay
[20:14] so I don't go to a hospital I'm not
[20:16] gonna die tonight
[20:19] and from there God started to lift me up
[20:23] and if it's my time to die
[20:27] whether I'd be surrounded by all the
[20:29] specialists
[20:31] it's
[20:32] the time that God's prepared for me
[20:36] the only thing I told God
[20:39] I don't know Lord
[20:41] if it's my time or not but
[20:43] don't allow me to go
[20:46] without being able to have another
[20:48] experience with you
[20:52] and then there are began Brothers
[20:56] every time
[21:00] they've given me pills for my reflux
[21:03] I made the decision
[21:06] to no longer take them
[21:10] every time that acid reflux would come
[21:14] on I'd run to the pills
[21:16] and I grabbed that bottle
[21:21] and I remember what God Said through the
[21:24] prophet
[21:26] God can't do anything more
[21:29] the god the devil can't do anything more
[21:30] than what God allows him
[21:32] and I put that bottle right back down
[21:36] and I'd run to the bedroom to pray
[21:40] brothers and pray and pray
[21:43] until that pain would go
[21:50] one or two days later
[21:52] again
[21:55] and
[21:57] once I heard
[22:03] I remember I was going with my child
[22:06] and we were going into the lake
[22:11] I was listening to a song about David
[22:13] and Goliath Como how
[22:16] um
[22:18] when Goliath challenges God's people
[22:23] and tells them
[22:26] choose amongst all of you
[22:29] the best soldier that you've got
[22:33] and send him
[22:36] but but yes
[22:39] the one that overcomes
[22:43] or the one that loses
[22:45] is going to be a servant of the winner
[22:49] I said Lord
[22:53] I felt such security
[22:57] I just confronted my Goliath is
[23:02] I don't want to be a slave no more to
[23:04] any illness
[23:06] the devil's just a big blood fur
[23:10] mucho and for many years
[23:14] I've been
[23:16] serving him
[23:19] foreign
[23:24] in front of every challenge that the
[23:26] devil would shoot at me
[23:28] and that's how it is with the Devil
[23:34] if he overcomes
[23:37] you're going to be a slave to what he's
[23:40] challenging you with
[23:42] Diablo
[23:45] the devil also doesn't change his way of
[23:48] how he operates
[23:51] many times that's the problem with us
[23:53] Christians
[23:55] that sometimes we forget
[23:58] that the Bible also shows us
[24:00] the devil's way of acting
[24:05] and we don't pay attention to that many
[24:08] times
[24:11] the the challenges come
[24:16] in the Bible there's everything
[24:20] in the message
[24:29] so then the god began
[24:34] and he got me closer and closer
[24:39] he healed me of the reflux
[24:44] ion arterial he healed me from the the
[24:47] artery pressure the pressure in my
[24:49] arteries
[24:53] it's been about three to four months
[24:55] that I don't take medication for my
[24:57] arteries
[24:59] no
[25:03] he healed me from my liver
[25:07] because once I lost that weight
[25:11] I went to the liver specialist
[25:14] and told me did you lose weight
[25:18] he said there's no problem
[25:20] normally it takes about two to three
[25:22] months
[25:23] for for the exams to come out
[25:29] come back later to have those exams but
[25:31] everything's gonna be okay
[25:34] then when I went to the specialist
[25:41] the heart specialist are you video
[25:45] mediotra
[25:48] was
[25:49] God gave me and I'll say it like this
[25:51] another Faith vaccine
[25:58] um
[26:01] when I sat down with the doctor they
[26:03] sent me there because of my heart rate
[26:06] because it was so low
[26:08] and she told me Nicole okay
[26:13] well I just read the hit
[26:16] I just read your family history
[26:19] it says right here your older sister
[26:24] when she was young
[26:27] she had open heart surgery and that's
[26:30] why
[26:33] you have the the you run the risk of
[26:34] having a heart attack
[26:36] yesterday you've got to take this this
[26:39] this this and this medication
[26:42] I said but I didn't come for that
[26:46] I just came because my heart rate is
[26:48] very low
[26:49] oh I'm not really worried about that
[26:55] about that well why am I worried about
[26:57] it
[27:01] and when she was telling me all of that
[27:04] something inside of me Brothers said
[27:08] don't accept that
[27:09] don't take that medication
[27:15] I didn't tell the doctor anything but
[27:19] within my heart I didn't accept it
[27:24] I haven't taken none of the medication
[27:26] that she gave me
[27:28] I've take I've been taking more Medicaid
[27:31] medication
[27:32] or more vitamins
[27:34] vitamin f
[27:38] God's helping me
[27:41] even just reading the message
[27:44] brother Branham says
[27:51] that it won't once he
[27:53] is he was sick
[27:59] and now I'm going back to God's perfect
[28:01] will
[28:03] in
[28:05] over us
[28:08] he speaks it here in faith without works
[28:10] is dead
[28:11] he said that for eight years
[28:14] he struggled with the illness
[28:17] where he couldn't eat
[28:22] for eight years
[28:27] he said he turned around
[28:30] and he'd see those that were around him
[28:32] now they ate
[28:36] that he desired
[28:37] but he couldn't eat
[28:40] after those eight years God healed him
[28:46] and what does that do to me
[28:49] I start to meditate upon this
[28:52] that sometimes
[28:56] I want God's answer quickly
[29:03] I want God to answer me from one day to
[29:06] the next
[29:09] if a servant of God
[29:12] had to struggle for eight years
[29:17] Abraham had to wait for 25 years
[29:24] so that who am I forgot to answer me
[29:26] immediately
[29:32] God has to test our faith
[29:36] foreign
[29:38] I've learned this and this has also
[29:40] helped me
[29:41] is
[29:43] I've been meditating a lot upon my own
[29:46] life
[29:47] when I started
[29:54] there's three three reasons why one has
[29:55] to examine their own life
[29:59] at least the ones that I've learned
[30:01] through the Bible
[30:02] what you're going through
[30:05] the first
[30:07] what happened to job
[30:10] God was testing him
[30:13] to prove to the devil that he was the
[30:16] son of God
[30:20] the second
[30:22] is that man
[30:25] that was blind
[30:28] he said well who sin him or his parents
[30:31] well no one did
[30:34] so the God's glory could be manifested
[30:39] foreign
[30:46] to go through certain things
[30:49] so God's glory can be manifest to others
[30:53] then why are we complaining
[31:05] what a good child of God we are
[31:07] [Music]
[31:10] though sometimes what happened to job
[31:12] happens to us
[31:15] uh we we get into this form
[31:17] s
[31:26] uh attorney oh we we accuse God
[31:33] and we put God
[31:36] in in the the accusations Lord
[31:42] get up there
[31:44] and I'm going to start to ask
[31:47] why is this that's happening to me
[31:50] happening to me
[31:52] who gave us that right
[32:00] to put God
[32:03] in that sea of accusation you know and
[32:07] one
[32:08] wants to start to ask
[32:12] don't you want God's perfect will
[32:17] then why are you asking me
[32:21] but okay but okay
[32:25] remember that after me it's going to be
[32:27] your turn
[32:30] isn't that what happened to job
[32:34] when God started to ask him
[32:37] well where were you
[32:41] who were we
[32:44] I said
[32:46] 45 years ago
[32:48] I was no one
[32:50] I didn't even exist on this Earth
[32:57] how can I start to claim unto God
[33:03] I'm nobody
[33:05] I'm just a servant of his
[33:09] but the other thing
[33:11] is
[33:13] what happened in Jericho Brothers
[33:23] because of sin
[33:28] because of breaking God's laws
[33:31] there was evil
[33:35] and that's what happened to me
[33:38] when I started to examine my life
[33:43] remember one thing
[33:46] we serve a jealous God
[33:50] we can't play games with god
[33:54] with God we can't be Christians today
[33:57] and not tomorrow
[33:59] I've heard many brothers say
[34:09] and sometimes I've been able to work
[34:11] with Brothers
[34:15] sometimes the owners they make a mistake
[34:18] being that they're Christians
[34:21] they say
[34:24] the church is one thing and business is
[34:27] another
[34:28] communication
[34:30] what can a Christian say that
[34:37] Christian whether in church or at your
[34:39] business
[34:43] you can't separate the things of God
[34:45] from where you're at
[34:47] foreign
[34:50] and sometimes we make those mistakes
[34:53] we want to put God
[34:56] into certain places
[34:59] and say wait here when I get to this
[35:02] place I'll be a Christian
[35:05] but over here I have to be a businessman
[35:12] Above All Things
[35:16] We Should Be sons of God wherever we
[35:18] stand
[35:30] we do it in the name
[35:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:36] which is the Lord Jesus
[35:39] we can't separate
[35:42] adios God
[35:45] at any moment
[35:48] and the devil wants to deceive us like
[35:50] that sometimes
[35:51] that's when we start
[35:54] to separate ourselves
[36:04] God
[36:14] he's healed me for many things
[36:17] and I start to meditate upon the deity
[36:21] what is deity
[36:23] God in us
[36:28] Brothers but to get
[36:31] Pablo I I really like Paul
[36:35] o I love Paul
[36:38] I love brother Branham
[36:41] but I was reading
[36:43] and I've been studying the story of
[36:46] Abraham
[36:48] God made a covenant with Abraham
[36:53] and he was the god of Abraham
[36:55] but the moment came
[36:58] that he had to be the god of Isaac
[37:02] there had to be a moment
[37:05] that he had to be the god of Jacob
[37:11] and sometimes
[37:13] we stay
[37:19] to know that God
[37:22] he loves the deity
[37:24] Garden
[37:26] human flesh but it's so beautiful
[37:29] Brothers to see the Bible
[37:33] and believe that God was in Paul and God
[37:37] came
[37:40] and revealed himself in human flesh
[37:43] through the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:47] it's so beautiful we can believe it
[37:53] you know what's the most difficult part
[37:55] about deity
[38:02] how many of us can stand up and say
[38:05] I discovered one thing
[38:08] when the devil would challenge me
[38:15] I didn't have the power Brothers
[38:18] I couldn't say like Paul
[38:22] um
[38:24] I'd stay just in the gospel of words
[38:27] but now I can say
[38:32] I've got a gospel of power also
[38:36] but you know what I had to accept first
[38:38] the God was right here
[38:50] it's beautiful to understand God worked
[38:52] through brother Branham
[38:56] brother Branham says
[38:58] I was just reading it
[39:01] I've seen many people that they pray for
[39:03] the sick
[39:07] even my daughter of three years old
[39:09] she's prayed for the sick
[39:14] and I was just thinking
[39:16] Lord forgive me
[39:21] I've been at fault
[39:24] I've been guilty and many times
[39:27] I say that I believe in the deity
[39:33] many Christians we lie to ourselves we
[39:36] believe in the deity
[39:37] it's not true
[39:40] if you believed in deity
[39:45] you could pray at any moment for a sick
[39:47] person
[39:52] because you know that God is in you
[39:58] you could you'll say I know
[40:03] God's given everyone different gifts
[40:13] we should be
[40:16] paramedicos paramedics
[40:22] spiritually speaking
[40:26] a paramedic
[40:28] no it doesn't operate
[40:33] or do surgery he probably doesn't even
[40:36] know a lot about prescribing medication
[40:43] when someone is wounded
[40:46] like that's Samaritan
[40:51] he said that he took care of him he got
[40:54] him stable
[40:55] and then took him to the place to get
[40:58] help
[41:00] but many times we don't even want to
[41:02] take that job
[41:05] we are
[41:07] should be
[41:09] paramedics
[41:13] to be able to stabilize any person that
[41:16] needs us to help them
[41:19] don't we have a message that's been
[41:21] revealed unto us
[41:25] foreign
[42:00] we'll go to the Book of Genesis
[42:12] is
[42:24] let's go to Genesis Chapter 18 from 1 to
[42:28] 3.
[42:33] and in this scripture
[42:36] this is where many times we get
[42:38] conformed as Christians
[42:45] Genesis chapter 18 verse 1 to 3.
[42:48] and it reads
[42:59] questions
[43:08] Sierra
[43:17] and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[43:19] plains of memory and he sat in the tent
[43:21] Door In the Heat of the day and he lift
[43:23] up his eyes and looked and lo three men
[43:25] stood by him and when he saw them he ran
[43:28] to meet them at the tent door and bowed
[43:30] himself toward the ground and said my
[43:33] Lord if now I have found favor in thy
[43:35] sight pass not away I pray thee from thy
[43:38] servant
[43:41] and there was deity right there
[43:45] was God in human flesh
[43:49] foreign
[43:53] speaking
[43:55] with the deity
[44:00] you know that as I meditate upon that is
[44:04] God that's okay
[44:12] experience like that shouldn't be just
[44:13] enough
[44:14] I can't be confirmed with just seeing
[44:17] you
[44:19] before by before someone in my human
[44:22] flesh
[44:24] that's not the deity that I wanted me
[44:31] we see God working in someone else
[44:35] and we believe in deity
[44:38] there was deity
[44:41] Abraham having God face to face
[44:47] and many times we have that encounter
[44:50] with God and we're conformed to them
[44:54] we forget that we're in another age
[44:56] where God said that he would send the
[45:01] comforter
[45:03] the deity
[45:07] it's God in us
[45:10] they say this brother Branham says that
[45:16] when Abraham as
[45:18] Abraham truly
[45:21] he found God's real deity
[45:25] he says when God went to send him to
[45:28] sacrifice Isaac
[45:33] that was God in Abraham practicing
[45:38] what he was going to do with his son
[45:41] that was the true deity Brothers
[45:46] says God and Abraham
[45:49] practicing what later
[45:52] he was going to do with Jesus
[45:56] that's where I want to reach
[45:59] conformed
[46:03] with just seeing God in another human
[46:05] flesh which that's okay
[46:09] but I need him right here
[46:14] or else
[46:20] we're not a part of his
[46:22] Summit
[46:25] the Bible says
[46:31] the second coming of God
[46:35] would be like in the days of Sodom and
[46:37] Gomorrah
[46:39] I believe that we're already in those
[46:40] days
[46:43] and brothers
[46:46] they say the Bible says
[46:51] many wanted to live in our day
[47:11] and if we're living
[47:13] those days
[47:16] when I discovered this
[47:19] Brothers
[47:21] we're the Royal Seed of Abraham
[47:26] where the true Seed of Abraham
[47:31] and if we're Abraham's seed
[47:35] we have to act like him
[47:40] we're going to Genesis 18.
[47:46] 1817.
[47:53] and it reads
[48:00] and the Lord said shall I hide from
[48:03] Abraham that thing which I do
[48:10] there's a great treasure there
[48:12] I don't know if you see it
[48:16] I'm going to read the question once
[48:18] again
[48:20] Genesis 18 17.
[48:22] and the Lord said
[48:28] shall I hide from Abraham that thing
[48:31] which I do
[48:33] wasn't that the days of Sodom
[48:40] as God hid something from us today
[48:46] didn't he send us a powerful message
[48:51] God doesn't hear anything from us
[48:55] the same thing he did that day he's done
[48:59] it for us
[49:00] let's say
[49:04] hit something for me of what he's going
[49:06] to do
[49:08] no no
[49:11] no
[49:13] God has given us all Revelations
[49:16] but many but sometimes there's the
[49:18] problem
[49:20] this message I
[49:23] it creates many theologians
[49:27] many people
[49:31] they base themselves on theology well
[49:35] just see Brothers
[49:39] many maybe we don't have faith
[49:44] but we can preach upon any mystery of
[49:47] the Bible
[49:52] still haven't found the kingdom of God
[49:54] yet
[49:56] you know what the problem is
[49:59] that when we go sometimes
[50:02] and study the Mysteries
[50:07] and then to be able to find the kingdom
[50:10] of God becomes more of a mystery
[50:14] because you've got to understand
[50:18] that you're nothing
[50:22] and oh how it's so difficult
[50:25] to be able to accept
[50:27] that you're nothing
[50:31] seek ye first
[50:33] I know the kingdom of God
[50:37] and all things
[50:40] shall be added unto you but sometimes
[50:45] I've been searching or I was searching
[50:50] all those things added
[50:53] but not the kingdom of God
[50:57] God hasn't hit anything from us what do
[51:00] you want what do you need
[51:04] there's deity
[51:08] that's why
[51:13] every time that I come to church
[51:18] even in that regard God has changed
[51:21] the way that I come to church
[51:23] I come to worship God
[51:29] every time the song leader starts to
[51:31] sing
[51:33] I surrender to him
[51:36] doesn't the Bible not say
[51:39] that God dwells in worship
[51:44] so then
[51:48] I don't know who's next to me
[51:51] before well look just look at this
[51:54] even in that God's changed me
[51:57] before I used to care
[51:59] what are the people going to say about
[52:01] me if I stand up
[52:03] if I start to worship God
[52:08] maybe lifting up my hands is going to
[52:11] bother the guy behind me so Alto God may
[52:13] be tall
[52:16] maybe I won't allow the person behind me
[52:18] to see
[52:19] but you know Brothers
[52:21] now I just don't care
[52:26] the only thing that I know is that I
[52:30] worship my creator
[52:32] and that he dwelleth
[52:35] in the worship
[52:37] and if he dwells in the worship
[52:40] I want him to see me the best way
[52:42] possible
[52:46] and sometimes I put myself
[52:50] when I get to my house I dwell in my
[52:54] home
[52:55] and when I see my wife's face
[52:59] I know what what what uh mood she's in
[53:02] when I see my son
[53:05] just by his face
[53:09] I know if he's happy or not
[53:13] that's how it is in the worship
[53:15] I could imagine God
[53:18] in the worship and as he enters into
[53:20] worship
[53:22] Brothers
[53:25] looking at every single one of our faces
[53:28] foreign just with the face alone
[53:33] the one that he knows
[53:36] the one that knows the thoughts
[53:39] and what's inside of our hearts Brothers
[53:47] deity
[53:48] in every Christian in every Christian
[53:53] should be
[53:55] there should be the seven compound names
[53:58] of God in there
[53:59] Jehovah Jireh
[54:01] the Lord provided
[54:05] Jehovah Rapha
[54:07] is
[54:09] the Lord my healer
[54:12] I'm a witness of that
[54:15] what do you need
[54:17] there are those seven names
[54:20] but one thing
[54:22] yes yes
[54:24] that one is a Christian
[54:27] you have to accept and believe
[54:31] that God dwells in you
[54:35] God's in you second
[54:41] have you ever thought why God
[54:44] he told Brother Branham
[54:49] if you can make the people believe you
[54:53] there's a great mystery right there
[54:55] you and I said you think it's just for
[54:59] brother Branham who stay you're you and
[55:01] I the name we've got to do
[55:04] we've got to make the people believe us
[55:07] as as Christians brothers
[55:10] that's part of deity
[55:15] for the people to believe in us
[55:18] maybe they believe in God but they don't
[55:21] believe in you
[55:23] and that's blocking
[55:29] God can't act without a human vessel
[55:36] so even in that Brothers
[55:39] I've meditated upon that plenty help me
[55:42] Lord
[55:44] for the people to believe in me
[55:50] through his gospel
[55:54] they will be judged
[55:56] he didn't say by the Gospel of Jesus
[55:58] Christ
[55:59] said through his gospel
[56:02] deity
[56:09] even
[56:11] ly
[56:13] Lord help me
[56:15] I'm
[56:17] me Priority my priority
[56:21] it's two scriptures
[56:24] yes yes
[56:25] to be able to say
[56:28] if they don't believe me
[56:30] my words
[56:33] then look at my works
[56:37] and that will make them believe
[56:51] give me the gift of Miracles
[56:57] God gave me the order hola
[57:02] is
[57:04] the commission to go and preach the
[57:06] gospel
[57:07] and pray for the sick
[57:10] and why do we deny that
[57:17] and I discovered why I would deny myself
[57:20] because I didn't even believe in my own
[57:22] self
[57:25] yes that's the first thing
[57:30] how can God heal someone if you can't
[57:32] even believe in your own prayer
[57:37] second
[57:40] to make the people believe in you
[57:45] foreign
[57:48] one day we had a little discussion
[57:52] with a brother
[57:55] he would say is
[58:02] the people have an experience with God
[58:04] you have to go run out to the streets
[58:06] and preach the gospel
[58:09] no take it easy
[58:12] that's not according to the gospel
[58:17] because many times
[58:21] no that's not according to the Bible
[58:23] even if we go with Jesus
[58:26] when Jesus when he was baptized
[58:30] he received the Holy Spirit
[58:34] he didn't go out and preach
[58:39] he went 40 days and 40 nights to fast
[58:43] Pablo Paul
[58:46] he didn't go out and preach right away
[58:50] he went to go first seek the kingdom of
[58:52] God
[58:55] more so to make sure what he had found
[58:58] was the kingdom of God
[59:03] then
[59:08] I believe it's in second Peter where it
[59:11] says that the wives
[59:15] even with their composure
[59:19] they can make people be converted
[59:23] it doesn't say that they'll speak
[59:28] if you read there it doesn't say a
[59:30] single word about the wife having to
[59:32] speak
[59:33] this is just by her composure
[59:39] there are ways of preaching
[59:42] but we have to first believe in
[59:44] ourselves
[59:47] to be God servants
[59:52] to stop being Servants of that Goliath
[59:55] that's been oppressing us
[59:59] we're Servants of God Brothers
[1:00:02] what do we need
[1:00:06] Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:00:09] is the Jehovah
[1:00:12] that is Jesus of the New Testament
[1:00:17] I didn't too much use my notes
[1:00:24] God he's strange Brothers
[1:00:32] that's what I've learned
[1:00:37] you know
[1:00:41] you could say well you've been raised
[1:00:43] your whole life in the gospel
[1:00:46] yes
[1:00:47] but the Bible also says we're going from
[1:00:51] light to light and from glory to glory
[1:00:54] we're learning
[1:01:00] there's times where we've read
[1:01:01] scriptures for years
[1:01:04] like this about Abraham
[1:01:07] this is about Abraham I read it for many
[1:01:10] many times
[1:01:11] but I never seen that God had told him
[1:01:15] or God asked himself
[1:01:18] should I hit hide these things from
[1:01:20] Abraham
[1:01:24] Brothers
[1:01:27] said
[1:01:32] you've got to see yourself in every part
[1:01:34] of the scriptures
[1:01:38] I put myself into that right away I said
[1:01:41] Abraham I saw Abraham and I put myself
[1:01:44] there
[1:01:45] has God hit something for me if I'm
[1:01:48] wrong
[1:01:49] it's not because of God it's my fault
[1:01:52] look
[1:01:55] another one of the things that I found
[1:01:57] you
[1:01:59] how did promise the people of Israel
[1:02:02] and I want to close with this
[1:02:06] God promised the people of Israel
[1:02:10] that they'd be slaves for 400 years
[1:02:15] and then after that he'd get them out of
[1:02:16] Egypt
[1:02:18] that was a promise God already gave the
[1:02:21] people of Israel
[1:02:24] for how many years were they slaves
[1:02:27] 425. but even so
[1:02:31] apart from
[1:02:35] the fact that God already gave the
[1:02:37] promise to Abraham
[1:02:39] that he would rescue him
[1:02:41] that promise was already there
[1:02:45] it says
[1:02:49] until the people of God started to cry
[1:02:52] out
[1:02:54] that promise was already given it was
[1:02:57] already there
[1:02:58] God didn't make it effective until the
[1:03:02] people of God
[1:03:04] they started to cry out for the promise
[1:03:14] because I'm reminded of the promise
[1:03:17] for the Cry of my people Lord
[1:03:21] how many promises are in the Bible
[1:03:24] did I still haven't claims the promises
[1:03:28] are right there Brothers
[1:03:29] if you don't have this
[1:03:32] it's because you haven't claimed them
[1:03:34] yet
[1:03:38] those promises were already there
[1:03:42] the only thing
[1:03:45] claim them
[1:03:48] God already gave them to us
[1:03:52] yes Dan they're already there you got to
[1:03:55] believe it
[1:03:58] says
[1:04:00] because I remember
[1:04:03] God forget about the promise
[1:04:09] but the people of God yes
[1:04:12] because they were they weren't happy
[1:04:15] and it took them to believe
[1:04:18] that it was impossible for God to
[1:04:20] fulfill his promise
[1:04:22] how could God rescue them
[1:04:30] Army of the world
[1:04:34] the circumstances took them
[1:04:38] to not leave
[1:04:40] that they were God's people
[1:04:44] that's what happens to us
[1:04:48] the promise of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:52] it's already there
[1:04:56] many people don't have it
[1:04:58] because they don't claim it
[1:05:01] remember one thing
[1:05:05] Jesus once was walking
[1:05:08] he saw a tree yes
[1:05:13] it wasn't the season to give fruit
[1:05:16] but because of not having fruits God
[1:05:19] cursed it
[1:05:24] we're compared
[1:05:26] to trees
[1:05:29] and we've got to give fruits
[1:05:34] we've got to give fruits
[1:05:39] because we know that God doesn't like
[1:05:41] trees without fruits
[1:05:45] let us all stand Brothers
[1:06:09] I'm going to close with this small story
[1:06:12] of brother Branham
[1:06:16] when he went on his honeymoon
[1:06:18] when he got married the second time
[1:06:23] he said that he went into the mountain
[1:06:24] yeah what
[1:06:25] he took his wife
[1:06:28] they said that he got there
[1:06:31] you can find it
[1:06:34] and the message of seven compound names
[1:06:36] of God
[1:06:41] so he left behind as his wife and his
[1:06:44] his child his son
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:06:47] he took them
[1:06:49] on that honeymoon
[1:06:54] he said one day once they were there
[1:07:01] he started walking trying to uh chase
[1:07:03] that deer that he was going to hunt
[1:07:06] I believe you've heard the story already
[1:07:10] he kept walking and walking and hunting
[1:07:12] him
[1:07:16] once he now realized he was who knows
[1:07:18] how many miles away from where his wife
[1:07:19] was and his son
[1:07:23] and he said that a storm started to come
[1:07:30] but he trusted his own abilities
[1:07:36] that he can come back whenever he wanted
[1:07:40] because he felt himself to be an expert
[1:07:43] where he was at
[1:07:51] could have run into any danger
[1:07:53] he said that this storm came
[1:07:58] and he said that that storm came down
[1:08:01] he couldn't see
[1:08:03] he couldn't see good
[1:08:07] but even so he kept trusted in his own
[1:08:09] abilities
[1:08:19] and he said that he started to walk
[1:08:22] and walk
[1:08:25] he said he starts to walk in circles
[1:08:29] but he kept trusting in his abilities
[1:08:36] and he kept saying you can't be lost
[1:08:39] you can't be going through this
[1:08:42] you're an expert in this
[1:08:46] is
[1:08:49] he said that he tried to comfort his own
[1:08:51] self
[1:08:55] and something inside of him started to
[1:08:57] tell him you're lost
[1:09:00] and he kept trusting in his abilities
[1:09:03] I'm not lost
[1:09:05] I'm an expert
[1:09:07] I know how to get out of this
[1:09:11] is
[1:09:13] how many times have we been in that
[1:09:15] situation
[1:09:18] We Trust so much in our abilities
[1:09:23] are possibly all of our resources
[1:09:28] we think that our own selves
[1:09:32] we can get out of those problems
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:40] we can make things easier
[1:09:44] we keep trusting says
[1:09:51] he had to accept
[1:09:56] that
[1:09:59] he'd lost all of his abilities right
[1:10:01] there
[1:10:04] until he accepted
[1:10:07] that he lost all of his abilities
[1:10:11] understood
[1:10:25] that I knew the message
[1:10:28] that I preached
[1:10:32] I knew how to lead my wife I didn't know
[1:10:35] or I couldn't
[1:10:38] because I didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:10:41] [Music]
[1:10:43] maybe I knew
[1:10:45] but
[1:10:46] I was going to just do it religiously
[1:10:49] I wanted to put burdens
[1:10:52] that I wasn't even willing to take
[1:10:56] [Music]
[1:10:58] I kept trusting in my abilities
[1:11:02] until I had to accept
[1:11:06] that I was lost
[1:11:09] that I was going crazy
[1:11:11] [Music]
[1:11:15] that takes you to a place of crying out
[1:11:18] unto God
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:22] that's what happened to brother Branham
[1:11:23] in that moment so that he had to accept
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:28] that he was nothing
[1:11:33] except
[1:11:35] cry unto God
[1:11:38] put everything aside
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:42] the expert that he thought he was
[1:11:45] [Music]
[1:11:48] and surrender to God Brothers
[1:11:55] he had to make a decision
[1:11:57] of life or death
[1:12:02] because his wife and his son were
[1:12:04] running the risk of death
[1:12:07] and the more pressure he had
[1:12:14] he started to lose that notion more and
[1:12:16] more
[1:12:17] that's what sometimes happens to us
[1:12:20] the Daily pressure
[1:12:22] takes us to lose
[1:12:24] that are common sense
[1:12:27] faith
[1:12:30] but we keep thinking that we we can
[1:12:35] get out of that
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:39] like I tell people
[1:12:44] we want to change the rest of the people
[1:12:49] when who's been able to change their own
[1:12:51] selves
[1:12:53] no one
[1:12:57] he said it says
[1:13:00] until brother Branham
[1:13:03] accepted he didn't have any abilities he
[1:13:06] Cried unto God responded
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:11] then he remembered it made him remember
[1:13:15] about that wire
[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:18] he got hold of that wire
[1:13:20] and he started to walk yes
[1:13:26] was gonna take him to his wife and son
[1:13:28] were I asked myself what is a cable
[1:13:34] it's a conductor of energy
[1:13:40] that's sometimes what we need
[1:13:42] [Music]
[1:13:45] we need to get a hold of that conductor
[1:13:49] to take us
[1:13:52] to the place we need to go
[1:13:56] maybe not to say somebody's life
[1:13:59] but to save our own life
[1:14:02] [Music]
[1:14:06] that confusion that we're in
[1:14:09] one thing yes
[1:14:12] you first have to trust in yourself
[1:14:15] and Trust in the person that's going to
[1:14:18] pray for you
[1:14:19] or else
[1:14:21] it'll be difficult or else
[1:14:25] what is beautiful is it God give you
[1:14:28] faith I love that like that woman
[1:14:33] that
[1:14:35] blood issue
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:40] brother Branham says
[1:14:43] sometimes that's another problem with us
[1:14:45] we want
[1:14:47] to feel
[1:14:50] um
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:52] a great experience with God
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:14:57] no brothers
[1:14:59] simply and just accept him
[1:15:03] though you don't feel anything
[1:15:08] but one thing I do know
[1:15:11] brother Brandon said
[1:15:13] if you believe it
[1:15:15] then act as though you believe
[1:15:22] healed yes and that's true
[1:15:26] I started to declare my healing
[1:15:30] weeks before God gave me the healing
[1:15:34] but we say sometimes we're healed
[1:15:37] how are you a little sick
[1:15:40] how are you I am
[1:15:42] I'm getting just a little better
[1:15:45] no that's not acting like you believe
[1:15:49] how are you yeah I'm good
[1:15:53] God has blessed me
[1:15:58] I like a phrase that the apostolics have
[1:16:01] in Mexico
[1:16:02] when one asked the other how are you
[1:16:08] blessed and in Victory amen amen
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:15] that's what every Christian should
[1:16:17] answer
[1:16:20] possibly
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:25] you struggle
[1:16:28] is that
[1:16:31] blessing is from you to someone else
[1:16:35] let us pray
[1:16:37] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:40] I thank you this morning
[1:16:45] father first of all forgive our sins and
[1:16:48] our iniquities

[1:16:56] allow us Lord
[1:17:01] to be able to enter into that atmosphere
[1:17:03] Lord
[1:17:07] virtue to come out of your Holy Spirit

[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:14] that you would dwell in human bodies
[1:17:19] help us Lord
[1:17:22] to cleanse these temples
[1:17:26] foreign
