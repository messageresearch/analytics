[0:00] Philippians 2:12,
[0:02] the Bible says, "Wherefore, my beloved,
[0:05] as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
[0:08] presence only, but now much more in my
[0:12] absence, work out your own fa salvation
[0:15] with fear and trembling." Amen. You may
[0:18] be seated.
[0:20] What a um simple scripture, but but
[0:23] Paul's commending uh the Philippian
[0:26] believers for their obedience. And he's
[0:28] saying, "Well, your your obedience and
[0:31] and your faithfulness is not only when
[0:33] I'm around. You know, it's easy to
[0:35] become a really good saint when the
[0:36] pastor's around, right? Or when we're in
[0:39] church and that's when we're at our
[0:40] best. That's where we have the n best
[0:43] suit and ties and the dresses and
[0:45] everything." And we just we just look
[0:47] the part. We look really good. But he's
[0:50] saying, "Not only in my presence, now
[0:53] much more in my absence." And then he
[0:56] says, "In my absence, work out your own
[0:59] salvation."
[1:01] So this is a a thing where it's an
[1:04] individual affair.
[1:07] It's um you know I I have a lot of
[1:09] friends that they go to church. They go
[1:11] to CCV and they go to all these great
[1:14] churches and they're over there drinking
[1:16] coffee and eating a donut while they're
[1:18] praising the Lord and it looks like
[1:20] they're they're looking at a band play
[1:21] and it it's something spectacular, you
[1:24] know, and oh, I go to church, but when
[1:26] they're outside of church, you wouldn't
[1:28] even know that they know Jesus Christ,
[1:30] right? Because they're acting completely
[1:32] different. But Paul, he's telling these
[1:34] people, he's saying, "Even outside of my
[1:36] presence, even when I'm not there, even
[1:38] when we don't have Sunday service or
[1:40] Wednesday service," he says, "Work out
[1:42] your own salvation."
[1:44] He's saying, "Just as you have obeyed,
[1:46] not only in my presence, but outside of
[1:48] my presence, work out your salvation."
[1:52] Brother Brandham, um, I'm going to quote
[1:54] a lot of Brother Brandham in this
[1:55] message. This is a very simple message,
[1:56] but I I feel and it's something that
[1:59] it's I've always kind of um you know
[2:03] have quotes and and phrases and
[2:05] scriptures that I always use and and um
[2:08] this is just one of them where I really
[2:11] just love this thought of um the the
[2:15] title today is when no one is looking.
[2:17] living living our life when nobody is
[2:20] looking. When when the pastor is not
[2:23] there to see how good we are or what
[2:25] we're doing, we're working out our own
[2:28] salvation.
[2:29] Now, Brother Brandham, he's saying in
[2:31] the message early spiritual experiences.
[2:34] Um, I really like this phrase because it
[2:36] kind of gives it dives into his own life
[2:40] and um what is going on in him. He says,
[2:43] "Now, of course, there's things that God
[2:45] has revealed, and I'm not wanting you to
[2:48] think I'm a mystic. I'm not a mystic. I
[2:51] am a child of God by faith of in Jesus
[2:54] Christ." But there's things in the
[2:56] spiritual world that you can't speak out
[2:59] to the people. The closest person to me,
[3:02] I guess, in the world is my son and my
[3:04] wife and as I know of my mother. And
[3:07] they don't even know no more about it.
[3:10] and I've told them no more than I tell
[3:12] you because it's an individual affair.
[3:15] So, there's things that were in in
[3:18] Brother Benham's life, spiritual things
[3:20] that God revealed to him, things that he
[3:22] probably went through, things that he
[3:24] was struggling with that nobody ever
[3:27] knew.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; There's things in our life, if we start
[3:31] looking into our lives, that even the
[3:33] closest person to us will never know.
[3:37] things that maybe we struggle with that
[3:39] we'll probably never say. Things that
[3:41] we're we're working on and things that
[3:43] we only God only knows. The things that
[3:46] we're going through that we can never
[3:48] maybe tell anybody or we just choose not
[3:50] to. Only God knows,
[3:53] spiritual things, things that have been
[3:55] revealed that only God knows.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; I believe every single person has that
[4:01] kind of life.
[4:03] I understand that that um it's an
[4:06] individual affair and that's where Paul
[4:09] is saying you got to work out your own
[4:11] salvation.
[4:12] It's a it's a Christianity that's that
[4:15] that centers on a one-on-one
[4:17] relationship with God. No one else can
[4:20] believe for you.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; No one else can repent for you. No one
[4:25] else can obey on your behalf. This makes
[4:29] your life an individual journey for you.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; Your your it's your responsibility to uh
[4:36] obey God's call
[4:38] &gt;&gt; to cultivate your own faith to pursue
[4:40] your holiness to think of your daily
[4:42] choices every single day. It's up to us.
[4:46] That's why, you know, we've all I know
[4:48] we've all been enjoying these messages
[4:50] of praying and and the word of God
[4:53] because it's something an individual has
[4:56] to take upon himself to cultivate their
[4:59] Christian.
[5:01] We have to do it. Now, in saying all
[5:04] that, we all enjoy singing together. We
[5:08] all enjoy testimonies and and hearing
[5:10] the teachings and hearing preachings and
[5:13] all of that but but it's just not a um
[5:17] you know a giving of information and
[5:20] exchanging of emotions. There is a
[5:22] spiritual transference that is going on
[5:24] in our lives as the singing is going on
[5:27] today.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; As as the the first prayer when we came
[5:32] in was was said
[5:35] &gt;&gt; as the preacher is preaching there there
[5:37] is a spiritual transference that is
[5:40] going on into the individual. Even
[5:43] though we're all enjoying this together,
[5:46] we're all in a group and we can all, you
[5:48] know, praise the Lord in a group, but we
[5:50] all have our individual problems, our
[5:53] individual requests from the Lord, our
[5:55] individual situation in our lives. We're
[5:58] all going through it. And each and every
[6:01] one of us have that going on in our
[6:04] lives.
[6:05] Brother Brandham calls it a hidden life,
[6:08] something that nobody will ever see.
[6:11] And you and with God, the amazing thing
[6:14] with God is the the most secret things.
[6:18] Whenever you hear about a secret,
[6:19] sometimes it's gossip, right? When you
[6:22] when you hear about something that is
[6:23] hidden, sometimes it's bad.
[6:26] When somebody's hiding, they did
[6:28] something wrong. Well, this hiding
[6:30] place, this secret place that God has,
[6:34] that is the most holy thing that is in
[6:37] God, that is in the world. So the most
[6:40] secret things with God is the most
[6:43] holiest.
[6:44] So whenever you can get into a secret
[6:47] place with God, have a secret uh
[6:51] communion with God,
[6:53] &gt;&gt; that is the most intimate place
[6:57] &gt;&gt; where where brother Brandham says the
[6:59] world is shut out from that place
[7:02] &gt;&gt; where where a you know a three three uh
[7:05] what is it three room house
[7:07] &gt;&gt; we are like the the temple the
[7:09] tabernacle where outside yes there's
[7:12] good days and bad
[7:14] In the inner courts, there's always
[7:16] emotions going up and down, but then
[7:18] there's that holy of holies.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Where is that is where the almighty
[7:23] dwells?
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Psalms 91
[7:27] um verse two 1 and two it says, "He that
[7:30] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[7:32] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[7:35] almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is
[7:38] my refuge and my fortress. My God, in
[7:41] him will I trust. That's where I want to
[7:44] live. In that secret place, [snorts] in
[7:48] a place nobody knows, when nobody's
[7:51] seen, when nobody's watching, when
[7:52] nobody's looking, you're serving the
[7:54] Lord.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; If anybody was able to see into
[8:02] the secret part of one's life, what
[8:04] would they see?
[8:06] If people were able to dive in into the
[8:08] thoughts,
[8:09] what would we see? The world's secrets.
[8:13] Those are the words worst things. The
[8:15] world's secrets is the worst.
[8:19] In John 3:19
[8:22] here, of course, we know John 3:16 where
[8:25] it said, "For God so loved the world
[8:26] that he gave his only begotten son that
[8:28] whosoever believeth will not be uh will
[8:32] will not be condemned but be saved and
[8:34] have eternal life."
[8:36] And and then he's saying, "But but he
[8:38] that believeth not is condemned." And
[8:41] he's condemned already. And then so 19
[8:44] he says this is the condemnation here
[8:46] because now he's saying that there is
[8:48] somebody that's saved that believes and
[8:49] those that don't believe he is
[8:51] condemned. And he says this is the
[8:52] condemnation
[8:54] that light has come into the world. So
[8:57] light is the illumination.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Light allows you to see
[9:03] &gt;&gt; allows you to see what's going on. And
[9:05] he says light has come into the world
[9:07] and men love darkness rather than light
[9:09] because their deeds were evil. robbers,
[9:13] thieves, murderers, they hide in the
[9:16] dark, right? They're the ones hiding and
[9:18] they don't want to be seen. So, they're
[9:20] hiding in the dark. So, there's there's
[9:22] a sin that that loves to dwell in the
[9:25] dark. And that is a secret place for the
[9:28] whole world. People have secret places.
[9:31] But but here came Jesus, not to condemn.
[9:35] He said he didn't come to the world to
[9:36] condemn, but that light was an
[9:38] illumination so that they can understand
[9:40] that they were already condemned and he
[9:43] came to save them.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; But people, the Bible says is that
[9:49] that their deeds were evil. And verse 20
[9:52] it says, "And everyone that doeth evil
[9:55] hateth the light, neither cometh to the
[9:58] light, lest their deeds should be
[9:59] reproved. But he that doeth um the truth
[10:04] cometh to light and his deed that his
[10:06] deeds may be manifest that they are
[10:08] wrought in God. And it says that they
[10:11] loved the world. They loved the darkness
[10:15] because they love those things. So
[10:18] that's why a lot of people they choose
[10:20] not to serve the Lord. They choose not
[10:21] to believe.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Uh it's one of the biggest reasons why
[10:26] people don't believe, right? people
[10:28] think they're intellectual and and
[10:30] they're just so intellectual that you
[10:32] know the Bible it's just oh no it's it's
[10:35] not doesn't fit but a lot of times it's
[10:38] just a reason for them to say you know
[10:40] what I'm not going to be uh convicted of
[10:44] these things
[10:46] I don't want to be guilty of the things
[10:48] that I love so they'd rather be like you
[10:51] know what I I don't you know that's just
[10:53] beneath me but a lot of times it's
[10:56] because we don't want to be don't want
[10:59] the light to come in.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; Those are the secret things of the
[11:04] world.
[11:05] But to God, the secret things, those are
[11:10] the most beautiful things. In
[11:13] Deuteronomy 29:29, it says, "The secret
[11:16] things belong unto the Lord our God, but
[11:19] those things which are revealed unto us
[11:22] and to our children forever that we may
[11:25] do all the words of this law." So,
[11:28] there's mysteries and revelations that
[11:31] God reveals or or reserves for intimate
[11:35] fellowship with his people. There's
[11:38] secrets that God is not going to divulge
[11:40] to the whole world, but he only has it
[11:43] specially for his elect.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; There's secret things that you know,
[11:49] revelations that you know that the other
[11:52] person will never know.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; And it's not that you have, oh well, you
[11:56] know, I'm probably bride and they're
[11:57] not. No, there's everybody is
[11:59] individual. Yes,
[12:01] &gt;&gt; we God will give us a collective uh
[12:03] revelation so that we can understand the
[12:06] mysteries of God. But then there's
[12:08] things in your life that God will only
[12:10] reveal to you that no one will ever
[12:14] know.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; God will whisper secrets to you.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; God will work things out and then people
[12:22] don't understand how did they overcome
[12:24] that.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; There's secrets. There's mysteries that
[12:27] God will tell us.
[12:31] He wants to share his heart in those m
[12:33] moments. It's a sacred trust. And God,
[12:35] he always works and transforms in the
[12:39] inside life. It's a secret place where
[12:42] there's no performance. There's no
[12:44] pretending. There's no audience.
[12:47] Only God and the soul.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm a human. We're all human. We
[12:53] We're all We're all connected one way or
[12:55] another. at work. We, you know, you got
[12:58] to get the boss to like you, right? You
[13:00] got to, you want people to like you. You
[13:02] want to be friendly. You want all these
[13:05] things. We all are in this world and
[13:08] we're we're we're uh creatures that want
[13:11] to be together and want to have all
[13:13] these things, but when it comes to God,
[13:15] there is no pretending.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; There is no fake it till you make it.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; There is none of that. IT'S JUST A RAW
[13:24] EXPERIENCE between you and God.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; Then God can you can't you can't fool
[13:30] your way a way around this with God.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; You can't look good in front of God.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; All of our problems and all of our
[13:39] issues, God is looking.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; And he's not, oh man, no. He says,
[13:46] "That's my boy.
[13:48] That's my girl. THAT'S my daughter.
[13:51] That's my son.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; And all of his flaws, all of the things,
[13:55] they are mine.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want a a a cosmetic
[14:00] Christian. He doesn't want somebody that
[14:02] is just lifted up and and but he wants
[14:05] somebody that that is there's no
[14:07] pretending. There's no audience. There's
[14:08] no faking it. It's just him in the soul.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; It's where all the masks are fall they
[14:15] fall away.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; You know, we've got a lot of faces.
[14:19] We've got a lot of masks. We got a lot
[14:20] of complexes. We got a lot of things.
[14:22] All those drop with God.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; That's where your tears are not wasted.
[14:30] Your pleading, it's it's heard. There's
[14:34] an ear there. There's somebody right
[14:36] there. That's where true worship flows
[14:40] from.
[14:42] This is where God does his holiest work.
[14:45] This is where God really starts working
[14:48] in an individual in your private time in
[14:52] your your little spot in the soul that
[14:55] says, "Lord, nobody knows me. I maybe as
[14:59] a young person, I feel misunderstood.
[15:02] Maybe maybe I'm I'm just trying to
[15:04] figure out my identity. Maybe I'm I'm
[15:06] trying to see what I'm what am I
[15:08] supposed to do? What am I who am I? What
[15:11] what am I SUPPOSED TO DO?" GOD KNOWS WHO
[15:14] YOU ARE.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; God knows everything about you.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I'm there." There's this
[15:22] scripture, I believe it's Psalms 139.
[15:24] One of the most beautiful but yet
[15:26] terrifying scriptures where Psalm says,
[15:28] "Wherever I am, there you are, Lord.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; I can hide myself in heaven. There you
[15:34] are. I can be in the deepest, darkest
[15:36] pits of hell. There you are, Lord.
[15:39] I everywhere I am, whatever I do, you
[15:43] were there when I was in my mother's
[15:45] belly,
[15:46] &gt;&gt; he said.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; That's the God I want to serve.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; The God that that I don't have to do
[15:53] anything. I just have to say, "Lord,
[15:55] it's been a rough day.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; I don't have to say, "Oh, it was a good
[15:59] day." No, you you can bring your
[16:01] complaints to him.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; You can bring your needs to him, and he
[16:05] will know what to do
[16:07] &gt;&gt; about it. Yes, sir.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus, his his most intimate and most
[16:16] profound messages, his greatest
[16:18] revelations were in the secret places
[16:22] here in Mark 4:10 and uh 10-11.
[16:27] says that now he just gave the audience
[16:31] the the parable of the seed and he's
[16:34] explaining what the seed does if it's on
[16:36] certain ground and all of these things
[16:38] and and he's giving them the seed and
[16:40] giving it to them as a parable so
[16:42] everybody's kind of scratching their
[16:44] head saying well okay what is he saying
[16:47] here
[16:48] and he he's allowing everybody to hear
[16:51] it but then the Bible says when he was
[16:54] alone
[16:56] They that were about him with the twel
[16:58] asked him the of the parable.
[17:02] And he said unto him, unto you it is
[17:04] given to know the mystery of the kingdom
[17:07] of God, but unto them that are without
[17:10] all these things are done in parables.
[17:13] Aren't you glad to be in the end?
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad to know the mysteries?
[17:18] Amen.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Not because we we congregate in a group
[17:22] which this is needful,
[17:24] but you know those mysteries because you
[17:26] have a one-on-one experience with God.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be like the 12 where
[17:32] where John, Peter, and and Andrew,
[17:34] they're elbowing their way closer to the
[17:36] Lord and say, "Well, I'm the best. I'm
[17:38] going to sit close to him. I'm going to
[17:40] sit right next to him."
[17:43] John over there trying to lean on his
[17:44] chest and Peter trying to say, "I'll do
[17:47] anything for you." Man, they're trying
[17:49] there. Everybody was fighting for his
[17:50] attention.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; You don't need to do that.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Just go into your private place
[17:57] &gt;&gt; into your soul. He will be there. He is
[17:59] available.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Anything you need, he's available.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; A friend in need, he's available.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; Healing, he's available.
[18:10] somebody to for guidance. He's
[18:12] available.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; It's this life that is alone when
[18:18] nobody's watching.
[18:20] That's when you can find your intimacy
[18:23] with Christ.
[18:26] You know, when I first um it's not in my
[18:28] notes, but I I was thinking when I first
[18:31] uh well, you know, and was as a
[18:33] Christian, I I would think to myself, I
[18:35] was like, "What if I was in a in an
[18:37] island all by myself?"
[18:40] I'd say, "I'd act the same."
[18:43] You think about that. If you were in a
[18:46] place that didn't have people that would
[18:49] watch you and see you and do these, what
[18:52] would you do? Where would you be at?
[18:56] What life would you be living? Well,
[18:58] that's a good way to check up and say,
[19:00] "Lord, I need a lot of help.
[19:03] Lord, maybe maybe there's things there's
[19:05] vices. There's there's things that are
[19:07] maybe I'm suppressing. Lord, just see it
[19:11] and take it away, Lord.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Work in my life.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Because I want to be the greatest
[19:18] Christian when nobody's watching.
[19:21] I want to serve you with all of my heart
[19:23] if I'm the last person on earth.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do.
[19:31] He He spoke to Nicodemus at night. He
[19:36] had to hide away from all his friends.
[19:37] He he didn't want nobody to see him. And
[19:40] he said, "Lord, give me the mysteries."
[19:43] to the Samaritan woman when nobody she
[19:47] thought nobody was watching but brother
[19:48] Brandham says the disciples were there
[19:50] looking why is he talking to her
[19:54] but there they were alone she thought
[19:58] she was alone and there that's when God
[20:00] began to reveal to her the men to the
[20:04] road into Emmas there Jesus was there
[20:08] the amazing thing is he made himself
[20:10] known to everybody but But he revealed
[20:14] himself to some.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; They killed him. He rose again. And only
[20:20] those that believed
[20:22] were able to see him.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; He was only seen by loving eyes.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; He wasn't seen by the whole world
[20:29] anymore. He He gave a chance to the
[20:31] world. He gave a chance to the Jews. He
[20:33] gave a chance. But whenever he was
[20:35] there, he had his glorified body. It was
[20:38] those that believed that saw him.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[20:41] &gt;&gt; The amazing thing is that's the only
[20:43] people he opened their eyes. He probably
[20:45] walked past a lot of people.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; He probably went through the Pharisee
[20:50] and he probably waved at them. The, you
[20:52] know, I'm just making things up, but
[20:54] maybe the Pharisee couldn't see him. It
[20:56] said, the Bible said that he had to open
[20:58] their eyes
[20:59] &gt;&gt; for them to see.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was It's a special
[21:05] relationship where you're there by
[21:07] yourself.
[21:09] Brother Brandham calls it in in the
[21:11] hidden life. He says it's the holy of
[21:12] holies consecrated hidden life alone
[21:16] quiet with God. He said all of those
[21:19] together
[21:20] alone quiet with God.
[21:24] here um in the message hidden hidden
[21:26] life. It's a lengthy uh quote, but he
[21:29] says he says there's where the church is
[21:32] failing in one place. Overcoming
[21:34] overcoming temperance, temper,
[21:36] overcoming differences, overcoming
[21:38] church prejudice, overcoming hatred.
[21:40] Many people tonight who shout and speak
[21:43] with tongues and rup run up and down the
[21:45] aisle and hate their neighbor. That is,
[21:48] brother, you've you're lost yet. That's
[21:51] hard to say, but it's the truth, right?
[21:53] overcome. You can only overcome. Then he
[21:56] changes his style and he says, "You say
[21:58] I'm eating the mana, the glory of God,
[22:00] but yes, look what happens from one day
[22:02] to to the next. You get you get the
[22:05] mismeal cramps. You come in where the
[22:08] mana is fresh all the time." He says,
[22:11] "Whether your neighbor treats you right
[22:13] or not, you'll love him anyhow."
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; That's That's right. Whether he agrees
[22:19] with you or not, you love him anywhere.
[22:22] Anyhow, that's the way you got to do it.
[22:25] That's the hidden life. That's the
[22:27] consecrated life. That's the life that
[22:29] veils um that that the veils of the
[22:32] worlds and you're all cut off from
[22:34] things of the world. You only live in
[22:38] Christ. See what I mean, church? He says
[22:41] it's it's whenever we're not fluctuating
[22:45] with the world and we don't got, you
[22:47] know, saying hallelujah in church and
[22:49] going and just tearing everybody up on
[22:52] Monday. But it's a life where it says,
[22:55] Lord, thank you. And you go and you live
[22:58] your life. Now, this is a life that
[23:00] we're all working on.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; I don't think anybody's perfect. I think
[23:05] we all need work in this
[23:08] &gt;&gt; where we say, "Lord, I need this. I need
[23:11] more of you. I need where my character
[23:14] is the same in the good days and the bad
[23:16] days."
[23:20] &gt;&gt; That's when you know you're you're into
[23:21] something.
[23:23] Now, now we live in an age where where
[23:27] everybody is
[23:29] they're it's a pretending right now.
[23:31] We're I'm talking about this world where
[23:33] it's like everybody wants to replace
[23:36] appearance with intimacy or or wants to
[23:39] replace intimacy with appearances
[23:42] where they want to look good instead of
[23:44] be known and and be good.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Everybody with social media they the
[23:51] social media has become a stage to
[23:53] perform.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; That's all it is. It's a stage
[23:56] &gt;&gt; so that we can go and we can go on our
[23:58] Tik Tok and we can get as much likes and
[24:01] viral views and we can go to Instagram.
[24:04] We can go here and we can go there and
[24:05] see how great we are.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; That's the world today.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; That's the whole world
[24:12] &gt;&gt; is just living behind filters living
[24:16] behind these things. the great life and
[24:19] that's what's influenc the sad thing is
[24:21] that's what's influencing
[24:23] &gt;&gt; not only the young but the old saying
[24:26] man I have it pretty bad why is because
[24:29] you're looking at people with three four
[24:31] filters on
[24:33] &gt;&gt; and they're they're they have a
[24:35] background of the Bahamas and they're
[24:36] probably in the mother's basement
[24:39] &gt;&gt; who knows
[24:41] &gt;&gt; but but what is it it's a stage of
[24:44] pretending
[24:47] They're not no longer just living.
[24:49] They're creating an identity.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; They're more concerned of what of of how
[24:56] life looks than how life really is.
[25:02] The tragedy is all this performance of
[25:05] this whole world leaves people empty
[25:08] looking for validation
[25:11] looking for the the next like and it
[25:14] disconnects us from the truth.
[25:17] That's the sad reality of the world.
[25:20] That's what's going on with the world.
[25:22] Right.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; And today we could even say that in a
[25:25] Christian life if we're not careful we
[25:29] can begin to like brother brother Aaron
[25:32] said a cosmetic Christian
[25:34] where we can try to fix things and and
[25:37] and try to build off of what we are or
[25:40] or what we want people to see and never
[25:44] work on the inside life, the inner life.
[25:48] That's not what we want to do.
[25:51] We we want to live our life whether
[25:54] we're living a um having a good time or
[25:56] a bad time whether there's people you're
[25:59] surrounded by hundreds of people or it's
[26:01] by yourself.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; You want to be constant serving the Lord
[26:07] &gt;&gt; with all of your heart. Doesn't matter
[26:09] what anybody says, but a lot of times us
[26:11] as in our human nature, we want that
[26:13] validation. We want that pat in the
[26:15] back.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; We're we're human. It's nice when people
[26:19] say, "Hey, good job. I did a good job,
[26:23] man. You did good at work today." Yeah,
[26:26] &gt;&gt; it's all right. But when we begin to
[26:29] feed off of that, when we begin create
[26:31] our character off of those things,
[26:36] &gt;&gt; we're in a dangerous place.
[26:38] Jesus, he walks in, stumbles in into
[26:42] that life of the Pharisees, and he says,
[26:44] "Whoa,
[26:46] you guys
[26:48] are in a deep problem here."
[26:53] He says in in u Matthew 23:27, he's
[26:56] talking to the Pharisees. He says, "Woe
[26:58] un woe to you scribes and Pharisees,
[27:01] hypocrites, for you are like white
[27:04] washed tombs which indeed impear appear
[27:06] beautiful outwardly but inside are full
[27:08] of dead man's bones and uncleanness."
[27:12] That's the condition that they were
[27:14] beautiful on the outside to the point
[27:17] where everybody's like, "Man, I just
[27:18] want to be like him. Man, I can never be
[27:21] like the Pharisee." But his life wasn't
[27:24] matching his outer appearance. The world
[27:27] wants us to have outer appearance, wants
[27:29] us to be the best, the most beautiful,
[27:32] the strongest, the whatever it might be.
[27:34] They they're trying to create the
[27:36] perfect man and the perfect woman and
[27:38] saying this is what you're supposed to
[27:40] be. And so everybody's trying to do
[27:42] those things, running to the treadmill
[27:44] and running to this and trying to be
[27:47] what the world thinks is a great image.
[27:52] But the greatest person, the greatest
[27:54] husband, the greatest wife, the greatest
[27:57] child that you can be for your parents
[27:59] is one that is full of character of
[28:02] Christ.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; That's that's what we want to be.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; That's what I want.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; I wanted my life to flow from the inside
[28:13] out and not try to patch up the outside.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord,
[28:19] &gt;&gt; brother. That was the very condition of
[28:21] Lady Osia. He says in in Revelations
[28:24] 3:17 to20, he says, "Because you say I'm
[28:26] rich. You become wealthy.
[28:30] You You say you have need of nothing and
[28:32] don't know that you are wretched,
[28:33] miserable, poor, blind, and naked."
[28:36] See, here is where the projecting and
[28:39] outward appearance.
[28:42] They're they're trying to get outward
[28:43] validation.
[28:45] They're trying to appear that they're
[28:47] this, they're that. That's the world.
[28:49] And if we're not careful, that'll suck
[28:51] us right in.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Then he says in 18, he says, "I counsel
[28:56] you to buy from me gold refined in the
[28:59] fire that you may be rich and and white
[29:02] garments that you may be clothed that
[29:05] your shame, your nakedness may not be
[29:07] revealed, and anoint your eyes with eyes
[29:10] that you may see. As many as I love, I
[29:13] rebuke and I chasen. Therefore, be
[29:15] zealous and repent." Then 20 he says,
[29:18] "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[29:21] If anyone hears my voice and opens the
[29:24] door, I will come into him and dine with
[29:26] him and he with me."
[29:29] &gt;&gt; That is the essence of life.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; That he's he's talking to people that
[29:34] are rich that have need to nothing. But
[29:36] then he says, "I don't want all of that.
[29:39] I want to knock in your heart and me and
[29:42] you have a conversation. Yes,
[29:45] &gt;&gt; me and you have a dialogue. That's true
[29:47] fulfillment. When when life is done
[29:50] within closed doors,
[29:53] &gt;&gt; when Christianity is is when nobody is
[29:55] watching, you're there. You're you're
[29:58] you're walking with the Lord.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; When everybody is against you, when all
[30:02] things are are seems like everything is
[30:05] not working the way it should, you're
[30:07] still standing on the word of the Lord.
[30:10] Amen.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; You're still walking with the Lord
[30:13] by yourself.
[30:16] You may be surrounded. You may have many
[30:18] family members, but it's just you and
[30:20] God.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; It's just you. Brother Brandham, he says
[30:24] this. He says, "A man that stands for
[30:26] God stands alone."
[30:30] &gt;&gt; That is a Christian life.
[30:33] A man that stands for God stands alone.
[30:35] In the message, the church lo uh
[30:37] choosing law for grace. He says, "A man
[30:40] who ever amounts to anything is the man
[30:43] that stands alone. Him and God alone."
[30:46] That's the man. There's on his on his
[30:48] Jericho road, there's only room for two.
[30:52] No more, no less. Just Jesus and you.
[30:54] That's all. So that's the way we have to
[30:57] walk this narrow way. Every man that
[31:00] ever did anything for God walked on the
[31:02] same road. That's the same thing. So we
[31:05] are just like um they are the same
[31:08] thing. We have to stand it alone but
[31:11] never alone. He's always there.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Now it doesn't mean that we have a
[31:16] secluded life and we're you know how
[31:18] people call it introverts where you know
[31:20] where we don't want to surround
[31:22] ourselves by loved ones. No, we're
[31:23] around people.
[31:25] We're we're going to we're going to have
[31:27] fellowship. We're going to if you're
[31:29] you're a funny person or if you're
[31:30] outgoing or if you're the quiet person,
[31:32] you're going to be yourself. But you've
[31:34] got to remember, you've got to reserve
[31:36] the greatest part of your life for
[31:40] Christ.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; You got to stand alone. Just like in a
[31:44] ship, you could put on your captain's
[31:46] hat. You can go greet everybody, but
[31:48] what makes that ship go is the man in
[31:50] the engine room.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; So, you got to you got to be happy and
[31:56] do all these things with family, but
[31:58] inside there has to be a walk alone
[32:01] standing on the word. Amen.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; We have to do that.
[32:08] I believe today
[32:11] there's Christians that live that way.
[32:13] Live with that integrity. Maybe
[32:16] sometimes we feel like we don't. Maybe,
[32:18] you know, what's that um syndrome? U
[32:21] imposttor syndrome. Sometimes maybe
[32:23] people feel that way. Maybe they don't
[32:25] feel worthy enough. Maybe. But God sees
[32:29] God sees a life faithful.
[32:32] God sees people that that are living
[32:34] that walk of integrity.
[32:37] He He's He's seen those things
[32:42] doing what God told us to do.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Doing everything walking the way the
[32:48] word says it. Even though we fall
[32:50] sometimes we we veer off. Sometimes we
[32:53] stand on the word.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; We go to work. We trust in the Lord.
[32:58] GOING TO WORK. WE COME BACK HOME. WE'RE
[33:00] TRUSTING in the Lord. We come to church.
[33:02] We worship.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; We do what we're supposed to do.
[33:10] There's no validation there.
[33:13] There's no good job. There's no thank
[33:15] you for being a Christian. It's actually
[33:18] sometimes the opposite.
[33:20] It's a thankless life. It's not going to
[33:23] be glamorous like the world wants you to
[33:25] be.
[33:27] You're not going to be one of those
[33:28] tick- tock Christians.
[33:30] You're not going to be one of those.
[33:32] You're just going to serve the Lord
[33:35] &gt;&gt; day in and day out.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Just like I said the other the other
[33:40] day, I don't know when, but you know, we
[33:43] we hear of Noah, Abraham, and there's so
[33:45] much scripture about them, but if you
[33:47] think about it, I think Noah was 930ome
[33:51] hundred years.
[33:54] How how old he was? He was 900 and some
[33:56] 30 some years old and all we have is a
[34:00] few chapters of Noah
[34:02] &gt;&gt; and that's all we know him as man. Noah,
[34:05] he was the guy, man. He built the boat.
[34:08] What about all the other 800 years?
[34:12] &gt;&gt; All the other years that he had to toil
[34:14] by himself that we don't know those
[34:16] unknown years.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; What about Abraham? We know him just
[34:20] because he had faith and God called him.
[34:22] But what about all the other years
[34:24] before he was 75?
[34:27] &gt;&gt; All the other years between u the
[34:29] promise and and and when it was
[34:30] fulfilled
[34:32] &gt;&gt; all those years where he had to suffer.
[34:35] He had to stand on the word alone.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; No thank you. It was actually there's a
[34:41] crazy old man walking again.
[34:44] you know, in in um when my parents, my
[34:48] dad, he was an apostolic and and people
[34:50] at church at uh school, he was a
[34:53] Hispanic, so he kind of had it bad every
[34:57] way. But even like his friends, they
[34:58] would say, "Oh, there goes the
[34:59] Hallelujah. That's a holy roller.
[35:03] There goes the Hallelujah." And that's
[35:05] who they were.
[35:07] There goes crazy Abraham.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; There goes those people. What? It's not
[35:12] a thing. It's not a It's not a life to
[35:15] be glamorized and say, "Man, I would
[35:17] just want to be like him." It's, you
[35:19] know what? It's a life by yourself. A
[35:22] man that stands with God stands alone.
[35:28] Now, it's it's nice whenever we're here
[35:31] together, but a lot of times it's just a
[35:33] mundane life.
[35:36] If somebody looked into your life, what
[35:38] glory would they see?
[35:41] say, "Wow, look at the glorious life.
[35:44] Look at the glory in that life. Your
[35:46] mundane life. You're going to work.
[35:48] Coming home,
[35:50] coming to church,
[35:53] doing what we're supposed to. Men, doing
[35:56] what you're supposed to, doing
[35:58] everything you can. Coming home, go
[36:00] going to work, paying your tithe. women
[36:03] tidying up the house, taking care of the
[36:04] kids, picking up the clothes, folding
[36:07] them just to see them on the ground
[36:09] again.
[36:11] And what it's not just once a week, it's
[36:13] every day. Every day. That's your
[36:16] glorious life.
[36:18] Every day, brothers, just living every
[36:21] single day.
[36:23] Does it does it ever feel? Now, this is
[36:25] just going into perspective. Now, this
[36:27] is thinking because we know Christ is
[36:29] there. But sometimes it feels like
[36:31] everything we do is not much at all.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; I'm no I'm not great. I don't maybe I
[36:37] don't have a lot of gifts. I don't have
[36:39] this. I don't have that. I'm not like
[36:40] them.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; I just do this. I come home. I do just
[36:44] an everyday life.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; I don't have much.
[36:50] It doesn't matter to anybody else. It's
[36:53] not a glorious life. It's not a a
[36:55] filtered life. It's just a raw life
[36:58] Christian serving the Lord every day.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; We're not like everybody else.
[37:08] And sometimes it feels like even even
[37:11] our all seems like it's less than other
[37:14] people's sum,
[37:15] &gt;&gt; right? I'm just trying. I'm working and
[37:18] I'm walking and I'm feels like I'm just
[37:20] driving in the mud when others are just
[37:21] like it's a good life. It's like Lord,
[37:24] I'm trying my best. I'm doing everything
[37:27] I can. There's this story in Mark
[37:30] 12:41-44
[37:32] and he's talking about how well I'll
[37:35] just read it to you. It's says, "Now
[37:38] Jesus sat at it the opposite of the
[37:39] treasury and saw how the people put the
[37:42] money into the treasury
[37:45] and how many people and and and um and
[37:48] many people who were rich put in much."
[37:51] Then one poor widow came and threw two
[37:55] mites which makes a quadrant.
[37:59] So he called his disciples to himself
[38:01] and said, "Assuredly I say to you that
[38:03] this poor widow has put more than all of
[38:05] those who's given to the treasury. For
[38:08] they put out of their abundance
[38:12] she put out of her poverty, but put in
[38:15] all she had her whole livelihood." Now
[38:18] this is not about money. It's about your
[38:19] efforts to the Lord.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; That some that you know they've just got
[38:24] they can just do it and do all these
[38:26] things and sometimes you're just giving
[38:27] it all.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; May Lord I don't have gifts. I don't
[38:31] have this. I nobody knows what I do. I'm
[38:34] just serving you with all of I have all
[38:36] that I have. Jesus says that's more than
[38:39] enough.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Your all is more than the world could
[38:44] ever give him.
[38:46] All the riches, all the the things, God
[38:49] is appreciating your all.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Everything that you have, give it to the
[38:55] Lord.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; She didn't go hoping somebody was going
[38:59] to see. Maybe she was ashamed that she
[39:01] had those two mites. [snorts]
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Maybe she was like,
[39:06] &gt;&gt; you know, nobody's going to see me when
[39:07] everybody's, you know, buckets full of
[39:09] cash.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; But Jesus saw her.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] Somebody was looking.
[39:16] Even though she probably didn't know
[39:18] anybody was looking, somebody's watching
[39:21] our lives.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody's looking.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; I started thinking about the story of
[39:27] Rebecca and
[39:29] how God had this the servant of Abraham
[39:33] go and and and he had qualifications. He
[39:36] said, "You know the one that gives me
[39:38] water and no, not only that, but gives
[39:41] water to my camels."
[39:44] Now, that would have been easy if
[39:45] somebody was like, "I'll give you some
[39:47] water." But he's like, "My camels, too."
[39:50] Man, now that's a big task.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; He's making sure that whoever is going
[39:54] to walk up to him, that was God because
[39:58] not everybody's going to want to do
[39:59] that.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; That's a big task.
[40:02] So, he's there sitting there and I'm
[40:05] sure a lot of people have um have heard
[40:08] the story and seen how many gallons and
[40:11] and how the well was constructed, how
[40:14] you have to walk down it and and how
[40:16] many camels did he really have and oh,
[40:19] it it was a lot. It was a lot of work.
[40:24] Well, here comes Rebecca.
[40:26] Maybe now I'm just um making things up
[40:30] here now. read the Bible. But maybe she
[40:33] had a bad week.
[40:35] Maybe she had the worst day of her life.
[40:38] Who knows? She was just like all of us.
[40:43] Maybe it was just not one of those good
[40:45] days.
[40:48] She was just doing what she's supposed
[40:50] to. It was just a mundane life.
[40:54] Got to get the water.
[40:56] Yep. It's 700 a.m. I I got to wake up.
[40:59] Got to go get the go get the water. I
[41:01] got to go do this. She's not there. Hope
[41:05] somebody sees me today. Oh man, this is
[41:08] where this is my big moment to shine.
[41:10] No.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; It's your everyday life.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; It's when nobody's watching.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; It's when nobody cares.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; It's when you think that it just it's
[41:21] not worth it. That there just there's
[41:24] nothing to it.
[41:27] There was somebody expecting.
[41:30] There was somebody watching.
[41:32] And there she goes doing just her
[41:34] everyday life.
[41:39] She's said, "Do you need some water?"
[41:40] "Yeah, some water." "All right, here."
[41:43] She was quick with it, too. She Here's
[41:46] water. Now, he didn't say, "Yeah, give
[41:49] some water to my camels, too." She said,
[41:52] "I'll feed your I'll water your camels,
[41:54] too.
[41:56] Then the Bible says in Genesis 24:21, he
[42:01] says, "The man wondering at her held his
[42:04] peace."
[42:06] He said, "Oh,
[42:07] is this it?" He started to think, "Is
[42:10] this the one that's going to fulfill the
[42:13] word?"
[42:15] &gt;&gt; So now he's he's in wonder.
[42:18] He's watching her.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; She didn't do it for reci recognition.
[42:24] She didn't even know anybody was
[42:25] looking.
[42:27] She didn't act like like somebody was
[42:30] going to bring her a husband, like this
[42:31] is the day that I'm going to have a
[42:32] husband. And no, SHE WAS JUST LIVING HER
[42:34] LIFE.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; She was doing what she was supposed to.
[42:38] SHE WAS SERVING the Lord. She was
[42:40] faithful
[42:42] &gt;&gt; with the integrity of her heart,
[42:47] &gt;&gt; thinking nobody cared, nobody was
[42:48] watching. Now think about it. That's the
[42:51] way I want to live every day. Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; It's just another day. Praise be to God.
[42:57] I give it. I commit it to you, Lord.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; I commit my day. I commit my health. I
[43:02] commit everything, my strength to you,
[43:05] Lord. Today is going to be a good day.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Then you walk into the the house and
[43:09] it's been a horrible. And you say,
[43:10] "Thank you, Lord. I learned a lot of
[43:13] lessons.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; I went through a lot of storms, but
[43:16] Lord, thank you anyways."
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Well, who cared? Nobody. But it doesn't
[43:22] matter. I'm walking with the Lord.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; He's there watching her, his eyes fixed
[43:28] on her,
[43:30] not knowing that she was the bride.
[43:34] She was the a chosen bride that was
[43:37] going to change the whole narrative of
[43:39] the story of the Bible. That she was
[43:42] through her was going to be the the the
[43:44] manchild called Jesus Christ. Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Through her,
[43:49] through her family, through her lineage,
[43:53] she was just living her life. Now, today
[43:55] we can say that today
[43:58] he was in silent wonder. How
[44:01] how she was kind, she was friendly with
[44:04] a stranger, her humility, she was
[44:06] willing to take on more than what he
[44:09] asked. Cuz he went and he ran to her and
[44:12] he said, "Hey, give me some something to
[44:14] drink." So she fulfilled more than what
[44:17] he asked of her. She did everything she
[44:20] was supposed to. It was because that was
[44:22] her cloth. That was her character.
[44:25] That's who she was.
[44:27] She was serving the Lord. And because of
[44:30] that, somebody was watching.
[44:33] When nobody's watching, it feels like
[44:35] nobody's looking.
[44:37] Somebody is. There's a Holy Spirit
[44:41] watching us every single day. When it
[44:42] seems like our all doesn't seem like
[44:45] much at all, God is saying this is the
[44:47] very moment.
[44:49] This is there goes my son. The he there
[44:53] he doesn't know. He maybe he feels like
[44:55] he's alone. Maybe he feels maybe she
[44:57] feels like no nobody cares. But I'm
[45:00] there watching every step.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; And what the word gave her, she's doing
[45:05] more and more and more of that word.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody's watching.
[45:11] Now, I I've said this in in other
[45:13] places, but I want to go to Hebrews 12:1
[45:18] because it's just so impactful in my
[45:20] life.
[45:25] says, "Wherefore, seeing that we are
[45:28] compassed about a great cloud of
[45:31] witnesses, or with so great a cloud of
[45:33] witnesses, let us lay us out every
[45:35] weight and sin that doth easily beset
[45:38] us, and let us run the race with
[45:39] patience u with patience the race that
[45:43] is set before us."
[45:45] Now, a lot of people, they take this
[45:47] scripture, I do too, is we talk about
[45:50] how let us run the race.
[45:53] let us lay aside everything. But he he
[45:57] says something specific here in the
[45:58] beginning. He says, "Wherefore, seeing
[46:01] that we are compassed about, a great
[46:04] cloud of witnesses."
[46:06] And then he starts a sentence almost
[46:08] incorrectly.
[46:10] He starts it by wherefore. You don't
[46:12] start a sentence that way. It's like,
[46:14] "Hey, how's it going? Therefore, huh?"
[46:18] It means it means that he's continuing
[46:21] on.
[46:23] So we got to go back to the other
[46:24] scriptures. We got to go to verse 11 and
[46:28] that is the the the chapter 11. That is
[46:31] the chapter of the hall of faith
[46:34] &gt;&gt; where it says Samson, Gideon, David,
[46:39] Moses. By faith, by faith, by faith they
[46:42] subdued lions. They did this, they did
[46:44] that. And and it says of whom the world
[46:47] was not worthy of these people.
[46:54] And in verse 39
[46:58] in in chapter 11, he says, "All these
[47:01] having obtained a good report through
[47:03] faith received not the promise.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; God having provided something better for
[47:10] who? Us?"
[47:12] &gt;&gt; That they without who us should not be
[47:16] made perfect. Yes.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Therefore,
[47:20] &gt;&gt; therefore, we're compassed about a great
[47:22] cloud of witnesses.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; So, he's talking about them
[47:27] knowing that there's going to be some
[47:29] that ARE GOING TO PERFECT THEIR FAITH in
[47:32] life.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; So, now us that are running this race,
[47:37] WE ARE COMPASSED ABOUT a great cloud OF
[47:39] WITNESSES. WHO WAS IT? ISAAC, ABRAHAM,
[47:42] JACOB, DAVID, ALL OF THEM TIPTOES ON THE
[47:46] OUTSIDE OR THE THE INSIDE OF HEAVEN
[47:48] SAYING, "KEEP GOING.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; KEEP pressing on.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, I just have this life. Oh,
[47:56] well, there's no meaning to my life."
[47:58] Well, there's people on the OTHER SIDE
[48:00] SAYING, "KEEP GOING.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE COMPASS
[48:05] A GREAT CLOUD OF WITNESSES.
[48:08] MANY PEOPLE are are DEPENDING ON THE
[48:11] BRIDE. Today
[48:14] &gt;&gt; history and and everything was depending
[48:16] on a woman named Rebecca
[48:19] &gt;&gt; because it was going to be her that was
[48:22] going to bring forth these children.
[48:24] What about us? Where we feel like we're
[48:26] not we're just living life, nobody
[48:28] cares. It's just mundane and all these
[48:30] things. When you have people waiting,
[48:33] watching on the other side of heaven,
[48:35] &gt;&gt; saying keep going.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Don't stop.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what happened to Jesus.
[48:43] That's what every the Bible says all of
[48:46] heaven stood watching.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; What move is Jesus going to take?
[48:52] &gt;&gt; It says that whenever all the when he
[48:54] was born, all of the angels came to sing
[48:57] for him. every step that he took. Maybe
[49:00] he was alone. He was despised. He was
[49:02] rejected by his very own people. He was
[49:05] alone.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Yet there was all of heaven watching.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; There he goes. There he's going there.
[49:12] There he submitted to the Lord
[49:15] &gt;&gt; finally to the point where he's on the
[49:17] cross AND HE SAYS, "WHY HAVE YOU
[49:19] FORSAKEN ME, LORD?"
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Not knowing all of us were depending on
[49:23] him. Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that when he was talking
[49:26] to Job, where were you when all the sons
[49:29] of God were SHOUTING FOR JOY? WHAT WERE
[49:31] WE? WE WERE looking beyond THE CURTAIN
[49:33] OF TIME, watching the lamb be slain
[49:36] before the foundation of the world.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; WE WERE WATCHING HIM SAYING, "THANK
[49:40] [screaming] YOU, LORD." IT WASN'T A SAD
[49:42] MOMENT. Maybe it was sad to Mary
[49:45] watching him, John watching him, people
[49:47] seeing the blood out of his side, him
[49:49] dying there crying, saying, "Lord, why
[49:52] have you forsaken me?" But we on the
[49:54] other side of heaven saying, "Praise
[49:57] God. I am redeemed.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. LOOK AT MY LORD living his
[50:02] life.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Dying for me and you."
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what's going on today.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, there's a quote where
[50:10] Brother Brandham says, "At that same
[50:12] time, we were rejoicing. We saw
[50:14] ourselves walking into this life
[50:17] &gt;&gt; and seeing the life that we were going
[50:19] to live.
[50:21] Every moment, brother Baram says, "We
[50:23] were in Abraham. We were in Jacob. We
[50:26] were in those." Whenever Abraham spoke
[50:28] to that man, we were there.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; We were part of the act. We are part of
[50:33] everything. We were in the word.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Watching everything.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; And now the bride here is representing
[50:42] all these Christians that died. every
[50:45] age from the beginning all the way to
[50:48] Lady Osia were representing the bride
[50:50] over there's
[50:52] a wedding ceremony going on
[50:56] &gt;&gt; what in in my own little life yes there
[50:58] is a wedding ceremony in your life
[51:01] &gt;&gt; there there is a uniting
[51:03] &gt;&gt; every time you consecrate your life to
[51:05] the Lord
[51:06] &gt;&gt; as we stand to our feet and the
[51:08] musicians come
[51:15] Brother Brandham
[51:18] or here in Romans 8:19
[51:22] it says for the earnest expectation of
[51:26] the creature waiteth for the
[51:28] manifestation of the sons of God. So not
[51:31] only heaven and earth are watching and
[51:33] waiting for us but even the earth is
[51:36] groaning and travailing for us.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:39] This word uh to wait expectingly to to
[51:42] to wait it means to stand with tiptoes
[51:46] that the earth is is waiting have this
[51:49] earnest expectation watching
[51:53] and in and expectedly or this
[51:55] expectation means an eagerness a
[51:57] stretched out neck. So the whole world,
[52:00] these earthquakes, these problems, these
[52:03] hurricanes, all these things that are
[52:04] happening, this earth is just watching,
[52:07] saying, "Look at these children, these
[52:10] sons and daughters of God are becoming
[52:13] what they're supposed to be."
[52:15] &gt;&gt; They're stepping into what they're
[52:17] supposed to be, back into the [music]
[52:18] word, back into Christ.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; In our little lives,
[52:24] when nobody's watching, you have Christ
[52:26] living in you. A life that is
[52:29] consecrated. Nobody knows.
[52:32] Yet when you're there by yourself, the
[52:34] whole world is depending on that life
[52:37] that you're living.
[52:40] Let us bow our heads as
[52:44] brother Philip comes. Heavenly Father,
[52:48] Lord, I'm just so thankful for your
[52:51] goodness. Lord,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful [music] for your
[52:56] constant eye watching over us.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; That Lord, you'll never allow anything
[53:02] to happen, but only for your good,
[53:05] Father. And what a comfort it is when
[53:08] things begin to happen, things begin to
[53:10] [music] crumble. We can put it on your
[53:12] hands and say, "Lord, it's all for your
[53:14] purpose.
[53:16] It's all for your good. I know good is
[53:18] going to come out of it one way or
[53:19] another. Even though it doesn't feel
[53:21] good, [music] Lord, we're trusting in
[53:23] you. We're giving you all the honor and
[53:26] the glory because we know that our life
[53:28] is in your hands. [snorts]
[53:30] Father, I just ask that you allow each
[53:33] and every person here to feel
[53:37] that presence
[53:39] that show them that you've been there
[53:41] the whole time, that you've been helping
[53:45] them out.
[53:47] that every need that you [music] have,
[53:49] all you have to do is just give to him.
[53:53] And Lord, [music] you will fulfill it.
[53:55] Father,
[53:57] we want to give you the honor and the
[53:59] glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[54:00] pray. Amen.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; [music]
[54:01] &gt;&gt; an amen.
