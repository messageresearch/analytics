TRANSCRIPT
========================================
on Wednesday night we were speaking on housed but homeless I want to give a quick review on that it does TI tie into where we were last Sunday on the unhoused and the homeless we kind of use that phrasing just to break up the fact that uh you can be unhoused and you could be homeless or you could be uh unhoused but yet have a home and some sense of community and we were focusing more on the idea that you can have a house but still not have what really makes a home and that was our thought on Wednesday night on housed but homeless and how that brother brandham begins to identify what a home is and what home life should be and what makes a house a home uh those a lot of that was just review principles for us and we're kind of arriving at this thought that we're not having a housing crisis but we have a home crisis and where we are homeless is there's less love there's less support there's less togetherness and there's less closeness and brother Brandon begins to look at this in his day and age and see that everyone's off doing something else in some of the family activities of prayer and reading the Bible and this togetherness is lost and being divided and being fractured I even think in some ways um everyone being at home all the time whether it be uh homeschool and working at home and let me just say this now as a church we don't have uh any kind of homeschool agenda uh matter of fact I think you should be more prayerful about homeschooling and maybe even you should about sending kids to school uh because it's not just it's not for everyone so if I mention homeschool just because we do it doesn't mean you should doesn't mean it's the right way uh the right way is how you feel led and God will bless you in either one of those public school private school homeschooling just let the Lord have his way and he will watch out over you let me just say it if your kids go to public school God's Great there too he can keep and they can educate them they can keep them they can have a testimony and they can win souls by their witness at school and I'm just thinking in this way that sometimes since we're always at home together and the mother's at home teaching the kids the dad at home working uh always together that the fact that we're always around each other we take that time for granted so there's no real quality time together always in one another's proximity but never never really in one another's presence and so it's just that kind of day and age to the advancement of technology and the things that uh we appreciate and enjoy can just fracture us and we have less time together less love less support and that's where I'd say we're homeless because we have less home and I want to uh I'd like to be get get into some very specifics and you probably hear me say that a lot and you're wondering when am I when am I going to get specific but uh practically how are we settling for just having a house but not having a vision for home life where we're so busy making sure we have the house and the house paid and the car and all these things we're so busy about those natural things that we've never really taken time to have a vision for home life for relationships and for life outside of the home for our children and what would that look like and so we should ask ourselves what should a home look like what should it feel like what ought a home provide what are the things that a home should provide because a house gives us Shelter From The Elements a house gives us a place to keep our possessions a house gives us a place to lay our head uh those are tangibles what are the intangibles that home ought to provide that are missing so that we're essentially housed but homeless if they're not there and if I could say this this is our been kind of the driving inspiration is a vision will get us out of homelessness a vision will get us out of homeless revelation of God's will will get us out of homelessness that if we follow in in God's will sometimes we can find ourselves in places where we have certain things that are provided but it doesn't feel like homes so what do we need we need God's will to find home to be at rest to be at peace and so that applies to the individual applies to families and applies to a church you could you ought to be finding um that in your own individual lives we need to find that as a family and as a church uh there needs to be a vision for that as well now let's look together at Proverbs chapter 24 as we're still we're transitioning now from how but homeless and I'll give you my title here just in a moment Proverbs 24: 3 and 4 through wisdom is a house builded and by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the Chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches if you take notes write those three words down wisdom understanding knowledge somewhere in a column maybe depending on how you do it maybe even just right there you could underline them uh uh and put a box around them something just to say these are three words uh that we want to be listening for today because wisdom builds the house understanding is what establishes it and is going to if you want to say frame it or erect it uh in in such a way to held together and then knowledge is going to um put the things in it that make it happy and pleasant and precious and so wisdom we could say is the foundation of the home understanding Builds on that wisdom and then knowledge is going to fill it and if we're looking at ourselves as individuals or as a family as a church we realize that we W uh the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom faith is that fear that reverence and respect and so we see that we're established on a basis then God wants to give us understanding so that we grow and knowledge and understanding and Revelation and through that and then knowledge of the Divine knowledge of the Holy those things begin to fill us up to where there's No Vacancy and there's no nothing that is empty so wisdom builds understanding establishes knowledge fills now that's uh that's one of the key Parts there for this morning now my title is I'm quoting the devil I buy homes anybody ever seen the Billboards We Buy Houses all right well there's another company you may not have heard of and it's I buy homes and I'm quoting Satan and so we've used this for dramatic effect this title slide and if it seems a little dark to you this was less dark than the other ones I came up with we did a little uh testing at home a little marketing and we found that this one would result in fewer uh nightmares um and the cartoon one just wasn't pulling it off so this is Satan as a a home buyer and when I say I buy homes I'm quoting the devil today and I I'm wanting to do this in a way to kind of get your attention and get you thinking because this is what I'm want us to think about is how Satan tricks us into selling our homes am he tricks us I how many of you have are are living in a house that's worth several hundred, and you get a letter in the mail saying we'll buy your house for $36,000 and it's as if we're going to be like okay cash offer let's do it and so that's and and you think it's crazy but guess what the devil lets us sell our homes for much less and so there's some extreme extremely practical principles in here for us to glean from as we use this for maybe dramatic effect you could call it clickbait I don't know if that's what brother Elliott called it but there there it might be just to get your attention but I want to get your attention with this Satan is looking to buy a home and are you in the market and think of some real practical things but first I want to lay a scriptural basis or some footing before I go further into our uh maybe the responsibilities of home life and how those things can be eroded but as we go forward let's just glean some practical ways to do better to build the house of the Lord individually as families and as a church so though I'm wanting to look into the scripture maybe use some doctrinal things and and a particular principle that we might say is a type on how Satan works and the way he's done things before uh we're do glean practice iCal principles by looking at a situation in the scripture say oh that's how Satan worked then I wonder if he works the same way today uh in a not in the same way he did on that scale but maybe in a smaller scale in my own life and so I want to draw inspiration from God's original home for mankind and that would be Eden that God created the heavens and the Earth and then he brought forth creation upon the Earth and then he and he establishes um Eden and then he begins to uh bring things forth and if I could say this and I want to read a couple statements from Christ as a mystery of God revealed Eden is a preview of God's ultimate home where God is resident with man and we've seen that image uh back and forth quite a bit through a number of different sermons brother baham says and Christ is the mystery of God revealed there's a number of statements I do not have on slides today because I want you to be listening uh as the Lord would lead you to listen and grab a hold of things and not so much reading he says watch Redeemed by Christ the second Adam going back home to Eden with his Fallen wife redeemed back home again so there's Eden is home there's something embodied in Eden that God created that is home that's Christ in the church today taking his wife back see the threefold mystery now God manifested in Christ Christ manifest in the church altto together to bring back the original Adam and Eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and Same Spirit and everything else now in those principles that we should be familiar with how in Christ's mystery of God revealed how that that three-fold mystery of Christ God being revealed in Christ and how that relates to Christ the fullness in Christ Christ in his bride the third part going back to Eden it's it's phrased with home that's where home is going back home he says it this way making his mystery known to his bride tree Redeemed by Christ the second Adam going back home to be restored back to the original Eden free from Death sickness sorrow shame going back with eternal life so there's Eden represents home for us Eden represents something very precious to us something uh that what God was foreshadowing and expressing because when we talk about going back to Eden we're not time traveling back in a but what we're doing is we're traveling out of time back into eternity and remember God has promised us a future home not just a future house right right right so it's a home there's something about home brother brandham talks about God's future home and the future home of Christ and his bride and and when a man chooses a wife it speaks of his vision for home not the type of house he's going to build but the kind of home life he's going to have and so Eden represents and holds for us an image and a type of what home should be or how God wanted to structure home and it's it's just embodied in a lot of different details and elements but let's just turn to Genesis chapter 2: 8 I find myself always preaching from and drawing inspiration from the first three chapters of the Bible and it says and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden there he put the man whom he had formed so he places Adam in a home he he creates Eden then he plants a garden in Eden and there in the garden he puts the man he places him there and Eden was an extensive region it was not just it didn't just uh wasn't just the garden but it was this region of Great Beauty and great resources and uh and you know the planting and the soil and the the temperature everything just perfect and so this Eden was a pleasant place it was a great expanse of of uh just wealth and beauty and then God plants a garden this Garden is a happy Paradise for man and when he places man there he desires to essentially train the man God as the parent God as the father and with his parental care is going to bring Adam up and going to train him and equip him and place him and then for the purpose of handing off what he's created to Adam so God left this Legacy of his own creation to Adam which we see is what happens throughout the Old Testament we see over and over again that father's build the son is a builder of the family name and the father has an inheritance that or a kingdom that is inherited by the sun and it just keeps perpetually repeating itself and that was the idea that God had in the very beginning as he plants man in Eden Adam is under his parental care and it's beautiful to see how that God is going to work with Adam even before he brings the woman out of him because Adam's got to have a vision and a placing for his own life before he can bring the woman out of him and that she can have a place amen so God created a home in Eden and we know that he created it by the spoken word and it was governed and cultivated and protected by his spoken word amen in Isaiah chapter 32: 18 this scripture has has been one of our partner scriptures in this series and my people shall dwell in a Peaceable habitation and ured dwellings and in quiet resting places this home home in Eden is the first embodiment when it comes to mankind living and dwelling his first Peaceable habitation was the Garden in Eden God had made a home in Eden this was the Garden of God's delight and we even find in the Bible that God would come down in the cool of the day and walk with Adam it wasn't just a one-time occurrence as we reading in Genesis chapter 3 where that day God all of a sudden showed up but he came walking in the cool of the day as he often would have and God's presence amongst them so it's a garden of God's Delight it's a Peaceable habitation it was a sure dwelling it was a quiet resting place amen when brother brandham says that we're going back home to Eden we're reading scriptures that tell us this is God's framework this was God's foundation and his this was his home that we're going back to and we call it future home but then we know that mankind Falls and through sin and unbelief mankind is is going to leave this Garden and we know he doesn't leave the world he doesn't leave the Earth but he leaves something that was present on Earth in Genesis chapter 3: 23 to 24 and we touched on these things when we were preaching on the kingdom and um a lot of other different places where we've looked at this and when we go back over this I'm I'm not just wanting to repeat it so that we better understand Genesis chapter 3 and the repetition of these particular verses isn't so that we can have them memorized but to be making constant application of things that were written beforehand to our present lives in the hopes that God can Enlighten us to our present situation and his presence and so there's things that we can learn from these things says therefore God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life we could say this is Eden Lost Paradise Lost this is Adam and the woman at this point when God sent him forth from the garden so now as he leaves the garden he's still in Eden he's still in this he's still somewhat near uh to where the garden was but he's going to be kicked out of this uh Happy Paradise is now lost and Adam is kicked out and if I can say this Adam and the woman become homeless and I know that you say well that may be a little bit contrived but just bear with me Adam and the woman now are kicked out of their house of of of the garden kicked out of the home that was and now they find themselves in a very hostile world as God describes it in these prior verses but then God does something where he places cherubims with flaming swords east of the Garden of Eden so it it shows that there's a garden the angels are east of it man kind has been banished out of it it says to keep now think of this phrase to keep the way of the tree of life now when we think of the way of the tree of life I think our initial thought and it's not incorrect necessarily is that there would have there's like a road and now there's a toll booth and there used to be a road through there and now the bridge has been torn down but the way of the tree of life it's the tree of life so this is something Central to living this is something Central to life and it's not just a a path or a literal path but it's the correct path for Success it's the the right way to live it's the only way to have life so the way of the Tree of Life speaks of a a vision an understanding of life it speaks of real living and it is something Central to True success the Bible says in Proverbs chap 22:6 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he'll not Depart of it depart from it so when it says the way of the tree of life it's more than a path but way of life a manner of living that keep the way of the tree of life it's not just a road but it is a way of life and now when it says that they have been kicked out of the garden and there's Cher bums there to keep the way of life in other words there's a way to live that cannot be corrupted there's a right kind of living that is now going to be kept but in being kept it's not necessarily easily accessible by mankind or even understood by mankind so how I want to basically say this is there has has been a change in the way of life that in the Garden of Eden there was a way of life and even though mankind had not partaken of the tree of life now God says he can't because there's no living he can't eat that and live as I want him to uh in his current condition so he's going to keep the right way to live and it's hidden it's a mystery it can only come one way well there's a lot that can be expressed in that but so there's now when mankind leaves the garden his way of life changes not going to live the same way he was living before and I I hope that's a principle that we could kind of grab on to and be a little bit sticky now in Genesis 4: 16-1 17 this is the way of life after the garden and even especially with this hybrid nature and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden so we could see that his pride and his sin are driving him further away from God and further away from the way of the tree of life just and the way the scriptures describing it is there was a way of the Tree of Life there was a manner of living there was a condition a joy a happiness a pleasantness in the garden and when man sins he's left the way of the Tree of Life And now when Cain goes further he's getting further away of the way of the tree of life so he's still living but his manner of life is very different than the manner of life that we ought to have had or could have had if we in his presence or seeking his presence so Cain is running away whereas we could see the sons of Seth are essentially beholding Eden looking at the way of the garden and calling on the name of the Lord and identifying themselves with the way of the tree of life even though they can't partake in it I hope that I hope that I can paint the picture today and in in a way that God or I hope God can paint the picture to you and if he has to use my words as a brush may his Spirit just be the color to to help this be very Vivid to you so Cain's going further away from the right kind of living he's going further away from what the Garden in Eden represented and it says and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear Enoch and he build it a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch now in looking at this looking at this before we saw how that this city the even the word that's being used here it was it's a a city is a place not just a Dwelling Place not just an encampment but it had these characteristics to where it was always uh it was always on guard in a wake it was a place guarded by waking or by a watch so when Cain built the city it wasn't uh Without Walls and and just anyone who wanted to come and there was peace and there was rest and there was kind of this uh security and just believing we all we're all related we're all family and whenever someone says we're all family we all go but there's uh it was just this idea of everyone being being together it didn't exist so he had to build up walls why because of fear and so because of tear and because of fear he wanted to protect him himself and he wanted to protect his family and he was afraid of consequences and so he had to build a city to kind of give himself some security so without rest and joy he was now scheming ways to bring happiness to bring quietness to bring security and if I could say this to kind of quiet his fear he's getting further away from the manner the way of living and in order to make himself feel better about himself and to save himself from himself and to quiet his fears because this is his way of trying to come up with a Peaceable habitation ass sure dwelling a quiet resting place let's build a fortified place with watch and guards so we can kind of go ah rest at night so this was his own ways of trying to scheme happiness and and and this is Mankind's uh Instinct after the fall when he's gotten away from the garden when he's when now that he's homeless he's got to figure out a way to encamp himself to protect protect what he has and to fend for what he wants now that's in the image of Cain it's going to be important to come back to that here in a little bit if I could say this the world was no longer Adam's home when you begin to see that there's cities being dwelt and there's fear that's coming upon Mankind and there's this division h a and there's a differences in visions and and intent the world is no longer Adam's home despite the fact that he still lived in it so when Adam and the woman sinned it wasn't that they all of a sudden just started floating in space and now they've been come untethered from the earth and now they don't they need to you know they float to another planet that they can house themselves on they still live in the place that they were from they still lived in the the world that one that we were given dominion over they are there living in a house but again this is just my the benefit of repetition for myself they still didn't have a home now we could skip all the way ahead to Revelations chapter 5 and this is like a real leap this is going really really far a Quantum Leap would have been to go to verse 18 in Genesis 4 but this one is a real big leap Revelations 5: 7-10 we're now looking at God addressing the fact that Adam is homeless not just Adam but us mankind humanity and the scene is Before the Throne of of God and he has a book in his hand which is sealed with Seven Seals and verse 7even speaks of the Lion of the tribe of Judah who was as a lamb he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The the four Beast and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints as soon as the book is in the hands of Christ the four beasts and the four and20 Elders are immediately reacting to it and then upon this physical reaction of of themselves where they they they they fall down and then now as they have fallen they're going to raise their voices and they sung a new song now this is new this is there's a newness to it saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof now that's the event that prompts the falling down and the lifting up of this new song and this is the effect or this is more descriptions of him for thou was slain and now the effect and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation that's the effect of the sacrifice of the Lamb so as it's describing more what he has done now the full impact of the book being taken and the seals being loosed and Hast made us under our God Kings and Priests and notice this and we shall reign on the earth that's that phrase that the I thought the Lord directed me to that when you look at Adam as king and as ruler of the whole earth given Dominion power over everything he loses that through the fall and from that moment there has never been a king like that over the whole earth never been one that could say I'm rightful this is mine I'm I have dominion there's none that had that full Authority and power as a as a man a man from that time but now after the seals are open and the events that unfold there under and the things that are loose there under it says we shall reign on the earth Reign on Earth not it says as Kings and Priests not as mortal Kings have reigned in the past because they could say uh King James could say well I've I'm not talking about LeBron I'm talking about King James could say i' I've I reigned on our Earth I was a king and this King I've reigned and and they could all say rained on Earth say well technically yes that's true but not like this they shall reign on the earth in full possession with full legal Authority not just a title that they're a king and not just some subplot not just loyal followers but there would be this is if I could say this this is this is home coming back to Earth Earth becoming a home again when mankind fell God so God is God has the parent has a son creates a son Adam and he says I give this to you but when he deed it to Adam there was a c there was a claw in there that if he did something that he was going to lose right that there there was a clause in the deed there was this restrictive covenant in what did he given uh it was we know that it was a conditional Covenant and so when we think in terms of uh the disposition of property or bequeathing this to Adam there there was something in there that could undo the inheritance and so when Adam lost it follow me this is an important part when Adam lost his kingship in full ownership over the Earth he couldn't give it to Satan the the title the right the power the legal ownership of Eden the legal ownership of the earth went back to God so Adam forfeited his right in ownership according to the word of God back to God the Creator the original owner when he fell and once this happens Adam doesn't he's not evicted from the earth he's evicted from the garden right but he still remains with a promise and certain covenants on the earth with the Earth as a house but it had lost its Heavenly character and Mankind no longer had if I could say it this way he no longer had the full title and authority over the world and this is what's happened in Revelations chapter 5 when the response of the 420 Elders is we're going to rain on the earth they're realizing now they're being brought got back to a a position that Christ foreshadowed when he was on Earth because he controlled everything he was showing that what Adam lost in the fall was being restored back to Mankind and that's why Satan tries to preempt it by saying I'll give you the kingdoms I'll give them to you because he wanted him to do it without actual title Revelations chapter 5 part two if I can this Adam paid the price and lost it so Christ needed to pay the price to get it back so now looking at these verses here in Revelations chapter 5 part two our Kinsman is handed the seven sealed book of redemption oh good I got this one here from the original owner when we lost it in the Garden of Eden through Adam it went back to the original owner that's plain brother brand when he's preaching uh the this the church ages he's preaching these things in 1961 our Kinsman is handed the seven sealed book of redemption from God so God had it that's who had it but it went back into the hands of God after Adam lost it so when Adam held was on Earth God said Adam you are God on Earth the Earth is Yours just as the heavens are mine just as Heaven is mine so Adam has it and just by way of dramatization when Adam sinned God came back and when he's banishing him out of the garden he's saying Adam I need the deed back I I I you need to give me all that back what I told you the day you eat you're going to Forfeit certain rights give it back to me and again I'm just dramatizing maybe the devil's thinking wait a minute I I I seduced I wanted to I wanted to get access to that I wanted to own that but it goes back into the hands of the of the original owner and so Satan cannot get to it though I believe he wanted it and he was after it and so there's something that um he misses out on but stay with this now because notice what he says he says but there's been a poacher on the land a squatter and that's Satan he's come over he's a poacher the Earth don't belong to him belongs to God but he's a poacher a squatter he goes man I how I could say say something right now but I better not man I wish you would have said it it might have had something to do with squatters a squatter is one who unlawfully inhabits a land or dwelling one who occupies a squatter is one who occupies without legal title it's used in reference reference to homeless people who inhabit buildings they don't own or structures they don't own and that's why by a place when one it doesn't own something and they live there they're squatting and where they live is called a squatted it's just kind of legal terms there I'm being serious it's called a squage not a cottage maybe if you say it fast enough people think you live in a cottage oh we got a nice squage in the The Hamptons this year I think a cottage in the Hamptons that's nice the Earth didn't belong to him it belonged to God but now he's a poacher a squatter he said is the title deed of our Redemption this seven sealed book it's the title deed when we go back to Revelations 5 we're dealing with in type title deed and transfer of ownership and rightful title you wait till we get into those seals he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming the kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping in himself he gives it back back to the people that's his love for us I I hope that we can draw in type that if one day this world that became the domain a a a squage for the devil because man had lost his full title right and Authority in other words the devil was there squatting and we like well devil you don't belong here you shouldn't be doing this he's like prove it to me you like well there's Cloud on title I I can't really exactly uh uh uh I don't know how to enforce my claim I don't know how to prove it but now at the open of the seals and this book coming into the hands of our kinsman redeemer he's wanting to give it out to us so that we can understand that this entire Creation in world was made for us it's our legal right and possession and if that is so of it all how much more of my individual life my family and our church amen that's his love for us and then he says oh Satan the possessor of it now the squatter so he's a possessor of it now just a possessor and I know people think nine1 of the law is possession and I still don't even really know what that means necessarily but it's you I think in other words it conveys the idea that if somebody has something the law is on their side most likely that that's going to be that's a hard thing to rebut and so when brother brandham calls the devil a squatter he's living somewhere that he doesn't own and he makes reference to title deed he makes reference to abstract he makes reference to deed and you'll find in legal terms they're all different things and but yet at the end of the day they're all for the purpose of identifying who's the rightful owner or to convey ownership and here in the way that he describes it he's saying this is the title deed given to his people so a a title deed is a legal deed it's a legal document which constitutes the evidence of the right of ownership so the title deed is not just going to say God on it if he's conveying it to us as an inheritance that's going to have your name on it you are going to be on that title deed as the one who has a lawful right to inhabit and to possess full right and authority over it when the deed went into the hands of Adam there was a restrictive covenant that unless he used it for these purposes he the ownership had to revert back to God anybody familiar with these terminologies in actual real estate law brother John of course and that there's ideas where you can sell somebody land and you can say uh Elliott you can use this for as long as you want for a house but as soon as you turn it into a hockey arena ownership reverts back to me and those are true restrictive covenants I think Phoenix is probably looking for a new hockey team now but there's ways that you can make sure that something never happens on that land and it's legal to do it such that if something happens boom it goes right it's deed restrictions boom goes right back uh there's some sort of reversion of what's taking place and unwinding of the transaction or there's another conveyance to the estate or the those that would be the rightful heirs so the title deed brother B is saying is this legal Authority it constitutes evidence of the right of ownership but Satan right now has possession but what he doesn't have is a title what he doesn't have is any deed evidencing a right he can't produce a title that he owns it and in the absence of a a title because you could have a title it says well there's no my name's not on the title but here's a deed where the person who's on the titles conveyed it to me right right there's different orders of preferences that if and you got to know what what it is in the state you live in cuz somebody could sell you a property and then sell it to somebody else and whoever gets there first and files is the one that owns it and so the title could show a name you could have a deed that shows your name and the name on the title has deeded it to you and say I have a deed and that needs to be filed right that would need to be filed to show that the one who had proper title has now conveyed it to you you didn't know you were going to get your CL or your real estate agent license credits for the year and let's all go take our test later there's a lot in here that you can draw from but Satan has possession but the title doesn't have his name on it and he can't show you any deed anywhere where he got it Revelations 20: 1 to5 now says and I saw an angel come down that's verse one there though I missed the one and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil in Satan this sounds like it was written by a lawyer you want to properly identify the party right you don't want there to be any ambiguity as to who is going who's going to be be dispossessed you want to be able to know with clear sufficiency and establish the burden of proof that he's the one he's the one this is happening to and bound him a thousand years this is the squatter the world is no longer his squage he the poacher has been kicked off and cast him into a bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should not that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season but now the squatter is dispossessed he's taken away he's been removed he's been banished and and this is different than when Adam left too if we could think about that and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads are in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years now this is that symmetry to Revelations chapter 5 now Christ the squatter is gone now we live and rain on Earth in a Peaceable habitation without the threat of an enemy in a sure dwelling and quiet resting places because the squatter the deceiver the enemy has been dispossessed and the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection this is taking back full possession in Revelations chapter 5 part two again brother Bram says Satan is a squatter he don't legally own this and he's had 2,000 years of fuss whether he owns it or somebody else owns it but Christ came as the kinsman redeemer and redeemed it back to us are you are you able to kind of enter into Fellowship around the reality of the world being something that God created that he wanted us to have and fully to possess fully and it was the the the legal possession and rulership and ownership and full authority of it was lost but that power didn't necessarily wasn't necessarily stolen and assumed by Satan he could Forge AED all he wants and he could fabricate all sorts of paperwork and create thousands of denominations to try to prove it but the reality is God has it but God all along Redemption was to give it back to us not that it would forever be Satan's or forever ruled by sin but God had legal title passed back to him he was proactive he knew what was going to happen so he structured it such a way that Adam the day you sin is the day that the devil owns the world it was no that day happens there's things you lose but God was not going to lose the world and he redeems it back to us but Satan possesses it but you know after a while this great fight's over he'll be cast into the Lake of Fire he'll be done away with and all them who worships with him but the SS of Salvation will come with Christ that's gonna come and he says now he's a squatter we got a new name for the devil you squatter it's what he is don't let him make your heart a squage don't him don't don't him don't him let don't let him turn your house into his squaded and God forbid that he would ever turn our church into a squage in 2 Corinthians chapter 4:4 in light of the fact that he's a poacher and a squatter what has he been able to do Paul even says this of the devil in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is in the image of God should shine unto them I know that it's worthy to focus on how he has blinded the minds of them that don't believe uh unless the because if they don't believe then the light can't shine in Christ who is in the image of God cannot have the Impact deep within the soul so he wants to put up these barriers he wants to Blind the eyes but notice don't gloss over this this is where brother b gets the God of this evil age from and whom the God of this world there's an actual phrasing to where the God of this world where Satan has made this world his own yes now despite the fact that the literal Earth and the literal world and all that is in it he doesn't have he doesn't have creative power over and nor did he have legal title over it but he's made it his own to where it's now called Satan's Eden on and located in an atmosphere and on a ground that are spoken word attributes of God he has been able to establish Satan's Eden he has made it in other words in a perverted sense his home right brother B teaches us that God's Eden was established in righteousness and Satan's Eden is established in sin and that's where he's at home it says in Revelations 17: 18 and the woman which thou sawest in that great city which reth over the kings of the earth so here is this image of Babylon and this cruel woman beautiful but yet cruel and and all the images that uh associate with Babylon in that Kingdom of the world it says it Reigns over the kings of the earth so he through the woman and through Babylon Reigns over the kings of the Earth but not over the Earth in the same way that we would rule he has to rule by proxy he has to rule by controlling all these little things and the Kings themselves are not the rulers they're being uh reigned and ruled over by sin and by unbelief and by demonic powers at the allowance of God to fulfill his perfect will but this woman Reigns over the kings of the earth not she could not actually Reign Over the Earth in the same way that we are made Kings and Priests to Reign Over the earth and the way that we will in that thousand years to reign with Christ a thousand years it's not the same thing it would be foolish to equate what they do on Earth today as mortal Kings and as these kings that the woman Reigns over on the earth because he cannot truly Reign on Earth because it's not his right he reigns over the Kings but he's a squatter on the earth now that's that is uh this is a junction point and I'm probably right at that point where I could stop and make some fans that's not my side gig in other words get some people on my side Paul was a Tent Maker brother Aaron makes fans but the question then is this because that I this is way this is the way it works in my mind so now as we've gotten to this point I hope we can see this picture of the garden is home in Eden man has full right title and possession of the whole thing and the garden is especially his home God visits there it's a beautiful place then through sin the title of the whole world and home is lost by Adam great channels become clogged he's pushed out of the garden he now lives in the world and the the way the world has gone is it's got more worldly more sinful more sinful why because God took 6,000 years to make his Eden and to place man there Satan ever since then has been building his home building his Eden but he does it without full right legal possession he's a squatter so he's turned the world which is Adam's house now but should have been his home he's turned it into his own home home and so as we went further into the time we're living in now Revelations chap 3 the L to seen age would perfectly encapsulate this was drawn to it but I realize there's a lot of repetition in that for us then we've already looked forward to the time when possession is taken away from Satan he's thrown in jail and therefore we whose names are on the title not by proxy but full legal right and authority to the Earth we will reign over the Earth forever amen especially in that thousand year period and the condition that it'll be in just to demonstrate uh that possession and full right and title so I'm going to back up how did Adam go from house and home to housed and homeless how how did this happen why did this happen it's important to look at this because after all we're driving this point home for ourselves individually as families and as a church and how that we can be housed but not really be in the perfect will of God in 1 Peter 5: 6-1 let's look at as the Bible said the dragon the serpent the devil Satan in legal terms sufficiently identifying by his meats and Bounds and physical description we for sure that we've identified the squatter the poacher he says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you beautiful words humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God so key submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he'll flee resistance without submission is futile if you don't submit to God your resistance will give up so first humble yourselves that you may be exalted cast your cares your anxieties unburden yourself he cares be sober be vigilant now this is our responsibility we are to Humble ourselves and cast our cares upon him so he's got to give us the mighty hand to Humble ourselves too we got to cast our cares upon Him and Trust to him and now we have to be V sober be vigilant there's a lot of amplification we can give to that but why because your adversary your enemy the squatter the poacher the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour if I could say this drawing from the knowledge that you have in the scripture thou Hast been in the Garden of Eden Satan was in the garden looking for a house to make a home right that's what Satan was doing he is a he is always looking always seeking always wanting to take advantage your adversary the devil is always working an angle he's walking about seeking whom he may devour he's wanting to consume he's wanting to take up he was on Earth looking for life he was on Earth looking to create he was on Earth looking for access to possess I I'm forgetting the name of the book now but I read a book I don't know if I should say it but I read a book The only reason I don't want to say it is because I believe that they made it into a movie and I wouldn't want anyone to try to go out and watch the movie a number of years ago I read an excellent book and now I'm going to have to change the names and change the places and in a very small country in Eastern Europe there was these tribes that had been dispossessed of their land and put in uh uh land which was not farmable and you couldn't it was just Rocky hard rough land and so these these these bands of people were put on this land that the the rulers of that day felt were insignificant well they discovered gold in them Hills essentially and now all of a sudden that land became very very valuable and this demeaned belittle tribe now became the richest people in the land because of the gold they owned in the land but being the biggest they were and those Eastern Europeans is they didn't think these minorities were smart enough to manage their Affairs so they were given trustees over their land to manage their finances and to manage their money and so one man came up with the idea that because all these families owned all these different plots with the gold in it and this man had the idea that if he could get his nephew if I remember correctly to marry one of these tribal women and he could systemat atically kill all of her heirs that eventually all the gold would be owned by his nephew why because where was I going with this this doesn't even make any sense anymore you know Cisco and Ebert gave it two thumbs up I'm having to look at where I was in other words this guy was like a roaring lion right and he was conspiring ways that he could get ownership and possession by Murder By Deceit by all sorts of means in a way that he could uh he could uh accumulate wealth because he wanted the greed was behind it and and and there was no there was nothing uh beneath him he was willing to do whatever it would took in order to kill and to murder entire families so that he could consolidate all the wealth and all the possessions into his hands and if it doesn't read like Satan's script I don't know what does it's exactly what Satan thought he could do in the beginning by getting to the woman he thought he could get to the man and by access to her he was hoping to be able to get access to all of it so it could be his and he could rule and Reign isn't that what he desired I want to exalt myself above I want to be the title holder I want full legal Authority I want to be God and so it's still Satan's ambition today as it was then he was in the garden looking for a house to make his own brother brandham says in Satan's Eden it's been and now is Satan esta lishing his kingdom in Earth that's exactly why he's doing it he wants to establish his own kingdom read this now as a businessman that's not a Christian he'll work every scheme he can to make you see something the wrong way let's not be too theological let's think daily living in every single way and I know it puts us on guard and we could be like well what's the use anyhow it's just all one big sh well it's not a bad idea to have some healthy skepticism but all the things the devil floats to us and the world floats to us and these things that are presented to us because he's working every scheme he can to make you see something the wrong way if he's got a person and a purpose and personal gain and making you doing that make you seeing it that way he'll show you everything he can and keep you off from the truth of it because he's got a feeling only for himself no matter how much he lies and cheats and whatever more he's got personal gain Satan has a business card it says I buy homes and he's going to knock on your door and he's going to try to work a deal and he'll use every scheme he can he'll lie he'll cheat he'll present things to you he'll show things to you manipulate control can contrive be religious you name he's going to do everything he can in a way to get you to sell the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chap 11: 14 and 15 I need to go quickly now it's 11:30 and I really uh um I I I think I might just close where we are stopping very very short of where I want to be but I want to do it in a way that's uh beneficial to you so remember that I wanted to expand more but Satan is a businessman who's in business to transact and and even when you're the one buying something or even when he's the one buying he's the one selling he he's got to sell you something first to get you uh to get you to sell to him is what the woman in the beginning this is what happened it says Satan himself was transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works the appearance is a disguise his appearance is a disguise with the intent to deceive with the intent to lead astray he's got personal gain he's selling and he's also buying he's transacting for his own good you should ask yourself in any given situation when somebody offers you something or offers you something or is offering something for something you have or offering you something in exchange for something ask what's in it for them because it might seem to you apparent what's in it for you but you should ask what's in it for them and really what's in it for me like what am I really getting out of this you've offered me this car for free but why why are you doing this what are you getting out of this I had a situation here in my life recently where something was offered to me at um a couple years ago I think now something was offered to me and it was wow you should take it this is a fantastic opportunity and I was like no uh-uh I don't want it and then other events happened later on I realized it was a trap that had I done that the mess I would have been in or how I would have tried to get myself out of the consequences of it would have been a just would have very very difficult I believe God could have rescued me but it was his grace at the time for me to say nah I realize what's in it for me looks really really really good but even if you seem to be sincere in your heart and there's nothing in it for you I need to have wisdom that really what's going on here what's behind the scenes what's the motive and objective and I know we run the risk that when we leave church today and someone says Hey I want to take you to lunch my treat you're going to be oh whoa what are you up to right I and it's not just to make ourselves suspicious of one another if anything we need to get to know one another better spend time with one another get to know one another amen did I finish the story about that tribe in Europe are we satisfied where that went I think they ended up undoing it it's a phenomenal book now if he brother John if you could show my title slide I I need to start providing this maybe a little bit more accessible format if he only showed up like this and I use this to convey the image of this is what's happening but he doesn't show up with the horns you know when did he become a hornless devil where's the tail where's the Pitchfork where's the voice right come on I want you to smell like Brimstone I want you to have flies around you I want to know it's you Satan but he transforms he's transformed into an angel of Light his ministers themselves as Ministers of righteousness they're not righteous but they appear as it if it was only this easy when Lucifer himself old Satan the Devil the dragun the deceiver the poacher the squatter if only his business card said I'm the squatter I'm looking for a squage and we know no I don't know that I want my house to be a squage and he' be like give me that right I want the card back I only printed so many but but it's not this easy this is not his business card this is not his show on home and garden Network or whatever it is right even though maybe it make a good idea the he is in this business so now and I don't think I have these quotes my next scripture is Luke 16 brother John I'm going to come to it here in a moment but I'm going to work through this really really fast listen to these things that brother Bram says cuz we're asking how did how did Adam go from house and home to homeless in the second seal brother Brandon speaking of the church says she sold her birth rights her virtuous right of the word so this is a church that does it and then he's making the parallel that the church in NAA the church under the force of the Catholic church and this transaction with the Antichrist Spirit she sold her birthrights he says when ID did it she lost the creation whole creation fell under her what did Eve do as being co-equal with Adam she sold to the she sold her Birthright she sold her her rights to the word to Satan right now you're thinking wait a minute I think but she sold something right he can't have legal possession so she sold something he said in the third seal the very next day and E forfeited her virtuous rights and gave them over to Satan in the Garden of Eden and he's saying the church does the same thing it forfeits her Bible and then he says if you want to see what's coming so this is really important I'll slow down he says the church did the same thing when they forfeited the Bible for their Creeds and reasonings see how it types you just run those types you're bound to come out right if I've never seen myself and I saw my shadow coming I'll know just about what I look like this is critical to where I'm wanting to arrive if you want to see what is coming look at what has been now I'm wanting you to look at what Satan has done to understand what he's doing if you want to know what's coming look at what's been for for the old all the old things were Shadows of things to come the Bible said and what is he W us to understand the transaction in the garden where Eve lost creation when she sold her birthrights she forfeited her virtuous word the word of God when she sold the Bible and put a man in there that says the church has the rights to change anything they want to change they've done and the bride of Christ the Pentecostal bride sold her virtue at NAA just as Eve sold her virtue to Satan in the Garden of Eden so Eve had something to sell and Satan was buying and Satan bought her virtue now listen for some of these words three kinds of Believers brother Bram speaking of an organization great people yes sir they're organizers they're prosperous successful Smart in worldly wisdom just exactly like Satan did to Eve that little helpless woman so he had a he was shrewd he had a wisdom he had a gospel he came right to her and tried to sell her on the idea that she would be wiser than what she was and that's what she was looking for instead of staying right with the word said he wanted to to what the word said he wanted to sell her on the idea that she would be wiser and she bought his product and they still do the same thing today Satan is still selling products and the woman is still buying products because she was a byproduct he wanted to sell her on the men are buying products too because he brought forth a byproduct he came to her to sell her he sold her she sold he bought thinking man's filter and he's equating Eve and Judas together and how Judas sold for 30 pieces of silver sold their birthrights for a satisfaction of the taste of the knowledge of civilization that's exactly what Eve sold her birthrights for she sold it for a taste of science for a little taste of worldly knowledge so now you have worldly wisdom and worldly knowledge she sold it a little better church a little better class of people today it would be called now are you recognizing a pattern to the transaction you have the word you have the way of the tree of life you have a garden a happy Paradise you have protection and provision and everything that God wants to provide there's this word way of life where God is you're going to protect you he's going to give you pleasure all those things and now there's this wrestling cuz Satan comes and he wants to buy something and he's promising that in the transaction you'll get be better off you'll get out of debt you'll have a better job you'll have a better boss you'll have better this you'll have better that better opportunities he has want something he wants to sell you by worldly wisdom by worldly knowledge and he wants to give you a taste for something better in the first seal brother B was talking about an Assemblies of God preacher and he says that they were trying to get one of his children on a television show to see if he was smarter than the next man that would run for president and he said he's got a lot of wisdom so has Satan he tries to sell it Satan's trying to sell wisdom he sold it to Eve he sold it to us so Satan is selling in you wisdom and knowledge and as he tries to sell you this wisdom and knowledge you are going to buy it in exchange you've got to give him something so he is buying something from you and he's using knowledge and wisdom as that uh as part of the transaction it's part of the consideration it's part of the contract if you'll let me have this I'll give you this and this is what comes with it and begin think oh better better better better oh this is good in Luke Chapter 16:8 let's see who should I ask if I've run out of time or eyes are just D darting out of the room and the Lord commanded the unjust Steward I'm jumping right into the middle of a parable but something he says in here that stands out to me because he had done wisely and this is as it's presented in the attitude of the Lord he's used in a phrase that the Jews would have used for the CH the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light now to the Jews they were the enlightened ones they're the ones that serve a God and they're the children of light and then there's this sense of the children of this world are wiser in their generation in other words they're Suited for the world that they are of you following they're wiser in their generation it's it's not necessarily implying a particular um progeny but it's children of the world are in the world they seek nothing but the world and they are suited for that as a Gentiles are suited to seek after clothing and Comforts and houses and lands this is just their their nature that way and this is a product of the transaction in the Garden of Eden that Satan set us on this path of accumulating resources and wealth and and possessions and pretense and the politics it's just swn into the hybrid nature of mankind that children of this world are suited for the world that they are of be the fact that you have a natural birth gives you an inclination to Natural Things and if you just follow that path you're Ed for how can I be the richest how can I possess how can I have but brother Bram said the woman swapped the word of God for personal knowledge then he says in the sermon lean not to th own understanding we find that Eve was easily persuaded by Satan from the word yeah we're we'll come to that here in a moment she was easily persuaded by Satan from the word and she leaned on her own understanding because Satan had projected something to her which wasn't to her real understanding of God she has a real understanding of God that suffices that should be anchoring right so then there's this uh present presentation of another understanding which contradicts this and she ought to have said I'll stick with the word but there is more going on here he projects he sells he wants to buy well I'll take this and you I'll give you that let's have some sort of exchange she swaps and he says that she had to have something else told to her by the enemy Satan and she believed it now we find the results of this it plunged the whole human race to death because the first mother on Earth leaned to her own understanding contrary to the word of God and it pledged the whole human race to death and he cares do you care he says we realize that it was reason common reason is that started the ball of sin rolling at the first place it was reasoning what reasoning against the word of God when God told Adam and Eve the day you eat thereof that day you die that settles it that's all of it and he fortified them against the enemy behind his word but when Eve listening to Satan's reasonings culture understanding education advancement see he has something to sell us and if you want to know what's coming look at what's been and be very practical in our own personal lives what is being sold to us ever been told hey just come sit down for an hour and listen to our spill and we'll give you five free nights at a resort in at Rocky Point and you're like let's do this just got to sit there for an hour good luck if it's an hour right and before you know it you're being forced and contriving to buy a time share I thought we're going to have five free nights now we're in bondage for the next 30 Years right you know how it is it's pressure it's pretense they pull on so many different things she stopped stepped out behind the word listened to Satan's reasonings did the thing that God said don't do be very practical about these things today that when God has a word for you to obey in order for you to not do it Satan has bargained in exchange and whether you realize it or not you're transacting with the devil to lose something and what you gain is to your disadvantage and if one reasoning this is this is I feel like I can just race to the finish line now if one reasoning listen list to one reason against the word of God caused all this chaos one reason against the word again won't take you back to the same place if one reasoning caused Adam to be homeless one reason against the word of God caused him to be homeless how much more observant and aware ought we to be on a daily basis about how we can become homeless cuz he how foolish it would be for God to bring man back upon the same basis he sent him out from in other words if he sent him out on the basis because he disobeyed why would God bring you back on the basis of Disobedience remember wisdom builds understanding establishes and knowledge fills each one of these places I could have read you so many more places brother Abraham saying it was wisdom that the devil gave the woman it was not uh understanding that the woman relied on and he gave her and it was knowledge that he sold her right and brother Brandman spoken words of the Original Seed she hybrid it brought the serpent in listening for wisdom understanding and knowledge the things that build a house the things that make a house a home so when Satan was in the Garden of Eden he wasn't just looking uh he wasn't looking in our minds let's be very he wasn't just uh you know you know feeling all Randy and wanted a relationship right we're being adults right he just wasn't wanting to go on a date he wanted to take possession he wanted to be God he wanted to be king and this is his method of operation he's going to sell you wisdom he's going to sell you understand he's going to sell you knowledge for the purpose of you exchanging your home for other elements and you think you're building a home you think you're getting ahead you think you're making progress and you're actually forfeiting virtue you're for fit in real wisdom real understanding real knowledge that is the manner the way of the tree of life and you're taking the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and you're building with wisdom and understanding knowledge and advancement and everything looks like it's clicking and everything's moving along but all along there's a little bit of an emptiness all along there's a lack of spiritual success all along there's an unwinding and unraveling and you need God to wake up your eyes and say wait a minute I've been had we listening for wisdom understanding and knowledge if you're wondering why I'm preaching so long my ears unstopped and someone's going why did I pray why did I even pray brother BR said having faith in all his word his seeds God brought an Eden of Holiness love and eternal life that's what God's Eden produced is Holiness and it brought an Eden of Holiness of love he said understanding Perfection eternal life wisdom knowledge understanding there Eve had Godly wisdom Godly understanding Godly knowledge and Satan wanted to sell a base wisdom a base understanding a base knowledge a perverted worldly so there's your you say well I don't want wisdom you better ask for it we talk about knowledge and understanding there's a worldly knowledge there's an academic knowledge there's a human head knowledge there's an intellectual faith those aren't the things we're talking about we're talking about wisdom understanding and knowledge with all you're getting get understanding right there's a wisdom of the Divine there's a knowledge of the Divine there's things we should be calling upon God for Revelation more than anything amen but brother BR said eve forfeited her virtuous rights he said eve sold her virtue so how did Adam become homeless because the woman engaged in a transaction in which she exchanged home for what she thought would build a better home for what she thought was better and in that transaction Adam instead of making her homeless and houseless Adam forfeited his own rights knowing that what they would lose would go back to God and it would set off a conse I don't know exactly all that he knew but it would set off a a domino effect and a consequence of events where now everybody's raging over possession and the world would no longer be home to the point to where we call ourselves pilgrims and strangers to this day tow dra an analogy in Matthew 12: 43 to 45 look at this by way of an analogy I'm wanting to continue to build if you want to see what is coming look at what has been for all the old things were Shadows of the things to come Eve and a transaction lost her home man Humanity mankind the original lost it's home because Satan was buying the home I haven't quite made this point I'm certain I'll make it before it's over but in other words Satan was saying oh you can keep the house I just want the home you follow me sometimes we're looking more to the Natural Things to find out whether or not we're successful and Satan's like oh no you can keep that right I just want the atmosphere oh no no no you can keep that I just want the home right oh no no no you can have all that I just want your mind when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none the unclean Spirit does then he saith I'll return into my house it's asserting ownership Authority from when I came out and when he is coming and I like the wording here because in Luke it says I will return unto but now it says I'm going to return into so the difference here is uh when he is a man an unclean spirit is dispossessed of an individual I know this is really strong language in terms of demon possession and those things but there's a lot of ways that we could um bring that out in the scripture and the message of the hour to make it real personal for us and applicable on a daily basis but when and especially in light of a new birth experience when the unclean spirit is dis um dispossessed and he leaves and Lucas says I'll come unto my house and in a way we kind of get the idea that he comes back and he he kind of knocks on the door and he's just kind of checking in the windows but he says I'll come back into my house there's this this this idea that I have a right to this I want to come back into it and when I come out and when he's come huge phrase here this is why I'm point it from Matthew 12 he findeth it empty yet swept and gone garnished okay I want to come back to that phrasing empty swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last day of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be unto this wicked generation there's a lot of great principles that we could draw from this on a number of different levels but we understand this especially from the word of God in the message of the hour we understand how this is applicable to our individual spiritual Liv even with respect to religious spirits and certain things where you get cleaned up but you don't get the birth and you don't get filled but this is very very striking and hold to this look at that verse 44 as I look at this he comes back he enters in he finds it empty swept and garnished and he know there's something about the condition of the house where he feels perfect Liberty to go get some roommates and to come back it's almost as if now he has more room than before and he comes back because although the house was cleaned out it was never made a home the house was swept and garnished which means adorned or trimmed it was embellished to garnish it means to decorate beautifully to beautify so when it says listen this is what's striking it says it was empty and I think for us we think in terms of well the house is empty and he looked in he like nobody lives here there's no way anybody lives here I represented a client one time in Dallas and uh they were the landlords and owned a property and um and there was uh they they the people had just abandoned the house and for insurance purposes he had to re-enter the house just for because he couldn't get a hold of them it had been 30 days and so when he re-enters they file a big lawsuit it's going to be a big fuss and we went to mediation and they paid my client even though they sued him they paid us to go away at the end of the day but the whole one of the whole things with his issue was when he went and he was looking in the house he realized that though there were things in the house it wasn't lived in so when we and because there's something about a place that's lived in that's alive right so when we say it's empty I think maybe in our minds we think that someone's peering in and it's Barren but it was clean and beautified but beautified in a shallow way to where even when you were still in it even though it might have had couches and chairs and what was that what was the Home Interiors right had plenty of home interior parties and the sconces and the greenery fake and everything and the everything perfect but yet it was empty the Spirit came back in it swept and beautified but it's not a home it's not lived in the way that it should be and in that very moment when he found it empty it was a house that had not been made a home because it was filled but empty it was garnished accessorized but it felt empty and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches because it wasn't filled by knowledge there wasn't a pleasantness there wasn't a happiness wasn't a there wasn't a feeling brother bam said the eve sold out to reasonings of wisdom and education he said knowledge is what the devil sold Eve so it was garnished it was beautified but it wasn't the kind that FS brother talks about how civilization is of the devil that's what Cain be to do in his building when he built a city a w a waking place there was a book that was published 13 years ago about western civilization and how that Western Civilization succeeded in some key areas that Eastern civilization didn't even have Concepts they didn't even have and how that now Eastern civilizations are beating the Western civilizations at their own game and listen to those Concepts they're so remarkable the concepts of competition science rule of law modern medicine consumerism and work ethic six things that made Western Civilization different than Eastern civilizations and these are the very things at the heart of the uh the uh transactions that we engage in today competition science rule of law modern message medicine is there any coincidence that the rule of law and moders Medicine are there together in that consumerism work ethic these are the things that this devil is using in the transactions that we're engaging in I ask you with great soberness and if the length of this sermon kind of has inv evaded caused your attention span to to lessen to weaken and it the breath of this and maybe there's a lot here that we've been traveling down if it has doed you at all to this moment I plead with you to wake yourself up and to listen to this scripture in Mark chapter 8 these two scriptures Mark chapter 8: 36 to 37 I ask you how much are you willing to sell for is it for sale do you realize you don't even have to put it up for sale for there to be an offer made you don't have to get an actual MLS listing you don't have to go through certain channels but there's certain ways there are certain ways that the devil is making an offer I sister Elizabeth I have one some friends that everything in their house is for sale for the right price and I think at one time everything was for sale literally online like hey if they want our bed they want want to buy it for that price they can take it and in some ways our house our home is listed some ways it's for sale there's offers being made and I want to say this Satan will let you keep the house but he wants the home in Mark chapter 8: 36-37 for what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul what would it profit if you could have all the material wealth and all the material possessions and you could have everything the world has to offer but yet your soul you lose your soul or what shall a man give in the continuation of this what shall a man give in exchange for his soul the question that's posed is what value is there in the exchange what are you getting out of the transaction if you gain the whole world but your soul is lost and I ask it this way what value is it in the decisions we make where we gain of the world and worldly things if in the final analysis we lose home if we lose presence with our children we lose closeness with our wives there's there's a way that are we're transacting and doing business to where we're not supporting the ideals of home and the preeminence of the word and Christ isn't welcome and we're not doing what the word says but we're doing exactly what God said don't do in that transaction no matter how much you could show on the one C colum of the balance sheet how much have you lost in the other what value is there in the exchange if you gain the whole world but lose your home because he says what shall a man give in exchange for his soul if you lost your soul he's saying in other words if you lost your soul the whole world Listen the whole world is not valuable enough to buy it back think about that if you gain the whole world in exchange for your soul you cannot reverse that transaction if it was possible for me now to sell my soul in exchange for the entire world a and and in the transaction like oh you got five days it's the AutoNation guarantee right yep five days don't drive 250 miles five days you can bring it back it's as if it never happened you just give us the car back and we'll well I guess you didn't really give up anything in that case never mind let's go back to that tribe in Eastern Europe but in this transaction where you take you give your soul and you get the whole world in exchange and the whoever it is that's making the offer says if you if you want your soul back in five days just come back and just give me what I gave you the reality is what you've traded what you've received in the trade doesn't have the value and the Worth to get your soul back you can't buy buy it back even if you offered the whole world it's saying the devil's going to would say well I don't have your soul you just gave it up man and what are you going to pay what can you pay to get your soul back there's nothing in this world that's worth losing your soul over because there's nothing you can gain in this world that you could offer back to God where he would give it back I hope that helps you with this un an understanding of just how important spiritual things are and your salvation is in other words your soul was so valuable nothing in this world could pay the price there was only one price that could be paid and it's been paid by God's grace am Satan gets us bargaining all day long well Lord I'll do this and Lord I'll do that it's as if you're transacting for home which say it's the price I paid it's it's something I give wisdom knowledge and understanding that's what's going to give it I've already given it all for you I've already provide I've already paid for it these are things you don't have to transact with me Lord I'm going to do my best by God's grace I'm going to live clean for 30 days and if I could just live clean for 30 days Lord and and somehow some way do the right thing then Lord would you bless me and would you give me happiness and give me joy and give me peace he's saying that's a wrong wrong you're just bargaining with me like the devil bargained with you to give it up if you lost your soul and had the whole world you still couldn't afford your soul what price continue on this Lord will in the next few few services on on this analogy what price would you sell your home for brother bam is telling us what has been tells us what will be we could even say what is and he said if one reason against the word caused the chaos one reasoning cause man to Forfeit home then I believe it's faith that brings it back accepting the word of God and if I could just close with two other statements I'd like to read to you some quotations here from the message of the hour going back to Revelations chapter 5 part two that sermon brother Brandon was preaching that we've already read from Satan is a squatter he's a squatter brother BR says in the Old Testament if a man lost his inheritance and a squatter come on his land he could not hold it any longer for annihilation from the owner until 50 years in other words there's law there are certain laws that he's making reference to that if a man lost his inheritance and a man possessed it he can only possess it for so long because legal title was an absolute and any conveyance was by law only for a period of time and then once a certain juncture came it would revert back to the original owner in a way it mirrors God's the reality of how that God had planned it after 50 years the Year of Jubilee come by and the Year of Jubilee when the year of juilee come along then everything went back to its original beginning again I like that original beginning again remember going back home to Eden all slaves and went back to the original beginning if a man was Hing in the field and the trumpet sounded he heard it he'd throw down the hole and say I'm no more a slave I go back home to my family everything was given back if a squatter was on the ground he'd have to get off the ground that's all he got off the ground because the legal owner was coming back he had to give way he says hallelujah one of these days the kingdom of this world will fall and the legal owners will come in one of these days amen and there's this image in scripture how this Earth literally this earth is made for you and I to rain over whose names are on the title who God made it for the way that it originally was when God created the heavens and the Earth he was the owner of it as the one that created it but he created it for you and I amen he intended all along to hand it to his children to give it to this family and that's what God envisioned in the beginning there will be a day when we come back to full possession of everything that Adam lost there's coming a day when the kingdoms of this world will be the kingdoms of our God there'll be a day when we will rule and reign with him on the Earth all powers all principalities everything will be in that great not just a millennium but in the future home the entire Earth and all that is in it will be home to us again and I say this if that is true to that magnitude that it rings true today that when the bul has been given back to us in this hour he has made us owners he has given us a domain and he's wanting you to step up and say I am the owner amen and I'm coming home today the legal owner coming home I say purpose in your heart today I I say whether it be you brother Joel as being living on your own as a young man you brother Kenneth having a large family and everyone at home it doesn't matter if you're the smallest family in the church or the largest family in your church you purpose in your heart saying the legal owner is going home today and like well brother Aaron I'm just presently renting just kind of month-to month yeah you know what I'm talking about home talking about the atmosphere talking about applying the token uh there's things that we do in our homes to give God the premise to give God the glory to begin to think about the way of the tree of life and not the way of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil not the way of competition science rule of law modern medicine consumerism and work ethic but come back to the principles of the way of the tree of life amen amen good our musicians if you could come this statement I taken some of these things and I was going to use them for another service I just felt compelled to bring these in brother brand is praying so if we could just bow our heads and and I want you to focus on the words that I use think in your heart am I transacting with the devil to sell my home there's possessions that aren't lost there's things that I have I haven't lost so what have I lost Adam and the woman leaving Eden bloody bloody image as it's described would could have walked out and still saw trees and fruit and animals and same sun and if you would have just listed things you'd say well what have we lost and to put it just in the nomenclature that I've chose to use in this service this series we started this year is they lost home it's very possible that in every way of natural life in its most General basic sense they were living the same lives but feeling was lost hope and comfort and belonging and possession familiarity you ever been in a place that You' been before and it seemed [Music] strange you know this I'm trying to appeal maybe to children that that first time that you ever first time you went to your classroom this year at the beginning of the year when you went on that first day of school remember how strange the classroom seemed and how different how new everything was but after a while it's second nature it lost that feeling it's it's just it's so familiar to you don't think anymore well for Adam and the woman in some ways they're in the same classroom they're in the same place they're in the same workplace but now there's something missing they had sold their home but kept the house because there was something they couldn't keep in that transaction and it by God's grace it was something that Satan didn't own so he couldn't forever pervert it or destroy it and as I'm appealing to you as individuals and as families and certainly as a church There's issues of faithfulness issues of the atmosphere that we're Crea in our homes and at heart is the ways that we treat one another the things that we value having a vision and the burden that we have the burden that we have for one another brother banam says this as he's praying he says may not one who sit here tonight and heard the message may not one of them be lost because what we're talking about is home lost or homeless Eden lost from the least child to the oldest person may their holy desire be only for God in his word we know not what our hour may appear or what hour he may summon us to answer up yonder at the Judgment we don't know what hour he may as it was take our card from the rack and say it's homecoming time you've got to go God help us to keep pure Grant it Lord may we live till the coming of the Lord if it be possible and this is where I want you to anchor on this may we do everything that is in our power with love and understanding understanding that God is searching the world today finding every lost sheep this is the prayer at the end of Satan's Eden this is now get yourself right into the heart of of everything I've preached this morning on Satan's a squatter he's a poacher we we've in a way been dispossessed but we're coming back to our inheritance he says may we have love and understanding and may we talk to them with seasoned prayer of love and the word of God that we might find that last one so we can go home and get out of this old Eden of Satan here Lord that is our vision to have a life seasoned with the prayer of love and the word of God that we might be available to find the lost who are The Lost they're the homeless they are the ones that have lost home they may seemingly have everything else in life like oh well they're rich what do they need for me oh they've got this what do they need for me oh they have that what do they need for me oh they do this they do that but no what they need is home Lord but we can't do it with worldly wisdom and worldly understanding and intellectualism and knowledge of this message and just a bunch of hogwash and politics and pretense we needs a seasoned prayer of love so that we know how to talk to them with humility with love and understanding that it might find the lost so we can go home and get out of this old Eden of Satan here I believe in a in in a in a by type and in a small way you can today find rest in Satan's Eden underneath a rock you could find a home right where we are now in the middle of Satan's Eden we could recognize he's a squatter and he squatted all around us he's a poacher he's a liar he's a deceiver he tried to buy the home and he he couldn't afford the world so he just tried to buy the atmosphere he tried to buy the sky he tried to buy the regions and buy the people buy off the Kings but I realize now his days are numbered full possession has come back to me and I will take my stand right now in whatever domain I can whether it be as an eighth grader at a school whether it be as a teenager in the home or a mother with her children a single mother mother or a single father or traditional families however you want to look at it I am going to come back home today not just to a house to home as the legal owner and God I want you to give me love power love and understanding in the right way of life in the way of the Tree of Life to rescue those who have been overwhelmed by the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so that we can all go home and then bring home back to Earth beautiful picture beautiful picture gracious Heavenly Father Lord I pray for these today that sit here having heard this word that they would Lord seek your face don't do what you said not to do but do what you said do and father my prayer my Earnest prayer is that their eyes would be open this was a foundational sermon Lord to begin to explore very practical everyday mechanisms and principles maybe not in granular Lord but maybe from a higher view Lord I want to explore the mechanisms of greed and the influences of media a lot of very specific things though they may not get a whole sermon or even multiple sermons or just there's things that we could practically consider that are part of Satan's transaction to get us to sell our homes and Lord by way of just I I just I pray Just Have Your Way in the people's hearts Lord today I would father that it would be encouraging even to those of us who feel especially rebuked maybe even targeted if that would be a word Lord there may even be some that think that I impr preaching this with personal knowledge directly to them what a challenge Lord in this very moment for anyone who would think that so Lord I pray if that would even be true May their response please you may even in that Dynamic the way of the tree of life would be what would come up with inside of them and be what would respond Lord we realize in our daily lives we're challenged with so many things and what's remarkable is our children so easily see past the Optics of playing [Music] Church our children see so easily past the Optics of quote unquote honoring the message and so they're the ones that suffer the most when we merely play lip service through shallow actions and don't truly demonstrate in our hearts that we love the word and that we're faithful to the house of the Lord Lord I say do as you would see fit with love and a great passion for your word and with a deep love and empathy for these people father I pray that you would do as you see fit have your way Lord have your way but father forgive us for our sins forgive us for our trespasses Lord give us yet another opportunity to do what we can father have mercy on those that are Wayward have mercy on those who and stubborn and obstinate Lord have mercy for those who are in the path of the tree of knowledge getting further away from the the way of the tree of life oh God have mercy on them let them not suffer loss of house as well as home be merciful to them that they not squander their inheritance fully and completely but may they come back to [Music] you we love you father father bless your people I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord I may be working myself back up to two hour sermons
