TRANSCRIPT
========================================
no longer a slave to fear oh i am a child of god [Music] man let's just stand to our feet this morning brother branham in one place he called it the sin the sin of fear he said it'd be a sin to disbelieve so we want to just push away any sin of fear any seer of un sin of unbelief this morning and just let the lord have his way if we could just bow our heads in a word of prayer we'll just commit the reading of the scripture to the lord and we welcome everyone that's come we're so glad to see you here we're glad that the presence of the lord is with us today a gracious heavenly father lord we're happy to be gathered together in your presence lord we sense your nearness to us and lord despite perhaps the uniqueness of the facilities lord and the uniqueness of the gathering there's that familiar presence lord that draws us there's a a confidence that we have on the holy spirit lord there's a looking two to you to fulfill your promises that makes gatherings like this worth every effort lord is where we know that the supernatural is just present and ready to do things for us that we ourselves cannot do so now lord we look to you to do the things that we are incapable of lord we look to you to do the things that we would not even pretend uh to be able to do and that's to take the bread of life and break it to us lord to take words father and quicken them to us by revelation and lord will there be a hurting soul here today i pray that you would minister to it there be a sick body may they take you at your word lord believe that these signs shall follow them that believe and that they can be made well and they could be healed father if there be a need of salvation we're looking to you to be the one that works within the unbeliever's heart the sinner's heart to bring them to a place of repentance and yielding to you lord in obedience father be baptized in the name of jesus christ and to be sealed into the kingdom of god for lord we realize that regardless of how much revelation we may have regardless of how much revelation we may preach we're looking for a soul to be saved lord to be added to the body that it might complete your purpose and this earth would be filled up and replenished and every seed at your table would be taken so father we commit ourselves to you today desire that you take the bread of life break it to us bless the words which we read father the scriptures that are read and may bless the many that have gathered here today as we all in one accord lord open up our hearts to you in the name of lord jesus christ we pray amen now while you're standing i'd like to read in three different places that should be fairly easy genesis chapter 1 then john chapter one and then revelations chapter three genesis chapter one that's the easy one and then john chapter one that would maybe be the harder of the three and then revelations chapter three so at the beginning of the book the middle of the book and the end of the book and just read in a few places just for our text genesis chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth in john chapter 1 verse 1 and all these are so familiar we could probably just quote them without having to flip to them but we'll read it to read it from the bible to be sure that we don't miss anything but john chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and then i'd like to read verse 14 as well and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth the brother shared with me one time how that he always grew up in the message hearing brother branham quote john chapter 1 and he went hunting with some buddies and maybe another minister was with the minister and he's just a young man at the time and he grabbed the gideon bible from the hotel end table there and he began to read and he read in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and he said the same was in the beginning with god he said hey there's a misprint in this bible and they said what's the misprint it says it doesn't say and the word was made flesh because brother bannon would take verse 1 and skip to verse 14 so often when he quoted it so we could see that expression of god the word was with god in the beginning and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and then revelations chapter 3 verse 14. this is at the beginning of the address to the laodicean church revelations chapter 3 verse 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodicean's write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god the beginning of the creation of god you may be seated i'd like to continue on the subject of in the beginning and then at the uh in the beginning of this this part to maybe back up and go over just a few things uh just to kind of lay them as a foundation for what's in my heart today to minister on but as we looked in genesis chapter one it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth i'd actually been pondering uh the who what when where why how i guess is the busytown theme song the who what when where why how of genesis chapter one and you see god creating you see how in creating the heavens and the earth and really it's wonderful for us as believers to know the why to see what god's doing and understand the why to it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and we looked at how this the language used of god even when it comes to genesis chapter 2 being called the lord god it speaks of the covenant god the strong one who's bound by an oath and it's the god have jehovah the god who becomes or who expresses himself so it's the unveiling of god it's the becoming god that's expressed in genesis chapter 1 in the beginning god creates and he's expressing himself and he's making himself known and as we ponder this verse genesis chapter 1 and we look at it god is declaring something glorious in this verse and if we just think about how god is writing the bible and he's going to inspire moses to pen these words and in the very first words of the bible which has been preserved even to this time and this day it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth we should really ponder just how important this verse was to god he's going to start expressing something and he's wanting the believer to catch a hold of this as we've read already in romans these things were written for our learning that through the patience of the scripture we might have hope so he wrote this so we could learn he wrote this so that we could have understanding it just didn't say well i got to begin somewhere and so it was a dark and stormy night no he just he started with a phrase that would get our attention that we could d dive into and catch his mind and catch his heart so this is a very significant verse he says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and brother bretta makes this statement and falling apart of the world he says but the one who created the heaven and the earth expresses himself back through his creation what he is in his program and we see a number of places where brother graham says the creator expresses himself in his creation so we could create something as human beings and in creating it it may not be an expression of who we are in our opinions or our thoughts or our desires it might not even express what we like in what we're creating because we could be a work for hire and someone said well i want you to paint this wall or i want you to design a website and it may be nothing like we want nothing like we would desire it to be but yet it's a work of of our own doing of our own efforts and our own labors and it could be our creation but it doesn't reflect who we are but when god created brother graham saying that he the very one who created the heaven and the earth is expressing himself in that creation in the creation and the coming forth of the heaven and the coming forth of the earth god is expressing himself and and we may not have ever thought of it that way or we may not take time to think about it we just kind of gloss over these words in the beginning and we know it so well it's kind of lost its distinction or meaning but god is expressed in the representation of heaven and earth he's portraying something about himself he says it what he is in his program so what is created reflects what is in god's mind and as brother brahm uses that word express express express it's something that's being squeezed out of god something that's coming out of god's mind and it's being portrayed and so the very first expression of god that we read in the scripture is the heaven and the earth and we looked at it and we can see from the teaching of the word of god that the heaven represents the supernatural the earth would represent the natural and that the heaven represents the groom and the earth represents the bride so god has already told his story he's already shown his hand and it is wrapped up in a mystery but he's already told us where he's going with this i am going to be expressed in groom and i'm going to be expressed in bride so the very first two things that are expressed in scripture is a heavenly bridegroom and an earthly bride represented by heaven and earth and so the covenant god has expressed his ambition and his desire in genesis chapter one and we we saw in the scripture how that there was a union of the heavenly and the earthly in jesus christ and brother bam talked about how that's when heaven and earth embraced and they kissed together and then brother branham preaches the invisible union of the bride of christ and so now he's saying that there's a union that's taking place today he says all that spiritual union of christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh he says manifested vindicated so there was we see the word made flesh but now he uses it in this way the flesh is becoming word that's our privilege today we didn't bypass a natural act to be born we we came by sinful birth we came to natural parents and and so we are having an experience not of being word first and becoming flesh but being flesh but becoming word by the same power that's our promise today that's what we've been called to manifest today to be manifested and vindicated flesh is becoming word word is becoming flesh in that spiritual union of a heavenly bridegroom and an earthly bride and my burden as i pondered this and i asked myself many times when something's stirring in my heart and i'm thinking about something and i'm pondering just the direction the lord may be leading me in i try to get down to really what's the burden of it what's the thrust because we we wouldn't want to just ever just throw data at you and just leave it up to you to analyze it and figure it out and we just wouldn't want to overload you with facts and things that brother bannon said and there's times maybe you hear something is expressed or something in setting like well that's just a lot of facts right that's the facts but what does it mean for me what what am i supposed to get out of this and as i pondered it and just how the emphasis of the holy spirit i could see as he's driving me the the real thrust and burden is to see yourself in the beginning that if there could be a confidence that you can see yourself in the beginning and you can see that god had you in his mind when the very first thing begin to be set into motion then then you can rest in the end if you can see yourself in the beginning don't fret turn into the book of revelation trying to figure out where you are in the end you can just wrestle and if i was there in the beginning i'm going to be there in the end if he had me in his mind when he began to create then i'm not worried about all the chaos and confusion that exist right now i'm not worried about what's up and what's down what's in and out i'm not worried about my own failures and my own weaknesses i realize that if in the beginning i was represented there then i can have confidence he's going to preserve me in the end and we looked at how that that theme is just unfolds through genesis chapter one where we see the earth but then it's in void it's chaos it's confusion but all you need is the spirit of god to move move upon the face of the deep and bring order and how even oh well heaven and earth will pass away but no no it's not that it's going to be annihilated it's going to be renovated and preserved because it's a spoken word original attribute of god so we don't have to fear if you're a son or daughter of god you do not live under the fear of god saying all right enough's enough i'm finished with you and there's there's no there's no way that this gospel can be preached in its purity and dangle a seed of god over hell i you could do it to a make-believer or an unbeliever but that's not our audience that's not who you minister to you know you don't get together so you could dangle the unbeliever over hell you preach the word of god to encourage the believer because sometimes the believer thinks he's an unbeliever sometimes the believer thinks he's a make-believer so you preach to the believer and if you make the believer your audience the believer is like oh i realize now that is what i am i am a believer not a make-believer i am a believer and so that's the real that's the real burden i feel in the word and looking at this in the beginning it's not just to throw out facts or data but for you to see yourself in the beginning and brother branham says this in satan's eating he says when he made one of his attributes from his own body he says god has attributes in his body like you are an attribute of your father so he begins to look at through several statements how that you were an attribute in your father your father couldn't communicate with you he didn't know you i really couldn't even mentally conceive who you were and what you would be until through the process of a natural birth you're born then you become expressed then your father can have fellowship with you and and for i i've mentioned this before i remember whenever my friends would have children before i had my own children they'd have a baby and i said congratulations isn't this wonderful it's the greatest thing and then i finally had a child and i realized i had no idea what i was talking about it was the most empty congratulations ever because you cannot even fathom what that feels like or what that experience is until you have a child and so brother bam is looking at that natural dynamic so a lot of us can fellowship in that and understand what it is he's pointing at and identifying but he's saying now just as you were an attribute of your natural father he's saying you are an attribute of your heavenly father so whatever connection we might have with an earthly parent and realize well i came from them i'm a combination of their dna i am i am a magiri i'm a i'm david and leslie mcgeary joined together united together indivisibly my dna is intertwined with theirs and you can understand that natural relationship then think about what you are to god that god does not have just quote unquote offspring in the earth he has his own progeny he has his own children flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone so he says now that's the way god was in the beginning now he goes back to the beginning he says every son of god and every daughter of god was in god at the beginning so it says in the beginning god created then you were there with him in the beginning you were in him he says you don't remember it now but you were there he knowed it and he wanted you to become so he could contact you speak with you and love you and shake your hands now we're not looking at this as like a an unfolding as the dominoes fell or as just as neurons fired and dna mutated and different strands mutated and through billions of years we've ended up here where now we are what we are go back to the very moment where it says in the beginning god created what he wanted was for you to become he wanted you to become so he could contact you speak with you love you shake your hands so that's in him and his his desire as he begins to create the heaven and earth he has you in mind as the end goal and he knows everything that's going to happen he wasn't pondering oh just think about it in just a few more minutes there there's my family going to be in eden and i'm going to be able to shake all their hands and fellowship with them and contact them he knew the plan of redemption he knew each stage what would unfold and what would happen but he had the goal in mind the very end and mind he wanted you to become so he could contact you speak with you love you and shake your hands and then if you could just ponder this as a brief statement in the message knoweth it not he says in the beginning of the creation of god when he begin to create and bring you into existence so in the beginning of creation in the beginning of the creation of god when he begin to create so you have the beginning of the creation of god and when he begin to create and bring you into existence so that's the part i'm really wanting you to connect with that when god said in the beginning the bible says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth his goal is to bring you into existence not to have a sandbox that he can play in not just to put all the pieces out there and for us to put together the puzzle but he knows the end from the beginning he knows what he's trying to accomplish he knows the direction he's wanting to go he says when god begin to create and bring you into existence that's what it means in the beginning god created it means to cause existence and so you are represented in this creation there's something that you as an individual can draw from these scriptures and say oh yeah it's the creation of the world it's the creation of the garden of eden and we can look at it that way have confidence in it believe it use it to establish our faith that by faith we believe that by the word of god the worlds were framed and we can hold to our conviction that it was god who created the heaven and earth it's not evolution it's not some kind of scientific process and we can use that but there's more to it than just believing god created what we see with our senses but also that in a spiritual supernatural sense i am represented there in this creation so if you want to look in genesis chapter 2 i want to read verses 4 to 7 because it uses a phrase that's very interesting as we're looking at in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth now it's it's represented this way where it says in genesis chapter 2 verse verse 4 and we'll read to verse 7 and maybe in just uh skip around a little bit in the book of genesis to look at a couple things but it says these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens so he's referr he refers to himself god inspiring moses to write he's called in the beginning beginning god which is elohim and now that there's creation he is jehovah elohim so now he has a specific relationship to his creation so he's no longer just elohim the the a strong one elohim where he's bound by an oath or he's he's there self-existing all by himself now he's jehovah god he's jehovah elohim now he has a covenant he's a covenant god with his creation and he's wanting to express himself and says these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth and the generations it means the begetting or the results the the product of the proceedings of the heavens the earth it comes from the root to bear to beget or to bring forth so it's an interesting phrase these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth these are the things that were beget these were the things that were produced these were the things that were brought forth and in genesis chapter 5 verses 1 to 3 and i want to use this so that you could kind of understand the phrasing of these are the generations of the heavens and earth you find in scripture it says these are the generations of something this is what proceeded forth from so he says this is the book genesis 5 1 to verse 3. this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him so he's telling us the generations of adam and that was proceeded forth and come forth from adam and then it recaptures who adam is he's made in the likeness of god and then it says male and female created he them so it's already telling us that there's something in the image of a man being both male and female that is also in the likeness of god that the image of god the expression of god is going to be male and female now if you looked at him then if you could see him you wouldn't have seen it but we know that he's going to become it because in the end he expresses himself not only in bridegroom but he expresses himself in his bride so the likeness of god is male and female so he says male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam that's why we don't have a different name he says in the day when they were created and adam lived 130 years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name seth so if we continue to read we'll see that it's the account of persons that are born or who descended from adam by generation until noah so these are the generations of adam it's those who came from him up until the point where it comes to noah and it's just kind of walking us through his genealogy and his lineage so the generations of adam are those that came from him and then the bible says if you want to look back at genesis chapter 2 verses verse 4 again these are the generations of the heaven and the earth so he's wanting us to think about how what came forth from the heavens what came forth from the earth and they were when the day that when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens verse 5 and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew so this i this is a the way that it's phrased is it so i find it interesting myself to you it may make perfect sense but i i kind of wrestled with it and looked at it and tried to understand it and i found that the way brother branham teaches the creation is when i find when it finally clicked for me is that it was all by seed that it came forth by seed and so there's one translation that says no shrub of the field was yet in the earth no herb of the field had yet sprung up so it's saying that they hadn't been expressed but yet they were already in there the plant and the herb were already in the earth in seed form by the spoken word of god but as of yet they hadn't had expression yet so it says these are the generations of the heaven and earth every plant of the field before it was in the earth every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground we know that the rain did not come until the days of noah then it says and the lord god formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul so these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth every plant every herb and then it says that god for men from the dust of the earth so he brings man he forms he doesn't create but he forms as like a potter with clay he brings man forth from the same earth the same earth that has the seed of the herb the same earth that has the seed of the plant and there's some in jewish tradition in jewish theology they look at that duality of the planned herb of representing of even of the duality of the messiah you have the plant and the herb so here you have two seeds expressed in the earth and it says he's gonna bring forth man from the earth so it's not just plant it's not just herb but also man comes from the earth and all the elements for man's body were in the earth so the generations of the heaven and earth there's plants that come forth there's herb that comes forth and even man himself is going to come forth from the earth and brother battle makes this statement in future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride that's his title i didn't amend it but he called it the future home which is going to be a new heavens and new earth and he calls it of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride and the very first image we have in scripture is heaven and earth it's always it's been it's been foreshadowing been representing your place and your position with christ and who he is so he says the earth holds those things he's talking about all the perversion the sickness the sin the all the all the nasty things that are in the world today the earth holds those things but it wasn't made for that purpose sin caused it to be like that it was made by god the creator and he and if he's creating something he's expressing himself in it and i'm going to read several statements that track this thought just for emphasis you realize wow brother branham said it that many times there's something to what he's saying and he says all of our bodies that we live in now was put on the earth when god created it because you were out of the dust of the earth it was all laid out here so he says god the creator the earth was made the earth holds things that are wicked now can we all say amen to that the earth holds things that are wicked now if anybody thinks laodicea is over just open your eyes you know just look around laodicea's healthy but if anybody doesn't believe in the bright age just look around the bride is healthy she's here and so we see laodicea holds all these wicked things he says but that's not why the earth was made the earth wasn't made to be a cesspool the earth wasn't made to hold all the things that are in it that are in it now so he brings it back to its original purpose he says god the creator and the very first thing he hits on he's looking at the world and how perverted it was and he begins to bring in our mind that it was made by god and i i believe that he's emphasizing that it would the purpose of it it wasn't the purpose of the earth wasn't to hold sin god made it for purpose and the very first thing he identifies as all of our bodies that we live in now were put on earth when god created it because you were the dust of the earth he says it was all laid out here when god himself created it you were in his thinking and in him the great eternal was the thought which is his attribute and now sin caused all of this to happen so everything we see in the world now god says brother man saying sin caused all this to happen he says and god through this age is gathering up his material so you could somehow think of it in this way that when god made the earth when he made the heaven and the earth you were in his thinking so he's projecting something into creation but now brother branham says he's laid you in there somehow i'm not going to pretend to diagram to you and say oh brother aaron has a projector maybe he'll give us a slide on how this worked i'm not going to try to tell you how it worked i'm just going to tell you what he said i'm just going to tell you what brother branham said and then just let the holy spirit quicken to you maybe just all those logistics but it's something only god could do only god could sow things into earth and in the dust and then thousands of years later perhaps billions of years later gather up his material in this last day where when was it first laid out it was laid out when he created it but now in this age he's gathering up his material what's going to be that final gathering that meeting in the air the change of our bodies a theophany and a glorified body coming together earthly and heavenly everything quickened together and god is gathering up his material that he had already laid out and so we we must see the divine purpose that we must see god's create god's predestinated program and be absolutely convinced of it i it it's it's it's it's hard and maybe maybe i could express it this way sometimes we waver in in the natural life in the present tense and things happen and things don't go the way that we wanted them to and we we we suffer loss and we endure great pain and rejection and and through it we sometimes we we try to filter that and we try to resolve it why is this happening try to figure it out and sometimes we just think oh well maybe i deserve this and maybe i'm reaping what i sow and god's after me and then we get in this state of well maybe i've just been make-believing all the time this time and maybe i'm just pretending lord am i in the right place lord am i even seed am i even elect i see things falling apart and this person fall away in my next and you get in this state of uneasiness all because you're dwelling in the present tense and then i guess present could be bad enough then we just add in all the decades of the same kind of thinking and it just has a way of compounding but if i could try to express it this way not so much try to convince you that everything's okay now but convince you that you're absolutely tied to the eternal all the way back then so that whatever may be now whatever's unsettling now whatever shaking out you could just somehow transcend the present tense and stick your finger in eternity and say no i'm tied to something greater than all this well you had decades of this and ins and outs and ups and downs decades and decades and decades say well none of that matters i'm going to transcend all that but where and where i'm at today i'm connected with something divine i'm connected with something eternal so we must see the divine purpose because god was intentional in his creation he was he was more it was more than just a god throwing things out there and i i see it uh i've seen i don't mean to stumble anybody but i've seen a youtube video and uh i saw and you see some of these youtube videos where people are creating stuff and they're just putting a cake pan on a string poking a hole in it and just throwing it out there and it does a little pattern it does a bunch of stuff and everybody's like that's amazing how did you do that well i tied a paint can to a string and i poked a hole in it and i just started spinning it around the room and it created this pattern and they'll just take it however it comes and i'm sure there's some artists out there good enough to understand the science behind swinging a paint can on a string and they know exactly what they're trying to produce but this god isn't just throwing things out there and seeing what sticks he didn't have all these names in a hat and throw them out there and say whichever ones turn up those are the ones i'm going to redeem god was very intentional in his creation and put and make this uh part of your understanding of god he's a god of purpose he's a god who's intent he's a god who has an ambition and he has a desire and he's focused he's a god of focus who never varies from that there's many things that god will allow to happen but god will never allow anything to happen that would upset his program that would upset his goal that it would change his goal and he'd have to recalibrate say oh you know what i wanted to have a bride of my own choosing but i think i'm just going to have to have something else or do something else know god is very purposeful very intentional with his creation and sin did not upset his ambition if we understand through the word of god that it actually furthered his ambition because now god can express himself had god created a perfect eden and all of us came forth in a perfect eden there would be attributes of the divine that we would never experience we would never know that god was a healer and could you imagine let's just say we've all been in the garden of eden for billions of years and one day god comes his voice comes walking in the garden and he wants to say to you brother frankie i'm a healer and you'd be like he'll heal or what's a healer what does that even mean well there's this concept or idea idea of being sick sick what is sick mean he wouldn't even be able to express he wouldn't be able to tell you what these attributes so what he had to do brother brandon even said it was necessary for god to pre-decimate a man who needed saving in order for god to have reason to be so in order for god god exists by himself he's a self-existent one he was before us he was before everything so he existed but now he wants a reason to exist and in order to give himself a reason to exist he needed to predestinate you as a sinner so don't let the devil beat you up if you were a sinner anybody here not being beat up because they weren't a sinner all of us were sinners and so we can't we don't let the devil beat us up say listen the fact that i had failed him the fact that i was born in sin the fact that sin laid in me from the beginning gave god reason to exist so i'm not gonna let anything in my life be used as a tool to separate me from god all things are working together because i want to look through it through the prism of the word of god i'm going to look it through god's eyes and how god has ordained us and i'm going to be confident that the fact that god allowed me to come through that channel gave him a reason to exist didn't cause him to exist because he's god but it gave him reason and purpose of being given reason to exist by predestining a man who needed salvation so sin doesn't upset his ambition sin didn't upset his goal it actually furthered it to where he would be able to express himself so now i'm going to read a number of statements to you in this this vein or channel of brother bannon saying that all of our bodies were laid out in the earth and if at any point you get it and you want me to move on just say amen if i don't move on you just amen louder and and soon there'll just be a roar of a man's and everybody think wow that must have been a pretty exciting quote i wasn't really picking up what he was laying down there but i'm going to read them i'm going to go through them because i think it's important to establish them and he says this and what does it take to make a christian life i love to ponder that he's going to make a christian life what does it take it takes the right kind of material he said let's take before there were there in the beginning of the world he says now the lily come from the earth we can all agree on that and he says so did you if that be so then we were here our bodies were on the earth before there was any life here and he says it this way same message our bodies were laying spread out on this earth before there was any type of life on the earth potash calcium petroleum cosmic light was here at the creation as the volcanic was thrown out they tell us that bursted and formed the materials of the earth and so forth it was just a burning brimstone as it was satan's possession as he walked up and down the fiery brimstone of the earth and then when god cooled it off and said it over there in his great mind now even in that language brother bram describes the earth as satan walking upon the face of the earth in time when it was just belching and it was this fluid mass of confusion no discernible land just maybe lava and satan's walking on it and satan's thinking i got this this is mine but god has a different program so even if you think he got to you first and walked all over your life don't worry god's got you god's got a different program just let the spirit of god move upon your heart move upon your life and kick satan right off that possession right off of that land and bring order into your soul bring order into your life so he says when god cooled it off and said it over there in his great mind he had something in his mind that he was going to do again god is doing this with purpose with intent he had something in his mind that he's going to do and he's saying all your bodies were laid out out here in the earth then the message mark of the beast and the seal of god god's a great contractor a great contractor always lays out all his stuff when he builds his subdivision god when he was moving the earth around creating calcium potash and petroleum and so forth he was laying our bodies on the earth right then the material that we're made out of and the great holy spirit went out from god to brood over the earth or coo make love like a hen her brood he began to brood over the earth really just enter into this language that brother bam is using there's a place i may read here in a little bit where brethren gets emotional thinking about this process to where this is god not it's just not a mass of chemicals there's it represents something precious to him something special and he said he as a hen would brood over uh her brood and and coo to it god making love to the earth and brooding over and i can see some calcium coming running down a little place mixing up with some moisture and potash and a little easter flower come out and i can hear him say come here father look at this very good keep on brooding after a while brewed a little more and what comes next was probably the flowers and the vegetations and the birds flew out of the dust of the earth and then come the animal life and kept getting higher life higher life higher life higher life until finally a man come up in the very image of god it's it's all in the earth this isn't a magician's trick where god just has a hat over there and brings a lily out of a hat but he's bringing it out of the earth he's bringing it forth from substance that laid in there and then so brother branham says it again this way in super sign god the great contractor had all the bodies laid out here on the earth of calcium potash petroleum he was going to create it and make it but she bypassed the way of god the woman did he says what did adam do when he come to his wife when he come to her he found her pregnant of an evil her own conception had received foul seed now it's kind of a very stark way for brother brahm to inject this into this thought you have god the great contractor that creates the earth and then everything's laying in there in this beautiful seed form adam and the woman under a commandment he says but before adam could come to her she was already fallen and so the first woman had fallen then he says jehovah before he could marry his wife did the same thing so now he's actually talking about the church so you see a fall in genesis now you see a fall in the in the new testament he says and she organized herself and become the roman catholic church jesus before he could get to his bride she'd organized herself and become the roman catholic church same thing but he will have a bride don't you worry that will be bought with his word just exactly what he told eve to stay with he will have a church amen that will be bought by his word he will have it regardless of what has transpired what has fallen what has been up and down he will have a bride that's been bought by his word because god as a great contractor had already laid out the materials for it and there's nothing that can intervene and disrupt his plan to achieve a bride to himself in the message faith of abraham my body was laying on the earth before there was anything at all ever on the earth when the holy spirit went forth before god to brood over the earth like that a brood means to coo like a dove or a hen mother when there was nothing but volcanic eruptions when god moved his old star around the sun making potash and calcium he was like a great contractor laying out the lumber to build houses where we were here then our bodies was on the earth right then it's god is creed in the earth god has in his mind this is very supernatural it it to me it's beyond how i could grasp how he would do this but just accept that it's the divine and it reminds even tommy how you might have rotated around the sun as these things are spinning and these things are orbiting these things are coming together he's laying out our bodies in the earth he says like a great contractor laying out lumber to build houses he's still using his materials today that's the way we should look at our our babies when they're born thank you god you're still using you're still using your material and then we we use the phrase often maybe it's associated with with death but from dust thou come from dust out shout return and it's drawn from the scriptures in ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 7 then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it we're looking at the individual the spirit will return unto god the body that the dust of the earth the flesh will return to the earth and why it's saying the flesh the body came from the dust of the earth psalms 104 29 thou hidest thy face they are troubled thou takest away their breath they die in return to their dust the bible is very plain about this we come from the dust of the earth our our flesh it comes from the very makeup of the of the earth and brother branham says in the beginning if we come from the dust of the earth our bodies laid on this earth at the beginning i know i'm just emphasizing it over and over again and your amens haven't gotten louder so i'm just going to have to read all of them but he's emphasizing something they say look our bodies are all laid out here it's not just a casual thought where he says it one time and we're trying to make more out of it than than he meant to but he's trying to lay this thought out there all of our bodies laid here on earth he was laying out our bodies on earth right then and he's not saying in just some haphazard sense or well it's just it's all the same massive chemicals anyways he says like a great contractor who's laying out lumber for houses we were there then our audit bodies were on earth right then he says if we come from the dust of the earth which the bible says we did and also science says we come from the dust of the earth then surely our bodies was laying on this earth when this was yet a volcanic eruption without a speck of life this is from ye must be born again our bodies before there was even even the earth was finished being formed our bodies that we're living in right now was laying on the earth in the beginning god created the earth right then put a period on it start the clock flip the pages on the calendar let the years unfold tell me however you want in scientific terms how many billions of years old this earth is maybe if they knew the right test they'd be able to tell that our bodies are also billions of years old but it's saying it's it was already laid in there it was already in the earth from that very moment in thirsting of turning on the light he says this is a very rich statement here he says no life can come outside of light light produces light produces life there can be no life outside of light natural or spiritual there must be and only light can come by the word of god so you can you have to have light to have life and light can only come by the word those principles that he lays out in shalom turn on the light in those different places only light can come by the word of god god's word is the light when it's manifested so life comes by light light comes by the word and the word is light when it's manifested it's just a seedling here as god planted all the seeds we could recognize this with herb and plant but then he says our bodies was on the earth before there was any life here or anything the calcium potash petroleum cosmic like whatever cosmic light whatever it was it was here when god created the earth it only taken his spoken word to bring it into existence just like it did botany or tree life what or whatever life there is to be so it takes the spoken word to bring it into existence just like you did botany life a tree life whatever it might be it takes the spoken word of god which the word manifested as light and it takes light to bring life he's saying every seed was laying there it took light to bring it forth even describes it one place they're all laying there and there was just maybe the earth was shrouded the sun was always shining but it took the word of god to push back the clouds to allow the light to strike the seed and then it could burst forth and in that we see a type of ourselves wandering in sin one and in darkness but then the preach of the word drives back the clouds and allows the light of god's gospel to shine upon the seed and immediately we burst forth where was that seed all the time it was there all the time he says his spoken word brings it into existence god planted all the seeds and he says our bodies were on earth right then just like anything else and it's the spoken word that brings things into existence so now in the message impersonation of christianity he says they talking about bodies he says must have been here when the earth was made because they were taken from the earth they were here when the earth was made our bodies were here before the earth was made for we are of the earth all that we are made of is calcium potash petroleum cosmic light atoms holding us together and somehow by some mastermind we were made thus what we are attributing it to the divine to his divine purpose not just heaping together potash and calcium and petroleum but something got into the inside and begin to create and i was made thus he's attributing divine purpose divine intent not as science would want us to believe that this is just the result of of a misfire that took billions of years to unfold it says the reason why creation is so complex today is it evolved over so many billions of years where just this blob was sitting there and finally something mutated and i said just it was just randomness it's just probabilities give something a billion years and all of a sudden it's going to fire off a a foot or something and that's just the way that they look at it it's just really all here scientifically by uh by the lottery but he said no it's not just a blob together but there was a mastermind behind it something got inside and began to create and i was made thus and then he brings it back to the very beginning in the beginning the holy spirit began to brood over a bleak desert excuse my emotions this is where brother brown begins to get very emotional about this thought imagine a bleak desert and that might not be hard for some of us to do just imagine a bleak desert but now the holy spirit's gonna brood over it excuse my emotions but when there was nothing and have never been nothing but the holy spirit was sent from god not to intellectual but the holy spirit was sent from the presence of god to make love over the earth and as it was he stretched his big big wings around the earth and began to make love or to brood coo over the earth and i could see calcium and potter's coming together and begin to and and in a little easter lily stood up the holy spirit brewed it out of the earth and he kept brooding and as he cooed and brewed i began to see trees come up birds began to fly from the earth animals began to walk and then he kept cooing and man came up called adam isn't that beautiful now go ahead if you want to run ahead of me a good 30 minutes go ahead and just think about the implications for you today what god is doing by the preaching of the word what god is doing by bringing his presence near what does god do when the presence falls in a church service it's not to vindicate the piano piano player it doesn't vindicate the special that was sung it's not for the purpose that you could go back and watch it on youtube and say man that was dynamic it's god trying to draw something out of you it's god trying to cultivate something in your life it's god trying to make a difference in your home life make a difference in your thought process why it's god the holy spirit brooding it out of your own earth he kept brooding until a man came up he says and he immediately says and adam looked lonesome so he made a byproduct for him and took a rib from his side now how could god look at adam and since loneliness how could god look at a man by himself in a domain in a kingdom in earth the highest of all it evoluted up to that man was the highest upon earth how could god look at that which is good and say it's not good unless he knew in the reflection that there was more to be expressed and so he looks at him and he says he's lonesome so he made a byproduct of him and took a rib from his side and made him a sweetheart eve and he loved adam and he loved eve portraying now as this brooding continued holy spirit working over these materials and these elements of the earth he took woman from adam and adam was from the earth adam came from the earth and now adam being having his body made up from the elements of the earth now from that same body god takes and brings forth a woman she's not another creation she's from the same elements that adam was and what is he doing he's showing his great purpose god is portraying you in the very beginning you have the earth adam comes out of the earth and then out of adam comes his wife he's portraying his great purpose brother branham in the message paradox he says this he says what's the most important thing in the world anybody want to take a guess what's the most important thing in the world well so as to not embarrass anybody and we might we might start naming places we like to eat or the fact that football season finally started i don't know what what we might say but it says it's god's church god made the earth he made it for a purpose to take a church out of it a bride so the most important thing in the world is god's bride because god made the earth for the purpose of getting the bride out of it he says and that's the most important job in the world the most important job in the world is getting a bride out of the earth the most important job there is is to take out of the earth a bride of his own choosing a bride of his own desire a bride that would match what's in his heart that's the most important thing in the world is god's bride he made the earth for a purpose he made it to take a bride out of it so now if we could if we can somehow tempt you with the home stretch and begin to think well he may be finishing here soon i want to i want to take us back now to what we were looking at in genesis chapter 2 where he said the generations of the heaven and of the earth and then we looked at how he talked about the generations of adam so the generations of the heaven and earth is expressed in plant and herb and even man itself coming forth from the earth and then in genesis chapter five it says these are the generations of adam and it begins to tell the generations of adam beginning with seth all the way to know these are the ones that were beget from him and come forth from him and then brother brennan makes this statement and as we're as we're pondering this and we're maybe going back to last sunday and how that we we recognize that with heaven and earth there was an affinity and there was a union in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth they're represented together in creation and then in christ jesus when he comes we he's recognized as a man you being a man not over 50. he he walks his man he eats his man he's born of a woman even as the scripture says yet we realize there's deity that's the blood of god that's flowing through those veins but at the jordan river when the dove descends upon christ and that's when the father and the son unite in this union and brother man says that was the greatest event this world world has ever seen and will see until christ and the church have united together again so that was the greatest event until now until right now so the greatest event this world had ever seen now this is unfolding where we see now in the spiritual union of christ and his church he says that is when god and man became one when at the jordan river the dove coming descended upon that body descended upon his son that's when god and made became one heaven and earth embraced each other and kissed each other that's a union that's adjoining together he says that's the greatest event this world's ever seen until now and let me just express this as it burns in my heart that when you think about how the whole world is groaning for the manifestation of sons viewing it in this way and falling in this path of this storyline you begin to see this earth all along has been pregnant and has been wanting to birth has been wanting to usher forth has been wanting to be under its rightful ruler and to be what it was intended to be in the beginning do you realize the earth didn't sin in the fall but yet it was cursed and so it's a little groaning for the manifestations of sons the world the greatest event the world had ever seen was in that jordan river now it's you it's experiencing and seeing the union once again so it's it's under anticipation it's under expectation right now the earth is groaning for a millennium it's groaning for the manifestation of sons and so in christ humanity and divinity were united the word was made flesh he's a god man he's not just merely a man but he's a god man and so the bible expresses him this way first corinthians chapter 15 verses 45 to 49 and so it it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit that's the last atom you don't have a third atom that's the last atom you can't try to twist the word of god to come up with another atom that's the last atom otherwise we might as well just throw the word out because language doesn't have any meaning anymore he says so it was written the first man was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven and as the earthy as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and as we have born if if that if that verse if that you get lost in that verse just read the next one because it's just going to resolve everything and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly so the first man is of the earth we all say amen to that we identify with it we understand it we get it we're earthy we're grounded to this earth we associate with this earth we have earthly uh everything's earthly none of us were born on mars pretty confident in saying that at least not yet so we we all identify with the world we identify with the earth he says the first man that's your first birth that's your that's what you identify with but then and so this he says but the second man now he's referring to christ the last adam was a quickening spirit but now he has an image of the heavenly but then he makes this beautiful statement and as if we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly even though you may be bowed down with earthiness even though you may be bowed down with worldliness even though you may seem to be so connected with this earth you will also bear the image of the heavenly and you are right now called to express the image of god amen right now though you may be an earthly body it's your table today it's your calling today it is your mission today to express the attributes of the divine to express the attributes of christ and to be bearer of his image a heavenly image as we have borne the image of the earth the oh god let me now begin to bear and reflect home the image of the heavenly so now as we have seen and just quickly looked at the generations of the heaven and earth and the generations of adam what about the generations of the last adam if we've read in the bible the generations of adam and the first adam was made of the earth and all his descendants are from the earth and we could read of a natural history and a natural lineage of them coming from the earth what about us who are of this last adam the bible says in psalms 102 verses 18 to 20 this shall be written for the generation to come remember how we read earlier god wanted you to become he wanted you to come forth so he could i love you shake your hand have fellowship with you this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord this is the people that he creates for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary and noticed the image now that comes together from heaven did the lord behold the earth the very image at this time which says the generation to come the people it shall be created the very image that the scripture places before you is a god who looks down from the height of his sanctuary to behold the earth what there's going to be another union and a fusing together of the heavenly and the earthly he looked from heaven while he steps down out of heaven to place feet on or on earth to bring a union once again of the heavenly and the earthly to unite them together again and this is written for the generation to come a generation that's going to be later eight people which shall be created i don't think in the sense of earthly creation this is divine a people who shall be created for his name's namesake of people that are created for himself a generation to come so as we looked at the generations of adam the bible says in matthew chapter 1 verse 17 so all the generations from abraham to david are 14 generations and from david until the carrying away into babylon are 14 generations and from the carrying away into babylon unto christ are 14 generations and you go back and count you can say that there's three 14s so you have 14 from abraham to david from david to babylon 14 from the current way of babylon unto christ you count 13. there's a missing generation why because in christ there's another generation in christ there's a people which are to be created that it's represented already the 42nd generation it's in him just as you could say in the earth were your bodies and then in adam was the woman you can see now in christ this is another pre-figure now of who you are and this is where you come to the real you this is where you're coming to where the the real is coming forth the real expression god hid the mystery could you just imagine the devil's just poking every son that was born because the bible said he talks devil knew would be a son he shall brew crush your head so he's looking for sons as soon as a man's born what does he do the first first one that's born to adam he murders why he's expecting a man to crush his head he's looking going after sons but he poked at the earth he prodded he perverted he destroyed and the devil's trying to mess with the earth mess with mankind and god all along just hides it thousands of years a couple thousand years later six thousand years four thousand years later here it comes and by then the devil's just so beat up eating up tech and everything god just hides it right in there this is the real thrust coming forth this is the real purpose and he hides in that one generation another generation the people which shall be created in revelations chapter 3 verse 14 and under the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now he waits until the laodicean church age to use this description why because he's signaling at the end of this age there'll be a finishing a finishing of the mystery of god a completion of this creation this is when god is going to finish what he's been building once he has all his elect all that he's ordained all that as they've expressed and come forth then god has finished his mystery so now at the end of the creation he brings forth the amen the faithful and true witness the alpha and omega and he calls them the beginning of the creation of god and notice how brother madam places this he says in the message when he's preaching the laodicean church age he's the beginning of the creation of god oh did you catch that how could god be created if he's a spirit how could he be he is eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was god at the beginning but he that is in he that is the beginning of the creation of god was jesus christ when he was made manifest when god lived in him he is god's creation the first and the last the amen the beginning of the creation of god when god created himself a body and come down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of god the beginning of god now god had the canvas god had the clay god set everything forth and he set the stage of everything he would need to manifest himself foreshadowing all the way down and it was christ and david christ and the prophets god foreshadowed but then the perfect one comes christ but now the stage is set to manifest every single one of his attributes first savior that's that was the primary that's what he wanted to identify himself in christ the lamb that's why he's identified as a lamb but this is now god becoming expressed although foreshadowed in many different ways now he's expressed in his son the beginning of the creation of god god hid it all that time in creation god foreshouted through the story of abraham now he comes forth the beginning of the creation of god brother brahm says he is the beginning of the creation of god and god is eternal but when god was created when a little baby that was conceived in the womb of a mother and she began to develop these cells within her to bring forth this little baby all from the divine no no no none of mary's dna was used none of joseph was used it's all divine he says that was the beginning of the creation of god for god was made flesh and dwelt among us and become emmanuel god with us the beginning of the creation of god so we see now if i could take these these two beginnings in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and your body was brilliant being brought into existence then when all the material was being laid out but now we have in the beginning of the creation of god you're there too you're representing that brother said and knoweth it not we read this the beginning in the beginning of the creation of god when god began to create and bring you into existence so you have the earthly part that we could see in the earth that we now live in that came forth in genesis chapter 1 verse 1 but now the heavenly part now the part that's going to make up the completeness of the person when god began to bring you into existence oh don't look back at jesus as a savior and just think that he came to redeem any man that would just call upon him and it's just merely this this despot of a god who's up there angering you better plead for your forgiveness and you better beg for my intervention but rather look at him as being representing you that you were in him then that you are a part of the divine you're part of the eternal and that he had a purpose and intent and sending the lamb and that was to bring to himself all that were called all that were ordained to come that's why i don't question the sacrifice i don't question the blood that was shed because identify with it that i was in him then i'm not electing him now i'm not choosing him now and that if i waver if i doubt or i get confused or i stumble or i fall it can be taken away no i'm identified with it i'm part of it when god began to bring you into existence i just read this read this statement here from the laodicean church age chapter 9 of the church age book it says but now he's standing in the midst of the church and as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church because now notice the angle that he's looking at this in this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride i said it's another creation as a spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to human ovum supplied by mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last adam of him it was said lo a body that has prepared my father thou father has prepared for me god not mary provided that body mary was the human incubator she carried the holy child and brought him to birth it was a god man he was the son of god he was of the new creation man and god met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race a new creation man and god joined together it's a new he says it's another christian it's a new creation and think of all the scriptures colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation all things have passed away behold all things are become new bill abraham says there you can see that though man was of the old order of creation now in union with christ has become the new creation of god through union of christ you become new a new creature in christ jesus for we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus on two good works and that you put on brother the bible says that you put on the new man which after god has created in righteousness and true holiness this is what paul has identified in ephesians chapter two this is something new this is a new creation when you're born again by the baptismal he goes you become a new creature in christ jesus you've been elevated above your humanity though the humanity is very near you we've got to be connected with the divine you've got to be connected with the newness that i have been made a new creature in christ jesus he says this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation go ahead and call him what he is he's a dead man somebody wants to bring up my past he's a dead man i want to bring up your mistakes he's a dead man don't get me talking about a dead man because i have the power of resurrection so i don't want to start talking about him because i'm just going to resurrect him so i'm just going to leave that man dead that's a dead man he is dead to me he's gone he's past he's been buried in water baptism he's been buried in a cold grave i'm a new man created in christ jesus said this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by the ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and of the abraham's issue through the godly isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has purposed a new creation it has nothing to do with natural lineage anymore natural blood you don't need a dna test you don't need 23 and me you don't need to go out there and find it you can trace back if you're an original jew has nothing to do with it every kindred every tribe every nation he is calling forth a people unto himself and he's purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was god created in the form of a man now by his spirit he's creating many sons unto himself god the creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose if we put it in if we put it in bride language he was god created in the form of a man now today you are his body the woman god in the form of his wife today on earth this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose this is the purpose took from took form this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of god his sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation god just brooding over the earth brooding over the church brooding over church services brooding over a local church what to bring you out to make you expressed oh my in the in the church age book chapter four in the very plain language the true bride of christ was in the midst the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she's also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god in a many-membered body whereas once god was manifested in one member even our lord jesus christ now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifested in the sun and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn hallelujah you can say it's my turn just claim it and accept it it's my turn this is my time this is my season this is my turn oh we mean no disrespect to those that have gone by through other church ages and even jesus as he walked the face he's never gonna say but now this is my turn this is my season this is my time i'm taking my turn i think it was brother morrow who said i'm gonna get selfish with it he says but that's my gift that's my word that's mine i want a claim and it's mine that's how we ought to be with this would you give this up would you give this message up i think what's so beautiful about is you can keep yours and give somebody else theirs and not lose any of it but it is my turn in our turn became the many members spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called amen praise the lord this is the dramatic conclusion he's saying even so we turn on his thoughts now in our return become the manifested word of god oh my it's beautiful i'm just gonna i'm just gonna close here i had some more but i i just want to i just want to close it with this well let's go ahead and read it here in hosea chapter 2. and we'll i'm just trying to bring this down it's only 11 30. they're letting us have the building until midnight so i say the building don't go knocking on doors they're letting us have this this facility right here until all day long not because they've heard my tapes and think i need all that but but i i and i don't want to wear you i know these days are long but notice here in hosea chapter 2 i've got to come to this verses 16 to 23 and it should come it shall be at that date saith the lord that thou shalt be thou shalt call me is she which means husband so it's not boyfriend it's not fiance it's not just even lord master or god it's union you're going to call me husband and shout call me no more bahali which is this is a a deity of baal for i will take away the names of balaam out of her mouth we can identify with this as the gentile the heathen the reprobate out of babylon take away the names of balaam out of her mouth and they shall no more be remembered by their name and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beast of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things of the ground now he's bringing all of creation into view i see myself back in genesis 1 and 2 and i will break the bow and the sword and the battle of the out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely and i will betray thee under me forever no putting away no divorce finality union it's the invisible union but it's also the indivisible union it cannot be separate it cannot be divided i will betray thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies i will even betray thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the lord and it shall come to pass in that day i will hear saith the lord and i will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth bring in these very elements of genesis 1 1 into view again i will hear the heavens i will answer the heavens and they will answer the earth and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear jezreel which means god sows and i will sow her unto me in the earth and i will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and i will say to them which were not my people thou art my people hear the heavens thou art my people and they shall say thou art my god hear the earth amen i will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth and what is it the people say thou art my people we have heard the heavens and then we respond thou art my god and the heavens hear the earth what a beautiful resounding and music song being sung to one another what is it heavenly groom earthly bride singing to one another it's the song of solomon lived out in flesh in this end time and as you read it there's some who say well that that speaks of israel wow we could see that in type to israel but the mystery was the gentile wife the mystery was the gentile bride so then he comes to verse 23 and i say makes it very plain even though i'm saying it's a mystery and i will sow her unto me and the earth i'm going to sow in the earth something for my purpose something of my choosing something from my benefit and i will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy israel had obtained mercy many times and i will say to them which were not my people israel was identified as his people who is he talking about you he's talking about the gentile wife the gentile bride i will say to them thou art my people you didn't know it but i hid the mystery i hid the election i hid the plan you are my people and we resound hear o heavens from the earth thou art my god he sold you already in the earth could we not say that about our bodies already in the earth in the beginning he sowed it there in the earth in the beginning then we see that here we were represented in christ have our representation in christ we were with him then we were in him then but now think of even a i want to say true type but just even another type he sold himself in the earth i will sow her unto me in the earth what earth are we looking at we're not talking about going in our backyards and raking away the rocks and digging through the clay those of us who are lucky enough to have lawns you know digging through the sod he's talking about the earth he sowed something in your earth it was there from the very moment you let out your first and begin to cry it was already there it's already there right then you weren't driving down the road one day and see a billboard jesus saves and says i believe he saves and a seed came into your heart you weren't good to your mom and a seed came in yard you didn't come to church and a seed fall in your heart every backsliding every wandering every drug took every girl chased after whatever it was however way you went it was always there and in some ways maybe it was haunting you but it was wooing you and calling you why because he said i sold a part of myself in you from the very beginning and that's what the preacher the gospel does is it drives back the clouds and it lets shot light shine upon that seed so the son or daughter of god can burst forth to life he sowed himself into your earth that's why it says in isaiah 62 4 thou shalt no more be turned forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hefsiba which means my delight is in her in thy land beulah which means married for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married the same land not just a new land but the same land there's a promise of redemption of this body and that's a promise that you're tied to and anchored to then we see the the process of redemption for the purpose i am no longer term forsaken i am no longer termed desolate even myself as a person i am hefa which means my delight is in her i shall be called my land my body even beulah because it's going to be married hezbollah means it's the name given for jerusalem my delight is in her eden means delight so even in genesis 1 we have the delight of god there he put the man god's delight jerusalem is hefa it's delight and now we see and we can see in christ in whom i'm delighted and pleased to dwell it's all it's all identifying his relationship with you i now delight in you you just tell yourself that sometime maybe even do it now maybe even write in your notes he delights in me he does his scripture wants to tell you that i delight in you lord what about this he's i i i've covered that what about this i've covered that too it covers it's greater it covers all i've been thinking of that song this morning greater than all my sins is the blood that still cleanses me that's greater than all that covers all of it brother branham i just want to use this statement as we close just to bring the whole picture into view now he says all right the entire bible is the entire revelation of jesus christ making himself known to every age he made himself known in the days of luther as a foundation the church the root the legs like you did king nebuchadnezzar you remember how he dreamed those dreams and come from the head down now he comes from the feet up in the babylonian kingdom he showed all those old testaments he come from the head down until he calmed down till god himself became flesh at the foot of the ladder now here in the new testament he brings himself right back up again to the head again the head of gold to be crowned so god was in the beginning and he kept coming down through prophets on down until god himself became human like us plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a baby born in a manger hated rejected despised and a bad name and everything he was then he started rising and from the feet to begin to build the bride coming back on back and now coming out under the headstone where it all joins together and makes the one great transfigured body of jesus christ a union again of earthly and heavenly all making together now he's beginning to raise and it joins together into the headstone a uniting of the individual the person with christ and then what is it doing it's completing the body because soon we're going home going to go to a meeting there wherever all the material is going to be gathered up it's going to be a great union in this guy let's just stand to our feet oh we're just so grateful to the lord maybe we could sing that song greater than all my sin if you if you wrestle with perceiving god's love if you wrestle with identifying yourself with the divine just just begin this morning by confessing lord you delight in me lord there's they're inside of me there must be something good there must be something divine you wouldn't will me you wouldn't have been patient with me you wouldn't have sought me you wouldn't have taken the way that you have lord preserve me and even unto this time constantly pursued me if you didn't delight in me maybe you could just express that back to him say lord i know you're delighted me lord i know that you love me lord i know that you've been patient with me lord you've seen me through time and time again father you just yield to him today expressing your love back to him if he delights in you you can say lord i love you you're so good to me lord with our heads bowed we'll just say a prayer of blessing upon us even a dismissal prayer if you desire prayer just lift your hand to the lord he sees the needs in your heart and in your life our gracious heavenly father lord you delight in us this bride is not desolate this bride is not forsaken but you delight in her and you have married her lord if any find themselves on the outside of this relationship with you may they come to you pleading lord the blood of calvary asking for forgiveness of sins lord with the repentant heart to be found in you lord to be found in the forgiveness of sins to walk in obedience to your word and water baptism not that they would just go through the stations as it were of lighting candles and our fathers and glory bees but lord that they would walk in the pattern of your word to be quickened to new life by the baptism of the holy ghost lord i believe you're still calling to souls i believe the door is still open lord i believe that the voice of god comes through your word today and father as it draws to our hearts and it speaks to us we yield to it regardless of our station today regardless of our position today lord we yield ourselves to you many of us have walked with you from some time father we felt your presence we know the touch of redemption we've experienced the forgiveness of sins we're we're new creatures in christ jesus but yet we have a longing lord for more lord may we overcome the complexes in our mind may we overcome the condemnation of our hearts and look to you who is greater and may you who is greater take us to your bosom today lord may it resound deep within our hearts my love is greater than your condemnation my love is greater than your heart my love is greater than your thoughts may we yield to it lord may we accept it accept the purpose of it father i pray now as we close this service that you'd bless your people bless the many who have come lord just to show their support i pray that you would encourage them and strengthen them father speak to them and guide them give them comfort they need to take the path that they desire to walk in lord the path that you desire them to walk in give us the grace lord to do so the grace to hear your voice the humility to walk where it calls us we commit the people to you now father in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and
