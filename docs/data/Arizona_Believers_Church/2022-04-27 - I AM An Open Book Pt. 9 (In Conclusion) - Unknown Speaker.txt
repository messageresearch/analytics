TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're concluding the subject as far as a sermon series on i am an open book now this is the ninth service we've spoke on this and when i thought about it this afternoon this is actually part one in terms of what i originally thought i was going to preach in the first service as the lord was doing with my heart over a number of weeks and months leading up to preaching on this subject these things here tonight is what was the initial inspiration and i'm excited just to share with you this as a capstone to this series in the masterpiece we've been reading this statement it says he fulfilled speaking of jesus christ he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new and the old are husband and wife that's an important concept to catch the new and the older husband and wife and it took the old to foreshadow foreshow the new christ came the masterpiece to fulfill that to fulfill what old testament now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece is in making so to the same extent that you have christ fulfilling the old testament he fulfilled the old testament now there's a new testament which is another piece to be fulfilled that and in the fulfilling of it we can draw then a type and a shadow of how christ fulfilled the written word and the old testament now as wife to christ we are going to fulfill he says everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece in the making and that's been the thrust of the i am an open book jesus christ manifested the written old testament now the bride is the living word of the new testament in a climax in a climactic way in a fulfilling way in a summing way and we begin initially and you can relax a little bit i'm not going to repreach eight services as my conclusion but we begin initially as the i am being god this is the unknown god the invisible god a god that hides himself this is i am the mysterious god but then jesus christ declares that he is the i am before abraham was i am an intentional connection there and so this sealed god even the mystery of the old testament is revealed in jesus christ and so there is this open book in jesus christ before the israelites to whom the scrolls were given and now in the same way it's an open book in his bride the bride is the opening of the new testament she is the manifestation of the written word and we were drawing from these statements and i know you're familiar with them and i realize tonight even the number of places we could have drawn from but we just picked some key ones to refer to but brother ram says in god's power to transform but since the opening of those seven seals of them angels just beyond behind the mountain yonder this has become a new book the bible since the open of the seven seals he says this has become a new book so there's something uh something dynamic that happens when these seals are open or when that prophetic time comes and we could you could kind of get lost in maybe some of the very specific dates and seasons or the times and instances and what were the mechanics what were the mechanics it's just to understand this that the opening of the seals fulfills prophecy of the bible and you enter into a different season of prophetic fulfillment and so you say now in this time when god has revealed these certain things the bible becomes a new book and and kind of what my thesis has been is the bride you as individual members of the body of christ you are the living manifestation of this new book you're what makes it new when christ came fulfilling the old testament it was like wow this is different this is new we didn't think about this we didn't ponder it this way and so he became the interpretation of the written word and now you as a manifestation of the prophecy or the interpretation of the written word and we drew heavily from brother adam speaking in the same day on the seals where he says don't put any interpretation to it don't put any interpretation to it just live a christian life and you realize that's exactly what interpreting means is to live the life and the interpretation is the manifestation now in revelations chapter 5 and and that that's just me just kind of picking up the general theme of what the first several services were on now to try to bring this in conclusion in the scene that we read about in revelations chapter 5 it's introducing this book that brother branham says since the open to those seven seals that the seven seals mentioned here in revelations 5 1 and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals so revelations 5 1 describes this book it is the book of redemption it even is representative of the entire bible which tells the story of redemption and so it's sealed up it's been written within and on the backside and it's sealed up with seven seals so you could look at this book and say there's some things that are written uh uh and and on the inside written within and and written on the backside and sealed with seven seals so you could even look at the book and say huh maybe someone could discern something by looking on the outside of it but there's no question there's something sealed up on the inside that's not known now brother branham describes this book this way in the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals it's a very uh descriptive title and informative title by him using this description the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals what do you what what ought that to clue us in on you have an unfolding of a dispensation which is the seven church ages now he says there's the breach there's a gap there's a space between the seven church ages and the seven seals so it's it's a timing it's dispensations and he says we're standing in the breach between two time periods of the church ages and the seven seals the breach between the two isn't you know uh isn't uh it it is he's specifically standing there as a prophet between these two dispensations and i would say is the keystone to tie them together and so we're coming out of church ages into a capstone into a bride age that's signaled just by this title so he says hold that word redemption until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed and the redeemer comes to claim his possession nothing can do it and he's talking about the seal being broken nothing can break that seal and the seal upon the soul so he says hold that word redemption he says don't grieve it say do things that pleases god for the and this is not the same for the book is sealed now and you are sealed amen this is a very peculiar combination of thoughts to be sealed by the holy ghost but then the book is sealed and he's he's catching something as a prophet to say that and i'll come to these scriptures here in a moment that you're sealed the believer is sealed by the baptismal holy ghost and there's a book in revelations 5 that sealed and this seal is unto the day of redemption and when this book is claimed it's the day of redemption and so there's one leading to the other and the one is connected with the other and the one is for the purpose of the other and the one finds it fulfillment and completion in the other so as a prophet he's trying to bring in this connection between the two and he says the book is sealed now and you were sealed the holy spirit itself is a seal seal signifies a finished work and when the seventh seal is broken the mystery of god that sealed in these mystery mysterious seals is finished and he says until the day that seal is broken then it's revealed what's on the inside of it i catch this language and i've only put up this key phrase there the book is sealed now and you are sealed so he brings those two together but then he says when this whole when the seven seals are broken this mystery is finished and when it's broken the mystery god that's in there is is revealed it's revealed what's on the inside of it so there's a book written on the outside written within but sealed so what's on the inside can't be read and he says when this book is open it reveals what's on the inside of it now the next couple paragraphs he talks about how a seal signifies ownership and when there's a seal placed on something that signifies ownership and he talks about how a seal signifies security so there's a security with the seal security so he's really getting into what the seal means and then he makes this statement again the book is sealed and you are sealed with the book until the day of redemption and so there the book is sealed and then you are sealed so now what what i'm wanting you to kind of catch is if the book is sealed up and then you are sealed what happens when the book is opened so now in ephesians chapter 4 verse 30 and this is where brother branham is drawing from it says and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption so the seal of the holy ghost it's a seal for unto before a purpose you're sealed unto the day of redemption now you don't read it in the sense that well that's as long as the seal lasts because once this day comes it's no good but the seal is for redemption it's for that day it's always it's from the very moment that god poured it out on the day of pentecost it was always forward-looking to the moment of full redemption because at the moment that the soul was sealed any one of those people would have told you there's still another promise of him coming there's still another promise of full redemption there's still a kingdom to be restored there's still there's still promises and prophecies that are yet to be fulfilled so the seal of god wouldn't have been up that's it it's all over we've settled into the millennium and we're just going to outlive all these false believers but no it was always forward-looking until the day of redemption and so the seal of god is for the purpose of bringing you to the fullness it's the earnest of full redemption so in ephesians chapter 1 verses 9 to 14 let's just read through this how he expresses it earlier in this book he says having made none of us the mystery of his will now he's bringing in the mystery part of it he's made nona to paul the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ so now this is certainly forward-looking right the dispensation of the fullness of times he's going to gather in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him this is a union this is things coming together that have been part of this great plan of redemption from the beginning speaking of christ in christ whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will i know these are very heavy heavy heavy words that we would love to you just love to digest and expound upon that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ and whom he also trusted after that you have heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise what a beautiful scripture after you believed you after you heard the word of god and you believed then you're sealed after faith after believing i know there's some that would conflate the idea that whenever you mentally ascent to the message that gives you the seal but just verbally agreeing with something acknowledging something is not the seal in itself he says after you have believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise because the baptism of the holy ghost is a seal of your faith it's a definite experience post faith after believing after accepting it's a definite experience of being born again so it says after you were believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise the holy spirit of god you're as he said you're sealed into the day of redemption so paul wrote it in the very beginning of this book you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and notice how he said that we are um that we should be to the praise of his glory that we have we have been predestined that we should be to the praise of his glory so he's given us the baptism of the holy ghost which is the seal of god which is in earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession because redemption has two parts right the purchase but then the redemption of the purchased possession so it's purchased at calvary but there's a claiming there's a taking of the purchased possession he says unto the praise of his glory this is the what paul is looking forward to we're predestined to be unto his glory when that which is perfect just come and when christ who is our life shall appear and all these other things paul was looking forward to this is something that's outlined here you have the holy ghost it's an earnest it's a guarantee it's a down payment that you will be there on that day amen that's what you should long for young people it's what we should all be certain that we have is this new birth experience and paul and all the saints of all ages look forward to the day of redemption why because it was fullness it's completion in romans chapter 8 verses 22 to 23 paul places it this way and brother branham is also placing these very things in this line of this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book the book is sealed and you are sealed until the day of redemption in romans chapter 8 verses 22 to 23 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travail and pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit paul just said this a moment ago that uh that who first trusted in christ that we should be to the praise of glory who first trust in christ we're the first ones we're the first church we're the beginning and he says not only does creation grow but we which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves chained as it were groaning longing desiring not that they would be naked as he says in another place but that we'd be clothed upon that even though our soul is sealed something is held back from us and we're groaning within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body so though birth into the kingdom of god and baptized into the body of christ by one spirit it birthed with him a living hope that there would come a time of adoption completion perfection fulfillment and he ties this time of adoption to the redemption of our body it's the time of full redemption the day of redemption and this is then the book is sealed you are sealed because the seal is for the purpose of full redemption now in souls that are in prison now we've read this statement before to you but i'm going to take it just a few statements further and i want you to listen to this now he says when the seven seals were opened that opened up the entire bible the seven seals it was sealed to seven mysteries and no seven seals held the entire mystery of it and it was the book of redemption new testament not the old it only proclaimed for the new testament now you do you remember that you remember us reading that a number of times that brother ram says when this bite we opened up the entire bible he said it's it's proclaimed this redemption this book of redemption is proclaimed for the new testament he says they and he immediately says they cannot be made perfect without us hebrews 11. so when he's saying this when he makes that statement that there is a fulfillment to the old testament but now the seven seals open up the entire bible and it proclaims redemption for the new testament he says they without us could not be made perfect hebrews 11. and he says now the redemption only come when the redeemer died and they were potentially under the blood of lambs not the redeemer hadn't been redeemed yet until the redeemer came notice now when this redeemer john looked around let me stop there he's referencing even what took place under the old testament and this is what he's laboring in that under the old testament think of all those believers that died under the blood of bulls and goats but they died believing in the ultimate sacrifice that would come and they're the ones that are impacted on the day of resurrection that that that was it's the remarkable mystery of the seed being one christ and they all believed looking forward to the one who would come have he not received the promise having not received the inheritance having not even seen it but believed it and knew it was a far off that when this one came and he shed his blood it retroactively brought in everyone under the blood of bulls and goats with that faith to believe the one was coming so in this moment it just cascades backwards and redeems all them and on the day of resurrection paradise empties out and there's this a resurrection of the old testament saints who paul is saying they without us could not have been made perfect but now he says john looked around here sat on the throne with the book in his hand that had been sealed with seven seals and the whole plan of redemption was in it and it had been lost by the human race adam now he's bringing us into he's bringing revelations 5 into view and he's saying it's the just it's not just one part but it's the whole book of redemption that's laying there and he says it proclaims it for the new testament hebrews 11 they without us could not be made perfect so in hebrews chapter 11 verses 39 and 40 and these all if you go back read hebrews 11 by faith then it goes through this whole list paul says and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise but still faithful still had faith god having provided some better thing for us all right all right paul you know humble yourself a little bit but paul is being honest hey god provided some better thing for us not despising any day gone by not despising the manifestation and the foreshadowing the types of christ but he's saying god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect what a remarkable statement abraham without this group could be made perfect and and job and david and all these other patriarchs and fathers they were not perfect without it that's just what paul's saying amen but notice how brother branham picks up on it and you see the compound fulfillment the statue of perfect man he reads hebrews 11 he says you get it these people who died in here he reads this very verse verse 40. these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection what does it mean that they without us should not be made perfect today in our time in this compound fulfillment the church today has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they are under souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection so they who have already gone on the saints of all ages even in this layout of the same age all the people who've gone on are waiting for this time when the bride will come into a perfection for resurrection and they without us without the capstone without the great climax of redemption of the body are not made perfect either and he says the church has to come to its perfection in the message desperations he says every age has followed that to see that it's brought forth and they could not be made perfect without us and he says and now the entire holy spirit visits the church making god in human flesh what now the entire holy spirit visits the church making god in human flesh this is the this is the eden after he preaches the token let's tune in to this dispensational change let's recognize what he's wanting us to catch as believers every age that followed it brought forth something he says and they they all these other ages could not be made perfect without us because this is the time where the entire holy spirit visits the church what does it produce god in flesh again and you'll find many many statements just as it was in his for the days of his flesh just whereas he walked the shores of galilee he's doing it again today it's the reveal of the son of man he continues in all things that he hasn't done down through the ages and the church ages he is now doing back to the word because the messages and the messages and the messages have to wind up in the entire world and in the last days the seven seals being opened was to pick up every straggle that's been left off in it and make the whole thing in one great big body of the bride did you catch that what's the whole point of opening the seals what's the whole point of tying together loose ends to lift up a man to to revere to become branhamites uh to baptize the name of william branham to sit around waiting for brother brown to come back no every straggle has made up the whole thing into one great big body of the bride that them who lived back there were not perfect until this church be perfected and this bright group in the last days to bring them in and all together be taken up wow that's what this is all for that's why it matters how you live can you imagine no pressure but all the saints through all the ages come on get it right live the life right live the life please live the life because we're waiting on you them back there who lived were not perfect until this bride is perfected this bride group in the last days it brings them in we all together are taken up and this is where brother ma'am orients this promise they that without us could not be made perfect the bride has to come into her perfection well how in the world is this going to happen he says it's the time when the holy s the seals are open the entire holy spirit visits the church so now to use this an example in scripture because paul says grieve not the holy spirit why be whereby you are sealed into the day of redemption this has a very paul is using a language that would have not been foreign to a jew because they had laws of redemption they had cycles of redemption they had rules in which the land would not be sold forever and it's written into their laws to where if if something was sold a person sold to property because they owed a debt or they had to do something they had a way where ultimately that would be brought back into the family they would redeem it again and they had laws of marriage and they had rules because the land belonged to them and though it could be sold for a season ultimately it was always redemption we're going to get it back it's ours it's ours there's a way to get it back so to say that something is sealed under the day of redemption that meant something to a jew that to us when i say it to you you just think about the seal upon your soul right nobody can see it but you know it's there and it's it's hidden there it's sealed it's sunken into this body and it's it's hidden it's a hidden seal down inside and i know it speaks of redemption and nobody may know it's there but i know it's there and it's sealed nobody can break it nobody can tamper with it the devil can't get to it and then on the day of redemption it's going to bring me to the fullness and it's all going to be given back to me brand new body and that's the way we think but to a jew they would be thinking about the promises in the old testament and paul i believe is even be very precise to follow the language in jeremiah chapter 32. and i'll read verses 6 to 15 to you and kind of just expound upon it a little bit we're making really really good time tonight it says in jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying behold hannemuil the son of shalom thine uncle shall come unto thee saying by thee my field that is in nanathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it so here's a jeremiah has a right to buy this field with within the family or right to redeem it so hannah meal my uncle son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the lord instead of me it happens exactly like god said it would by my field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the country of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself so jeremiah had the right of inheritance and he had the right to redemption remember paul uses the language which is the redemption which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession and how we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated and he's using this same language the right of inheritance and the right of redemption is thine buy it for thyself then i knew that this was the word of the lord and i bought the field of hannah meal my uncle's son that was in hanov and weighed him the money even 17 shackles of silver and i subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances i i want to describe this before i need to read the next verse but here this is this is the closing anybody ever been to a closing thankfully in these days we're not counting out dollar bills uh to get to the uh to close on a house especially with the monopoly money they're playing with these days with the houses that are being sold things california but uh this is a closing and what happens is there's two deeds in this closing so i subscribe the evidence so something is being subscribed written down i subscribed it and then i sealed it i took witnesses weighed the money so everyone's witnessing the transaction it's in the presence of all these in the court as it were for the prison and hera here's the money here's the subscription things are being signed be witness and sealed and what would take place is two deeds would be written and the original was sealed but then the other there was another copy which had held less authority but yet it still had some authority but it wasn't as great as the sealed copy so one copy had authority and you relied upon it but if this other copy ever was questioned you'd break the seal on the original and you and you would compare it and that would be the final answer and so they say in some cases that the sealed copy contained more details about the conditions the time of redemption um certain particulars so that you could always test the veracity of a witness and say oh you said it was this you said it was that well let's just go ahead and open up the original and unseal it and if you said it was 100 shekels and the document says it was 17 you you you're found out to be a liar so there's this so that the copy if the copy which had authority was ever questioned the sealed copy would be unsealed before judge amen so he says in verse 11 so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open so he took a sealed copy and he took an open copy and i gave the evidence of the purchase under baruch the son of neriah and the son of messiah in the sight of hannah mill my uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the perches before all the jews that sat in the court of the prison do you realize that revelations 5 describes almost the exact same scene in terms of in the presence of all the elders in the presences of witnesses in the court of the prison this transaction is being sealed and we fast forward in revelations chapter five this isn't a an odd uh collection of individuals to a jew this would have been like wow that looks exactly like the way we conducted business back in the day take and he says he says in all the jews that sat in the court of the prison and i charged baruch saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel listen what he says take these evidences the evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days oh he says take this which is open which is understood which has been declared if i could just go ahead and say that part of the book which is christ which is open which we receive by the word of god in this new testament take that but then there's this other part that is sealed and he says place it in an earthen vessel that it may last many days because the purpose of the earth and vessel that itself being enclosed was to preserve the evidence through time if there was a flood if there was a fire if there was the siege they wanted this to survive any any any uh disaster any kind of uh siege of the enemy they wanted this evidence to survive why because it must be redeemed this can't be lost it doesn't matter if enemies come the floods come if fires come this must stand because one day you having the right of inheritance and the right of redemption you have this right yourself then it must be the land will not be sold forever it must come back to its rightful owner it's gotta come back to whom it's promised to so he says seal it up put an earthen vessel then it might survive many days amen so that which was hid in the earth sealed in these vessels was a token of and and i realized now that it should take much more time just to connect this into their captivity because the whole purpose of this is it was a token of their deliverance right it was a token that they were coming back to the land that they had lost you wouldn't sell something let's just think about it in terms of of what's literally taking place i could say well i've got a i've got a plot of land on mars i'll sell you how much money are you gonna be willing to pay for land on mars are you thinking about it i mean so i guess we have bought certificates right where we own a star we own something how much did you pay for that and how how realistic was it that one day i'm going to build a house on mars the whole transaction only makes sense if one day it's going to be possessed again so this very transaction spoke we're coming back one day this whole time that we're going to spend in captivity in babylon babylon's going to lose its power one day babylon is going to lose its hold one day we're going to hear a voice calling us out of babylon and we're going to go right back to the land that was ours that was promised to us and we're going to possess the land in its fullness again so there was a these sealed vessels were in evidence that a day of redemption would come for it says it in verse 15 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land that's what this whole transaction meant so you realize when paul is using the language of inheritance and being sealed into the day of redemption and being predestined to be an inheritance and earnest of an inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession that's exactly what jeremiah did he purchased it he had paid the price so what he does is he takes that which is open and he puts an earthen vessel but then there's another part that's sealed and he puts it in earth vessel he said this is going to stand as a witness until one day i can claim what i've already purchased so it's a perfect reflection of what christ did on calvary where he pays the price but he says one day i'm going to come back and claim it and until then what i'm going to do is i'm going to put a seal in earthen vessels and they're going to be a witness and a testimony that one day i'll come back and claim it all amen and it says in second corinthians chapter four verses six to seven i know i'm doing on something a little bit different with the slides but i wanted to encourage you all to bring your bibles and read them flip those pages around just we'll have to start taking allergy pills be so much dust kicking up in here as we start using these old bibles again but in second corinthians chapter four verses six to seven as you're turning there hopefully you can see this it'll just stand out to you for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts so now there's an examination coming to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ now think about this in our day what did brother branham say child of my when you look into this bible you're looking at me face to face what is it that was declared in the cloud it was the face it's the countenance it's it's a face-to-face connection that's being made and then shall we know as also i am unknown and and then shall we see face to face there's a even a prophetic element to this and notice the language he uses in verse 7 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us what a language he's using we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and none of us what is this treasure in this earth and vessel it's the earnest of full redemption what is this treasure that we have in this earth and vessel it is something that is a seal of god upon the soul the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory that is what we have in these earth and vessels and it's a language that hearkens back to jeremiah 32 that there was a seal placed upon this and it was deposited into an earthen vessel that it would stand within the earth and vessel that the price has been paid and redemption is coming what is this treasure it's the evidence it's the earnest of redemption until the day of redemption until the day of redemption so then we come to revelations chapter 5 verse 7. because there's a book that sealed and i know i skipped a little bit because john john is crying he's he's weeping he wept much verse 4 no because no one was found worthy and so john is moved by this you might think well why was john john is he just a softy i mean like why does he always cry when we talk about this sealed book and and john is crying and weeping john understands the scene john john gets what's happening here it's as if it were as if we were before a judge and there's been a claim made and now now there's been a dispute about the claim satan's an accuser there's been a dispute there's been an accusation somebody's challenged the title the chain of title through the church ages and so now john is saying this is fine we had a plan for this in the old testament there was a way that we would resolve this we would go back to the original document and we would unloose it and we would settle it and john's sent up there and there's this seal oh and john's thinking oh perfect this is great this is going to settle it it says well no one's worthy to open it john says wait a minute wait a minute i know the price was paid i know this is ours i know that these things we have the right to this and this is a very moving time for him and then it says in verse 7 and he came who is it the lamb he came and took the book out of the right hymn that sat upon the throne what's taking place the kinsmen redeemer claiming the title deed for what the entire human race because brother brahm said it's this book was the whole plan of redemption that had been lost by the human race when adam fell the book was taken away from him where did it go not to satan it went back to god in heaven on the throne and the book has been waiting there until this very time here's this book that they all thought was coming back in the days when christ came the first time he's going to set up his kingdom upon earth this is the time the messiah is going to restore all things but now this scene that is taking place brother says the most sublime thing in scripture called the sublime act sublime means the highest most supreme it cannot be excelled this is what he's saying this moment cannot be excelled because he's going to loosen something that's been sealed he's going to uh un loose something that has been bound he's going to open up something that's been hidden he's going to reveal something that's been a mystery are you are you following me so far in this i'm i'm super super inspired this evening and fees to the trumpets he says while this group down here has got two thousand bound at the river euphrates and he's talking about the two hundred thousand thousand demons loose at the river euphrates under the seal and he says it's been bound for two thousand years he says also this is the parliamentary catch also that church has been bound the holy ghost for nearly 2 000 years under martyrdom back there and under the church ages and it's been bound not at the river euphrates but at the door of creeds and dogmas that the holy spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems but she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the bible said so there's what a curious statement the holy ghost the church has bound the holy ghost for nearly 2 000 years so under the church ages there's a holding back of even the holy ghost remember he said in desperations now the entire holy spirit visits the church making god in human flesh he's saying there's been something held back through the church ages you can almost see and i say almost and i'm always very careful on trying to pinpoint these definitive moments where something shifts or transitions as if you can kind of bright line test it was at this very second on this very day but the church ages really don't start until the church at ephesus leaves its first love that that's how you even enter into a cycle of church age because church ages revival and death revival and death so once they start to begin to lose their first love and the holy the antichrist begins to work against the church that's what kind of enters us into this dispensation where paul has to step in even almost as one who is correcting a church already and it's air and trying to establish things correctly that antichrist coming in right away he says now the holy ghost has been bound he said oh does that mean the holy ghost wasn't a church no because he says it was in the church christ was in the church but he's saying there's something representing this symbolism something representing this language but he says but she is going to be liberated that's what the bible says she's going to be liberated he says in paragraph 232 the holy spirit has been bound by the denominations all these two thousand years issues and feast of the trumpets paragraph 242 and the same seal when it was opened to show jesus on the outside of the church trying to get back in think about that language that visual he says at the same time the trumpet sounds for the jews and the jews recognize the atonement glory hallelujah oh my he says the holy spirit had has been bound by these denominations for almost 2 000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said it he promised it this is a remarkable statement this is very clear it's plain language what he's saying i think the mystery of it is very deep and profound so i'm not trying to make light of it but he's saying something the holy spirit's been bound for nearly 2 000 years denominations have been holding them back the church has been holding them back it gets to the end time where you find out that now christ is finally excommunicated so the process of holding them back is a weaning away from the word from the word of slight deviation in the beginning leaving thy first love results in the culmination of a complete and total blackout of the church in christ on the outside of it but he says she's to be liberated in the last days what the bride is going to know her mate he says in this message the revealed word and she's going to be liberating the last days and the holy spirit's going to be back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh why because the evening time message is to liberate her and this is what's happening when he comes and takes the book and so revelations now i know there's i know that i might just be kind of putting out there and it might seem to just kind of be in the void but i i believe your spiritual minds can grab that got to hold that and connect it to so much of the teaching in this word of god that this something bound remember the book was sealed and you were sealed but in the last stage she's going to be liberated this is i am an open book the book was sealed i was sealed when the book was opened i'm opened i'm liberated this is your liberation this is your jubilee this is your day of redemption any dispute or claim that the devil's there saying oh he didn't purchase it no he didn't do it no he didn't do it and he said well the bible says the bible says and so what does he start doing he starts taking issue with the what the written word says right oh no it doesn't quite say that no it doesn't say that it doesn't say that so god god has something that was already sealed up we'll let that which is sealed be the final vindication we'll let that which is sealed be the final evidence in the final testimony and so john the one that had been weeping what he witnesses and remember again john is going to be emotional because he's tied to the he knows this he sees this lamb having paid the price he understands the significance of the scene of the throne room and the elders this is proof this is evidence this is vindication this is this is when it's all comes down and the final proof is given and in that moment he said weep not for the line of the tribe of judas prevailed to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and he looks and he sees the lamb and he and certainly at this point there's something begins to stir up inside of him he's like yes of course it'd be the lamb because he's the one that paid the price just as jeremiah paid 17 shekels of silver he's the one that paid the price the one that paid the price he knows what's in the subscription he knows what's sealed up in there he's the one that paid for it he knows redemption is paid for and says and he came and took the book and he loosed the seals thereof and this is john's response verse 13 and every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i say it i want you to recognize that john uses the language to describe everything that would have been in creation and everything that is connected with the earth that which is in heaven and on earth under the earth in the sea and in them heard eyes saying this is something that is resounding within heaven something that is resounding upon earth it brings us all the way back to genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and now at the time of the redemption of the whole thing the whole earth is going to hear a redeemed son of god proclaim something blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever hallelujah what a what a proclamation of redemption and brother branham makes some statements about this that are so enlightening i know you've heard them before so we're just enjoying ourselves tonight rehearsing things that we already know brother man says you know that got next to you john i mean he because he gets happy he he he throws it throws into a jubilee this guy who's crying you ever met somebody who's like you know i just don't understand that why this is happening and all of a sudden they just switch from crying to completely even killed well it's almost john sitting there weeping and weeping and weeping the next moment you know he's dancing he's shouting he's rejoicing he got next to himself burma said he said brother said he must have seen his name written there when those seals broke he must have got real happy when the seals opened on the book john got happy but why did he get happy he must have he says he must have saw his name wrote there when the seals are open john got happy because he saw his name written there and he says in the same message talk about a happy time when the seals broke john must have looked in seen past the curtain of time he saw past this veil john looked past the curtain of time and said there's john so what did john see when he looked into the open book he saw himself in the open book and he says and that's what made him happy it's one thing to look in the book and see christ it's one thing to look in the book and maybe see william branham it's one thing to look at and see the vindication through the ages but if any time the veil is torn and you can look into this word of god and see yourself that's when you really get happy that's your jubilee that's your revival that's your rejoicing that's your liberation he must have saw his name well it was more than a name it was an identity it was a character it was himself he didn't just look and say john john how many johns do we know almost there's so many john's john who john who i know a million john's in my family no he saw himself it wasn't just a name it was an identity it was a picture he saw himself and that's why he got happy oh you say brother you're getting beside yourself i'm excited about what john saw i'm excited about what aaron sees now because this is more this isn't john in his day getting a sneak peek at the photo album isn't that what happens when you get your family pictures taken you always want to get a little sneak peek you don't want to wait till they're done photoshopping even though you should all those filters it's a miracle what they do wedding photos you want to know kind of what they look like and you want to kind of see it but there comes a time when it's going to be it's going to be presented oh this perfect picture john saw himself there's other perfect pictures you're in this book and what john was saying is something that's end time related now i'm going to read a statement to you and i want you to be very focused now because what brother brown says here you could you could hear it you could read it and skip right over i'm not saying you have but it could be very easy to do it he says then he come forth and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and time was no more now if you read revelations chapter five verse seven it doesn't say anything about time being no more but brother branham to connect it says and immediately an angel appeared and the 10th chapter and the seventh verse so what happens revelations 5 7 comes to revelations 10 7. this is immediately what happens when this happens there's a coming together or you could say revelations 10 7 it comes to revelations 5 7 but somehow immediately when this book is taken and broken open and that seal is open immediately an angel appears to the angel of revelations 10 7. saying this angel come down and swore the time was no longer you see in this book what was was what was redeemed in this book was what was redeemed in this sealed book was what was redeemed it was the book of redemption and everything had been redeemed was in that book and all that he died for was written in that book what did he say in christ the mystery god revealed all that's in the book is the believer because that's him amen and somehow this this beautiful connection is made revelations 5 7 comes to revelations 10 7 why because it's he says time is no no longer he connects the two together does he not teach in the breach that their seventh angel messenger is on the earth at the time of revelations 10 1 he's not on the earth at the time of this coming i'm telling you these things we could say in one sense is historical we've got to recognize these things as being very relevant for us so john when the book was open saul himself and then in a parallel immediately what's this now comes to revelations 10 7 the books come back down to earth and the angel seventh angel messenger revelations 10 7 and the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery god should be finished the bride is the final manifestation of god as he has declared to his servants the prophets beautiful mystery being fulfilled and verse 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again saying go and take the little book which is opened in the hand of the angel which stands upon the sea and upon the earth i know we've gone to great lengths to examine these you know in the beginnings here of this church and the and the only thing that's taken only difference now is john's heard the seven thunders and this mystery now gives him a right the one who wasn't allowed to even look on it right nobody said no one was worthy to loose it neither to look on it and so no one's found worthy and the next thing we know after it's open john all of a sudden is worthy john not only can look at it but he can touch it right not only can he look at it but he can go and ask for it right he can actually go to the one that has the book open and say let me have the book and somebody said hey whoa whoa whoa slow down a minute john you're not even allowed to look at it let alone touch it but now something has changed he's been liberated now he can actually go to this open book why because it opened up the mystery of who had a right to it as long as it was sealed there could be things written on the outside and you're just not quite sure who it is whosoever will and it's kind of written in a cryptic way everyone can read it it's the book that's open but there's another part that's sealed that's been down hidden inside these earthen vessels but the time of the opening of this book there's a vindication that comes forth and john who had that right of inheritance can go to that person and say give me the book and this is what this is this is how the message moves us i believe you can even see this being in parallel with the message of the hour because now now we come and we want to take the book we got to go to him who is christ not the messenger the messenger points us to christ so we don't go to william branham and ask for the book brother branham and ask for the book we go to christ and this introduction's been made this union is taking place and then when we go to him what it was that we found in this and i went under the angel and he said unto and said unto him give me the little book so now you're walking in obedience to the message and then it brings this introduction he that heareth my voice and will open up i'll come into him and sup with him and he with me now there's this give me the little book and then the further mystery unfolds and he said unto me take it which is what the message said do but now there's another part and eat it up there's a lot of people that are just wanting to take it and take it but they're not going to him and taking it because the further unfolding is now you can eat it up and it's almost like whoa wait a minute what john couldn't even look at it let alone touch it and now he can take it and eat it he says but it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and i ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i'd eaten it my belly was bitter there's a lot of beautiful things expressed in that but they all wanted to come to this and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings thou must prophesy again what is it that john's going to be saying what is it that john's going to be expressing the contents of this book has got to be prophesied before many thou must prophesy again you can only prophesy after your process in the contents of the prophecy taking the book he's eating it and in this image that's expressed here taking an open book and eating it now john is anointed to prophesy again to speak again it's the open book which is christ being prophesied again he says i must prophesy again before many people's nations tongues and kings it sounds a lot like what happened in revelations 5 13 every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard eyes saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and the lamb forever and ever speak again john prophesy again sound it out declare it amen this is the very image of the bride who has had has this introduction to christ in the end time and is feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man we have got to take these face-to-face experiences and these places where god is fulfilling his promised word we've got to be taken these instances of these intimate expressions of his word whether it be the new birth which is the baptismal holy ghost divine healing the laying on of hands the manifestations of gifts all these things have to be internalized into a life that prophesies again that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he's liberated his bride in this last days to be the final voice to the final age this is what's sounding out from the bride now this very verse prophesying again prophesying again around the world it's going and second corinthians chapter three verses two and three i've read this to you a number of times in this he says for ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men paul had a message in his heart he wrote it in a personal letter to the corinthians then they took it believed it and lived it he says now you're my letter for as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us paul ministered christ they received it and then manifestly declared it written not with ink but with the spirit of living god not on the tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart it brings the mercy seat into view and what i've been expressing in this very scripture is the bride is the written word manifested in its season manifestly declared to be christ the bride will manifestly declare christ whatever's written she manifestly declares and it's exact it's exampled in paul's ministry because he says in first thessalonians 1 chapter 1 verse 8 i'm gonna i'm going to create just a little bit of hope that's all i have left but i can preach between the lines if you need me to i just have two scriptures and this quote from the second seal and i'm done it's going to be the end in conclusion watch i'll end up preaching to part 17. just just just so the lord said i'm in control of this says for for from you first that's between 1 8 if you turn there that's first thessalonians 1 8. if you're in a hurry for from you sounded out the word of the lord from who from you sounded out the word of the lord this is the humility of the first age church messenger he's not saying hey it's only me i'm the only one you got to pass my letters around you can only it's only it's only my letters it's on my list no from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia but nikaiah but also in every place your faith to god were to spread abroad so that we need not to speak anything do you see the image that is expressed by paul in this first age it's what is expressed in the last days under the bride under her messenger is the final voice to the final age so that brother branham is not necessarily needing to be here in the flesh to speak anything because the word is sounding out from the bride who has received this message he says so that i need not speak anything why because you're the message lived out flesh and bone from you sounds out the word of the lord so we don't need to speak anything why because your life perfectly interprets what i'm writing to you your life perfectly interprets the epistle of christ ministered by us so from out from you that's what revelations 10 13 is or 11 and you must prophesy again before many peoples in psalm 68 verse 11. it says the lord gave the word it's back whatever that was is back the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it this is exactly what's happened in our day the lord has given the word to his bride and you're the company that publishes it do you realize that you're the original voice of god recordings you're the original voice spoken word publications even before it was incorporated even before was formed when brother brown was preaching the trial when brother i was preaching these messages he said there has been a bride she is risen she's raised up she's here the very fulfillment everything that's been pointing to this time and hour there's going to there's a people that was coming upon the earth that's going to triumph over death and he's and he's declaring it now the bride will be the final voice to the final age the lord in this last days has given his word and great is the bride who is now publishing it now declaring it now expressing it now manifesting it worldwide that's the i am an open book that's you are the open book i want to close with this prayer from the second seal he says to bow your heads you could if you wanted to you could focus now very intently on what he's saying and i want to be very purposeful in reading this as we as we weigh all these statements as to which ones should be read he says let's bow our heads just a moment heavenly father oh i just sometimes lord stand here and i tremble i think of that awful hour that's approaching this isn't the second seal there's no way to stop it it's predicted that it would come now i thought of why don't people come and listen and why don't they come and accept it but of course i know that you said they wouldn't so they won't but there are some that's got their names written on the lamb's book of life and when them seals are throwed open there they see their name there and the holy spirit speaks to them they come there's other places i could read very similar statements but notice what he just said when the seals are opened you see your name the holy spirit speaks and you come you can't keep them away no one can no one they're coming anyhow because you're leading them like you did those little birds and the sheep and the cattle it's referring to the instance where he saw there in india where there was an earthquake coming and long before they even knew the earthquake was going to come all of a sudden there was some sense that the birds began to fly the cattle got away from the the wall why because some sense was telling them danger's coming there's an earthquake coming get out of the way and he led the animals to safety and it's something that they've tried to figure out and studied how do animals kind of get this sense beforehand is it something in in the earth magnetism is it some kind of vibration or sound unknown demand but there's some way that animals respond quicker and earlier than than humans do to some of these great uh terrible calamities and these natural disasters and he's saying it's you that's leading them couldn't we say he's leading them why everyone else is unaware people look at us and they look at our gatherings and they look at our faith and they look at our testimony and they can't figure out why in the world you're doing this why do you believe the way that you do why do you stand for what you stand for how come you haven't quit have you not read everything that's been said are you not aware of this are you not aware of that and everyone's trying to figure out and build some big case and you're sitting here saying i'm just led i can't help it this is this is more than just me agreeing with something written this is more than just me being caught by some charisma or some personality what's happened as the book's been open i've seen my name and the holy spirit is speaking to me come come i must come to this i must walk in this just as the holy spirit led those animals out of danger the book has been opened and it's led you here tonight and it's leading others he says thou art god listen he says some instinct that them animals have that they know they must get away listen listen this is my closing statement if instinct to an animal could warn him to flee from danger what should the holy spirit due to a church that claims to be filled with it i asked in the very beginning what's the consequence of an open book what does it mean that the bible's become a new book what what what does that mean for us and i spent a lot of time in the seals to show that it means we've got to live this life we've got to become the interpretation of those seven thunders we've got to be the manifestation of the mystery of god and if an instinct could cause an animal to flee from danger then what should this church do that claims to be filled with the holy ghost what ought to we be up and doing in this hour we who have been liberated in this hour the holy spirit no longer bound by creeds and dogmas christ loosed and liberated and a bride united together with him i asked the question i want your dad lives to be the answer from this moment forward what would a church do who claims to be filled with every fiber of this holy spirit do and let your life be the answer praise the lord god bless you let's stand together this evening
