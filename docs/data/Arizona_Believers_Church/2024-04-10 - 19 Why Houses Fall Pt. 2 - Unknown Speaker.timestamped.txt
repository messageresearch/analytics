[0:00] just GNA jump right into it I think I
[0:02] probably say that every time I preach uh
[0:05] I'm gonna not give much time maybe in
[0:09] some preliminaries to this but if you
[0:10] just look at verse 24 this is part two
[0:13] on why houses fall so I'm just trying to
[0:16] finish what we started on Sunday and
[0:19] just a part two on why houses fall I
[0:21] hope that you're able to kind of build
[0:23] in this thought uh together as a
[0:26] congregation um I I love it when
[0:28] different ones mention that they stream
[0:29] the services that they miss uh and that
[0:31] way we're kind of all in this together
[0:34] but yet if you haven't heard any of the
[0:35] other parts I think the things in here
[0:37] are instructive and stand on their own
[0:39] but in verse 24 it says therefore
[0:41] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[0:44] and doeth them I will liken him unto a
[0:47] wise man which built his house upon a
[0:50] rock and this is immediately after
[0:53] expressing the uh uh those that come to
[0:57] him and do not the will of the father
[0:59] and they uh they've done many wonderful
[1:01] works but they're not doing works of
[1:03] righteousness they're not obeying the
[1:04] will of the Lord and so this is kind of
[1:06] the parable that he gives he says he
[1:08] that hears and does and we looked at
[1:10] obedience quite a bit uh and how that
[1:13] obedience to the word of God is what
[1:14] righteousness is it's not trying to do
[1:17] God a service and it not being his will
[1:19] and saying oh that's righteousness but
[1:21] it's when you do his will it's obeying
[1:23] the will of God is righteousness so he
[1:25] that hears and does is like a wise man
[1:29] who builds his house house upon a rock
[1:31] and that's says it's and when he gives
[1:33] the description of the storms that come
[1:35] he says it was founded upon a rock so
[1:38] Jesus is identifying something uh that
[1:41] is foundational to success and that is
[1:44] the at the basis if we're going to
[1:46] please the Lord if we're going to uh do
[1:48] righteousness he's saying very simply
[1:50] the foundation the best foundation is
[1:52] hearing and doing to hear the word of
[1:54] God to know the word of God and then to
[1:56] do the world the word of God and uh as
[2:00] we've looked at foundations represent
[2:02] what upholds something what gives it
[2:04] strength and what supports something
[2:05] else so the foundation is not the house
[2:08] but the foundation is what holds the
[2:10] house up and we saw in the word of God
[2:12] if the foundations be destroyed then
[2:13] doesn't matter what's built on it it
[2:15] will be destroyed as well you could have
[2:17] the best materials on a foundation but
[2:20] if the foundation fails the materials
[2:22] will fail also so Jesus calls this
[2:25] person a wise P person so it could be a
[2:28] providential Provident prudent those may
[2:30] be some other words we could use but
[2:32] it's one who's Discerning and
[2:35] recognizing things they act very
[2:36] deliberately based upon what they can
[2:38] discern it means to foresee wants and
[2:41] make Provisions to supply them this is
[2:43] what to have wisdom is to see the need
[2:45] and to provide that which is needed so
[2:48] this wisdom this is Insight this is a a
[2:51] foresight by faith I know by faith I
[2:53] hear the word of God the word of God
[2:55] tells me something is a certain way and
[2:57] then you respond to that and it's that
[3:00] wisdom that builds the house and then
[3:03] richly fills the house Insight by faith
[3:05] is what's going to build it establish it
[3:08] make it firm and the Bible teaches us
[3:10] that it's that very thing that's going
[3:12] to fill it with the right kind of things
[3:14] and so through Providence Jesus is
[3:16] saying that this one has built his house
[3:18] upon a rock this is an example of
[3:20] someone who knows the word of God and
[3:22] does the word of God but then in verse
[3:25] 26 and it says everyone that heareth
[3:27] these says of mine and doeth them not
[3:29] shall be liken unto a foolish man so
[3:32] those are the two uh competing things
[3:34] wise and foolish those are things that
[3:36] we could see are are uh the contrary one
[3:39] to another or two categories that we're
[3:41] looking at a foolish man which built his
[3:43] house upon the sand this foolish we
[3:47] could just invert what it means to be
[3:48] wise he's unknowing he's not
[3:50] providential he's not prudent he doesn't
[3:53] understand or if he has any
[3:56] understanding or knowledge at all he
[3:58] doesn't he can't appreciate what it
[4:00] means he may know something but he
[4:02] doesn't understand it he can repeat
[4:03] something but it doesn't really it's not
[4:05] really striking and so to be a foolish
[4:08] would be to uh not know at all or to
[4:11] even know but not act accordingly
[4:13] because you can't appreciate how serious
[4:15] this is reminds me how that there's
[4:17] different standards and law to where one
[4:19] could be negligent and then there can be
[4:21] gross negligence at to where one can
[4:25] still be guilty uh not knowing they
[4:28] don't know so they're they're negligent
[4:29] but then there can be gross negligence
[4:31] where you knew or should have known or
[4:33] if you could prove they knew but they
[4:35] didn't change anything they didn't act
[4:37] you knew that was a hazard you knew a
[4:38] lot of people had gotten hurt on that
[4:40] but you never did anything about it that
[4:42] would be foolish and so that's the
[4:44] thought behind uh even the wise they
[4:47] know and they do and the foolish they
[4:49] they may not know and then if they know
[4:51] they still won't act that's very key in
[4:54] Luke Chapter 6:48 he is like a man which
[4:56] built a house and dig deep this is the
[4:58] wise man he dug deep and laid the
[5:01] foundation on a rock and when the flood
[5:03] arose the stream beat vehemently upon
[5:05] that house and could not shake it for it
[5:08] was founded it was settled it was
[5:10] grounded this is uh it was founded upon
[5:13] a rock this founding speaks of
[5:16] principles the first principles the very
[5:18] foundational things of something so if
[5:20] something starts right it can go right
[5:23] if it starts wrong it's going to end up
[5:25] wrong so this so this is at the core of
[5:28] what it means to have of a foundation
[5:31] it's not physical as much as it is these
[5:34] guiding principles this wisdom in the
[5:37] beginning and one thing just if you
[5:40] could look at Psalms
[5:41] 125 this is where I'm I guess I am kind
[5:44] of just wrapping up or bringing back
[5:46] into view some things from Sunday that
[5:48] obedience that comes from trust gives us
[5:52] security think I might have said it on
[5:54] Sunday that Revelation obedience by
[5:56] Revelation puts us in a safe place
[5:58] you're on a rock you're this this is a
[5:59] good place to be so when your obedience
[6:02] comes from trust and not fear but comes
[6:04] from faith that gives us security but
[6:06] foolishness brings trouble the Bible
[6:09] says in Psalms 125: 1 and 2 they that
[6:11] trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion
[6:14] which cannot be removed but abideth
[6:16] forever the wise man who heard the word
[6:19] of God and then built his house upon a
[6:21] rock is is one who the winds beat upon
[6:25] it the rains come the floods come but it
[6:27] stands sure and the foolish man hears
[6:31] hears the word of God builds a house
[6:34] suffers a storm but his house Falls so
[6:37] there's a lot of similarities and the
[6:39] key difference is they that trust in the
[6:41] Lord shall be as Mount Zion which cannot
[6:43] be removed but abideth forever as the
[6:45] mountains are round about Jerusalem so
[6:47] the Lord is round about his people from
[6:49] hence forth even
[6:51] forever I I I I I share this because I
[6:54] want to make this point as where we were
[6:57] ending on Sunday and looking at being f
[6:59] founded upon a rock when you are founded
[7:01] upon a rock it makes you one with that
[7:03] rock and that this the storms the
[7:05] hurricane can only consolidate what's
[7:07] already in you and anything that can be
[7:09] taken away we want the winds to take it
[7:11] but we want anything that's settled to
[7:12] the Rock Lord Make Me sure and as we're
[7:15] emphasizing us building making our
[7:17] houses homes and uh being homebuilders
[7:20] as men and hom makers as sisters God
[7:22] gives us a promise of a positive outcome
[7:25] he he's round about those uh uh that
[7:28] fear him he's round about Jerusalem they
[7:30] that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount
[7:32] Zion and in First Peter excuse me second
[7:34] Peter chap
[7:36] 1:1 and this is tying into uh this
[7:40] obedience doing what you hear wherefore
[7:41] the rather Brethren give diligence to
[7:44] make your calling an election
[7:46] sure Jesus said that the man who built
[7:48] his house upon a rock dug
[7:51] deep and laid the foundation on a rock
[7:54] this is uh give diligence to make your
[7:56] calling an election sure for if you do
[7:59] these things
[8:00] you shall never fall if you continue if
[8:03] you're to back up just a little bit he's
[8:05] talking about that we've been given
[8:06] divine power and we can be partakers of
[8:09] these things through through his through
[8:12] his power and through his life he says
[8:13] give diligence to add to your faith and
[8:15] it begins to walk through add to your
[8:17] faith uh uh virtue and begins to take us
[8:20] through all those uh elements of the
[8:21] Statue of perfect man and so there's
[8:24] diligence diligence to grow diligence to
[8:26] increase it says give diligence to make
[8:29] your calling an election
[8:31] sure houses fall because they're not
[8:33] built on the right foundation houses
[8:36] fall when they're not built
[8:37] correctly and and houses will fall and
[8:40] our our structure will fall we could
[8:41] call it a house of cards because there's
[8:43] some pretense to it it's not built the
[8:45] right way it fall it falls when Builders
[8:47] aren't sure sure of the foundation and I
[8:50] think what how we were concluding on
[8:51] Sunday is they're not sure of where they
[8:53] stand and they're not proactive about
[8:55] things it says give diligence to make
[8:58] your calling your location your work
[9:00] what you're to do a calling to a
[9:02] particular position a calling to do a
[9:04] particular action if if you're a lady be
[9:06] a lady if your man be a man make your
[9:08] calling and election sure let me say
[9:10] this your calling and election are not
[9:13] uncertain it's your confidence in it it
[9:16] it's not confirming to God he made the
[9:18] right call or confirming to God that he
[9:20] made the right choice when electing you
[9:22] but to make your call in election sure
[9:24] is not from the standpoint of whether or
[9:25] not God has called you or elected you
[9:27] but it's your own confidence it's your
[9:29] own Revelation your own
[9:30] certainty because if you're not
[9:32] confident I I believe that God has
[9:34] called you and God has elected you and
[9:36] given you having elected you he's called
[9:38] you and you could do a really nice
[9:40] series on those two different concepts
[9:41] and even their differences and they're
[9:43] overlapping but it's not that God hasn't
[9:46] called you if something goes wrong it's
[9:49] not that You're Not Elected if the House
[9:50] of Cards Falls it's that you're not
[9:52] standing squarely you where you need to
[9:55] be and I think it's as uh CS Lewis might
[9:57] have said it that God wasn't me to play
[10:00] some game on me he he knew that I had a
[10:03] house of cards all along it was I that
[10:05] didn't know and so God tested me to show
[10:09] me where I was at and so the testing
[10:11] isn't to take away your election it
[10:13] isn't to take away your calling but it's
[10:15] for us to recognize man I'm a little off
[10:17] center here I'm not fully trusting in
[10:19] the foundation or I've built the house
[10:21] of cards on a really good foundation or
[10:24] I'm trying to build really really good
[10:26] without the right foundation maybe
[10:28] there's a lot of different uh choices it
[10:30] could be but this we've got to give
[10:32] diligence to make our call and an
[10:33] election sure but that has to do with
[10:35] our confidence in our foundation and our
[10:38] confidence in the work that's being
[10:41] done now Luke 6: 49 it says but he that
[10:44] heareth and doeth not is like a man that
[10:46] without a foundation built a house upon
[10:49] the Earth against which the stream did
[10:51] beat vehemently and immediately it fell
[10:54] and the ruin of that house was great
[10:56] there's something to be said about the
[10:58] fact that the wise man built upon a
[11:00] revelation he built upon a rock
[11:02] therefore having been founded upon a
[11:04] revelation he can say it's not me that
[11:05] does this but it's the spirit of God
[11:07] which is in me to Will and to do of his
[11:09] good pleasure because it's born from
[11:11] Revelation but then the one who here
[11:13] without a foundation builds upon the
[11:16] Earth the it's in the one of the things
[11:18] to point out is the fact that there's
[11:20] those that do many wonderful works but
[11:21] it was obviously in their flesh so when
[11:24] we build upon the Earth we build Upon
[11:26] Our Own carnal ideas our own carnal
[11:27] Works our own carnal
[11:29] uh you know discipline well it's all
[11:32] it's built on well I think I'm doing
[11:33] right I want to do good I want to I want
[11:35] to be a Christian I want to have many
[11:36] wonderful works and here someone's built
[11:39] on fleshly Works built on carnal things
[11:41] the stream will beat against it heavily
[11:43] hard and he says immediately it fell and
[11:46] the ruin was great and we could say this
[11:48] the house fell because of
[11:50] foolishness why do houses fall because
[11:53] of foolishness why do houses stand
[11:55] because of wisdom this house fell
[11:57] because of foolishness not taking heed
[12:00] to the word of God so there was a lack
[12:02] of awareness or what little awareness
[12:04] ever really stuck and said whoa we
[12:06] should probably do something about that
[12:08] or this is what the word of God says we
[12:10] need to act now so this house Falls
[12:13] because of foolishness in that it
[12:15] doesn't answer to the word of God it
[12:17] doesn't respond it doesn't react and do
[12:19] what the word of God is asking them to
[12:21] do Luke Chapter 12: 47 it's given this
[12:25] is kind of Jesus giving a principle
[12:27] after the parable uh of being watchful
[12:30] and your loins being GED about and your
[12:32] and your uh W your lights burning watch
[12:36] uh G yourself let your lights be burning
[12:39] it's this preparation it's this
[12:40] anticipation and expectation and he says
[12:43] that servant which knew his Lord's will
[12:46] and prepared not himself neither did
[12:48] according to his will shall be beaten
[12:50] with many stripes now I'm not
[12:52] threatening to give you a spanking and
[12:54] I'm not that wanting you to worry about
[12:55] a switch but it's the principle that the
[12:57] one that knows
[12:59] he knows the Lord's will he's heard
[13:01] God's word just as that one that the the
[13:04] foolish man hears the word of God but
[13:06] doesn't do it he builds his house upon
[13:08] the Earth so you know the will of the
[13:10] Lord and to know the will of the Lord
[13:11] and not do it that sin to know the word
[13:14] and to prepare not yourself that you
[13:17] suffer loss right says that servant will
[13:19] be beaten with many stripes there's a
[13:21] lot there you could get into in Luke
[13:22] chapter 12 to see more of this but to
[13:24] say he prepared not himself he didn't
[13:26] make the necessary preparations in get
[13:29] everything ready for his Lord's return
[13:31] uh to do as the Lord said that he ought
[13:33] to have done and this is where we're
[13:35] wanting to use this phrase of pro being
[13:37] proactive and may I don't know if it's a
[13:39] buzzword necessarily uh anymore they
[13:41] probably have a much better word so you
[13:42] corporate guys just let me know how I
[13:45] can upgrade uh to 2024 but it's to act
[13:48] in advance to deal with expected or
[13:51] anticipated difficulty that well if we
[13:54] get into this experience tells me that
[13:55] this may happen so let's do something
[13:57] now in anticip of the difficulty we know
[14:00] there's going to be trials ahead we know
[14:02] the enem is going to come in like a
[14:03] flood we know that these types of things
[14:05] happen so what can we do now to prepare
[14:08] for it when it does
[14:09] happen so a fool in this case the fool
[14:12] puts off the hard work finds a place
[14:15] where I could build there and doesn't
[14:16] worry about digging deep doesn't want to
[14:18] exert himself at the outset just wants
[14:19] to hurry up and get the house up so he
[14:21] can enjoy it the fool does not put in
[14:23] the hard work and if you say well what
[14:25] does this have to do with us it's a t
[14:27] human tendency to go take the shortcut
[14:30] or the easy way out it's the principle
[14:32] of least effort that it's just built
[14:35] within us that people naturally choose
[14:37] the path of least resistance we're kind
[14:39] of like water in that way that we're
[14:42] just going to go the easy route if
[14:43] there's a shortcut we want to take it
[14:45] that's why you could see on some
[14:47] campuses maybe in some neighborhoods or
[14:49] some parks there'll be a really nice
[14:51] expensive pathway and a sidewalk and
[14:53] nice pavers and it goes at a nice L and
[14:56] it angles this way it looks really
[14:58] really beautiful and there's a a lot of
[14:59] nice grass put in there and then you'll
[15:01] just see a path worn right through it
[15:03] why because people won't take the
[15:05] clearly defined uh uh paved route
[15:07] they'll take the shortcut because it's
[15:11] easier and that's the that's how we're
[15:13] all wired just as humans we're we're
[15:15] wired to go the take the shortcuts we're
[15:18] wired to go the easy route it's just a
[15:20] human tendency and and I I don't want to
[15:22] necessarily say that we're wired to be
[15:24] fools but maybe there's some truth to
[15:26] that Jesus says in Matthew 7: 13 and 14
[15:30] enter ye in enter ye in at the Straight
[15:33] Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is
[15:35] the way that leadth to destruction in
[15:38] many there be which goeth in there at
[15:41] why is it a lot of people go this way
[15:43] because it's easier it's broad it's more
[15:46] convenient it's more inviting but he
[15:48] says you've got to enter into that the
[15:50] Straight Gate and he says the Straight
[15:52] Gate is narrow it says narrow is the way
[15:54] which leadth unto life and few there be
[15:57] that find it so there is a Broadway
[16:00] there is a a shortcut there's something
[16:02] that's easier to navigate and that's
[16:05] going to tend to death and destruction
[16:07] corruption but then there's a harder way
[16:09] a more difficult way he calls it the
[16:11] Straight Gate and narrow path but that's
[16:13] the only way to find blessing it's the
[16:15] only way to find life and it says few
[16:17] find it and as reminded of the statement
[16:20] that that prophecy that was given to
[16:22] brother Bram in French it says because
[16:24] you have chosen the Narrow Path the
[16:26] harder way thou Hast walked of your your
[16:29] own choosing so let me say this uh the
[16:31] easy path is going to present itself and
[16:34] the momentum the flood as it were is
[16:35] going to push you that way if you just
[16:38] want to go with the crowd you want to do
[16:39] what everybody else is doing you want to
[16:40] do the easy thing it's just the momentum
[16:43] will carry you that way but you've got
[16:45] to make a choice to go the opposite way
[16:48] you've got to make that conscious Choice
[16:50] especially in the day and age we're
[16:51] living in and I'm not just talking about
[16:53] the world I'm not just talking about
[16:55] nominal religion I'm even talking about
[16:57] sometimes within the the social scene
[16:59] and the message theater that surrounds
[17:01] us everyone's wanting to do a certain
[17:03] thing or go a certain way and we have to
[17:05] make our own choice sometimes to choose
[17:08] the plain meaning of the message of the
[17:10] hour to choose the standard of the
[17:12] gospel and we might be swimming up
[17:14] stream and the social current but you've
[17:16] got to choose the harder way the narrow
[17:19] way because that's the only one that
[17:20] leads to
[17:22] life you've walked of your own choosing
[17:24] thou has picked the correct and precise
[17:26] decision and it is my way because of
[17:28] this momentous decision a huge portion
[17:30] of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious
[17:32] decision thou Hast made I know that that
[17:35] is very particular to brother brandom
[17:37] but I believe the principles in the
[17:38] scripture are the same for us that when
[17:41] we choose the right way it's usually the
[17:43] harder way it's not a shortcut it's not
[17:46] an easy path but when we have chose that
[17:48] God will bless us for it that it's a
[17:51] it's a it's a momentous decision anytime
[17:53] we choose to resist the pull of the
[17:56] world the flood of the social current
[17:58] and to do the the things that we know we
[17:59] ought to do as
[18:01] Believers and if I could say this I
[18:03] think I'm kind of maybe I think I'm
[18:04] seeding some things maybe for later this
[18:06] evening if we can get to it but to
[18:08] choose the harder way to take the the
[18:11] narrow way and straight As the gate to
[18:13] dig deep to lay the foundation uh all
[18:16] these things I'm talking about I'm using
[18:17] maybe a scriptural language and a
[18:18] message language I me just say it's
[18:21] difficult task these are hard things to
[18:23] do and so let me just make this point
[18:26] because I want to be very practical
[18:28] learning to
[18:30] communicate learning to say things that
[18:32] are hard to say but need to be said
[18:35] learning to say them in the right way
[18:36] communicating one with another being
[18:38] honest with each other learning to
[18:39] Humble ourselves this willingness to
[18:42] communicate this willingness to Humble
[18:43] ourselves learning to communicate
[18:45] learning to be humble this is why houses
[18:48] stand this is why houses fall is when we
[18:52] develop these very These Foolish habits
[18:55] uh that's when things can creep in and
[18:56] we become susceptible to storms
[18:59] these are the things that we could use
[19:01] in a scriptural language digging deep
[19:02] finding Bedrock building a foundation
[19:05] learning to communicate willing to
[19:06] Humble ourselves these are things that
[19:08] give strength to the house and guard
[19:09] against future
[19:11] failure
[19:14] amen I'm just going to start amening
[19:17] myself I need a little Dropbox here
[19:19] where I can just go and fire off an
[19:24] amen so laying a g a good
[19:27] foundation
[19:29] or building a house whether it be in the
[19:31] foundation or building there on requires
[19:32] hard
[19:33] work it's something that is requires
[19:37] hard work early on if I can put it this
[19:40] way it you have to be working during
[19:42] times of
[19:43] Peace during times of Peace that's when
[19:45] you work in times of War that's when you
[19:48] War it's in times of peace that you
[19:50] train it's in times of war that you
[19:52] fight and so there's laying a good
[19:54] foundation and building a house some of
[19:55] the principles we could say to so you
[19:57] can understand what we're pointing at it
[19:59] requires hard work early
[20:01] on and you can see yeah we're talking
[20:03] about practice we're talking about
[20:05] putting in the hard work not when it
[20:07] counts but in times of preparation you
[20:10] do it before the storm comes you you do
[20:13] it you do it before H uh uh things
[20:16] things get difficult in Proverbs chapter
[20:20] 28 it said we're not waiting till the
[20:22] Trouble Comes you're doing it in
[20:25] anticipation that you have an enemy and
[20:26] an adversary who's making do use of
[20:28] opportunity to find a weakness in a soft
[20:30] spot so you guard against the punch
[20:33] Proverbs 28: 19 he that tth his land
[20:36] shall have plenty of bread but he that
[20:39] followeth after vain persons shall have
[20:41] poverty enough it's a very simple
[20:43] proverb very simple principle that in
[20:45] order to have success in planting and
[20:48] growing and harvesting you have to till
[20:50] the land you can't just say well I got
[20:53] land I'm just going to throw some seed
[20:54] out there and expect to really yield
[20:56] what you should from those seeds you've
[20:58] got to till the land you've got to
[21:00] prepare the land you've got to get
[21:01] things out of it you've got to cultivate
[21:03] it you've got to dig it up and you've
[21:05] got to do the things necessary so that
[21:07] the sewing of seed can be successful he
[21:10] that tilth his land will have plenty of
[21:12] bread he that puts in the hard work long
[21:14] before the Harvest is the one who's not
[21:16] only going to have grain be able to make
[21:18] bread out of that grain see what the
[21:20] proverb is saying he that kills a land
[21:22] and does the work early on maybe even in
[21:24] the winter he's the one that'll enjoy
[21:27] the bread in in the coming winter but he
[21:29] that followeth after their vain person
[21:31] shall have poverty enough in Proverbs
[21:34] 21:25 the desire of the slothful kth him
[21:38] for his hands refuse to labor what a
[21:41] what a statement the desire of the
[21:43] slothful kth him for his hands refuse to
[21:48] labor because he's slothful he doesn't
[21:51] want to work what does he do but yet he
[21:53] still desires so he chases desire
[21:56] without true effort he he acquires
[21:59] things accumulates he does things
[22:00] without having a necessary Foundation to
[22:02] enjoy them to keep them the desire of
[22:06] the slothful will kill him this is
[22:08] coming back to how straight is the gate
[22:10] and narrows the way that leadth unto
[22:12] life there's a right way to live there's
[22:14] a white right way to be fruitful the
[22:17] desire of a slothful man will kill him
[22:19] because his hands refuse to labor I want
[22:22] to use that to emphasize this we need to
[22:24] be exerting greater effort in the
[22:26] beginning of something and in the
[22:28] Foundation to ensure the fitness of a of
[22:31] our home and our testimony in our lives
[22:33] in the time to come we've got to exert
[22:36] greater effort uh when when families are
[22:39] young that's when you do the really
[22:40] really hard work it's going to pay off
[22:41] later train up a child in the way that
[22:43] he should go don't wait till he's going
[22:46] to say now as you
[22:48] leave you got to do the work early on
[22:51] and I'm saying that if you're if there's
[22:53] a recognition now or an awareness now of
[22:55] anything do the work now don't put it
[22:58] off any more Proverbs 22: 3 and 4 a
[23:01] prudent man foresee the evil and hideth
[23:04] himself but the simple pass on and are
[23:06] punished that would be a foolish man The
[23:09] Prudent the wise the providential
[23:11] foresees the evil and hides himself in
[23:14] other words he sees it come and he
[23:16] doesn't become a Target he doesn't make
[23:18] it easier he does something to protect
[23:21] himself knowing the Evil's coming but
[23:23] the simple they don't regard it enough
[23:26] says they pass on they're punished
[23:29] by humility and the fear of the Lord are
[23:31] riches and honor and
[23:33] life if you want riches honor and life
[23:35] you have to anticipate by wisdom that
[23:38] what that's what wisdom does it
[23:39] anticipates it realizes something
[23:42] beforehand it and it's under
[23:44] expectation a a and and so it can be
[23:47] ahead of
[23:48] time and we said it this way on Sunday
[23:52] failure under pressure in a in a given
[23:54] moment when you fail it it's often the
[23:56] result of earlier poor effort not the
[23:58] the effort in the present it why did I
[24:00] fail now why did the house why is the
[24:02] house suffering so much difficulty now
[24:04] and say wow uh it's not that I I I don't
[24:07] want this to happen and I I want to get
[24:08] serious and I want things to be
[24:09] different say well this is the reason
[24:11] why things are hard right now is the
[24:13] storms are coming and it's not your lack
[24:16] of faith now it's you need to look and
[24:18] realize wow I'm suffering now for all
[24:21] the things I've swn before I haven't
[24:23] been faithful in cultivating the right
[24:25] things and that's not to cause us just
[24:27] to give up and say go ahead condemn it
[24:29] you know I I can't do this is to realize
[24:31] oh I'm only suffering now because
[24:33] certain things weren't done all I got to
[24:35] do is get that right and go on and I can
[24:38] weather the storm the next
[24:41] time a slothful man a foolish man a vain
[24:44] man these are all these things that keep
[24:46] being brought up and this may be a
[24:48] little bit different in terms of the
[24:49] emphasis but it's that wise versus
[24:51] foolish and in Proverbs 6: 6 to12 or
[24:55] maybe we'll just read to verse 11 it
[24:57] says go to the ant th
[24:58] sluggard consider her ways and be wise
[25:02] which having no guide overseer or ruler
[25:05] provideth her meat in the summer and
[25:07] gathereth her food in the Harvest I mean
[25:09] this is everyone's probably heard this
[25:11] scripture maybe some of the the young
[25:12] guys here heard it this morning uh learn
[25:15] from the ant thou Slugger thy slothful
[25:17] man who's trying to kill himself
[25:19] consider his ways get your example from
[25:21] The Ant And he says and use exercise
[25:24] wisdom that the ant is laboring it's
[25:27] working it provides meat and summer
[25:28] gathers food for the Harvest so it's
[25:30] eating in the summer but it's not eating
[25:32] everything it's not it's not exhausting
[25:34] itself it's providing for the
[25:36] future says how long wil thou sleep oh
[25:38] sluggard when wilt thou rise arise out
[25:41] of thy sleep get a little sleep a little
[25:43] Slumber Slumber little folding of the
[25:45] hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come
[25:48] as one that tra travelleth and thy want
[25:50] as an armed
[25:52] man yes it's talking about uh being lazy
[25:56] being slothful that as the ant is
[25:59] proactive it's creating or controlling a
[26:02] situation by causing something to happen
[26:05] rather than just responding to it after
[26:07] it's
[26:08] happened the ant knows the Winter's
[26:10] coming so it's going to it knows that
[26:13] there's no longer going to be things
[26:14] that are readily available so it it
[26:18] creates it controls the situation ahead
[26:21] of time so I can say it this way if
[26:23] we're going to be proactive we we we can
[26:25] control a situation or we can create
[26:28] certain things by causing doing other
[26:30] things in anticipation of what's going
[26:33] to come instead of just responding
[26:35] immediately to what's
[26:36] happening and here it's saying go to the
[26:39] ant thou sluggard it's talking about
[26:41] someone who's
[26:43] lazy help me tonight if it makes sense
[26:48] and your spirit can say Amen go ahead
[26:49] and give me forceful amens because I I'm
[26:52] trying to make sense tonight and I may
[26:54] not be doing it and I don't mind silence
[26:56] you you guys could just go just just do
[26:59] that to me like and I'll know be like
[27:01] okay wow I'm completely missing it right
[27:03] but if I get some amens then I'll you'll
[27:05] be the ones that I'll look at and I'll
[27:06] avoid everybody else who's
[27:09] going but basically when one has wisdom
[27:13] and acts accordingly willing to put in
[27:16] the hard work we're saying proactive I
[27:17] think that's a good word to use uh
[27:20] prudent providential uh uh they're
[27:22] they're they're motivated to work they
[27:24] see the need for it they want to act but
[27:26] the opposite of that is someone who's
[27:27] lazy
[27:29] and only acts when they're forced
[27:32] to this is what is the image of the ant
[27:34] the ant is eaten in the summer but not
[27:36] just eating for the summer it's storing
[27:38] up things and Gathering food in the
[27:40] Harvest knowing that there's going to be
[27:41] a winter and things are going to be
[27:43] available but what happens the opposite
[27:45] of that is someone who's just enjoying
[27:46] the summer enjoying the summer and then
[27:48] the winter comes around and there's a
[27:49] fam it's like oh I need to do something
[27:51] I need to do
[27:53] something we when we procrastinate what
[27:56] ends up happening is
[27:59] we will finally act when it's absolutely
[28:02] necessary when we're forced to but a
[28:05] wise person sees the need or the danger
[28:07] and does things ahead of time controls
[28:09] the situation is already uh uh doing
[28:12] something in the moment saying you know
[28:13] what this is going to happen so I want
[28:14] to save against that
[28:16] time in Proverbs 18: 9 and 10 he also
[28:21] that is slothful in his work is brother
[28:23] to him that is a great
[28:25] waster just love the phrases of the
[28:27] scripture
[28:28] your brother to him that is a great
[28:30] waser now can you this would be a good
[28:32] subject maybe to throw out there to uh
[28:35] uh you know breakout session what does
[28:36] this mean but it's saying he that's lazy
[28:39] and doesn't want to work is no different
[28:40] than the guy who works hard but doesn't
[28:42] know how to or gathers a lot but waste
[28:44] it the one that Wast resources and waste
[28:48] what he has maybe he's a hard worker a
[28:50] and so because of that he gathers a lot
[28:52] of things but he's foolish with what he
[28:53] has he doesn't have wisdom with what he
[28:56] gets he's bad
[28:58] and the guy who doesn't work and has
[29:00] nothing they're Brothers maybe twin
[29:02] brothers CU a man that is slothful in
[29:04] his work is brother to him that is a
[29:06] great waster but then the the next verse
[29:10] is so awesome the name of the Lord is a
[29:11] strong tower the righteous run into it
[29:13] and is safe there's the wisdom there's
[29:16] the righteousness trusted in the Lord he
[29:18] realizes I will hide in the Lord that
[29:21] all my work and my effort doesn't make
[29:22] me righteous and what I acquire doesn't
[29:24] make me righteous but I'm trusted in the
[29:26] Lord who preserves the one who blesses
[29:28] by all all good things come from him so
[29:31] it's he who acts out of trust in the
[29:33] Lord he will be blessed he'll find life
[29:35] but the slothful he's not going to work
[29:37] and he's going to end up in ruin and
[29:39] even the foolish though he labors if he
[29:42] doesn't labor correctly he Wast whatever
[29:44] he gives there's a lot of principles we
[29:47] could use in terms of financial
[29:49] discipline and those things and and
[29:51] financial problems causes houses to
[29:54] Fall by not working or not having wisdom
[29:57] with what you
[30:00] acquire but I wanting you to think of it
[30:02] in terms of being
[30:05] proactive the example of these two
[30:07] houses that Jesus gives and the one who
[30:10] had the foundation on a rock the other
[30:11] one who built upon the sand of the
[30:13] earth these two houses these two
[30:16] structures and their lack of foundation
[30:18] and their Foundation it per personifies
[30:21] the wise or the righteous or the foolish
[30:25] and the wicked when you look at it in
[30:27] those terms you realize that we could
[30:29] you could look at scriptures you could
[30:30] look look at teaching you could look at
[30:32] principles that apply to the wise and
[30:34] it's going to come down to these very
[30:35] same principles that one who hears and
[30:38] does he's a wise man he that hears and
[30:40] does is a righteous man he does right
[30:42] hears the word of the Lord and does the
[30:43] will of the Lord he that hears and
[30:45] doesn't do he's foolish what does he do
[30:46] he does sin he does iniquity he's wicked
[30:49] and so the wise man we see in the
[30:51] scripture he's prudent The Prudent man
[30:54] foresees the evil and prepares the
[30:56] foolish one does not prepare the foolish
[30:59] servant was the one that knew the
[31:01] Master's will and prepared not
[31:04] himself as if they had never
[31:06] seen the wise man sees and prepares the
[31:09] foolish man he can know it but he
[31:11] doesn't do anything like wait you knew
[31:13] that was going to happen yeah I knew it
[31:15] was going to happen why didn't you do
[31:16] anything
[31:18] well in Proverbs chap 10: 24 and
[31:22] 25 says the fear of the wicked it shall
[31:25] come upon him but the desire of the
[31:27] right righteous shall be
[31:29] granted the fear of the wicked shall
[31:31] come upon him now we know that there's a
[31:33] tremendous principle when it comes to
[31:35] fear that fear can create and fear the
[31:38] very thing that job feared Came Upon him
[31:40] but job was not Wicked so there's a
[31:43] there's a contrast an example here where
[31:45] we're not just trying to say anybody has
[31:46] fear you're going to get what's coming
[31:47] to you but the wicked if we can use them
[31:50] in the same vein as a fool the one who
[31:52] knows better but doesn't do it the one
[31:54] who hears the word of God that says if
[31:56] you don't do this this is going to
[31:58] happen like if I don't do this this is
[32:01] going to
[32:02] happen and they're like oh no that could
[32:06] happen and it
[32:08] happens right because the fear of the
[32:11] wicked it comes upon him but the desire
[32:14] of the righteous shall be granted what a
[32:15] what a powerful uh oppos opposites there
[32:18] the fear of the wicked it comes upon him
[32:20] he the foolish does not prepare even if
[32:23] he knows it's coming even if he saw it
[32:25] coming he acts as if he never saw
[32:28] therefore the fear of the wicked it
[32:29] comes upon him but the desire of the
[32:30] righteous the wise it shall be granted
[32:33] as the Whirlwind passeth so is the
[32:35] wicked no more but the righteous is in
[32:37] an everlasting
[32:39] Foundation the wicked can
[32:41] anticipate the the wicked can in many
[32:44] situations recognize this is needful or
[32:46] we need to do this and hears enough and
[32:49] understands enough but they do nothing
[32:51] in the moment to address
[32:52] it they don't respond accordingly the
[32:56] word of God comes forth and the one who
[32:57] who hears and does is like a man who
[32:59] builds his house upon a rock and when
[33:01] the rains and floods and winds come it
[33:04] survives it doesn't fall because he
[33:06] built his house upon a rock in response
[33:09] to the word of God so that just becomes
[33:11] an analogy to describe anytime that
[33:13] someone hears the word of God and has
[33:15] been told some principle that if you
[33:18] obey you'll survive a coming test but if
[33:21] you don't you're going to fail it's that
[33:24] principle of obedience to the word of
[33:26] God secures us and gives us confidence
[33:28] in a time of trouble and so if someone
[33:30] hears and doesn't respond they're not
[33:32] doing what they need to do in that
[33:34] moment despite the fact that they ought
[33:36] to know a wind is
[33:41] coming so the Wicked the foolish can
[33:44] know but they don't do anything to
[33:47] change and if I could say this the right
[33:50] foundation we've been talking about
[33:51] laying a good foundation we're talking
[33:52] about building a house and turning our
[33:54] houses into home being a house of the
[33:55] Lord ourselves our families and this
[33:57] church church we got to use wisdom to
[33:59] avoid
[34:00] problems rather than just reacting to
[34:03] them in the
[34:05] moment to be reactive it's to act after
[34:08] some stimulus or in instigation some
[34:12] something stimulates you and that's a
[34:14] response we might call it a a
[34:16] reflex to act after some something has
[34:18] happened and something has
[34:20] occurred and in that moment when you
[34:22] react to something you're you're
[34:24] suddenly responding in a way I want to
[34:26] make a difference between those words uh
[34:28] just to teach something it's just it's
[34:29] not just semantics but when you're
[34:32] reactive you can you you in that moment
[34:34] you take action to mitigate damage oh I
[34:37] need to do this so that things don't go
[34:38] out get out of control I need to
[34:40] mitigate damage or I need to start
[34:41] repairing damage you see the the tree
[34:43] has fall and the tree falls and it hits
[34:45] the fence and if you don't bolst up the
[34:46] fence it's going to hit the Tesla and
[34:47] you're all of a sudden responding in the
[34:49] moment to make sure I need to fix this I
[34:51] need to do this we need to do that and
[34:52] you're trying to hold something back
[34:54] you're trying to fix something in the
[34:56] moment so you're reacting to to it but I
[34:59] want to say this be proactive not
[35:02] reactive in other words you should in
[35:04] initiate change or Implement change
[35:08] rather than just react to an
[35:10] event put it this way events will come
[35:13] storms will come troubles will come well
[35:15] what does the word of God teach us now
[35:17] in the message of the hour in the
[35:18] scripture what do we know according to
[35:20] the word of God things that we could be
[35:22] doing now as Christians and message
[35:24] Believers in our homes in our own
[35:25] personal lives what are things that I
[35:27] should be doing now that can become a
[35:29] defense for me when the storm comes
[35:32] instead of once it starts getting windy
[35:34] go H I should probably
[35:37] pray right I I I haven't done it or run
[35:41] this the data but I I you wonder
[35:43] sometimes how many people start getting
[35:45] faithful to things in church whenever
[35:47] things are going bad and it's like I've
[35:49] seen you four services in a row rough
[35:51] time right never see you otherwise and
[35:54] you just begin to wonder hey what is
[35:56] going on they're trying to they're
[35:57] trying to dig deep and find foundation
[35:59] so there's nothing wrong with that but a
[36:01] lot of times what's happens we reacting
[36:02] in the
[36:04] moment rather than implementing change
[36:07] beforehand act in advance to deal with
[36:10] expected difficulty say well I'm not
[36:12] expecting difficulty difficult coming
[36:14] difficult is coming right it's going to
[36:17] be hard Saints right so we got to do
[36:20] what load up our
[36:23] GS it's
[36:25] failure failure to anticipate at failure
[36:29] to act wisely in the moment is what
[36:30] results in
[36:31] problems when you don't prepare yourself
[36:34] it increases pressure when the pressure
[36:36] comes we're going to suffer pressure
[36:38] we're going to suffer stress there's
[36:39] going to be difficulties but when you
[36:41] fail to anticipate when you can
[36:43] anticipate but don't act wisely that's
[36:45] what really causes problems to be
[36:47] worse I I think I just want to say it
[36:50] this way that's what makes pressure
[36:53] problems that's what makes trouble uh uh
[36:56] catastrophes other the pressure is going
[36:58] to come The Temptations are going to
[36:59] come the rain's going to come the
[37:00] flood's going to come the winds are
[37:02] going to come and it but that's when we
[37:04] haven't acted wisely it's when we
[37:06] haven't prepared that those things cause
[37:09] failure inaction opens up an opportunity
[37:12] for
[37:13] error opens up an occasion uh for
[37:16] something to go wrong for something to
[37:18] get out out of Center and so when we
[37:20] haven't acted beforehand it gives an
[37:23] opportunity for TR for uh for failure
[37:26] and then that's what we re react
[37:28] to I hope this is making some sense you
[37:31] know I've got my little notes here just
[37:32] to know the things that I want to say
[37:34] and and it press upon but I'm willing
[37:36] just to keep laboring on a particular
[37:38] point until we get it if you if you God
[37:41] gives you wisdom and you prepare
[37:43] yourself the trouble's still
[37:45] coming right the Bible tells us in this
[37:48] Parable the storm came to the wise men
[37:50] just as it did the foolish man but when
[37:52] the storm came and the wise man was in
[37:54] his house he just gathered his family
[37:56] together and says don't
[37:58] worry this is why it took me so long to
[38:00] build the house and the kids are like
[38:02] I'm sorry for getting mad that it took
[38:04] so long and the wife's like honey you
[38:05] did the right thing I know you wanted to
[38:07] hurry up and she was always saying well
[38:08] the neighbors built right away they're
[38:10] already in their house right and
[38:13] meanwhile in the neighbor's house
[38:14] right's like oh my goodness son hold up
[38:17] that wall honey go get a bucket we got
[38:18] to get the water and everyone's
[38:19] panicking in the moment and they're
[38:21] worried about their house that's good
[38:23] but they are reacting in the moment to
[38:26] the storm
[38:28] and the reality is they probably haven't
[38:30] put in the work necessary to keep some
[38:33] difficulty from causing a
[38:35] problem and if I could say this this is
[38:38] where it gets really really practical I
[38:39] just didn't no other way know any other
[38:41] way to do this than just to maybe dial
[38:45] it down and just say
[38:47] it but when we're reactive that's when
[38:49] we tend to be more
[38:52] extreme when we're reactive we tend to
[38:54] be a little bit more emotional or
[38:55] knee-jerk
[38:58] and and as a result more
[39:00] regretful when we've planned ahead of
[39:02] time and we know there's trouble coming
[39:06] and if I could just use the analogy of
[39:07] cooking a dinner say well we we're
[39:09] expecting uh 100 guests so we need to
[39:11] make sure we have enough meat and does
[39:12] this work does that work and and you
[39:14] plan you have contingencies you make
[39:16] sure things are and so that whenever you
[39:18] realize we're running out of this is
[39:19] said don't worry just do this don't
[39:21] worry just do that you kind of respond
[39:22] in the moment based upon your
[39:24] preparation but if if you gotten to that
[39:27] point
[39:28] and you didn't plan correctly then
[39:30] that's when the pressure comes on and
[39:32] that's when you tend to act a little bit
[39:33] more emotional a little bit more
[39:34] knee-jerk more and it's those actions in
[39:37] that moment that become very
[39:40] regretful if you're if you're not
[39:42] proactive you'll most likely be
[39:45] impulsive so be proactive not reactive
[39:48] plan don't
[39:50] panic words if you have a plan you stick
[39:52] to the plan you don't panic to be
[39:55] impulsive is to respond to or to deal
[39:58] with difficulty without
[40:00] preparation if you're impulsive you
[40:02] respond to a difficulty without
[40:04] preparation you deal with the difficulty
[40:06] or wrong without preparation it's like
[40:09] whoa whoa what's going on this is wrong
[40:11] this shouldn't happen and you respond to
[40:14] it you're impulsive and when we're
[40:16] impulsive I said when we're when we're
[40:18] reactive we begin to be emotional kind
[40:20] of knee-jerk uh when we're impulsive we
[40:23] we tend to
[40:25] overreact and it's the overreact re
[40:27] action that I can say this about
[40:28] leadership impulsive leadership reactive
[40:30] leadership tends to
[40:32] overcorrect comes down way too hard way
[40:34] too harsh because there's no established
[40:37] parameters there was no expectation in
[40:40] terms of the way things we would expect
[40:42] things to play out and this is where it
[40:43] gets very very practical in our own
[40:45] individual relationships our
[40:46] accountability to one another the
[40:47] boundaries that we set in life and the
[40:49] way that we navigate even our home life
[40:52] when we're just reacting in the moment
[40:53] to whatever comes up that leads to a
[40:55] very negative dynamic very emotional
[40:58] reactive impulsive and so we let
[41:01] something happen and then we gets to a
[41:02] point where it's crisis mode and there's
[41:04] a problem when we're reactive or
[41:06] impulsive we can get extreme and then we
[41:10] overcorrect because beforehand we hadn't
[41:13] established some sort of guideline of
[41:15] what to do when that happens it's like
[41:18] what in the world are you talking about
[41:23] well let's just say that you
[41:30] your child ask you if they can go out
[41:32] with their
[41:34] friend and you say yeah you can go
[41:37] out and you never
[41:40] establish any other means of
[41:42] communication or parameters so when they
[41:44] get back at 3:00 in the morning you're
[41:46] like why' you do this why what what's
[41:49] happening and and there's a you're never
[41:51] going out again right you're grounded
[41:54] from your friends for the rest of your
[41:55] life and you respond in the moment very
[41:59] intense and very reactive because what
[42:03] are you to do you never set any
[42:06] expectations for the child's obedience
[42:08] or Disobedience and you yourself are
[42:10] responding the moment I never for a
[42:12] moment thought that they wouldn't come
[42:14] home after midnight it's like
[42:16] well maybe you should think about that
[42:19] maybe you should begin to run run
[42:21] through your mind these different
[42:23] scenarios that you say you establish
[42:25] ahead of time you can go out but I need
[42:27] need you home by a certain time and if
[42:28] you're not home by a certain time these
[42:30] are the consequences so that when they
[42:32] don't come home by a certain time it's
[42:33] like consequence right there's no fight
[42:37] shouldn't be no argument you knew ahead
[42:39] of time like well I didn't know you were
[42:41] serious you're a fool
[42:44] right right cuz you knew ahead of time
[42:47] that's right I told you ahead of time go
[42:49] to thou Slugger your brother to a great
[42:52] waster and and that you realize in that
[42:55] moment yes I've I've I've said my my
[42:58] children up for success by telling them
[43:00] what I expect and what the consequences
[43:02] are if they obey or if they disobey and
[43:04] I've done myself a lot of good by
[43:07] anticipating in doing some hard work in
[43:09] the beginning to have conversations and
[43:10] to think about consequences and and
[43:12] think about what what's happening I can
[43:14] say this just looking out upon the
[43:16] congregation a lot of us are in the same
[43:18] place in life where when you've got kids
[43:20] that are zero uh two days to 12 12 years
[43:23] old there's a lot of things you can
[43:25] control but once they start getting
[43:26] older there's a lot of things they have
[43:27] access to a lot of things they even need
[43:30] and you've got to be anticipating what
[43:32] the difficulties might be around
[43:34] that you buy your child a
[43:37] phone and then issues arise and in your
[43:40] anger you take this iPhone 16 Pro Max
[43:43] and you throw it on the ground because
[43:45] you caught them doing something you
[43:46] didn't want them to do they weren't
[43:48] obedient in the moment you you trash the
[43:49] phone because beforehand you didn't say
[43:52] we're going to buy you this phone these
[43:53] are the terms of use this is how you can
[43:56] use it this is what we want you to do
[43:57] within our home and if at any point you
[43:59] don't honor that these are the
[44:01] consequences that's right you don't have
[44:04] to react in the moment to completely
[44:05] abolish
[44:07] something when that happens typically if
[44:10] I can put it this way you're impulsive
[44:12] you're reactive you're caught up in the
[44:13] moment and this is this is why houses
[44:17] fall and I don't mean divorce and kids
[44:19] leave and you never see your children
[44:21] again but let me just say if you have a
[44:22] lot of negative uh toxic behaviors
[44:25] within your home you haven't set up
[44:27] boundaries and you haven't found ways to
[44:28] show love yeah it can happen in a really
[44:31] really bad way where it all falls
[44:37] apart but typically when you're
[44:39] impulsive or reactive you're not really
[44:41] addressing the issue you're just
[44:44] handling the the the symptoms you're
[44:47] just dealing with
[44:48] Fallout and in your overcorrection you
[44:51] just go from one error to
[44:53] another you didn't establish parameters
[44:55] so you you gave them a ditch that they
[44:57] could fall into uh and and I know maybe
[45:00] I'm being I'm focusing more on raising
[45:02] children uh
[45:04] and and I think that's just a really
[45:06] good place to hit it and then we can
[45:07] think about other ways it can apply in
[45:09] our lives but when you haven't you
[45:11] haven't given clear direction or you
[45:13] haven't done the hard work in the
[45:15] beginning of what does this look like
[45:16] what are the potential problems what
[45:18] does the word of God say how can we do
[45:20] these things you provide a ditch for
[45:21] them to get into but sometimes what we
[45:23] do and we jerk them out we just throw
[45:24] them right into another we find another
[45:26] ditch because now we've grounded them
[45:28] from everything we've thrown this away
[45:29] we've done this we've done that and it
[45:31] creates a real costic negative
[45:34] environment go from one error to
[45:37] another you you you buy something or you
[45:40] allow for something then we start
[45:41] threatening that we're going to take it
[45:42] away we're going to ground
[45:44] them and and that's impulse knee-jerk
[45:47] type of
[45:49] parenting when we're reactive we're not
[45:51] considering maybe something we should
[45:55] have done before
[45:57] hand or not even considering the real
[46:00] cause like what was the source of the
[46:02] problem
[46:04] why why did my child do this and you
[46:07] could ask yourself well I didn't control
[46:10] for the fact that maybe an 18-year-old
[46:12] going out with his friends would want to
[46:14] stay out as late as he
[46:16] wants and to tell him be home by such
[46:19] time now if that doesn't matter in your
[46:21] family you don't have curfew or whatever
[46:22] I mean I'm not trying to impose some
[46:24] sort of curfew I hope I was ambiguous
[46:26] enough let's just say a child of a
[46:28] certain age stays out to a certain time
[46:29] that we well brother Aaron said I could
[46:31] stay till 3: in the morning or brother
[46:33] Aaron says we have to be back at 10:
[46:34] you're the Pastors in your home don't
[46:36] ask me what curfew should be but there's
[46:39] uh it's the principle of consequence and
[46:42] and expect expectations and and watching
[46:44] out over your children and being that
[46:46] Holy Ghost that we we ought to be to our
[46:48] children and guiding them correctly when
[46:50] we just uh respond to something and
[46:52] we're reacting to something we haven't
[46:54] appropriately thought well what would
[46:57] they be doing in this situation and
[46:59] because we haven't thought about that it
[47:01] this confrontation happens and things
[47:03] start to get a little bit out of
[47:05] control and when that happens you're not
[47:07] ever really dealing with the fact that
[47:09] you ex there was a curfew or that there
[47:11] was Disobedience you begin to deal with
[47:13] the interaction that you have with the
[47:15] individual you just deal with the
[47:17] Fallout and the symptoms not the actual
[47:19] problem and days later you're arguing
[47:21] about what time they got home instead of
[47:24] the problem to begin with
[47:27] in Proverbs 18: 18 excuse me Proverbs
[47:32] 11: 18 and
[47:36] 19 I'm not going to be able to finish
[47:39] some things here but I I was wanting to
[47:41] read in Proverbs 11 later or earlier on
[47:44] in this when it this chapter begins with
[47:46] the false balances and Abomination to
[47:48] the
[47:49] Lord and it's talk about the Integrity
[47:51] of the upright shall guide them but the
[47:54] perverseness of transgressor shall def
[47:56] uh destroy
[47:57] them this is this this building
[48:01] principles in chapter 11 is things that
[48:03] are right they are the way that they
[48:05] ought to be there's no pretense there's
[48:07] no there's no deceit a false balance is
[48:10] an Abomination to the Lord but a just
[48:12] weight is his Delight Integrity of the
[48:15] upright will guide them if you're
[48:16] upright if you're wise Integrity is what
[48:18] guides us but the wicked by his own
[48:22] wickedness he's perverse it destroys
[48:25] them the righteousness of the perfect
[48:28] shall direct his way the righteous are
[48:30] delivered from Death the righteousness
[48:33] of the upright shall deliver them
[48:34] there's this this if you go back and
[48:35] read through verse 11 there's a lot that
[48:37] this is built on but it says the wicked
[48:39] worketh a deceit but to him that Seth
[48:42] righteousness shall be a sure
[48:44] reward as righteousness tendeth to life
[48:48] so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to
[48:51] his own
[48:53] death as we try to use that ification of
[48:57] wise and foolish righteous and wicked
[49:00] the Wicked the foolish Works a deceitful
[49:03] work it's that house of cards it's the
[49:06] pretense oh look at that nice house it's
[49:08] not on a rock it's not going to last no
[49:11] matter how beautiful is it it's not
[49:13] built to last no matter how inviting it
[49:14] might seem to be there's no life there
[49:16] in it's just destruction they're going
[49:17] to be starting all over but a righteous
[49:19] person SS and labors and works and he's
[49:22] going to get a sure reward righteousness
[49:25] wisdom doing the hard work all these
[49:28] things that we're using in the sense of
[49:29] being proactive not reactive that res
[49:32] tends to life but he that pursues evil
[49:36] is impulsive and overreacts and
[49:38] overcorrects and in the moment gets
[49:40] caught up in the emotions because
[49:41] they're just being reactive they're
[49:43] pursuing that's foolishness and it
[49:44] results in
[49:46] loss so wisdom reacts but let me put it
[49:50] this way wisdom all wisdom is proactive
[49:54] but it's also re it's it it's it's not
[49:56] reactive it's responsive and I'm I know
[49:58] this may seem like oh this is just some
[50:00] psycho Babble but it I labored very a
[50:02] lot years ago when I preached on this I
[50:04] labored a lot just to be able to convey
[50:06] it through terminology to catch the
[50:07] meaning of a lot of scripture and a lot
[50:09] of quotes that wisdom is anticipating
[50:13] Prudence is anticipating in doing the
[50:15] hard work now to avoid problems later
[50:19] that's being proactive foolishness is no
[50:22] one you need to do the work and when the
[50:24] storm comes reacting in the moment
[50:27] now it wouldn't be wise to have had
[50:29] wisdom and planned and heard different
[50:31] things and then things begin to change
[50:33] and circumstances change and not respond
[50:37] to a changing
[50:38] landscape to not respond say well it was
[50:41] yeah well they were 10 years old and
[50:43] they did this and it's fine well they're
[50:44] not 10 years old anymore right oh oh
[50:47] they grew up that way they were always
[50:49] doing that oh they're like best friends
[50:50] a boy and a girl oh they're just best
[50:52] friends they grew up together and now at
[50:54] 17 18 years old you want them to just
[50:56] keep doing the same things they did when
[50:57] they're seven or eight wait a minute
[51:00] time out you wisdom says you need to
[51:03] respond sometimes when circumstances
[51:06] change so what wisdom does is it's it
[51:09] responds so I say be responsive not
[51:12] reactive very dangerous to be reactive
[51:15] to a
[51:16] storm to respond in the moment in a
[51:19] panic but it's not wrong to respond when
[51:21] you need to if I could put it this way
[51:24] reactive is the negative emot
[51:27] emotional uh response the negative
[51:30] approach or the negative actions to a
[51:32] situation so it's something that's
[51:34] negative something that's harsh
[51:35] something that's overreactive or
[51:36] impulsive that would say that's being
[51:38] reactive but being responsive would be
[51:40] your
[51:41] positive uh uh spiritual wise actions to
[51:45] a
[51:46] situation and I would I I would argue
[51:49] this as I try to find a stopping point
[51:51] our ability to to respond and not react
[51:55] largely depends upon our
[51:57] planning largely depends upon our
[52:00] preparation then in the moment you say
[52:02] oh I knew this might happen so I need to
[52:05] respond so when we say wisdom and being
[52:08] proactive it doesn't mean you won't have
[52:09] to act in the moment to do something but
[52:12] in the moment you can respond instead of
[52:14] just react it doesn't buy yourself some
[52:17] future laziness it just buys you some
[52:19] future rest buys you some future
[52:22] confidence I put in the work when the
[52:24] time comes I may have to act I may have
[52:27] to respond but I'm not going to be
[52:29] overreacting I'm not going to be
[52:30] knee-jerk I'm not going to be impulsive
[52:32] I'm not going to be emotional I'm going
[52:33] to be able to respond because I've
[52:35] planned I've
[52:37] prepared in Proverbs 10: 1-6 a wise son
[52:40] maketh a glad father but a foolish son
[52:43] is the heaviness of his
[52:45] mother so the the wise son makes a glad
[52:48] father but a foolish son makes a sad
[52:51] mother cuz the father's going like it's
[52:53] not my fault you're the one responsible
[52:56] for for the kids which is not right A
[52:59] wise son maketh a glad father but a
[53:01] foolish son is the heaviness of his
[53:02] mother Treasures of wickedness profit
[53:05] nothing but righteousness
[53:08] deliverthat scripture right there the
[53:11] Lord will not suffer the soul of the
[53:12] righteous to famish but he casteth away
[53:14] the substance of the wicked is that not
[53:17] what we see even in the parable of the
[53:18] wise men building on a rock and the
[53:20] foolish man who built upon the Earth God
[53:22] says if you do what I say it'll preserve
[53:24] you but if you don't you're going to
[53:25] lose things it'll be caused to be wasted
[53:28] away the Whirlwind will pass and the
[53:30] wicked will lose but the righteous is on
[53:32] an everlasting Foundation he becometh
[53:35] poor that dealth with a slack hand but
[53:37] the hand of the diligent maketh Rich he
[53:40] that gathereth in summer is a wise son
[53:42] but he that sleepeth in Harvest is a son
[53:44] that causeth shame blessings are upon
[53:46] the head of the just but violence cover
[53:48] the mouth of the
[53:50] wicked it speaks to the the how the
[53:54] upright and the righteous are willing
[53:57] they're willing to work they're willing
[53:59] to do good they're willing to
[54:02] labor they're willing to do the things
[54:05] that are necessary for Spiritual success
[54:07] they're willing to do things necessary
[54:08] to see that no evil will come nigh their
[54:10] dwelling it's not just knowing that
[54:13] there's evil out there and then when the
[54:15] evil comes say well we need to fight
[54:16] this devil we need to fight this devil
[54:19] it's doing the right things to know that
[54:21] when the fight comes you're prepared for
[54:22] the
[54:24] fight but we become poor we become
[54:26] destitute we Cast Away we lose we're
[54:29] deprived of substance when we deal when
[54:31] we act
[54:34] foolishly and this is where some of
[54:37] these statements when it says who shall
[54:38] abide in my Tabernacle he that walks
[54:41] uprightly who works righteousness and
[54:43] speaks truth he doesn't backbite with
[54:45] his tongue he doesn't do evil to his
[54:47] neighbor he doesn't take up a reproach
[54:49] against his
[54:50] neighbor who who when he swears to his
[54:53] own hurt he doesn't
[54:55] change and in Psalms 15 1:5 it's going
[54:59] through all these things that have to do
[55:00] with Integrity with wisdom how we use
[55:03] our mouth how we use our words how we
[55:04] treat one another and it says he that
[55:06] doeth these things shall never be
[55:09] moved if you want to be strong during a
[55:12] difficult time live correctly during the
[55:15] good times if you want to if you want to
[55:17] survive in a time of War be good in a
[55:20] time of Peace if you want to be able to
[55:23] overcome the enemy in a time of
[55:24] Temptation live holy
[55:27] and write and do the hard things and
[55:28] live live close to God and serve one
[55:30] another in times of
[55:34] feasting be
[55:36] humble and so if I'm if I'm wanting to
[55:39] teach you tonight that as a Christian we
[55:41] ought to be wise in other words be be
[55:44] res uh to be proactive not just reactive
[55:46] kneejerk impulsive where we overcorrect
[55:49] we get real harsh we say and do things
[55:51] that just complicate things but then I
[55:54] don't I do want you to also respond
[55:57] in situations being responsive requires
[56:00] humility well let me say this it
[56:02] requires
[56:03] honesty like ah we need to respond to
[56:06] this I'm not just going to dig in my
[56:08] heels and say but we're a righteous
[56:09] family we've done everything we need to
[56:11] we built the right
[56:12] foundation no chances are it's
[56:16] not if you get a little hotti or
[56:19] arrogant because to be responsive we
[56:21] have to be honest there's a
[56:23] need and I need the humility to respond
[56:26] the honesty is to recognize that the
[56:28] humility is to take care of it you know
[56:31] what things aren't the way maybe I
[56:33] thought they were so I need to respond
[56:35] to this in no way would I want you to
[56:37] take these things I'm saying about being
[56:38] proactive to where you do what you ought
[56:40] to do and in the moment where it looks
[56:42] like things are falling apart you just
[56:43] go well my hands are tied brother Aaron
[56:45] said what I did yesterday is going to
[56:46] determine what happens today so I guess
[56:48] I just need to let the cards fall where
[56:49] they do no that's not what I'm saying
[56:52] that's not what the Bible says if you
[56:54] thought you did what you should have
[56:55] done the day before before and you were
[56:56] sincere but it didn't prepare you for
[56:58] what's happening in that moment prove
[57:00] you're not a fool and respond
[57:05] wisely that's where the Heathen knows
[57:07] and rages he doesn't realize he needs to
[57:10] react
[57:11] differently and I could say I'll say
[57:14] this the
[57:16] response our response in crisis is going
[57:19] to determine how we get through
[57:21] it when we're going through it when
[57:23] you're going through the store when
[57:24] things are happening when there's
[57:25] difficulty when there's
[57:26] misunderstandings when there's
[57:27] backsliding when there's sin at your
[57:28] door your response is going to determine
[57:31] whether this this temptation this battle
[57:34] resolves in Victory resolves in gain or
[57:37] whether this conflict is even resolved
[57:39] at all or
[57:40] escalated when the enemy comes like in
[57:42] in like a flood our response is going to
[57:44] determine whether or not we get swashed
[57:46] away or whether we
[57:48] stand and your response is going to
[57:50] determine whether or not we can find a
[57:51] way to resolve it ultimately or it just
[57:53] gets
[57:55] worse and that's where I say there's a
[57:57] difference
[57:58] between responding to a situation which
[58:01] means we're going to address this need
[58:03] and confronting a situation we all know
[58:06] the difference
[58:08] right if you say well I've never thought
[58:10] of it that way there's a difference when
[58:11] someone wants to address something
[58:13] that's not right and when someone
[58:15] confronts something that's not right
[58:17] it's a huge difference between
[58:19] confronting a problem and addressing it
[58:21] and I'm not just saying by terminology
[58:23] when you confront something you meet it
[58:25] h hosti you meet with hos hostility or
[58:29] argumented of intent to face with
[58:33] Defiance or hostility there's this anger
[58:37] there's this disappointment this
[58:39] displeasure typically when we confront
[58:41] something we're probably trying to shame
[58:43] the person who's who's made us upset or
[58:45] did something wrong but when you address
[58:47] something the word to address means to
[58:49] guide to aim or
[58:51] direct the righteous shall be delivered
[58:55] from difficulty the righteous shall
[58:57] direct his way the Integrity of the
[58:58] upright shall guide him the righteous
[59:00] the wise address a situation where they
[59:03] guide they aim or direct it means to go
[59:04] straight toward to set right or to make
[59:07] straight our reactions escalate our
[59:10] conflicts to where now we're no longer
[59:12] discussing what happened but how we
[59:15] responded to what
[59:17] happened this I think this characterizes
[59:19] just about most fights that we have if
[59:21] we get in a verbal argument is we start
[59:23] talking about how each person responded
[59:25] to the situation not really the
[59:27] situation right we just kind of get lost
[59:29] in the whole you don't talk to me like
[59:30] that well you and then next thing you
[59:32] know it's like all we're doing is we're
[59:33] talking the fight is all about the fight
[59:36] the argument is all about the argument
[59:38] instead of saying all right time out
[59:41] what's the problem again what's the
[59:44] issue the fact that I didn't tell you
[59:47] that I wanted you home by 11 o'clock
[59:49] that's the
[59:51] problem and and you took advantage of
[59:53] that child I'm sorry I should have been
[59:56] more clear right and and and you find a
[1:00:00] way to address what
[1:00:03] happened instead of just fighting and
[1:00:05] then getting into a conflict that
[1:00:07] further instigates more conflict to
[1:00:09] where you don't even know what you're
[1:00:10] fighting for
[1:00:12] anymore so it's our reaction that can
[1:00:15] make it worse and I'll say sometimes
[1:00:16] it's our inaction that's even
[1:00:19] worse when we're being reactive we're
[1:00:22] often times just mirroring the intensity
[1:00:24] of the other person so if they're
[1:00:26] offended we're offended if they're mad
[1:00:28] we get mad if they're jealous we get
[1:00:29] jealous if they want to throw some crazy
[1:00:31] terms out there we're going to throw
[1:00:32] crazy right back oh no you didn't all
[1:00:35] right I can too that's usually what
[1:00:37] happens when we respond we're reacting
[1:00:39] in the moment to something that's heated
[1:00:40] instead of addressing something like we
[1:00:42] ought to we just kind of mirror the
[1:00:44] attitude of the
[1:00:45] offender how many times have we acted
[1:00:47] like our child when we were correcting
[1:00:49] our
[1:00:50] child
[1:00:51] right don't ever hit someone ever h
[1:00:56] someone in
[1:00:58] Anger right it's like I'm just mirring
[1:01:00] I'm with the same I'm going to kill you
[1:01:02] for killing somebody else right it's
[1:01:05] that that conflict of logic but
[1:01:08] sometimes we're just doing the same
[1:01:09] thing we respond in kind I think our
[1:01:11] need jerk reaction is when we see a
[1:01:13] bully we want to bully
[1:01:15] him right it's our knee-jerk reaction
[1:01:18] when we see a bully especially as an
[1:01:19] adult we see a little kid boy like you
[1:01:21] don't do that who do you think you are
[1:01:23] man picking on somebody small than you
[1:01:26] you think you're all big and bad huh you
[1:01:29] want to go you want to go it's like well
[1:01:30] who's the bully you're the adult in the
[1:01:34] room but we'll mirror we'll we'll mimic
[1:01:37] we'll just disr back it's our reaction
[1:01:40] to a situation instead of addressing
[1:01:44] it but if you're responsive you're
[1:01:46] honest there's no pretense involved
[1:01:49] you're not stubborn you're not digging
[1:01:51] your heels in you're not just saying
[1:01:52] well I put in the hard work and I'm a
[1:01:53] Christian and I've served the Lord for
[1:01:55] so long and I'm a message believer and I
[1:01:57] laid the right foundation you assess you
[1:02:00] got wisdom you're like you know what
[1:02:02] something's wrong we need to address
[1:02:03] this we've offended somebody what can we
[1:02:06] do to make it right and not just say
[1:02:08] well I'm doing
[1:02:09] right or maybe even we're unwilling to
[1:02:11] recognize that there's issues in our
[1:02:13] family well my kids's not that way it's
[1:02:15] your
[1:02:16] fault or sometimes we just get to where
[1:02:18] we like well they just need to get over
[1:02:20] it and in the moment you're not
[1:02:24] responding you want to dig in
[1:02:26] I didn't do anything wrong I didn't say
[1:02:28] anything wrong and that may be true but
[1:02:30] you dig in and you get obstinate and you
[1:02:32] get stubborn and you don't
[1:02:35] respond in a way that can resolve it you
[1:02:38] respond in a way that just escalates it
[1:02:41] and it gets worse and it gets worse and
[1:02:43] gets worse so when we don't respond
[1:02:46] that's why houses
[1:02:49] fall musicians if you'd
[1:02:54] come when we're
[1:02:58] reactive that's why houses
[1:03:00] fall and so well how do we how do we sum
[1:03:04] this up well I'm not going to try to sum
[1:03:06] it up but I will say
[1:03:08] this we pray and ask God to give us
[1:03:11] wisdom because guiding being led in this
[1:03:14] hour is difficult as Leaders it's
[1:03:17] difficult as husbands and as fathers we
[1:03:19] live in a very difficult time with a lot
[1:03:21] of traps and a lot of ditches and we're
[1:03:23] we're constantly needing to be led
[1:03:24] ourselves and so we ask God to lead us
[1:03:27] we ask God to guide us because we've got
[1:03:28] to guide hearts hearts of our children
[1:03:31] we got to protect the hearts of our
[1:03:32] wives we got to be protect there's a lot
[1:03:34] that's on our plate even for mothers and
[1:03:36] wives there's a lot that we are
[1:03:38] wrestling with so what do we ask God for
[1:03:39] wisdom and he tells us to ask and he's
[1:03:42] not going to rebuke you for asking Lord
[1:03:43] I need wisdom in this situation I need
[1:03:46] to know how to
[1:03:49] respond and if I could say this as a way
[1:03:53] of trying to just bring it to a close
[1:03:57] is I think there's a lot if you're in a
[1:03:59] time of Peace if you're in a time of
[1:04:00] rest if you're in a time where things
[1:04:01] are going well this is the time to
[1:04:04] strengthen
[1:04:05] yourself this is the time to really dig
[1:04:08] in and apply yourself and uh uh find you
[1:04:12] know make sure that your Bedrock is
[1:04:14] secure and keep doing what you know you
[1:04:16] ought to do as a Christian because the
[1:04:18] winds will
[1:04:19] come and when the winds come you need to
[1:04:21] be secure where you're
[1:04:24] standing and so in that moment you can
[1:04:28] respond with
[1:04:29] praise respond with
[1:04:32] prayer respond in the way that you know
[1:04:34] the word has already dictated you to
[1:04:36] respond if you need to respond in a way
[1:04:37] it says whoa whoa whoa we've been doing
[1:04:39] this we've been doing this this was our
[1:04:40] plan we were going to do this we were
[1:04:41] going to do this and things start
[1:04:42] happening and you realize no this isn't
[1:04:44] working out you just respond I think
[1:04:47] there's sometimes we get it in our heads
[1:04:48] that this is what I got to do this is
[1:04:50] what I got to do and the Lord just
[1:04:51] starts trying to show us all sorts of
[1:04:52] ways like slow down don't do it but we
[1:04:55] get stuck ubn we're just going to no
[1:04:57] bless God this is what God wants me to
[1:04:58] do this is the will of God and we
[1:05:00] foolishly just plow ahead not
[1:05:03] recognizing all the warning signs that
[1:05:05] God's trying to give
[1:05:07] us so we have to ask God
[1:05:10] for we we need to ask him for
[1:05:13] wisdom and if you're in that storm now
[1:05:16] the walls are
[1:05:17] shaking if things are are or it looks
[1:05:20] like things are falling don't
[1:05:23] despair it's not a literal storm form
[1:05:25] you it's not your literal house it's
[1:05:28] spiritual you can say well there's my
[1:05:30] literal family brother Aaron but the
[1:05:32] problems that are being exposed are
[1:05:34] weaknesses that God can
[1:05:36] correct if we're willing to be honest
[1:05:39] and humble to act and if failure to hear
[1:05:42] was a problem say Lord open my ears to
[1:05:45] hear if failure to obey was a problem
[1:05:47] then say Lord forgive me for not
[1:05:49] responding forgive me for not acting I
[1:05:52] hear and now Lord I want to obey I'm
[1:05:54] going to yield myself and just know that
[1:05:56] in the same way that the problems came
[1:05:58] because of Disobedience I believe that
[1:06:01] problems can be reversed through
[1:06:03] obedience if by one man's Disobedience
[1:06:06] sin and death entered through one man's
[1:06:08] obedience death is conquered and sin has
[1:06:11] been vanquished it shows for us a
[1:06:13] pattern in our own individual lives
[1:06:14] where my Disobedience and stubbornness
[1:06:16] has caused me great harm my humility and
[1:06:19] asking for forgiveness and repentance
[1:06:21] will bring me great Victory and virtue
[1:06:23] and healing and I believe there are no
[1:06:26] lost
[1:06:27] causes whether it be your own adult
[1:06:30] children whether it be your own marriage
[1:06:31] whatever it might be I am not going to
[1:06:34] say there is a lost cause because I
[1:06:36] believe the
[1:06:38] word the word
[1:06:41] can but I want us to all be very
[1:06:43] familiar with this Dynamic more in terms
[1:06:46] of ahead of time so it can be
[1:06:49] wisdom so that we can begin to act in a
[1:06:52] way that we ought to so that when the
[1:06:53] difficulty comes we can rest securely in
[1:06:56] that
[1:06:57] house amen I trust it makes some sense
[1:07:00] to
[1:07:00] you these are things I've been tracking
[1:07:03] for quite some time maybe just the last
[1:07:05] couple years I've had these principles
[1:07:07] at different times and different sermons
[1:07:08] to share and I just felt impressed today
[1:07:11] even if it doesn't make sense in the
[1:07:14] context share
[1:07:16] it so if it was wrong and it it was
[1:07:19] messed up I'll
[1:07:21] respond the right way just please don't
[1:07:24] react the the wrong way just kind of
[1:07:26] guide me a little bit just address it
[1:07:28] brother Aaron it didn't make a lick of
[1:07:29] sense like that time when I got up and I
[1:07:31] said that my favorite vegetable was an
[1:07:35] onion and the brother from Africa had
[1:07:38] said that he didn't like honey and I
[1:07:40] thought he said onions and Jack thought
[1:07:41] he said onions so I was in good company
[1:07:44] and just out of the middle of nowhere I
[1:07:45] said my favorite vegetabl is an onion
[1:07:48] take that right and everybody's like
[1:07:51] well that's really weird he needs his
[1:07:52] blood sugar must be he needs a Snickers
[1:07:54] he needs some milk
[1:07:56] but you know there's situations where if
[1:07:58] someone makes a mistake all someone had
[1:08:00] to do is they came to me and said um I
[1:08:02] think he said honey and I was like oh
[1:08:05] right and you realize hey I need to make
[1:08:07] that right or I need to I need to
[1:08:09] clarify L people think I'm losing it and
[1:08:12] if when people approach you the right
[1:08:14] way it's easier to respond the right
[1:08:17] way and and I'm realizing now that just
[1:08:20] all these things are just so heavy on my
[1:08:21] heart it's just one big huge picture but
[1:08:23] if I could say this to the men maybe
[1:08:24] I'll pick up on this more later that
[1:08:26] when we can be responsive we can be
[1:08:29] proactive and responsive not reactive
[1:08:32] and not panicky when we can plan we can
[1:08:34] PR when we can do our part especially
[1:08:36] even as parents we make it easier on
[1:08:38] everyone
[1:08:39] else because when I'm learning to
[1:08:41] address a situation I don't I don't get
[1:08:43] maybe the same def defensive responses
[1:08:45] from my children when I learn to address
[1:08:47] a situation I don't get the same Rea
[1:08:49] prideful reaction from my husband why
[1:08:51] because I've learned that there's a way
[1:08:53] that I can approach this to resolve the
[1:08:54] issue instead of
[1:08:56] escalated and so there's there's what
[1:08:58] things that we can do to to strengthen
[1:09:01] our families to make our houses homes
[1:09:03] and I desire I desire that the peace of
[1:09:06] God would reign supreme in your
[1:09:08] individual house in your home and in
[1:09:11] this church God bless you let's stand to
[1:09:14] our
[1:09:15] feet
