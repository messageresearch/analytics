TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you may recall that this was a scripture that we took when we began the series on hate and we we're taking a thought um on the peace of God and those different characteristics of the kingdom and how he would be the prince of peace and in his government there would be no end to the peace because he'd order it and establish it there'd be righteousness and judgment so I'm revisiting this now just before Christmas comes and and with all the celebrations and all the things that we're meditating on and things that we're celebrating I want this to resonate in your hearts a little bit just to bring something before us to orient us to just the significance of the birth of Christ which I don't think is lost on us but I wanted to start with this statement from the sermon what think ye of Christ and brother Bram is asking the question what do you think and what are your thoughts about Christ and what is it that uh comes to mind when you consider certain things and he makes this statement today if the people would only regard the name of Jesus that was left in the church he said what whatever ever you ask the father in my name that will I do he gave the church his name to marry bury baptize everything in the world that we do whatever you do in word and deed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ so there's something about that name there's a significance to it though we could constantly sound it out and say it and we hear it all the time and we even know the name is given in such a ways to where we it's just not maybe as significant as we might think it is or it's just lost its significance he says but we lost the sacred of that name now he says we says we lost the sacredness of that name we use it in vain in jokes you can't put bitter and sweet water out of the same Fountain friend now this is a challenge as he says this we've lost the sacredness of the name Jesus we was this name was given to to Mary to baptize even to bury and everything we would do in word and deed do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he says we've lost the sacredness of it he says you've got to get to a place to you reverent that name and believe it and know it and use it just exactly right so to those who've lost the sacredness of the name of Jesus Christ you've got to get to a place where you reverence that name you believe it you know it and you use it use it the way that we ought to use it so this is a challenge About the Name of Jesus Christ and how that the sacredness of that name has been lost and how we've got to come back to a place of reverence and the question I pose is he says what think ye of Christ Christ I'm posing the question that has the birth of Christ lost its sacredness and I I know this is maybe a subject matter that we'd say well that's worthy of debate that's worthy of discussing and there's a lot that we could explore on this subject but it struck me and even this past week I was fellowshipping with a brother and we were talking about certain traditions and things and what they did as a family and in the midst of everything that takes place just what he does with his children uh uh to kind of bring uh Christ to to the center of everything and it struck me that as message Believers we all know that Christ Jesus Christ was not born on December 25th and to us it's not even a matter of it wasn't the 25th it was the 26th but we realize that it it was in a different time of year it was a different season under a different sign and it's something that we believe adamantly and something that uh has its place in scripture and has a significance and meaning to it and that he wasn't born around this time of year we recognize that Christians long ago begin to celebrate the birth of Christ around this time and it was after this date became sacred to Christians that they try to blend it with uh paganism and idolatry and to try to take away the sacredness of it and what I begin to recognize is that since we don't believe he was born at this time of year I wonder if it has diminished the value of what this time of year is supposed to be recognizing H we don't we don't believe that he was laying in a Manger this time of year we don't believe he was born on December 25th and because we don't believe that there's actually any kind of symmetry at all to the time of year to the actual birth of Christ that it's kind of we've lost sensitivity to the birth of Christ we don't have a time that we do celebrate it we don't have a time that we really do think about it like we do Easter people come to church on Easter they believe that this so many years ago around this time of year Christ resurrected but is it that because we know the truth it's diminished the value of the birth of Christ that many are acknowledging at this time it's just easy for us to go into the commercialism of of it and go into the stories and the other things and traditions built around it like well we know Christ wasn't born to where the only thing that does have our attention this time of year is the candy canes and the tinsil and the Christmas trees and the giftgiving and it it's lost the sacredness to where we could take some time to think about the fact that Christ was born and think about the fact that God sent him the way that he did in the time that he did in the place that he did in the things that he did and all the symbolism and all the everything that took place around it I believe it's important for us to consider it and so tonight with that in mind and hoping to bring uh some sacredness back to it and and reverence it a little bit I want to talk about the birth of Christ and I want to use this title the manger throne and and I at towards the end there and I think I have I towards the end I'll share with you a little bit of what inspired this H uh to use this title but we're looking at the birth of Christ and I want to ask you what do you see the picture that we have used here to represent this was painted by rimand and it's the Adoration of the Shepherds and it's it's depicting the scene of the Shepherds as they arrive to view the birth of Christ and I would ask what do you see and I'm inspired uh by Isaiah chapter 9:6 it's something I've just been thinking about over the last few weeks unto us a child and that was the phrase that just kept kind to me un us and it says a child and and and so just meditating on the child and this baby born and this infant that's coming and then all the other things that are quickly added to that event and what takes place I'm I'm inspired by that scripture in Isaiah 9 unto us a child is born and then also by the poem What Child Is This the question that is asked in that what we know to be a song What Child Is This and we know the melody and the song I want to just bring some things out of that tonight in a way to BR to cause us to think more about what we see in the birth of Christ and what we're seeing even in this time of year now bringing up that uh poem in mind I bring to your attention a Christmas song I'm sure that we're all familiar with it's Do You Hear What I Hear and one of my favorite memes of all time was shared with me my by my good friend and brother-in-law Jonathan Martin he sent it to me and it showed two Cowboys around a campfire and it looked like they're cooking coffee or making dinner and the one Cowboy's looking up and he says do You Hear What I Hear the other Cowboy said no I Hear What I Hear and I think that's a really good point and maybe that's a good thing but the question is do do You Hear What I Hear It Was Written In N in October of 1962 so it's maybe not one of our old traditional hymns but this this this song opens with questions uh to the Lamb by the night wind so that's kind of the Poetry of it I said the night wind to the little lamb it's asking the question and the question it asks is do you see what I see the night wind is seeing something and and as it sees it it's Awakening the attention of the Lamb do you see what I see and as it begins to describe to the lamb what it sees it says a star with a tail as big as a kite and the Knight is waking up the lamb to say do you see what I see and then there's a Do You Hear What I Hear From The Lamb a voice so big a voice as big as the sea and it goes all the way down to where now as those signs kind of cascade together and piece together it's what do they see a child a child shivering in the night that's that's what ultimately it's from what do do you see what I see Do You Hear What I Hear to now they they recognize it's a child shivering in the night and it's this is a a a a song that is written about kind of including different scenes and it brings in the Shepherds of Luke Chapter 2 so if we could turn there I'm going to read from verse 8 to verse 35 this is going to form the backbone of the service tonight and and again we even read this at the start of this past series we were doing on on the subject of hate it said and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field now there's significance to that keeping watch over their flock by night there's just brother Brandon preaching this Su why had to be Shepherd and he's getting us to think why little Bethlehem he's asking us these questions around this time what think ye of Christ he speaks that in December of 1953 he asked us a lot of questions around the Christmas season and as I speak on the manger Throne again I'm asking you what do you see it says and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them now it's just a it would seem to be an ordinary night and doing ordinary things and they're uh watching there at the night time their flock and the angel of the Lord comes upon them and this would be kind of a as I just imagined a very startling occurrence because it says in the glory of the Lord sh R shown right about them now this would be something that would sensitize them to something Beyond themselves this would not be a normal Cur and it would kind of break up the monotony of the night and maybe around them there's a glory that's shining as the glory of the Lord shines around them there's something they see physically and their eyes their brains are processing these images and there's something glowing and lighting up the the the the atmosphere around them and they were soore afraid so it begins to strike them emotionally and the angel said un them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy this is that intense enthusiasm this excitement at the good news which shall be be to all people and now it says this for unto you and now this is kind of a promise to the Shepherds it's not just an announcement that something has happened but for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David that would pointed them to Bethlehem and it gives it that Royal ring to it if you just say Bethlehem we're not thinking of a Royal City but for him to say for the angel to say the city of David it's to cause him to think about the king and it says a savior unto you is born a savior in Bethlehem which is Christ the lord now this is a you can't even wave this sentence it's off the charts because unto you is born in the city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord that that statement and that phrasing to think and I'm just getting the Goosebumps now and thinking about it that these angels say this to this Shepherd and this is the announcement at his birth and it's the all the hopes of Israel was to hear that phrase the the thousands and thousands of people and years and hundreds hundreds of generations have been looking forward to hear unto you in the city of David a savior is born Christ the lord the Messiah the one that David wrote about the Lord sent unto my Lord this is the Lord the Messiah coming the anointed one unto you this day the Messiah is born what an announcement and it's you we can't put ourselves necessarily in the mind of these Shepherds not being Shepherds ourself not being a Jews not being that time and so maybe it's very difficult but if there's some way just to imagine just how much of a paradigm shift that would have been and what that might have begin to do and someone's heart to think I know this is the Lord this is Supernatural this is beyond myself and he's saying unto you I'm sending the Messiah to you today the Messiah is born it says and this shall be a sign which is a Wonder or token to unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the manger and the trajectory of this that goes from the ordinary of shepherds abiding in the field keeping that watch over the flock by night to this sudden fracture in the atmosphere to the angel Lord standing there and His glory shining round about them and their attention is captivated their emotions are stirred and they're afraid and they're told not to fear because you unto you is given the Messiah and this day in the seat of David a king has been bored and then with that with that image I'm hoping it can just strike you this way as it struck me I'm just so desirous that I'm able to deliver this burden adequately tonight says ye shall find a babe and it's almost as if the Grandeur has returned back to the normal yeah good and this announcement of a messiah and a king the city of David and the glory of the Lord and now as it has built itself to this climax it says and you're going to go and you're going to find a babe an infant a newborn wrapped in swaddling clothes which is something torn the word swaddle something rented and torn lying in a crib a Manger not in a Palace brother bam describes it in many different places and it's it's the only place I've really ever read this and haven't really gone gone searching for it but I think we've all kind of had this in our minds what that swaddling clothes is and brother bam says it quite often I've been told I've been told that I believe the tradition is he says a swaddling cloth we're told was off the Yol of an ox that they wrapped him in in the manger and he would describe it that this the the Yoke would rub upon the ox and it would cause it to bleed and to get blistered and cause very so they' R rip this cloth and they'd wrap it around the yolk and set it upon the ox so that would be what would be rubbing up against the O Ox it was the barrier between the burden and the the wound and so he takes something that may have been worn by an ox that was ripped apart maybe they took a part that didn't look as bad and say they wrapped the baby in that sometimes we get all scared and nervous about germs hey we're here think about everything that's existed throughout all centuries and all times and we've made it and that's so that's the reason why a lot of people are sick now is there's not enough germ terms our kids aren't eating enough dirt who sells Diet Tom matous Earth here it says he's wrapped in this swaddling cloth which was taken off an ox and brother B uses this language in this statement we're reading it he said we're told it was from the Yol of an ox in a stinking stable over the wastage in the stable can I admit something to you I don't know if we should stop the stream but when I read that I was like what's wage I need to Google what wage is I just wasn't reading it as wastage but he says in the stinking stable over the wastage in the stable stable I mean that's that should cause you to think oh that's that's foul and that the smells and those things he describes in quite a remarkable way in several different places and the stable is not even a correct stable because even the historians and many agree says it's a little cave in the side of a hill I just found just found some kind of Nook back in the cliff and enough room to put up enough barriers to call it a stable and use used it as some sort of ancillary Outpost it was even a correctly built stable it was maybe not an afterthought but it was the last resort and it's there in this place in the dead of the night that Christ the in the is born a savior Christ the lord and it's a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the manger and this and I I chose to insert that description there because he says you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaden clothes lining in a main the angel Lord's describing this scene of a stinking stable with the wastage and the stable everywhere and the swaddling clothes and what it ought to have uh what it actually was it's describing it that's what it looked like but then in verse 13 it says and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men now think of that uh that sudden shift once CE again from the monotony of the night keeping the Sheep to now the angel Lord the angel of the Lord standing there and you'll notice in a moment just what it meant to the Shepherds as they declare it and the glory of the Lord shine shining round about them and they hear this pronouncement unto you the savior is born in the city of David Christ the Messiah the Messiah Lord has been born unto you a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the manger and then suddenly again the sky is filled with the multitude of the Heavenly Host and we know we describe it as they were singing These anthems and it describes it as maybe a song but it just says they're saying and they're declaring glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and this is the announcement at the image of a newborn infant wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger in a little cave in the side of the hill in a stinking stable what a sight for them to behold the Angel Lord now surrounded by a multitude of a Heavenly Host what a sound what a sight and what a sound to hear in that moment and the how overwhelming it would have been to their senses the Angels announcing the Messiah in the contrast to verse 12 a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lining in the manger think of all the heavens being full of angels to where as we would see the stars and the thickness of the stars that now the sky is just full of a heavenly host and all their voices and they and the Shepherds can hear it can feel it what A Sight and Sound and it's contrasted by this little baby wrapped in Oxen rags in a stinking stable what a contrast and it says in verse 15 and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into the heaven however it was that they disappeared out of their sight the shepherd said one to another let us now go even un Bethlehem they they had heard the message they had received this announcement from the angel of Lord and it's quite a a Grandeur quite a scene and a lot to bask in a lot for me maybe just to settle down like woo wow this was amazing but they are they catch that the this was an invitation unto you is born this day and it shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe and it wasn't necessarily told to go but the way that was being announced is you need to go and so something stirs inside of them and it says they said let us now go even to Bethlehem that's that city of David and see that's what part has just been so exciting to me and see this thing which is to come to pass which has come to pass they were told by the angel of Lord so they could they could have had it on good word that it had come to pass and they wouldn't have been wrong to say that it came to pass but there was something inside of these Shepherds that say let us go and see the thing that has come to pass I don't want to just talk about it I don't want to just be told about it I want to see what has come to pass he says that let's see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us that strikes me to say that there's a lot of things that God has revealed to us there's a lot of things that maybe we see by Revelation but we ought to have a hunger to see the things that the Lord has made known unto us I want to see it by his stripes I'm Healed I believe it now I want to see it there's certain things that have been made known to us by Revelation I believe it it's been told to me it's on good word I don't doubt it but I still want to see it yes see the thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste they just weren't kind of walking they weren't taking their time they didn't take the long way there was an urgency let us now go to Bethlehem and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a Manger they saw what the Lord had made known he told them that you'll find a babe wrapped in swadd and clothes lying in the manger they said well let's go see what we already know let's take steps let's Advance let's go forward to that which we know we're not doubting it we're not claiming that we need to prove the veracity of it no we know it therefore I can have confidence to go see it and they saw exactly what the Lord had made know to them I believe it could be noted that based upon what they were told there's no uh nothing in the scripture that implies that they saw a star although the night wind had told the little lamb uh there's nothing in the scripture to tell us that that's what they had seen but yet somehow they find their way to this place and they see the very thing that they had known and in this scene brother brandham touches on it a little bit and God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same it'd be a good Christmas message to listen to he's talking about Joseph he says the man Joseph with such connection with God till God could speak to him then he makes the statement he you can tell there's a lot there that he wants to get into he says but today we get our ecclesiastical jacket so draw up around us till nothing can speak to us outside of the ecclesiastical group that we belong to we have our ideas and our interpretations and we have a way that we want it to be we have our Traditions he said we get so caught up drawned up so tight in our ecclesiastical jacket that anything outside of that we won't listen to H if the angel Lord appeared and begin to tell us what we would go see we would we wouldn't desire to go see it we wouldn't advance to go see it he says anything outside of that group we that we belong to nothing can speak to us he says I don't want to get harsh or radical so I'll leave that alone right there and so I'm kind of wishing he would have got a little radical and I would have invited a little bit of harshness to know what he was hitting at there he says notice but you understand what I mean notice a stable was ridiculous for them that means it's it deserves mockery to be ridiculous it deserves ridicule derision stable if you had to announce this to go and and if good it it brings to mind perhaps if this announcement had been to any other class of people besides Shepherds it would have been like that's where he went then maybe we've been wasting our time waiting for him oh that's what he is right now as a baby well let's see if he makes it to 30 years old and then we'll follow him he says it was ridiculous a stable I believe it suggests that had the angel Lord appeared and said the Messiah was born in a stable that said be the Messiah no uh-uh we just don't believe it that's good cuz it's ridiculous he says the polished we don't even have a record where he ever attended one day of school and yet at the age of 12 years old a simple boy confounded the priest in the temple by his teaching he says oh my what was it God hiding himself ever heard of hide and seek so God's hiding himself and you have to find him to see him and here God was hidden this picture of a babe lying in a Manger but the angel of the Lord told him go and you'll see go and you'll find cuz he's hiding there in this cave in the side of a hill he's hiding there in this stinking stable he's hiding wrapped in Oxen Rags he's hiding there but the Lord said this is where you'll see the Messiah this is where you'll find him it's God hiding himself he says I feel pretty religious right now God hiding himself in a barn oh Hallelujah God hiding himself in a barn what do you see I just see a shack I just see a barn I just see something very simple he says God hiding himself in a little child amen am it's God there in the barn it's God there in this little child watch he said it's going to display after a while though it's hid in the barn it's hidden the child but eventually it's going to display itself and the the secret is is to see it where he's hiding right because once it displays itself it could be too late yes amen when he went on the streets the parents no doubt would talk and say these are the Whispers about this child who's now growing don't play with that kid don't have nothing to do with him his M mother's nothing but a common prostitute these are the Whispers about Christ you hear the stories you know the rumors about his birth you know what Joseph did you know what the Romans did you know what she did says the father and the mother the baby was born before they were actually married maybe nitpicking on the dates right they they felt they they found that I got you right the moment where they could add it all up and put all the times and figures together and say wow I mean the baby couldn't even been they weren't even married yet when it was born it could had to be conceived before then so this is a big stain birth certificates were an issue even way back then he says the baby was born before they were actually married she was be she was to be mother have nothing to do with it that's what they have to say about this child you say What Child Is This it's a it's the results of adultery What Child Is This is born out of wedlock What Child Is This the child of a common prostitute's the rumor but it's God hiding himself hiding himself behind the rumors hiding himself behind the the the the lies hiding himself behind all the facts and figures that they would have come up to try to tear it down right and so it brings me to one of the things that was a great inspiration to me in preparing this sermon is the poem by William Chatterton dicks so you have to say all three if he's writing a poem but this this poet wrote What Child Is This in 1865 and this poem poses three questions about the manger scene and when it was written in 1865 it was just that it was just a poem by William Chatterton dicks but in 1871 it was set to the tune of green sleeves and here's the I believe this is the original music that was published in in 1871 and it is this the the tun Greensleeves was a traditional English folk song that was hundreds of years old some speculate that it was written by Henry VII but it wasn't it was even referenced long before Henry 8 and there's a lot of Shakespeare refers to it and it was a traditional English folk song that many have tried to interpret through the years but one of the traditional interpretations of the song remember this is the tune that the the poem What Child Is This is set to What Child Is This which lays to res that Melody and that tune is this green sleeves this English folk song and one of the traditional interpretations about that song is it's about a promiscuous young woman or about a prostitute there's this speculation oh the tune is about a a common prostitute this tune is about a this woman about a mistress and about that and I thought it was remarkable that a tune that these labels had been attached to and the speculation is that was bu just about some promiscuous woman or some common prostitute that they would choose that tune to go to the words What Child Is This because that was the very song they were singing about Mary it was the very song they were singing about Christ What Child Is This the child of a common prostitute What Child Is This the child of a mistress the child of a lover and that may be all that some see is the rumors and the falsehoods but the questions asked in this poem that one day was played six years later to this tune of green sleeves to where now it's most recognized as The Melody of What Child Is This the questions posed in that poem were What Child Is This who laid to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping there's your first question this child that's laying on Mary's lap this child that is sleeping there What Child Is This whom Angels greet cuz now we realize the baby having been born the announcement coming afterwards now to the public a and to the shepher and they're going to be soon invited to see this scene the question is whom Angels greet with Anthem sweet taking those very words glory to God in the highest and turn it into an Anthem turn into a song and and we don't take issue with that as maybe the uh the bans would but we would say no this is this is the Declaration this is the proclamation says whom Angels greet with Anthem sweet while Shepherds watch are keeping this is the next question What Child Is This that lays to rest What Child Is This that the angels have announced to these Shepherds with this Anthem and then the the second the next question in the what would be called maybe the second verse is why lies he in such mean a state he may not be able to see it here on the slide but that's the question why lies he in such mean a state where ox and asss are feeding what is he doing here notice I I think it kind of it moves in and out as we see this babe in a Manger wrapped in swaddling clothes on the lap of this teenage girl and a side of the St stinking stable on the side of a hill but then we hear the angels greet with Anthem sweet while Shepherds watch are keeping we hear these angels declared and it comes right back after hearing what the angel said well why does he lay here in such a mean a state surrounded by oxen and sheep and it says good Christian fear for Sinners here the silent word is pleading what a phrase as immediately grabs our attention a babe lying in the manger Angels saying this is the Messiah but her eyes turned back to the stable a stinking stable amongst uh animals and beasts of Burden that are eating and straw and the smile's a mean State and it says good Christian fear be in awe reverence don't lose the sacredness for Sinners here the silent word is pleading the silent word he could not yet form words he could not speak out the kingdom of God is at hand but somehow in this scene what do you see do you see what I see Do You Hear What I Hear The Poet is saying the silent word is pleading and these Shepherds it says in Luke 27 and when they had seen it this is what they saw say what did they see they saw a baby in a stinking stable on the side of a hill that's what they saw would you agree with me I know maybe that's a sounds like a trick question I'm trying to box you in and impeach you but uh this is he says what what what did they see it says when they had seen it they made known abroad the Sayan the Sayan what Sayan which was told them concerning this child this is the way and and I apologize if maybe I'm adding my thought on this but they saw it and they made known what they were told amen that's good they what they saw they could have said well let's just kind of stick to what we call the facts here we saw a teenage girl with an older man with his baby born in the side of a hill around oxen and sheep and kind of described it we'll just kind of leave it to you but they told what they knew God had told them they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning the child they made known the truth of it what they actually saw so it wasn't just to describe the circumstances but to know what they saw all and they said this is what we've seen we've seen Christ the lord we've seen a savior born this day in Bethlehem CU isn't all that heard it wondered at those things which are told them by the Shepherds I could have believed it they would have went back and told everybody oh man this lady had a baby on the side of a hill she had a baby in a stable and there's no room in the end and she had a baby nobody would be in Wonder and awe they say oh well that's unfortunate yeah there's a lot of people in town there's not a lot of end with beds tonight that's it's unfortunate she had to be that baby had to be born but it was to this day this day to you is born a savior Christ the Lord but it says but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart two different reactions two different responsibilities brother Brandon picks up on it and God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same but altogether no matter what the outside thought she pondered all these things they hid it in their heart they knew knew they couldn't say anything against it God speaks to his men sometimes and say hold your peace don't say nothing about it brother BR kind of then gives a little bit of a description of circumstances where he's been under that situation he returns back and says and Joseph knew different he knew who that baby belonged to Mary knew who it belonged to Jesus knew who his father was what did he say I must be about my father's business it's speaking to what they knew what they saw what they understood there's one way we could describe it there's one way we could try to say well we were engaged and then this happened that happened just kind try to describe the facts and make the chronology work but said they kept these things in the art because they knew what it was she pondered these things Joseph knew these things they knew who the baby belonged to Jesus said I must be about my father's business not sawing wood and making a door but about his father's business he said that to his mother can't you understand that it's time for me to be about my father's business you'll find this as you read Luke Chapter 2 and read it to the end this very instance here is at the end of that chapter he says now they thought this little cracked up child he says any illegitimate child is kind of an odd Curious Thing anyhow and there you are but God hiding himself listen God hiding himself in what was thought of the world as filth corruption illegitimate look at all those labels that could be put on it all the warning signs all the red flags filth corruption illegitimate even as we would take all those things into view and bring it down to that one simple slice or segment there's Joseph there's Mary this man who was a spouse and had not yet taken her to be wife when she was found pregnant and now it has run its course they find themselves out of town and he's there in Bethlehem and there's no room at the end and they've been forced into the side of a hill into a little cave to have a baby born and now as the baby's born it's wrapped in swaddling clothes and is placed into a manger and the rumor is that Joseph is covering something up some adultery some fornication some sin and this baby is really an illegitimate child and this filth and Corruption everything right and somebody could add it all up together and say that's a fitting picture for what we actually think this is and what they would see is a common prostitute what they would see is unfaithfulness what they would see is filth and Corruption and illegit legitimate but in verse 20 it says and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them the angel Lord appears and says unto you this day a savior has been born in the city of David Christ the lord what an announcement they heard that and they saw it and now they return glorifying and praising ing God for all the things that they had heard what the Lord said and seen what they were told is it was a savior it was Christ the lord what they saw was a infant baby a newborn a child wrapped in swaddling clothes in a stinking stable among the wastage and The Oxen and the Sheep the filth and corruption with the label illegitimate but they were praising him for what they had heard and seen and as the poem goes What Child Is This who laid the rest on Mary's lap is sleeping whom Angels greet with Anthem sweep while Shepherds watch are keeping why lies he in such mean a state well where ox and ass are feeding good Christian fear for Sinners here the silent word is pleading and the chorus rings out when it's put to music to that tune of green sleeves that itself carries the mark and the stain of rumors and illegitimacy it rings out this chorus of the Shepherds this this is Christ the king whom Shepherds guard and Angels Sing haste haste to bring him Lord the babe the son of Mary what is it telling us that this is not just some common child this isn't just some birth and unfortunate circumstances but this is the Messiah King this is the king whom the Shepherds Race To Whom the Angels sang their anthem of this this baby that is born to this Mary this is the king amen right Christ the King that's what they saw and it says in verse 21 and when eight days were accomplished from the circumcision of for the circumcision of the child his name was called Jesus which was so named of the Angel before he was conceived in the womb when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord and there's a lot of steps that they're going going through a lot of scriptural things a lot of things hearkening back to the law say as it is written in the law of the Lord every male that openeth the womb Shall be Called holy to the Lord and to offer sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons and behold that sets the scene now just these eight days after this birth and behold there's a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the man the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel what was he waiting for the very things the angel said unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord that's what he was waiting for the consolation the peace the comfort and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ this is exactly what was announced which is the Lord's Christ which is Born This Day in the city of David and he came by the Spirit under the temple now he's going to see something he's been told that you're going to see the Lord's Christ now hopefully you can get yourself in this uh uh in this scene here I I don't this is this is a very simple straightforward thought tonight so just stay with me he says when the he had seen he when he came by the spirit into the temple when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law now they've come they brought the child to do those things which we read about in verse 23 and 24 now the holy they're coming according to the law he's coming according to the spirit beautiful how these things are going to intersect and those these obediences and the promise given here and The Obedience here and as they come together they're going to bring the child this baby to do according to the custom of La it says then took he him up in his arms now all he's doing is taking a baby which he has done many times before into his arms he's holding a child he's holding an infant he's holding a newborn and brother brandom even goes so far as to say that he's still wrapped in swaddling clothes wow there was nothing about the garments he was wrapped in there was nothing about the presentation there was nothing to signal with this great Entourage and words of of announcement it was nothing about the scene that would have signaled we've got royalty Simon be Simeon be on your best behavior there was nothing about it nothing about the garments he had on uh it wasn't Gucci LV all over the all over the blanket it wasn't anything to signal to him this is something very very important but as he takes it into his arms and blessed God and said now what did he see swaddling clothes a baby of eight days what would distinguish this but what does he see he says Lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation oh it's beautiful the confirmation as the angel of the Lord appeared to the Shepherds and say unto you this day in the city of David a savior is born the salvation of Israel and he could say mine eyes have seen thy salvation the very thing the angel lord said it was he knew what he saw was that thing says which thou prepared before the face of the people all people a light to lighten the Gentiles what was he holding an eighty old baby a light amen a savior and the glory of thy People Israel what was the glory the light the salvation and Joseph and his mother mark mared means they admired at those things which are spoken of him he was holding a baby of eight days wrapped in common garments maybe even wrapped in things that were uncommon if we took it from the the the swaddling clothes survived Bethlehem and made it there to be presented before Simeon in the temple he said I had was told that before I die I would see the Lord's Christ and now as he held the baby what does he see thy salvation yeah the Lord's Christ thy salvation brother brandham in the sermon why little Bethlehem as he asked this question in December of 63 says in this little town little stable City stable down on the side of the bluff was a cave back in the bluff and out of there came forth through its little doors the Prince of Peace born in a stable and a little box of straw sitting somewhere manure P manure piled up in the Barns and so forth but out there came that great Prince the seed of the woman there's Genesis 3:15 out there came the savior of the world out there came Jehovah himself and the form of a man came out of that little humble stable in Bethlehem not in some King's Palace born in royalty but let me say but yet a king not in some King's Palace born in royalty but yet born royally oh Hallelujah but there he came from that humble place to a manure stack down in there and was wrapped in swaddling cloth as tradition says it was taken from the Yoke of an ox where they had been plowing with it what is it that Simeon saw he saw the Prince of Peace he saw Jehovah as a little baby and this is the part that just I want to bring it to here in Luke chap 2: 34 and 35 CU Simon is not done because now he says and Simeon bless them when he held the child he took him up in his arms and blessed God and he spoke of what this child was hopefully that scene is still reverberating in your ears but now as it were is he still holding the salvation of the Lord the Messiah the Lord's Christ he blessed them and said unto Mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and Rising again of many in Israel the fall of many and the rising of many the curse of some and the blessing of some even spoken as it was the fall of Israel but yet it would be the Redemption of Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against this this prophecy is so important he's holding the baby ow you'd have to be a real ugly baby to be spoken against right maybe what the the least we all would say or the most we'd ever say is that's a face only a mother could love but as he holds this infant this newborn this baby and I don't keep using those phrases cuz you might not know which one of them means but just for the emphasis to remind ourselves of the Innocence and the reality that unto us a child was born this child is set for the fall and Rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against and then he inserts this parenthetical phrase kind of steps back a little bit and says something directly to Mary yay a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also sword shall pierce to thy own soul he's speaking to Mary as he speaks to Mary he's saying you're going to suffer and she did what was her suffering he's crucified her son is crucified and so as the poem is written What Child Is This that's laid to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping whom Angels greet with Anthem sweet why Shepherds watch are keeping the poem does not just describe that scene as to why he's left in such mean a state and where ox and ass are feeding good Christians fear for Sinners here the silent word is pleading the poem continues Nails spear shall pierce him through the cross be born for me for you hell hell the word made flesh the babe the son of Mary as it is even in simeon's own declaration to Mary behold this child is set for the fall and riseing again of many in Israel but it shall be a sword that pierces through thine own soul why because nail and spear shall pierce him through and it'll pierce your soul as a grieving mother then notice this phrase in Luke 2:35 that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed yes the sign will reveal the hearts of many what does a person see when they see him as it said You shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the manger it said this shall be a sign unto you and as he is holding this baby he says that it shall be for a sign which shall be spoken against and let's remove the parenthetical phrase about Mary that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed because what a Man speaketh reveals what's in his heart a person's response and an opinion of Christ discloses the thoughts of his Hearts amen a person's opinion about his birth a PO person's opinion about this babe this infant the way one might ration about his deity one that may rationalize about his birth one that may reject him just wholesale outright May accept that perhaps he was a great man that he lived this is what Christ is the Bible says he's going to be a sign and he's going to be a sign in such a way he's going to be a Wonder in such a way it'll cause many to speak against him and in doing so the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed when you see him what do you see what does a person see when they see him because our response to the sign discloses the thoughts in our hearts about Christ and brother brandham said God hiding himself in Simplicity what was it God in Simplicity that's what made him so great the ethics of Education cannot belittle itself like that see it cannot stand it but God is so great that he brought himself down to that not even of clothes to put on his own child think of it and the world there was no room in the end and he went into a cow stable a little ledge a little cave like back in the side of the hill and there upon a straw bed came the Son of God as we consider that scene what do you see what is it that we could take away from this and all the elements and all the imagery and how we're walk through the story all we have is the Angel of the Lord's word on it the rest of what we see is a baby yeah born of a woman in a little ledge on the side of a hill in a stinking stable yeah it survived it made it there was ox and there was sheep Okay Shepherd showed up all we have is the word of the Angel Lord all we have what is said but what is it we're seeing what is it that strikes the eye how is it we're processing what do we see could we by the Holy Spirit say what Simeon said I've seen thy salvation right what is it we see when we see him laying there on a straw bed because what we see is not just a Manger but a throne the manger throne it's also a poem by William Chatterton dicks written in 1865 it was published in the joyful hymns of Christian TI Christmas tide four joyful hymns of Christmas tide written it in 1865 they say it's this poem that What Child Is This was taken from this one that we've been reading to you tonight What Child Is This which laid to rest on Mary's lap as sleeping it came from this poem the manger Throne this is where I got my my title tonight and I'd like to read it to you like silver lamps in a distant Shrine the stars are sparkling bright the bells of the city of God ring out for the son of Mary is born tonight the Gloom is p and the m at last is commun with Orient light never fell Melodies so half so sweet as those which are feeling the skies think of this and never a palace s shown half so fair as the manger bed where our savior lies I it's you've got to see something you got to see past the manure got to see past the straw cuz he pass the flesh cuz here one is inspired to say never fell Melodies half so sweet of those which are filling the skies and never a palace shown half so fair as the manger bed where our savior lies no night in the year is half so dear as this which has ended our size now a new power has come on the earth a match for the armies of Hell a child is born who shall conquer the Foe and all the spirits of wickedness quell a child for Mary's son is the mighty one whom the prophets of God foretell the stars of Heaven still shine as at first they gleamed on this wonderful night the bells of the city of God peel out and the angel song Still rings in the height and love still turns where the godhead Burns hid in flesh from the flesh from fleshly sight could that be us love still turns where the godhead burn turns hid in flesh from fleshly sight Faith sees no longer the stable floor the pavement of sapphires there the clear Light Of Heaven streams out of the world and the angels of God are crowding the air and Heaven and Earth through the Spotless birth are at peace on this night so fair this poet he was just I believe an insurance salesman just a businessman he slipped into a deep depression and was despairing for life and in there he come to know Christ and he wrote this poem the manger Throne from this poem the manger Throne comes What Child Is This he says the bells of the city of God ring out never a palace Shone half so fair as the manger bed where our savior lies a new power has come on earth a match for armies of Hell the child is born which shall conquer the Foe and all the spirits of wickedness quell and he said that love still turns where the godhead Burns hidden flesh from fleshly sight can we say faith sees no longer the stable floor the pavement of sapphires there I don't just see a Manger I see a throne I don't see oxen I don't see hay I see royalty there for the Bible says in Isaiah 9:6 and 7 For unto us a child I kept thinking unto us a child you're you're dead in sins you're lost you're broken you're depressed you're diseased you're Afflicted you're under bondage you're being slain you're treated as Lambs for the slaughter unto us a child unto us us a child is born amen that's what was given a child unto us a son is given but what do you see I do not see a child I do not just see a son but a government a kingdom of power because the government shall be upon his shoulder what is he he's the king and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father not just a child not just the son the princip peace and of the increase of his government of his kingdom it shall be a kingdom of Peace there shall be no end and upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this and on that night as shepherds are keeping watch over their sheep the angel of the Lord comes and the glory of the Lord shines round about them and it says unto you is born this day it is said For unto you a child is born upon the throne of David as it were in Bethlehem in a Manger Throne What Child Is This who's laid to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping this child which lies in Mina state where ox and ass are feeding which Nails spear shall pierce him through the cross be born for me for you this this is Christ the King whom Shepherds seemingly seem to guard as they would Lambs as they would sheep why does he take the license to say whom Shepherds guard because that's what the Shepherds were doing is keeping guard over the sheep and there laid the Lamb of God In A Manger the Lamb of God the king of glory in a Manger Throne heast H to bring him Lord the babe the son of Mary and so the poem concludes so bring him in gold and myr come peasant King to own him this is what it's declaring this is what it's announcing this is what it wants us to do bring him incense bring him golden Merr come whether you be peasant or King to own him not as a possession as it were but to declare him to extol him to be identified with him the King of Kings salvation brings let loving hearts in en Throne him amen Place him upon the throne amen set him upon the throne raise raise a song on high the Virgin sings her lullabi joy joy for Christ is born the babe the son of Mary For unto us a child that's what he sent us but what do you see brother bradam says and God hidden himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same the mic the musicians you could come to your instruments he says look God hides himself in the corruption of a dead seed to bring forth life see do you get it God hides in himself now in a simple little wash woman or an ordinary man with his dinner under his arms kiss his wife and children goodbye and go out there and maybe hide himself in that man to do something that an Arch Bishop would know nothing about where do we where do we set him now come peasant come King to own him the king the king salvation brings let loving hearts enthrone him where does he hide himself and love still turns where the godhead Burns hidden flesh your flesh from fleshly sight why because people want to see the Archbishop they want to see him in great big things they want to see him in a palace they want to see him clothed in royalty they want him to come even today in a way that they expected him to then right yet he comes in Simplicity of Flesh and it's love where the godhead Burns hid in flesh seemingly from fleshly sight where does God hide himself and little washwoman an ordinary man see you don't hear him blow no horns and send it out God just gets Glory that's all the simple hear it and they're glad I hope you can hear him I hope you could hear his at where bells ringing I hope you can see what the what the poets write about is the night wind said to the little lamb do you see what I see and maybe we're not a little lamb and we don't hear the night wind but we could say I am to be another throne [Music] to the world nothing to the world the message is still nothing but a stinking stable it invites mockery it's still ridiculous and if we could step ourselves out of the glory of the Lord if we could step ourselves out of the Angel of the Lord if we could somehow separate ourselves out then we can see maybe what the world sees we can see just a a something wedged to a side of a hill we see the manure we see the straw we see the manger we see an older man we see a young teenage girl we see the dates not lining up we see a stinking stable it all makes sense from this perspective but do You Hear What I Hear do you see what I see I don't see the manure I don't even see the straw and if I see a Manger I still yet see a throne the manger Throne Christ inth throne yet again hidden flesh from fleshly sight I trust the simple hear it and are glad yet still today and I speak this to you today that if it be that because of Truth and because we know that Christ was not born on December 25th or even around there if it is to us a day of giving gifts that's fine if it is a time for us to make cookies if it's a time for gingerbread houses and Christmas songs that's fine it's wonderful but could we for a moment stop not just tonight but sometime together and stop and look and see the manger Throne that one day a child unto us a child a baby a newborn an infant was sent to us and it was a Manger throne and if I could see that doesn't matter if I could see that whatever I whatever else I see I could still speak of what I saw am and may we be God hidden flesh May the godhe head still burn hidden flesh from F fleshly sight May our faith no longer see the stable floor but royalty is here God bless you could we bow our heads in prayer
