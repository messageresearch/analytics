[0:00] and so glad that we're together. Here's
[0:01] my title again. It's the year in preview
[0:05] and [clears throat] we're asking the
[0:06] question, what is God's will for me this
[0:08] year? Uh that may have been I think that
[0:10] was the title that I started to work
[0:12] with with what is God's will for me this
[0:14] year? And then it kind of just struck me
[0:16] that it's uh when I begin to look at how
[0:18] particular we can be about God's will, I
[0:21] begin to realize that uh this is the
[0:22] year in preview and that there's things
[0:24] that we're looking forward to and things
[0:27] that we know we can experience and do in
[0:29] this coming year. And so that's my my
[0:31] thought today is to give a year in
[0:34] preview. If you could take your Bibles,
[0:36] I want to turn to Psalm uh 119 and 133
[0:40] verse 133 to start here. There's going
[0:43] to be a lot here at the outset that may
[0:46] be very very dense and it's I think it's
[0:49] really deep material uh when you begin
[0:51] to look at it and I uh we may go back
[0:55] and unpack some of it. We may
[0:57] [clears throat] need to but if you could
[0:59] just stay very focused with me as we
[1:01] look at it because there's just a lot
[1:04] here and I'm wanting to get to the
[1:06] question of what is God's will for me
[1:08] this year. But to to begin to look at it
[1:10] first, I want to uh look at the idea of
[1:12] how God orders things and our choice as
[1:15] it relates to that. So it says, "Order
[1:17] my steps in thy word and let not any
[1:19] iniquity have dominion over me." Now
[1:22] this uh second part has so much meaning
[1:25] to it, especially when Paul deals with
[1:27] it in the book of Romans. And so he's
[1:29] asking, "Lord, order my steps." This is
[1:32] a prayer to God that our steps we could
[1:35] put ourselves in this and not just the
[1:36] psalmist but order my steps in thy word.
[1:39] Let my steps there speaks of motions and
[1:42] actions and to order them would be to
[1:44] make them firm and to make them certain.
[1:47] And he says make them certain according
[1:49] to thy word. So it's not just uh show me
[1:52] a plain path and I want to know what
[1:54] your will is for my life uh and and or
[1:57] what or not necessarily what your will
[1:58] is but just show me what I'm going to
[2:00] do. show me where I'm going to end up
[2:01] like a fortune teller. He's saying,
[2:03] "Order my steps in thy word. Make them
[2:05] certain. Make them unfailing. Make my
[2:08] actions and my motions uh Lord, you
[2:10] order them. You arrange them." And then
[2:13] in Psalms 37:23,
[2:16] this is where we get uh the phrase, "The
[2:19] steps of a righteous man are ordered of
[2:21] the Lord." The footsteps of a righteous
[2:23] man are order of the Lord. This is the
[2:25] exact verse that that's drawn from. It
[2:26] says, "The steps of a good man." Psalms
[2:29] 37 uh 23, the steps of a good man are
[2:32] ordered by the Lord and he delightth in
[2:35] his way. The way it's phrased there,
[2:36] that last phrase, uh it could be
[2:38] speaking of the Lord, it could be
[2:39] speaking of the man, but both are true.
[2:41] The steps of a good man are ordered by
[2:44] the Lord. And that word there, good man,
[2:47] could have been translated, and I think
[2:49] some uh translations actually render it
[2:51] this way, a strong man. The steps of a
[2:54] strong man are ordered by the Lord or
[2:55] the steps of a conqueror. um the steps
[2:57] of a hero are ordered by the Lord. And
[3:00] it's used that way to to show us that
[3:03] even the strong, even the competent,
[3:05] even the able, the most powerful must
[3:08] rely upon God uh or their strength or
[3:11] their efforts or their genius or their
[3:13] talents will fail them. That's what you
[3:16] could really pick up on this. It says
[3:17] it's not just saying every man's steps
[3:19] are ordered, but it wants us to think
[3:21] about a strong man, a hero, and think
[3:23] that even this man, his life
[3:27] a it it must be ordered by the Lord or
[3:30] all his strength will fail. And so
[3:31] there's a there's this prayer that comes
[3:34] up in these two verses uh that direct
[3:36] all my actions and govern all my affairs
[3:39] and all my affections in a way that your
[3:41] word prescribes them. order my steps in
[3:44] thy word. Or the steps of a good man are
[3:46] ordered by the Lord. Then Lord, direct
[3:49] my actions, govern my thoughts, uh um
[3:51] inspire my affection so that they line
[3:54] up with your word. And it says, "And he
[3:57] delightth in his way." If I can say
[3:59] this, and accepting God's leadership,
[4:02] their satisfaction.
[4:04] And and it's it's not just an acceptance
[4:07] like, "Well, okay." But it's a
[4:09] deliberate choice. When we say, "Lord,
[4:11] order my steps in thy word." Then
[4:14] there's some, and this is where it
[4:15] begins to amplify a lot in Psalms 119
[4:18] and other places where it's like the
[4:19] word then [clears throat] speaks to us
[4:21] to give us the order.
[4:23] Amen.
[4:23] So then when the word says this is this
[4:25] is the steps, then you walk in them. If
[4:28] if a sinner was pricricked in their
[4:30] heart, the word says repent. A and
[4:32] that's the first step. And then the next
[4:34] step is to be baptized. And the next
[4:35] step is is to to make firm that that
[4:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost, that seal of
[4:40] God. So you can look in the word and see
[4:42] that wherever you are, the word can
[4:44] speak to your situation and order your
[4:46] steps. So it's in a deliberate choice of
[4:51] God's leadership and what that order is.
[4:52] Order my steps and these ordering of the
[4:54] Lord. There's a deliberate choice to
[4:56] accept that. And one thing I thought
[4:58] about it was yesterday as I was
[4:59] considering this is that it's when our
[5:02] way matches his way. It says he
[5:06] delightth in his way. So there is our
[5:08] that would be the delight would only
[5:10] come when your way matches his way
[5:12] because then your way will be delight
[5:14] him and then you will be delighting in
[5:17] his way. And whether you're the the his
[5:19] here or the his there, there's going to
[5:21] be a delight there. There's going to be
[5:22] a satisfaction. So, it's when our way
[5:25] matches his way. When there's some sort
[5:26] of there's an alignment of aims, uh we
[5:30] there's a way for you to begin to think
[5:31] about this. There's times when we can
[5:33] say that uh well, where do you want to
[5:36] go eat? And one thing we learned about
[5:38] my dad uh growing up is when he said,
[5:40] "Where do we want to go eat?" And we
[5:42] could say, "Well, uh I don't know. Where
[5:45] can we go eat?" And if he said, "Uh,
[5:47] Masio's we could always go to Mazios.
[5:49] It's a pizza place. I don't know if they
[5:50] have them here, but if they had them
[5:52] here, foli.
[5:55] But that there was he would say, "I
[5:57] don't know. It doesn't matter. I don't
[5:58] care. Maybe masio." Like, "Okay, yeah,
[6:00] well, what about, you know, lubies or
[6:01] what about furs?" And I don't know. I
[6:03] mean, it doesn't matter. Masio would be
[6:04] good. And and you'd realize after a
[6:07] while, it doesn't really matter, does
[6:09] it? You got Masio's on repeat there. Do
[6:11] you stutter, Dad? What's going on? And
[6:13] you'd know that's what he wanted. And so
[6:15] no matter what everyone else wants,
[6:18] whenever you could all begin to agree
[6:20] that this is our aim
[6:22] and that where we're going, this may not
[6:23] have been what I wanted at first, but
[6:25] this is my aim and this is where we're
[6:27] going. Then that's when there's a
[6:29] there's a an alignment of aims. And and
[6:32] I thought about it that way because
[6:33] there's times when maybe we know what
[6:36] the right thing is to do and in our gut
[6:38] or not necessarily our gut, but there's
[6:41] something in our spirits that's kind of
[6:43] reluctant, doesn't necessarily feel
[6:45] really open to do it, but in your gut
[6:47] and in your heart, you know it's right.
[6:49] And so you might be one of those people
[6:51] that's really technical. Well, um do you
[6:54] do you want to do that? Well, I don't
[6:55] want to do it, but if you want me to do
[6:56] it, I'll do it. Okay? Uh and and so
[7:00] there's this idea where we could be uh
[7:02] acknowledged that there's something in
[7:04] my heart that's not fully accepting, but
[7:07] yet I choose this aim.
[7:10] I'm going to choose this path. This is
[7:11] the way I'm going to go. And so there is
[7:13] a subjection then of even our own will
[7:16] to his will.
[7:17] And I and I think that's what is
[7:19] embodied in the order my steps in thy
[7:21] word. And then even the strong man if
[7:24] his steps aren't ordered by the Lord his
[7:27] efforts will fail.
[7:29] So we ask this question of what is God's
[7:33] will for me this year
[7:36] and [clears throat] if I could put it
[7:38] this way
[7:40] that there may be uh
[7:44] I'm sure people have prayed this prayer.
[7:47] This is one of those there's somebody
[7:48] here with back pain things. Uh but I'm
[7:51] sure there's people who've prayed,
[7:52] "Lord, what is your will for me? And
[7:53] what is your will in this coming year
[7:55] and and sincere believers have
[7:57] considered all the promises they made in
[7:59] the past or uh the the what things were
[8:01] like last year and what they are now
[8:03] coming into a new year." And so we could
[8:05] find ourselves just at this this kind of
[8:07] juncture, it's really easy to begin to
[8:09] say, well, you know, what is your will
[8:11] for me this year? And I tried this and I
[8:13] tried that. What what what's going to uh
[8:16] raise up and identify itself for your
[8:18] plan for me in this year? So, I know
[8:19] it's very very relevant, maybe real
[8:21] lowhanging fruit or just maybe something
[8:23] very obvious for the day. Uh, but I
[8:25] think it's important to consider it and
[8:27] instead of trying to immediately try to
[8:31] figure out the very very specific things
[8:33] that Lord, should I enroll in this
[8:35] college or should I take these this many
[8:37] credit hours? Uh, let's just kind of
[8:39] back up a little bit and say that when
[8:40] we ask ourselves, what is God's will for
[8:42] me this year? there's going to be a
[8:44] process of identifying. Uh this is I
[8:47] would say this instead of maybe getting
[8:49] into the identification. It's an
[8:51] invitation to identify it. It's asking
[8:54] the question not that you would
[8:55] immediately try to write out the
[8:57] answers, but that you'd begin to ponder
[8:59] it and think over it. Uh because there
[9:01] may be some who I've already alluded to
[9:03] that have already asked this question
[9:04] and there may be others who never ask
[9:06] that question. I got I kind of just go
[9:08] with how I feel and what opportunities
[9:10] present themselves. And we kind of have
[9:12] this idea, WELL, YOU KNOW, THE STEPS OF
[9:13] A GOOD MAN are order of the Lord. And
[9:15] and we use that TO JUST SAY, AH, YOU
[9:18] KNOW, WHATEVER HAPPENS,
[9:20] I'm just going to KIND OF GO ALONG WITH
[9:22] IT. And hey, it's all predestinating
[9:24] anyhow, right? And so, we just kind of
[9:26] take it as it comes. It's kind of a
[9:27] fatalist idea, but this is an ident
[9:30] invitation to identify God's will for
[9:32] our lives. And if you can be successful
[9:35] in identifying it, actually choose it.
[9:39] like there there's this conscious
[9:41] acceptance, this constant choice uh uh
[9:44] conscious choice and then in choosing
[9:47] submitting to it.
[9:49] Amen.
[9:49] Yielding to it. I think brother Loyal
[9:51] mentioned it at the end of his service
[9:52] the I surrender all the surrendering to
[9:55] it and then acting according to it.
[9:58] This is what we are embodying in
[10:02] uh this what is God's will for me this
[10:05] year. Now, I think that's a
[10:07] [clears throat] very good very good
[10:09] start. Now, if we could turn in our
[10:11] Bibles to Isaiah chapter 14
[10:14] 13- 14. Uh, since we're looking at,
[10:19] and we've used these phrases already,
[10:20] your will, your desire, we're looking at
[10:22] desire, we're looking at choice. Uh, my
[10:25] father-in-law, Brother John Martin, and
[10:26] I were having a conversation just
[10:28] fellowshipping on the things of God. And
[10:29] he he made a couple statements that um
[10:32] really thoughtprovoking about how Satan
[10:35] in the beginning uh it wasn't that just
[10:38] all of a sudden a a switch flipped in
[10:41] him and he became evil and he was able
[10:43] to deceive all these angels in heaven.
[10:46] It was it was something that was working
[10:49] in him. And we were just fellowshipping
[10:50] on the process of of that wickedness and
[10:54] how it may have worked in heaven. And I
[10:56] had been uh this is something that
[10:58] really stood out to me on that is I was
[11:01] just thinking about where do you get to
[11:02] that point when now you begin to speak
[11:05] these things and act according to these
[11:07] things. And at what point did he even
[11:10] begin to think I know God knows and he's
[11:13] not doing anything about it. And then he
[11:15] he he he took that to be a weakness and
[11:18] just that the whole thought process that
[11:20] Satan was going through. Now, in Isaiah
[11:22] 14 13-4, there's a lot here, but I'm
[11:25] just wanting to bring one real obvious
[11:28] suspect out of this, and it says, "For
[11:30] thou hast said in thine heart," so this
[11:32] is something real uh deep within him, "I
[11:36] will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[11:38] throne above the stars. I will sit also
[11:40] upon the mount of the congregation in
[11:42] the sides of the north." Here is this
[11:46] uh three very distinct things. And
[11:48] there's going to find there's five
[11:49] different affirmations of his own will
[11:52] over God's will. And in verse 14, I I
[11:54] kind of looked at it as him kind of
[11:55] going back over what this process is
[11:58] going to accomplish. Ascend into heaven,
[12:00] exalt my throne, then sit. I'm going to
[12:02] have this place. I will ascend above the
[12:04] heights of the clouds. I will be like
[12:07] the most high.
[12:10] And this is we see the phrase. We we
[12:12] recognize it in his heart. Now he says,
[12:15] I will ascend. I will exalt. I will sit.
[12:18] I will ascend above. I will be. This is
[12:21] an exaltation of his will
[12:24] or a very precise detailed
[12:27] uh identification of what he wants.
[12:30] And so if there was such a thing as a
[12:32] new year and there were New Year's
[12:33] resolutions and somehow we found uh
[12:36] Lucifer's book of dirty secrets, it
[12:38] would be like I will ascend to heaven. I
[12:40] will exalt my I mean he had a a bucket
[12:42] list of a to-do list of things that he
[12:45] was going to do in in the new year in in
[12:48] in his this time of life in this season.
[12:51] And in Lucifer's heart we know that God
[12:54] says I create behold I create evil uh
[12:57] and he uses it for uh his own to
[12:59] accomplish his own his own purpose. But
[13:02] in Lucifer, this is maybe something very
[13:05] uh
[13:07] I I don't want to say difficult, but
[13:10] it's almost uh enjoyable to wrestle with
[13:13] because it it's thoughtprovoking, but in
[13:15] Lucifer's heart, there was a selfish
[13:18] pride something somehow it's there
[13:20] something he's something he's acting to
[13:21] according to this selfish pride and
[13:24] ambition because he said it in his heart
[13:26] and then what did he do? He acted on it.
[13:28] An ambition that formed into this
[13:31] resolve. I will be like the most high. I
[13:34] will exalt my throne. I will sit. And so
[13:36] he has this selfish pride, this ambition
[13:38] that forms itself into these resolutions
[13:40] and into this resolve of what he's going
[13:42] to do. And so this is very obvious. The
[13:45] use of the phrase I will is expressing
[13:48] his intentions.
[13:50] It expresses his desires. And if if we
[13:53] could put it this way, he's making he's
[13:56] asserting what his expectations are in
[13:58] the future. as some may have said over
[14:01] the last uh 24 hours or 48 hours uh this
[14:04] year, I will a and you're projecting
[14:08] something and you're asserting something
[14:09] about what the future's going to hold. I
[14:11] I I will do this. I will accomplish
[14:13] this. I want to do this. And so the
[14:15] expression of will and even that word
[14:18] will, it's a faculty by which a person
[14:20] decides on and initiates action. So it's
[14:24] your will that you use to decide on
[14:26] something and it's your will that you
[14:28] use to act on something. So when Satan
[14:30] says I will, his will led him to a
[14:33] choice and therefore it is his will that
[14:36] led him to act upon those choices.
[14:39] A will is a deliberate desire or
[14:41] attention, a fixed desire or intention.
[14:45] And if we say self-will, it kind of
[14:46] speaks to the stubbornness of that
[14:48] desire. But a will is a thing that one
[14:51] desires or ordains. Is everybody kind of
[14:54] you feel like you're with me to this
[14:55] point? I I I had no intention
[14:59] of being lengthy, but I haven't preached
[15:00] all year. And so I really I've just got
[15:02] to get it. I got to get started.
[15:05] [snorts]
[15:06] And Ephesians 1 11 this will kind I want
[15:10] to use this to get us to thinking about
[15:11] what will is. Now to bring a contrast
[15:14] says in whom also speaking of uh um
[15:18] uh speaking of Christ and God in whom
[15:21] also we've obtained an inheritance being
[15:23] predestinated according to the purpose
[15:24] of him. So it's in Christ we've obtained
[15:26] the inheritance according to the purpose
[15:28] of him God who workketh all things after
[15:30] the counsel of his own will. That's a
[15:33] very broad phrase the counsel of his own
[15:36] will. Now we realize that God has a
[15:38] purpose. God has a plan. I I still
[15:40] remember and it's a a constant reminder
[15:42] to me. Brother Kai Kyrie Digs preached
[15:45] God is intentional.
[15:47] Such a beautiful uh really clear
[15:49] distinct way of reminding us that if
[15:51] God's going to allow something, he pro
[15:52] he has a reason for it.
[15:54] So God is intentional. And now God then
[15:57] has a counsel of his own will. He has a
[16:01] deliberate or fixed desire. He has a
[16:03] faculty by which he chooses something
[16:05] and then initiates action. So God,
[16:08] there's this council of his own will. So
[16:12] Satan said, "I will. I will. I will." So
[16:14] he had a will. He had a desire. But now
[16:16] God has a will. Now this is where this
[16:20] is where I feel like it begins to get
[16:21] REALLY DEEP. GOD ACTS COMPLET ENTIRELY
[16:25] independent of outside influence.
[16:29] So God is is acting now according to the
[16:33] counsel of his own will. And you could
[16:36] take that phrase to say that he's not
[16:38] informed by any other council.
[16:41] Maybe taking a little bit of liberty
[16:42] with that, but that HE'S NOT INFORMED BY
[16:45] OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS. THERE'S NO
[16:47] influencer there.
[16:48] UH THERE'S NOT ANOTHER angel saying that
[16:50] sounds like a good idea, God. But you
[16:53] know, me and the boys were thinking,
[16:55] right? There's not HE'S NOT UP THERE
[16:59] DECIDING in a democratic process. He
[17:02] acts and has a will that is completely
[17:06] and entirely
[17:08] uninfluenced and not instigated or
[17:11] touched or moved by outside influence.
[17:14] If I can say this technically he is the
[17:16] true only true free moral agent.
[17:20] That's I know it could get deep. We
[17:22] could have some lunch conversations
[17:24] but in a in a technical sense he would
[17:26] be the only true free moral agent.
[17:29] Right.
[17:31] As AW Pink said, I think it's in the
[17:33] book Attributes of God. Author Pink, he
[17:35] says, "God is subject to none,
[17:37] influenced by none, absolutely
[17:39] independent."
[17:41] God does as he pleases, only as he
[17:43] pleases, always as he pleases.
[17:46] I'll tweet that out if you want to have
[17:47] it. Have it exactly. I LIKE THAT.
[17:50] SUBJECT TO NONE, INFLUENCED BY NONE,
[17:52] absolutely independent. GOD DOES AS HE
[17:56] PLEASES. ONLY AS HE PLEASES, always as
[17:58] he pleases. Now this is this is a very
[18:02] large thought. God can act independent
[18:04] of everyone else.
[18:06] AND ONLY GOD can act and not be guilty
[18:08] of evil.
[18:10] But Lucifer's act according to his will
[18:14] uh was influenced by selfishness and
[18:15] pride. Therefore, the result of that
[18:17] choice is wickedness. The result of that
[18:19] is evil.
[18:21] And so there is a
[18:24] a will
[18:28] and and and drawing from the scriptural
[18:29] meaning of this and even just the actual
[18:31] meaning is when when one exercises their
[18:35] will, it's this deliberate it's it's
[18:37] control that's deliberately exercised.
[18:40] A and it is to do something or to
[18:42] actually restrain your own impulses. It
[18:44] takes will to do that. We call it
[18:46] willpower. SO YOU COULD HAVE SOME
[18:49] uncction to do something but you use
[18:51] willpower to say no don't do it. Uh you
[18:53] could there could be something that is
[18:55] needful and you have to KIND OF WILL
[18:57] YOURSELF INTO IT. YOU KIND OF HAVE TO uh
[18:59] uh use you know dig down deep and FIND
[19:01] SOMETHING TO ALLOW YOURSELF TO DO IT.
[19:03] This is what will is when we talk about
[19:05] will. This is what we're referring to.
[19:07] There may be other wills here or
[19:09] Williams or old will as we call them but
[19:11] we're talking about the word will to
[19:13] desire something to have a a a want. And
[19:16] it's this control THAT'S DELIBERATELY
[19:18] EXERCISED TO DO SOMETHING or not to do
[19:20] something. The Bible says in Acts 2:23,
[19:22] him being delivered by the determinate
[19:25] counsel and fornowledge of God. Speaking
[19:27] of Christ, notice this, Christ was
[19:29] delivered by the determinate counsel and
[19:31] fornowledge of God, ye have taken and by
[19:34] wicked hands have crucified and slain
[19:36] him.
[19:38] You have by your own determinate counsel
[19:41] and fornowledge of God. SO GOD HAS
[19:43] FORNOWLEDGE. He has a will that can act
[19:45] according to for his own fornowledge a
[19:48] and he has this he's completely
[19:49] influenced by his will by his own
[19:52] counsel and it was by his determinate
[19:55] counsel and fornowledge that he allowed
[19:57] Christ to be delivered up but notice
[20:00] those that did it had wicked hands
[20:03] you ask yourself and that's what Paul is
[20:05] wrestling with well how can the clay
[20:08] object [clears throat]
[20:09] and just say oh well you made me this
[20:10] way
[20:13] but it God who had this determinate
[20:15] counsel and fornowledge and then it's
[20:18] others who make their own choice
[20:20] to be on the wrong side of that
[20:22] and even that determined council speaks
[20:24] of a horizon something forwardlooking
[20:28] now in Genesis chapter 2 16 and 17 as we
[20:31] read it in the outset
[20:33] we see that Satan had a will God had a
[20:35] will in the very very beginning Satan
[20:38] had his own agenda will in heaven and
[20:40] now in the garden God is telling telling
[20:43] them that of the trees that grow fruit,
[20:46] every tree of the garden that growth
[20:48] from the ground, you may freely eat. So
[20:51] that's offering to him this freedom or
[20:54] this liberty to eat of these fruits. And
[20:56] then he says, "But of the tree of
[20:58] knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
[20:59] not eat of it. Uh for the day that thou
[21:01] eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die."
[21:03] Now he is not speaking it in terms of an
[21:06] absolute prohibition in that he is
[21:09] unable to do it
[21:11] but he's saying you can but you
[21:13] shouldn't.
[21:14] So even in this God is giving Adam a
[21:18] choice and the access to take of this
[21:21] tree and it's not he says of that tree
[21:23] of knowledge of good and evil you can't
[21:24] even eat of it there. It's impossible.
[21:26] I've sealed it away. Uh you may want to
[21:28] but you won't be able to. He's saying
[21:30] you have the trees that you can eat of
[21:32] that are fruit. you. They're good to
[21:33] eat. You may freely eat of of your own
[21:35] free will, of your own choosing. And
[21:37] there's this other these other things.
[21:39] There's this other thing here that
[21:41] you'll be ABLE TO IF YOU WANT, but you
[21:44] when you do, there's a consequence.
[21:47] And this is where we see brother Ram
[21:49] touches on it quite a bit that God gives
[21:52] then in this scripture, God gives the
[21:54] man and the woman the freedom to choose.
[21:57] If we say this way, he gave them agency.
[21:59] They could choose. They just weren't
[22:00] programmed. they could make choices and
[22:03] the phrase free more agency we brother
[22:06] Brandham uses it quite often and we're
[22:09] free more agents placed on free moral
[22:10] agency and it's actually a very
[22:12] controversial subject
[22:14] and I find that when brother Brandham is
[22:16] using it he's not using it in a
[22:18] theological sense you know how the
[22:20] Christian scientist would use it or how
[22:22] a philosopher would use it because they
[22:24] get down they will break it down to what
[22:26] free means what moral means what agency
[22:28] means and they get into this they kind
[22:30] of get into real uh uh heady subjects on
[22:33] the matter and it is a very
[22:34] controversial subject but brother
[22:35] Brandham uses it to mean that we simp it
[22:38] simply means we have a choice to make or
[22:40] we are given an opportunity to choose
[22:44] and where this is balanced out and maybe
[22:46] this is my way of acknowledging the
[22:48] controversy because some people take
[22:50] free moral agency to mean that if I am
[22:52] free moral agent then I am free to
[22:54] choose what I believe is moral and
[22:56] choose and therefore that is what is
[22:59] right that I choose what is moral. I
[23:01] choose what is right. I choose what is
[23:02] good and therefore I having this type of
[23:05] autonomy. Uh then every man is right in
[23:08] his own eyes. And then the other side
[23:09] kicks back and says no, we are not free
[23:11] moral agents and therefore not being
[23:12] free moral agencies. How could God be a
[23:14] just God to condemn us if we're not even
[23:16] acting according and making choices? But
[23:18] we know according to the word and I'll
[23:20] amplify this here in a few uh in a few
[23:22] through a few scriptures. We have a
[23:24] choice.
[23:26] uh and when I say that I'm not
[23:28] necessarily identifying WHAT IT IS IN
[23:29] but in general there's choices that we
[23:31] are allowed to make but our choice
[23:34] however is never greater than God's
[23:35] sovereignty.
[23:38] So our choices we can make choices all
[23:40] day long but it's not going to undermine
[23:41] God's sovereignty. And so again just
[23:44] acknowledge there's a huge debate
[23:45] regarding free will but we want to just
[23:47] express every person has a will and a
[23:51] power to choose according to their
[23:52] desires on some level.
[23:53] Sure. And so you have man in the
[23:56] beginning placed upon this basis of
[23:58] freedom to choose given THE FREEDOM OF
[24:00] CHOICE. WHAT HAPPENED? They made the
[24:02] wrong choice. The wrong choice was made.
[24:04] They had the will and they acted upon
[24:07] it. And so you see God has a will and he
[24:09] has a desire in in in heaven. A and
[24:12] Satan had his own desire in heaven. Now
[24:14] in the very garden of Eden, we see that
[24:16] the will of Satan is now influencing the
[24:19] woman to choose this other tree to
[24:22] partake of it. And this was a choice
[24:25] that she made. She she fell through that
[24:27] choice. Now Jesus also expresses this
[24:31] and I think this is where
[24:33] uh it becomes very pronounced to us if
[24:35] there's this freedom to choose if God by
[24:37] determined counsel and fornowledge
[24:38] offered up his son as a sacrifice and
[24:41] these things were done according to the
[24:42] fornowledge of God. Yet we see Christ
[24:44] here in Matthew 26:39
[24:47] says and Jesus is in the garden of
[24:49] Gethsemane praying. And he went a little
[24:50] further and fell on his face and prayed,
[24:52] saying, "Oh my father, if it be
[24:55] possible, let this cup pass from me."
[24:58] Now, what cup is he referring to? His
[25:00] crucifixion, his death, if we could just
[25:02] be very uh very succinct and general
[25:04] about it. And Jesus KNOWS THAT'S WHAT
[25:07] HE'S COMING INTO THE WORLD TO DO.
[25:09] He's prophesied, I'll resurrect in three
[25:11] days. He's prophesied that these things
[25:13] will happen. HE'S ALREADY TOLD HIM
[25:14] WHAT'S HE'S GOING TO BE DELIVERED. AND
[25:16] PETER'S ALREADY SAID, NO, I'LL GO WITH
[25:17] YOU EVEN TO TO DEATH. I MEAN, HE HE
[25:19] KNOWS what's happening, but yet we get
[25:21] some private insight into Jesus as he
[25:25] HAS THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE FATHER.
[25:27] IF IT'S POSSIBLE, let this pass from me.
[25:31] Right?
[25:31] IN OTHER WORDS, IF IF I CAN AVOID IT, I
[25:34] I KNOW THIS SEEMS TO BE SO CLEARLY AND
[25:36] IT'S BEEN PROPHESIED AND THIS IS WHAT
[25:38] YOU WANT AND this is what I came into
[25:39] the world to be and THIS IS WHAT MY
[25:41] WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN FORESHADOWING.
[25:43] WHETHER FROM BEING BORN IN THE MANGER TO
[25:45] BEING BAPTIZED IN THE JORDAN, IT'S ALL
[25:46] BEEN POINTED TO THIS MOH MOMENT. BUT OH
[25:49] GOD, IF YOU COULD JUST IF I COULD BYPASS
[25:51] IT.
[25:53] In other words, Jesus saying, I don't
[25:56] really want to do this.
[26:00] If it was my will, I wouldn't have to
[26:02] die. So, he says, "Nevertheless, not as
[26:05] I will." Might have caught some of you
[26:07] are saying, "No, that's not what he's
[26:08] saying." Well, yeah. [laughter]
[26:09] Not as I will. What was his will? Let
[26:11] this cup pass. NOT AS I DESIRE. Not as I
[26:14] want. Not as what I would choose. Never
[26:16] this not as I will but as thou wilt.
[26:20] Can we just look at it on its face AND
[26:21] REALIZE THAT GOD had determined it, but
[26:24] Jesus still wrestles with his choice
[26:27] and his part in it?
[26:30] There's a grace to be uh ex exercised in
[26:33] this to realize that in this moment and
[26:36] in this time of there being uh uh him
[26:38] coming to the very purpose of his
[26:40] ministry, he expresses, "Oh, if I could
[26:42] somehow not do this, if if you let me
[26:45] have what I want, Lord, I I WOULD WANT A
[26:47] DIFFERENT WAY." BUT HE SAYS, "I HAVE A
[26:49] WILL. YOU HAVE A WILL. I don't want my
[26:52] will. Let your will be done."
[26:54] And and a few verses later, he revisits
[26:57] it and he says, "He went away again the
[26:59] second time and prayed saying, "Oh my
[27:01] father, IF THIS CUP MAY NOT PASS AWAY
[27:03] FROM me except I drink it, thy will be
[27:07] done."
[27:08] What a prayer.
[27:10] If it's not possible, I if your will
[27:12] cannot if this what you desire and what
[27:14] needs to happen cannot be accomplished
[27:17] except I go to this death, then let thy
[27:20] will be done.
[27:23] In fact, I say this, he demonstrates the
[27:25] best way to find God's perfect will when
[27:27] you're praying about something
[27:28] or when you're when when you're wanting
[27:30] to know, it's prayer.
[27:32] When you want to know, the best way to
[27:33] know God's will for your life is prayer.
[27:34] Amen.
[27:36] And when you're trying in a difficult
[27:37] matter, in a situation where it's not
[27:38] clear, the best thing you could do is
[27:40] pray. It's not necessarily I know
[27:41] there's a little bit of a uh a lot of
[27:44] emphasis placed on becoming neutral. But
[27:47] the the the best way is not necessarily
[27:49] getting neutral.
[27:51] The best way is praying.
[27:52] Amen.
[27:54] And even identifying your will and his
[27:57] will.
[27:57] That's good.
[27:58] And if I could put it this way, not
[27:59] being neutral.
[28:00] Right.
[28:01] Right.
[28:02] Because if there's a right way and a
[28:04] wrong way, which one of you are neutral?
[28:07] Let's just get real.
[28:09] I I can do this or I can do that. One's
[28:11] right, one's wrong. Like, nah, it
[28:12] doesn't matter to me. So, really, it
[28:14] doesn't matter. Like, you'll do the
[28:16] wrong one. Yeah. I mean, I'm neutral.
[28:19] I'm good. So, in one way, when we just
[28:21] begin to think about IT LOGICALLY,
[28:23] REALIZE, NO, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
[28:24] WHOA, WHOA. I I I don't really I'm not
[28:27] neutral. I'm acknowledging as Jesus did.
[28:30] Jesus acknowledged the wrestling. HE
[28:32] ACKNOWLEDGED A DIFFERENT DESIRE. HE'S
[28:34] POURING HIS HEART OUT. THIS IS HOW YOU
[28:35] can pray in difficult times and
[28:37] DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO FIND GOD'S WILL
[28:39] IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE, BE HONEST BEFORE THE
[28:41] LORD. ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
[28:43] ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT YOU'RE going through
[28:44] and he's acknowledging the the different
[28:46] desire, BUT ULTIMATELY HE YIELDS TO
[28:49] GOD'S will
[28:50] and he acts upon it. He he follows in
[28:53] it. He yields to it. So Jesus is showing
[28:56] that in A IN A TIME WHEN MAYBE YOU KNOW
[28:59] WHAT GOD'S WILL is that YOU CAN IDENTIFY
[29:02] IT'S NOT YOUR DESIRE, it's not your
[29:04] will, BUT YOU MUST make a CHOICE TO DO
[29:08] HIS WILL.
[29:10] And sometimes we find ourselves uh stuck
[29:12] in neutral because we find that this is
[29:15] what God wants me to do and I'm not
[29:16] going to do anything until I want to do
[29:18] it too.
[29:19] Right? Can anybody just be honest today?
[29:22] 2023, the year of honesty. And we're
[29:25] gonna BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES. YOU
[29:26] KNOW, THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY EXACTLY HOW
[29:27] IT WORKS. I KNOW THIS is what HE WANTS
[29:29] DONE. I KNOW THIS IS THE RIGHT THING OR
[29:31] I know this is what I need to do. And
[29:33] maybe it's not even in terms of what God
[29:34] wants you to do. It might just be
[29:36] something that you know you need to do.
[29:37] This is your obligation. This is your
[29:39] duty. And you know what you should, but
[29:41] you don't really want to. SO, YOU'RE
[29:42] JUST SAYING UNTIL I WILL TO. UNTIL I
[29:45] WANT TO, I'm not going to do it. But I'm
[29:47] telling you what you need to do IS
[29:49] CHOOSE THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO
[29:51] DO BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT
[29:53] THING.
[29:56] In Deuteronomy 30 19 he says, "I call
[29:58] heaven and earth record this day against
[30:00] you that I have set before you life and
[30:02] death, blessing and cursing. Therefore,
[30:04] choose life that both thou and thy seed
[30:07] may live."
[30:09] It's kind of hard to come to a
[30:11] conclusion that God does not allow a
[30:12] choice
[30:14] when he tells us, "I've set before you
[30:17] blessing and cursing,
[30:19] life and death." He says, "Choose life."
[30:22] Says in Joshua 24:15, "Choose you this
[30:24] day whom you'll serve." The gods on the
[30:26] other side of the flood or or the God of
[30:27] Israel, the God of Isaac and Abraham,
[30:30] Isaac, and Jacob. Who who are you going
[30:32] to serve? There's a choice that is made.
[30:35] So I say we have a will and we have a
[30:37] choice
[30:39] and we we must not be fatalist when it
[30:42] comes to uh well just whatever happens
[30:45] happens and also there's we cannot abuse
[30:47] determinism. Well it's all laid out it's
[30:49] always going to happen. We have to
[30:51] realize that we have a choice.
[30:54] There's things that we have a choice in.
[30:56] we can choose
[30:59] and
[31:01] I I maybe we'll just have to
[31:04] visit this to a greater degree.
[31:08] But one of the things that becomes the
[31:10] reason why I could say this about God,
[31:11] he may be the only true free moral agent
[31:14] is he can act independent of outside
[31:16] influence. But we ourselves
[31:20] are it's impossible
[31:24] for us to to to say that we're acting
[31:28] completely free
[31:30] of any kind of suggestion
[31:32] uh genetics
[31:34] programming influence
[31:37] and and even in that we can't even call
[31:41] upon God unless he deals with our heart
[31:43] first.
[31:44] So when we look at our freedom to
[31:45] choose, we're not becoming greater and
[31:48] we're not the decider. President Bush
[31:50] would say we're not the decider, but we
[31:52] we have to choose.
[31:55] And what I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT AT
[31:57] LEAST TO THIS point is in Genesis
[32:00] chapter 2, in Matthew chapter 26,
[32:02] Deuteronomy 30, we could have gone into
[32:03] Joshua 24, the the choices THAT ARE SET
[32:07] BEFORE THEM. CHOOSE WHICH GODS you'll
[32:09] serve, the false gods or the true God. I
[32:11] HAVE PUT BEFORE YOU BLESSING AND CURSE.
[32:12] IF I GAVE YOU a choice today, behind
[32:14] curtain number one is blessing, behind
[32:15] curtain number two is cursing, uh, which
[32:17] one do you choose? I mean, except for
[32:19] maybe some troublemakers or some guys
[32:20] with a funny sense of humor, I we
[32:23] probably all say, "Give me the blessing.
[32:24] I CHOOSE THE BLESSING." SO, IF I COULD
[32:26] PUT IT THIS WAY, IN ONE SENSE, each one
[32:29] of THESE INSTANCES, THE CHOICE SEEMS
[32:31] VERY, very obvious.
[32:33] Sure.
[32:34] I would I would say so.
[32:36] It seems obvious.
[32:39] And in a lot of ways, I would say that
[32:42] God's will for us sometimes is obvious.
[32:45] But just to reinforce this that we've
[32:47] got to choose. We have to make a choice.
[32:49] Brother Brandon in the sermon, a man
[32:50] running from the presence of the Lord
[32:51] says, "And when you see then in this day
[32:53] now when the word of God has made these
[32:55] promises of things that we seen we see
[32:57] happening now," and I think that really
[33:00] identifies quite a bit taking place.
[33:02] Then we've got the responsibility to
[33:04] either face up to it or get away from
[33:06] it.
[33:07] That's good. You can't stay neutral.
[33:11] This is the idea of I I'm trying to I'm
[33:14] wanting us to to act and to move and not
[33:17] languish and kind of be stuck in neutral
[33:20] or kind of in the middle. H I don't
[33:22] know. I don't know. There's there needs
[33:23] to be something that compels us and
[33:25] moves us forward. And brother says you
[33:27] can't stay neutral. So, if we get it in
[33:28] our minds that I want to kind of get to
[33:30] this place of zen where my mind is just
[33:32] empty and everything's just blank and
[33:34] and I'm just an empty canvas and
[33:36] whatever whatever's painted and whatever
[33:38] happens is what's going to happen. No,
[33:40] WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT of that. And he
[33:42] says we have to recognize that God is
[33:44] doing the things that he promised he
[33:46] would do. And we all have a duty or a
[33:48] RESPONSIBILITY TO EITHER STEP UP TO IT,
[33:51] TAKE IT UH TAKE A HOLD OF IT. HE SAYS
[33:53] FACE UP TO IT OR GET AWAY FROM IT. YOU
[33:55] CAN'T STAY NEUTRAL,
[33:57] RIGHT? AND HE SAYS, "YOU'VE GOT TO DO
[33:59] SOMETHING ABOUT IT." SO GOD DOES
[34:02] [screaming] NOT UH THAT GOD THERE'S
[34:04] ALWAYS GOD ALL HIS WORD ALWAYS evokes a
[34:07] response.
[34:08] Amen.
[34:08] That that even in the description of him
[34:10] CASTING BREAD UPON THE WATER AND GOD'S
[34:12] WORD not coming back VOID THAT IF IT
[34:15] GOES FORTH, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
[34:16] COME OUT OF IT. HE'S LOOKING FOR SOME
[34:18] RESPONSE. HE'S LOOKING FOR YOU TO DO
[34:20] SOMETHING to it. IT IT'S NEVER JUST
[34:22] SOMETHING THAT'S JUST IN ONE EAR AND OUT
[34:24] THE OTHER AND WE GO BACK TO LIVING OUR
[34:25] LIVES. THE WORD WHICH WE are hearing,
[34:27] the things that we're experiencing, THE
[34:29] TIME THAT WE'RE LIVING IN NOW, THERE'S
[34:30] THINGS THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO about the
[34:33] word that we are hearing.
[34:36] He says some move has got to be made.
[34:39] And then he makes this statement which I
[34:41] think we all are very familiar with. He
[34:43] says you can't come in that church door
[34:44] and go out the same person you come in.
[34:48] I mean, if we take that, if we really
[34:50] believe that in our heart,
[34:51] then if there was a way that we could
[34:53] kind of just take our temperature when
[34:54] we walked in
[34:56] and what does it read when we get out,
[34:58] right?
[34:59] If you were if you were lukewarm when
[35:01] you came in, he says you you're not
[35:03] going to walk out the same person.
[35:06] You're either further away or closer to
[35:07] God
[35:08] every time you come in or go out there.
[35:11] And and I think I think it's important
[35:12] to have that kind of mindset. That way
[35:14] you establish this expectation that as
[35:16] soon as I've come to church, I'm either
[35:18] better off when I leave. I'm e either
[35:21] going to be better off or worse off.
[35:24] And maybe some people have just accepted
[35:25] they're always worse off, so they don't
[35:26] come.
[35:28] Uh maybe some people don't like the
[35:30] better, right? The better off it makes
[35:32] them, so they don't come. But you either
[35:35] are further away or closer to God every
[35:37] time you come in or go out there.
[35:40] He says, "You've got a choice. You've
[35:41] got something. you've got something to
[35:43] do. Some move has got to be made. So,
[35:47] we've asked, we're asking the question,
[35:48] what is God's will for me this year?
[35:52] You will have a will
[35:55] and you can choose according to that
[35:56] will
[35:59] your your own control to do something,
[36:01] to exercise something, to do something.
[36:03] But then there's also God's will. And if
[36:06] your will and his will lines up, that's
[36:08] awesome,
[36:09] right? Then ch identify, choose, act, uh
[36:12] submit, go, go forward. Something a move
[36:15] has to be made. If your will, you know
[36:18] what you want, BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT
[36:20] HIS IS, THEN YOU WANT TO FIND HIS.
[36:23] AND IF YOU IDENTIFY HIS AND IT'S NOT
[36:25] QUITE YOURS, DON'T USE THIS PART AS AN
[36:27] EXCUSE TO NOT CHOOSE HIS.
[36:30] SUBMIT AND ACT.
[36:32] So now we could take this thought, what
[36:34] is God's will for me this year? And if
[36:36] we can identify that, then we know
[36:38] that's something that's positive. I can
[36:39] act on that regardless of how I feel.
[36:41] In Revelations 3:3, this was maybe a New
[36:44] Year's scripture that I thought of last
[36:46] week. Says, "Remember therefore how thou
[36:48] hast received and heard." And when he
[36:51] says, "How thou hast received and heard
[36:53] it." Really all-encompassing of this
[36:54] gospel that been preached to them. They
[36:55] received it with joy. They were glad
[36:57] when they heard it. They received it.
[36:58] And so they're to remember the gospel,
[37:01] the word they received that they'd heard
[37:03] and hold fast and repent. There's so
[37:05] much being lifted up in here. If
[37:07] therefore thou shalt not watch, I will
[37:10] come on thee as a thief, thou shalt not
[37:12] know what hour I will come upon thee.
[37:13] And it certainly has an image of
[37:14] judgment. So he's telling them in
[37:17] Revelations 3:3, remember. So this act
[37:20] of calling to mind, consider to
[37:23] remember, you're recalling something.
[37:24] It's kind of this act of looking back.
[37:27] And it's in remembering there to
[37:30] remember the word that they had received
[37:32] and then to give careful consideration
[37:34] of their current state. So it's not just
[37:37] oh you remember this but now it's like
[37:39] remember this and kind of follow the
[37:40] breadcrumbs to where they are now. So
[37:42] it's remember what you've received AND
[37:43] HEARD HOLD FAST TO THAT WHICH YOU'VE
[37:46] HEARD and received and if you're short
[37:48] in any way repent of it. Says if thou
[37:51] THEREFORE SHALT NOT WATCH. SO THIS
[37:53] WATCHING as this watching then I think
[37:55] calls back to that sentence TO WHERE
[37:57] THERE'S THIS process of always keeping
[37:59] in mind what you've HEARD AND RECEIVED
[38:02] HOLDING FAST to it and BEING QUICK TO
[38:04] LINE UP IF YOU DON'T MEASURE BECAUSE IF
[38:06] YOU'RE NOT WATCHING IF YOU'RE not
[38:07] auditing if you're not keeping track
[38:09] THEN THAT'S WHEN THE JUDGMENT comes and
[38:12] it made me think of THE CONCEPT OF A
[38:14] WATCH night service and this is
[38:16] something that is uh very traditional a
[38:18] lot of even denominations and uh in
[38:20] different circles and and had a
[38:22] prominence in in certain types of
[38:24] churches at one time. And the whole idea
[38:26] of a watch night service is to review
[38:29] the past year, confess any wrongs that
[38:31] have been made within the past year, and
[38:33] then there's this praying, this prayer
[38:35] and resolve to change in the coming
[38:37] year. And and that's what a watch night
[38:39] service is. A lot of times it's
[38:40] testimonies about what God has done. A
[38:42] and and there's this process of Lord,
[38:44] these great things you've done and these
[38:46] things that I didn't do or should have
[38:47] done and and things I did I shouldn't
[38:49] have done and Lord, forgive me. And now
[38:50] I resolve in this new year to see to do
[38:53] this and to do that. This is kind of the
[38:54] process that takes place even in watch
[38:57] night services. And and and and again
[39:00] there's that's that's just observation.
[39:02] I'm not trying to put it in one category
[39:03] or the other. I'm not trying to set
[39:05] before you blessing or cursing in that.
[39:08] And traditionally I even this day the
[39:10] yesterday and today the the 31st of
[39:12] December of 2022 and the first day of
[39:14] 2023. This is a moment when all people
[39:17] do this whether in a religious context
[39:20] or a Christian context or SOME OTHER
[39:22] RELIGIOUS CONTEXT or just even in a
[39:24] personal development context. Um and
[39:27] it's a good practice to look back. So
[39:29] it's kind of a um debriefing say well
[39:31] let's kind of go back over what happened
[39:33] this past year and we set a budget. Did
[39:35] we keep it? And we wanted to save this
[39:36] much money. Did we do it? I wanted to
[39:38] LOSE THIS MUCH WEIGHT. WHOA. I GAINED
[39:40] that much. Instructions were unclear.
[39:42] Um, and and there's just different
[39:43] THINGS YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AND YOU TRY
[39:45] TO FIGURE OUT AND and that's what
[39:47] everyone does. All right, show hands if
[39:50] you've done anything like this for the
[39:51] last 72 hours. I'm glad I got one
[39:54] person. Was that a stretch or was a hand
[39:56] raised? Hey, we've all we we do this.
[39:59] This is a traditional moment. Or maybe
[40:01] you all knew this is what I was going to
[40:02] preach on. We're not going to do
[40:03] anything for a week. [laughter]
[40:08] We're not going to think about the past.
[40:09] and I can think about the future to let
[40:11] our minds go blank and be an empty
[40:12] canvas.
[40:17] And I would say that if you haven't done
[40:19] it, you're really missing out on a great
[40:20] opportunity because the change of year
[40:22] provides the perfect dynamics for that
[40:25] kind of endeavor.
[40:27] And there's a lot of in successful
[40:28] corporate cultures and successful
[40:30] entities and businesses and
[40:31] organizations have these checkup points
[40:34] where they go back and they review what
[40:36] is done, what you know, this is what we
[40:38] said we would do. this was the process.
[40:40] This is what did we accomplish it? If
[40:41] not, why didn't we? Now, in these next
[40:44] 30 days, this next quarter, this next
[40:45] year, what do we need to change in order
[40:47] to meet these needs? It's it's it's
[40:49] something that's very good to do. It's
[40:50] good practices. And the change of year
[40:53] gives us that opportunity to stop and
[40:55] say, "All right, there's going to be a
[40:56] new year. I can look back on a 12-month
[40:58] cycle. I can begin to identify certain
[41:00] things and be entering into a new one."
[41:02] And it gives us a nice opportunity, a
[41:03] great day to weigh yourself and to
[41:05] determine how much weight you're going
[41:06] to lose or a great day to start certain
[41:08] things. And and and there's that's just
[41:10] what the time affords us. Now, this is
[41:11] very very cliche, but I hope that in the
[41:14] way that I've set it up to this point,
[41:15] you realize I'm dealing in a realm
[41:17] that's not just your typical let's make
[41:19] a resolution to love God more in this
[41:21] coming year.
[41:22] But I want to draw your attention to
[41:24] something called the doorway effect.
[41:26] Anybody familiar with the doorway
[41:28] effect?
[41:31] Uh oh,
[41:32] I should have brought the other notes. I
[41:35] can I can explain this to you very
[41:36] easily. The doorway effect. And all a
[41:39] bunch of you like, "Oh yeah, I
[41:42] remember." But it's forgetfulness when
[41:44] moving between rooms.
[41:48] You knew it before you walked in the
[41:49] door, but you forgot it.
[41:52] And so this so it's it's the phenomena
[41:55] and it's just the simple example of it.
[41:57] Sometimes we forget what we're doing and
[41:59] you know what we're looking for, what we
[42:01] were supposed to do when we enter a
[42:02] room. You get up out of bed. You walk
[42:04] into the pantry and you're like,
[42:09] "What am I doing in here? Where's the
[42:11] chocolatecovered cherries?" Right? You
[42:13] you you don't you forget why you're
[42:14] there. And they've observed this
[42:16] phenomen. We've all experienced it. And
[42:17] they call it the doorway effect that you
[42:20] you forget what your intention was. YOU
[42:24] FORGET WHY YOU'RE THERE. you you you
[42:26] what was I here for? What did I need to
[42:27] get? What was I supposed to do? AND ALL
[42:30] THAT HAS HAPPENED IS you were you were
[42:31] someplace said, "I need to go turn uh
[42:34] the boiling water off the the stove and
[42:37] you walk through a door and you get in
[42:39] the kitchen and you forget what you're
[42:40] there for."
[42:41] Anybody? AMEN. WE'RE THERE. YEAH. OH,
[42:44] GLORY. [laughter]
[42:48] And they and as they've studied this,
[42:50] they've done different studies. to kind
[42:51] of verify this and you all are at least
[42:53] anecdotal evidence that yeah, I know
[42:54] what you're talking about.
[42:56] They speculate that what happens is that
[42:58] when you're in one room and you form an
[43:00] intent and you want to go do something
[43:01] or you have something in your mind that
[43:03] walking through the doorway divides your
[43:06] memory
[43:07] that that that once you've walked
[43:08] through this doorway like whatever you
[43:10] were thinking about then now it kind of
[43:11] creates this other loop and your memory
[43:13] gets divided. So now you kind of get
[43:15] disconnected a little bit.
[43:17] And they even speculate that maybe
[43:19] what's happening is that your memory
[43:21] resets to make room for a new event.
[43:24] And so it's just some sort of process
[43:26] that our brain would engage in that
[43:27] you're in a room, you want to do
[43:29] something that but walking through into
[43:30] a new room in this new environment. Now
[43:32] your brain gets ready and your memor is
[43:34] getting ready for a new event to process
[43:36] information and maybe there's even some
[43:38] learned behavior and habits there that
[43:40] when you walk into this room, this is
[43:41] what you typically do. So there might be
[43:42] some shadows there. And again, this is
[43:44] there's a lot in this particular area.
[43:46] But this doorway effect then is
[43:48] described as passing through an entrance
[43:51] or through a doorway and then forgetting
[43:53] what your motive was, what your intent
[43:55] was, and what you're wanting to do
[43:57] because of the doorway.
[43:59] And I want to I AND SINCE WE ALL KNOW
[44:01] WHAT THAT IS, let's not let the doorway
[44:04] effect be triggered
[44:06] by entering into a new year. Amen.
[44:09] That by by entering into this this
[44:11] entering a new year and STEPPING OFF
[44:13] INTO ANOTHER CALENDAR, WE DO NOT WANT
[44:15] the to trigger the doorway effect ON
[44:18] WHAT WE'VE HEARD AND WHAT WE'VE RECEIVED
[44:21] BECAUSE REVELATION SAYS, "REMEMBER WHAT
[44:23] THOU HAST RECEIVED AND HEARD." I think
[44:24] maybe one of the things sometimes THAT
[44:26] WE DO TOO MUCH OF IS LOOKING BACK ON
[44:28] WHAT WE DON'T LIKE AND WHAT WE NEED TO
[44:30] CHANGE AND THEN SOMEHOW PROMISING WE'RE
[44:32] GOING TO CHANGE THINGS IN THE FUTURE.
[44:34] BUT THE BIBLE DOES DISTINCTLY TELL US TO
[44:37] REMEMBER THAT REAL WORD THAT you've
[44:39] received to bring it to MIND AND HOLD
[44:42] FAST TO IT AND REPENT IF YOU'RE NOT
[44:45] LINING UP WITH IT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT
[44:47] WATCHING THAT THAT'S WHEN JUDGMENT
[44:49] COMES.
[44:51] And so we want to remember what we have
[44:53] received and HEARD TO NOT FORGET THEM
[44:56] BUT HOLD FAST TO THEM. YES.
[44:58] And this remembrance isn't the function
[45:00] of looking backwards,
[45:02] but even as it's said in the scripture,
[45:05] it's it's the idea of considering where
[45:08] you are now, like how you got there.
[45:11] You recognizing where you are. You ever
[45:14] been in a conversation and ended up
[45:16] somewhere like how did we get here? And
[45:17] you try to trace back
[45:19] to where you were so that you can get
[45:22] some context to where you are,
[45:24] right? Like wait, what are we doing
[45:26] here? Like when you walk through a
[45:27] doorway and you're like, why am I
[45:29] standing in the kitchen in front of a
[45:30] pot of boiling water? And you you work
[45:33] your way back to that moment to realize
[45:35] that's right. That's why I'm here where
[45:36] I am. Remembering is not just the
[45:40] function of looking backwards, but it's
[45:42] reinforcing what we know.
[45:44] It's remember it's here in the
[45:44] scripture. It's what we believe. Knowing
[45:46] what we remembering what we believe,
[45:47] reinforcing what we believe, identifying
[45:50] why God's put us where we are today, why
[45:52] you're here now. Yes.
[45:55] Because there's a lot of caution that
[45:56] Brother Brandham gives at this time. We
[45:58] make New Year's resolutions and turning
[45:59] pages. Brother Brandham says we just
[46:00] need to burn the whole book.
[46:03] He talks a lot about and it kind of ties
[46:04] into what brother Loyal was preaching on
[46:06] that we don't need more promises. We
[46:07] need new creatures in Christ. He says in
[46:10] the message shalom. I hope I hope you
[46:12] all took time to take in that service on
[46:14] Sunday. He says we're not going to have
[46:16] a rearview mirror affair. He says this
[46:18] theme several times in these services
[46:20] during this time of year. The rearview
[46:21] mirror only looks back and sees where
[46:23] you've been.
[46:24] So, he's not completely tearing the
[46:27] rearview mirror out off, but he's saying
[46:28] it's not just a rearview mirror affair.
[46:30] This is not the main thing. He says
[46:33] we're looking forward to see where we're
[46:34] going.
[46:36] So, what I'm what I'm wanting to express
[46:38] to you today, and I feel like I'm
[46:39] running out of time in doing it, is I'm
[46:41] not when I ask what is God's will for me
[46:43] this year, I I'm not I'm not looking at
[46:45] traditional New Year's resolutions.
[46:49] But says, "And if God be with us, then
[46:50] where are all where is all the
[46:52] miracles?" He says, "Not for a New
[46:54] Year's resolution because we don't make
[46:56] them. Don't do no good. You break them."
[46:59] And all the church said,
[47:01] "Amen." He said, "I see my daddy throw
[47:03] the plug of tobacco away every New
[47:05] Year's night to watch where he throwed
[47:07] it so he could get it the next day."
[47:10] Ding. [snorts] Okay. Right. And he says,
[47:13] "That's about the way it goes. Let's not
[47:15] make resolutions. Let's ask for mercy
[47:18] and grace. Ask for God's mercy.
[47:21] Even in the resolve of even good things,
[47:23] you realize there's this there there's
[47:24] this negative side to it that too much
[47:27] resolving within yourself according to
[47:29] the things that you identify as what's
[47:30] important and what's needful becomes the
[47:33] I wills
[47:35] that when you make out when you make out
[47:37] your new new year's resolutions that
[47:39] even uh in a corporate resolution it
[47:41] says whereas whereas whereas and we
[47:43] hereby resolve and it's basically saying
[47:46] we will.
[47:47] This is what we're going to do. I will I
[47:49] will. And so there's just an inherent
[47:51] danger in that mode of thinking where
[47:53] this rearview mirror of Pharaoh looking
[47:55] back what's happened looking back what
[47:56] happened is bad but then you don't just
[47:58] make this let's look forward and I'm
[48:00] going to do this I'm going to do this he
[48:01] says let's ask for mercy and grace
[48:04] if if I could put it this way because
[48:06] there's so much brother Ram says in this
[48:07] area that YOU HAVE TO INVITE GOD into
[48:10] the picture or you have you want to get
[48:12] your eyes on what matters and what is
[48:14] the most important if we're going to
[48:16] consider what this year holds for us.
[48:19] Amen.
[48:21] Because I use the phrase the year in
[48:24] preview
[48:25] and you're all familiar with the the a
[48:29] year in review. You look back and they
[48:31] give you your year and that's this is
[48:32] the beauty of being signed up for all
[48:34] these different services is they tell
[48:35] you just how many bottles of water you
[48:37] bought in the past year and it's like
[48:39] congratulations, you bought the most uh
[48:42] water bottles in in in the local fries,
[48:45] right? because they know everything
[48:46] you've done and and they're going to
[48:48] Spotify is going to tell you who your
[48:49] favorite artist was and you're going to
[48:50] go back and you can look at everything
[48:52] and it's a year in review and all the
[48:54] news magazines and all the newspapers
[48:57] are giving you their their year in
[49:00] review
[49:00] and that's why I used a common New York
[49:03] Times font for my title this year the
[49:05] year in preview that this is something
[49:07] we would be reading and the year in
[49:09] review is we're looking back and we're
[49:10] reviewing what's been but a year in
[49:13] preview you there's there's certain
[49:16] things maybe say well there's you know
[49:17] the sun's going to come up tomorrow but
[49:19] even in that maybe there's probability
[49:20] that it won't and and there's certain
[49:22] things that they could try to say is
[49:24] going to happen but I think that when we
[49:27] ask ourselves what is God's will for me
[49:29] this year we can actually preview what
[49:31] God's will is
[49:32] when brother Brandham had the preview of
[49:34] a bride the bride comes through and then
[49:36] we says she shall come in preview again
[49:38] he's seeing what will be
[49:41] in preview again what will be this is
[49:43] the bride that is marching even right
[49:45] now ASCENDING UP INTO HIGHER STEPS.
[49:47] BROTHER BAM SAW THAT IN PREVIEW. WASN'T
[49:50] A REVIEW. It was a preview.
[49:53] AND I COULD I WANT TO SAY THIS. WE CAN
[49:55] KNOW GOD'S WILL IN THE COMING YEAR.
[49:58] You may say, "Wow, THAT'S A PRETTY BOLD
[49:59] STATEMENT." WELL, it's going to be
[50:01] really obvious once I COME TO IT. I MAY
[50:03] NOT KNOW SOME OF THE very nitty-gritty
[50:06] details in your lives and the things
[50:07] that you're weighing and things that
[50:08] YOU'RE DECIDING. AND WE ALL INDIVIDUALLY
[50:11] face tremendous decisions whether it be
[50:12] where we're going to live, whether or
[50:14] not we're moving, WHETHER WHAT JOB TO
[50:16] TAKE AND whe whether or not to put our
[50:18] kids in public school or whether or not
[50:19] to do this and that. THERE'S A LOT OF
[50:21] OTHER DECISIONS THAT WEIGH UPON US THAT
[50:23] ARE ARE TANTAMOUNT TO GOD'S WILL. BUT
[50:26] THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE CAN
[50:28] IDENTIFY IN HIS WORD THAT HE'S ALREADY
[50:31] ORDERED FOR US.
[50:33] And New Year's resolutions are fine.
[50:35] They're helpful. They're great. They're
[50:36] wonderful. But I believe that we could
[50:38] have something greater on the horizon
[50:41] than just even our just the the fitness
[50:44] of our bodies or the cleanliness of our
[50:46] homes or uh our finances alone. That
[50:49] there's a way that we can invite God
[50:50] into that entire process and that all
[50:53] these things are working together for
[50:54] that goal that we have
[50:57] a greater resolve
[50:59] in the church age book chapter 4. I I I
[51:02] almost want to just skip over this
[51:03] because I'm running out of time, but
[51:04] we'll just read it and so you can see
[51:07] that brother Brandham saying we can know
[51:08] the will of God. He says, I wonder if
[51:10] we're suff sufficiently impressed with
[51:12] the word in our midst. That's a common
[51:14] refrain here. And I love it.
[51:18] He says, "Let me give you a thought
[51:19] here. How do we pray? We pray in Jesus'
[51:21] name, don't we? Every prayer is in his
[51:23] name or there isn't any answer." Yet in
[51:26] 1 John 5:14, we're told, "This is the
[51:28] confidence that we have in him, that if
[51:30] we ask anything according to his will,
[51:32] he heareth us. And if we know that he
[51:34] hear us, whatever, what whosoever we
[51:36] ask, whatsoever we ask, we know that we
[51:38] have the petitions that we desired of
[51:40] him." Now, we ask, what is the will of
[51:42] God? There is only one way to know his
[51:45] will, and that is by the word of God.
[51:48] Lamentations 3:37, "Who is he that
[51:50] saith, and it cometh to pass when the
[51:51] Lord commandeth it not?" There it is.
[51:53] And I love this phrase. If it isn't in
[51:55] the word, you can't have it.
[51:57] So, we can't ask unless it's in the
[51:59] word. And we can't petition or ask
[52:01] unless it's in his name. Now, he makes
[52:02] the connection. There it is again.
[52:03] Jesus, the name is the word will. You
[52:06] can't separate God and the word. They
[52:08] are one.
[52:10] So, we can know his will. You say,
[52:12] "Well, brother, that's that's that's in
[52:14] a real general sense." Yeah. Okay. And
[52:17] then even in the general sense, there's
[52:18] very specific things. And I could say
[52:20] this, I guess this is what's been in my
[52:22] mind the whole time is I realize that
[52:24] with each one of you individually,
[52:27] there could even be a benefit of just
[52:28] sitting down and fellowshipping about
[52:30] where you're at, what you're going
[52:31] through, what you're experiencing, the
[52:33] decisions you have to make, the things
[52:34] you have in the future. And there's
[52:36] something to be gained by just sharing
[52:37] that with one another and hearing from
[52:39] another believer and and talking. And
[52:41] this is maybe one of the things I've
[52:43] done a lot as a pastor is uh it would if
[52:46] people come to me and they have a
[52:48] question, if I don't have a clear answer
[52:49] in the word of God and God hasn't spoken
[52:50] to me, I'm very careful to give an
[52:52] answer. And so we'll talk about it. I'll
[52:54] ask questions. We'll kind of work
[52:55] through it together and invite the Lord
[52:57] to be a part of the process. And there's
[52:59] something to be gained in that. And I
[53:01] think we could all sit down and in
[53:03] different areas of our lives that we're
[53:04] wrestling with decisions and choices.
[53:06] And we have set before us two different
[53:08] things. AND I DON'T know which one's the
[53:09] blessing. And I don't know which one's
[53:10] the cursing. I don't know which one's
[53:12] the right WAY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF
[53:13] THINGS THAT GOD HASN'T just flip over to
[53:15] Galatians chapter 24 and it says, you
[53:17] know, Owen Donaldson, on your birthday,
[53:19] you should have chocolate cake instead
[53:21] of vanilla cake. It doesn't read, IT
[53:23] DOESN'T READ THAT WAY.
[53:25] SO, WE FIND OURSELVES SOMETIMES KIND OF
[53:27] CAUGHT IN I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO.
[53:28] I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND SO, I'M
[53:30] ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE'S SPECIFIC
[53:32] THINGS IN EACH ONE of your lives and
[53:34] scenarios that you're going through.
[53:36] Even I think about you not right now,
[53:37] Brother Joel, WHERE MAYBE SHIFT CHANGES.
[53:39] AND NOW YOU'RE IN YOUR HEART SAYING,
[53:40] "OH, I I I had a shift. I COULD ALWAYS
[53:42] BE IN CHURCH." AND NOW THE WORK IS
[53:43] SWITCHING THINGS OVER AND I AND I WANT
[53:46] TO DO THIS AND I WANT TO DO THAT AND AND
[53:48] I BELIEVE GOD GAVE ME THIS JOB. I'M NOT
[53:49] SURE WHAT TO DO. AND YOU GET IN A LITTLE
[53:50] BIT OF A PICKLE DURING A SEASON BECAUSE
[53:52] YOU'RE NOT NOT SURE WHICH WAY TO GO. AND
[53:54] WHEN I SAY UH THAT I know we can know
[53:57] what God's WILL IS FOR YOUR LIFE, I
[53:58] BELIEVE EVEN IN THOSE THINGS, GOD CAN
[54:00] ANSWER IT. BUT MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A
[54:03] PASTOR ISN'T TO TRY TO SORT ALL YOUR
[54:05] BUSINESS OUT,
[54:06] RIGHT?
[54:08] But what I do have a responsibility
[54:11] is is to point us to what this what what
[54:14] we're doing here, what matters,
[54:16] and the things that can help you figure
[54:18] it out.
[54:20] So many people want to go to the pastor
[54:22] and ask, you know, can I do this? Can I
[54:24] do that? Because they really just want
[54:25] the easy way out.
[54:27] And I remember preaching a ministers
[54:29] meeting overseas one time a and
[54:31] basically telling the just saying that
[54:33] if we could bring the people to a birth,
[54:35] we wouldn't have to be babying all the
[54:37] people and constantly telling them what
[54:38] to do. And I tell you, in two services,
[54:40] I had rubbed those Pentecostal kittens
[54:43] the wrong way.
[54:45] That was weird. Um, didn't know what I
[54:47] was getting myself into on some of the
[54:49] ideas that they had. But that's one of
[54:51] the things you realize is you want
[54:53] people to mature, make their own
[54:54] decisions, process things, experience
[54:56] things. And so you realize this makes
[54:57] what we're doing today so important
[55:00] because you're going to go live it
[55:03] and that's where it counts out there,
[55:05] not here. It counts out there. And
[55:07] that's why it makes this even more
[55:08] important.
[55:10] It's not what we're just doing
[55:12] everything out there to get here and
[55:13] this is like right and this is the this
[55:16] is the moment we've ALL BEEN WAITING
[55:17] FOR. CHURCH on Sunday morning. No,
[55:20] Monday morning's the moment we've all
[55:21] been waiting for. And I need TODAY TO
[55:24] ANSWER THE BELL.
[55:26] I NEED NOW THIS IS THE THIS IS WHAT THIS
[55:28] that makes this even more important when
[55:30] you get it in the proper order.
[55:32] AND SO WE CAN KNOW the will of God. Now
[55:36] on Wednesday night, brother Loyal
[55:37] ministered a thought. His title was I'm
[55:39] looking for a city and and I felt like
[55:41] in ministering that the subject I it was
[55:44] just such a good service for the end of
[55:46] the year as for some reflection uh for
[55:49] some honesty about where we are and
[55:51] especially really challenging uh to
[55:53] young people and to any one of us to be
[55:55] sure that we're not just going through
[55:56] the motions that we're connected with
[55:57] something real, there's something
[55:59] tangible. and he talked about the
[56:00] futility of New Year's resolutions and
[56:03] and looking back and making promises and
[56:04] I promise I'm going to do this, I'm
[56:06] promised to do that. I think you
[56:06] mentioned uh joining the you know a gym
[56:10] and things like that and
[56:13] he his title I just thought it was very
[56:15] profound at the end of the year he's
[56:18] he's preaching this thought I'm looking
[56:19] for a city and I know we mentioned it
[56:21] here before I can't remember if it was
[56:23] in um well I don't remember when it was
[56:26] but uh maybe been who's my neighbor I
[56:28] know it wasn't a New Year's time but we
[56:31] referred to in the Jewish despor when
[56:33] all the Jews had been scattered out and
[56:34] they would still gather together and
[56:35] they would celebrate cedar and the
[56:36] Passover and they would celebrate uh
[56:38] Yamukur and Rashashan and all these
[56:41] different fest they had these traditions
[56:44] and one of the Jewish New Year's
[56:45] traditions and they have multiple new
[56:46] years they got like four of them um but
[56:49] in in both in the at the conclusion of
[56:51] Cedar Cedar Knight and Yam Kapur they
[56:54] say every year because they were divided
[56:56] right they were cast out they would
[56:57] every year they'd say next year in
[56:59] Jerusalem
[57:01] because they were looking for a city
[57:03] and where they were they would say,
[57:05] "Next year when we do this, we're going
[57:07] to do it in Jerusalem."
[57:09] And then if they weren't there the next
[57:10] year, what do they do? Next year, new
[57:13] Jerus IN JERUSALEM. WHY? BECAUSE THEY
[57:15] HAD THIS PROMISE THAT THAT'S WHERE THEY
[57:18] WOULD BE.
[57:19] AND THEY NEVER LOST SIGHT OF IT.
[57:21] SO IT WAS PERFECT AS WE COME TO THIS NEW
[57:23] YEAR THAT WE WOULD BE REMINDED, OH GOD,
[57:26] LORD WILLING, NEXT YEAR, NEW JERUSALEM.
[57:29] THAT THIS WORLD IS NOT OUR HOME. THIS
[57:31] ISN'T OUR FINAL DESTINATION. I I JUST
[57:33] DON'T WANT THIS CYCLE TO ALWAYS BE
[57:35] REPEATING ITSELF. BUT NEXT YEAR IN NEW
[57:37] JERUSALEM,
[57:40] and I was studying the the concept even
[57:42] deeper on the Jewish New Year's and IT
[57:44] AND IT DAWNED ON ME THEY THEY HAD THESE
[57:46] MULTIPLE INSTANCES. They had a new year
[57:48] for uh certain feast and for animals and
[57:50] different different junctures and times.
[57:52] But in each feast there was this
[57:54] component and and I would SAY THAT EVEN
[57:56] GOD ESTABLISHED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR
[57:58] NEW YEARS AND THAT most prominent would
[58:00] be the the actual new year and then a
[58:02] civil new year. The religious one to the
[58:05] religious year and then also a CIVIL
[58:07] YEAR THAT GOD ESTABLISHED THE CONCEPT OF
[58:10] A NEW year for a very specific purpose
[58:11] to ISRAEL THAT GOD WANTED IT WHEN HE
[58:13] ESTABLISHED IT IN THE EXODUS. HE SAYS
[58:15] TODAY WILL BE THE FIRST DAY FOR YOU. GOD
[58:18] WAS NOW WANTING TO DIVIDE THEM FROM THE
[58:20] PAST OF IN EGYPT and now begin in Exodus
[58:24] that he says this is going to be the
[58:25] first DAY OF THE MONTH FOR YOU. I'M A
[58:26] START IN A NEW CALENDAR. AND THEN GOD
[58:28] HAD THEM OBSERVE the new year for a
[58:31] reason. And in each one of these feast,
[58:35] and we're just kind of pointing to them,
[58:36] in each one of these feast, they had the
[58:38] function of feasting in a way that
[58:40] recalled what God had done.
[58:43] But then it always had this component of
[58:45] pointing to what God would do.
[58:47] Amen. So, it wasn't it wasn't just
[58:49] merely uh uh celebrating something past,
[58:53] but what happened in the past was
[58:56] acknowledged and it was it was used AS
[58:59] EVIDENCE THAT GOD WAS GOING TO DO what
[59:01] he ultimately promised he would do.
[59:04] It would point them to the Messiah.
[59:06] Amen.
[59:07] And I found three different places in
[59:08] the Midrash and this is the rabbitic
[59:11] traditional writings and the translation
[59:14] may be a little bit different if you
[59:15] read it in the Hebrew but these are some
[59:17] of the sayings they would say on their
[59:18] new years. We hold this evening to
[59:20] remember the miracles and the kindness
[59:22] that God does for his nation. This is
[59:25] this is what the evening is about. They
[59:27] say in Nissan we were redeemed in the
[59:30] past and this was the beginning of the
[59:31] days the beginning of month in Exodus
[59:33] 12:13 there he says and in Nissan we are
[59:35] destined to be redeemed again. Isn't
[59:38] that beautiful? SO THERE IS AN
[59:39] ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT WE WERE REDEEMED.
[59:41] THIS IS THIS MARKS that we HAVE BEEN
[59:43] REDEEMED AT THIS MOMENT. AND THEY
[59:44] believe that ON THESE CERTAIN DAYS this
[59:46] is the day the earth was created. This
[59:48] was the day that uh uh Jacob wrestled
[59:50] with the angel. They got a lot of
[59:51] traditions that are attached to these
[59:53] days. They say in this day, in this
[59:55] time, we're redeemed in the past, AND
[59:57] WE'RE DESTINED TO BE REDEEMED AGAIN. AND
[59:59] LORD, I'M I'M THANKFUL FOR WHAT HE'S
[1:00:01] DONE, BUT I'M LOOKING FOR A CITY.
[1:00:03] AMEN.
[1:00:05] WHAT HE'S DONE TELLS ME THERE'S
[1:00:06] SOMETHING REAL. AND I KNOW IT'S MOVING
[1:00:08] ME into something real.
[1:00:10] It says, "We hold this evening to put
[1:00:12] everyone in the correct spiritual
[1:00:13] mindset."
[1:00:14] I loved how they say that. We hold THIS
[1:00:16] EVENING TO PUT EVERYONE IN THE CORRECT
[1:00:19] SPIRITUAL MINDSET. I'M HOLDING THIS
[1:00:21] SERVICE THIS MORNING TO PUT EVERYONE IN
[1:00:23] THE CORRECT SPIRITUAL MINDSET TO REALIZE
[1:00:25] WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT THAT THIS COULD BE
[1:00:27] THE MONTH OF THE MESSIAH'S REDEMPTION.
[1:00:29] AMEN.
[1:00:30] WHOA. WHAT A REMINDER
[1:00:33] THAT THEY SAID WE WANT TO WE'RE DOING
[1:00:34] THIS NOW. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH HAS
[1:00:36] BEEN LOST IN THE TRADITION OF THE ACTUAL
[1:00:38] FEAST AND THE ORDER AND THE EVENTS. OH,
[1:00:40] SHOULDN'T IT JUST RESONATE WITHIN THE
[1:00:42] HEART OF THOSE JEWS WHEN THEY CELEBRATE
[1:00:44] AND THEY WOULD SAY, "NEXT YEAR IN
[1:00:45] JERUSALEM." OR THEY WOULD SAY, "WE'RE
[1:00:47] DOING THIS NIGHT TO PUT US IN THE
[1:00:49] CORRECT SPIRITUAL MINDSET THAT THIS
[1:00:51] MONTH COULD BE THE MONTH OF MESSIAH'S
[1:00:53] REDEMPTION." I SAY, "IF THEY COULD DO
[1:00:55] THAT, HOW MUCH MORE OUGHT TO WE WHO ARE
[1:00:58] SUFFICIENTLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS WORD
[1:01:00] THAT IS IN OUR MIDST SAY TO OURSELVES,
[1:01:02] WHAT IS IT THAT HE HAS DONE? AND HAS IT
[1:01:05] PUT ME IN THE RIGHT MINDSET TO BELIEVE
[1:01:06] THAT GOD'S GOING TO DO WHAT HE PROMISED
[1:01:08] TO DO?"
[1:01:08] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:01:11] And that sermon, I'm looking for a city.
[1:01:13] Brother Loyal was talking about
[1:01:15] connecting with something real and not
[1:01:16] just living
[1:01:19] not just a just the vanity of trying to
[1:01:22] live a better life and do this and do
[1:01:23] that, but having something real behind
[1:01:25] it all. Not just the vanity of of self
[1:01:28] and self-preservation, self- betterment.
[1:01:31] He he referred to it's not just knowing
[1:01:33] what's right and wrong. And it's not
[1:01:35] just about being pretty good people.
[1:01:38] They even use the phrase, it's not just
[1:01:39] a better way of living.
[1:01:41] And a part of all that is whatever you
[1:01:42] do, don't don't think more of brother
[1:01:44] Aaron than you should. And that
[1:01:45] shouldn't be too hard.
[1:01:49] And it begged the question
[1:01:53] because I think this is and again I I
[1:01:55] fell with brother Loyal on it beforehand
[1:01:56] and I'm I'm trying to pay him
[1:01:58] compliments in this. This is and there's
[1:02:00] if there was a needle if he brought it
[1:02:01] to a point to the needle, I'm not trying
[1:02:03] to move it at all.
[1:02:05] I'm just I'm just laying down another
[1:02:07] line on this because it was very good to
[1:02:08] ask ourselves well how much of this is
[1:02:10] just kind of the traditional what we
[1:02:11] know what we've been taught what we do
[1:02:13] kind of going through the motions or is
[1:02:14] there really something behind it h have
[1:02:17] we crossed a threshold where I know I
[1:02:20] know I'm connected to something very
[1:02:21] real something deep I'm convinced of
[1:02:22] this I know it's not just a better way
[1:02:24] to live I know this isn't just the best
[1:02:27] brand of Christianity that this is
[1:02:29] something eternal this is something as
[1:02:31] these Jews were so entrenched this was
[1:02:33] identity
[1:02:34] if we could have some sort of identity
[1:02:36] in Christ and knowing that there's a
[1:02:38] future that he's bringing us to. We've
[1:02:40] got to have that.
[1:02:41] Amen.
[1:02:42] And so it was the way that it really
[1:02:45] came back to me with this force and I'm
[1:02:46] taking so much time to go back over this
[1:02:48] is we have this caution even with
[1:02:50] brother Bram saying, "Well, you we don't
[1:02:52] just want to have a rearview mirror
[1:02:53] affair to look back and say change this
[1:02:55] and change that." We don't make New
[1:02:56] Year's resolutions. And there's this
[1:02:58] cautious caution then of not just want
[1:03:01] to live a better life. I want to try
[1:03:02] this. I want to try that.
[1:03:03] So then what's what's what's different
[1:03:06] when WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE WILL of
[1:03:07] God and do what's right.
[1:03:11] It's because we're connected to
[1:03:12] something real,
[1:03:13] seeking something different.
[1:03:15] And so when I say, "What does the uh
[1:03:19] maybe the question would be, what does
[1:03:20] the year in preview then mean to the
[1:03:22] believer?
[1:03:25] What is God's will for me this year?
[1:03:32] What is God's will for me this year?
[1:03:34] We're we're asking this. I I feel like
[1:03:36] I've got more time this morning.
[1:03:39] And so we we're just almost done here.
[1:03:43] And now I feel like this is really this
[1:03:45] is a real clumsy corner.
[1:03:49] But think of it think of this in the
[1:03:50] sermon power of transformation.
[1:03:52] Now that we have been saved as we are.
[1:03:58] There we go. Now that we have been saved
[1:04:01] as we are and that we've been filled
[1:04:03] with the Holy Ghost as we have, now we
[1:04:06] want the mind that was in Christ to be
[1:04:07] in us.
[1:04:09] Now, and maybe let's just let let's just
[1:04:12] go back to this here. I mean, think
[1:04:14] about this. There's a we're saved as we
[1:04:17] are, filled the Holy Ghost as we have
[1:04:19] there. Now,
[1:04:21] it's like, SO IF WE CAN SAY THAT THAT we
[1:04:24] have something real, we can say that
[1:04:27] we're connected to the eternity, that I
[1:04:29] I COME FROM GOD, I'M GOING TO GOD, AND
[1:04:31] WE KIND OF WE'RE IN THAT THAT CHANNEL
[1:04:33] THAT CHRIST WAS IN. AND WE'RE CERTAIN OF
[1:04:35] THAT. WE'RE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:04:36] HE THEN TAKES IT A STEP FURTHER. SAYS,
[1:04:38] NOW WE WANT THE MIND THAT WAS IN CHRIST
[1:04:40] TO BE IN US.
[1:04:42] SO, THIS IS A process that begins to
[1:04:44] unfold. IF YOU'RE FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[1:04:45] GHOST, I REALIZE I'M IN THE PROCESS OF
[1:04:47] THE MIND OF CHRIST DEVELOPING INTO ITS
[1:04:49] PERFECT PICTURE. He says that we MIGHT
[1:04:52] BE TRANSFORMED FROM THE NATURAL THINGS
[1:04:54] OF LIFE, ALL THE CARNAL THINGS, ALL THE
[1:04:56] NATURAL THINGS, AND BE BROUGHT IN TO DO,
[1:04:58] THIS is a phrase I really want you TO
[1:04:59] ZERO IN ON, TO DO THE PERFECT THE
[1:05:02] PERFECT WILL OF GOD.
[1:05:04] THIS IS WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR LIVES NOW
[1:05:06] THAT WE'VE BEEN SAVED AS WE HAVE AND
[1:05:08] BEEN FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AS WE
[1:05:10] HAVE. WE'RE NOT PUT ON A SHELF JUST
[1:05:12] WAITING FOR THE NEXT GUY TO HURRY UP AND
[1:05:13] GET SAVED AND FILLED the Holy Ghost. so
[1:05:14] we can all get out of here. NO, YOU ARE
[1:05:16] NOW IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE
[1:05:18] MIND OF CHRIST SO THAT YOU CAN BE
[1:05:20] TRANSFORMED FROM NATURAL things to do
[1:05:22] the perfect WILL OF GOD. NOW IS WHEN IT
[1:05:25] REALLY COUNTS. NOW IS WHEN EVERYTHING
[1:05:27] YOU WERE DOING BEFORE IS NO LONGER
[1:05:29] TRADITION. NOW IS WHEN IT'S NOT JUST A
[1:05:31] BETTER WAY OF LIFE. NOW IT IS LIVING THE
[1:05:33] LIFE. NOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY SEEKING A
[1:05:36] CITY.
[1:05:36] AMEN.
[1:05:38] NOW YOU CAN BE PUT IN THE CORRECT
[1:05:39] SPIRITUAL MINDSET TO BE THINKING ABOUT
[1:05:42] REDEMPTION.
[1:05:43] AMEN.
[1:05:44] So he says we need to be brought in to
[1:05:46] do the perfect will of God by
[1:05:47] transformation of God's spirit by his
[1:05:49] word.
[1:05:50] So there's this the way I the way I was
[1:05:52] thinking about it is
[1:05:55] then if we don't want to make the
[1:05:56] mistake of just putting together a to-do
[1:05:59] list and then just trying our best to do
[1:06:02] it
[1:06:04] and and not have the Holy Ghost and just
[1:06:06] do it by tradition. Then what do we do
[1:06:09] when we have it?
[1:06:12] Is there is there is there any
[1:06:14] determination made or is there any
[1:06:16] choice? Is there any uncction? Is there
[1:06:20] any desire? Is there any ambition? Or is
[1:06:21] it just like I just kind of take it as
[1:06:22] it comes?
[1:06:24] And if I could say this, as we're trying
[1:06:26] to close, I I uh well, this will be
[1:06:29] multiple parts. We'll just pull some of
[1:06:31] this into multiple parts.
[1:06:33] I said there's no doubt there's things
[1:06:35] that we could change.
[1:06:37] Uh there's no doubt each one of us,
[1:06:38] there's things we should change. There's
[1:06:39] things we should start. There's things
[1:06:40] that we should stop at this time, at
[1:06:42] this juncture. There's a lot of things
[1:06:44] that maybe we could start doing that are
[1:06:45] better practices financially, uh better
[1:06:48] practices nutritionally, uh better
[1:06:50] practices in our relationship. We can
[1:06:51] make promises to do certain things and
[1:06:53] all those things are great and needful.
[1:06:56] But I say separate from that and even
[1:06:57] more importantly,
[1:06:59] we need to remember to remember what we
[1:07:01] have.
[1:07:02] Amen.
[1:07:03] Remember what we've received.
[1:07:05] Remember what we know
[1:07:08] from a
[1:07:10] from a spiritual context.
[1:07:13] And I believe that there's very there
[1:07:15] are very specific things that we can
[1:07:17] identify as God's will for us this year.
[1:07:20] Very specific things. Okay. Well, here's
[1:07:21] the moment. Brother Aaron's going to
[1:07:22] tell me to get a new job. I can't speak
[1:07:24] to those things, but by God's grace, I
[1:07:27] can give you the tools to navigate it
[1:07:28] and we can or encourage your experience
[1:07:29] in God through the preaching of the word
[1:07:31] of God and grow. You just mature in the
[1:07:32] word and mature in the word. That would
[1:07:34] be our desire for you. But I can since
[1:07:37] we're here and this is our church, I can
[1:07:40] be very specific about what God's will
[1:07:42] is for us as a church
[1:07:44] and said, "What is God's will for me
[1:07:45] this year?"
[1:07:48] I can give you I can tell you and and
[1:07:51] and I know this may seem like a total
[1:07:55] here at the end for a moment, but I
[1:07:58] think I I feel just to go ahead and
[1:08:00] express this and I'll amplify it in some
[1:08:01] future services. It's going to be very
[1:08:03] very easy. I can tell you there are
[1:08:05] three things that are God's will for you
[1:08:06] this year at a minimum. All right? And
[1:08:10] you guys have started out really good.
[1:08:13] You've started out great. But these are
[1:08:16] three three things that you can do. And
[1:08:17] I'm not going to amplify them all uh uh
[1:08:20] right now, but I can support them all in
[1:08:22] the word of God.
[1:08:23] Amen. And sometimes there's, and I'm not
[1:08:26] saying we do this consciously, nor are
[1:08:27] we doing it ignorantly where this is
[1:08:29] some sort of, oo, I can't believe you
[1:08:30] make that mistake, but we're just not
[1:08:32] really conscious that going to church is
[1:08:35] fulfilling God's will.
[1:08:37] You are actively putting yourself in
[1:08:39] position to harmonize your aims
[1:08:44] to where NOW YOU SAY, "OH, I THERE'S
[1:08:46] CHURCH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WELL, THERE'S
[1:08:47] THIS, THERE'S THIS, there's this,
[1:08:48] THERE'S THIS." YOU KNOW, BUT IT'S GOD'S
[1:08:49] WILL FOR ME. I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS
[1:08:51] DECISION TO GO. AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY
[1:08:52] MAKING GOD'S DESIRE FOR YOU AND GOD'S
[1:08:54] WORD FOR YOU YOUR AIM.
[1:08:56] AMEN.
[1:08:56] AND AND SO you can you can do this. THIS
[1:08:59] IS SOMETHING YOU CAN SAY. DON'T FORGET
[1:09:00] IN DOING THESE THINGS, YOU'RE DOING
[1:09:02] GOD'S WILL for your life.
[1:09:04] Amen.
[1:09:04] WE'RE OVER HERE PULLING OUR HAIR OUT.
[1:09:06] OH, DOES HE WANT ME TO SELL ALL MY
[1:09:07] STOCKS? DOES HE WANT ME TO DO THIS? DOES
[1:09:09] HE WANT ME TO DO THAT? DOES IS THIS THE
[1:09:10] GIRL I SHOULD MARRY? IS THIS WHAT I
[1:09:12] SHOULD DO? IS THIS WHAT I SHOULD DO? AND
[1:09:13] GOD'S OVER HERE SAYING, "WELL, YOU'RE
[1:09:14] NOT EVEN DOING WHAT'S IN BLACK AND
[1:09:16] WHITE.
[1:09:18] How are you going TO GET IT RIGHT IF I
[1:09:19] TELL YOU WHAT'S NEXT?
[1:09:23] SO YOU GUYS ARE all good this morning.
[1:09:25] You're here. Perfect attendance this
[1:09:27] year.
[1:09:30] And another thing we COULD SUBSTANTIATE
[1:09:32] BY SCRIPTURE AND PROVE that is God's
[1:09:33] will for you is contribute your tithing
[1:09:36] and your offerings.
[1:09:38] And I would like to maybe get into more
[1:09:40] specifics on these things in
[1:09:42] [clears throat] the future services just
[1:09:44] so you can understand from the church
[1:09:46] standpoint where where these things are
[1:09:47] important. But this is something that
[1:09:49] you can do and it's the will of God.
[1:09:52] Clearly, it's the will of God. And the
[1:09:53] the third thing is you can support
[1:09:55] missions.
[1:09:57] Now, in any each one of these in these
[1:10:00] three things, AND I I EVEN FEEL IN MY
[1:10:02] HEART THAT IT IT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT BE
[1:10:04] THAT AT THE opening of every service, we
[1:10:06] remind ourselves of these things
[1:10:09] that we want that we can attend church,
[1:10:11] contribute, and support that through our
[1:10:13] attendance, through our contributions,
[1:10:14] and our support. THIS IS SOMETHING that
[1:10:16] we do. THIS IS WHY GOD'S BROUGHT YOU
[1:10:18] TOGETHER.
[1:10:19] YOU realize that
[1:10:20] THAT GOD HAS BROUGHT YOU TOGETHER AS A
[1:10:22] FAMILY, AS IN A CHURCH TO DO GREAT
[1:10:25] THINGS.
[1:10:26] And and IF WE ALL JUST HAVE OUR NAME IN
[1:10:28] A IN A DIRECTORY AND WE'RE ALL NOT ALL
[1:10:30] GATHERED TOGETHER, I MEAN, YOU MIGHT AS
[1:10:32] WELL JUST CONSIDER YOURSELF PART OF AN
[1:10:34] ALUMNI ASSOCIATION and just paying dues
[1:10:36] and never getting any of the benefits.
[1:10:38] You're never showing up for the free
[1:10:39] lunches. You're never showing UP FOR THE
[1:10:41] TAILGATES. You're never you're never
[1:10:42] getting THE NICE FANCY MUG. YOU'RE JUST
[1:10:44] PAYING DUES AND YOU'RE JUST ON A ROLL.
[1:10:47] BUT THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.
[1:10:48] AMEN.
[1:10:50] WE'RE NOT JUST CHECKING THE BOX. OH,
[1:10:51] WELL, DID YOU ATTEND CHURCH? ARE YOU
[1:10:52] THERE? I tell people all the time, we're
[1:10:54] not here to take attendance.
[1:10:57] And so, there's no um at least not in
[1:10:59] OUR HOME THAT I KNOW OF. There's no uh
[1:11:02] role book, you know, where we go home,
[1:11:04] you're like, well, you know, look at
[1:11:05] this family. They really that's four
[1:11:07] stars in a row. You honey, break out the
[1:11:10] Chick-fil-A card. Somebody's about to
[1:11:11] get it. Uh, we don't take attendance.
[1:11:15] WE DON'T DO IT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS.
[1:11:17] I ABSOLUTELY love it when people tell me
[1:11:19] they're not going to be here. You know
[1:11:22] why? We always notice.
[1:11:25] Sister Elizabeth always know. When we
[1:11:28] leave, we can tell you to the person
[1:11:30] who's not there without even having to
[1:11:32] think about it.
[1:11:33] Why? Because that's how we feel about
[1:11:35] you.
[1:11:36] It's the same way. Did anybody know I
[1:11:38] wasn't here Wednesday night?
[1:11:40] [laughter]
[1:11:42] Right? Never looked so young, never sang
[1:11:45] so good. I wasn't here Wednesday night
[1:11:47] and you all noticed. Why? Because that's
[1:11:49] the way you feel about me. You recognize
[1:11:51] my place and he's the pastor. He's the
[1:11:52] one that's here. He's the one that
[1:11:53] preaches. And when I'm gone and you
[1:11:55] notice that's the way I feel about you.
[1:11:58] And so my pain is amplified.
[1:12:01] You know, over a hundfold because
[1:12:03] there's just one guy. When I'm gone, you
[1:12:05] know, all of you miss me. But when just
[1:12:06] one of four, many of you are gone. We we
[1:12:09] find where were they? Is everything
[1:12:10] okay? And then we do that terrible
[1:12:12] balancing act of do we reach out and ask
[1:12:14] if everything's okay because you don't
[1:12:15] want it to sound like well we wanted to
[1:12:16] know whether or not this was an excused
[1:12:18] absence
[1:12:20] um because you know that last doctor's
[1:12:23] note you gave yeah it was fake
[1:12:26] right we're not doing it
[1:12:28] we just want how can we help what can we
[1:12:29] do these are things that you can do
[1:12:31] through your attendance and I and if the
[1:12:33] Lord would lead me to do it I could I
[1:12:34] want to bring it out through the
[1:12:35] scripture so you can see through the
[1:12:37] messenger there so you can see yes this
[1:12:39] isn't about church it isn't about people
[1:12:41] and personalities. IT'S ABOUT FULFILLING
[1:12:42] GOD'S WILL FOR our lives. You can do
[1:12:44] this by attending church, CONTRIBUTING
[1:12:47] AND SUPPORTING MISSIONS. THIS IS GOD'S
[1:12:49] WILL FOR US.
[1:12:50] I FEEL THAT I COULD SAY IT'S THUS SAYITH
[1:12:52] THE LORD FOR US AS ARIZONA BELIEVERS
[1:12:54] CHURCH AND THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES
[1:12:55] to be a PART OF THIS THAT THIS IS
[1:12:57] SOMETHING THAT IS GOD'S WILL FOR US AND
[1:13:00] THAT THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE COULD
[1:13:01] STRIVE TO DO consistently
[1:13:04] and in doing so please the Lord.
[1:13:07] And I would say in each one of these, it
[1:13:09] comes down to a choice.
[1:13:12] It's a choice.
[1:13:15] And these are these are instances where
[1:13:17] God by his grace has given us things
[1:13:18] that we can choose to do.
[1:13:21] And even when it's not doesn't feel good
[1:13:23] and even when it may not be the best
[1:13:25] opportunity, even when it seems as
[1:13:26] everything's working against us, we can
[1:13:28] make that choice to do these things to
[1:13:31] do the right thing. And in doing it, God
[1:13:34] will bless us. It puts us in that
[1:13:36] delight and that satisfaction
[1:13:39] because there's other things in our
[1:13:40] lives you say, "Well, then the real
[1:13:41] nitty-gritty about God's perfect will
[1:13:42] for us and and I need this and I need
[1:13:44] that." You can't expect God to act
[1:13:46] absent your choice,
[1:13:47] right?
[1:13:48] Even in the in the sense that well, this
[1:13:51] is maybe I can I can say this
[1:13:53] personally. I don't like to inject
[1:13:54] myself personally, but my prayers and
[1:13:57] please help me out here. I don't want to
[1:13:58] be the only guy. I'm I pray and I'm
[1:14:01] asking God to help me.
[1:14:03] Lord, help me not to eat a whole box of
[1:14:05] donuts today when I get home, right?
[1:14:08] Lord, help me to not, you know, drink
[1:14:11] high fructose corn syrup raw. You know,
[1:14:15] yeah, there's things that you ask for
[1:14:16] help and God's saying,
[1:14:20] "Well, how you know, like you you got to
[1:14:23] do something, Aaron. I mean, how about
[1:14:24] not guzzle, you know, put it to your
[1:14:26] lips, you know, do something here." And
[1:14:28] and I realize there's a lot of things
[1:14:29] we're asking God to help, but you know,
[1:14:32] maybe we need to choose.
[1:14:34] Maybe we need to make A DELIBERATE AND
[1:14:36] DECLARE OUR INTENTION
[1:14:38] AND AND AND SAY NO AND TO MAKE DECISIONS
[1:14:42] AND TO DO IT TO SHOW GOD THIS IS THIS IS
[1:14:44] WHAT'S IN MY HEART. THIS IS WHAT I MEAN.
[1:14:46] I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M THINKING ABOUT
[1:14:47] THIS, BUT BROTHER LUCAS, YOU MAY
[1:14:48] REMEMBER decades ago praying about
[1:14:50] something. There was something HE WAS
[1:14:52] DESIRING. AND I JUST REMEMBER WE WERE uh
[1:14:55] we were I think we were just texting
[1:14:56] over some ancient uh RELAY CHAT PROGRAM
[1:14:59] AND AND I SAID, "LUCAS, YOU GOT TO SHOW
[1:15:01] GOD YOU MEAN BUSINESS. DO SOMETHING
[1:15:02] RADICAL. GET A HAIRCUT." WHATEVER IT WAS
[1:15:04] AT THE TIME. I WAS SAYING, "YOU GOT TO
[1:15:05] DO SOMETHING TO SHOW GOD YOU'RE choosing
[1:15:07] his will.
[1:15:08] THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT. THIS IS WHAT YOU
[1:15:10] DESIRE." DON'T JUST SIT THERE AND SAY,
[1:15:12] "OH, GOD, HELP ME GET OUT OF BED. How
[1:15:13] about swinging your legs over the edge?"
[1:15:16] Right?
[1:15:17] DO SOMETHING TO SHOW GOD. START WIGGLING
[1:15:18] YOUR TOES. SHOW GOD, "GOD, I MEAN
[1:15:20] BUSINESS. THIS IS SOMETHING I WANT. IT
[1:15:22] MAY NOT BE WHAT I'M FEELING. IT MAY NOT
[1:15:24] BE WHAT EXACTLY UH WHAT I WHAT I WANT,
[1:15:26] BUT I SEE IN YOUR WORD OF GOD, THIS IS
[1:15:28] WHAT YOU WANT OF ME, AND I WANT TO
[1:15:30] CHOOSE IT. I WANT TO CHOOSE IT. I WANT
[1:15:32] TO CHOOSE IT.
[1:15:35] Brother Brandham says this in the
[1:15:36] sermon, the marriage of the lamb. HE
[1:15:38] SAYS, GOD COULD NOT PUSH us through a
[1:15:40] little pipe and pull us out on the other
[1:15:41] end and then say, "Blessed is he that
[1:15:43] overcomemeth."
[1:15:45] He couldn't do it.
[1:15:46] WE WE ARE NOT JUST ALL IN a tube.
[1:15:50] No. and we're just being pulled THROUGH
[1:15:51] IT. WE'RE NOT ALL ON ELON MUSK tunnel
[1:15:56] in Teslas or Teslas if you're listening
[1:15:59] closely, right? And just kind of I'm not
[1:16:02] doing anything, RIGHT?
[1:16:04] YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
[1:16:06] GOD'S JUST NOT NAVIGATING YOU THROUGH A
[1:16:07] PIPE. HE'S NOT JUST PULLING YOU THROUGH
[1:16:08] A PIPE AND THEN SAYING, "BLESSED IS HE
[1:16:10] THAT OVERCOMEMETH. OH, YOU DID SO GOOD."
[1:16:12] WELL, IT WAS JUST SO EASY. I just like
[1:16:15] it's like you know when you go to the
[1:16:16] bank and you put your deposit in
[1:16:19] that's all he did
[1:16:20] THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD'S DOING. HE SAYS HE
[1:16:23] SAYS THAT YOU'VE GOT UH HE SAYS YOU HAD
[1:16:26] NOTHING TO OVERCOME.
[1:16:28] HE JUST PUSHED YOU THROUGH. HOW OFTEN
[1:16:31] ARE OUR PRAYERS GOD PUSH ME GOD PUSH ME
[1:16:33] GOD PUSH ME. AND HE'S SAYING BUT YOU'VE
[1:16:35] GOT TO MAKE DECISIONS YOURSELF.
[1:16:38] AMEN.
[1:16:38] HE SAYS I have to make decisions for
[1:16:40] myself. IN DOING THAT, WE SHOW OUR FAITH
[1:16:42] and respects to God.
[1:16:44] This is WHERE WE CAN SHOW OUR FAITH AND
[1:16:46] RESPECTS TO GOD IN BY MAKING THE
[1:16:48] CHOICES. HE SAYS, "GOD CAN'T JUST PULL
[1:16:50] US THROUGH A PIPE, PUSH US OUT ON THE
[1:16:52] OTHER END, AND SAY, "BLESSED IS HE THAT
[1:16:54] OVERCOMEMETH." AND I'M GOING TO SAY
[1:16:55] THIS, IT MIGHT SEEM TO BE, "WELL, THAT I
[1:16:58] NEVER THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE AN
[1:16:59] OVERCOMING. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THAT
[1:17:00] WOULD AMOUNT TO ME OVERCOMING." BUT DO
[1:17:02] YOU REALIZE YOU OVERCOME BY ATTENDING
[1:17:04] CHURCH? YOU OVERCOME BY CONTRIBUTING
[1:17:06] CONSISTENTLY. YOU OVERCOME BY SUPPORTING
[1:17:08] MISSIONS BECAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME
[1:17:10] WHEN THOSE THE VALUES OF THOSE THINGS IS
[1:17:12] LOST. WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE
[1:17:14] EVERYTHING IS SET AGAINST US TO TRY TO
[1:17:15] KEEP US AWAY FROM IT. AND THERE'S
[1:17:17] OVERCOMING IN DOING IT.
[1:17:19] AMEN.
[1:17:20] THERE'S victories in it.
[1:17:23] And in doing it, we show our faith and
[1:17:25] our respects to God. And I know it's not
[1:17:28] an easy choice in a lot of these things.
[1:17:31] It's something you got to fight for.
[1:17:40] I don't know if I should say it.
[1:17:42] It's It's Sunday morning, so I feel
[1:17:44] safe. Just saying it. I'm just not
[1:17:46] saying it is, but could it be
[1:17:50] that
[1:17:51] brother Ram talked about staying at home
[1:17:53] and watching television on Wednesday
[1:17:54] night?
[1:17:56] And how many of us are streaming on a
[1:17:58] TV?
[1:18:00] 2 Thessalonians 3:13.
[1:18:02] [laughter]
[1:18:09] These are the things I can say are God's
[1:18:10] will for your life. There's more.
[1:18:13] And actually, the way I feel in my heart
[1:18:14] to share it with you is these this is
[1:18:16] the minimum. And so this is your this is
[1:18:19] your entry level. And then we got a pro
[1:18:21] level, right?
[1:18:23] There there's there's there's a there's
[1:18:24] a there's an evolution to this. There's
[1:18:25] a maturing to this. This is the minimum
[1:18:27] we can do.
[1:18:29] And the Bible says, "Be not weary and
[1:18:30] welloing.
[1:18:33] that we ought not to lose heart in doing
[1:18:36] the right thing.
[1:18:39] That that there I if I could say it to
[1:18:41] you in this way that no matter how weak
[1:18:43] you feel, no matter how unable you might
[1:18:45] feel, no matter how distant the
[1:18:47] accomplishment may seem, that there will
[1:18:50] be provision to accomplish his will.
[1:18:54] Amen.
[1:18:56] That that if you're if YOU'RE WEARY,
[1:18:58] YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT IT WRONG. YOU'RE
[1:18:59] DRAWING FROM THE WRONG SOURCE. YOU
[1:19:00] YOU'VE KIND OF STEPPED OUT OF THAT FLOW
[1:19:02] AND THAT THAT CHANNEL WHERE HE ENERGIZES
[1:19:04] BECAUSE WE OUGHT NOT TO BE WEARY AND
[1:19:06] WELLOING THAT WE SHOULD NOT LOSE HEART
[1:19:08] AND LOSE UNCCTION AND LOSE WILL TO DO
[1:19:10] THE RIGHT THING. OH GOD, NEVER LET IT BE
[1:19:13] WHERE WE'RE WEARY IN DOING THE MINIMUM
[1:19:15] THAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING.
[1:19:18] But when we get a little bit discouraged
[1:19:20] and we find ourselves
[1:19:22] uh a little bit beat up, brother
[1:19:24] Brandham said there's there's a
[1:19:26] lengthier quote to this. I think we
[1:19:27] shared some of it in Christ my healer
[1:19:28] series, but he says he's talking about
[1:19:30] them on the road to Emmas and the
[1:19:31] sisters coming uh the tomb and he he
[1:19:34] uses these different examples of how
[1:19:36] discouraged they were in light of the
[1:19:38] recent events that had happened and he
[1:19:40] just makes the statement when you're
[1:19:41] discouraged that's when the devil can
[1:19:42] really pour it on you.
[1:19:44] See, this is this is where the danger
[1:19:46] is. When you begin to get weary,
[1:19:50] that's when the devil really pours it on
[1:19:52] you.
[1:19:53] And I think if there's one thing that's
[1:19:55] kind of plagued us, no pun intended,
[1:19:57] through the pandemic is there was there
[1:20:00] was momentum and there was discipline to
[1:20:02] certain things and the pandemic
[1:20:04] interrupted so much of it. And it's sad
[1:20:07] to say some people haven't quite
[1:20:08] recovered yet
[1:20:09] because the way that they they they lost
[1:20:12] they became weary in welloing. Maybe
[1:20:14] they weren't able to do and now it's
[1:20:16] harder to find the uncction, the
[1:20:17] discipline, the faithfulness in these
[1:20:19] things. But I want to encourage you
[1:20:21] don't lose the momentum.
[1:20:23] When we there's a lot of review even in
[1:20:26] these things. I realized as God was
[1:20:27] dealing with my heart, the reason why I
[1:20:28] came up with the year in preview is
[1:20:30] there was these are things that we
[1:20:31] emphasized a number of ways this past
[1:20:34] year in our family tree and talking
[1:20:36] about practice and these different ser
[1:20:38] sermons and series that we did was
[1:20:40] enforcing enforcing what God is wanting
[1:20:43] to do in our lives and how he can use
[1:20:45] this dynamic to see that you grow into
[1:20:47] mature sons and daughters of God and
[1:20:48] that we ought not to lose the
[1:20:50] consistency for these things and the
[1:20:52] heart to do these things.
[1:21:04] [sighs]
[1:21:07] in James chapter 4:7. We'll uh we'll
[1:21:10] read it to you and then we'll hold back
[1:21:12] some maybe some things because it's just
[1:21:13] there's a lot of depth here.
[1:21:16] Submit yourselves therefore to God.
[1:21:18] Resist the devil and he'll flee from
[1:21:21] you. You realize it's a two-part process
[1:21:23] for him to flee. First, you submit, then
[1:21:27] you resist.
[1:21:28] You must first choose God's will.
[1:21:31] You must submit to God's will.
[1:21:34] Resistance without submission is futile.
[1:21:37] You cannot pretend to resist the devil.
[1:21:39] You cannot literally resist the devil
[1:21:41] without submission and get him to flee.
[1:21:43] There there's no there's nothing there.
[1:21:46] There's no resistance that there's
[1:21:48] nothing to keep him away. And I I want
[1:21:51] to SAY THIS BY POINTING OUT THESE things
[1:21:53] that that we can do THAT HOW CAN WE
[1:21:56] OVERCOME? HOW CAN WE GROW? HOW CAN WE
[1:21:58] MATURE if we're not if we haven't
[1:22:00] recognize THE WILL OF GOD FOR US and
[1:22:03] then chose it?
[1:22:06] Chosen say this is what I WANT TO DO.
[1:22:08] THIS IS THIS IS MY CHOOSING. THIS IS THE
[1:22:10] PATH I WANT TO GO IN. OR HOW CAN WE
[1:22:11] DISREGARD WHAT IS THE OBVIOUS WILL FOR
[1:22:14] US AND THEN LOOK FOR OTHER THINGS TO
[1:22:16] TRANSPIRE.
[1:22:20] I just let me close with this script or
[1:22:22] this is my closing scripture hearkening
[1:22:24] back to Psalms 37:23. The steps of a
[1:22:26] good man are ordered by the Lord
[1:22:29] there. These are steps that are ordered.
[1:22:31] We may not know what we need to do on
[1:22:33] Monday, Tuesday, and all these other
[1:22:36] days. But you know what? By God's grace,
[1:22:37] if he puts you in the position where you
[1:22:39] can do it, you know what you can do on
[1:22:40] Sunday morning.
[1:22:42] You're right. There there's things that
[1:22:43] that relate to these other ways and
[1:22:44] other things we can do. But God has
[1:22:46] given you things that you can do to make
[1:22:48] contact with God to fulfill his word to
[1:22:51] obey to to do your part.
[1:22:54] The steps of a good manner or ordered by
[1:22:56] the Lord. Lord, order my steps in thy
[1:22:58] word.
[1:23:00] I want to close on going back to the
[1:23:01] doorway effect. I notice some people
[1:23:04] left so you may not remember this
[1:23:07] but the doorway effect we can be
[1:23:09] forgetful in transitions
[1:23:12] and what you lose sense of purpose. I'm
[1:23:15] I'm gonna go I'm gonna go take out the
[1:23:17] trash. You walk through a door. I'm
[1:23:19] gonna go eat a candy bar, right? You or
[1:23:23] things that we you know that happened to
[1:23:26] our family. You know, hey, go take this
[1:23:29] and put it in the refrigerator and you
[1:23:30] they walk through the doorway and it's
[1:23:32] in your car. You're like, why is the
[1:23:34] milk in my car? Right? The doorway
[1:23:37] effect. What am I doing here with a cafe
[1:23:39] thing of milk? Right? So, you just put
[1:23:41] it in the car. That's what that's what
[1:23:43] it is. That's what the doorway effect
[1:23:44] is. You lose sense of purpose and
[1:23:46] direction. Now, it was a it's not like
[1:23:49] there's been volumes and volumes of
[1:23:50] study in this, but we've all
[1:23:52] acknowledged that it's happened to us.
[1:23:53] So, there's something there. It's a
[1:23:54] phenomena. So, some of the early studies
[1:23:56] on it demonstrated over and over again
[1:23:58] the doorway effect, the doorway effect.
[1:23:59] So, it's kind of accepted as phenomena.
[1:24:01] Well, there was a follow-up study that
[1:24:02] was done that really wanted to examine
[1:24:04] the effect more closely and identified
[1:24:06] that the doorway effect can have limits.
[1:24:09] And one of the things I said, the
[1:24:10] doorway effect only occurs if we're
[1:24:12] cognitively in a vulnerable state.
[1:24:15] That it only happens if we're under
[1:24:17] pressure or distracted.
[1:24:19] If something divides our focus.
[1:24:22] And so this is where transition into new
[1:24:25] year. Let's not let the doorway effect
[1:24:27] get triggered by dividing our focus
[1:24:30] and by resolving either new things or
[1:24:32] just by doing a review and and we're
[1:24:35] going to try to pick up and finish the
[1:24:36] bucket list that didn't get finished in
[1:24:37] the past couple years or whatever, but
[1:24:39] by going back to what we know is
[1:24:41] certain,
[1:24:42] remembering what we've heard and we've
[1:24:45] received.
[1:24:46] And then I'm reminded of how when we
[1:24:48] begin to lose heart or get discouraged,
[1:24:50] that's when the devil can really pour it
[1:24:51] on us. And that's when the doorway
[1:24:53] effect is even more pronounced. when
[1:24:54] you're vulnerable state of mind, you're
[1:24:56] under pressure, you're tasked and the
[1:24:57] way that they studied it, they had
[1:24:58] people who were wearing headsets and
[1:25:00] they were asked to do certain tasks and
[1:25:01] they were told you're going to go
[1:25:02] through this, you have to be counting to
[1:25:03] something and doing this and doing that,
[1:25:04] but then we want you to place this on
[1:25:06] this and they had to do all these
[1:25:07] things. They found that that's why the
[1:25:08] doorway effect was so pronounced is
[1:25:10] because the people were vulnerable
[1:25:13] mentally. They had their minds kind of
[1:25:15] divided, a little bit distracted and
[1:25:18] this blew my mind. This was the
[1:25:19] conclusions by the the the professor at
[1:25:21] this university who headed up the study.
[1:25:23] You all listening?
[1:25:24] HERE'S THE BIG FINISH.
[1:25:27] If we are single-minded in what we want
[1:25:29] to do, nothing will stop us remembering.
[1:25:32] Amen.
[1:25:34] And I THOUGHT OF HOW CHRIST SAID, "IF A
[1:25:35] IF AN I BE SINGLE,
[1:25:37] then the whole body is full of light."
[1:25:40] But if there's a WAY THAT WE COULD UNITE
[1:25:42] TOGETHER AND HAVE A singular aim and
[1:25:44] that if I CAN ALIGN MY AIMS WITH HIS, HE
[1:25:47] SAYS, "IF WE'RE SINGLE-MINDED IN WHAT WE
[1:25:49] WANT TO DO, NOTHING WILL STOP US
[1:25:50] REMEMBERING." HE SAYS, "BUT if we have
[1:25:52] multiple things going on, forgetfulness
[1:25:54] becomes noticeable."
[1:25:56] And this is what happens when we somehow
[1:25:58] allow our lives to be fragmented
[1:26:01] and we have, well, I have my I have all
[1:26:03] my sports stuff over here and my
[1:26:05] children's recreation here and I have
[1:26:06] all these hobbies and I have all this
[1:26:07] group and I have all this and everything
[1:26:09] just gets so and WE GET SO SPREAD OUT.
[1:26:12] We got so MANY THINGS WE GOT TO DO. I
[1:26:14] got to do THIS AND I GOT TO do that and
[1:26:15] one for every kid and everything's and
[1:26:17] YOU GET SO SPREAD OUT AND REALLY WHAT WE
[1:26:19] NEED TO REALIZE IS FIND A WAY TO TAKE
[1:26:21] EVERYTHING THAT'S IN OUR LIVES AND PLACE
[1:26:22] IT under the umbrella of God's word
[1:26:24] and say I'm placed here for a purpose
[1:26:27] and at the end of the day I'm OF A
[1:26:28] SINGULAR MINDSET. I WANT TO BE BROUGHT
[1:26:30] in to do GOD'S PERFECT WILL AND I got to
[1:26:33] do this this this this and this. But all
[1:26:35] of it's going to work to WHERE I AM
[1:26:37] BROUGHT IN TO DO GOD'S PERFECT WILL. AND
[1:26:39] REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE A SINGULAR CALLING
[1:26:42] AND WE HAVE A SINGULAR OBJECTIVE AND
[1:26:44] THAT'LL KEEP US FROM FORGETTING.
[1:26:48] And I believe that we ought to even as a
[1:26:49] church unite in a singular purpose.
[1:26:52] There there's a lot of things that we
[1:26:53] can't unite around. Uh we we can't all
[1:26:56] geek out on data, right? We can't all
[1:26:58] geek out on programming. We can't all
[1:27:00] geek out on hunting. All right. There's
[1:27:02] a lot of things maybe we just, you know,
[1:27:04] we don't we don't get along or we don't
[1:27:06] identify in a lot of different areas and
[1:27:07] recreational pursuits, but there's a lot
[1:27:09] of things we can get along on.
[1:27:11] A lot of things we can harmonize in.
[1:27:13] There's a lot of things we can get on
[1:27:14] board. There's a lot of things we can be
[1:27:15] singular in our pursuit of.
[1:27:18] And there's things that at a minimum we
[1:27:19] can all be doing.
[1:27:22] Brother Ram said it in the message
[1:27:24] shalom. We're not going to have a
[1:27:24] rearview mirror affair.
[1:27:27] The rearview mirror only looks back and
[1:27:29] sees where you've been.
[1:27:31] We are looking forward to see where we
[1:27:33] are going.
[1:27:35] That which is in the past, Paul said,
[1:27:36] forgetting those things which are in the
[1:27:37] past, I press toward the mark of the
[1:27:39] high calling in Christ. And to me, I
[1:27:40] think this is such a perfect New Year's
[1:27:42] prayer for us. And that's what we want
[1:27:44] to do. A man, we can look back 15 16
[1:27:47] years ago. 16 years ago this past year
[1:27:49] that we move first moved to Phoenix,
[1:27:51] Elizabeth and I. When I come to Phoenix
[1:27:53] the first time, glory
[1:27:56] finding yourself in the word. There has
[1:27:58] been many things happened since then,
[1:28:00] good and bad. That all goes to the
[1:28:02] judgment in the hands of God. But what
[1:28:05] I'm looking forward now is what I will
[1:28:07] do in this coming year towards in
[1:28:10] betterment the kingdom to make better to
[1:28:13] lift up the value of to there's a way
[1:28:17] betterment can be used in a lot of
[1:28:18] different ways, but the
[1:28:20] this in betterment actually I don't
[1:28:22] think is even a word. But you get what
[1:28:24] he's saying, right? Like even if he just
[1:28:26] made up a word, we got what he's saying.
[1:28:29] Like how can I how can I fight for the
[1:28:31] kingdom of God? How can I support the
[1:28:33] kingdom of God? How can I make how can I
[1:28:36] uh uh take whatever it to the end of and
[1:28:39] to the endowment OF AND THE FULFILLMENT
[1:28:41] OF A AND TO better the kingdom to
[1:28:44] FURTHER THE KINGDOM TO ADVANCE THE
[1:28:46] KINGDOM DOING MORE ALL THAT I CAN DO FOR
[1:28:48] the kingdom of God. This I believe can
[1:28:51] be our prayers for 2023 that we can have
[1:28:54] a year in preview where we CAN DETERMINE
[1:28:56] IN OUR HEARTS WHAT'S THIS YEAR GOING TO
[1:28:57] HOLD FOR US. THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS
[1:28:59] CERTAIN TRUTHS WE CAN HOLD SELF-EVIDENT.
[1:29:01] WE SAY THIS IS GOD'S WILL FOR ME. THESE
[1:29:03] ARE THE THINGS THAT I WILL NOT LET SLIP.
[1:29:05] THIS IS WHAT I CAN AT LEAST BEGIN TO DO
[1:29:07] AT THE OUTSET THAT'S GOING TO FURTHER MY
[1:29:09] UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT GOD WOULD WANT ME
[1:29:11] TO do for the kingdom of God.
[1:29:14] Let's pray together. Heavenly Father,
[1:29:16] Lord, as we are sitting in your presence
[1:29:19] this afternoon
[1:29:20] and and these things echoing in our
[1:29:22] hearts, Lord, I acknowledge that as a
[1:29:25] pastor, I've taken liberty uh to preach
[1:29:28] very lengthy with the people. Lord, if
[1:29:30] it has been insensitive with such a long
[1:29:32] week and a New Year's last night,
[1:29:34] forgive me. But I but I can say that the
[1:29:37] faces of the people and their bodies and
[1:29:41] their attentiveness is in no way
[1:29:43] expressed a weariness or a tiredness or
[1:29:47] slumping. Lord, even to this very
[1:29:49] moment, there is such a dynamic pool in
[1:29:51] the people's hearts because I believe
[1:29:53] that I speak to a very mature group who
[1:29:55] are who are not just entry- levelvel
[1:29:57] believers who are not just walking in
[1:29:59] the first steps, but Lord, they want to
[1:30:02] be brought in to do the perfect will of
[1:30:03] God. And Lord, where we might be
[1:30:06] desiring to advance further and have
[1:30:08] greater knowledge and understanding and
[1:30:10] come to that that ideal of adoption that
[1:30:14] that we have in our minds. Lord, we
[1:30:16] cannot achieve
[1:30:19] your will in this hour by letting loose
[1:30:22] of your will of all hours. LORD, WE
[1:30:25] CANNOT ACCOMPLISH YOUR WILL OF
[1:30:27] PERFECTION. IF WE ARE NOT ACCOMPLISHING
[1:30:29] YOUR WILL OF JUSTIFICATION and
[1:30:31] sanctification, LORD, WE CANNOT
[1:30:33] ACCOMPLISH YOUR WILL OF TRANSLATION AND
[1:30:36] A FULL REDEMPTION. IF WE'RE NOT WALKING
[1:30:38] IN ALL STEPS AND PHASES OF your word. So
[1:30:41] I pray, Lord, that you would help us as
[1:30:43] a congregation. Lord, I know that it's
[1:30:45] very it's I'm speaking to people. And I
[1:30:48] I don't say it just tongue and cheek or
[1:30:49] comedically, Lord. Who have perfect
[1:30:52] attendance this year, who have already
[1:30:53] given this year, who have already given
[1:30:55] to missions, who are are walking in each
[1:30:57] one of these things. LORD, I I PREACH
[1:31:00] THIS AND I EXPRESS THIS IN PRAYER, MY
[1:31:03] HEART BEING POURED OUT. MAY THEY FIND
[1:31:05] GREAT COURAGE IN KNOWING THEY'RE DOING
[1:31:07] THINGS THAT are pleasing you. LORD, MAY
[1:31:09] THEY FIND GREAT SATISFACTION IN KNOWING
[1:31:12] THAT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE
[1:31:14] AT EVERY SERVICE AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY
[1:31:16] KEEP THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD
[1:31:17] AT CERTAIN INTERVALS, LORD, MAY THEY MAY
[1:31:20] THEY HAVE THIS SENSE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:31:22] THEIR CHOICE IS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR
[1:31:25] WILL IS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR DESIRE IS
[1:31:28] AND MAY YOU DELIGHT IN THEIR EFFORTS.
[1:31:30] MAY YOU DELIGHT IN THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR
[1:31:32] YOUR WORD. MAY YOU DELIGHT IN THEIR
[1:31:34] DISCIPLINE. LORD, EVEN AT HOME IF THEY
[1:31:36] STREAM WHEN MOMENTS DO KEEP THEM OUT OF
[1:31:38] SERVICE. LORD, I PRAY THAT THERE'D BE
[1:31:40] SUCH AN ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THEY WOULD
[1:31:42] never weary in welloing.
[1:31:45] They would find a deep purpose in their
[1:31:47] hearts
[1:31:48] to continue to serve you with all that
[1:31:50] is in them. And Lord, if you would see
[1:31:53] fit to further impress upon us these
[1:31:56] things in the year in preview, Lord, may
[1:31:58] it be received as uh from you. And may
[1:32:01] the people derive encouragement from it.
[1:32:04] Give us a good year, Lord. Lord, I
[1:32:07] believe you have great things in store
[1:32:08] for us. And I and I'm I'm looking
[1:32:11] forward to your strength in this year,
[1:32:13] your power in this year,
[1:32:15] Lord, where we could climb up a little
[1:32:17] bit higher to see you in your program.
[1:32:20] Bless us, I pray. In the name of the
[1:32:22] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
