[0:00] Luke chapter 24. We're going to begin
[0:01] with verse 13 and read to verse 35.
[0:06] This is following the resurrection of
[0:07] Jesus Christ. Uh some of your Bibles may
[0:10] note it as the road to Emmas or the
[0:13] Emmas road experience where two
[0:16] disciples who are grieving the tragic
[0:19] death of Christ and um not and very
[0:24] discouraged. Brother Ram does a
[0:26] tremendous job of
[0:28] uh dramatizing
[0:30] uh how tore up and sad they were and he
[0:33] talked about how so tore up and sad uh
[0:35] that they missed the very prophecies
[0:37] being fulfilled around them. So, it's a
[0:38] very striking um story that is so
[0:42] applicable to the day and time that
[0:44] we're living in that there's so many
[0:45] things that transpire. Um even the
[0:48] criticisms and the uh difficulties that
[0:51] we face and some of the dispersions and
[0:54] lies that are told about the message of
[0:56] the hour. We can get so discouraged by
[0:58] all the negativity that we fail to see
[1:01] prophecy being fulfilled. Luke 24:13.
[1:04] And behold, two of them went that same
[1:07] day to the village called Emmas, which
[1:09] was from Jerusalem, about three score
[1:10] furongs. And they talked together of all
[1:12] these things which had happened. And it
[1:15] came to pass while they communed
[1:17] together and reasoned, Jesus himself
[1:19] drew near and went with them. But their
[1:22] eyes were holden that they should not
[1:23] know him. And he said unto them, "What
[1:26] manner of communications are these that
[1:27] you have one to another as you walk and
[1:29] are sad?" One of them whose name was
[1:32] Cleopus answering said unto him, "Art
[1:34] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and
[1:36] hast not known the things which are come
[1:37] to pass there in these days?" And he
[1:39] said unto them, "What things?" And they
[1:41] said unto him, "Concerning Jesus of
[1:43] Nazareth, which was a prophet, mighty
[1:45] indeed in word before God and all the
[1:47] people, and how the chief priest and our
[1:49] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[1:51] death, and have crucified him." But we
[1:53] trusted that it had been he which should
[1:54] have redeemed Israel. Beside all this,
[1:57] today is the third day since these
[1:59] things were done. Yay. And certain women
[2:01] also of our company made us astonished
[2:03] which were early at the supplicer. Just
[2:05] notice what what they're saying. It's
[2:07] been three days and on the third day
[2:09] some women went to the tomb and it was
[2:11] empty and they're they're sad but it was
[2:15] exactly what he had said he would do. So
[2:17] it's just remarkable.
[2:19] And when they found not his body, they
[2:21] came saying that they had also seen a
[2:23] vision of angels which said that he was
[2:24] alive. And certain of them which were
[2:26] with us went to the supplr and found it
[2:28] even as so the woman had said but him
[2:30] they saw not and they're still sad.
[2:32] Right? So he says then he said unto
[2:34] them, "Oh fools and slow of heart to
[2:36] believe all that the prophets have
[2:38] spoken. Ought not Christ to have
[2:40] suffered these things and to enter into
[2:42] his glory? And beginning at Moses and
[2:45] all the prophets, he expounded unto them
[2:48] in all the scriptures the things
[2:50] concerning himself." And they drew nigh
[2:52] unto the village whether they went. And
[2:53] he made as though he would have gone
[2:55] further. But they constrained him,
[2:56] saying, "Abide with us, for it is toward
[2:58] evening, and the day is far spent, and
[3:00] he went in to terry with them." And it
[3:03] came to pass as he sat at meat with
[3:04] them, he took bread and blessed it,
[3:06] break, and gave to them. And their eyes
[3:09] were opened, and they knew him, and he
[3:11] vanished out of their sight. They said
[3:13] one to another, "Did not our heart burn
[3:15] within us while he talked with us by the
[3:17] way, and while he opened to us the
[3:19] scriptures?" And they rose up the same
[3:21] hour and returned to Jerusalem and found
[3:23] the 11 gathered together and them that
[3:25] were with them saying, "The Lord is
[3:27] risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon.
[3:30] And they told what things were done in
[3:32] the way and how he was known of them in
[3:35] breaking of bread." Amen. You can be
[3:38] seated.
[3:39] Our subject is I am an open book.
[3:44] the I pondering maybe just a a a
[3:48] subtitle to give some context to what
[3:50] we're speaking on. And I would say that
[3:52] if if I was to have to give it another
[3:54] annotation, it would be about I just
[3:57] want to emphasize a manifested reality,
[3:59] but it's still the I am an open book. So
[4:02] the I am is an open book. and two
[4:06] statements that we read at the end of
[4:07] service last time is where I want to
[4:09] jump in and begin um to kind of enter
[4:12] them into the record and for us to
[4:14] ponder them. Brother Brandaman's souls
[4:16] that are in prison now. He says when
[4:18] these seven seals was opened that opened
[4:21] up the entire Bible. So the seven seals
[4:24] open up the Bible opens up. That means
[4:26] seven seals were closed. Sealed up the
[4:29] Bible in some to some degree had to also
[4:32] be sealed up and closed. He said the
[4:34] seven seals. It was sealed with seven
[4:36] mysteries and in these seven seals held
[4:38] the entire mystery of it. He says and it
[4:39] was the book of redemption. He says new
[4:41] testament not the old. It only
[4:44] proclaimed for the new testament. Now
[4:47] that's him I believe kind of zeroing in
[4:49] on how the seals that opened up and
[4:52] opened up the bible are specifically
[4:56] relating to things and prophecies in the
[4:58] New Testament. And that to whatever
[5:01] degree the Bible became a new book. It
[5:03] wasn't that the entire Old Testament was
[5:05] sealed up, but there were these seven
[5:07] seals in the New Testament, specifically
[5:09] referenced there in the book of
[5:10] Revelation, that pertain to events that
[5:13] unfolded in the New Testament church,
[5:15] the church that is born under this New
[5:17] Testament. And he's wanting us to
[5:19] recognize that these seven seals opened
[5:21] up the book of redemption. The New
[5:24] Testament becomes opened up. It becomes
[5:26] new. And in doing so, the whole Bible
[5:29] becomes a new book because the old and
[5:31] the new work together. Now, that's
[5:33] brother Brandham's statement. Now, what
[5:35] whe what whatever that means to you or
[5:36] how the Lord quickens that to you, it's
[5:38] very important that you have your own
[5:39] personal revelation of these things. And
[5:42] and I believe that God desires that each
[5:44] one of us would come into the unity of
[5:46] the faith and a continuity in terms of
[5:47] our understanding. I I I believe that if
[5:50] we're as believers, if we're looking at
[5:52] a mountain from different sides, you may
[5:54] describe it one way. I may describe it
[5:56] another way but if we keep traveling up
[5:58] that mountain we'll meet at the top
[6:00] and we can have a similar view. Now in
[6:03] the message God's power to transform he
[6:05] says it this way but since the opening
[6:07] of those seven seals and of them angels
[6:10] just behind the mountain yonder this
[6:12] referring to the Bible has become a new
[6:15] book. And there's other statements we
[6:17] could read to where brother Bram's
[6:19] talking about the seals being opened and
[6:20] all seven seals being opened uh to and
[6:23] everything ready to those who can
[6:24] receive it. And I and I believe it's
[6:26] very important to know that brother M
[6:28] taught those things. And then there's
[6:30] other ways that he can identify the book
[6:32] being opened and kind of the implication
[6:34] it has to the Bible and even the book of
[6:37] redemption being the Bible and Christ
[6:39] being the written word and the opening
[6:40] of the seals being a revelation of Jesus
[6:42] Christ. A lot of statements we could use
[6:45] uh um to substantiate this thought, but
[6:47] these two to me set forth this thought
[6:51] that the seals opened and it opened up
[6:53] the entire Bible, the book of
[6:55] redemption, proclaiming it for the New
[6:57] Testament. Seven seals are opened and
[6:59] since then the Bible's become a new
[7:02] book. And it would be important to
[7:05] understand what that means in terms of
[7:07] what happened to make the Bible a new
[7:10] book. But more importantly, if we are to
[7:13] accept this and receive this, kind of
[7:15] the question I asked at the end of
[7:16] service is what are the consequences of
[7:18] this? If the seven seals are open and
[7:21] the Bible's become a new book, what are
[7:22] the ramifications? And uh what is this
[7:24] what are the implications? What ought to
[7:26] I uh be learning and receiving and what
[7:29] ought that mean to me in my life? And
[7:31] what is the what is the outcome look
[7:33] like if these things have transpired?
[7:35] And personally, we could uh those of
[7:38] believers uh we spend we appropriately
[7:40] spend a lot of time pouring into the
[7:42] word of God to understand the things
[7:44] that brother Brandham taught. We're
[7:45] listening to his voice and we're picking
[7:48] up on these deep truths a and we believe
[7:51] them. And I believe that the next step
[7:53] then is is to understand that if that's
[7:56] the truth, then what's the consequence
[7:59] for me? How does that put me into
[8:01] action? How how am I moved to behave
[8:03] differently? and and the revelation of
[8:06] the word in to this degree, how then
[8:08] ought to to be reflected out in my life.
[8:10] And so there's a lot of things that I
[8:12] have burning in my heart that form the
[8:14] inspiration of this thought. I am an
[8:16] open book. Uh I'll just I'll just say it
[8:18] now. Maybe the first time I ever
[8:19] mentioned it, you thought I was saying
[8:21] that I'm an open book, right? But then
[8:24] we're looking at it. The I am he's an
[8:26] open book. There's something about him
[8:28] that's been unveiled to us. But the
[8:30] consequence and so I'm just giving it
[8:31] all away. You know where I'm going. So,
[8:32] if you just want to you want to go on
[8:34] vacation for the next few services cuz
[8:36] you feel like you know where I'm going,
[8:37] that's fine. But you're an open book,
[8:39] too. At least you ought to be. And so,
[8:42] there's this is the truth that we're
[8:44] looking at. Now, we referenced in Exodus
[8:47] 3:14. I don't have the scripture there
[8:49] before you. I just want to reference the
[8:50] phrase, I am that I am. God said, you
[8:54] tell the children of Israel. He's
[8:55] telling Moses that the I am hath sent me
[8:57] unto you. The I am that I am. This is
[9:00] God himself. this he is declaring
[9:02] himself to be eternal. He's declaring de
[9:03] declaring himself to be the
[9:05] self-existing one who is and will become
[9:08] what he is. He cannot become something
[9:10] he's not. So he he there's a was to God
[9:14] and there is a will be to God but he is.
[9:16] And this is the way that we ought to
[9:17] worship him. Not in what he was or what
[9:19] he will be but in what he is. That's why
[9:22] he declares himself to be the I am. A
[9:25] and to recognize then that if he was
[9:28] something, he is today the same and he
[9:31] will be. So we don't get caught up
[9:33] worshiping what was. Nor do we get
[9:35] caught up just looking forward to what
[9:36] will be. But we use what was to identify
[9:39] him in the I am. And then once you see
[9:42] him in the I am, you can catch him in
[9:43] the will be because he will be what he
[9:46] is. And that's what the word of God is
[9:47] declaring. He's past, present, and
[9:49] future. He is the absolute one. He is
[9:51] indivisible. He is incomparable.
[9:54] uh he's this being who's the ultimate
[9:56] cause of all existence. And this is how
[9:58] the Jews took uh who God was. He's this
[10:01] indivisible, undividable, uh absolute
[10:04] one. Nothing can be compared to him. And
[10:07] he's the the creator of everything. They
[10:09] viewed him as uh this is what is meant
[10:11] in this language of the I am and an open
[10:14] book. We looked at it in this sense and
[10:16] a lot of this is just review here at the
[10:18] outset. it's a person or thing that is
[10:21] easily or thoroughly understood or
[10:23] easily or thoroughly interpreted. And
[10:25] and I last night, very late last night,
[10:27] I just took maybe a whole page of my
[10:29] notes and just uh and did cut paste to
[10:33] to leave them out and save them for
[10:35] another time just maybe in the sense of
[10:37] not being too long today or too heavy.
[10:40] But a scripture I wanted to get to is
[10:42] how the word of God is of no private
[10:43] interpretation.
[10:45] And so the interpreting is an opening
[10:47] up. It's a loosening. It's an unveiling.
[10:49] And so to be an open book of a person,
[10:52] that person is an open book. They're
[10:53] easy to understand. You don't have to
[10:55] guess how they're feeling. And it's not
[10:57] to say that maybe they're always wearing
[10:58] their emotions on their sleeve, but when
[11:00] you deal with them, you know who you
[11:02] know what you're getting. You don't have
[11:03] to worry about pretense covering up
[11:05] something else. So somebody uh to be an
[11:07] open book, it's something or someone
[11:08] that is easily examined or understood.
[11:12] Uh we all love open book tests, right?
[11:15] in college or school, homeschool, uh
[11:18] different things, a open book test. We
[11:20] love that. And isn't it wonderful that
[11:22] in the last age when we're in the
[11:23] greatest battle ever fought in the most
[11:25] difficult test there's ever been, God's
[11:27] given us an open book test.
[11:29] Beautiful, isn't it? It's wonderful. And
[11:31] so there's uh these are some of the
[11:33] ideas of what an open book is. So you
[11:34] take the reverse of that. Remember
[11:36] invert always invert. A closed book was
[11:38] be someone or something that is
[11:40] difficult to know or understand. That's
[11:42] what a closed book would be. someone or
[11:45] something that is hard to know or hard
[11:47] to understand. To be a closed book, it
[11:49] speaks of a a secret or a mystery,
[11:51] something that is a puzzle. And it's an
[11:54] illusion to information that one either
[11:56] can't obtain or comprehend. In this
[11:58] Bible, it says uh the vision of all has
[12:00] become as a sealed book and the learned
[12:02] can't read it because it's sealed and
[12:04] the unlearned can't read it because it's
[12:07] information. The understanding cannot be
[12:09] obtained. It's not easily grasped or
[12:11] comprehended. And we use different
[12:13] scriptures to emphasize that concept.
[12:16] Now in 1 Corinthians chapter 13:12,
[12:19] I wanted to uh look at this again. It
[12:22] says, "Now we see through a glass
[12:24] darkly. The glass being an imperfect
[12:26] mirror, polished metal that could give
[12:29] you some sense of reflection, but Paul
[12:31] is acknowledging that this glass uh
[12:34] leaves something to be desired in what
[12:36] it reflects. And so darkly means it's in
[12:39] enigma, in a puzzle, something that's
[12:41] mysterious and puzzling, difficult to
[12:43] understand, or something that has become
[12:45] obscured. Even a part of itself, the
[12:48] mirror itself has a characteristic that
[12:50] kind of muddies up the reflection. And
[12:52] so he's saying, we're seeing through a
[12:54] glass darkly. We're seeing in an enigma.
[12:56] And we know we're looking at Christ. We
[12:58] know we're looking at God. We know we're
[12:59] looking at his word, but it's not all
[13:02] clearly understood. It's not easily
[13:04] grasped. And there's still we know
[13:05] there's a clear image that can be
[13:07] reflected. He says, "But then face to
[13:09] face." So for now I know in part is the
[13:13] partial reflection in the glass, the
[13:15] enigma, the puzzle. But then shall I
[13:17] know even also as I am known is the
[13:19] dynamic of being face to face with open
[13:22] face with clarity. Something recognized
[13:25] distinctly. Paul is saying it in the way
[13:27] to tell us that it's in the removing of
[13:29] the mystery. Whatever was partial,
[13:31] whatever was obscure, the enigma, the
[13:33] puzzle has been solved. That's what he
[13:35] means when he says face to face. So the
[13:38] I am an open book. We're looking at the
[13:41] I am who is mysterious. The I am who is
[13:43] invisible. The I am who declare is
[13:45] declared to be a God who hides himself.
[13:48] A God who is man has not seen at any
[13:50] time. Uh the one that fills all time and
[13:53] space. And let's just all be honest.
[13:55] When we really try to sit and think
[13:56] about eternity, there's a point where
[13:58] all of a sudden there's there's a little
[13:59] bit of a fear that pops in, right?
[14:02] Because you can't get your head around
[14:03] it. Uh you start thinking about eternity
[14:06] and there's a part of you that all of a
[14:07] sudden can kind of hiccup and interrupt
[14:09] in our carnal mind because that's the
[14:11] God that we can't truly grasp and man
[14:13] cannot know him I with his carnal
[14:16] faculties.
[14:18] Now that I am, we want to look at his
[14:21] expression in Christ. And as all the
[14:22] songs have lifted up and oriented us
[14:24] today, I feel that there's just so much
[14:26] momentum to carry on in this. In John
[14:29] 8:58, Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[14:32] verily, I say unto you, before Abraham
[14:34] was,
[14:36] I am." Not I was, but I am. And he says
[14:41] this to intentionally and purposely
[14:46] identify himself with the I am that I am
[14:49] the Jehovah, the Elohim, the the God
[14:51] that the Jews believed in and the one
[14:54] that he is making to be his father.
[14:56] Jesus Christ now is so linking himself
[14:58] to God the father that he says I am. In
[15:02] other words, I am the manifestation of
[15:04] the I am. That was a sealed secret. That
[15:07] was a hidden mystery that has been an
[15:09] enigma even to the children of Israel
[15:11] even though they believed him and they
[15:13] believed God to be present and God to be
[15:15] mindful and a God to be amongst his
[15:16] people. I I want to touch on this here
[15:18] in a little bit and I'm just trying to
[15:20] remember exactly where it might fall.
[15:22] But this God who had so evidently
[15:24] declared himself among Israel with signs
[15:26] and wonders and prophets, he had become
[15:29] obscured through their traditions.
[15:32] And so remember that it wasn't it wasn't
[15:34] like Jesus showed up right on the heels
[15:36] of Malachi or showed up right on the
[15:37] heels of a of King David or right on the
[15:40] heels of an Exodus with Moses saying
[15:42] that God's going to raise up a prophet
[15:43] like unto me and the next thing you know
[15:45] the Messiah shows up to help him drive
[15:47] out all the Hittites and Amorites and
[15:49] all the other itesites out there and
[15:50] they're like this is our Messiah. The
[15:52] promise is fulfilled. There had been
[15:54] this long drawn out protracted up and
[15:57] down battle and falling away of Israel
[16:00] over many many uh years. And brother
[16:03] Benham says in the message question and
[16:05] answers or just in the in the sermon uh
[16:08] the service question and answers part
[16:10] three he said before Abraham was I am.
[16:14] He, speaking of Christ, was the I am.
[16:18] And all the titles and names that ever
[16:19] belong to God was made one human name,
[16:22] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[16:25] What a beautiful revelation. Now, I
[16:27] believe that we're all kind of that gets
[16:28] us all on the same page now. And I want
[16:31] to begin to focus on a very important
[16:33] principle. And the first part was a
[16:35] foundation for this. This part is
[16:37] foundational to the overall thought, but
[16:39] this is a very important principle that
[16:41] we're looking at the nature of God and
[16:43] how he makes himself known. And God is
[16:46] transcendent.
[16:48] Uh it's beyond our human grasping. It it
[16:51] transcends our human experience. It's
[16:52] not something uh that's easily
[16:55] understood by our experience. So God is
[16:58] transcendent and he's hidden. He's
[16:59] invisible. He's unseen. But as we
[17:02] mentioned a moment ago, he's still
[17:03] personal.
[17:05] He's present. He's involved. He's not a
[17:07] god way off in the distance. As as
[17:09] pointed out, I believe the first time
[17:10] I'd ever heard it kind of the remark was
[17:12] brother Paul Fontaine uh back in the 90s
[17:14] was taking a service at Louisiana Youth
[17:16] Camp on music and there was a song that
[17:19] was very very popular at the time that
[17:22] God is watching us and the tagline is
[17:24] from a distance and a real nice melody
[17:26] to it. Don't go searching it. Don't say
[17:27] hey Spotify uh you know play me the
[17:30] song. But uh it it had this engaging
[17:34] melody, but the tag is from a distance.
[17:37] In other words, it sold this lie in
[17:40] there to create this beautiful melody of
[17:42] a God who's wonderful, but yet he's
[17:44] distant. He's far off and he's not
[17:45] involved. Kind of arms folded and and
[17:48] but this is we have a God that is
[17:50] present and involved. And God identified
[17:54] himself with in history and was and so
[17:58] think about it. He was the God of
[17:59] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was the
[18:01] god of Israel. This was a distinct deity
[18:03] from all other deities.
[18:05] Uh there there was not there was the god
[18:08] that was served and worshiped by Israel
[18:10] and those may be closely related was
[18:12] vastly different than the god of the
[18:14] reprobates and the heathens and the god
[18:16] that the deities worshiped around the
[18:17] world. So think of how unique it was
[18:20] that God would come down and identify
[18:22] himself with one man, Abraham, and then
[18:25] his offspring after him. So that the one
[18:27] true God, the only real eternal one is
[18:30] only identified with a specific class of
[18:32] people.
[18:34] And and it's not that the heathen took
[18:35] umbrage to that. They just said, "Well,
[18:37] your god's a god of the mountains, so if
[18:38] we could just get you in the valley, we
[18:40] our gods could beat you." What
[18:41] difference? What kindness from the
[18:43] heathens, right? That you got your god.
[18:45] He's great and he's mighty, but we got
[18:47] our God, too. He's great and mighty. We
[18:48] just need to get on the right kind of
[18:49] ground to beat you. But this is the one
[18:51] true God identified with Israel and he
[18:54] was present with Israel.
[18:58] And the I am now
[19:01] is
[19:03] uh expressing himself and manifested
[19:05] himself to the Jews through Jesus
[19:07] Christ.
[19:10] This God who was
[19:14] declared and known by Abraham, known by
[19:17] Isaac, known by Jacob personally face to
[19:21] faith are these uh visions and these
[19:23] dreams and the speaking to them. He
[19:25] declared himself and revealed himself to
[19:27] them and then identified himself with
[19:29] the children of Israel. Now this God is
[19:31] manifested in his son Jesus Christ. What
[19:34] what I want you to think about is this
[19:36] concept and this is what we're going to
[19:37] be amplifying is he be he was opened up
[19:41] to Israel
[19:43] and that this hidden mystery was
[19:46] manifested through Christ to Israel.
[19:49] John 5:es 37-39
[19:54] we'll just read to verse 38 here at the
[19:56] outset. And the father himself which has
[19:58] sent me Christ speaking hath borne
[20:00] witness of me. You've neither heard his
[20:04] voice at any time nor seen his shape and
[20:07] you have not his word abiding in you.
[20:09] For whom he hath sent him ye believe
[20:11] not. We ended the service. This is what
[20:14] we're focusing on at the end of last
[20:16] Sunday. And I want to spend more time
[20:19] looking at this passage of scripture.
[20:21] Says the father hath borne witness of
[20:24] me. He is the one that hath sent me. And
[20:26] he says so then Christ could be is
[20:28] speaking of himself even when he says
[20:30] for whom he hath sent him you have not
[20:32] believed. So the father hath sent me.
[20:33] You don't believe me. Therefore, you
[20:35] have not his word abiding in you or some
[20:38] something in you that identifies the
[20:41] sending. And he makes this statement, he
[20:44] hath borne witness of me. Jesus is
[20:47] referring specifically to how that God
[20:50] had spoken of him beforehand that this
[20:53] is not he didn't just show up like there
[20:55] was never a promise of a messiah. We
[20:57] weren't looking for a deliverer. We
[20:59] weren't looking for an anointed one. But
[21:01] the prophets had spoken of him
[21:03] beforehand. God by his prophets had
[21:05] foretold of the Messiah. So he's saying,
[21:08] "God, my father, bore witness of me
[21:11] through the prophets that you believed
[21:13] in and received. I have been spoken of
[21:15] beforehand." Now, we could bring it in
[21:17] the present tense and we could see that
[21:19] even in the ministry of Jesus Christ,
[21:20] the father had spoke at his baptism.
[21:22] This is my beloved son. So he had spoke
[21:25] through the prophets. But now in present
[21:27] tense, he could say that he hath borne
[21:28] witness of me. But now
[21:32] a so now it's not just the words of the
[21:34] prophets but he's standing before them
[21:38] as the unveiling of those witnesses says
[21:41] the father hath borne witness of me. So
[21:43] you can say well this witness said this
[21:44] and this witness said that and this
[21:46] testified to this and you have all the
[21:48] prophets that spoke of this coming
[21:50] anointed one this Messiah and now he's
[21:53] standing there as the unveiling of all
[21:55] those prophecies.
[21:58] And he says, 'Ye have neither heard his
[21:59] voice at any time nor seen his shape.'
[22:02] So I I find this sentence very striking.
[22:04] The father himself which has sent me
[22:06] hath borne witness of me. Ye have
[22:08] neither heard his voice at any time nor
[22:10] seen his shape. To hear you neither
[22:12] heard, that means obey. Not just
[22:14] necessarily the the resonance or the
[22:16] sound. It means to obey. And to see see
[22:19] his shape or seen his shape. It means to
[22:21] pay attention to or regard.
[22:24] Now,
[22:26] I've pondered this uh for some time last
[22:29] week,
[22:31] and and the the the phrasing of it is
[22:34] what caught begin to strike me is we
[22:38] know
[22:40] uh that God is invisible, yet we know
[22:43] that God expressed himself to Israel.
[22:46] And when he says, "You have not obeyed
[22:48] him in hearing his voice. Neither have
[22:49] you seen his shape, paid attention to or
[22:51] regarded him, they had not seen or heard
[22:54] him in the revelation of himself that
[22:57] was given in the scriptures." Because
[22:59] when Jesus says, "You have not the word
[23:00] abiding in you because he that sent me,
[23:04] you didn't you didn't believe in me when
[23:06] he sent me." So there wasn't something
[23:08] that matched. Steven Brother Ram talks
[23:10] about the Chinese laundry and he talks
[23:11] about that ripping apart and one has one
[23:13] half and the other has the other and how
[23:15] when you can identify, oh, I was reading
[23:17] this part and and it didn't all fit. But
[23:19] now when this comes, it lines up. It
[23:21] begins to fit together. And that's what
[23:24] he's alluding to that if you had had
[23:25] some proper expectation, if you had some
[23:27] proper understanding and hope, then when
[23:30] he would then I when I would come, you
[23:32] would believe in me because this one who
[23:34] said beforehand that I was coming have
[23:36] sent me. And so they didn't recognize
[23:39] him. Present tense is what I really want
[23:42] to focus on. They didn't recognize him
[23:44] in the character of his word because
[23:46] they didn't know what to look for. Now
[23:49] if you ponder that and and run that
[23:50] through the message of the hour, you'll
[23:52] find that brother Brandham in several
[23:53] places especially at the op after the
[23:55] opening the seals is identifying how the
[23:58] wrong kind of expectation. They were
[24:00] looking for the wrong thing and they had
[24:02] the wrong idea of the way things were
[24:03] supposed to be. They didn't know what to
[24:05] look for. But therefore, when he comes
[24:06] in his when he comes as a manifestation,
[24:09] they're not able to recognize him in the
[24:11] character of his word. Thus, he makes
[24:13] the statement, "You have not the
[24:15] testimony of this word is not present as
[24:17] an abiding power within you. You have
[24:19] not this word abiding in you because
[24:21] when I when I was sent and you saw me,
[24:25] you didn't regard me. You didn't pay
[24:26] attention to me." And so, it showed
[24:28] something was lacking or missing. And in
[24:30] John 1:18 is just referencing it very
[24:32] quickly as we read last time that no man
[24:34] hath seen God at any time. We know that
[24:37] refers to God being invisible and
[24:39] hidden. But the scripture tells us the
[24:41] only begotten son, he has declared him.
[24:44] He has he has manifested him. So when
[24:49] Jesus says you have neither heard his
[24:51] voice at any time or nor seen his shape
[24:54] there is an idea that it's not just so
[24:57] much the external image that strikes the
[24:59] eye but it's to pay attention to a
[25:01] regard
[25:03] and then there's something to the shape.
[25:05] Shape does not mean God himself because
[25:07] God himself cannot be seen
[25:10] but the shape means his visible
[25:12] manifestation or his visible appearance.
[25:15] something that would make God known,
[25:17] something that would reveal God. And God
[25:19] had appeared, or if I could say this,
[25:21] God had shaped himself to Israel many
[25:24] times, right? God was in the cloud. He
[25:28] followed Israel in the Exodus. He was in
[25:29] the pillar of fire. He had actually his
[25:31] glory was even seen on Moses. And we can
[25:33] see that there's many ways that God had
[25:35] manifested himself to the children of
[25:36] Israel. God had shaped himself in many
[25:39] ways to Israel. But through time, in the
[25:42] witness of his prophets, and he he had
[25:44] spoke to them. He was the voice in the
[25:46] prophets. Says, "You haven't heard my
[25:48] voice." They hadn't obeyed his voice.
[25:50] When he says, "You had not seen my
[25:52] shape. You have not paid attention to or
[25:54] regarded my appearings to you." And so
[25:58] through time, the reality of God had
[25:59] become completely hides
[26:03] covered up by tradition. Jesus
[26:04] identified tradition, mythology, all
[26:06] these other falsities that covered
[26:08] among. So now Jesus says they did not
[26:11] pay attention to you have not seen his
[26:13] shape. paid attention to or regarded the
[26:15] manifestation of God.
[26:18] And this to me
[26:20] help helps us to understand John 14:9.
[26:23] When you've seen me, you've seen the
[26:25] father.
[26:27] Not that you've actually seen God
[26:28] himself who is an invisible being, but
[26:31] you have not paid attention to or
[26:33] regarded the manifestation of God. I am
[26:37] the manifestation of God in human flesh.
[26:39] I'm not just his appearing. I'm not just
[26:42] his uh uh shape in a cloud. I'm not just
[26:46] his shape in the pillar of fire. I'm not
[26:47] just his voice in one of the prophets,
[26:49] but I I am his presence. I am his word
[26:52] made flesh. I am uh uh revealing myself.
[26:56] I am revealing God. When you see me, you
[26:57] are seeing the manifestation of God. Not
[27:00] in just some partial appearing and not
[27:02] just some outpouring, but I am the
[27:04] visible manifestation of God. I am the
[27:07] living word that makes God present.
[27:09] Amen.
[27:11] And he's saying,
[27:13] "He that hath seen the father or he that
[27:16] seen me hath seen the father. He that
[27:17] regards me or tends to me. He that
[27:19] regards me and sees this manifested
[27:21] reality regards and attends to the
[27:23] father."
[27:25] So Jesus is then, this is what I want
[27:27] you to recognize,
[27:29] begin to identify this in the message
[27:31] masterpiece. But when Jesus came on the
[27:34] scene, he was the fulfillment.
[27:36] He was the fulfillment of everything God
[27:38] had promised. He was the perfect
[27:41] identical image of the promise.
[27:44] Therefore, all promises of the Old
[27:46] Testament were met in Jesus Christ. Now,
[27:49] recognize where in in the unfolding of
[27:53] God's plan, the Old Testament is given
[27:56] promises given to Israel codified or in
[27:59] the in the Old Testament, the the
[28:02] scribes writing down the prophecies, the
[28:04] written word, the oral tradition that
[28:06] tried to keep that alive. He's saying
[28:08] all promises of the Old Testament are
[28:10] fulfilled in Jesus Christ. He says in
[28:12] another place, he fulfilled the Old
[28:14] Testament. So Christ in his coming,
[28:17] which he says, you've neither heard his
[28:18] voice at any time nor seen his shape.
[28:20] Here is Christ standing there saying,
[28:22] you are not recognizing that all the
[28:24] promises that have to this point been
[28:26] given to you are now being made known
[28:28] before you and yet you will not receive
[28:31] them.
[28:34] So he says in verse 39,
[28:37] this is the taking this very slowly
[28:40] because this part is so important. So he
[28:42] says, "Search the scriptures
[28:45] for them you think you have eternal life
[28:46] and they are they which testify of me."
[28:50] I I hope that there's been sufficient
[28:52] review and then emphasis even in these
[28:54] prior two verses to kind of get us under
[28:57] this expectation and this anticipation
[29:00] that here stands the mighty God unveiled
[29:02] before them in his son. A a and it's
[29:06] it's a it's the fulfillment of all the
[29:09] promises to Israel. It is the
[29:11] fulfillment of their word, their Bible,
[29:14] their scripture.
[29:15] And then he makes this statement that
[29:17] you have not the word of God abiding in
[29:19] you because he has sent me and you won't
[29:21] receive me. I'm just putting it in those
[29:23] terms. So then he his so his response to
[29:27] that is search the scriptures
[29:30] for in them you think you have eternal
[29:31] life and they the scriptures are they
[29:33] which testify of me.
[29:38] I want to identify two points that to me
[29:41] are kind of balancing two balancing
[29:42] points. The way that Jesus says, "Search
[29:44] the scriptures, they testify of me."
[29:47] When Christ says, "Search the
[29:48] scriptures," he honors the written word.
[29:51] Very important to recognize that that
[29:53] Christ though he is the fulfillment of
[29:55] the written word, he is honoring the
[29:57] written word and he's declaring that all
[29:59] have the right and I would say this, the
[30:01] duty to search the written scriptures.
[30:05] He he is not he's not doing away with
[30:07] anything that has been said before. He's
[30:09] not trying to circumvent any order or
[30:11] program of God or saying, "Ah, you know,
[30:12] forget about the prophets of old. Now
[30:14] that I'm here, we can all have fun." He
[30:16] he's he's saying, "Hey, the the written
[30:19] word has been provided to you. So, you
[30:20] have a right to it, and you have a duty
[30:24] to search it."
[30:26] So, and he's lifting up the written
[30:27] word. He's lifting up what would be
[30:29] their Bible. And then immediately, he
[30:31] says, "Search the scriptures." He
[30:34] immediately says, "They testify of me."
[30:37] And in doing so, he has given this
[30:39] wonderful these two balancing points.
[30:41] The word of God as being your right to
[30:44] search and you have a duty to search
[30:46] because in them is declaring to you the
[30:49] mind of God or the revelation of God.
[30:51] But then he warns against relying in the
[30:53] written word alone without the living
[30:56] word. Because he says you can look to
[30:58] the written word a and identify and
[31:01] search the written word but you he's
[31:03] saying they testify of me. So the
[31:05] written word is a witness of the living
[31:07] word.
[31:09] And it's not enough just to have the
[31:10] written word. You must also have the
[31:12] living word because here he was the word
[31:14] made flesh. He's saying search the
[31:16] written word. They testify of the living
[31:19] word that now stands before you.
[31:22] And in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 6 it who
[31:25] also is of speaking of God who also hath
[31:27] made us able ministers of the New
[31:30] Testament. Catch that very language that
[31:32] Paul is using. Not of the letter. Now,
[31:35] this relates to the New Testament, but
[31:36] think of how its application to the Old
[31:38] Testament. Not of the letter, but of the
[31:40] spirit. For the letter kleth, but the
[31:43] spirit giveth life.
[31:45] I know we're time is uh going by very
[31:48] quickly this morning, and so I hope to
[31:50] come back to this, but no, so keep this
[31:52] scripture in mind. Paul is a minister of
[31:55] a new covenant, a new testament, a new
[31:57] testifying, a new witness. but not just
[32:00] of the letter of it, but he's a a
[32:03] minister of the spirit. Because he says
[32:05] this statement, the letter can kill, but
[32:07] it's the spirit that gives life.
[32:11] And so the scriptures, when Jesus says,
[32:13] "Search the scriptures," it's literally
[32:14] the writings. He's saying, "Search the
[32:16] writings."
[32:18] And this is even a contrast
[32:21] kind of a touches on the word that is
[32:24] that has not been abiding in them. You
[32:27] have the written word externally.
[32:30] So search that. But yet he's identifying
[32:32] something the word that's lacking. So he
[32:34] uses the writings as opposed to the
[32:36] word. You have not the word abiding in
[32:38] you. So go back and search the writings.
[32:41] And I believe it's a distinction in
[32:43] language. That's very important. And to
[32:46] the Jews, the scriptures literally where
[32:49] are the writings of Moses and the
[32:50] prophets that they believe to be
[32:53] divinely inspired that they held very
[32:54] precious to them. So when Jesus says
[32:56] search the scriptures, there was no ambu
[32:58] ambiguity to a Jew. He knew exactly what
[33:01] these scriptures were. So he says search
[33:04] the scriptures like well what do you
[33:06] mean by that? What do you mean by
[33:07] writings? If we said you know you need
[33:09] to go read the book you some people
[33:11] might well what book? What book? What
[33:12] book? Right? We know what we're talking
[33:14] about. We say the Bible the scripture
[33:15] the written word. To them it was very
[33:17] clear what the scriptures were. So when
[33:18] he says search the scriptures it means
[33:20] search diligently. The word actually
[33:22] implies search anxiously.
[33:25] And the word is used of one of a minor
[33:29] who is is mining for precious metals who
[33:32] is anxiously looking at the bed of ore
[33:35] and and anxiously looking at the ground
[33:37] with this intensity that's proportionate
[33:40] to the value of the ore that he's trying
[33:42] to mine.
[33:44] I I just think that is so awesome the
[33:46] way he says search the scriptures. It's
[33:48] not just kind of like ah, you know, kind
[33:50] of look through this, but it's as one
[33:51] who's looking into something in order to
[33:53] get the gold out of it. And so to search
[33:56] anxiously is to view the word of God
[33:58] with this intense desire in this anxious
[34:02] longing as one who is digging through
[34:04] the ground with this ferveny, knowing
[34:08] that that that what they're looking for,
[34:11] the intensity is matching proportionally
[34:14] the value of the metal they stand to
[34:16] find.
[34:18] There's a there has to be some way for
[34:21] you to kind of recognize that even if we
[34:23] have to use the example of after church
[34:26] today when everyone's arguing over where
[34:27] they want to go eat
[34:29] a and we can't seem to come to a
[34:31] conclusion and so finally one you know
[34:33] one little group wins out and the the
[34:35] arms have been twisted and the side
[34:36] deals have been made and all of a sudden
[34:38] it's like well we're all going here and
[34:39] the one person who really wanted to go
[34:41] somewhere else is like that's fine I'll
[34:43] go and they go right but they're not
[34:46] really looking forward to
[34:47] Why? Because their desire is
[34:50] proportionate to what they feel they're
[34:52] going to get.
[34:56] But when you know you're going to
[35:02] maybe why I'm feeling so good today. I
[35:03] had it two days in a row.
[35:07] If you're ever going, let me know. I'll
[35:08] give you a 20 and you can buy me one.
[35:10] I'll put it in the freezer. They they
[35:12] keep
[35:13] uh there's a no don't because I I can
[35:16] just imagine I have 50 burritos on
[35:18] Tuesday or next Wednesday. Bring a
[35:20] truck. Uh don't do it please. I get
[35:22] enough of it as it is. I'm wanting to go
[35:23] the other direction. But when you have
[35:25] this intense when you know that there's
[35:27] something good there. This is even the
[35:29] desire we tried to lift up on Wednesday
[35:31] night. We're digging for gold.
[35:32] Appreciate everybody coming out for our
[35:34] first installment of Kids Eat Free. And
[35:36] there's a when there's this expectation
[35:39] of something valuable, there's this
[35:41] greater intensity with which you search.
[35:45] If you're just going to be digging
[35:46] through a field hoping to find some coal
[35:48] or find a rock or just find a piece of
[35:50] dirt, you're not really going to be
[35:51] caring. But when you know there's
[35:53] something in there of value, he's saying
[35:55] search diligently and let it be
[35:57] proportionate to the what you expect to
[35:59] get the value what you expect to get. I
[36:02] I would that that's how we would come to
[36:03] church. I know it may not be the
[36:05] building somebody wanted to be, but I
[36:07] believe that God has made this his house
[36:09] and that we have been blessed with his
[36:11] presence and this room has been a
[36:12] remarkable place for God to move and for
[36:15] people to be blessed. And I have no
[36:17] shame where we're gathering and I'm
[36:19] happy with the place that God has given
[36:20] us. But I would that we would come with
[36:23] an understanding that what we stand to
[36:26] mine out in our times together here are
[36:28] things that are very precious
[36:31] and our attitude towards the word of God
[36:33] ought to match match what we stand to
[36:35] gain.
[36:36] Amen.
[36:37] Be proportionate to the value of the
[36:39] word that we're seeking. God let that
[36:42] be. So he says, "Search the scriptures.
[36:44] They testify of me." He's saying they
[36:46] bear witness of me. I am the great
[36:49] burden of their testimony.
[36:52] I am their testament. If I can look at
[36:54] it this way, the scriptures are
[36:56] testifying,
[36:57] witnessing. They are a testament. They
[37:00] they have this burden that they're
[37:02] delivering. They have this uh something
[37:04] that they're pointing to. So then Christ
[37:07] comes and stands there and he says, "I
[37:08] am the great burden of their witness. I
[37:11] am their testament. I am what they're
[37:13] all were pointing to. I am what they
[37:15] were looking forward to. They witnessed
[37:17] that the Messiah come. They predicted
[37:19] the manner of his coming. They predicted
[37:20] his life. They predicted his death. Here
[37:23] I am I. I am what they said would be.
[37:27] And brother Brandham says in the message
[37:29] the token he said to them, "Search the
[37:31] scriptures for in them you think you
[37:32] have eternal life and they are they that
[37:35] testify of me." In other words, I love
[37:37] this how he get kind of paraphrase he's
[37:40] going to phrase it differently for us.
[37:41] If I don't do what the scripture says is
[37:43] supposed to be done in this day, then
[37:45] I'm an unbeliever. But then who can
[37:48] accuse me of sin? Sin is unbelief. He
[37:50] manifested every promise that God made
[37:53] for that day. He fulfilled it. He met
[37:56] the day because he was the Messiah. And
[37:58] that was the day of the Messiah.
[38:02] He manifested every promise God had made
[38:05] for that day. He was the perfect
[38:07] identical image of the promise. That's
[38:10] what brother Ram said. That's what
[38:12] search the scripture means. I am what is
[38:15] supposed to be here. And if I'm not
[38:18] manifesting what's supposed to be here,
[38:19] then you can call me an unbeliever. But
[38:21] he said, who can accuse me of sin?
[38:25] The mystery of the I am coming as a
[38:27] messiah. And if you can think about it
[38:28] this way, because and I know that we
[38:31] reference this quite often
[38:34] and and I I hope that it's appropriate
[38:36] to do so and it's not just a weakness on
[38:39] my part, but
[38:42] if the if everyone was looking for
[38:46] a man born of a woman who would be a
[38:48] humble man, maybe a carpenter, born in
[38:50] Bethlehem, born at a certain time, if
[38:52] that's what everyone was just anxiously
[38:54] awaiting,
[38:56] then as he began unfold. There'd be
[38:58] people. It would seem kind of obvious
[38:59] that every becom
[39:02] looks like it could be him. You know,
[39:05] well, look at this. His cousin that this
[39:07] is the forerunner. This is Malik. This
[39:09] and start seeing like it just seems like
[39:11] it would everything would kind of match
[39:12] up and line up and and and Fox News and
[39:15] CNN would get along and MSNBC would they
[39:18] would all just agree and say, "Hey, kind
[39:19] of hard to argue with it, right?" But
[39:22] yet, this is not what's happening. Why?
[39:24] Because the mystery of the I am coming
[39:27] as a Messiah that would be a savior. The
[39:30] idea of a savior and a sacrifice is
[39:33] completely hidden to the Jews.
[39:36] It was bound up in the testament.
[39:40] It was bound up in the witness.
[39:43] So the the scriptures testified, but the
[39:46] reality was hid the the the truth of it
[39:50] was hid even in the witness or the
[39:51] testament. It's bound up in the
[39:52] testament and the scriptures, if I could
[39:54] say the scriptures being the Old
[39:56] Testament, we're full of the testimony
[39:58] of Christ. Don't we look back and we see
[40:00] David was a type of Christ and Moses was
[40:02] a type of Christ. And we go through
[40:03] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, all these
[40:05] types of Christ. And then Joseph is a
[40:07] perfect type of Christ. And we see it
[40:10] was Christ, a little bit of Christ
[40:11] manifested here, a little bit of Christ
[40:12] manifested there. You go back to the
[40:14] scriptures, they're all foreshadowing,
[40:16] pointing to the Old Testament pointed
[40:18] forward to Christ. They were full of
[40:20] symbols, full of types, full of
[40:22] prophecies speaking of Christ.
[40:25] So when we get to Luke, so when we come
[40:28] to Luke chapter 24, and so I'm not just
[40:30] going to refer I'm not going to go back
[40:32] and read it. I just want to refer back
[40:33] to it. A and and here Christ has come
[40:36] and done exactly what the word of God,
[40:39] the Old Testament said the Messiah would
[40:41] do. And Jesus had rehearsed it to him
[40:43] while he was with him, right? You find
[40:44] him referring to certain things and then
[40:46] no, hold on. No, you're not gonna die.
[40:47] That's not gonna happen. This is not the
[40:49] when he comes to the place where he's
[40:50] going to he he fulfills exactly what he
[40:53] was called to do. Sacrifice resurrects
[40:56] and he finds his very disciples
[40:58] discouraged and all kind of tore apart.
[41:00] And he says, "Oh fools slow of heart to
[41:02] believe all the prophets have spoken.
[41:06] Oh fools and slow of heart to believe
[41:08] all that the prophets have spoken." Now
[41:11] someone could take issue with that and
[41:12] say, "Oh, so you mean that he fulfilled
[41:14] all all that the prophets have spoken?
[41:17] So everything that had prophesied in the
[41:19] Old Testament, every scripture, every
[41:20] prophecy, every symbol, every type was
[41:21] fulfilled, but the ones pertaining to
[41:24] that day, that manifestation and to the
[41:28] the the full the main intent and purpose
[41:32] of it, the very specific intent of the
[41:35] narrative of the Old Testament.
[41:38] And it says in verse 27, "And
[41:39] beginning," he says, "Ought not Christ
[41:42] have suffered this and entered into his
[41:43] glory." So he's identifies it and
[41:44] beginning at Moses, he's taken their
[41:47] Bible and he begins at Moses and all the
[41:50] prophets. He expounded unto them all the
[41:53] scriptures, the things concerning
[41:55] himself.
[41:57] I wish that was on tape.
[42:00] I wish they had a real tore of that. I
[42:02] mean, I don't we need to go do some u
[42:04] ancestry.com or 23 and me and see if we
[42:07] can't find some descendants of Cleopus
[42:09] and say, "Do you have recordings
[42:11] somewhere?" Amen.
[42:12] I mean anywhere something because that
[42:14] would be something to have, wouldn't it?
[42:16] Beginning at Moses who wrote those the
[42:19] first five books of the Bible, the
[42:21] Pentatuk, he writes this beginning at
[42:24] Moses. I wonder if he began with Genesis
[42:25] 3:15, the seed of the woman.
[42:28] And then he could go right into
[42:30] Deuteronomy 18:5, a prophet like unto
[42:32] Moses. To Exodus 12, the Passover lamb
[42:36] to Numbers 21, the brass serpent lifted
[42:39] up in the wilderness. to Levit Leviticus
[42:41] 17, the shed blood, the atonement, him,
[42:43] his shed blood being the atonement. To
[42:45] Isaiah 9, the wonderful counselor, the
[42:47] mighty God, the everlasting father, the
[42:49] prince of peace to Isaiah 53, being this
[42:52] tender plant, no beauty that we would
[42:53] desire, despised, and rejected like a
[42:55] sheep. Here he is wounded, bruised,
[42:58] chastised, described in his crucifixion.
[43:00] I I wonder if these are the scriptures
[43:02] he begin to go through to Psalm 16 where
[43:04] he says, "I will not suffer my holy one
[43:06] to see corruption." and how he was
[43:08] resurrected on the third day to Psalm
[43:09] 22. The entire psalm is the crucifixion,
[43:14] the very words of Christ and his image
[43:16] on the on the cross to Psalm 41 to Psalm
[43:19] 69 to Psalm 108 to Psalm 110. The Lord
[43:22] said unto my Lord, oh all these
[43:23] different places where he could have
[43:25] been going to read this, read this, read
[43:27] this to Daniel 9 as being the Messiah
[43:29] cut off in the midst of the weak.
[43:32] Oh, I imagine they their their heart was
[43:35] burning. I don't have to imagine it.
[43:38] They said it did. I imagine there was
[43:40] just something going, "Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[43:44] Oh, now now I remember he actually said
[43:47] this would happen." And oh, and there's
[43:49] just something that begins to stir in
[43:50] their hearts. And And if I could just
[43:52] maybe make this jump to our day today, I
[43:55] want you to understand this. If if your
[43:58] heart burns when you hear this word of
[44:00] God, if your heart burns when you listen
[44:03] to the message of the hour, I want you
[44:05] to know that that burning speaks of a
[44:07] revelation. That burning speaks of an
[44:10] unfolding. And don't ever let your heart
[44:13] stop burning until the full revelation
[44:15] of Jesus Christ dawns on you to give you
[44:18] the revelation of the word of God in
[44:20] this hour.
[44:21] Amen.
[44:23] Oh, praise be to God. something just
[44:26] welling up within them and burning. And
[44:28] he said unto them in Luke 24:44, I I
[44:31] didn't read this as a part of our text.
[44:34] But he said he said unto them, "These
[44:37] are
[44:38] the words which I spake unto you while I
[44:41] was yet with you." This is him appearing
[44:44] to them again, saying, "The scriptures
[44:45] are fulfilled. These are the words which
[44:47] I spake unto you while I was yet with
[44:49] you, that all things must be fulfilled
[44:52] which were written in the law of Moses
[44:54] and in the prophets and in the psalms
[44:56] concerning me. I I I believe that that's
[44:59] exactly what he did with those believers
[45:03] on the road to Emmas. What he did with
[45:05] his disciples is he took them through
[45:07] Moses, the prophets, the psalms, and
[45:09] showed them those things concerning him.
[45:12] All things must be fulfilled concerning
[45:14] me which were written in Moses, the
[45:17] prophets, and in the Psalms. So, could
[45:19] we agree to this?
[45:21] There's prophecies in the Old Testament
[45:23] that he did not fulfill, but they didn't
[45:26] concern him.
[45:29] Okay?
[45:32] I know some of you would say it's true,
[45:35] but maybe it's just so obvious to
[45:36] others. They didn't really feel like I
[45:37] needed the affirmation.
[45:40] But he says, 'All things must be
[45:41] fulfilled which were written by Moses,
[45:43] the prophets and psalms concerning me,
[45:45] the word in that day, that time. And
[45:47] brother Brandham in the message, and
[45:49] when their eyes were open, they knew
[45:50] him. He says, "Now we find that that
[45:52] unusual thing was the thing that they
[45:54] couldn't get." And this resurrection was
[45:57] unusual. They and yet they would have
[45:59] noticed it. It was his promised word. He
[46:02] had told them, said, "The son of man
[46:03] goes to Jerusalem. He'll suffer many
[46:04] things to the Gentiles, be delivered in
[46:06] their hands, and be crucified, be
[46:07] buried, and will rise the third day."
[46:08] It's exactly what he had said. He said
[46:10] also as Jonah laid in the belly of a
[46:12] whale three days and night, so must the
[46:13] son of man be in the heart of the earth
[46:15] three days and nights. He exactly told
[46:17] him that David, one of the prophets
[46:18] prophesied, I will not leave his soul in
[46:20] hell, neither suffer my holy one to see
[46:21] corruption.
[46:23] These are things that Jesus specifically
[46:25] rehearsed to them. So here's the written
[46:28] word.
[46:30] Here's the living word rehearsing the
[46:33] written word of even things that are to
[46:35] be so that when it happens it would give
[46:37] them confidence that he is the word
[46:40] says and all the prophets spoke of him
[46:42] and looked like these disciples yet
[46:44] looked like they would have they would
[46:46] have recognized it and should have known
[46:48] this but you see it was withheld from
[46:50] them
[46:53] and the promise word to them and yet
[46:54] they didn't recognize it
[46:57] and now notice this it was fulfilled
[47:01] I I'll say this now. It's remarkable. I
[47:04] want it's I want to remark about this.
[47:05] It's notable that the promise was
[47:08] written, then rehearsed by Christ, then
[47:11] fulfilled,
[47:13] but yet not revealed.
[47:16] Right? Written, rehearsed,
[47:19] done,
[47:21] but yet it's withheld from someone.
[47:24] Doesn't it doesn't it seem like it would
[47:25] be very very easy if it said on March
[47:29] 20th this is going to happen and then on
[47:32] March 19th someone says on March 20th
[47:34] this is going to happen and then on
[47:36] March 20th it happens. It seems like
[47:37] everybody would high-five or go yep just
[47:40] exactly. But yet it can be withheld.
[47:44] I want you to I I want you to note that.
[47:46] But he says it was fulfilled exactly
[47:48] what he said would happen. What the Old
[47:51] Testament said would happen. It was
[47:52] perfectly fulfilled. And yet they didn't
[47:54] understand it.
[47:56] It was fulfilled in reality.
[48:00] It was written sometimes in symbol form,
[48:03] prophesied, manifested in types and
[48:05] shadows. But now the truth of it is
[48:07] manifest. It is a manifested reality,
[48:10] but it's withholden. And I want to know
[48:11] it's withholden. The focus, what I want
[48:13] you to recognize here is not the lack of
[48:16] re of revelation, but the order and the
[48:19] method of God fulfilling his word from
[48:21] the written word to the living word to
[48:23] the manifestation of it to the the
[48:25] written her word to the rehearsing of it
[48:27] and then the fulfillment of it. This is
[48:29] God's way of bringing a reality of his
[48:32] word.
[48:33] And so here's Jesus. I have to kind of
[48:36] recollect myself here
[48:39] uh uh that to get to this scripture in
[48:41] Psalm 40. Here's Jesus standing there
[48:45] and he says this is the I am and he says
[48:48] search the scriptures because they
[48:51] testify of me.
[48:53] I am the living word made manifest. And
[48:56] notice what the scripture says of him in
[48:57] Psalm 40 6 to10. Sacrifice and offering
[49:01] thou didest not did desire not desire.
[49:04] Mine ears hast thou opened? Burnt
[49:07] offering and sin offering hast thou not
[49:09] required.
[49:10] Now, mine ears hast thou opened.
[49:17] You're familiar in Hebrews chapter 10
[49:18] where Paul takes this very same psalm
[49:22] and he writes it. And in the Hebrew, my
[49:25] ears hast thou opened. This is how it's
[49:28] translated in the English. In a lot of
[49:29] other languages when it was translated,
[49:32] it's translated to a body thou hast
[49:34] prepared me. In the Syriak in these
[49:36] different versions, this is what it this
[49:37] is what is meant. My ears hast thou
[49:39] opened. You've given me an ear to hear.
[49:40] Without a body, you couldn't hear. And
[49:43] so he's saying you burnt offering and
[49:45] sin offering thou hast not required a
[49:46] body of thou hast prepared me. And it's
[49:48] exactly what Paul writes in Hebrews
[49:49] 10:5. Wherefore when he cometh into the
[49:51] world, he saith, sacrifice an offering,
[49:52] thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou
[49:55] prepared me. Who is this? Jesus Christ.
[49:59] So verse seven, then said I, lo, I come
[50:03] in the volume of the book. It is written
[50:05] of me. I delight to do thy will, oh God.
[50:09] Yay, thy law is within my heart. I have
[50:11] preached righteousness in the great
[50:12] congregation. Lo, I have not refrained
[50:15] my lips, oh Lord, thou knowest. I have
[50:17] not hid thy righteousness within my
[50:19] heart. I have declared thy faithfulness
[50:21] and thy salvation. I have not concealed
[50:22] thy loving kindness and thy truth from
[50:24] the great congregation. a body thou hast
[50:27] prepared me. And so he says, I come.
[50:30] Now, this is his coming. In the volume
[50:34] of the book, it is written of me. In the
[50:36] volume of the book, and it says, I
[50:40] delight to do thy will. The law is
[50:43] within my heart.
[50:45] So, it's embodied in this body. It's at
[50:47] the heart. It's at the center of this
[50:49] one who is giving this who who it was
[50:52] written of before, who has come. And
[50:54] then notice, I have preached. I have not
[50:57] refrained my lips. I have not hid. I
[50:59] have declared. I have not concealed.
[51:01] What? Righteousness. Uh the
[51:04] righteousness that was within his heart,
[51:05] the faithfulness, the salvation, the
[51:07] loving kindness, and the truth. I have
[51:09] done these things. Oh, it's such a
[51:11] beautiful picture. This body that has
[51:13] been prepared. That at the very heart of
[51:15] it is the law of God that has preached,
[51:18] not refrained his lips, has not hid, has
[51:20] declared, and has not concealed. He's
[51:22] declared truth. He's declared
[51:23] righteousness.
[51:26] As Paul writes it, "Lo, I come in the
[51:29] volume of the book. It is written of me
[51:31] to do thy will, oh God." If I could say
[51:33] it this way, his coming was written in
[51:36] the volume of the book. I I I've heard
[51:40] some ministers take it and maybe not
[51:43] necessarily any ones that we would know
[51:45] uh that you would know, but they took
[51:47] this phrase as, "Lo, I come in the
[51:49] volume of the book." that his coming was
[51:52] in the book. And and it's maybe just
[51:55] maybe a little bit of a unique emphasis,
[51:56] but we could say that surely in symbol
[51:59] form and in type, this is a revelation
[52:01] of Jesus Christ. This is God of Christ
[52:03] in written form. So there's there's a a
[52:06] a laying out of him. But now he's
[52:09] saying, I actually come in fulfillment
[52:12] of what is written in the book. And and
[52:15] I'll just have to pick up on some of
[52:16] this next Sunday, Lord willing, if not
[52:19] Wednesday. I come in the volume of the
[52:22] book. I come in the scroll or the role
[52:25] of the book.
[52:27] And and when it says, "Lo, I come in the
[52:29] volume of the book in Psalm 40." That
[52:30] would have been the the first five books
[52:32] that were written by Moses, the
[52:33] Pentatuk, that's what they would have
[52:34] been referring to. Lo, I come in the
[52:36] volume of the book. So the promise of
[52:39] Christ, the coming of Christ is
[52:41] prophesied in written in the scroll. the
[52:44] role of the law.
[52:46] Are you thinking about even this image?
[52:48] Lo, lo, I have come in the volume of the
[52:51] rolling of the scroll. It was written of
[52:53] me. So when he came, if you could just
[52:56] ponder this. So when he came, he's un
[53:00] unrolling
[53:01] that book.
[53:03] Search the scriptures
[53:05] for they are they which testify of me.
[53:08] that there's this dynamic that's taking
[53:10] place to where now now that I've
[53:13] unrolled it. Go back and look at it.
[53:18] It would have been impossible. I I say
[53:20] this maybe with some reservation in my
[53:23] heart, but it certainly would have been
[53:25] very likely a feudal exercise to try to
[53:28] do that a hundred years before and
[53:30] pinpoint who Christ would be.
[53:33] But now that he's come, he's saying,
[53:35] "Search the scriptures and you'll find
[53:38] that I'm doing exactly what the Bible
[53:40] said I would be doing in the day that it
[53:43] was to be done." Why? Because he's
[53:45] saying, "This book may have been rolled
[53:46] up to you at one point, but now I've
[53:49] opened it. I've unrolled it. Lo, I've
[53:51] come in the volume of the scroll. I've
[53:54] laid it out before you so that you can
[53:56] look at it. And oh, if it would come out
[53:59] to you from the pages to recognize the
[54:02] word standing before you.
[54:05] When he came, he opened the book.
[54:09] Holy scriptures were talking about he
[54:10] opened it. Light was shining on the
[54:12] word. Why? Because it was a living
[54:13] reality.
[54:15] And it says, "Lo, I come to do thy
[54:18] will." And it was written in the volume
[54:20] of the book. The word was in him. He
[54:22] says, "The law was within my heart and I
[54:25] did not hide it. I have declared it. I
[54:27] did not conceal it. In other words, I
[54:29] have opened up that which was sealed.
[54:32] I have opened the book.
[54:36] This is Christ. This is what Christ is
[54:38] saying in his days on earth. Right? This
[54:43] is me looking at the I am is an open
[54:47] book now in Christ
[54:50] when it comes to the prophecies of the
[54:52] Old Testament. So in Luke 4 17 to 21
[55:06] and there was delivered unto him he he
[55:08] comes as his custom was as his manner
[55:10] was he comes to the temple he's going to
[55:13] church that's what Christ did that's
[55:15] what Christians do and there was
[55:16] delivered unto him the book of the
[55:18] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[55:21] the book.
[55:23] What a what a wonderful symbolic act
[55:28] in Luke chapter 4. This is now early on
[55:32] in his in his ministry in the narrative
[55:34] of Luke
[55:38] because if you find
[55:43] even in the narrative of Luke, he comes
[55:46] out of the wilderness in his temptation
[55:48] and he returns in the spirit of God and
[55:51] he teaches in the synagogue.
[55:54] And so here he is at the beginning of
[55:55] his ministry and according to Luke, the
[55:58] first act that he does
[56:01] as he takes the book and opens it. Now
[56:05] it wouldn't have been the New Testament,
[56:07] right? It's not written yet, but he took
[56:09] their written word and it says, "And he
[56:12] opened in the book of Isaiah. He opened
[56:15] the book and he found the place where it
[56:17] was written."
[56:20] And he begins to say, begins to read,
[56:23] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[56:25] because he hath anointed me to preach
[56:28] the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me
[56:30] to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
[56:32] deliverance to the captives, and recover
[56:33] of sight to the blind, and to set at
[56:35] liberty them that are bruised, and to
[56:37] pre to preach the acceptable year of the
[56:39] Lord." And Isaiah continues, but he
[56:41] stops. Says, "And he closed the book."
[56:45] Oh, what beautiful symbolism
[56:49] is being represented here. He in his
[56:51] this act in his ministry, he opens the
[56:53] book and what does he begin to do? Point
[56:55] out where it's written of him. Here's
[56:57] the living word who is anointed to do
[56:59] this. Preach the gospel to the poor,
[57:01] heal the brokenhearted, to preach
[57:03] deliverance to captives, recovering
[57:04] sight to the blind, to sit at liberty
[57:06] them, and to preach the acceptable year
[57:08] of the Lord. Light was shining on that.
[57:10] Here it is being opened up before him,
[57:13] but he can't read another word because
[57:15] that's not opened yet. So, he closed it.
[57:18] He unfolds a certain part and he
[57:20] rehearses it to him. But then when he
[57:23] gets to that part in a symbolic act, he
[57:26] rolls it back up. Why? Because that part
[57:29] wasn't opened yet.
[57:30] Amen.
[57:31] Because that was going to be something
[57:32] he would do at another time. That was a
[57:34] prophecy that didn't concern him then.
[57:37] But that would be done in another day.
[57:39] And in that day, there'd have to be
[57:41] another unfolding of the scroll for
[57:44] light to shine on it again. Oh, I hope
[57:47] you can see what my inspiration is
[57:49] today. We're not reading a closed book.
[57:53] We're not guessing. We're not arguing.
[57:55] We're not trying to figure it out. We're
[57:57] walking in the light.
[58:01] He closes it again and he gives it to
[58:03] the minister and he sits down. And
[58:05] notice this. And all the eyes and the
[58:07] eyes of all them that were in the
[58:09] synagogue were fastened on him.
[58:12] And the presence of all these people,
[58:15] they hand him they hand him a scroll
[58:20] of Isaiah.
[58:23] And only he knows
[58:25] just how far to open it
[58:29] right to the place where it's written of
[58:30] him
[58:32] and to say to preach the acceptable year
[58:35] of the Lord and without unfolding it any
[58:38] further
[58:40] closes it back up
[58:43] and there everyone watches him do it.
[58:44] their eyes are fashioned on him and
[58:47] they're still looking at him in that
[58:48] very moment looking at him and he began
[58:51] to say unto them this day is this
[58:54] scripture fulfilled in your ears
[58:59] in other places in the Bible it says and
[59:00] with many other words there's this
[59:02] exhortation this expounding upon things
[59:05] so we know that this wasn't I I'll just
[59:08] this is just brother Aaron saying this
[59:10] he says he began to say unto them this
[59:13] day This scripture is fulfilled in your
[59:15] words. It says, "And all bear witness
[59:16] and wondered at the gracious words which
[59:18] proceeded out of his mouth. He said
[59:20] more."
[59:23] But what was he saying? This day this
[59:25] scripture is fulfilled in your ears.
[59:28] Everything he begin to say was going to
[59:30] connect back to what he had just opened
[59:32] up. He opened the book. He found the
[59:34] prophecies pertaining to him. And then
[59:36] he begins to say, "This day, this
[59:38] scripture is fulfilled in your ears." He
[59:41] opened the book. He pointed them to the
[59:44] scriptures that were made reality before
[59:46] them. But then he closes the book. Why?
[59:49] Because the remainder of the prophecy
[59:50] was not for that time.
[59:53] That part remains sealed.
[59:57] I have I I'll close here.
[1:00:00] I have one, two, three more scriptures
[1:00:04] to read and another statement to read to
[1:00:07] you from the message. I know that gives
[1:00:10] you absolutely no basis to figure out
[1:00:13] how much longer I'll be. I realize that.
[1:00:15] But maybe you can just count down,
[1:00:16] right?
[1:00:19] But the mystery, if I can say, I want to
[1:00:21] close. I want to close. I want to just
[1:00:22] share this in a way that kind of at
[1:00:23] least leaves me in a place where I can
[1:00:24] continue, but I I want to be able to
[1:00:26] close this off. The mystery of the Old
[1:00:28] Testament was made a reality.
[1:00:32] The light was shining on the word. The
[1:00:34] next step, you say, "Oh, but there's
[1:00:36] there's prophecies of the millennium in
[1:00:38] the Old Testament." That's true. But
[1:00:40] they couldn't come till he came. Like
[1:00:42] you can't get to the millennium unless
[1:00:44] first there's a cross. So in the order
[1:00:47] of the word of God, what was next? What
[1:00:49] concerned the Messiah? What concerned
[1:00:50] the deliverer? What was the what God had
[1:00:52] been pointing to in all that? If I could
[1:00:54] say this, and it's very beautiful how
[1:00:56] this works out. There's certain things
[1:00:57] that are written in the word of God that
[1:00:59] pertain to Christ, which God's main
[1:01:01] emphasis was Genesis 3:15. Everything
[1:01:04] unfolds and then it comes and then the
[1:01:06] rest is a consequence of that. The
[1:01:09] millennium is a consequence of the
[1:01:10] sacrifice. These are things that flow
[1:01:13] out from that. And there's a there's a
[1:01:14] truth and I'm maybe getting ahead of
[1:01:16] myself. The same for the New Testament.
[1:01:18] There's we can say, "Oh, well, there's
[1:01:20] still prophecies that need to be fi
[1:01:21] fulfilled." I I had a a very odd
[1:01:24] situation happened to me a few years ago
[1:01:26] where I was in the home of a pastor and
[1:01:28] and he made this very striking comment
[1:01:30] to me. I was preaching for him that
[1:01:32] weekend and he goes, "Well, you know, I
[1:01:33] think we've put way too much emphasis on
[1:01:35] this and that." And I'm like, "Wow,
[1:01:37] okay. This is this is very interesting."
[1:01:38] Backtrack on his part. He goes, "There's
[1:01:40] just so many scriptures in the New
[1:01:43] Testament that need to be fulfilled,
[1:01:44] Brother Aaron." And I said, and we're in
[1:01:46] his home. We're just in his home and I
[1:01:47] was I was just in fellowship. I said,
[1:01:49] "Oh, well, what would those scriptures
[1:01:51] be?" "Well, I don't know. I don't have a
[1:01:53] Bible on me." I'm like,
[1:01:57] I mean, are you sure we couldn't get a
[1:01:59] Bible in your house? I I might have got
[1:02:02] my phone and said, "Hey, I've got an
[1:02:04] app. Pull it up right now." Well, you
[1:02:06] know, you know, just promises. Well, if
[1:02:09] there's promises that need to be
[1:02:10] fulfilled, I want to see them. And keep
[1:02:12] in mind, there's still yet promises that
[1:02:15] need to be fulfilled.
[1:02:17] But recognize the promises that can't be
[1:02:21] fulfilled until these promises are
[1:02:23] fulfilled
[1:02:25] and get them in the correct order.
[1:02:30] And light then in Christ, he fulfills
[1:02:33] the Old Testament. He fulfilled the Old
[1:02:35] Test. He was the perfect identical image
[1:02:37] of the promise. He fulfilled all the
[1:02:39] promises of the Old Testament. They're
[1:02:40] met in Jesus Christ. those things
[1:02:43] concerning him, the language he used
[1:02:45] this day, the scriptures fulfilled in
[1:02:46] your ears, all things that must be
[1:02:48] fulfilled which were written in the law
[1:02:50] of Moses, the prophets and psalms
[1:02:51] concerning me. Search the scriptures,
[1:02:53] they testify of me. These are the things
[1:02:54] I'm wanting you to think about. The
[1:02:56] written word of God, the Old Testament
[1:02:57] scrolls, the law and the prophets had
[1:03:00] Christ opened the scroll. The Old
[1:03:02] Testament had become a new book.
[1:03:06] Think of how new it had really in
[1:03:07] reality had become to them.
[1:03:10] But the book remained closed without
[1:03:14] revelation.
[1:03:16] The meaning, the truth, the purpose. So
[1:03:19] if I could say this in my as my closing
[1:03:21] thought, the Old Testament had opened in
[1:03:23] reality.
[1:03:26] It opened in reality but still need to
[1:03:29] be open to the individual by revelation.
[1:03:32] something can open absolutely manifest
[1:03:35] in reality but still be sealed to the
[1:03:38] person when it comes to revelation.
[1:03:43] 2 Corinthians 3:6 I I told you I'd come
[1:03:45] back to this. Who hath made us able
[1:03:47] ministers of the New Testament, not of
[1:03:48] the letter, but of the spirit. For the
[1:03:51] letter kleth, but the spirit giveth
[1:03:52] life.
[1:03:55] Brother David was singing it and
[1:03:57] dramatizing it. the knowledge of the
[1:03:59] letter crucified Christ.
[1:04:02] Did they not crucify him by quoting the
[1:04:05] letter? Did they not believe that he was
[1:04:07] in violation of the letter? And those
[1:04:09] who were the most passionate about the
[1:04:11] letter, those that were the most ardent
[1:04:14] supporters and uh scribes, the ones that
[1:04:17] wrote down, the ones that wrote down so
[1:04:19] everyone else could get it. They're the
[1:04:21] ones that were tasked with taking the
[1:04:23] word and providing and making it avail.
[1:04:25] They're the ones that took the very word
[1:04:27] of God. the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[1:04:29] and all them, they took the written word
[1:04:31] and that's what they used to crucify the
[1:04:34] living word.
[1:04:36] That's who did it. The very ones who
[1:04:38] would have known the written word. So he
[1:04:39] says the letter kills the the the
[1:04:41] written part can kill if you don't
[1:04:44] recognize this part of it.
[1:04:48] You've got to recognize
[1:04:52] and if I could say this, we can believe
[1:04:54] the symbol form. We could believe the
[1:04:56] prophetic form of something,
[1:05:00] but after it becomes a reality,
[1:05:02] you need a revelation.
[1:05:04] So you have faith. You have faith in the
[1:05:07] written word. And that faith in the
[1:05:09] written word is what you must have. So
[1:05:11] then if the word's written and you have
[1:05:14] faith in your heart in the written word,
[1:05:15] once that word becomes flesh,
[1:05:18] that to have faith in that is one thing.
[1:05:21] But once it becomes flesh, what you need
[1:05:23] is a revelation of the fulfillment.
[1:05:26] Because then you enter into that that
[1:05:27] slippery slope of faith in the written
[1:05:30] words made void when you deny the
[1:05:32] fulfillment of it.
[1:05:34] Then it is the faith really abiding in
[1:05:36] you. when this faith in the promise
[1:05:40] cannot translate to revelation in the
[1:05:43] fulfillment.
[1:05:49] I I I'll just I'll I'll skip
[1:05:53] I'll just make quick reference to it.
[1:05:55] What did Paul say?
[1:05:58] And and I'll amplify it in the in next
[1:06:01] services or so. He said even to this day
[1:06:03] when they read the book a veil is on
[1:06:06] their heart
[1:06:08] to what? To not see what Christ.
[1:06:11] So it's not that the book wasn't opened.
[1:06:15] It's just their understanding had not
[1:06:16] been open. The book had become a
[1:06:19] manifested reality. It had been opened
[1:06:21] but they did not they did not the veil
[1:06:24] was still on their eyes.
[1:06:27] And so I I'll close with Luke 24.
[1:06:32] verses 30 and 32.
[1:06:37] It said, "It came to pass as he sat at
[1:06:39] meat with them, he took bread and
[1:06:40] blessed it and break and gave to them
[1:06:44] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[1:06:47] him.
[1:06:49] Now they knew him in the revelation of
[1:06:51] the word." There there's this o a
[1:06:53] teaching this identification. the
[1:06:55] written word. The written word
[1:06:57] rehearsed, the written word fulfilled,
[1:06:59] living, made manifest before them. Now,
[1:07:02] they're being walked through the process
[1:07:04] of it. They're being told. These things
[1:07:05] are being lined up, being taught to
[1:07:06] them. Everything's being placed. But
[1:07:08] then God does the thing that we must
[1:07:11] have. This is what we must all have. He
[1:07:13] opened their eyes. And then once their
[1:07:15] eyes were open, they knew him. I I I
[1:07:19] I'll say this if I'm venturing a little
[1:07:21] bit, please forgive me, but I believe
[1:07:23] that had they not constrained him to
[1:07:26] stay that maybe he would have continued
[1:07:29] on and they could have gone back and
[1:07:32] said, "Well, we met this one who placed
[1:07:35] our Messiah in the scripture here." And
[1:07:38] he spoke of Genesis 3:15 and oh, look at
[1:07:41] this how it fits this. and they might
[1:07:43] have been able just to kind of line it
[1:07:44] up all just they could have just
[1:07:45] rehearsed the conversation. But notice
[1:07:48] they could know what he said and place
[1:07:51] it scripturally but still not know him
[1:07:54] to have not had a revelation of him. So,
[1:07:56] I'm so glad that there was still yet
[1:07:58] another place that a person could come
[1:08:00] to not just have everything lined up
[1:08:02] just nicely, not just to have church
[1:08:04] services, not just to kind of walk with
[1:08:06] him in the way, but have this desire to
[1:08:09] constrain him to stay and to come in and
[1:08:12] to to sit at the table and do something
[1:08:15] for me to feed me.
[1:08:17] Amen.
[1:08:19] It says, "And when their eyes were open,
[1:08:20] they knew him and he vanished out of
[1:08:22] their sight. But though out of sight, he
[1:08:23] was now within their heart by revelation
[1:08:25] which could never be departed from them.
[1:08:30] And then they said to one another, "Did
[1:08:31] not our heart burn within us?" I love
[1:08:34] the singularity
[1:08:36] Did not our heart.
[1:08:39] Why? Because I have the heart you have
[1:08:40] for this word. You have the same heart
[1:08:43] that she has. You have the same heart
[1:08:44] everywhere. We all have a heart that
[1:08:46] burns. We have glory. The only heartburn
[1:08:49] I love.
[1:08:51] We have we have a burning heart
[1:08:55] and the world can't quite understand it.
[1:08:58] A and we have people we love and other
[1:09:01] things that take place where uh others
[1:09:03] just they can't quite understand and
[1:09:04] grasp our love for Christ. They can't
[1:09:07] quite understand why because they don't
[1:09:09] have heartburn.
[1:09:12] You don't you don't know you're not
[1:09:13] experiencing what I'm experiencing.
[1:09:15] You're not feeling what I'm feeling. And
[1:09:18] I could say, "Oh, even as Paul said, oh,
[1:09:20] I would that you would be persuaded. I
[1:09:22] would that your heart would burn. I
[1:09:24] would that you would feel what I feel."
[1:09:26] Because he said, "Did not our heart burn
[1:09:27] within us when he talked with us by the
[1:09:30] way?" And while he opened to us the
[1:09:33] scripture,
[1:09:37] he was opening up the scripture.
[1:09:39] Christ once again was opening up the Old
[1:09:42] Testament and unfolding the scroll and
[1:09:46] loosing light was shining on the word in
[1:09:49] a manifested reality. But then it says
[1:09:52] when they went back and testified in
[1:09:53] verse 35 that wherein he was made known,
[1:09:58] they told the things that were done in
[1:09:59] the way and how he was known of them in
[1:10:03] the breaking of bread.
[1:10:06] Again recognize the symbolic act. They
[1:10:09] said why he opened us to the opened up
[1:10:12] to us the scripture and then he's made
[1:10:15] known to us in the breaking of bread
[1:10:19] in the revealing of the word
[1:10:22] and the dividing it out and the giving
[1:10:25] and it's there therein he's made known
[1:10:29] in everything he's done. They still
[1:10:32] don't recog he'd walked with him before.
[1:10:34] They they should have been able to
[1:10:35] recognize his walk. recognize his voice,
[1:10:37] recognize his face, kind of look at the
[1:10:38] hands a little bit or what, whatever it
[1:10:40] might be. Say they had not recognized
[1:10:42] him, but he did something very
[1:10:44] remarkable when he broke bread.
[1:10:49] This is maybe a call back to barriers
[1:10:51] and boundaries. How many of you when
[1:10:53] someone invites you to stay with them
[1:10:56] and you're a guest, whenever the meal is
[1:10:58] served on the table, you go, "Let's just
[1:11:00] all join hands and let's bow our heads
[1:11:02] in prayer and let's pray." And you begin
[1:11:04] to serve.
[1:11:06] Who's got the nerve to do that?
[1:11:08] I might know some people who do,
[1:11:11] but who typically does it? The head of
[1:11:14] the house.
[1:11:16] And so here he is. He's revealed himself
[1:11:19] as the master. He's revealed himself in
[1:11:22] the breaking of bread, taken his
[1:11:24] position, and he's made known, and I
[1:11:26] want you to catch it in a type. He's
[1:11:28] made known to them in the revealing of
[1:11:30] the word. And that's where all of us
[1:11:33] must know him.
[1:11:35] We must know him not just simply in the
[1:11:38] placement of scripture, not just in
[1:11:41] believing the Bible to be the written
[1:11:43] word. We must know him by revelation and
[1:11:46] not just know him because a story has
[1:11:48] been rehearsed to us of a man named
[1:11:50] Jesus uh Jesus of Nazareth who walked
[1:11:52] the shores of Galilee who did this and
[1:11:54] did this and did this and did this. We
[1:11:56] must know him in the resurrection. We
[1:11:59] must know him by revelation. He must
[1:12:01] become to us the opened word.
[1:12:07] We invite the musicians to come
[1:12:11] and the message an absolute.
[1:12:14] He says I'm I'm closing with this. So if
[1:12:18] you're if you're running out of room in
[1:12:19] your notes or whatever it is, I'm this
[1:12:21] is my last statement here. He says like
[1:12:24] it just like it was back there at his
[1:12:26] birth. Isaiah 9:6, all down through the
[1:12:28] scriptures, everything was spoke of him.
[1:12:31] It was fulfilled.
[1:12:34] Over in the book of Luke, we see it that
[1:12:36] he was the end of the prophecy too of
[1:12:38] him. He fulfilled that the history, the
[1:12:40] songs, everything in the Old Testament
[1:12:42] that spoke of him. It was fulfilled
[1:12:44] right there.
[1:12:48] That became the ultimate.
[1:12:52] that became the typost of the word of
[1:12:54] God for that age.
[1:12:57] You you recognize just how he's zeroing
[1:12:59] this down
[1:13:01] that to those in that age this
[1:13:03] fulfillment becomes their tiepost.
[1:13:06] This becomes an anchor and now for
[1:13:09] whatever goes forward that becomes the
[1:13:11] foundation the typost it's an ultimate
[1:13:14] now even going forward and then notice
[1:13:16] the beautiful language that he uses and
[1:13:17] the real bornagain people of this age
[1:13:20] that's filled with the Holy Ghost is the
[1:13:23] tidepost of this scripture that's got to
[1:13:26] be fulfilled in these last days
[1:13:30] if I if I can say it this way to the
[1:13:33] real born again of this age those that
[1:13:35] have the holy Holy Ghost. Their tidepost
[1:13:39] is the scripture that's got to be
[1:13:40] fulfilled in these last days.
[1:13:44] They are the ultimate. It's God's
[1:13:47] ultimate because it's his word and the
[1:13:49] word is Christ the typost. He says
[1:13:52] there's no way to get away from it.
[1:13:54] Something that holds you.
[1:13:57] God is once again fulfilling his
[1:13:59] promised word.
[1:14:02] That that is the absolute
[1:14:04] truth. God is fulfilling his word. And
[1:14:08] the believer's typost today is God
[1:14:12] fulfilling his promised word. You say,
[1:14:15] "Oh, well, brother Aaron, what does that
[1:14:17] mean? What does that mean for me? What
[1:14:18] does that mean uh for us in terms of of
[1:14:21] our of our faith?" And uh uh uh uh what
[1:14:25] which scripture my typost? I I'll say
[1:14:28] this. You're not going to have very much
[1:14:30] if you don't have the new birth.
[1:14:33] If you don't have the revelation of
[1:14:34] Jesus Christ personally to you, that's
[1:14:37] that's the must. You must be born again.
[1:14:40] And when he fulfills his promised word
[1:14:41] to you, a real born again person of this
[1:14:44] age filled with the Holy Ghost can then
[1:14:46] begin to have the rest of the word.
[1:14:48] You're born again to see the word
[1:14:49] fulfilled to you. That's got to be your
[1:14:52] first anchor in Jesus Christ.
[1:14:56] And I challenge all of us to be very
[1:14:58] fervent for that in our own lives. Don't
[1:15:00] miss it, young people. If there's
[1:15:02] sermons that are preached that are
[1:15:03] articulate and wellplaced and a and make
[1:15:07] things seem to be very very plain
[1:15:10] and very clear, I I I I said don't ever
[1:15:14] miss that there's a there's a must. You
[1:15:17] must be born again
[1:15:21] because your heart can burn,
[1:15:25] but he needs to be made known to you in
[1:15:27] Revelation.
[1:15:29] God bless you today. stand.
[1:15:47] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:50] Let's bow our heads in prayer.
