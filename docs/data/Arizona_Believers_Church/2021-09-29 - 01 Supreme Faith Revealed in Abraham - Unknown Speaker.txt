TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i'm going to be reading in romans chapter four i'm gonna start with verse one i originally wanted to start with verse 12 and then just realized um and kind of getting very focused on just a few verses there kind of might be cutting off some things and so i wanted to start a subject on abraham examining abraham's life i'd been reading in it and it just struck me just some simple things and in a way of just demystifying his faith um there's just may even touch on it just a little bit and then i mentioned to the children that this is where i was going to be going i kind of test they're my test case first i mention it to them and uh if they can at least some get gained some interest no i don't test them but i just mentioned having to mention it to them this past week and they said it was really exciting because that's what they were doing in sunday school so the the continuity i think will be nice as a church if there's some parallels romans chapter 4 verse 1 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision but he received the sign of circumcision a seal of righteousness of the faith which he had yet been uncircumcised then he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he hath which he had been yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise might to the end the promise might be sure to all seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i've made the father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be amen you can take your seats this evening i have my title before you it's supreme faith revealed in abraham supreme faith revealed in abraham and it's looking at it from the standpoint that by looking into abraham's life and in examining his life and looking at his his stories we can grab it from the scriptures that there's something that the believer can begin to identify in his life that's going to disclose or unfold or reveal to us what supreme faith looks like and as we've been ministering on blind trust bad faith i think some of these uh things kind of dovetail and fake work into one another but i just felt very moved even though some things i had in my heart in speaking on blind trust that we i just didn't feel that unction to deal with i just feel god's moving me um to look at this subject but there is some kind of tie-in and connection to some of these themes i feel like we're just taking a step further that we wouldn't just look at blind trust and bad faith but really just look at supreme faith and begin to recognize what that looks like and i want to use this statement that we have used over the few a few services here recently from baum and gilead where brother graham says the one thing that we have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we have had he says you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you are doing so that that as we mentioned before that put some of us make us a little uneasy uh maybe some of us who are very presumptuous and very bold and think we know everything that's like oh good i've got this licked i've got supreme faith but remember brother brahm said if you do have supreme faith then what are you doing up here for and there's a way that we kind of measure where we're at in terms of our faith growing but he says you cannot have that faith which is supreme faith until you know perfectly what you're doing so notice how he talks about we're trying to move up now so he's not saying you haven't been anywhere you don't have anything but he's recognizing this uh this gradual progression and trajectory of real faith that grows and increases and it doesn't stagnate or fall away so he says we have to know perfectly what we're doing to be in that realm of supreme faith and then we could take that and just immediately say oh well i want supreme faith and by supreme faith i'll be able to create my lattes in the morning uh or my filet mignon in the evening and it kind of just puts it in this realm that man those who have supreme faith can just always shoot a squirrel at 300 yards in the eye with the 22 and that's what we think that's what we think supreme faith is but then he just approaches it in such a simple way you just say well i'm going home i'm going out and start the car that's all an act of faith and it starts looking at just daily routine everyday life things that we do every day tomorrow i meet you at a certain place that's all act of faith because you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you now he's saying that we ought to move up into supreme faith and instead of him kind of berating us saying well you're not spiritual enough you're not fashion enough you don't understand the seals enough and kind of going down this angle where we've got to figure out all the types and we have to know all the revelations we have to be so deep in the word that uh that these everything makes sense to us he starts talking about an approach in just a daily life and he says you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you well that's the way the things of god are that's how we're going to get into supreme faith he says after you've trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just like a regular routine not where it becomes common to you and it doesn't phase you and it doesn't matter it's kind of like i i have a kind of a saying that when god does something we shouldn't be surprised so i say i'm not surprised but i'm still amazed and and it's because it's always it still is amazing even if it's not surprising so after you've trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just like a regular routine it's habit it's in it's something that's taking place and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord and then this statement so the rapture will just go right on that way all an act of faith it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god so instead of getting our eyes on some sort of supreme faith that is uh you know pie in the sky and extravagant and beyond uh just the daily life of the daily routine we're kind of looking for this this climactic moment where everything the whole world is turned upside down and everyone goes oh the branhamites were right we're all doomed it's just a regular everyday life liv hidden in christ serving him walking in the the pattern of the scripture to the cadence of the holy spirit it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god so i still want that statement to be before you as we look at the supreme supreme faith as he said this is what we have to be built up to now supreme faith revealed in abraham now this supreme faith we could use it we could use different uh terminologies to describe it it's rapturing faith and when we know where that rapturing faith is contained and where it comes from we also recognize that brother ram talked about a perfect faith and there is a sense where we can identify perfect faith being the faith that is necessary for the moment that you're living in to meet the challenge that you're living in but we realize in the time that we're living in there could be this moments and instances where faith is operating perfectly but there is a promise in this hour of triumph over all sin and even over death and so the faith that meets that mark and the faith to meet that challenge is going to be a perfect faith and if we use terminology supreme faith rapturing faith perfect faith it can be made to seem so mysterious that we sometimes wonder if we even have it and it can be made to seem so unreachable that we almost feel like we haven't even started and we're in and certainly the word can be preached in such a way to where we're just always questioning whether or not we've ever had the holy ghost and then not only are we not questioning we either have the holy ghost now we found out that some people say that you could that you're born again and have eternal life without the holy ghost you start wondering which ball am i juggling and where am i at in the scheme of things and life can get really really confusing very very fast uh with the way the uh sincere people can pervert things and the devil not being sincere wants to be sure that it's perverted and we just always seem unsettled and so there's a there's a i believe even being sincere and i can say i'll just say it for myself even being sincere you can preach mysteries and revelations and doctrines and teachings that are very true and there's no in them they're pure and they're true but you could preach them in such a way to where in the the attitude of it and the purity of it the force of it and the supreme power of it that you can create the wrong picture for people where they start thinking oh well i don't have a chance in the world and i wasn't raised in it and i i was in the world for a while and i doubt it or i backslid or different things can be said to where it just seems like this is a faith that's only for those uh who got got the holy ghost when they were 12 never spent a day in the world and and second or third fourth generation message believers everything just lined up perfectly everything in order but what i'm trying to say is this supreme faith isn't always what we think it is it doesn't always manifest itself the way that we think it's going to manifest itself and maybe it's not achieved in the way that we think it's going to be achieved because it's going to come about as an act of faith as we go through the regular routine of following the scriptures in the plans of god not because we can tell you all the horse riders and all the seals and the church ages and which ones overlap and which ones line up and which one when one started and the other one started and it's not getting a quiz right when we're asked questions about what was the name of brother branham's horse and what year did he do this and when did he do that uh those things aren't what builds the supreme faith so if we look at the example of abraham this is what the way it struck me it was just so startling that it was uh just a very overwhelming inspiration that gripped me last week to where i thought oh it just seems such a clear clear channel and this is why i very excited to minister in this we call abraham the great patriarch and the he is the bible mentions a few times we read today already our father abraham and he's also called the father of faith and so if you look at just looking at abraham the abra religions that are derived from abraham the abrahamic religions if you look at there's three major religions in the world that stem from or believe it as abraham being their father and there's over 4 billion followers in the world of these of these religions that's christianity judaism and islam and so you have three these three large religions and what's really remarkable when you think about is pondering that this afternoon how that when it comes to israel there's less than 20 million jews in the world so really you could just take them them out of the number and it's still something like 56 percent of the world fall it believes abraham to be their father christianity and islam themselves together but yet look at how the jews seem to dominate the conversation just at the heart of it israel and all the controversy less than 20 million people and so when you think about that in terms of over 4 billion followers of these abrahamic religions and believe abraham is their father christians muslims jews all look to this one man as being the father of their religion and where their faith tracks back to it's over half 56 nearly 60 percent of the entire world is saying hey we believe that abraham's the father of our religion the father of our faith and so he looms so large as a legend of faith right himself having a legendary faith and when we look at within our bible about abraham we look in the old testament or even understand the rich tradition of the jews and judaism and then even understanding islam and their their faith and their belief in in abraham that he has such an unshakable faith think of the influence that that abraham has had to to have over four or over four billion followers and that would actually put him in a more unique category than jesus right in the sense that uh so many uh so many of the billions of the islam and so many of the the millions of the jews don't even regard jesus as being the messiah uh though some would in the jewish faith believe that he could be a prophet and islam believing him to be a prophet um this is something that abraham then has like such a a powerful figure in religion and in the world today and he has the faith that seemed to have been he's the father of faith he's the patriarch he's the founder he's the originator and so we think his faith is unshakable his faith is uncompromised and if we're not careful it seems unreachable he's like it's abraham right i i i can believe that i'm a son of abraham but i can never be a like abraham and i think there's a little i don't i don't want to use the word mythology as it relates to abraham but his legend can become myth when we start looking at the wrong way and we start attributing certain things and and building certain stories in our minds to where his faith seems as if it is so far out of reach that we just some we have some sort of connection to him but yet really we're not walking in the same faith and so my goal is to to make the faith of abraham's practical and make it so practical that it can work in us to the supernatural that we come back even as we've been identifying in blind trust and bad faith the whole point was to get us to stop mixing things in with our faith that faith ought to be pure into the word we don't want to mix anything with our faith we don't want to take that faith and put it in anything else any any kind of diet or medical approach or anything that faith that is to the word is to the word alone so we take that trust and that conviction and we keep it firmly planted in the word and then we don't add anything to the word that our faith is being projected to because that'll bring disappointment and so we were trying just to take a step back and realize reckon ourselves to be true christians genuine believers in the word of god who trust in god who have a reason for our faith and that there's a process of god making a promise fulfilling the promise that builds our faith and that's us fallen in the regular routine of scripture and the plans of god so we want the faith of abraham to be so practical in our lives that it works into the supernatural and that we begin to see the supreme faith it works into supreme faith to supreme faith and it's exercised in our lives and we can see the hand of god in our in our walk in this world in hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 just referencing this very quickly it says looking under jesus and i'm only using this scripture for this phrase the author and finisher of our faith he's the author he's the he's the one that leads the chief the one that in being the first affords the example but it means the leader or originator he is the author he is the beginner he's the originator of our faith and then this is comforting because even in the language that's being used he begins your faith but faith begins as a seed and it grows and it increases and it matures and it gets better and better he's the author and finisher or perfecter there's many translations that could even render it as as you look at the greek and commentators that would say that is the perfecter of our faith so identify this in this scripture faith has an origin but it also has a destiny amen it has a beginning and it has a completion it has a fullness and there's degrees of faith and there's levels of faith and there's faith that can grow and i think that all of us can fellowship together in this that no matter how long we've been serving god how long we've believed the message or or what we've been through what we've experienced if we have genuine faith it's a faith that grows and that we all can say we're in this growing process together unless i just happen to be missing somebody who's sitting here in a glorified body and if so i apologize you might want to check it because it's not as glorious as maybe you think it is but if we're not in that state if we're still breathing i still have breath and we realize there's got to be more practical outworking of this faith that gets stronger and gets more robust and then i'm taking a step back and realizing that supreme faith doesn't mean i'm going to be able to go over to some everybody who's sick and anybody who's doubting and everyone's just like did you notice the halo on his head isn't this amazing this guy's really really a real christian it's not going to work out that way and and i could say this as i study his life abraham's example is really refreshing in that way that you don't just find that abraham was born perfectly and abraham never sinned and abraham did this and abraham did that and the faith of abraham is a man walking on water and raising the dead and and doing all sorts of mighty works and everything it's like man abraham did that jesus did that i don't have a chance but we look at abraham's life and realize that there's something that was working in his life and it's the same thing that's working in you so our faith has a beginning and that we'll have a completion it will have a finishing and as i've mentioned before sometimes when i look at a subject i just have to get started and what i'm doing tonight is maybe me reading a lot of different scriptures that that um i i see as being a part of this overall thought and we will probably revisit a lot of this again hopefully in a way that takes you a step further not just repetition but in james chapter 2 verses 14 to 24 we look at a little bit different perspective as paul is saying that abraham was not justified by works and he kind of challenged this notion if he was justified by works then where where's the glory it's not from god and we are taught and we understand in this beautiful parallel of how paul teaches that abraham was justified by works that he was justified with god or before or was not justified by works he was justified before god by faith and that when james when james is looking at it he's not stepping in this position of posit of placing before god in your position in christ but rather your life in the practical outworking of that inward justification and what everybody else sees so when you say you're justified by faith but you're still a rank reprobate heathen denying god denying the lord and he's saying man you could tell me you have faith all day long without your works though what good is your faith on you and he's gonna and he's taken it from the standpoint that then faith then once justified before god and with that standing before god there's works that follow and brother branham deals with that quite often in such a way to really bring great clarity so we're looking at romans 4 in our text we'll come back to it in a moment but let's begin with james chapter 2 verse 14 here what does it profit my brethren though a man say he have faith and have not works can faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute a daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be you warmed and filled i think that describes religion today he says notwithstanding you give them not these things which are needful to the body what doth that profit so somebody who has faith that doesn't do anything for them is no better than telling someone who's hungry oh be be filled or somebody who's cold will yourself warm right it says then in verse 17 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone and that's a very a striking statement to say that faith without works is dead being alone so if you just have faith but there's no there's no impact or work related to it it's almost like saying check its polls if it's not doing something for you check its polls he says yeah a man's men may say thou hast faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works and i'll show thee my faith by my works thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble in that sense maybe the devils are doing better it says but will found no old vain man that with faith without works is dead just emphasizing that coming back to what he said in verse 17 emphasizing this again that faith without works is dead now this is the part i want to really focus on in verses 21 and 22 was not abraham our father justified by works and that he's been very precise and very specific within the timeline of abraham's faith when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar so we could say that we have faith right now right you're believing you have faith and we believe that we're going in a rapture now wouldn't you say that once you went in the rapture that that vindicated the faith you had that you were going in the rapture all along was kind of in the sense that james is saying it that there was an instance and a point in his life that it came to this part where he says when he offered up isaac his son upon the altar this justified vindicated proof that abraham had the goods that he claimed to have had all along and he phrases it this way see us thou how faith wrought with his works that faith is now is is bringing forth these works and by works was faith made perfect and i want to come back to that phrase in a moment by works was faith made perfect and thou and this the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only so very very interesting uh contrast between romans 4 and james chapter 2. both writers referring to the same scriptures but there's a point in this in this viewing of abraham's life that james is looking at and another point that paul is looking and says was not abraham justified without the works of circumcision because what is was he not called and recognized by god before he was even circumcised in circumcision was given as a confirmation of the covenant that he already believed in so he's saying that that work and even this act of circumcision it's not because you've circumcised yourself and it's by your works that you find the grace of god and paul is looking in his life at a particular instance now james is looking later on and he's saying that we could say that he had genuine faith that yes was confirmed by this covenant in the in the flesh but now it comes to this place where he offers up isaac upon the altar and he says this is is this not when he was justified by works and he was justified not just by saying he had faith but by something made manifest in his life that spoke of his faith and he says by works was faith made perfect that means reached i it reached fully consummated development faith made perfect it was fully consummated fully developed it reached its uh highest point it actually means that it attained supreme expression that when abraham offered up isaac upon the altar his faith was made perfect or his faith by works was faith made reached its full and supreme expression this was the supreme faith of abraham and yes it was a remarkable thing that god had asked abraham to do to take his son his only son isaac and there's very striking language in the use of that phrase to take him this one through whom the all the world is going to be blessed and take him and to sacrifice him and so abraham is doing what god asked him to do and this is ultimately an act of faith upon which which manifest his faith in the most supreme way this is supreme faith for abraham but yet we could look at it in one sense that he had for abraham had just become a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god to when it came time for god to ask him to do what would have been the the most dramatic difficult hard thing to do by then abraham was in the routine of hearing that voice and doing what it said and if we believe that one day even if we had some kind of conception in our minds that we're going to have to have shovels and go dig out our relatives from the graves or we believe that we're going to have to walk to graves and be the voice of the resurrection speaking people back to life or there's going to be a prayer line and we're going to be restoring limbs and we're going to be doing things like that if that's going to be what happens in the end you better be in the regular routine of the scriptures fulfilling the plans of god if you're ever going to walk into a meeting like that and the gift be used we can't just think that we're just going to be laying around doing nothing and not doing any anything to really grow our faith and then one day just wake up and be like oh i think i feel that honey i got rapture and faith i'm gonna go i'm gonna go to the graveyard today or i'm gonna start looking for my dead aunt or whatever it might be it's it's gonna be just living everyday life again i'm not wanting to get in your mind that every day we're practicing creating squirrels but just living every day abraham was living every day and was in that routine of scripture that when it came to something that was very dramatic very profound and very heavy he trusted god he'd done it so much it become a regular routine with him and so as abraham lived it says his by works was faith made perfect as he lived his faith received its realization as he lived it was entirely exemplified and manifested and filled up as abraham lived his faith was filled up as he lived his faith was exemplified as he lived it received its realization it it saw the promises made made to him come to pass in philippians chapter 2 verse 12 is we're wanting to take that phrase his by works was faith reached its full and supreme expression in philippians chapter 2 verse 12 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling we could use this to suggest that someone who's just not certain about their experience with god they got to work it out and i i'm not saying that that application is not true there's this uh there's a thought and a meaning behind it to where we always want to be challenged that we've worked out our salvation and we know who we are and we know that we're saved and filled with the holy ghost and those things but when he says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling it means to carry it out to full perfection i mean just think about it tonight if we believe in our hearts that you have salvation you're holding salvation in your heart you've got it in your heart and you've got in your heart we all have salvation in our hearts he's saying work it out work it out i mean get it out let it live let it do something for you if we if we all have some salvation tonight it's like okay think about it you never have to worry about hellfire you never have to worry about damnation you never have to worry about rejection you never have to worry about white throne judgment you never have to worry about an endless fall you never have to worry about god saying depart from me your workers of iniquity you have salvation you have eternal life you say work it out live it a little bit enjoy it like work out your own salvation she says with fear and trembling so there's a humility that go with goes with it but if we've been justified once for all then faith is worked out until it's perfected work out your own salvation until perfection seems that we've had this this grace given to us and we've received this justification knowing that i'm justified once for all in the sight of god by faith then that salvation which is by grace which is through faith is worked out just as it was in abraham's life by works was faith made perfect paul teaching the philippians work out your own salvation in hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 to 10 it says and i'm just checking it because i had several more scriptures here originally noted but i think i just have it to verse 10 hebrews chapter 8 verse 10 excuse me hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 to 10 by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went now i'm going to continue to read but let me just pause for a moment i'll maybe pick back up in verse 8. now as we've already began to just begin to pour out my heart and express these things as i'm viewing the life of abraham we're wanting to take a realistic look and just identify supreme faith revealed in abraham and this legend and this this father figure within the gospel and within other religions and just how much of a peculiar person he may be and mysterious he may be in this great faith that he had and father the father of the faith and the faith of abraham and all the things that we're taught that he experienced and things that he went through in the scripture just even being able to look at them and place them chronologically would is important and to know which juncture certain things happened and and what god was doing in his life i want you to notice this about abraham as it's kind of getting into genesis chapter 11 and chapter 12 this is how it's written of in this by faith abraham which is going to look at him as a father of faith and one of these great heroes of faith by faith this one and by faith that one by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed now notice he's called and what does he do he obeys and it says and he went out not knowing whether he went now think about then think about abraham now and the faith of abraham and where we kind of place him in terms of oh abraham this legendary father figure the father of faith he walked because he had it all figured out and he was able to do this and when god spoke his name and in genesis chapter 12 when it said god called abram immediately he said i'm not just abraham i'm abraham and he changed his body young again and he had a son in in nine months it says that he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god do you realize the city he looked for is the city we're going to the city he looked for is the city that you reveal in your placing as the bride of jesus christ in the end time the new jerusalem the habitation of god for he looked for a city which have foundations whose builder and maker is god the bible is saying in these verses by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed he went out not northern where he went he had not fully even received his promise when he left he said get up and go to a land i'm going to show you hadn't even fully received the promise it wasn't even explicitly given till later so think about this when god called him and even when he obeyed he knew not what land he was going into he just knew god spoke to him now truly we could say that of ourselves that that there has been as i look out on the people here tonight that god has spoken to you and in speaking to you you didn't know everything then that you know now and and probably for all of us we say it's a good thing though we sometimes say man if i could just start all over if i could just do this all over again you know i i would mess it up again so i just want to stay where i'm at and just trust god that we're going to keep going further in his graves and so there's abraham when he's called and he begins he he god calls him and he has this faith and conviction that this is god i mean if he went to his his uncle and he goes to his dad and he goes to different ones and he says hey you know man i had this dream or had this vision and it told me to do this now oh hell no and there could have been some debate he said i just know this is god leading me and this is the this is what is happening with abraham is before when god calls him he obeyed i want you to catch it even before he knew exactly where he was going as it says in genesis chapter 12 verse 1 now the lord said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee he doesn't say get away from the father and you're going to go to this place and there's going to be the address and these are the directions you're going to take and he'd go oh you're taking me there let me get on google earth let me get a picture of it yep i know it's there let me search this out let me figure this out let me get some sources let me get look at some reviews run it to the fake review website make sure these aren't just all fake reviews and say hey this looks legitimate it's got an a plus score and everybody likes it i've looked at the pictures everything looks good we talked to people who've been there before let's go none of that he couldn't even google it because it wasn't google he couldn't he he couldn't even ask around hey do you guys know if there's well watered planes and where am i going again oh you didn't tell me he couldn't even ask and this is what some of the jewish commentators say this is the phrase god did not immediately make known the land to him so that it might be lovely in his eyes and god has a reason in it doesn't quite show it to him yet that it might that that he's hiding this he's not showing it and so he's not being drawn by the wrong thing hey get out of this uh pest house and get away from this and get away from all these situations and these clammy neighbors and all these different people because i want to show you something look at how beautiful this land is and it's like then it's not faith anymore it's like yeah i hope that's right i hope he's telling me the right bill of goods i mean i i really want to be there as another in the jewish tradition it says abraham came from mesopotamia and its companions and he knew not where he was as a man that is in the dark he was leaving and following and in abraham we see something to where it is the characteristic of faith to follow god when we can't cannot see the way this is a characteristic of faith to follow god even when we haven't seen it has not appeared to us exactly where we are going it says we walk by faith not by sight we are not walking to the appearance of that new body as it is struck the eye one day we will realize the realization everything around us will be eternal but by right now it's by faith that we are walking into a promise of god even if it's not an appearance that we have seen with our natural eyes and so this is this i wanted to share that to express this to you how that even in abraham he was asked to go in the beginning of his faith he went he began upon the unction of god and gone speaking to him and he says i want you to begin in this process and leave and then i'll show you where you're going later and so he just left trusting god and in that there's no doubt in that that speaks to how he is the father of our faith in verse 12 of romans chapter 4 as we read in the beginning as part of our text it says in the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only speaking of abraham he is the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised he had steps of faith before he was even circumcised and it says that we also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham that having not even been circumcised and receiving that covenant of circumcision when he god called him to go out and without even telling him where he was going abraham just believed god took him at his word and began to walk and he says that there are a people who call for abraham their father and who are of the faith who walk in the steps of this in this face that faith so that faith has steps it has progress when we look at those those steps of faith they're not just going in circles and round and round and round and round and go in circles there's steps to that faith and it has a trajectory and it has a height and it has a depth and it has a a has a progress to it what those who walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham it's two things i i think we could just grab a hold of and and and really anchor within our hearts and i love that paul wright wrote it this way and he's writing it to uh many degrees in these dozen or so scriptures we read at the outset in romans chapter four but the one thing i really want you to catch is we have the same faith he had oh he's saying we have the same faith who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham when the bible talks about the faith of abraham and he's called our father and referred to him as a patriarch and we begin to look at this legendary faith that abraham had we should not in any way begin to think that the faith that abraham had is different than the faith that we have in that his was superior and it was greater and we can never have it paul is saying you have the same faith that he had that's the first thing we could just recognize and accept that we have that faith of our father abraham and the second thing is we follow in the exercise of that faith that abraham it's not somebody we read about says abraham believed god and he bragged about it and he lived all his days in the land of the chaldeans can't it's not said of abraham that's not said his name does not remain to be abram but his name is changed and he has a testimony of faith and he's walking and he's progressing and so he's saying that we who walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham we are then also part of that faith and part of that testimony and part of that life because abraham is called the parent believer he's the patriarch he's the father of our faith he's the parent believer he's the model of justification by faith he's the example he's the model after his type is the first example of it we are molded after it so if he's the father of our faith it's not he's the the role model of our faith or like the idol of our faith like we all daydream we all wish that we were uh patrick mahomes and we all wish that we were a joey gallow we all wish that we're somebody else and we just kind of oh they're my idol they're my idol and you ain't ever going to be that right yeah you don't you don't have the hair for it at the very least you're never going to be these guys and so it's not like this idol where it's just daydreaming and oh i just wish i could be abraham's not an idol of our faith he's a model of how the faith that you have is exercised and what it will do in a person when you yield and give into it and you trust god and you take him at his word he's the model of justification by faith and he is our type as the one who gave the first example of it of how that we also are molded in this faith that is in us grows to supreme expression in isaiah chapter 51 verses 1 to 2. we had read this recently in our family devotion and it was part of just this confirmation and struck my heart very profoundly this confirmation of to look at abraham as an example it says hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the lord it says look under the rock once you were hewn look at the quarry and the pit you were dug out in the hole of the pit when you were digged the rock you've been hewn out of look at what you've come from look at the if you even want to say the pedigree or the source material look what you've been taken from because it says look under abraham your father because it says look under the rock and and what you've been pulled out of abraham was the rock look where you've come from look at your stock look at your pedigree look at your legacy look what you've come from look what you're following in look under the rock once you are hewn look under abraham your father and unto sarah that bear you for i called him alone and blessed him and increased now we could look at in the context of isaiah and his alternating prophecies of blessing and then curse and how he's dealing with him in this in this this prophecy at this time to see that what you come from and though you may be small and though you may be cast down and though you may be rejected and you may be torn and you may and you may feel that you are nothing look unto abraham who god called alone and blessed him and increased him when he was just one man and look at you now maybe you're more than one and you're many even though you've been into uh you've been in bondage and you've been brought into uh slavery and you've suffered the loss of many things if god could call one man and bless him and increase him look at you as a nation i can also bless you but what god is telling him to do is use abraham as your example look to abraham the rock that you've come from as your example who we walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham we can look to him as being the father of our faith the parent believer the one that we can become even a dear follower of beholding his example look under abraham your father unto sarah that bear you and we can see that he is an example but the faith that i have is the same faith that abraham had the message possessing the gate of the enemy after trial but the man says and the patriarch was faithful to his call and the promised word he was an example to what we should be notice this he was an example to what we should be he was an example of what we ought to be as a patriarch he was faithful to his call into the promised word and he's an example that we ought to be faithful to our call into our promised word we have to be faithful to that that if we're to look at his example and say oh well i want to leave my family and i want to go live in canaan and i want to i want to i'm going to have a a child from my serve my wife's uh servant and just to try to do everything abraham did no it's not trying to mimic abraham or impersonate abraham or or become change your name to abraham and i've changed my name my name is abraham aguirre and and and try to just become abe right but the the example is be faithful to your call and the promised word for your day he's an example to what we should be continuing in romans chapter 4 verses 13 to 18 for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to a seed through the law it was a promise to abraham and to a seed but not through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void in the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham to those you the jews are those that are of the law you could even say that there are some there were some gentiles who had made themselves subject as being prophetized to the jewish faith who observed the law but now he's saying but to that also which is of the faith of abraham not in the honoring of the law or the circumcision but who are of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i've made thee a father of many nations before him whom you believed even god who quickeneth the dead and notice abraham's this great remark about abraham's faith who calleth those things which be not as though they were why not because he wanted them but because god told them he didn't have a habit of naming it and claiming it he said god didn't promise me a mansion but i'm going to go ahead and claim one i want 7 000 square feet on eight acres name it claim it fake it till you make it all the prosperity nonsense that gets preached today but he had a promise from god and he could call those things that were not as though they were because he's faith went back to what god said who against hope believed in hope against hope believed in hope that he might become notice that who against hope believed in hope we can read about abraham and other places who staggered not in hebrews 11 who by faith abraham and we see this one who could get up and go and not knowing where he went and he was such a bulldog and everything worked out for him and he grabbed his farmers and his you know his yard lawn keepers at the around his property and went and chased after armies and was recognized by kings and we just have this image of abraham but you know what he had things against him who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be he believed in the spoken word he believed in the word that was directed to him given to him and even when it even when it wasn't given to everyone else i i'll express this in maybe a more personal way that as i've been thinking about it i think abraham abraham abraham none of us are the first then because abraham's already done it christ is also referred to as the captain the leader the forerunner of our salvation and so none of us are going on this we this is exactly what's meant in hebrews chapter 11 and as we mentioned it i think yeah i mentioned in hebrews chapter 12 seeing that we have this cloud of witnesses like we have witness we have testimony we uh our our testimonies today are not well i was laying in bed and all of a sudden a voice spoke to me said go to the hilton garden in at seven o'clock tonight i'm gonna speak to you there and that's kind of like the genesis of our faith i didn't even know there was a god i just thought maybe i had too much to eat i thought it was my phone but my phone was dead and i thought what do i have to lose i called an uber here i am worst case scenario i get to go to salad go salad or whatever salad to go and get a cheap coffee on national coffee day and you showed up and we all kind of have the same origin story i was just sitting there i had this premonition abraham did that for us right like abraham said hey some dude spoke to me told me to go somewhere where are you going i don't know he's going to tell me later like listen this is a scam trust me right do they tell you that your tax you have a tax debt and you immediately begin to tell them you know all the red flags about a scam but that's but abraham does it and now he affords us an example that when nobody else was serving the one true god and all his relatives were reprobates and heathens and he was a gentile which just means nations and people he wasn't a jew and before there was ever any circumcision before there was ever any vindication he believes god and begins to walk and everything that god said he would do for abraham he's done and we can look back and say he did for abraham everything that he said he would do and now you in a very supernatural way god speaks your name and when everyone says abraham i didn't hear it abraham i wouldn't follow him do you have any idea what you're doing and we'll look at it maybe more closely and you can see the pattern in his life you can be incursional i'm walking in the steps of my father abraham i'm walking in this according to what was spoken in the unconditional covenant that was made with the people preached in 1954 brother bram says abraham was the example what all he was going to do to abraham he was going to do to him and his seed abraham brought isaac through isaac come christ we being dead in christ take on abraham's seed and are heirs according to the promise so when he says what he was going to do to abraham he was going to do to abraham and his seed it's not just jacob it's not just the children of israel it's not just isaac jacob the children of israel but we also being dead in christ become the royal seed abraham seed heirs according to the promise that was made to abraham therefore abraham is the example what he was going to do to abraham he does to his seed because you have the faith of abraham and having the faith of abraham we must follow in the exercise of that faith in the message jehovah jireh part two and god wants his church to read between the lines he's referring to maybe a love letter that is written and oh honey i'm thinking about you it's the end of the night and here i am away he says that god wants you to his church to read between the lines i love this not read anything out of it now right you want to read between the lines but don't write something in the white space which a lot of people do they feel like reading between the lines is licensed just to come up with whatever you want well i was just reading between the lines now i mean it means picking up what was being laid down it's like i feel you i know what you're saying i get what you're trying to say wink wink yeah i get it he's saying that he god wants us to catch what he's trying to share with us you have to read between the lines to see what it's meaning now watch and see find out if it doesn't now what god done with abraham and sarah he's showing them an example of his church we see them as it says look at this rock that you hear now now look unto abraham your father and unto sarah that bear you what god did with abraham and sarah he's showing them as an example of his church abraham and sarah are going to exemplify something their faith their life their path their instances their circumstances their ups and downs their wrestlings their fightings their wars are going to express something as an example of what the church is what she goes through whether you want to look at it on the level of a church age or even you as an individual who's an individual seed he said he did for them notice he says he turned them both back to being a young man and a woman sure he did put them back young again just like he's going to do every seat of abraham he was an example to what we should be he was an example in that what he god did to abraham he does to his seed abraham and sarah were an example of his church the church of christ saying that even in the very end if you look at this example of how that they were made young again he's saying is that not what's going to happen to all those who are dead in christ and all those who are hid in christ abraham's seed according to the promise in genesis chapter 17. so we were reading about i is he even thinking about tonight he said if you do if you do anything without faith walk through a prayer line walk to an altar no matter what you do if you don't have faith you're just going on a walk i know the bible says that abraham walked with god enoch walked with god but it wasn't just a walk it wasn't just burning calories he wasn't trying to see if he could get his steps for the day but it was working something out in his life the translation as we've been looking at how that we must work out our own salvation it hasn't works was made reached its full and supreme expression there's this faith that he has and then it's made perfect genesis chapter 17 this is we first have abraham mentioned abram mentioned in genesis chapter 11 he's given the genealogy and some of the background and characteristics of sarah and abram and their family and their journey genesis chapter 12 the lord called abram as we read a moment ago he called them he says in the lord had said unto abram get thee out of that country and from thy kindred and from that father's house unto a land that i'll show thee so now we're several chap five chapters later we're looking at there's a lot that's happened it says abraham was 90 years old and nine 99 years old the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect this isn't genesis chapter 12 it's not even genesis 15. this is much later in his life 13 years after ishmael was born 24 years after the lord had called him and given him a promise that his seed would become that in him through him the earth would be blessed and have a seat after him 13 years after the birth of ishmael 24 years after being called by god and it's in this chapter says i am the almighty god walk before thee and be thou perfect this is a walk that expresses something walk before me and be thou made perfect and express this faith and let it become expre a supreme expression he's wanting abram to be an example and i'm getting pulled into just all the things i've been reading and studying and the things in the word of god there's if we look at abraham there was nothing that distinguished him and we're all sitting we're reading resumes right we want to pick the hero the fight we we have to pick the patriarch of the faith we are it's called the faith not the voice we're all the judges we need to pick who's going to be the one that's going to be the father of our faith and we're looking at resumes and listen abram's resume didn't make him stick out yeah next next i i there's nothing about abram that really would have stuck out and it's not like he had this pedigree of supernatural things and he was the big wise one and everybody asked him this and he had a lot big family now he couldn't have kids so he's just an ordinary man and god calls him and speaks to him and he's gonna he's gonna express this this in his life it's going to unfold and unfold and unfold and it's in this chapter genesis chapter 17 he's given the covenant of circumcision five chapters later 24 something years later he's given the covenant of circumcision it's in this chapter that his name is changed from abram to abraham it is in this chapter that sarah's name is changed from sarah to sarah with an h and it's in this chapter that god finally says listen it's not ishmael that's going to live before me i know he's a 13 year old child and you've had this son and you want him to be you but when i said you'd have a son in your own house it's then that he says the promise is through sarah and she's going to have a son and he gives the name it's in this chapter that it happens it's in genesis chapter 17. it's not in genesis chapter 12 that abram went to sleep one night and in that dream god told him his name was abraham his wife was not sarah it was sarah they were going to have a son named isaac it was going to be through sarah and it was going to do this and he was going to do that and when he woke up he had all like these pictures right from the future like a time traveler just left him a photojournalist yep this matches yep this message if everything's just happening exactly like the almanac said it would that's not how it happened with abraham and so genesis chapter 17 is a very pack packed chapter but then in verse 18 it says and the lord appeared unto him chapter 18 rather verse 1 and the lord appeared to him lord just keeps appearing to him why because that's the steps of abraham's faith the lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and in this chapter he reveals himself to abraham before judging sodom and he confirms his promise that sarah will have a son i'll revisit you according to the time of life and next year she's going to have a son just like i said he would she would this son isaac and genesis chapter 18 and then the preceding chapters which expressed the judgments of sodom and the days of lot and then even the conception and the bringing forth of this son this promised son isaac hold such significant things to our faith because you realize this seeds isaac even then is just portraying apart because he wasn't even the seed the seed of abraham will we we know but we'll even examine it lord willing in greater detail is or maybe not greater detail we'll just examine it that the seed was christ when even isaac the seed was christ and these chapters are so significant when you begin to look at i hope you do this on sunday just quickly look at the chapters of the bible that this is such a tremendous portion of scripture such a tremendous passages that are here and we want to be able to look at them in such a way that we can identify with them and relate with them and feel that we are a part of it because it expresses something to us and the lord appeared to him and made himself known to abraham before he judged sodom but not just because there was judgment coming to sodom but because he wanted to reveal himself to abram and bring all these promises he believed in to pass and bring him to this expression and this birth in his life so he could handle it but it's this chapter chapter 18 where he appears in human flesh to abraham brother branham refers to it in the message influence and he says he was showing an example of what he was going to do in the last days so we who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham and we look unto abraham our father he was an example of what we should be and we are who are of the faith of abraham he is the father of us all he's an example of not only what he in what he was an example of what god did to him he does to his seed and he's showing us the example of his bride an example of what he was going to do in the last days it's it's there in the life of abraham what he's doing in the last days and the message god is identified by his characteristics and one day when god seen that a servant was determined to be an example for people of today we begin to identify in genesis chapter 18 leading up to even these portions of scripture where he's going to come and even in this and when he says and one day when god seen that a servant was determined to be an example for people of today he's referring to genesis 22 when he offers up his son isaac he's referring to james chapter 2 wherein his faith reached its fullest supreme expression when if abraham's faith became supreme faith he says he was determined he was set forth to be an example of the people today his life and even an offering up isaac becomes an example of the faith of god's elect in this end time why because supreme faith is the faith of this hour and this is why we can look at abraham and begin to identify with him in a much more personal way abraham is our father he is our example i encourage you to get into the word of god and begin to read in genesis 11 chapter 12 all the way to even through you could read all the way to chapter 50 you could just read of the story of abraham and his family because that's what genesis the genesis story we think genesis oh creation genesis in the beginning well it's abraham that's where you begin to look into this and identify your faith and the father of the faith and musicians if you could come i i'm i'm thinking of this right now as i close we have a phenomena in the world today that people live their lives in a particular family setting and they love their their parents and they love them dearly and they're nurtured by them and they have very full lives but they come to a place in their lives where they find out that they were adopted and to find out that they're adopted it can it can create i haven't experienced this myself maybe not yet i don't know am i prophesying uh there's something about me that sticks out where i doubt that that's the case but anyways um but there's when they come to that spot it may maybe they're okay with it they say well you know what i was adopted i had loving parents i've been nurtured i'm fine with my life but then they begin to have medical issues and it becomes very important at that point to understand their genetic history their dna and they realize you know what if i was just merely adopted by these parents i can't look to him and say well dad did you have colon cancer at 56 uh no but that doesn't mean anything to if you've been adopted mom did you ever have this in your family history no uh-uh but it wouldn't really matter you couldn't really answer the question to a degree of of necessitating some kind of follow-up or or understanding what may be taking place in a person's body because they're adopted they don't share the dna they don't have the history and and it becomes important to go back and look at the at the family history to resolve and answer some question and sometimes it becomes such a huge issue in a person's heart i was adopted and i don't i i feel this longing and this missing part and i always wondered about it and these things are never resolved so they can go back and find out who is my real dad who is my real mom where did i really come from and it means no disrespect at all to those who raised him and nurtured them but it's just something that they really need in their hearts and if i could just say this we could have the wrong concept of adoption preach to us as believers do we kind of just feel like we're all orphans in god's orphanage man we're just so glad he's taking care of us and we all just kind of we just kind of given abraham's name because we've been adopted into the family but listen what you do when you begin to look at abraham you begin to identify your dna you begin to look at your family history and you could recognize the way that i have behaved with my faith and the thing the way that i have had been against hope and suffered these things and had these things happen and why i am the way that i am as a believer i can go back and trace it through this lineage and this history and go back to the dna the rock that i've been hearing out of and i can see it in my father abraham i begin to realize well that's why i am the way that i am and i believe that we have the we should do this and if god would lead me to do it if it's just two services i've called this part one tonight i think even if it's just only one part and you just took time now on your own and said i want to read about our father abraham i want to learn from his life i want to look at it in such a way to where i'm not just cherry-picking these stories of god veiled in flesh turning his back to the tent and and you just think that this is these remarkable instances of him running off and after his nephew and rescuing him and we don't just understand it following it in its progression i think you'll find that his story is your story let's stand to our feet tonight supreme faith revealed in abraham our heavenly father tonight i have experienced a great joy in ministering the word of god i'm especially grateful for lord as i've wrestled and fought and felt so overwhelmed with how to begin i'm thankful lord that there was believers praying that there's hearts that need to be spoken to and it's that need that's met when things become clear and lord tonight i feel such an inspiration to look at this life of abraham and being guided by the message of the hour that identifies him as an example to us it places him before us as an example of what you're going to do with the church in the last days i feel that there's a great mystery that his life unfolds and we don't want to miss it as a church we took time to look at the book of ruth and in doing it we found that there's so much in that there's a revelation that brings us close to god lord i pray that as we spend any more length of time together in this in our church services that you would harness it take control of it and use it to bring your seed to births and to mature birth seeds and to a greater level of faith and trust than we've ever had before and i commit the people to you tonight desiring that it be you that works maybe you that gets the glory for by looking at abraham there's not a works program that we can outline there's not a to-do list that we could set before any of the people but in looking at abraham we have to come to a place where say abraham believed god and that's what we must do and may we get in the habit of working out our salvation on a daily basis to where we trust you and you fulfill your word and keep your promise so much that it just becomes a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god so that the supernatural supreme faith can begin to manifest itself in our midst lord we believe in the movement of the spirit we believe in the gifts of the sphere we believe in divine healing we believe lord that you can do tremendous magnificent things in our lives but what we want what we want is the daily faith of god's elect and may it be in that daily living that we gather together in instances like this on wednesday nights and sunday mornings and special services where the power of god can move and fall upon an individual and they can find that back pain is eradicated that limbs are restored cancers are healed salvation is wrought not because we worked ourselves into some sort of phenomena but we're just in the routine of believing you and taking you at your word may we see supreme faith revealed in abraham may we see it unfold in our own lives bless your people tonight maybe go home full in our hearts in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen
