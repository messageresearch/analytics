[0:00] our bibles to luke chapter 10. luke
[0:02] chapter 10
[0:03] gonna read verses 33 34 and 35.
[0:09] continue on the subject of who is my
[0:11] neighbor tonight it's going to be very
[0:13] very simple
[0:14] it just uh there's been some things kind
[0:17] of coming to this chronologically
[0:19] and there's just been a couple points
[0:21] that the lord had been impressed upon my
[0:22] heart
[0:23] that we wanted just to touch on and
[0:25] won't be much depth to it though i
[0:26] believe the holy spirit can also
[0:28] can take things that may seem very
[0:30] simple very surface
[0:32] and when you live it that's when it's
[0:33] deep when you take it and can actually
[0:35] apply it and live it luke chapter 10
[0:37] verse 33 but a certain samaritan as he
[0:39] journeyed
[0:40] came where he was and when he saw him he
[0:43] had compassion on him this is that
[0:45] certain man that went down from
[0:46] jerusalem
[0:47] to jericho and was left half dead by
[0:49] thieves
[0:50] said and he went to him and bound up his
[0:52] wounds pouring in oil and wine
[0:55] and set him on his own beast and brought
[0:57] him to an end
[0:58] and took care of him and on the morrow
[1:01] when he departed he took out two pence
[1:03] and gave them to the host and
[1:05] said unto him take care of him
[1:07] whatsoever thou spend us more
[1:08] when i come again i will repay thee
[1:12] amen you may be seated i'm just going to
[1:15] jump right into it it may seem
[1:17] to be a little bit abrupt without much
[1:19] review or backtracking on things that
[1:21] we've ministered thus far for the first
[1:23] 10 parts in this but we've made mention
[1:26] of this
[1:26] before and you'll find i believe that as
[1:29] i've read in many many different
[1:31] commentaries have been studied on this
[1:32] subject now for several months
[1:35] the actions of this samaritan and again
[1:37] remember we're asking ourselves the
[1:38] question who is my neighbor
[1:41] to better understand our role within the
[1:42] community as message believers even as
[1:45] citizens of the state of arizona whether
[1:47] it be the county you live in the city
[1:49] you live in
[1:49] but really our role in responsibility as
[1:52] christians to one another
[1:53] and also to eat to mankind in general
[1:56] and so in asking the question who is my
[1:58] neighbor
[1:59] is drawn from this parable of the good
[2:01] samaritan
[2:02] and as i was mentioned a moment ago
[2:03] there's a lot of references
[2:05] uh when in studying the good samaritan
[2:08] how that
[2:08] christ is exemplified in the good
[2:11] samaritan and there's no doubt
[2:12] that we could see that the actions of
[2:14] the samaritan are reflective of the
[2:16] actions of christ
[2:17] who redeems us from our sin and we can
[2:20] each put ourselves in this journey
[2:22] as we're the man going down from
[2:23] jerusalem to jericho we're on our way to
[2:25] destruction
[2:26] which is what jericho represents we're
[2:28] beset by sin and we're left half
[2:30] dead we're spiritually dead we're we've
[2:34] a destitute of morals and just any way
[2:36] that you'd want to embellish it and take
[2:37] the very
[2:38] descriptive language that christ is
[2:40] using here and put ourselves into this
[2:42] picture and then we could see how that
[2:44] christ comes our way
[2:46] and religion couldn't help us in the
[2:48] form of the priest and
[2:50] religion couldn't help us in the form of
[2:51] the levite but yet christ comes to our
[2:54] aid he recovers us from our sins and
[2:56] and delivers us from our despair and and
[2:59] sets us on the right course
[3:00] and so we could we could see this as
[3:03] christ being reflective of this good
[3:05] samaritan we could place ourselves
[3:07] in the shoes of this certain man that's
[3:09] uh be fallen
[3:11] of thieves but i want to point this out
[3:14] that jesus uses these actions to define
[3:17] what it means to love thy neighbor
[3:19] as thyself because this is where the
[3:22] question
[3:22] who is my neighbor points back to this
[3:25] commandment that is written in the law
[3:27] to love thy neighbor as thyself this was
[3:29] elicited by the lawyer
[3:31] jesus said hey you've done good you've
[3:32] answered good if you do that you'll do
[3:34] well
[3:34] but then the lawyer seeking to justify
[3:36] himself says who is my neighbor
[3:38] so jesus uses the actions of the
[3:41] samaritan to define
[3:42] what it means to love thy neighbor as
[3:45] thyself
[3:46] and again this is just very simple uh
[3:49] we're just going to look at this
[3:50] these two verses here verses 33 and 34.
[3:54] actually we'll maybe get to we'll get to
[3:56] verses 34 and 35.
[3:59] just look at it for a moment and ponder
[4:02] jesus now using the actions of the
[4:05] samaritan to teach us what it means to
[4:07] love
[4:08] someone else or to love our neighbors as
[4:10] ourselves notice how descriptive christ
[4:13] gets we could just read it he says he
[4:15] went to him
[4:16] bound up his wounds pouring in oil and
[4:18] wine set him on his own beast
[4:20] brought him to an end took care of him
[4:22] on the morrow he departed and
[4:24] took out two pence gave them to the host
[4:26] and said take care of him and
[4:28] whatsoever thou spend us more when i
[4:30] come again i will repay thee
[4:33] think about just how christ takes step
[4:36] by step walking us through a period of
[4:39] time wherein the samaritan is
[4:41] rendering aid to this jew who has been
[4:44] wounded
[4:45] and the great care that is given in
[4:47] rendering this aid
[4:49] think about how descriptive christ is
[4:51] getting and
[4:52] as you ponder it i ask myself couldn't
[4:55] have christ
[4:56] made the point with less description in
[4:58] other words you say well the
[5:00] the levite walks by and he says i don't
[5:02] want to deal with this the priest walks
[5:03] by says i don't want to deal with this
[5:05] and it seems that christ could have made
[5:06] the point by saying but when the
[5:08] samaritans saw him he went and helped
[5:10] him
[5:11] and then asked the lawyer which one was
[5:13] neighbor to him who fell among thieves
[5:15] and the lawyer
[5:16] would have answered again just the same
[5:18] he would have said the one that showed
[5:19] mercy on them
[5:20] but jesus does not just say that the
[5:22] samaritan stopped and helped
[5:24] him he goes through these processes and
[5:26] these actions of the samaritan
[5:28] covering what i want you to catch
[5:30] tonight a long period of time
[5:32] you say long was it weeks was it days no
[5:34] but it covers hours
[5:36] of him stopping to help this person
[5:38] who's been wounded
[5:39] and jesus is doing it to make a point
[5:42] he's doing it because he does not want
[5:44] us to think that loving our neighbors is
[5:46] casual he does not want us to think
[5:47] that loving our neighbors is just simply
[5:49] and oh yeah yeah you know bless your
[5:51] heart whatever you want
[5:52] but there's something more that's
[5:53] contained in this loving thy neighbor
[5:56] as thyself i want to focus first now in
[5:59] verse 34
[6:01] as we have walked through each one of
[6:02] these where he came where he was he
[6:04] saw him had compassion on him and we
[6:07] understand that compassion scriptural
[6:08] compassion
[6:09] is to do the will of god that the the
[6:12] love of god is to do his will so it's
[6:14] not
[6:14] humanistic it's not carnal we don't want
[6:17] to try to put this in the category of
[6:18] you know you just need to
[6:20] where people sometimes get critical
[6:21] you're just a bleeding heart liberal or
[6:23] you're just this or you're just that
[6:25] it's not in the carnal realms of what
[6:26] love means love to love is to do the
[6:29] will of god that's what love is that's
[6:30] what compassion is
[6:32] but yet it's expressed this way in verse
[6:34] 34 and he went to him
[6:35] and bound up his wounds pouring in
[6:39] oil and wine so the binding of the
[6:42] wounds
[6:43] takes place with this activity of also
[6:46] pouring in
[6:47] oil and wine i think what i originally
[6:49] read it was he bound his wounds and he
[6:51] poured in oil and wine but the binding
[6:52] of the wound the healing of the womb the
[6:54] beginning
[6:55] of this healing process started with
[6:57] pouring in
[6:58] oil and wine and this oil and wine would
[7:01] have been mixed together
[7:03] and then applied the bible says in
[7:05] psalms 104 verse 15 just
[7:07] thinking about oil and wine together it
[7:09] says wine that maketh glad the heart of
[7:12] man
[7:12] an oil to make his face to shine in
[7:15] bread which strengtheneth man's heart
[7:18] you'll find over and over again through
[7:19] scripture especially in relation to
[7:21] offering and sacrifice that wine and oil
[7:24] are mentioned together it says wine
[7:26] makes the heart glad oil
[7:27] makes his face to shine these are the
[7:29] elements that jesus draws on
[7:31] when the samaritan is going to render
[7:34] aid and apply
[7:35] something to a wound in order to stop
[7:37] the bleeding in order to
[7:39] start the healing process he takes oil
[7:41] in wine
[7:43] and the wine would have had qualities
[7:44] which would have cleansed the wound
[7:46] just as we might take some sort of
[7:48] alcohol or some ointment now and
[7:50] apply it to a wound to clean out
[7:52] anything that might be a
[7:54] cause infection or any kind of dirt or
[7:56] grime the wine is poured in there to
[7:58] cleanse
[7:59] cleanse the wound and then the oil being
[8:01] mixed together with the wine
[8:03] it eases the pain caused by the wounds
[8:06] and this is the very image that's drawn
[8:08] from the scripture
[8:09] it's part of binding the wounds and what
[8:12] it as i pondered it
[8:13] and had been pondering over some time i
[8:15] realized that what this
[8:17] samaritan was doing was not just wanting
[8:19] to stop the bleeding
[8:21] and not just trying to clean up the
[8:23] situation to make it look a little bit
[8:24] better
[8:25] but he's doing the things necessary to
[8:27] promote healing
[8:28] here's somebody who is wounded he says
[8:30] now if he's wounded and he's bleeding
[8:32] then i want to i want to apply something
[8:34] that can clean the wound so that there's
[8:36] not infection later
[8:37] i want to apply something now that also
[8:39] begin to promote healing and ease his
[8:41] pain
[8:41] so this was for the purposes of
[8:43] promoting healing to rehabilitate the
[8:45] wound
[8:46] not just stop the bleeding the samaritan
[8:48] just wasn't squeamish
[8:50] let's just stop this let's cover this up
[8:52] i want to help but let's get this to a
[8:54] place where i can stomach it first
[8:56] no he was concerned about the long-term
[8:58] effects of the
[8:59] the wound he was concerned about what
[9:01] this ultimately could mean to this
[9:03] person's body
[9:04] if this wound festered and what it would
[9:06] mean to the person just to continue to
[9:07] hurt
[9:09] i i think it's a shame when we act in a
[9:12] way to intentionally hurt somebody
[9:15] and yes i mean physically i if you swing
[9:18] a if you swing at somebody with a
[9:19] baseball bat to
[9:20] to break their leg i think that's a
[9:22] shame if you do something to physically
[9:24] harm someone that's a shame
[9:25] but how callous and how cavalier we can
[9:28] be sometimes with our words
[9:29] that'll inflict wounds that are much
[9:31] deeper than physical wounds
[9:33] and so the samaritan is showing care and
[9:35] concern about how someone is feeling
[9:37] whether or not they're hurting what this
[9:39] long-term impact and the ramifications
[9:41] would be from these wounds
[9:42] and so he binds up his wounds he bound
[9:45] up his wounds
[9:46] and as he's binding up these wounds and
[9:47] no doubt using
[9:49] something he could apply such as the
[9:51] cloth or something to
[9:53] to tighten it up to cover it he's
[9:55] pouring in oil in wine
[9:57] the bible says in isaiah chapter 1 verse
[9:59] 6 from the soul of the foot even unto
[10:01] the head
[10:02] there is no soundness in it but wounds
[10:04] and bruises and
[10:05] putrefying sores it says that's very
[10:08] descriptive
[10:09] i don't have a slide for it just imagine
[10:11] it they have not
[10:12] been closed neither bound up neither
[10:15] multiplied
[10:16] with ointment so as isaiah describes the
[10:19] body being
[10:19] from head to toe with wounds and bruises
[10:22] and open
[10:23] festering sores this is this is what
[10:25] ought to be done to a sword
[10:27] they ought to be clothed closed and
[10:29] bound up
[10:30] emulified ease the painties made tender
[10:32] softened with ointment
[10:35] and this is exactly what the samaritan
[10:36] does he sees a wound he sees someone
[10:38] hurting
[10:39] he takes the oil and the wine and begins
[10:41] to administer to the one that is hurting
[10:43] he takes care over these wounds to
[10:45] number one ease his pain with the oil
[10:47] number two deal with infection by
[10:50] cleansing it with the wine
[10:53] now this struck me in such a deep way
[10:56] today i'd been
[10:57] pondering this particular aspect of oil
[11:00] and wine and we find it in other places
[11:02] in scripture it says in revelation touch
[11:03] not
[11:04] the oil and the wine and there's a lot
[11:06] of different references to it in the
[11:08] word of god that you could draw from
[11:10] and i found to me it just seemed like
[11:12] these were two different subjects
[11:14] that you have the oil and the wine
[11:15] that's mole used to molify with ointment
[11:18] and to bind things up and
[11:20] wine used to cleanse the wound and oil
[11:22] to ease the pain and
[11:23] i was seeing this as a very specific
[11:25] application
[11:27] of physical things oil and wine and that
[11:29] you would draw a type from that and when
[11:31] the bible speaks of
[11:32] touch not the oil and the wine the
[11:33] message with our deals with oil and wine
[11:35] i was seeing them as two different
[11:37] things but the holy spirit just brought
[11:39] them together because i realized
[11:40] that the oil and the wine are our
[11:43] critical
[11:44] resources to us the very very important
[11:48] resources to us
[11:50] and i want you to think of it this way
[11:51] as i'm just going to read a few
[11:53] statements that are all made within a
[11:54] few days
[11:55] by brother branham when he's preaching
[11:57] the seals the third seal the fourth seal
[11:58] in question answers on the seals
[12:00] as he deals with oil and wine and i'm
[12:02] doing this
[12:03] not to kind of veer into this territory
[12:05] of oh you're teaching things from the
[12:07] word of god and the book of revelation
[12:08] and these symbols but this is
[12:10] to make the word of god very very
[12:12] practical to us
[12:14] and to realize that when the bible jesus
[12:17] uses
[12:17] these elements of oil and wine and
[12:20] places them within the hands of the
[12:22] samaritan
[12:23] to render aid to the jew who's been
[12:25] wounded and left half
[12:26] dead these are elements and resources
[12:29] that are critical to us as christians
[12:31] these are resources that are very
[12:32] critical to us as believers
[12:34] and it's not only the resource that we
[12:36] serve with as a samaritan took oil and
[12:39] wine
[12:39] mix them together to to aid someone who
[12:42] was wounded but it's the resource from
[12:44] which we
[12:45] serve so it's not just things we have in
[12:48] our medicine bag that we use
[12:50] to apply in a particular situation but
[12:52] it's the very resource from which we
[12:54] serve
[12:56] and you understand the point i'm trying
[12:57] to make there we can look at the oil and
[12:59] wine as elements that we take and we use
[13:01] on somebody or that we use in a
[13:03] particular situation
[13:05] and that we minister with but it's not
[13:07] just elements we minister with it's the
[13:09] very elements we minister from
[13:12] and if we do not have these elements do
[13:14] we know how to use oil and wine do we
[13:16] have we really
[13:17] have oil and wine to use at our disposal
[13:19] but it is the resource from which we
[13:21] minister
[13:22] so now when i read these statements i
[13:24] want you to think about them
[13:25] not in terms of all word and revelation
[13:28] but rather the resource
[13:30] the wealth from which you are serving
[13:33] and then it being oh a resource from
[13:35] which you're drawing from that you have
[13:37] to draw from
[13:38] then you have something to give the song
[13:40] i've been just going through my mind
[13:42] today is i've got something that the
[13:43] world can't give
[13:44] and the world can't take it away that's
[13:47] what
[13:48] you have if the world can't give it to
[13:49] you
[13:51] and the world can't take it away from
[13:52] you now brother branham says in the
[13:55] third seal oil
[13:56] typifies spirit and wine symbolizes
[13:59] stimulation of revelation
[14:01] now the rest of these state the rest of
[14:03] these statements i'm reading or the rest
[14:04] of this statement and the next two
[14:05] statements
[14:06] are just really going to be saying the
[14:07] same thing the oil represents the spirit
[14:09] and wine symbolized symbolizes
[14:12] stimulation of revelation
[14:14] but it says boy i'd like to run all over
[14:16] the place it's a wonder i didn't wake up
[14:18] the neighborhood
[14:18] when the lord showed me that stimulation
[14:21] of revelation
[14:23] so wine represents stimulation of
[14:25] revelation
[14:26] now we know that the wine also
[14:27] represents blood represents the blood of
[14:29] jesus christ we could take that use as
[14:31] application
[14:32] how that we are covered in his blood and
[14:34] that we also
[14:36] claim the blood and we apply the blood
[14:38] and we have the token at our disposal
[14:40] and there's a whole line of teaching and
[14:43] instruction
[14:44] that we could take from that aspect but
[14:46] now the oil and wine together he
[14:47] brother says the oil represents the
[14:49] spirit the wine represents stimulation
[14:52] of revelation
[14:53] so when when you receive revelation it
[14:55] stimulates you and that's what wine does
[14:57] wine
[14:58] intoxicate wine stimulates so he's
[14:59] saying that the wine
[15:01] represents stimulation of revelation he
[15:03] says all and why in the bible are
[15:05] associated together always
[15:07] and you find this numerous instances in
[15:10] the old testament from early to the very
[15:12] end to the prophets and the major
[15:14] prophets minor prophets
[15:15] oil and wine oil and wine and the
[15:17] offerings that are made and
[15:19] and and the blessings that are it's
[15:20] represented in the blessings
[15:22] it says when the truth of the promised
[15:24] word of god has been truly revealed to a
[15:26] saints
[15:26] that's filled with oil they all get
[15:28] stimulated
[15:30] wine is stimulation it says gloria i
[15:33] feel it right now stimulated with joy
[15:35] and shouts
[15:36] and when it does it has the same effect
[15:38] upon them that wine does upon a natural
[15:40] man
[15:41] rebrand in another place talks about how
[15:42] you take a man who's all slumped down
[15:44] give him some wine what's it do it perks
[15:45] him up and he
[15:46] gets all kind of stimulated and bubbly
[15:48] he's saying the revelation of the word
[15:50] is the same thing to the believer
[15:52] now if you're feeling a little bit
[15:53] melancholy get into the word of god
[15:56] pray for revelation it's the best thing
[15:58] you can have for feeling
[16:00] melancholy and slump down and despondent
[16:02] a little depressed
[16:03] we say that this is as the song goes
[16:05] it's the most
[16:06] wonderful time of the year well a lot of
[16:10] people don't feel that way
[16:11] it can be a dreary time a depressing
[16:13] time it can be a difficult time
[16:14] and if it's not the most wonderful time
[16:16] of the effort just get into the word of
[16:18] god and pray for revelation
[16:19] it's going to stimulate you it's going
[16:20] to perk you up it's going to give you a
[16:22] little bit of bubbling going on in your
[16:24] soul
[16:24] so it says stimulate with joy and shouts
[16:26] and when it does it has the same effect
[16:28] upon them
[16:29] that wine does upon a natural man
[16:31] because when the revelation has been
[16:33] given of the truth of god
[16:35] and the true believer filled with oil
[16:37] and revelation is revealed the
[16:39] stimulation becomes so great
[16:41] that it makes him behave himself
[16:43] unnormally
[16:46] unnormally that's when it's really not
[16:48] normal
[16:49] you behave yourself unnormally why it's
[16:51] something that
[16:52] impacts the believer motivates them to
[16:54] act causes them
[16:55] to think differently and that's why
[16:57] people can say how can you be happy in a
[16:59] time like this
[17:00] you have a different resource how can
[17:02] you view a situation as
[17:04] dire as that and have such a positive
[17:06] outlook and
[17:07] an attitude of joy
[17:10] and and excitement in the midst of
[17:13] everything that's so chaotic it's
[17:14] because you have a different reservoir
[17:16] from which you're drawing from
[17:18] something else is stimulating you
[17:20] something else is exciting you you're
[17:21] not going by all the economic factors
[17:23] you're not going by the political
[17:24] factors you're not going by
[17:26] the things that are going on in the
[17:27] world today you have a different source
[17:29] and it causes you to behave yourself a
[17:32] normally
[17:33] it's the stimulation of revelation so
[17:36] oil represents the holy spirit
[17:38] wine represents the stimulation of
[17:40] revelation brother bam says that the
[17:41] fourth seal oil is symbolized as the
[17:43] holy spirit
[17:44] says then we find out that oil and wine
[17:46] is connected in worship
[17:48] always connected in worship so now
[17:50] brother branham brings them together all
[17:52] in wine or associated together in the
[17:54] bible
[17:54] now he says they're associated together
[17:56] in worship
[17:58] then the way it's the way these things
[18:00] came together where you just don't have
[18:02] the samaritan
[18:03] utilizing these elements to uh to heal
[18:06] to bind up a wound
[18:08] in this parable and then you have these
[18:10] other elements of oil
[18:12] and wine and the spirit and revelation
[18:15] and then being separate i begin to
[18:16] realize that yes
[18:18] the way that we live the way that we
[18:20] conduct ourselves the way that we
[18:22] respond to one another
[18:23] is part of our worship to god the use of
[18:26] the elements and resources that god
[18:28] gives us the way that we utilize them
[18:30] the way that we apply them
[18:32] the way that we liberally give them out
[18:34] the way that we want to be used by god
[18:35] is connected with our worship of god
[18:40] so it's is this oil and wine are
[18:41] connected together in worship
[18:43] it's not distinct or separated from even
[18:45] how jesus uses it
[18:47] in this parable he says the wine
[18:48] symbolizes the power of stimulation by
[18:50] revelation
[18:51] and when something's been revealed it
[18:53] gives stimulation to the believer
[18:55] because it's presented
[18:56] by revelation so again
[18:59] all represents the spirit wine
[19:01] represents stimulation by revelation
[19:03] and now oil and wine are connected in
[19:06] worship
[19:07] in the message question and answers on
[19:09] the seals he says oil as we look in the
[19:11] cymbals means the holy spirit
[19:13] wine and oil is connected together in
[19:16] the bible
[19:17] in worship so oil and wine oil
[19:20] represents the holy spirit wine and oil
[19:22] are connected together again in worship
[19:24] in the wine he says that's where i got
[19:25] the idea of stimulation wine
[19:27] stimulates and wine is the anti-type of
[19:30] its natural form
[19:32] from simulation is revelation so as
[19:35] wine stimulates the flesh revelation
[19:37] stimulates the spirit
[19:40] now just think what stimulates the
[19:42] church revelations
[19:43] so wine the new wine would be the oil
[19:46] and wine together now he says this the
[19:48] oil and wine went together in
[19:50] sacrifice went together in church
[19:52] worship assembled together connected
[19:54] together
[19:55] and if you again you go to the old
[19:56] testament you find where there's an
[19:58] offering made or there's to
[20:00] a tithing a gift a blessing put out it
[20:02] refers to oil in the wine oil and wine
[20:04] are so
[20:05] often frequently mentioned together and
[20:07] verb says they're come together in
[20:08] worship
[20:09] they come together connected together in
[20:11] church worship and went together in
[20:13] sacrifice
[20:16] he says now the oil is always the holy
[20:18] spirit we find it over in ezekiel we
[20:20] find in the old testament we find all
[20:21] through the new testament
[20:23] why do we anoint the sick with oil we
[20:25] anoint the sick with oil because it
[20:26] symbolizes the pouring out of the holy
[20:28] spirit upon them
[20:30] also the wise virgins had oil the unwise
[20:32] had no oil
[20:33] spirit now that that is the oil
[20:36] so what does the oil represent the holy
[20:38] spirit how is that applicable to us
[20:40] that would be uh in this mode of the
[20:43] good samaritan or in the model of the
[20:45] good samaritan
[20:46] we likewise must have the
[20:49] holy spirit we must have the holy spirit
[20:53] church can never be confused as merely
[20:56] trying to equip carnal people
[20:59] with principles that allow them to
[21:00] navigate the world a little bit softer a
[21:02] little bit easier
[21:03] no the goal of church the goal of
[21:06] preaching the gospel is to take a center
[21:08] to a place of a new birth experience
[21:10] which is to be sealed by the baptism of
[21:12] the holy ghost
[21:13] and now they possess eternal life
[21:16] they have a resource themselves now as a
[21:20] born-again son or daughter of god
[21:21] they're led by the spirit of god
[21:24] they've got something on the inside
[21:27] they have the inside teacher the most
[21:30] important teacher there is they have the
[21:32] comforter the paracletos
[21:33] they have something on the inside and
[21:35] it's that that the word of god speaks to
[21:39] if we knew right now that we were all
[21:41] carnal and that we
[21:43] we didn't have the holy ghost there was
[21:44] no such thing as the power of the holy
[21:46] ghost
[21:46] then this would be no different than a
[21:48] seminar just trying to drill into your
[21:50] head
[21:50] certain things that you could try to do
[21:52] to make your days a little bit easier
[21:54] and you'd have nothing to dig down deep
[21:57] and grab a hold of
[21:58] and cause it to act but that is not what
[22:00] we're engaging in this isn't a seminar
[22:02] this isn't a self-help
[22:03] evening on in the middle of the week to
[22:05] get you over hump day
[22:06] but rather the dynamics of the
[22:08] supernatural word of god is being spoken
[22:11] to supernatural seeds who can take that
[22:14] word
[22:14] to omnipotence meat and you can leave
[22:17] out that door back there
[22:18] and you can have something supernatural
[22:21] going before you
[22:22] living out through your flesh that's the
[22:24] blessing and the privilege
[22:26] of being a son and daughter of god is
[22:27] you have god
[22:29] on the inside that can make this word
[22:32] live
[22:34] and that's what we're drawing from when
[22:37] we say the al
[22:37] the oil represents the holy spirit it's
[22:39] not just something we're going to go and
[22:41] pick up and use but rather you've got it
[22:43] on the inside
[22:44] therefore it's at your disposal to use
[22:49] we can ask for god ask god to give us
[22:50] wisdom when we see a situation and say
[22:52] lord i'm being challenged on wednesday
[22:54] nights to love my neighbor as myself i
[22:56] don't want to rush
[22:57] too heavy into this i'm not sure what
[22:58] the situation may be say
[23:00] holy spirit give me wisdom
[23:03] lord i i'm not sure how just to act so
[23:05] i'll pray in the spirit i'll commit it
[23:08] to you in prayer
[23:09] and we ask god to help us oil represents
[23:11] the holy spirit it's the holy spirit
[23:13] that you want to go forth from you
[23:15] to minister to somebody else to come on
[23:17] the scene
[23:18] when you're in a difficult situation and
[23:21] then
[23:21] together with it brother i'm saying that
[23:23] the wine now
[23:25] the wine represents
[23:28] he says it's the the wine represents
[23:31] stimulation
[23:32] of revelation so oil symbolize the
[23:34] pouring of the holy spirit
[23:36] wine represents the stimulation of
[23:37] revelation he says
[23:39] if the oil represents god god is a
[23:42] spirit god is the word in the beginning
[23:43] was the word the word was with god the
[23:45] word was made flesh and that was god
[23:47] now if the word now sets here in natural
[23:49] form and
[23:50] i'm sure he's talking about the bible
[23:52] the wine is the water like the
[23:53] revelation
[23:54] that reveals that interpretation of the
[23:57] word
[23:58] which stimulates the believer he says
[24:00] i've never seen it before my glory
[24:02] stimulation of revelation
[24:05] so if we could take these elements
[24:07] together now just ponder it's very
[24:08] simple
[24:09] brother madam tells us that oil
[24:11] represents the holy spirit
[24:12] wine is the stimulation of revelation to
[24:15] the believer who has
[24:16] the oil so the wine is the revealed word
[24:20] to the believer when the word is
[24:22] revealed to you it stimulates you
[24:24] oh i've never seen that before glory
[24:26] it's the stimulation of revelation
[24:29] these two elements we must have in our
[24:31] lives
[24:33] what's what's going to be the most
[24:34] effective way to witness from
[24:36] from revelation not education if you've
[24:39] been educated into something and i'm
[24:41] sure you could all think about it right
[24:43] now and if we could solicit
[24:44] an example i'm sure some of you could
[24:46] share some very comical ones
[24:49] wherein you learned something in the
[24:51] message by education and then you tried
[24:53] to share it with somebody else
[24:55] and you're like oh man get this this is
[24:57] great you got to see this and you begin
[24:58] to explain it to them you realize
[25:00] what in the world am i talking about and
[25:02] they don't have any idea what you're
[25:03] talking about
[25:04] because by education you just tried to
[25:06] educate somebody else and you're not a
[25:07] very good educator
[25:09] and it doesn't make sense it doesn't
[25:10] come out right it doesn't it doesn't
[25:12] even seem like it's even
[25:13] making any sense but when something is
[25:15] revealed to you
[25:16] then from a position of revelation
[25:18] there's a stimulation that comes
[25:20] and then there's a witness of what god
[25:22] has shown to you
[25:24] yeah you may not be able to explain it
[25:25] you may lay it out just exactly the way
[25:27] that it's been
[25:28] given to you but revelation is the best
[25:31] resource from which to witness
[25:34] if you've been saved if you've been
[25:35] filled with the holy ghost the
[25:36] revelation of the new birth the
[25:38] revelation of jesus christ
[25:39] personally too is the best point from
[25:41] which you can witness
[25:43] and testify of a new birth to somebody
[25:45] else
[25:46] so these are things that we use at our
[25:48] disposal as christians things that we
[25:50] we have we can we say well this is what
[25:52] i have i have oil and wine that i could
[25:53] render aid but it's from oil and wine
[25:56] that you have this resource from which
[25:58] you can minister from
[26:00] and the way that it finally struck me
[26:02] and these things kind of came together
[26:04] where i wasn't just looking at
[26:05] two different examples in scripture of
[26:07] how oil and wine are represented
[26:09] is i realized that if we are not if we
[26:12] do not have the holy spirit
[26:13] and we are not being stimulated by
[26:15] revelation we cannot love our neighbors
[26:17] as ourselves
[26:19] we cannot minister we cannot serve we
[26:21] cannot
[26:22] we cannot be christ-like and live for
[26:24] others there is not a separation
[26:27] of these works that we would do that are
[26:29] christian and
[26:30] and kind and sincere and loving from
[26:33] this experience of a genuine new birth
[26:36] and the revelation of god's word and
[26:38] when i say the revelation of god's word
[26:40] i mean all
[26:40] seven seals the bright age the seven
[26:43] thunders you name it genesis to
[26:44] revelation all of it
[26:46] it's all applicable it all matters it's
[26:49] all worth it
[26:52] and it begs the question now i'm not
[26:54] posing this question to you i'm posing
[26:56] this question to myself
[26:57] maybe some of you would be humble enough
[26:58] to ask yourself this question
[27:00] or if we're all just feeling pretty
[27:02] pretty randy today and pretty good may
[27:03] we just think about somebody else
[27:05] and wonder i wonder if they're unable to
[27:08] love their neighbors as themselves
[27:10] because they lack the holy spirit or
[27:12] they don't have the stimulation of
[27:14] revelation
[27:15] and think of it in in that context
[27:17] because i know this is very simple and i
[27:19] could be brow beating certain whatsapp
[27:21] groups for being
[27:22] you know maybe real simple and very
[27:23] baptist-like and not pentecostal enough
[27:25] but i want you just to be very honest
[27:27] with yourselves and think about this
[27:29] that if this is what oil symbolizes this
[27:32] is what wine symbolizes
[27:34] and yet we are commanded and
[27:36] commissioned and we ought to love our
[27:37] neighbors as ourselves
[27:38] is the lack thereof the result of the
[27:41] lack of the holy spirit and the lack of
[27:43] stimulation of revelation
[27:44] yes now it seemed that that wouldn't
[27:46] necessarily be what we would think of
[27:48] well he has a hard time loving his
[27:49] neighbor
[27:50] those seals just haven't quite come open
[27:52] to him yet
[27:53] we we wouldn't say that but
[27:56] could it be could it be that people
[27:59] we are not walking fully in the
[28:03] attitude and character of christ because
[28:05] the very things that we pay lip service
[28:07] to of revelation and depth of the word
[28:09] and third pull and seven seals
[28:11] and all these different things aren't
[28:13] fully dawning on us
[28:15] and being quickened to us and revealed
[28:17] to us to stimulate us
[28:18] to act unnormally that if the word is
[28:22] really being revealed to us
[28:24] it's going to change our character it's
[28:26] going to change our nature it's not
[28:27] going to puff you up revelation is going
[28:28] to puff you up make you all arrogant
[28:30] look down on everybody who doesn't know
[28:31] what the third pull is
[28:32] but as the word is revealed to you and
[28:34] it softens you
[28:35] and it multiplies you and you're you're
[28:37] getting the ointment and you're getting
[28:38] the revelation
[28:39] and you have all and why i'm being put
[28:41] into you you're gonna have a different
[28:43] character and a different demeanor
[28:44] and a different approach to others you
[28:47] don't need to come on real strong
[28:49] with people it's the it's those who are
[28:52] unsure it's those who are weak those who
[28:54] have insecurities those that have
[28:55] complexes they got to come on real
[28:57] strong and real arrogant real
[28:58] condescending
[28:59] but when you know where you stand you
[29:01] can just go ahead and get real small
[29:03] real small to somebody just get beneath
[29:05] them and just start wherever you can
[29:08] and what begin to minister to somebody
[29:10] from a position of strength
[29:12] because you have the oil and you've been
[29:14] stimulated by revelation
[29:17] let's challenge ourselves and ask
[29:18] ourselves if we're finding it difficult
[29:21] to love our neighbors as ourselves
[29:23] is it because the oil is not freely
[29:25] operating
[29:26] is it because there's no stimulation of
[29:28] revelation and it's an easy fix to the
[29:30] believer get stimulated
[29:33] get into the world let it stimulate it
[29:34] let it break up the fallow ground let it
[29:36] break up the hardness and the complexes
[29:38] and all the fears and insecurities
[29:41] and let us take the oil and the wine to
[29:44] bind up wounds
[29:45] love our neighbors as ourselves now as
[29:48] we continue to read it says
[29:51] and he went to him and bound up his
[29:53] wounds pouring in oil and wine
[29:56] and set him on his own beast
[30:01] this now speaks to just how selfless
[30:05] this samaritan was and i know it seems
[30:09] fairly logical that if someone was half
[30:11] dead you wouldn't want to drag him
[30:12] behind your beast
[30:14] or force him to walk and you know come
[30:16] on let's go
[30:17] you're slowing me down but jesus
[30:21] mentioned it as a point of care
[30:25] that he set him on his own because he
[30:26] selflessly walked beside the wounded
[30:28] took the wound and placed him on his own
[30:30] beast begin to walk beside him
[30:32] and himself maybe using that beast
[30:36] and being carried forward he now takes
[30:39] steps down from the position that he had
[30:43] and he takes the wound and he sets him
[30:45] up on the beast
[30:46] now he's going to walk himself but now
[30:48] he's placed this one who's wounded
[30:50] in a place of greater ease and greater
[30:52] comfort where it makes his way easier
[30:54] i'll take the heart away i'll walk i'll
[30:56] trudge i'll carry maybe
[30:58] laden with more things now that i have
[31:00] someone taking my place upon
[31:02] my animal but i'm going to walk
[31:04] selfishly beside you and i'm going to
[31:06] let the energy and the power this piece
[31:08] carry you on
[31:08] and maybe my way will be a little bit
[31:10] harder but it's going to be better for
[31:11] you in this case
[31:14] that's something we can learn we can
[31:16] learn just from this aspect alone
[31:18] that he took the wounded and set him on
[31:19] his own beast
[31:21] and i'm gonna i'm taking it maybe a
[31:23] little bit out of order because it says
[31:24] and it brought him
[31:26] to an end and i just want to
[31:30] say this at this point it speaks to his
[31:32] commitment
[31:34] that it was a journey that he would take
[31:36] with the wounded
[31:37] all the way to the end he didn't just
[31:39] kind of get him said now do you know
[31:40] where you're at you kind of understand
[31:42] your orientation you see this road here
[31:43] go ahead and follow this when you get
[31:44] down around that corner just to your
[31:46] left
[31:46] kind of go down this little nook there
[31:48] there'll be an end there and
[31:50] and you will see that you will come
[31:51] check on you later maybe
[31:53] no he said i'm going to walk with you
[31:55] i'm committed to you
[31:57] and i'm going to go with you and take
[31:59] you as the one that is wounded is the
[32:00] one who needs the help
[32:02] i'm going to walk with you and i'm going
[32:03] to use my my beast i'm going to carry
[32:05] you and it's going to be a little bit
[32:06] harder for me
[32:07] and maybe a little bit easier for you
[32:09] but i'm going to i'm committed in the
[32:11] journey to getting you to a place
[32:12] where you can get the help that you need
[32:15] is that does that
[32:16] speak to you is that something that
[32:18] strikes you think
[32:20] there's a way i can make this applicable
[32:22] in my life where i'm committed to
[32:23] something
[32:25] i don't just have a hot sports opinion
[32:27] about it or a hot take or you know
[32:28] you want to tell you you want my two
[32:29] cents right
[32:31] well i'll tell you what you should do
[32:33] and we can always we always can monday
[32:35] morning quarterback we can always have
[32:37] something that we can say about how
[32:38] somebody did something else wrong or you
[32:40] wouldn't be in this mess if this hadn't
[32:41] happened
[32:42] and we got all sorts of hot takes on it
[32:44] right but where's the commitment to say
[32:46] all right i'm committed
[32:48] in your situation right now there's a
[32:51] place of safety there's a place ahead
[32:53] let's walk in this journey together i'll
[32:55] be with you and i'll take your journey
[32:56] i'll take this journey with you
[32:58] to see that you get the help that you
[32:59] need
[33:01] it says that he set him on his own beast
[33:03] and brought him to an
[33:04] end we'll come back to that lord willing
[33:06] here in a moment and
[33:08] took care of him
[33:11] this speaks of our personal
[33:13] responsibility
[33:14] as a christian the samaritan himself
[33:18] brought him to an end and it says the
[33:19] samaritan now the samaritan
[33:22] took care of him this is our individual
[33:25] duty
[33:25] our personal responsibility as a
[33:28] christian
[33:30] we may feel overwhelmed just taking care
[33:32] of ourselves can i get an amen
[33:34] we feel overwhelmed just taking care of
[33:36] ourselves but we have a responsibility
[33:39] as christians
[33:40] to take care of others and this is not a
[33:43] duty that we can pass off to the church
[33:46] and i know that sometimes in our minds
[33:48] we we think that there's just kind of
[33:49] like this
[33:50] mythical thing that just kind of
[33:51] functions in the ether
[33:53] called the church and things just get
[33:54] done but you want to know how things get
[33:57] done in church
[33:58] just look around this is how things get
[34:01] done in church
[34:02] people do things people volunteer people
[34:05] visit and they hop on the base people
[34:07] who don't normally play an instrument
[34:08] volunteer to play an instrument people
[34:10] don't normally leave songs
[34:11] uh lead songs and sometimes they quit
[34:13] after they volunteer
[34:14] but there's people who give and they and
[34:16] they help and they render aid and they
[34:17] do things
[34:18] and that's how things function and
[34:19] that's how things operate
[34:21] is because people offer people are
[34:24] getting things done and so we think oh
[34:26] well the church will take care of it
[34:27] well who's taking care of it if the
[34:29] church has taken care of it
[34:30] you thought about that who's looking out
[34:33] after it
[34:35] it can't all be one person
[34:38] and so it's the duty that we do not pass
[34:40] off to a church it's a duty that we
[34:41] don't just pass off to a preacher
[34:43] it's a duty we don't pass off to anyone
[34:45] else
[34:47] we all have to be in this together
[34:50] in philippians chapter 2 verse 4 it says
[34:52] look not every man on his own things
[34:54] we've been
[34:54] drawing from philippians chapter 2 quite
[34:56] a bit already look not every man on his
[34:59] own things
[34:59] but every man also on the things of
[35:02] others now there's a lot of grace here
[35:07] it doesn't tell you not to look on your
[35:09] own things
[35:11] right it says look not every man on his
[35:13] own things but
[35:14] every man also on the things of others
[35:16] it's a given you're going to be worried
[35:18] about your own
[35:19] it's a given that you're concerned about
[35:21] your own situation your own family your
[35:23] own needs your own wants all these
[35:24] different lackings that you might have
[35:25] your own health
[35:26] your own uh well-being your own job your
[35:29] own finances
[35:30] and so it's a given that you would look
[35:31] on your own things but don't just look
[35:34] on your own things
[35:34] let every man also look upon the needs
[35:37] and the things of others
[35:39] and we could say paul establishes this
[35:42] as the duty of every man
[35:45] the duty of every woman not just to be
[35:46] worried about your own but also to look
[35:49] after the needs of
[35:50] others the things of others in other
[35:52] words none of us have a right
[35:55] to live only unto ourselves none of us
[35:58] none of us have a right to live only for
[36:00] ourselves in disregard to others
[36:02] now we have a right to look after our
[36:03] needs to look after our own look after
[36:05] our family to care for our own household
[36:07] to be sure that we're taken care of and
[36:09] it's a given that we would be worried
[36:10] about that or concerned about
[36:12] that or we would take great care to see
[36:13] that certain needs are met
[36:15] but none of us have a right to live
[36:16] within that paradigm alone
[36:20] you say well man being a christian is a
[36:21] lot more than i bargained for you better
[36:23] believe it
[36:24] it's living for others that's what
[36:26] eternal life is is living for others and
[36:28] so we cannot just live to ourselves
[36:30] not even as a church not even as a
[36:31] family there's got to be something that
[36:33] opens us up to where we're willing to
[36:36] serve others
[36:37] live for others do something for
[36:38] somebody else and to express the love of
[36:41] god to those who may seem to be
[36:43] undeserving of it to do things for
[36:45] others
[36:45] who are in a position of need and want
[36:47] because we are not allowed as christians
[36:49] this is the duty of every man
[36:51] we do not have a right to live for
[36:53] ourselves in disregard to others
[36:57] and really this scripture counters our
[36:59] selfless nature
[37:01] because i think in general my instinct
[37:03] you know we're just we're selfish we're
[37:05] going to look out after our own we're
[37:06] going to do what we need to do to make
[37:07] sure we're taken care of
[37:12] it's not generally instinctive for
[37:14] someone to defer and to
[37:16] to share and to give though we meet
[37:19] people who are that way
[37:21] and i'm sure you could think of people
[37:22] just seem to be instinctively even some
[37:23] children
[37:24] just will it be instinctive to share and
[37:26] they don't like to see somebody suffer
[37:27] or sad or hurt him
[37:29] but the scripture is countering and
[37:31] striking out against our selfless nature
[37:33] and it's meant to provoke us to express
[37:36] the love of christ
[37:39] paul touches on it later on in that same
[37:40] chapter philippians chapter 2 verses 20
[37:42] and 21
[37:43] he says for i have no man like mine he
[37:45] said i'm a sin timothy he's going to
[37:46] take care of you because i don't have
[37:47] anyone who thinks like me
[37:49] and acts like me who will naturally care
[37:51] for your state
[37:53] so i i know timothy will i'm going to
[37:55] send timothy because he's more
[37:57] like-minded he'll naturally care for
[37:58] your say he'll be concerned about you
[38:00] and the situation you're in
[38:01] but notice what he says about mankind in
[38:03] general or maybe everyone else that he
[38:05] knew
[38:05] for all seek their own not the things
[38:07] which are jesus christ
[38:10] this is kind of companion to what he
[38:12] says in verse 4 every man
[38:13] also should look upon the things of
[38:15] others but we all are willing to seek
[38:17] our own
[38:18] in not the things which are jesus christ
[38:20] it tells me
[38:21] that there's something about seeking
[38:23] someone else's need and meeting
[38:25] something else's needs
[38:26] that's inherent in a character of jesus
[38:30] christ
[38:32] and listen if if there's a uh whether it
[38:34] be within a family or a relationship
[38:36] within the body of christ i can say this
[38:38] as christians as believers
[38:40] our unity is broken by selfishness
[38:44] that's what's gonna break unity and when
[38:47] we only give attention to our own needs
[38:49] we're building walls
[38:51] walls without gates we're building walls
[38:54] without bridges there's no there's no
[38:56] uh harmony there's no coming together
[39:03] and so it's our unity is broken by
[39:06] selfishness
[39:08] so paul says every man also on the
[39:10] things of others
[39:11] it's to challenge us out of our
[39:13] selfishness
[39:15] it's in this vein that the samaritan
[39:17] took care of him
[39:19] unselfish willing to give willing to
[39:22] help
[39:23] now brother branham this i don't want to
[39:26] read a couple statements here on this
[39:27] thought of taking care of him
[39:30] and our duty as a christian
[39:33] brother brown when he's preaching the
[39:34] revelation of jesus christ and he's
[39:36] taking the pergamon church age he's
[39:37] talking about
[39:38] saint martin this messenger he's talking
[39:39] about one of the greatest miracle-filled
[39:41] lives of anybody in the church ages
[39:43] he said he was a soldier and one day he
[39:47] was coming by and there was a man
[39:48] laying cold and shivering and all the
[39:51] people was not willing
[39:52] was able to help the man but they just
[39:54] pas pass by him like the priest and
[39:56] levites did the good samaritan
[39:58] so now brother branham takes saint
[40:00] martin as the soldier
[40:02] walking by this man who's cold shivering
[40:04] and
[40:05] able people are walking by and he puts
[40:07] them in the figure of the priest and the
[40:09] levite but now
[40:10] he brings us to the image of the good
[40:11] samaritan but when saint martin come by
[40:14] realizing his duty as a christian
[40:16] believer
[40:18] he had one coat a cloak over his
[40:20] shoulders he cut it in two with this
[40:22] sword and gave half of it to the beggar
[40:24] and he took the other half and that
[40:26] night began his career for jesus christ
[40:29] appeared to him in a vision
[40:30] wrapped in that same robe that he cut
[40:32] into which fulfilled the scripture in so
[40:34] much as you've done unto these
[40:36] you've done it unto me he says so take
[40:39] for a lesson now this brother branham
[40:41] taking this as a lesson
[40:42] using the life of saint martin and this
[40:46] act in which he realized his duty as a
[40:50] christian believer
[40:52] he says whatever you do to somebody
[40:54] you're doing it unto christ
[40:58] now he says whatever you do to somebody
[41:00] you're doing it unto christ
[41:02] now if you just took that principle it
[41:05] said all right from now
[41:06] on whatever i do to anybody
[41:09] i'm going to imagine or think that i'm
[41:11] doing it unto christ
[41:12] how different would our lives be all of
[41:13] a sudden like those dms you've been
[41:16] sending or whatever it is you do to
[41:17] you know to be mean to somebody and
[41:19] bully somebody if all of a sudden you
[41:20] realize
[41:21] i'm texting christ i'm talking about
[41:24] christ i'm about to do a shady deal on
[41:27] christ
[41:28] i'm about to undercut this christ and
[41:30] you just change it to her now whatever
[41:32] you're doing it you're doing it to
[41:33] christ
[41:34] that should moderate conduct right
[41:36] hopefully
[41:38] you know otherwise i think he can handle
[41:40] he's a big boy
[41:41] i mean it would change the way that we
[41:42] would act because now we're like no
[41:44] whatever i do to somebody
[41:46] no matter how low down dirty rotten
[41:48] scoundrel they are whatever i do to
[41:50] somebody
[41:50] i'm doing it unto christ he says let's
[41:52] say it together and it says the
[41:54] congregation brethren speak in unison
[41:55] what you do to others you have done to
[41:58] christ
[42:00] it's different even in saying do unto
[42:02] others as you'd have them do unto you
[42:05] it is what you do to others you have
[42:07] done to christ
[42:08] brother bam does not qualify whatever
[42:10] you do to a holy spirit feel believer
[42:11] who believes in the
[42:12] the bride age and believes all seven
[42:13] seals are open and believes this and
[42:15] believes that you've done unto christ he
[42:16] said whatever you've done to somebody
[42:18] else
[42:19] whatever you've done to anybody else
[42:22] you've done unto christ he says so no
[42:23] matter what he thinks about you
[42:26] it's what you think about him that
[42:28] brings the blessing
[42:30] wow praise the lord gives me an
[42:32] opportunity to kind of reverse the curse
[42:34] somebody may think very negatively about
[42:36] me somebody have made very negative
[42:38] things to say about me
[42:39] but it's not what he thinks about me
[42:41] it's what i think about him that brings
[42:42] the blessing
[42:44] now how negative and how much vitriol
[42:46] and venom and animosity someone could
[42:48] have and lies and hatred
[42:50] and whatever they can say about you say
[42:51] well i'm not going to let that change my
[42:53] attitude
[42:54] because if there's going to be a
[42:55] blessing it's going to be in a blessing
[42:56] is in how i think about him
[42:58] so i'm going to think about him
[43:00] differently even that he's thinking
[43:01] about me
[43:02] and that avails myself to a blessing
[43:07] what you do to others you have done to
[43:09] christ so no matter what he thinks about
[43:11] you it's what
[43:12] you think about him
[43:15] i'm using this to amplify the actions of
[43:17] the good samaritan wherein he
[43:18] took care of him we've even mentioned
[43:21] before how the hymn
[43:23] is a jew that would have been a bitter
[43:25] enemy a rival
[43:26] to the samaritan
[43:30] he took care of him this is our personal
[43:32] responsibility this is our
[43:33] individual duty as christians not
[43:36] something we shirk not something we pass
[43:37] off to
[43:38] someone on a board not something we pass
[43:40] off to a preacher not something we pass
[43:41] off
[43:42] to the ether it's something we
[43:44] individually have a duty to do
[43:47] bill abraham says in the message why
[43:49] every one of you has got something to do
[43:51] now
[43:52] every one of you get right in your
[43:54] church and work
[43:56] just as hard as you can for your local
[43:58] church
[44:00] i think that's wonderful work hard for
[44:02] your local church
[44:03] he says but don't ever criticize now
[44:05] this is to me it kind of takes uh
[44:08] um it takes
[44:11] maybe a different turn or begins to
[44:13] amplify a pain a little bit different
[44:14] part of this picture
[44:16] but think about the first part of this
[44:18] get to work every one of you has got
[44:19] something to do
[44:20] work just as hard as you can for your
[44:22] local church now he says but don't ever
[44:24] criticize why
[44:25] if you're working for your local church
[44:26] guess what we're not the only one
[44:30] right i've always wondered why is it
[44:31] called the first baptist church of
[44:33] phoenix you know
[44:33] does it mean the first one there and
[44:35] what's that what does that say about
[44:36] everybody else
[44:37] but we're not the first message church
[44:39] we're one among many we're not the only
[44:41] church we're not the only local church
[44:43] but what does brother bradham identify
[44:45] the tendency for there to be rivalry
[44:48] in competition and comparison so he says
[44:51] but don't ever criticize
[44:53] if you know something bad about the
[44:55] other side don't say
[44:56] nothing about it keep that to yourself
[45:00] i don't notice anybody writing it down
[45:02] i'm gonna i'll go slowly here
[45:05] don't never criticize double negative so
[45:08] it reinforces it
[45:10] if you know something bad about the
[45:13] other side
[45:14] don't say nothing about it you get it
[45:19] he says keep that to yourself the
[45:22] enemy's just listening to hear that
[45:26] my don't let him know nothing
[45:29] don't speak nothing out then he won't
[45:32] know nothing about it
[45:34] keep it to yourself and pray i think
[45:37] that's good
[45:39] get in and work all you can for your
[45:40] local church do everything you can for
[45:42] the body that god places you in
[45:44] be a part of it sell out to it and that
[45:46] you're going to give yourself and your
[45:48] time and your prayers and your energy
[45:49] and your resources
[45:50] do something for the kingdom of god but
[45:52] in doing so it doesn't create rivals it
[45:54] doesn't create factions
[45:55] and if somebody's doing something wrong
[45:56] and something's gone haywire or
[45:58] something's gone sideways
[45:59] don't be talking about it don't
[46:01] criticize it you're only undermining all
[46:04] the good you're doing
[46:07] you don't ever want there to be a
[46:08] narrative associated with what you're
[46:10] doing
[46:11] where things become anti-and things
[46:13] become against before something
[46:16] be positive keep it to yourself and pray
[46:20] say well the poor brother did wrong but
[46:21] don't down him he's down anyhow
[46:24] try to pick him up lift him up be the
[46:27] good
[46:27] samaritan try to pick him up
[46:31] if you can't even talk to him well i
[46:34] can't even talk to the guy
[46:35] pray for him till it is that way
[46:39] if you can't talk to him then pray for
[46:41] him until you can
[46:42] if you can't even talk to him pray for
[46:44] him till he it is that way
[46:46] just keep him on your heart because his
[46:48] soul's worth
[46:49] ten thousand worlds oh if god could just
[46:53] impress that upon us sometimes the
[46:54] people
[46:55] that we're so burdened by or so offended
[46:58] by are so hurt by
[46:59] that if we could still yet realize to
[47:02] god
[47:02] the soul is worth ten thousand worlds
[47:06] we may not be able to talk to them but
[47:08] could we pray till we could
[47:12] he says he so he's saying you've got
[47:14] something to do
[47:15] every one of you get right into church
[47:16] work just as hard as you can but let's
[47:18] not be critical
[47:19] don't criticize if something happens
[47:21] wrong something on the other side the
[47:22] enemy's just listening to hear what you
[47:24] want to say keep it to yourself
[47:25] pray for him he says be the good
[47:27] samaritan try to pick him up
[47:29] and gain an ally in the cause of christ
[47:34] he took care of him
[47:39] went to and bound up his wounds pouring
[47:41] in oil and wine set him on his own beast
[47:43] brought him to an end and took care of
[47:46] him
[47:47] this was not just a few minutes of
[47:48] pretending that he cared
[47:51] oh you sit there and you're getting your
[47:53] tires changed at big o tires and
[47:55] so when you say hey how are you doing
[47:57] the person says oh i'm glad you asked
[48:00] and you're like i think they're calling
[48:01] me my tires are done
[48:04] it's not just kind of sitting there and
[48:05] just trying to suffer through a
[48:06] conversation oh i can just get through
[48:08] this conversation
[48:09] it's not it's not just hearing somebody
[48:11] out and then trying to ease your way out
[48:13] of the conversation
[48:14] this was more than just a few moments of
[48:16] pretending to care
[48:19] even to this point everything he's done
[48:21] has demonstrated there's more to it
[48:23] i want you to notice what the bible says
[48:24] he went to him bound up his wounds
[48:27] pouring in oil and wine set him on his
[48:29] own beast
[48:30] and brought him to an end jesus being so
[48:33] descriptive
[48:34] step by step even as he came to where he
[48:36] was went down to where he was came to
[48:38] him saw him
[48:39] did all these things he's acting
[48:40] described step by step by step
[48:42] but now as the stories unfolding he set
[48:45] him on his own beast
[48:46] brought him to an end that's covering
[48:47] some duration
[48:50] and then it says in verse 35 and on the
[48:53] morrow when he departed
[48:56] he spent the night with him i want you
[48:59] to think about that
[49:01] it wasn't just that day it just wasn't a
[49:03] moment of what can i do for you but the
[49:05] samaritan
[49:06] took them to the end and he overnighted
[49:09] with them
[49:10] he stayed with them through the night
[49:13] through the hard part the difficult part
[49:16] he's there at the outset in the
[49:17] beginning
[49:17] probably the most horrible time it would
[49:20] have been for this traveler
[49:21] all of a sudden his travels completely
[49:22] interrupted in the darkness of night and
[49:24] the chaos of the night in the strange
[49:26] place with wounds that are still hurting
[49:28] here is he stays with him through the
[49:30] night and he gives us the image of the
[49:32] samaritan
[49:33] not just bringing him to the place and
[49:35] dumping him at the
[49:37] on the the in the foyer of a hotel but
[49:39] he says
[49:40] give me two rooms give me one next to
[49:42] his
[49:43] and let me stay with them and watch with
[49:45] them through the night
[49:47] he says and on the morrow when he
[49:49] departed it tells us
[49:51] he stayed with him all night and that
[49:54] means something to you
[49:56] does it does it speak to you that the
[49:58] samaritan
[50:00] was willing to go list a little bit
[50:02] further
[50:03] take just a little bit more more care
[50:07] and on the moral when he departed it
[50:09] could very well just say took care of
[50:11] them
[50:11] through the night and stayed with them
[50:14] till the morning
[50:16] verse 35 and on the morrow when he
[50:17] departed he took out two pins
[50:21] this would have represented some
[50:23] significant portion of a wage a monthly
[50:25] wage a
[50:26] you know salary earned and gave them to
[50:29] the host
[50:30] there's not even going to income you
[50:32] know burden the host
[50:35] you say this is my responsibility i
[50:38] found the man
[50:39] i brought him here my duty does not stop
[50:42] here though i may depart
[50:43] whatever you need here's something to
[50:46] begin with
[50:47] he says and he said unto him take care
[50:50] of him
[50:51] and whatsoever thou spend this more when
[50:53] i come again
[50:54] i will repay thee
[50:58] i'm just going to be wrapping up here
[51:00] just have two statements i want to read
[51:01] from the message and close
[51:04] but now the scene changes just a little
[51:07] bit
[51:08] for we could imagine that the samaritan
[51:10] departs
[51:12] and in the samaritan and the bible says
[51:14] he took care of him that represents our
[51:16] personal
[51:16] responsibility as a christian the duty
[51:18] that is imposed upon every man
[51:20] we as message believers have this
[51:21] individual duty to take care of to love
[51:24] our neighbor as
[51:25] ourselves but now it changes
[51:28] and the samaritan says take care of him
[51:33] and i want this to represent our duty as
[51:34] a church
[51:36] that this is our responsibility in
[51:39] responsibility and duty as a church
[51:41] together
[51:42] that not only do we individually take
[51:44] care of him
[51:46] but we also as a church take care
[51:49] of him something we do together
[51:52] now just i'm just wrapping this up just
[51:54] closing here
[51:56] brother branham says in the message
[51:57] jezebel religion he says remember the
[51:59] good samaritan
[52:00] that found the man wounded he brought
[52:03] him to the end
[52:05] and brother brahman says that's the
[52:07] church
[52:09] i'm glad we have a place to take people
[52:13] i'm so i thank god for this church i'm
[52:14] so glad we have a place
[52:16] that we can take people and we don't
[52:18] just send them to a website
[52:20] we don't just send them to a youtube
[52:22] channel but we have a place that we can
[52:24] send them
[52:26] he says he brought him to an end that's
[52:28] the church
[52:30] you have an individual responsibility to
[52:33] take care of others to love others as
[52:35] yourselves
[52:36] to to to render aid to to do these
[52:38] things that we're talking about but then
[52:39] we also have this responsibility
[52:41] as a church that when we have ministered
[52:43] to others witness to others
[52:45] when we are personally evangelizing we
[52:48] have a place that we can bring them
[52:49] and we bring them to the end brother
[52:51] says that's the church and gave the man
[52:53] their two pence
[52:55] and told him if he needed any more he'd
[52:56] pay him when he come
[52:58] so he's got two pence he's able to
[53:01] doctor you up if he's a man of god
[53:03] if he's a man of god that stands on the
[53:05] word of god he's got what god give him
[53:07] the spirit
[53:08] and the word and let me say
[53:12] this church has the spirit and the word
[53:15] and we ought not be ashamed to bring
[53:17] people to the end
[53:19] to invite people to the end i mean this
[53:21] is almost very literally
[53:23] and in i mean the residence inn is next
[53:27] door i think this is the courtyard
[53:29] by marriott here we are this is the end
[53:30] this is a hotel let's invite people to
[53:33] the
[53:33] end we have a place that we can invite
[53:36] them we have a
[53:37] we have the spirit and we have the word
[53:39] we don't fall we don't lack at
[53:40] all in these things we don't fall behind
[53:43] the body of christ at all in these
[53:45] things in spirit and the word we have
[53:47] these resources at our disposal they've
[53:49] been committed to this local church
[53:51] we have faithful people we have a desire
[53:53] and our hearts to serve
[53:54] let us be up and doing let us give all
[53:56] that we can every one of you's got
[53:58] something to do now every one of you get
[54:00] right in your church work just as hard
[54:02] as you can for your local church
[54:03] go out bring them to the end we've got
[54:06] spirit and word that can minister to
[54:08] people
[54:10] we have it at our disposal
[54:13] and brother branham in the message let
[54:15] us see god
[54:16] that's what we want to see we want to
[54:18] see god we want to see him lived out in
[54:20] us we want to see him manifested
[54:22] he says now i want to say this that
[54:24] every person that's been converted this
[54:26] week
[54:28] now look at this bunch of ministers they
[54:30] stand for the same thing that i do
[54:33] some of those have been converted these
[54:34] new converts he says we haven't one
[54:36] difference at all we're absolutely
[54:38] the same we believe in the full gospel
[54:40] the baptism of the holy ghost all these
[54:42] things all these ministers here we're
[54:43] all just
[54:44] exactly the same and we want you to join
[54:46] their
[54:47] church so you can continue on
[54:50] and he says the good samaritans come by
[54:54] poured oil in the wound this is how he
[54:57] uses that image of christ he comes by he
[54:59] pours oil in the wound
[55:00] christ coming by witnessing rendering
[55:02] aid ministering to somebody
[55:04] christ coming by doing something for
[55:06] somebody then what's the next thing
[55:09] what do we do we have a responsibility
[55:11] as a church to care just the same
[55:13] so he says the samaritans come by he's
[55:15] poured in oil in the wound
[55:17] but he's took you now and he wants you
[55:20] to go to one of the ends here the
[55:22] closest to you
[55:24] he's done paid the pastor to take care
[55:26] of you
[55:27] so he's paid now he says it's about the
[55:28] pastor this will be said about each one
[55:30] of us
[55:31] he's received the holy ghost got
[55:33] blessings of god and health and
[55:35] revelation
[55:36] he can just feed your soul so you come
[55:39] now and join one of the churches
[55:41] and it'll be the best thing that you can
[55:43] do to keep your spirit fed
[55:46] and moving on whoo i like that
[55:50] this is how the prophet instructs us
[55:54] i know to those who come to the end on a
[55:56] wednesday night believe in church
[55:58] i know you do i know that there's dozens
[56:02] now streaming who would like to be here
[56:05] unable to do so because of different
[56:07] situations and health and things
[56:09] so i know that we believe in this but
[56:12] let us be inspired to it
[56:14] you have the oil the holy ghost you have
[56:18] stimulation of revelation as you dig
[56:19] into this word
[56:21] we have the res that resource from which
[56:23] we're ministering from
[56:24] and it's resources that we have to give
[56:28] and that's our into as a individual i
[56:30] have a responsibility
[56:32] to look upon the needs of others as an
[56:34] individual i have a responsibility
[56:36] to love my neighbor as myself and then
[56:38] all of us collectively as a church we
[56:40] join together in this burden
[56:42] to take care of them as well that if you
[56:45] bring someone in your family who's
[56:47] hurting

[56:56] to render aid this is going to be a
[56:58] place of safety this is going to be a
[56:59] place
[57:00] of ministry this could be a place where
[57:01] someone can find health and revelation
[57:03] where their souls can be fed
[57:07] not a place where they can figure out
[57:08] just how short they come and just how
[57:10] they don't have it figured out how
[57:11] little they know
[57:12] but a place that they can come and find
[57:13] christ
[57:15] because just as the samaritan took care
[57:18] of him
[57:19] christ stands i believe commissioning us
[57:22] and telling us here
[57:23] i've given you what you need now you
[57:25] take care of him
