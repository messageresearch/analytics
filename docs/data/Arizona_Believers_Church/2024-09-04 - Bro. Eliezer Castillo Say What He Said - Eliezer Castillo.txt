TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but uh my my title is say what he says and actually my uh the scripture that I wanted to read was from 10 or from 9 to 10 but reading in the back it kind of confirmed certain things where from six all the way to 10 it's talking about a believer that that is being justified and he's saying righteousness says this he well he he says that and then he says he doesn't say that should we go up to heaven and bring Christ down for our justification or should we go down to the deep and bring him back up but he says no he's like we don't need that anymore we don't need to to ask Lord let let me see your Resurrection again or let me see you rise up or let me see you descend in order for me to be justified because we know that by his resurrection we were Justified and he's telling these people that Faith doesn't say that but what it says is that the word or the promise that Jesus already did that it's already with you that this word this Bible This Promise as simple as it is it's in it written in in Black Ink it says that Jesus has already done that and by that word whenever we receive it into our not only our heart but our lips that something there's a transformation that happens within us just by receiving the promise just by receiving the word and and there's these two things that that is necessary for salvation and those two things are a confession of what Jesus Christ did a confession of the word saying yes I I believe it and the second one is believing it with your heart and it says to believe unto righteousness and confess unto salvation and those are the two things that we need for this salvation and um of course us as me message Believers brother Bram he explained and we see in the Bible that we are Triune beings that that um we have a soul body spirit our body has the five senses the Inside Man the spirit has the inner five senses which is our conscience our memory and all of that and then the inside of the inside just like we heard brother Aaron talk about the soul there's one thing governing it it's either Faith or doubt and in other quotes brother brandham said that it's it's a free will to either accept or deny anything so so that's how how we were created we were created if I would like to say it um just just so that I can um be a little forward but we were created to receive media we were created to receive words brother Bram in one one text he said that the the mind is the womb of the spirit and and another one he said that the the the mind is the gate to the soul so so we were made so that we could receive something all the way down to the soul so that we can become that thing that we received and I I started to think about that and I started to think about just the how media is today and what media is it's a middle ground so that's what media is media is a plural word of medium and medium is the singular word and it means in the middle media means it's it's a mass dissemination of information and media could be um news it could be through articles it could be through books it could be through social media through broadcasting through radio through TV through your phones there is a a great dissemination of information and and and we we known through history we like I was reading or I was um I list I saw a uh documentary of Hitler and how he used propaganda how he used the media so that he can what he does is form or shape the thoughts of the people to the point where where people will begin to think a certain way and I'm not saying like oh well CNN is like this or Fox News all of them they're all like that they all have an agenda and there could be a source that happens there could be a situation that happens and each media is going to depict that information the way they want to depict it and give it to the people that want that kind of media and whenever they receive it they are formed and they're shaped by that media not only that but that's news media but there's social media also where where the media is is uh the medium between the the content creators and the audience and and they're receiving all of those things and it shapes Our Lives shapes the way we think because we were created to receive media we were created to receive words so that whenever we receive a word and we believe in in that word we become that word we become that very thing and that's why you see all the chaos in the world because there's a mass dissemination of media Mass U uh flood of information not only to the old people but to our youth there's just so much information going through it and it shapes the people today to the point where uh the great one of the greatest examples was Hitler changing the minds of the people to hate a certain group of people and we see it today um if if I could say that America is probably the worst or the one that uses media the most because we have it in our constitution of the freedom of press that so um even though it's it's messed up or it's it's right they're going to they're going to give it to the people and most media Outlets they're tied to a shareholder they're tied to these multi-billionaires that want a certain narrative right I'm not here to talk about that but I just want to for us to understand that there is a media going on but the one who started created media was God he was the one because media is the middle ground it media has the power to control information it takes the information from the source and it can control it it could either uh uh clarify it could distort it could pervert or it could safeguard that information and give it to the person that is hearing and and the Bible says in John 1:1 in the beginning was the word that is Media that is a word and in the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and we know that God he says I don't change my word doesn't change I am my own word brother bam says a man is as good as his word so you want to see how good or or who that man is well look at his word look at what what he says look at his promises and that's who that person is and God says I am my word so whatever I say that's what my word says or whoever I am that's what my word is and and brother brandham cuz you you know I really love the gospels and I love how brother brandom revealed that those gospels they were tied to those four living creatures and you had the the the the lion with Matthew he he depicted him as a king all the the way down through his lineage and the way he he showed him that as the son of David the lineage of David he was the king he was the lion of Judah Mark he depicted him as the ultimate sacrifice Luke he depicted him as uh the one that was all the way from Adam he had the chronology all the way from Adam and he depicted him that way not only that but Luke was a very intelligent man he was a teacher but John which the Bible says and and brother Bram says that we have that anointing which was an eagle anointing he didn't go all the way to David or Abraham he didn't go all the way to Adam like Luke did but when he looked he had an anointing and he said in the beginning was the word he didn't Only See Jesus as a man that was that was going to inherit all things but he saw him as the very beginning of all things he was the word he was but but what I love about brother brandham is brother brandham said one simple thing he said a thought is a word expressed or or a word is a thought expressed and and that simple phrase brother brandham goes Plumb into eternity because John says the beginning started with the word but but then the thought was there before the beginning and that is the information God had he had you and I in his mind he had us in his thoughts the God says to to job he says where were you where were you when all the saints of God were already there shouting and worshiping so we were thoughts in God's mind now I don't want to get into this but I'll just say a little bit but God doesn't think in words he thought in images so just like all of us that's what we do I've done this before but if you everybody would like to close their eyes real quick and I want you guys to picture um that you're in a forest and you see a cabin you go into that cabin and and you see an empty cabin but with a table in there and on that table is a red apple okay you can open your eyes so who who pictured words who thought of words a p p Le or who saw images who actually saw themselves going into that place that's what God thinks so when God had all that information he had us in his mind and his mind and his thoughts are more of a reality than our reality that we see today it was eternity and and God thought and he thought and he thought for eternity I we can't even explain it but as he thought what started everything was whenever he put that thought into the media into that middle ground into a messenger called the word and whenever he spoke the word came out and things began to happen somebody received it God says that my words will not return to me void so that those words are like Messengers those words will go and in in Isaiah 55 I believe 89 and 10 he says that his words go like the rain and they'll fall to the ground and it brings forth the fruit of the ground and he and not only that but he said that it will go it will not be void but it'll come back and it will prosper that is God's word and whenever we receive God's word something happens within us we are that ground we are that receiver to receive that word and whenever we receive that word it's within us and and here in the Scripture it says that with your heart you believe unto righteousness that's you receiving the word that's you receiving what God Said but now un with thy confession salvation is made whenever we think of salv or confession we we confess our faults we confess to one another we confess that we're no good we confess that we're we're who knows what we confess right but that's usually where confession is associated with is Lord I'm going to confess to you again that I I messed up but this this is not talking about that kind of confession this word is actually a word it's it's called homio and it's uh comprised of two words homo means the same loio means what loio means to say so what what it's saying is to say the same thing that is confession to say the same thing and loio that's actually a noun the verb of it is the word that we know logos so it's not only just to say the same thing but it's saying what God says it's to speak the word so now we become a form of media we become a form of media to speak the word because what does it say it says with confession salvation is made to speak the word you bring your own salvation by believing that Jesus Christ died on the cross and he rose up and then you confess it you speak the word and it says salvation is made not only salvation but Perfection is made everything we confess and everything we say it it has life to it something comes comes comes in and it goes out there there's a spirit that goes out actually brother brandham he says that in in uh the word became flesh the Indian uh India trip report preached in 1954 he says and they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God and when the human element goes out the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you were EMP where you empty yourself amen then when the church in its power of resurrection of the Lord Jesus walk in his steps so there's something that happens we we we begin to walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean congregation says amen then your thoughts become words and your words become material that's when the church is in its power is whenever you receive that word and then you begin to confess that word the thing is the thing is whenever we receive too much of that other media right then what do we do the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he whatever we receive into this Soul because that that's where the battle is there's a battle for our soul today there's a battle for control today and the devil what he the B brother Bram says the devil is almost harmless if he doesn't have something to dwell into right so what is he doing he's trying to get into to that Soul trying to get there why because once he can get into the soul then now he can move the conscience where he wants to move it he can move your memories he can move your affections he can move your five outer senses by controlling that Soul that's what he wants but I like how brother brandham says he says he's almost harmless because his greatest power is deception the Bible says he he's the father of Lies he he he's an accuser that's these are all things that doesn't even require a touch from somebody he doesn't even need to make contact all he needs to do is give allow or have somebody to allow him to speak in their ear that's all and that's where his power lies whenever we go and we listen to that information that messenger that Medium when we listen to that and we begin to listen we listen Maybe it goes down to our outer senses to our inner senses all the way down until he's got that person why because he is the master manipulator he is the power or he he is the Bible says he is the prince of the power of the air I've heard a brother I forgot what his name was but he started speaking about dimensions and he spoke about um the fourth dimension and how that he was talking about The Ether I don't know too much about The Ether but he talked about radio waves and Airwaves and and and how the social media wifi radio everything goes through those waves and I truly believe that's what the devil uses he uses that form of communication actually brother brandham he said that that Satan and his army he went to Hollywood and he begin to to uh he be to um what do you call it um to influence the whole nation by that one spot how did he say it he said through television he said through television he begin to use his own propaganda if he wants his own message he' begin to influence the way people dress the way people act the way people talk look at how everybody is and it started there in Hollywood he said there was an influence brother bam he said that God created the airwaves but Satan perverted him and he went and he he influenced every social media every television every phone everything so that he could bring his information his media his propaganda he's been doing that Donald Trump doesn't have nothing on saying Camala Harris she doesn't have nothing all those people all that media doesn't have nothing on what Satan has been trying to do from the beginning Satan how did he control the whole world how did he get everybody to vote for him how did he get Eve to to he went over there and he said well is that what God said well God said this God yeah but and what did she do she opened to the media the womb of her mind and she began to listen and brother bam says before she committed adultery she committed adultery with her mind first spiritual meaning before we even confess we have to believe First with the heart you confess or or or with a heart you believe unto righteousness and with the mouth you confess unto salvation well there's the opposite there where with the heart you begin to believe a lie until one of these days you're walking in that lie the lie that Satan told the lie that that he gives the propaganda the the things that he wants that he's done that all the way to heaven you know I people might disagree but but maybe that war was a political war because because we think about wars and we think about artillery we think about tanks we think about uh swords but we're flesh we're trying to hurt our flesh these were spiritual supernatural beings and and the Bible says that he drew with his tail the stars of God brother bam said it was the tale he told it it was the propaganda he told it was the media it was the word that he said trying to disprove everything that God was and is but Brothers God is his own word as much as as the LIE how good it is the word will always stand true and whenever somebody receives that word within their heart then they confess unto salvation and what's beautiful is I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord I I I believed in him I was 18 years old and I gave my heart to the Lord and I I I I cried to my brother's um living room I got up and I said from this day on I'm going to give my heart to the Lord Lord and it was it's hard but I gave my heart to the Lord but when I got up my clothes didn't automatically change the the bald head that I had didn't grow so that I can look a little more uh presentable the Cortez that I was wearing I didn't change to nice uh whatever nice shoes my My Confession was before the the change so I can believe in my heart and I confessed but yet my whole body had to catch up to my confession my whole body had to change and and it was catching up I just didn't have the finances to change yet and a lot of times when you give your heart to the Lord something begins to change within you it's not something that you have to push and have to pull you don't have to try to make yourself a Christian you don't have we don't have to try to drag ourselves to church every single day look like a Christian yet our confession and our belief isn't isn't there brother brandham says um you shouldn't live higher than your confession you shouldn't live higher than your confession because your confession is showing what you believe and your confession will always change see when I gave my heart to the Lord I was able to say Lord I'm unworthy I'm a worm Lord I'm a sinner I'm worthy to go to hell and you know what happened I wasn't saying what I felt I was saying what his word was saying your word says I'm destined for hell because of the way I'm living because because I've been living outside that's your word Lord but then whenever I confess I'm changed changed something happens where I change then whenever that happens your confession has to change with it with your life and sometimes it's easy for us to beat ourselves down every single day it's easy to say Lord I'm unworthy I'm such a dummy I'm this I'm that what is it your confession isn't in sync with your life because as the more you you you change the different confession or the word has to change your word has to change I believe that's that's where that that spoken word is spoken word isn't just an enthusiasm and and saying whatever but it there's a life that goes first there's something that happens within the heart there's a believing within the heart and when that that happens the confession or the words you speak changed I believe that's what happened to brother brandham to the point where he his his life and his confession were so much in sync that he began to speak to squirrels into existence speak to the storm speak salvation and brothers and sisters even young people if you feel like you haven't given your heart to the Lord if you feel like you come to church but yet you haven't made that step yet it says that you believe in your heart that Jesus did something for you yes Jesus died for me yeah I'm I'm a knucklehead sometimes I I I don't listen or I'm perfect but I know I'm not right with the Lord yet I don't have a relationship with him but then you begin to believe and then you confess with your mouth and it says out of your mouth salvation takes place you speak your own salvation by the words you say salvation comes by your own confession salvation comes and every time you ascend it's because you're speaking what he says I remember Jesus people started accusing him because he he said he was God he said all the things you're saying are you making yourself God you you say that you're God Jesus didn't saywell I believe I am he didn't say what he believed confession isn't what you feel confession isn't what you believe or or what you what what you think you are confession is you say what he says he turned to them and he says it is written that I said that ye are Gods then why do you condemn me that I say that I am the Son of God what was it he was speaking the word even though people got mad even though they thought he was elevating himself he wasn't he was just speaking what God has confirmed with him that's what I love about Jesus because Jesus is the ultimate media it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh so now you have that media you have that word walking around you have him walking around and when you receive it you become that that's what's amazing about that so it's not how you feel but it's what you say that you believe brother Brenham says accept God's Gift he says now when you believe you were saved setting in your seat out wherever you was you accepted it and begin to confess it and tell people tell people you were saved well you kept on saying I'm saved when you believe it when you know God said did something for you believe it you don't need this great thing you don't need to say well does he need to come down the word is already there with you he says you you you say I'm saved the people saying ah there ain't no difference in you but you believe there was is that that right and when you kept your confession and after a while it worked righteousness all your neighbors and everybody knows you're saved now because you believed it you confessed it why what happened what changed you he is the high priest of your confession sitting on the right hand of the father making good what you're confessing now that's the same thing by healing you accept it you accept him as your healer renounce your feelings it's not by your feelings it's by faith say you're healed believe you're healed act like you're healed associate with those who believe in healing and God will bring you right out to a perfect soundness of hell it health it will not fail you have to say I believe and then just walk in it it's it's not telling people how you feel you you actually release something there's a releasing of of a spirit right there's a messenger and and there's a scripture where Jesus says my words are spirit and their life so words even the devil's words even the Serpent's words that was speaking to to Eve there was a spirit behind those words so whenever Jesus spoke a spirit would go and brother Bram actually said that the spirit quickens the word there's the word and the spirit are one and it goes and it enters into the heart and changes somebody that's why Brothers we have to watch what we confess we have to watch out the things that we say about our family about ourselves what do you think about yourself what do you think about certain situations because what you think is what you're going to say and then something goes out I I've said this before I think too many times but brother brandham when he was Discerning a woman he and this is in the video she comes up and and he's praying for her and he said okay go on your way and she begins to walk out he said wait hold on wait he said uh there's a dark shadow over you there's a dark shadow Shadow over you and usually when those Dark Shadows would go over it was because somebody had cancer or had some kind of disease but he said it's a lie it your pastor he oh he's accusing you of being a witch and and because he accused her you you know that saying sticks and stones may hurt my bones but words will never hurt me it said that there was a spirit spirit because of a lie and that that Spirit was tormenting her because he said you're a witch and he probably convinced everybody that she was a witch when she wasn't one but because of the words they spoke Spirit went out the Bible says death and life are at the power of the tongue death and life are at the power of the tongue we can Speak Life or we can speak death but we speak according to what's inside of us amen we speak according to what we believe and as the bride she goes higher and higher and higher her confession has to change the words that she speaks until there's life being spoken out to everybody why because the change there's a change within the heart first and and how does that Heart Change change is by what we intake in our lives the things that we intake I I don't know if you've ever I remember when I was working for insurance I would uh have to drive people around i' had a little team there and this is poor lady that she would just she had just such a hard life or seemed like it she would just tell me tell us all about it and um by the time I was done you know driving everybody around and and show sh everybody I was so tired I felt like I I just did like 20 hours of Labor because they were just dumping all their media see a media with God the information is in their thoughts and the only way to get that thought out is to express it and then there has to be a he says my word will not return to me void there has to be a receiver to receive it and when you receive it if it's God's word life comes out if it's negative she's just giving me a piece of her mind she's giving me a piece of her her thoughts and her information and her life and she gives it to me and man I'm they're like oh my goodness I'm why because she she just unloaded all of the spirits that she's gone through in 30 years she unloaded it on a poor person on a poor victim what are we saying yeah what do we say do we speak Words of Life do we speak words o of of healing do we speak positive now this is not positive thinking and and all of those this is the word it doesn't matter about positive thinking if you take the word you become the word and not only that you don't only become that word but you begin to speak out that word you begin to say what he says praise God for that I remember David in closing I'm I know I'm really U short with my messages but I remember David whenever he was going to go up to d uh to Goliath and Goliath of course he sees this little run this little Ruddy kid and he says really you're going to disrespect me like this you're going to give me the a little raisin and what did David begin to do he begin to declare his victory before it even started see I had it the wrong way I usually declare and I worship L the Lord whenever the victory has already taken place I said Lord that was hard but thank you Father thank you for taking me through this and take thank you for taking me through that but David's like I'm going to chop your head off and and and the crows they're going to be eating off of your carcass he said what why he be to declare because he already knew what God already did for him amen he already knew that God did it through the bear and through the lion and so he began to confess and declare his victory before it even happened that's us today before you go out of that trial before you you receive what you need to receive you begin to confess it and you walk in it and people might say ah you're still talking about that ah you're still walking in that I don't care God said it I believe it it's going to happen not because I feel good not because it doesn't matter how I feel it matters what he said and I I am a fertile ground that's what we were made for we were made to receive God's word and eternal life be brought forth out of us we are the kingdom of God the kingdom of God cannot touch the Earth until it touches your soul the kingdom of God cannot be preached out to the people until it touches you and then you are that media you are that one that's going to speak out the word and you're not going to distort it like the devil you're not going to pervert it you are going to speak what he says cuz that is True Confession say what he says let us stand to our feet
