[0:01] first timothy chapter two is where we'd
[0:02] like to read first timothy chapter two
[0:05] and read verses one to eight
[0:10] first timothy chapter two start with
[0:12] verse one
[0:14] and we'll read to verse eight we'll
[0:15] continue on the bride's advocacy
[0:17] i've included these scriptures in the
[0:19] slides brother john if you want to use
[0:20] these
[0:21] because i'm
[0:23] kind of admitting right now
[0:25] that i'm not gonna have time to get to
[0:26] my text
[0:27] and but i feel that it kind of forms the
[0:31] uh inspiration
[0:34] for the
[0:35] the particulars that we're going to be
[0:37] looking at
[0:38] and so if you don't have your bibles or
[0:40] if it makes it a little bit easier maybe
[0:41] to read it from the screen
[0:43] i want to be sure that we focus in
[0:45] together on these statements that paul
[0:47] is making
[0:48] as he writes to timothy in my bible the
[0:50] heading is prayers for all men
[0:53] and it says i exhort therefore that
[0:55] first of all supplications prayers
[0:58] intercessions and giving of thanks be
[1:00] made for all men that remarkable
[1:03] he said this is first of all for kings
[1:06] and for all that are in authority
[1:09] that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
[1:12] life in all godliness and honesty
[1:15] paul is telling the church to pray for
[1:19] kings and those that are authority
[1:20] presidents prime ministers congressmen
[1:22] senators governors
[1:24] mayors pray for them and that prayer is
[1:26] the means by which that we can effect
[1:29] change that as christians we can lead a
[1:32] quiet and peaceable life
[1:34] that's that's our first duty that pray
[1:36] for president biden right pray for him
[1:38] that
[1:39] play for the democratic senators and and
[1:41] the legislators that they would that we
[1:44] might be able to live peaceably as
[1:45] christians like that's that's our first
[1:47] course recourse that's our first and
[1:49] primary duty as christians and so he
[1:51] says for this is good and acceptable in
[1:54] the sight of god our savior what is
[1:56] praying for these things prayers
[1:57] supplications intercessions for all men
[2:00] specifically for kings and those that
[2:02] are in authority that the christian the
[2:04] believer can lead a quiet and peaceful
[2:06] life in all godliness and honesty
[2:09] then he says in verse 4 who will have
[2:11] all men this is speaking of god
[2:14] who will have all men to be saved and to
[2:16] come unto the knowledge of the truth
[2:18] for there is one god and one mediator
[2:20] between god and men the man christ jesus
[2:23] who gave himself a ransom for all to be
[2:25] testified in due time
[2:27] whereunto i am ordained a preacher and
[2:30] an apostle i speak the truth in christ
[2:32] and lie not a teacher of the gentiles in
[2:35] faith and verity
[2:37] i will therefore that men
[2:39] pray everywhere
[2:41] lifting up holy hands without wrath
[2:43] wrath and doubting
[2:45] these are these are powerful
[2:47] precepts these are very important things
[2:49] for us to consider as believers as paul
[2:51] is giving this instruction and then it's
[2:53] remarkable how he immediately goes into
[2:55] how a woman ought to adorn herself the
[2:56] behavior she should have qualifications
[2:59] for pastors qualifications for deacons
[3:01] warnings of false teachers and then how
[3:03] that we ought to uh be an example of the
[3:06] believer continues on how we ought to
[3:08] make provisions for widows and councils
[3:09] the younger
[3:11] to give honor to elders to honor your
[3:13] masters comes into the root of all evil
[3:15] and it's like it's out this outflow
[3:18] from this very things he's telling
[3:20] timothy that these are the things that
[3:22] we ought to hold true dear to our hearts
[3:24] and exhort that we pray for all men pray
[3:26] for those that are in authority and this
[3:28] is good and acceptable in the sight of
[3:30] the lord and he expresses these things
[3:32] and right in this conjunction of all
[3:34] this is we have one media between god
[3:36] and men he says this is what i'm
[3:37] pointing to this is the salvation for
[3:40] all men as jesus christ let's pray our
[3:42] heavenly father thank you for your
[3:43] presence which we
[3:45] feel already in this place we know that
[3:47] you are near
[3:48] and father i know from my vantage point
[3:50] as the one who is
[3:52] tasked with the burden of preparation
[3:54] for this service i see how you've dealt
[3:56] with my heart
[3:58] over a very long period of time
[4:00] i see how the devil tries to attack
[4:02] these things but father i pray that you
[4:04] would have the preeminence and may there
[4:06] be a
[4:07] a spirit
[4:09] of clarity in our hearts that we don't
[4:11] muddy things up with our own personal
[4:13] opinions may myself lord may i be
[4:15] withheld restrained by the holy ghost to
[4:17] not inject
[4:19] any carnality into this but that we
[4:21] might stay very faithful to your heart
[4:23] may that be conveyed lord pray that you
[4:25] amplify these things which we have
[4:26] already read that it might form kind of
[4:28] the basis for the things that we're
[4:30] going to minister tonight as i believe
[4:32] there's something important for us to
[4:33] catch
[4:34] bless your people now bless the word
[4:36] which we have read in the name of the
[4:37] lord jesus christ we ask this amen
[4:40] you can be seated we continue on the
[4:43] bride's advocacy
[4:44] and
[4:47] i asked brother michael for to give me
[4:49] kind of get me up a little bit early and
[4:51] i think that um he probably would have
[4:53] had me up about this time anyways
[4:55] because you guys very quickly got into
[4:57] the channel
[4:58] uh from my vantage point i'll say this
[5:00] you don't necessarily have to agree with
[5:02] me so in the end you may say well that
[5:03] wasn't really profound and i would
[5:05] accept that but for me what i want to
[5:07] share tonight i believe is going to be
[5:08] really eye-opening that there's some
[5:10] eye-opening things in this
[5:12] and
[5:13] i so if i if you could and i know just
[5:15] as uh as we do on wednesday nights maybe
[5:18] we feel a little bit more comfortable a
[5:20] little bit smaller crowd
[5:22] i trust that you can be very very
[5:23] focused and kind of stay with me because
[5:26] there might be certain things that i say
[5:28] and then as soon as i say it you might
[5:30] you might try to force that in a
[5:31] particular paradigm that you're used to
[5:32] it being dealt with or it might kind of
[5:34] conjure up certain ideas and what i want
[5:37] you to do is just really labor to catch
[5:39] the mind of god now i'm not even trying
[5:41] to figure out what my opinion is or what
[5:42] my take is but really just try to catch
[5:44] the mind of god on these things uh
[5:47] someone mentioned to me the other that
[5:48] when i had the slide up last week of the
[5:50] we believe in
[5:52] that first slide that we used that
[5:53] people started getting nervous and i
[5:55] don't mind if people get nervous because
[5:57] that means they're at least paying
[5:58] attention to the subject matter
[6:01] and uh but i wouldn't want you to get
[6:03] nervous on any of these things but i i
[6:06] would hope
[6:07] that we could open up our hearts for the
[6:09] lord to correct us to kind of balance us
[6:11] to smooth this out to make us a little
[6:12] bit more razor sharp
[6:14] there's a quote that i often and i don't
[6:16] i might still have it here i cleaned out
[6:18] my notebook the other day and um
[6:20] maybe left some a quote i often carried
[6:22] to the pulpit that brother branham
[6:25] makes this statement that a pastor
[6:27] must always be looking for things
[6:30] and and follow the holy spirit to catch
[6:32] things even in their infancy to block
[6:33] the people's minds from certain things
[6:36] and some of the things i i feel
[6:37] impressed to speak on tonight i would
[6:39] say these things
[6:40] i'm not a paul revere saying they're
[6:42] coming they're coming they're already
[6:43] here and maybe we just need to be able
[6:45] to appreciate
[6:47] some of the context within the word so
[6:48] i'm going to give some
[6:50] try to go very quickly on foundation
[6:53] just catching up some of the things from
[6:54] the last three services
[6:56] and make reference to revelations 22 17
[6:59] according to revelations 22 17 the
[7:01] spirit and the bride say come according
[7:03] to revelations 10 uh verse 11 uh there
[7:07] is a thou must prophesy again and do
[7:09] many uh unto the unto the world and
[7:11] these scriptures tell us that we have a
[7:13] public ministry and this public ministry
[7:15] is advocacy that's public
[7:18] active support for a particular cause
[7:20] this is public support and it's active
[7:22] support so it can't just be a belief
[7:24] that you hold in your hearts it has to
[7:25] be something public and it has to be
[7:27] active
[7:28] and when the scripture says thou must
[7:30] prophesy again which we see in type of
[7:33] the bride it means to plead it speaks of
[7:35] pleading the cause of god this phrase
[7:38] this word is used of those that would
[7:39] plead the cause of god and then urge
[7:41] others to be saved so this is cont this
[7:44] is contained in this thou must prophesy
[7:47] again that we readily accept to be the
[7:49] bride john being a type of the bride in
[7:51] this instance that there is this um
[7:54] pleading the cause of god that must
[7:56] prophesy again and it's uh
[7:58] uh and even joining that with
[8:00] revelations 22 17 our words the things
[8:03] we say and our actions the life we live
[8:05] they say come
[8:07] it's declaring come to many peoples
[8:09] nations tongues and kings and so we are
[8:13] identifying how that we are the final
[8:15] voice of god in the last days
[8:17] this is our calling this is our
[8:19] commission and therefore as the final
[8:21] voice we must advocate for christ
[8:24] not for ourselves not not for um some
[8:26] sort of one particular cause but we
[8:28] advocate for christ so in looking at
[8:31] ourselves as advocates for christ it's
[8:33] not self-promotion
[8:35] so you're you're not looking to
[8:37] vindicate that you're right you're not
[8:38] looking to find substantiate what you
[8:41] believe or prove that you've had things
[8:42] figured out so it's not self-promotion
[8:44] it's not the promotion of any particular
[8:45] personality and it's not the promotion
[8:48] of a church
[8:49] advocacy for christ is not the promotion
[8:52] of a particular church and because we
[8:53] can we could really confuse those
[8:55] matters because if if advocating for
[8:57] christ means that we we were promoting a
[8:59] particular church then it probably would
[9:02] mean that we would all have to advocate
[9:03] for the same church
[9:05] there would be a conflict dentist well
[9:07] i'm advocating for christ no what we
[9:09] what we do is uh i'm advocating for
[9:11] christ so i'm advocating for my church
[9:13] i'm advocating for a church what we do
[9:14] when we invite people to church we
[9:16] invite people to church so they can come
[9:17] and have an experience with the word
[9:20] not not so that they can uh take a place
[9:22] in a pew and not so that they can be
[9:24] identified uh among us or start giving
[9:26] and become a giving unit or that we can
[9:28] say that we've had a a one a soul to the
[9:30] lord but those those things uh winning a
[9:33] soul to lord there's something that we
[9:34] we're wrapped up in that there's
[9:36] certainly a reward in that but our
[9:37] objective is we invite people to church
[9:40] and we say come and see
[9:42] and we labor to see that we're creating
[9:43] the right atmosphere in the service we
[9:45] desire to have our own facility so we
[9:47] can make it just exactly like we want it
[9:50] and i believe that we ought to
[9:51] evangelize by inviting people to church
[9:53] but remember your goal in inviting
[9:55] people to church is to give a personal
[9:57] experience with the word and if that
[9:59] begins to happen then just watch god
[10:01] deal with that person's heart and and
[10:03] god may move in them and deal with them
[10:04] and you invite them to come to church
[10:06] and have a personal experience with the
[10:08] word and they're like man i've met god
[10:10] this is the truth i love the lord i want
[10:12] to serve them and you're like awesome
[10:14] this is great we've got we've got you
[10:16] know somebody else who's going to be
[10:17] coming to church now we get all excited
[10:18] like so i'm going to move back to where
[10:20] i came from i want to go back to my
[10:22] where i grew up i want to go back to my
[10:24] family and and i and i just want to
[10:26] that's how i'm feeling led and also we
[10:28] start getting all locked up like well
[10:29] wait a minute no i mean how could you do
[10:31] this have confidence in a word
[10:33] experience that if they genuinely had an
[10:35] experience with the word that god's
[10:37] going to deal with their heart
[10:39] and lead them and guide them so we're
[10:40] even we're not even promoting church
[10:43] in and of itself but we promote church
[10:45] because our church provides an
[10:46] opportunity to have an experience with
[10:48] the word
[10:50] now
[10:50] quickly i want to
[10:52] point out how we've been using paul as
[10:54] an example i think at least in the last
[10:56] two services and perhaps in the first
[10:58] service on the bride's advocacy
[11:00] how he was following the example of
[11:03] christ
[11:04] and that paul is saying i become all
[11:05] things to all men and i do things that
[11:08] please all men not that i would ever do
[11:10] something contrary to the word but i
[11:12] condescend myself to others for the sake
[11:15] of the word and some of the gospel for
[11:17] the gospel sake and he does it so that
[11:20] others might be saved
[11:22] and in that context he's he's saying
[11:24] this is my example this is my example he
[11:26] says you should follow my example that
[11:28] you conduct yourself in such a way to
[11:30] where at all times you can be a channel
[11:33] that god can use to impact someone's
[11:35] life for salvation and for the blessings
[11:38] of the gospel and he makes this
[11:40] statement in first corinthians 10 24 let
[11:43] no man seek his own as christ didn't do
[11:46] things for his own prophet seek his own
[11:48] will try to trump up himself he says let
[11:51] no man seek his own but every man
[11:53] another's wealth
[11:55] now i know in reading that it might seem
[11:57] let no man seek after his own riches but
[11:59] look at seek after another man's riches
[12:01] like i'm trying to get a little bit of
[12:03] yours let me borrow some money but
[12:05] rather it speaks of a man's welfare you
[12:07] should seek after look out after or be
[12:09] concerned about another's welfare and in
[12:12] the context is paul is putting be
[12:14] concerned about their soul
[12:16] maybe not so much concerned about their
[12:17] diet so much concerned about their
[12:19] financial well-being but very at the end
[12:20] of the day being more concerned about
[12:22] their soul and we express this many
[12:25] times when we have a loved one who is
[12:26] sick and we say we're praying that god
[12:28] would heal them they're facing a very
[12:29] difficult surgery they have stage four
[12:31] cancer and we say we're praying that god
[12:33] would heal them more importantly that
[12:34] their eyes would be open to the lord and
[12:36] we're and we're right in that because
[12:38] ultimately we would have a peace knowing
[12:40] that an unsaved loved one even though
[12:42] they died with cancer prior to them
[12:45] dying they had a genuine experience with
[12:47] the lord
[12:48] and they found salvation so paul is
[12:50] saying that we should be concerned about
[12:52] others
[12:53] other souls
[12:54] and we
[12:56] and maybe i'm trying to
[12:58] think of way that we could capture these
[12:59] things how he was
[13:01] we're being exhorted in the word of god
[13:03] to consider what we say and how we live
[13:06] and
[13:06] uh and moderate our conduct and our
[13:09] behavior and even our words in light of
[13:11] how
[13:12] our actions and our words may hinder
[13:14] someone in coming to christ
[13:17] and then even in the way that we can
[13:18] moderate our behavior and our words to
[13:20] help someone come to christ
[13:22] so we're not just merely living a
[13:24] particular way because the word says so
[13:25] but the word actually has the right kind
[13:27] of way to be the right kind of light
[13:29] and if you ponder even what the purpose
[13:31] of fruit is in terms of why is there
[13:35] this nice flesh and this edible flesh
[13:37] that
[13:38] surrounds a seed
[13:40] it's not so much so that the birds and
[13:42] the animals and different ones can enjoy
[13:44] the fruit but the fruit is what attracts
[13:47] the attention
[13:48] of one who's going to take that seed
[13:51] ultimately take the seed and allow it to
[13:53] propagate somewhere else because an
[13:56] animal or human is attracted to the
[13:58] fruit
[13:59] and they eat the fruit and the seed is
[14:00] left behind but what does it do it
[14:02] allows that seed to find ground away
[14:04] from the plant to to find root and to
[14:06] grow so the fruit of a christian
[14:09] isn't so that we can just declare to
[14:10] everybody that we're better and more
[14:12] holy but there ought to be something
[14:13] about the way we live that becomes an
[14:15] attraction to others and then when they
[14:17] want to partake of that fruit they're
[14:19] going to get the seed
[14:21] and there's a seed inside of them that's
[14:22] drawing them to that
[14:24] and the statement that really has been
[14:26] um
[14:27] very impactful to me has been this in
[14:29] the unveiling of god speaking of jesus
[14:32] christ he says he died to reveal himself
[14:34] to us
[14:35] now let us die to self to reveal him to
[14:37] others
[14:38] let us die to the traditions and things
[14:40] that's there's a lot that's meant in
[14:42] that let us die to traditions let us die
[14:44] to things to reveal him to others
[14:46] die to the the denominations
[14:49] to reveal him to others so we died of
[14:52] self we died of traditions we died in
[14:53] denominations we died of different
[14:54] things and the sake of this death is so
[14:57] that we can we can reveal him to others
[15:02] so we have an important part to play in
[15:04] the faith to faith and christ being made
[15:06] known by others
[15:08] and
[15:09] i'll say this i hadn't maybe pondered
[15:12] saying this but
[15:14] these services have been very impactful
[15:16] for me personally
[15:17] and there may be some apology necessary
[15:20] if you all have become the spectator in
[15:21] god dealing with my heart but even
[15:24] sunday i just felt like god just really
[15:26] exposed something in my personal life
[15:29] that i have to a large extent it's easy
[15:31] for me to get distracted by those that
[15:33] are distracted
[15:34] and you see everybody distracted by
[15:36] something and i'm over here can you
[15:37] believe all these people who are
[15:38] distracted
[15:39] can you believe all these people being
[15:40] distracted and it really convicted me to
[15:42] realize that
[15:44] there's a point at which identifying
[15:46] those people who are distracted
[15:48] can become a distraction in itself and
[15:50] that you've got to come back to
[15:52] the real kernel of truth to come back to
[15:55] christ being what is the focus christ
[15:57] being the center and i just feel in my
[15:59] heart this afternoon i thought this
[16:01] message is more precious to me than it's
[16:02] ever been it's more relevant to me than
[16:04] it's ever been it's so perfectly
[16:07] identifies every weakness in laodicea
[16:09] and gives us an answer for it
[16:12] and so as it's already maybe been
[16:15] sensed my part of what has been god has
[16:18] been dealing with me on and something
[16:19] that i've been studying for quite some
[16:21] time and it's been it's formed kind of a
[16:23] little bit of a thrust in the the
[16:25] direction of the bride's advocacy
[16:27] is there is a caution if there's a
[16:29] caution against political activism
[16:32] i want you to ponder that a little bit
[16:34] or a conflict against conflating
[16:36] political causes with the cause of
[16:38] christ or confusing maybe i could use
[16:40] that word that i want us to be very
[16:43] careful about becoming political
[16:44] activist
[16:45] and be very careful that we don't
[16:47] confuse
[16:48] certain political causes
[16:51] as being synonymous with or in harmony
[16:53] with the cause of christ so there's a
[16:56] way that it can be something can be
[16:57] presented to us and we're like oh well
[16:59] that's what christ would say or that's
[17:01] what christ would advocate for so we
[17:03] kind of we sign the dotted line and we
[17:05] join in some particular movement because
[17:07] we see that it seems to further some
[17:09] sort of christian ideal we need to be
[17:11] very very careful with that
[17:13] and i want to use the example tonight of
[17:16] how the political advocacy and political
[17:19] activism and since i see them as in some
[17:21] ways being synonymous has taken over the
[17:23] evangelical world anybody heard the term
[17:26] evangelical it's taken over the
[17:28] evangelical world in a lot of ways
[17:30] christianity and the protestants
[17:34] and so this is gonna give some
[17:36] definitions maybe just to help myself
[17:37] out but also to know that we're on the
[17:39] same page and what we're looking at to
[17:40] be inves evangelical means of or
[17:43] according to the teaching of the gospel
[17:46] or of according to the christian
[17:47] religion so if something is evangelical
[17:50] then it pertains to the christian
[17:51] religion it's not going to be pertaining
[17:53] to hinduism or or islam it pertains to
[17:57] the christian religion more particularly
[17:59] it's something that's of the gospel or
[18:01] it's a teaching
[18:03] according to the teaching of the gospel
[18:06] so there is kind of a branch of product
[18:09] the protestant religion or christian
[18:11] religion or protestant
[18:13] the protestant churches that would be
[18:14] considered evangelical
[18:16] so in looking at evangelicalism
[18:20] i was able to and people use this
[18:22] terminology so it's very precise to be
[18:24] able to kind of come up with certain
[18:25] things that are the the main tenets of
[18:27] what how you'd be identified as an
[18:29] evangelical there's kind of like the
[18:31] mainstream
[18:32] uh protestants
[18:34] very traditional beliefs and different
[18:35] things but with evangelicals they seem
[18:38] to be more clear in what they believe
[18:40] and more ardent about certain things
[18:42] and so they believe the bible is without
[18:44] air i think the terminology of the use
[18:46] of the bible isn't inerrant and so this
[18:48] is something that maybe
[18:50] uh even some modern churches or maine
[18:54] mainstream protestants would would look
[18:56] at the book of the bible as being the
[18:58] the god's word but yet uh maybe more
[19:00] informative as an allegory or something
[19:03] that we can use as a moral code whereas
[19:05] evangelicals would say the bible is the
[19:07] word of god it was without error
[19:09] secondly they would believe that
[19:10] salvation is only through christ there's
[19:13] no other salvation except through jesus
[19:14] christ
[19:16] and then number three that salvation is
[19:18] by a personal born-again experience that
[19:21] an individual must be converted and they
[19:23] have to have an experience of being born
[19:25] again and terminologies can vary among
[19:27] different evangelicals but in general
[19:30] they believe that there is a individual
[19:32] personal conversion and then number four
[19:34] may be the most outstanding aspect of
[19:36] all this they believe the bible is
[19:38] inerrant they believe it's without air
[19:39] they believe salvation is only through
[19:40] christ you must be born again
[19:42] individually and personally and then
[19:43] number four spread these beliefs
[19:46] to evangelize and that's kind of what
[19:49] kind of gives us in this terminology of
[19:51] being evangelical is that you you should
[19:53] be advocating for these truth the bible
[19:55] is perfect there's only salvation
[19:57] through jesus christ and you as an
[19:59] individual must recognize yourself a
[20:00] sinner and you must be converted you
[20:02] must have a born-again experience so
[20:04] those are just some general things that
[20:06] would identify
[20:07] evangelicalism now slow down when i say
[20:09] that because it'd be very very easy to
[20:11] slip into some sort of lisp and get you
[20:13] all laughing at me
[20:15] now in general i don't think any of us
[20:17] would object to that
[20:18] right if somebody would just if we found
[20:20] this you know written on a piece of
[20:21] paper we could say ah i can see that a
[20:23] word i can see that the word i can see
[20:24] that in the word and even brother
[20:25] branham uses the phrase evangelical
[20:28] um in his ministry a number of times and
[20:30] he identified even the full gospel
[20:33] businessmen's meetings as being
[20:34] inter-evangelical and how they were kind
[20:36] of interdenominational they didn't look
[20:38] upon any denominational lines but they
[20:40] held these certain truths together and
[20:41] they believed in these certain things
[20:43] and they came upon they came together on
[20:45] that basis
[20:46] and when he preaches shalom in january
[20:48] of
[20:49] 1964 he says my doctrine i don't preach
[20:52] doctrine out here nothing but just great
[20:54] evangelical fundamentals
[20:57] because i'm with brethren that might
[20:58] different with me and i i don't give
[21:00] that his doctrine out before the people
[21:02] here and it's being very deliberate to
[21:04] say there's things that i would preach
[21:06] at home and things about the seals and
[21:08] things about different those things that
[21:10] he might not preach in these types of
[21:11] meetings he says i just try to stay on
[21:13] the real fundamentals of the scripture
[21:15] such as what we believe
[21:17] and what he's identifying is kind of the
[21:20] pure the pure idea of being evangelical
[21:22] that regardless of what denomination you
[21:24] were regardless of whether you're a
[21:26] pentecostal or methodist or baptist you
[21:28] could agree that the bible is the word
[21:30] of god you could agree that salvation is
[21:32] through jesus christ you could agree
[21:33] that there's a born-again experience
[21:35] whether that comes through the baptism
[21:36] of the holy ghost or merely by
[21:38] confession you could agree that we ought
[21:40] to as churches be preaching this gospel
[21:43] so he's kind of identifying what would
[21:45] be the pure
[21:47] uh evangelical fundamentals of the
[21:49] scripture
[21:51] yet
[21:52] the evangelicals is you can identify
[21:54] even when the message they were already
[21:56] beginning to take on different goals
[21:59] these things weren't necessarily the the
[22:00] pure motives of the evangelicals because
[22:02] at the turn of the 19th century
[22:05] evangelicalism
[22:08] was
[22:08] even christianity if i could say that in
[22:10] particular was becoming more patriotic
[22:14] more masculine and more political
[22:17] these are the things that begin to
[22:18] really emerge
[22:19] uh and i've just been doing my study in
[22:21] this and been looking into these things
[22:22] and trying to identify some of the
[22:24] source of these things and you realize
[22:25] that there are certain themes that begin
[22:27] to be predominate within christianity in
[22:29] america and within the evangelical
[22:32] movement that things are really tied to
[22:34] uh the nationalism and
[22:37] and and masculinity and became very very
[22:40] political and let me say this without
[22:43] getting into the history of that because
[22:45] i believe the message of the hour really
[22:46] begins to identify a lot of these things
[22:48] let me just say i feel that the change
[22:50] is complete
[22:51] that if there was a there was something
[22:53] that began to happen at the turn of the
[22:54] century before the century was over
[22:56] this movement had almost become purely
[22:58] political
[23:00] and now evangelical is more of a
[23:03] political label
[23:05] than it is a a label that would identify
[23:07] what brand of theology you have
[23:10] and this is um this is
[23:12] i think it's important for us to ponder
[23:13] this to be evangelical
[23:15] if you told somebody that you're
[23:16] evangelical anybody
[23:19] would probably begin to identify more
[23:21] political causes than they would think
[23:24] oh they believe the bible is the word of
[23:26] god they believe salvation is only
[23:27] through jesus christ and they believe
[23:28] you have to have a born-again experience
[23:30] they would think more in terms of
[23:31] activism
[23:33] and this has been something that's been
[23:34] taken place over many many decades to
[23:36] arrive to this point i think you could
[23:37] even go back to
[23:39] the or some of the early evangelists in
[23:40] the 1900s and a lot of different ways
[23:43] movements were starting and even youth
[23:45] for christ and these different things
[23:47] took on certain tones and began to try
[23:49] to support certain things and and
[23:51] moderate certain policies but i feel
[23:52] that there was this transition
[23:55] and let's just all admit it now
[23:57] that
[23:58] mainstream christianity in america
[24:00] became untethered
[24:02] they lost their absolute they lost their
[24:03] way and so they move with political
[24:06] forces they move with the force of
[24:07] laodicea they move with the spirit of
[24:09] the age
[24:10] and so i'm i don't want you to get tense
[24:12] and think oh are you saying that we're a
[24:13] godless country and that you know
[24:15] there's nobody has been right instead of
[24:18] just hold very tight to what i'm trying
[24:19] to say but i do think there's things
[24:21] that we can agree on that we already
[24:23] believe that this just substantiates
[24:25] realize yes that's that's what's been
[24:27] happening in the church world today this
[24:29] is why so many people have such terrible
[24:31] experiences in churches anymore is it's
[24:34] no longer feeding the hunger for christ
[24:37] it's more dealing with these
[24:38] uniquenesses about our convictions and
[24:40] our thoughts and opinions on things
[24:42] and so this i want to use the example of
[24:46] jerry falwell
[24:48] our friend and brother jerry falwell
[24:51] who
[24:52] and i'm just going to kind of skip to
[24:53] the point he's not a friend uh so i
[24:55] don't want you to think all of a sudden
[24:56] we didn't know you were close to him
[24:58] but in 1979 how many have heard the name
[25:01] jerry falwell
[25:02] maybe not so much in our day and age but
[25:04] kind of a lightning rod for criticism
[25:06] really a bold speaker on certain issues
[25:09] he was a baptist and in
[25:11] 1979 after a very long time of uh
[25:16] having radio shows and and building that
[25:18] the
[25:19] church there in lynchburg virginia and
[25:21] then having this vision to have a school
[25:23] and establishing his education and
[25:25] things and a very large ministry he
[25:27] founded what was called the moral
[25:29] majority
[25:30] and that sounded very humble
[25:32] the moral majority
[25:34] and it's basically a right-wing
[25:35] political uh
[25:37] organization it was part of a right-wing
[25:38] political movement called the moral
[25:40] majority
[25:41] and so in studying this i found some
[25:43] excerpts that i thought would be kind of
[25:45] good to help summarize
[25:47] uh where i'm coming from are you
[25:49] comfortable tonight
[25:51] i feel very very comfortable my pace is
[25:52] going to be maybe a little bit different
[25:54] i'm going to be a little bit more
[25:55] deliberate but there's some things here
[25:56] i believe they're going to be
[25:57] eye-opening for you very helpful
[25:59] they said that falwell moved from a
[26:01] separatist stance
[26:02] that taught that god controls everything
[26:05] including politics
[26:07] to one that required human action to
[26:10] fulfill god's intended destiny for
[26:12] america
[26:14] so now the christian now has this
[26:16] conviction
[26:17] that god has a destiny for america and
[26:21] that as christians in america as
[26:23] americans and christians we have the
[26:26] duty to steer the direction of the
[26:29] government to impact government on all
[26:31] levels so that america fulfills its
[26:34] destiny as god's chosen nation of
[26:36] christendom
[26:38] and whereas before you might have had
[26:39] our founding fathers that wanted to
[26:41] create a separation of church and state
[26:44] so that church is a is a one has the
[26:47] liberty to serve god how they would want
[26:49] to serve god and you'd have this
[26:51] dichotomy between your religion and
[26:53] church and state and government would
[26:55] ideally be led by people who are
[26:58] exercising their freedom of religion and
[27:00] start worshiping the one true god and
[27:02] that would be the separate to stance
[27:04] that has this scriptural perspective
[27:06] that god is the one that puts people in
[27:08] power
[27:08] god is the one that works in the hit
[27:10] behind the curtain in these hidden
[27:12] springs that puts people in place and
[27:14] he's the one that's over all of it and i
[27:16] can do more than my civic duty and can't
[27:18] do any more than fulfill god's purpose
[27:20] for my life and pray for those who are
[27:22] in authority that i might lead a quiet
[27:25] and peaceable life as a christian
[27:28] and
[27:28] in all godliness and honesty but then
[27:32] this is just one example of christianity
[27:35] now in the evangelicals of the
[27:36] protestant religion moving into
[27:38] political activism and believing that
[27:40] human action was required
[27:42] so that america fulfills its destiny
[27:45] that god intends for them
[27:46] and this is another excerpt it says
[27:48] behind the idea of the moral majority
[27:51] was this notion this is the thought and
[27:53] the idea behind it that there could be a
[27:55] coalition
[27:57] of these different religious groups
[27:59] that all agree on abortion and
[28:01] homosexuality and other issues
[28:04] even if they never agreed on how to read
[28:06] the bible or the nature of god
[28:09] so they in terms of how to read the
[28:12] bible the nature of god scripture in
[28:14] particular is saying that there was this
[28:17] idea that as the moral majority we could
[28:20] kind of have this
[28:21] uh
[28:24] non-denominational interdenominational
[28:28] organization that's a political
[28:30] organization that
[28:32] creates a coalition of different
[28:33] religious groups
[28:35] that can identify these certain causes
[28:37] that they agree on
[28:40] and they may not agree on whether or not
[28:41] the bible's the word of god they may not
[28:43] even agree whether or not jesus christ
[28:45] is
[28:46] the salvation through him alone or even
[28:48] believe that there's a born-again
[28:49] experience
[28:50] but we can agree that we don't like
[28:53] abortion we don't like homosexuality we
[28:55] have these other issues that we all
[28:56] agree on and we kind of form this agenda
[28:59] of these agendas
[29:00] that we can all agree on regardless of
[29:02] what our differences are yeah we're
[29:03] never going to see eye to eye on jesus
[29:05] christ we're never going to see eye to
[29:06] eye on baptism we're never going to see
[29:07] eye to eye on the nature of god but we
[29:09] can agree on these things
[29:11] are you following me so far
[29:13] now i trust that you being seasoned
[29:15] believers and i look out in the
[29:16] congregation today and i see everyone
[29:17] who's well taught um solid believers i
[29:20] mean we're already hearing it that way
[29:21] we're kind of like well if you put it
[29:23] that way
[29:24] it's alarming isn't it
[29:26] and so these agendas still live
[29:30] and so now there's still kind of this
[29:32] simple agenda for the evangelicals and
[29:34] even though the moral majority kind of
[29:36] folded in the 80s it is almost as if it
[29:38] had reached this tipping point to where
[29:40] now there didn't necessarily need to be
[29:42] the moral majority it it
[29:44] politics had reached its tipping point
[29:46] for even this is what's remarkable
[29:48] i'm almost getting sidetracked pray for
[29:50] me
[29:51] jimmy carter was an evangelical he was a
[29:53] christian man
[29:55] and a decent person and the moral
[29:56] majority pushed ronald reagan a
[29:59] hollywood movie star
[30:01] to become president because the platform
[30:03] the politics of the party and and who
[30:06] they who they could steer in the
[30:07] direction they wanted things to go and
[30:09] so now you have this
[30:10] interdenominational right-wing political
[30:12] movement that endorses a candidate
[30:15] against someone who would have been more
[30:17] theologically aligned with christians
[30:20] in order to get the right politician in
[30:23] office to pass the legislation that
[30:25] christians would want on a national
[30:27] level and so it still holds true today
[30:29] where i actually heard it said one time
[30:31] when i was researching these things
[30:33] that evange
[30:34] to be an evangelical has more to do with
[30:37] getting a republican in office than it
[30:38] is to tell the story of christ
[30:42] i know you're thinking what does this
[30:43] have to do with the message just be
[30:44] patient with me you've lasted a year
[30:47] with me
[30:48] let's make it one more service at least
[30:52] there's kind of this simple agenda that
[30:53] it can be distilled down to
[30:55] are you are you staying are you with me
[30:57] right now i want from the youngest to
[30:58] the oldest i want i want maybe to be
[31:00] listening it's pro-life
[31:04] pro-traditional family
[31:06] pro-moral pro-israel pro-america
[31:10] so
[31:11] this is the voice of the moral majority
[31:14] this is the voice of the evangelicals
[31:16] this is the voice of the now politically
[31:18] motivated church because what is what
[31:20] does it ultimately end up in a union
[31:22] between
[31:23] church and state
[31:24] ecclesiastical
[31:26] and ecumenical this this joining
[31:28] together of church and state that's what
[31:30] it's going to head up in and so
[31:32] certainly these things are already
[31:33] transpiring right certainly things are
[31:35] already coming together on a particular
[31:36] level and so now you have a
[31:39] political platforms that begin to
[31:41] identify themselves as pro-life
[31:43] and these were hot button topics and
[31:45] decades gone by and they may not get as
[31:47] much air time anymore but you have
[31:49] pro-family
[31:51] and pro-morality and i want you to
[31:53] really ponder this too
[31:55] pro-israel
[31:57] because
[31:58] and i'm being very if i could say this
[32:00] as a pastor i'm speaking these things
[32:03] i find sometimes there's this
[32:05] is israeli nationalism and israeli
[32:08] loyalty
[32:09] that is so fervent
[32:11] it's hard for me to see how that comes
[32:13] from the message
[32:17] and it it it seems to be so extreme with
[32:19] respect to this pro-israel approach that
[32:22] it it echoes more of the sentiments of
[32:24] well-named evangelical ministries today
[32:26] than it does the ministry that we sit
[32:28] under
[32:29] and so there's
[32:30] i'm saying that as a caution to some of
[32:32] these things that have become a part of
[32:34] our our thought process and our theology
[32:36] we can start to think well where what's
[32:38] the origin of these things what's the
[32:40] source of it and then also this agenda
[32:43] became very pro-america
[32:45] this uh this christian nationalism where
[32:48] you know for this for america for the
[32:50] flag and for these certain things about
[32:53] america
[32:54] and if we looked at it in that way what
[32:57] a
[32:58] an amazing
[33:00] affront a statement like don't even pray
[33:02] for america she's lost
[33:05] i mean just imagine if you said that to
[33:06] some of the flag waving people today who
[33:09] are america america and you say oh no i
[33:11] don't even pray for any more
[33:13] they'd say well you don't even pray
[33:16] you know you're a devil
[33:17] because there's this idea that has
[33:19] conflated patriotism with christianity
[33:25] so
[33:27] what is missing
[33:30] kind of like look at the picture
[33:32] we're not actually
[33:34] maybe we could play uh where is waldo
[33:36] with this pro-life pro family promo
[33:38] pro-israel pro-america
[33:40] what's missing
[33:42] there's never a pro-christ
[33:45] like in the very in the in the politics
[33:47] oh well brother aaron it's assumed and
[33:49] oh well it's in this but i i would even
[33:51] challenge and say well is it really
[33:54] is it not in the arena of politics
[33:57] and would not is a politician
[33:59] uh you know above
[34:02] using your religious convictions
[34:06] to get you to support them for office
[34:09] and a lot of politicians over several
[34:11] decades have morphed into being these
[34:14] evangelical fervent supporters of
[34:16] christianity and it's a political ploy
[34:20] and they'll even change their name so
[34:21] they can appeal more to this evangelical
[34:24] base and what's missing is christ they
[34:26] never are pro-christ which pro in the
[34:28] latin means it's a prefix for
[34:31] right four
[34:33] pro means four there's no for christ
[34:36] what they are is for family values
[34:39] and so their definition of family values
[34:42] and therefore american values those
[34:45] things without being explicit now have
[34:48] served as a substitute for christian
[34:50] values
[34:52] and we give them this label oh family
[34:54] values are christian values american
[34:55] values are christian values but let me
[34:57] ask you this what does that mean for the
[34:59] believer in norway
[35:02] what does that mean for the believer in
[35:03] china who's told by the government you
[35:04] can't have more than so many children
[35:07] what does this mean for believers in
[35:09] countries that have social medicine and
[35:10] they can't homeschool and they have
[35:12] socialist governments and they have
[35:14] they're under communism what does this
[35:16] mean for them to be able to fully step
[35:17] into the mature maturing of their faith
[35:19] and be perfect christians when where
[35:21] they live is not america
[35:24] and so then christianity begins to take
[35:26] on a brand or label as being pro-america
[35:30] it becomes it almost becomes
[35:32] anti-scriptural when we we identify
[35:34] america in the bible in revelations 13.
[35:39] and so what's missing is not family
[35:41] values not american values not being
[35:43] pro-moral moral or pro-choice or even
[35:46] pro-israel standing with israel and
[35:48] recognizing israel's being god's chosen
[35:50] people it's replaced christian values
[35:54] and i i want to suggest to you now for
[35:57] you to ponder
[35:59] and let me posit this
[36:01] could it be that christian values
[36:04] is what would promote promote the value
[36:06] of the family
[36:07] and the true values of family
[36:09] we don't need to define redefine what a
[36:11] family is and legislate what a family is
[36:14] in order to have healthy families we
[36:15] just need to promote the virtues of
[36:17] christianity and let the word have
[36:19] preeminence in people's lives and that's
[36:20] what's going to make a family secure
[36:23] the government saying that we define
[36:24] marriage between one man and one woman
[36:27] didn't make families better
[36:29] it just meant some guys were responsible
[36:31] for a lot of different families i've
[36:32] been married four times
[36:34] i've been just spawning this definition
[36:36] and cletus has got four or five
[36:37] different ex-wives and having a bunch of
[36:39] kids
[36:40] and thinks that he's a family man
[36:43] because we define family as a marriage
[36:45] between a man and a woman
[36:47] and so what's missing is christ
[36:51] in second corinthians chapter 5 20 paul
[36:53] says now then we are ambassadors for
[36:56] christ
[36:58] as though god did beseech you by us
[37:01] saying god beseeched you why did he be
[37:03] by me
[37:04] god spoke to you through my through my
[37:06] ministry through my prophetic gift god
[37:08] paul saying this now as though god did
[37:10] beseech you by us i am an ambassador who
[37:13] came to you ordained by god to speak to
[37:15] you as one who is sent from god to
[37:17] beseech you to do something he says we
[37:20] pray you in christ's stead
[37:22] be reconciled to god
[37:25] in the office of christ in the stead of
[37:27] christ in his footsteps
[37:30] even in his office as it were
[37:33] we are beseeching you to be reconciled
[37:35] to god and paul identifies himself as an
[37:38] ambassador pro-christ
[37:41] a pro-christ ambassador
[37:44] not not pro-family pro-life
[37:47] pro-israel
[37:49] pro uh well pro-rome i guess couldn't
[37:52] say pro-america
[37:53] for not pro-spain i mean he talked about
[37:55] going to spain i mean he was wasn't
[37:57] propane or anything pro he was he was
[37:59] pro-christ
[38:02] and and ambassador is speaking maybe a
[38:04] term of rank but it speaks of an office
[38:07] and it refers to be acting as a
[38:09] representative
[38:10] so when paul says i'm an ambassador for
[38:12] christ i represent christ
[38:14] i'm an advocate for christ i'm not
[38:16] advocating for it necessary for the
[38:18] morals that he advocated for and i'm not
[38:20] necessarily saying oh well you know what
[38:22] i agree with what christ taught about
[38:24] finances and you know what i agree what
[38:26] he said about marriage and you know what
[38:27] i agree about what he said about this
[38:29] and it's not that he had christ all the
[38:31] letter of what christ taught he says you
[38:33] know what that fits my that kind of
[38:35] scratches my itch that fits my my
[38:37] political agenda and then he became pro
[38:39] all the tenants of christ he became
[38:42] pro-christ
[38:43] and that kind of covered it all
[38:46] he wouldn't need to give you his
[38:48] position on every single little doctrine
[38:49] because being pro-christ would assume
[38:52] that whatever's in the nature of christ
[38:53] whatever's in the heart of god
[38:54] whatever's in the word of god is what i
[38:57] live by what i abide by so i don't need
[38:59] to distill down what my platform is i
[39:02] have safety i'm saying i'm for christ
[39:04] whatever he's for i'm for whatever he's
[39:06] against i'm against
[39:09] and
[39:10] so notice how jesus uses the term
[39:13] ambassador it's used as ambassador the
[39:15] same kind of word conjugated here but i
[39:17] use this only so you can recognize what
[39:19] it means to be an ambassador and so that
[39:22] we're not getting lost
[39:23] are the evangelicals ambassadors for
[39:25] christ in the way that they've uh
[39:28] they're motivated and the platforms that
[39:30] they're pursuing
[39:32] and compare it now to paul said i'm an
[39:33] ambassador for christ
[39:35] jesus says in luke 14 31-32 what king
[39:37] going to make war against another king
[39:39] sitteth not down first consulteth
[39:41] whether he be able with ten thousand to
[39:43] meet him that cometh against him with
[39:44] twenty thousand
[39:46] and this is where or else while the
[39:48] other is yet a great way off he sendeth
[39:51] an ambassador and desireth conditions of
[39:54] peace
[39:55] a king who's gonna have battle while the
[39:57] enemy is yet far away
[39:59] knowing that he's outnumbered sends an
[40:01] embassage ambassador literally coming
[40:03] from to send a message the word is
[40:05] actually translated the message
[40:06] elsewhere when jesus was speaking it
[40:08] means to send a message
[40:10] to have this ambassador it's an office
[40:12] of an ambassador who is on a mission
[40:14] sent by a ruler on a mission official
[40:17] government business
[40:18] so then who is paul saying that he acts
[40:20] officially on behalf of
[40:22] when he says that i'm an ambassador for
[40:25] christ as though god himself beseeched
[40:28] you
[40:29] through me
[40:30] because in christ's stead be ye
[40:33] reconciled to god so he's saying i have
[40:35] been officially sent by god to tell you
[40:39] that he wants to reconcile with you i
[40:40] have a ministry of reconciliation
[40:42] preaching the word of god that you be
[40:44] reconciled to him and god has sent me as
[40:48] an ambassador to send a message it has
[40:50] to do with sending a message and in this
[40:53] place where i'm on a mission sent by a
[40:54] ruler and he doesn't place his loyalty
[40:57] with any particular government any
[41:00] particular uh
[41:01] leader or ruler whether it be in rome or
[41:04] whether it be in israel or whether it be
[41:05] in any other power anywhere else he says
[41:07] i am an ambassador of christ
[41:11] and that's what we are just as jesus is
[41:13] saying the king would send an ambassador
[41:15] we are ambassadors of the king
[41:18] let this become more than just maybe
[41:21] cliches of the christian faith or
[41:23] something that you could hear on a
[41:24] sunday morning on the gospel radio hour
[41:27] we are advocates for the cause of christ
[41:31] this is our advocacy this is our voice
[41:33] we we are for christ
[41:36] evangel have you ever do you know what
[41:38] that word means evangelical
[41:40] evangelicalism evangelist they all have
[41:43] this root evangel which means
[41:46] in the greek
[41:47] the good news
[41:50] and i don't believe that i'm shocking
[41:51] anybody today that's not fox
[41:55] right or newsmax
[41:57] or some sort of moderate news or
[41:59] washington examiner or the wall street
[42:01] journal the good news is
[42:04] the gospel
[42:06] so evangel in its very etymology the
[42:08] word itself means where we get
[42:10] evangelist from who is a bringer or a
[42:12] spreader of
[42:14] the good news
[42:15] evangelist one who preaches
[42:17] the gospel
[42:19] and so evangel means the gospel
[42:22] evangelical would mean it has something
[42:24] to do with the gospel to be an
[42:26] evangelist has something to do with the
[42:28] gospel with the good news that's what it
[42:29] ought to mean but yet this has changed
[42:32] now because paul says in philippians 1
[42:34] 27 this is very rich only let your
[42:37] conversation be as it becometh the
[42:40] gospel of christ
[42:42] conversation means live the life that
[42:45] you live to administer affairs or to be
[42:48] a citizen
[42:50] only let your citizenship and your
[42:52] acting as a citizen be as such as
[42:54] becometh the gospel of christ in our
[42:57] citizenry we do not promote the the the
[42:59] health and welfare of the government
[43:02] above the health and welfare of my
[43:04] christian life
[43:06] so it says only let your conversation be
[43:07] as it becometh the gospel that is what's
[43:09] motivating that whether i come to see
[43:10] you or else be absent i may hear of your
[43:12] affairs
[43:14] conduct yourself live in a way that is
[43:16] worthy of the gospel so that when i hear
[43:19] about your affairs
[43:21] that ye stand fast in one spirit with
[43:24] one mind striving together
[43:28] to elect faithful politicians
[43:34] uh living bible again let me find i read
[43:36] it wrong strive one mind striving
[43:39] together for the faith of the gospel
[43:42] what what what is the one thing we can
[43:44] all agree on
[43:45] the faith of the gospel paul says in
[43:48] romans 1 16 for i am not ashamed of the
[43:51] gospel of christ for it is the power of
[43:53] god unto salvation to everyone that
[43:56] believeth who would that be jew or greek
[44:00] the gospel of christ is the gospel is
[44:04] christ it's the gospel of christ you
[44:06] cannot use gospel
[44:07] and that be some sort of ambiguous word
[44:11] it speaks of the good news it speaks of
[44:12] christianity evangel speaks of the
[44:15] gospel of christ and paul is saying that
[44:17] he is a true evangelical because he
[44:20] wants to promote the faith of the gospel
[44:22] he wants the gospel of christ to be
[44:24] spread because
[44:25] it is the power of god
[44:28] that's originally
[44:30] how paul is espousing the virtues of
[44:32] christianity this is originally what
[44:34] evangel would mean it would mean the
[44:36] gospel the good news the spreading of
[44:38] the message of christ
[44:41] the christian christianity has been
[44:43] co-opted by politics
[44:45] whereas politics is using it now
[44:48] it's been co-opted by man-made
[44:49] traditions where we look at an organized
[44:51] religion and it's become more about
[44:53] the denominations and organization
[44:55] organizations than it has been about the
[44:56] message of christ and it's been used to
[44:59] serve carnal agendas
[45:02] again don't think that christianity the
[45:03] gospel and you have no further to read
[45:06] the new testament to find that men will
[45:08] use the gospel to their advantage to
[45:10] promote themselves
[45:12] and use it in a way to further their
[45:14] agendas as opposed to purely and without
[45:16] guile promoting the virtues of christ
[45:20] and as we are preaching in america
[45:24] i want us to consider how that
[45:25] especially in america christianity has
[45:28] politicians have kind of catered to
[45:29] christianity and manipulate it in a way
[45:32] in such a way to use it for their own
[45:34] agendas
[45:35] and we have to we shouldn't just be
[45:37] trusting of politics to think that when
[45:40] they when they say something that seems
[45:42] to be virtuous that they stand for the
[45:44] virtue itself
[45:47] and let me say there is there is this
[45:50] culture of americana christianity
[45:53] probably the more appropriate way to be
[45:54] able to spell is without the first a a
[45:56] culture of america christianity
[46:00] that we've got to be very discerning of
[46:03] we need to be very very careful that we
[46:05] not be kind of caught into this angel of
[46:08] light phenomena where it has the sound
[46:10] of the shepherd but if you pause for
[46:12] your mom be like oh boy you're that was
[46:14] slick that was tricky
[46:17] and we've got to be very very careful
[46:18] and this is where
[46:20] take a deep breath
[46:25] i want you to ponder this very very
[46:26] deeply evangelicalism has created a
[46:29] culture
[46:32] an americana a culture of american
[46:34] christianity evangelicalism has become a
[46:37] culture
[46:38] and it has commercialized that culture
[46:42] and it sells it
[46:46] can i get a witness
[46:48] hey
[46:49] where's that nord organ and micah
[46:51] hammering down on some of those
[46:53] flats over a minor fourth when i needed
[46:56] this is
[46:58] something to ponder evangelicalism
[47:01] has become cultural
[47:02] and it's become commercialized
[47:05] now it's an economy now it's sold
[47:09] and so conservative evangelical is more
[47:11] about culture than it is about doctrine
[47:15] conservative evangelical is more about
[47:17] culture than it is theology
[47:20] and this culture that i'm referring to
[47:22] produces thousands of different
[47:24] religious products
[47:26] thousands and thousands of different
[47:27] religious services and it's consumed by
[47:31] millions of people
[47:33] this is a culture that produces content
[47:35] services and products and it's consumed
[47:38] by millions and millions of people
[47:40] books
[47:41] magazines music cc and music and radio
[47:45] television films conferences blogs even
[47:48] home decor
[47:50] right
[47:51] that's being produced by this
[47:54] uh
[47:55] this brand of christianity and there's
[47:57] books you can buy magazines bookstores
[47:59] music radio television films conferences
[48:01] blogs home decor clothing shirts
[48:04] t-shirts bumper stickers
[48:06] and we have certain things that become
[48:08] staples of
[48:10] now and i'm speaking to us
[48:11] look i'm not lecturing
[48:13] i'm not lecturing the neighbor next door
[48:16] who's a
[48:17] died on the wall you know you know
[48:20] hour of grace john mcarthur bible
[48:22] carrion kind of guy i'm not that's not
[48:24] what i'm talking about i'm talking about
[48:25] even for us to where radio shows and
[48:27] programs that are produced by focus on
[48:29] the family have a very big presence in
[48:32] our lives i'm not preaching against
[48:34] these things i'm not mentioning them
[48:37] and maybe we can all acknowledge yeah
[48:38] you know what focus on the family gets
[48:40] airtime
[48:41] and maybe not all of us but some of us
[48:43] watch a lot of veggie tales
[48:45] and and we find ourselves um
[48:49] humming you know silly songs by larry
[48:52] and then we have family life radio that
[48:54] we listen to and boy what a rebuke for
[48:56] those of us who have xm or sirius the
[48:58] only message we listen to anymore
[49:02] and we have lifeway uh christian
[49:04] bookstores and these different things
[49:05] and even when it comes to education we
[49:07] have certain educational curriculums
[49:09] that are very christian focused and
[49:11] bible-based and if we homeschool our
[49:12] kids we can be part of homeschool
[49:14] coalitions and homeschool groups and
[49:16] they all kind of take this theme of it's
[49:17] a christian homeschool group this is a
[49:19] christian educational curriculum it has
[49:21] bible classes and we all begin to
[49:23] promote the liberty way right
[49:26] because it also is an education where
[49:28] it's like when it comes to food i can
[49:30] eat at chick-fil-a and i can buy one to
[49:32] hold in the refrigerator till sunday and
[49:34] i can and i can get my education from a
[49:36] becca and pensacola christian college
[49:38] and i can go to liberty uh and i can do
[49:41] distance correspondence courses through
[49:43] liberty and all our all our lives as
[49:45] message believers we can feel all these
[49:48] different areas entertainment for our
[49:49] kids and evening time entertainment
[49:51] thank god for kurt cameron we've got all
[49:53] these things that we can do that are all
[49:55] evangelical christian based right
[49:58] and just put it in man
[50:00] christian
[50:02] dub foundation signed off on it
[50:05] and think about the voices that we
[50:07] listen to
[50:10] lock the door so no one can get in but
[50:12] more importantly that no one can get out
[50:16] someone told me one time i don't want
[50:18] you to stop the tape but someone told me
[50:20] one time they heard a message preacher
[50:21] say stop the tape i'm fixing to cuss
[50:24] and i thought wow
[50:26] that's shocking
[50:29] i'm not about to cuss
[50:31] but what kind of voices are we listening
[50:33] to everybody everybody trusts me at this
[50:34] point that i i i i'm going to be honest
[50:37] with you the voices of gary ezell
[50:41] gary chapman
[50:42] michael pearl or debbie pearl
[50:45] elizabeth elliott sally clarkson tim or
[50:48] beverly lahaye
[50:50] and maybe you don't recognize any of
[50:51] these but you might recognize some of
[50:53] their books about love languages and to
[50:55] train up a child and
[50:57] different ways that these authors and
[50:59] these writers and uh tim lahaye and
[51:01] beverly lahaye and all these people they
[51:04] produce content books and seminars and
[51:06] things for us to read now you could say
[51:08] brother aaron are you preaching against
[51:09] it no i'm wanting you to become aware
[51:12] of a lot of different things that you
[51:15] that we inform us and we read
[51:18] and begin to form maybe subconsciously
[51:20] certain convictions
[51:22] were tied post in our lives
[51:25] and by doing this this is the part that
[51:27] i really want to shake you and get your
[51:29] attention
[51:30] all of this
[51:31] production and consumption in all these
[51:34] different forms and mediums and all
[51:35] these voices are listening to cause us
[51:38] to partake in a common culture
[51:41] because it's not just message believers
[51:43] that read sally clarkson right because
[51:45] you're not her audience
[51:47] it's not just message believers that
[51:48] read gary chapman's love languages
[51:51] it's not just message people who are
[51:53] digging in to train up a child or
[51:55] and growing kids god's ways and these
[51:57] things it's not just message believers
[51:59] who have these things and have kept
[52:00] these things going they have their own
[52:02] theology they have their own doctrine
[52:03] they have their own convictions they
[52:04] have their own failed marriages and
[52:06] dysfunctional families but yet they
[52:08] present to you this clean polished
[52:09] theology in that we wholesale or digest
[52:12] it come on somebody
[52:14] we're digesting it and it becomes a part
[52:15] of our conviction part of the way we
[52:17] treat our children and part of the way
[52:19] that we treat one another and part of
[52:20] the way that we want to create this we
[52:22] want to replicate the perfect instagram
[52:24] life that sarah clarkson has in our own
[52:26] lives and we're frustrated when it
[52:28] doesn't work out
[52:29] she has time to be the perfect wife and
[52:31] be the perfect mother and the perfect
[52:32] homeschool mom and i don't even really
[52:34] know all her story and does seminars and
[52:36] everything and i can just barely get
[52:37] school done and do laundry
[52:39] and you feel convicted like wow that's
[52:40] been a real virtuous ministry for you
[52:43] right
[52:44] i want you to think about the images
[52:46] that you're feeding on the images that
[52:47] you're seeing and it causes all of us
[52:49] not just message believers but everyone
[52:51] who is evangelical everyone who's a real
[52:54] christian are eating these same things
[52:56] and when that happens we form bonds with
[52:58] like-minded consumers
[53:00] we're all partaken in the same culture
[53:02] we form bonds with like-minded consumers
[53:04] and therefore form the basis of a shared
[53:06] cultural identity
[53:09] where the reason why we get caught up in
[53:11] a lot of these different things anymore
[53:12] is because we've been consuming the same
[53:14] content we all watched the same kurt
[53:16] cameron movie we all watched the chosen
[53:18] we all watched this we all listened to
[53:20] that we all downloaded that app we've
[53:21] all been watching veggie tales we've all
[53:22] been listening to focus on the family we
[53:24] all been listening to adventures in
[53:26] odyssey we've all been reasonably the
[53:28] same uh christian love novels and love
[53:30] comes softly and this movie will never
[53:32] end and whatever all these names are and
[53:34] we've been feeding all that so then
[53:35] whenever we seem to kind of be aligning
[53:37] ourselves with mainstream christianity
[53:39] in the evangelical right maybe we're not
[53:42] doing it because we've all been feeding
[53:44] on the same revealed word maybe it's
[53:46] happened because we formed this cultural
[53:48] identity by all the things that we've
[53:50] been consuming
[53:54] i found this statement
[53:57] the products christians consume shape
[54:00] the faith they inhabit
[54:03] the products that the christian that
[54:05] christians consume shape the faith they
[54:08] inhabit therefore when paul says that
[54:10] we're striving together for the faith of
[54:12] the gospel many are striving for the
[54:15] faith of the gospel but it's become
[54:16] another
[54:20] and think about it this speaks of the
[54:21] evangelicals
[54:23] i want to just kind of
[54:24] slip this in there how are the
[54:26] mainstream protestants the
[54:27] traditionalists the
[54:29] the fundamentalists
[54:31] gonna
[54:34] come together to unite with the
[54:36] evangelicals i mean this is a pretty
[54:38] aggressive platform and how are you
[54:40] going to get everyone do you how are
[54:42] they going to how are these people being
[54:44] kind of massaged together it's
[54:45] remarkable
[54:46] i want to continue just to
[54:49] win friends and influence people this
[54:50] evening
[54:53] but there's different preachers out
[54:54] there tim lahaye
[54:56] james dobson bill gothard many many
[54:58] others i could mention
[55:00] that preach a message of fear
[55:03] to serve a political agenda
[55:06] whether it be blood moons or oncoming
[55:08] apocalypse or things in israel and all
[55:10] these different things they preach a
[55:12] gospel of fear and they do it to serve a
[55:14] political agenda and often they do it to
[55:16] serve
[55:17] to create this reliance upon them for
[55:20] prophetic insight and for the
[55:21] explanation of what's happening in the
[55:22] world
[55:24] and so there's a lot of things that
[55:25] become
[55:26] uh these these seeds are sown through
[55:28] these seminars and programs and we get
[55:31] real tied into a certain way of seeing
[55:33] things we get real tied into a certain
[55:34] way of raising children get tied into a
[55:36] certain way of um educating our children
[55:38] all these different ways but to a lot of
[55:40] these ministries the seed behind it the
[55:42] thought behind it is to preach a message
[55:45] of fear because they're trying to serve
[55:46] some sort of personal agenda or
[55:48] political agenda
[55:50] and what do they preach fear communism
[55:54] fear big government
[55:56] fear socialism
[55:58] fear feminism
[55:59] fear homosexuals
[56:01] fear muslims
[56:03] fear immigrants
[56:04] right
[56:06] why are you getting all caught quiet on
[56:07] me
[56:08] you ain't scared any of those are you
[56:10] we shouldn't be
[56:12] we don't have to fear communism have we
[56:13] not been explicitly taught
[56:15] do not fear communism
[56:18] yet what is what is a lot of the things
[56:20] that's promoted these days to get us to
[56:21] motivate us to act politically you
[56:23] better be afraid of socialism you better
[56:24] be afraid of communism they're going to
[56:26] drag us right back to you know to nazi
[56:28] germany
[56:30] and we've been taught we shouldn't be
[56:31] fearing any of those isms
[56:35] this idea of being anti-big government
[56:38] to be fear big government to fear
[56:39] feminism to fear liberalism to fear
[56:41] homosexuals to fear immigrants all those
[56:43] fears i i hope i'm not offending anybody
[56:46] i'm wanting you to consider what was the
[56:48] source of that
[56:51] because my bible doesn't teach me to
[56:53] hate any of those classes
[56:55] my bible doesn't teach me to fear any of
[56:57] those classes my bible teaches me to
[57:00] fear god it's my fear of god that causes
[57:02] me to abhor sin and to recognize the
[57:05] dangers of any ideal that does not
[57:06] promote the virtues of christ
[57:10] and all christian america is united
[57:12] under these political causes
[57:15] there's this forced unity and what is it
[57:17] it's a false image of christ
[57:29] there's no camera on you maybe you don't
[57:31] want to say amen too loud but
[57:33] if if you can say if you can i want you
[57:35] to indicate some sign of that the lord
[57:38] this is positive for you tonight raise
[57:39] your hand if it's positive for you
[57:41] tonight
[57:45] i'm going to read one two three four
[57:48] five six seven quotes
[57:51] did good i usually count by 500 but i
[57:53] was able to fight seven quotes
[57:56] i think that was right
[57:57] they're lengthy too a little bit but
[57:59] it's 8 16. i think i told the people
[58:01] last time that i began preaching at 7 20
[58:04] it's or it's 8 20 it's now 8 16. it's
[58:07] like hey man preaching the gospel
[58:09] you just move anywhere you want in time
[58:12] but i be it's 8 16 right now i begin
[58:15] preaching at 8 20.
[58:16] once again i have managed to go
[58:18] backwards in time
[58:20] and listen to these statements and stay
[58:22] very very close because
[58:23] i trust that you have enough confidence
[58:25] in me to know at this point that i
[58:27] probably have something
[58:29] very precise in the message of the hour
[58:32] that if you dug your heels in too hard
[58:34] you're going to find yourself arguing
[58:35] with the word
[58:37] to maintain your personal agenda in this
[58:39] matter
[58:41] in the message the reproach for the
[58:43] cause of the word it's the only quote
[58:44] that i'm going to use that's pre 63
[58:46] that's pre-seals i believe
[58:47] i believe it was preached in phoenix
[58:50] some about the the reproach for the
[58:52] cause of the lord is actually talking
[58:53] about the uh the light that came in
[58:55] there out in the first coming of christ
[58:57] he says that's what and how the wise men
[58:59] came and they said they didn't come from
[59:00] they were following the star they were
[59:02] following the light
[59:03] and as soon as they came in jerusalem
[59:04] like the star disappeared brother
[59:06] brown's bringing this parallel how in
[59:07] this religion in organized religion in
[59:09] this denominational viewpoint the
[59:10] light's put out you got to get away from
[59:12] that to see the light so that's what
[59:13] puts many a light out that's right is
[59:16] getting hooked up with such a group as
[59:17] that they don't even believe it in the
[59:19] first place
[59:21] and how are we going to have a union of
[59:22] churches
[59:25] how are we going to walk together except
[59:26] we be agreed now ponder this how are we
[59:29] going to get methodists to unite with
[59:30] charismatic
[59:32] christians how are we going to get snake
[59:34] handling uh uh you know backwoods
[59:37] pentecostals to to join hands with the
[59:40] catholics
[59:41] what is going to force this union how is
[59:43] the fellowship of the world why all the
[59:45] churches united churches of the world
[59:47] how we gonna unite together
[59:50] when we are million miles apart very
[59:52] very profound observation brother
[59:53] branham how are we going to do it
[59:56] evangelicals with us this that and that
[59:59] and all together and yet united together
[1:00:01] with such a bunch of corruption
[1:00:05] and where did he recognize corruption
[1:00:08] politics are corrupt this is corrupt
[1:00:11] that's corrupt there had there's got to
[1:00:13] be some way to force this union and what
[1:00:14] did he always say it was it was a unit
[1:00:16] of church and state
[1:00:18] so now he's saying the evangelicals will
[1:00:20] unite together in every other church
[1:00:22] with a bunch of corruption
[1:00:25] i'm going to skip around i wanted to i
[1:00:26] wanted to put this i labored to put it
[1:00:28] in a way in an order that would kind of
[1:00:31] edify you and not just be reading it
[1:00:33] chronologically but you could see that
[1:00:35] this thought build here
[1:00:37] now he says in 1964 we have trouble in
[1:00:39] our churches now
[1:00:41] you think
[1:00:42] do you not think that there'd be some
[1:00:43] amplification of it today then
[1:00:45] notice it and it's genesis how prophet
[1:00:47] is discerning this we have
[1:00:48] denominational troubles arguments in our
[1:00:50] churches we don't know what's going to
[1:00:51] take place we have a great thing forming
[1:00:54] up there all of us believers in the
[1:00:55] bible
[1:00:56] see something is fixing to take place
[1:00:58] there's nobody but knows that
[1:01:01] but what knows that and all the churches
[1:01:03] are going to be brought into that
[1:01:04] ecumenical
[1:01:05] council of churches now let me say this
[1:01:07] and you're probably going to read ahead
[1:01:08] well good i stopped it in a perfect spot
[1:01:11] that don't you think it would be subtle
[1:01:14] right don't you have to be okay maybe
[1:01:16] you disagree maybe no maybe it'll just
[1:01:18] be obvious like the devil is going to
[1:01:19] say hey come on my side guys
[1:01:22] but it's going to be very very subtle
[1:01:24] like they're going to join into this
[1:01:25] thinking we are doing what's right
[1:01:26] according to the bible and they're going
[1:01:28] to feel like you know what god i know
[1:01:30] that we believe in baptism in jesus name
[1:01:33] but you know what i can lay that aside
[1:01:34] and join my arms together with this
[1:01:36] person who doesn't even believe in the
[1:01:38] divinity of jesus christ and we can
[1:01:39] unite our powers together you know to be
[1:01:42] able to at least promote morality
[1:01:46] at least we can promote the right ideals
[1:01:48] to sanctify society and how are they
[1:01:50] going to be able to accomplish this just
[1:01:51] ponder it because he already asked the
[1:01:52] question how's it going to happen we're
[1:01:53] a million miles apart
[1:01:54] but somehow they're going to join with a
[1:01:56] bunch of corruption
[1:01:58] and notice this phrasing
[1:02:00] then when you do that you're going to
[1:02:02] forfeit your great evangelical teaching
[1:02:05] of the bible
[1:02:07] do i give anybody goosebumps
[1:02:09] i'm getting them all over again
[1:02:13] evangelicals not evangelical anymore
[1:02:15] it's merely a label a political one that
[1:02:18] is abandoned
[1:02:20] their doctrines of the bible
[1:02:22] and he says in terms of uniting together
[1:02:25] you're going to forfeit your evangelical
[1:02:27] teachings of the bible and the
[1:02:28] pentecostals are sympathizing with it
[1:02:31] going right into
[1:02:32] it so what's happening they're not
[1:02:35] necessarily changing their doctrine on
[1:02:36] water baptism they may not even be
[1:02:38] changing their doctrine on the oneness
[1:02:40] of the godhead they may not even be
[1:02:41] changing their doctrine on the gifts but
[1:02:43] yet they're sympathizing with some
[1:02:45] movement some ideology some
[1:02:47] representation of morality and in
[1:02:50] sympathizing he says they're like a hog
[1:02:52] going to its slaughter that's right
[1:02:54] ecumenical counsel
[1:02:55] many great pentecostal leaders agreeing
[1:02:58] with them
[1:03:00] i'm telling you don't you you never
[1:03:02] stick your neck in a thing like that
[1:03:05] that's exactly what the bible said would
[1:03:06] come to pass there's the beast and the
[1:03:08] mark perfectly everything's setting
[1:03:10] right in order we see this and we wonder
[1:03:12] what's going to be the outcome of it
[1:03:14] we wonder what it literally is going to
[1:03:16] be but we know it will be a union of
[1:03:17] church and state ecumenical
[1:03:18] ecclesiastical power joining together
[1:03:21] government and religion
[1:03:23] joining together in a forced union
[1:03:27] and already these things coming
[1:03:29] taking shape and people who are fervent
[1:03:32] about christ and let me say this because
[1:03:34] i took some of these things out of my
[1:03:35] notes realizing i wanted to finish it
[1:03:37] tonight we'll probably have to get into
[1:03:38] it more of it on sunday that jesus
[1:03:40] christ looks more like rambo now
[1:03:43] right
[1:03:46] then this meat humble man of the word
[1:03:48] he's a warrior
[1:03:50] right he's a man's man
[1:03:52] he if he was alive today he'd have his
[1:03:54] elk tag
[1:03:55] right
[1:03:56] and he'd be out in the kaibab somewhere
[1:03:59] hunting he wouldn't shave in the month
[1:04:00] of october we have our image of what
[1:04:02] christ would be right he'd be a man's
[1:04:04] man
[1:04:05] if he was if it was okay christian wise
[1:04:07] to dip he probably dip right
[1:04:10] probably a marlboro man or something
[1:04:12] come on
[1:04:13] i mean anybody my friends want to say
[1:04:15] amen tonight if you believe it
[1:04:17] think about the the caricature of christ
[1:04:22] we've invented a john wayne
[1:04:25] blessed are those who punch a guy in the
[1:04:28] mouth who's mistreating the elderly
[1:04:30] widow on the back 40
[1:04:33] right
[1:04:35] he's a guy punches he's a brawler he's a
[1:04:37] fighter he stands up for justice he's a
[1:04:40] military man right
[1:04:42] he's a patriot
[1:04:49] well they tell me there's an opening
[1:04:51] somewhere so
[1:04:54] i'm getting phone calls maybe it was a
[1:04:55] premonition
[1:04:59] everything's setting right in order
[1:05:02] what shall we do with jesus called
[1:05:04] christ you know what i forgot to point
[1:05:06] something out can we go back two few
[1:05:07] slides to the first quote to begin to
[1:05:08] read the reproach for what
[1:05:11] further
[1:05:14] the cause of the word
[1:05:16] i meant to highlight that
[1:05:18] he's preaching a sermon the reproach for
[1:05:20] the cause of the word
[1:05:22] not the reproach of being pro-life
[1:05:25] not the reproach of being pro-israel
[1:05:27] again i want to make it very clear i'm
[1:05:29] not making a statement in that
[1:05:31] i i'm not taking a side i'm not saying
[1:05:33] that you shouldn't be pro-life you
[1:05:34] shouldn't be pro-israel you should be
[1:05:36] you are saying you should be pro-america
[1:05:37] i'm saying let's be pro-christ
[1:05:40] and he's saying the reproach for the
[1:05:41] cause of the word
[1:05:44] not a political party not the tea party
[1:05:46] movement the reproach for being
[1:05:47] libertarian
[1:05:49] that's not what he's preaching
[1:05:52] because we can't try to find this
[1:05:53] political sweet spot
[1:05:56] right where you know i'm green party i'm
[1:05:57] this i'm that no you're not gonna find
[1:05:59] it
[1:06:02] so what shall we do with jesus called
[1:06:04] christ
[1:06:05] is the next statement i want to read
[1:06:07] from the pentecostals the assemblies of
[1:06:08] god and the great other churches of the
[1:06:10] pentecostal kingdom and of the full
[1:06:12] gospel people how can they forfeit their
[1:06:15] evangelical teachings the very
[1:06:16] principles that they stood on
[1:06:19] how can they do it and where they was
[1:06:22] raised up to come out of those
[1:06:23] organizations and condemn it and they
[1:06:26] have to forfeit their evangelical
[1:06:28] doctrine to walk with man who disagree
[1:06:31] with upon the principles of the bible
[1:06:34] divine healing and the power of god in
[1:06:36] jesus christ how can two walk together
[1:06:38] except they be agreed
[1:06:43] you remember how when brother brandon
[1:06:45] made the statement that martin luther
[1:06:46] king jr had the right idea
[1:06:48] he just went about it the wrong way
[1:06:51] don't think for a second he was wrong to
[1:06:53] advocate for those civil rights
[1:06:56] don't think for a second that if he
[1:06:58] aired in the way that he tried to
[1:06:59] achieve it meant that what he was trying
[1:07:01] to achieve was wrong
[1:07:04] what he's saying is he was a a sincere
[1:07:06] man and maybe not a completely moral man
[1:07:08] who was using the wrong form in the
[1:07:11] wrong way to try to achieve something
[1:07:13] but what he was trying to achieve i
[1:07:15] believe we should support as christians
[1:07:17] wouldn't you don't you believe
[1:07:19] that we could say that you know that in
[1:07:21] the eyes of god that men are equal in
[1:07:23] the eyes of god
[1:07:28] and so
[1:07:29] he says this they forfeit their
[1:07:31] evangelical doctors walk with men who
[1:07:32] disagree upon the principles of the
[1:07:34] bible divine heal and the power of god
[1:07:35] in jesus christ how are they going to do
[1:07:36] this
[1:07:38] think about how else are they going to
[1:07:39] come together when they're a million
[1:07:40] miles apart find a common enemy
[1:07:44] find something to be
[1:07:46] maybe it's not pro-life maybe it's
[1:07:48] anti-pro-choice
[1:07:52] maybe it's maybe it's not
[1:07:55] pro-family values
[1:07:57] it's anti-homosexual
[1:08:01] did you not know that's how it started
[1:08:04] you know there wasn't this great moral
[1:08:05] upswing of really standing for christ in
[1:08:08] the home and that's what established the
[1:08:10] family values platform in the republican
[1:08:12] party it was a distaste for
[1:08:13] homosexuality
[1:08:15] it wasn't a real moral upswing it was a
[1:08:18] political uh kickback and an opportunity
[1:08:21] to see the evangelical support to gain
[1:08:23] support in office and to be able to
[1:08:25] bankroll their political agenda and
[1:08:27] their economic agenda by taking a
[1:08:29] polarizing
[1:08:30] lightning rod topic and to get this take
[1:08:33] the moral
[1:08:34] anxiety of the people and produce this
[1:08:37] family-valued platform when it really
[1:08:39] should have just been anti-homosexual
[1:08:41] platform and it would have worked
[1:08:42] probably just the same but how it
[1:08:44] slipped in and became even more
[1:08:46] destructive is we just kind of bought it
[1:08:47] as being something really really sincere
[1:08:51] and so we think that republicans
[1:08:52] republicans
[1:08:54] are family men
[1:08:56] why they are out there on secret dates
[1:08:58] with their boyfriends
[1:09:03] how can two walk together except they'd
[1:09:04] be agreed there you are that's the hour
[1:09:07] that we've arrived yeah at and notice
[1:09:09] the language and that's the big machine
[1:09:11] that's set up now now they've got the
[1:09:13] mechanics
[1:09:17] the only thing i have to have is satan
[1:09:19] in there with the dynamics to force the
[1:09:21] marking of the beast why she's forced
[1:09:23] down then the dynamics is working the
[1:09:25] mechanics are there they've already got
[1:09:26] them
[1:09:29] in the message then jesus came and
[1:09:31] called this is the darkest hour the
[1:09:32] church has ever seen
[1:09:34] now you know what every church soon is
[1:09:36] going to have to belong to that world
[1:09:37] council of churches i know that we're
[1:09:39] thinking in terms of some sort of
[1:09:41] official moral majority
[1:09:43] right
[1:09:44] it's got to be called the world council
[1:09:46] of churches and it's got to have the ink
[1:09:48] the org something attached to it they
[1:09:50] all have to literally sign a charter but
[1:09:52] it's going to be much more subtle than
[1:09:54] that
[1:09:55] and when you do you'll forfeit your
[1:09:57] evangelical rights when you do that
[1:10:00] and then if you don't then you can't be
[1:10:02] a denomination no more
[1:10:05] you'll forfeit your evangelical rights
[1:10:07] you'll have to forfeit their evangelical
[1:10:09] doctrine you're going to forfeit the
[1:10:11] great evangelical teaching of the bible
[1:10:13] notice what is at the core of joining up
[1:10:16] with this political regime or this world
[1:10:18] council of churches and what's at the
[1:10:20] core of how can two walk together except
[1:10:22] they be agreed what is he saying they've
[1:10:23] got to find some common basis of
[1:10:25] agreement
[1:10:27] you don't believe jesus was divine you
[1:10:28] don't believe in the baptismal holy
[1:10:29] ghost you don't believe in baptism name
[1:10:31] lord jesus christ you don't believe the
[1:10:32] bible is the truth you don't even
[1:10:34] believe in christianity you don't even
[1:10:35] believe that jesus christ was real you
[1:10:37] just believe the bible is full of good
[1:10:38] stories but are you anti-abortion come
[1:10:40] on let's go
[1:10:43] oh you you're pro-israel let's go
[1:10:46] you believe that marriage should be
[1:10:47] defined as one man and one woman listen
[1:10:49] saints we've already got the definition
[1:10:51] we don't need any more legislation
[1:10:53] we've got that's what's going to work
[1:10:54] for a believer that's what's going to
[1:10:55] work for a christian that's what's going
[1:10:56] to affect change in someone's life is
[1:10:58] when they recognize the true spiritual
[1:11:00] nature of marriage that's going to be
[1:11:02] more compelling than authoritarian
[1:11:04] government telling you you can't smoke
[1:11:05] dope and you can't marry who you love
[1:11:07] and you can't do this and you can't do
[1:11:08] that that does not produce christians
[1:11:10] legislation does not produce christians
[1:11:18] you forfeit your evangelical rights
[1:11:20] forfeit evangelicalism forfeit
[1:11:22] evangelistic teaching forfeit forfeit
[1:11:25] forfeit what did it forfeiting the true
[1:11:27] nature
[1:11:28] of the gospel
[1:11:30] and the world has fallen the world is
[1:11:32] again falling apart we hear so much we
[1:11:35] so hear so much about this new system
[1:11:37] going to bring the religious system you
[1:11:38] know going to bring peace upon the earth
[1:11:40] and when the catholics and all the
[1:11:42] protestants unite together brother ernie
[1:11:44] pointed out something last week
[1:11:45] protestants what are they what do they
[1:11:46] like to do protest
[1:11:49] it's just in their genes
[1:11:52] all of them men and women
[1:11:54] and all the protestants unite together
[1:11:56] some of them believe in divine healing
[1:11:57] some don't believe and some believe this
[1:11:59] and some believe that and you have to
[1:12:01] forfeit your big fuss you've been
[1:12:03] fussing about all the time your
[1:12:05] evangelical belief to get into the world
[1:12:06] council
[1:12:08] is it this is eye-opening to me maybe
[1:12:10] i'm the only one who had my eyes opened
[1:12:12] this week to see how perfect more
[1:12:14] perfect this message is if then that may
[1:12:16] be somewhat of a a paradox to be more
[1:12:18] perfect but just how beautifully it
[1:12:20] already lays in the word and when we see
[1:12:24] the complete abandonment within
[1:12:26] christianity from christ we think well
[1:12:28] how did that ever happen there had to be
[1:12:30] some way
[1:12:31] to call everyone to this
[1:12:34] motivation and this standing up for
[1:12:35] certain things because someone who is
[1:12:37] evangelical and by christian by
[1:12:39] nomination i'm a christian i'm a
[1:12:40] christian you couldn't completely tell
[1:12:42] them to reject christ you had to come up
[1:12:44] with some other false image that you
[1:12:47] sold them on that this supports the
[1:12:48] virtues of christ
[1:12:50] they ran away from christ and kicked
[1:12:52] christ out of the church thinking that
[1:12:53] they were worshiping him and lifting him
[1:12:55] up and lifting up his virtues and paul
[1:12:57] says there's not another christ
[1:13:00] jehovah jireh part three you know 1900
[1:13:02] years ago on good friday this is very
[1:13:03] beautiful to bring in this modern event
[1:13:05] the church rejected jesus christ and an
[1:13:07] earthquake shook the world all over and
[1:13:09] he was talking about the earthquake that
[1:13:10] it just happened on good friday
[1:13:13] a lot of neat things parallels there and
[1:13:15] they rejected him again in the laodicean
[1:13:17] age as the bible said they would do and
[1:13:19] had put him on the outside who has
[1:13:22] christendom american christianity the
[1:13:24] pentecostal church the laodicean church
[1:13:26] age
[1:13:27] so just because it has the pensacola
[1:13:30] christian community behind it just
[1:13:31] because it has liberty behind it just
[1:13:32] because it has james dobson these are
[1:13:34] all christian people christian authors
[1:13:36] christian writers they don't have god
[1:13:38] there's it's not something that's purely
[1:13:40] god
[1:13:41] it's not something that's purely christ
[1:13:42] they borrow they take things there's
[1:13:44] truths that can be inspired to them
[1:13:46] there's a lot of good that maybe can be
[1:13:47] gleaned from them but listen and i i
[1:13:49] don't mind just being well read but we
[1:13:51] should also be informed by the word of
[1:13:53] god and led by the spirit we begin to
[1:13:55] digest those things and never just take
[1:13:57] them wholesale as being an honest
[1:13:59] representation of jesus christ let me
[1:14:01] say it again never take anything that
[1:14:03] may be out there in the world today
[1:14:04] whether it be music movies articles
[1:14:07] podcast uh you name it writers blogs
[1:14:11] anything do not take it as being purely
[1:14:14] christ
[1:14:20] they rejected him again in the layout of
[1:14:21] the same age as bible said they would
[1:14:22] had him on the outside and this
[1:14:24] ecumenical move of the council church is
[1:14:26] exactly what they're doing
[1:14:29] now it might be said oh brother aaron's
[1:14:31] preaching against james dobson brother
[1:14:32] aaron's preaching against bill gothard
[1:14:34] and and you'll you'll find somebody
[1:14:35] somewhere who subscribed to their
[1:14:37] programs and and offered their teachings
[1:14:39] and you're gonna say i'm against that
[1:14:40] person that's a lie
[1:14:43] i'm not against anyone i'm for christ
[1:14:47] and i've been benefited by many
[1:14:48] ministries that i know for a fact have
[1:14:50] borrowed different things from certain
[1:14:51] places and a real gift has picked up a
[1:14:54] real truth and used it for my benefit
[1:14:56] and i don't need to run to the altar of
[1:14:58] james dobson to get fixed
[1:15:01] wives don't need to run to the altar of
[1:15:02] sally clarkson to know how to homeschool
[1:15:04] their children
[1:15:05] we can run to christ
[1:15:10] he says they're forfeiting all their
[1:15:11] evangelical teachings and things
[1:15:15] well how did christ get kicked out of
[1:15:16] the church they forfeited their
[1:15:17] evangelical teachings how can two walk
[1:15:19] together unless they be agreed you
[1:15:20] realize how often he says that
[1:15:22] and what's he identifying there has to
[1:15:23] be an agreement somewhere
[1:15:25] where's the agreement
[1:15:26] the simple agenda right
[1:15:29] the political agenda
[1:15:31] we can all agree
[1:15:33] on pro-life
[1:15:35] we can all agree on pro-family
[1:15:38] we can all agree on
[1:15:40] uh pro-small government or whatever we
[1:15:42] can all agree on a capitalism we can all
[1:15:45] agree on
[1:15:46] right pro-israel
[1:15:49] how can two walk together unless they be
[1:15:50] agreed well you can't do it
[1:15:52] that won't work with real genuine
[1:15:53] christians
[1:15:56] all right this is your chance to amen
[1:15:59] you don't want to stick your head up
[1:16:00] thinking you're in a room with a bunch
[1:16:01] of liberals to this point you really
[1:16:02] really want to pat me on the back and
[1:16:04] knock this table out of the way and hug
[1:16:05] me you know or something like that now
[1:16:06] is your chance to really get loud that
[1:16:08] won't work with real genuine christians
[1:16:09] they'll never receive it no sir a
[1:16:11] born-again christian will never go in a
[1:16:13] trap like that
[1:16:14] it's just like putting a duck in a cage
[1:16:17] they know he's headed for the slaughter
[1:16:19] you'll never drive him into that so we a
[1:16:22] real born-again christian will stay away
[1:16:24] from that
[1:16:26] may we as real born-again christians be
[1:16:29] washed of any political ideology be
[1:16:32] washed of any bond that we form through
[1:16:34] consumerism oh god let me not allow my
[1:16:37] the faith that i inhabit be defined by
[1:16:40] the things i've consumed
[1:16:44] i don't want to be walking in a world
[1:16:45] that kirk cameron was the producer and
[1:16:47] director of through movies i don't want
[1:16:49] to be walking in a world that that um
[1:16:52] adventures in honesty of shape i don't
[1:16:53] think walking in a world that's been
[1:16:54] informed but alone by veggie tales i
[1:16:56] don't want to be doing things through
[1:16:58] some paradigm of something else other
[1:17:00] than the word of god that's been sent to
[1:17:01] me in this hour
[1:17:06] it's like putting a duck in a cage
[1:17:09] a real born-again christian will stay
[1:17:11] away from that
[1:17:13] in closing brother mike if you please
[1:17:14] come
[1:17:17] this was so
[1:17:18] so inspiring
[1:17:20] notice the loosing of this
[1:17:22] ecclesiastical spirit
[1:17:27] now 20 years later after that war we see
[1:17:28] the loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit
[1:17:31] one under the seventh seal
[1:17:33] the seventh trumpet to the jew
[1:17:35] seven seal two
[1:17:36] the bride he says look at the moon
[1:17:38] darkening out what under see it drawn
[1:17:40] out the son of man being drove from the
[1:17:42] church
[1:17:44] what is it
[1:17:45] joining in with the ecclesiastical bunch
[1:17:48] the ecumenical move and with the world
[1:17:51] council of churches has drove every man
[1:17:54] what does that thing stand for
[1:17:58] why you have to surrender all your
[1:17:59] evangelical teachings and things
[1:18:02] how can two walk together unless they be
[1:18:04] agreed
[1:18:05] they can't
[1:18:07] jesus said they can't
[1:18:09] just for the
[1:18:10] last few moments
[1:18:12] here's here's the three quotes i've been
[1:18:14] reading
[1:18:15] right down
[1:18:17] to this part right here
[1:18:19] one two three four five six seven eight
[1:18:22] nine lines
[1:18:24] he says
[1:18:25] what does that thing stand for
[1:18:28] why you have to surrender all your
[1:18:29] evangelical teachings and things how can
[1:18:32] two walk together unless they be agreed
[1:18:34] they can't jesus said they can't and how
[1:18:36] can a church
[1:18:38] the methodist and baptists walk together
[1:18:42] are you listening
[1:18:44] what is going to bring the methodists
[1:18:45] and the baptists
[1:18:46] what line can be drawn in the sand where
[1:18:48] they're going to stand shoulder to
[1:18:49] shoulder
[1:18:52] and oppose something what what's going
[1:18:53] to do it how can the church of christ
[1:18:56] walk with the presbyterians
[1:18:58] how can the catholic walk with the
[1:19:00] protestant how can the protestant walk
[1:19:02] with protestant
[1:19:03] [Music]
[1:19:07] but the bride can walk with the word
[1:19:10] which is christ
[1:19:12] it must be an agreement not the
[1:19:14] ecclesiastical system but the word you
[1:19:16] have to agree with the word to walk with
[1:19:18] the word jesus said so that makes it
[1:19:20] right let's not have a right wing
[1:19:24] political leaning let us be right under
[1:19:26] the wings of christ if it's christ if
[1:19:28] it's worth that's what makes it right
[1:19:30] not in the terms of left or right
[1:19:31] liberal or conservative but i want to be
[1:19:33] right when it comes to christ that's the
[1:19:35] right that i am i'm not in the right
[1:19:37] political spectrum i'm in the right word
[1:19:40] channel
[1:19:42] and it may seem very very subtle but i
[1:19:44] hope the word just highlights it to you
[1:19:46] tonight to recognize that he says how
[1:19:48] are you ever going to get all these
[1:19:50] different denominations and definitions
[1:19:52] of jesus to walk together because they
[1:19:54] can't unless they agree satan found
[1:19:56] things they can agree on
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:20:01] i mean what we can do very easily is
[1:20:03] advocate join our voice with theirs
[1:20:06] because it sounds so close to things we
[1:20:09] believe
[1:20:11] when the best voice against those things
[1:20:15] the best voice to promote what the
[1:20:17] virtues that are really
[1:20:19] those things pretend to have
[1:20:21] would become
[1:20:23] wouldn't it
[1:20:26] not stand in front of an abortion clinic
[1:20:28] and keep a young girl from going in
[1:20:30] by throwing blood you know paint on her
[1:20:32] and telling her she's a murderer
[1:20:35] but saying come
[1:20:38] you should come to church
[1:20:41] that's got to be a tough situation for
[1:20:42] you to be in that position that's got to
[1:20:43] be really really hard you got to be
[1:20:44] really tormented but you know what
[1:20:45] there's a jesus that can help you
[1:20:49] oh don't talk to me about jesus you're
[1:20:50] probably going to try to convince me on
[1:20:52] this i'm a murderer i'm not no no no no
[1:20:53] no no whatever decision you make you're
[1:20:55] going to need peace in your life
[1:20:57] and you'll never find it without christ
[1:21:01] and so well you just think i'm a
[1:21:02] murderer hey you know what we have we
[1:21:03] have an example in paul who was a
[1:21:05] murderer
[1:21:07] he killed christians
[1:21:10] he blasphemed
[1:21:12] and even our bible teaches us that a
[1:21:13] blasphemy will never enter the kingdom
[1:21:15] of god but yet one of our most
[1:21:16] outstanding writers of the new testament
[1:21:19] and the one who brought the gospel to
[1:21:20] the gentiles was paul the apostle paul
[1:21:22] he claimed to be a blasphemer and said
[1:21:24] he was a murderer so
[1:21:25] i'm not gonna be real hard on you
[1:21:31] do i just sound like a liberal to you
[1:21:34] if i do i'm sorry that's my fault
[1:21:38] but i hope that somehow you feel god
[1:21:40] beseeching you
[1:21:42] for the cause of christ
[1:21:44] let's stop being political out of it
[1:21:46] activist
[1:21:48] become advocates
[1:21:50] for him
[1:21:52] can we do that
[1:21:54] i know you're going to be good at it i
[1:21:56] know you already are you might say oh
[1:21:57] brilliant what made you think that we
[1:21:58] are ever card-carrying members of the
[1:22:00] republican party i i didn't think that
[1:22:01] at all
[1:22:03] but would you agree we recognize a
[1:22:04] spirit that's at work in the land today
[1:22:07] and how easily it kind of gets into
[1:22:09] our message theology
[1:22:10] [Music]
[1:22:12] and we almost make the message really
[1:22:14] pro-israel and pro-american
[1:22:17] and pro this and pro that when the
[1:22:19] message was really pro-christ and that
[1:22:21] solved all the issues brother luke we
[1:22:23] were just talking about it monday
[1:22:24] weren't we
[1:22:25] the distaste for politics in the church
[1:22:28] turns a lot of people away from church
[1:22:31] because they see the political agendas
[1:22:32] that rile up churches and the whole the
[1:22:34] pulpit becomes they'll even just come
[1:22:36] around now i can't endorse a candidate
[1:22:38] but let us invite to the platform
[1:22:41] a man that i think would make a good
[1:22:42] president
[1:22:44] right
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:50] let's stand
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:57] i'd like to make it again very clear
[1:22:59] that these authors i've mentioned
[1:23:02] these individuals that i've identified
[1:23:09] are not contraband or anti-christ in the
[1:23:12] sense that
[1:23:14] you know you're going to wear some
[1:23:16] scarlet letter if you've
[1:23:18] read them been benefited by them
[1:23:20] i just want you to recognize
[1:23:22] really
[1:23:24] where their home is
[1:23:26] and who their audience is
[1:23:28] and as believers we can benefit
[1:23:30] right
[1:23:31] as believers we can benefit through the
[1:23:33] tuning of the holy spirit from a lot of
[1:23:35] things songs can benefit us we can be
[1:23:36] listening to a podcast and someone could
[1:23:38] say something there's ways i know that
[1:23:41] elizabeth and i my wife and i have been
[1:23:42] benefited
[1:23:44] by some of these very authors that i
[1:23:46] wrote down how do i even know about it
[1:23:47] because i've read them we've had the
[1:23:49] books
[1:23:51] we've learned things from them
[1:23:53] but what i begin to realize is there's a
[1:23:56] lot of other things that go with it
[1:23:59] and if we see the word we can amend the
[1:24:01] word
[1:24:02] but we don't need to adopt the culture
[1:24:04] behind it
[1:24:06] and i just want you to recognize that
[1:24:07] dynamic that's been at work in our lives
[1:24:09] for many decades now that by these
[1:24:11] things that we have in common
[1:24:13] by partaking in this common culture we
[1:24:16] become we form bonds with like-minded
[1:24:18] consumers and so
[1:24:20] we
[1:24:21] we feel that these other people who are
[1:24:23] doing these same things like maybe we
[1:24:25] have this affinity with them and it
[1:24:27] forms the basis for a cultural identity
[1:24:30] so that when we have a lot of people in
[1:24:32] that same space who are taking great
[1:24:34] umbrage with some somebody something
[1:24:36] they do and they hate this athlete and
[1:24:38] they hate this decision they come
[1:24:40] against this actor and you have all
[1:24:42] these things that everyone's getting
[1:24:44] riled up and you find yourself getting
[1:24:45] riled up too
[1:24:47] i want you to take a deep breath and
[1:24:48] realize where it's coming from
[1:24:50] that's that's what i'm wanting to do is
[1:24:52] just recognize
[1:24:53] where it's coming from
[1:24:55] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:24:58] [Music]
[1:25:06] if you are witnesses too
[1:25:09] christ putting me your pastor on
[1:25:13] on the couch and doing a spiritual
[1:25:15] therapy
[1:25:16] conducting spiritual surgery with my
[1:25:18] heart
[1:25:19] and washing me of a lot of
[1:25:21] things that have clouded my judgment
[1:25:24] i thank you for your patience with me
[1:25:28] these things are going to make me a
[1:25:30] better pastor
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:25:35] i also believe that you being sincere
[1:25:37] christians also
[1:25:39] would want if there was anything in you
[1:25:41] that was
[1:25:43] this empty evangelicalism
[1:25:46] these empty political plat uh
[1:25:49] platforms and platitudes these any of
[1:25:51] these things if they would exist in your
[1:25:52] heart that you would desire to be washed
[1:25:57] there's a terminology in politics
[1:25:59] someone who's a centrist or a moderate
[1:26:01] democrat
[1:26:03] and there's this political spectrum
[1:26:06] can i ask you to step out of the
[1:26:07] political spectrum tonight
[1:26:09] let's not have any political identity
[1:26:17] if paul could ask us to pray for kings
[1:26:19] and those that are in authority that
[1:26:22] through our prayers we can lead
[1:26:23] christian lives
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:29] let's start with that
[1:26:30] [Music]
[1:26:33] unless desire that all men would be
[1:26:34] saved
[1:26:36] we know enough right to know that
[1:26:40] god a man can't come to god unless god
[1:26:43] draws him we understand the doctrine of
[1:26:45] election and predestination but
[1:26:49] i want somebody else to have the chance
[1:26:50] i've had
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:26:56] heavenly father
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:02] i'm
[1:27:02] wanting to restrain from being very
[1:27:05] personal myself
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:10] but you came to me
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:23] now lord let me come to those
[1:27:26] who are in need
[1:27:29] not to build a political coalition
[1:27:32] not to start a church
[1:27:35] build up another organization
[1:27:40] but that the gospel could be promoted
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:48] father's a young man brother
[1:27:50] victor who has a testimony of how his
[1:27:52] life was
[1:27:54] changed
[1:27:57] through the witness of a believer
[1:28:01] and then in love and concern for his
[1:28:04] cousin he advocated on his behalf that
[1:28:06] he would be given an opportunity to
[1:28:08] learn
[1:28:09] a similar profession that he had that
[1:28:10] had been the gateway in the doorway for
[1:28:12] his life to be changed
[1:28:14] and it's changed his cousin's life
[1:28:19] right now
[1:28:20] cousin may not be serving the lord but
[1:28:21] he's in a better place than he ever
[1:28:23] would have been without those
[1:28:24] interactions
[1:28:27] father i trust that somehow some way we
[1:28:29] could stop
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:32] promoting ourselves
[1:28:34] stop promoting our interest in our ideas
[1:28:37] and our churches and our theologies
[1:28:40] and promote you
[1:28:42] and be happy with that
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:45] and just stand in that channel in that
[1:28:48] grace
[1:28:50] lord i trust that i have a testimony
[1:28:52] before the people and that my record is
[1:28:54] clear that i'm not advocating for
[1:28:56] dumbing down the word of god and i'm not
[1:28:58] advocating for watering down our great
[1:29:00] truth but i can say in my heart that the
[1:29:02] opening of the word and the intimacy of
[1:29:04] the son of man that i'm experiencing in
[1:29:06] this hour has caused me to become more
[1:29:08] passionate about advocating for the
[1:29:10] purity of the word
[1:29:12] than just the pre the pretense
[1:29:16] of message
[1:29:17] messageology and
[1:29:19] message optics
[1:29:21] and i pray lord that we as a church who
[1:29:23] have this great opportunity being a year
[1:29:25] old
[1:29:27] we can be called out to drawn aside
[1:29:31] and become a living sacrifice
[1:29:35] be that young church of a year old that
[1:29:37] can be
[1:29:38] taken
[1:29:39] and be displayed as a token
[1:29:42] granite father i pray
[1:29:45] bless your people have been attentive
[1:29:46] and been diligent to
[1:29:48] remain with me through the the breadth
[1:29:50] of this sermon
[1:29:52] i commit the people to you now
[1:29:57] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:29:59] amen
