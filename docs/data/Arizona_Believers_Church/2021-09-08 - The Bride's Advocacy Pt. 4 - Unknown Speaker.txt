TRANSCRIPT
========================================
first timothy chapter two is where we'd like to read first timothy chapter two and read verses one to eight first timothy chapter two start with verse one and we'll read to verse eight we'll continue on the bride's advocacy i've included these scriptures in the slides brother john if you want to use these because i'm kind of admitting right now that i'm not gonna have time to get to my text and but i feel that it kind of forms the uh inspiration for the the particulars that we're going to be looking at and so if you don't have your bibles or if it makes it a little bit easier maybe to read it from the screen i want to be sure that we focus in together on these statements that paul is making as he writes to timothy in my bible the heading is prayers for all men and it says i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men that remarkable he said this is first of all for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty paul is telling the church to pray for kings and those that are authority presidents prime ministers congressmen senators governors mayors pray for them and that prayer is the means by which that we can effect change that as christians we can lead a quiet and peaceable life that's that's our first duty that pray for president biden right pray for him that play for the democratic senators and and the legislators that they would that we might be able to live peaceably as christians like that's that's our first course recourse that's our first and primary duty as christians and so he says for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior what is praying for these things prayers supplications intercessions for all men specifically for kings and those that are in authority that the christian the believer can lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty then he says in verse 4 who will have all men this is speaking of god who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time whereunto i am ordained a preacher and an apostle i speak the truth in christ and lie not a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity i will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath wrath and doubting these are these are powerful precepts these are very important things for us to consider as believers as paul is giving this instruction and then it's remarkable how he immediately goes into how a woman ought to adorn herself the behavior she should have qualifications for pastors qualifications for deacons warnings of false teachers and then how that we ought to uh be an example of the believer continues on how we ought to make provisions for widows and councils the younger to give honor to elders to honor your masters comes into the root of all evil and it's like it's out this outflow from this very things he's telling timothy that these are the things that we ought to hold true dear to our hearts and exhort that we pray for all men pray for those that are in authority and this is good and acceptable in the sight of the lord and he expresses these things and right in this conjunction of all this is we have one media between god and men he says this is what i'm pointing to this is the salvation for all men as jesus christ let's pray our heavenly father thank you for your presence which we feel already in this place we know that you are near and father i know from my vantage point as the one who is tasked with the burden of preparation for this service i see how you've dealt with my heart over a very long period of time i see how the devil tries to attack these things but father i pray that you would have the preeminence and may there be a a spirit of clarity in our hearts that we don't muddy things up with our own personal opinions may myself lord may i be withheld restrained by the holy ghost to not inject any carnality into this but that we might stay very faithful to your heart may that be conveyed lord pray that you amplify these things which we have already read that it might form kind of the basis for the things that we're going to minister tonight as i believe there's something important for us to catch bless your people now bless the word which we have read in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask this amen you can be seated we continue on the bride's advocacy and i asked brother michael for to give me kind of get me up a little bit early and i think that um he probably would have had me up about this time anyways because you guys very quickly got into the channel uh from my vantage point i'll say this you don't necessarily have to agree with me so in the end you may say well that wasn't really profound and i would accept that but for me what i want to share tonight i believe is going to be really eye-opening that there's some eye-opening things in this and i so if i if you could and i know just as uh as we do on wednesday nights maybe we feel a little bit more comfortable a little bit smaller crowd i trust that you can be very very focused and kind of stay with me because there might be certain things that i say and then as soon as i say it you might you might try to force that in a particular paradigm that you're used to it being dealt with or it might kind of conjure up certain ideas and what i want you to do is just really labor to catch the mind of god now i'm not even trying to figure out what my opinion is or what my take is but really just try to catch the mind of god on these things uh someone mentioned to me the other that when i had the slide up last week of the we believe in that first slide that we used that people started getting nervous and i don't mind if people get nervous because that means they're at least paying attention to the subject matter and uh but i wouldn't want you to get nervous on any of these things but i i would hope that we could open up our hearts for the lord to correct us to kind of balance us to smooth this out to make us a little bit more razor sharp there's a quote that i often and i don't i might still have it here i cleaned out my notebook the other day and um maybe left some a quote i often carried to the pulpit that brother branham makes this statement that a pastor must always be looking for things and and follow the holy spirit to catch things even in their infancy to block the people's minds from certain things and some of the things i i feel impressed to speak on tonight i would say these things i'm not a paul revere saying they're coming they're coming they're already here and maybe we just need to be able to appreciate some of the context within the word so i'm going to give some try to go very quickly on foundation just catching up some of the things from the last three services and make reference to revelations 22 17 according to revelations 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come according to revelations 10 uh verse 11 uh there is a thou must prophesy again and do many uh unto the unto the world and these scriptures tell us that we have a public ministry and this public ministry is advocacy that's public active support for a particular cause this is public support and it's active support so it can't just be a belief that you hold in your hearts it has to be something public and it has to be active and when the scripture says thou must prophesy again which we see in type of the bride it means to plead it speaks of pleading the cause of god this phrase this word is used of those that would plead the cause of god and then urge others to be saved so this is cont this is contained in this thou must prophesy again that we readily accept to be the bride john being a type of the bride in this instance that there is this um pleading the cause of god that must prophesy again and it's uh uh and even joining that with revelations 22 17 our words the things we say and our actions the life we live they say come it's declaring come to many peoples nations tongues and kings and so we are identifying how that we are the final voice of god in the last days this is our calling this is our commission and therefore as the final voice we must advocate for christ not for ourselves not not for um some sort of one particular cause but we advocate for christ so in looking at ourselves as advocates for christ it's not self-promotion so you're you're not looking to vindicate that you're right you're not looking to find substantiate what you believe or prove that you've had things figured out so it's not self-promotion it's not the promotion of any particular personality and it's not the promotion of a church advocacy for christ is not the promotion of a particular church and because we can we could really confuse those matters because if if advocating for christ means that we we were promoting a particular church then it probably would mean that we would all have to advocate for the same church there would be a conflict dentist well i'm advocating for christ no what we what we do is uh i'm advocating for christ so i'm advocating for my church i'm advocating for a church what we do when we invite people to church we invite people to church so they can come and have an experience with the word not not so that they can uh take a place in a pew and not so that they can be identified uh among us or start giving and become a giving unit or that we can say that we've had a a one a soul to the lord but those those things uh winning a soul to lord there's something that we we're wrapped up in that there's certainly a reward in that but our objective is we invite people to church and we say come and see and we labor to see that we're creating the right atmosphere in the service we desire to have our own facility so we can make it just exactly like we want it and i believe that we ought to evangelize by inviting people to church but remember your goal in inviting people to church is to give a personal experience with the word and if that begins to happen then just watch god deal with that person's heart and and god may move in them and deal with them and you invite them to come to church and have a personal experience with the word and they're like man i've met god this is the truth i love the lord i want to serve them and you're like awesome this is great we've got we've got you know somebody else who's going to be coming to church now we get all excited like so i'm going to move back to where i came from i want to go back to my where i grew up i want to go back to my family and and i and i just want to that's how i'm feeling led and also we start getting all locked up like well wait a minute no i mean how could you do this have confidence in a word experience that if they genuinely had an experience with the word that god's going to deal with their heart and lead them and guide them so we're even we're not even promoting church in and of itself but we promote church because our church provides an opportunity to have an experience with the word now quickly i want to point out how we've been using paul as an example i think at least in the last two services and perhaps in the first service on the bride's advocacy how he was following the example of christ and that paul is saying i become all things to all men and i do things that please all men not that i would ever do something contrary to the word but i condescend myself to others for the sake of the word and some of the gospel for the gospel sake and he does it so that others might be saved and in that context he's he's saying this is my example this is my example he says you should follow my example that you conduct yourself in such a way to where at all times you can be a channel that god can use to impact someone's life for salvation and for the blessings of the gospel and he makes this statement in first corinthians 10 24 let no man seek his own as christ didn't do things for his own prophet seek his own will try to trump up himself he says let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth now i know in reading that it might seem let no man seek after his own riches but look at seek after another man's riches like i'm trying to get a little bit of yours let me borrow some money but rather it speaks of a man's welfare you should seek after look out after or be concerned about another's welfare and in the context is paul is putting be concerned about their soul maybe not so much concerned about their diet so much concerned about their financial well-being but very at the end of the day being more concerned about their soul and we express this many times when we have a loved one who is sick and we say we're praying that god would heal them they're facing a very difficult surgery they have stage four cancer and we say we're praying that god would heal them more importantly that their eyes would be open to the lord and we're and we're right in that because ultimately we would have a peace knowing that an unsaved loved one even though they died with cancer prior to them dying they had a genuine experience with the lord and they found salvation so paul is saying that we should be concerned about others other souls and we and maybe i'm trying to think of way that we could capture these things how he was we're being exhorted in the word of god to consider what we say and how we live and uh and moderate our conduct and our behavior and even our words in light of how our actions and our words may hinder someone in coming to christ and then even in the way that we can moderate our behavior and our words to help someone come to christ so we're not just merely living a particular way because the word says so but the word actually has the right kind of way to be the right kind of light and if you ponder even what the purpose of fruit is in terms of why is there this nice flesh and this edible flesh that surrounds a seed it's not so much so that the birds and the animals and different ones can enjoy the fruit but the fruit is what attracts the attention of one who's going to take that seed ultimately take the seed and allow it to propagate somewhere else because an animal or human is attracted to the fruit and they eat the fruit and the seed is left behind but what does it do it allows that seed to find ground away from the plant to to find root and to grow so the fruit of a christian isn't so that we can just declare to everybody that we're better and more holy but there ought to be something about the way we live that becomes an attraction to others and then when they want to partake of that fruit they're going to get the seed and there's a seed inside of them that's drawing them to that and the statement that really has been um very impactful to me has been this in the unveiling of god speaking of jesus christ he says he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die to the traditions and things that's there's a lot that's meant in that let us die to traditions let us die to things to reveal him to others die to the the denominations to reveal him to others so we died of self we died of traditions we died in denominations we died of different things and the sake of this death is so that we can we can reveal him to others so we have an important part to play in the faith to faith and christ being made known by others and i'll say this i hadn't maybe pondered saying this but these services have been very impactful for me personally and there may be some apology necessary if you all have become the spectator in god dealing with my heart but even sunday i just felt like god just really exposed something in my personal life that i have to a large extent it's easy for me to get distracted by those that are distracted and you see everybody distracted by something and i'm over here can you believe all these people who are distracted can you believe all these people being distracted and it really convicted me to realize that there's a point at which identifying those people who are distracted can become a distraction in itself and that you've got to come back to the real kernel of truth to come back to christ being what is the focus christ being the center and i just feel in my heart this afternoon i thought this message is more precious to me than it's ever been it's more relevant to me than it's ever been it's so perfectly identifies every weakness in laodicea and gives us an answer for it and so as it's already maybe been sensed my part of what has been god has been dealing with me on and something that i've been studying for quite some time and it's been it's formed kind of a little bit of a thrust in the the direction of the bride's advocacy is there is a caution if there's a caution against political activism i want you to ponder that a little bit or a conflict against conflating political causes with the cause of christ or confusing maybe i could use that word that i want us to be very careful about becoming political activist and be very careful that we don't confuse certain political causes as being synonymous with or in harmony with the cause of christ so there's a way that it can be something can be presented to us and we're like oh well that's what christ would say or that's what christ would advocate for so we kind of we sign the dotted line and we join in some particular movement because we see that it seems to further some sort of christian ideal we need to be very very careful with that and i want to use the example tonight of how the political advocacy and political activism and since i see them as in some ways being synonymous has taken over the evangelical world anybody heard the term evangelical it's taken over the evangelical world in a lot of ways christianity and the protestants and so this is gonna give some definitions maybe just to help myself out but also to know that we're on the same page and what we're looking at to be inves evangelical means of or according to the teaching of the gospel or of according to the christian religion so if something is evangelical then it pertains to the christian religion it's not going to be pertaining to hinduism or or islam it pertains to the christian religion more particularly it's something that's of the gospel or it's a teaching according to the teaching of the gospel so there is kind of a branch of product the protestant religion or christian religion or protestant the protestant churches that would be considered evangelical so in looking at evangelicalism i was able to and people use this terminology so it's very precise to be able to kind of come up with certain things that are the the main tenets of what how you'd be identified as an evangelical there's kind of like the mainstream uh protestants very traditional beliefs and different things but with evangelicals they seem to be more clear in what they believe and more ardent about certain things and so they believe the bible is without air i think the terminology of the use of the bible isn't inerrant and so this is something that maybe uh even some modern churches or maine mainstream protestants would would look at the book of the bible as being the the god's word but yet uh maybe more informative as an allegory or something that we can use as a moral code whereas evangelicals would say the bible is the word of god it was without error secondly they would believe that salvation is only through christ there's no other salvation except through jesus christ and then number three that salvation is by a personal born-again experience that an individual must be converted and they have to have an experience of being born again and terminologies can vary among different evangelicals but in general they believe that there is a individual personal conversion and then number four may be the most outstanding aspect of all this they believe the bible is inerrant they believe it's without air they believe salvation is only through christ you must be born again individually and personally and then number four spread these beliefs to evangelize and that's kind of what kind of gives us in this terminology of being evangelical is that you you should be advocating for these truth the bible is perfect there's only salvation through jesus christ and you as an individual must recognize yourself a sinner and you must be converted you must have a born-again experience so those are just some general things that would identify evangelicalism now slow down when i say that because it'd be very very easy to slip into some sort of lisp and get you all laughing at me now in general i don't think any of us would object to that right if somebody would just if we found this you know written on a piece of paper we could say ah i can see that a word i can see that the word i can see that in the word and even brother branham uses the phrase evangelical um in his ministry a number of times and he identified even the full gospel businessmen's meetings as being inter-evangelical and how they were kind of interdenominational they didn't look upon any denominational lines but they held these certain truths together and they believed in these certain things and they came upon they came together on that basis and when he preaches shalom in january of 1964 he says my doctrine i don't preach doctrine out here nothing but just great evangelical fundamentals because i'm with brethren that might different with me and i i don't give that his doctrine out before the people here and it's being very deliberate to say there's things that i would preach at home and things about the seals and things about different those things that he might not preach in these types of meetings he says i just try to stay on the real fundamentals of the scripture such as what we believe and what he's identifying is kind of the pure the pure idea of being evangelical that regardless of what denomination you were regardless of whether you're a pentecostal or methodist or baptist you could agree that the bible is the word of god you could agree that salvation is through jesus christ you could agree that there's a born-again experience whether that comes through the baptism of the holy ghost or merely by confession you could agree that we ought to as churches be preaching this gospel so he's kind of identifying what would be the pure uh evangelical fundamentals of the scripture yet the evangelicals is you can identify even when the message they were already beginning to take on different goals these things weren't necessarily the the pure motives of the evangelicals because at the turn of the 19th century evangelicalism was even christianity if i could say that in particular was becoming more patriotic more masculine and more political these are the things that begin to really emerge uh and i've just been doing my study in this and been looking into these things and trying to identify some of the source of these things and you realize that there are certain themes that begin to be predominate within christianity in america and within the evangelical movement that things are really tied to uh the nationalism and and and masculinity and became very very political and let me say this without getting into the history of that because i believe the message of the hour really begins to identify a lot of these things let me just say i feel that the change is complete that if there was a there was something that began to happen at the turn of the century before the century was over this movement had almost become purely political and now evangelical is more of a political label than it is a a label that would identify what brand of theology you have and this is um this is i think it's important for us to ponder this to be evangelical if you told somebody that you're evangelical anybody would probably begin to identify more political causes than they would think oh they believe the bible is the word of god they believe salvation is only through jesus christ and they believe you have to have a born-again experience they would think more in terms of activism and this has been something that's been taken place over many many decades to arrive to this point i think you could even go back to the or some of the early evangelists in the 1900s and a lot of different ways movements were starting and even youth for christ and these different things took on certain tones and began to try to support certain things and and moderate certain policies but i feel that there was this transition and let's just all admit it now that mainstream christianity in america became untethered they lost their absolute they lost their way and so they move with political forces they move with the force of laodicea they move with the spirit of the age and so i'm i don't want you to get tense and think oh are you saying that we're a godless country and that you know there's nobody has been right instead of just hold very tight to what i'm trying to say but i do think there's things that we can agree on that we already believe that this just substantiates realize yes that's that's what's been happening in the church world today this is why so many people have such terrible experiences in churches anymore is it's no longer feeding the hunger for christ it's more dealing with these uniquenesses about our convictions and our thoughts and opinions on things and so this i want to use the example of jerry falwell our friend and brother jerry falwell who and i'm just going to kind of skip to the point he's not a friend uh so i don't want you to think all of a sudden we didn't know you were close to him but in 1979 how many have heard the name jerry falwell maybe not so much in our day and age but kind of a lightning rod for criticism really a bold speaker on certain issues he was a baptist and in 1979 after a very long time of uh having radio shows and and building that the church there in lynchburg virginia and then having this vision to have a school and establishing his education and things and a very large ministry he founded what was called the moral majority and that sounded very humble the moral majority and it's basically a right-wing political uh organization it was part of a right-wing political movement called the moral majority and so in studying this i found some excerpts that i thought would be kind of good to help summarize uh where i'm coming from are you comfortable tonight i feel very very comfortable my pace is going to be maybe a little bit different i'm going to be a little bit more deliberate but there's some things here i believe they're going to be eye-opening for you very helpful they said that falwell moved from a separatist stance that taught that god controls everything including politics to one that required human action to fulfill god's intended destiny for america so now the christian now has this conviction that god has a destiny for america and that as christians in america as americans and christians we have the duty to steer the direction of the government to impact government on all levels so that america fulfills its destiny as god's chosen nation of christendom and whereas before you might have had our founding fathers that wanted to create a separation of church and state so that church is a is a one has the liberty to serve god how they would want to serve god and you'd have this dichotomy between your religion and church and state and government would ideally be led by people who are exercising their freedom of religion and start worshiping the one true god and that would be the separate to stance that has this scriptural perspective that god is the one that puts people in power god is the one that works in the hit behind the curtain in these hidden springs that puts people in place and he's the one that's over all of it and i can do more than my civic duty and can't do any more than fulfill god's purpose for my life and pray for those who are in authority that i might lead a quiet and peaceable life as a christian and in all godliness and honesty but then this is just one example of christianity now in the evangelicals of the protestant religion moving into political activism and believing that human action was required so that america fulfills its destiny that god intends for them and this is another excerpt it says behind the idea of the moral majority was this notion this is the thought and the idea behind it that there could be a coalition of these different religious groups that all agree on abortion and homosexuality and other issues even if they never agreed on how to read the bible or the nature of god so they in terms of how to read the bible the nature of god scripture in particular is saying that there was this idea that as the moral majority we could kind of have this uh non-denominational interdenominational organization that's a political organization that creates a coalition of different religious groups that can identify these certain causes that they agree on and they may not agree on whether or not the bible's the word of god they may not even agree whether or not jesus christ is the salvation through him alone or even believe that there's a born-again experience but we can agree that we don't like abortion we don't like homosexuality we have these other issues that we all agree on and we kind of form this agenda of these agendas that we can all agree on regardless of what our differences are yeah we're never going to see eye to eye on jesus christ we're never going to see eye to eye on baptism we're never going to see eye to eye on the nature of god but we can agree on these things are you following me so far now i trust that you being seasoned believers and i look out in the congregation today and i see everyone who's well taught um solid believers i mean we're already hearing it that way we're kind of like well if you put it that way it's alarming isn't it and so these agendas still live and so now there's still kind of this simple agenda for the evangelicals and even though the moral majority kind of folded in the 80s it is almost as if it had reached this tipping point to where now there didn't necessarily need to be the moral majority it it politics had reached its tipping point for even this is what's remarkable i'm almost getting sidetracked pray for me jimmy carter was an evangelical he was a christian man and a decent person and the moral majority pushed ronald reagan a hollywood movie star to become president because the platform the politics of the party and and who they who they could steer in the direction they wanted things to go and so now you have this interdenominational right-wing political movement that endorses a candidate against someone who would have been more theologically aligned with christians in order to get the right politician in office to pass the legislation that christians would want on a national level and so it still holds true today where i actually heard it said one time when i was researching these things that evange to be an evangelical has more to do with getting a republican in office than it is to tell the story of christ i know you're thinking what does this have to do with the message just be patient with me you've lasted a year with me let's make it one more service at least there's kind of this simple agenda that it can be distilled down to are you are you staying are you with me right now i want from the youngest to the oldest i want i want maybe to be listening it's pro-life pro-traditional family pro-moral pro-israel pro-america so this is the voice of the moral majority this is the voice of the evangelicals this is the voice of the now politically motivated church because what is what does it ultimately end up in a union between church and state ecclesiastical and ecumenical this this joining together of church and state that's what it's going to head up in and so certainly these things are already transpiring right certainly things are already coming together on a particular level and so now you have a political platforms that begin to identify themselves as pro-life and these were hot button topics and decades gone by and they may not get as much air time anymore but you have pro-family and pro-morality and i want you to really ponder this too pro-israel because and i'm being very if i could say this as a pastor i'm speaking these things i find sometimes there's this is israeli nationalism and israeli loyalty that is so fervent it's hard for me to see how that comes from the message and it it it seems to be so extreme with respect to this pro-israel approach that it it echoes more of the sentiments of well-named evangelical ministries today than it does the ministry that we sit under and so there's i'm saying that as a caution to some of these things that have become a part of our our thought process and our theology we can start to think well where what's the origin of these things what's the source of it and then also this agenda became very pro-america this uh this christian nationalism where you know for this for america for the flag and for these certain things about america and if we looked at it in that way what a an amazing affront a statement like don't even pray for america she's lost i mean just imagine if you said that to some of the flag waving people today who are america america and you say oh no i don't even pray for any more they'd say well you don't even pray you know you're a devil because there's this idea that has conflated patriotism with christianity so what is missing kind of like look at the picture we're not actually maybe we could play uh where is waldo with this pro-life pro family promo pro-israel pro-america what's missing there's never a pro-christ like in the very in the in the politics oh well brother aaron it's assumed and oh well it's in this but i i would even challenge and say well is it really is it not in the arena of politics and would not is a politician uh you know above using your religious convictions to get you to support them for office and a lot of politicians over several decades have morphed into being these evangelical fervent supporters of christianity and it's a political ploy and they'll even change their name so they can appeal more to this evangelical base and what's missing is christ they never are pro-christ which pro in the latin means it's a prefix for right four pro means four there's no for christ what they are is for family values and so their definition of family values and therefore american values those things without being explicit now have served as a substitute for christian values and we give them this label oh family values are christian values american values are christian values but let me ask you this what does that mean for the believer in norway what does that mean for the believer in china who's told by the government you can't have more than so many children what does this mean for believers in countries that have social medicine and they can't homeschool and they have socialist governments and they have they're under communism what does this mean for them to be able to fully step into the mature maturing of their faith and be perfect christians when where they live is not america and so then christianity begins to take on a brand or label as being pro-america it becomes it almost becomes anti-scriptural when we we identify america in the bible in revelations 13. and so what's missing is not family values not american values not being pro-moral moral or pro-choice or even pro-israel standing with israel and recognizing israel's being god's chosen people it's replaced christian values and i i want to suggest to you now for you to ponder and let me posit this could it be that christian values is what would promote promote the value of the family and the true values of family we don't need to define redefine what a family is and legislate what a family is in order to have healthy families we just need to promote the virtues of christianity and let the word have preeminence in people's lives and that's what's going to make a family secure the government saying that we define marriage between one man and one woman didn't make families better it just meant some guys were responsible for a lot of different families i've been married four times i've been just spawning this definition and cletus has got four or five different ex-wives and having a bunch of kids and thinks that he's a family man because we define family as a marriage between a man and a woman and so what's missing is christ in second corinthians chapter 5 20 paul says now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us saying god beseeched you why did he be by me god spoke to you through my through my ministry through my prophetic gift god paul saying this now as though god did beseech you by us i am an ambassador who came to you ordained by god to speak to you as one who is sent from god to beseech you to do something he says we pray you in christ's stead be reconciled to god in the office of christ in the stead of christ in his footsteps even in his office as it were we are beseeching you to be reconciled to god and paul identifies himself as an ambassador pro-christ a pro-christ ambassador not not pro-family pro-life pro-israel pro uh well pro-rome i guess couldn't say pro-america for not pro-spain i mean he talked about going to spain i mean he was wasn't propane or anything pro he was he was pro-christ and and ambassador is speaking maybe a term of rank but it speaks of an office and it refers to be acting as a representative so when paul says i'm an ambassador for christ i represent christ i'm an advocate for christ i'm not advocating for it necessary for the morals that he advocated for and i'm not necessarily saying oh well you know what i agree with what christ taught about finances and you know what i agree what he said about marriage and you know what i agree about what he said about this and it's not that he had christ all the letter of what christ taught he says you know what that fits my that kind of scratches my itch that fits my my political agenda and then he became pro all the tenants of christ he became pro-christ and that kind of covered it all he wouldn't need to give you his position on every single little doctrine because being pro-christ would assume that whatever's in the nature of christ whatever's in the heart of god whatever's in the word of god is what i live by what i abide by so i don't need to distill down what my platform is i have safety i'm saying i'm for christ whatever he's for i'm for whatever he's against i'm against and so notice how jesus uses the term ambassador it's used as ambassador the same kind of word conjugated here but i use this only so you can recognize what it means to be an ambassador and so that we're not getting lost are the evangelicals ambassadors for christ in the way that they've uh they're motivated and the platforms that they're pursuing and compare it now to paul said i'm an ambassador for christ jesus says in luke 14 31-32 what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand and this is where or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassador and desireth conditions of peace a king who's gonna have battle while the enemy is yet far away knowing that he's outnumbered sends an embassage ambassador literally coming from to send a message the word is actually translated the message elsewhere when jesus was speaking it means to send a message to have this ambassador it's an office of an ambassador who is on a mission sent by a ruler on a mission official government business so then who is paul saying that he acts officially on behalf of when he says that i'm an ambassador for christ as though god himself beseeched you through me because in christ's stead be ye reconciled to god so he's saying i have been officially sent by god to tell you that he wants to reconcile with you i have a ministry of reconciliation preaching the word of god that you be reconciled to him and god has sent me as an ambassador to send a message it has to do with sending a message and in this place where i'm on a mission sent by a ruler and he doesn't place his loyalty with any particular government any particular uh leader or ruler whether it be in rome or whether it be in israel or whether it be in any other power anywhere else he says i am an ambassador of christ and that's what we are just as jesus is saying the king would send an ambassador we are ambassadors of the king let this become more than just maybe cliches of the christian faith or something that you could hear on a sunday morning on the gospel radio hour we are advocates for the cause of christ this is our advocacy this is our voice we we are for christ evangel have you ever do you know what that word means evangelical evangelicalism evangelist they all have this root evangel which means in the greek the good news and i don't believe that i'm shocking anybody today that's not fox right or newsmax or some sort of moderate news or washington examiner or the wall street journal the good news is the gospel so evangel in its very etymology the word itself means where we get evangelist from who is a bringer or a spreader of the good news evangelist one who preaches the gospel and so evangel means the gospel evangelical would mean it has something to do with the gospel to be an evangelist has something to do with the gospel with the good news that's what it ought to mean but yet this has changed now because paul says in philippians 1 27 this is very rich only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of christ conversation means live the life that you live to administer affairs or to be a citizen only let your citizenship and your acting as a citizen be as such as becometh the gospel of christ in our citizenry we do not promote the the the health and welfare of the government above the health and welfare of my christian life so it says only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel that is what's motivating that whether i come to see you or else be absent i may hear of your affairs conduct yourself live in a way that is worthy of the gospel so that when i hear about your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together to elect faithful politicians uh living bible again let me find i read it wrong strive one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel what what what is the one thing we can all agree on the faith of the gospel paul says in romans 1 16 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth who would that be jew or greek the gospel of christ is the gospel is christ it's the gospel of christ you cannot use gospel and that be some sort of ambiguous word it speaks of the good news it speaks of christianity evangel speaks of the gospel of christ and paul is saying that he is a true evangelical because he wants to promote the faith of the gospel he wants the gospel of christ to be spread because it is the power of god that's originally how paul is espousing the virtues of christianity this is originally what evangel would mean it would mean the gospel the good news the spreading of the message of christ the christian christianity has been co-opted by politics whereas politics is using it now it's been co-opted by man-made traditions where we look at an organized religion and it's become more about the denominations and organization organizations than it has been about the message of christ and it's been used to serve carnal agendas again don't think that christianity the gospel and you have no further to read the new testament to find that men will use the gospel to their advantage to promote themselves and use it in a way to further their agendas as opposed to purely and without guile promoting the virtues of christ and as we are preaching in america i want us to consider how that especially in america christianity has politicians have kind of catered to christianity and manipulate it in a way in such a way to use it for their own agendas and we have to we shouldn't just be trusting of politics to think that when they when they say something that seems to be virtuous that they stand for the virtue itself and let me say there is there is this culture of americana christianity probably the more appropriate way to be able to spell is without the first a a culture of america christianity that we've got to be very discerning of we need to be very very careful that we not be kind of caught into this angel of light phenomena where it has the sound of the shepherd but if you pause for your mom be like oh boy you're that was slick that was tricky and we've got to be very very careful and this is where take a deep breath i want you to ponder this very very deeply evangelicalism has created a culture an americana a culture of american christianity evangelicalism has become a culture and it has commercialized that culture and it sells it can i get a witness hey where's that nord organ and micah hammering down on some of those flats over a minor fourth when i needed this is something to ponder evangelicalism has become cultural and it's become commercialized now it's an economy now it's sold and so conservative evangelical is more about culture than it is about doctrine conservative evangelical is more about culture than it is theology and this culture that i'm referring to produces thousands of different religious products thousands and thousands of different religious services and it's consumed by millions of people this is a culture that produces content services and products and it's consumed by millions and millions of people books magazines music cc and music and radio television films conferences blogs even home decor right that's being produced by this uh this brand of christianity and there's books you can buy magazines bookstores music radio television films conferences blogs home decor clothing shirts t-shirts bumper stickers and we have certain things that become staples of now and i'm speaking to us look i'm not lecturing i'm not lecturing the neighbor next door who's a died on the wall you know you know hour of grace john mcarthur bible carrion kind of guy i'm not that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about even for us to where radio shows and programs that are produced by focus on the family have a very big presence in our lives i'm not preaching against these things i'm not mentioning them and maybe we can all acknowledge yeah you know what focus on the family gets airtime and maybe not all of us but some of us watch a lot of veggie tales and and we find ourselves um humming you know silly songs by larry and then we have family life radio that we listen to and boy what a rebuke for those of us who have xm or sirius the only message we listen to anymore and we have lifeway uh christian bookstores and these different things and even when it comes to education we have certain educational curriculums that are very christian focused and bible-based and if we homeschool our kids we can be part of homeschool coalitions and homeschool groups and they all kind of take this theme of it's a christian homeschool group this is a christian educational curriculum it has bible classes and we all begin to promote the liberty way right because it also is an education where it's like when it comes to food i can eat at chick-fil-a and i can buy one to hold in the refrigerator till sunday and i can and i can get my education from a becca and pensacola christian college and i can go to liberty uh and i can do distance correspondence courses through liberty and all our all our lives as message believers we can feel all these different areas entertainment for our kids and evening time entertainment thank god for kurt cameron we've got all these things that we can do that are all evangelical christian based right and just put it in man christian dub foundation signed off on it and think about the voices that we listen to lock the door so no one can get in but more importantly that no one can get out someone told me one time i don't want you to stop the tape but someone told me one time they heard a message preacher say stop the tape i'm fixing to cuss and i thought wow that's shocking i'm not about to cuss but what kind of voices are we listening to everybody everybody trusts me at this point that i i i i'm going to be honest with you the voices of gary ezell gary chapman michael pearl or debbie pearl elizabeth elliott sally clarkson tim or beverly lahaye and maybe you don't recognize any of these but you might recognize some of their books about love languages and to train up a child and different ways that these authors and these writers and uh tim lahaye and beverly lahaye and all these people they produce content books and seminars and things for us to read now you could say brother aaron are you preaching against it no i'm wanting you to become aware of a lot of different things that you that we inform us and we read and begin to form maybe subconsciously certain convictions were tied post in our lives and by doing this this is the part that i really want to shake you and get your attention all of this production and consumption in all these different forms and mediums and all these voices are listening to cause us to partake in a common culture because it's not just message believers that read sally clarkson right because you're not her audience it's not just message believers that read gary chapman's love languages it's not just message people who are digging in to train up a child or and growing kids god's ways and these things it's not just message believers who have these things and have kept these things going they have their own theology they have their own doctrine they have their own convictions they have their own failed marriages and dysfunctional families but yet they present to you this clean polished theology in that we wholesale or digest it come on somebody we're digesting it and it becomes a part of our conviction part of the way we treat our children and part of the way that we treat one another and part of the way that we want to create this we want to replicate the perfect instagram life that sarah clarkson has in our own lives and we're frustrated when it doesn't work out she has time to be the perfect wife and be the perfect mother and the perfect homeschool mom and i don't even really know all her story and does seminars and everything and i can just barely get school done and do laundry and you feel convicted like wow that's been a real virtuous ministry for you right i want you to think about the images that you're feeding on the images that you're seeing and it causes all of us not just message believers but everyone who is evangelical everyone who's a real christian are eating these same things and when that happens we form bonds with like-minded consumers we're all partaken in the same culture we form bonds with like-minded consumers and therefore form the basis of a shared cultural identity where the reason why we get caught up in a lot of these different things anymore is because we've been consuming the same content we all watched the same kurt cameron movie we all watched the chosen we all watched this we all listened to that we all downloaded that app we've all been watching veggie tales we've all been listening to focus on the family we all been listening to adventures in odyssey we've all been reasonably the same uh christian love novels and love comes softly and this movie will never end and whatever all these names are and we've been feeding all that so then whenever we seem to kind of be aligning ourselves with mainstream christianity in the evangelical right maybe we're not doing it because we've all been feeding on the same revealed word maybe it's happened because we formed this cultural identity by all the things that we've been consuming i found this statement the products christians consume shape the faith they inhabit the products that the christian that christians consume shape the faith they inhabit therefore when paul says that we're striving together for the faith of the gospel many are striving for the faith of the gospel but it's become another and think about it this speaks of the evangelicals i want to just kind of slip this in there how are the mainstream protestants the traditionalists the the fundamentalists gonna come together to unite with the evangelicals i mean this is a pretty aggressive platform and how are you going to get everyone do you how are they going to how are these people being kind of massaged together it's remarkable i want to continue just to win friends and influence people this evening but there's different preachers out there tim lahaye james dobson bill gothard many many others i could mention that preach a message of fear to serve a political agenda whether it be blood moons or oncoming apocalypse or things in israel and all these different things they preach a gospel of fear and they do it to serve a political agenda and often they do it to serve to create this reliance upon them for prophetic insight and for the explanation of what's happening in the world and so there's a lot of things that become uh these these seeds are sown through these seminars and programs and we get real tied into a certain way of seeing things we get real tied into a certain way of raising children get tied into a certain way of um educating our children all these different ways but to a lot of these ministries the seed behind it the thought behind it is to preach a message of fear because they're trying to serve some sort of personal agenda or political agenda and what do they preach fear communism fear big government fear socialism fear feminism fear homosexuals fear muslims fear immigrants right why are you getting all caught quiet on me you ain't scared any of those are you we shouldn't be we don't have to fear communism have we not been explicitly taught do not fear communism yet what is what is a lot of the things that's promoted these days to get us to motivate us to act politically you better be afraid of socialism you better be afraid of communism they're going to drag us right back to you know to nazi germany and we've been taught we shouldn't be fearing any of those isms this idea of being anti-big government to be fear big government to fear feminism to fear liberalism to fear homosexuals to fear immigrants all those fears i i hope i'm not offending anybody i'm wanting you to consider what was the source of that because my bible doesn't teach me to hate any of those classes my bible doesn't teach me to fear any of those classes my bible teaches me to fear god it's my fear of god that causes me to abhor sin and to recognize the dangers of any ideal that does not promote the virtues of christ and all christian america is united under these political causes there's this forced unity and what is it it's a false image of christ there's no camera on you maybe you don't want to say amen too loud but if if you can say if you can i want you to indicate some sign of that the lord this is positive for you tonight raise your hand if it's positive for you tonight i'm going to read one two three four five six seven quotes did good i usually count by 500 but i was able to fight seven quotes i think that was right they're lengthy too a little bit but it's 8 16. i think i told the people last time that i began preaching at 7 20 it's or it's 8 20 it's now 8 16. it's like hey man preaching the gospel you just move anywhere you want in time but i be it's 8 16 right now i begin preaching at 8 20. once again i have managed to go backwards in time and listen to these statements and stay very very close because i trust that you have enough confidence in me to know at this point that i probably have something very precise in the message of the hour that if you dug your heels in too hard you're going to find yourself arguing with the word to maintain your personal agenda in this matter in the message the reproach for the cause of the word it's the only quote that i'm going to use that's pre 63 that's pre-seals i believe i believe it was preached in phoenix some about the the reproach for the cause of the lord is actually talking about the uh the light that came in there out in the first coming of christ he says that's what and how the wise men came and they said they didn't come from they were following the star they were following the light and as soon as they came in jerusalem like the star disappeared brother brown's bringing this parallel how in this religion in organized religion in this denominational viewpoint the light's put out you got to get away from that to see the light so that's what puts many a light out that's right is getting hooked up with such a group as that they don't even believe it in the first place and how are we going to have a union of churches how are we going to walk together except we be agreed now ponder this how are we going to get methodists to unite with charismatic christians how are we going to get snake handling uh uh you know backwoods pentecostals to to join hands with the catholics what is going to force this union how is the fellowship of the world why all the churches united churches of the world how we gonna unite together when we are million miles apart very very profound observation brother branham how are we going to do it evangelicals with us this that and that and all together and yet united together with such a bunch of corruption and where did he recognize corruption politics are corrupt this is corrupt that's corrupt there had there's got to be some way to force this union and what did he always say it was it was a unit of church and state so now he's saying the evangelicals will unite together in every other church with a bunch of corruption i'm going to skip around i wanted to i wanted to put this i labored to put it in a way in an order that would kind of edify you and not just be reading it chronologically but you could see that this thought build here now he says in 1964 we have trouble in our churches now you think do you not think that there'd be some amplification of it today then notice it and it's genesis how prophet is discerning this we have denominational troubles arguments in our churches we don't know what's going to take place we have a great thing forming up there all of us believers in the bible see something is fixing to take place there's nobody but knows that but what knows that and all the churches are going to be brought into that ecumenical council of churches now let me say this and you're probably going to read ahead well good i stopped it in a perfect spot that don't you think it would be subtle right don't you have to be okay maybe you disagree maybe no maybe it'll just be obvious like the devil is going to say hey come on my side guys but it's going to be very very subtle like they're going to join into this thinking we are doing what's right according to the bible and they're going to feel like you know what god i know that we believe in baptism in jesus name but you know what i can lay that aside and join my arms together with this person who doesn't even believe in the divinity of jesus christ and we can unite our powers together you know to be able to at least promote morality at least we can promote the right ideals to sanctify society and how are they going to be able to accomplish this just ponder it because he already asked the question how's it going to happen we're a million miles apart but somehow they're going to join with a bunch of corruption and notice this phrasing then when you do that you're going to forfeit your great evangelical teaching of the bible do i give anybody goosebumps i'm getting them all over again evangelicals not evangelical anymore it's merely a label a political one that is abandoned their doctrines of the bible and he says in terms of uniting together you're going to forfeit your evangelical teachings of the bible and the pentecostals are sympathizing with it going right into it so what's happening they're not necessarily changing their doctrine on water baptism they may not even be changing their doctrine on the oneness of the godhead they may not even be changing their doctrine on the gifts but yet they're sympathizing with some movement some ideology some representation of morality and in sympathizing he says they're like a hog going to its slaughter that's right ecumenical counsel many great pentecostal leaders agreeing with them i'm telling you don't you you never stick your neck in a thing like that that's exactly what the bible said would come to pass there's the beast and the mark perfectly everything's setting right in order we see this and we wonder what's going to be the outcome of it we wonder what it literally is going to be but we know it will be a union of church and state ecumenical ecclesiastical power joining together government and religion joining together in a forced union and already these things coming taking shape and people who are fervent about christ and let me say this because i took some of these things out of my notes realizing i wanted to finish it tonight we'll probably have to get into it more of it on sunday that jesus christ looks more like rambo now right then this meat humble man of the word he's a warrior right he's a man's man he if he was alive today he'd have his elk tag right and he'd be out in the kaibab somewhere hunting he wouldn't shave in the month of october we have our image of what christ would be right he'd be a man's man if he was if it was okay christian wise to dip he probably dip right probably a marlboro man or something come on i mean anybody my friends want to say amen tonight if you believe it think about the the caricature of christ we've invented a john wayne blessed are those who punch a guy in the mouth who's mistreating the elderly widow on the back 40 right he's a guy punches he's a brawler he's a fighter he stands up for justice he's a military man right he's a patriot well they tell me there's an opening somewhere so i'm getting phone calls maybe it was a premonition everything's setting right in order what shall we do with jesus called christ you know what i forgot to point something out can we go back two few slides to the first quote to begin to read the reproach for what further the cause of the word i meant to highlight that he's preaching a sermon the reproach for the cause of the word not the reproach of being pro-life not the reproach of being pro-israel again i want to make it very clear i'm not making a statement in that i i'm not taking a side i'm not saying that you shouldn't be pro-life you shouldn't be pro-israel you should be you are saying you should be pro-america i'm saying let's be pro-christ and he's saying the reproach for the cause of the word not a political party not the tea party movement the reproach for being libertarian that's not what he's preaching because we can't try to find this political sweet spot right where you know i'm green party i'm this i'm that no you're not gonna find it so what shall we do with jesus called christ is the next statement i want to read from the pentecostals the assemblies of god and the great other churches of the pentecostal kingdom and of the full gospel people how can they forfeit their evangelical teachings the very principles that they stood on how can they do it and where they was raised up to come out of those organizations and condemn it and they have to forfeit their evangelical doctrine to walk with man who disagree with upon the principles of the bible divine healing and the power of god in jesus christ how can two walk together except they be agreed you remember how when brother brandon made the statement that martin luther king jr had the right idea he just went about it the wrong way don't think for a second he was wrong to advocate for those civil rights don't think for a second that if he aired in the way that he tried to achieve it meant that what he was trying to achieve was wrong what he's saying is he was a a sincere man and maybe not a completely moral man who was using the wrong form in the wrong way to try to achieve something but what he was trying to achieve i believe we should support as christians wouldn't you don't you believe that we could say that you know that in the eyes of god that men are equal in the eyes of god and so he says this they forfeit their evangelical doctors walk with men who disagree upon the principles of the bible divine heal and the power of god in jesus christ how are they going to do this think about how else are they going to come together when they're a million miles apart find a common enemy find something to be maybe it's not pro-life maybe it's anti-pro-choice maybe it's maybe it's not pro-family values it's anti-homosexual did you not know that's how it started you know there wasn't this great moral upswing of really standing for christ in the home and that's what established the family values platform in the republican party it was a distaste for homosexuality it wasn't a real moral upswing it was a political uh kickback and an opportunity to see the evangelical support to gain support in office and to be able to bankroll their political agenda and their economic agenda by taking a polarizing lightning rod topic and to get this take the moral anxiety of the people and produce this family-valued platform when it really should have just been anti-homosexual platform and it would have worked probably just the same but how it slipped in and became even more destructive is we just kind of bought it as being something really really sincere and so we think that republicans republicans are family men why they are out there on secret dates with their boyfriends how can two walk together except they'd be agreed there you are that's the hour that we've arrived yeah at and notice the language and that's the big machine that's set up now now they've got the mechanics the only thing i have to have is satan in there with the dynamics to force the marking of the beast why she's forced down then the dynamics is working the mechanics are there they've already got them in the message then jesus came and called this is the darkest hour the church has ever seen now you know what every church soon is going to have to belong to that world council of churches i know that we're thinking in terms of some sort of official moral majority right it's got to be called the world council of churches and it's got to have the ink the org something attached to it they all have to literally sign a charter but it's going to be much more subtle than that and when you do you'll forfeit your evangelical rights when you do that and then if you don't then you can't be a denomination no more you'll forfeit your evangelical rights you'll have to forfeit their evangelical doctrine you're going to forfeit the great evangelical teaching of the bible notice what is at the core of joining up with this political regime or this world council of churches and what's at the core of how can two walk together except they be agreed what is he saying they've got to find some common basis of agreement you don't believe jesus was divine you don't believe in the baptismal holy ghost you don't believe in baptism name lord jesus christ you don't believe the bible is the truth you don't even believe in christianity you don't even believe that jesus christ was real you just believe the bible is full of good stories but are you anti-abortion come on let's go oh you you're pro-israel let's go you believe that marriage should be defined as one man and one woman listen saints we've already got the definition we don't need any more legislation we've got that's what's going to work for a believer that's what's going to work for a christian that's what's going to affect change in someone's life is when they recognize the true spiritual nature of marriage that's going to be more compelling than authoritarian government telling you you can't smoke dope and you can't marry who you love and you can't do this and you can't do that that does not produce christians legislation does not produce christians you forfeit your evangelical rights forfeit evangelicalism forfeit evangelistic teaching forfeit forfeit forfeit what did it forfeiting the true nature of the gospel and the world has fallen the world is again falling apart we hear so much we so hear so much about this new system going to bring the religious system you know going to bring peace upon the earth and when the catholics and all the protestants unite together brother ernie pointed out something last week protestants what are they what do they like to do protest it's just in their genes all of them men and women and all the protestants unite together some of them believe in divine healing some don't believe and some believe this and some believe that and you have to forfeit your big fuss you've been fussing about all the time your evangelical belief to get into the world council is it this is eye-opening to me maybe i'm the only one who had my eyes opened this week to see how perfect more perfect this message is if then that may be somewhat of a a paradox to be more perfect but just how beautifully it already lays in the word and when we see the complete abandonment within christianity from christ we think well how did that ever happen there had to be some way to call everyone to this motivation and this standing up for certain things because someone who is evangelical and by christian by nomination i'm a christian i'm a christian you couldn't completely tell them to reject christ you had to come up with some other false image that you sold them on that this supports the virtues of christ they ran away from christ and kicked christ out of the church thinking that they were worshiping him and lifting him up and lifting up his virtues and paul says there's not another christ jehovah jireh part three you know 1900 years ago on good friday this is very beautiful to bring in this modern event the church rejected jesus christ and an earthquake shook the world all over and he was talking about the earthquake that it just happened on good friday a lot of neat things parallels there and they rejected him again in the laodicean age as the bible said they would do and had put him on the outside who has christendom american christianity the pentecostal church the laodicean church age so just because it has the pensacola christian community behind it just because it has liberty behind it just because it has james dobson these are all christian people christian authors christian writers they don't have god there's it's not something that's purely god it's not something that's purely christ they borrow they take things there's truths that can be inspired to them there's a lot of good that maybe can be gleaned from them but listen and i i don't mind just being well read but we should also be informed by the word of god and led by the spirit we begin to digest those things and never just take them wholesale as being an honest representation of jesus christ let me say it again never take anything that may be out there in the world today whether it be music movies articles podcast uh you name it writers blogs anything do not take it as being purely christ they rejected him again in the layout of the same age as bible said they would had him on the outside and this ecumenical move of the council church is exactly what they're doing now it might be said oh brother aaron's preaching against james dobson brother aaron's preaching against bill gothard and and you'll you'll find somebody somewhere who subscribed to their programs and and offered their teachings and you're gonna say i'm against that person that's a lie i'm not against anyone i'm for christ and i've been benefited by many ministries that i know for a fact have borrowed different things from certain places and a real gift has picked up a real truth and used it for my benefit and i don't need to run to the altar of james dobson to get fixed wives don't need to run to the altar of sally clarkson to know how to homeschool their children we can run to christ he says they're forfeiting all their evangelical teachings and things well how did christ get kicked out of the church they forfeited their evangelical teachings how can two walk together unless they be agreed you realize how often he says that and what's he identifying there has to be an agreement somewhere where's the agreement the simple agenda right the political agenda we can all agree on pro-life we can all agree on pro-family we can all agree on uh pro-small government or whatever we can all agree on a capitalism we can all agree on right pro-israel how can two walk together unless they be agreed well you can't do it that won't work with real genuine christians all right this is your chance to amen you don't want to stick your head up thinking you're in a room with a bunch of liberals to this point you really really want to pat me on the back and knock this table out of the way and hug me you know or something like that now is your chance to really get loud that won't work with real genuine christians they'll never receive it no sir a born-again christian will never go in a trap like that it's just like putting a duck in a cage they know he's headed for the slaughter you'll never drive him into that so we a real born-again christian will stay away from that may we as real born-again christians be washed of any political ideology be washed of any bond that we form through consumerism oh god let me not allow my the faith that i inhabit be defined by the things i've consumed i don't want to be walking in a world that kirk cameron was the producer and director of through movies i don't want to be walking in a world that that um adventures in honesty of shape i don't think walking in a world that's been informed but alone by veggie tales i don't want to be doing things through some paradigm of something else other than the word of god that's been sent to me in this hour it's like putting a duck in a cage a real born-again christian will stay away from that in closing brother mike if you please come this was so so inspiring notice the loosing of this ecclesiastical spirit now 20 years later after that war we see the loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit one under the seventh seal the seventh trumpet to the jew seven seal two the bride he says look at the moon darkening out what under see it drawn out the son of man being drove from the church what is it joining in with the ecclesiastical bunch the ecumenical move and with the world council of churches has drove every man what does that thing stand for why you have to surrender all your evangelical teachings and things how can two walk together unless they be agreed they can't jesus said they can't just for the last few moments here's here's the three quotes i've been reading right down to this part right here one two three four five six seven eight nine lines he says what does that thing stand for why you have to surrender all your evangelical teachings and things how can two walk together unless they be agreed they can't jesus said they can't and how can a church the methodist and baptists walk together are you listening what is going to bring the methodists and the baptists what line can be drawn in the sand where they're going to stand shoulder to shoulder and oppose something what what's going to do it how can the church of christ walk with the presbyterians how can the catholic walk with the protestant how can the protestant walk with protestant [Music] but the bride can walk with the word which is christ it must be an agreement not the ecclesiastical system but the word you have to agree with the word to walk with the word jesus said so that makes it right let's not have a right wing political leaning let us be right under the wings of christ if it's christ if it's worth that's what makes it right not in the terms of left or right liberal or conservative but i want to be right when it comes to christ that's the right that i am i'm not in the right political spectrum i'm in the right word channel and it may seem very very subtle but i hope the word just highlights it to you tonight to recognize that he says how are you ever going to get all these different denominations and definitions of jesus to walk together because they can't unless they agree satan found things they can agree on [Music] i mean what we can do very easily is advocate join our voice with theirs because it sounds so close to things we believe when the best voice against those things the best voice to promote what the virtues that are really those things pretend to have would become wouldn't it not stand in front of an abortion clinic and keep a young girl from going in by throwing blood you know paint on her and telling her she's a murderer but saying come you should come to church that's got to be a tough situation for you to be in that position that's got to be really really hard you got to be really tormented but you know what there's a jesus that can help you oh don't talk to me about jesus you're probably going to try to convince me on this i'm a murderer i'm not no no no no no no whatever decision you make you're going to need peace in your life and you'll never find it without christ and so well you just think i'm a murderer hey you know what we have we have an example in paul who was a murderer he killed christians he blasphemed and even our bible teaches us that a blasphemy will never enter the kingdom of god but yet one of our most outstanding writers of the new testament and the one who brought the gospel to the gentiles was paul the apostle paul he claimed to be a blasphemer and said he was a murderer so i'm not gonna be real hard on you do i just sound like a liberal to you if i do i'm sorry that's my fault but i hope that somehow you feel god beseeching you for the cause of christ let's stop being political out of it activist become advocates for him can we do that i know you're going to be good at it i know you already are you might say oh brilliant what made you think that we are ever card-carrying members of the republican party i i didn't think that at all but would you agree we recognize a spirit that's at work in the land today and how easily it kind of gets into our message theology [Music] and we almost make the message really pro-israel and pro-american and pro this and pro that when the message was really pro-christ and that solved all the issues brother luke we were just talking about it monday weren't we the distaste for politics in the church turns a lot of people away from church because they see the political agendas that rile up churches and the whole the pulpit becomes they'll even just come around now i can't endorse a candidate but let us invite to the platform a man that i think would make a good president right [Music] let's stand [Music] i'd like to make it again very clear that these authors i've mentioned these individuals that i've identified are not contraband or anti-christ in the sense that you know you're going to wear some scarlet letter if you've read them been benefited by them i just want you to recognize really where their home is and who their audience is and as believers we can benefit right as believers we can benefit through the tuning of the holy spirit from a lot of things songs can benefit us we can be listening to a podcast and someone could say something there's ways i know that elizabeth and i my wife and i have been benefited by some of these very authors that i wrote down how do i even know about it because i've read them we've had the books we've learned things from them but what i begin to realize is there's a lot of other things that go with it and if we see the word we can amend the word but we don't need to adopt the culture behind it and i just want you to recognize that dynamic that's been at work in our lives for many decades now that by these things that we have in common by partaking in this common culture we become we form bonds with like-minded consumers and so we we feel that these other people who are doing these same things like maybe we have this affinity with them and it forms the basis for a cultural identity so that when we have a lot of people in that same space who are taking great umbrage with some somebody something they do and they hate this athlete and they hate this decision they come against this actor and you have all these things that everyone's getting riled up and you find yourself getting riled up too i want you to take a deep breath and realize where it's coming from that's that's what i'm wanting to do is just recognize where it's coming from let's bow our heads in a word of prayer [Music] if you are witnesses too christ putting me your pastor on on the couch and doing a spiritual therapy conducting spiritual surgery with my heart and washing me of a lot of things that have clouded my judgment i thank you for your patience with me these things are going to make me a better pastor [Music] i also believe that you being sincere christians also would want if there was anything in you that was this empty evangelicalism these empty political plat uh platforms and platitudes these any of these things if they would exist in your heart that you would desire to be washed there's a terminology in politics someone who's a centrist or a moderate democrat and there's this political spectrum can i ask you to step out of the political spectrum tonight let's not have any political identity if paul could ask us to pray for kings and those that are in authority that through our prayers we can lead christian lives [Music] let's start with that [Music] unless desire that all men would be saved we know enough right to know that god a man can't come to god unless god draws him we understand the doctrine of election and predestination but i want somebody else to have the chance i've had [Music] heavenly father [Music] i'm wanting to restrain from being very personal myself [Music] but you came to me [Music] [Music] now lord let me come to those who are in need not to build a political coalition not to start a church build up another organization but that the gospel could be promoted [Music] father's a young man brother victor who has a testimony of how his life was changed through the witness of a believer and then in love and concern for his cousin he advocated on his behalf that he would be given an opportunity to learn a similar profession that he had that had been the gateway in the doorway for his life to be changed and it's changed his cousin's life right now cousin may not be serving the lord but he's in a better place than he ever would have been without those interactions father i trust that somehow some way we could stop [Music] promoting ourselves stop promoting our interest in our ideas and our churches and our theologies and promote you and be happy with that [Music] and just stand in that channel in that grace lord i trust that i have a testimony before the people and that my record is clear that i'm not advocating for dumbing down the word of god and i'm not advocating for watering down our great truth but i can say in my heart that the opening of the word and the intimacy of the son of man that i'm experiencing in this hour has caused me to become more passionate about advocating for the purity of the word than just the pre the pretense of message messageology and message optics and i pray lord that we as a church who have this great opportunity being a year old we can be called out to drawn aside and become a living sacrifice be that young church of a year old that can be taken and be displayed as a token granite father i pray bless your people have been attentive and been diligent to remain with me through the the breadth of this sermon i commit the people to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
