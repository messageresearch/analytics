[0:00] Daniel chapter 3 I'm going to read
[0:02] verses 1 to 20 and I'm doing this as a
[0:05] way of hopefully
[0:08] creating um some motivation to get to
[0:11] this I've had this in my notes the last
[0:13] few services and just haven't been able
[0:15] to get to
[0:16] them and I've debated on whether or not
[0:19] I should just start uh with this story
[0:21] in Daniel but I I I'd like to conclude
[0:24] with the these examples here and so
[0:27] we'll just read these verses Daniel
[0:29] chapter 3 veres 1 to 20 that way we
[0:32] recently heard it by the time we arrive
[0:34] at the story at the end Nebuchadnezzar
[0:37] the king made an image of gold whose
[0:38] height was three score cubits and the
[0:40] breadth thereof six cubits he set it up
[0:43] in the plain of Duran in the province of
[0:46] Babylon now we know that uh this is an
[0:50] image of Daniel and we could see the
[0:52] example in scripture because in verse 48
[0:54] it said the king made Daniel a great man
[0:56] and gave him many great gifts and made
[0:58] him a ruler and so it's no uh no strange
[1:02] thing that this image in verse one of
[1:04] chapter 3 would be an image of a prophet
[1:07] or Daniel it says then Nebuchadnezzar
[1:08] the king sent to gather together the
[1:10] princes the governors the captains the
[1:12] judges the treasurers the counselors the
[1:14] sheriffs and the rulers of the provinces
[1:16] to come to the dedication of the image
[1:17] which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
[1:20] then the princes the governors the
[1:21] captains the judges the treasurers the
[1:23] counselors the sheriffs and all the
[1:24] rulers of the provinces were gathered
[1:26] together into the dedication of the
[1:27] image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had
[1:29] said set up and they stood before the
[1:31] image of Nebuchadnezzar that
[1:33] Nebuchadnezzar had set up then a Herald
[1:36] cried aloud to you it is commanded oh
[1:38] people Nations and languages that at the
[1:41] time you hear the sound of the corette
[1:43] flute harp sackbut Sultry duler and all
[1:45] kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship
[1:48] the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
[1:49] king hath set up and who so falleth not
[1:52] down and worship not the same hour be
[1:54] cast into the midst of a fire burning
[1:56] fiery furnace therefore at that time
[1:59] when all the people heard the sound of
[2:00] the cornette flute harp sackbut Sultry
[2:03] and all kinds of music and all the
[2:05] people the Nations and languages fell
[2:06] down and worshiped the golden image that
[2:08] Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up it
[2:10] almost reads like the 12 Days of
[2:13] Christmas because you keep repeating the
[2:14] same things over and over again as
[2:16] they're added to the story wherefore all
[2:18] that time certain calans came near and
[2:20] accused the Jews they spake and said to
[2:22] King Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever
[2:25] thou oh King H has made a decree that
[2:27] every man that shall hear the sound of
[2:29] the cornette flute harp sack butut
[2:30] Sultry ulur and all kinds of music shall
[2:33] fall down and worship the golden image
[2:35] who so fth not down and worship that he
[2:37] should be cast into the midst of a
[2:39] burning fiery perace there are certain
[2:41] Jews whom thou has set over the Affairs
[2:43] of the province of Babylon Shadrach
[2:45] Meshach and Abednego these men oh King
[2:48] have not regarded thee they serve not
[2:50] thy Gods nor worship the golden image
[2:52] what thou has set up so there's this
[2:54] peer pressure this influence everyone's
[2:56] doing the same thing and these few
[2:59] refuse to do do so then Nebuchadnezzar
[3:01] in his rage and fury commanded to bring
[3:03] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego then they
[3:05] brought these men before the King
[3:08] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them
[3:10] is it true oh Shadrach Meshach and
[3:11] Abednego do not you serve my gods nor
[3:14] worship the golden image which I have
[3:16] set up now if you be ready that at the
[3:18] time you hear the sound of the Cornet
[3:20] flute harp sacet Sultry duler and all
[3:22] kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship
[3:24] the image which I have made well but if
[3:26] you worship not you shall be cast the
[3:28] same hour into the midst of the burning
[3:30] fiery furnace and who is that God that
[3:32] shall deliver you out of my hands
[3:35] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered
[3:37] and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar
[3:39] we are not careful to answer thee in
[3:40] this matter if it be so our God whom we
[3:43] serve is able to Deliver Us From The
[3:46] Burning fiery furnace and he will
[3:47] deliver us out of thine hand O King but
[3:50] if not be it known unto thee O King that
[3:52] we will not serve thy Gods nor worship
[3:54] the golden image which thou has set up
[3:57] then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury in
[3:59] the form of his Visage was changed
[4:00] against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[4:02] therefore he spake and commanded that
[4:04] they should heat the furnace one seven
[4:06] times more than it had want to be heated
[4:09] and he commanded the most mighty men
[4:12] that were in his army to bind Shadrach
[4:14] Meshach and abedo and to cast them into
[4:17] the burning fiery furnace amen we trust
[4:20] that the Lord will bless these things
[4:21] which we've read you can have your seats
[4:30] I'm giving a title to the sermon today
[4:32] integrity and I'll give it just a little
[4:35] bit of background of where I'm coming
[4:36] from on
[4:38] this as we've been approaching things
[4:40] from the standpoint of Art and artworks
[4:43] and even the artist and God himself
[4:44] being the the original artist I was
[4:47] looking at the concepts of recently when
[4:49] we ministered on ruined and how
[4:51] something can become ruined and become
[4:52] desolate and cast down and when it comes
[4:55] to Art there's a process whereby they uh
[4:58] will restore artwork involves repairing
[5:00] that image to return it to or that
[5:02] artwork to its original state and one of
[5:05] the things uh that I found coming up
[5:07] most often is I was looking at uh
[5:09] possibly ministering or using the
[5:11] subject of modesty restored and I was I
[5:14] was looking at this I found that one of
[5:16] the common themes that kept coming up
[5:18] over and over again in one area that I
[5:20] was studying in the word of God was
[5:21] integrity and one of the themes when it
[5:24] comes to maintaining restoring our work
[5:26] is maintaining the original Integrity of
[5:29] that artwork and if you change the
[5:31] Integrity of it then you lose the whole
[5:34] concept of restoration loses its point
[5:37] and so there's even a code of ethics
[5:38] that govern how a piece of art is
[5:40] restored and and the the phrase is used
[5:42] to its original integrity and by
[5:44] original Integrity they mean preserving
[5:46] the artist intent uh the materials that
[5:49] were used and even the same technique so
[5:51] that you don't change what is being
[5:53] represented and so I decided to show you
[5:55] I wanted to show you an example here of
[5:58] what not to do do when you're restoring
[6:00] a piece of art this was from a church in
[6:03] Spain and this was a painting on the
[6:07] left is the way that it was looked even
[6:10] in modern times and the paint begin to
[6:12] chip away and begin to fade and um an
[6:14] 80-year-old woman took it upon her heart
[6:16] to restore art and this is what it
[6:19] looked like after she was done and it
[6:21] was entitled eomo on the left and after
[6:24] she was done uh they called it eimo
[6:26] which is behold the man to behold the
[6:28] monkey and you could tell that this
[6:30] restoration process didn't quite go the
[6:33] way that it should it caused quite an
[6:34] uproar uh the lady that did it uh she
[6:37] took great offense cuz she said that she
[6:39] had restored it to a point and then went
[6:41] on vacation and before she could get
[6:43] back and finish it uh it already became
[6:45] a worldwide spectacle and you could tell
[6:48] the piece of work on the right is not a
[6:51] restoration of what you see on the left
[6:53] you'd probably prefer this over the
[6:56] other and what someone would do if
[6:58] they're trying to restore this image
[7:00] they would want to look at what the
[7:02] artist originally intended look at the
[7:03] colors it used the techniques it's used
[7:06] it used and even do everything it can to
[7:08] restore its original Integrity so that
[7:10] when it's restored or made new or fresh
[7:13] or more vibrant it it's not a departure
[7:16] from what the original artist intended
[7:19] and so that's what we refer to as the
[7:21] original Integrity of the artist and
[7:23] what I'm wanting to look at today is
[7:25] integrity and I'm wanting to look at it
[7:27] in the standpoint of the scripture and
[7:29] then even
[7:30] uh kind of uh building off of what we
[7:33] ministered on a couple Sundays ago on
[7:35] integrity and it's that condition of
[7:37] being without blemish uh where one is
[7:40] complete or sound they're they're
[7:42] upright they're whole that's what
[7:44] integrity means in the Old Testament is
[7:46] the condition of being without blemish
[7:48] to be complete to be whole and when we
[7:51] looked at the subject of Ruin we
[7:53] discussed scriptures related to how a
[7:55] man or woman ought to dress we're
[7:57] drawing from Deuteronomy 22 and we
[8:00] looked at the concept of how that
[8:01] clothing surrounds the body and covers
[8:03] the body but depending on how you wear
[8:06] it and how you how that clothing is made
[8:08] and worn it can also disclose and
[8:11] discover the body so just because you
[8:13] have a piece of garment a garment on or
[8:15] a piece of fabric on doesn't necessarily
[8:17] mean you're covered because you could
[8:19] wear it in a manner to where it's
[8:20] suggestive or it actually discovers the
[8:23] body and we looked in the scripture and
[8:25] we saw that Christians should dress in a
[8:27] way that complement their nature their
[8:29] god-given nature their gender uh their
[8:32] role their purpose and even their
[8:34] relationships to others Deuteronomy
[8:37] chapter 22:5 says the woman shall not
[8:40] wear that which pertaineth unto a man
[8:42] neither shall a man put on a woman's
[8:44] garment for all that do so are
[8:46] Abomination unto the Lord thy God this
[8:49] is different than all the miscellaneous
[8:51] laws that say one ought to do this and
[8:53] one out to do that this puts it in the
[8:55] category of God's opinion of those that
[8:58] would C would would wear that Garment of
[9:00] the opposite gender and it's something
[9:04] in a nature of a God who never changes
[9:07] and we know that modest apparel is what
[9:09] God values it's what he uh what he puts
[9:13] great price on as the scripture tells us
[9:16] and this scripture also relates to
[9:18] modest apparel also relates to the
[9:20] respect that we have for ourselves and
[9:23] for others and it's a key point in the
[9:25] scripture that we have to see so we were
[9:27] looking at it from two different
[9:28] elements we looked at the principle of
[9:30] roles what headship and identity we saw
[9:33] that very plain in the scripture that
[9:34] God is asking us to dress a particular
[9:36] way because as men we have a particular
[9:39] role as women we have a particular role
[9:41] and we dress in a way that's
[9:42] complimentary to that and doesn't
[9:44] confuse it saw that over and over again
[9:46] in the scripture and the other element
[9:48] is the principle of modesty we haven't
[9:51] really looked too greatly into this we
[9:53] stopped short of it last time but on the
[9:55] principle of modesty is one of these
[9:58] these guiding factors in in dressing a
[10:01] particular way and has to do with sexual
[10:03] attraction so the principles of modesty
[10:06] are contrasted by and even tied to the
[10:09] power of sexual attraction and I hope
[10:11] that we can really uh consider this in a
[10:13] mature way today in Proverbs 7: 6-2 we
[10:18] read this the last time we ministered on
[10:20] the subject for at the window of my
[10:22] house I looked through my casement and
[10:24] beheld among the simple ones I discerned
[10:26] among the youths a man void of
[10:28] understanding passing through the street
[10:30] near her corner and he went the way to
[10:33] her house and in the Twilight in the
[10:35] evening in the black and dark night and
[10:38] behold there met him a woman with the
[10:40] attire of a harlot and subtle of heart
[10:43] she is loud and stubborn her feet abide
[10:45] not in her house now she's without now
[10:48] in the streets and lith in weight at
[10:50] every corner we could see here that this
[10:53] woman is obviously uh has inappropriate
[10:57] motives this is improper Behavior it
[10:59] says that she has a subtle heart she's
[11:01] loud and stubborn and she abides not in
[11:04] her house so there's something where she
[11:07] is being rebellious to her calling and
[11:09] her position and she has these improper
[11:12] motives and it says she wears the attire
[11:15] of a harlot whether it was something
[11:16] very showy or Gody or something very
[11:19] short or tight or revealing the word
[11:21] signifies that she was wearing clothing
[11:24] fitted to her body well-shaped to
[11:27] recommend her she was dressing in a way
[11:30] that would recommend her body that would
[11:32] show it off that would advertise it and
[11:35] harlot in the scripture could be one of
[11:37] two different
[11:41] persons one who was either motivated by
[11:43] lust or motivated for gain and think of
[11:47] that in terms of one who might do it
[11:48] just to satisfy their
[11:50] desires and one who might do it for gain
[11:54] and this dressing here this attire of a
[11:56] harlot it's that phrase that I found as
[11:59] I was looking into this dressing that is
[12:01] a form of objectification in service of
[12:04] the male gaze to cause one to stare to
[12:07] cause one to be attracted and as this is
[12:11] this is so for both men and women what
[12:13] we wear should not appeal to the lust of
[12:15] the eyes nor should we dress in a way
[12:18] that would cater to the pride of life
[12:21] these are things that the scripture
[12:22] speaks of and enforces over and over
[12:24] again that there must be modesty in the
[12:27] way that we dress this modesty is this
[12:29] restraint by this sense of humility or
[12:32] propriety where you have a moderate
[12:34] self-regard this is what modesty begins
[12:37] with you you look at yourself in a way
[12:40] to where you have a moderate opinion of
[12:41] yourself and because you have a moderate
[12:43] opinion of yourself you're not trying to
[12:44] broadcast you're not trying to advertise
[12:46] you're not trying to show off and at the
[12:47] same time you're not attention seeking
[12:50] because you have respect for others so
[12:54] modesty demonstrates the proper regard
[12:56] of yourself but also a proper respect
[12:58] for
[12:59] others in Isaiah 3:1 16 we'll read verse
[13:03] 16 and then here in a moment we'll pick
[13:05] up and read to verse 24 but this is a a
[13:09] very obvious scripture and a very
[13:11] well-known scripture when it comes to
[13:13] modesty and how that a woman would dress
[13:15] appreciate your patience today as we
[13:16] just try to pla through this it says
[13:19] moreover the Lord saith because the
[13:21] daughters of Zion are hottie and wal
[13:24] with stretched forth necks and wanting
[13:26] eyes so hotess is at the heart of this
[13:28] because because modesty in spirit is
[13:30] going to be a complement to modesty in
[13:32] dress that if someone's not modest in
[13:34] spirit it can certainly overcome
[13:36] whatever clothing they've tried to cover
[13:38] up their body with it says want I
[13:40] walking and mincing as they go and
[13:42] making a tinkling with their feet this
[13:45] word mencing uh describes a manner of
[13:48] walk and it's descriptive of one wearing
[13:50] high heels brother bam even takes this
[13:52] scripture to describe the same and we
[13:55] could we could spend a lot of time
[13:57] getting into
[13:59] uh uh you know high heels and those
[14:01] things and I found that the longer I
[14:03] lived that there can be very legalistic
[14:05] attitudes towards it to where any heel
[14:07] at all is a high heel and then there's
[14:10] also the context historically of the
[14:12] things that brother brandham has
[14:13] identifying but even within fashion and
[14:16] Academia and not just in the religious
[14:17] realm but high heels of a certain length
[14:20] at some point begin to cause a woman to
[14:22] Arch her back and extend her backside
[14:25] out and her face forward and the Bible's
[14:27] describing a similar G
[14:30] and I believe that all of us uh well I
[14:32] guess I don't know how common it is
[14:33] these days and uh but as you look at
[14:37] this uh from a historical standpoint
[14:39] high heels are considered to be a sex
[14:41] symbol at least a modern sex symbol and
[14:44] they in in Reading even the fashion
[14:47] design and intent behind it that it
[14:49] accentuates sex specific aspects of a
[14:52] female walk so it artificially inflates
[14:55] uh the look of a female it's a and it
[14:57] actually is tied to
[14:59] certain behaviors in nature and even to
[15:01] the woman that it was an imitation of a
[15:03] woman's desire to be courted in other
[15:05] words a woman's desire to get the
[15:07] attention of a man we all on the same
[15:10] page today are we all smelling the beans
[15:12] that are cooking and the knowledge that
[15:15] brother Travis smoked another brisket
[15:17] and we're all wanting to put that in our
[15:19] taco shell and so we're thinking about
[15:22] that not high heels well for a moment
[15:24] humor me at least and and and having a
[15:27] very serious discussion about modesty
[15:30] and I'm not approaching it from the same
[15:32] same standpoint where I I to get up here
[15:34] and just rail to purple my face about
[15:36] split skirts and short skirts and tight
[15:38] clothing and high heels no that's we're
[15:42] not uh deacons are not to be clothing
[15:44] police pastors aren't supposed to uh be
[15:47] worried about what's in your wardrobe
[15:49] and in your closets this is for
[15:50] believers to consider I'm only
[15:53] responsible for the word of God to
[15:54] preach the word of God and then for you
[15:57] to process it hopefully the holy
[15:59] spirit's grabbing a hold of it and so
[16:01] there is a point at which even your
[16:03] Footwear can begin to cross a line and
[16:06] maybe a Tipping Point where certain
[16:08] things begin to happen to your walk and
[16:10] to your look that is originally meant to
[16:13] cause an
[16:15] attraction and these are things that we
[16:17] may not be thinking about but they
[16:19] matter and in 1 Corinthians 7: 29 Paul
[16:23] says but this I say Brethren the time is
[16:25] short it remaineth that both they that
[16:28] have wives be as though they had none
[16:30] and then he begins to get into these
[16:32] different you that do this you that do
[16:34] that do the opposite so in essence we
[16:37] read this to say that married men should
[16:40] act as if they were single and all of a
[16:43] sudden married men say brother brand
[16:44] preached the same gospel Paul preached
[16:47] and and this is the end time and time is
[16:48] short and this is my excuse to live
[16:50] single but then he explains this later
[16:53] and as we've looked at verse 31 quite a
[16:55] bit you'll see how much this fits within
[16:58] this thought on fashion and
[17:01] modesty they that use this world is not
[17:04] abusing it we have to get something out
[17:07] of this world but we are not to try to
[17:09] get everything we can out of it for the
[17:12] fashion of this world passeth away can
[17:15] even see how that Fashions change so
[17:18] dramatically a a and they're always
[17:20] changing he says but I would have you
[17:21] without carefulness now he begins to
[17:23] explain what he means by he that is
[17:25] married act as if he's unmarried he that
[17:28] is unmarried Mar careth for the things
[17:30] that belong to the Lord how he may
[17:32] please the Lord so if you're not married
[17:34] today then you ought to have an attitude
[17:38] that your primary goal is to please God
[17:41] now Paul then acknowledges that when a
[17:43] man is married things change he that is
[17:45] married care for things that are of the
[17:47] world how he may please his wife so we
[17:50] get what we can out of the world but we
[17:53] don't get everything we can out of the
[17:55] world because our interest in the world
[17:57] isn't to be benefited by it but however
[18:00] to take care of those that we are
[18:02] responsible to in this instance he cares
[18:05] about the things of the world and what
[18:06] the world has so that he can take care
[18:08] of his wife so his duty is not to the
[18:11] world his duty is to his wife there is a
[18:14] difference also between a wife and a
[18:16] virgin the unmarried woman carth for the
[18:18] things of the Lord that she may be holy
[18:20] both in body and in spirit so as a
[18:23] single lady your desire is to please the
[18:26] Lord both in body and in spirit the way
[18:28] you dress the way you live the way you
[18:29] act single if you're single today you
[18:33] your primary objective is to dress to
[18:35] live to act to speak and to pursue your
[18:38] course in this world putting God first
[18:41] how that you may please the Lord Paul
[18:44] then acknowledges the challenge that a a
[18:46] married woman will face she that is
[18:47] married careth for the things of the
[18:49] world how she may please her husband and
[18:52] what I want to point out I think it's
[18:54] very obvious in reading this is that if
[18:56] you're single you act and dress to
[18:58] please God
[18:59] if you're married you act to please your
[19:01] spouse and to take care of your spouse
[19:03] and you would dress also in
[19:05] consideration too your spouse that if
[19:08] anyone is dressing with the idea that
[19:10] they want to attract the male gaze or to
[19:14] attract the attention of another man
[19:17] they're not living for their husband or
[19:20] for their mate so your your duty is
[19:23] first to God and as you have a duty to
[19:25] God it moderates your behavior and what
[19:27] you pursue and how you dress and how you
[19:29] act and then he that is married he then
[19:32] maybe would think I want to live this
[19:34] way or act this way for my wife then
[19:36] Paul's takes a step back and he kind of
[19:38] solves all of it and says how about we
[19:40] just all live to serve God and the rest
[19:44] will take care of
[19:45] itself that though we may be tempted to
[19:48] live in a way that I to get out of the
[19:50] world what we can in order to please our
[19:53] spouse and take care of our spouse let
[19:55] us live as a single man would caring
[19:58] about the things of God the things that
[20:00] belong to the Lord how we may please the
[20:01] Lord and the Bible teaches us the rest
[20:04] will be added to us but there is a way
[20:07] that we could be tempted to dress if
[20:09] we're single to dress in a way that
[20:11] would get the attention of the opposite
[20:13] sex and that would be wrong there is
[20:16] then a way that we could dress even as a
[20:18] married person that inappropriately
[20:20] broadcasts or signals things that would
[20:22] get the attention of the opposite sex
[20:24] and that would be wrong so there is this
[20:27] glorification and this lifting up of
[20:29] self and the flesh which forsakes God's
[20:32] desire for the individual and it's
[20:34] opposite the image of God's beauty that
[20:36] he that he
[20:39] loves we could look into the history of
[20:43] uh the Garment that pertains to a man
[20:45] and how that in France it said that it
[20:47] was a woman had to ask for permission to
[20:50] wear pants and that was the phrase that
[20:52] they used a garment that pertained to a
[20:53] man was pants and a woman wearing pants
[20:57] is actually was a sign of of a symbol of
[21:00] rebellion against the patriarchy the
[21:02] status quo and so the the very idea that
[21:06] a woman would wear a man's garment was s
[21:08] was symbolizing her
[21:11] overthrowing uh misogyny or chauvinism
[21:14] and there's been a lot of nasty things
[21:15] done in the name of that but just even
[21:17] trying to upt overturn the the their
[21:22] relationship to man to not create a
[21:25] compliment but to create a forced
[21:27] equality right
[21:32] so continuing in verse 17 because there
[21:36] are hottie and walk with stretch forth
[21:38] necks and wanting eyes walking and
[21:39] mincing as they go making a tinkling
[21:41] with their feet this uh the there's this
[21:44] shorter gate this step that takes place
[21:46] a certain way that it accentuates the
[21:48] female figure that's what's being
[21:50] described in this now let's look at it
[21:53] too there's a overall attitude this
[21:55] hotess stretched forth necks wanting
[21:57] eyes now this is God's response
[22:00] therefore the Lord will Smite with the
[22:02] scab the crown of the head of the
[22:03] daughters of Zion here is their their
[22:06] dereliction their forsaking of Duty
[22:08] their unfaithfulness because they've
[22:10] Left Behind the Lord now they're going
[22:11] to be ruined God is going to bring ruin
[22:13] upon them they're going to Smite them
[22:15] and the Lord will discover their secret
[22:17] Parts in that day the Lord will take
[22:19] away The Bravery so here's their hotess
[22:21] their their forwardness the their
[22:23] attention seeking Behavior The Bravery
[22:26] of their tinkling ornaments about their
[22:27] feet and their halls and their round
[22:29] tires like the moon the chains and the
[22:31] bracelets and the Mufflers the bonnets I
[22:34] feel like I'm going between the garage
[22:35] and the the salon here the Bonnets and
[22:38] the ornaments of the legs and the
[22:39] headbands the tablets and the earrings
[22:41] the Rings and nose Jewels the changeable
[22:43] suits of apparel and The Mantel and the
[22:45] Whip wimples and the crisping pins the
[22:48] glasses and the fine linen and the hoods
[22:50] and the
[22:53] veils and this is just one
[22:56] outfit right here it's it's been
[22:59] described in one and this is what God's
[23:01] doing it's their
[23:04] fashion which symbolize their
[23:07] Rebellion the way they dressed they were
[23:09] trying to give give some sort of signal
[23:12] they could take care of themselves uh
[23:14] they get attention we're powerful and
[23:17] God is sorely displeased he says it
[23:19] shall come to pass that instead of sweet
[23:21] smell there shall be stink instead of a
[23:24] girdle a rent and instead of a well set
[23:26] hair baldness that and that alone should
[23:29] be caution enough for us to dress
[23:32] right I I wish I could have well set
[23:35] hair but instead its baldness and
[23:38] instead of a stomacher a giring of
[23:40] sackcloth and burning instead of
[23:43] beauty this is God's allowing ruin upon
[23:47] those who would forsake his way being
[23:50] unfaithful becoming hottie it's
[23:53] expressed in the way that they dress and
[23:54] a change of the way that they look God
[23:57] is allowing that
[23:59] that even all their Fashions and all
[24:01] their efforts will come to
[24:03] ruin
[24:07] now the question could be asked and we
[24:10] might in this day and age ask ourselves
[24:12] well what's the
[24:14] danger right not trying to back into an
[24:16] answer here but God has given these
[24:19] standards for a reason it's for uh the
[24:22] modesty humility these different
[24:24] principles that relate to God he has the
[24:26] same character uh that he's wanting to
[24:28] see in us so there is a danger in
[24:31] dressing in an in modest way there's a
[24:34] way there's a danger in dressing
[24:36] provocatively there's a danger in
[24:38] dressing in a way that's deceptive where
[24:40] you are giving the appearance and
[24:42] suggesting things that are not
[24:45] so and in Matthew 5: 28 this is what
[24:48] connects to me very uh specific to the
[24:51] power of sexual attraction and how that
[24:53] the Bible requires a certain manner of
[24:55] dress for the principles of modesty but
[24:58] it says I say unto you Matthew 5:28 that
[25:02] whosoever lookth on a woman to lust
[25:04] after her hath committed adultery with
[25:06] her already in his heart we understand
[25:09] according to the Old Testament the
[25:11] penalty with penalty for adultery was
[25:13] death so this is no light thing so
[25:16] whosoever lookth on a woman to lust
[25:19] that's to turn upon a thing so there's
[25:21] to long for something forbidden or to
[25:23] turn upon a thing it says that there is
[25:25] a crossing of a line if there's
[25:27] something forbidden there's a line that
[25:28] is crossed I believe that we could uh
[25:31] look at it from the standpoint that it's
[25:34] not that if a man sees a woman who's
[25:36] dressed inappropriately or dressed
[25:37] suggestively that he's committed
[25:39] adultery but there's a line that he can
[25:41] cross when he looks to lust he crosses
[25:44] this line for something that is
[25:46] forbidden the very word lookth means to
[25:48] discover with the mind's eye so it's not
[25:51] just to see but it's to contemplate to
[25:53] weigh carefully or to examine and
[25:56] there's a way that we ladies could dress
[25:59] or women could dress however you want to
[26:01] whatever term you want to use that is
[26:02] going to cause the person to look and to
[26:06] gaze and to contemplate to draw
[26:08] attention to cause you to to look longer
[26:11] than you ought to so that to look here
[26:14] is not just to see but to cause them to
[26:17] wait carefully to examine to draw
[26:18] attention to and it would hold in first
[26:22] Thessalonians 4: 5 and 6 and I'm wanting
[26:25] to make this point that this relates to
[26:27] principles of modesty whether it be
[26:29] garments that reveal certain parts of
[26:31] the body or formed certain parts of the
[26:33] body and even as it pertains to wearing
[26:36] uh pants or jeans or garments that
[26:38] pertain to a man say well that's really
[26:40] oldfashioned well just consider it from
[26:43] a very real standpoint how that if you
[26:45] choose to wear a pants that are we say
[26:48] maybe slacks or loose fitting then
[26:51] you're wearing what it would clearly be
[26:52] a garment that pertains to a man and if
[26:54] you wear it too form fitting what does
[26:55] it
[26:57] become draws attention so it's not in
[27:00] the lust of concupisent even as the
[27:02] Gentiles which know not God 1
[27:04] Thessalonians 4:5 and 6 I don't know if
[27:05] I cued that up not in the lust of
[27:08] concupisent even as the Gentiles which
[27:10] know not God that no man go beyond and
[27:13] defraud his brother in any manner
[27:15] because that the Lord is the Avenger of
[27:17] all such as we also have forewarned you
[27:20] and
[27:21] testified this lust that Paul identifies
[27:24] is this inordinate affection or depraved
[27:27] desire it's emotion or a feeling for
[27:30] something
[27:31] forbidden and Jesus says that if a man
[27:33] looks upon a woman to lust after her he
[27:36] has committed adultery in his heart
[27:40] already and Paul when he's writing says
[27:42] that no man go beyond that means to step
[27:44] over these proper limits to transgress
[27:47] or to trespass and get an
[27:51] advantage we can see then with just
[27:53] these few scriptures I I hope that it
[27:55] there's just enough maybe that suggests
[27:57] this that God has established boundaries
[27:59] for a reason and what Satan would want
[28:02] us to do is to see a boundary and then
[28:04] begin to question God's motive in
[28:07] establishing the
[28:08] boundary we could go back into the
[28:10] Exodus when the children of Israel were
[28:12] told that if they were to eat leaven
[28:14] bread that that person who ate was to be
[28:17] disinherited and put outside of the camp
[28:20] and to be removed from Israel and so God
[28:23] just didn't put up a bunch of signs
[28:24] saying don't eat leaven bread he
[28:27] demanded that all all leaven be removed
[28:29] from the house so this is how God deals
[28:31] with dangers and pitfalls he doesn't say
[28:34] this is the line get as close as you can
[28:36] but he's going to establish a boundary
[28:38] for your own protection and for the
[28:39] protection of others to remove the
[28:43] leaven and there is a line that we could
[28:45] cross when a man lookth upon a woman to
[28:47] lust after her the crossing of a line
[28:50] and the Bible says that we ought not to
[28:52] act in a way that satisfies our lust or
[28:55] our depraved desires that no man go be
[28:58] Beyond and defraud his
[29:02] brother we should be mindful of these
[29:06] boundaries Exodus 20:4 Thou shalt not
[29:10] commit
[29:12] adultery modest
[29:15] apparel is for protection not
[29:20] oppression God looking out after the way
[29:22] that we address the way that we would
[29:23] act and the way that we conduct
[29:24] ourselves and I think it's all
[29:26] encompassing I don't think we should
[29:27] just
[29:28] uh zero in on one thing I think it's a
[29:30] whole character it's a whole life but
[29:33] the standards in God's word are for our
[29:35] protection not oppression when the Bible
[29:38] says Thou shalt not commit adultery it
[29:40] forbids all acts of
[29:42] uncleanness and all desires which
[29:44] produce those
[29:46] acts so it it relates to unnatural lust
[29:49] and things that would be depraved if a
[29:51] man or a woman uh acted that way or
[29:54] acted in a way to satisfy those desires
[29:58] Leviticus 20:3 says if a man also lie
[30:00] with mankind as he lieth with a woman
[30:03] both of them have committed an
[30:05] Abomination they shall surely be put on
[30:08] death to death their blood shall be upon
[30:11] them again notice that this is not this
[30:14] is what's Best In The Exodus and this is
[30:16] what's best thousands of years ago and
[30:18] as we've progressed in a society we
[30:19] become more tolerable and these things
[30:21] are okay and God loves everybody and
[30:24] with Christ God's what God hated before
[30:26] through Christ God's now with no there's
[30:29] an amplification of those things which
[30:31] God hates and here if they have
[30:33] committed these things it is an
[30:36] Abomination it is a detestable
[30:41] thing and it says Thou shalt not commit
[30:43] adultery this refers to even unclean
[30:47] thoughts or
[30:49] desires to the Jews this also meant
[30:52] obscene
[30:53] words or impure motions or gestures are
[30:57] you following me to say thou shalt not
[31:00] commit adultery to them was not just you
[31:02] shouldn't sleep with your your best
[31:04] friend's wife a a and to commit adultery
[31:07] as a married person but it says it
[31:08] includes thoughts that are wrong obscene
[31:10] words emotions or gestures that are
[31:14] evil because all these things are
[31:18] unclean and there's acts that we can
[31:20] engage in that satisfi these unnatural
[31:23] desires and these depraved desires
[31:25] whatsoever in itself was unclean or
[31:28] tends to uncleanness they considered
[31:31] adultery whatsoever was
[31:33] unclean or tended to uncleanness they
[31:37] considered
[31:39] adultery I believe this is why certain
[31:41] garments that a woman could wear I think
[31:43] it's one of the reasons why uh uh tight
[31:46] fitting clothes or certain uh necklines
[31:49] or short skirts and even the way that
[31:51] they can be fashioned are all done for
[31:53] the purpose of creating uh attention and
[31:56] getting attention and it's things that
[31:58] can cause a violation of Matthew 5:28 I
[32:02] know the attitude anymore is that well I
[32:04] I should be able to dress however I want
[32:06] present myself however I want and if you
[32:08] augle if you mistreat me if you say
[32:10] something if you do something then that
[32:12] that's a harassment or that's abuse and
[32:14] that's an assault and you should be
[32:16] guilty of it but to me it demonstrates
[32:18] the insanity that someone could dress in
[32:21] a way that discloses their body that
[32:23] suggests themselves and if a man says
[32:26] something or does something in resp
[32:27] response to that provoc provocation then
[32:30] they are the ones that are guilty and
[32:32] before the woman herself would have been
[32:35] guilty as we showed the article here
[32:38] recently that it was against the law for
[32:39] women to wear pants at a certain up to a
[32:42] certain uh timeline it was illegal to
[32:45] wear it until the
[32:47] 1940s why because these things
[32:50] are uh they're disrespecting themselves
[32:54] and
[32:55] others I believe it comes down to that
[32:58] when we are asking ourselves how that we
[32:59] ought to dress we want to do all that we
[33:01] can to preserve our own integrity and be
[33:03] mindful of the Integrity of others in
[33:06] Romans chapter 1 start with verse
[33:09] 23 and on some of these I'm just giving
[33:11] you the uh um the passage I'm going to
[33:15] skip to 23 because so you can turn in
[33:16] your Bibles and maybe make that more of
[33:18] a habit and change the glory of the
[33:20] uncorruptible god into an image made
[33:22] like to the corruptible man this is
[33:24] ruining the image of God and to birds
[33:26] and four-footed beasts and creep things
[33:28] wherefore God also gave them up to
[33:30] uncleanness through the lust of their
[33:32] own Hearts to dis dishonor their own
[33:35] bodies between themselves who changed
[33:38] the truth of God into a lie and
[33:40] worshiped and serve the creature more
[33:42] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[33:44] amen for this cause God gave them up
[33:47] unto vile affections they have crossed
[33:49] the line that now they're going to
[33:51] dishonor their own bodies between
[33:54] themselves and now God is going to give
[33:56] them over to this for even their women
[33:58] did change the natural use into that
[34:01] which is against
[34:03] nature there is male and there is
[34:05] female and when we begin to try to break
[34:08] down those distinctions or add many more
[34:11] distinctions to it there's a way that
[34:13] now we are no longer acting according to
[34:15] our nature and women give up their
[34:17] natural use and they change it into what
[34:19] is against nature and likewise also the
[34:21] men leaving the natural use of the woman
[34:23] burned in their lust one toward another
[34:25] men with men working that which is is
[34:28] unseemly improper unfitting and
[34:31] receiving in themselves that recompense
[34:33] of their a which was meat even as they
[34:35] did not like to retain God in their
[34:37] knowledge God gave them over to a
[34:39] reprobate mind to do those things which
[34:41] are not convenient if it's inconvenient
[34:44] it's unfitting it's
[34:46] unseemly does not as the Bible say here
[34:48] does not honor nature it's not proper
[34:51] it's not fitting it's Unbecoming it's
[34:53] shameful and as these scriptures relate
[34:56] to uncleanness or sexual perversion or
[34:58] sexual attraction Jesus says he that
[35:01] looks upon a woman to lust after her
[35:03] hath committed adultery already with her
[35:06] in his heart shows that the way a woman
[35:09] looks is connected to these other
[35:11] principles in scripture of adultery and
[35:14] Abominations and changing the natural
[35:17] use into something that is
[35:23] unfitting trying to walk through this as
[35:26] delicately as I can
[35:28] I shown you scripturally why these
[35:30] standards exist trusting that you as a
[35:32] Believer would be the one that would
[35:34] identify what pleases the Lord in the
[35:36] way that you
[35:38] dress but these these these the
[35:41] principle of modesty is connected with
[35:43] this danger of
[35:45] adultery there's other principles in
[35:46] scripture and in the message of the hour
[35:48] you'll find that on its face you say I
[35:50] can't find a scripture that says this
[35:51] but then you begin to find other
[35:52] scriptures that speak to the danger of
[35:55] transgressing in that thing
[35:58] be really hard maybe to find uh I can't
[36:01] find any scriptures on uh on cell phones
[36:04] or I can't find any quotes on on uh
[36:07] laptops and so we kind of carve out this
[36:09] little niche of things that we can use
[36:11] but no we find principles that those
[36:13] things violate and that's what causes us
[36:15] to set the proper boundaries in our
[36:18] lives now Genesis 3: 5 and six I want to
[36:22] look at this and I I hope I'm making
[36:24] good enough time here
[36:27] but as we often do we end up back in
[36:30] Genesis to see and and I'm looking at
[36:32] this too there was this original picture
[36:34] that God had painted and it's that
[36:35] picture that Satan
[36:37] marred and here the serpent is talking
[36:39] to the woman about God's requirements
[36:42] God's boundaries for God doth know that
[36:45] the day that you transgress this
[36:47] boundary that in that day you eat
[36:50] thereof then your eyes shall be open and
[36:51] you shall be as Gods knowing good and
[36:54] evil Now Catch what happens with the
[36:56] woman and when the woman saw that the
[36:59] tree was good for food and that it was
[37:00] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[37:02] desired to make one wise she took of the
[37:04] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[37:06] into her husband with her and he did
[37:09] eat this verb saw the woman when the
[37:12] woman saw it's this intense inner
[37:15] struggle it's this uh it's an
[37:17] intellectual activity it's not
[37:19] necessarily a craving of the Body for a
[37:22] uh nutrients or hunger for something
[37:25] that would
[37:26] satisfy uh hunger pains this is an
[37:29] intense inner struggle when the woman
[37:33] saw and what she saw wasn't
[37:37] right she looked
[37:39] incorrectly so this process in her mind
[37:41] this wrong meditation in her mind about
[37:44] something forbidden just to begin to
[37:45] entertain it long enough to say well God
[37:48] said no but this entertaining begins to
[37:51] happen and sin we know begins in the
[37:53] mind and the battle is First lost in our
[37:56] thinking so that's where the devil wants
[37:58] to
[37:59] work and so in verse five what Satan
[38:02] does is he paints God as
[38:05] selfish he paints God as controlling and
[38:08] that God has established these
[38:09] parameters solely for his own gain and
[38:11] his own benefit to keep something away
[38:13] from you to be restrictive to to bind
[38:16] you to subjugate you and so if the devil
[38:19] can just begin to cause you to think in
[38:21] your mind that God's requirements are
[38:24] honorous so there are two uh uh uh two
[38:27] binding too
[38:30] oppressive and to question God's
[38:32] Integrity this is ultimately what Satan
[38:34] does is he calls him to question God's
[38:38] integrity and she was led to believe
[38:41] that God was intentionally depriving her
[38:44] of some
[38:45] pleasure or experience that God was
[38:48] doing this selfishly that God was doing
[38:50] this without reason that God was just
[38:51] doing this because he knows that once
[38:53] you do you'll have this experience and
[38:55] your eyes will be open and that God
[38:57] God's integrity was questioned and in
[39:00] doing so it ruined the good in God's
[39:04] creation brother Bram and he's preaching
[39:06] the deity of Jesus Christ says that man
[39:08] lost his original in the Garden of Eden
[39:10] his relationship communion with with God
[39:12] was cut off there because of sin and
[39:15] unbelief unbelief in what the word of
[39:17] God he says a picture was painted one
[39:20] time to Eve it told her how much
[39:23] brighter it would be if she' just
[39:24] discard the word of God look over here
[39:26] to read
[39:28] reason mistrust brought the visic excuse
[39:32] me the visible Act of
[39:36] Disobedience unbelief mistrust produce
[39:39] the visible Act of Disobedience and
[39:42] that's where our clothing our Behavior
[39:44] our words the things that we would gaze
[39:46] upon become visible acts of
[39:49] Disobedience when we don't trust God
[39:51] when we disbelieve God when we don't
[39:53] believe his word and take him at his
[39:55] word then it's there's going to be some
[39:57] visible
[39:58] act listen consider it tremendously that
[40:02] do you believe it's wrong to look at a
[40:03] woman in lust do you believe it's wrong
[40:05] to watch things you shouldn't watch is
[40:06] it wrong to
[40:08] lust then you if you believe it then you
[40:11] better not continue to
[40:13] misbehave in Acts that signify and
[40:16] indicate
[40:18] Disobedience
[40:19] disbelief brother man to dis to
[40:22] disbelieve the word for intellectuals
[40:24] intellects and it ruined the whole
[40:26] creation
[40:28] this is where creation was marred is
[40:30] that when God had a boundary for their
[40:32] protection when God had a way of doing
[40:35] things that Satan could begin to cause
[40:36] her to think in her mind and begin to
[40:39] question God's
[40:41] integrity and losing the battle in her
[40:43] mind it caused her to act visibly in
[40:46] Disobedience to God and that's what
[40:49] ruined the
[40:51] creation brother Brandon's writing in
[40:53] the church age book in the Ephesian
[40:55] Church age he said the Ephesian age had
[40:57] presented to her the opportunity for
[40:59] God's best and for a while she prevailed
[41:03] and then relaxed and in that unguarded
[41:06] moment Satan planted the seed of
[41:10] complete
[41:12] ruination just as it had happened in the
[41:16] garden where Satan was able to paint a
[41:19] picture to Eve the same thing happens in
[41:23] Ephesus they were doing so good they had
[41:25] an opportunity notice an opportunity for
[41:28] God's best for a while they Prevail but
[41:30] then in that unguarded moment Satan
[41:32] plants the seed of
[41:36] Ruin when mankind responded to his fall
[41:39] Genesis
[41:40] 3:7 the eyes of them were opened and
[41:44] they knew that they were naked and they
[41:46] sewed fig leaves together and made
[41:48] themselves aprons I know I'm reviewing a
[41:51] lot we're just tying a lot of these
[41:52] things together hoping maybe just to
[41:53] close this chapter of this series naked
[41:57] them recognizing their nakedness after
[41:59] sin signified their inner nakedness they
[42:02] had been stripped of something they're
[42:05] now conscious of their
[42:08] guilt and they make here loin cloths to
[42:11] cover their private parts and then when
[42:13] God goes looking after him Adam still
[42:15] admits he's still naked he's not
[42:18] properly
[42:19] clothed and today where we sit today as
[42:21] we can see in the beginning Satan
[42:23] painted a picture to Eve then in the
[42:25] beginning of the church that in that
[42:27] unguarded moment Satan planted the seed
[42:29] of complete ruination today the lack of
[42:32] Integrity has resulted in the physical
[42:35] stripping of the body to match the
[42:38] nakedness or the spiritual condition of
[42:40] the people as they are naked spiritually
[42:43] they are now becoming more naked
[42:46] externally Revelations 3:1 17 because
[42:49] thou sayest I'm rich and increase with
[42:51] goods and have need of nothing and
[42:52] knowest not that thou are wretched and
[42:54] miserable and poor and blind and
[42:57] naked notice the contrast now to the
[43:00] Garden that when man sinned through that
[43:02] nakedness he experienced in his soul
[43:04] through this the the holy image of God
[43:06] leaving them this light having left them
[43:09] now in the and they're conscious of
[43:11] their nakedness now in the end they're
[43:13] unconscious of their
[43:14] nakedness in other words they're not
[43:17] conscious of
[43:19] guilt there's no they no longer can feel
[43:22] shame when they dress
[43:25] inappropriately Adam and the woman
[43:26] dressed rest in Lain cloths felt naked
[43:28] in the presence of God but now people
[43:30] are so calloused in their senses and
[43:34] they're so numb they're so naked in
[43:36] their
[43:37] minds they cannot feel
[43:41] shame Adam and the woman felt the loss
[43:43] of their
[43:44] integrity they felt the this they felt
[43:47] the ruin of their innocence they could
[43:49] feel light lifting from them this
[43:52] disappearance of light
[43:57] but Romans tells us Romans chapter
[43:59] 1 that people are given over to vile
[44:02] affections and they can do things with
[44:04] justification and feel no
[44:06] shame Paul writes to Timothy 1 Timothy
[44:09] 4: 1 and 2 now the spirit speaketh
[44:11] expressly that in a latter time some
[44:14] shall depart from the faith giving heed
[44:15] to seducing spirits and doctrines of
[44:17] devils speaking lies and hypocrisy
[44:20] having their conscience seared with a
[44:22] hot
[44:23] iron why are people living acting and
[44:27] dressing and presenting themselves the
[44:29] way they do today they're blind and
[44:32] don't know it they're naked and don't
[44:34] there's no sense of Shame anymore
[44:36] there's no
[44:42] blush it is as brother brandham
[44:44] rightfully called it out decades ago
[44:49] Insanity to the point we mentioned it
[44:51] here recently that certain things that
[44:53] were Bonafide
[44:55] diagnosable uh mental disorders they
[44:58] just say no uhuh that's a
[44:59] lifestyle no uhuh this is okay there's
[45:02] no end to it then there's absolutely no
[45:06] barometer no litmus test no diagnosis
[45:08] you oh that's the way they want to be
[45:09] that's the way they want to be where
[45:11] does it all end
[45:12] up it's
[45:15] Insanity so God has the prescription God
[45:18] has the answer Revelations 3:18 I
[45:20] counsel to buy of me gold tried in the
[45:22] fire that thou mayest be rich and white
[45:24] rment that thou mayest be clothed and
[45:25] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[45:27] appear and anoint thine eyes with is
[45:29] have that thou mayest
[45:31] see that there could be this
[45:33] consciousness of
[45:34] guilt so that you could have eyes
[45:39] open white linen this beautiful garment
[45:43] to clothe you that you would not be
[45:45] naked gold tried in the fire so many
[45:47] things that we could look into in
[45:49] Greater details we have in the past but
[45:51] it mirrors God in Genesis 3:21 unto Adam
[45:54] and also his wife did the Lord God make
[45:57] coats of skin and clothe
[46:00] them the bride in the end is AR
[46:03] raay and beautiful
[46:06] garments God has a provided way for us
[46:08] to be clothed in humility and modesty
[46:11] Wednesday night we were looking at the
[46:14] so many scriptures that use the example
[46:17] of how clothing and garments do what
[46:19] they do what they accomplish and those
[46:21] of you are here Wednesday night uh if
[46:23] you agree and if you're member you can
[46:25] say amen and it can kind of encourage
[46:26] the other people say oh okay that's what
[46:27] he talked about all right but on
[46:29] Wednesday night we were showing over and
[46:30] over again a spiritual type using
[46:33] clothing you wear as a spiritual type of
[46:35] how we are spiritually with this putting
[46:37] on this and putting on that and putting
[46:39] on these things and get dressed in this
[46:42] and we made this very simple point that
[46:44] if God is going to use the example of
[46:47] the kinds of clothes that you wear to
[46:49] signify the spiritual character of
[46:51] Christ would he not can be concerned
[46:54] with your actual literal clothing and
[46:57] the answer is absolutely yes because the
[46:59] Bible refers to the same and just as
[47:01] there ought to be modesty in spirit
[47:03] there should be modesty in dress just as
[47:05] there ought to be bowels of kindness and
[47:07] and you dress and you put on the new man
[47:08] who's renewed a certain way then there
[47:10] ought to be a way that we dress as
[47:11] Christians that at least give the
[47:14] opportunity for God's light to be
[47:15] broadcast to others that they can see
[47:18] modesty and Holiness in a very dark
[47:20] time I want you to think about this
[47:22] scripture just a little bit
[47:24] differently and this is where I'm
[47:26] wanting to look at maybe this thought of
[47:27] Integrity being restored this wholeness
[47:30] this Purity Isaiah 60:2 for Behold The
[47:33] Darkness shall cover the Earth engross
[47:35] Darkness the people it's a covering it's
[47:40] clothing darkness is going to cover the
[47:42] Earth gross darkness is now what covers
[47:46] people they have not put on the armor of
[47:48] light they're not putting on modesty
[47:50] they're not dressing in a way that would
[47:52] please God and show respect to mankind
[47:54] the Earth is dressed in in perversion
[47:58] but the Lord shall rise upon thee and
[48:02] His glory shall be seen upon
[48:05] thee that would be my prayer Lord I want
[48:08] to even in the way that not just what I
[48:09] say and what I do but even Lord in a way
[48:11] as a man if there's a way that I can
[48:13] dress so that your glory can be seen I
[48:17] want to do that
[48:20] Lord I hope you all have an appetite by
[48:23] the time I'm done I'm realizing kind of
[48:25] maybe my wisdom de I'm just a young
[48:27] Pastor I'm new at this I don't know that
[48:30] on a on a potluck day you should preach
[48:32] things that make people hungry I'm going
[48:35] home I'm to my
[48:38] stomach this is the good stuff though
[48:40] Revelations chap 19: 7 and 8 there will
[48:42] be a
[48:44] people in which they are modestly
[48:47] restored the Integrity is
[48:50] observed the the the church world is
[48:53] produced behold the
[48:54] monkey right that's what they produced
[48:57] it's incongruent with God's original
[48:58] intent the original Integrity of the
[49:01] picture that God painted in the
[49:02] beginning that Satan ruined they think
[49:04] they've restored it but what have they
[49:05] produced Satan's kingdom Satan's Eden
[49:08] but there will be a bride who has
[49:09] Integrity there will be a people who are
[49:12] restored the Bible says let us be glad
[49:13] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[49:15] the marriage of the Lamb has come and
[49:17] his wife hath made herself
[49:20] ready she is going to be the only one in
[49:23] the appropriate wedding gown the rest
[49:26] can dress however they want but there'll
[49:27] be one who dresses herself in the word
[49:29] of God and to her was granted that she
[49:31] should be arrayed in fine linen clean
[49:33] and white for the fine L is the
[49:35] righteousness of the Saints his as gross
[49:37] Darkness dresses the people God's glory
[49:40] is going to dress his
[49:42] bride and this is for the marriage the
[49:44] marriage takes place now and as this
[49:47] marriage is taking place we're engaged
[49:49] in a spiritual Feast we read from
[49:51] Matthew chap
[49:53] 22: 11 and 12 and this King had a Feast
[49:57] this wedding Feast when the king came
[49:58] near to see the guest he saw there was a
[49:59] man which had not on a wedding garment
[50:03] and it caught the king's attention he
[50:04] said why do you not have on a wedding
[50:06] garment the Bible says and the one who
[50:09] came without the wedding garment says he
[50:11] was
[50:13] speechless this may seem uh unfair
[50:17] really really strict but not wearing the
[50:19] wedding garment he's not fit for the
[50:21] wedding
[50:23] Feast when the Bible says he's
[50:25] speechless
[50:28] he knew the dress
[50:31] code when he what's being said here when
[50:33] it's speechless it means he knew
[50:35] better it implies he had been granted
[50:38] the opportunity to prepare and he
[50:40] refused it the Bible says and to her was
[50:43] granted that she should be arrayed in
[50:45] fine linen clean and white for the fine
[50:47] linen is the righteousness of the Saints
[50:49] this age is not does not have an
[50:53] excuse we do not have an excuse to say
[50:56] well this is just the way that everyone
[50:57] else was doing this is just the way that
[50:58] I thought it was supposed to be this
[50:59] this that and the
[51:02] other he had been granted the
[51:04] opportunity to dress in the wedding
[51:06] garment but refused it the wedding Feast
[51:09] is only for those who accept the wedding
[51:12] garment it's only he that wears the
[51:14] wedding garment who will be at home in
[51:17] the wedding
[51:21] Feast we saw in Exodus
[51:23] 12 how that the Passover feast required
[51:26] us specific dress
[51:29] code the wedding the wedding supper
[51:33] requires wedding
[51:36] garments the time that we're living in
[51:38] now I could just go on a whole another
[51:39] Trail we are now feasting with the
[51:42] King we are citizens of another kingdom
[51:45] the Bible says he's prepared a table for
[51:47] us in the presence of our
[51:49] enemies he's anointed our heads with oil
[51:52] our cups runneth
[51:53] over if we are feasting at the T with
[51:57] our King if we are now in his presence
[51:58] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[52:00] the son of man then we we must be
[52:02] dressed for the
[52:07] occasion and I'd like
[52:10] to go down this positive path in the end
[52:14] maybe give you just uh a it's a just a
[52:17] general guideline you say well if I if I
[52:20] dress must dress modestly if I I want
[52:23] the glory of the Lord to be seen on me
[52:25] then by what standard should we be
[52:27] judging
[52:28] ourselves there may be a point at which
[52:30] we could all agree that those heels are
[52:32] too high and maybe we could do that as
[52:35] Christians we might even do that just as
[52:37] uh decent human beings that think well
[52:38] that's just we just have common sense
[52:41] ask a podiatrist those things are not
[52:45] healthy it it it's caused more chronic
[52:48] health issues in
[52:49] women H and that's substantiated over
[52:52] and over again over decades and decades
[52:54] just using common sense if we're all
[52:55] into Wellness
[52:57] all these Wellness INF influencers get
[52:59] rid of the hills babe right how do you
[53:03] have to talk you know how's the way that
[53:04] they do it now when they're all close to
[53:05] the camera and there's like this
[53:06] influencer hand signal they use I need
[53:09] to figure it
[53:10] out so I could talk in away and we could
[53:14] do these little short clips on our
[53:15] YouTube page where I'm looking up at the
[53:17] camera
[53:26] these are common there's a lot of things
[53:29] that could be just common sense that
[53:31] that's
[53:32] gone so how is it we could dress today
[53:34] how we can standard uh what standard
[53:36] could we elicit for our own
[53:39] lives we could ask ourselves what
[53:43] what is uh immodest or what's become
[53:46] what's ruined what Mars the image of
[53:48] God what what it has
[53:51] integrity and as we looked at Daniel
[53:53] chapter 3 we read the story of hananiah
[53:56] as AAR and mishael those are their given
[53:58] Hebrew names Shadrach mesach and
[54:00] Abednego are their caldan names that
[54:02] they were
[54:03] given but as an image was
[54:06] erected of
[54:08] Daniel and they were a commandment was
[54:10] given and I think we can also assume
[54:13] that from the scripture that the image
[54:15] was of Daniel because Daniel would not
[54:17] have bowed to another
[54:19] image but he would not have been
[54:21] required to worship an image of himself
[54:24] and so unless you believe that Daniel
[54:25] bowed and Jack Daniel chapter 3 you have
[54:29] to conclude that it was probably an
[54:30] image of Daniel therefore he's not
[54:32] required to do so and these Hebrew
[54:35] children knowing better at the sound of
[54:38] all those things that are mentioned to
[54:40] worship this golden image with the which
[54:42] the King Nebuchadnezzar had set up they
[54:45] refused to do so and then in refusing to
[54:47] do so they're threatened and they felt
[54:49] this coercion to bow to the
[54:53] idol there was the pressure of the
[54:55] people then there was the pressure of
[54:57] the king himself and it was look you're
[54:59] not going to do this everyone else is
[55:00] doing it th this is what you ought to do
[55:03] this is what is expected of you this is
[55:05] if you don't there's a price to be
[55:08] paid and sure
[55:10] enough they give that those great this
[55:13] great pronouncement our God is able to
[55:15] save us from the fiery furnace and then
[55:17] I love it but even if he doesn't we
[55:20] still won't
[55:21] bow the Bible says in Daniel 3: 211 then
[55:25] these men were bound found and notice it
[55:27] says in their coats their hosen and
[55:30] their hats and their other
[55:32] garments all right why are they telling
[55:34] us how they're
[55:35] dressed before they go into the fiery
[55:37] furnace well I want you to know that
[55:39] they were wearing coats hos and hats and
[55:41] other
[55:42] garments and they're cast in the midst
[55:44] of the burning fiery furnace it's
[55:46] interesting that they describe them
[55:48] before they're thrown into this fire and
[55:50] it describes a very unique dress that
[55:52] would have been appropriate for their
[55:53] service to the king in the gates these
[55:56] rulers that God that the king had set up
[55:58] and they would have looked very
[56:00] caldan they wouldn't have necessarily
[56:02] looked like a a Jew but in wearing their
[56:07] hats and their holes and their garments
[56:08] and these turbin and the other ways
[56:10] these wide long pants is the way it's
[56:12] described and they would have a a wool
[56:14] shirt and this outer mantle they would
[56:16] have a girdle and a turban that's these
[56:18] things that were being described they
[56:19] would look Babylonian they would look
[56:23] caldian so In This Moment
[56:27] that they're being
[56:29] pressured by all intents and purposes
[56:31] they might look like anybody else but
[56:33] they chose to do something different
[56:34] than everyone
[56:35] else and I use this example to say that
[56:38] we will look human we will act human we
[56:40] will dress human but we must maintain
[56:43] our
[56:44] integrity we must do so we must be
[56:48] honoring as we ministered on dress codes
[56:50] we must be honoring God's dress code for
[56:53] men and for women
[56:56] brother Brandon when he's preaching
[56:57] there in the summer of 64 he tells the
[57:00] of the preview of the Bride that he had
[57:02] in that Supernatural realm and he saw
[57:06] the Bride come by and she was dressed
[57:09] all beautifully and these white garments
[57:11] and long hair and and Onward Christian
[57:13] Soldiers just a beautifully pristine
[57:16] bride and then there was a secession of
[57:19] of groups that came forward and you can
[57:21] see they're coming out of each Church
[57:24] age they said he finally comes to the
[57:27] the last one which was America and she
[57:29] he said just had a little rag hanging
[57:31] down she was dancing to the beat of rock
[57:33] and
[57:35] roll and then brother Bram and his
[57:38] says oh no is this what my Ministries
[57:39] produces the bride will come in preview
[57:41] again and he says and that little bride
[57:43] this is from Feast of the trumpets each
[57:45] one of them dressed like the nation they
[57:48] come from just perfectly walking before
[57:51] the
[57:52] Lord there is a way that we will and how
[57:55] we dress May maintain some identity with
[57:57] the world there's even a way that you
[58:00] may dress that will maintain some
[58:01] identity of the country you're from or
[58:03] your cultural background or your
[58:05] ethnicity but there's still a way that
[58:07] you can perfectly walk before the
[58:10] Lord when you look at America Le to see
[58:13] her dress code was obviously
[58:15] nakedness no modesty no
[58:19] shame and as these hananiah Azariah and
[58:23] mishia were cast into the fiery furnace
[58:25] they looked like everybody else in
[58:26] Babylon that
[58:28] day but once they were in in verse 25 he
[58:31] said he answered and said Lo they looked
[58:33] in they said the men are not consumed he
[58:34] says I see four men loose walking in the
[58:37] midst of the fire and they have no
[58:39] hurt in the form of the forth is like
[58:43] the Son of
[58:45] God Is there a way that we can walk with
[58:47] Integrity so that people when they see
[58:49] us can see the form of
[58:52] Christ that if the whole world is
[58:54] dressed in darkness can we be bathed in
[58:57] light and the glory of the Lord clothe
[59:01] us and there they were in this furnace
[59:04] heated seven times hotter than it had
[59:05] ever been heated
[59:15] before and God comes down in the flame
[59:17] with
[59:20] them and I think they in verse 27 they
[59:23] leave out the sheriffs I don't know why
[59:25] but it says in the princes Governors and
[59:28] captains and the King's counselors being
[59:30] gathered together saw these
[59:32] men what happens they're called forth
[59:35] from the
[59:36] flame he called them
[59:39] forth and they came forth the Bible says
[59:42] out of the midst of the fire and now
[59:46] everyone could
[59:48] witness upon whose bodies the fire had
[59:51] no
[59:52] power nor was an hair of their head
[59:56] singed think of this and this this
[59:59] application we can have today neither
[1:00:01] were their coats changed nor the smell
[1:00:03] of fire had passed on
[1:00:06] them this is quite a standard but they
[1:00:09] went into the fire and God was with them
[1:00:12] and because God was with them there
[1:00:13] wasn't even a hint of the
[1:00:15] fire this is the way that we ought to
[1:00:18] challenge ourselves to walk through this
[1:00:20] world to where there's there's no scent
[1:00:22] of the
[1:00:24] world the the the fire has no power on
[1:00:27] us the hair of our head is not SED our
[1:00:30] Cults are not changed and there's not
[1:00:32] even the smell of the world on us what
[1:00:36] had they maintained to the through the
[1:00:38] fire their integrity the Integrity of
[1:00:41] their bodies the Integrity of their hair
[1:00:43] the Integrity of their coats the
[1:00:44] Integrity of their garments there was
[1:00:46] not even the smell of the fire on them
[1:00:50] the fire could not ruin them and I would
[1:00:52] pray that for us we could maintain our
[1:00:55] integrity in this end time that the
[1:00:57] standard we would like to have though it
[1:00:58] may seem to be General and it might seem
[1:01:00] to be elusive Lord I don't even want I
[1:01:02] don't want to smell like the world I
[1:01:04] don't want a stain of the world I don't
[1:01:06] want even The Fringe of my garment to be
[1:01:08] burnt by the
[1:01:10] world what had happened and they went
[1:01:12] into that fire is the Integrity of their
[1:01:14] garments once they come out match the
[1:01:16] Integrity of their
[1:01:18] faith it was unspotted
[1:01:24] uncompromised God preserved
[1:01:26] body hair coats all of it from the
[1:01:30] effects of the
[1:01:32] fire and I believe the Bible goes to
[1:01:34] links to tell us what they were wearing
[1:01:36] and their pants and their uh wool shirt
[1:01:38] their outer mantle their girdle and
[1:01:40] their turban to say that all these
[1:01:42] clothes were not only not burnt but you
[1:01:45] couldn't even smell the fire on
[1:01:47] them and I believe this is our challenge
[1:01:50] today maintaining our
[1:01:53] integrity so that even our outer
[1:01:55] garments match
[1:01:56] the Integrity of our
[1:01:58] faith the Bible says in Jude 23 and
[1:02:01] others Sav with fear pulling them out of
[1:02:04] the fire hating even the Garment spotted
[1:02:07] by the flesh spotted it means that it's
[1:02:10] a loss of Integrity to be defiled to be
[1:02:13] blemished stained
[1:02:14] spoiled something to be detested or
[1:02:19] despised garments here and in and in the
[1:02:23] scripture we saw they can be used as a
[1:02:24] metaphor for actions and behavior
[1:02:27] but it also applies to our literal
[1:02:29] physical
[1:02:31] appearance as the Hebrew children
[1:02:33] survived a furnace that had been heated
[1:02:34] seven times hotter than it ever been
[1:02:36] heated before our dress should not be
[1:02:39] contaminated by lust and
[1:02:41] pride the way that we present ourselves
[1:02:43] as women the way that we dress as men
[1:02:45] the way that we act should not be
[1:02:46] influenced by lust and
[1:02:49] pride brother BR said one spot of Leaven
[1:02:51] ruins the lump one word of God displaced
[1:02:54] spoils the whole
[1:02:56] picture if we're being restored we want
[1:02:59] to know the original original Integrity
[1:03:02] we're not being restored to do cosplay
[1:03:04] of the Believers in the upper room we're
[1:03:06] not being restored to try to reenact
[1:03:08] what happened in the book of Acts we're
[1:03:10] being restored with this original
[1:03:11] Integrity that what God what what God
[1:03:14] looks like today what he does today
[1:03:17] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:03:18] and
[1:03:20] forever and this is interesting others
[1:03:22] saved with fear pulling them out of the
[1:03:25] fire
[1:03:26] we save with fear there's this caution
[1:03:29] that we use and it's saying that our
[1:03:31] lives must be close enough to the fire
[1:03:33] to pull people
[1:03:35] out but we have to be fearful enough to
[1:03:37] not be touched by
[1:03:39] it it SS it's it's not going to work we
[1:03:42] said brother Aon after these several
[1:03:43] Services we just pulled all our money
[1:03:45] together and we've got a billion dollars
[1:03:46] let's just move in the middle of nowhere
[1:03:48] in Utah or Wyoming we've got enough to
[1:03:51] live off of we we've got all sorts of
[1:03:53] mem coins that are making us money right
[1:03:54] now and and let's just get away from the
[1:03:57] world and we've bought uniforms and
[1:03:59] everyone will look this way and men will
[1:04:00] wear this and women will wear that but
[1:04:03] okay but that's not going to
[1:04:06] work because the Bible says we're in
[1:04:08] this world but not of this world that we
[1:04:11] ought to have the love of God in our
[1:04:13] hearts that's willing to willing to be
[1:04:15] human
[1:04:16] enough to save other
[1:04:19] humans but Divine enough to be
[1:04:23] unspotted by the world am others saved
[1:04:27] with fear pulling them out of the
[1:04:30] fire no you're close enough to save them
[1:04:33] from the flame but you give great care
[1:04:35] so that your life's not ruined by it
[1:04:37] your garments aren't you hate even the
[1:04:41] Garment that would be spotted by the
[1:04:43] flesh you take great care Jude is
[1:04:46] advocating for care and caution of
[1:04:48] avoiding
[1:04:49] worldliness and the influence of the
[1:04:53] flesh but being close enough to save the
[1:04:55] those who are being ruined by it because
[1:04:58] the Bible says that Christ wants to
[1:05:00] present to himself a glorious Church
[1:05:02] Ephesians 5:27 Brothers you can come to
[1:05:04] your instruments not having spot or
[1:05:07] wrinkle or any such
[1:05:09] thing but that it should be holy and
[1:05:12] without
[1:05:17] blemish that it should be holy and with
[1:05:21] Integrity not being ruined not having
[1:05:23] spot or wrinkle or any such thing it's
[1:05:25] maintained its Integrity it's been
[1:05:27] restored back to its original
[1:05:36] Integrity I'll just quickly reference it
[1:05:38] but the Bible says in 2 Corinthians
[1:05:40] chapter 5
[1:05:41] that we desire to be clothed with a
[1:05:44] house from
[1:05:46] Heaven if so be that being clothed we
[1:05:48] shall not be found
[1:05:50] naked nakedness is not the goal going
[1:05:53] back to some sort of a original Garden
[1:05:55] of Eden to where we don't care if people
[1:05:57] are naked there's this idea even within
[1:06:00] uh intellectual crowds that the stigma
[1:06:03] of the naked body is something that has
[1:06:05] been conjured up by the Christian church
[1:06:07] or Islam or or Christianity and Judaism
[1:06:11] has caused the shame and so if you go to
[1:06:13] different places and maybe in some
[1:06:15] region of the world where there hasn't
[1:06:17] been contact with Christianity or these
[1:06:18] other religions that tribes and people
[1:06:21] can exhibit this lack of Shame for their
[1:06:22] naked bodies and they use that as an
[1:06:24] argument
[1:06:27] that it's it's Christians it's Muslims
[1:06:30] it's Jews that have ruined
[1:06:33] it but God in the very
[1:06:36] beginning wasn't intending that we just
[1:06:38] become accepting accepting of the the
[1:06:43] body but he desired that we be
[1:06:48] clothed and he says
[1:06:51] that not that we would be unclothed but
[1:06:54] clothed upon and he says that mortality
[1:06:56] might be swallowed up of
[1:06:59] life that would be my
[1:07:02] prayer is Lord I I I I want this body to
[1:07:05] change one
[1:07:07] day so this corruptible must put on
[1:07:10] incorruption this Mortal must put on
[1:07:13] immortality and when this corruptible
[1:07:16] shall have put on it's the language of
[1:07:18] dress it's the language ofo clothing put
[1:07:20] on incorruption and this Mortal shall
[1:07:23] have put on immortality what we changing
[1:07:26] robes then shall be brought to pass the
[1:07:29] saying that is written death is
[1:07:30] swallowed up in Victory I I I want to
[1:07:34] have victory in my character I want to
[1:07:35] have victory in my life victory in my
[1:07:36] home this relates to how we dress I say
[1:07:40] this with great uh a great burden in my
[1:07:43] heart for our young people to all of us
[1:07:45] that these things we may not preach a
[1:07:47] lot about it in this church but we can't
[1:07:48] just assume that we all know but there
[1:07:50] is a standard of the word of God there a
[1:07:52] standard of modesty in how our ladies
[1:07:53] should dress we get consider ation to
[1:07:56] not cutting our hair to the the garments
[1:07:58] we wear whether it be a dress or a skirt
[1:08:01] we we consider even the shoes that we
[1:08:03] wear and we ask ourselves is this
[1:08:05] pleasing to the Lord is this does this
[1:08:07] honor the Lord is this respectful of
[1:08:09] myself and respectful of
[1:08:13] others brother bramman choosing of a
[1:08:15] bride he says it this way and I I just
[1:08:17] want to Echo the
[1:08:18] sentiment of
[1:08:21] being unspotted from the world
[1:08:26] though we may have coats and hosen and
[1:08:28] hats and other garments and though the
[1:08:29] the things we read in Isaiah we might
[1:08:31] have some similar things with hairstyles
[1:08:34] and and things that we could wear
[1:08:36] brother BR says and coming up on this
[1:08:38] side came the same bride that went
[1:08:39] around this way and here come them
[1:08:41] little ladies again he says and each one
[1:08:44] of them was dressed in their National
[1:08:45] Guard from where they come
[1:08:47] from now what could that
[1:08:50] be I know brother Tim do had a very
[1:08:53] beautiful uh use of that he said that
[1:08:55] that each one it was a the bride being
[1:08:58] dressed in the word this is how it
[1:09:00] struck him I think he even ministered on
[1:09:01] it
[1:09:02] here how that the bride around the world
[1:09:05] are going to have the message in their
[1:09:06] own language and the word is dressing
[1:09:08] them beautiful type but brother bam
[1:09:11] identified them as coming from
[1:09:12] Switzerland Germany and so forth each
[1:09:15] one wearing that kind of Garb all long
[1:09:17] hair how did he know what nation they
[1:09:20] were from the way they
[1:09:22] dressed but he said they all have long
[1:09:24] hair just exactly like the one of at the
[1:09:26] first and here they come walking with
[1:09:29] the same song Onward Christian Soldiers
[1:09:31] marching as to war didn't matter their
[1:09:34] nationality didn't matter what their
[1:09:36] ethnicity was didn't matter what region
[1:09:38] of the country they were from they still
[1:09:41] found a way to
[1:09:43] dress that would may have been true to
[1:09:45] their Nation their nationality but true
[1:09:49] to
[1:09:50] Christ so he could see them and he could
[1:09:53] comment say oh my look at each one of
[1:09:55] them
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:09:58] dressed so perfectly walking before the
[1:10:03] Lord God help us to maintain our
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:08] integrity let's stand to our
[1:10:13] feet let's pray
[1:10:15] together thank you for your patience
[1:10:20] today gracious Heavenly Father Lord as
[1:10:24] if we had had an opportunity to go
[1:10:25] through these words today we considered
[1:10:27] a a wonderful
[1:10:32] privilege Lord but there's
[1:10:35] a always seems to be great caution for
[1:10:39] myself Lord I tread these things very
[1:10:45] delicately I'm I'm I'm very much aware
[1:10:47] Lord how that we could take the Bible
[1:10:48] and misuse
[1:10:51] it very much aware of the wounds and
[1:10:53] scars that it can cause
[1:10:56] if we don't speak the truth in
[1:11:00] love Lord we ought not to just speak
[1:11:03] these things as truth but take the truth
[1:11:06] of the word of God that says how a man
[1:11:08] should act even how a woman should
[1:11:11] dress and speak it in
[1:11:16] love Lord my prayer would not that we
[1:11:18] could come up with a satisfactory dress
[1:11:21] code as a church but that each
[1:11:23] individual believer male or female would
[1:11:26] consider how they can please
[1:11:30] you dress and act in a way that pleases
[1:11:33] you because we know Lord that if we can
[1:11:35] honor you in what we say and do that
[1:11:37] your word likewise in
[1:11:39] turn leads us to honor ourselves our
[1:11:42] bodies and
[1:11:45] [Music]
[1:11:47] others Lord as men we should never act
[1:11:50] in a way that would make somebody
[1:11:52] uncomfortable
[1:11:56] Lord we would never want as a lady to
[1:11:58] dress in a way that would make somebody
[1:12:01] uncomfortable and I know Lord is many
[1:12:04] conversations have been had on this
[1:12:05] subject that there's always some crazy
[1:12:08] out there who could be mesmerized with
[1:12:11] all sorts of things and there could be
[1:12:12] inappropriate ways that these things are
[1:12:14] handled but Lord we only know to do
[1:12:16] what's right for
[1:12:19] ourselves help us Lord to do those
[1:12:21] things which are right in your
[1:12:23] sight as one day we will take off this
[1:12:26] old robe and put on a new one an IM
[1:12:27] mortal body Lord may we continue every
[1:12:30] day to strive to take off corruption and
[1:12:33] put on
[1:12:35] incorruption Lord may we be human enough
[1:12:37] to rescue people from
[1:12:39] fires but Divine enough to keep
[1:12:41] unspotted from the
[1:12:44] world and Lord just as the devil was
[1:12:46] successful in causing your integrity to
[1:12:49] be questioned in the beginning and the
[1:12:51] woman lost the battle in the mind may
[1:12:52] this bride in this end time may we as
[1:12:54] individual members of that body not
[1:12:57] question your integrity but honor your
[1:12:59] boundaries and these
[1:13:01] landmarks and hold to them with great
[1:13:03] purpose as you show us the reason behind
[1:13:06] it the wisdom behind
[1:13:07] it Lord that day in the garden their
[1:13:10] eyes were open but not in a way that
[1:13:11] they thought would be
[1:13:13] opened with the of their nakedness
[1:13:15] they rushed quickly to clothe themselves
[1:13:17] but still felt
[1:13:19] naked we've arrived at a place in the
[1:13:21] end time lord where people are
[1:13:22] physically naked now
[1:13:25] they don't care they don't even consider
[1:13:28] it
[1:13:29] naked Lord to think that a woman could
[1:13:32] argue that their swimwear is different
[1:13:35] than their underwear on the basis of
[1:13:38] consent shows how insane we've
[1:13:42] [Music]
[1:13:43] become Lord may we no longer give
[1:13:45] consent for the world to augle us may we
[1:13:47] no longer give consent to the devil to
[1:13:50] cause us to question your
[1:13:51] standards but Lord may we dress in a way
[1:13:54] that respect you respects ourselves and
[1:13:56] respects others and Lord I know that
[1:13:58] there's very specific things we could
[1:14:00] say things that we could quote and
[1:14:02] instances we could give but Lord I want
[1:14:04] to I want it to be clear in your word
[1:14:07] what your standard is your Bible teaches
[1:14:10] these things we want to honor them we
[1:14:14] love you Lord and we ask all these
[1:14:15] things name the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:18] amen amen praise the Lord
