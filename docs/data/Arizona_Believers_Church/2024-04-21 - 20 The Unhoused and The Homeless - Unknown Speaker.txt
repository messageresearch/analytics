TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we are just advancing further in the subject of the house of the Lord and some of these things that God expresses here in these verses 7- 15 are just so beautiful how that he will build them a house and they'll be settled and they'll be at peace and just some really beautiful principles expressed there but my my title today and I'm really going to need your help as we speak on this is the unhoused and the homeless and even the image that we have here to me is conveying something and expressing something and if you kind of looked at it and tried to process it even analyze it as a work of art uh you might begin to identify maybe even some of the emphasis that I want to use today but as you consider this this phrasing the unhoused and the homeless I will just kind of take you on a sociology lesson maybe just for a few minutes this might seem to be uh uh you know maybe some political buzzwords uh but I want to draw on any knowledge and experience you might have with these terms just to teach something uh that I think will be a blessing and benefit to you but the how many have heard the term unhoused a few hands some nods all right then you're not you're not uh using CNN as your news source if you haven't heard it but the terms unhoused and how many have heard the term homeless right some of you might feel that way at times but these are uh two terms that I would say together taken together separately are the subject of some debate and we might associate the term unhoused as being uh kind of a the Progressive Movement or just kind of a a woke thing but they the term unhoused is simply used to uh Define for uh someone who lacks physical shelter so if they're unhoused they don't have maybe a uh a permanent place of residence a traditional fixed Abode and the this is just where I'm getting in some of the background and I'm doing this just to help us all be on the same page when I use these terms uh the to use the term unhoused the reason why some have began to use this phrase hasn't necessarily made it into our laws and into government programs but there's this movement and uh those who provide certain assistance and things uh those who are activists in this area of homelessness they use the term unhoused because they want to remove the stigma that's associated with the term homeless and if anyone has ever been unhoused or homeless you know understand kind of the ideas that people may have when they say oh I'm homeless I'm living on the street or I'm living out of my car and many times when people use the term homeless it conjures up these ideas of some sort of personal failures or weaknesses uh maybe bad choices or addictions things along that line and when the reason that someone doesn't have a house is simply because there's a lack of affordable housing and everyone that lived in Phoenix said amen or there's just there's certain circumstances beyond their control and it's not just associated with some sort of individual wrong and so they use the term unhoused just to remove everything else from the picture and only say this is someone who doesn't have a house instead of maybe saying homeless that might bring together some ideas of of these personal failures now when we use the term homeless it was tra traditionally meant to convey the same thing that someone didn't have a uh traditional housing they didn't have a fixed place of permanent residence an address that they could call home or that they could return to but kind of in the modern Evolution the term homeless kind of brings in this bigger picture of a a person's mental state of the choices they've made in Life or their character and and and again if you say well we have a homelessness problem or we have that's a homeless person you think of a maybe someone P panhandling on the street corner somebody who's not dressed properly and looks dirty and unshaven maybe a lot of things someone maybe who has a mental illness there might be a lot of things that we begin to think about and so it kind of supposes a personal weakness like I said maybe addiction or again a mental health issue but in the two uh maybe voices some that wanted to say well what's the why do we have to say unhoused or say homeless but really there's an agreement a general agreement among the people who debate this that someone can be unhoused but not necessarily homeless and this is where I start trying to you're I know you maybe in your mind you're already thinking where's this going did brother Aaron get kicked out of his house um but uh pray for me we are on a month-to month now so you never know what these landlords can do but there's a there's this General agreement that one could be unhoused in other words not have some sort of traditional place to live but yet not necessarily be considered homeless so they don't have an apartment they don't have a suite that they're renting they don't have a home or just renting or even owning but they they realize that they may have what one would call a home and I'm gathering this from the academics and from the activist and those who are very concerned about this space and dealing with these kind of issues and one of the original people I think was in Seattle that really began to use this term and it began to enter into the vernacular a little bit uh they were in this meeting at some sort of conference and they use the phrase uh these people are just unhoused because they have a home Seattle's their home and and they were looking at the sense of Seattle's where they belong this is their home they just don't have a place to live and so there's this idea that they may belong to or feel a part of a community they might have uh um sense of belonging uh Beyond just physical possessions and an address on a driver's license wherein uh they have a home because they have access to certain relationships and they have access to certain resources uh that make it more like home and provide the things that home should be providing so they kind of separated out the the physical structure of a house and all these other things that a person may need in their lives to feel important or or to make it through life or to succeed and they've divided that out that you could not have a house but still have a home now how many are really enjoying this riddle today and I feel like once I get into this next part uh when I I tried to explain it to my wife in 30 seconds without giving it all the way she was just like I'm I'm just really confused and I was like it's just too late to go back and try to figure this out again and so if you feel confused you know you're not alone and hopefully at least one other person tells you sister Elizabeth that they likewise are confused so you don't feel alone like if everybody's just amen and it's saying yes we get this and you start going don't do that maybe I will just make it a little convoluted but to use this term that you could be unhoused but not homeless if that could if that could be so it kind of suggests that there may be four potential states that someone could be in with respect to these things now I'll say this right now my the way God has inspired this began with the idea of uh maybe initially the idea of Truth and and when some people because we've been dealing with foundations that when someone begins to doubt truth that truth what if it was a personal truth a personal Viewpoint when you begin to doubt that truth your foundation begins to get shaken a little bit and when you start to have doubts you start to get uncertain about everything that's been built around that truth or that Foundation or that Viewpoint and I I've I've been thinking about those things and studying those things and it kind of was looking at the sense of having a vision a a and being forward-looking and proactive these are some ideas that have been in view so I want to my goal in looking at this and maybe this is just foundational uh and part one is to provoke a vision in your own life a a vision for your home and for your life that you would begin to seek after wisdom and desire better understanding of the word of God God's purpose for your life just uh begin to kind of roll up your sleeves a little bit and get serious uh not just about the word because in some ways we might kind of get theological that but get serious about life get serious about living get serious about your relationships and the things that you interact with the people that you have relationships with uh because there's uh we're we're living to leave and our leaving is going to be tied to that living and so we've got to take these things very seriously so I'll share these potential States and I was doing the math quite a bit last night just to make sure I wasn't just mixing up my A and B but if there's four potential States if you could be unhoused and homeless then let's just say that you could have house and home and that's uh you could be in that condition where you have the physical structure you have the Community you have the relationships or you can be unhoused and homeless as we've been saying the H the unhoused and the homeless where you have no house you have no home uh it's it maybe would be the worst so the best would be to have house and home the worst would be to be unhoused and homeless but just using and again I I'll acknowledge that maybe it could just be academic or or just semantics that if you could be uh unhoused but not homeless then it's uh then you could you could be in that situation where you can be without a house but still have a home then I want to propose or say it this way then you could have a house or you could have be homeless but not unhoused right in other words this and this has been what I've been proposing all along right you can have a house but not a home you could be homeless but have a house uh a place that you return to and a a place that you have an address and a place that you feel that you say that you belong but really when you begin to strip away uh or try to identify the things that really make something home you'd say oh well this is just a house it's never been put and embroidered and hung up in someone's house house sweet house right it's home sweet home it's not apartment sweet apartment it's not basement sweet sweet sweet basement site right it's it's uh it's a it's an idea that home is a place that has is beyond an address Beyond a physical structure and so if you could have house and home that would be ideal you could have be unhoused and homeless you could be unhoused and not homeless as the maybe the academic suggests and if that's true then I believe that you could have a house but not have a home in 2 Corinthians chap 5: 1 to6 I'm use this just to kind of refer to the idea of house and home and these different states that might exist and you may be in a state where you have house and home but yet there's a more perfect uh place that you desire and there's this transition out of house and home into another house and home says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God so we have an Earthly house but then he says we have a house of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens so you have a house on Earth you have a house in heaven and then he describes it this way for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that we would be unclothed or unhoused but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that had wrought us the selfsame thing as God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord so it says we are at home in the body it it it's still kind of drawing of this idea of a house this of a house but now he's saying that we who are in this body do grown to not be here but not that we would be un our soul would leave and be unhoused and the Soul find its home in heaven but not have a house and say no it wants to also have a new body a glorified body because and now he says while we're at home in the body in other words our soul has is at home in this house now but yet it still is not at home with the Lord in heaven so it's I think in this scripture it says that you can have the soul is at home in the body the body is just a house and that when it the soul leaves that house though it's at home and belongs here now it groans and desires to be in its Heavenly home and when it makes it to its Heavenly home it's not going to be unhoused it's going to be housed in clothe the pond it's can have a new Tabernacle a new body that is a glorious body a glorified body liken unto the Lords so there is a body for the soul now and it's at home in this world but yet longs to be at home with the Lord because it says but now we are absent from the Lord because we're going to our Heavenly Eternal home and that would be to me this idea an expression of having house and home that if we are if when we die and our bodies um go into the ground then we are waiting we are at home but yet unhoused in that in that theophany waiting to be clothed upon to have that glorified body raised up so you can see this idea that there's these states that one can be in that is not a death sentence or something's wrong but like you we want to ultimately have that permanent fixed unchangeable House of a glorified body but now as we live in this world uh we're not necessarily uncomfortable in our skin and we're not say and we're not just wanting to die so that this body dissolves but we say while I'm here in this world my soul has a home in this body and I'm housed the Lord has given me flesh he's clothed me but one day I'm going to move I'm going to I move to a new house and I'll be at home there too so there's an idea of the house and home working together so then there's as I said you could be you could have no house and no home and that would be a um it' be if I could say this it' be the state of one who's lost and if you have no house and you have no home that would be the worst possible POS scenario but let me let me just look at this idea of being unhoused but not homeless as that's kind of what the the uh activist might say is that let's not call him homeless if we're going to call him homeless call him a homeless person so we think of their humanity and and that they're an individual but unhoused it's like well they just don't have a place that they live but yet they have a community they have a sense of beling and purpose so as we look at 1 Chronicles chapter 17 verses 1 to6 and let me just say this stick with me I Believe by God's grace the gift Will Make Way for itself and get and get to something for you today in first Chronicles 17: 1-6 says now it came to pass as David sat in his house that David said to Nathan the prophet lo I dwell in a house of Cedars this is a uh this is not just a tent this is not something you take the stakes down and roll up and move to the next lot this is something that is permanent it has foundations and he brings this contrast but the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord where the Lord promised to meet and where his presence was remaineth under curtains so it I live in a house this is living he lives in a tent now if that doesn't kind of conjur up the image of a a homeless encampment or a a homeless shelter or unhoused circumstance here's David living in a house and the Lord unhoused but then Nathan said unto David do all that is in thine heart for God is with thee and it came to pass the same night that the word of the Lord came to Nathan saying now think think of how God characterizes himself go and tell David my servant thus sayith the Lord Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in so David you're not going to build me a house now that would have come as some maybe hurt to David and that's why he begins to encourage him and speak to him kindly he says then he says for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day and he acknowledges but I have gone from tent to tent and from one Tabernacle to another when it says tent to tent and Tabernacle to Tabernacle it says I've gone um from place to place I've moved ever since we've come out of e Egypt I've moved but then he says wheresoever I have walked with all Israel so I've been with you I've been among you and I've been living in a tent but I haven't had a house spake i a word and now and what he's saying is as long as I went from tent to tent and from Tabernacle to Tabernacle and was walking with you did I ever at any one time say to any of the tribes of Israel it says judges but it's speaking of this idea of tribes whom I commanded to Feed My People saying why have you not built me a house of Cedars God lived in a tent he was traveling from one place to another but he never asked for a house and this is in God's own language David says I live in a house God doesn't live in a house but you'd say well he's amongst them he's with them' but yet it wasn't considered a house as he said in Exodus 25:8 let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them so despite the fact that God did not have a house or what David called This House of Cedars and this permanent Dwelling Place it was he was not homeless he walked amongst Israel he was dwelling in a tent and as we could say this the unhoused have no traditional fixed Abode they have no fixed resident it's not permanent that's not a it's not a place where they reside where you know you could send a a package to it and you could send them mail they don't necessarily have that and God could say the same thing that you never knew when it would move you never knew when it would transition it could at any moment be uprooted and change locations and so the unhoused they don't have the house that God's talking about but they may have God belonged among Israel and he said make me a sanctuary maybe it's not a house but it was a tent where he dwelt among them and this was his family this was a kingdom of uh Kings and Priests and this is this is who he dwelt amongst let me let me emphasize this because this is where the real uh maybe heart of what I'm trying to express to be homeless it means you have no sense of belonging uh it it's this lack of social connections the lack of emotional connections and and that's in this uh I'm trying to think of it's you know the social economic sense or sociology and the psychology of it that if someone's homeless it conveys the idea that they don't have relationships they can depend upon they don't have these emotional connections that maybe human beings thrive on and they need to function properly and that couldn't be said of God he wasn't homeless uh but yet he didn't have a house and so when David desired to build the Lord a house he wasn't having pity on someone that was homeless or God without a position and God without a belonging but the temple was to be his house and his home it was the house of the Lord it was the home of the Lord because it was now going to find its place where it belonged on that that uh uh that rock the foundation stone the threshing floor of Ora it was going to find its permanent fixed above the place that God had envisioned all along the place that God was working to cuz now he wouldn't just be in the wilderness he just wouldn't be in some place but he would be in Palestine with his people in other words you could have built him a house in in Jerusalem on Mount Zion while the people remained in Egypt and he could have never called that a home even though it could have been a house but now is the time where he could have house and home so God had a house or God didn't have a house to prior to this point but he still had a home now if you could uh just by use of eyebrows or whatever you know subtle ways you want to say does that make sense enough to keep going okay good balcony okay all right it's just harder to hear you may maybe I should start doing on camera like this balcony now let's use the example this is now this is where it gets into just exactly where I hoping this could uh be some teaching for you let's look at the example of a local church what we call the house of the Lord a house of worship local church and then our act or are going to a church now this is not just in the sense of Any Given Sunday you use a randomizer and you just attend a church but this is the idea of there being a local church and that's the church you go to and so we're doing this to understand what it means to have house and home or to be un the unhoused and the homeless if I say this I'll say this if you stay at home and don't go to church then you are an unhoused Christian at the very least you're are an unhoused as a Christian brother brandham said it is wrong to stay home from church now you can try to have church in your home right but brother Bram says it's wrong to stay home from church it conveys this idea that there's a place that you go and if you don't have a place that you go you're unhoused as a Christian brother Bram says in the sermon God hidden himself in Simplicity a real mother wants to take her baby to church and that's the thing you should do well that's a good one to use right a real mother wants to see her children in church and she will take them to church and he said that's the thing that you should do this is what the messenger teaches about this church this phenomena of an actual structure with an address and a four walls and and a place where people meet it Con conveys this idea of some phys structure or meeting place you ought to go to church brother BR says then how can you stay home and be just as good as Christian as you would be a church you can't do it in other words he teaches and says it repeatedly if you think you could not have a church that you go to and be just as good as Christian as those that go to church you're wrong in other words those that go to church are by default better Christians than those that stay at home maybe be regardless of what you believe at home you can't be a good as Christian as those that at least go to church I wonder how many streamers we just lost that probably happened when I called out Lucas's outfit and brother bam is talking to somebody and he says the fellow said I can be a Christian and stay home just as well he says no you can't no you've got to meet together with the rest of of the body says in another place people say I can stay at home be just as good as Christian as I can at church you can't right yes understanding better what it means to press play and Obey I can stay at home and be just as good good as a Christian as I can at church he says you can't brother random often refers to Hebrews chapter 10: 25 not forsaken the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is so even in Paul's day even in the early Genesis of the church there were those who did not go to church and he's kind of calling them out that there's some that don't assemble they have their own ideas their own Traditions they have things that they do but they don't go to church he says but we should not forsake the Gathering Together the meeting together as a church as some might forsake he says but we come together to exhort but exhorting one another as so much the more as you see the day of approaching it it carries with it this idea that church is not just a matter of attend end in but it's a matter that my presence is a part of exhortation that when I go to church I am a source of encouragement and virtue to somebody else and that cannot be provided when I stay at home and so if you've got to look at it this way that you're so important that we all need you okay be here come but then also if you invert it you realize that if I stay at home I'm missing out on a scriptural Avenue of exhortation that's to encourage me and strengthen me and that's why I can't be a good as Christian as those that go to church cuz I'm missing a scriptural source of my encouragement I'm missing a scriptural source of being provoked to loving good works as he continues to speak in verse 26 brother brandham says in what Visions are he says we feel that every person is Duty bound to attend some church and belong to some church as a Christian many people say oh I stay home and read my Bible I'm just as well off I stay at home and listen to mp3s or tapes he says and that was me sorry that was just me he says oh I stay at home read my Bible I'm just as well off no the Bible said we shouldn't forsake to assemble ourselves together he says in the voice of the sign after the seals he says we believe that every Christian ought to have a home church that they go to every Christian ought to meet somewhere with Believers and wherever you meet that's the church so it can't be church if it's not a meeting place okay so let me say this there could be some churches that meet in a house and if it's Believers gathered together scripturally around the word of God and the way that it's uh set up and identified in the scripture that's where the original churches were meeting in the New Testament Church but he says we ought to have a home church so we don't judge a gathering just because it doesn't have a traditional Church structure say oh well they're just meeting in a trip Center are they oh they're they're written in Old Catholic Church they're in AEL hotel room who does that right or okay a hotel conference room that might make more sense right so is it a queen Suite um but they get wherever they gather brother Bram identifies this this is the this is the meeting place this is what makes it a church he says and trying to do God of service without it being his will God's will he says I'm so misunderstood and I don't know why this is going to be really important here in a moment when we get to question and answers he says I'm so misunderstood and I don't know why people think I don't even believe in go people going to church that's a million miles from the truth it was a million miles from the truth November 27th 1965 and it's just the same today it's a million miles from the truth if people believe that brother bandam taught you should stay home he said in one place and those who do not go to church were trying to get them to go to church there was nothing in brother brenham's message that should cause a light bulb to go on and say oh I I I can stay at home now so if I could summarize that portion with this a Christian should have a house of worship they should have a church house the place where they go to church someone says where do you go to church like oh well it just depends you know just kind of whatever I feel but there should be a place that said this is where this is where I go to church in question and answers part one brother bandam has asked this question I think it's the very next week he's asked a very similar question and uh in answers in a very similar way but just was running out of of space brother brandham should we go to other churches even when they disagree with you who wants to answer this for him sure yep should we go to other churches even when they disagree with you brother brandom is asked by women or sisters whose husbands go to different churches that disagree with brother brandham and he says should I go to church with my husband he's like yeah I don't think he says it that way but he essentially says yes right yes you should go what do you have to worry about sister you can't be deceived go support your do what a wife should do do what a Christian lady would do and so here he says sure yep Jesus did when they disagreed with him go ahead he says we notice here should we go to other churches and disagree with you sure says I'm not only the only Pebble on the beach you know there's just other Godly men everywhere I hope I'm one of them and I think he means this this isn't false humility and yet we could not argueing or disagree with brother Ram was like yeah you're not you're not the only PEB on the beach but you're the only Prophet who showed up to this generation right this is we wouldn't belittle his ministry then he identifies something very interesting I was called in on something like this the other day a group in Arizona called my attention to that and it's listen if you study the message on the spirit that exists in Tucson and Phoenix and Arizona you'll find there was a very particular Spirit amongst the pastors and the churches and it had a lot to do with who goes to church and who goes where and whether or not people would leave and uh and it's a spirit that still exists today he says a ministerial group said the only thing that we have against you brother brandham he says is one of the things so if you've created some narrative in your mind that when brother Brandon was here preaching that no one disagreed with them and nobody took fault with what he taught and and the people who are doing it today have lost or you know it's too late they did it then don't hide behind some idea thinking that he was with that nobody accused him of anything everyone agreed with him nobody withstood him they questioned him then and so it doesn't stumble us to find that there's people who are disagreeing with them even then because then you realize oh these Spirits are always the same it's not something new he said one of the things they disagreed with him on is the people that comes out here with you we can't get them to go to church anywhere they got children and everything and they won't go to church this is this is I I this ministerial group was not being shallow they had a legitimate concern that people who are following a very Dynamic scriptural Ministry but yet they could identify a very unscriptural Trope in their lives something they're doing where they don't go to church even when they have kids it's like what do they why do they expect to happen to their children if you just think of how God used church used organizations and used certain things through the church ages and even in the evolution up to the word coming forth and a prophet coming on the scene where was he preaching in churches and where did they hear this truth in churches and and through these traditional structures in these houses and that's how they came to the Lord and now they want to have this idea that once they've heard the prophet's voice they're going to stay at home but yet not provide the same framework that God used to get to their hearts and somehow just by some magic message Seance that they call the token and it's more like the toen that they're trying a wave over people it's just a fiction thinking that they're going to get saved by osmosis and said well we told them they were welcome to come to our church and then brother bam acknowledges something here I think it's very fantastic he says I know they put a pressure on you and want you to join so brother B's looking at it even in the sense of denominations and and the way churches can be they can be real churchy and pushy and there could be you know you need to make your decision that this is your church right it could be could be a lot of pressure so only put pressure on you want you to join and even for a denomination that's a little bit more uh you know you have to sign things or maybe you have to work within certain parameters he says but you don't have to join but put them kids in Sunday school somewhere and you go to church don't set it home go fishing and hunting wait did he say that don't he means don't set at home don't go fishing don't go hunting but it says go fishing and hunting says don't sit at home go fishing and hunting and things like that on Sunday you say well I'm not a legalist mm if is that not the spirit well we're not going to be legalists brother Aaron we're more message hipsters we're not going to cram it down our children's throat that's what happened to us right I'm not a legalist well you better be in that manner for a while dishonoring the resurrection of Christ you go to church somewhere so he's saying if you're going to be a legalist at least be a legalist about going to church you might feel like you're just living in Liberty and this is freedom now and I don't have to go to church he's saying oh my goodness if anything be a legalist about that going to church somewhere now if we take away from this what he's expressing even if you're not fully aligned with the church and I know this is this is hard stuff to chew on there's a lot to consider in this but this is the idea of not being unhoused that you may not be fully agreeable to the church you may not be in harmony with the leadership it you may not fully engage he says don't join but yet you go you attend and in Any Given Sunday or even maybe in that midweek you find yourself at this church and you find yourself there but you say well we had we don't baptize that same way or they don't really serve a full Loa whatever it might be and you might have uh disagreements and there may just be like we're never going to full integrate there might even be a feeling in your heart that this isn't these aren't people that I want my children to intermar with uh and so there's this realization and again I realize that I'm kind of cracking open a door on a very complex issue but yet brother brandom's approach it from the standpoint of man you've got to honor the word of the Lord don't stay at home that it's a bigger danger ground to stay at home this is hard for me to say it's bigger danger to stay at home than it would be to go to a church that you don't fully agree with wow and I I trust that you have enough of a foundation in the word of God to where that's you're not taking that the wrong way so he he continues in answering this he says if you can't come here at the Tabernacle get some church somewhere go to it if you don't have to take you don't have to take all they do so it's this understanding that yeah we may not agree with everything they do they may baptize this way they may teach this I don't necessarily agree with their teaching on this I don't necessarily agree with their understanding of that he says you don't have to take all they do what part of the bread they're serving you serve the bread when they got the garlic why you just leave it alone I know some people are thinking garlic I'll take it right with some of us like garlic he said that's right sure you go to church but again what ises he conveying if you can't get a full loaf get a get a slice if you go to a church and they're serving something that you don't want to partake in then then he just spit the seed out you don't have to partake on that and I know that that lends itself to this Dynamic where you better have a strong home life to when you come home with your children say I know they're teaching this and I know they're teaching that and we respect the man of God and we respect their understanding and God shows people what they can they got to stay true to their calling if that's the way the Lord LED them let's stay true let's not be critical let's not run things down but as for me in my house this is what we see in the word and this isn't maybe the church we want to be in but we need to be in church church and he's saying this is especially important to young children that's why I admire these young families that sacrificed to bring their children to church even on Wednesday nights when these kids need to be in bed right about the time the song service is ending and somebody got a peek of the slideshow and realized brother brother Aaron has 120 slides in his deck they're thinking when are we going to get out of here right but they still do it and then the core of it in their heart is I want my child even though he may only be 2 years old or maybe my my daughters may be at a young age I want them to know that this is important this is something we do and there's a benefit in doing it kids eat free he says that's right sure go to church wherever the church door opens you take off as hard as you can go if they don't believe well you don't have to partake and again he says don't join them don't join any of them churches but go to them I hope you understand there's this difference of just attending a church and going to the church but they saying there's not there's not a joining that takes place there's this not this connection or this harmony but go to them fellowship with them so there's a difference in fellowshipping and joining and in you this Union how do you know that it's not the Lord he said he'd make everything work together for the good it may only be a church house but you need one you listening you're following me you may it may only be just a church house but he's saying you've got to have one one can have a House Church but not a church home one could have this church house experience but not a church home and this is where I I think I've dealt with the one side now let's look at this other side because brother R is saying go go you ought to go to church just because you haven't found the perfect church does not justify you to stay home but now I want to identify this attitude that how some people L themselves to sleep by thinking it's just enough to be housed as I've been studying the the the etymology or as brother Andrew would say the Endocrinology or something like that of the word homeless it's very fascinating Shakespeare even uses the term unhoused in aell am I getting that right and and and so there's this uh the term unhoused May even not unfamiliar and even the the term of homelessness or homeless for the in the United States has a lot to do with the Industrial Revolution and and the onset of non-agrarian communities and things like that to where the concept and idea of maybe cities and this gather of a lot of different cultures and things was not broadly uh uh pervasive and so it began to really take shape in the United States this is in our vernacular and since I'm speaking uh in America we'll use this that kind of after the Civil War a homeless was used to describe these itinerant Tramps and that term is maybe a word that was used who were traveling around seeking work and so they would just kind of hop on trains they travel around the carpet baggers or whatever they might have called them they would just move around looking for work so they wouldn't have a base or a home and they were seeking work but the issue why they called them Tramps and itinerant the issue was not I hope you catch this the issue is not the fact that they they didn't have a farm or a house or a place you could send a letter the initial emphasis was on this and this was written uh uh in a book I was reading the loss it was the emphasis was on the loss of character and a perceived emerging moral crisis that threatened long-held ideas of home life rather than on the lack of a permanent home in other words they weren't judging these men because they didn't have a house they were judging them because they were forsaking the home life they weren't judging them because they didn't have a ranch and they didn't have a picket fence and they didn't have a permanent address it was more of a a lack of character and it was a moral issue where they had kind of become uh untethered from responsibility and could just live foot loose and fancy free and just get enough money and get enough work for the time and then move on to the next place and there was no real accountability there's no real uh uh um responsibility and so the concern this is I hope this starts to get kind of heavy hitting journalism now the concern wasn't the lack of a house but the concern was what was in the person's heart the concern was the motive and objective the lack of relationships the lack of accountability the lack of responsibility the lack of uh teaching in their life or the lack of being a teacher as they ought to be the issue wasn't the lack of a house the issue is a lack of a vision and purpose right amen now when this this to me this will be the part that hopefully becomes this this turn of momentum and things start to click today our solution for homelessness is to provide housing you you following me today when we begin to identify the problem of homelessness we begin to think we need to find them a house we need to build affordable housing we need to provide structures where they can live we need to give them a place that they can call their own but in the 19th century in the early 20th century when this become kind of an epidemic the answer was not providing them a place to live the answer was PR providing them a job and cultivating a work ethic the idea was to give them some sense of ownership over some sort of idea this is what I do this is who I am this is how I can make a living you didn't just give a guy a house you gave him a job the idea of creating a purpose given a basis for a vision for tomorrow if I just hop on a train and go work for some guy picking weeds in his field or doing something then is when that job's done I begin to think well I don't know exactly where I'm going to be tomorrow maybe I'll talk to another another itinerate worker I'll talk to one of these guys and we'll figure out where we go to next and there was this idea and this concept has been very fascinating for me to read about it of this new kind of masculinity and this manliness of of this worker and this traveling where he could just be this Maverick and go around anywhere he wanted to and there was this grave concern over this attitude because though they might have been working some would say oh we we need to give them a house they didn't have a vision they didn't have a commitment they weren't willing to stick things out and make things work and build a testimony just well this whole boo came over and did this and he's gone so the idea was give them a vision give them a purpose homelessness was viewed as a crisis of men reading this verbatim from this religious group at the time a crisis of men let loose from all the habits of domestic life wandering without aim or home wow men let loose from all the habits of domestic life there's a brand of so-called Christianity Christianity Today that wants to put the entire responsibility domestic life on the wife no responsibility at all a crisis of men let loose from all the habits of domestic life wandering without aim or home oh they might have jobs they might be working they might be making a living they might be surviving but they've lost the vision they don't have aim they don't have Direction they don't have a place that they come back to they don't have a sense of home so to them the idea when they begin to look at this problem in the late 19th century early 20th century that's the 1800 and the early 1900s when they begin look at this phenomena they weren't like oh no they need a house they were oh no the these guys need a vision the critical Factor then that I'm identifying in being unhoused or homeless or both is the lack of a vision the lack of purpose to be homeless is to have no place no position no purpose there's no sense of belonging there's no worth and so you could the let's not think so much of the issue is the house the issue is the home a Christian may choose to stay home and I think we've read enough statements today and I didn't even read all of them I'm not going to say are you proud of me I would say isn't that amazing that there's more Christians may stay at home and choose to be unhoused message Believers may choose to stay at home and not have a church house they go to that is wrong that is wrong but churches May provide a house for some Christians but not provide a home and there's a real danger when we focus on just being housed because religion is no substitute for relationship being able to have a house is not enough so we say oh well they're unhoused I have a house it's not enough to just have a house because again the epidemic and the problem wasn't the lack of structure it was a lack of vision like of understanding of what this is for brother Brandon begins to identify us to us some of the importance of the house that you are in because he says don't join them don't don't get in League with them be understanding of where you're going and where you're visiting where you feel that you're a part of you call that your church but realize if it's not exactly what you believe and what you should be a part of you're never actually get fully comfortable right put your feet up treat act you know my house your house be like ah I don't know about that cuz if it was my house we wouldn't be serving that right what happens when you visit someone's house when they serve something like oh I do not like oysters but here we go right cuz you show that respect and so there's something about realizing I'm not in my own home but yet you have this house as a church so we cannot substitute being housed for finding home religion is no substitute for relationship and the sermon discernment of spirit I think we've read this before maybe a couple times we might read it every Sunday and I just forget says you ought to have a place not just to float about from Pillar To Post now I want to come back to that phrase here in a little bit from Pillar To Post but have somewhere where you go to church and you call it your church somewhere where you pay ties and somewhere that you help support the cause that's more I think it's more than having a house take your choice but then don't ever disfellowship the other man because he doesn't belong with your group so it's this idea where now you identify with it I've chosen this church house but I support their cause I pay my ties I'm not this is somewhere where I call it my church you've I'm sure we've met somebody or maybe we've been that person before we say well um where where do you go to church and say well I go to such and such church but it's not really my church but that's where I go that's not a foreign concept now let me just interject this draw a pair parallel to your home life and think of how that you might have all the trappings of a traditional life a wife children or spouse and children you have a mortgage you have a rent you have a place you live you have an address you have a home life but really when you begin to look at it's really just a house life you may Simply Be housed together and not a family you may be sharing the same address and sharing the same milk and cereal and and and you might all say well this is this is my family this is my house but yet it's not really a home I know this has just been a real simple theme that we've been carrying for quite some time in our church but I'm wanting to present it in a language we understand we could have the pretense and it's just a house so we don't have the stigma of being unhoused but really when you begin to dig down into it this person has a house but they're homeless but John give me that title slide again and and maybe they could begin to look at it this way this is what some people are in their Church they've got pewes they've got Pulpit they've got four walls they've got song leading they got song service but that's what they are they're curled up on the floor homeless they're a beggar in their church house cuz they're not getting bread and all that's served is garlic they become a beggar in church they become homeless in the church house I wish I was a preacher now in the sermon Christ is a mystery God revealed thank you brother John now think of the the feeling that is being conveyed in this statement when brother bram's given a word to the church to the Tabernacle the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you I think of it think of it this way what if you're the one that is going to the church that you don't quite agree with the devil may want to use you to be an enemy and you don't ever want to be the tool of the devil and so there's this this interesting Dynamic where he says you don't do that where where there's a where there's the dynamic of this opposition he's saying to a church come cling together and that one that's trying to divide you he'll either eventually become a part recognize the air of his ways believe or it'll be a means that where they leave I I I know I'm just it's a tight rope for me may God help me may you give me just have some Grace for me if my wording uh has been a little bit sloppy I just pray that God uh doesn't allow the devil to misuse some of these things he says don't never Clan among one or talk and make yourself clannish we are one so don't let the the body be bifurcated and separated he said I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another what he's conveying to those at brandom Tabernacle is not this idea that we're the closest church I know this is just convenient I know that you're all a bunch of Methodist that don't want to cross the bridge to go into Louisville and no it was this idea that we're in this together we see things the same way there's a there's a nurturing and a cultivating relations amongst another and I know you've got the tapes on that you got tapes on what we believe and the tapes say go to church you got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder and to get in here to fellowship with your brothers I believe it was brother Bernie Garcia that used this was used this in his teaching he used this to is very very good brother Christian was fing with me on this very good teaching because if you study half hour to church and where did Brother BR nail this down so much where you have this idea well brother Bernie had a very excellent way of teaching this he said he talks about being a half hour early and the and he talks about the doors opening a half hour early that that's Church order doors open a half hour early and he says as soon as the doors open what does he say you want to get there I think that's good I think that's good teaching he says if you don't feel that way I tell you it's time you got to pray in cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us much more as we see the day approaching okay so you understand now that this that this and again maybe just hearkening back to the way brother Garcia taught it is that if the doors open a half hour early if you love the Lord and God is in your heart when the doors open you want to be there so we should we have this idea and this desire I want to be there when the door is open and there's a great benefit and blessing from that 30 minutes brother B even teaches us how that that pre-service ought to be and so he says that this is what we ought we ought to long to come together and now listen to the language he's using as much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine Love This Is Not Mere Association this is not just being housed to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know that you are my disciples when you have loved one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bit spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hat that'll just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it'll run him from the Tabernacle here here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything don't you do that listen don't be worried about hurting me don't be worried about offending the holy spirit because here I'll say this what ought to hurt the pastors when the spirit of the Lord is driven away not when you offend his sensibilities or his opinions or have a disagreement with him when we act in a way that offends the Holy Spirit and he goes away that's when a pastor should be hurt not just because someone disagrees with what he preaches I've had people that I admire and love very much tell me I don't agree with everything that you preach but yet they still are inow ship and there's still and you're all thinking isn't everybody that way about him but there's you don't always have to see eye to eye and that shouldn't hurt the pastor just because you see something a little bit different but when we act in a way that drives the Holy Spirit Away oh my that's what hurts the pastor don't you do that just wax that much closer together take the Buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night having the Buckle seeing it in a vision that buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another talk nice about one another talk nice about one another talk nice about one another so the tape is skipping talk nice about one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you you want to know why you're missing out on some blessings because you don't say nice things about others then the sermon blind bottom is oh there's just now listen this all right let me I'm going too fast he's describing something totally different in Christ as the mystery God revealed than really what he's describing in question and answers the next summer would you agree this idea that someone's going to church and yet it's not they don't completely feel a part of it that's the kind of church if all of a sudden there was a problem and things begin to get heated and there was sin and brothers are doing it'd be a situation where like we need to find a new church like this isn't I I can't fight these battles that there's this teaching that goes against the word of God and we've been here we've been a part of it and all of a sudden think this isn't where you go well I guess we better kind of join up together with it that might be a sign that something needs to change but here it's a different sense it's a different feeling like no this is what I'm a part of that the enemy is attacking this we need to kind of draw close together we need to buckle up this is a time of War this is a time of battle so brother Brandon makes this statement in 1955 there's just plenty of good churches around through here you can go to so be sure of all the fine churches you ought to find one one is somewhere and you find a church home and go in and tell them that you want to become a member of their body of Believers now the language he's using prior that we' read even though he's using it later in his ministry it's this idea of go but don't join you're not really going to become a member you're not going to be fully invested but he's saying now you should find there's plenty of churches to go to but find one that you can call home find one that you can call a church home tell them you want to support it you want to be there and if I could draw the parallel for home life for brother says you got to make your home Happy Where Your Children want to be there and where they would be happy to bring their friends and Associates too there so it's turning a house into a home where even your children like hey I want to bring my friends over is it okay if I have my friends over why they're proud of it and so church should be a home where you're happy to bring others if you are going to a church where you're not happy to bring others if you attend a church where you wouldn't invite or send others then you have a church house not a church home and let me applaud you and I I'm looking at at a church full of people who consider this their Church home but let me just speak to the spirit I applaud someone who has a house but I encourage you to know you can have more than a house you can have a home because if you're going to a church that you're not willing to welcome people to and invite people to and tell them about it and if you're not going to be there you should go anyways I'm going to be out of town but you should be in church you should be there you should be there you should take a step back and realize I may not be unhoused but I'm still homeless so now well I mean if I stopped here I'd have plenty for Wednesday night too and I wouldn't I could go fishing maybe Wednesday I don't know so let me say this from tent to tent as the Lord said of himself is different than what brother Ram said from Pillar To Post I want you to think about that because I think it's important to kind of identify these these a theme that what really what's issue if we get very legalistic we just say well they need to find a church and they just need to stick there and they just need to support it they just need need quit moving right and they're legalistic about it and they're more legalistic about the structure right than they are about God's vision and plan and purpose of a house of worship so there's a difference in going from tent to tent and and going from Pillar To Post if you want to look at 2 Chronicles 16:9 this is a good aspect ra show here it says for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth in other words the eyes of the Lord roam the Lord roams throughout the whole earth and he does it to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him so this is this characteristic of the Lord his eyes roam he's roaming to and fro throughout the whole earth this you could characterize God as roaming the Lord roams throughout the Earth but he shows himself strong he's doing this to show himself strong on behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him now as it's already been expressed in Chronicles the Lord was unhoused but he had this work and this Vision to bring Israel to the promised land and then as we read in those subsequent verses not just to give them a place that they could call their land but to place them in it so they could dwell comfortably and be free from their enemies and call it their own this is we're not just living within the borders but this has become our home so he was roaming and traveling tent to tent but he had intent the whole time to bring them to a perfect position and placing to establish themselves permanently in the promised land if I could borrow a phrase this might be from tolken not all who Wonder are lost and the idea that is expressed in that is just because you see somebody moving about doesn't mean and it may seem that they're roaming doesn't mean they're lost doesn't mean they don't have a plan doesn't mean there's not a purpose in what they're doing that there they you could all of a sudden you see a Shepherd wandering off like there's your sheep why does he keep wandering off he's going to find the one right there's different things that that may be happen in this Viewpoint and and I'll say this and and I say this as a caution to some of our our legalism because we're legalist about going to church but we shouldn't be legalist just about going to this church and and so just because you see a circumstance or situation where someone has moved either they Chang churches multiple times or maybe they move locations it doesn't mean that they're it doesn't mean that they are lost does well they're just homeless and and well they're unhoused or they're homeless and we start to use these just as phrases to try to define a certain person's characteristic no God was unhoused in roaming God was unhoused in traveling but he was doing it with a vision proverb 29:18 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he the vision is a revelation from God it's to know his will it's that I'm following his will if we come up with some sort of metric that just choose a church and stay there then God's will may be for someone to change a church or to move somewhere else and we've immediately created a framework that binds people to the house and not in the leadership of the Holy Spirit right we have to have a vision without the vision the people scatter without a vision that people live undisciplined unrestrained lives so listen the problem with someone going from tent to tent is when it's from Pillar To Post in when it's without a vision it's not in the perfect will of God and without that Vision they're just constantly making mistakes and they're undisciplined and unrestrained what I'm what I my heart is inditing in all this is that we must have a vision as men we ought to have a vision that as husbands we ought to have visions as families we ought to have visions for our lives individually all of you male and female you ought to have a vision for your life you got to have purpose we have the vision for our family where we have a revelation that is purposeful and forward-looking not a revelation that looks back to historical facts of fulfillment of scriptures or looks back to Vindication but a revelation that looks forward to Destiny a forward that looks I missed an is a destination we're looking forward by Revelation it gives us purpose it gives us a vision to walk in otherwise without a vision you may be unhoused and you may be homeless you may be both because it says he that keepeth the law through that Divine Oracle and Revelation he's happy so if you do not have a Vision you may have a house but you're still homeless you're not happy it's not a happy home you're unhappy unsuccessful without Vision that's when you're lost in wondering even if you manage to plant yourself in one place I'm I'm going to keep pushing further here because I really feel that this needs to be emphasized together this difference between from tent to tent I'm I'm wanting to acknowledge that God can lead a person in a way that to you looks like they're Meandering but as long as they're following in God's perfect will who are we to say and sometimes we get that attitude and somebody ends up in a spot and you just see him moving around you say man you just need to sit down you just need to settle down you just need to stay here what if it was Disobedience that got them where they are and because you don't properly equip them you just build them a house just house them we you need to stop being on house give them a house but it's like no the issue wasn't the house the issue is the vision the character the the the the this moral crisis so I that's a that's I hope you can see that that uh there's this Nuance there that we need to be very sensitive to because what's most important is following the leadership of the Lord in job chap 1:7 the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou and the and then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down it in it in other words he says I'm roaming the eyes of the Lord roam to and fro the eyes of the Lord is roaming now Satan himself is roaming but he's roaming seeking whom he may destroy he's roaming with the purpose of corruption he doesn't have a higher purpose his purpose is merely selfish his idea isn't to build up his idea is is not what is best what promotes what cultivates what would further the will of God he's going from Pillar To Post and when brother benam says that you just float about from Pillar To Post and he says many statements about this wandering and straying and going about it's it conjures up this idea of those that move repeatedly from one place or position to another usually in a hurried or disorganized way which results in suffering or at least inconvenience to be go from Pillar To Post conveys the idea of being tossed around without a clear purpose so someone could be going from place to place but they're not tossed they're moved they go from tent to tent but this is not uh without Vision this is not without purpose this is not selfishness this isn't just chasing a carrot this is the very deliberate move of God this is God working in their lives and God being Sovereign in everyone's lives but there is a habit and there is a way of living and there's even this we talk about Wonder lust where there's just this untethered from responsibility and from home life and accountability and they just always moving around a person always just going around it's hurried it's disorganized it's not with vision brother Bram says and many of the poor people wondering straying children straying around the world tonight without a church home Grant Lord that they'll see their air and come to the house of the Living God I'd like to just add uh my emphasis today that we see people straying even when they have a house because their Spirits aren't at home their lives Meander and they stray they might come always come back to the house their church but their lives do not have the trajectory of the Holy Spirit it it's that cycle of deep valleys and and maybe moments of of Revival based upon certain circumstances or even the calendar but they don't have that real overcoming and that real exhortation and virtue that they ought to have in their life he's saying Lord may they find those that are poor and wondering and strain children find a church home and see the air see what's lacking see what's missing and come to the house of the Living God he says in the sermon expectation Save The Lost bring back the wandering sheep that's gone astray strain around over the country no church home no place to go like wanding stars know they ought to be in their father's house feasting and dying on the good things of God not picking not being selective right could you imagine the toll it takes on a family when you go to church day or Wednesday and Sunday with the idea of I don't know how much I'm going to be able to eat therefore we ought not to have this shallow idea but brother brandham said just be a legalist about going to church just have a house and if you can't get a whole loaf just get a slice listen that's a dynamic for bitterness it's a dynamic for or disappointment and stress and strain on a person's spirit because a person ought to have a house where they're feasting and dining on the good things of God not wondering sheep straining over the country no church home in Ephesians chap 4:14 then that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of do by the slide of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive this characterization of children is that they're just kind of H uh uh impatient if you even look at in this sense children don't have to labor for the benefit of themselves or others there's laws against that but children are not expected to work or have a job children do not have a vision they do not have a determined course to stay on and sense uh there's a vision that a parent is trying to lay out and it takes discipline to get them to stay that course train up a child in the way that they should go but the child himself does not articulate and formulate a vision children are more moved by Pleasure uh the immature more moved by the dictates of the Flesh and the the momentary feeling that they're having so if I can say this that we henceforth be not immature tossed to and fro going from pillar to pulse roaming carried about even if it's just a wind of Doctrine or the slide of men or some sort of craftiness the immature are moved around as circumstances dictate right they don't bind themselves closer together they don't stick it out because they have no sense of belonging or home if we are only I I I I want to close I definitely want to close if we're only dictated by being housed we may forever be homeless if our only idea is I just want to have a place to go I just want to have a place then you can find houses all the time you can find jobs all the time you you you you'll just follow where that is there there's there sometimes maybe PE people may fleece the Lord and say well if I can sell my house and buy one there I know it's the Lord's will but you know sometimes there's markets that are such a case to where do that anywhere man just get a job if you can just find a job well I mean jobs can be had right so we realize there's got to be more to this than just being housed be we don't want to be iate tramped spiritually or even literally because life in Luke 12:23 the life is more than meat and the body is more than rainment God's kingdom is more than just finding food amen God's kingdom is more than just finding clothing God's kingdom is more than just finding work brother Brandman the sermon a time of decision he says sometimes today you want to find a place to put your membership someplace you want to go to church now listen and there's plenty of churches to go to there's plenty of forms of religion to go to sometimes I believe we even make the mistake of just kind of throwing a dart on a map in a sense and saying is there a message Church there good I'll have a house right come on let's be honest sometimes we're only we just want to make sure there's a message Church there and it's not is this is is this God's will right I I can remember this I I don't know if I've ever shared this testimony in this way but God in a very very Supernatural way he visited Elizabeth and I had breakfast and in I believe it was April in 2020 and we began to weep in the presence of the Lord and our hearts said basically God's calling us to Phoenix just completely independent of any kind of prompting it just happens and at that very moment is it okay if I say this Brother Scott Walker I we hadn't talked to communicated in a few years that very moment he texts me and he says I'm moving to Phoenix and I'll just summarize it and I kind of want your feedback on churches and I I remember that night when we got on the phone and we were talking he was sharing with me with just how supernaturally the Lord had opened a door for him to go to Phoenix I's like I know this is is God and without me telling him anything I just said well then you know God will provide right it's not just a matter of making sure you're housed but it's making sure you're not homeless it's knowing that a house is important but what's most important is that I'm in God's will what's most important is I have a vision that I know I'm know I'm going no know I'm doing God's Will and knowing that if I went and there's no church then that that should cause me to be concerned and I don't just want to go and be a part of just anything thing I want to have a place I can have a call it a home we talked for maybe 20 minutes and then I told him at the very end I said I don't know where this is going brother Scott said I believe God may be calling me he just gave we just talked as friends and shared some things and I said you know just follow the lord be prayerful God will provide and that the very I said I don't know where this is going but God may be called me to start a church in Phoenix he's like well all right then kind of like why didn't you just say that at the beginning I could have had my dinner already but even then I knew that it was no guarantee that if we started a church Brother Scott would be a part of it just because I was going to be here because I knew at the end of the day what was most important is that you follow God's will for your life that we don't have some loyalty to a house if I can say this Force housing is bondage yes it's a prison where there's a lack of agreement and Harmony and continuity and support where brother B says you ought to go somewhere you can support it if you're somewhere where you can't support it and you're obligated to it that's that's like that's forced labor that's bondage that's a prison your spirits aren't free in that situation but it says you've got to make a choice there's many plenty of forms of religion to go to but you've got to make a choice whether you're going to submit yourself to a spiritual church or formal Church woo people who submit themselves to a formal Church find a house but people who find a place that they can be a part of and will submit to it find themselves a home the sermon choosing of a bride I'm just going to have to read these and then and call it quits he's talking about choosing a bride and being prayerful pray for Revelation he said the same applies to choosing a church now you must pray over the church that you're fellowshipping in I know it's getting I know it's getting late in the the morning we're almost into the noon hour and I know you're tired I know some of you are drifting off but this this to me carries with it some weight that really needs to be heard because it's is an important principle brother Brandon says we've got to be housed but you just don't want to have a house you want to have a home this is so important listen you may want to you may there may be a part of you that wishes you weren't here today but this is going to be very plain and direct from the prophet he says You must pray over the church that you're fellowshipping in remember churches carry a spirit I don't want to be critical I realize that I'm an old man and I got to leave here one of these days I got to answer at the day of judgment for what I say tonight or any other time and I therefore got to be dead Earnest and truly convicted but you go into church and you'll watch the behavior of that church and you just watch the pastor a while and you'll find usually that the church acts like the pastor sometimes I wonder if we don't just get one another's Spirit instead of the Holy Spirit that's what makes a house but it certainly doesn't make it a home you get a place where a pastor is real radical and carrying on you'll find out the congregation is the same way listen to this I'll bring you to a church where I see the pastor stand jerk their heads back and forth you watch the congregation they do the same thing you take a pastor just gulp down anything usually the church will do the same thing notice this Dynamic just believe any myth or lie Gul down anything swallow anything preach anything swallow the people get in the same Rhythm and it's house their house but it's not what God's ordained it's not the way that it ought to be he's saying you you ought to be very Discerning about where you call what you call your house because if you're in a house where it's just the spirit of a man that can be a house all right but it's not the home that God ordained he says so if I was choosing a church I'd choose a genuine fundamental Full Gospel Bible church I was choosing one to put my family in so he said it's not just he said there's plenty of churches to go to but you should pray to find the right one that you belong in so that you're not just legalist in the sense that you're you can say I'm not unhoused right yes I'm not unhoused but really you're spiritually homeless yes because the solution to homelessness in the beginning was not just giving someone a house but it was given a a vision Brothers if you could come to your instruments in the balm of Gilead brother Bram says just the prayer before prayer for the sick I'd like to make just one little statement and I wish this above all things that you here tonight that who believes in your heart that you love the Lord and Something's Happened to you promise me that you'll find a good gospel church somewhere a church that teaches the Full Gospel the power of God his resurrection he says join up with those people and make yourself a church home when fa with the decision to stay home and not go to church brother B says that's wrong that's wrong go to church amen he acknowledges the difficulty in doing that he realizes there'll be certain challenges and ones that maybe we can't just thresh out in a single service like this but he's saying be a legalist about going to church you've got to do that you've got to be in church but have a vision have a vision that there's more and if there's more I want to be where there is more and I don't ever want to settle down I don't want to lose this proactivity in my life to I realize yes I've got to do this I've got to be housed but really God promised me a home not just a house so that we could say well I go to a church I go to a church and really we're not we're housed we may not be unhoused but really we're homeless and say Lord I don't want to just be housed I want to be homed I don't want to just be in bondage to a house and to be loyal to a structure I'll say it because brother Harold Becket said it God doesn't want you to be James Bond he wants you to be James [Music] free and many of us have bound ourselves to things and we're housed but at what cost at what [Music] price he says join up with those people make yourself a church home I want to have a home don't just stray around loose on the streets go get a good church somewhere of your choice how do you make that choice through prayer Lord lead me Lord guide me Lord where there's no vision I'm going to perish where there's no vision my family's going to perish I don't just want to be in a position where well we've got to go to church so we're housed no if you don't have a vision for where you're housed you suffer the damages of the spirit on that house you could just be gulping down anything you could just be radical and carrying on you've got to be so Discerning and prayerful Lord I want to have a place I know that I can go he says don't just stray around loose on the streets don't be homeless and I said don't just be housed get a good church somewhere of your choice where the gospel and the power of God is made known and the signs of eternal life is in there the signs that we in Christ can I be very direct he says in this place and may they find a good church home here in Phoenix somewhere or wherever they're from why because they may be here but it's not where they belong so it's not about creating a Mecca it's not about having a place where everyone can go and be housed listen this is not communism where we've established government housing where everyone lives in one structure and we're all just trying to have everything in common through legalism we we value the leadership of the holy spirit in individual's lives we want to promote that we want to cultivate that provide resources to where a man can stand in his home and even if it's in in a situation where he's finding himself H uh being bucked up a little bit and and has to just take make a stand and say honey I've got to be obedient to God's perfect will I've got to honor him in all that we do and this is God's will for our lives it may be difficult it may be hard we may feel that we're unhoused but as long as we're in God's perfect will we at home find a good church home here in Phoenix I I'm I'm I'm happy to say I I just feel such a liberty in my spirit to know that what's the ultimate is is is in the is in your own individual life this isn't a group move yes this is not a group move God is not dealing with us because we have a a quorum God is not honoring us because we gathered together as a group listen if there was only one elect person in here this morning God's presence is here to vindicate them to nourish them to encourage them to provide them a vision to feed them get them further down the road and he just used this whole dynamic to watch out after them and strengthen them who are perfect toward him to give them a vision so they don't [Music] perish and if I could say this if these principles are true look well the the idea the unhoused and the homeless some are unhoused and homeless some are are housed and homeless some may have a home and they need to find a house there's different ways of looking at this I realize but if we as we looked at this particular Dynamic of there being a church which we call a house and us who come and go to that church where we become a part of it or that's where we have a house and that there's this idea that we could be going going to church but not be at home is this summarizing enough for you and that what God want that that we have to do that we need to go to church but God has not structured it to where we merely want to be legalist to say that we have a house but God has promised us he would feed us he would lead you to your own fold he would give you a family something you could support and be a part of and so there's this prayer that we need to undertake in our lives to where we know that at the moment and at this time we're in God's perfect will even if that may not have been the case before and even if it may not be the case later for now I'm walking in the vision because the solution to homelessness is not just to have a house but it's the development of real character it's to have a vision it's to hear from God it's to know I'm in his will it's to feed on the word of God and be benefited by it it's to grow it's to be exhorted it's to be cultivated do you understand what I'm trying to say and so we're prayerful about where we choose to house ourselves because we know that we want that house to be a home and now if that's true about going to church how much more true should it be about the rest of your life if it's true about the Sunday mornings and the Wednesday nights how much truer is it about the place you return to this afternoon and the place you leave from from Wednesday afternoon how much TR more true is it in all these other areas in our lives where we're strictly hung up on the legalism of housed but we're still homeless let us not be spiritually unhoused we should not be emotionally unhoused nor should we be spiritually and emotionally homeless my desire desire for for for my life is to be at home I think it's even in Philippians maybe where he's talking about this I'm I'm caught I I'm I'm between two desires to be here with you and to be at home with the Lord I say it's okay to feel that way as long as you don't become homeless here and lose your vision here we've got to have that's my thing we've got to have Vision amen I'm finished today you can let go of your seats in other words you can stand
