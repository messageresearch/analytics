TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title tonight is fight for it and i was really impressed with this um this week and have been studying on the subject of fighting actually been pawning for some time on the subject of fighting a lot of the inspiration is just how how much we've seen we know we're engaged in a fight and it seems sometimes we get turned around in the battle and we find ourselves facing one another in face instead of the true enemy but i wanted just to share this in a way to encourage you this may be a part one but the title is fight for it and we're just gonna encourage you to be fighting for the right things if you look at verse eight i wanna start here and just kind of travel with me and this thought it says a time to love and a time to hate and that's a those two have comparisons one to another and are opposites and we understand this one may be better than the one before a time of war and a time of peace it's interesting that we often engage in war for peace we actually fight to have peace but a time of war it's a time to fight it's a time to do battle means to make war first time that this word is actually used in the scripture i believe is genesis chapter 14 and the battle of the kings there in sodom gomorrah and that's the first time this is kind of this whole idea of warfare and doing battle and fighting that's what a time of war is and then there's a time of peace you could kind of give whatever definition you want to that but would be tranquility time of rest and accord where everyone is happy dwelling together and this verse kind of what leads to this verse is a number of different comparisons each one you could break them down and spend a lot of time just considering it but it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven i think it's easy for all of us tonight just as human beings if we didn't even put it in the context of the word of god it's easy for us to accept that there are times and there are seasons we look at nature there are seasons and we see the different seasons in nature and we can explain them well it's this way because of the uh the earth and the relationship to the sun and we know that there's times and seasons to everything so it's easy for us to accept times of life and seasons but it's not always easy to know when each season is right we can say fall season well you just look at the calendar you look at the temperature but it's not always easy to discern a time to love and a time to hate it's not always easy to know when there's a time of war and when a time of peace is would you agree you say well there's a time to cast away and there's a time to gather well when is it it's a time to there's a time to rip and there's a time to sew we could accept that there's times for ripping and time for sowing but knowing just exactly when to do it isn't always as easy as just saying well there's a time for it it reminds me of some counsel that sister biscuit gave sister elizabeth years ago and she's two things she said that always to remember it's just a phase and it doesn't really matter i think was in relation to raising up children you know it's just a phase and it doesn't really matter and there's a lot of things that happen we can get all worked up and we say it doesn't really matter and there's times when things are happening and say well it's just a phase and i remember shortly after that it's kind of a long story but i'll just keep it short and get to the punch line brother tim dodd didn't get us to the airport on time and i was a little bit upset that we were going to miss our flight because there was a line out the door in grand prairie alberta of all places and and i was kind of seething a little bit that i was going to miss my flight and elizabeth told me she said honey it doesn't really matter and i clenched my teeth and said don't worry it's just a phase and so there's that's the challenge right is to know when is which and how do they all apply in joel chapter 3 verses 9 to 11 it says proclaim you this among the gentiles prepare war wake up the mighty men let all the men of war draw near let them come up beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears let the weak say i am strong assemble yourselves and come all ye heathen and gather yourselves together round about feather cause thy mighty ones to come down oh lord this is a clear prescription for war prepare war that all the men of war draw near and this is how this is how important this warfare is take the very things that you use to plow up your fields to give you crops to feed your family turn your plowshares into swords your pruning hooks and despairs because now every resource needs to be made available to fight assemble yourselves come together and cause the mighty ones to come down the lord and this is a declaration of warfare to turn plowshares into swords pruning hooks into spears but then in isaiah chapter 2 verse 4 and it says and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nations shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore one hand we're being told to turn our plowshares into swords and then our swords into plowshares our spears into pruning hooks and our pruning hooks and despairs means there's a time for war but then there's also a time for peace we may be able to place these scriptures appropriately and the time and season that they would exist within the uh the continuity of god's word and the millennium and the time of war for the believer but it's just used to give an example the very same instrument that you might use to plow up the field may need to be turned into a sword but then that very thing that's used as a sword may need to be turned into a plowshare in hebrews chapter 7 part 1 this will be a very important quote just to grab a hold of and don't let it slip your mind tonight as we minister brother adam says now all wars are fought for principles this is what he said all wars are fought for principles now every fight every battle every engagement has some justification all wars are fought for principles there's a reason that's why we have the same pick your battles i choose which mountain you want to die on what principles are you choosing to die for what's what's your reason for engaging in conflict because he says all wars have some underlying justification or as he says here fought for principles now this was a very interesting statement now if you have a little war in church it must be the right principle for those of you visiting don't try to read into that if anything we're in the honeymoon phase of our church just a cream of the crop wonderful atmosphere and progress people ask how's the church doing i always say god is being very gracious to us but here's an interesting statement where brother man says if you have a little war in church you could go back and kind of catch the full context during that season he says if you have a little war in church it must be the right principle you must be fighting for the right thing and each member of the church is supposed to do that so if there's going to be a fight make sure you're fighting for the right thing if there's going to be a war and he's seeming to suggest that you can have little wars in church but you must be warring for the right thing he says it must be the right principle in other words don't declare war over something that's not worth fighting for don't i drive down a stake and i'm going to die on this mountain and i'm going to choose as some people even i'm even reminded now that some people staked their relationship with other believers and even seemingly their testimony on whether or not they were going to wear a mask or whether or not they're going to be socially distanced and people just chose that mountain to die on didn't plan on saying that but maybe it's a not too soon to say it but he says if you have a little war in church it must be the right principle be sure that what gets your gander up what you roll up your sleeves for what you find that you want to start standing for are the right kind of principles because he says you must be fighting for the right thing and saying that he is suggesting at least giving uh acknowledging that there's times when you do fight and i would say this is a large this is a large subject this is the paradox of faith and one thing to think about when we say the faith or faith think of the christian life so much that's assumed in that but it's the paradox of the christian life it's the paradox of our faith we're both fighting and resting we find ourselves in two states at the same time it seems and it's not schrodinger's cat necessarily but it's by observation that you determine whether or not the person is engaged in battle or whether or not the person is resting but it is a paradox of the believer that we are both trusting and believing and resting but at the same time fighting just to redeem brother tim dodd he uh got me late to the airport but he said something one time to me that's never left me and upheld me through many difficult things is he says faith has to have something against it if there's nothing opposing it then is it really faith if it's so evident to the senses if it's so manifestly declared to what's observable then how is it faith but faith has to have something contrary has to have a voice of criticism it has to have some sort of contravening story or some other something else working against it and fighting otherwise how can we even be sure that we're standing on faith alone and so faith sometimes in order to be faith has to have opposition or things that declare it to be false what a paradox in hebrews chapter 4 verses 9 to 11. i choose to share this just to get our minds thinking on the promise of rest it says they remain if therefore a rest to the people of god for he that has entered into his rest he also have ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest laboring to rest even in that there seems to be a paradox let us labor therefore to enter into that rest unless any men fall after the same example of unbelief rest is such a large theme in scripture we could use the the the word trusting i'm confident we could use so many different scriptures to uh to lift this up we talk about the lily jesus says the lilies don't toil but it just uh taking no thought is then the example that we gather from that lilies don't toil they don't strive they don't fight uh they just seem to uh come into their radiant glory because god is looking out after them and then so we're told to rest in the same manner that a lillywood that just trusting god and the nature that he's given us by the new birth that is just going to produce what an autumn that he knows we need to eat we know we need to drink we need to be clothed and that god will provide all those things so there's a rest for the believer when they come into that place of faith which says i'm resting i'm trusting why aren't you worried why aren't you striving why aren't you doing all sorts of things i'm just trusting god i'm just believing but that doesn't push us over into the wrong kind of laziness and i don't provide for my family i don't work brother aaron why don't you have a job why aren't you paying the bills god will provide and so there's a there's something to it to where it's not always just the carnal idea it's not always to this degree and even in resting i believe that paul teaching this rest this to the believer he still writes to timothy in second timothy chapter 2 verses 3 to 5 thou therefore endure hardness i wonder if timothy maybe having heard paul preach on rest and the believer's intended to rest and timothy says yes i'm resting i'm resting and then paul says endure hardness he says let's talk to me about the rest a little bit more amen preacher preached me happy thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ so this is applicable not just to timothy and his calling but it's applicable to all of us as believers the image of being a soldier i'm on the battlefield for my lord i'm in the lord's army yes sir we're to endure hardness as a good soldier and this is no man that wareth entangle himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who have chosen him to be a good soldier now paul seems to be going more leaning really far into this analogy of being a soldier and it's because it's still applicable to timothy in his office and his ministry and his calling in his position as a christian he has been chosen to be a good soldier therefore he's going to be warring amen and if you're warring you do not entangle yourself with the affairs of this life that you may please christ who's chosen you to be a soldier and if a man also strive for masteries yet he is not crowned except he strive lawfully so there is a direct this is this is and i wouldn't even say an implication this is just a very clear uh prescription that the believer is going to strive the believer is going to have to endure the believer is going to have to war because he's been chosen to be a soldier and the sermon of thinking man's filter again this is another one to join with that hebrews chapter seven part one all wars are fought for principles you must be fighting for the right thing this would be the real gut check uh the real cornerstone of what's burdened in my heart he says now let us all tonight check our desires and then you can see what kind of filter you've been drawing through thinking man's filters talk about whether or not you're drawing it through the word and if i could caution all of us i would say here we are uh if you're here on church on wednesday nights we pat ourselves on the back i've said this before that if you come to church on sunday morning you love church if you come on sunday evening you love your pastor and that's why we don't have an evening service on sundays and then they say if you come on wednesday night you love word and so i trust that that's what's in your heart you love the word of god you love the things of god this is something that's very real to your heart and that's just a saying that's not a doctrine or a principle we go by but i want us all to not necessarily immediately begin to think about the filter being the world and religion and denominations and trinitarianism and the days of miracles are passed but just there's ways that our filter the word can get gummed up with other things and and maybe we're not drawing everything through everything's not getting through as it ought to or it's presenting to us an incomplete picture so we're checking ourselves tonight and he says check to see what kind of filter you've been drawing through let's check each one of us here and out across the nation check your desires and what you really want in life i like that there's a there's a gut check time maybe as a sinner as a young person when you come to god and you drive a stake down and you know your life's been changed and that filter's been rearranged you begin to live your life for a while as a believer and you know you're a born-again christian you're serving god you're making difficult decisions your life's completely changed you find yourself serving god in church doing things that you otherwise would have never done had god not change your life but through the passage of time things can kind of just slip a little bit and you're you're filtering much more than you thought you were and it's time to check yourself and ask what do i really want in life and is what i'm trending to and aspiring uh what i say i want is what i'm doing really leading me to achieve what i really want and then he says check what you are fighting for because there's such a wrestling such a struggle such a fight sometimes in life things that we fight for things that we're very adamant about things that we want things that we don't want things that we strive to maintain certain appearances that we try to keep up certain platitudes that we try to bolster or even things in our lives that we're striving and fighting against and fighting for and trying to keep or trying to figure out and maybe we just need to take a step back and say why are you fighting why are you even fighting for this why are you even struggling check what you're fighting for check what you were here for check what you go to church for he says what makes you he says it's good to go to church but just don't go to church only that won't save you just check a few minutes say is my objective what kind of filter am i drawing through anyhow it's a good question for all of us i would say that based upon the things i'm going to share tonight and so i'm saying this at the outset is not self-serving but it's it's pointing to what i'm going to be uh addressing or just supporting through scriptures we're all fighting but what are we fighting for on some level there's some striving there's some hardness we're enduring there's some difficulty that we're undergoing and it's a good idea sometimes to have a little bit of a gut check and ask ourselves why am i fighting there's a principle that we could tap into as believers to realize that we are given a task to do and we have a job to do and a job is always going to be difficult it's always going to be hard there's always going to be things that we need to be doing and as long as we are in our position doing what we ought to do with the hammer in our hands then that there's a work to do and there's a hardness that comes with it there's a callousness that comes with working in the gospel working as a christian doing the things that we ought to do but then there's always a voice down in the valley of ono right we're drawing from the book of nehemiah they're saying hey why don't you come find why don't you come find us in the valley want you come fight us in in the plains here and come away from the job that you have to do and put down your hammer and come fight or talk with us in the valley and that's exactly what the devil wants you to do is put down your hammer to get into a fight and so if you're fighting you need to ask yourself whether or not you're fighting with a sword in one hand and a hammer in another because you're on the wall doing what you ought to do or whether or not you've been called away from where you should be and you find yourself fighting and struggling because you're not along the wall doing the work you should be doing i wish i could would have maybe give could give more attention to that tonight but there's so many more principles but keep that in mind that you're working you have a job to do and if you're fighting are you fighting because you're doing your job or are you fighting because you've left it because if you fight while doing the job god said that's my battle he's promised you he'll keep you he's promised you he'll fight your battles if you're fighting while alongside the wall then that's when you hear the sound of the trumpet and those that come to your aid and defend you and you'll find that god will fight those battles but if you've left your position to run out and start a fight god may be saying i didn't pick that fight you're on your own and you don't need to try to win the fight or save face leave it just leave it you don't need any bragging rights you don't know i beat the devil on his own ground no no no no you think you won you've actually lost get away from it there's no pride in this you're not owning that battle just admit it that you're not where you should be and just don't try to save face or make yourself look good just come right back where you know you ought to be do what you know as right as a christian and leave the fight and come back and say lord i'm sorry i got my i picked a fight with the devil and i was writing checks that i couldn't cash and i'm sorry here i'm back ask yourself what principles are we fighting for what stand what am i standing for and i'm doing everything i can to stand and i find it really really hard to stand and as it gets harder and harder to stand ask yourself where am i standing what is this all about now i'm not suggesting that you'll find that you're not where you should be but when you do that and it's gut check time to find i know i'm right where i belong because he said you must be fighting for the right thing and we check what you're fighting for there's a point which you realize yes the battle's always going to be hot and heavy in this there's always going to be a labor and a warfare when i'm doing what's right for god and you can stand strong in revelation chapter 12 we're kind of going all the way back to the beginning before the beginning to see just how much there is a warfare revelations chapter 12 verses 7 and 8 it says and there was a war in heaven but abraham says in the fourth seal first thing in heaven was a battle and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and brother branham said the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and come to earth then he polluted eden then he's been polluting ever since so he the same devil who fought in heaven there wasn't a warrior in heaven then kicked down to earth and found his his peaceful jeans no he comes down to earth and he's been polluting and been fighting him and boring been warring ever since so no matter where you're born in time you're born into a war no matter what point in life you find yourself existent as long as you're here on earth in these dimensions it's a dimension of warfare and striving and fighting and the battle excuse me in the sermon the world is falling apart it says in our political world today and our religious world is just exactly like it was in the days of the first coming of the messiah it's polluted why because satan's been doing his job kicked out of first thing was a battle in heaven kicked down to earth and he's been polluting ever since the whole system is rotten our politics it could get no worse and our religion i don't see how it can get any worse than what it is now the whole thing is corrupted our political world man-made systems and fashions we want everything just everything so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy maybe an interesting transition from the rottenness of politics and man-made systems and fashions and everything's polluted but then he immediately says we want to take it easy and retire and take life easy amen i mean right i mean who here who here say no i don't ever want to retire i don't want to take it easy okay just make enough for the rest of us and maybe we can but this just seems to be the ambition i want to take it easy retire and take life easy life wasn't intended to be easy life is a struggle and i love this anything that's got life is strong as a struggling this could be a little bit of encouragement to you as we'll touch on here in a little bit that if you don't have life there's no fight if there's not some other desire that's been awakened inside of you to want to see the goodness of god to have every promise that he's given to you or to have a greater peace or to have more out of the word of god if you've got life in you then there's got to be a struggle he says look at the trees how they struggle look at everything that's got life it's a struggle and when we try to get some kind of system that takes it easy then we are wrong and we know there's something wrong there is no way that we could ever structure church and our doctrines and our belief systems to just make life easy on a christian the only way that we could do that would be to delude you to deceive you and to make you think that everything's fine but that would be the worst kind of wake-up call whenever the the illusion is lost whenever the mirage is finally recognized i've been chasing after the wrong thing anything that has life is struggling what is it struggling for to live it's struggling it's it's overcomings to keep life in you there's something that you're fighting for something that you're struggling for ask yourself in the fight and the in the battle and the struggle is it to live or am i actually am i actually working against life first timothy chapter 6 verse 12. first timothy chapter 6 verse 12 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses lay hold seize upon grasp do not let go to lay hold on eternal life to seize it there's there's almost some aggressiveness to it some intent i'm not just touching it i'm not just uh near it but i'm laying a hold of it i'm gonna have it my grasp and i'm not going to let it go this is something that you cannot rest away from me this is something that i i find no cause or reason to let go of and then it says fight the good fight of faith one i read in one place where he says agonize the good agony there's different takes on this scripture that would not want to use the terms fight or good fight but it's very plain in the way that paul meant it whether they would argue that it's just by type or just by way of analogy but it means fight conquer seize the prize fight the good fight as brother adam said that there could have a little war in the church so you must be writing fighting the must be the right principle you must be fighting for the right thing paul's saying if you're going to fight fight for the right thing fight the good fight of faith so there is a fight of faith which is the good one if it's not a faith then it's the wrong one you could be fighting but if it's not the fight uh the good fight of faith and it's the wrong fight or the bad fight of not faith or the bad fight of unbelief and you could get your knuckles bloody and you could wear yourself out you get pretty exhausted and you might feel like you've done something but you're in the wrong fight so he says agonize the good agony be don't be weary in well doing if you suffer for good sake think of all the scriptures that tell us that even when we're doing good and even when we're doing right there's a cost there's a tax there's something that can happen to the individual so be sure that if you're spending be sure that if you're being spent be sure that if there's some loss you're doing it for something that is the ultimate gain and you're not throwing everything away for something that's not worth it paul could come to the end of his ministry in 2nd timothy chapter 4 verse 7 say i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith the christian life is a fight strife against sin the world the flesh and the devil even though our present dominion are over those things we find to have dominion there's a fight we have a fight with earth and hell while we're on earth it might seem to be peculiar to think of it that way but the christian life having received the holy ghost there's still a fight in ephesians chapter 2 verse 6 and speaking of christ and what he's done for us in such uh a beautiful picture and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus what what a beautiful sounding place to be we've been raised up to sit together where are you sitting in heavenly places right in heavenly places we could just hear the heart plan we feel the gentle breeze we we get a vision of paradise and all the luxuries and all the amenities and at least all the spiritual benefits that come with heaven yes we've been raised up seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus on the right hand of power we we could see all these things that come with that image of being raised up right raised up into heavenly places but this isn't a place to sit and knees around we're not elevated to relax but elevated to fight there's this to be raised up to be seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus there's actually you could say it in this way and you'll see it may be brought out by brother branham to a better degree here in a moment but beforehand there's no fight hey you're just going with the world wherever the world wants to take you you might you might act like you're fighting but there's really no fight but now that you've been raised up to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus it's a promotion to the boxing ring it's a promotion to an arena of fighting because paul says this in ephesians chapter six remember this the image i've been raised up now in ephesians chapter six verse ten finally my brother and be strong in the lord and the power of his might put on the whole armor of god oh but you forgot paul i've been raised up in the heavenly places with christ jesus i i put my armor down did i sound like joel osteen i'm not using it anymore right but no you put your whole armor on that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle we wrestle this is a place of resting this is the place of fighting this is a place of struggling we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places you've been raised up to fight spiritual weakness in high places if you could have just stayed down here you would have never had to fight but you've been raised up to a place of warfare a place of battle wherefore because you've been raised up and now you're in this arena at the right hand of power this is a place where god is conquering a place where god is going to have dominion a place where god is going to drive away every fear every doubt and every imperfection in your life then you have to ready yourself for the for the battle and now you've taken yourself the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand then we stand therefore and then he goes through the description of the believer's armor so you've been raised up but you actually been raised up to the battlefield a place of warfare brother branham in the sermon doors in door he says i like a man of vision he's talking about abraham lincoln he says i like people that's got something they are fighting for just not just lay around well ever what comes along will be all right can we think about that for just a moment just whatever comes along will be all right how many times have we translated faith to be that well just whatever happens happens i'll just take it as it comes and there's a point at which that's not faith you just don't care that's not faith you don't have enough faith to fight you're not just willing to accept any outcome you're actually in doubt that god will fight your battle so you're afraid to take a stand listen i'm not trying to be mean to you and you came all the way out here for church tonight and i want you to gut check and think about it that there's got to come a point to where you want it enough to fight for it and not just like well i guess it doesn't really matter well let's just take that to the nth degree okay let's just say well whatever matters i don't care if i'm saved or not well it doesn't really matter if my wife loves me doesn't really matter if my children serve god well whatever happens let's just go ahead and take that and run it through to the nth degree and find out that there is an attitude that's more indicative of fear or just spiritual laziness than it is faith because he says i like people that have something to fight for and just don't lay around and just take whatever comes he says all be up and at it and lincoln never did let his education stand in the way he had to do something i think every christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it this attitude that we seem to take sometimes i think it's a real a real challenge to our young people in the message because we hear about election and predestination so they get to the point where they think they understand it enough to say well if i'm elected to it it's just going to happen yep i guess i mean i can't save myself i can't get the holy ghost myself if it's just gonna happen it's gonna happen well you you can choose just how bad it's gonna be for you to come you may not have any choice in being a son of god but you can have a choice over how of things in your life and he says there's got to come a point where you're willing to fight for it that if you really believe it and you really want it say no god if you don't come you're going to find a bag of bones here not come up to the altar and say well i guess if you're going to give it to me you'll give it to me 54321 nope didn't get it and go sit down luke 13 24 strive to enter in at the straight gate for many i said you will seek to enter in and shall not be able so he says strive to enter this is a labor fervently there's no ho-hum to us contend struggle to enter fight to enter strive to enter the straight gate for many will say unto you many i say will seek to enter in and shall not be able they'll seek but do they strive we kind of maybe have a little bit of a joke in the house that if something's lost we'll say did you look for it let's say yeah you look for it and then you find it it's just right out in the open so we just kind of say yeah you looked for it right you just kind of glanced but did you you may say you sought it but did you strive labor fervently why because we have to fight the good fight of faith i like people that's got something they're fighting for in second corinthians chapter 10 verses 3 and 4 says for though we walk in the flesh i cut the slide down a little bit for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds we may walk in the flesh and as you walk in the flesh you may never go to boot camp you never may enlist in the armed services you may never actually get into a fight where you're throwing fists you may never catch hands in a grocery store but you wore even though it may not be after the flesh you will war and he says the weapons of our warfare we may walk in the flesh but we do not war after the flesh but the weapons of our warfare are not carnal this warfare that we are entered into may not be a war of words it may not be a war of hands but is a warfare and in this warfare striving with spiritual things and ideologies and and things that may not be seen we have weapons in this warfare that are powerful and mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds there's a lot that you could take from that and this fighting the good fight of faith but i just make reference to show you that the scripture is very clear we war we fight brother brahms asked the question in question and answers in 61 is this question 165 he says is it possible for a holy ghost-filled person to be driven to do minor things influence to do minor things that he doesn't want to do anybody want to take a shot at this one it's a very interesting question i like the way that it's written is it possible for a holy ghost filled person be driven to do minor things that he doesn't want to do you know the answer oh yes yes sir yeah he's just making sure he catches everybody like right you know just the adults oh yes the formal yes sir and then the young people yeah right we're all kind of caught in this oh yes yes sir yeah a holy ghost-filled person you are right in the place to be drove by those things this is not for justification this is for this is for liberation this is that we would not be in bondage he says you just put yourself up a target i i i we're we're moving very quickly towards the close tonight so if you came to get something you haven't got anything yet time to maybe enter in and just uh really go ahead and fight for this service at this very moment since you're right in the place to be drove by these things you just put yourself up a target when you're down there serving the devil he just lets you slouch around any way you want to you thought he was pushing you driving you and beating you up to do it no he was letting you do whatever you wanted to do but once you take a stand for christ you've gone on the other side then he trains every gun right around on you every temptation everything that could be thrown to you then you got it but what have you got greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world notice how beautifully he puts this now you weren't in the battle here you was just slopping along i know you thought when you're in the world man i was just really fighting i was just really struggling you know what you're fighting against your election i was really fighting i was really struggling man i was really striving and i was just no you would the devil was doing whatever he wanted to you or you were just doing whatever you wanted who what you were fighting it says not the devil but the very call of god in your life this is something that young people sometimes need to take a step back and recognize i say young people but even us as adults we're fighting with a decision we're fighting with something we know we're fighting something we don't know and we really got our fists up and we're really fighting we're really struggling and we think we're giving the devil a black eye and we're actually wrestling against the will of god and wrestling against the call of god and wrestling against the very thing we know we ought to do he says you weren't in a battle here you're just slopping along but now you've cleaned up you've dressed up you've shaved you've combed your hair you put on a uniform it's in a spiritual sense you've got a gun in your hand there's a lot of us republicans that like that he says let's go you're in battle not to show off but to fight fight sure when the temptations rise with the spirit and the shield of faith buckle off and move on that's right oh put on the whole armor of god he says why do you put on armor if you're not going to fight all soldiers are dressed to fight not to show off did i get the okay when i was putting this court and it was so long i think i was afraid i chopped it up why do you put on armor if you're not going to fight all soldiers are dressed to fight not to show off walk out and say i'm so and so sounds like that condescending cactus i'm so and so now i'm a christian see who i am i belong to so and so hallelujah i got the holy ghost the other night sure nothing bothers me anymore oh brother i believe you better go back and try again oh i'm telling you when as soon as you say you got the holy ghost satan's got every gun right on you shooting you then you got the whole arm run then you take the shield of faith the sword of the spirit of the word and shod yourself with the gospel and take the old middle piece here the breastplate and pull pull up the cinch on it and tighten yourself up a little bit and get ready for it because it's a coming don't you worry yes sir you're going to have plenty of trouble but remember greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world you're in a battle not to show up but the fight when we entered the body of christ you were called to fight called to fight not faint we know that entering in the baptism of the holy ghost is a type of the promised land and numbers chapter 33 verses 52 and 53 he says this is god now speaking to the children of israel they're going to be entered in entering into the land of milk and honey right they're going to be entering into home but they'd have to fight for it then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwelt there and for i have given you the land to possess it did god not say that he would drive them out from before them but who was god going to use to drive them out from before them them and they were going to drive out all the inhabitants destroy all their pictures destroy all their molten images quite pluck down all their high places and dispossess the inhabitants of the land they were going to have to put footsteps to the promise they weren't going to be able to just sit outside the promised land and kind of peek around and just wait for god to drive them all out but they were going to have to step forward and as they stepped forward because god said look i'm not going to drive them all out at once but as you grow and increase and you exhibit the maturity and the fortitude and the perseverance to claim every promise then i'll push them out but if you only come in so far and you don't make a step to possess every inch they're gonna they're gonna stay right there but as soon as you make an affirmative step of faith that that's my land i'm gonna possess it your act of faith god would go before you and drive them out but if you're just sitting there waiting for something to happen it's never gonna happen oh i guess just whatever happens happens no you have to fight for it it was home but they'd have to fight for it brother brown branham in question and answers in 59 says canaan is not a type of the millennium because they had wars fightings killings and everything else in canaan so you've been raised up seated in heavenly places in christ jesus but now that you've been raised up you can do battle with spiritual wickedness in high places they're not looking down on you but you can see them eye to eye through the word he says that type the holy canaan is a type of the holy ghost egypt's the world that they come out of the wilderness is where they were sanctified called out church canaan is where they settled down with the holy spirit because they still had wars anybody that says they got the holy ghost and nothing bothers them anymore he says you better go back and try again and that's scary to think that you've had some experience where nothing bothers you anymore and it's the wrong one i had something to think about they still have wars and if you don't believe and if you don't believe you have wars just get the holy spirit once what are you doing what do they do in canaan they were possessing their rights they were possessing their rights and they could not possess their rights till they got into canaan they didn't own nothing in the wilderness all the confession all it's our land it's our land it's our land all the promises every promise in the book is mine it's mine it's mine it's mine they didn't own they didn't own nothing in the wilderness then when you come into canaan they had rights then they had rights and we've got rights when you receive the holy ghost you are in canaan you have to fight for it every inch of ground you have to fight for it that's what you have to do don't stand on the sidelines don't stand on the outside of the arena just asking god to do it for you and do this and do that there's got to be something in your heart that tells you i need to step forward in faith believing knowing that greater is he that is in me don't meet the devil on his ground don't run after something and fight for something that's not worth fighting for but if you can recognize the promise of god it's worth it to face it and step forward into it i know that mature believers can accept this i hope you can catch the catch it in the right spirit if you're going to be in a war fighting over some principle make sure it's the right thing and he says if you don't believe there's wars get the holy ghost one time he says then you have to fight for it if i could even say this i know this maybe it opens up a large thought but you have to surrender to get the holy ghost right right this is again it's the paradox seek him with your whole heart then you'll find him but there's a surrender and there's a dying out there's a letting go to get it then once you get it you're raised up to fight but now greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world brother said a real christian fights for his position he has to stand alone him and god and he fights every inch of ground so you don't have to baby them around a real christian fights for his position even if it's alone i know we seem to find uh there there's a there's a part of us that takes comfort in knowing that if we're wrong there's a lot of other people who are wrong too right it's kind of the whole principle that's built mcdonald's is built around you know four billion people served and you're like well numbers don't mean anything at that point but there's there's an id there's a psychology to the crowd there's a psychology to knowing misery loves company and and i'm miserable where i am but at least there's a lot of other people who are just as miserable as i am and because you know what take someone with faith to say i'm not happy being miserable in a crowd i'd rather be happy and all alone i'd rather fight for my position stand alone with god fight for every inch of ground so you don't have to baby them around wherever i was talking i was actually talking about coming to phoenix to preach a meeting that oral roberts i wasn't able to come and preach him saying he was going to be taking the campaign on his own brother man says i realize that every time faith sets itself up the devil turns every gun in hell right on it like that not going to be easy when you step forward to do something that god wants you to do it's not going to be easy to apply the token to your home it's not going to be easy to take the path that you feel that god is wanting you to take but it's something we're fighting for i'll try to run through this quickly just touch on a few scriptures here he said i'll drive them out destroy their pictures destroy their molten images quite pluck down all their high places dispossess the inhabitants of the land but the man said i had to fight for every inch of ground a christian fights for his position as soon as faith sets itself up the devil turns every gun and hell on it right like that so when you come into the promised land it's a place of fighting in war so the book of judges has to come a time when it the children of israel had to be reminded in judges chapter 3 verse 2 only that the generations of the children of israel might know to teach them war at the least such as before knew nothing thereof they had stopped fighting they didn't know what war was like they didn't know what it was like to fight but they still had to know teach them the war to be trained in battle to learn to engage in battle not to run from but to know what it looks like to know what it feels like wage war know how to use a weapon face the fight don't run away the bible says in exodus that the lord is a man of war this is this is part of his essential characteristics god is love so god equals love and god is a man of war right they say all's fair in love and war love is war and some of us said amen but lord is a man of war he prepares his people for war he he teaches them how to dress themselves for a fight he he teaches them how to handle a weapon brother branham is drilling down on it what would he give you armor for if he didn't want you to fight what would he give you a sword for so you can make fried green tomato sandwiches with it it's one of the worst things to try to cut with a bad knife as a tomato but he gives you a sword to fight psalms 144 verses 1 and 2 blessed be the lord my strength which teacheth my hands to war in my fingers to fight my goodness and my fortress my high tower my deliver my shield and he and whom i trust who subdueth my people under me and though he's the subduer though greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they're still hands that need to be taught to fight and fingers how to fight you've got to know how to fight in this he's your goodness your fortress you're italian you're delivered he's your shield he's the one in whom you're resting and trusting but he's the same one that gives you strength and teaches your hands the war and your fingers to fight amen i know some of you are thinking that that's this well i'll show them all right two thumbed warriors or maybe you just swipe whatever it is that's not what he's talking about brother graham said the message greatest battle ever fought an army first is getting ready for a battle first it's got to select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting there's a large thought there and he says and i believe that the greatest battle that ever was fought is now ready to go in action i believe that god has been selecting his soldiers i believe he's been dressing them training them and the battlefront is now set getting ready to start the greatest battle ever fought in psalms 18 34 he teacheth my hands to war so that a boat still is broken by my arms he can teach you how to fight so that even a boa still is broken in your arms he's dressing us for fighting and training us for fighting the lord my strength who teaches my hands to war and teaches my fingers to fight he will teach my hands to war so that i can break a bow of steel brother ma'am continuing in the greatest battle ever fought god's training for this great battle matthew 24 and also daniel 12 and there'd be a time of troubles that's never like on the earth before and we are living in that time when culture and education and things have smothered over the word of god and got into reasoning and so forth the battle is now who will stand hallelujah the battle is ready to go in she's in array now the battle is down he says who will stand he expresses it in other ways who will draw their swords with me who will who will stand shoulder to shoulder just maybe bear with me a little bit i'm not necessarily getting into part two but why is it so easy to fight against each other and we don't ever want to fight the devil i know we're talking about the neighbors in the apartment next door but think about it why is it so easy to go at one another and go toe to toe with another professed believer but we never want to fight for the devil we never we never want to fight against unbelief we don't ever fight against sin we find it so easy to go at one another but not stand shoulder to shoulder as we ought to and fight for things that are worth fighting for so we expressed on sunday morning putting our shoulder to the will to cry out against darkness so the battle is now who will stand i think i put those three things but john if you want to put them up i'll read the quote but just this is the gut check now let us all tonight check our desires then you can see what kind of filthy you've been drawing through let's check each one of us here and out across the nation check your desires what you really want in life check what you're fighting for check what you're here for check what you go to church for oh there's times in life when you're like nope right you just you don't want to fight you don't have anything to do with it you just you back out of it nope this is not the time this is not the place you know you're you're just kind of going to the grocery store and some someone you catch eyes with somebody that you look at me oh no no i'm blind actually where are you who was talking right you don't want none of it you're not you don't want to fight listen it's not going to work christian it's not going to work believer he says what are you here for you you have to realize that whether you wanted one or not you're in a fight and you got to ask yourself what am i fighting for am i fighting for the right thing what am i here for am i where am i what am i doing and then even as he says what are you going to church for are you just going to church he says it's fine to go to church but that's not what saves you it's gut check time it's a time for us to to to think about the principle we're checking my desires what i want in life and if i'm if i'm fighting is it going to get me what really matters and what really counts i shared just quickly with sister elizabeth on what i was preaching tonight and she said well it's just like our family vision and we have a kind of a family motto a family uh uh saying that it's rapture or bust that that's what we want we we want a rapture for our family that's why we've made decisions that we've made in life it's why we've traveled the road that we've traveled is we realize that if you want to make it to a grave any road will get you there if you just want to find yourself holding on in the end and and living for a funeral then just about any way will get you there but if what you really want for yourself and for your family is a rapture then you're gonna have to make harder decisions you're gonna have to start fighting you've got to pick up the sword and i realize that if you want a body change you're going to have to fight for it you can't just lay around and just pretend it's going to happen you have to make hard decisions and fight for it and that's what i'm challenging you to do tonight fight for it fight for it if you're fighting what are you fighting for he said i'm just fighting i'm just going through it i'm just battling what are you fighting for who are you fighting against what's it all about fight for it is it worth is it something we're fighting for you did that for that you called them that because of that and you fought them for that and you did you did this at the end of it yeah just for that when they're like that's petty oh yeah i think in a way that's kind of what brother brahms is hitting at check your desires what do you really want in life brother brandman two places talk about going to war he talks about his brothers that were in war and he said if there's another war he'd do it himself he'd go to war himself he said this is the greatest nation there is under the heavens i'm glad to be an american that's right and if it's worth anything it's worth fighting for it's worth standing by you're asking yourself what am i fighting for he says in another place if this country ain't worth fighting for it ain't worth living in think about that if it's not worth fighting for it's not worth living in is what you're living in worth fighting for ask yourself if the condition you're living in if the place you're living in if the standard you're living at if what you have isn't worth living in is it worth fighting in because he says anything worth fighting if it ain't worth fighting for it ain't worth living in he said well i may be in a particular condition but would you be willing to fight to stay in it and if you're not willing to fight to stay in it it's not worth it to stay there so i'm challenging you as a believer tonight if you're in a place that's not worth fighting for fight to get out of it strive to find the place that you ought to be desire to find another level with god and say lord i don't want to just lay around anymore i just don't want to take it easy if lifting me up into heavenly places means i've got to fight the devil but at least there i'll know greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and that's a place worth fighting for fight for saints god bless you let's stand together
