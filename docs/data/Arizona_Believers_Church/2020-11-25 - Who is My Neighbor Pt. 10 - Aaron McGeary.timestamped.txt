[0:00] Luke 10:
[0:04] 33-37 it says but a certain Samaritan as
[0:07] he journeyed came where he was and when
[0:11] he saw him he had compassion on him and
[0:14] went to him and bound up his wounds
[0:17] pouring in oil and wine and set him on
[0:19] his own beast and brought him to an inn
[0:22] and took care of him and on the tomorrow
[0:24] when he departed he took out two pence
[0:27] and gave them to the host and said unto
[0:29] him take care of him and whatsoever thou
[0:31] spendest more when I come again I will
[0:34] repay thee which now of these three
[0:37] thinkest thou was neighbor unto him that
[0:40] fell among the thieves and he said he
[0:43] that showed Mercy on him then said Jesus
[0:45] unto him go and do thou likewise amen
[0:49] you may be seated
[1:02] we've been speaking on this subject for
[1:03] several Services now and I'd like to
[1:06] continue uh on it and trying to just
[1:08] pick up where we left off last Wednesday
[1:10] we weren't able to finish um the thought
[1:12] that was on our heart taking it from
[1:14] verse 33 and so we want to just continue
[1:18] uh and just pick right back up where we
[1:20] were and Jesus asked the question or the
[1:23] question is asked of Jesus in the
[1:25] beginning of this story who is my
[1:27] neighbor and that's the title that we've
[1:28] given this is who is my neighbor and
[1:30] we're asking ourselves This Is Us
[1:32] challenging ourselves by this Parable
[1:35] taking the word of God and examining Our
[1:36] Hearts by it the question is asked who
[1:39] is my neighbor but then Jesus when he
[1:41] takes it and he's he asks the question
[1:43] which one of these three was neighbor
[1:45] unto him uh who fell among Thieves he's
[1:48] asking the question who fulfilled the
[1:50] duty that one owes to a neighbor so it
[1:53] goes beyond who is my neighbor but also
[1:56] what is neighborly which one was
[1:58] neighbor to or acted toward towards this
[2:00] one who F fell among Thieves and we've
[2:03] been looking how that Jesus is really
[2:05] stripping away pretense and he's
[2:08] addressing hypocrisy by challenging the
[2:11] lawyer with the example of the Samaritan
[2:13] as the lawyer would have identified with
[2:15] the priest he would have identified with
[2:16] the levite him being a Jew would have
[2:18] not considered a Samaritan to be his
[2:20] neighbor but rather he's using the
[2:23] Samaritan then as kind of an abrasive
[2:25] example going to get right in the face
[2:27] of this this lawyer and these Jews and
[2:29] challenging him uh to strip away any
[2:32] kind of pretense uh to consider whether
[2:34] there be any kind of hypocrisy in his
[2:36] heart so in verse 33 we were just taking
[2:39] this word by word or phrase by phrase to
[2:41] identify how Jesus was framing this
[2:44] issue to get the lawyer's attention and
[2:47] ultimately to give us instruction we're
[2:49] not just a fly on thewall to the
[2:51] conversation between Jesus and this
[2:52] lawyer but rather there's something
[2:54] that's to be gained for us or something
[2:56] that's instructive to us ultimately this
[2:59] is what God wanted it to do he wanted it
[3:01] to impact us and make a difference to us
[3:03] as Believers so it says in Luke 10:33
[3:07] but a certain Samaritan and so he uses
[3:10] this Example The Samaritan who would
[3:12] have been an antagonist to the Jews who
[3:15] had a lot of similarities to the Jews
[3:17] but a lot of differences to the Jews and
[3:19] there was a rivalry between them because
[3:21] the Samaritans being a mixed group of
[3:23] people of the of in the in of Assyrians
[3:26] and Babylonians and then they begin to
[3:28] mix uh through several Centuries with
[3:30] with Jews they were very unique people
[3:33] that believed in the law of Moses and
[3:35] worshiped and kept C certain days and
[3:37] they beli that they were keeping it in
[3:39] more of a pure way than the Jews were so
[3:41] for Jesus to use a Samaritan uh kind of
[3:44] would get the the ranker up and get the
[3:46] Jew say oh why would you use our rival
[3:48] why would you use them as an example and
[3:51] we used John chapter 4 of the discourse
[3:53] between the the woman at the well in
[3:55] Jesus Christ just to highlight how this
[3:58] the the interactions between the two
[4:00] would have been rare and and they
[4:01] weren't cordial to one another so Jesus
[4:04] is using the Samaritan to overcome
[4:06] really any objection on the lawyer's
[4:08] part and therefore any objection on our
[4:10] part any objection with respect to
[4:12] religion or national pride or Prejudice
[4:15] or experience where I had a bad
[4:17] experience with a Samaritan or I had a
[4:18] bad experience with the Jew and whatever
[4:21] it might be Jesus uses the Samaritan to
[4:23] drive home this point and we asked the
[4:26] question last time uh using this example
[4:28] of the Samaritan and the Jews where they
[4:31] hated each other and didn't like each
[4:32] other and a lot of it was because of
[4:34] what they had in common but ultimately
[4:36] it was because of what their differences
[4:37] were and I asked the question who are
[4:39] our Samaritans or the people we don't
[4:41] like because of our differences and it's
[4:43] kind of aggravated a little bit more
[4:45] because of our similarities but then we
[4:47] also pointed out and what was really the
[4:49] main emphasis is are we not the
[4:51] Samaritans should we not be those who
[4:54] identify with the Samaritan or at least
[4:56] say that Christ is challenging us as the
[4:59] Believers to be like the Samaritan don't
[5:02] be like the priest don't be like the
[5:03] levite certainly don't be like the
[5:04] lawyer but be like the Samaritan who
[5:07] looked past national identity looked
[5:09] past religious identity looked past
[5:11] Prejudice and and personal experience
[5:13] and he did that which was right and
[5:15] actually followed something that was in
[5:17] his heart which was aligned with the
[5:18] nature of Christ and so Jesus develops
[5:21] the Samaritan's character to teach us
[5:24] how to love our neighbors he uses the
[5:26] Samaritan as the example of how you can
[5:29] love your neighbor as yourself not just
[5:32] answer the question of who that is but
[5:34] also how that we can be neighborly to
[5:36] them so he says but a certain Samaritan
[5:38] in verse 33 as he journeyed and so the
[5:41] word choice that Jesus uses uh amplifies
[5:45] the uh the conduct now of the Samaritan
[5:48] it's it's dealing with it a little bit
[5:49] more poignantly it's it's putting it in
[5:52] a in a way that we can consider the
[5:54] actions from a different standpoint and
[5:57] so he's not just pointing out that the
[5:59] Samaritan was walking down the road he
[6:01] uses a phrase of the priest and the
[6:03] levite to suggest they just kind of were
[6:05] walking they were just traveling but
[6:07] Jesus says the Samaritan journeyed and
[6:10] this means it refers to his course of
[6:12] conduct so it was more than just a way
[6:14] that he went that day but rather it
[6:16] spoke of a way of thinking a way of
[6:18] feeling and a way of deciding that this
[6:20] is something he done had done purposely
[6:23] in his heart it wasn't just the path he
[6:24] was taking but it was the way that he
[6:26] was living that resulted in the conduct
[6:28] that he expresses here here so it's not
[6:30] just oh we happen to be going this way
[6:32] but we have to be living an appropriate
[6:34] way in order to do the right things in
[6:36] the way that we're going so when he says
[6:38] the Samaritan journeyed it's something
[6:41] that was a a manner of Life a course of
[6:42] conduct and so his actions reflected his
[6:45] Instinct his actions reflected his
[6:48] nature it wasn't that he had H uh was
[6:51] forcing himself to do something or had
[6:53] just read a book and was trying to do
[6:55] what the book said but rather this was a
[6:57] way of life that was something that was
[6:58] instinct to him
[7:00] and we should desire that the word
[7:02] become our first
[7:03] nature the nature by our first uh first
[7:06] birth is a contrary and against the mind
[7:08] of Christ but having been born again we
[7:11] have the Life of Christ on the inside of
[7:13] us that gives us another nature that we
[7:16] could yield ourselves to and in allowing
[7:18] the word to have preeminence what our
[7:20] desire is that nature become first
[7:22] nature that if we have an instinct
[7:24] that's carnal we have an instinct that's
[7:25] more accustomed with our last name or
[7:27] the nature we get from our parents or
[7:28] whatever it might be be we want the word
[7:30] to become our first nature and we do not
[7:33] want to just be following
[7:36] rules as a discipline like the levite
[7:39] and the priest were because when it
[7:40] would have mattered the most they didn't
[7:43] do it when the religion would have
[7:45] really meant something to somebody else
[7:47] they couldn't do it and so their
[7:48] religion was a lot of pretense their
[7:50] religion was a lot of put on it was a
[7:51] lot of show and they always acted a
[7:53] certain way and did a certain thing and
[7:55] prayed a certain way and were happy to
[7:56] perform service in the temple because
[7:58] everybody ooh look at the priest and the
[8:01] Levites assisting ooh look at the
[8:03] Levites and that when it when the lights
[8:05] were on the cameras were rolling that
[8:06] was when they wanted to act but that
[8:09] that discipline or that adherence to
[8:10] certain rules didn't really pay off for
[8:12] the Jew when he was laying in a ditch
[8:14] when it really would have counted and so
[8:17] we don't want to just be Christians when
[8:18] the lights are on lights camera action
[8:20] play the part and we really want to be a
[8:22] Christian when it really matters and we
[8:25] want to be the kind of Christians that
[8:27] make a difference in other people's
[8:28] lives CU think about it by the very fact
[8:30] that you are a Christian if you really
[8:32] genuinely are a Christian that means you
[8:34] are born again which means the Seal of
[8:36] God has come upon your soul and you are
[8:38] now a member of the body of Christ The
[8:41] Life of Christ is on the inside of you
[8:43] so that's what makes you a Christian is
[8:45] what he's done for you so in one sense
[8:47] there's really not more that he should
[8:49] do for you right you're a Christian your
[8:52] sins are forgiven you're Justified
[8:53] you're sealed into the body of Christ
[8:55] now a lot of my life I is as a Christian
[8:59] is what I can do for
[9:01] others as we identified early on in this
[9:03] that that is what eternal life is
[9:05] eternal life is living for others so we
[9:07] don't want to just be following rules no
[9:09] matter how well they're laid out or how
[9:10] well they're enforced but we want to
[9:12] live the life so it says but a certain
[9:15] Samaritan as he journeyed came where he
[9:18] was and this is where we we left off
[9:20] last time came where he was he didn't
[9:23] just it wasn't just knowledgeable that
[9:26] this man was in in a in a difficult
[9:27] situation he was not just in proximity
[9:31] to where the damage was done but he
[9:32] became present in the man's need when it
[9:35] says he came where he was it was more
[9:38] than just uh recognizing that someone
[9:40] needed help it was more than just being
[9:43] a prox a proximity in geographical
[9:45] location or nearness in terms of space
[9:47] but he's now becoming present because
[9:49] he's going to become more aware of what
[9:51] the need is and more aware of how he can
[9:53] help him and so it was more than just to
[9:56] bless his heart you look at him and say
[9:58] oh man he is really in bad shape and he
[10:02] kind of says bless his heart and he
[10:03] sends out a tweet and says hey came
[10:05] across a guy in rough shape pray for
[10:08] him right it was more than that but as
[10:11] he came to where he was it's now working
[10:14] to a place to where he becomes present
[10:16] in this man's need he becomes more
[10:18] conscious of what has happened and it's
[10:21] more of I'll bless your heart it's more
[10:22] how can I
[10:24] help and so it says came where he was in
[10:28] the image that's painted by by these
[10:29] words is he came down to where he was he
[10:32] didn't just stand off from a distance
[10:34] looking down on him a a and assessing
[10:37] his situation and saying from up here I
[10:39] can tell that you're in bad shape and
[10:41] from up here I can tell that you're
[10:43] you're naked and from up here I can tell
[10:44] that you're half dead uh but rather he
[10:46] comes down to him and so we must
[10:49] recognize that this is an act of
[10:51] humility it's becoming more real to me
[10:53] that humility acts humility is not just
[10:56] something kind of an aura that we give
[10:57] off though some people give off anti-h
[11:00] humility but humility should be
[11:02] something that acts and humility is a
[11:04] funny thing as soon as you think you've
[11:06] got it you've lost it right so in that
[11:10] way humility is Elusive and so we should
[11:13] always be striving to be more humble and
[11:15] we should be striving uh to become more
[11:17] simple and and try to become more
[11:21] Christlike so this was an act of
[11:23] humility and this is how it I was seeing
[11:27] it last week and it's just got more more
[11:29] real to me or what I wanted to express
[11:30] to you last week has become even more uh
[11:33] real to me as I pondered it over the
[11:34] past week is he had no fear of becoming
[11:38] the
[11:40] servant becoming the servant was no
[11:42] threat to his
[11:43] position uh becoming the servant in this
[11:46] situation and coming down to where this
[11:48] man was there was no threat to his
[11:50] pride so whatever calculations he went
[11:53] through he arrives at a different
[11:55] conclusion than the priest and the
[11:57] levite whose Pride kept them from
[11:59] rendering Aid whose position kept them
[12:01] from rendering Aid and oh I got to be
[12:02] careful about this I got to be careful
[12:04] about that what would people think but
[12:05] he becoming the servant was no threat to
[12:08] who he was in other words he knew who he
[12:10] was wouldn't change by going down and
[12:13] helping this person he wasn't worried
[12:15] about what everyone else would say if he
[12:17] if he bent down and kneel down to render
[12:19] Aid to this man so he was willing to
[12:21] condescend come go down to where this
[12:24] person was as an act of
[12:26] humility and Jesus says in Matthew chap
[12:28] 23 verse 11 but he that is greatest
[12:31] among you shall be your
[12:34] servant he that is greatest among you so
[12:37] he that is the greatest and this is
[12:39] number one this is the best th this is
[12:42] the one that everybody looks to this is
[12:44] the one that has a aund ranking in
[12:46] Madden this is the one that everyone
[12:47] aspires to be this is the goat it says
[12:50] but rather the greatest among you shall
[12:52] be your servant he just kind of turns it
[12:55] all the way
[12:56] around and when we really consider this
[12:59] and if we're really catching the truth
[13:00] of it it makes us
[13:02] uncomfortable that the really the really
[13:05] great ones are the ones that are
[13:06] servants and then we think oh in order
[13:09] for me really to be great in order for
[13:11] me to really be taking my place in the
[13:12] kingdom of God I've got to be a servant
[13:14] it begins to make us uncomfortable
[13:16] because we do not we do not want to be
[13:18] perceived as
[13:20] vulnerable we do not want to feel weak
[13:24] because we do not want to feel weak and
[13:26] we do not want to feel vulnerable or we
[13:27] do not want to be perceived as either
[13:29] either it makes us uncomfortable to put
[13:31] ourselves in the position of a servant
[13:33] because we think oh a servant that's
[13:34] somebody in a in a different place
[13:36] that's somebody in a different character
[13:37] that's someone of a lower station that
[13:39] the great ones are the ones that are
[13:40] served it's the it's the poor ones are
[13:42] the ones that are serving listen it's
[13:44] not so in the kingdom of God the great
[13:46] ones do the serving and if as Christians
[13:48] we have the spirit of Christ inside of
[13:50] us then the then we must also become the
[13:54] servants and I I think this really hits
[13:56] a a weakness in Christianity where pride
[14:00] and arrogance has got taken a hold of it
[14:03] and made it into something that it's
[14:04] really not and and painted a picture of
[14:07] it that's really not I I was hearing a
[14:10] minister here recently and one that was
[14:12] uh uh it was one that's kind of these uh
[14:16] it I'm trying to be very careful how I
[14:18] say this it wasn't a message Pastor or
[14:20] message Minister it was one of these
[14:22] high priests that are out there one of
[14:23] these Bible Church guys who who who you
[14:26] know have want to present themselves as
[14:28] very fashionable and and very woke this
[14:30] would be a woke pastor and uh he was
[14:33] trying to say that Jesus Jesus is
[14:36] somebody that everybody loves and Jesus
[14:38] is somebody Beautiful Jesus is somebody
[14:41] everyone gravitates to and you think
[14:42] well when I read my Bible it really
[14:44] wasn't that way there was no Beauty in
[14:46] him that we would desire him and in
[14:49] giving this uh this preacher the benefit
[14:50] of the doubt I could see that in
[14:53] reality uh the way that Christ lives and
[14:55] the way that he the way that he can draw
[14:57] upon a person's heart the truth of
[14:59] Christ is really what you want to be
[15:01] someone to be attracted to not what we
[15:03] make him out to be but we've in the same
[15:06] sense that we've made Christ into
[15:07] something is not Christians in doing so
[15:09] have become something very un
[15:11] Christlike something that's more
[15:13] Hollywood than it is
[15:15] Christ and so as this Samaritan as he
[15:17] journeyed came where he was this is an
[15:20] act of humility he was becoming the
[15:22] servant and Jesus says him that is the
[15:24] greatest among you let him be your
[15:26] servant and the reason of this as we
[15:29] know ultimately the act of this
[15:31] Samaritan was to serve and to minister
[15:34] to this person in need I want you to
[15:35] think of it this way power without
[15:39] humility at best is perceived a as as
[15:44] predatory at best is perceived as
[15:47] manipulative and controlling and abusive
[15:50] that's what it is at best at worst it
[15:55] is I want you to ponder that for a
[15:57] moment power without humility at worst
[15:59] is perceived as being predatory at worst
[16:01] it is when there's no humility joined
[16:04] with power power becomes uh manipulative
[16:07] it becomes controlling it becomes
[16:08] abusive so without humility all the
[16:10] power we have in Christ can be used in a
[16:13] way that is manipulative controlling
[16:14] abusive predatory this is how people in
[16:17] powerful positions get away with a lot
[16:19] of things and a lot of hurts and abuses
[16:22] a a and and criminal activity is because
[16:24] they don't have the humility joined with
[16:26] it and they manipulate and abuse and
[16:29] take advantage by reason of their power
[16:31] and we should never exercise the Liberty
[16:33] we have in Christ or the power we have
[16:35] in Christ through through Authority
[16:38] through position and through
[16:41] Advantage it says of Jesus in
[16:43] Philippians
[16:44] 2:7 speaking of Christ but made himself
[16:47] of no
[16:50] reputation took upon him the form of a
[16:52] servant and was made in the likeness of
[16:56] men here's Jesus Christ this is the mind
[16:59] that we're to have in us he made himself
[17:02] of no
[17:03] reputation and in making himself of no
[17:06] reputation it says he took upon him the
[17:07] form of a servant and was made in the
[17:10] likeness of men the form that he takes
[17:12] on the light that he grows into he's the
[17:14] son of a carpenter and he is a carpenter
[17:17] he hasn't preceded some forth from some
[17:20] royalty or some lineage where everyone
[17:22] kind kind said wow look at this guy he
[17:24] has the right kind of last name and look
[17:25] at this guy he has the right kind of
[17:27] position he wasn't born within the pal
[17:29] to be associated with the King he wasn't
[17:30] born uh to the priesthood to be
[17:32] associated with the Levites he's born to
[17:34] a carpenter and as he grows he becomes a
[17:37] carpenter and so he takes upon himself
[17:40] the form of a servant a common man it
[17:42] says and he made of himself no
[17:45] reputation and and the phrase that's
[17:47] used there is he emptied himself and so
[17:50] what it speaks to is he laid aside his
[17:53] glory or he rather he did not appear in
[17:56] his
[17:57] glory and I want this to strike you the
[17:59] right
[18:00] way Jesus could have
[18:03] come in a way that declared his majesty
[18:06] and His glory could have come in a form
[18:07] where everyone's like wow this is him
[18:10] this is the one we all waited for and
[18:13] and it's as if if one coming where they
[18:15] dress a certain way and and if a
[18:16] captain's going to be among you and and
[18:19] there's a certain way that you see this
[18:20] is a captain I'm going to straighten
[18:22] myself up and I behave myself around
[18:24] this one who has authority Jesus laid
[18:26] aside his
[18:27] rank Jesus did not appear in his glory
[18:30] if I could put it this way he didn't Big
[18:32] Time
[18:34] us he he didn't he didn't show up saying
[18:37] uh do you know who I am do you know who
[18:39] I am uh you do you have any idea you
[18:42] should be doing this you should be doing
[18:43] that he came he laid aside his
[18:45] reputation he didn't Big Time us he
[18:47] didn't come in some kind of hot shot he
[18:49] wasn't bragging he wasn't showing off he
[18:51] wasn't uh trying to make people uh fear
[18:53] him because of his status but rather he
[18:55] laid aside his glory he laid aside his
[18:58] rank he became came in the form of a man
[19:02] now this is instructive to us I believe
[19:04] this is what the Samaritan did it was
[19:05] was an act of humility he doesn't try to
[19:07] make a name for himself he he bends down
[19:10] to render Aid not when the cameras are
[19:12] rolling not when everyone would see it
[19:14] not trying to create a viral moment but
[19:15] he's doing something when no one else
[19:17] would see it and he's doing it because
[19:18] he knows it'll make the difference in
[19:20] one person's
[19:21] life and Jesus made of himself of no
[19:25] reputation he says in brother Bram says
[19:27] in the message hear ye him he said I've
[19:29] had the privilege of meeting great men
[19:31] in my days been in King's
[19:34] palaces but when you really find a man
[19:37] that is a great man he makes you think
[19:41] that you are the great
[19:42] man if if there's some way that this
[19:45] could become a revelation to us and in
[19:48] doing so kind of knock out whatever that
[19:51] Gene is in our in our thinking that
[19:53] makes us so afraid to compliment
[19:56] somebody it makes us so afraid to say
[19:58] something good about
[20:00] somebody and and think about the reasons
[20:02] why we don't think why we withhold
[20:05] compliments and we withhold praise and
[20:07] why we can't rejoice when somebody else
[20:08] is blessed but when it says here brother
[20:11] says a great man when you find someone
[20:12] who really is great they'll make you
[20:14] think you're the great
[20:16] man even though they may be the greatest
[20:19] at it they're going to tell you you're
[20:20] doing awesome that's amazing I wish I
[20:22] could do that I wish I could be more
[20:24] like you and they don't have to feel
[20:25] like well that was good but guess look
[20:27] what I can do oh you're you're coming
[20:29] along real well but watch how I can do
[20:31] it but rather a real truly great man who
[20:34] knows he is great doesn't feel like he's
[20:37] got to prove himself to anyone so is
[20:39] loose then and has the Liberty to say
[20:41] hey that's awesome you're doing great
[20:43] and then make you think you're the great
[20:46] one he says but it's the man that just
[20:48] thinks he's a great man that wants to
[20:50] put on a whole lot put on airs big time
[20:54] you a name drop or or whatever it is to
[20:57] try to make you uh be an all of them he
[20:59] says he do have to put on a whole lot so
[21:01] there's no pretense to he doesn't need
[21:03] to have a lot of pretense he's not
[21:05] trying to wow you and blow you away with
[21:07] what he knows and how good he is brother
[21:10] R says the same thing he says it in a
[21:11] number of different places I'm just
[21:12] taking it from two places but in the
[21:14] same title hear ye him he said that's
[21:17] what makes him God to me is because that
[21:19] he is
[21:20] humility so what makes him great is the
[21:23] his ability to Humble himself what makes
[21:24] God great is the fact that he can
[21:26] condescend that this is what brother
[21:28] abam makes him God to me is because he
[21:30] is humility he's able to Humble himself
[21:33] that means he really is
[21:34] great listen if you if you really are
[21:39] nothing and lot of times people are just
[21:41] they're just poor and they're just
[21:42] pitiful and they mistake it for humility
[21:44] no you're just poor and pitiful it's not
[21:46] humility but he's saying if you really
[21:47] are great then you can truly exhibit
[21:50] humility so he said that's what makes
[21:52] him God to me is his humility I've had
[21:54] the privilege of doing much traveling
[21:55] and meeting great men when I meet man
[21:57] that tries to be great that's you can
[22:00] always class that man you can always
[22:01] recognize um his ilk or what he's like
[22:05] there isn't very much to him as he said
[22:07] there's one he's just one who's trying
[22:08] to put on a whole lot great man that
[22:11] that's they a great man or those or
[22:13] great man that's they try to make you
[22:16] think you're the great one if someone
[22:19] truly is a great one a great person then
[22:22] they're going to try to make you feel
[22:24] great he says but it's a man that wants
[22:27] to be great if you'll just Chase it down
[22:29] to the bottom you'll find out it's a
[22:30] stuffed
[22:31] shirt not much to
[22:33] them this is this this amplifies Jesus
[22:37] saying he that is greatest among you
[22:39] shall be your servant is going to be
[22:42] inspired to see that you can be
[22:44] benefited going to desire to see that
[22:46] you can be lifted up that you can be
[22:48] encouraged and not that you'd Pat
[22:49] somebody on the back when they're
[22:50] sinning and not that you would make
[22:52] somebody feel comfortable for doing
[22:53] things that are wrong but it's it's a
[22:55] way of living and acting to where it's
[22:57] not all about
[22:59] you not about how good you look and how
[23:02] what everybody thinks about you and
[23:03] whether or not you're proceed to be a
[23:05] Christian forget all about that just
[23:06] live the life and do the things that are
[23:08] right they're going to figure it out
[23:09] eventually but your desire is not to get
[23:12] a a gold star on your name on a chart
[23:14] but rather make somebody else feel that
[23:17] there's an opportunity for them to be
[23:19] redeemed and to be benefited by the very
[23:21] thing that's benefited
[23:23] you great man is those that try to make
[23:26] you feel think that you're great
[23:29] and I don't believe I believe if you
[23:31] really catch the heart of that it's not
[23:33] just someone trying to blow smoke or
[23:34] someone trying to uh puff you up through
[23:37] vanity but it's someone who actually
[23:38] cares for you and the scripture says he
[23:41] came where he was he came down to where
[23:43] he was he's saying I'm with you I'm here
[23:45] for you I'm concerned about
[23:48] you in Luke Chapter 14:1 it says for
[23:51] whosoever exalteth himself shall be
[23:54] abased the Way Up Is
[23:56] Down whosoever exalt himself shall be
[23:59] abased he that humble himself shall be
[24:02] exalted self exaltation what is it
[24:04] always got something to prove it's that
[24:07] complex or that syndrome where you've
[24:09] always got to you got always got to make
[24:10] yourself stand out you got to make
[24:12] yourself kind of rise to the top you
[24:13] want everybody else to know what you're
[24:15] thinking and how you're feeling and
[24:17] there's certain ones that you got to be
[24:18] very very careful around because if you
[24:20] let tell them something they don't know
[24:22] then you're automatically wrong right
[24:26] and there's sometimes in situations that
[24:28] maybe more professionally than as a
[24:30] Christian where you realize listen this
[24:32] is the way the boss is you got to you
[24:34] got to present this in a way to where
[24:36] ultimately when you when you arrive at
[24:38] the decision he thinks it's
[24:41] his otherwise they're not going to want
[24:43] to do it so you got to approach somebody
[24:45] like that in a way to where the right
[24:47] thing is to do ABC the right thing is to
[24:49] do 1 plus 1 equals 2 but you can't just
[24:52] tell this person that's the right thing
[24:53] because if you present it to them and
[24:55] it's not their idea they don't want to
[24:56] have any any ownership of it what is it
[24:58] that's he that likes to be exalted
[25:00] always has something to do always has
[25:02] always has to prove himself B saying
[25:04] that man wants to put on a whole lot a
[25:08] man that wants to be great and if if you
[25:10] really think about it as brother BR says
[25:12] you if you run that chase that thing
[25:13] down you'll find it's a stuffed shirt it
[25:15] comes from a place of
[25:16] emptiness comes from a place of complex
[25:19] and
[25:20] insecurity where they're really not sure
[25:23] who they are in Christ and so they have
[25:25] there's a lot of putting on a lot of
[25:27] pretense that comes with it brother Bram
[25:30] said the spirit of God always the spirit
[25:32] of God always is ready for correction
[25:36] sweet humble willing talk about the
[25:40] spirit of God in you is always ready for
[25:43] correction sweet humble willing that's
[25:47] what the spirit of God is you say the
[25:49] spirit of God is always willing for
[25:50] correction listen if we get in our minds
[25:53] that we're right absolutely right and we
[25:54] can't be wrong and there's no way we can
[25:56] be wrong and and you get the and and you
[25:58] take some of the things that we believe
[25:59] in the word of God that we're
[26:01] Justified and that we cannot be
[26:04] deceived and we thought talk about our
[26:06] security if we take that and we sew a
[26:08] little bit of Leaven into it then it
[26:10] comes to a place where we can never be
[26:12] corrected we can always justify
[26:14] everything that we do we can always just
[26:15] uh come up with a way to say well I'm
[26:17] right I'm right I'm right I'm right I
[26:18] can't be wrong I can't be wrong I can't
[26:19] be wrong but the spirit of God is always
[26:21] ready for correction sweet humble
[26:24] willing and then just going to skip a
[26:26] little bit of the phrase and he says
[26:28] just remember arrogant Spirits are not
[26:31] of
[26:32] God whosoever exalteth himself shall be
[26:35] a based this is a lesson that we take
[26:37] from the Samaritan when Jesus says he
[26:39] came where he was this was an act of
[26:41] humility he's coming down to be present
[26:43] in the person's need he's letting them
[26:45] know I'm not afraid to be to to roll my
[26:47] sleeves up and try to help you I'm not
[26:48] afraid to do what I can to to minister
[26:51] to your need I'm not afraid of your
[26:52] situation your situation is going to
[26:54] take away my Christianity your situation
[26:56] is going to cause me to re think whether
[26:58] or not I really got the goods or whether
[27:00] or not I have faith but yet they're
[27:01] motivated they're willing to Humble
[27:03] themselves they're not afraid of their
[27:04] position they're not afraid of what
[27:05] other people may think about them
[27:06] they're willing to Humble themselves and
[27:09] in humbling themselves help
[27:12] somebody brother Bram says in the
[27:14] message washing jesus' feet he's talking
[27:17] about the Pharisee who put on the put on
[27:20] the party and invited everyone and Let
[27:23] Jesus just sit there with dirty feet he
[27:25] says we're watching this Pharisee
[27:28] and I can see him as he walks back and
[27:30] forth in the great corridors of his home
[27:32] I'm Dr so and so in this city you know
[27:34] I'm a well-respected citizen what I say
[27:37] is the Law and Order I'm a great man and
[27:39] when you get to thinking that in your
[27:41] heart then you're nothing that you ought
[27:42] to be says the Bible as it says in
[27:45] Galatians if a man think he's something
[27:47] when he's not when he ought not to he
[27:50] says when a man thinks he's just a
[27:52] little bit better than somebody else
[27:54] you're on your road out
[27:57] brother I I this is this isn't qualified
[28:00] when a man thinks he's just a little bit
[28:02] better than somebody else you're on your
[28:03] road out brother so we should never
[28:05] think that we're better than somebody
[28:07] else that's right we're all the same in
[28:10] the sight of God Rich poor brown black
[28:12] white yellow whatever we may be we're
[28:14] all on one equal basis with
[28:18] God so there ought not to be any
[28:21] self-righteousness there's no arrogance
[28:23] there's no pretense there's no put on
[28:25] and if we can get rid of that then
[28:26] there's no hypocrisy then we act
[28:28] authentically and it's a genuine
[28:30] response to things and we're really
[28:32] concerned about other people's needs
[28:33] because we're ask ourselves who is my
[28:35] neighbor in other or how can I how ought
[28:37] I love my neighbor as
[28:39] myself this may mean very little if we
[28:42] were just all living in the middle of
[28:44] nowhere and when we left here we all
[28:46] drove six hours in different directions
[28:48] and we lived on a 30 acre plot of land
[28:50] and we were 100 of miles away from
[28:51] society but think about it we live in a
[28:53] community of nearly six million
[28:56] people and and though there's uh maybe
[28:59] there's a lot more distance these days
[29:01] because working from home and distance
[29:02] educ doing school online and these
[29:04] things but we exist among a lot of
[29:06] people and we also live along among a
[29:08] very large Christian Community and we
[29:10] live also amongst a very large message
[29:12] believing community and we better know
[29:14] who our neighbor is and we better know
[29:16] how to love our neighbor or we won't be
[29:18] pres presenting Christ the correct way
[29:21] and the wor of is it will actually be
[29:23] giving the message a bad name within the
[29:25] a community of people which call
[29:27] themselves The Message and also within
[29:28] the community of people that call
[29:29] themselves Christians and then within
[29:31] the larger Community as a whole we do
[29:33] not want to profane and bring any
[29:36] reproach to this gospel
[29:39] amen therefore we ought not to think
[29:41] that we're just a little bit better than
[29:42] somebody
[29:43] else but notice when Jesus said he that
[29:46] is the greatest among you shall be your
[29:47] servant notice what he does here in John
[29:50] Chapter 13 I only had verse four and
[29:52] five but I want to read verse three
[29:55] notice what precedes this tremendous AC
[29:58] of humility Jesus knowing that the
[30:01] father had given all things into his
[30:03] hands and that he was come from God and
[30:06] went to God now if you could just kind
[30:07] of let that sink in I know that all
[30:11] things have been given into my hands I
[30:14] come from God and I go to God now if you
[30:17] had that Revelation right now what would
[30:19] be your first
[30:22] act what would be the first thing you
[30:24] would do right now you're just sitting
[30:25] here you're in you're in the Camel Back
[30:27] Room here the
[30:30] Marriott 2029 Whispering Wind or
[30:32] something like that I'm getting all my
[30:33] ww's weeping willow Whispering Wind they
[30:36] all kind of run
[30:37] together but here you are you're sitting
[30:39] in the room and all of a sudden you get
[30:41] this Revelation and God tells you I've
[30:44] given you all power everything's been
[30:46] given put into your
[30:48] hands you came from God perfect
[30:51] Revelation you come from God and you're
[30:52] going back to God what's your first act
[30:54] what do you do you sit there and you
[30:56] start going
[31:00] yes yes yes I'm gonna I'm G to get what
[31:03] I want I'm gonna get to do what I want
[31:06] what would be your first act well let's
[31:08] take a cue from verse
[31:10] four Jesus says he riseth from supper
[31:13] and laid aside his
[31:15] garments took a towel and girded
[31:18] himself after that he pth water into a
[31:21] basin and began to wash the disciples
[31:24] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[31:27] wherewith he was
[31:29] garded this is his first act by one who
[31:33] knows all power is his the First Act by
[31:36] one he come knows he comes from God he
[31:38] goes back to God and the first thing he
[31:40] does is he actually lays aside his
[31:42] garments he doesn't say this is the
[31:44] reveal guys hey guess what this is who
[31:47] I've been all along you guys didn't
[31:48] really know he does it's he actually
[31:50] wants to take that this his humility to
[31:53] a deeper level why because he that is
[31:56] greatest among you let let him be your
[31:58] servant so his first act as the one who
[32:01] is all things have given been given to
[32:03] him all power in Heaven and Earth has
[32:05] been given to him listen this ought to
[32:06] be instructed to us to those of us
[32:08] who've received in this last day a
[32:10] revelation that takes us back to the
[32:11] beginning in places the title deed of
[32:14] redemption into our hands where we
[32:15] become the final voice to the final age
[32:18] and the Final Act of redemption is going
[32:20] to be lived out through your bodies
[32:22] we've got to have this kind of nature
[32:24] this kind of disposition or that act is
[32:26] never going to take place
[32:28] amen kind of walking around saying who
[32:30] wants to benefit from my third pole
[32:32] Revelation you need something let me
[32:34] speak it for you and we're just kind of
[32:36] walking around listen you're never going
[32:37] to get to the place where things are
[32:39] going to be spoken into creation you'll
[32:41] never get that place by lifting yourself
[32:44] up you only get to that place by bending
[32:46] yourself down amen it'll only be through
[32:49] acts of humility that this bride will
[32:51] ultimately come to the place where that
[32:53] kind of power is free to be exercised
[32:55] through her
[32:58] he laid aside His Garment he's becoming
[33:01] bare before them takes a towel and GDs
[33:04] himself pours water into a basin and
[33:08] becomes what they would have called at
[33:09] that time a just a footwash
[33:13] flunky and we all we all wear Nice Kicks
[33:16] came tonight with our church Yeezys on
[33:19] we have Darn Tough socks on our feet
[33:22] smell good and we have $250 pair of
[33:24] shoes on and we walk on sidewalks and we
[33:27] all get pedicures and our feet are nice
[33:29] right we all have nice soft
[33:31] feet these guys wore
[33:34] sandals and walked on roads that weren't
[33:37] driven on by
[33:40] Teslas but you had
[33:43] animals and dust so what would their
[33:46] feet be
[33:47] collecting it would have been a pretty
[33:49] thing so sometimes that we can make this
[33:52] feet washing one another's feet so
[33:54] sterile where our biggest problem we
[33:55] wash one another's feet is foot length
[33:57] we're like oh my goodness his brother
[33:58] didn't bother cleaning between his toes
[33:59] and the the water's all cloudy now but
[34:02] think about what these feet would have
[34:04] looked like here's Jesus pouring water
[34:07] into a
[34:09] basin and when you read this it's easy
[34:11] because the order of communion is
[34:12] sometimes lost in scripture where they
[34:15] they we think that the communion was
[34:17] first and then he washed one another's
[34:18] feet but that would have that would it's
[34:20] actually scripturally he first washed
[34:22] their feet and then they would have
[34:23] taken the meal later so there's somebody
[34:27] in this group
[34:28] that he knows is going to betray
[34:31] him he's the one that has sold him out
[34:35] and when he came to that one he didn't
[34:38] say
[34:39] next he knelt before the one that
[34:42] betrayed him and washed his feet what
[34:46] did Brother Brown tell us live for the
[34:48] one that hates you live for the one that
[34:50] would kill you if he could Jesus did
[34:53] it laid aside His Garment so much that
[34:56] we could amplify in the wording that's
[34:57] painted within this scripture but let's
[34:59] just paint the picture in our
[35:01] minds if we were as we are here gathered
[35:04] in the in a room like this if everyone
[35:07] was seated and one had laid aside their
[35:10] garments and so they they're putting
[35:11] aside their clothing and here maybe just
[35:13] in their undergarments they take a towel
[35:15] and gird themselves so there's no way to
[35:17] tell there would be no way to tell what
[35:19] this man's station would be or what his
[35:21] rank would be by virtue of him shedding
[35:22] his clothing he's now just in a common
[35:24] undergarment he takes his towel and GDs
[35:26] himself there's some that even paint the
[35:28] picture that he might be very near naked
[35:30] he puts a towel on him and then he
[35:31] begins to kneel before these men and he
[35:33] begins to wash their feet paint the
[35:35] picture not as we have the Lord's supper
[35:37] and we have the picture of the last
[35:39] supper and everyone's kind of leaning in
[35:40] and you see everybody in their places
[35:42] but now paint the picture where there's
[35:43] a man on his knees washing somebody's
[35:45] dirty feet and then ask yourself when
[35:47] you walk in the room who's the greatest
[35:50] here when you look at that picture say
[35:52] now which one is the master which one is
[35:54] the servant which one in this picture is
[35:57] the the least the carnal eyes would look
[35:59] at the say well this guy's obviously the
[36:01] servant he's actually the poorest of
[36:03] amongst them he's probably does even
[36:04] belong here he's just washing their feet
[36:06] he's soon going to take his leave
[36:08] because these people must be important
[36:10] the ones that are sitting waiting for
[36:11] their feet to be washed and this one
[36:13] who's washing the feet he must be the
[36:14] least and we would have it completely
[36:18] backwards when you look at that picture
[36:20] who's the one that's loving his neighbor
[36:23] as himself who's the one that's being
[36:24] neighborly
[36:28] Jesus didn't concern himself with the
[36:31] Optics like I'm the greatest and if
[36:34] somebody walks in I mean I know These
[36:36] Guys these 12 know who I am but what if
[36:38] someone walks in what are they going to
[36:41] think if I'm washing somebody's feet
[36:43] they're going to have this picture all
[36:44] backwards he wasn't worried about Optics
[36:47] neither was a
[36:49] Samaritan his goal was fulfilling all
[36:52] righteousness that's why he could come
[36:54] to the the Jordan to be baptized in
[36:57] humble himself to the prophet to be
[36:59] baptized when John said there's one
[37:01] coming amongst you whose shoes I'm not
[37:03] even worthy to unloose his shoes I'm not
[37:06] even worthy to do it and Jesus and we
[37:08] can say this is true in reality he's
[37:10] greater he's one greater than John but
[37:11] when he comes to John John said I have
[37:13] need for you to baptize me there's the
[37:15] right kind of humility there's the right
[37:16] kind of attitude in light of the
[37:18] greatness of Christ but Jesus says no
[37:20] suffer not to be so I have need to be
[37:21] baptized of you just using my own
[37:23] phrasing and just as much as John
[37:26] suffered himself to baptized Jesus Jesus
[37:29] is suffering himself to be baptized by
[37:31] John and he's yielding himself and
[37:32] submitting himself to the
[37:36] prophet and unless we lay aside our
[37:42] self-righteousness and in laying that
[37:44] aside put on genuine humility will never
[37:46] be
[37:49] effective will never be effective
[37:51] there's there's been so much of me
[37:53] wanting to connect this to the reality
[37:55] of this end time and rapturing faith and
[37:57] there's been some scriptures we used in
[37:58] the beginning that I wanted to kind of
[38:00] Branch off of and used at the beginning
[38:02] of this uh these sermons on who is my
[38:04] neighbor to Branch off of to show that
[38:06] the bride's maturity and the bride's
[38:08] coming to a place of climactic power is
[38:11] not through the way that we think it's
[38:13] going to happen in know from a worldly
[38:15] standpoint a worldly view it's how the
[38:17] third pool gets twisted up where it
[38:18] becomes something that's completely not
[38:20] but you'll find that there's got to be
[38:22] humility there's got to be submission
[38:24] and there has to be a total dependence
[38:26] upon God to fulfill his word from start
[38:28] to finish otherwise it's never going to
[38:31] happen and if we're presuming if we're
[38:34] acting arrogantly if we're not walking
[38:35] in humility and if there's not acts of
[38:37] humility in our lives then we're not
[38:39] coming to that place and drawing near to
[38:41] the image that's going to speak and be
[38:43] the final voice to the final
[38:45] age unless we lay aside
[38:47] self-righteousness genuinely put on
[38:49] humility our Christianity the power that
[38:52] we have in this word of God is not fully
[38:55] effective and and I I there is this was
[38:59] I was debating it or or mulling over it
[39:02] to be a sermon in itself but too many
[39:04] Christians are just plain
[39:07] mean and I'm not making any distinction
[39:11] amongst the uh denominations and non-
[39:14] denominations just people who name the
[39:15] name of Christ they could be just plain
[39:17] mean and they could be so arrogant
[39:19] towards others especially if they
[39:24] disagree if I if I knew if I was under
[39:27] the impression and that we both agreed
[39:30] then I can be kind to you I can be nice
[39:32] to you as soon as you find out there's a
[39:34] difference everything
[39:36] changes and it's amazing just how mean
[39:39] people who name the name of Christ can
[39:41] be and just how arrogant and spiteful
[39:43] they can be towards people that they
[39:45] have a difference with and it really is
[39:48] a shame and so I had been collecting uh
[39:52] tweets and different things I come
[39:55] across that uh indicate
[39:58] kind of the
[39:59] impression that Christians give others
[40:01] and I want to show this tweet here
[40:02] brother John if you can put this
[40:04] up I if you can see this this was a
[40:07] tweet I removed the handle so that
[40:09] nobody would go try to find who this guy
[40:11] was and follow him I don't know what
[40:12] else he believes or follows but being a
[40:15] server the past three years I can say
[40:17] without a shadow of doubt that the
[40:19] Sunday after church crowd people who
[40:22] folks who went to church is full of the
[40:25] rudest most self-entitled and most
[40:27] ignorant people to ever walk this
[40:31] Earth and you find this isn't just an
[40:34] outlier you'll find a lot of people that
[40:36] work in the in the restaurant industry
[40:38] that feel exactly the same way so
[40:40] there's a lot of reply replies to the
[40:41] tweets that said and the worst tippers
[40:46] too and and just as you Ponder this and
[40:49] you continue just to look at this tweet
[40:51] how someone could make the claim that in
[40:53] their in their time of serving people
[40:55] it's not the drunk crowd on a Friday
[40:58] night it's the people who've just left
[41:01] church show up at a restaurant and
[41:04] they're the ones complaining and they're
[41:05] the ones that feel self-entitled and
[41:07] they're the ones that are rude and
[41:08] they're the ones that are ignorant and
[41:11] arrogant and this is the experience of a
[41:13] lot of people is there anybody here that
[41:14] want to say Amen to
[41:16] that I mean anybody that's worked in the
[41:19] service industry has probably
[41:21] experienced this it's the church folks
[41:24] that have the worst
[41:26] reputation and treat people the
[41:29] worst and what does it relate to and I
[41:31] just want to use some phrases here that
[41:33] maybe just get us thinking but it's our
[41:34] orientation towards
[41:38] others it's our attitude towards others
[41:41] that's really manifesting
[41:43] itself and listen people know when you
[41:46] look down on
[41:47] them and if you're being condescending
[41:49] but not condescending not being
[41:51] condescending down to them you're being
[41:53] condescending there's a difference if
[41:55] you're being condescending to them they
[41:58] know they know when you're looking down
[42:00] at them they know when you're talking
[42:01] down to them and you're never going to
[42:03] you help somebody by looking down on
[42:04] them patting them on the head you poor
[42:06] little
[42:09] Heathen and the problem is with a lot of
[42:11] people who name the name of Christ
[42:13] they're more concerned with being right
[42:16] than they are with being
[42:18] Christlike they're more concerned with
[42:20] being right than they are with being
[42:23] Christ and when that happens we value
[42:25] our reputation more than we do the
[42:28] testimony of
[42:29] Christ we value our reputation more than
[42:33] we value his testimony there's a
[42:35] difference between your rest uh your
[42:37] your reputation and your
[42:39] testimony and we're too busy building
[42:41] our own reputation and because we're so
[42:43] busy building a reputation we can never
[42:45] have a
[42:47] testimony because the testimony is his
[42:49] it's what he's doing through you but you
[42:50] got so much of yourself out front you're
[42:52] not building a testimony you're building
[42:54] a reputation and you wonder why people
[42:56] say the things they do about you or feel
[42:58] the way they feel about you listen if
[43:00] you feel like I'm preaching to you I am
[43:02] preaching to
[43:04] you but we should all take it very
[43:07] personal Lord don't let me become that
[43:09] crabby cranky arrogant ignorant rude
[43:13] self-entitled
[43:17] Christian being a server for three years
[43:20] taught him that
[43:23] Christians who just went to church are
[43:26] the wor first I mean didn't say hey it's
[43:29] a Saturday night they hadn't been in
[43:30] church since Wednesday night I get it
[43:32] it's it's rough it's kind of a crazy
[43:34] crowd here that a little bit irritable
[43:36] no they just went to church they just
[43:37] got filled
[43:39] up they just got taught you know love
[43:41] your neighbor as yourself be kind humble
[43:43] yourself and they
[43:44] went and then they leave and they go to
[43:47] the restaurant and they belittle people
[43:50] humiliate them talk down to them and
[43:53] then notice this next piece of viral
[43:59] material this is a
[44:02] receipt has the amount a tip which had
[44:05] been added in already maybe it was a
[44:06] party over eight but it's an 18% tip
[44:10] they put a zero and then they carry down
[44:12] the total amount remove the tip put the
[44:14] same amount so they give them zero for a
[44:17] tip now what kind of hether reprobate
[44:20] would do that somebody who says I give
[44:23] God 10% why do you get 18
[44:28] and says Pastor they sign it
[44:33] Pastor Lois Bell or I don't know how
[44:36] they say their name
[44:37] exactly this is like this is really
[44:41] amazing to me I mean I could get it if
[44:43] they kind of forgot who they were for a
[44:44] moment didn't know they were a Christian
[44:46] but they're actually using God and their
[44:50] title to take somebody who's just served
[44:52] them at a restaurant and say I give God
[44:55] 10% why should I give you
[44:58] 18 and then wants to kind of reinforce
[45:01] it so we realize this guy this this
[45:03] person knows what they're talking about
[45:08] Pastor so that you read that and go
[45:11] silly me why did I ever why did I even
[45:12] think to put a tip on there I should
[45:15] have comped their meal and chase them
[45:16] down sorry I didn't know you were
[45:18] Christian your meal I comped your meal
[45:20] here's the new receipt it's zeroed
[45:23] out but does this not reflect the
[45:25] attitude that some people have yes and
[45:28] of course afterwards it's just a lapse
[45:29] of judgment and I will go take
[45:31] sensitivity training classes and I will
[45:33] learn not to be you know be little
[45:39] servers but never truly getting to the
[45:42] core of what caused that kind of
[45:44] attitude to begin
[45:48] with all right enough tweets for one
[45:51] night verse 33 but a certain Samaritan
[45:54] as he journeyed came where he was
[45:57] we're just taking a step further now and
[45:59] when he saw
[46:00] him what does it mean when he saw
[46:03] him it's a it's through this
[46:06] process as he journeyed this manner of
[46:08] life this conduct way of thinking a way
[46:10] of feeling a way of deciding he came
[46:12] where he was this is an act of humility
[46:14] he's humbling himself and once he
[46:16] humbles himself he can see
[46:18] him he can really recognize the severity
[46:21] of the
[46:22] situation he can really appreciate
[46:24] what's truly happened he can recognize
[46:26] realize truly what his condition
[46:29] is and until we take the risk of
[46:32] lowering ourselves until we take the
[46:35] risk of condescending we'll never see
[46:37] correctly you'll always see it from the
[46:39] wrong angle you'll always see it just a
[46:40] little bit
[46:42] skewed but you got to allow these veils
[46:44] of pride and arrogance which distort our
[46:47] view of what we're looking at we got to
[46:48] let those things Fall
[46:50] Away the veil of pride and arrogance
[46:53] will just distort our view and if we can
[46:56] let those Fall Away we can truly see the
[46:57] need in someone's life and then truly
[46:59] render
[47:00] service came where he was and when he
[47:04] saw
[47:06] him's not he's not looking at him
[47:08] incorrectly he's not judging
[47:11] him he's not putting him in a particular
[47:13] category deeming whether or not he's
[47:14] worthy of Mercy deeming whether or not
[47:16] he's worthy of
[47:18] Grace but he sees him says in Matthew
[47:22] Chapter 5 and Luke chapter 6 two
[47:23] different verses to make the same point
[47:25] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[47:28] obtain Mercy the merciful are those that
[47:31] have mercy on one who is Afflicted to
[47:33] help one Afflicted or seeking Aid to
[47:35] bring help to one who is wretched so it
[47:38] takes the ability to recognize that one
[47:40] is Afflicted that one needs Aid and that
[47:43] one is wretched but also the capacity to
[47:46] render it it's one thing to look at
[47:48] somebody say oh boy they need Jesus and
[47:51] another thing to be the very vessel
[47:52] through which Jesus comes it's easy to
[47:55] recognize somebody who's in need but do
[47:57] you have the ability and the capacity to
[47:59] render the aid and to give the mercy
[48:02] when someone needs it blessed are the
[48:04] merciful for they shall obtain Mercy
[48:06] then Luke Chapter 6:36 be therefore
[48:08] merciful as your father also is
[48:12] merciful you notice how this is almost
[48:15] akin to Matthew I think it's 548 where
[48:16] it says be therefore
[48:19] perfect even as your heavenly Father
[48:21] which in your heavenly father is perfect
[48:23] your father which is in heaven is
[48:24] perfect so we're told to be perfect is
[48:26] is your god father in Heaven is perfect
[48:28] but we're also told to be merciful as
[48:30] your father is also merciful this is an
[48:32] attribute of his
[48:34] Perfection if you believe that you're
[48:36] perfect but it's it's weighed in
[48:38] arrogance or it's weighted with
[48:39] arrogance and it's expressed arrogance
[48:40] that is not Perfection because the
[48:43] father's Perfection embodies a a desire
[48:45] to be merciful be ye therefore merciful
[48:48] Have Mercy On The Afflicted render Aid
[48:50] to those who need it bring help to The
[48:52] Wretched be therefore merciful as your
[48:54] father also is merciful otherwise you
[48:56] cannot be perfect as your father is
[48:59] perfect it's a very conclusion that this
[49:01] lawyer came to in Luke 10:37 well which
[49:05] one was neighbored to him who fell among
[49:06] Thieves he said the one that showed
[49:09] Mercy on
[49:10] him which is kindness towards the
[49:12] miserable and The Afflicted joined with
[49:15] the desire to help
[49:19] them kindness towards the miserable with
[49:23] a desire to help them
[49:27] a certain Samaritan as he journe came
[49:28] where he was and because he's gone
[49:30] through this pattern gone through these
[49:32] steps came to where he was there he
[49:34] could see
[49:36] him and once he recognizes what he needs
[49:40] he's
[49:41] merciful because he's not only willing
[49:43] to see him as needy but willing to give
[49:46] him what he
[49:49] needs if you could
[49:53] somehow look at the picture that I've
[49:55] been trying to paint through this
[49:57] almost an hour or so
[50:00] tonight of an act of humility and
[50:02] humbling
[50:03] ourselves and in getting rid of uh
[50:07] ignorance and being rude and
[50:09] self-entitled and I give God 10% why
[50:12] could I should I give you 18% get rid of
[50:14] all those mechanisms that create those
[50:16] kind of attitudes self-entitlement you
[50:18] owe it to me you don't you know who I am
[50:21] uh kind of mentality or this attitude of
[50:23] arrogance and get lifted up which we
[50:25] could go back and say where does this
[50:26] come from why does that why does that
[50:27] happen that way a place of emptiness
[50:29] being a stuffed shirt always trying to
[50:32] be a put on but if we know we're
[50:35] great then there's your opportunity to
[50:37] let that server on a Sunday think that
[50:39] they're
[50:42] great because we want to talk down to
[50:44] them I can't believe you're working on
[50:45] Sunday not realizing kind of like
[50:48] the Paradox of that comment or the even
[50:50] the hypocrisy of it like well you're
[50:52] here eating like if you just go home I
[50:55] wouldn't need to be here
[51:01] braah but if you could just think about
[51:05] it I wanted to read this statement at
[51:07] the end of last
[51:09] service and I I felt it just um there's
[51:12] two more statements I want to read and I
[51:13] wanted to read them at the end so I
[51:14] brought them to the end now because I
[51:15] think it's kind of climactic and it we
[51:17] can just view what's happening in these
[51:19] statements better through kind of
[51:21] walking through the scripture this way
[51:23] brother Abraham's praying at the end of
[51:26] a service
[51:28] and there's a Democrat president in
[51:33] office and he's got what he
[51:36] deserved heart
[51:37] attack right uhhuh you feel
[51:41] me like he's a Democrat he deserves
[51:44] it he's getting what he wants I mean
[51:47] could you just imagine if Obama had a
[51:48] heart attack you know all the Christians
[51:52] you know that dancing in the streets
[51:54] burning mattresses in West Virginia and
[51:57] couches in
[52:00] Ohio but notice what really happens
[52:03] here's brother Baron praying our
[52:04] heavenly father we are standing in a
[52:06] desperate need for the leader of our
[52:08] nation our
[52:10] president he may never know this Lord
[52:12] but you know it I pray for brother
[52:15] Johnson as he professes to be a believer
[52:18] in
[52:19] you now what did what what was the
[52:21] requirement for brother brandham to call
[52:23] Lyndon B Johnson he was a Texan so maybe
[52:25] you could call him brother just upon
[52:27] that basis but he said he calls him
[52:29] brother Johnson as he professes to be a
[52:32] believer in you now he said this is a
[52:34] desperate need and father a heart attack
[52:37] we understand has struck him I pray God
[52:39] spare his life we're in a national
[52:43] crisis right now anyhow let thy Spirit
[52:45] come upon him Lord and right now in the
[52:48] hospital wherever he may be let your
[52:49] spirit come down to that Walter Reed
[52:51] hospital and touch his body sparing his
[52:54] life
[52:55] Lord now you want to talk about somebody
[52:58] who Journeys lives a certain way has a
[52:59] certain way of thinking feeling and
[53:01] deciding who can come where someone is
[53:03] and see him when he saw him here's
[53:06] brother bandam who's been able to Humble
[53:07] himself and condescend and even though I
[53:10] would say this Prophet was greater than
[53:12] the president he's using a language to
[53:14] give respect to this man and he said the
[53:16] man's Under Pressure more pressure than
[53:19] what we understand so we pray God as
[53:22] Believers and as a part of this nation
[53:24] we pray for our leader that you will
[53:25] grant him an extension of life in this
[53:28] great
[53:29] hour could you pray for someone you
[53:31] wouldn't vote
[53:34] for could
[53:36] you or would you immediately begin to
[53:38] think well wait a minute if he has a
[53:39] heart attack is there a way to rewind
[53:41] this is there a way to are we all
[53:42] praying that something happens to
[53:44] Biden that maybe if something happens to
[53:46] him before the election certified then
[53:48] maybe there's a way we can kind of
[53:49] squeeze in another four years of
[53:51] trump this is a challenge to our biases
[53:54] a challenge challenge to our attitudes
[53:56] we're more concerned about we value our
[53:58] reputation more than we do our testimony
[54:00] or his testimony we're more concerned
[54:02] about being right than we are about
[54:04] being
[54:05] Christlike and here's a point where
[54:08] brother Brandon may have differed
[54:09] politically may have voted
[54:11] differently but he recognized this is
[54:13] not a time for politics I'm going to
[54:16] pray for our president brother Johnson
[54:18] the man's Under Pressure more than what
[54:20] we
[54:22] understand this is an empathy brother
[54:25] brandham could understand
[54:27] and he's going to say God spare his
[54:32] life and I want to take it one step
[54:35] further in verse
[54:36] 33 but a certain Samaritan as he
[54:38] journeyed came where he was and when he
[54:42] saw him he had compassion on him he felt
[54:47] pity for
[54:49] him his compassion was the result of his
[54:52] willingness to Humble
[54:54] himself so it it can't even be unlocked
[54:57] it can't even be loosed from a a
[54:59] position of arrogance looking down on
[55:01] someone but because he came to where he
[55:03] was and saw him as he was his compassion
[55:06] could then be
[55:07] free and often we lack compassion
[55:11] because we lack
[55:12] perspective we can't have passion
[55:15] because we're unwilling to gain the
[55:17] perspective we're not willing to see it
[55:19] for what it is we're not willing to put
[55:21] ourselves in position to really hear
[55:23] something out see it for the what it
[55:24] really is put ourselves in a place where
[55:26] maybe hear this person out let's listen
[55:28] to what they have to say let's truly
[55:30] understand what happened
[55:32] here I I wrote it down one time I tried
[55:34] to find it I had it in my Bible I used
[55:36] to carry it with me and it had so struck
[55:39] me one time this this phrase what can I
[55:41] learn from you no matter who it is what
[55:45] can I learn from
[55:47] you not always just thinking well I've
[55:49] got the answers I got the answers I got
[55:51] but what can I learn from
[55:53] you and often as I said a moment ago we
[55:55] lack compassion because we do not have
[55:58] perspective and we're really unwilling
[55:59] to even gain the perspective humble
[56:01] ourselves to the place where we get
[56:02] beneath somebody and from that Vantage
[56:05] Point go oh wait a minute I know what's
[56:09] wrong now I I would like to amplify this
[56:12] further later if we could but we know
[56:13] that compassion is to do the will of
[56:17] God and true compassion will never lead
[56:19] us to violate God's word true compassion
[56:22] will never lead us to compromise God's
[56:24] word true compassion will never cause us
[56:25] to den Den God's word true compassion
[56:27] will never otherwise cause us to reject
[56:29] the word of God therefore we ought not
[56:31] to be afraid of true
[56:33] compassion if we can gain perspective
[56:36] and be led by the Holy Spirit uh uh
[56:38] showing compassion to somebody will not
[56:40] be exhibited in denying the word of God
[56:42] or denying truth or rejecting truth or
[56:44] living contrary to the word of God
[56:46] compassion is to do the will of God if
[56:49] but if we're not willing to gain
[56:51] perspective and put ourselves in
[56:53] position to have compassion then we'll
[56:55] never do the will of God
[56:58] God as it says in verse 34 and he went
[57:01] to him notice just how it then UNF flows
[57:04] but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed
[57:05] came where he was and when he saw him he
[57:07] had compassion on him and went to him
[57:11] came to where he was saw him as he was
[57:14] then could come to
[57:16] him think of just how beautiful that is
[57:20] came to where he was saw him as he was
[57:22] therefore he could come to him now he
[57:24] was ready to serve
[57:26] now he was present fully aware fully
[57:30] there to where he could render the aid
[57:33] and there he bound his wounds and poured
[57:35] in the oil and wine and set him on his
[57:36] own beast and brought him to an end and
[57:39] took care of him this is an individual
[57:42] responsibility of a Christian we all
[57:44] have a responsibility as Christians to
[57:46] to take care of those who need to be
[57:48] taken care of he came to where he was he
[57:51] saw him as he was but now he could come
[57:53] to him takes it a step closer and now
[57:56] he's in a position to help
[58:04] him brother Mike if you could come we'll
[58:07] close the service with this
[58:09] statement it's a very powerful
[58:11] statement as we read how brother
[58:13] brandham prayed
[58:15] for brother Johnson he said as he
[58:18] professes to be a believer as we're
[58:19] trying to look at this the attitude and
[58:21] the conduct of this Good
[58:23] Samaritan in light of the attitude of
[58:25] the Jew Jews towards
[58:28] him in light of the politics that would
[58:30] have dictated that this would not be the
[58:32] right thing to
[58:34] do in light of all the different things
[58:37] that we could could be expressed here we
[58:39] could talk about try to take it all now
[58:42] as a full picture listen to what brother
[58:43] bradam says he says you know what a
[58:45] blessing is do something for somebody
[58:49] else I thought a blessing was something
[58:51] I
[58:52] got right but you know what a blessing
[58:55] is it's do something for somebody else
[58:58] that's right and if you have a neighbor
[59:01] or somebody that's done you
[59:04] Injustice who's my neighbor and not just
[59:07] who's my neighbor how do I love my
[59:09] neighbor if you have a neighbor somebody
[59:11] that's done you an
[59:13] injustice now I'm not asking you to
[59:15] think of that person right now
[59:17] necessarily but maybe some of you have
[59:19] already thought of that person he says
[59:21] remember this for me don't never turn
[59:24] him down
[59:26] somebody's hurt you somebody who's
[59:29] harmed you somebody who's been a Shyer
[59:31] to you somebody that you feel has done
[59:33] something very somebody who's done
[59:35] something like a Judas to
[59:37] you brother BR says remember this for me
[59:40] don't never turn him
[59:42] down and he says take him to God in
[59:46] prayer and see what a different attitude
[59:49] you'll have now the picture he paints
[59:52] here is so profound to me if you're
[59:54] sincere in prayer you stand shoulder
[59:57] toosh shoulder with him though he's done
[1:00:00] you wrong Injustice but you just take
[1:00:02] that man to
[1:00:05] [Music]
[1:00:07] God and stand there in the presence of
[1:00:10] the father one
[1:00:12] time and say
[1:00:14] father my neighbor has done me wrong but
[1:00:18] I guess watch when you go to telling his
[1:00:21] wrong it'll not only help him but it
[1:00:26] help you
[1:00:28] also he prefaces this by saying you know
[1:00:31] what a blessing is do something for
[1:00:33] somebody else if somebody's done you an
[1:00:35] injustice don't ever turn him down take
[1:00:38] him to God In Prayer see what a
[1:00:39] different attitude you'll have so now
[1:00:41] take him in prayer notice the picture
[1:00:43] that brother BR paints if you're sincere
[1:00:45] in your prayer you stand
[1:00:46] shoulder-to-shoulder with him though
[1:00:48] he's done you wrong Injustice but you
[1:00:51] just take that man to God and stand
[1:00:53] there in the presence of the father
[1:00:55] sometimes say father my neighbor has
[1:00:57] done me
[1:00:59] wrong and the picture he paints is that
[1:01:02] you would actually go before God in
[1:01:03] prayer and you would bring this person
[1:01:06] up who's done you wrong and you would
[1:01:08] stand there with them in the presence of
[1:01:10] God and put your arm around him and
[1:01:12] stand shoulder toosh shoulder before God
[1:01:15] and say God this brother has done me
[1:01:18] wrong this man has done me wrong and now
[1:01:21] you've brought him into the presence of
[1:01:23] God to tell God what he has done to you
[1:01:26] and in telling God standing shoulder to-
[1:01:28] shoulder with him with your arm around
[1:01:30] him cuz what have you done you haven't
[1:01:32] left him laying in the ditch yeah you
[1:01:35] haven't left him out there in Leo to Sea
[1:01:37] you haven't left him in sin you haven't
[1:01:38] left him in the house of ill-repute you
[1:01:39] haven't left him as some kind of Shyer
[1:01:41] some kind of shady friend somebody who's
[1:01:43] done you wrong but you actually have
[1:01:44] taken him and taken him with you to
[1:01:47] prayer and said he's just as worthy to
[1:01:49] stand before you as I am amen and said
[1:01:52] Lord I'm going to I'm here with my my
[1:01:55] neighbor and he's done me wrong he says
[1:01:57] you go to talking about what he's done
[1:01:59] wrong as you stand there in the presence
[1:02:01] of God shoulder Tosh shoulder all of a
[1:02:02] sudden you begin to see him
[1:02:04] differently and all a sudden you begin
[1:02:06] to realize the things that makes him
[1:02:08] that way the reason why he did that you
[1:02:11] maybe begin to give them the benefit of
[1:02:12] the doubt you begin to op recognize the
[1:02:14] influences that are working on you say
[1:02:16] oh he did this to me he did that to me
[1:02:18] and Lord I realize he's had a rough life
[1:02:22] he's been rejected he's been abused he's
[1:02:24] got a lot of scars he got a lot of
[1:02:25] complex
[1:02:26] oh Lord forgive him I know he doesn't
[1:02:28] understand what he's doing and he's just
[1:02:30] taking it out on me Lord I know he
[1:02:31] doesn't really mean it Lord have mercy
[1:02:33] on Lord I take back all that Justice I
[1:02:35] declared upon him Lord all that mean
[1:02:37] things I said all the things I wanted to
[1:02:39] haveen to oh Lord maybe maybe I can make
[1:02:42] a difference for
[1:02:43] him yes he says it not only will help
[1:02:47] him but it'll help you also he says
[1:02:49] you'll see what he's been through in the
[1:02:51] Temptations and things it'll change your
[1:02:54] attitude towards that brother and it'll
[1:02:56] help him also you always are doing good
[1:03:01] when you're praying one for the
[1:03:04] other we may not be able to as this
[1:03:06] Samaritan
[1:03:08] did jump into a pit
[1:03:11] and bind wounds and pour in oil and wine
[1:03:14] and set them on a beast and bring them
[1:03:16] to an end and take care of we may not be
[1:03:17] able to do a lot of the things that get
[1:03:18] all the headlines the active things the
[1:03:20] Hands-On things but you can
[1:03:23] pray and you can take people who've
[1:03:25] offended you people who hurt you and you
[1:03:26] can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them
[1:03:28] in the presence of God and begin to pray
[1:03:29] even about what they've done to you but
[1:03:31] he says but as you do it it'll change
[1:03:34] your attitude towards that brother
[1:03:36] because you'll see what he's been
[1:03:37] through in Temptations and things it'll
[1:03:40] not only help him but it'll help you
[1:03:43] also I want that kind of
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:49] attitude that's the kind of attitude I
[1:03:51] want to have tonight Lord that's my
[1:03:54] prayer let me have this kind of
[1:03:56] instinct then they have this kind of
[1:03:58] nature Lord change my orientation
[1:04:00] towards others change my attitude
[1:04:03] towards others let me not value
[1:04:05] reputation more than the testimony of
[1:04:07] Christ let me not be so concerned about
[1:04:10] being right that I leave being
[1:04:13] Christlike will be much more
[1:04:16] effective there might be people you've
[1:04:18] been witnessing to hoping that they'll
[1:04:20] change you start looking at what you've
[1:04:22] done you think man I'd be kind of
[1:04:24] arrogant
[1:04:26] humble yourself to them and tell them
[1:04:28] you've been arrogant and say you know
[1:04:31] what I'm
[1:04:32] sorry I forgive me I've been kind of
[1:04:35] talking down to you and you know what
[1:04:37] I'm no better than you can we start over
[1:04:40] [Music]
[1:04:41] again and like we said last time you
[1:04:44] don't just talk about somebody if they
[1:04:46] like hunting talk about hunting just
[1:04:47] waiting for the next opportunity to talk
[1:04:49] about water baptism talk to them in a
[1:04:51] way to where they realize you do care
[1:04:54] you actually do care you actually are
[1:04:58] concerned and and this is a sincerity on
[1:05:01] your part that it's not like those
[1:05:03] people who who are just kind of pedaling
[1:05:05] to you some product they want you to
[1:05:06] sign up and they show a whole lot of

[1:09:14] God may I be like you let's just bow our
[1:09:20] heads in a word of
[1:09:22] prayer let's just be sincere before him
[1:09:26] I realize these series of services are
[1:09:29] uh
[1:09:30] challenging maybe in some ways to some
[1:09:33] people they might think that they're
[1:09:36] shallow but I believe they're they're
[1:09:38] they're very deep in that it gets to the
[1:09:41] real core of things the real heart of
[1:09:44] things and if I could just speak
[1:09:47] personally to you
[1:09:49] tonight you are you are handling the
[1:09:52] most powerful word there is
[1:09:56] and you have been blessed with the
[1:10:00] greatest
[1:10:02] Revelation that the church has been
[1:10:05] given you stand on the precipice of a
[1:10:07] body
[1:10:09] change the privilege and opportunity to
[1:10:11] exercise the greater faith and the
[1:10:13] greatest Faith that's ever been given to
[1:10:15] the Christian
[1:10:16] Church the seed of Faith which was swn
[1:10:18] on the day of Pentecost is now going to
[1:10:20] come to its Perfection to manifest a
[1:10:22] full and complete uh Redemption and
[1:10:24] fulfillment ment of a body like unto
[1:10:29] his the plan of God the Plan of
[1:10:31] Redemption is f is brought to finality
[1:10:34] in The Bride of his choosing now if
[1:10:36] that's this is the reality of the word
[1:10:38] that we walk in and and if that's if
[1:10:41] that's what we're facing as Believers if
[1:10:43] that's the place we're coming to as
[1:10:45] Believers listen that responsibility can
[1:10:48] only be handled through
[1:10:52] humility we we talk about applying the
[1:10:54] token we talk speaking the word we talk
[1:10:56] about power and power power where's the
[1:10:59] humility Jesus overcame by the word and
[1:11:04] humility we could claim that we love the
[1:11:06] word with all our minds and all our soul
[1:11:08] and all our
[1:11:10] heart but don't love our neighbor as
[1:11:12] oursel we claim to love God whom we have
[1:11:16] not seen and hate our brother whom we
[1:11:18] have
[1:11:19] seen maybe it seems to be Elementary but
[1:11:22] I say it's foundational to the point to
[1:11:25] this perfect house cannot stand without
[1:11:28] it and this bride that God's been
[1:11:30] building Through the Ages is going to
[1:11:32] stand upon these types of principles
[1:11:33] that Christ laid down and so tonight
[1:11:36] it's my prayer Lord make these things
[1:11:38] sure in my life let us pray our gracious
[1:11:42] Heavenly Father Lord as we close the
[1:11:45] service we're Desiring Lord that you
[1:11:48] would seal these things in our hearts as
[1:11:49] only you can that is by
[1:11:53] Revelation Lord take the real me need of
[1:11:55] it the real heart of it the real truth
[1:11:56] of it and I trust that that is what
[1:11:59] you've done is you've imparted it to
[1:12:01] us Lord beyond my mannerisms and even
[1:12:05] beyond my emphasis Lord May something
[1:12:07] have penetrated the heart to awaken a
[1:12:09] desire to be more like
[1:12:11] you Lord may it give us hope that as
[1:12:14] Christians as we desire to see others
[1:12:16] saved and as we desire to
[1:12:18] serve that if there has been a a lack of
[1:12:21] success as it was or if there has been a
[1:12:23] an inability to be effective
[1:12:27] there's no doubt that these things are
[1:12:29] corrective Lord to give us hope that
[1:12:32] it's not there's not something wrong
[1:12:33] with the
[1:12:35] word but there's just something wrong
[1:12:37] with the the presentation there's
[1:12:38] something wrong with the cart there's
[1:12:40] something wrong with the way that we're
[1:12:41] presented it I pray Lord you'd help us
[1:12:43] to be better ambassadors of this
[1:12:45] word better Bears of your presence
[1:12:49] season our speech with Grace
[1:12:51] Lord temper our tongues father
[1:12:56] sweeten our
[1:12:58] Spirits may we take these words which
[1:13:00] we've read tonight may they become
[1:13:02] instructions and guidelines to us Lord
[1:13:04] to walk according to these things not
[1:13:06] merely out of discipline but because
[1:13:08] Revelation quickens it gives life to
[1:13:10] these
[1:13:10] things to be used in our own flesh to be
[1:13:13] used in our own lives pray for all that
[1:13:15] are here Lord may you touch them may you
[1:13:16] bless them may you encourage them may
[1:13:20] you be with us Lord I pray grant us a
[1:13:23] Happy Thanksgiving may we be safe with
[1:13:24] our family amilies may we may not be
[1:13:26] able to gather like we would want to
[1:13:29] these are not normal circumstances Lord
[1:13:30] but may your presence be near to those
[1:13:32] who may seem alone families unable to
[1:13:34] gather with other family even members of
[1:13:36] this body who may not be in fellowship
[1:13:38] with ones tomorrow may they not feel
[1:13:41] alone Lord may we even have in our
[1:13:43] hearts to reach out to one another say
[1:13:45] I'm with you is there something I can do
[1:13:46] for you may not be able to come see you
[1:13:49] may not be able to be there by your side
[1:13:51] but Lord may they know we're with them
[1:13:54] maybe we sense the closeness to these
[1:13:56] this this time lord bring us together on
[1:13:59] Sunday to Fellowship once again around
[1:14:01] your word pray your blessings upon your
[1:14:04] people in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:06] Christ we pray amen
