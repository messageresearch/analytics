TRANSCRIPT
========================================
on Sunday we were ministering using the phrase uh from the devil uh I buy homes and in that using that phrase we were just looking at how Satan tricks us into giving up our homes uh the principle's been established that the house is the physical structure the home is something that's more intangible and how that we can surrender or forfeit that home life and that togetherness and those things that make a house a home while retaining the pretense of home or the Optics of home or just the house we were using the example in the garden how the Adam's home in Eden was sold in exchange for something that Satan offered the woman so there was this Bartered exchange where he was selling something she was willing to give something in exchange for that so it was a transaction I'd like to say it was a transaction for Value he made an offer um she accepted there was a consideration that was given and so there was this uh Satan was in the garden not to get the house but he wanted a home and it was brother Brenham talks about how Eve forfeited her virtue her virtuous rights he Eve sold her virtue and then there's a number of places where he's speaking of the devil and he says he sold too and he sold he sold he sold so we see the devil in the Garden of Eden um looking to uh make a deal and to make a transaction and what he wanted to buy was uh something that he could not create himself something he could not accomplish himself and brother Bradon makes the statement and the spoken word is the Original Seed he's speaking how Eve hybrid hybridized and hybrid something and brought the serpent in and he says listening for wisdom understanding knowledge so it's those three elements that he was offering her wisdom understanding and knowledge butam touches it in a number of different ways and if you look at the actual scriptures that deal with it then look at it through this lens how there was some wisdom understanding and knowledge that he was promising her it uh it it just it really opens things up to consider if there's something intangible or the the wisdom and the understanding knowledge or one thing but he always offers it in some package there's there's something he's giving you wanting you to uh relate to an enjoy or or to accept and we've been reading in Proverbs 24: 3 and 4 how that a house is built through wisdom and by understanding it is made firm and it is established and then through knowledge uh you can fill it up with the right kind of thing so wisdom builds understanding establishes in knowledge fills the rooms and every all the chambers with precious and pleasant riches so what Satan was offering her was wisdom understanding and knowledge so he was wanting to sell her what we would think would be the materials or the resources to have a home to build a house to establish it and to make it a home to fill it with all the precious and pleasant riches but it was a worldly wisdom a worldly understanding a worldly knowledge not in line with the word of of God and so we we were trying to say this that she sold her home and got Satan's Eden in exchang that the what he's used now to build his home and build his Eden is wisdom understanding and knowledge so through his wisdom he's built this home through un his understanding he's established it and has taken hold and with knowledge he's filling it not with these precious riches and pleasant riches but wickedness and brother baham says that Eve sold out to reasonings of wisdom and education says in one place that knowledge is what the devil sold Eve and we read that statement I thought it was very striking he says if you want to know what will be look at what has been and so that statement to me was this real important uh turning point of fulcrum to really uh use to say what's been in the garden and what's been through scripture is important to consider because he still wanted us to sell out to wisdom he's still wanting us to sell out to education he's still selling us knowledge not knowledge of the holy but he he's trying to sell us on his knowledge and he he's brother B says in one place he sold it to Eve and he sold it to us and so tonight as we go further in this subject if the home is more than the structure if the home is more than the furnishings and the things that we put in it then how can we forfeit our homes in the same way that Eve did and so I'm going to use this title tonight gaining the world but losing your home there may be a lot of things you gain it may be riches and it may be things that are uh luxurious things that are nice to have you may be able to have some sort of a pretense or the Optics of being successful but are we engaging in an exchange where we're getting something out of the world but losing something in our relationship with God and one another in the process and consider the ways that we do sell our homes on a daily basis in Mark 8: 36 and 37 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the hope world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul now again there's some of this tie into Sunday service so to the extent that it's review it's it's intentional now this verse 37 what shall a man give an exchange for his soul it's set forth this way that a man gains the world but in the process his soul is ransomed his soul is got exchanged then now having gained the world but paid the price of his soul the world is not enough to pay to get his soul back he says what can a man give in exchange for his soul though he has used the whole world uh gained the whole world and lost his soul he can't use the world to get his soul back so that should tell us that the world's going to offer us a lot of things um that we can give up in exchange for but what we get in exchange can't buy that back you need something greater you need a greater price you need the Lord to come on the scene and make the difference for for you and I want to look at it this way as if you look at Matthew chap 12 we'll touch on these things here quickly but the soul is to be the uh the place that the Holy Spirit dwells our soul becomes his the The Dwelling Place the habitation of the Holy Spirit and him having lived in him living in our souls it's kind of the idea is that it makes um our bodies his house to possess so the Holy Ghost is in our soul and then once he gets control of our soul he's taking possession of our minds ultimately one day to take full possession of this body so when we see that what shall it what shall it profit a man if his soul is exchanged for the world that soul is supposed to be the dwelling place of God so what you're giving up is his home and then in this image of a man being delivered from an evil spirit Jesus says when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest Matthew 12: 43 to 45 and I apologize if not every script rure and quote is in the slide deck tonight there were some things I just held back uh just so we could go quickly so when the unsp unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none this is the unclean Spirit then he saith I will return into my house from whence I came out so it's the unclean Spirit that's been cast out of a man so the spirit of a man is delivered from demon possession if we want to use that phrasing and now instead of the man being sealed with the Holy Ghost and finding somebody else resident in that person uh he comes back and it says he findeth the house the man empty swept and garnished and then it tells us that he goes and he finds seven other spirits that are more wicked than himself uh LW spirits of the baser sort and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first so we see the image according to even how brother bandham teaches this that he's this image of a man who is one possessed of an evil spirit it gets cast out of him but if nothing else takes possession if nothing else becomes the Lord of that house then he's empty and though he's empty it's not Barren it's swept and then garnished or adorned but he's not filled with the right things maybe he's filled with things that that evil spirit will actually find familiarity in things that this evil spirit can hide behind things that the evil spirit's like all right okay this is uh this isn't as foreign uh land as I thought it would be so you can be delivered but and then you fill yourself up with seemingly be is innocent things but it becomes a place for the devil to reside again so finding it empty we we need to be very careful in our own lives that we're filling our house houses up with the right things our minds our Spirits with the right things things that the devil would find uh it would make him uncomfortable to try to make that place a dwelling place but if I could describe it this way though it was garnished and adorned it wasn't it wasn't uh filled with things that would keep maintain The Possession and keep the wrong things out so there was a void or a vacuum for the world to enter and so in this exchange that he mentions how a man can exchange his soul for the world I want to use it as a parallel of exchanging our home for the world that the soul is to be a home for the Holy Spirit and we can in this in this emphasis is he's using it to teach a point uh not that any one of us should start going looking for that offer where we can actually gain the whole world for our souls but if the idea is that you could give up your soul but get something from the world in return and and and a man could find himself emptied out but not the Holy Spirit not take possession I want to use that as a parallel of how in our own personal lives we see that as the individuals but also in our families in our houses and in a church how we can exchange something of the world or something for the pretense or the Optics a and we pay the price but it creates this vacuum and in this exchange we lose out on the Holy Spirit and the presence of Christ I I think it's remarkable if you begin to think about just how many decisions we make every day I was fellowshipping with somebody on this I think it uh um recently on how many computations and things that we we decisions we make every day and how that and just how complex life is in those terms but transactions are being made every day we are making transactions every day as Spiritual Beings and we're either we're making transactions either to build our houses up to build our houses into homes or to sell it yeah now I know that may be like great you know now I've got to be worried about every decision I make whether I'm going organic or I'm going with this is it good the conversation was there's either good or evil and there's two influences God or the devil and so everything you do you go to reach for the you know milk and you're thinking am I being influenced by evil or good well relax right you know you should it be oat milk I think the sign I saw recently is oat milk the the milk that's actually made for humans it's good to have you back I'll I won't use it so I don't have to pay loyalty on it but there's in that sense I'm not saying this to make us nervous about every single decision but anything is say you know what I want to get serious about what motivates me I want to get serious about the the trajectory I'm on so that I don't get so legalistic I don't get so super spiritual to where I'm getting further away from God for the Optics of being Sanctified but recognize that there are very literal things we do every day to either build up our families or tear it down to build up the atmosphere in the home or to exchange it for Value to exchange it for something making doing transactions every day to sell our homes let me say that we can sell it piece by piece and we can also sell it Peace by piece because he promised us a place of a Peaceable habitation and we take peace that he's promised us and we exchange it and we begin to sell our peace peace by peace Joy by Joy Rest by rest for the things that the world has to offer so in selling it Peace by piece and that play on words uh Peace by peace isn't it isn't all at once but just foot by foot square foot by square foot footstep by footstep until the hole is gone just as one we could uh were to guard our hearts because out of it are the the issues of life and as we go through relationships and experiences we give up our our heart so often we're just piece by piece through our affections and our lust and our lovings and all those things that we're just giving heart our heart away over and over and over again to where no matter what we've done with our lips our hearts have always remained far from them and there's nothing left to give anymore and just as the children of Israel to go into were to go into the promised land and God said that he wouldn't drive everything out at once but by little and little he would drive them out until they were increased and inherit the land and it was footstep by footstep that they would take possession of their Homeland and so if possession is step by step and possession is is foot by foot then I can say that we can become dispossessed and we can sell it the same way inch by inch foot by foot if we build by square feet we can sell it by square feet we're putting our our houses up on S BNB and we let the devil rent out of room and he just doesn't want the room he wants to filter by whole house so we're transacting day by day gaining the world but losing our homes in Psalm 17 verse4 David has uh taken this this beautiful passage this prayer of David this confidence that he knows he's going to be found correct before the Lord but yet he has these enemies that are seeking after him to devour him to tear him down and we see the devil is in that that that's an image even of the devil but then he describes these men that want to harm him and he says deliver me from men which are thy hand oh Lord then he makes this phrase from Men of the world which have their portion in this life and it's this phrase I want us to really grab a hold of men of the world which have their portion in this life and then he describes them whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure they are full of children and leave the rest of their sub substance to their babes now what he's describing and I think even in the reading of this uh it kind of begs uh like what does this mean and and thy uh they're they're thy hand and their you fill their belly with these Hidden Treasures but as you take it all together men of this world which have their portion in this life and then he describes maybe how they would look and their their progeny but they their hearts are set Upon This World men of this world their hearts are set upon this world world and they don't have uh uh don't have or desire any other portion than what the world can offer their desires aren't set on things above they're not pursuing a Heavenly inheritance uh by appearances uh because their bellies are HID filled with hidden treasure and their children are going to receive a substance and a great inheritance by appearances they're prosperous uh by appearances they have land and they have wealth and they have all sorts of things and they have a lot of children and they can afford them and they're to pass down they couldn't even use up everything they have in this life so there's a great inheritance to be left to their children it's men of this world whose portions are in this life their their hearts are set on this world in Luke chapter 16:8 as we referred to it on Sunday how this uh unjust the Lord commanded the unjust Steward because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children children of light the children of this world I I see this as a companion to the men of the world which have their portion in this life the children of this world are always scheming always uh conniving and contriving for uh ways to provide for themselves just as Satan is a businessman who's working every angle uh to gain something for himself to get something out of it for himself this is how the world operates this is how men of the world are they're not truly alteristic and say I just want to do this for you and we're wanting to do this for you listen when they when uh I'm not I'm try to get in trouble in an election year but when a certain side tells you that they're really pushing green initiatives you know for the benefit of the people you're going to find a lot of their initiatives actually are detrimental to the very communities that they brag that they brag that they love and they want to look out after and there's usually somebody who's getting green right their green initiatives have more to do with the almighty dollar than does with really uh the almighty earth right and so there's a there's usually some economics behind if you ever want to you ever want to find out why something is the way it is in the world just say what's the economics behind it whatever it is the economics behind it why are cold Goods square right and dry goods and and uh beverages that are not cold kept cold why are they round because shelf space is much cheaper than Refrigeration space and so they they want things to be uniform they want to pack more in it it's economics it's behind everything I read a book no I'm just kidding so the children of this world mind worldly things and not God Walk not as a Gentiles walk who walk after the vanity of their minds and they're they're seeking Earthly things as one uh translation renders it their whole ambition whether their inclinations be gring or refined their whole ambition whether they be greedy and Lusty or they seem very refin their whole ambition is bounded by this present sphere and they have no taste for anything beyond it this they're hungry for the world the things of the world they want wealth they want possessions they want cars they want houses they want stocks they they they want all these things they want to accumulate they're worried about this life and the the the reputation that they have so when Jesus says the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light they're and their generation it means they're suited for the world that they're of the men of this world which have their portion in this life they're suited for this world that they're of because that's all they pursue that's all that they're interested in they seek nothing else but the world and what the world can give them you speak of spiritual things you speak of things that are Heavenly you think about storing Treasures up in heaven and they want to know what's the what's this can I look Heaven up online kind what's the ZIP code what's the run me the numbers uh uh I'm not going to do the market research just tell me if they put a Chick-fil-A there and I'll know the Market's good right you just they're they're in it for the money and when you tell them well Heaven's not on Earth Heaven's an atmospher and and Christ is a person who's unseen like well if I can't buy him if I can't benefit they don't want to have anything to do with it because they're wholly rooted in this present world and they want what this present world has to offer these are important things for us to consider when it comes to gaining the world and losing our homes Peace by peace where the world will offer us something and say you want this and you're like yeah I want that and you don't realize that in taking it it's got to take some place right right right it it it there's going to have to be some consideration given we know in Revelations 3:1 17 that the Bible tells us that leod deia's attitude is that they are rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing God's estimation of them as he sees them as they really are they are wretched miserable poor naked and blind and naked but yet they're so self-deluded in their riches and being increased with Goods that they H don't even want the Lord now I know it seems remarkable to think well brother Aaron we're not in danger at all of saying we don't want the Lord but really how comfortable have we gotten in our own abilities how comfortable have we gotten in what the Lord has done for us and we seem to get a little bit of momentum and we're thinking man I've got to think I've got this figured out God's blessing me things are working out we're making a little bit of money we're making a little bit of progress Things Are going good we found a good church things are really great but yet you begin to just kind of venture out on your own you're no longer depending upon God from start to finish you're no longer acting and behaving spiritually you're not humbling yourself and you kind of have this attitude that you don't need them because you're not humble anymore you're you're not you don't feel your weakness you don't feel you have too much self assurance and so those of Leo DEA have the abundance of things that give the appearance of stability they have the abundance of things that give the appearance of of Happiness they have the abundance of things that give the appearance of wealth that conspicuous spending uh there there are certain things that people buy and they buy them just for the sole purpose of saying look what I can afford a a and it's things that we might have I remember one time when I think when applications were just becoming new as we call them today apps for the cool kids uh and we were there were certain apps that were very very expensive and all they were is like a gold bar I was like what does it do nothing what's what's the point it's to show people that you paid $3,000 for that can't do anything else it's not going to be anything for but it's it's a um a status thing and and so there's a there's a mindset of being rich and increased with goods and finding Security in that to where it gives the appearance of having everything put together how gives the appearance of happiness and wealth brother Brown in the sermon Satan's Eden drawn a lot from this sermon this is a great time everybody has got money everybody can do this and everybody can do that money flow in every way and big cars and everything it really is the the the day and age we're living in and I'm not trying to trivialize anybody's financial situation and I'm certainly not making or dismissing the fact that there's some people that find themselves in Dire Straits where they are at a loss for or for money uh to pay for anything and they they have to beg for food and they lose their housing and there's some that even that we love and even some of us whove experienced situations where we feel destitute so it's a very real problem but anymore people can be quote unquote broke and still be able to buy $1,200 phones Drive decent cars get a lot of assistance and so our idea of poverty and depression and being broke is very different because everybody's got money everybody's got big things and everybody can get things it's just the way that things are right now and in Luke 17: 26 to 29 is I'm wanting just to kind of build up what this L Dean age is it says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it all be also in the days of the son of man we make this emphasis quite often instead of it remarking on the ungodliness of man and how his imagination was only on sin or evil continually and instead of raising up the the debauch things that they were doing he says they ate they drank they married wives and they were given in marriage and so it just seems very innocuous if we said well you know they were eating and drinking and you'd say well that's what people do around the dinner table and they were they were marrying and it just might mention things said this just seems to be what people do but yet this is really all they cared about the eating the drinking the Marans and even the giving in marriage there's some meanings behind that but it says they did this until the day that Noah entered the Ark the flood came and destroyed them all likewise as it was in the days of lot surely it would mention the the sexual depravity and the evilness and the wickedness but again it says they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded and I believe that Jesus uses the language that we can all identify with to say wow these are seemingly everyday innocuous routine things that we might be doing but yet it was something about the fact that really in the final analysis this is all they were doing it's all they cared about they ate they drank but yet it wasn't after spiritual things they bought they sold but it wasn't for the right kind of things they planted they build it but it was only Earthly things but the same day that lot went out of Sodom at rain fire and brimstone from Heaven destroyed them all no matter how much they ate they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it it still could not protect them from the Judgment that was to come and I believe that there's a real danger in just plowing ahead and making sure we have something to eat things to drink uhh uh clothes to wear buying selling planting building just getting in that routine of life in finding our Rhythm because there's a certain satisfaction we can find especially as men there's a certain satis action that our sisters can find in domesticating and there's a lot of ways we can just find that little that little pocket and feel real comfortable but if we're leaving out the things of God in all your planting buying selling and all that there's a transaction where you're losing spiritual things you're losing out on the blessings and presence of God and at some point there's going to be a noticeable noticeable deficit for believers and if you're not noticing it but yet it exists or you recognize that it exists and it doesn't bother you're like oh I never noticed that I guess I'm doing all right I would be very worried because these things that when the believer recognizes he's in deficit he gets very desperate and he realizes wait a minute I'm living far below my privileges doesn't matter to me if I make $10 million a year doesn't matter to me if I drive a nice car it doesn't matter to me if I can buy and I can do this and I can do that I can travel the world and I doesn't matter because what I need at the end of the day is I need the Lord in my life or none of this matters and brother Bram touches on how that it's a great time he's got money but he says it's the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never had a day like this we're now living it's Satan's eeden it's Satan's home this was supposed to be man's home God's creation is supposed to be home God created a garden in Eden this whole world was to be our domain it was to be our home it was to be our castle and it was sold in a transaction in the garden now Satan's made it his Eden he says there's never been a day like this it's the most cunning deceitful day and when I said see that see that it brings me to this that the Christian has to be more on his toe today than he ever was in any age we've got to be on our toes today on guard watching waking if we want to say concerned uh Discerning i' I'd rather I think it's better to be cautious and slow in things that just to think we're just going to rush in and if it messes up God will fix it for us I believe he does but sometimes there's a price to pay that we don't recognize in doing that there's a question leave it alone they need an answer now the answer is no there because there's a certain there certain thing I want to protect virtue I don't want to sell my home unknowingly unwittingly in mark 4: 19 Jesus in the parable The swer Good Seed was sewn into the world the seed found it sewn into the ground as the seed is being sewn there's different states of this ground and the state of the ground determined whether not the word was going to be fruitful and he says this about the seed that was sewn in ground where there was Weeds otherwise was good ground so it could nurture growth but it says in the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches we're living in an age where it says where the men of this world have their portion in this life and it's opulent it's conspicuous it's out there it's for show there's a lot of pressure anymore to meet certain Optics and and to keep up with the Jones there's a there's a lot of pressure to accumulate and we're living in an age where they're rich and increased with goods and brother says the deceitfulness in a Leo Dean age where we have to be on our toes more than there ever was in any age and it says the cares of this world the deceitfulness of riches why are they deceitful the riches are presented to us in a way that it satisfies but it's deceiving because it'll always leave us empty the house when it was found was empty no matter what it had been garnished with it left it in empty no matter how much it was accessorized and no matter how rich things were put into it and it could have all the instagrammable appeal inside of it but yet it was still empty because it was the deceitfulness and the vanity of riches the cares of this world the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things that phrase to me just kind of goes out and grabs everything else the lust of other things entering in choke the word and the word becomes unfruitful the of this world the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in these are three things that we transact in that sell our homes in Satan's Eden brother bam speaks about how that Satan by his gospel programs of knowledge better education higher ethics civilization and so forth has Bewitched the people that want to serve God into believing his lie I I I I I know the instinct is to think but I don't believe the Trinity I'm not out there in denominations and and there's this uh and I think it's it's worth noting that you're here it's worth noting that you've come out of Babylon it's worth noting that you H you have you're not believing the lies of a denominational system and baptizing in titles and a a and believing a lot of false Doctrine but Satan is still very cunning he's still very deceitful and if he's not going to get you out on religion and false Doctrine he'll try to get into your life to get you out on worldliness and if he doesn't get you out on the base things of drugs and alcohol sexual perversion there's still a lot of other ways that we're selling our minds and selling our times and becoming slaves to lust that's not always in the marijuana and the and the crack cocaines and the things that we think it might be Bewitched bewitching the people that want to serve God through his lies through his salesmanship am it's programs of knowledge and civilization he says in this great deceitful age he's ready to take his throne by his people he's built himself with an intellectual educated scientific Eden science scientific preacher scientific Church scientific theology everything is scientific everything is on the basis of knowledge we call it a veil of knowledge lust lust knowledge a a veil of knowledge and lust is what she had been veiled with or a knowledge for lust it was something that he had captured her with I want us to take to heart this as a microscope and examine our hearts listen if you're being challenged in some way to to let go of the teachings of the gospel and to water down the word of God when it says that you ought to live a certain way and if you're wrestling with whether or not it says you should be baptized in name of the Lord Jesus Christ by all means the devil's trying to sell you a bill of goods that is that are aive he's trying to pull your faith away from the the true word of God he's he's trying to work in programs and better education and higher ethics and a and more accepting and drawing the bigger Circle and things like that sure he still works in that so whether it be those things in other programs he works deceitfully on the basis of knowledge he works deceitfully trying to sell us wisdom understanding and knowledge in order to get us to transact for things that we can possess to make ourselves feel good and make ourselves feel important but we're losing out on the real important things in doing so in this postmodernist world that we live in this leodan age this postmodern atmosphere in the the the atmosphere of leod deia there's a Lust For worldly knowledge contrary to the word of God it is completely uh enamored with the knowledge the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and it's turned itself away from the way of the tree of life we wanted to present that in an image on Sunday that when man was kept from the way of the tree of life we're brought back to that in this hour to where we we can live now in this hour after the way the manner of Life the precepts the principles the knowledge the understanding of the tree of life and not just on the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I mentioned it on Sunday about this book it published in 2011 on Western Civilization uh and it was explaining how that Western Civilization being relatively young in in the light of human history how it was able to take over the world and and the the author admits he's using a kind of phrase to he says to get my kids attention and get young people's attention he called these things killer apps that the western civilization developed and it was competition science rule of law modern medicine consumerism and work ethic and he says we call him killer apps he said I'm just using guess he was in 2011 he was using it to be cool uh but he said basically they institutions or they use these killer apps to create a unique set of social institutions that all of Western Society became engrossed in and adopted ideas of competition science rule of law modern me medicine consumism and work ethic to where there's things that we do today in American society that were foreign to Eastern Society foreign to European countries foreign even to to western eastern civilizations and so we developed a certain killer apps a way of life and a way of consuming and a way of growing a way of working the modern medicine rule of law and they became social inst institutions that we all became invested in and so those social institutions motivated Society to accumulate great wealth and become very very strong to conquer the world but now the East has co-opted them and China is doing the very same thing using competition science rule of law modern medicine consumerism and work ethic to create institutions that we join that we become a part of and we work within their framework and we should ask ourselves I I I like just how succinct this gentleman put it in terms of competition science rule of law modern meth medicine consumerism and work ethic this describes civilization and I believe it's describing to us Satan's Eden in can't remember just I think when we were ministering on and you'll have to remind me because you remember it perfectly we ministered three or four years ago on wisdom resolves the complexities a a and this in this day and age we living in I was joking about you remembering it but I remember going through this in great detail and so I'm going to I'm going to mention that and bring it back up and connecting to Satan's Eden that Satan created a lust in the woman for knowledge and then with knowledge became a lust for an experience right first she lusted for knowledge but then her knowledge created a craving for to act on it and this L to see an economy that we're now in that Satan has built this to his perfect Eden Satan's Eden he's built it to his Perfection we're now living in an age that is dominated by this Commerce of knowledge that leads to experience the and that's the endgame in all this is experience when we had this this onslaught of this information age and we called it a digital age we called a computer age or an Information Age it was a shift from industrialization to data computerization so you have this industrial things are working but then things get more H uh more in terms of digital or informational and as we could go through these things just even the how the this Industrial Revolution brings on this uh the Industrial Revolution brought on the Industrial Age so when you see this Revolution and you see things being turned upside down then this is where there's a revolution it brings on an age and now the the the digital Revolution is brought on the information age and each one of these revolutions if it's a revolution it causes a revolt and it's been a revolt against God's word and Faith with each one there has been a rebellion against God's word there's been a letting go of faith and this is kind of how the sociol sociologists kind of look at this in terms of this revolution this data Revolution that's led us into an information age and now that we've had this age of information for a number of decades now the information is leading us to a place where we can make application for of what we've learned and this digital age is now it's left us somewhat empty where there's only so much that could take place industrialization led to an industrial age and then once we get into the information age it leads to this uh this uh informational Revolution digital Revolution leads to an information age but mankind is not happy just knowing he wants to experience and so now we've entered into an experience age where the way that they describe it is we're not just passively sharing information we're not just passively uh acquiring information but we're actively now trying to show experiences things have to be very visual there was a time when oh email and chat and oh man that was that was great if you could text and you could you could get into uh log on to perch and get into the Believers chat and start to H H uh text one another and those things and get to know one another I mean there's things that you could that I thought that was amazing but now it's got to be video right and things it's we're trying to share experiences and and things are visual and they're all meant to sensitize and engage and to get us to desire those experiences ourselves the phrase that I have that has stuck with me the age of telling is over it is the age of showing true and so in Satan's dialogue with the woman there was this moment in his sales sales pitch where he was selling her on the idea brother B says oh the idea the idea the idea but then he said talk is cheap enough's enough it's time to get down to business can can we seal the deal do you want to experience it do you want to not just know it but really know it and so we're living in a time with all the technology with all the the digital Revolution with everything that we have it's not just innocent interacting with the information it's just not the innocent accumulation of knowledge it has the effect of causing us to seek after experiences it's the same method of operation that the devil used in the beginning where he tells he tells he tells we exper we we get knowledge get knowledge we get knowledge then we begin to act upon that knowledge now I use that that portion to set this idea up and I'm not sure just how I'm going to be able to unpack this tonight you know as far as I'm concerned there's never a shortage of inspired things from the word of God to dig into and so the uh you I'm not just trying to find you know fill the blank space on a page so we can make it through a Wednesday night you know we weigh these things out in our hearts hoping that we're sharing something that's a benefit to you and I hope there's been um a spiritual continuity with the things we've shared to this point because I want to just I want to put this in here as a challenge to be very very practical with the these different revolutions that came on the Industrial Revolution bringing on the Industrial Age the digital Revolution bringing on the information age a and then now we get in this age of experience life has changed quite a bit Lifestyles and the concept even of Home has changed and evolved significantly I'm going to kind of pull back the curtain on something for just a moment then we'll get back into the scriptures we'll get back to Revelations 3 but throughout all time the concept of Home has always been less physical and more intangible we said that it's feelings it's a place it's a belonging you can't put your finger on it but it feels like home home sweet home those ideas it's not how sweet house it's uh it it's there's no place like home not necessarily no place like house and so the if home is where the heart is and there is even this idea that it's not necessarily a physical thing but it's there's something to it now what's remarkable then if home has always been somewhat intangible I want to talk about this I want to point to this technology and whether we're referring to the internet or The Internet of Things uh but technology has created a virtual space that impacts our pride our self-esteem and our identity there was a time when your actual zip code said something about maybe what you class you were of and the car you drove the clothes you wore and and things could be relegated to what side of town you lived on or where you were from and your identity was wrapped up your pride was in things you possessed but nowadays there's very virtual spaces that have just as much of an impact on a person's Pride their self-esteem their self-worth and even their identity as physical things if not more that there's a lot of people that have more stock in their digital footprint and their image online and worry more about that than the reality of their natural lives that they're more interested in putting on a front that they're healthy more interest putting on a front that they're wealthy than they are about really looking after their health in gaining wealth because they have more there's more at risk in their minds there's more to gain in the pretense of the internet and so what's happened is this virtual space that is not even tangible this digital world that's been created this digital economy has invaded our domestic lives that life could have been described at one point a as home and house and who you marry and your children and what you ate and what you wore and the cars you drove and and there was some Rhythm to life where if the children the husband went out into the field with the sons and work they came back home where the women had remained that day and cooked and cleaned and there was just this this sphere of dwelling things that are tangible and things you could look out after and things that you could make improvements on and things you took pride and and things that had value and worth I hope that you could kind of fellowship with me just in that creating that picture very quickly but now there's an unseen image there's a second life there's an avatar there's an identity there's a Persona where these things are kind of out there and we're we're presenting ourselves a certain way and and we're worried about how people perceive us and we and we want to be looked at and belong and we exist in Realms May some of you might actually have a handle and some sort of forum or some sort of hobby or some sort of group and you have your own identity there they have no idea what you look like they have no idea who you are but you have some sense of belonging and worth in this Niche Digital World you identify with link or whatever it is you guys know what I'm talking about or Super Mario or Master Chief what I try to think of things I don't I don't know I'll play more video games but we identify and they become it's invaded our lives and this is a statement that I read that just overwhelmed me it was in a study it said as if there wasn't already enough going on under the surface in each home from age to Identity to gender politics other there's age politics identity politics gender politics politics politics politics this Network Technology brings the influences of these other stakeholders be careful what words you use but these influences of other stakeholders to bear on how we engage with the people with whom we share our most intimate lives may not sound like English so let me just try to figure out a way to say this our digital connections our lives beyond this the tangible our internet existence our gaming existence our the chat groups the forums everything that exists in that social media world that this being connected to things beyond our families and beyond our homes and our real living it brings the influences of the stakeholders and the individuals and those who have equity in all these other Realms to influence how we interact and engage and perceive the people that we love the most and the people that are closest to us physically and whom we actually share physical space with and sleep under the same roofs together with that the opinions and attitud of people in the world that we've never met we have a joke in our family when something says somebody wow we read this we read that and it's like is that Nancy in Tennessee right because just some random Tweeter and some exer in Tennessee is dropping knowledge and pining on stuff well that was the worst decision ever made and this happens and that happens and we just spout it off as if it's gospel and it's just Nancy and Tennessee God bless Nancy in Tennessee but we're more in tune to the opinions of Nancy in Tennessee we're more in tune to what These Guys these people will never meet people we can would never really know what they say and what they do oh did you see so and so is now cleaning their home with this did you see this influencer we're baking more recipes by Mormons and and whatever else and sewing clothes that the uh uh the Jehovah Witness make then we are in tune to the people around us who got really good ideas sor But continuing it says this network of digital things allows these other things of the world influence us and our perceptions and our interactions with those that we share our most intimate lives and we are now in the process of negotiating new boundaries with our time our attentions and our domestic order they say hierarchies but domestic order our domestic rankings our hierarchy of what we value you because of this other world that now exist and I I'm saying this because the concept of Home has changed to where now we don't we have exchanged something about home life for a digital world in this digital Revolution that we now need to experience and accumulate in that there there's been this exchange where home was very simplistic but now home isn't even what it used to be because now we're being influenced by all these outward things and we're having to negotiate new boundaries new boundaries with our time our attention and domestic order and responsibilities I mean does it does it strike something in you does it make sense what maybe the devil's trying to do I'm looking for eye contact and something does it make sense how there's been a shift in some of these things where before it's really simple man we need to straighten our home up and and it meant something but now there's such a flood of the world we've had to negotiate new boundaries and they say well what does this mean they use a phrase in this writing called home Multiplicity how that the rooms that we used to have for a specific purpose they were used for a specific use the bedroom was a place that you slept and kept personal possessions the kitchen was a place where you ate together a the the dining room table is a place that you ate together as a family that these rooms that had specific use and purposes have now been co-opted by other digital things other digital task used to be that you would maybe sleep in your room and that's where you kept your clothes but you can sleep in your room work in your room eat in your room never leave your room the kitchen table is a place where the family made meals but now it's a place where you do homeschool you do work right and you eat yeah I mean I'm not I'm not preaching against it beards on the other hand got a real problem with those things but I'm just saying just think just think realistically about our home life and how that life there there's not a there's not a wall anymore there's not divisions we don't get distance from certain things and and and and we know the specific things that something was used for this is the place where we do this this is the place where we do that our hes growing up we had a for some of us and the testimonies I've heard from others they had a room where that's where they listened to the message together and that's where they prayed together as a family but now we could carry the world with us everywhere we go and we can watch sports here we can do work here we can do all sorts of things everywhere and it's called This Home multiplicity to where what the way I saw in my mind is we've just divided up the home right the intangible idea of home and we sell it to all these different spheres because there's no sacredness anymore and the phrase they use this is a direct statement each online activity has imposed itself on our home practice we're experiencing a domestic transition and it says it complicates characteristics of the physical space just just leaning into that idea that the concept of Home has changed that when we changed the home in a in a spiritual sense it's it it's come to Bear even on what our houses are like in this home multiplicity our homes aren't sanctuaries anymore they're not a place of respite from the world but these Network Technologies have invaded our domestic space and each online activity is imposing itself on our home lives where you're going to need an internet connection for your toaster right there's certain things you buy now that are connected and if you don't use the the the designer brand replacement it tells you know it tells the company shut that thing off don't let it work was thinking today is that we had some problems here at the church with the air conditioner and brothers we're working hard to get it working I remember one time at a church I went to before it was 7 6:30 7:00 at night at the church and also the power went off like what happened the power went off and so I got a hold of somebody and I said hey our power is off called the secretary treasur and said the power is off and he's like oh no I haven't been paying the electric bill like well you better pay the electric Bill we're not going to be able to have church tonight so he called the power company made a payment and they turned the power back on never even visited the church so there's this connectedness with all things that can control and manipulate and we have all these tentacles of the world in our lives and it's complicating life to a high degree I I I'll I'm going to skip um quite a bit here and and maybe push it over to Sunday I think it'll work just well there I hope it does but as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of Noah Jesus said even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed in that very picture of eating drinking planting building buying selling marrying all that and the judgments that followed it says the son of man's going to be revealed that in the midst of an age of experience in the midst of an age that's so caught up in the cycle of life and all the things of life that there is God is going to unveil himself and there's going to be a glimpse of the original Eden and there's going to be a revelation given to the people of God that stands in stark contrast to the attitudes of mindsets of the people the Bible says and by knowledge shall all of its Chambers be filled with precious and pleasant riches where there is Vision divine revelation there is true happiness there is where there is vision and Revelation where the revealing of the son of man is that's a Lifeline to be built up where the word of God is there's Health in my bones where the word of God is there's there's health for my house where the word of God is where the word of God can be lifted up that's substance I can live by that I don't have to be consumed with all the getting of the world with all my getting get wisdom and understanding that these are things that I can live by I can live by the word of God and not have to worry about bread I can live by the word of God and not have to worry about clothing I can live by the word of God and not have to worry about a house because these things are greater brother Bram and Satan's Eden says this is a great time everybody's got money everybody can do this and everybody can do that money flowing every way and big cars and everything and he says there won't be one of them in that City there won't be one car one airplane no brother John will say I I was a pilot like P pilot what your body no it'll be altogether a different civilization it'll be again a civilization not of knowledge not of science but of innocence and faith in the Living God not a civilization of competition science rule of law modern medicine consumerism and work ethic think how those broad headings can cover so much in our daily lives of what institutions we've subscribed to and the side hustles we have the accumulation of wealth and the consuming and the rule of law and modern medicine science and competition all these things that just have a way of overwhelming us and tearing us down in Awareness town he says that's this civilization but there's a civilization we're going to of innocence and faith in the Living God and he says let us strive to enter into that I say not one day but right now where the son of man is being revealed where the where the word is being unfolded that's where I want to gather let us strive to enter that he said for that's my whole purpose is to enter into that City someday and just look back coming along with me see every one of you marching when we sing The Saints Go Marching In I want to be in that number When the Saints Go Marching In amen there won't be one of these won't be competition won't be science rule of law modern medicine consumerism and work ethic it'll be a faith civil Faith civilization faith in the word of God close with this in Psalm 17:14 then we'll read verse 15 he says for men which are are thy hand oh Lord keep me from Men of the world which their portion in this life men of this world and children of this world who in their generation are fit for this world whose eyes are only on this world who accumulate great things in this world and appear very wealthy and have they're Wealthy by their parents because they can eat well they're Wealthy by the number of children they have and they'll be able to leave all these great things to their children whose belly you fill with hidden treasure full of children leave the rest of their substance to their babes then he says as for me as for me as for you I trust tonight I will Behold thy face in righteousness while they're getting everything they can in the world while they're engaging in these transactions while they're worried about filling their bellies and leaving uh wealth to their children I will Behold thy face in righteousness amen I shall be satisfied amen when when's it going to be S when I awake with thy likeness now that's a mouthful I'm going to behold your face and my satisfaction is be when I grow into your image and by Revelation by Revelation by knowledge wisdom and understanding I grow into your image I grow up into the head in all things I'm not going to be satisfied if I get a better job alone I'm not going to be satisfied if I'm able to buy a better car I'm not going to be satisfied if I get a better house I'm not going to be satisfied if I can lose a bunch of weight and look good I'm not going to be satisfied with those things my satisfaction is going to come from beholding your face and growing into your likeness that's what's going to make me feel better about myself that's what's going to make me get out of bed in the morning that's going to be my motor that's going to be my driving Factor oh God help us we'll ask the musicians to come to their instruments brother brandom says this in the Statue of a perfect man he says Lust For money lust for big things lust for pro popularity these things are dead to the believer why are we messing around with dead things why are we trying to give life to dead things there lust for money lust for big things if you're Lust For popularity if it's bothering you you reminded that it's dead we don't care a ten a cottage why should I care live or die sink or drowned this is the one thing that I'm interested in you listening the kingdom of God this is the one thing that I'm interested in the kingdom of God he says whether I maintain my home whether I maintain my family whether I maintain whatever it is let me maintain Christ puts it all in perspective I'll read it to you or maybe on Sunday where brother Bam's describing this age and he says that the counil of God is very tur and he directs the Church of the last day to one hope the hope is himself Christ Alone is Our Hope in this world Christ Alone is Our Hope in this age that we're living in Christ alone is the answer to all the pressures of Leo deia the answer to the lust of money he's the answer to the lust for big things he's the answer to the Lust For popularity we don't need to worry about maintaining our home maintaining our family whe maintaining whatever it is if we don't maintain Christ he says let me maintain Christ the hope of glory Build Me Up Oh Lord into this let Christ be my [Music] head I believe we should say in our hearts I left a lot out so I hope this doesn't ring real Hollow these things are not negotiable there should be some things in our lives that are not negotiable there should be certain things in our lives that say nope you can take that but you can't take this you can have that but you can't have this there ought to be at a knowledge of of the word of God and a discernment to know these are things that are not for sale you can take the house but don't take my home you can take this and you can take that but these things are not negotiable I have this dedication ah my home is not for sale I will not sell my home I will not sell the word I will not sell these kind of gatherings I will not sell the atmosphere that God wants me to create in my home I won't trade any of it for what the world has to offer because that's for me I'll Behold thy face in righteousness I'll seek it above all else in this day and age when immorality is on the Move dishonesty is rampant we're daily making transactions to sell our homes I think there's things we need to hold tight together more than ever before and let me maintain Christ he is not negotiable he is not negotiable amen let's stand
