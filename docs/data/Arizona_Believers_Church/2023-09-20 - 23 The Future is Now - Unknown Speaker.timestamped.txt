[0:00] I'm going to title the service tonight
[0:02] the future is now
[0:04] and I believe I've alluded to this a
[0:06] little bit
[0:07] um previously and in looking at this to
[0:11] say that the future is now I go I guess
[0:12] that I'm sure that you recognize maybe
[0:14] there's a little bit of a paradox in
[0:16] those terms but there's just something I
[0:18] really want to emphasize and I felt
[0:20] impressed to minister on this tonight
[0:21] just to give some context to some of the
[0:24] specific things that we've been
[0:25] ministering on in Kingdom identity and
[0:28] even last Wednesday night on Kingdom
[0:30] worthy a lot of specific things that
[0:32] were expressed from is your life worthy
[0:34] of the Gospel a lot of things alluded to
[0:36] in our relationships to one another
[0:37] especially in our marriages and our home
[0:39] home life and our families and I just
[0:42] thought that this would be a way of just
[0:44] kind of giving some more support and
[0:46] backbone to those things as they may be
[0:48] very specific and precise in our daily
[0:51] lives I'm hoping this kind of encourages
[0:52] us a little bit to see why those things
[0:54] matter so much now in Luke chapter 14 as
[0:59] Jesus is alluding to a feast and
[1:01] inviting ones to a supper and then he
[1:03] begins to talk about a man who made a
[1:05] great supper and paid many it kind of
[1:07] hearkens back to what he was saying here
[1:09] in verses 12 and 13. and as he says
[1:12] you'll be recompensed in the
[1:14] resurrection of the just to a Jew that
[1:17] was a time of the messiah's Kingdom on
[1:20] Earth the restoration of the Kingdom to
[1:22] Israel and it would be there would be a
[1:24] resurrection of all those faithful just
[1:26] Jews that believed and when the in verse
[1:30] 15 this person says and when one of them
[1:32] that sat at meat with them heard these
[1:34] things he said unto him blessed is he
[1:36] that shall eat bread in the kingdom of
[1:38] God and we were drawing from this last
[1:41] week from is your life worthy of the
[1:42] Gospel how that many excuses were made
[1:44] when the invitation to that Kingdom
[1:47] would come and the Paradox of this is
[1:49] the man says this to the Messiah the
[1:52] very one who would denote that Kingdom
[1:54] the kingdom of God and the one that says
[1:56] that all blessed is he who will sit down
[1:58] in the kingdom of God and here's Christ
[2:00] who is the very image of that and we
[2:03] could say that the Messiah at that very
[2:06] moment was sitting down eating bread
[2:08] with them and feasting with them and a
[2:11] kingdom opportunity was being presented
[2:13] and it was being missed it was already
[2:15] there manifesting itself in some way you
[2:19] know in Matthew chapter 4 verse 17 it
[2:21] says from that time Jesus began to
[2:24] preach and to say repent
[2:26] for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[2:29] this is something being manifested to
[2:33] Israel at that time and though it's not
[2:36] the full fulfillment of it or the
[2:37] perfect realization of the of the some
[2:39] of the prophecies in the Old Testament
[2:41] and some of the Kingdom elements that
[2:43] they were looking forward to uh the
[2:45] there was a manifestation of the Kingdom
[2:47] the kingdom of God is at hand and the
[2:49] Jews are missing it and The Parables as
[2:51] we said before in Luke chapter 14 we're
[2:53] addressing their misconceptions about
[2:55] the kingdom uh we even went into detail
[2:58] how that when the kingdom would be the
[3:01] invitation would be given to them they
[3:02] would despise it they would belittle it
[3:04] they wouldn't even recognize what it
[3:05] means
[3:06] and Christ when he comes preaching that
[3:09] the kingdom of God is at hand he's
[3:12] manifesting things that show what Adam
[3:14] lost was being restored back to mankind
[3:16] the the signs and wonders in his life
[3:19] were showing this is Supernatural this
[3:21] is above natural this is not just
[3:23] something that in who one in Adam's race
[3:26] can accomplish
[3:27] and the Jews and a lot of this is
[3:29] reviewed tonight the Jews believed that
[3:31] there would be a kingdom established on
[3:34] Earth they weren't looking for a kingdom
[3:37] in the heavens they were looking for
[3:39] heaven to be established on Earth and
[3:41] that there would be a future Kingdom
[3:43] this was always kind of in their thought
[3:44] process and even in Acts chapter 1 verse
[3:48] 6 when Jesus is appearing amongst them
[3:50] after his resurrection when they came
[3:52] together they asked him saying Lord will
[3:54] thou at this time restore again the
[3:56] kingdom to Israel
[3:58] so this is something really at the heart
[4:00] to a Jew there was an eagerness to see
[4:01] the kingdom established on Earth and I
[4:04] want that to be again I want to remind
[4:06] you of that that to a Jew it wasn't a
[4:09] matter of leaving the Earth and going to
[4:11] heaven but they believed in a kingdom on
[4:14] Earth
[4:15] and though they believed in that and
[4:17] they're looking for it there was a
[4:18] misunderstanding of what the kingdom
[4:21] looked like because it had been
[4:22] presently manifested to them and there
[4:25] was an element with respect to times and
[4:27] Seasons to where they they didn't know
[4:30] how that Kingdom would come into
[4:32] manifestation
[4:33] John chapter 18 verses 35 and 36 when
[4:37] he's standing before Pilate at Christ is
[4:40] being examined and pilate answers says
[4:42] am I a Jew thine own nation and the
[4:44] chief of priest have delivered thee unto
[4:46] me what hast thou done now in terms of
[4:50] asking are you are you the Messiah are
[4:52] you a king and they're trying to trying
[4:54] to figure out who he is and does he
[4:56] belong to Israel is this their King is
[4:58] this their leader and pilate's objection
[5:01] is your own people your own nation that
[5:03] you're supposedly this king of has
[5:06] delivered you unto me uh what have you
[5:09] done and catch how Jesus answers this
[5:11] and this is very direct Jesus answered
[5:14] my kingdom is not of this world
[5:17] if my kingdom were of this world then
[5:20] would my servants fight that I should
[5:23] not be delivered to the Jews but now is
[5:25] my kingdom not from hence
[5:28] now Jesus is using this emphasis in this
[5:30] repetition of my kingdom my kingdom my
[5:33] kingdom and my servants and he says my
[5:36] kingdom is not of this world if my
[5:39] kingdom was of this world then my
[5:42] servants who hear my voice and and know
[5:45] who I am they would fight for me and
[5:47] they would fight against those that have
[5:49] taken me captive they would fight this
[5:51] proceeding
[5:52] and what Jesus is saying he says my
[5:54] kingdom is not from hence this kingdom
[5:56] is not political
[5:57] it was not natural it wasn't too resist
[6:00] pilate it wasn't even to resist the
[6:02] things that were transpiring in that
[6:04] realm at that time it's not supported by
[6:06] uh or perpetuated or kept going by
[6:09] worldly principles uh scribes and
[6:12] Pharisees and those of the nation have
[6:14] delivered me to be crucified but that's
[6:16] not where my kingdom fights it's not a
[6:18] natural battle they don't need to come
[6:19] and defend me in these Halls they don't
[6:21] need to go out and hire the best
[6:22] attorney they don't need to try to kick
[6:24] down the door and come in and steal me
[6:26] away in the night and rescue me as a as
[6:28] a hostage from you he said my kingdom is
[6:31] not a part of these elements it's not a
[6:33] part of these worldly kingdoms and these
[6:35] worldly proceedings if they if it was
[6:37] then you would see the kingdom
[6:38] manifested in those ways
[6:41] and many Jews as I already said already
[6:44] they believed in a future Kingdom but
[6:46] were missing the present manifestation
[6:49] and now to kind of turn it to our
[6:51] mindset Christian theology has created a
[6:53] separation between the kingdom and the
[6:57] Earth
[6:58] that this element of time and where we
[7:01] exist now in these Dimensions we know it
[7:03] is a Proving Ground but it's set up as
[7:06] if it's only temporary and while we're
[7:08] here we're to make a decision to serve
[7:10] God because if we don't serve God then
[7:12] we're going to go to either we're going
[7:14] to go to the bad place and Christian
[7:16] Theology and I would say Catholicism has
[7:18] divided the future between an eternal
[7:20] hell and an eternal heaven
[7:23] so if we do that then we kind of
[7:25] relegate what we do now on Earth as
[7:27] being a place where you make your
[7:28] decision and just hope you don't change
[7:29] your mind before you die and this is a
[7:32] really heavy emphasis in Catholicism
[7:34] because you got to make the right choice
[7:35] because the soul is eternal and if you
[7:37] haven't made the right choice your soul
[7:39] will live forever in Hell or your soul
[7:41] if you made the right choice will live
[7:43] forever in heaven and it creates that
[7:45] divide where now the Earth is kind of in
[7:47] limbo in one day it's going to be
[7:49] completely destroyed and all that exists
[7:51] is hell in heaven so you better make
[7:52] sure you're on the right side
[7:55] and Beyond the error in the doctrine of
[7:57] an eternal hell
[7:59] and the complete you know and they
[8:02] believe the annihilation of the earth
[8:03] there's a practical impact that that
[8:06] kind of mindset has on life presently
[8:09] and we have to be careful because we can
[8:11] have the attitude of well one day
[8:13] one day and one day this is going to
[8:16] happen and one day this will be and we
[8:18] know there's certain promises to in the
[8:19] life to come but we can take those very
[8:22] promises and then they become kind of
[8:23] this elusive future where if you look at
[8:26] the Jews and they they've received they
[8:29] should have received the very prophecies
[8:31] that were made to them but yet now they
[8:33] still long for the days of the Messiah
[8:34] when it's come and gone
[8:36] and we can be guilty of the same thing
[8:38] where we just put so many promises off
[8:40] into the future so many different
[8:42] manifestations off into the future and
[8:43] it's kind of like just one day one day
[8:45] we're gonna get there one day we're
[8:47] gonna have this and we fail to embrace
[8:50] the promises of God right now and fail
[8:53] to embrace all the opportunities and
[8:55] power of the Kingdom as it's made
[8:57] available to Believers right now
[9:00] and that's why I take this title the
[9:02] future is now
[9:04] we do believe that one day the the
[9:06] kingdom is going to be established on
[9:08] Earth it's going to be a millennial
[9:10] Reign on Earth and we know there's going
[9:12] to be a temper there's going to be
[9:13] another complete renovation of the Earth
[9:15] in its atmospheres and there's going to
[9:17] be a New Jerusalem that comes on the
[9:19] earth and the City of God is going to be
[9:21] established and there's going to be a
[9:22] city there's going to be those that rule
[9:24] in rain and there's going to be a great
[9:25] Eighth Day so we have a millennial rain
[9:27] we have the Eternal rain but right now
[9:30] there's a spiritual Kingdom in effect
[9:33] with a power over all worldly kingdoms
[9:37] now as we read already in Revelations
[9:39] chapter 1 how he has may have made us
[9:41] Kings and Priests and I want that to be
[9:43] kind of the focal point for tonight I
[9:45] want to catch in verse 4 Revelations
[9:47] chapter one
[9:49] verses four to six we'll read a few
[9:51] things in before we get to verse 6.
[9:54] I catch this background and we're going
[9:56] to draw from places where brother
[9:57] Branham adds
[9:58] um some scriptures to this and he says
[10:00] John to the seven churches which are in
[10:02] Asia Grace be unto you and peace from
[10:05] him which is and which was and which is
[10:07] to come and from the seven spirits which
[10:09] are before his throne and from Jesus
[10:11] Christ I hope you're reading that and
[10:13] see just how he's broke that up who is
[10:15] the faithful witness and the first
[10:16] begotten of the dead and the prince of
[10:19] the kings of the earth unto him that
[10:22] loved us and washed us from our sins in
[10:25] his own blood now I'm wanting to give
[10:27] you some background before we get to
[10:28] verse six where he says he hath made us
[10:30] Kings and Priests and this is this is
[10:32] all describing uh what God has done for
[10:36] us and the role of Christ in this he
[10:38] loves us and he's washed us from our own
[10:40] sins and his own blood and brother Brad
[10:42] I'm looking at this scripture says
[10:44] consider this since it is the blood of
[10:46] God it is perfect blood now again my
[10:49] title of the night is the future is now
[10:51] so things that have been speaking of
[10:54] things that will be and yet I don't want
[10:57] us to look into the past and let's look
[10:58] into the future let's see how it applies
[11:00] now
[11:01] and he says consider this since it is
[11:04] the blood of God it is perfect blood
[11:06] and if the perfect blood is loosing us
[11:09] from the power in bondage and defilement
[11:12] of sin then the loosing is perfect and
[11:15] complete
[11:17] now let's recognize this that the
[11:20] perfect blood has loosed us from the
[11:22] power and bondage and defilement power
[11:25] bondage and defilement of sin therefore
[11:28] you're losing is perfect and complete
[11:33] and he says there is now therefore no
[11:36] condemnation
[11:37] and in Romans chapter 8 verses 31 to 34
[11:41] which is where kind of pointing to that
[11:43] chapter that there is thou therefore now
[11:45] no condemnation notice how Paul says
[11:47] this what shall we then say to these
[11:49] things if God before us who can be
[11:52] against us
[11:53] you should chew on that a little bit and
[11:56] this is something I don't want you to
[11:57] get so lost in thought you don't hear
[11:58] another word I say but maybe just make a
[12:00] note of it I want to go I want to
[12:02] meditate on that as I go to bed tonight
[12:04] if God before us who can be against us
[12:09] and this is a quite a question to get
[12:11] you to begin to think about well I mean
[12:13] that's a good point if God is for me if
[12:15] God is on my side if the perfect blood
[12:18] of God has loosed me from the power
[12:19] bondage and defilement of sin and that
[12:22] loose in his perfect and complete then
[12:24] who can come against me
[12:27] he says he's he that spared not his own
[12:29] son but delivered him up for us all how
[12:31] shall he not with him also freely give
[12:34] us all things
[12:36] I love Paul just laying in these
[12:39] questions one after another who shall
[12:40] lay anything to the charge of God's
[12:42] elect
[12:43] it is God that justifieth who is he that
[12:47] condemneth it is Christ that died yet
[12:50] rather that has risen again who is even
[12:52] at the right hand of God who also maketh
[12:55] intercession for us
[12:57] this is these are words of encouragement
[12:59] saying well who can condemn you
[13:02] Christ died the Messiah has died he's
[13:04] give it shed his own blood now he's been
[13:06] raised up to a place of power at the
[13:08] right hand of God he's interceding for
[13:10] you who can lay any charge against you
[13:12] if God before you who can be against you
[13:15] and as if he's anticipating may be
[13:17] objective well um you know well so and
[13:19] so he says well there's Christ then who
[13:21] intercedes for us and there's none that
[13:23] can lay any charge to you and there's
[13:25] none that can condemn you
[13:27] and he opens that chapter in verse 1
[13:29] Romans 8 there is therefore now no
[13:32] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[13:34] Jesus
[13:35] I like how he kind of qualifies this who
[13:38] walked not after the flesh but after the
[13:40] spirit
[13:41] this is a promise or maybe more of a
[13:44] threat I'm not a threat I mean it's at
[13:46] least clarifying you want to walk after
[13:48] the flesh you're going to feel condemned
[13:50] and it's not God that condemns you you
[13:52] condemn yourself
[13:54] there is now no condemnation to them
[13:56] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[13:57] after the flesh but after the spirit
[13:59] that is that is to say that those of us
[14:02] who those who are born again that's the
[14:05] rule follow the spirit be led to the
[14:07] spirit
[14:08] he says for the law of the spirit of
[14:10] life in Christ Jesus hath made us free
[14:13] from the law of sin and death
[14:17] there is therefore now no condemnation
[14:19] the blood of Jesus Christ has washed us
[14:22] from all sins unto him that loved us and
[14:25] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[14:26] we have been set free
[14:30] so it continues in the church age book
[14:32] there it is his death gave us the blood
[14:35] the blood has loosed us there is now no
[14:40] condemnation this is right now
[14:42] How can there be there's nothing to be
[14:46] condemned for because the blood has
[14:49] loosed us from sin we are free Guiltless
[14:54] he says don't listen to man listen to
[14:56] the word
[14:58] you are loosed by the blood
[15:02] now don't get tied down again by
[15:04] traditions and Creeds and organizations
[15:06] let's hear this for ourselves
[15:08] he says don't be led astray by listening
[15:11] to those that deny the power of the word
[15:14] and deny that Jesus saves Hills fills
[15:18] with the Holy Ghost in power
[15:21] don't don't be tied down by that don't
[15:24] be led astray by anyone that would want
[15:26] to want to water down the power of the
[15:28] word of God water down the promises of
[15:30] God put it in some other age and
[15:31] sometime past he says you are God's free
[15:35] men loosed by his blood
[15:38] if you still hold your faith to Creeds
[15:40] and denominations it is certain by the
[15:43] evidence that you have lost your faith
[15:45] in the word
[15:47] got to be loosed from all creeds
[15:49] and this is Brother Branham amplifying
[15:52] this very scripture to him that loved us
[15:55] and washed us from our sins in his own
[15:56] blood
[15:57] we are free from condemnation we are
[16:00] free from
[16:01] uh from guilt
[16:03] and this leucine he says it's perfect
[16:06] and complete
[16:08] and brother Brown Builds on this
[16:10] to come to verse six where it says in
[16:12] Revelations one
[16:13] and a hath made us him that loved us
[16:16] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[16:19] and hath made us
[16:22] Kings and Priests
[16:24] unto God and his father
[16:27] to him be glory and Dominion forever and
[16:29] ever amen
[16:31] now let's think of this doxa this Glory
[16:33] this character and this Dominion to him
[16:36] be glory and Dominion forever and ever
[16:38] and I want you to see how brother
[16:39] Branham kind of even picks that up and
[16:41] gives it some some flesh
[16:43] he he writes this he half made us now
[16:46] he's quoting Revelations 1 6. he hath
[16:49] made us
[16:51] he goes oh there are certain truths we
[16:53] need to emphasize this is one of them
[16:57] in a time when
[16:59] people have platforms to highlight
[17:02] emphasize and repeat the things that
[17:04] they want to repeat and I'm just
[17:06] referring to all sorts of things whether
[17:07] it be dietary habits or exercise habits
[17:10] there's certain emphasis repeated
[17:11] emphasis and a lot of highlighting to
[17:13] certain things and I believe as as
[17:16] Believers we ought to know the things
[17:18] that God has highlighted the the kind of
[17:20] the evolution of the message the
[17:22] progressive revelation and the message
[17:23] and what brother Brandon began to
[17:25] highlight and want us to really hold too
[17:27] and hold dear to our hearts in the open
[17:29] of the word and he says this is a truth
[17:31] we need to emphasize he says this is one
[17:34] that needs to be emphasized he says he
[17:39] and that's a point of emphasis he hath
[17:41] made us
[17:43] and and given his emphasis salvation is
[17:46] his doing salvation is of the Lord all
[17:49] of Grace
[17:51] and he says he redeemed us for a purpose
[17:53] he bought us for a purpose
[17:57] this is where he comes to this we are
[17:59] Kings spiritual Kings
[18:01] so this loosing or by his blood this
[18:04] cleansing this perfect and complete
[18:06] losing was for a purpose
[18:10] not so that there could be some oh
[18:12] you're loosed and you're forgiven and
[18:13] you're Justified sorry he's taken care
[18:15] of and one day this Earth is going to be
[18:16] destroyed and that soul is going to live
[18:18] forever in heaven that that's not the
[18:20] sum and substance of it all
[18:22] he says that he has done it for a
[18:23] purpose he redeemed us for a purpose he
[18:25] bought us for a purpose we are his King
[18:28] spiritual Kings he says oh we are going
[18:31] to be Kings upon the Earth with him when
[18:34] he sits on his throne
[18:35] now we could either look forward to a
[18:38] the reign of the king king of David the
[18:40] son of David in the millennium or we
[18:43] could look forward to that time in the
[18:44] Eighth Day in eternity as we see both of
[18:47] those images presented in the future
[18:48] home and we can say one day he will and
[18:51] we can see some future promise but he
[18:52] says but now
[18:55] We Are Spiritual Kings and we Reign Over
[18:57] a spiritual Kingdom
[18:59] this deviates from a lot of Christian
[19:01] theology that solely looks at the
[19:03] Kingdom as something that will come into
[19:05] manifestation at a future date at a
[19:07] later date after the resurrection but
[19:09] now brother Brahms one is to recognize
[19:10] there is a spiritual Kingdom now where
[19:13] you are spiritual Kings and you Reign
[19:16] right now over a spiritual Kingdom in
[19:20] Colossians chapter 1 verses 13 and 14
[19:22] who have delivered us from the power of
[19:24] Darkness their Satan's kingdom and have
[19:27] translated us into the kingdom of his
[19:30] dear son or the reign of his dear son
[19:32] the Dominion of his dear son and whom we
[19:35] have Redemption through his blood even
[19:38] the Forgiveness of sins
[19:40] this is how brother Branham is working
[19:42] into this Kingdom Reign he says we have
[19:44] Redemption through his blood that blood
[19:45] is a perfect blood that blood has
[19:47] completely and perfectly loosed you and
[19:49] therefore having been completely loosed
[19:51] by the blood we are Justified we are
[19:53] forgiven being justified and forgiven we
[19:56] can occupy this a unique Place upon
[19:58] Earth as being redeemed Sons and
[20:00] Daughters of God with a spiritual Reign
[20:02] on Earth right now
[20:05] in Romans chapter 5 verses 16 to 21 kind
[20:09] of highlighting this idea of a rain
[20:10] right now translated into the kingdom
[20:13] reign of his dear son that's present
[20:15] tense
[20:16] Paul doesn't say and one day you'll be
[20:18] translated out of this earth into into
[20:19] heaven he's saying no right now we've
[20:22] been translated into the kingdom reign
[20:23] of his dear son
[20:25] Romans chapter 5 verses 16 to 21 and not
[20:27] as it was by one that sinned
[20:30] so is the gift
[20:31] for the Judgment was by one to
[20:33] condemnation and there is now no
[20:36] condemnation as it comes to Romans 8 but
[20:38] the free gift is of many offenses unto
[20:40] justification
[20:42] for by one man's offense death reigned
[20:45] by one so uh as we have been delivered
[20:48] from the power of Darkness that's an
[20:50] element of the worldly kingdoms now he
[20:52] is looking at death reigning by one by
[20:54] one man's sin through Adam death enters
[20:56] into human race not as mankind lost his
[21:00] position with God and His Fellowship in
[21:02] relationship to God through one man's
[21:03] Disobedience much more they which
[21:05] receive abundance of Grace and of the
[21:09] gift of righteousness shall reign in
[21:11] life by one
[21:14] they which receive abundance of grace
[21:16] and the gift of righteousness shall
[21:18] reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[21:21] this is a different rain this is the
[21:23] reign of death death reigned by one and
[21:25] now there's going to be a reigning in
[21:27] life through a gift of righteousness
[21:29] receive the abundance of Grace by Jesus
[21:31] Christ therefore is by the one offense
[21:34] of one judgment Came Upon all men to
[21:35] condemnation even so the righteousness
[21:37] of one the free gift came upon all men
[21:39] unto justification of life
[21:42] for as by one man's Disobedience were
[21:44] many made sinners
[21:46] so by The Obedience of one shall many be
[21:48] made righteous moreover the law entered
[21:51] that the offense might abound but where
[21:53] sin abounded Grace did much more bound
[21:55] that his sin hath reigned unto death now
[21:58] listen as Sin hath reigned unto death
[22:02] even so might grace Reign through
[22:05] righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus
[22:09] Christ Our Lord
[22:10] and we we do not want to make the
[22:12] mistake and say oh one day one day I've
[22:16] been thinking about it just over and
[22:18] over and over again it's been turned
[22:19] into my heart how brother Branham said
[22:21] as a young boy there was a spirit that
[22:23] hovered over him saying wait a little
[22:25] while longer
[22:27] and and here he is recognizing
[22:29] acknowledging that there's a spirit that
[22:31] says just wait just wait a little while
[22:32] longer and this was with speaking to a
[22:35] young man who ought to surrender his
[22:37] heart to God who ought to give his all
[22:39] to the Lord and who cares what
[22:41] opportunities you're going to pass up in
[22:42] this world whether it be a scholarships
[22:45] or whether it be job opportunities or
[22:46] travel opportunities or relationships or
[22:48] accomplishments why would you let that
[22:51] uh keep you from yielding to him say oh
[22:54] well I don't want to miss out I I don't
[22:56] want to miss out on this I don't want to
[22:57] miss out on that and he said the devil
[22:59] got around your spirit hovered over me
[23:01] and said wait a little while longer and
[23:03] that's the that's the same Spirit though
[23:05] it might not keep you from salvation
[23:07] that same spirit will just say oh it's
[23:09] off in the future one day one day one
[23:11] day as if there's going to be some trip
[23:13] to a Mecca that's going to satisfy it
[23:15] for you when right now the promise is
[23:18] here today is the day of salvation
[23:22] and Grace can Reign through
[23:24] righteousness under eternal life by
[23:26] Jesus Christ Our Lord
[23:28] so brother Branham says right now we
[23:32] reign with Christ
[23:35] now let me just quiz you when when do we
[23:38] reign with Christ how many says that
[23:40] that's that we do not Reign right now
[23:41] show of hands
[23:43] okay you're listening
[23:45] it's always funny when you do that and
[23:47] someone's been asleep and they just get
[23:49] the idea that they need to raise their
[23:50] hand
[23:51] everybody's awake tonight
[23:53] right now we reign with Christ
[23:56] right now
[23:58] so if there's going to be a future rain
[24:00] and so well one day we're gonna brother
[24:02] bam said oh there's going we are going
[24:04] to be Kings upon the Earth with him when
[24:05] he sits on his throne one day in the
[24:07] eighth day one day in the in that
[24:09] Millennium one day we will be but right
[24:11] now
[24:12] so from the future you're going to reign
[24:14] with him and in the future future you're
[24:16] going to reign with him guess what the
[24:18] Futures now because he says right now we
[24:20] reign with Christ right now we've been
[24:22] translated into the kingdom as dear son
[24:24] right now the gift of righteousness
[24:26] shall reign in life by Jesus Christ
[24:30] and Grace can Reign through
[24:32] righteousness right now
[24:34] it says right now we reign with Christ
[24:36] and now this is where you want to jot
[24:38] this down having Dominion
[24:41] over sin the World the Flesh and the
[24:47] devil
[24:48] no wonder Paul said if God before us who
[24:50] can be against us who shall lay anything
[24:52] through to the charge of God's elect he
[24:54] says right now we reign with Christ and
[24:57] as spiritual Kings we have dominion
[25:01] can't consider that word Kingdom so this
[25:04] is a king with a domain right now we are
[25:07] Kings and our Dominion is over sin the
[25:10] World the Flesh and the devil
[25:13] Paul said it made us Kings and Priests
[25:16] unto God and his father to him be glory
[25:18] and Dominion forever and ever brother
[25:20] Adam says right now we're Kings and he
[25:22] says showing forth his praise and glory
[25:25] this is how we show it forth by having
[25:27] dominion over sin by having dominion
[25:29] over unbelief having dominion over the
[25:31] influences of the world having dominion
[25:33] over the spirits that are in the world
[25:34] having dominion over the flesh having
[25:36] dominion over the tempter the devil and
[25:37] the accused of the Brethren showing
[25:39] forth his praise and glory showing forth
[25:41] himself
[25:43] for it is Christ in US willing and doing
[25:47] of his good pleasure this is the kingdom
[25:49] ring
[25:50] yes indeed even now we are seated in
[25:53] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[25:56] and made us priests so there he says he
[25:59] hath made us Kings
[26:02] and now he says he's made as priests
[26:05] what an incredible
[26:06] uh coming together
[26:09] we see in the Bible the example of a
[26:10] king that intruded on the office of a
[26:12] priest and God smote him with Leprosy
[26:15] and there was even Saul was not to
[26:17] intrude on the office of a prophet there
[26:19] was this division of King HUD in the
[26:23] priesthood but now he said I've made you
[26:24] Kings and Priests
[26:27] we see these promises in the Old
[26:29] Testament Israel was going to be a
[26:30] nation a royal priesthood a nation of
[26:33] Kings a nation a priest and he says he's
[26:35] made as priests now yes priest unto him
[26:39] offering the spiritual
[26:44] kind of got mixed lost this year let me
[26:46] find where I'm at
[26:48] yes priest unto him offering the
[26:51] spiritual praise
[26:54] I think I skipped something yes indeed
[26:58] is Christ in US willing to do it of his
[27:00] own good pleasure yes indeed even now we
[27:03] are seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[27:04] Jesus I want to come back to that
[27:07] because how often does brother Graham
[27:08] say when
[27:09] now
[27:11] see that now now seated in Heavenly
[27:13] places and made us priest yes priests
[27:16] unto him offering the spiritual Praise
[27:18] of Sanctified lips
[27:22] spending our lives I think of that
[27:25] spending our lives
[27:28] not structuring our church services
[27:31] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[27:35] unto him
[27:37] worshiping him in spirit and in truth
[27:39] why is it we like to think that they
[27:42] that worship Him shall worship Him in
[27:43] spirit and Truth only takes place within
[27:45] the four walls as if this is the arena
[27:48] that counts
[27:50] and and there's a life spending our
[27:53] lives worshiping him in spirit and a
[27:55] truth interceding and petitioning the
[27:58] role of the priesthood that we have now
[28:00] is not to play church but to suspend Our
[28:03] Lives interceding to spend our lives
[28:05] petitioning spending our lives our very
[28:08] lives as a sweet offering unto him our
[28:10] very lives being a life song worshiping
[28:12] him and spirit in the truth priests and
[28:14] Kings into our God and he says no wonder
[28:16] the world does not appeal to us
[28:20] no wonder the world does not appeal to
[28:22] us and we are peculiar people zealous
[28:24] unto good works
[28:25] we have been recreated in him to be
[28:28] children like unto our father
[28:32] this is what it means when he says he
[28:34] hath made us Kings and Priests and that
[28:37] spiritual Dominion is right now right
[28:39] now we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom
[28:41] having dominion over sin the World the
[28:44] Flesh and the devil and therefore as we
[28:46] live our lives we're showing himself
[28:49] Christ in us both willing and doing of
[28:52] his good pleasure
[28:54] we've been recreated in him to show
[28:56] forth the Praises of him who's called us
[28:59] out of darkness and Delight
[29:01] and this uh brother this is Brother
[29:03] Branham in chapter one of the church age
[29:05] book amplifying verse six he hath made
[29:07] his Kings and Priests right now we ruled
[29:09] in reign
[29:10] now
[29:12] I'm glad that we have plenty of time to
[29:14] get into this and I realize now we're
[29:16] just making such good time
[29:17] that I don't expect the service to
[29:20] to be lengthy in any way
[29:23] this is a little bit of a
[29:26] kind of a large step
[29:28] in Revelations chapter 5 verses 7 to 10
[29:32] we're going to find where
[29:34] this phrase Kings and Priests comes up
[29:38] again
[29:39] and now the context
[29:42] isn't John at the introduction of the
[29:45] book
[29:46] of the Book of Revelation but it's at
[29:48] the time when the very book of
[29:49] redemption is being opened
[29:51] this title deed as brother Branham calls
[29:53] it and his connection to creation and
[29:55] Adam's position and relationship and
[29:57] Mankind
[29:58] and all the creation and this lamb comes
[30:01] in verse seven and he came and took the
[30:03] book out of the right hand of him that
[30:04] sat upon the throne brother the most
[30:06] Sublime act in scripture and when he had
[30:08] taken the book now this is something
[30:10] responsive of them
[30:13] in heaven the four beasts and four and
[30:15] 24 Elders fell down before the lamb
[30:18] having every one of them Harps and
[30:21] golden vials full of odors which are the
[30:23] prayers of saints and they sung a new
[30:26] song
[30:27] now this is a new song this is a new
[30:29] praise this is new worship this is a new
[30:31] utterance at the time that the book is
[30:33] being opened
[30:34] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[30:37] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[30:39] was slain and hath redeemed us to God by
[30:42] the blood by thy blood out of every
[30:44] Kindred now just think of how this
[30:46] Kingdom's been be made up through all
[30:48] these Church ages and this Kingdom being
[30:50] built up and now at the time that the
[30:52] book is open there's this new song that
[30:54] is sung and it has just such a rich
[30:58] symbolism you've redeemed Us by the
[31:00] blood of God
[31:02] out of every Kindred in tongue so this
[31:04] is just not Jews but this is redemption
[31:07] in people and Nation
[31:09] and it says it hath made us unto our God
[31:12] Kings and Priests
[31:15] and we shall reign on the Earth
[31:19] I'd like to make this statement I know
[31:21] that we've said it before that these
[31:23] very things that are transpired in
[31:24] Revelations chapter five the very words
[31:26] that are being uttered and John saying
[31:27] everything that was in Earth and in
[31:29] heaven and beneath and Beyond he said I
[31:31] heard I John declare it and crying out
[31:33] that these events that are taking place
[31:35] are connected to Creation
[31:38] their connection to Genesis chapter 1
[31:40] and Genesis chapter 2. we know that this
[31:43] is the full Redemption of everything
[31:44] that Adam lost as brother bam dramatizes
[31:47] this book was the title deed of
[31:48] redemption that when Adam fell this book
[31:51] went back into the hands of God
[31:53] but now there is a restoration of
[31:55] dominion Adam was given a charge to have
[31:58] dominion and to subdue these are the
[32:01] very words of Genesis 1 Genesis 2 this
[32:03] is the very image in that beginning that
[32:04] he was to have dominion he was to subdue
[32:07] so when this these words are going forth
[32:10] this is very significant in terms of the
[32:12] perfect realization of all that was
[32:14] promised in terms of redemption he has
[32:16] made us Kings and Priests and we shall
[32:19] reign on the Earth
[32:22] now there's no question to say that we
[32:24] shall reign on the earth that even those
[32:25] that are Before the Throne of God that
[32:27] are giving this utterance that this this
[32:29] is some looking forward to this time in
[32:31] this moment when either the son of David
[32:33] will establish his throne on Earth in
[32:34] the Millennium or his throne that's
[32:36] established over everything in the New
[32:38] Jerusalem there's going to be a reign in
[32:40] the future but brother man says right
[32:42] now we're spiritual Kings
[32:45] and brother Branham takes this and he
[32:47] makes quite a statement and
[32:49] this the the way this was transcribed
[32:52] years ago they didn't quite have the the
[32:54] wording just right but then as they
[32:56] cleaned the tapes up and got a little
[32:57] bit clearer uh transcription this it
[33:01] brings this out it says the Saints under
[33:02] the altar screamed out worthy are thou o
[33:05] lamb for you have redeemed us this is
[33:07] the 4 and 24 and in the prayers of the
[33:09] Saints are all kind of coming to this
[33:11] picture in verse 9. and now you've made
[33:14] us Kings and Priests and we shall rule
[33:16] on the earth that's him quoting
[33:17] Revelations 5. verse 10. oh my and that
[33:23] so when he opened that book
[33:26] you catch what he says there
[33:28] says that there's there's this crying
[33:30] out you've made us Kings and Priests and
[33:32] we shall rule on the Earth but now
[33:34] there's something very significant
[33:36] that's coming into manifestation right
[33:39] now on Earth he said that so when he
[33:42] opened that book
[33:44] there's something that unfolds there's
[33:45] some manifestation of the kingdom when
[33:48] Christ was on Earth in his first coming
[33:49] he's preaching the kingdom of that God
[33:51] is at hand the kingdom is at hand and
[33:53] was it the full restoration of the
[33:55] Kingdom that Israel is looking for no
[33:56] but was the kingdom being manifested was
[33:59] there a power being expressed was
[34:01] Redemption being declared yes and though
[34:03] there may not be a complete summation of
[34:06] a throne of the the son of David or even
[34:08] that Eternal Kingdom in the New
[34:10] Jerusalem but right now now that he has
[34:13] taken that book and opened that book
[34:15] there is a manifestation of the kingdom
[34:18] and a manifestation of a priesthood that
[34:20] rules on Earth right now
[34:25] he says you see the book actually was
[34:27] planned and written before the
[34:28] foundation of the world
[34:30] this book The Bible was really written
[34:32] before the foundation of the world and
[34:33] Christ being the lamb
[34:35] was slain before the foundation of the
[34:37] world
[34:38] and the members of his bride their names
[34:41] were put in the last book of life before
[34:43] the foundation of the world but it's
[34:44] been sealed up
[34:46] so if I could say this before I read the
[34:48] next part
[34:49] when this book's open there's a loosing
[34:53] of the names in the book
[34:56] Kings and Priests
[34:59] their their rightful place a priesthood
[35:01] was reckoned according to genealogy and
[35:04] they did it by opening books
[35:05] I think one of the most important
[35:07] sermons I've ministered was on name
[35:08] calling and it to me it's such an
[35:11] important uh sermon because it was just
[35:15] a very big a strong burden in my heart
[35:17] to express and maybe the title maybe a
[35:19] lot of people say well you know sticks
[35:21] and stones may break my bones but words
[35:22] will never hurt me and they just kind of
[35:24] move right on and they think maybe it
[35:26] has something to do with calling people
[35:27] foolish names but it's it's about your
[35:29] name being called in this end time
[35:31] and how there's a name called and
[35:33] remember a name is not just the sounding
[35:35] Out of something but a name speaks of
[35:38] character it's not just Jesus it's the
[35:41] character behind the name it's not just
[35:43] the Lord Jesus Christ but it's the life
[35:45] and the character of that name in what
[35:47] that name represents so if a name is
[35:49] going to be called if there's going to
[35:50] be a loosing of the book it's going to
[35:53] declare a genealogy that reckons you
[35:55] back to the throne it reckons you to the
[35:57] priesthood and therefore there's a
[35:59] losing things that have held you back
[36:00] there's a there's a removal of any
[36:02] condemnation if your heart condemns you
[36:04] God is greater than your heart there is
[36:07] something that sounds forth in this end
[36:09] time from this message that goes to
[36:11] Great Lengths to strike down anything
[36:13] that would try to condemn you anything
[36:15] that will try to tear you down anything
[36:16] that would get you discombobulated in
[36:18] your mind think oh well maybe it's for
[36:19] another day or maybe I don't deserve it
[36:21] that's the word of God under the opening
[36:23] of these seals trying to strike off
[36:25] anything that will try to hold you down
[36:29] and he says that these names
[36:32] he says but it's been sealed up and now
[36:34] it's being revealed whose names are
[36:36] written in there and all about it and
[36:39] what a great thing
[36:41] now this I just want to allude to this
[36:44] and I have to be very careful I just
[36:46] even kept some things out of my notes
[36:48] otherwise it there's a there's a channel
[36:51] you get pulled into it's I would just
[36:53] say maybe it's a lot of fun for me to
[36:54] preach
[36:55] but there is then
[36:57] as brother bam talks about a blending of
[36:59] Time and Eternity
[37:01] and us being time space creatures and
[37:03] we're Bound By The Elements of Light
[37:05] time and matter and we exist within that
[37:07] realm right now as human beings but now
[37:10] there comes a a juncture and in that
[37:13] there comes a blending
[37:15] there's a blending of things and brother
[37:17] Eliza Castillo was telling me just how
[37:19] awesome it was to come and preach uh
[37:22] quantum physics to the our church and
[37:24] then afterwards uh he told me one of the
[37:27] people in the church came up just said
[37:28] I've been I've been considering I've
[37:29] been thinking a lot about quantum
[37:31] mechanics and shared some things and and
[37:34] he said he got schooled in and out on
[37:36] string theory and everything and he said
[37:37] I just it was just amazing and I thought
[37:40] that was great
[37:41] there's a there's a blending
[37:45] of the things of time
[37:47] and Eternity
[37:49] and I know that some people quote
[37:51] brother Branham as saying you know we'll
[37:53] speed up and they'll slow down but I
[37:54] don't think it was brother brother
[37:56] Branham that said it is brother Tidwell
[37:58] I think that wrote it
[38:00] and so there's there but there is kind
[38:02] of this harmonizing
[38:04] not of all of the Earth but it's a
[38:06] harmonizing of us who have been born
[38:08] after the flesh there's a harmonizing of
[38:11] our spirits and our souls and our minds
[38:12] and our bodies to to
[38:15] Eternal things
[38:16] so that if right now we rule and Reign
[38:19] Over a spiritual Kingdom that's a
[38:21] supernatural Kingdom I I could say that
[38:24] it's an unseen Kingdom we can't approach
[38:26] a physical Throne it doesn't have a
[38:28] physical scepter but it's greater than
[38:30] all natural things and right now its
[38:32] powers over sin the World the Flesh and
[38:34] the devil so send the World the Flesh
[38:37] and the devil represents all these
[38:38] Natural Things
[38:39] and we exist Within These natural Realms
[38:42] but there's a blending together of them
[38:45] and brother Branham if you could maybe
[38:47] take your own time to study these things
[38:49] our brother Branham shows us the five
[38:51] temporary manifestations of the third
[38:53] poem and there was just these little
[38:55] glimpses that came in
[38:58] as he temporarily manifested these
[39:00] little glimpses of the temporary
[39:01] manifestations of the third pull you'll
[39:03] find that he had there was power to
[39:06] raise a little fish back to life there
[39:08] is power to create squirrels where there
[39:10] were no squirrels there was the power to
[39:13] forgive sins in the sense that Hattie
[39:15] Wright was given her sons there was
[39:17] power to cause a tumor to be taken away
[39:20] and then there was power to control
[39:22] nature
[39:24] and to draw and to harmonize with that
[39:28] nature and to walk with God on Earth
[39:31] because there he is in Colorado and he
[39:33] says oh would you walk with me be the
[39:35] greatest privilege I've ever known and
[39:37] there is a temporary manifestation of
[39:39] the third pool he said there I was
[39:41] walking with him
[39:44] think a little bit about it you you know
[39:45] the the testimonies you know the the
[39:48] things he shared in the message of the
[39:49] hour and then he sees the Nature's
[39:51] coming he says don't you know I can
[39:53] shoot you in a moment why all of
[39:55] creation is being drawn to something
[39:57] because it speaks of a power to come it
[40:00] speaks of a kingdom to come and so
[40:02] there's a blending together
[40:05] the third pull is the open of the word
[40:07] if that Eternal Word is opening now to
[40:10] people on Earth there's a blending
[40:12] together and those temporary
[40:14] manifestations of the third pull what
[40:16] will it be when it comes into full
[40:18] manifestation
[40:19] [Music]
[40:21] thought about even the change of this
[40:22] body how that blending begins to take
[40:24] place
[40:26] sister brother Victor sister Sandia was
[40:29] a privilege to minister sister
[40:31] Margarita's funeral
[40:33] and and so I was just looking at these
[40:36] thoughts of we shall not all sleep but
[40:38] we shall be changed I appreciate the
[40:40] privilege you gave to me
[40:41] uh to be able to minister that it means
[40:43] a lot to me
[40:45] and and the change of our bodies
[40:47] and so I have so much that's just
[40:49] welling up within me
[40:51] and notice what the Bible says here in
[40:53] First Corinthians 15.
[40:55] verses 22 to 26.
[41:01] and I'm wanting this to be context
[41:05] you know brother Branham says we hardly
[41:07] have enough tooth for uh enough enough
[41:09] teeth
[41:10] where are you from Arkansas
[41:12] um or West Virginia we hardly have
[41:15] enough Faith to heal a toothache
[41:18] he says we're supposed to have faith to
[41:19] change our body
[41:21] now I know that's kind of that's a
[41:22] that's a nice realm to work within right
[41:24] because
[41:25] you know if you have a toothache you
[41:27] have a toothache because you have teeth
[41:28] or at least a tooth
[41:30] right
[41:31] yeah and and that's and that's that's
[41:34] why
[41:35] and so I kind of feel good about that I
[41:37] got a headache and I have a headache
[41:38] because I have a head and you know and I
[41:40] need to have enough I need to have
[41:42] enough Faith to change my body I don't
[41:44] have enough Faith right now uh two
[41:46] to over you know to for healing in my
[41:49] headache but you know how about just
[41:50] being having a faith to say no to the
[41:52] world
[41:54] I and you have to have enough Faith to
[41:57] say no to death
[41:59] and you can't say no to death by
[42:00] chocolate at the restaurant
[42:02] come on somebody
[42:07] so now he says in First Corinthians
[42:09] chapter 15 verses 22
[42:11] to 26. for as an Adam all died now
[42:14] notice that symmetry to Romans chapter
[42:16] 5. and Adam all die even so in Christ
[42:19] shall all be made alive
[42:21] for every man in his own order
[42:23] Christ the first fruits
[42:26] remember in Revelation he was the first
[42:27] born among the dead there's just such
[42:29] such
[42:30] tight continuity among these scriptures
[42:32] afterward they that are Christ's
[42:34] that is coming
[42:36] then come at the end
[42:38] when he shall have delivered up the
[42:40] kingdom to God even the father
[42:43] when he shall put down all rule in all
[42:46] authority and Power
[42:48] that's something there's some heavy
[42:49] stuff to think about when is this what
[42:50] does this relate to now he said
[42:52] something here that's very critical for
[42:55] he must Reign him
[42:57] till he hath put all enemies under his
[42:59] feet
[43:01] the last in me that shall be destroyed
[43:03] is death
[43:06] now that's I think that says a lot and
[43:08] maybe I'm just doing it a disservice by
[43:10] kind of just moving past it but notice
[43:12] how he's saying that there's going to be
[43:13] a delivering up of the Kingdom to God
[43:16] and there's to be putting down of all
[43:18] Rule and all authority and Power
[43:20] that there's gonna there should there's
[43:22] only gonna be one Kingdom That Remains
[43:24] and he must Reign he must have dominion
[43:27] until all enemies are under his feet and
[43:30] he says The Last Enemy that shall be
[43:32] destroyed is death
[43:34] so if there's a reigning
[43:36] a ruling and reigning where is this
[43:39] Dominion
[43:40] where is this authoritium
[43:43] and in Romans chapter 16 verse 20 he
[43:46] says in the God of Peace shall Brew
[43:47] Satan under your feet shortly
[43:51] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
[43:52] with you
[43:54] the God of Peace shall bruise Satan
[43:56] under your feet
[43:59] there there is a body on Earth today
[44:01] that represents the kingdom of God being
[44:03] made spirit and life there are people in
[44:06] Earth today who have heard their names
[44:08] called by the word of God and they are
[44:11] the ones right now who are anointed to
[44:13] reign with Christ now having them even
[44:16] over sin the World the Flesh and the
[44:17] devil and is by your feet that Satan is
[44:20] being bruised
[44:24] and this death that's going to be
[44:26] defeated
[44:27] there are going to be a people on Earth
[44:29] there will be a people on Earth who are
[44:31] going to defeat death
[44:33] and I want to share this and maybe
[44:35] forgive me if I haven't built enough
[44:37] around this but I just want to share
[44:39] this quickly you remember when brother
[44:41] Branham in 1961 when he's preaching
[44:43] Paradox tells of him having that vision
[44:46] of that mamba
[44:47] that that snake
[44:49] and it represents sin represents death
[44:54] and brother Branham is talk about how he
[44:56] was coming up to a river he says I drew
[44:58] near the river I looked back and seen
[45:00] which way I'd come and I was two-thirds
[45:02] of the way there to Jordan
[45:04] and and so now he's entered in that that
[45:06] third that third part you first pull you
[45:08] have second pull now the third pull is
[45:10] what's going to bring you in a spiritual
[45:11] way into that Rapture into that a
[45:13] criminal cross he said I look across
[45:15] Jordan I said oh praise God just on the
[45:18] other side there lay all the promise
[45:20] where all the promises lay every promise
[45:22] lays in the Promised Land
[45:26] narrow Highway
[45:27] and there's a there's a snake there in
[45:30] the way
[45:31] as he begins to describe it he says
[45:33] everyone was scared to death of that
[45:36] strike because that it was certain death
[45:38] or instant death certain death if it
[45:40] bites you
[45:42] and and this is something that brother
[45:43] Branham is sensing and feeling and
[45:46] there's this representation of this this
[45:48] sin and death if it bites you it's death
[45:51] and and he tells how the
[45:53] the snake came to brother Branham
[45:56] and I went to bite him but something was
[45:58] holding it off
[46:00] it couldn't bite them
[46:01] and then he said it started going after
[46:04] his friend I think he kind of describes
[46:06] how it's leaping everyone's scared to
[46:08] death trying to get away from it so as
[46:09] he's taking this scene in he says the
[46:12] voice came from above him said you have
[46:14] been given power to bind him
[46:16] the worst or any
[46:20] you've been given power to bind him the
[46:24] worst or any
[46:25] so when I looked at the serpent and then
[46:27] he started towards me and he couldn't do
[46:29] it yet
[46:30] and I said Satan in the name of Jesus
[46:33] Christ I bind you and the serpent of
[46:35] blue smoke flew out of him and he curled
[46:37] up and made that sign like an S capital
[46:39] S backwards an and sign
[46:42] he says and me and means buying this one
[46:45] or anything below him because he was the
[46:48] worst
[46:49] now this what I want to express to you
[46:54] is that this word that has been revealed
[46:57] to you
[46:58] this word that you're feeding on this
[47:01] power of God that's on the inside of you
[47:03] this Kingdom Reign that you're a part of
[47:05] right now is greater than anything
[47:09] in the world whether it be sin the flesh
[47:11] or the devil it's greater than any of it
[47:14] and so now what's being represented here
[47:17] is you've been given power to bind the
[47:20] worst
[47:21] I've been given part upon the worst if
[47:24] you're going to have power to bruise
[47:26] Satan unto your feet if the Last Enemy
[47:28] which is going to be destroyed is death
[47:29] and you're going to have power over
[47:31] death that means you have to have power
[47:33] over sin sin has to have been dealt with
[47:36] and then if it sin is dealt with death
[47:39] is dealt with if unbelief is dealt with
[47:41] then everything else has been dealt with
[47:44] because he says if you bind this one
[47:46] then you can bind anything beneath him
[47:48] oh I hope you can hear that if you can
[47:51] bind and belief if you can bind death if
[47:54] you can bind the worst then you can bind
[47:55] the least
[47:58] because he's the worst
[48:00] but then he says
[48:02] now you must be more sincere than what
[48:04] you are to do this
[48:07] and I know maybe it's at that point some
[48:09] of us just want to go oh well all right
[48:11] never mind
[48:14] but I believe that there's a desire to
[48:16] be more sincere
[48:19] don't worry these I've already preached
[48:21] this page tonight
[48:27] you must be more sincere than what you
[48:29] are to do this
[48:32] and the sermon Investments
[48:37] brother bear says what you need is a
[48:39] return back to the principles
[48:41] and the sincerity of the Gospel
[48:45] back to the real Pentecostal thing that
[48:47] produces Christ in the life of the
[48:50] people
[48:51] he says we get away from those real
[48:52] things
[48:55] this isn't something that we manufacture
[48:56] in our flesh we need to return back to
[48:59] the principles and sincerity of the
[49:00] Gospel when brother Barnabas challenged
[49:03] with this vision of buying the worst
[49:06] and and anything else he says You must
[49:09] be more sincere
[49:11] this means a greater consecration
[49:14] this is what God was speaking to me and
[49:16] it's a very plain all the way back in I
[49:19] think it was in mid-summer that that all
[49:22] hell is against us
[49:24] there's got to be a greater sincerity
[49:26] there's got to be a greater consecration
[49:28] and that's why maybe if I could share
[49:30] this in my way of Grace that it's just a
[49:33] Razor's Edge now and you wonder why you
[49:35] could have such a wonderful feeling of
[49:37] the presence of God and just get right
[49:38] back into a foul mood so quickly because
[49:40] God is requiring of us a greater
[49:42] sincerity and it's just a Razor's Edge
[49:44] that we could just fall off of it why
[49:46] because we ought to be more mature now
[49:48] we're coming right up to the moment
[49:50] where we've got to defeat death and we
[49:52] can't do this just by being willy-nilly
[49:54] and lackadaisical we've got to come back
[49:56] to the real Pentecostal thing that
[49:58] produces Christ in the life of the
[50:01] people it says we must be more sincere
[50:06] and he says you've been given power to
[50:08] bind him
[50:09] in Matthew chapter 16 Jesus is speaking
[50:12] to Peter he says and I will give unto
[50:14] thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
[50:16] and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[50:18] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[50:21] Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be
[50:22] loosed in heaven
[50:24] all hell is against the revelation of
[50:26] Jesus Christ
[50:27] and and this Revelation contains the
[50:31] knowledge to unlock the power of the
[50:33] Kingdom
[50:34] to unlock a greater consecration a
[50:36] greater sincerity than if I'm going to
[50:38] have power to find the worse then I've
[50:41] got to be more sincere I I've got to
[50:44] have a greater sensitivity to the spirit
[50:46] I can't walk after the Flesh and think
[50:48] that I could subdue condemnation I can't
[50:50] walk after the Flesh and be caught up in
[50:52] the whims of the Flesh and think that I
[50:54] can subdue the worst let alone anything
[50:55] else
[50:58] he says we've been given power to bind
[51:02] this serpent
[51:05] and as we ministered quite a bit on the
[51:07] tares
[51:08] we recognize that there's even this
[51:10] element of these tares that's in our
[51:11] spirits and in our bodies by a natural
[51:13] birth I I want to I want to express this
[51:16] as I close and musicians you could even
[51:19] come that if we have been given power
[51:21] that by this new birth and by the
[51:24] revelation of Jesus Christ with the Keys
[51:27] of the Kingdom of Heaven whatever we
[51:29] bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven
[51:31] whatsoever we shall loose on Earth shall
[51:32] be loosed in heaven and right now we
[51:35] reign with Christ having dominion over
[51:37] sin the World the Flesh and the devil
[51:40] then if I have got power to bind I'm I'm
[51:44] not going to try to hunt down a Mamba
[51:46] out there somewhere I'm not going to try
[51:48] to hunt down a serpent I'm not going to
[51:50] try to find that Karen at the grocery
[51:51] store who's giving somebody her business
[51:53] and I'm going to speak my mind to her
[51:55] and bring her into order no I'm going to
[51:57] start by binding him here first I'm
[52:00] going to start if whatever is bound on
[52:02] Earth will be bound in heaven then I
[52:04] want to bind sin right here first I want
[52:07] to bind the world right here first I
[52:09] want to bind this flesh right here
[52:11] whatever's in my heart whatever's in my
[52:13] mind the future is now I want to bind
[52:17] him here now
[52:20] right now there can be a spiritual reign
[52:22] of the son of man
[52:24] before the literal reign of the son of
[52:26] David
[52:27] right now
[52:29] and I'll start with this Kingdom
[52:32] I'll start with me as the head of a
[52:35] house
[52:36] I'll start with me as the head of a wife
[52:38] I'll start with me as being the house
[52:40] band the husband that binds the home
[52:42] together I'll start with me
[52:45] and then I'll establish a Dominion in my
[52:48] home applying the token bringing things
[52:51] in order why because this is the power
[52:53] of the Kingdom
[52:56] because I don't want to fool myself into
[52:57] thinking
[52:59] that one day one day bride you're going
[53:02] to step on death and trip over
[53:04] everything in between
[53:08] brother Brown says in the sermon the
[53:10] world has fallen apart this is just
[53:11] after he preaches the seals he's
[53:14] I believe he's in New Mexico he says
[53:15] what are we looking for friends
[53:18] what are we
[53:20] the real church is looking not for
[53:22] denomination not looking for a president
[53:25] not looking for a genius to rise up
[53:31] but they're looking for a kingdom and a
[53:33] king to come
[53:36] what is the kingdom
[53:37] it's on earth now
[53:40] it's a spirit mystical Body of Christ
[53:43] [Music]
[53:44] in there they've come out of
[53:46] Presbyterian Methodist Pentecostals and
[53:48] everything they're in this Kingdom
[53:51] they're born in there
[53:53] they come in there by the baptism of the
[53:55] Holy Spirit and they're in this Kingdom
[53:57] he's saying it's on Earth right now
[53:59] [Music]
[54:01] and we're looking for a king to come to
[54:02] this Kingdom
[54:04] set his kingdom upon up here on the
[54:07] Earth
[54:08] on a throne of
[54:09] them we shall Rule and Reign forever
[54:12] that's what the church looks for
[54:15] is that what we're looking for
[54:17] I'm looking forward to oh a millennial
[54:21] reign it's one of the funnest things to
[54:23] Fellowship on
[54:24] I'm looking forward to an eighth day
[54:27] those things are real they're promised
[54:30] but then he says
[54:31] and the good thing about it friends is
[54:34] think of this
[54:35] before we get to this Kingdom
[54:38] before this King comes he's talking
[54:39] about in the flesh to establish the
[54:41] literal Kingdom on earth now we can set
[54:43] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[54:45] Jesus
[54:47] lifted up above all the shadows of all
[54:52] the corruption of the world
[54:54] and all their television programs
[54:57] all these other nonsenses they got on
[55:00] the Earth today and all their rotten
[55:02] pollution and systems and everything
[55:05] if I could say this my wife and I were
[55:07] fellowshipping on it and it's just such
[55:08] a beautiful truth that she was the one
[55:10] making the point that brother Brandon
[55:12] kind of chastised the Pentecostal people
[55:14] and said you used to not run to the
[55:16] picture shows he said the devil pulled
[55:18] one over on you and he put it in the
[55:19] home and so while we don't we don't go
[55:22] to the movie theater and he says now
[55:23] they put it in the home and that would
[55:25] be that was a box a television that only
[55:27] picked up certain channels that could
[55:28] just filter whatever it is into the home
[55:31] now the devil certainly got a little bit
[55:34] more creative or we've just gotten a
[55:35] little bit more inventive and we're
[55:36] killing ourselves with science because
[55:38] now we we may not have a television and
[55:41] and I don't know how much brother
[55:42] Brandon could have articulated that he
[55:44] saw but I mean who would have thought
[55:45] that we could all work from home
[55:48] and pay the bills all we need is a
[55:51] connection to the internet
[55:52] and access to things they're in and how
[55:55] that thing that has become even what
[55:57] they're trying to call a basic human
[55:58] right
[55:59] and that art can be subsidized and
[56:01] certain things paid for by the
[56:03] government because we need the Internet
[56:04] you need internet access and you need
[56:06] good bandwidth and you need to have
[56:07] access to certain things and how that
[56:09] through that where you need these things
[56:11] just to pay bills you need these things
[56:13] just to make appointments and do certain
[56:15] things that it through that same channel
[56:18] comes everything else
[56:20] and all the nonsense of the world
[56:23] and how much more than are we to be
[56:26] sincere
[56:28] given all these things that are in the
[56:30] world the Shadows of the crypts in this
[56:31] world their television programs all the
[56:33] other nonsenses they got on the Earth
[56:34] today and now it's not that the devil's
[56:36] pulled one over on us but now it's
[56:38] evolved where you can have things that
[56:39] aren't purely television but have access
[56:42] to all the things that brother Branham
[56:43] said were rotting our minds
[56:46] he says be lifted up in Heavenly places
[56:49] the Holy Spirit himself come upon us
[56:51] speak out and call to call to us our
[56:54] sins
[56:55] and tell us how to get straightened up
[56:57] and what we've done in life and what
[56:59] we're doing we can see these things
[57:00] pronounced in his ministry it's the Holy
[57:03] Spirit
[57:04] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[57:06] and forever
[57:07] that's the king that shall come to his
[57:09] kingdom Sunday
[57:11] and his kingdom is now being established
[57:14] in the hearts of his people here on
[57:17] Earth
[57:19] thy kingdom come
[57:21] thy will be done
[57:23] in Earth
[57:24] as it is in heaven
[57:26] it's yield to it let's say the Futures
[57:29] now not one day wait a little while
[57:31] longer one day I'll do this one day I'll
[57:33] do that no make that we've got to be
[57:35] more proactive as parents we got to be
[57:37] more proactive in our dealings and and
[57:39] foresee the trouble that's coming and
[57:42] even look at the pattern in our lives of
[57:44] how certain things maybe got their hold
[57:46] on us and how certain things went a
[57:47] certain direction and say Lord I
[57:49] sanctify myself for their sakes I've got
[57:51] to be proactive I've got to be sincere
[57:53] I've got to be consecrated and and
[57:56] hopefully this calls to some part in
[57:58] your heart to realize
[58:00] these things aren't some kind of
[58:01] clothesline religion this isn't just
[58:04] some old-fashioned thing these are
[58:05] principles of the word of God that run
[58:07] very very deep
[58:09] and that are far that are for your
[58:12] benefit
[58:13] and I believe we ought to be considering
[58:15] them
[58:16] and I believe a beneficial prayer
[58:18] tonight the Lord help me to be more
[58:20] principled and be back get back to the
[58:23] sincerity of the Gospel so that the real
[58:26] Pentecostal thing can produce Christ in
[58:28] my life
[58:30] amen
[58:32] I know your desired prayer tonight so
[58:34] could you stand with me we'll pray with
[58:35] you
