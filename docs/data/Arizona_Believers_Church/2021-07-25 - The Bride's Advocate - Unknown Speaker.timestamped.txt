[0:00] so if you just look again at where we
[0:01] were just reading in first john chapter
[0:03] 2 i'd like to read a few more verses
[0:06] so you can understand where our heart is
[0:09] at on
[0:10] this thought of the bride's advocate
[0:14] and it says my little children these
[0:15] things write i unto you
[0:17] that ye sin not and if any men sin we
[0:20] have an advocate with the father
[0:22] jesus christ the righteous and he is the
[0:24] perpetuation
[0:25] for our sins and not for ours only but
[0:28] also for
[0:28] the sins of the whole world and that's
[0:31] and that's an extraordinary
[0:32] conclusion and hereby we do know that we
[0:36] know him
[0:37] if we keep his commandments he that say
[0:39] if i know him and keep it not his
[0:41] commandments is a liar
[0:43] and the truth is not in him this is the
[0:45] love apostle
[0:46] this is this is the one that it's a
[0:48] spouse's love and he's very bold with
[0:50] his love
[0:51] if someone says they know god but don't
[0:52] keep his commandments he's lying
[0:54] and the truth is not in him verse 5 but
[0:56] who so keepeth his word
[0:58] in him verily is the love of god
[1:00] perfected
[1:01] hereby know we that we are in him he
[1:04] that sayeth he abideth in him
[1:06] ought himself also to so was also so to
[1:10] walk
[1:10] even as he walked and so i'd like to
[1:15] perhaps maybe even begin a subject but
[1:17] my title today is the bride's
[1:19] advocate and this has been
[1:23] it came upon my heart in a real real
[1:25] substantial way in a very very heavy way
[1:27] and what i'm actually pondering is the
[1:30] thought of the bride's advocacy
[1:33] and the bride's public ministry and what
[1:35] we do as bride and what's expected of us
[1:37] as members of the bride of jesus christ
[1:39] and it began with this thought on an
[1:42] advocate
[1:43] and even to advocate so you can have the
[1:45] noun you could have the verb
[1:47] and and so just i want to speak on this
[1:48] and make it real personal to you i used
[1:50] the bride's advocate
[1:52] in a way to speak maybe as of us being
[1:55] collective
[1:56] but it's your advocate i want this to be
[1:58] very personal to you
[2:00] as we explore this subject and in verse
[2:02] 1 it says my little children these
[2:04] things
[2:05] right i unto you and he says and he's
[2:07] making this conclusion we have an
[2:09] ad the father we have an
[2:12] advocate with the father so in this
[2:15] thought where he says we
[2:17] we have an advocate with the father he
[2:18] brings himself into this it's very
[2:21] ticking point that he's trying to make
[2:23] that we have this advocate with the
[2:25] father
[2:26] and in doing so john is addressing the
[2:28] elect
[2:29] and i want that to maybe be uh the most
[2:32] significant thing you identify here at
[2:34] the outset is john is addressing the
[2:36] elect
[2:37] now to understand kind of the the
[2:39] direction he's going and the point that
[2:40] he's trying to
[2:42] take a look at uh i'm going to grab this
[2:44] red mic
[2:46] and uh and the old-fashioned way
[2:50] and just hold the mic this will keep me
[2:52] keep me busy with one hand
[2:56] if you want to um just look at first
[2:58] john chapter one i think it's important
[3:00] to kind of look that look at this in the
[3:01] sense
[3:02] that um to kind of get an idea of what
[3:05] john is
[3:06] laying out and what forms the basis
[3:09] for his uh his comment in chapter two
[3:12] verse one and we know john didn't write
[3:14] in verse chapter four map
[3:16] but just so you can understand the flow
[3:18] of this letter and his epistle
[3:20] i'm just going to make some summary
[3:22] conclusions from first john chapter one
[3:25] and in the first three verses he's
[3:27] establishing that life
[3:28] has been given to the elect by jesus
[3:30] christ so he begins by
[3:33] by dealing with how that life has been
[3:34] given and we have received
[3:36] life and that through that life there's
[3:38] fellowship with the father and with his
[3:40] son jesus christ
[3:41] i think maybe i'm a little hot there if
[3:44] it's too loud you can just start
[3:45] plugging your ears and giving off
[3:47] signals
[3:48] but through this life that we've
[3:49] received there's fellowship with with
[3:51] god
[3:51] and his son jesus and it's through that
[3:54] fellowship
[3:55] i want us to maybe think in terms of the
[3:56] fellowship being communion
[3:58] so because we've received life it's
[4:00] through that life that we have
[4:01] fellowship
[4:02] and then in verse 4 he says and these
[4:04] things write we
[4:05] unto you that your joy may be full
[4:09] and so in this i found that there was
[4:10] some continuity with the subject that we
[4:12] had been pondering and ministering on in
[4:14] pure joy
[4:15] he says i'm writing these things so that
[4:17] the joy that you have may be complete
[4:19] and it may be full and it may be
[4:21] uh just total for you and so i'm writing
[4:23] these things that your joy may be full
[4:25] and then in verses five to 7 he's
[4:28] declaring that god is light
[4:30] and that him there's no darkness and
[4:32] that in light the
[4:33] the nature of light and its essential
[4:35] characteristic is that it exposes
[4:37] any pretense as to our fellowship and
[4:40] since god is light and in
[4:42] so we receive this life and this life is
[4:45] light
[4:45] and so we have this light inside of us
[4:48] that exposes any hypocrisy
[4:49] any pretense any religion anything of
[4:52] self
[4:53] that relates to our fellowship so it's
[4:55] going to expose
[4:56] anything that's not in harmony with god
[4:58] anything that
[4:59] relates to more religion or more
[5:01] personality or pretense or politics
[5:03] when it comes to our fellowship and so
[5:05] that's what light does we have
[5:07] life by jesus christ it puts us in
[5:09] fellowship
[5:10] and we have light also by jesus christ
[5:13] and that exposes any hypocrisy with
[5:15] respect to our fellowship
[5:17] and then in verses 8 to 10 and this is
[5:19] how he's kind of really ramping up to
[5:21] chapter two he addresses those that
[5:24] would deny
[5:25] any need for reconciliation by jesus
[5:27] christ someone say well
[5:28] i don't i don't need to be reconciled by
[5:30] jesus christ i have no sin i keep the
[5:32] law
[5:33] or i'm a good person and i do good
[5:35] things i have integrity
[5:37] and he's talking about how that one
[5:39] would say we have no need to be
[5:41] be forgiven for we have not sinned and
[5:44] brother adams actually asked about this
[5:46] question
[5:46] in question and answers and he's asked
[5:49] you know how can you reconcile the fact
[5:51] that you say that
[5:52] you know it's possible for a believer to
[5:53] live in a place where they do not sin
[5:55] when it says that um that if someone
[5:58] says they have not sinned
[6:00] then they're a liar so these kind of ask
[6:02] this very pointed question
[6:03] and brother branham kind of takes it and
[6:05] summarize it to say that when you say
[6:07] you haven't sinned you're wrong
[6:10] and and it's not so much relating to the
[6:12] last five minutes he's just saying if
[6:14] you say that you have
[6:15] as a blanket statement have never sinned
[6:17] then you're wrong
[6:18] and if you say this as someone who is
[6:20] not a christian and is not a believer
[6:22] i have not sinned he says you're wrong
[6:24] you need to be born again
[6:26] so he's it's identifying this particular
[6:29] condition of the individual it doesn't
[6:31] relate to their profession of christ
[6:33] jesus or the fact that they're sealed
[6:35] with the holy ghost
[6:36] and kind of a blanket statement about
[6:38] their justification before christ
[6:40] but rather just someone as they're
[6:42] examined by the truth or maybe someone
[6:44] in sin or in the world or maybe someone
[6:46] who
[6:46] denies the existence of god if they say
[6:49] they haven't sinned they're lying
[6:51] and brother i'm saying that this is a
[6:53] condition before you're born again
[6:55] and a condition afterwards and so in the
[6:57] process of answering that question he
[6:59] makes this statement
[7:00] before you've received the holy ghost
[7:02] you are believing unto
[7:04] eternal life that's a very important
[7:06] principle to understand he talks about
[7:08] believing unto
[7:09] but you do not have eternal life until
[7:11] you receive the holy ghost
[7:13] so there is no condition of being little
[7:16] b
[7:16] little a born again and having eternal
[7:18] life no
[7:19] you cannot have eternal life without
[7:21] having the holy ghost because you have
[7:23] eternal life when you receive the holy
[7:25] ghost
[7:25] because the holy ghost he says is
[7:28] eternal life
[7:29] the holy ghost is god it's god's life in
[7:31] you then you've got
[7:32] eternal life and so he's identifying
[7:35] the point at which john is saying if you
[7:37] say you have not sinned you're a liar
[7:39] and it's when someone is in fact still
[7:42] in their sin
[7:43] unrepentant and haven't having not
[7:45] recognized or acknowledged the fact that
[7:47] they're in a sinful condition
[7:48] they are a liar because in first john
[7:51] chapter 3 verse 9 it says whosoever is
[7:53] born of god
[7:54] doth not commit sin now here's a
[7:56] tremendous paradox
[7:58] if you say that you have not sinned
[7:59] you're a liar but then he who is not
[8:01] born
[8:02] he who is born again doth not commit sin
[8:05] and i know that there's actually some
[8:07] semantics there you could look at it as
[8:08] mere semantics
[8:09] but there's a very precise language
[8:11] that's being used if someone says
[8:13] that they uh have have no sin then
[8:16] they're a liar it says that i
[8:18] um if any man saith
[8:21] that he does not sin or has not sinned
[8:23] and keeps his commandments and he's
[8:25] talking about
[8:26] only uh laying it out in such a way to
[8:28] where there's this point at which
[8:29] someone says oh
[8:30] i have no sin i'm fine i'm not i haven't
[8:33] done anything wrong and
[8:34] and i have i have no sin well you need
[8:37] to be born again and it's identifying
[8:39] this point at which one
[8:41] is in sin needs to acknowledge it to be
[8:43] born again but when john says whosoever
[8:45] is born of god he shifted the focus
[8:48] and now the focus is no longer on on
[8:51] this point at which one needs to
[8:52] acknowledge their sinful
[8:54] nature but once they're born of god he's
[8:56] using a very
[8:57] rich statement they they do not commit
[9:00] sin
[9:00] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[9:03] cannot sin because he is born of god
[9:06] now that's a very very heavy statement
[9:08] that's a very
[9:09] a very substantial statement and and
[9:12] and so in recognizing that it may seem
[9:15] to be a paradox but there's a beautiful
[9:17] truth that harmonizes these statements
[9:18] and breathing these brings these things
[9:20] together
[9:21] for it says in first john verse 10 if we
[9:22] say that we have not sinned
[9:24] we make him a liar and his word is not
[9:27] in us
[9:28] and so there's a there's this we cannot
[9:31] say oh i never sinned because
[9:32] one who has been guilty and recognizes
[9:34] their guilt can acknowledge
[9:36] no i was a sinner i was steeped in
[9:37] unbelief and i was wayward
[9:39] and so this very strong things that he's
[9:41] saying
[9:42] and it's it's similar to what john how
[9:45] john is admonishing the believer in
[9:46] first john chapter 2 verse 4
[9:48] he that saith i know him and keepeth not
[9:51] his commandments
[9:52] is a liar and the truth is not in him so
[9:55] kind of notice this symmetry if we say
[9:56] that we have not sinned
[9:58] we make him a liar and his word is not
[10:00] in us if we say that we know him and
[10:02] keep not his commandments we are
[10:04] liars and the truth is not in us so
[10:06] there's a symmetry
[10:07] to how john is approaching the believer
[10:09] to get them to acknowledge the full
[10:11] grace of jesus christ
[10:13] and so john in this outset he's
[10:16] establishing some very profound
[10:17] principles i can just maybe
[10:19] summarize it that way and they're very
[10:20] necessary things
[10:22] that this statement in first john
[10:23] chapter 2 verse 1 is built upon
[10:26] and i wanted just to give some
[10:27] acknowledgement to that so you can kind
[10:29] of understand it within this context
[10:31] because there's these things that he's
[10:33] using that kind of formed the book ends
[10:34] to this point that he makes in verse one
[10:36] of chapter two it says my little
[10:38] children these things right i
[10:40] unto you that you sin not and notice how
[10:44] that
[10:45] parallels with what he said in verse
[10:46] four these things i write unto you that
[10:48] your
[10:48] joy may be full and so there's a
[10:50] connection then
[10:52] between us not sinning and being in a
[10:54] state in the state of sin
[10:56] and our joy being full i write these
[10:58] things that you send not i write these
[11:00] things that your joy may be full
[11:01] and if any man's sin we have an advocate
[11:03] with the father
[11:04] jesus christ the righteous now
[11:08] what he's dealing with is how that when
[11:10] we make a mistake or
[11:11] it's or if i can say it this way it's
[11:13] sin that causes the sense of regret
[11:16] we know we can all say amen to that when
[11:18] we find that we are disbelieving our
[11:20] faith isn't strong it's sin that causes
[11:22] this
[11:22] sense of regret and then ultimately by
[11:25] our own
[11:26] uh beating ourselves up and through the
[11:28] efforts of the devil to support that it
[11:30] results in shame
[11:32] and what we're wrestling with is this
[11:33] guilty conscience and even a conscience
[11:35] that therein can become defiled
[11:37] so it's sin or unbelief of our own
[11:40] accord and of our own doing
[11:41] that weakens our minds and so he's kind
[11:44] of dealing with that he says if we sin
[11:46] i i'm writing to you that your joy may
[11:49] be full and these things i write unto
[11:50] you that you sin
[11:51] not but he's saying this if we sin
[11:54] notice this if we sin
[11:55] we have an advocate and this is what i'm
[11:58] wanting to amplify for the rest of our
[12:00] time together today
[12:02] is that if we send just think of that
[12:04] phrase and what john would mean by it
[12:06] and not make our own assumptions about
[12:07] it
[12:07] if we send we have an advocate well what
[12:10] does it mean that we have an advocate
[12:12] and i want to bring you back to what we
[12:13] said at the outset john is addressing
[12:16] those who have the holy spirit
[12:18] we took our time to go kind of this
[12:20] overview of the first few verses of the
[12:21] chapter in the
[12:22] of chapter 1 and verses 5 to 7 and kind
[12:25] of walk through those different verses
[12:26] that even brother branham
[12:28] addressing verse 10 if any man say we
[12:30] have not sinned we make him a liar and
[12:32] his word is not in us
[12:34] address those things that you can see
[12:36] that brother branham is identifying
[12:38] that who is being spoken to in chapter
[12:40] two are those who've been born again
[12:42] by the word of truth so there's been
[12:45] this separation made out of sin there's
[12:47] been a separation from the world these
[12:49] my children these things i write unto
[12:50] you that you sin not and
[12:52] if any man sin he's writing to those who
[12:55] have the holy ghost and so
[12:56] there's this concept of this idea that
[12:58] we do something
[13:00] that we know is not in harmony with what
[13:02] we know to be the truth
[13:04] he's speaking to the born again can we
[13:07] accept that today
[13:08] that he's speaking to the bride so he
[13:10] says
[13:11] we have an advocate with the father
[13:13] jesus christ the righteous
[13:15] and he is the perpetuation for our sins
[13:18] that word even there
[13:19] is used of the mercy seat he is the
[13:21] propitiation for our sins
[13:23] and not for ours only but also for the
[13:25] sins of the whole world
[13:27] and hereby we do know and i want you to
[13:30] notice the language and i'm just reading
[13:32] this again
[13:32] because i want to go to john chapter 14
[13:35] so you can see
[13:36] how this relates to the born-again those
[13:38] who have the holy spirit
[13:39] hereby we know that we know him if we
[13:42] keep his commandments that's kind of how
[13:43] we know that we know god as we know his
[13:45] commandments and we have the nature
[13:47] within us to follow them and walk
[13:48] walk in them he that saith i know him oh
[13:51] i know him i know him and keep not
[13:53] keepeth not his commandments
[13:55] is a liar and the truth is not in him so
[13:58] if you say that you know christ but
[14:00] don't obey his word and don't believe
[14:01] his word
[14:02] that that's not the language doesn't
[14:04] make sense anymore oh i believe them
[14:06] it'd be like saying well
[14:07] if i told you it was raining it was
[14:09] raining uh here's an umbrella and you go
[14:11] i believe you and you walked out into
[14:12] the rain and acted like it wasn't
[14:13] raining and you get out there in the
[14:14] middle of the rainbow i'm soaking wet
[14:16] it's like well if you believed me
[14:18] you would have taken the umbrella and so
[14:20] there's a there's an action that takes
[14:21] place
[14:22] following belief that indicates oh i
[14:24] truly i truly believe and understand
[14:26] what's being said
[14:27] so he continues but who so keepeth his
[14:29] word in him verily is the love of god
[14:31] perfected so if you keep his
[14:33] commandments
[14:34] you keep his precepts keep his word in
[14:36] that one who does so is the love of god
[14:38] perfected
[14:39] hereby know we that we are in him we
[14:42] know that we're in him
[14:43] because we know his word and we keep his
[14:45] word he that saith he abideth in him
[14:48] and this is kind of as he's already said
[14:50] he that says this but doesn't do it he's
[14:51] a liar and he that says this and doesn't
[14:53] do it makes him a liar
[14:54] now he kind of kind of helps us out a
[14:55] little bit so that you don't lie he says
[14:57] he that says he abides in him
[14:59] ought to himself also walk even as he
[15:02] walked
[15:03] so he said so you're not a liar if you
[15:04] say you abide in him then we should
[15:06] strive to walk
[15:07] like him so he's making a connection
[15:10] between the indwelling truth the truth
[15:12] that's on the inside of the believer and
[15:14] how that if we have the truth on the
[15:15] inside of us then we'll act in harmony
[15:17] with the truth that is observable so if
[15:20] we have a written word we have a spoken
[15:21] word we have a word that we've received
[15:23] then the indwelling truth will act in
[15:25] harmony with
[15:26] the revealed truth the indwelling truth
[15:29] will act in harmony with the word
[15:31] now if you turn to john chapter 14 i
[15:33] want you to recognize again
[15:35] the symmetry with what jesus said
[15:39] when he told the believers or told the
[15:40] disciples that he was going to send them
[15:42] the comforter as john is saying my
[15:44] little children we have an advocate with
[15:46] the father
[15:47] and he talks about being in him and
[15:49] believing the truth and walking in the
[15:51] truth
[15:52] and if you are in him then you obey if
[15:53] you have the truth then you keep his
[15:55] commandments
[15:56] and herein is the love of god perfected
[15:58] when jesus
[15:59] is actually teaching the disciples about
[16:02] the comforter that's to come which is
[16:03] the holy spirit
[16:04] he uses the exact same language so john
[16:07] is
[16:08] writing in some way this would be my
[16:10] observation
[16:11] and so that's maybe a little bit of a
[16:12] disclaimer and an invitation for you to
[16:14] tell you tell you tell me that you
[16:16] you disagree with me but this is my
[16:18] observation that john is writing very
[16:20] precisely from
[16:21] what he heard jesus say in john chapter
[16:23] 14.
[16:24] verse 15 to 6 26 if you love me keep my
[16:28] commandments
[16:29] it's the very same thing if you say that
[16:30] you know him and do not keep his
[16:32] commandments
[16:32] then you're a liar if you love me keep
[16:34] my commandments and then notice how
[16:36] beautiful this is
[16:37] i will pray the father and he shall give
[16:40] you
[16:40] another comforter that he may abide with
[16:44] you
[16:44] forever even as john saying he that
[16:46] saith he abideth in him also
[16:48] ought to walk as he walked there's this
[16:50] language that's a very
[16:52] very particular and very exact and it's
[16:55] tracking what jesus said
[16:57] and notice even a beautiful phrase on
[16:59] jesus's part if you love him
[17:01] you're going to keep his commandments
[17:03] and then this is what he prays he
[17:05] actually prays
[17:06] that he'll send you a comforter
[17:09] so if you love him you want to keep his
[17:11] commandments if you love him you want to
[17:13] serve him so
[17:14] knowing that you love him and you want
[17:15] to serve him he says i'm going to pray
[17:17] that he'll give you and he's called
[17:18] another comforter because jesus is there
[17:21] present with him as a
[17:22] in the flesh physically present teaching
[17:25] guiding
[17:26] instructing admonishing and he knows
[17:28] that he's going to be gone and he says i
[17:29] know that if you love me you're going to
[17:31] keep my commandments and in my absence
[17:33] i'm going to pray that he sends you
[17:34] another comforter that he may abide with
[17:37] you forever because he knew that he
[17:38] would be leaving
[17:39] and then he describes he kind of makes
[17:41] connects this language together
[17:43] even the spirit of truth so the
[17:44] comforter and the spirit of the truth
[17:46] are working are synonymous here
[17:50] and now catch the language whom the
[17:52] world cannot receive who is it the
[17:53] comfort or the spirit of truth
[17:55] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[17:58] him
[17:58] but you know him for he dwelleth with
[18:01] you and shall be in you
[18:03] this place is the comforter and the
[18:04] spirit of truth in this position to
[18:07] where it's not
[18:08] observable by the world and it's not
[18:10] known
[18:11] by the world but it's something that's
[18:13] within the believer
[18:15] and that the believer is in harmony and
[18:17] fellowship with and then in turn
[18:18] it being in them is something that's
[18:20] going to be working itself outward
[18:22] that's why it says you ought to walk
[18:23] this way and you ought to live this one
[18:24] you have to act this way and keep his
[18:26] commandments
[18:26] because then it becomes an expression of
[18:28] the indwelling truth
[18:30] he says i will not leave you comfortless
[18:32] and so it's kind of a derivative of the
[18:33] comforter
[18:34] i will come to you yet a little while in
[18:36] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[18:39] because i live ye shall live also
[18:41] brother man said speaking to his wife
[18:44] so this has very specific end time
[18:46] fulfillment
[18:47] at that day and he says what day when
[18:49] the revelation is made known takes in
[18:51] christ is the mystery
[18:52] and brings this to a perfect fulfillment
[18:54] in the hour that we're living
[18:55] at that day you shall know that i am in
[18:57] the father
[18:58] in ye and me and i in you try to unravel
[19:01] that
[19:02] i am in the father you are in him but
[19:04] then he is in you this is not a doll
[19:05] that you can unpack and get it all
[19:07] straight this is something
[19:08] so linked and woven together that it's
[19:10] one and he's talking about he that saith
[19:12] he abideth in him
[19:14] ought to walk as he walk if i am in the
[19:16] i am in the father and you are in me
[19:18] then i am in you
[19:19] verse 21 and he that my he that hath my
[19:22] commandments and keepeth him he it is
[19:24] that loveth me
[19:25] if he keeps my commandments what is he
[19:27] saying in him is the love of god
[19:29] perfected
[19:30] and he that loveth me shall be loved of
[19:31] my father and i will love him
[19:33] and will manifest myself to him such
[19:36] beautiful admonishment encouragement and
[19:39] strength of disciples and judas
[19:41] saith unto him not iscariot lord how is
[19:44] it that you will
[19:45] thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and
[19:47] not into the world because this is a
[19:49] good question
[19:50] because the world doesn't know the holy
[19:51] spirit cannot receive them cannot know
[19:54] but it's going to be in you so it's a
[19:56] very perceptive astute question say well
[19:58] then
[19:59] how is it that you're going to manifest
[20:00] yourself to us but in doing so
[20:03] the world not receive it in the world
[20:05] not see it
[20:06] jesus answered and said unto him if a
[20:08] man loved me he will keep my words he's
[20:10] really repeating
[20:11] the similar things and my father will
[20:13] love him and will come
[20:14] unto him and make our abode with him
[20:18] it's the very same things john's talking
[20:20] about that we have life
[20:21] by jesus christ and through life there's
[20:23] fellowship and communion with the father
[20:25] and this is an indwelling light and it
[20:27] dwells on the inside of us
[20:29] we have this light that's leading us in
[20:30] guiding us he that loveth me not
[20:33] keepeth not my saying so he comes back
[20:35] to i have a word
[20:36] if i'm in you you'll keep my word if you
[20:38] don't love me you won't keep my sayings
[20:40] and the word which you hear is not mine
[20:42] but the fathers which sent me these
[20:44] things have i spoken unto you
[20:46] being yet present with you but the
[20:50] comforter
[20:51] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[20:54] will send in my name
[20:55] he shall teach you now notice what the
[20:58] holy ghost is
[20:59] he shall teach you all things so he's a
[21:01] teacher bring all things to your
[21:03] remembrance so he's a reminder
[21:05] whatsoever i've said unto you this is
[21:08] the nature of the comforter he's going
[21:09] to abide with you forever he's the
[21:11] spirit of truth that the world cannot
[21:13] receive
[21:14] he's given this designation of comforter
[21:16] he says the comforter is the holy spirit
[21:18] he will teach you all things and bring
[21:20] all things in remembrance
[21:21] whatsoever things i have said unto you
[21:24] so there could be this
[21:25] this thought on the disciples part we've
[21:27] only had these three years with christ
[21:29] and his time he's speaking of these
[21:30] things that seem very anonymous
[21:32] and even once they get to the point to
[21:33] know that he's gonna be gone
[21:35] just think of how they might have felt
[21:36] like did we write that down did we know
[21:38] it and
[21:38] how are we gonna remember this and these
[21:40] things are so different than what we've
[21:41] ever heard before
[21:42] oh do you remember what he said that one
[21:44] day over here and do you remember what
[21:45] he said over there
[21:46] there could be a lot of pressure how are
[21:47] we going to remember all this but he's
[21:49] speaking a language to give them
[21:51] comfort and to help them understand who
[21:54] this
[21:55] other comforter is going to be the
[21:57] spirit of truth he says which is the
[21:59] holy spirit which is going to be spent
[22:01] sent in my name he's going to teach you
[22:02] all things and anything i've said unto
[22:04] you
[22:04] and anything i've mentioned unto you
[22:07] he'll teach you
[22:08] and bring it to your remembrance so
[22:10] notice this the comforter
[22:12] he says which is the holy ghost
[22:15] and he establishes this as i in one way
[22:17] i want to think of it as a border
[22:19] i guess in another sense it could be the
[22:21] bread to a sandwich but it's like the
[22:23] book ends
[22:24] he's saying that the comforter which is
[22:26] the holy ghost i'm going to send you the
[22:27] comforter
[22:28] like we think of it this way i'm going
[22:30] to send you the comforter
[22:32] i'll do it from your vantage point i'm
[22:34] going to send you the comforter
[22:36] and he's going to be with you forever
[22:38] and then he begins to say and he talks
[22:39] about
[22:40] keeping his commandments keeping his
[22:41] commandments keeping his commandments
[22:42] and then he's asked a question he comes
[22:44] back to keeping his commandments and
[22:45] keeping his commandments if you love him
[22:47] and then he says i'm going to send you a
[22:48] comforter which is the holy ghost
[22:50] so if you just focused on keeping the
[22:51] commandments keeping the if you love me
[22:53] you keep my commandments
[22:54] we could weaponize that real quick right
[22:56] because we could just look at somebody
[22:57] and go oh was that in the commandments
[23:00] you know brother vincent what would
[23:01] jesus do and all of a sudden i could
[23:02] just nail him down and go
[23:04] obviously you don't love him i don't
[23:05] care what your bumper sticker says
[23:07] and we could really nail somebody down
[23:09] but jesus isn't kind of throwing out
[23:11] their
[23:11] sword for us to wield on other people
[23:13] but he's saying if you
[23:15] i will send you the comforter
[23:18] and if you love me you'll keep my
[23:19] commandments and since you love me and
[23:21] want to keep my commandments i'm going
[23:22] to send you the comforter
[23:23] and you have this requirement to keep my
[23:25] word and he wants to end it again with
[23:26] saying
[23:27] i'm going to send you the holy ghost
[23:28] which is the comforter and he'll remind
[23:30] you and he'll teach you and he'll guide
[23:32] you and he'll comfort you
[23:33] so let's not be fearful and worry and so
[23:36] he provides it as a bookend
[23:39] and so he's going to send the comforter
[23:41] and i'm going to admit that i went to
[23:43] great lengths to be sure that i had the
[23:45] greek just right
[23:46] when i say it right because if it's
[23:47] going to get called out in a church in
[23:49] the message it can get
[23:50] called out in this one and maybe they're
[23:52] so kind they wouldn't mention it but
[23:53] they would kind of scoff at how
[23:54] horribly i butchered the greek on this
[23:57] and i wanted maybe just to say it in the
[23:59] english or maybe even texas
[24:00] texan but it's the perak clatos
[24:04] we may say paracletos maybe in texas
[24:07] but the peralt claytos is the word
[24:10] that's used in the greek
[24:12] and this is the the strict translation
[24:14] of the greek it's called
[24:16] it means to be called to one side to be
[24:19] summoned to one's aid
[24:21] so comforter in the scripture and the
[24:23] original word that's used in the
[24:25] uh in the greek and the the word that
[24:27] was used in the writing of this and the
[24:29] inspiration of it is one who is a helper
[24:31] one who is an aide one who is an
[24:33] assistant
[24:34] and it's used and you have to be careful
[24:36] not to attach this meaning
[24:39] too strictly to certain certain things
[24:41] in certain offices and certain
[24:43] dispensations
[24:44] but it's one who's an intercessor an
[24:45] interpleader one who's going to
[24:46] interject
[24:48] and intervenes in a situation so
[24:50] intercessor we can immediately begin to
[24:52] think about
[24:52] the the role of christ or how the high
[24:54] priest would intercede
[24:56] and we can start to really narrow down
[24:57] the scope of what this means but it's
[24:59] one who's going to
[25:00] intervene in a situation and then also
[25:02] be a consoler
[25:04] not just a counselor but an actual
[25:05] consoler and so it's this verbal
[25:07] adjective it's it's something that's
[25:09] trying to convey this idea in the sense
[25:11] of that this one who is going to be a
[25:13] comforter suggests they have the
[25:15] capability to give help
[25:17] they have the willingness and the
[25:18] capability the ability to give help it
[25:20] means to be summoned to one side
[25:23] the para means at one side or side by
[25:25] side put her up
[25:26] i'm by your side i'm side by side clay
[25:29] tossed which means called or invited
[25:31] or divinely employed appointed oh i mean
[25:34] that's kind of
[25:35] there's there's an aisle here if anybody
[25:37] wants to run it it's short so you might
[25:38] have won't have your brakes on
[25:40] but that's exciting to think that it's
[25:42] one
[25:43] you're by my side but you're not just by
[25:45] my side oh look we happen to be in line
[25:47] together
[25:48] divinely appointed to be by your side
[25:50] summoned and invited and caused
[25:52] to be by your side the para by your side
[25:56] but not just
[25:56] by your side by coincidence but it's
[25:59] been called
[26:00] some and invited divinely appointed to
[26:02] be by your side
[26:05] so notice how jesus said in verses 26
[26:08] or actually i want to go to john chapter
[26:10] 15.
[26:11] we'll drop back here in a moment john
[26:12] chapter 15 verses 26 to 27
[26:16] but when the comforter is come whom i
[26:19] will send you unto you from the father
[26:22] even the spirit of truth so as he
[26:24] continues in this discourse
[26:25] the comforter which is the holy spirit
[26:27] is the spirit of truth
[26:29] he shall testify of me and notice
[26:32] and ye shall ye also shall bear witness
[26:36] because you've been with me from the
[26:37] beginning
[26:39] so this is the comforter is going to
[26:41] come in the spirit of truth he shall
[26:42] testify of me
[26:44] and ye shall bear witness because you've
[26:46] been with me from the beginning
[26:48] in verse 26 of john chapter 14 he shall
[26:50] teach you all things and bring all
[26:52] things to remembrance whatsoever things
[26:53] i have said unto you
[26:55] so catch this i want this is the part
[26:57] i'm probably just really cabbaging down
[26:59] on being very specific about
[27:01] it's explicitly the comforters
[27:03] explicitly given to the believers
[27:06] he's actually going so far to say the
[27:07] world can't receive it
[27:09] now think about that so the holy ghost
[27:12] and the spirit of truth and the
[27:14] comforter
[27:14] and we say well it's given specifically
[27:17] explicitly i'd like to say
[27:19] exclusively to the believers now when i
[27:20] say that don't get in your mind
[27:22] a group of people that call themselves
[27:24] believers or
[27:25] attach it to some organization or some
[27:27] group alone we're talking about
[27:28] those that are ordained to life as many
[27:32] as ordained to life
[27:33] believe we're talking about the election
[27:34] of god we're talking about a very real
[27:36] body of jesus christ not just a a
[27:39] nomination that we might give to a group
[27:41] of people
[27:41] it's given exclusively to believers in
[27:44] christ
[27:45] he said he's saying outright the world
[27:47] can't receive it
[27:49] and what he's identifying and we
[27:51] understand this from the language of the
[27:52] message
[27:53] he's identifying the inside teacher to
[27:56] the born again
[27:58] to those that have been born again you
[27:59] have an inside teacher and i know it may
[28:01] seem like i'm not getting anywhere but i
[28:03] actually
[28:03] am and all of a sudden i'm going to look
[28:05] up realize wow we really covered a lot
[28:06] of ground
[28:08] and i'm wanting to come to this point
[28:09] here because this might just be where it
[28:10] starts this watershed
[28:12] a moment to where it starts to really
[28:14] cascade and become very very personal
[28:16] he's talking about a teacher that we
[28:18] have on the inside of us as those who
[28:20] are born again
[28:22] and because we have an inside teacher
[28:25] i'm going to send you the comforter
[28:27] when he comes he's the spirit of truth
[28:28] he's going to testify of me
[28:31] and he's testifying of you where of him
[28:34] inside of you
[28:35] he's an inside witness he's an
[28:37] interpleader
[28:38] he's an intervener he's a counselor he's
[28:41] a comforter he's a teacher
[28:42] he's a guide but where not externally
[28:45] internally
[28:47] and because you have him on the inside
[28:50] and he's
[28:50] inside of you leading you and guiding
[28:52] you then you become
[28:54] witnesses of him the holy ghost
[28:58] just isn't you here kind of in the
[28:59] atmosphere witnessing and testifying
[29:03] but he is he he's an inside teacher
[29:06] and he moves through you and works
[29:08] through you so that you can become
[29:10] witnesses of him
[29:12] in john chapter 16 verse 13. you'll find
[29:14] if you read john 14 15
[29:16] 16 these themes are repeated over and
[29:18] over again he says how be it when he
[29:20] the spirit of truth is come he will
[29:22] guide you into all truth
[29:24] from where the inside for he will not
[29:28] speak of himself
[29:29] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[29:31] he speak and so this actually speaks to
[29:33] even a prophetic office how the spirit
[29:37] of truth is now using
[29:38] one to become your instructor
[29:41] uh your teacher your guide your helper
[29:44] not to lift themselves up but for your
[29:47] benefit and he shall show you things to
[29:49] come
[29:50] the nature of the spirit of truth the
[29:52] nature of
[29:54] the holy ghost or the comforter the
[29:56] parakletos
[29:57] it's that's been given to the believers
[30:00] he is an
[30:00] inner witness
[30:04] for your personal benefit
[30:07] he's an inside teacher for your personal
[30:10] benefit
[30:11] now if you looked at uh the the actual
[30:14] context of the things that
[30:16] jesus is saying in 14 15 16 even his
[30:18] prayer into 17
[30:19] this is he's given this promise to the
[30:21] disciples who very
[30:23] soon will be facing persecution to them
[30:26] it'll be great tribulation
[30:28] they're going to be sought after and
[30:29] they're going to be killed and they're
[30:30] going to be cast down they're going to
[30:31] be stoned
[30:32] so jesus even acknowledging these
[30:34] terrible things that are to come
[30:35] he's making this promise to the
[30:37] disciples who are going to see
[30:39] their teacher their master their messiah
[30:41] leave them
[30:43] permanently and go away and having
[30:46] received this great truth
[30:48] now what are we going to do when we face
[30:49] obstacles and opposition and these
[30:51] things are happening
[30:52] and these things are going to be taking
[30:53] place to us christ is declaring
[30:56] that the role of the spirit is to be an
[30:59] inner testifier to them to be an inner
[31:02] strength to them
[31:04] and i've been with you and i've been
[31:05] walking with you and i've been teaching
[31:06] you i've been guiding you and i've been
[31:08] helping you
[31:09] uh uh sell out to this truth by
[31:11] performing miracles and doing things we
[31:13] say we know that god is with you
[31:15] but i'm going to leave and when i leave
[31:17] you need to do
[31:18] everything i said but i'm not just going
[31:20] to leave you alone to do everything i
[31:22] said
[31:23] i'm going to send you a comforter and
[31:25] he's not just going to be even like me
[31:27] telling you what to do externally but
[31:29] he's going to dwell on the inside of you
[31:31] so that when you face
[31:32] trials and tribulations and persecutions
[31:35] and great pressure
[31:36] and even your own weakness and your
[31:38] thoughts and in your body and your mind
[31:40] he's gonna be on the inside of you
[31:42] saying you can do it you can make it
[31:44] you've got this you're the bride of
[31:45] jesus christ you are my disciples you
[31:47] are my elect
[31:48] you are the very ones who've got the
[31:50] truth for your hour you can make it you
[31:52] can do it and be the very one that
[31:54] upholds the stephen in the midst of
[31:56] stoning and can look into the heavens
[31:58] and willingly give his life he didn't do
[32:00] it on his own strength he did it by the
[32:02] inner testifier
[32:05] he did it by strength that he had on the
[32:07] inside of him
[32:09] a support on the inside not a support
[32:12] group on the outside
[32:14] the support on the inside so it is in
[32:17] the context of a hateful spiteful world
[32:20] that jesus says the comforter will
[32:22] testify
[32:23] not to the world but to you
[32:27] even to the point where he says you know
[32:28] what if you're going to get called onto
[32:29] the carpet and you're going to have to
[32:30] give an answer don't worry what you say
[32:31] to your adversary
[32:33] don't worry what you say to the enemy
[32:34] because the holy spirit will tell you
[32:36] what to do
[32:37] how from the inside giving them
[32:40] confidence in the midst of a dark time a
[32:42] tribulation and trials you have an
[32:44] inside teacher
[32:45] you have an inside comfort he calls him
[32:47] the comforter which is the spirit of
[32:48] truth which is the holy ghost
[32:51] he is the peraltas
[32:54] then if we look again at our text first
[32:56] john chapter 2 verse 1 and if any man
[32:58] sin
[32:59] we have an advocate with the father
[33:02] jesus christ the righteous
[33:04] would it be any surprise to you to find
[33:07] that advocate
[33:08] is the same greek word pero clatos
[33:12] it is used five times in the scriptures
[33:14] and it's translated to comforter
[33:15] and then advocate it's the very same
[33:18] office
[33:19] the very same thing so you say ah that
[33:21] was a that was a trick brother aaron if
[33:22] you'd have just told us in the beginning
[33:23] that
[33:24] advocate was the same as comforter we
[33:25] would know that john was using his notes
[33:28] from that sermon in john chapter 14. we
[33:30] would have figured that out without your
[33:31] help
[33:32] but here john is using this language in
[33:35] john
[33:35] 1 john chapter 2 which lines up with
[33:38] john chapter 14
[33:39] as the same one the very same thing 15
[33:42] and 16.
[33:43] we have an advocate we have the
[33:45] proclaimtos with us
[33:48] it means one who pleads another's cause
[33:51] it's and it's used in this sense like
[33:53] specifically before a tribunal or before
[33:55] a an inquisition or before a judge
[33:59] and and there's a there's kind of a
[34:02] judicial sense that's given to it and
[34:03] you say oh that's real self-serving
[34:04] brother aaron since you're a lawyer
[34:06] on the weekdays but no it doesn't even
[34:08] mean that it doesn't have to exclusively
[34:11] mean
[34:11] just an attorney but it can just mean
[34:13] someone of influence
[34:16] someone of certain power and prestige
[34:18] someone with some authority
[34:19] that steps in on your behalf before the
[34:21] tribunal
[34:22] and says hey i want to speak on their
[34:24] behalf
[34:25] i want to say something for them so it's
[34:28] not just somebody who has this official
[34:30] title and capacity before the judge
[34:32] though if you want to type it that way
[34:33] we can certainly type it that way
[34:35] but the word has such greater depth and
[34:37] meaning just to narrow it down
[34:39] and i think that's instructive to us to
[34:41] begin to understand
[34:42] what our advocacy is as the bride of
[34:44] jesus christ
[34:46] to be an advocate it's one who defends
[34:48] or maintains a cause
[34:51] one that supports an interest or
[34:53] promotes a cause
[34:55] of a group or just a a particular cause
[34:59] that's what an advocate is the comforter
[35:02] the spirit of truth
[35:03] the holy ghost
[35:07] it is our at he is our advocate that's
[35:10] what comforter is he's an advocate
[35:12] so it's not just one who pat you on the
[35:14] back right we think confidence oh you
[35:16] bored weak dirty sinner it's okay
[35:19] i mean it's almost what we think a
[35:21] comforter is like he's our weighted
[35:22] blanket to help us in our anxiety
[35:25] and that's not what it is even though
[35:27] those things sound really really awesome
[35:28] and i've almost bought one many many
[35:30] times so there's maybe a little birthday
[35:31] hint there
[35:33] uh give me my weighted blanket and and
[35:36] though that might have some
[35:37] physiological effect and psychological
[35:39] effect on something natural that's not
[35:41] what he is he's not a comforter
[35:42] like how many comforts do we really need
[35:44] in in arizona i think we need
[35:46] you know the summer comforter just needs
[35:48] to become a sheet
[35:50] but there's these ideas in terms of a
[35:52] comforter we have this idea i'm not
[35:53] thinking comforter's advocate
[35:56] not just a blanket that's laying there
[35:57] on your bed when you want to feel
[35:58] comfortable crank the crank the ac down
[36:00] to 50 this afternoon
[36:01] and get underneath a down comforter
[36:03] that's not what it is the comforter is
[36:05] an advocate
[36:07] one that defends and maintains and
[36:09] teaches and reminds
[36:11] leads and guides and john is saying
[36:13] jesus christ the righteous is joined to
[36:15] us
[36:16] through the indwelling of the holy ghost
[36:18] through the indwelling of the holy ghost
[36:19] we have access to
[36:20] these things that jesus christ has
[36:22] purchased for us and it forms this
[36:24] unbroken continuity
[36:26] between the believer and god through the
[36:29] indwelling of the holy ghost i want you
[36:30] to think of it that way it's just a
[36:32] picture that i can only just begin to
[36:33] try to describe as i view it
[36:35] that because you are born again you have
[36:38] the holy ghost on the inside of you
[36:40] and then that's what forms this union to
[36:42] god
[36:43] through jesus christ through the price
[36:45] that was paid you have this connection
[36:47] and contact with god
[36:49] and and you have to understand this is
[36:50] something that's unbroken
[36:52] this is something that is permanent this
[36:54] is something that is maintained by the
[36:55] word of truth
[36:56] this is something that you have so that
[36:58] we don't just feel like we're christians
[36:59] that are visiting the confessional every
[37:01] sunday
[37:02] we just don't view that this is
[37:04] something that i just i make myself
[37:06] i kind of work my way around to this
[37:08] place where sometimes i feel good with
[37:09] god
[37:10] no because you are born again you have
[37:12] this continuity with god
[37:14] that you have access to all the time as
[37:16] a believer
[37:20] and so this comforter the comforter is
[37:24] your advocate now let me say this as i
[37:27] choose to maybe i'm desiring to maybe
[37:29] end on this thought
[37:31] but we know that this is an unbroken
[37:34] continuity
[37:35] but we don't always feel that it is and
[37:38] that's what john's dealing with
[37:40] he said you shouldn't live you shouldn't
[37:42] live in this idea of up and down
[37:44] and in and out and you know good enough
[37:47] bad enough there
[37:48] there should be you have a you have a
[37:50] you come to a place where you understand
[37:52] to know
[37:52] that this is permanent this is of god
[37:54] this is for real this is
[37:56] this is everything i need this is this
[37:58] is real
[37:59] i'm connected to this i'm tied to this
[38:01] and come to a place that when you don't
[38:03] feel it you feel
[38:04] awful you feel miserable and you feel
[38:05] weak and you're doubting you just even
[38:07] confess it well
[38:08] i know that's how i feel right now but
[38:10] deep down on the inside i know it's not
[38:12] true
[38:13] i mean that's what you do sometimes i
[38:16] think maybe we look at
[38:17] certain christians and we're like man
[38:18] their faith is so strong and they're so
[38:20] powerful and
[38:21] they always confess the right things and
[38:23] we kind of translate that to mean they
[38:25] don't feel anything else
[38:28] and that's not true it's just they
[38:31] they're just like you they work through
[38:32] it and they work through it enough time
[38:33] and a believer goes through enough
[38:34] battles to where finally
[38:35] they're in the middle of world war 4
[38:37] thousand for them and it seems like
[38:39] everything's lost this is going to end
[38:40] the worst way possible like oh well you
[38:42] know what i'm looking on 3999 victories
[38:45] so got to be the same in this one
[38:48] we never lost yet and so they're not
[38:51] denying the fact that it's horrible
[38:53] they're not denying the fact that
[38:54] they're in pain they're not defined
[38:55] denying the fact that
[38:56] they're weak and that this is awful and
[38:58] they're not they don't even know a way
[39:00] out but they've learned and they've and
[39:02] they have this conviction
[39:03] that though there may be a lot of things
[39:05] that intervene
[39:06] in in my emotions in my spirit at the
[39:09] end of the day
[39:10] there's one that intercedes there's one
[39:12] that intervenes there's one that
[39:14] interpleads
[39:15] and you summoned to my aid against all
[39:18] my other thoughts
[39:19] against all my other feelings and said
[39:21] can i just testify for a moment
[39:23] against your doubt testify against your
[39:25] imagination testify against your pain
[39:28] testify against your history testify
[39:30] against your complexes
[39:31] and you stand there and say i'll take
[39:33] that witness
[39:35] and your complex says i don't know if
[39:36] you really should do that you've had 46
[39:38] years of this experience you say well
[39:40] i know i know it's very real i get you
[39:42] but i'm going to take his word for it
[39:44] i have an inner pleater i'm so glad that
[39:46] when my mind was arguing with itself and
[39:48] i was arguing with my emotions and my
[39:50] doubts and my feelings
[39:51] and my complexes and my fears and my
[39:53] melancholy my depression
[39:54] and we were all kind of conspiring and
[39:56] arguing and going through it all of a
[39:57] sudden the holy ghost kind of stepped
[39:59] and said excuse me i got something to
[40:00] say about this
[40:03] from the inside and said i want to weigh
[40:06] in on this
[40:07] i know you see it i know you feel it i
[40:09] know you hear it i know you smelt it
[40:12] i know you taste it i know you imagine
[40:15] it i know you have affections for it i
[40:17] know you remember it
[40:19] i know you're conscious of it it just
[40:21] goes down the road and calls out all
[40:23] all 10 witnesses and says but i'd like
[40:25] to testify
[40:27] that all is well
[40:31] and it's one that intervenes and you
[40:34] know what he doesn't even just say
[40:35] you're a liar you're a liar you're a
[40:36] liar you're a liar you could say
[40:38] yeah i get it i see where you're coming
[40:39] from but where you're wrong
[40:41] is your conclusions on the matter where
[40:43] you're wrong is where this is headed
[40:45] where you're wrong is what this means
[40:46] and stands for us
[40:50] the bride's advocate your advocate
[40:54] in the message what is the holy ghost
[40:55] i'm going to just track through
[40:57] i i took i was reading through this this
[41:00] is the one place that brother branham
[41:02] dealt with it the most significantly
[41:03] on an advocate and so i'm just going to
[41:06] take a number of quotations from that
[41:09] from that sermon i'm going to group them
[41:11] here at the beginning
[41:12] and i want you to know i'm pulling out
[41:14] phrases and if it's not obvious by the
[41:15] way that i've laid it out
[41:17] i apologize but i'm just pulling out
[41:18] particular phrases he says who is that
[41:20] spirit then what is the holy ghost
[41:22] it's christ in you the comforter that's
[41:25] the holy spirit
[41:27] so he becomes the comforter through
[41:28] indwelling in you
[41:30] and he says what is he now notice this
[41:32] language he's using
[41:33] he's a seal he's a sign he's a comforter
[41:37] so the holy ghost is christ the
[41:40] comforter
[41:41] he's a seal he's a sign so you can
[41:43] almost start writing down all these
[41:44] different things that he is
[41:46] then in another place the same sermon
[41:47] what is the holy ghost it's
[41:49] an advocate what is an advocate what
[41:52] does it do make an advocate
[41:54] it has mercy it stands in your place
[41:57] it does things that you can't do it's
[42:00] your perpetuation for your sins
[42:02] it's your righteousness it's your
[42:03] healing it's your life
[42:05] it's your resurrection it's all that god
[42:08] has for you
[42:09] he's an advocate oh my goodness
[42:12] stands in your place it has mercy does
[42:14] things you can't do it's a perpetuation
[42:16] for your sins
[42:17] it's your righteousness it's your
[42:18] healing it's your life it's your
[42:19] resurrection it's all god has for you
[42:21] he's an advocate and where on the inside
[42:27] he says further he is our advocator
[42:30] he says oh how we thank god for that so
[42:32] it's not this is active
[42:34] this is he's our advocator a seal a sign
[42:38] the spirit of life the god of heaven the
[42:40] comforter the life
[42:41] the advocate this is what an advocate
[42:44] is it says later we walk by the power of
[42:47] the spirit who is our
[42:49] true seal our true advocate
[42:52] our true comforter our true sign that we
[42:55] have been born from above
[42:57] peculiar odd people acting funny taking
[42:59] god at his word calling everything else
[43:01] wrong
[43:01] god's words right that's what the holy
[43:03] ghost is
[43:06] why is it that we're peculiar odd people
[43:08] acting funny taking god at his word
[43:09] calling everything else wrong
[43:11] god's word's right how do we do it
[43:12] because the inside guy
[43:15] if he's left up to us a lot of times we
[43:17] just say i don't know
[43:19] right wouldn't we we're just being
[43:20] honest if we're just going by this we
[43:22] say i don't know it sure
[43:23] looks like it could be well but then
[43:25] again i guess after what you just said
[43:26] maybe it's not
[43:28] and we just bounce back and forth but
[43:30] then by the holy ghost we can call those
[43:32] things that are not as though they were
[43:34] by the holy ghost said no i see it i
[43:35] believe it i've got no question this is
[43:37] the truth
[43:38] and we walk by it a seal a sign
[43:42] a life
[43:45] he says in one place this advocate seal
[43:48] promise
[43:50] so the bride's advocate is a lot of
[43:52] things
[43:54] one thing but it does a lot of things
[43:57] and when john says that we have an
[44:00] advocate with the father
[44:02] jesus christ the righteous it's
[44:06] important to realize that in the context
[44:07] that he's saying this
[44:09] he's not an advocate that we might
[44:11] obtain righteousness
[44:13] or wash our sins away because that's
[44:16] already been accomplished through jesus
[44:17] christ and by the new birth
[44:19] right so he's not creating this scenario
[44:21] where we always have to be reborn again
[44:25] and that we beat ourselves down and says
[44:26] oh well you just need to be born again
[44:27] again again again
[44:29] like you're right i never thought about
[44:30] that again again again again again
[44:33] it was an old man named michael finnegan
[44:36] he got born again and again again over
[44:38] and over and over and we all live in the
[44:39] michael finnegan life
[44:40] and we gotta grow it right back again
[44:42] why i got the wind blew off my board
[44:44] again experience i got to give you one
[44:45] again again again
[44:46] that's not how we ought to live john is
[44:48] saying that you we as children born of
[44:50] god
[44:50] born by the truth we have an advocate
[44:53] but not so that we are constantly
[44:55] re obtaining and reobtaining
[44:57] righteousness or constantly having
[44:59] our justification re-secured those
[45:01] things have been secured through jesus
[45:02] christ
[45:03] by the new birth
[45:06] and then his life as he said in chapter
[45:08] one places us in the light
[45:10] as god himself is in the light and that
[45:12] we have this
[45:13] we have this indwelling of the holy
[45:15] spirit but to keep our
[45:17] fellowship with him to keep this
[45:21] harmony with him to keep this unbroken
[45:24] communion
[45:25] we have an advocate to keep us in this
[45:28] state of
[45:29] sensitivity to god and this awareness of
[45:31] the things of god
[45:32] we have an advocate and listen if you
[45:36] don't catch anything else i've said
[45:37] today besides michael finnegan
[45:40] and this i want you to catch this catch
[45:43] this
[45:43] he is an advocate not because god is
[45:46] temperamental
[45:49] he's an advocate not because his grace
[45:51] is temporary
[45:53] okay i'll shine the light on you whoa
[45:55] wait a minute
[45:56] or i forgive you whoa wait a minute
[45:59] you're just oh just said i don't know
[46:01] about that
[46:02] are we not justified does that not mean
[46:06] we never did it in the first place
[46:09] and then even with that that the seed of
[46:11] that revelation in our hearts and the
[46:13] and the triumph that it brings we still
[46:15] walk in dry places and we wonder if
[46:17] god's angry at us and we wonder if we've
[46:19] made a mistake and
[46:20] how that'll change everything and we can
[46:22] live in a place where things can
[46:23] we begin to get alienated from god so
[46:25] when he says we have an advocate
[46:27] it's not because god is temperamental
[46:29] it's not because his grace is temporary
[46:31] it's because he knows that we're humans
[46:34] and humans are prone to certain thought
[46:36] processes
[46:36] and humans have a weakness and we can be
[46:38] driven to do things we don't want to do
[46:40] so we have an advocate to say don't
[46:42] worry god still loves you
[46:45] don't worry you haven't send away his
[46:47] grace don't worry god isn't angry with
[46:49] you all of a sudden
[46:50] that was placated in jesus christ on the
[46:53] cross
[46:54] and when you acknowledged your sins and
[46:55] were born again and filled with the holy
[46:57] ghost
[46:58] that settled that forever
[47:01] forever settled
[47:05] so the advocate i want you to catch the
[47:07] deeper meaning of it
[47:10] it's not i guess if i make a huge
[47:11] mistake he can work my way back and work
[47:14] me back into the body of christ no it's
[47:16] working in a different realm
[47:18] in the message what is the holy ghost he
[47:20] says that's what the holy ghost is
[47:22] it's a power it's a seal
[47:26] and i noticed uh when i was typing this
[47:28] up i had
[47:29] typed out what is the holy ghost and i
[47:31] said what is the holy host
[47:33] and uh and and i want to thank phoenix
[47:35] christian
[47:36] fellowship for being the holy host today
[47:39] and he says that's what the holy ghost
[47:40] is it's a power
[47:41] it's a seal it's a comforter it's a
[47:44] power
[47:45] it's a seal it's a comforter it's an
[47:47] advocate it's a sign
[47:49] oh my it's the assurance that god has
[47:52] received you
[47:55] and and and you he doesn't receive you
[47:57] then give you back
[47:59] god has no return policy glory
[48:03] he's not going to receive you then
[48:04] return you i bought you i don't want you
[48:05] to return you
[48:06] that's not a doctrine to condemn anybody
[48:08] in particular who has a return ministry
[48:11] but it's to understand that if he's
[48:12] received you he's received you
[48:14] he doesn't need to keep the receipt he
[48:16] doesn't need to check the warranty
[48:18] he doesn't need to inspect you he
[48:20] receives you as you are
[48:22] it knows that you're perfect that you'll
[48:23] serve his purpose and he has not
[48:25] hedged and kept the receipt he will

[48:33] you
[48:35] god went to the pawn shop bought you
[48:38] back and he said do you need the receipt
[48:39] he says nope i'm keeping it

[48:47] he said i'm keeping it the proof of
[48:48] purchase is for us
[48:51] receipts for our sake as far as god's
[48:53] concerned
[48:54] he gives you the holy ghost as the
[48:56] receipt he gives you the holy ghost as
[48:58] the proof of purchase

[49:22] holy spirit

[50:05] that it's yours
[50:08] and because of that this is where i want
[50:11] to transition
[50:14] in into this that more of the dynamic
[50:16] where we begin to relate to it more
[50:17] personally
[50:19] the holy ghost can be summoned as your
[50:21] supporter

[50:25] door to all things it's the assurance
[50:26] that god has received you

[50:36] healed yes you can have peace yes you
[50:38] can be at rest

[50:44] and he's there to assist you to lead you
[50:48] to comfort you to guide you and i don't
[50:50] mean this disrespectfully to cheer you
[50:52] on
[50:54] he's your biggest cheerleader he's your
[50:56] biggest fan
[50:58] if you kind of looked at this that god's
[50:59] like this judge in a talent contest
[51:02] just waiting to hit the buzzer and kick
[51:03] you off the stage and send in the
[51:05] sandman and pull you off
[51:07] i this is you know late night at the
[51:08] apollo or whatever
[51:10] i know the crowd may boo me and they may
[51:12] want to kick me off the stage that's not
[51:13] that's not what's happening god is there
[51:17] as your supporter
[51:18] he's your hype man he's cheering you on
[51:20] he's there to encourage you
[51:22] he's there to tell you you can do it
[51:23] he's there to help you
[51:25] make it now paragraph 62 of what is the
[51:30] holy ghost
[51:31] he said how we could go into the details
[51:33] of that and break that down
[51:35] of how that win
[51:39] it makes intercession for our ignorance
[51:43] this is so beautiful we can just kind of
[51:45] let this sink in
[51:47] sometimes when we got the holy ghost
[51:50] we ignorantly stagger into something can
[51:53] i get a hearty amen
[51:55] i mean i don't even need to ask you if
[51:57] you believe it you really just need to
[51:58] say it
[51:59] right sometimes even when we have the
[52:02] holy ghost we ignorantly stagger into
[52:04] something
[52:06] now what would we think even i mean
[52:08] maybe maybe based upon
[52:10] our path in life we might think that
[52:11] when we ignorantly stagger into
[52:13] something
[52:13] the holy ghost is going to what smack us
[52:15] on the back of the head and call us
[52:17] fools right you know you idiot
[52:20] you should have known better no notice
[52:22] what he says the holy spirit's there to
[52:24] make
[52:24] advocate for us i'm filled with the
[52:28] holiest i'm a child of god i do
[52:29] something a child of god shouldn't have
[52:30] done
[52:31] the holy ghost is there as an advocate
[52:33] he's our advocator
[52:35] he stands there he's our attorney amen
[52:37] he stands there and pleads for us
[52:39] he don't plead for ourselves we don't
[52:41] plead for ourselves because the holy
[52:43] ghost in us pleads for us
[52:45] the holy spirit given utterance
[52:47] sometimes with words you can't
[52:48] understand
[52:49] and he makes intercessions for us
[52:52] not in the sense of uh interceding for
[52:55] salvation
[52:56] but now it's one who has been the
[52:58] recipient and the beneficiary of
[52:59] salvation
[53:00] now he stands there in a very specific
[53:02] office to help us
[53:04] to help us in a time of need
[53:07] and listen i i don't i don't want you to
[53:10] completely dramatize it to the point
[53:12] for the holy ghost is arguing with god
[53:14] for god not to destroy you
[53:16] please give him another chance don't
[53:18] strike him with lightning that's not
[53:19] what's happening
[53:20] it's for us that's what the holy ghost
[53:23] is when i walk into anything
[53:25] i walk like a little kid you walk like a
[53:27] little fellow we're walking in a dark
[53:29] world full of enemies think about the
[53:31] grace
[53:33] this is the grace that he's extending to
[53:34] the elect we're walking in a dark world
[53:36] full of enemies full of sin full of
[53:38] traps full of everything
[53:40] you say oh i'm afraid to take a
[53:42] christian life i'm afraid to do this i'm
[53:44] afraid i'll do this
[53:46] don't be afraid we have an advocate
[53:49] don't be afraid we have an advocate amen
[53:51] oh he
[53:52] stands by us he's in us and he makes
[53:55] intercessions for us the holy spirit
[53:58] constantly
[53:59] constantly making an advocate for us all
[54:01] the time
[54:03] what is the what is the picture brother
[54:05] rams trying to paint we live in a dark
[54:07] world full of enemies full of sin full
[54:08] of traps full of
[54:09] everything the holy spirit is our
[54:12] advocate in the face of temptation
[54:14] our holy spirit is our advocate in the
[54:16] face of an accusing mind
[54:17] our holy spirit is an advocate even when
[54:20] we make mistakes
[54:21] he says we walk ignorantly sometimes a
[54:24] holy spirit-filled person
[54:25] can be driven to do minor things that he
[54:27] or she doesn't want to do
[54:29] yes yes oh my yes sir yes we can do
[54:32] things that we know that we shouldn't do
[54:34] and when we do that we have an advocate
[54:36] and it's not so much
[54:38] that he's arguing with god to not judge
[54:40] you but he's arguing against your mind
[54:42] that tries to condemn you
[54:43] he argues against the doubt that's in
[54:45] you he argues against the voice of satan
[54:48] that says a son or daughter of god
[54:49] would never do that and tries to tell
[54:51] you're not elect tries to tell you that
[54:53] you've sinned away the day of grace
[54:54] that's how he's an advocate
[54:57] until we achieve the goal until we meet
[54:59] the mark until we obtain our destiny
[55:02] we have an advocate who's there
[55:04] encouraging us
[55:05] not telling god to stay his judgments
[55:08] but on the inside encouraging you to
[55:10] make it
[55:12] jesus christ is not your adversary
[55:16] nor is god your adversary that needs
[55:17] placating
[55:19] right i think sometimes we do that
[55:21] within families all right let me go talk
[55:23] to mom i'll
[55:24] you know if i talk to her maybe she
[55:26] won't get us angry
[55:28] or dad can you talk to mom things are
[55:30] getting crazy
[55:31] i think we're going to get grounded
[55:32] forever and you need someone to kind of
[55:34] go and talk to the boss
[55:36] and it maybe works the other way around
[55:37] in our house but like we need jesus
[55:40] jesus will you get in there and talk to
[55:43] god
[55:45] he's he's mad at us again she's like
[55:48] what did you do this time
[55:50] well i mean i just doubted a little bit
[55:52] but i can tell he's angry
[55:53] i mean i may lose my job and things are
[55:56] upset and
[55:58] okay fine i'll go talk to him that's not
[56:00] it
[56:02] it's not at all he finds you over there
[56:05] discouraged i knew i shouldn't have
[56:06] doubted and i shouldn't done this and i
[56:07] think i'm gonna lose my job
[56:08] and he starts speaking to you you're
[56:10] okay son
[56:12] you're okay daughter god's not gonna
[56:14] punish you
[56:16] listen even if you have to take a few
[56:17] stripes for doing something you
[56:18] shouldn't do even if you reap what you
[56:19] sow
[56:20] god has a way to take even those things
[56:22] that you sow add them to something else
[56:24] that he sows and make something good out
[56:25] of it so don't worry about it
[56:27] don't yeah hey if you made a mistake you
[56:29] do the sin and you do the repenting if
[56:30] you do the sow and you do the reaping
[56:32] but don't worry
[56:32] it doesn't change your eternal status
[56:34] with god it doesn't change the fact that
[56:35] he loves you he's still happy with you
[56:37] and he god our advocate is not there
[56:40] advocating with our adversary who's
[56:42] angry with us
[56:44] peter says be sober be vigilant because
[56:46] your adversary the devil
[56:49] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[56:51] whom he may devour our adversary is the
[56:53] devil
[56:54] our worst enemy is our flesh
[56:57] and so if we need an advocate it's not
[56:59] with a god who's our adversary or with
[57:01] the god who hates us or a god who's
[57:03] angry with us
[57:04] it's with ourselves
[57:07] in luke chapter 2 let me you you might
[57:09] even remember this statement brother bam
[57:10] says it a few places
[57:12] i used to think god was angry with me
[57:13] but christ loved me
[57:15] that's how he actually used to view it
[57:17] god's anger with me christ loves me
[57:19] but christ he points this out they're
[57:21] actually one of the same and christ was
[57:23] god's means of reconciling you to
[57:25] himself why because he wanted the
[57:27] reconciling
[57:28] he wanted the peace he wanted the joy he
[57:31] wanted the happiness
[57:32] it's something that he wanted for
[57:33] himself so he provided christ
[57:35] that he would no longer have to judge
[57:37] you
[57:38] so it's not an angry god and christ is
[57:41] there saying oh
[57:42] please stop no he loves you and he uses
[57:45] christ
[57:45] as his access to your heart
[57:49] so god's not angry with you and christ
[57:50] loves you that oh we have an advocate
[57:52] because god can be angry
[57:53] with us at a drop of a dime do you
[57:55] realize that satan uses that because
[57:57] that's the dynamics that we experienced
[57:58] in natural relationships
[58:00] thought everything was great and all
[58:01] sudden they're mad at me you know what
[58:02] everything was i thought they loved me i
[58:03] thought we were family we thought this
[58:05] or whatever it might be
[58:06] and bad things begin to happen and then
[58:07] you immediately begin to build these
[58:09] complexes and then you think about god
[58:10] and like well i guess one day i can wake
[58:12] up and be blocked
[58:15] i think one day i can wake up and be
[58:16] disinvited or this is gonna happen
[58:17] that's gonna
[58:18] it doesn't work that way with god when
[58:20] that door closes and you think it's god
[58:23] disinviting you think it's god kicking
[58:24] you out of the the chat group or
[58:26] whatever you think it's god
[58:27] um ostracizing you the comforter's there
[58:29] to say god's got something planned here
[58:32] hold steady this is working for good
[58:34] don't you worry god's
[58:35] god's not angry with you if you make a
[58:37] mistake you just need to repent
[58:39] but this is something that you're going
[58:41] to be okay through this
[58:42] because your adversary is not god or
[58:44] jesus christ it's the devil
[58:48] luke chapter 22 verses 31 and 32 and the
[58:50] lord said simon simon
[58:52] behold satan hath desired to have you
[58:54] that he may sift you as we
[58:56] who his adversary but i have prayed for
[58:59] thee
[59:00] that thy faith fail not and when thou
[59:02] art converted
[59:03] strengthen thy brethren that's advocacy
[59:08] he's identified his adversary satan
[59:10] walks about as a roaring lion seeking
[59:12] whom he may devour
[59:13] peter then writes be sober be vigilant
[59:15] because your adversary the devil
[59:16] he knew when he said simon simon your
[59:18] adversary the devil seeks to sift you as
[59:21] wheat
[59:21] and then jesus plays the role of an
[59:23] advocate this is advocacy
[59:25] but i prayed for you i see that the
[59:28] devil would want to trouble you i see
[59:29] that the devil would want to attack you
[59:30] i see that calamity may be trying to
[59:32] threaten you and tear you down
[59:33] but i've prayed for you that's what it
[59:35] means to be an advocate
[59:38] so we have to resist this weakness of
[59:40] our flesh to let
[59:41] either let our mind or let the devil
[59:43] make god your enemy
[59:46] remember your enemy is anything that's
[59:47] anti-word your enemy is never the word
[59:51] and therefore christ is your advocate
[59:54] god is your advocate he wants you to
[59:56] succeed
[59:57] he wants you to do well he wants you to
[59:59] meet the mark
[1:00:00] he's not just throwing a bunch of road
[1:00:02] blocks up there in traps
[1:00:04] to see if he'll stumble he says in what
[1:00:07] is the holy ghost this will just be
[1:00:09] kind of a concluding thought i did just
[1:00:11] three quotations a couple scriptures
[1:00:16] he says what is he the one who comes in
[1:00:20] you
[1:00:21] gives you peace your sign your comforter
[1:00:24] comforted at rest sealed how are you
[1:00:27] it's a sign
[1:00:28] the world knows something's happened to
[1:00:30] you what is it
[1:00:32] it's a comforter doesn't mean the
[1:00:34] world's always going to agree that it's
[1:00:35] god
[1:00:36] but they know they'll see it what is it
[1:00:40] a seal you are at rest it's your
[1:00:44] advocate
[1:00:46] if something happens to you there's
[1:00:49] something there to make an
[1:00:50] advocate for you right quick making
[1:00:52] intercessions
[1:00:55] an advocate making intercessions
[1:00:58] as we walk in a dark world full of
[1:01:00] enemies full of sins full of traps
[1:01:02] full of everything as children of god
[1:01:05] that sometimes
[1:01:06] ignorantly stagger into something as
[1:01:09] jesus
[1:01:10] admonished his disciples you're going to
[1:01:11] go from here and you're going to be
[1:01:12] tested you're going to be
[1:01:14] hunted down you're going to be
[1:01:15] persecuted but i've prayed for you
[1:01:19] i send you the comforter
[1:01:22] we have an advocate how long is this
[1:01:25] advocate how long is that advocate there
[1:01:29] is even the advocate temperamental
[1:01:33] as the advocate here look i'm here as
[1:01:35] long as the retainer is good
[1:01:38] right as long as you keep the retainer
[1:01:40] stocked up i'm here no this is
[1:01:42] he's an advocate he's been divinely
[1:01:44] appointed to age you
[1:01:46] if there's any distance or alienation
[1:01:48] it's it's you cause
[1:01:51] not him saying enough's enough i'm sorry
[1:01:53] i'm out of here you cause it
[1:01:56] notice what it says in hebrews chapter
[1:01:57] 10 verses 14 to 17. i think this is so
[1:02:00] beautiful
[1:02:00] when we think of terms of how he says
[1:02:03] and if we sin
[1:02:05] we have an advocate with the father
[1:02:08] jesus christ the righteous for by one
[1:02:11] offering he hath perfected forever them
[1:02:13] that are sanctified
[1:02:15] by one offering once he's perfected
[1:02:18] forever
[1:02:19] them that are sanctified do you believe
[1:02:20] you're sanctified if sanctified then you
[1:02:22] are
[1:02:23] scripturally sanctified means you are
[1:02:24] perfected forever
[1:02:26] if you're justified you're glorified
[1:02:28] because he whom he's justified
[1:02:30] he is glorified these are permanent
[1:02:32] markers
[1:02:33] for the elect we don't have to live in
[1:02:36] the judas track well i could be a judas
[1:02:38] that comes all the way up to it no that
[1:02:39] doesn't exist for you it's not possible
[1:02:41] for you
[1:02:42] this is a different different scriptural
[1:02:44] promise so
[1:02:45] with that heavy statement by one
[1:02:48] offering he have perfected forever them
[1:02:50] that are sanctified i'm sanctified and
[1:02:52] perfected forever
[1:02:53] wow that creates this perception in this
[1:02:55] label so he says whereof the holy ghost
[1:02:58] also is a witness
[1:03:00] to us not a witness to the world a
[1:03:03] witness to us
[1:03:04] he hath by one offering perfected
[1:03:06] forever them that are sanctified
[1:03:08] and in light of this great calling and
[1:03:10] significant calling he gives us the holy
[1:03:12] ghost as an
[1:03:13] inside witness an inside testifier an
[1:03:15] inside comforter an
[1:03:17] inside advocator for after that he had
[1:03:20] said before
[1:03:21] this is the covenant that i will make
[1:03:23] with them after those days saith the
[1:03:24] lord
[1:03:25] i will put my laws into their hearts and
[1:03:28] in their minds will i write them
[1:03:30] and their sins and iniquities will i
[1:03:32] remember no more
[1:03:34] and the message perfection he says until
[1:03:36] when
[1:03:37] perfected forever until you do something
[1:03:39] that's lustful say something that's
[1:03:40] wrong
[1:03:41] be on the outs with your neighbor he
[1:03:42] says perfected
[1:03:44] forever and he spells it out he says
[1:03:47] because if you make a mistake
[1:03:48] watch the next verse what's the next
[1:03:51] verse in light of a mistake staggering
[1:03:53] into something
[1:03:54] as a believer the holy ghost on the
[1:03:57] inside is a witness
[1:03:58] the holy ghost testifies he said it he
[1:04:01] meant it i'll write the word on the
[1:04:03] inside of the inside
[1:04:05] and your sins and your iniquities will i
[1:04:07] remember no more against you
[1:04:09] my sins passed yes my sins present yes
[1:04:12] my sins future
[1:04:13] yes forgiven forgiven justified
[1:04:15] justified justified
[1:04:19] i mean you can spend the rest of your
[1:04:20] life spending every breath just
[1:04:21] mentioning something mentioning
[1:04:22] something
[1:04:23] justify justify justified don't know it
[1:04:25] don't know it justify justified
[1:04:26] justified
[1:04:26] and you're not going to be able to one
[1:04:28] day thousands of years later come up
[1:04:29] with something he's like
[1:04:30] never thought of that thanks for
[1:04:33] mentioning it
[1:04:35] like eternity's not giving god a chance
[1:04:37] to figure out something you did wrong
[1:04:38] and you need to be cast down to hell
[1:04:40] well we're letting hell continue just in
[1:04:41] case somebody messes up up here
[1:04:44] it's there's no reality to it
[1:04:48] it says this in paragraph 95 of what is
[1:04:50] the holy ghost
[1:04:51] then we find that when we come to him
[1:04:54] for he said hebrews 4
[1:04:55] that has entered into jesus's rest has
[1:04:58] ceased from his worldly works as god did
[1:05:00] from his
[1:05:01] when he made the world to never return
[1:05:03] to it again
[1:05:04] how long how long are you sealed by the
[1:05:07] holy
[1:05:08] ghost until the day of your redemption
[1:05:12] it can't the seal can't be broken how
[1:05:14] long until the day of your redemption
[1:05:16] that's the rest comfort advocate seal
[1:05:20] deliver you have an advocate
[1:05:24] when we wrestle with our mistakes and
[1:05:26] our weaknesses we wrestle with things
[1:05:28] then we we we can open up our hearts to
[1:05:31] this
[1:05:32] advocator
[1:05:35] because it says in ephesians chapter 4
[1:05:36] verse 30 this is where brother brown has
[1:05:38] drawn this from
[1:05:39] grieve not the holy spirit of god oh so
[1:05:42] he can be grieved
[1:05:45] grieve not your advocate grieve not your
[1:05:49] comforter
[1:05:51] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:05:52] because you are sealed by it
[1:05:56] you're kept by it you're delivered by it
[1:05:59] you find rest by it you find assistance
[1:06:02] by it you find
[1:06:03] peace by it assurance healing life the
[1:06:05] open door to all things the assurance
[1:06:07] that god has received you
[1:06:09] it's a it's all that god has for you
[1:06:11] it's your advocate it's the holy ghost
[1:06:14] you are sealed by that until the day of
[1:06:16] redemption
[1:06:18] so he says don't grieve it
[1:06:21] now i know that that might kind of seems
[1:06:24] like i kind of maybe opened a door to a
[1:06:26] room like well we need to kind of
[1:06:27] explore this
[1:06:27] we need to how does that all factor in
[1:06:30] it shows he's identifying how that there
[1:06:33] is a dis
[1:06:34] harmony with the advocate
[1:06:37] and it's the advocate that's able to
[1:06:39] keep us in harmony with god our harmony
[1:06:41] with god
[1:06:41] never changes in one sense our standing
[1:06:44] with him
[1:06:44] always the same we may feel like we go
[1:06:46] up and down right
[1:06:47] but our standing in christ is always the
[1:06:49] same the temperamental nature is related
[1:06:52] to our
[1:06:52] human nature and so as we have
[1:06:55] experiences within the flesh
[1:06:57] we can we can change the dynamics that
[1:06:59] we have with the advocate
[1:07:01] and to better understand who the
[1:07:03] advocate is is to encourage us
[1:07:05] is to maintain proper perspective and
[1:07:08] attitude towards it
[1:07:10] it's it's the orientation that we have
[1:07:12] to him that we're
[1:07:14] always in the right line
[1:07:17] i almost say in one sense our altitude
[1:07:18] is never changing
[1:07:20] it's our attitude that changes and the
[1:07:22] pilot can tell you that can make a lot
[1:07:23] of difference
[1:07:26] and i'm going to close on this statement
[1:07:27] and brother mike if you'd like to
[1:07:29] come to the piano listen to how
[1:07:32] brotherham deals with this statement
[1:07:33] grieve not the holy spirit
[1:07:36] the rest the comfort the advocate the
[1:07:38] seal the deliverer
[1:07:39] when you have faith and accept to my
[1:07:41] brother just let that little light begin
[1:07:42] to grow out
[1:07:44] first john chapter 1 taking all the
[1:07:46] roots of doubt and bitterness
[1:07:48] connect it right there to the same
[1:07:49] chapter yielding yourself to the spirit
[1:07:52] then you begin to become a son of god a
[1:07:55] daughter of god begin to grow in the
[1:07:56] grace of god
[1:07:57] the holy spirit begins to build his
[1:07:59] kingdom within you
[1:08:01] this is what's happening to the believer
[1:08:02] when they're born again the holy spirit
[1:08:04] is building his kingdom on the inside of
[1:08:06] you
[1:08:06] he says now if you've grieved that
[1:08:08] spirit somewhere then go
[1:08:10] right back and think in your mind what
[1:08:12] did i start doing
[1:08:13] neglecting church did i start fussing
[1:08:15] with another denomination
[1:08:17] did i start picking on this one doing
[1:08:18] this to my neighbor
[1:08:20] if you did that's what sapped it out
[1:08:24] go say god i'm sorry
[1:08:28] i will go right back and make that thing
[1:08:30] right i will go right
[1:08:32] and do it again then the joy will come
[1:08:34] back to your salvation again
[1:08:39] the holy spirit just flew right up on
[1:08:41] the rafter
[1:08:43] he's ready to fly right back down again
[1:08:46] anytime
[1:08:47] you want him to come back it's not him
[1:08:54] that just gets kind of flighty we might
[1:08:57] all know people that
[1:08:58] and they're talented they're gifted
[1:09:00] they're uh wonderful wonderful
[1:09:03] brothers or sisters maybe even maybe
[1:09:05] within a natural family
[1:09:06] but you just never know where they're
[1:09:08] going to be like well i could i would
[1:09:10] count on them if i knew they were going
[1:09:11] to be there well
[1:09:12] if i knew they would show up they're
[1:09:14] more than capable and that's
[1:09:15] the holy ghost isn't just one of these
[1:09:17] people you wake up one day like where
[1:09:18] did he go
[1:09:19] where did he go he's not answering his
[1:09:20] phone he read it but he's not writing
[1:09:22] back
[1:09:23] now you just need to look in your go
[1:09:25] back in your mind
[1:09:27] and find out what you allowed
[1:09:31] what you have allowed to create the
[1:09:34] distance with your advocate
[1:09:36] what you've allowed to foster this
[1:09:40] complex that he's over there with his
[1:09:41] arms crossed mad at you
[1:09:44] you ever had that situation where two
[1:09:45] people love each other
[1:09:48] two people want to be reconciled two
[1:09:51] people
[1:09:51] hold no bitterness no animosity
[1:09:55] there's no acrimony in each person's
[1:09:57] heart towards each other but they feel
[1:09:58] that the other one does
[1:10:00] right and so they're afraid and they're
[1:10:02] timid and they're reluctant
[1:10:06] and we get that way we get that way to
[1:10:08] the towards the holy ghost
[1:10:10] and since he is a timid he's a dove
[1:10:14] brother brown even in this statement
[1:10:16] says it's the dove leading
[1:10:18] he's watching for you to have that lamb
[1:10:20] nature again
[1:10:22] and all you gotta do is just say i'm
[1:10:23] sorry he says
[1:10:25] because what have you grieved your
[1:10:28] shield what if you grieved your carrier
[1:10:31] he's the one that wants to carry you
[1:10:33] what you grieved is your protector your
[1:10:35] guide
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:38] what you've grieved is your comforter
[1:10:41] you've grieved your advocate
[1:10:45] what you've done is you've impaired his
[1:10:47] ability to advocate on your behalf
[1:10:49] his advocacy is disrupted i trust i'm
[1:10:52] making myself
[1:10:53] clear i i wanted to go to that point to
[1:10:56] bring in this idea
[1:10:57] that you can grieve the advocate so that
[1:10:59] we could understand how sometimes we
[1:11:01] might feel distant
[1:11:02] but let's not place that on his legalism
[1:11:06] let's not place that on his unmitigated
[1:11:09] righteousness
[1:11:10] let's not place that on his justice
[1:11:12] let's just recognize it's
[1:11:14] it's a it's a place within our spirits
[1:11:16] that we allow ourselves to do something
[1:11:18] that we shouldn't do he said did i start
[1:11:19] fussing did i start picking did i start
[1:11:21] doing this and what happens
[1:11:22] our conscience condemns us and that
[1:11:24] creates the separation
[1:11:26] and all we have to do is say i'm sorry i
[1:11:28] i shouldn't have done that i need to
[1:11:30] make it right
[1:11:30] and all of a sudden we find the advocate
[1:11:32] saying that's the right thing that's the
[1:11:33] right thing to do
[1:11:34] i'll help you do it you know what i'm
[1:11:36] actually can start working in their
[1:11:37] hearts to make it easier on you
[1:11:39] and he advocates for you
[1:11:42] he's there waiting to advocate
[1:11:46] he's there waiting to help you
[1:11:49] you just have to want him to come back
[1:11:52] does anybody want the advocate today
[1:11:54] anybody need them to come back won't you
[1:11:56] just invite them back
[1:11:58] say lord i want you back i want your
[1:12:00] advocacy in my life
[1:12:02] i want to feel that that comfort lord
[1:12:05] even in the sense of that weighted
[1:12:07] blanket i want to feel it spiritually
[1:12:09] the teacher he's not giving you a pop
[1:12:12] quiz and see huh you don't know what
[1:12:14] brother adam said in 1957 about the tent
[1:12:16] no no pop quiz he's there to teach you
[1:12:19] what he said about it
[1:12:21] he's there to teach you what those seven
[1:12:22] thunders are he's there to teach you
[1:12:24] about the truth of the seals he's there
[1:12:26] to teach you about the godhead
[1:12:27] he's there not to quiz you to see if
[1:12:29] you'll stumble but he's there to teach
[1:12:31] you
[1:12:31] lead you guide you comfort you even
[1:12:33] protect you
[1:12:35] he's your advocate i would say this
[1:12:38] today there's someone who's never
[1:12:39] received him as an advocate
[1:12:41] if you recognize in the scripture that
[1:12:42] if you've sinned and you receive him
[1:12:44] and you'd want to receive him today
[1:12:46] acknowledging your sin i'd invite
[1:12:48] someone to give their heart to god today
[1:12:50] even to stand to their feet and say i'm
[1:12:51] going to receive you now as my advocate
[1:12:54] i'm asking that i'd be forgiven of my
[1:12:56] sins and i'm coming to you
[1:12:59] asking for the advocate to come to my
[1:13:01] aid
[1:13:03] praise the lord let us stand to our feet
[1:13:06] today
[1:13:11] lord jesus help us
[1:13:15] our gracious heavenly father you
[1:13:18] are our advocate
[1:13:22] it's so wonderful lord to not envision a
[1:13:25] scenario where
[1:13:28] we're in a courtroom where the jury is
[1:13:30] against us and the prosecuting attorney
[1:13:32] is against us and the defense attorney's
[1:13:34] against us and the
[1:13:36] judges against us
[1:13:39] but in that context you have become
[1:13:43] judge jury defending attorney
[1:13:49] against a prosecutor that is our
[1:13:52] adversary
[1:13:55] our own minds prosecute us lord
[1:13:58] it's the devil who's become our who is
[1:14:01] our adversary lord
[1:14:04] and lord it's in that
[1:14:08] wrestling
[1:14:09] [Music]
[1:14:12] it's in that fight
[1:14:15] that you become our attorney
[1:14:18] and judge and jury
[1:14:23] against an accuser
[1:14:27] and lord not only do you defend us
[1:14:29] against the lies of the accuser and
[1:14:30] defend us against the
[1:14:32] traps of this world and the voice of
[1:14:34] laodicea
[1:14:36] but you're a witness to us on the inside
[1:14:39] you are my child i love you
[1:14:44] you are forgiven you're justified
[1:14:47] you are clean you are perfected
[1:14:50] you are glorified you are sanctified
[1:14:54] how long i i i do things that i know i
[1:14:58] shouldn't do
[1:14:58] and i i i make mistakes forever son
[1:15:01] forever
[1:15:03] well how do i know you know because i'm
[1:15:05] telling you
[1:15:06] you know because i'll never leave you
[1:15:08] nor forsake you i'll be with you even in
[1:15:10] you and to the end
[1:15:11] teaching you reminding you encouraging
[1:15:14] you
[1:15:15] carrying you lord i trust that we can
[1:15:19] accept you today as an advocate
[1:15:22] as the advocate not as the world witness
[1:15:24] to the world who argues with sin and
[1:15:26] argues with the
[1:15:27] to convince the unbeliever and re judges
[1:15:30] solely judges the world because their
[1:15:32] unbelief
[1:15:33] but lord you're on the inside
[1:15:36] as the inner teacher
[1:15:40] the inner encourager
[1:15:43] the lifter of our head
[1:15:46] the one that washes our spirits from the
[1:15:48] inside
[1:15:51] the one that takes the word day by day
[1:15:53] and says this is the truth walk in it
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:15:57] the one that every morning when we wake
[1:15:58] up
[1:16:00] has renewed your mercy wanting to remind
[1:16:04] us every morning when we're awake
[1:16:06] see daughter i've renewed his mercies
[1:16:09] for you
[1:16:10] see they're new every morning
[1:16:15] may we accept this inner encourager
[1:16:20] lord i do not say this to draw any
[1:16:21] attention to myself but lord i know that
[1:16:23] this sermon is thus saith the lord
[1:16:26] gave it to me lord you spoke in such a
[1:16:30] clear manner that i knew
[1:16:32] that this is what at least one person
[1:16:35] needed to hear
[1:16:37] they have an advocate
[1:16:41] so much lord our experience with
[1:16:44] advocacy
[1:16:45] and our experience with attorneys and
[1:16:46] our experience with the judicial system
[1:16:50] relates to this adversarial nature of it
[1:16:53] lord even myself i'm very much
[1:16:55] acquainted with the fact that i'm in a
[1:16:56] profession that is built upon
[1:16:59] adversarial representation and defending
[1:17:02] particular interest and looking out
[1:17:03] after
[1:17:04] the needs of your client it's very easy
[1:17:06] to become
[1:17:07] for it to engage in conflict
[1:17:11] and then it becomes adversarial and it
[1:17:13] becomes contentious and pride enters in
[1:17:15] and you become very defensive of certain
[1:17:17] things and
[1:17:18] can just get out of control and we kind
[1:17:20] of impose that upon
[1:17:22] our relationship with you and sense that
[1:17:24] well if the holy ghost is an advocate
[1:17:25] he's an intercessor and he's a
[1:17:27] he's a consoler that somehow he's there
[1:17:30] mediating with you to try to
[1:17:34] cop a deal with you and get us a plea
[1:17:36] agreement or
[1:17:37] probation or get us out of purgatory and
[1:17:40] lord none of that is true at all
[1:17:43] none of that is true
[1:17:47] so father i pray that we would not
[1:17:50] think today in this
[1:17:54] relationship that we have with you
[1:17:56] adversarially
[1:17:58] but to understand
[1:18:01] that you know we love you
[1:18:04] and you know that we want to keep your
[1:18:07] word
[1:18:09] know that we want a body change you know
[1:18:12] that we want healing you
[1:18:13] know that we want reconciliation you
[1:18:15] know that we want deliverance you
[1:18:17] know that we want your word
[1:18:21] and so you gave us a comforter
[1:18:24] to assure us
[1:18:27] that we can have what we need
[1:18:31] you gave us an advocate to
[1:18:35] assure us that all things are ours
[1:18:38] through jesus christ may we accept this
[1:18:42] advocate today i pray
[1:18:44] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:18:46] amen
[1:18:48] accept this advocate today just receive
[1:18:52] it
[1:18:54] received this advocacy
