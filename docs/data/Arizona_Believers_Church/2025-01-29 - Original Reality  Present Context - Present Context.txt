TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hebrews chapter 13 I start with verse 7 verse 7 I think is an important scripture before a very familiar scripture verse 8 and it says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation and the statement that is so familiar to all of us Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever so in this admonishment to remember them that speak unto you the word of God who have some sort of oversight over you it's you're following in their faith or their example because you are considering their testimony the end the results the product of their lives and it leads to this Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you could be seated as you're looking at this title slide and we'll just hold it there uh for a few moments looking at the statement Jesus Christ this same yesterday today and forever I've titled this uh original reality and and maybe phrase that we'll use later is in present context I think I just have it here and and as far as a title for this sermon original reality present context and you could even tell just by the graphic that we have up here of the picture that trying to convey something that would be original something that would be what we would imagined Christ to be even in the beginning uh but yet in a present context because the Bible says he is the same Jesus Christ is the same yeser today today and forever and if we could look at the statement in Christ identified the same in all generations and I believe it was on Sunday that we shared this and uh you'll probably remember this this subject in Christ ident is identified in the same in all generations there's several sermons that brother man preaches in 1964 that build around this and so there's a lot of different things you could go to and listen and he says now what was Jesus the same yesterday today and forever now in answering that question it doesn't give us much details to go by we just know that whatever he was he's going to be the same now if he stood wear here wearing this suit that I got on that he gave me now if the woman is sick could he heal her and he's wanting to look at it from a different angle he's given this example of being in a prayer line as you go through some of these sermons he says look at this picture that we have here this picture's a lot like it was in John chapter 4 and he uses this scene of him being on the platform in those 1964 in these meetings wearing a suit in a modern-day attire and saying if Jesus was here wearing this suit I have on what what could he do and he says could he heal her and he cautions and he says be careful now be careful no he couldn't do it he's already done it and he brings into the scripture he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes we were healed he has already done it now that speaks to an act in the wounding and the bleeding in the giving of his life that Christ it is not necessary for him to come and do that again uh to heal her it's something he's already uh promised so he says the only thing he could do would just identify himself to her is that right and make it known that he's raised from the dead and alive and now that he would identify himself and this goes back to the subject matter on Sunday this title God hidden in profanity and we are using the emphasis that God the word this great God who spans all time and space that it would become a reality in just ordinary everyday life not in uh religion not in pretense not in some glare of another age and I believe I used the statement The Challenge and I think the way that I phrased it and I I hope that it went across the right way I got some tremendous feedback and had good Fellowship on it but I think it was says live Godly enough uh uh to be separate and uh but be human enough uh to be able to be identified or people be able to see it and I thought well maybe the the limiting language to say live live Godly enough wasn't exactly right but it's living Godly as humans that we want to live Godly as human beings in the context of this modern world that that's what our challenge is is to live Godly as humans still being natural beings in this modern world that we're living in and if we could look at this statement this way and I appreciate your attention eness tonight I can tell you just really uh really focused on what it is I'm I'm trying to express brother B says if Jesus Christ was standing here with this suit that I have on now when he says that that orients us to that time period here was April 15th 1964 and the suit begins to frame context of today at that time when he's speaking it it's not a yesterday because he doesn't say if Jesus was standing here in a robe or with crowns or sandals but he says if Jesus Christ was standing here to today with this suit I have on not yesterday not in the future uh he doesn't describe maybe a future attire but it's something in a modern setting and he says he couldn't he says what would he do now because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so he's looking at the present tense he says what would he do now not yesterday and when he mentions the cross he's already paid the price on the cross that references yesterday he shed his blood he gave his life for our healing and our Salvation that's been purchased he did that yesterday and having been done yesterday we have salvation today we have healing today but not through anything that we need to do now to purchase it to accomplish it he just needs to identify himself today and make himself known today to Quicken our faith to believe in those things and one of the themes that brother Bram is using in these different sermons that Christ is identified the same in all generations and then there's several other sermons along these lines I have uh a list of sermons for those who would like like to listen to them or study them or at least maybe search through them or browse through them there's several that fit this uh theme in 1964 but God will he's teaching and I've gone through these sermons just to find these themes God will identify himself in every generation and it's not a matter of recollection and saying oh he was this or he was that uh the Bible would be good enough for historical record but he will identify himself in every age by his character it's not that he comes in the same image brother brandom says in see the discrepancy that Jesus Christ is the same in every detail except the physical body so there's something maybe in what would literally strike the eye that wouldn't necessarily be in the same form that it was yesterday but there's something today that is the same character that it was before he uses this phrase that he would identify himself this is the phrase in a line of the word for that age for the age that they were living in so his character will be the same today in the present world as it was yesterday in history ancient world through the church ages in the Bible his character will be the same today in the present world as it was yesterday in ages gone by and that's why I use this phrase as a title original reality in present context the original reality would be what was manifested what was real what was true what was accurate that that full expression of God and Christ and how it unfolded that first perfect expression now we could we could say that was in Jesus Christ but we could also say all the way back to the beginning whatever that original reality was that was foreshadowed or portrayed that that first expression that original intent of God that character that he displayed being restored today that there's something that comes forth fresh and real and genuine today uh that is an expression of that original re but it's in the present day context one way that we've been emphasizing this is that God is the artist he's the one that creates he's the Creator and you are the creation you are the created so he is the one that is authoring you are the one that he is finishing and the setting that he has placed Us in is this modern world I know we sometimes dream for days gone you know days past and I find myself uh just through my the season of life that I've been in over the last several years as I've tried to go back through my life and piece together certain things and try to maybe answer questions for today and why I am the way that I am and things that have happened and spend a lot of times just trying to piece together my childhood and young uh uh my adolescence and teenage years and young adulthood and there's times where it's like man if you could just go back to that the way things were then and have a little bit different experience based upon where I am now and sometimes we have a Nostalgia for things gone by oh if we could just lived in this time and lived in that time well uh that's not possible right now and so we have to live where we are we're living in this time and age that we're in and being what God has created and being new creatures in Christ Jesus for the time that we're living in now there we have to be able to look at the context of where God is placing us if we were to say wow uh we're we're Before Time even begins and let's say we know the whole story and he says I'm going to send you and you're going to be Noah then we immediately begin to build the context for what our life would look like say well I'm going to be tasked with uh marrying and having these sons and I'm going to have to build an ark and I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and you would have more a very a great catalog if you knew all things of what your life would look like and so art can only be fully appreciated if the context is understood you can really only re appreciate what it is and fully understand it in its proper context if we were just looking at Natural Art you'd want to know uh what time per period it was uh painted in you'd want to even know what his historical period it represents you'd want to know the culture the person that's that was creating it the materials that were used all those things form the context of what you're looking at and what is being portrayed the environment the situation uh or even the atmosphere in which the art was created how it was spread and how one experiences it that all forms one's perception or helps you to understand the art as I've been uh appreciating art more more and more these days and a and wanting to uh learn from it and experience it in a way that it can convey what what the meaning that was intended you find that there's a lot you can learn about the artist that unlocks what you're looking at there's a lot that you learn about where they were when they were painting at the time period And so context is important to be able to fully understand and appreciate what is being created so if we look at ourselves as being the creation then there's things that we want to know about the Creator there's things we want to know about us who's being created and then the context is very important to understand what the artist has in mind for his creation Now if this seems to be somewhat of a uh a you know hard right-and turn here just buckle up or hold tight but let's turn to Titus Chapter 2 and verses 2 to8 and I I remember originally I was going to use this as my text and so maybe there's uh skipping a little bit here but he's speaking about Paul giv his introduction in verse one that he's a servant of God and according to the faith of God's elect and he's telling him but speak thou those things which become sound Doctrine so he's he's admonishing to speak these things which are sound Doctrine and he says that here's the sound Doctrine now if we could start to get a little bit more practical or focus in because zero in a little bit more precisely on what I would say is my thesis statement through these first several services this year and what is meant by this original reality it's real we may not and let's say it's hidden it's a mystery that is going to be expressed in present context and what would it look like if this original reality begin to manifest itself and unfold itself where we are today this zeros in a little bit on what I mean by this here as he is expounding teaching that he should have sound Doctrine this is what you should teach and these are the things that are taught that the Aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith and charity in patience the aged women likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not giving to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed young men likewise exhort to be sober minded in all things showing thyself a good pattern excuse me showing thyself a pattern of good Works in Doctrine showing uncorrupt this gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you that's a a mouthful a lot there there's so many things there that uh we could begin to focus in on in uh great detail very granular as it applies to aged men aged women young men young ladies and and in all so there's a lot here that we could look at so I'm going to take this I took it this week and was studying each one of these things and trying to put it in maybe a modern context or language I just want to do it very very fast that if we are to look at this today he would say that the men ought to be learning to be self-controlled to exhibit uh you know a strong uh self-control control your emotions control your behavior that they be in the habit of Good Deeds that they be they have integrity and dignity in their way that they speak that they're honest in their disagreements with others so that the adversary the one with which they have a disagreement or on the contrary part has no cause to speak evil these are things that young men ought to be learning because you're to exhort them to be self-controlled in the habit of Good Works have integrity and dignity in the in the way that you speak and handle situations if there be some contention or disagreement be honest so that those that you have a disagreement with and some could say those who are disbelievers or be of the opposition you're not giving them a reason to speak evil that we we are going to give people reason to disagree with us whether we put it in the context of being Believers or not people will disagree but you can handle disagreement you could handle variance in such a way to where they're not just saying he's wrong and I disagree with them they say they're evil they're Liars they're condescending they're they don't know how to handle adversity so there's these are the things that you're to teach young men or that young men and I'd say to Rowan and Elliot and Preston the different ones here these are things that they ought to be learning now so that the character that results is what he said that men ought to be these aged men they would demonstrate self-control this is their character now they would be honest they would have strong faith they would have an unselfish love and they'd be patient so there's things that you should be teaching young men and these are the things that they're learning so that when they become aged and whatever that would mean they would have this kind of character they're they're disciplined they show self-control they're honest they have a strong faith they have an unselfish love and they're patient that's the image of how young men are to be taught and this is the character that results from that teaching then to the women so the young women are to be learning how to love uh their husband and children this is something that ought to be taught something that they take have these young ladies to be learning is to to do these things to be self-controlled pure Homemakers good submitted to their own husbands so that the word of God is Not Dishonored now it says submitted to their own husband so there is this teaching this emphasis that a woman is to be this willfully submitted to her husband not somebody else's husband not to some other authority but there's this working together in that relationship so that somebody else on the outside or somebody who's not a Believer would say my good they claim to believe this document and the woman has no respect to her husband it's not a very good testimony so there's a lot that's being used in that and that these things are to be taught so that this character that results it's described of these aged women or these women who are mature that they have since they're learning how to do these things that they have a character of Sanctified Behavior this Holiness they're not backbiters they have this they're tempered in their in their with their tongues they don't gossip they're not Bounder in bondage to intoxicants and maybe there's just a a broad way that you could spell that out they're teachers of good these are the this is the resulting character of young ladies being taught a certain way uh this is the character that it ought to manifest and in each one of these things where you say sober temperate sound in faith and not giving to much wine and and loving their husbands there's a lot of things that we could say are in general terms we say well it's kind of in an Old English slant well you could go and read it in modern language and it's going to present some of these very same ideals and we could paint a picture in our mind of what that ought to look like and we could imagine we might even see examples of it and regardless of the examples we've seen and how it literally expresses itself we recognize that what it would have looked like in Titus 2 is not going to be the exact same uh setting because that was a in a different age in a different time but it's going to have a proper manifestation in the time that we're living in now you don't just say oh well that's that's before that's when there was just two genders nowadays I mean we need we need Titus 1 2 third fourth fifth and sixth Titus uh to be able just to be a little bit more inclusive but this is a this is expressing principles and ideals that are in our Bible that is you know hundreds thousands of years old but yet can still ring true today now in the uh midrash Proverbs uh when it's addressing there's some Rich uh oral storytelling around the Queen of Sheba and they broke it down into several different riddles and different ways that uh she was testing Solomon's wisdom and brother bradam in the sermon God identifying himself by his characteristics in March uh 20th of 1964 he refers to one of these riddles or these Parables and he refers to the one where uh the Queen of Sheba presented children who are of the same height the same attire so they looked the same and they were dressed the same and asked distinguish between the male and females so children were presented looking relatively the same and now Solomon was going to use his wisdom to find out whether one was a woman or one was a man or the boy or girl uh maybe be the more appropriate language and so Solomon had uh his servants put nuts and and roasted ears of corn on the ground before the children and they were told to collect them and as the the midrash describes it that the the boy collected them and then tied them within the hyms of their garments they weren't really concerned about how they looked they just wanted to get the food and they tied it up and they gathered it and they were able to collect it in such a way to where it's like all right I've got I've got my corn I've got these nuts uh this I've done what you've asked me to do but it says the girls tied them within their outer garments that if they had layered clothing maybe an apron or something that they didn't just go and hurriedly start to gather it in their garment they were very particular about doing it in their outer garment because they were bashful about their bodies that there was they were very careful not to expose their undergarments so the boys by nature but the boys expressed this unabashed about themselves but whereas the girls were a little bit more Meek and uh ashamed uh to act in a way that would dis discover their undergarment and it's by that that salmon said these are the boys and these are the girls and brother man refers to this Parable and he talks about men and women and he refers to how the men dress like women dress like man he says wow wouldn't that be on point today he said then it would would have been really weird and more of a challenge he says but today this is what's happening every day is I'm sorry ma'am sir I don't I don't know what you are what you identify as please don't judge me if I get it wrong and it's hard to distinguish anymore but the fact is and to me I think it speaks to the agenda that the world has or Satan has in removing these distinctions and making them more confusing but brother Brown points out that Solomon identified them by their characteristics and even in the context of the parable where in the next one uh the Queen of Sheba uh it it says to distinguish among these men uh who were circumcised and uncircumcised and the way that Solomon did it is he had them the priest in the parable priest bring the Ark of the Covenant and the Heathen laid down in a certain way but the Jew the circumcised bowed in a certain way and it showed the difference of learned behavior and so there are certain things that were innate or inherent to a boy and certain things inherent in a believer that they or that they were taught and so it's by their characteristics their nature that has been nurtured you teach women to to be shamefaced to be sober and to be H uh Meek and there's a certain respect that they'd have for their bodies whereas a man he's more he's less as shamed less ashamed he has things he needs to do and it's by their nature and the character that they've been taught that they disclose what they are these are the very things that Titus is drawing on aged men this is how you should be and since this is how you should be this is how you teach the young men and Solomon and brother bam using this uh Parable in God identifying himself by his characteristics says that's how you know something is by its characteristics at where we live I've been uh watching what could be Ravens or crows and what could be Hawks or Falcons fight on a regular basis in the air and I get my binoculars out and I watch them and I'm trying to learn by their behavior what they look like and their color and their size to say what are these are these Ravens fighting with the Falcon and what's happening and you know if you can know what what the nature and attributes are and then identify it and this is part of that theme that brother B's using in these several sermons whether be identification God is identified by his characteristics God identifying himself uh by his characteristics the identified Christ of all ages the identification of Christ in all ages Christ is identified the same in all generations the unveiling of God the identifi Christ in all ages and he's several sermons that he leads even to the Masterpiece and the identified Masterpiece all these sermons just building in the same thought now as we've kind of summarized these things in verses 2 to8 let's look at verse n and this is where uh kind of the plot thickens or it escalates exhort servants that word there I think does a disservice to what was originally meant to say servants because the word is slave exhorts servants exhort slaves to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again this word servant is a bond slave it's not one who is uh voluntarily rendering service or one that's paid it speaks of one who's uh uh indentured or otherwise owned exhort slaves to be obedience to their owners their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not purloining but showing all good Fidelity that they may Adorn the doctrine of God our savior in all things these are instructions to Slaves be loyal be of benefit to your owners in other words behave in such a way toward where it's profitable to them beneficial to them do not talk back that's not answer again don't talk back and this word there're not pining do not steal no matter how Petty in other words no purloining now don't think well this is a field full of corn I'll just take a couple ears Paul is telling them look don't take advantage of them don't don't be a petty Thief there's ways that it's expressing behavior for those who are uh owned by somebody else be of good character so that your good character would emanate from your actions and in doing so it would add a glory to the word of God or add glory to God one commentator said the slaves become the savior's Representatives responsible for conduct that can lead to their Master's salvation this is what expressed in the New Testament is reading some other places where Paul is is speaking to the believer who is the slave and whether their owner was a Believer or non-believer this is the kind of course of conduct for each one to engage in and say that the unbelieving master is at a disadvantage because the believing slave the one who is a slave has the Privileges of Eternity you'll find this in other teachings in the New Testament now and um and I'm not nervous and some of you may be getting really really nervous and saying stop the tape we about to get canceled but if you read the Bible and even read in great detail the Old Testament has its rules re revolving around uh slavery and very specifically uh how it operate within the context of the law and there was always this out there was always they were not to mistreat them and abuse them and so there was a certain context to slavery in the Old Testament very different than the slavery that is represented here that Paul is addressing whereas under the law the Israelite would be like well I I stand to be the owner but now when Paul is writing his letters Bond slaves were a reality in yesterday's Roman Empire these were a reality and Paul is writing and so what he does is he addresses the believer who's part of that reality he doesn't condone slavery he doesn't say it's okay and a lot of people have misused these scriptures to justify slavery and there's really it takes quite a contortion and perversion to use these scriptures to advocate for any kind of slavery but knowing this the situation that presently existed Paul addresses the believer who would be in it and doesn't advocate for them to overthrow it and use politics and use Force to overthrow an oppressive regime because the Bible is not interested in changing governments and politics and institutions the Bible and the gospel is about changing a man's heart and so if God could change the servant's heart it was more of a case to overthrow slavery than it would be to overthrow the institution without anyone's Hearts being overturn changed so I I know that I just uh kind of like a hornets nest I just kicked and so I'll probably drive home tonight just going what have I done and so I'm always open to more questions or as necessary clarifying myself but I believe that this The Scourge even the mark on America to use the Bible to justify owning somebody else and slavery that we we see now clearly that those things are wrong but some of the greatest Advocates and the motivators of change were men of God who preached the gospel and that became the ground swell of overturning an oppressive institution so as we read this and we if we read it to say slaves obey your owners what would this look like today right now if we would read it slaves obey your owners and we'd say well this is to Slaves who are owned by another human being we might just say well that doesn't apply but Paul is addressing an a reality a condition something that existed at the time and so if there is I can say it this way is there an original reality in our present context and I believe that there are ways that this can be applied Even in our employee employer relationship and the relationship we would have to others we have a duty these things could apply now let me bring this quote back into view again because we'd read it here recently and I want to use it again to uh kind of use some momentum of things we've talked about before and Christ is identified the same in all generations this is from the sermon we read in the beginning he says now remember don't forget our theme is and our text that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he says now my text subject for tonight is Christ is identified the same in all generations and again if we begin to paint a picture in our mind of how he identifies himself there's a way that we could draw from a first century context and want to see him like that today and what we see in this statement and some of the other ones we used a couple weeks ago was that if that's what you're looking for you're going to miss them and there's actually very specific things that you might be looking for that if that's the next Jesus you see you're in big trouble right because you've missed it so he says now the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever and we want to know how he could be how we'd recognize him these are good questions if he's the same yesterday today and forever we want to know what he would look like and we' think well then could we just run some facial recognition AI on all the all the pictures and paintings and photographs in the world today and see if we could find them embedded in pictures and say he there he is right there there he is right there there he is right there all based upon facial features and certain uh uh uh things that he might look like he said what would he look like if he's here just as he was any other time then we'd like to know how he is recognized Among Us there's so many people have so many different ideas about him each one as an individual try to draw up our idea about Christ what he was what he looks like and how the psychologist has painted the picture like Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 and Salomon and different ones but we don't know he looked like that so we could never understand or what he looked like and by painting some picture this is again I I just want to refer back to what we were expressing before on this but people have come up with representations of what they think he looks like brother B says psychologist and Painters and these artists have painted pictures and if we take from that picture the reality of Christ that we're looking at the painting to form some sort of expectation and reality then this is not what he's going to look like and miss and not seeing this certain expression or this certain image we're going to miss them all together but he says we have to learn to know what he is this is what he arrives at he says we have to learn to know what he is what is he referring to not so much a robe not so much long hair not so much a beard but we're to learn to know his character his nature that this is how one this is how Christ would act this is how these are things that would form his character and his nature these are things that we would expect him to do in this end time and and what I know that each one of you as message students know is that brother bam used this in many ways to point to this sign of discernment and this gift to where there was a sign given where there's something Beyond man there's something Beyond brother brandham and he's Discerning thoughts and he's giving these H uh descriptions of things that only the Holy Spirit would know and that was a sign to declare the Supernatural is Among Us and I would say that that was Christ yesterday I'm just using it only in terms of chronology that what brother brandham was doing then we don't try to mimic and duplicate now to say see he's the same but we've got to find what our role is in the same pattern to say he did his part to awaken me to my part he's played his part now I come into the scene now I'm on the move now I want to know what he's like I want to learn what he is now so that I could be him now if we were to all be like brother brandham I got some things you could subscribe to and there's there's philosophies and ideologies and ways that we could try to just fit ourselves into this particular pattern brother Kevin that's what I was referring to when I said Indiana it was no no dig on Lafayette or anything like that it was not until later that my kids reminded me that you were visiting and I was like oh I really got him now that was was my shot but you're back here tonight so I'm going to go on Indiana all I want but no there's not a character of a Believer with the STS and hat the belt buckle that we're trying to fit into an image of but we want to know the character the character that is on display continuing to verse 11 of Titus Chapter 2 notice this it says for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men when Grace appears it brings salvation and teaching when Grace appears the grace of God that bringeth salvation ha appeared to all men teaching us that so notice how it appears to produce a certain character Grace has appeared in this hour it's the revelation of Jesus Christ there's this revealing of the Capstone this uh even one thing I thought for you to consider a little bit the intelligence has come the intelligence is being manifested not an artificial intelligence but a real genuine intelligence is being manifested and so the grace of God that brings full deliverance and full salvation has appeared and it's teaching and this teaching produces a character and and you could fit this into how he's teaching aged men aged women young men young women even servants when it appears it teaches us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world this is this applies for all when Grace appears it teaches us to reject ungodliness that we are to reject and to shun and have nothing to do with these worldly immoral desires the language that's being used that we should live sensible we should live upright and have Godly lives that there very deliberate in how that we live and how that we act that we have certain things that we measure things by and there's a certain consistency and we seem to be very per purposeful and it's so that it's reflecting this uh spiritually mature life the spiritual maturity and it says in this present World in other words the grace of God comes and when it does it teaches and it's going to teach you to deny worldliness to deny ungodliness to deny immorality to live sensibly and upright and godly to be deliberate to have a purpose and what we're doing is we're showing ourselves to be spiritually mature a and and that we're making decisions because in such a way to where we're and I'm drawing from something that was very very important last year is reducing things to Simplicity of what's valuable a a and identifying valuable and reducing it to that so that when you make a decision you view it through a certain parameter you narrow the scope of what you're looking at by frame and you have these boundaries and it makes it easier to make a decision and you realize oh does that it's a no it's a hard no if that's the case it's a no and then when the next situation comes up again you don't need to be like well well well no you know it's a no and you you give thought to decisions and examples I I can say this as a as a weakness that is my inconsistency and my lack of clarity as a father that causes more problems for my children than their own stubbornness or Disobedience and my children said okay you can have screen time tomorrow except right there's an inconsistency of the parents I I'm just saying for me you guys are doing great I'm learning from you that it's the lack of clarity it's the lack of a something to measure things by my son presses really good at trying to dig into it and find out what makes sense and what are the parameters and it's good for us to think about it it's like well I said not to do this and not to do that and what does it look like and how does it unfold and how it works this is how we ought to be growing and learning these things and all these things it says in this current age that we're in now not trying to draw ourselves back to Titus Chapter 2 in this day when Paul wrote this epistle to Titus and to try to figure contort ourselves to what it would look like in this traditional scenario uh anybody know what a Trad wife is I'm not asking for answers but these things that have come up in our popular culture and these certain images that people try to portray and now there's these women that by all appearances don't look traditional but they think they're acting traditional by behaving a certain way towards their husband and it's a very unscriptural traditional wife but yet they feel like they're giving this image and paying uh uh some service to a virtue and The Virtue is actually lacking because the the original reality is not being dis displayed in present context I can appreciate the the the the desire to take something that is scriptural and represent it in present context but they've moved so many other barriers and or boundaries and mov so many other things to where it doesn't translate and so instead of just rejecting Titus Chapter 2 wholesale or uh uh or trying to go back and live in Titus Chapter 2 I want an original reality in the present context as an aged who's getting ready to turn 50 I want to know what that looks like and I realize as I judge Myself by it that there's a lot of ways I joke around there's a lot of things that I maybe pay a little bit of attention to or wink wink nudge nudge or even sometimes when you're just a little bit H uh cutting it up with the kids real no one would look at me and guess how old I am and he realized there's maybe things that you could be more mature in things you could be a little bit more stable in and that's how it speaks these things I want to be a reflection of Christ in the present age I live in now and I like oh well that's just oldfashioned that's just this that's Titus Chapter 2 or that's just the 50s that's just the 60s what does it look like today in the sermon looking for Jesus I thought that was such a good title he preaches it in 1954 he says Where would he be I don't believe I've provided the statement I think the next slide is Titus 213 right so he says Where would he be out in the great shining lights no he would be amongst the humble the common people heard him gladly said the scripture when you think about the image of Christ and how we use that scripture on Sunday he was amongst the common people there's this and and I think that there's a well it's just it's difficult for me to express it and I hope that I'm just doing it piece by piece by piece in no way am I suggesting that well the best way we could be uh a witness is in Vegas you catch my drift right let's just go to Nevada where all everything's legal and let's just kind of be amongst them and show them that there's a I mean there's a there's a good way to get high or whatever or be a glutton and just just try to identify ourselves with the Sinners as a way of s I'm fulfilling the scripture that's not it right that that that's not that's not what the scripture is advocating for but if we turn that around there's a way that we're if we're not being very clear in our messaging I mean kind of there's this dog whistle so to speak of being so cultish and so Elite to where there's this hard division and there's absolutely zero way you can testify zero way you can be a witness zero way that anyone's everever going to know what Christ is because you can't have anything to do with it whatsoever at all and there's like this top down hierarchy which forbids certain things and doesn't allow certain things to where we're just kind of like all dumb driven cattle I got to go to this church thing I got go that church think I got to do this got to do that can't have my family here can't do this can't do that and so the light's never being expressed because we kind of put force it into this image that's not even a scriptural one and we lose the original reality uh because we can't even regard the per present context so he's saying where would he be he'd be humble he'd be amongst the common people now again it's saying that there's some traversing through the world there's some living a life and having a job and and sending your kids to school there's certain things that we just do this is what humans do that it's not advocating for finding the the most temperate climate in good soil living off the grid planting your food and eating it and if we all somehow everyone who had the holy goh somehow could successfully relocate to that place there'd be no more salvation unless somebody just fell out of the sky and they land they survive and we're like oh my goodness what's going on here and they're like go I've never seen people like this I want to be saved how would the gospel be preached how would it ever contact a life where would he be amongst the common people they heard him gladly the priest and so forth wouldn't listen to him so here's that we're more righteous we're more holy this uh this construct that they had he said they had their own ideas their own churches their own setup so they didn't listen what kind of man would he be then would he be a real overbearing sort of person no I don't believe he would so all the overbearing people he say well write that down need to pray for that I believe he'd be a kind person and I believe he'd be so kind that when he spoke to you you'd know it was him speaking and yet he'd be firm enough till you would know that and kind of it's to me it's a little bit of a fragment but as he described what he looked like in those Visions when he saw him he said just like you'd want to cry when he spoke he had such tenderness and such meekness and kindness but you saw all power was in him and he says like when he platted the ropes together and beat them out of the temple for doing something wrong he says no I don't believe no artist could paint his character he's describing in another place he said there's just too many characteristics that an artist's brush could never catch the seed is not air with a shook he said his face had characters that no artist could draw or paint they could not do it and characters could never be caught by an artist notice just how rich that makes it there's something about you can't just kind take a a a Polaroid just take a picture just have a profile picture just have an Instagram account just put something online listen the most effective witness of this church is not our sermons it's not trying to come up with a way to use certain tools to produce you know short content that expresses a lot I mean anymore that you could have me up there talking in front of a green screen I it's not even me or my voice it's just a learned model and it can say all sorts of nice flowery things and really really profound things and we could start a podcast there's a lot of stuff we could do from a social media context but that can only go so far the most effective witness is when you are living in 3D in reality in a way that artist natural means and natural media can never express but God as an artist knows just how to paint it we should live Godly in this present World an original reality of the way that Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we should be living it today verse 13 looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purifying unto himself a peculiar people there's a lot of things that brother badam says in these God identifying himself by his characteristics in all ages and those sermons where he brings out how that his rep the way that he expresses himself confounds the norm that it it's against kind of the the original way of thinking the original way of doing things so to say that it's the original reality in present context doesn't mean that we blend in as Comm Millions doesn't mean that it just completely goes unnoticed because we've been able to camou ourselves in the world just like the story that's told about the boy that went to the logging camp and the mother was really worried what they would do to him and they found out that he was a Christian and he comes back and she says oh he comes like oh man what did they do to you how did they treat say oh uh it was great mama and she said well what did they do when they found out you're a Christian said oh they never found out and so that's not the that's not what we're trying to do is make our way through this world without anyone ever be going thinking that's different the original reality in the present context is enough in itself than us trying to be weird or different remember the teachings in the seven seal Seven Seals if us trying to be weird if we just Express the original reality in the present context it's going to be different enough without us trying peculiar people zealous of Good Works our Zeal should be towards righteousness and Holiness and uprightness we should be pattering after these things that Paul said to Titus that aged men should be so as young men we're learning to be that as young women we're learning to be that that we ought to have this Zeal for good works and so this is the admonition to the teacher these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee and this is our commission today to fathers and the homes it's a commission to to parents and grandparents it's a commission to us as a church that we are modeling ourselves and what we're trying to produce after these scriptures that we want people to be uh uh images of Christ as individuals and it says A peculiar people they are unique I think I've mentioned this before but with the proliferation of media and just how I could be listening to something today in Phoenix that people all around the world are listening to at the same exact moment we can enjoy things instantaneously at the same time and so in doing so there there's a har there's a I guess you could say it's a harmonizing um I've been studying on the places where brother BR talks about the symphony calls it a sympathy and he uses Peter and the Wolf so there's and some sermons there's I got a list of sermons if you want to listen to those for that particular line of thinking on a symphony we're all being conducted and brother bam talks about those disconcordant parts or those parts of the unbeliever and he says they have a part in the symphony and so there is a Harmony or there's these certain things I think it's even some worldly artists say that you need those um or it's like watching a movie with no bad guy or eating cottage cheese and so there's a certain thing to where those bad things create this contrast and they have their part so there is kind of this harmonizing this uniting through these worldly means and in doing so everyone starts to sound the same and look the same and there is a little bit of a that's misleading because the world is going to unite under the wrong thing and so I know for Brother John you've been seeing this in my slides for a few weeks and I'm finally getting to it but in the sermon the identified Masterpiece of God and I have a couple slides here at the beginning without the words but I'm just want you to look at this Starry Night Over the rone uh by Van go in heaven we look at the celestial bodies the Bible says that even one star differs from the other there is Sirius and the different ones and Mars and Jupiter all those different ones they're different one from the other the sun is different from the Moon and the moon from the stars look at that uh the art just a painter is trying to capture what this the night looks like and and my son Elliott sent me an excerpt from his a philosophy class today his college philosophy course and I was like I could just take these to the pulpit and not preach philosophy but on the context of Art and the and how that God there's these theories and philosophy of these original forms that's the god I think the example that was used was a bed there's a a bed in heaven that that is the perfect bed and then the the carpenter can make a bed that's like that and so that's just one level removed and then someone could paint the bed and that's a a a a replication of a replication of the original kind of getting some extra credit for philosophy now and what we see here and many people are mesmerized by this would paid Millions for it and I think it's a it's an engaging work of art and the way that it's captured and the way that it's painted but you realize this is just only telling part of the story and there's so many different stars and different uh uh distances away and different purposes and uses and brother B say they all differ from one another and then he says the same thing about angels and there are angels such as their seraphim and cherubims and the angels and great angels in degrees and even in the new world to come the king of the earth bring their AR honor into the city there's there's God's always had degrees he's had Parts he's had roles I there was brother Micah and I were fellowshipping early today on the phone and how that one thing that has meant a lot to me is to understand that to God the process is just as important as the product cuz if the product was all he was interested in it'd be in the the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth new and we lived and reigned forever right boom there we'd be we have Genesis 1 and and the end of the Bible that's it we would be ruling and reigning Eighth Day forever and but since God is a god values the process just as much as the product he has created in these degrees and in these channels and these different parts and these different means to where it's not just one Mass blob but God is a God of positions and purposes and uses and he says even in heaven the new heavens and new earth there's going to be some order or symmetry to it he says we're always going to be that way because God is not a Sears and robu Harmony House anybody know what a Sears and robu Harmony House is anybody we got some hands raised raise them high let's just see who knows what a ser anybody have a furniture set that was a Harmony House and maybe a dish set anybody here register with Sears and robu for their wedding I went and just researched it a Sears and Rob Buck Harmony House and it was this line that they came out with I found a lot of different ads I'd had some uh a slide maybe to show it but I realized in the end I didn't like the art so I just kept it out because says God is not a Sears and robot Harmony House where we're trying to create a particular image that is you you can get everything want for your entire house from this line and everything's going to match everything's going to look the same and it's a Harmony House sounds like one of these modern uh YouTube uh houses or Tik Tok houses or whatever the Sears and robu Harmony House he says that's not how God is he says he is a god of variety he makes one one way and one another but we must serve him in the way that God made us and be glad and stay behind his word just as there are glories to the stars and there's a glory to the angels the differences among us do not remove the glory it accentuates and complement the glory through Force unity and the wrong image we could all start to look the same and talk the same and act the same and that would do a disservice to a god who's a god of variety and how that God wants to express himself not through a Sears and Rob book Harmony House not through a limited catalog where we're all buying the same things wearing the same things what doing all the same things but rather there's a character that we all can exhibit through our varied uh works and callings and Recreations and that there's a way that we can live and express the original reality in your present context as you were called to rub shoulders with people that I will never come in contact with as you are called to dress and act a way as a sister that a man will not be called and act a certain way that there is a character that's to be expressed and I and I would say this with great uh uh force and warning that there is that expression that is just outright foolish and perverted that we can't make the excuse of variety we recognize that because we've got to stay behind the word and that's the way God did it no that was me that's the way God did it but when we find that out that the enemy got through that word to this the handywork of God he marred it he got he caused the woman to leave the frame to leave the context and that's exactly what he's doing now he's slipping through that handiwork Brothers you can come to your instruments the enemy is trying to make us a World Council of churches why men can even agree with one another how are we going to make a whole world agree with a man he says we got one we must keep in harmony with that's God that's who we're in harmony with and if we're in harmony with him in our part and our role it's going to naturally harmonize with somebody else whoever else the ones that we bump into are the ones who've got their own idea their own agenda their own program we must keep in harmony with God and in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word remains God and always will be God because God is the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the person of the Son of God to speak of Harmony at the very least would imply two parts would it not okay good I'm just going to Harmony would imply some sort of different parts two things that maybe don't match up or agree or or separate entities Harmony implies that these different parts and roles are in agreement we could use scriptures we don't all have the same calling we don't all have the same office we don't have all have the same Administration but it's the same spirit and in order for there to be Harmony that requires even with vocal vocal Harmony in instruments it requires Integrity to your tone it it requires a consonant it requires Clarity there's certain things that you must have each one in their own part and one voice whether it be instruments or voices there got to be that order that proportion that symmetry that's a in a musical sense one of the greatest challenges even in church music is that not everybody tries to play the same exact way everyone's on the melody everyone's doing this everyone's doing the same thing and what does it create a just a Roar and it it's not a sound system problem it's my turn to lecture the musicians tonight wait hold on uh they it creates a war it's not a sound system problem it's the fact that each one doesn't know their Lane there's a way that they can play their instrument the right way that compliments the next guy and the next guy and not everyone has to be the show but they all kind of blend together the tightest Harmony almost becomes indistinguishable and it just starts to resonate in a way it's like wow and if you wanted to drill down in all the different ways that you could have these notes and these harmonizations it's a that mathematical principle of Harmony and if God's wanting to express himself he says we have to be in harmony with God so you're not God but you're a part of God and being a part of God and you being a part of God and you being a part of God there's a way that we all have to harmonize together together with God and in doing so create a beautiful picture together none of us can do it on our own but together we can begin to create a a symphony together we we we create a picture and that's why we don't we don't want to just be uh Mavericks off doing our own thing but there's power in the fellowship that we have with one another there's ways that maybe together we can be a witness to other people as brothers there's ways that are The Homeschool families when they get together there's no doubt there's a witness there when you all go out together and you have people over you're a witness in your neighborhood and at the park there's a way that that voice begins to blend and harmonize and people will see like this is a beautiful picture God wants to express himself so there must be if God's a god of variety and he himself is a god of these many lights in this great Fountain there must be some distinct attributes that need to be honored this is what Paul is expressing to Titus men be men women be women young men young women be a certain way there's got to be a way that we can by our characteristics and by our nature Express these certain distinct attributes that give God that gives God honor that's both in leading and following both in our that behavior that we have as men and the way behavior that we have as women that there's a proper form we're having the discussion today as a family on you know the objective things and subjective things I believe that there is this objective beauty of the scripture that God wants us to portray and not everybody's going to think it's beautiful but those that God has given some taste for that they're going to see it and they're going to love it and they're going to want to be part of that picture spent a little bit of time just trying to create this graphic that is here accompanied this last slide and it takes the Rich Young Ruler from Hoffman's Christ at 33 and it doesn't put him in a robe and a a ruler's hat and fine linen and lavish clothing it's very Stark distinct from the way that Jesus is dressed when you look at the original but just a guy a young man in a suit and tie who's been the original reality is confronting him and I use the picture of the classic picture of Christ to say he's the same yesterday today and forever but it's not the robe it's not the hair it's not the hands but it's Christ showing you showing you in his word what it means and here a modern day man Rich Young Ruler is in deep contemplation about the price and the cost there is a present day context that we're to live in to be Godly in this present World God help us to do it and to do it we will need his help let's pray today today you can stand with me thank you for your patience tonight I feel good having delivered this and my burden on these things so thank you let's bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father tonight Lord as we close this service and we just sum up these things that we've shared with the prayer of blessing upon the people and by way of challenge to the people that if there be anything in their hearts that you need to address Lord we Avail ourselves to you and we open up our minds and our hearts and deal with us Lord in a deep way Lord in fellowshipping with someone this week who expressed how in their 50s they know that they're lacking that that seal and that conversion and they're despairing Lord and and you can see that there's a lifetime of confusion and Lord It's I think it just becomes such a unmovable object in our minds and Lord if we could just push everything else away and just look to You In This Moment the word and say that yes what I'm asking for is this experience or what I'm asking for is this but Lord this is what I need and I come to you and I ask you for it and I believe for it I want you to be real I want you to be a reality Lord if you could just make yourself known to us and identify yourself to us through your presence and through your word and your interest in us then Lord may we just grab a hold of that that expression and that manifestation to say Lord I know you're mindful I believe that you're real that there's an original reality that can Dawn on my life and Lord we yield to you tonight as clay and you the Potter we yield as your creation Lord and you the Creator to make us what we ought to be in the context of the world that we're living in now not to make us like the world but in the world make us lights Lord we need your Grace we need your help so I pray for the people tonight I know father that for me in Fellowship I realize it's repetition repetition repetition of the same things but Lord I'm hoping that the foundation is getting stronger and stronger and stronger that we can all have patience for one another as we get caught up together in this Foundation of you Christ revealed to us as individuals the sure Foundation upon which the remainder of Our Lives in this church can be built Lord I pray that you bless your people that are here may they experience this Divine Healing May the word that's discern their hearts today not by a gift of discernment on display of the on the platform as it was yesterday but the word sharper than a two-edged sword now still yet Discerning people's lives as the gospel's preached I pray that that would awaken us to a reality Beyond ourselves an original reality in present day context we ask all all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
