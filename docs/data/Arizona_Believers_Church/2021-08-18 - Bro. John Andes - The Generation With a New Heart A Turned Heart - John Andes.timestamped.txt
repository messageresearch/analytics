[0:00] so tonight i want to speak on the
[0:01] generation with a new heart
[0:05] the generation with a new heart and then
[0:07] we want to speak on a turned heart so
[0:10] ezekiel
[0:11] chapter 11 verse 19.
[0:16] the bible says and i will give them one
[0:19] heart let's all say one heart
[0:24] god is speaking and i will put a new
[0:27] spirit within you
[0:30] and i will take the stony heart
[0:34] out of their flesh
[0:36] and will give them a heart of flesh
[0:40] so it sounds like a heart surgery
[0:44] doesn't it
[0:45] it sounds like a heart surgery
[0:48] god is doing this work i'm going to give
[0:50] you one heart i'll put a new spirit
[0:52] within you now take the stony heart out
[0:55] of your flesh and give them a heart of
[0:57] flesh
[0:58] can you go to chapter 18 verse 31.
[1:03] brother john has made this beautiful
[1:05] slide for us tonight i i don't think the
[1:07] internet group can see this but brother
[1:09] john made this up
[1:12] brother john phalem amen
[1:16] ezekiel 18 31
[1:19] cast away from you all your
[1:21] transgressions
[1:23] whereby you have transgressed
[1:26] and make you
[1:28] a new heart
[1:30] and a new spirit
[1:33] for why will you die
[1:35] o house of israel
[1:38] it almost makes
[1:39] this verse almost makes it sound like
[1:41] it's something that you're doing doesn't
[1:43] it
[1:45] so god's not going to force you
[1:48] god's not an abusive husband and he's
[1:50] not somebody even though he knows what's
[1:52] best that he dominates and forces you
[1:55] but he's actually encouraging you to
[1:58] move away from
[2:00] your past or your transgression and make
[2:03] you a new heart
[2:04] and a new spirit for why would you die i
[2:08] think that's good counsel tonight why
[2:10] would we live in spiritual death when
[2:12] god is inviting us
[2:13] with arms wide open to have a new heart
[2:17] be a ground that god can just speak to
[2:19] and let it happen
[2:20] you don't have to work it up you don't
[2:22] have to get all nervous
[2:24] and make it happen you just need to let
[2:26] the word
[2:27] have its effect
[2:29] as you hear the word just receive it
[2:32] i know i'm a new minister and it's
[2:34] you know you've only had maybe brother
[2:36] cadre diggs and maybe a few others this
[2:38] last year but open up your heart
[2:40] to the word
[2:42] and it can happen to you like it did in
[2:44] the beginning let there be light
[2:47] let there be healing
[2:49] let there be joy let there be peace
[2:52] ezekiel 36 if you'd like to turn there
[2:56] with us while you're standing
[3:00] ezekiel 36 verse 26 and 27
[3:06] ezekiel must have tapped into the
[3:08] inspiration
[3:10] ezekiel 36 26
[3:12] a new heart let's say new heart
[3:15] a new heart also will i give you
[3:21] and a new spirit will i put within you
[3:26] and i will take away the stony heart out
[3:30] of your flesh and i
[3:33] will give you a heart of flesh
[3:36] isn't this wonderful
[3:38] and the person that said this has never
[3:40] lied
[3:42] he's never lied
[3:44] so you can take this word tonight as an
[3:47] absolute as a guarantee
[3:49] i'll be with you i'll be in you i'm
[3:52] going to do this
[3:54] verse 27.
[3:55] so it's not just a new heart and a new
[3:58] spirit but he says and i will put my
[4:02] spirit
[4:03] within you
[4:05] and cause you to walk in my statutes
[4:09] and ye shall
[4:11] keep my judgments and do them
[4:15] praise god
[4:17] now let's turn to malachi chapter 4
[4:19] verse 5 and 6. this is a very familiar
[4:22] scripture to probably most of you in
[4:24] this room
[4:27] and i pray as the year as the months go
[4:29] by that the lord add more to this
[4:31] congregation that maybe don't know it as
[4:34] well as you do
[4:36] but um i believe there's new ones to
[4:38] come
[4:39] hallelujah there's going to be new
[4:41] people off the streets or out
[4:43] that don't even know the lord it's going
[4:45] to come to the message
[4:46] be a good lighthouse
[4:48] let the good light shine we're not here
[4:50] to watch a movie tonight or we're not at
[4:52] a baseball game this is to hear the word
[4:55] of god just let your light shine malachi
[4:58] 4
[4:59] verse 5 and 6 this is the same one that
[5:02] was speaking ezekiel says i will send
[5:05] you elijah the prophet before the coming
[5:08] of the great and dreadful day of the
[5:09] lord
[5:12] and he
[5:13] shall turn the heart
[5:16] this is our subject tonight a turned
[5:18] heart
[5:19] he shall turn the heart
[5:22] of the fathers to the children
[5:24] and the heart of the children
[5:27] to their fathers
[5:29] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[5:32] curse
[5:33] now that's you
[5:35] you are the ones whose hearts are being
[5:38] turned back
[5:40] amen
[5:41] for many years malachi 4 you thought was
[5:43] william branham the prophet that's only
[5:46] part of it
[5:47] he did his work
[5:49] where's the generation whose hearts are
[5:51] going to be turned back
[5:53] where are the children where are the
[5:54] ones that must say here i am lord
[5:57] god bless you you can have your seats
[6:02] there's a lot of qualities about your
[6:03] pastor that i appreciate but one of them
[6:06] i've noticed he preaches about an hour
[6:08] almost every service
[6:10] so uh i'm gonna try to do that tonight
[6:13] amen and if i go a few minutes over it's
[6:16] because i'm not as good as brother aaron
[6:18] when i grow up i'll be like brother
[6:20] aaron amen but i've noticed he does
[6:22] really good he'll just cut it right off
[6:24] and speak an hour and i think that's
[6:26] good for us say man you got to drive
[6:27] home tonight and i want you to be safe
[6:30] and i don't want anyone's car going down
[6:32] the river amen amen don't drive across
[6:35] the road that's all flooded i did learn
[6:37] that in arizona
[6:39] all right amen
[6:42] tonight i'd like to speak on the
[6:43] generation with a new heart
[6:46] the generation with a new heart
[6:49] and we'd like to look at a subject a
[6:51] turned heart
[6:52] out of malachi because
[6:55] little did you realize before you were
[6:57] born when malachi was written that it
[6:59] would be prophesying that a prophet
[7:01] would come
[7:02] at the end time and that that ministry
[7:04] would have the power to turn the heart
[7:08] of the last day children
[7:11] it would turn your heart not your head
[7:14] so as i was just reading the scripture
[7:16] today and i was thinking of isaiah where
[7:19] it says they that wade upon the lord
[7:21] shall renew their strength
[7:24] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[7:27] and they shall run and not be weary and
[7:30] they shall walk and not faint i say lord
[7:33] teach us how to wait
[7:35] but then in psalms it says because of
[7:38] his strength
[7:40] i will wait upon thee
[7:43] because of his strength i will wait upon
[7:46] thee for the lord is my defense it's
[7:48] almost like a paradox brother michael
[7:51] where it says they that wait upon the
[7:53] lord
[7:54] shall renew their strength how many love
[7:56] that scripture just wait upon the lord
[7:59] just keep waiting until god brings it to
[8:02] pass
[8:03] but then psalms 59 verse 9 says
[8:07] because of his strength will i wait upon
[8:10] thee so we need his strength tonight
[8:13] to wait
[8:14] until he gives us a new heart
[8:17] and have patience on one another because
[8:20] god is beautiful for situations
[8:24] are you bringing up some of these
[8:25] scriptures brother john
[8:27] i'm testing you brother oh just the ones
[8:29] you gave me
[8:30] can you find psalms 48 verse 2
[8:34] how many have ever been in a situation
[8:36] you say i'm in a situation
[8:39] the lord is beautiful for your situation
[8:42] psalms 48 verse 2 says beautiful for
[8:46] situation the joy of the whole earth is
[8:49] mount zion on the sides of the north the
[8:51] city of the great king god is known in
[8:54] her palaces for a refuge our god is
[8:58] beautiful for situation
[9:01] hallelujah
[9:03] proverbs 4 verse 23
[9:06] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[9:09] out of it are the issues of life
[9:13] watch your heart
[9:15] guard your heart
[9:17] proverbs 4 verse 23 keep thy heart with
[9:21] all diligence
[9:22] for out of it are the issues of life
[9:26] we need to establish tonight that the
[9:28] heart is really the heart of the matter
[9:31] it's the center that's our title tonight
[9:34] the generation with a new heart it's the
[9:37] main thing it's the middle of your life
[9:39] it's it's more than just the organ
[9:42] that's in the center of your body that's
[9:44] in charge of the circulation of your
[9:46] blood
[9:47] or we would say it's the seat of your
[9:49] physical life but it's also the center
[9:52] of your spiritual life
[9:55] your heart tonight we could talk a lot
[9:57] about your body and about your spirit
[10:00] but really the heart of the matter from
[10:02] out of the heart of the matter come all
[10:05] the issues of life
[10:07] really tonight i i might not know very
[10:10] you very much in the outward person but
[10:12] your heart is demonstrating uh whether
[10:15] you're alive or not and i'm not just
[10:17] speaking naturally but spiritually the
[10:20] heart is the fountain and the seed of
[10:22] your passion it's the seed of your
[10:24] desires and it makes up you as a person
[10:28] all of your appetites all of your
[10:30] affections your purposes in life your
[10:33] endeavors in life
[10:36] your understanding and the faculty of
[10:39] your intelligence is more than what's in
[10:41] your mind it's your will it's your
[10:44] character tonight can i ask you where is
[10:47] the generation whose hearts are going to
[10:50] be turned back
[10:52] not just to another church not to just
[10:54] another gener a denomination not just
[10:57] another church in the message some of
[10:59] you have come out of other churches some
[11:01] of you have had other ministries some of
[11:03] you have come off the streets and you
[11:05] know that in the world the things of
[11:08] life and the matters and the situation
[11:11] was not always beautiful
[11:13] satan is a rough taskmaster isn't he
[11:15] brothers and satan did not treat you
[11:18] well but our god is beautiful for
[11:21] situation
[11:22] he's he is uh beautiful for the matters
[11:26] of life that really matter out of your
[11:28] heart
[11:30] keep your heart for out of it are the
[11:32] issues of life that's where
[11:35] um it's the seed of your emotions and
[11:37] all of your desires and it's the central
[11:40] part of everything and that's why god
[11:43] needed to send a prophet to this
[11:45] generation
[11:46] it wasn't just changing the music he
[11:49] wasn't just changing you know how people
[11:51] preach but he was changing the hearts of
[11:55] the predestinated
[11:57] hallelujah
[11:58] where is the generation that would say
[12:01] lord give me a new heart
[12:04] i need a new spirit lord i realize that
[12:07] i have nothing to bring but filthiness
[12:10] i was born in sin
[12:12] shaped in iniquity all of us were
[12:14] brother john was born in jeffersonville
[12:17] raised in the branham tabernacle and
[12:19] been in the message for 49 years our
[12:21] whole life but it's got to go beyond our
[12:23] head knowledge it's got to go beyond
[12:25] knowing brother branham or knowing his
[12:27] family or saying brother branham said or
[12:30] being able to quote the bible there's
[12:32] got to be a generation that says my
[12:34] heart has been turned back
[12:37] hallelujah
[12:38] my heart has been turned
[12:40] so tonight when we speak about that
[12:42] generation i'm just going to get into
[12:44] what brother branham said about this in
[12:46] just a moment the generation has to do
[12:49] with the group of believers whether
[12:51] you're young or whether you're old so
[12:54] when we say the children our hearts have
[12:57] been turned back it's more than just the
[12:58] young people it's young and old that are
[13:01] alive and that are remaining until the
[13:05] coming of the lord
[13:06] there's going to be a generation of
[13:08] believers no matter our backgrounds no
[13:10] matter what we've gone through
[13:13] in our lives that is going to grab ahold
[13:15] of this word and it's going to go in the
[13:17] rapture
[13:19] i believe the arizona believer's church
[13:21] is founded on that i believe that your
[13:23] foundation
[13:25] it's not our backgrounds it's that
[13:27] matter it's what we believe it's it's
[13:29] who we are in christ
[13:31] it's what the word has said you are
[13:35] hallelujah we might come broken but god
[13:39] is a healer of the brokenhearted
[13:42] the wounded ones
[13:44] so the generation with a new heart we
[13:47] read that in ezekiel when it talks about
[13:50] that god would give you a new heart can
[13:53] you put back that first slide of our
[13:55] opening one that shows uh brother john
[13:57] that you did so well on that showed the
[14:00] title and the scripture ezekiel
[14:02] says i will give you a new heart i just
[14:05] want you to listen real closely
[14:07] a new heart
[14:09] and a new spirit
[14:12] and ezekiel 36 said i will give you my
[14:16] spirit
[14:18] so it's not going to be you trying the
[14:20] best you can or you trying to serve the
[14:23] lord or you say brother john i'm trying
[14:26] to live right we got it all backwards
[14:29] the holy spirit is god coming inside of
[14:32] you
[14:32] and living his own life
[14:36] we got to get it out of me trying and me
[14:39] doing and me going it's him coming
[14:42] inside of you
[14:44] and living his own life
[14:46] and he does that pretty easily
[14:49] god's pr he does that pretty well would
[14:51] you all agree
[14:52] when god takes over it's done right
[14:56] but we get our hands on it it just
[14:58] messes up everything i mean
[15:00] we're not taking a vote tonight and all
[15:02] doing the best we can
[15:05] we're we are actually receiving the
[15:07] heart of god
[15:09] receiving the word of god and just let
[15:11] him do it
[15:13] let him manifest his perfect will so
[15:16] where is that generation that will say
[15:20] not my will but thine be done
[15:22] where is that individual or family or
[15:26] church that will say i am part of the
[15:29] generation who has a new heart or a new
[15:33] spirit or his spirit my spirit which is
[15:37] his holy spirit
[15:39] his heart
[15:42] his word
[15:44] what he wants to do
[15:46] in the matter
[15:49] now in malachi chapter 4 5 and 6 that we
[15:53] read and most of you know it by heart
[15:55] that we would we would receive a prophet
[15:58] that would turn our hearts back brother
[16:01] branham spoke about that in the church
[16:03] age book page 324 malachi 4 5 behold i
[16:07] will send you elijah the prophet before
[16:09] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[16:11] of the lord and he
[16:14] shall turn the heart of the fathers
[16:17] to the children
[16:19] now that's very good brother john thank
[16:20] you for bringing that up because we see
[16:22] in verse six
[16:24] two parts of this elijah's ministry is
[16:27] to turn the hearts of the fathers
[16:30] to the children
[16:32] that's number one
[16:34] number two is the heart of the children
[16:37] to their fathers but brother branham in
[16:39] the church age book talked about that
[16:41] first part the heart of the fathers
[16:43] to the children and he was
[16:46] quoting luke 1 17. don't bring that up
[16:48] brother john just keep malachi up
[16:50] because it talks about how brother
[16:52] branham says that first part was already
[16:54] accomplished in the ministry of john the
[16:57] baptist
[16:59] hallelujah john the baptist turned the
[17:02] hearts
[17:03] of the fathers to the children
[17:06] comma
[17:07] and the heart of the children to their
[17:09] fathers
[17:10] brother branham goes on to say
[17:14] he's quoting luke 1 17 about the spirit
[17:17] of elias and how it would come and
[17:18] prepare
[17:20] a people for the lord he said in the
[17:22] ministry of john the hearts of the
[17:24] fathers were turned to the children we
[17:27] know that because jesus said so but it
[17:29] does not say that the hearts of the
[17:31] children
[17:32] were turned to the fathers that is yet
[17:35] to take place
[17:37] here's a prophet speaking in the church
[17:39] age book that that is yet to take place
[17:43] that was the anointing of elijah in our
[17:46] day is to turn the hearts of the
[17:48] children to the fathers
[17:51] can i ask you tonight that believe the
[17:53] message of the hour william branham
[17:55] fulfilled that part of elijah coming
[17:58] do we believe that but where are the
[18:01] children whose hearts are to be turned
[18:03] back
[18:05] because we could talk about his brother
[18:07] branham a prophet was it a you know thor
[18:09] missile that went up and what was it you
[18:11] know the head of christ we could talk
[18:13] about the bridge you know friends you
[18:15] could talk all evening about all the
[18:16] discrepancies you know but there is a
[18:19] truth to it all
[18:20] and they've tried to humanize it and
[18:22] discount it and you know why don't they
[18:24] just go into the world and just go out
[18:26] why do they fight it so much it's
[18:28] because it's the truth
[18:31] people that leave the message and they
[18:33] want to deface the message well why
[18:35] don't they deface the catholic church or
[18:37] the pentecostal church or something you
[18:40] know they want to attack the message
[18:42] it's because it's an evil spirit
[18:44] and they many times are worse than even
[18:47] people in the world
[18:49] i don't know if you've experienced that
[18:50] here in phoenix but
[18:53] globally i've seen that people that
[18:54] leave the message become more weird
[18:57] than people that are in the world
[19:00] i'm just saying that nicely that their
[19:01] hair gets pink and red and blue and
[19:03] their fingernails toenails and their
[19:06] attitude and they become so nasty pasty
[19:08] now and they just get so much in a
[19:10] certain way god never let that happen to
[19:13] me
[19:14] give us a new heart lord give us a new
[19:16] spirit don't ever let me get contrary
[19:19] and bitter brother branham said that is
[19:21] yet to take place where the hearts of
[19:24] the children would be turned back the
[19:26] hearts of the last day children will be
[19:29] turned back to the pentecostal fathers
[19:32] john got the fathers ready for jesus
[19:36] to welcome the children into the fold
[19:39] this prophet upon whom the spirit of
[19:42] elijah falls will prepare the children
[19:46] to welcome back
[19:48] jesus
[19:50] how many believe brother branham was a
[19:51] prophet
[19:53] i just want to read that one more time
[19:55] this prophet
[19:56] upon whom the spirit of elijah falls
[19:59] will prepare the children to welcome
[20:02] back jesus
[20:03] so there's an anointing tonight
[20:06] on a generation of last day children and
[20:09] people whose hearts
[20:12] are to be turned back to perfect faith
[20:16] there was a perfect word that was spoken
[20:19] for us that is to bring perfect faith
[20:22] where is that tonight
[20:24] hallelujah i believe i'm looking at some
[20:27] of the people that's going to make it
[20:29] with perfect faith
[20:31] whose hearts and this was the word here
[20:35] verse 6 he shall turn
[20:38] the heart
[20:39] he shall turn
[20:41] the heart what's going to happen
[20:43] to the people that's alive that's going
[20:46] to turn a turn heart
[20:48] it's two-fold
[20:50] you're going to be turned from
[20:52] something
[20:54] whatever it was in your past you're
[20:56] going to turn from that
[20:58] but we've got to turn to

[21:22] of that prophecy we believe a mighty
[21:25] angel has come we believe that that
[21:27] earthly messenger was sent to us but now
[21:30] we've got to eat the book we've got to
[21:32] eat the word we've got to feast on these
[21:34] promises and then prophesy again
[21:37] where are those people that are hungry
[21:40] for the word of god

[21:44] people used to be so passionate about
[21:46] sports or passionate about movies today
[21:49] they that you know they become so
[21:51] passionate about their media obsession

[23:10] become a disease
[23:13] that clouds our mind and clouds our
[23:15] spirit
[23:16] and and actually if we're not careful it
[23:19] will open up a person's a soul by
[23:22] entering through those gates of the mind
[23:24] and spirit you can open up yourself to a
[23:27] wrong spirit i'm speaking to the heart
[23:30] of the matter
[23:32] god open up our hearts to your word
[23:37] let us be discerning of the time we're
[23:39] living in and not get lazy but be
[23:42] spiritually
[23:44] in tune god brought you out of drugs or
[23:46] out of alcohol or out of a church that
[23:48] was maybe twisted but friends don't get
[23:51] caught in another trap
[23:53] hallelujah god turn our hearts
[23:57] turn means
[24:00] to return or to
[24:02] turn back means to
[24:04] come back like the prodigal son let's
[24:07] come back home
[24:09] or like a prodigal daughter or
[24:11] a young lady that might be in depression
[24:14] or might be suffering from bitterness or
[24:16] trouble
[24:17] it's time to come back to your right
[24:19] mind i'm inviting you back to
[24:21] right thinking
[24:23] receive the heart of god
[24:25] he's not double minded he's not confused
[24:28] i think the bible says he's not the
[24:30] author of confusion
[24:32] he's not double-minded he's not he's
[24:35] focused he knows his will for your life
[24:39] it might be a mystery to you but it's
[24:41] not a mystery to god
[24:44] we say all the mysteries have been
[24:45] revealed well that's more than the
[24:47] seventh seven seals it has to do with
[24:50] the mystery of god about your life and
[24:53] that's what most of you are struggling
[24:55] with as finding god's will or finding
[24:57] his purpose you can pick up a seven
[24:59] church age book or pick up seven seals
[25:02] but it's now lord what is your will for
[25:04] my life what is your direction for our
[25:06] family what would you have for us just
[25:09] give me the right spirit lord so i can
[25:12] begin to pray i can get into your mind
[25:15] about this situation
[25:17] are we all together tonight
[25:19] and maybe there's a stony heart that you
[25:22] have
[25:23] that the plow keeps hitting against
[25:26] and god wants to take that out of you
[25:29] stony heart stony will a stubbornness
[25:33] something that's laying there
[25:35] and to return or a turn heart means that
[25:40] it's time to repent
[25:43] that just simply means you're going in a
[25:44] certain direction and you're turning
[25:48] romans chapter
[25:50] romans i i spoke on that on sunday
[25:52] morning about the goodness of god
[25:55] leads you to repentance
[25:57] so you have to be willing to
[26:00] take the hand of goodness
[26:03] and let him lead you away from that
[26:05] thing
[26:06] it's the goodness of god that leads you
[26:09] to repentance
[26:11] so you you don't want to kick against
[26:13] the pricks and keep hitting against the
[26:15] the thing or the someone or the
[26:17] conviction that's the holy spirit let me
[26:20] just step back and say something that's
[26:22] a good sign that you're a seed of god
[26:24] when god stays on your case
[26:27] stop getting frustrated and stop trying
[26:29] to shovel in a bunch of nonsense and
[26:31] fill it up with a bunch of things of the
[26:34] world when really you're hungry for more
[26:36] of god you're you're thirsting for
[26:39] reality you're thirsting for a new heart
[26:42] that's not a bad spirit that's the holy
[26:45] spirit trying to give you his heart
[26:50] hallelujah so it's speaking of human
[26:53] relationships and of spiritual relations
[26:56] that god wants to turn you back to god
[26:59] and turn you from evil
[27:01] he wants to turn our hearts
[27:05] to restore you and refresh you
[27:09] and repair you
[27:12] are you a work in progress
[27:14] well that's a good testimony that means
[27:16] you're a progress
[27:18] are you going through a trial
[27:21] i'm working with you a little bit i'm
[27:23] not brother aaron i'm brother john amen
[27:25] is that okay
[27:27] if you're going through a trial that's a
[27:29] good thing because you're going through
[27:32] brother mitch you're going through a
[27:34] trial so
[27:35] instead of saying i'm going to worry
[27:38] i'm going through a trial that god is
[27:41] carrying me through he's teaching us
[27:43] he's given me a new heart about that see
[27:46] we're born with a human nature it's like
[27:48] brother elijah's given me directions up
[27:50] to his house well brother john just go
[27:52] down to this red light and turn right
[27:55] and then go to the next red light and
[27:56] make a left why don't we say the green
[27:59] light
[28:01] why don't we brother elijah say just go
[28:03] to the green light and then go to the
[28:05] next green light we're so made negative
[28:07] go to the red light go well just you're
[28:09] not going to go unless it's green so go
[28:12] to the green light
[28:15] we're so negative you know
[28:17] well you gave me a glass of water
[28:19] brother brother michael gave me a glass
[28:21] of water and it was
[28:22] half empty
[28:25] why are you so negative why don't you
[28:27] say thank you brother michael for being
[28:29] half full
[28:32] is that right we're we're not careful
[28:34] we're just automatically and by the way
[28:37] it's it's more than half
[28:40] full i just made an illustration amen
[28:45] why do we lean toward the negative why
[28:47] are we so quick to because that's that
[28:50] other nature that's battling us even you
[28:53] that have received the new heart you
[28:55] just need to surrender to the holy
[28:57] spirit and let him lead you away from
[29:00] the things of the world and to be
[29:02] restored means to allow him to do this
[29:04] work in your life to turn means that
[29:08] you're not going to draw back always
[29:10] with his dealings i mean it's time to
[29:13] give back it's time to relinquish
[29:16] the hold of the enemy it's time to
[29:19] give a payment in full he's already done
[29:21] that
[29:23] sometimes we talk about satan or the
[29:25] devil and the tormentor
[29:29] but tonight to turn a heart that is
[29:31] turned means
[29:32] that there comes a power in you that is
[29:35] repulsing against the tormentor
[29:38] he's hindering the work of satan god is
[29:41] here in your life to stop the work of
[29:44] satan and to reject the devil
[29:47] do you like that it goes back to ezekiel
[29:50] though the opening scripture that says
[29:53] cast away from you all your
[29:55] transgressions
[29:56] and make you a new heart and a new
[29:59] spirit let's make way for god to move
[30:04] let's make way
[30:06] are you interested
[30:08] he comes to those that are interested
[30:11] if you're not interested then you're
[30:13] probably not going to get the benefit of
[30:14] it if your attitude's wrong then he's
[30:17] probably going to have to work on the
[30:18] attitude a little bit that's why he says
[30:20] i'm going to give you a new heart and a
[30:22] new spirit he's going to give you a
[30:24] spirit that would finally say lord i
[30:26] surrender
[30:28] brother michael let us in a song that
[30:30] brokenness brokenness
[30:32] is what i long for that's totally
[30:34] contrary to most humans in laodicea they
[30:38] say brokenness we're supposed to be
[30:40] strong
[30:41] we're supposed to have it all together
[30:44] they glorify you know the gold and the
[30:47] silver and the bronze
[30:49] well there's a lot of other people that
[30:51] that did a lot of good things it doesn't
[30:53] make them bad
[30:54] we can train our children that you got
[30:56] to be first you got to be number one
[30:58] that's not right we want you to be what
[31:00] god's called you to be
[31:02] the world is telling us well you can be
[31:05] anything that you want to be and the
[31:07] word is telling us i want you to be what
[31:10] i've called you to be
[31:12] and if that's with a weakness or if
[31:14] that's with a limitation or and there's
[31:16] certain things even in our natural
[31:18] realms we have limitations stop using
[31:20] that as a crutch just rise up with that
[31:23] new heart and say lord i want to be all
[31:26] that you have called me to be
[31:28] let me ask you tonight where is that
[31:30] generation that's going to be like that
[31:34] it's going to have that kind of a turn
[31:37] hard and where you are being restored
[31:39] and brought back to your right mind and
[31:41] back to your right senses i just say
[31:43] lord i'm available to you
[31:45] for you to give me a new heart about
[31:47] this
[31:48] if i've been thinking wrong then put
[31:50] your thoughts in me
[31:52] and i'll start thinking your thoughts i
[31:54] mean friends the world is trying to cram
[31:57] it down your throat
[31:59] every single day with their media and
[32:01] their news and their progression and all
[32:04] the flashy boards to they want you to
[32:06] draw you in buy this go here
[32:10] even on your highway signs vaccinations
[32:12] and this and that i thought we were
[32:14] going on a highway
[32:16] what's vaccinations have to do with
[32:18] going down this highway
[32:21] it shows how politics has even taken
[32:23] over the highway signs
[32:26] and i don't want to get into that
[32:30] you know we've all experienced that in
[32:32] the last
[32:33] you know 16 17 months of this virus and
[32:37] things and i don't want to get on that
[32:40] but you know satan has achieved
[32:43] in the last few months a great plan of
[32:46] his
[32:47] and that was to distract the believers
[32:49] away from the word of god
[32:52] and to get our minds on numbers and
[32:56] deaths and disease and
[32:59] you know what's it like in arizona
[33:01] what's it like in california what's it
[33:04] like in florida and we can start getting
[33:07] our minds on natural things i'm looking
[33:10] for my notes because i'd written
[33:12] something about that and it was like
[33:14] satan has devised a great plan
[33:17] for this hour and many have fallen to it
[33:22] they got caught up in it and you can see
[33:25] how easily
[33:27] they have become distracted
[33:35] you know
[33:36] sometimes i could ask you what state was
[33:39] you born in what state was you born in
[33:42] we could talk about
[33:44] a certain state
[33:45] that a person
[33:47] you might go to for vacation
[33:50] you know arizona in the summertime isn't
[33:52] a place where a lot of people come to
[33:54] for vacation

[34:39] what is it it shows how the people of
[34:42] this world are their hearts have been
[34:45] programmed for a tribulation

[34:50] tribulation they've become numb

[35:01] trained and sometimes they're so good on
[35:03] those things what about the things of
[35:05] god
[35:06] god's trying to get our minds in this
[35:08] generation on the things of god where is
[35:11] that generation though we acknowledge
[35:13] all these natural things and i'm not
[35:15] denying brother michael that we need to
[35:18] manage those natural things but it's the
[35:20] spiritual things
[35:21] god give us a new heart tonight and turn
[35:24] me
[35:26] to the things that are god of god

[38:39] practical and outworking in our lives
[38:43] you know are we doing okay
[38:46] after the seals in 1963 there was a big
[38:49] thing and you can even google it today
[38:51] they would say the number one killer of
[38:54] human beings is heart disease
[38:56] heart disease
[38:58] we're speaking on that tonight a new
[39:00] heart
[39:01] but not just naturally but the world
[39:03] will tell you that the number one killer
[39:06] is heart disease it was in the 60s and
[39:08] it is today if you want to google it
[39:11] brother branham said you've heard people
[39:12] say the number one killer is heart
[39:15] disease
[39:16] i differ with him
[39:18] not to be different
[39:19] i just differ because i know it's wrong
[39:22] the number one killer is sin disease
[39:26] right not all heart disease it's sin
[39:29] disease
[39:30] our number one heart disease he said the
[39:33] main thing that kills the people today
[39:35] it's number one
[39:37] sin disease
[39:38] it's unbelief
[39:40] it's the number one
[39:42] sin disease that kills the people today
[39:45] spiritually
[39:46] and that'll make them kill them
[39:48] physically
[39:51] now if i can get some of you to believe
[39:52] this tonight it'll really help you
[39:55] our many times our natural
[39:58] conditions are reflecting a spiritual
[40:00] condition
[40:02] and that's where people shake their head
[40:04] and say no it doesn't and all they give
[40:06] all kinds of excuses and want to blame
[40:08] their dad and blame their mom and blame
[40:10] a preacher no you are tonight what you
[40:12] want to be
[40:14] we might as well just be what god wants
[40:16] us to be and say i'm not going to blame
[40:18] it on my past lord let me rise up out of
[40:20] this
[40:21] give me a new heart about that and give
[40:23] me wings to fly
[40:25] out of my situation
[40:27] i believe there's enough power in this
[40:29] service somebody walk in a brother
[40:31] michael out from this uh highway or walk
[40:34] into this motel in here that is totally
[40:36] demon-possessed that jesus is here to
[40:38] deliver them
[40:42] do you all believe that
[40:44] then why sit we here
[40:46] with spiritual conditions week after
[40:48] week or week after week and let satan
[40:51] torment and trouble your minds you might
[40:54] as well just be set free
[40:56] you might not be a visitor but you might
[40:58] be so common with your situation that
[41:01] you're denying the power of god it's
[41:04] time to get plugged in to the power and
[41:06] say god flow through me holy spirit let
[41:09] there be a revival in me
[41:12] shake off my lethargy shake off my sin
[41:16] disease
[41:17] some of you might be dying of the number
[41:19] one killer of america
[41:21] is sin disease

[44:37] to hear
[44:39] i'll give you a little testimony and
[44:41] more on sunday if that's okay but
[44:43] tonight i'll just give a little
[44:45] testimony of a 16 year old young lady
[44:47] that was raised in the message and her
[44:50] father was actually a minister of the
[44:52] gospel but she
[44:54] coming up as a teenager
[44:56] coming up through her adolescent years
[45:00] she began to go through a time of
[45:02] depression
[45:04] this is her own personal words to to
[45:06] myself and my wife a few weeks ago we
[45:09] were preaching in their church some
[45:11] youth meetings and
[45:13] and now she's an older sister with
[45:15] children not older but middle-aged with
[45:17] children but she was speaking about
[45:19] being raised in the message as a
[45:21] 16-year-old young lady fighting for her
[45:24] life
[45:26] she said i wanted to die
[45:29] she started cutting herself
[45:32] she got so low and
[45:34] started cutting herself that spirit of
[45:36] suicide
[45:38] was on her demon spirit trying to
[45:42] take her heart
[45:43] take her future
[45:45] take her life
[45:47] but god miraculously
[45:49] done a work within her life and gave her
[45:52] that desperation and god delivered her
[45:55] and just a wonderful deliverance and she
[45:57] gave her heart to christ and was filled
[45:59] with the holy ghost
[46:01] she attended louisiana camp and some of
[46:04] you've heard this testimony but as she
[46:06] was attending louisiana camp there it's
[46:08] it's it's kind of warm in march and
[46:10] april when they have the camp and so
[46:12] here she was with you know hundreds of
[46:14] other young people and believers
[46:17] she wanted to worship god she wanted to
[46:19] express her appreciation of god's
[46:21] goodness
[46:22] but she had all of these scars
[46:25] she had all of these visible signs of
[46:30] that time of her life that she wasn't
[46:32] proud of
[46:34] even though she was raised in the
[46:35] message she had gone through that
[46:38] time of trouble
[46:40] she was just embarrassed to raise her
[46:43] hands because of the scars everyone's
[46:45] rejoicing everyone's entering in but she
[46:48] said lord i want to thank you i want to
[46:50] praise you i'm just going to worship the
[46:52] lord anyway and she just stood up and
[46:53] raised her hands to the lord and began
[46:56] to worship him and her testimony is that
[46:59] when she sat back down and looked at her
[47:01] arm all the scars were gone
[47:04] worship scars she was willing to give up
[47:08] in worship and give her life
[47:10] and the scars god took care of those
[47:12] scars
[47:14] now she's given a testimony this is
[47:16] years later and she has children of her
[47:18] own she was starving for life she was
[47:21] looking for answers and that demon
[47:24] spirit was trying to break her in her
[47:26] time of awkwardness
[47:28] but the lord broke him in her time of
[47:32] awkwardness and gave her a divine
[47:34] connection i just want to say praise god
[47:38] for that hope for that spirit for that
[47:41] life that can be breathed into our
[47:43] children into our families
[47:45] into our teenagers
[47:47] into your wives and to your husbands we
[47:49] need that tonight
[47:53] i encourage you to leave the state of
[47:55] brokenness and move to the state of his
[47:59] heart
[48:01] move away from a taskmaster that's given
[48:04] you scars
[48:06] and move to the state of god's heart
[48:10] so it's not just a new heart or a new
[48:13] spirit but it's his spirit
[48:17] that's where we've got to go to tonight
[48:19] i most of you've heard of justification
[48:22] sanctification
[48:24] and the baptism of the holy ghost and
[48:25] brother branham talked about the
[48:27] scriptures in ezekiel about a new heart
[48:29] and a new spirit but he said that third
[48:31] part is
[48:33] my heart
[48:34] my spirit that's what he and my spirit
[48:37] that's what we need don't stop there
[48:40] just with part of returning you can say
[48:43] i come out of the world or i come out of
[48:45] that situation brother john and then
[48:47] live like we've got to go into
[48:50] god's inviting some of you tonight to go
[48:52] into
[48:54] the heart of god
[48:56] so the number one killer is not
[48:59] natural heart disease it's spiritual
[49:02] condition of unbelief of sin just watch
[49:05] this where he said the spiritual is
[49:08] manifested even in the natural
[49:10] he said because they already can prove
[49:13] i'm quoting after the seals
[49:15] the men that hold grudges
[49:19] people that hold grudges
[49:21] and women who fuss
[49:23] and stew
[49:25] and fight
[49:26] and argue they
[49:28] die it'll cause cancer
[49:32] fungus
[49:33] and everything else will set in and
[49:36] ulcers
[49:38] you say brother john i've got this ulcer
[49:40] i've got this fungus or i've got this
[49:41] situation
[49:43] in my life and and we can talk about
[49:45] cancer and all these things but really
[49:47] it's a spirit behind that brother
[49:49] branham is trying to give us some heart
[49:50] medicine tonight
[49:52] that if you hold grudges and you fuss
[49:55] and stew and fight that sounds like
[49:58] maybe the way some of your families used
[50:00] to be or maybe how you were raised or
[50:02] you see it out people argue fuss hold
[50:04] grudges and and they're just always
[50:06] fighting it that's not the holy spirit
[50:14] well that's just the way i am well you
[50:17] need to die to yourself
[50:20] that's not going to go on the rapture
[50:21] sister brother i don't care if you've
[50:23] been in the message 84 years
[50:29] i was in pentecost and i received the
[50:31] message and now i'm 20 21. well you're
[50:33] probably a little elderly
[50:36] have patience for the rest of us that's
[50:37] coming up you know
[50:39] but if if you get old and cranky and you
[50:42] bitter and against everything
[50:44] that's not the holy spirit you've lost
[50:47] your heart brother you you need a new
[50:49] heart and a heart of flesh to have
[50:51] patience and rest until the rest of us
[50:53] can show up somebody that has a real
[50:55] revelation isn't mean and nasty and
[50:58] condescending
[51:00] they're welcoming you they're saying
[51:02] come on in to the state i want you to be
[51:04] free too
[51:06] is that okay i'm inviting you tonight to
[51:09] leave your state of brokenness and come
[51:12] to the state of his heart where god can
[51:14] bless you god can fill you
[51:19] and maybe there are symptoms of a heart
[51:21] issue or symptoms of a heart condition
[51:24] and god's just trying to encourage you
[51:26] tonight that he's here to take that away
[51:28] from you and give you a new heart
[51:32] you know in victory day right here in
[51:34] sarah vista i was just with
[51:36] pastor robert figueroa on sunday night
[51:38] he came to the service in tucson
[51:41] and it's in sarah vista where he's
[51:43] pastoring and brother branham preached
[51:45] in victory day after the seals and he
[51:47] said there was a young lady last night
[51:49] in an interview
[51:51] she was a minister's daughter had signed
[51:54] some kind of a little love affair
[51:56] and she had lost her mind about it
[51:59] and she's gone a breakdown
[52:03] a very beautiful young woman about 23
[52:06] years old
[52:08] brother branham wasn't always talking
[52:10] about rainbows and mysteries and
[52:12] thunders he was trying to bring the
[52:14] message
[52:15] down to a place where the people could
[52:17] rise up to this plate this coming up to
[52:20] the state and here's a young lady that
[52:22] was 23 years old
[52:29] she was a minister's daughter she had
[52:32] been caught in a love affair lost her
[52:33] mind about it she had a breakdown she
[52:36] was beautiful
[52:38] but if you go back into her life
[52:41] when she was 12 years old
[52:44] is anybody 12 years old here
[52:46] brother elijah any of your girls 12 or
[52:48] anybody over here 12 everybody's old
[52:50] everybody's getting older
[52:52] young or younger
[52:54] when she was 12 years old
[52:58] in
[52:58] chicago
[53:00] or another place elgin in chicago he
[53:02] said sitting in a meeting the holy
[53:04] spirit went out through the audience and
[53:06] called her who she was and said you've
[53:10] got a murmuring heart this is a little
[53:12] girl in the audience and said
[53:16] told her her name and said you've got a
[53:18] murmuring heart who's ever heard of that
[53:20] before a heart condition a murmuring
[53:23] heart
[53:24] the doctor says you can't live till
[53:26] you're 15 years old
[53:28] but thus saith the lord you're healed
[53:32] and she never never even felt heart
[53:35] trouble since
[53:37] can we say praise the lord now

[54:19] y'all believe in laughing amen and
[54:22] something was said and i heard that
[54:23] everyone just bust out and i'm glad
[54:25] that's a good quality
[54:27] arizona believer's church just keep that
[54:29] amen i i've been to someone
[54:38] and they can preach a whole message or
[54:39] go through a whole service and
[54:41] be so serious it's like i believe in
[54:43] being serious
[54:45] be still and know that i am god
[54:48] i believe that verse too you know
[54:52] but i don't believe he's always still
[54:54] and i don't believe i believe when
[54:56] there's some energy and the word comes
[54:58] it ought to bring some happiness and joy
[55:00] and
[55:01] take the medicine and
[55:04] if you take medicine take some medicine
[55:07] and you really got to receive what i'm
[55:08] telling you tonight it's so wonderful
[55:11] it's so great
[55:13] and the most activity is their eyes
[55:15] it's the most wonderful thing
[55:18] it's the most wonderful thing
[55:20] to serve the lord and it's like really
[55:23] really
[55:26] it's no wonder people don't want to
[55:28] serve the lord it's so boring they've
[55:30] made it so dry
[55:31] sometimes we need a good shout out
[55:35] sometimes we need a big rain we need a
[55:37] thunder cloud you know
[55:39] i think last year was pretty dry here
[55:41] right
[55:42] and this year you're breaking all the
[55:44] records
[55:45] well may you break the record
[55:47] hallelujah may you just break the record
[55:50] say last year was tough brother john but
[55:52] this year break the record
[55:54] i'm talking spiritually let this church
[55:57] just break out of yourselves and
[56:00] be free and be happy
[56:02] say we used to live in a certain state
[56:05] we were wounded but now we don't let
[56:07] that control us no more
[56:09] we've moved to another state
[56:12] or did you use u-haul or rider no
[56:15] brother the holy spirit did something
[56:17] for us
[56:18] i was sitting in my seat i was hearing a
[56:21] message i i was had my hands in the
[56:23] dishwater some somebody gave a testimony
[56:26] about a 16 year old young lady and i
[56:29] thought wow if she can feel that way
[56:31] maybe i that's the way i'm it's
[56:33] identifying a spirit that's even right
[56:35] in the message of suicide and depression
[56:38] you can be free of that
[56:43] you say well what about the scars well
[56:45] god will take care of those two
[56:47] and you might have them till the rapture
[56:49] but on the other side they'll be worship
[56:51] scars you can just say
[56:53] god allowed that to happen
[56:55] so that i can help someone else
[57:00] so here's a young lady
[57:02] brother elijah it'd be like you and one
[57:04] of your beautiful
[57:06] ladies there that's all been born since
[57:08] i was with you
[57:10] back in the 90s
[57:12] a 12 year old young lady would be like
[57:14] one of our beautiful sisters here you're
[57:16] hearing from the doctor
[57:19] she's only got three years to live
[57:23] i mean we'd be more serious i mean it'd
[57:25] be a prayer request it would be
[57:28] it's serious i mean that young lady we
[57:30] would want to
[57:31] love her more we'd give her attention
[57:33] she's probably not going to be with us
[57:35] but three years that's what the doctor
[57:36] said
[57:37] the doctor said she's got a murmuring
[57:39] heart
[57:40] she's only 12 years old and
[57:43] probably won't be 15 but in a holy
[57:45] ghost-filled meeting god called her out
[57:47] and said
[57:48] you are healed
[57:50] and for the rest of her life she never
[57:52] had a heart murmuring heart trouble but
[57:55] now she's 23 years old
[57:58] so you do the math a few years later
[58:00] through the teenage years and 20s she
[58:02] gets involved with a young man in a love
[58:04] affair and loses her mind and is having
[58:08] a breakdown
[58:09] and brother branham said last night
[58:12] she had a different type of heart
[58:14] trouble
[58:17] it was spiritual
[58:18] heart trouble so brother john's just
[58:21] going a little bit deeper tonight
[58:22] because we can
[58:24] ask how you're doing and how's your job
[58:26] and how's the horses and what kind of
[58:29] car you drive and that's all nice
[58:31] but really the heart of the matter is
[58:34] the main thing how are you doing in your
[58:37] heart and
[58:38] if you have a murmuring heart god's here
[58:40] to heal that tonight
[58:43] then as the time goes on you might have
[58:45] another spiritual heart trouble god's
[58:47] here to heal that too
[58:49] spiritual or natural god's our healer
[58:53] can the church say amen
[58:56] whatever disorder whatever illness
[58:59] condition ailment or state you are or
[59:03] form or the result of a situation i want
[59:06] to announce to you tonight there is help
[59:09] for you
[59:12] there is a bomb and a healing agent that
[59:14] can deal with your situation and help
[59:16] you in your time of need
[59:19] is there a bomb in phoenix
[59:22] b-a-l-m
[59:25] bomb is there a bomb in gilead
[59:29] is there a physician
[59:30] here let me ask this church i know i'm
[59:33] being personal my first service with you
[59:36] who's your physician
[59:38] well let me dig in my purse or dig in my
[59:40] wall let me see no it's the great
[59:42] physician
[59:43] jesus is my physician
[59:46] i believe in doctors i believe in nurses
[59:48] i believe in hospitals
[59:51] god is my healer
[59:53] and i'm looking to him
[59:56] how many knows jesus died of a broken
[59:58] heart
[1:00:00] i have it right in front of me in
[1:00:01] jeffersonville brother branham said he
[1:00:03] died of a broken heart
[1:00:05] he died of grief
[1:00:08] he died he says it two times
[1:00:11] paragraph 30 and paragraph 31 he died of
[1:00:14] a broken heart
[1:00:15] with such grief for the world to a
[1:00:17] chemical reaction taking place in his
[1:00:20] body
[1:00:23] a broken heart
[1:00:26] they rejected me they
[1:00:30] the people i came to love they turned me
[1:00:33] down my family the jews
[1:00:36] they turned me over to the romans they
[1:00:38] killed me he died
[1:00:40] of a broken heart
[1:00:42] is that possible
[1:00:44] brother brother just told us it was
[1:00:46] then is it possible if he's the
[1:00:48] bridegroom
[1:00:50] that the bride
[1:00:52] could suffer from a broken heart i'm
[1:00:54] asking you tonight
[1:00:57] it's actually a medical
[1:01:00] condition it's called
[1:01:05] broken heart syndrome
[1:01:08] it's a heart condition where a person
[1:01:10] goes through stressful situations
[1:01:12] emotional extreme emotional things that
[1:01:16] trigger
[1:01:17] serious illness and it needs surgery
[1:01:20] it's a literal medical
[1:01:22] condition called broken heart syndrome
[1:01:25] where
[1:01:26] it's a condition and it can cause
[1:01:28] sudden sharp chest pains and shortness
[1:01:31] of breath these symptoms
[1:01:33] they can be severe and stress of life
[1:01:36] where a person can literally be walking
[1:01:40] they can they call it walking dead
[1:01:42] where you are walking and your arteries
[1:01:45] are almost totally clogged up you're
[1:01:46] about to die
[1:01:48] whether jason watkins a pastor in south
[1:01:50] carolina was having this just a few
[1:01:52] weeks ago
[1:01:53] and the shortness of breath and he goes
[1:01:55] for walks and he went across the
[1:01:57] neighborhood he said i don't even know
[1:01:58] if i can get back home just shortness of
[1:02:00] breath and
[1:02:01] he went and got some check they couldn't
[1:02:03] find it they couldn't find what it was
[1:02:05] and he was in finally one time and he
[1:02:07] had one of those during that
[1:02:10] that visit
[1:02:11] and they were able to diagnose it and
[1:02:13] his main artery was 99 blocked he was
[1:02:17] literally walking he could have died in
[1:02:19] a moment
[1:02:21] you need immediate surgery you need like
[1:02:23] immediate and they went in through his
[1:02:25] arm it's amazing went up and put splints
[1:02:28] into his heart
[1:02:29] and he's strong and vibrant and able to
[1:02:31] pastor a church that's the grace of god
[1:02:35] if they can do that in the natural what
[1:02:37] about the spiritual
[1:02:39] where years ago and i got a picture on
[1:02:41] my ipad i don't think you want to look
[1:02:42] at it too long but it's called open
[1:02:44] heart surgery years ago they would have
[1:02:46] opened up your whole heart they would
[1:02:48] have cut your bones
[1:02:50] pulled back everything it would have
[1:02:51] taken weeks of recovery
[1:02:56] if science is that developed
[1:02:58] where they can go in do a heart check
[1:03:01] god put in a splint and oh you can
[1:03:04] breathe
[1:03:05] now you can walk now you can live
[1:03:08] what about the spiritual
[1:03:11] is god able to do that friend
[1:03:15] god is doing that tonight for you he's
[1:03:17] breathing
[1:03:19] he's breathing life into you breathing
[1:03:22] strength into you breathing open to you
[1:03:26] i'm checking my time
[1:03:28] it's time to go isn't it
[1:03:36] i know but brother aaron's probably
[1:03:37] watching me on the internet
[1:03:40] he's probably saying yep just cut it off
[1:03:42] and go to sunday
[1:03:44] i was sitting in the service the other
[1:03:46] week and i thought how long then does it
[1:03:48] take for
[1:03:49] open heart surgery because it's not a
[1:03:51] 20-minute thing
[1:03:52] you know we've been raised with
[1:03:54] chick-fil-a and starbucks and mcdonald's
[1:03:56] drive through get what you want chicken
[1:03:58] mcnugget what do you what would you like
[1:04:00] oh dad listen oh we got a vintay this
[1:04:03] that oh no
[1:04:06] oh they didn't make it right they didn't
[1:04:08] we want everything fast we want it right
[1:04:10] now we want it is that right
[1:04:12] we can get that way spiritually
[1:04:15] god's not a fast food drive through god
[1:04:19] many times years ago
[1:04:22] heart surgery would take i was wondering
[1:04:24] how long it would take
[1:04:26] for hope and heart surgery
[1:04:29] it's caused by
[1:04:31] cardiac complications and coronary
[1:04:33] arteries and bypasses and
[1:04:36] the diseases of the heart rheumatic do
[1:04:38] you know that the average
[1:04:42] time for a coronary artery bypass is
[1:04:44] three to six hours
[1:04:48] you're sitting in the
[1:04:49] waiting room you're
[1:04:51] got your cell phone out how's mom doing

[1:05:12] through

[1:05:32] being open and
[1:05:34] it might not take 20 minutes it might
[1:05:36] not take 30 minutes it's a heart surgery
[1:05:39] it's more serious
[1:05:41] than just a few little stitches
[1:05:43] fell off the monkey bars or
[1:05:46] whatever a heart surgery has to do
[1:05:49] with a heart and it takes time
[1:05:51] to recover from a heart surgery back to
[1:05:54] work brother john i got to make a living
[1:05:56] well if you don't get this surgery

[1:06:22] covet can't take me an accident can't a
[1:06:24] bomb dropping on phoenix can't take me
[1:06:27] unless god's done with you
[1:06:29] if god's done with you then we ought to
[1:06:31] be happy to leave

[1:06:55] something could happen and
[1:06:58] we just need to make it right with the
[1:06:59] lord and know that one breath here
[1:07:02] i was just with sister karen pruitt a
[1:07:04] week before she passed away and
[1:07:06] then we went the next week with my wife
[1:07:08] to her service
[1:07:10] it can happen like that where you can
[1:07:13] literally be breathing
[1:07:16] in her case she was breathing
[1:07:18] on wednesday morning and by saturday
[1:07:21] they're laying her into the ground
[1:07:25] just a few days normally it might be one
[1:07:27] week you're breathing you're walking and
[1:07:30] within a week you're buried in the
[1:07:32] ground
[1:07:33] that's really life that's your heart
[1:07:35] how's your heart tonight
[1:07:38] we want it fast we want it quick we want
[1:07:40] a quick fix we want to take a pill and
[1:07:43] get out of here well
[1:07:45] sometimes god has to work with some
[1:07:46] layers and pull back the things and we
[1:07:49] need specialists and we need god to say
[1:07:51] things
[1:07:52] in a certain way
[1:07:56] brokenheartedness
[1:07:59] we've witnessed it a lot in the message
[1:08:01] from what people have seen and what
[1:08:02] they've gone through their heart gets
[1:08:04] broken they get crushed they don't have
[1:08:06] that get up and go well come on brother
[1:08:08] come on sister let's get it and they
[1:08:10] just don't have it they just
[1:08:12] they're broken they're crushed but the
[1:08:15] great physician is very near
[1:08:18] you're the generation whose hearts are
[1:08:21] going to be turned back he's going to do
[1:08:22] a change for you
[1:08:26] so before we close tonight someone might
[1:08:28] have been having the question is there
[1:08:30] any hope for me brother john i want to
[1:08:32] say there is hope for you
[1:08:36] is it all over for me my life
[1:08:39] no it's not over yet
[1:08:42] god has a plan for you
[1:08:44] this service has been pre-planned
[1:08:46] brother aaron going on a holiday
[1:08:48] vacation was pre-planned and he knew
[1:08:50] we'd be together for a few days
[1:08:53] let's make the most of it let's give
[1:08:55] testimonies let's encourage one another
[1:08:58] maybe monday i'll be gone back to my
[1:09:00] issues and matters and decisions you
[1:09:02] don't want my decisions
[1:09:05] but i don't want many of your lives and
[1:09:06] what you've had to go through i really
[1:09:08] admire you for your stand for christ
[1:09:12] but god can give us a new heart a new
[1:09:14] attitude a new way of looking at it
[1:09:17] brother branham walked up into sabine
[1:09:19] canyon with questions and he was and he
[1:09:21] had an experience of the sword coming
[1:09:23] down how many know that i was just there
[1:09:26] a few days ago in in that area but then
[1:09:28] he had to walk down off the mountain
[1:09:31] get in his car and drive back to his
[1:09:34] family
[1:09:36] we can't live on the mountain
[1:09:40] you've got to go back to your life
[1:09:42] and your life is every day rugged living
[1:09:44] for christ
[1:09:45] so lord give us a new heart give me a
[1:09:48] new spirit
[1:09:49] and even when i'm young god can take a
[1:09:51] murmuring heart when i'm middle aged and
[1:09:53] there's another more heart
[1:09:55] issues and things it's just like baggage
[1:09:57] it collects it collects it collects
[1:10:01] huh i'm sure you that are older know
[1:10:02] that it is you've seen a lot of things
[1:10:05] just
[1:10:06] but we need to just offload that in the

[1:19:35] of a man's hand but oh it's an abundance
[1:19:37] of rain it's flooding the rivers it's
[1:19:40] flooding the roads it's
[1:19:42] oh god send a spiritual reign to this
[1:19:45] assembly
[1:19:48] let us learn to run in the rain again
[1:19:51] instead of just running to our cars and
[1:19:54] little children they love to run in the
[1:19:56] puddles and as parents we
[1:19:58] can't you walk around you're getting
[1:20:00] your clothes
[1:20:01] wet you're getting your shoes muddy and
[1:20:03] they just want to run and run in the
[1:20:05] puddles and run and sometimes as adults
[1:20:07] we just need to learn to run in the rain
[1:20:09] again and
[1:20:11] leap for joy and learn to cry and say oh
[1:20:14] god
[1:20:15] let our hearts lord jesus be squeezed in
[1:20:18] your presence
[1:20:20] i believe the lord's done a work tonight
[1:20:23] thank you jesus let's all stand to our
[1:20:25] feet and begin to thank the lord and
[1:20:27] just begin to worship him right there
[1:20:29] where you're at
