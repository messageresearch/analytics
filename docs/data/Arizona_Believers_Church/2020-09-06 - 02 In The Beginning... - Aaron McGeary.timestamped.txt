[3:18] we're glad to see each one of you that's
[3:19] come out there's
[3:20] many that traveled to be here from a
[3:22] long ways that have
[3:23] uh meant a lot to us in our lives
[3:25] through the years and it's nice to see
[3:27] them here
[3:27] uh to be here for this service that we
[3:29] have today and
[3:30] we welcome you there's not a lot to say
[3:32] other than we just we love the lord we
[3:34] believe that he's with his people
[3:36] and it's a great privilege to be able to
[3:37] gather together today around the words
[3:39] if you could just turn in your bibles to
[3:40] genesis chapter one
[3:42] we appreciate the musicians stepping in
[3:48] genesis chapter 1 we're going to read
[3:50] verses 1 to 5.
[4:06] there's perhaps a lot in my heart
[4:08] personally i'd like to share with you
[4:09] uh but we it's evident that god has
[4:13] called us here
[4:14] and we feel led just to to begin a work
[4:17] that would rally around the word of the
[4:18] lord and the lord would just add those
[4:20] that he would see fit so we just thank
[4:21] you showing your support today and being
[4:23] here
[4:23] but i really desire just that the word
[4:25] would have preeminence and so we're just
[4:27] going to turn directly to the word
[4:28] in genesis chapter 1 verses 1 to 5 it
[4:31] says in the beginning god created the
[4:33] heaven
[4:34] and the earth and the earth was without
[4:36] form and void
[4:38] and darkness was upon the face of the
[4:39] deep and the spirit of god moved
[4:42] upon the face of the waters and god said
[4:45] let there be light
[4:46] and there was light and god saw the
[4:48] light that it was good
[4:49] and god divided the light from the
[4:51] darkness and god called the light
[4:53] day and the darkness he called night and
[4:56] the evening
[4:57] and the morning were the first day
[5:00] amen you may be seated
[5:04] we had we had held the service back at
[5:06] the end of july
[5:08] and we had ministered on the subject in
[5:10] the beginning and
[5:11] lord's impressed this subject on my
[5:13] heart to continue in
[5:15] and i'd like to maybe just recap just a
[5:17] few things that we had looked at the
[5:18] last time and go further in this subject
[5:21] but we're drawing it from genesis
[5:22] chapter 1 verse 1 where it says in the
[5:24] beginning
[5:25] god created the heaven and the earth and
[5:28] it starts with that phrase of beresheth
[5:30] in the beginning it's a time when
[5:33] something begins
[5:34] and the way that i've been looking at it
[5:36] is the time when god begins to
[5:38] tell a story and he's telling the story
[5:40] of himself he's telling a story of
[5:42] redemption
[5:42] and god has to start somewhere to begin
[5:46] to express something and god be an
[5:47] eternal one without beginning or without
[5:49] end
[5:50] he had to start something in order to
[5:52] tell his story or to express himself
[5:54] it says in the beginning god that's
[5:56] elohim l which is strong one
[5:58] and allah which means bound by an oath
[6:01] or to swear
[6:02] and so it's elohim the strong one bound
[6:04] by an oath
[6:05] and it paints the picture that this is
[6:07] the covenant god
[6:09] this is not just a deity this is not the
[6:11] figment of someone's imagination this
[6:13] isn't just somebody
[6:14] conjuring up an image that they would
[6:16] worship but this is the eternal one
[6:18] a strong one who's bound by an oath it
[6:21] comes from the word to swear
[6:22] and so it's the covenant god a god who's
[6:24] made a promise
[6:26] and he had something that he wanted to
[6:28] express
[6:29] and so god from the very moment that he
[6:31] begins to create he's expressing
[6:33] something
[6:34] but he's actually hiding the ultimate
[6:36] expression in his creation
[6:39] and it's then in genesis chapter 2 it's
[6:41] not just elohim
[6:43] but it's lord god jehovah elohim
[6:46] and jehovah speaks of the self-existent
[6:48] one
[6:49] it comes from adana here which comes
[6:51] from the word havah
[6:52] which means to become so it's jehovah
[6:54] elohim he's the becoming god he's one
[6:56] that
[6:57] exists or become becomes known so he was
[7:00] eternal but because no one else was
[7:02] he wasn't known he was only known to
[7:05] himself but his
[7:06] nature was jehovah god as he began to
[7:09] be create he was no longer just elohim
[7:12] now he's jehovah elohim
[7:13] because he's the becoming god a god that
[7:15] wants to unveil himself or be made known
[7:19] and in ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11
[7:23] he says he hath made everything
[7:24] beautiful in his time
[7:26] also he has set the world in their heart
[7:30] so that no man can find out the work
[7:33] that god maketh
[7:34] from the beginning to the end so he has
[7:37] set something in the heart of man
[7:39] and the image that's created when he
[7:40] says this that he has
[7:42] he's made everything beautiful in his
[7:44] time but he set the world in their heart
[7:46] so that no man can figure out what he's
[7:48] doing from the beginning to the end
[7:50] but it's something that you can only
[7:51] grasp from an eternal perspective
[7:54] he's hid it in the heart to where only
[7:56] by his quickening only by his revealing
[7:58] can you really understand the work of
[8:00] god from the beginning to the end
[8:02] and what i want to emphasize today is
[8:05] that he has hidden
[8:07] a meaning in his creation that as he
[8:10] creates he's
[8:10] showing something he's portraying
[8:12] something he's hiding something
[8:14] and he gives us a window into his heart
[8:16] or into his mind
[8:17] to catch he can by revelation and we
[8:20] look at creation by revelation
[8:21] we can begin to catch oh this is what
[8:23] god is doing
[8:24] and we realize that where we sit now we
[8:27] have the benefit if we say hindsight's
[8:29] 20 20.
[8:30] and with the way 2020 is unfolded 2020
[8:32] vision doesn't sound good anymore
[8:34] some of us would pay a lot of money to
[8:36] have 20 20 vision but now we're like oh
[8:37] 2020 is a just causes us to flinch a
[8:40] little bit
[8:41] but in looking back and we often have
[8:42] the phrase hindsight is 20 20. it means
[8:45] looking back you see things better
[8:47] you see things more clearly so we do
[8:49] have the benefit
[8:50] of looking back and seeing what god is
[8:52] doing and have an understanding
[8:54] and the scripture says in romans chapter
[8:56] 15 verse 4
[8:58] for whatsoever things are written
[9:00] aforetime
[9:01] were written for our learning now we
[9:04] we have to take this very very personal
[9:06] for ourselves today
[9:08] that the things that were written in the
[9:09] bible and even the testimony of the
[9:12] saints to the
[9:13] new testament church and through the
[9:14] church ages have been recorded for our
[9:17] learning
[9:18] it's there for our benefit and so we can
[9:20] look back and see
[9:22] everything that god has achieved from
[9:23] the moment that he began to create
[9:25] to the time where we are now and we know
[9:27] it's for a specific purpose and god has
[9:29] a specific goal
[9:30] but these things that are written in the
[9:32] scripture are written afore time for our
[9:34] learning
[9:35] that we through patience and comfort of
[9:37] the scriptures
[9:38] might have hope and as i pondered that
[9:41] this past week
[9:42] these things are written for our
[9:44] learning and that through the
[9:46] patience and comfort of the very things
[9:48] that were written we might have hope
[9:50] so as i pondered i thought what does god
[9:52] want us to learn
[9:53] from in the beginning that if we're to
[9:56] learn from scripture and we've been
[9:57] taught that you
[9:58] have to see jesus christ in every
[10:00] scripture and the bible's saying that
[10:02] the scriptures were written for our
[10:04] patience and our comfort that we might
[10:06] learn from them written for our learning
[10:08] that we might have hope so what is it
[10:10] that god wants us to learn
[10:11] from genesis chapter one verse one what
[10:14] in this would actually begin to give us
[10:16] hope as we read this
[10:18] and as we look at it we think in the
[10:20] beginning genesis 1 1 we'll
[10:22] just read kind of through a little bit
[10:23] our text here in the beginning god
[10:25] created the heaven and the earth so we
[10:28] we have this understand this is the
[10:29] eternal one this is a perfect one
[10:31] there's no darkness in him there's no
[10:33] shadow of turning
[10:34] and and god creates something we think
[10:36] here's the perfect god
[10:37] creating a perfect creation but then
[10:40] then the very next statement in verse
[10:43] 2 is and so god is joining this perfect
[10:46] creation which we just assume if god
[10:48] creates it
[10:49] and it comes from it would be perfect
[10:51] and so as we behold what's a perfect
[10:53] picture
[10:54] god inserts something very profound at
[10:56] the very beginning
[10:57] and he says and the earth was without
[10:59] form
[11:00] and void and darkness was upon the face
[11:03] of the deep
[11:04] so this without form and void it means
[11:07] there was chaos
[11:08] god had created the heaven and the earth
[11:10] but now the earth is in a chaotic form
[11:12] it's confusion
[11:13] there's actually to say that it's void
[11:14] it's emptiness it would seem to be
[11:17] vanity there seemed to be no purpose to
[11:19] it so
[11:19] had we had the benefit of looking back
[11:21] and seeing something and say
[11:22] see this fluid mass darkness is upon the
[11:25] face of the deep there's no discernible
[11:26] land mass
[11:27] it's just a massive fluid and it's all
[11:29] chaotic and we would look at that and
[11:31] we'd say what do you see here say we
[11:33] don't see anything
[11:34] we see no purpose in this we see no
[11:36] design to it we don't understand even
[11:38] what what good this would be and so
[11:40] there would be a part of us perhaps
[11:42] in looking at it that would say well
[11:43] this is such a this is a worthless thing
[11:46] but god is wanting to express something
[11:48] to us in this
[11:50] because then it says and the spirit of
[11:51] god moved upon the face of the waters
[11:54] and god said let there be light and
[11:56] there was light and god saw the light
[11:58] that it was good so god
[11:59] spoke the spirit of god began to move
[12:01] upon the face of the waters
[12:03] and as the spirit moves there's the
[12:04] voice that speaks
[12:06] because it's the voice of god that
[12:07] declares the presence of god
[12:09] tells us in the book of genesis that the
[12:11] voice of god was walking in the garden
[12:13] of eden
[12:14] it didn't have to be an animate man even
[12:16] a man in flesh but god's voice declares
[12:18] his presence
[12:19] there's a revelation there's a
[12:20] quickening to the voice of god that
[12:22] declares his presence
[12:23] and so god began the spirit of god begin
[12:25] to move upon the face of the waters
[12:27] and there's a word that spoke and let
[12:29] there be light and light comes forth and
[12:31] then god divides the light from the
[12:32] darkness
[12:33] and he calls the light day and the
[12:34] darkness night and he says this is the
[12:36] first
[12:37] day and what we see is that the word
[12:40] changed these
[12:40] dead chaotic elements the word where
[12:43] there was chaos there was void there was
[12:44] confusion there was emptiness
[12:46] the word spoken takes these things that
[12:48] seem to have no discernible purpose and
[12:51] no discernible
[12:52] use and it's void it's empty and all the
[12:54] adjectives that we could bring out from
[12:55] the original hebrew
[12:57] and the spirit of god and the voice of
[12:58] god began to arrange it
[13:00] and then begin to quicken it and as he
[13:02] began to quicken it
[13:04] this became the foundation of a perfect
[13:06] eden
[13:07] so the beginning of the perfect eden god
[13:10] wants
[13:10] us to catch and realize that at first it
[13:12] looked empty
[13:14] at first it looked void at first it
[13:16] looked like it was darkness and chaos
[13:17] and confusion
[13:18] and that it would that how could there
[13:21] be any good in this but then the word of
[13:23] god begins to move upon it
[13:25] brings order and then upon what used to
[13:27] be chaotic
[13:28] what used to be empty god brought an
[13:30] eden of holiness and eden of perfection
[13:33] and so what he wants us to recognize is
[13:36] even our own personal chaos
[13:38] even our own feeling of unworth and all
[13:40] the mistakes we've made all the darkness
[13:42] in our life and all the
[13:43] chaos and emptiness and void and all the
[13:45] vanity does not hinder god that if you
[13:48] feel
[13:48] empty you feel void you look back on
[13:50] your life and say even to this day at 42
[13:52] years old it all just seems like one big
[13:54] gigantic mess up in a gigantic mass the
[13:57] spirit of god can move upon
[13:59] any life and the voice of god begin to
[14:02] speak and it brings order and will
[14:04] arrange things and bring another eden in
[14:06] your life
[14:07] and that's what god wants us to catch in
[14:09] this very image that we see at the
[14:11] beginning
[14:12] in the beginning god created the heaven
[14:14] and the earth but then the earth it
[14:16] represents something
[14:17] and the very first thing we can begin to
[14:19] identify with is that the earth was in
[14:20] chaos
[14:21] the earth had darkness in it it was
[14:25] upside down it was disorganized it had
[14:27] no direction
[14:28] but the spirit of god moved upon it and
[14:31] paul in writing in ephesians chapter 2
[14:33] verses 1 to 7
[14:34] he says and you hath he quickened who
[14:37] were dead in trespasses and sins
[14:39] it's the same thing that god did to the
[14:41] earth he now does to the individual
[14:43] you were dead in sins and trespasses but
[14:45] now he's quickened you and then he
[14:47] describes it this way
[14:48] where in time past you walk according to
[14:51] the course of this world
[14:53] we could even see it in the beginning
[14:54] that the course of this world even
[14:56] before there was flesh upon it
[14:57] it was chaotic it was dark it was
[14:59] confusing he says according to the
[15:01] prince of the power of the heir the
[15:02] spirit that now worketh
[15:04] in the children of disobedience among
[15:06] whom also we all had our conversation
[15:08] and times past
[15:09] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[15:11] desires of the flesh and of the mind
[15:13] and we're by nature the children of
[15:15] wrath even as others
[15:17] you know there's no one that could read
[15:18] this and say not me
[15:20] it doesn't matter if you gave your heart
[15:22] to god at 12 years old and refilled the
[15:23] holy ghost at that very moment there's
[15:25] nobody that can say well i'm exempt from
[15:26] that
[15:27] this is one of those scriptures that we
[15:29] could say applies to every man born of a
[15:31] woman
[15:32] that we all walked in this manner we all
[15:34] had this lane in our flesh he says
[15:36] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[15:40] great love wherewith he loved us even
[15:42] when we were
[15:43] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[15:45] with christ
[15:46] by grace you are saved and hath raised
[15:49] us up together
[15:50] and made us sit together in heavenly
[15:52] places in christ
[15:54] jesus so now we who were dead in sins
[15:57] walking according to the course of this
[15:59] world and this fallen condition
[16:01] there's a quickening and now he says
[16:02] we're seated in heavenly places
[16:04] right now seated in heavenly places in
[16:06] christ jesus he says that in the ages to
[16:08] come the time we're even living in right
[16:10] now he might
[16:11] show the exceeding riches of his grace
[16:13] in his kindness towards us
[16:15] through christ jesus oh my that's
[16:17] beautiful
[16:18] so we can see in genesis chapter 1
[16:21] verses
[16:22] verse 2 through 5 we can see ourselves
[16:24] in that
[16:25] and i believe that god wants us to
[16:27] identify with that
[16:28] it's okay to recognize your humanity and
[16:30] your weakness and it's okay to realize
[16:32] that you make mistakes because those
[16:35] things those
[16:36] things come with the fleshly part and
[16:38] it's when we try to use the fleshly part
[16:40] to prop up the fleshly part that we just
[16:42] are worse off pride is a nasty thing
[16:45] it'll cause you to sin but the worst
[16:48] part about pride is it keeps you in
[16:50] sin because it holds you there making
[16:52] excuses
[16:53] and we can just by humans today say yes
[16:55] we make mistakes we don't have it all
[16:57] figured out we don't have all the
[16:58] answers
[16:58] and i'll tell you right now even as as
[17:00] the minister today i don't know
[17:02] the answer to every question but i know
[17:05] one who does
[17:06] i know i have an answer to the devil's
[17:08] question but all the questions that we
[17:10] might be able to conjure up and all the
[17:11] things that we might be able to ask
[17:13] we don't know all the answers to the
[17:14] question but we know of christ who is
[17:16] the answer and so it's important for us
[17:19] to recognize
[17:20] even in this first part just through
[17:21] humility say i recognize with genesis
[17:23] chapter 1 verse 2
[17:24] but then to avail ourselves to the
[17:26] spirit of god to yield ourselves
[17:28] to the voice of god to bring order where
[17:30] there was once chaos
[17:34] and i want to just focus on genesis
[17:36] chapter 1 verse 1 today
[17:38] and this is our first time meeting in
[17:40] this facility and if it's
[17:42] if it's warm to you i apologize it just
[17:44] reminds you that it's warmer outside
[17:47] and i was joking around in north
[17:48] carolina that we were moving to escape
[17:50] the heat
[17:50] because it's just so humid uh but it uh
[17:54] it's still hot still very hot
[17:57] and we're looking forward to that day
[17:59] here
[18:00] uh i believe that in the meeting in the
[18:02] air it'll just be right you know
[18:04] whatever you like it at it'll just be
[18:05] right whenever we come back in the
[18:07] millennium it'll just be right
[18:08] if you like it at 112 i believe you'll
[18:10] just feel it that way
[18:12] they say that in the wilderness that the
[18:13] word manno means what is it
[18:15] and that according to some jewish
[18:17] historians that the way that the
[18:18] tradition was passed down orally is that
[18:21] the manna tasted like whatever you
[18:22] wanted to taste
[18:23] whatever is pleasant to you whatever
[18:25] whatever tasted good so
[18:27] if we have man in the millennium it
[18:28] might taste a lot like rito's to me
[18:31] and so whatever temperature you want it
[18:33] to be at perhaps that's how you'll feel
[18:34] in the ages to come but in genesis
[18:37] chapter one verse one and i
[18:38] what i was thinking when i said that is
[18:40] just be patient with all the little
[18:41] things the sound doesn't work there's an
[18:43] echo it's hot in here
[18:44] let's just remember we're gathered
[18:45] around one thing that's the word
[18:47] not a building not a name not a
[18:49] personality we're just gathered around
[18:50] to hear the word
[18:51] because our little time here it's we're
[18:53] not living to go to church
[18:55] we go to church to live so we're
[18:57] gathering here today just to receive
[18:58] substance from the word of god not that
[19:00] we would leave here and just think in
[19:02] our minds well
[19:02] i got to live right so i can make it
[19:04] back to church again no we want to get
[19:06] something at church to live
[19:07] it's got to make a difference on a
[19:08] sunday evening and a monday morning and
[19:10] that's what we come to receive and if we
[19:12] are
[19:12] a little bit uncomfortable and things
[19:13] aren't just exactly right dear church
[19:15] just as long as we're getting something
[19:17] we can live by that's what matters
[19:19] in genesis chapter 1 1 i want to look at
[19:21] this in great detail
[19:23] and we just used that little bit of a
[19:24] foundation to recapture what was
[19:26] administered earlier this summer in the
[19:28] beginning
[19:29] god as we've looked at that at the
[19:30] beginning in god it says now he created
[19:33] and what he created was heaven and earth
[19:36] and in the hebrews beresheth borrow
[19:38] elohim
[19:39] in the beginning god in the beginning
[19:42] beresheth bara
[19:43] elohim in the beginning god created and
[19:45] what he did is he created
[19:46] the heaven and the earth some
[19:48] translations render it god
[19:50] in the beginning created the heavens and
[19:52] the earth so it places god at the
[19:54] beginning god in the beginning
[19:55] created the heaven and the earth and
[19:57] this word borah and the hebrew created
[19:59] it means to cause existence
[20:02] where previously to that moment there
[20:04] was nothing that existed
[20:06] so there hadn't been nothing no material
[20:08] nothing else existing god was the
[20:10] invisible god
[20:11] who existed in the realm all by himself
[20:13] but now it says in the beginning god
[20:15] created
[20:16] to create it means to bring something
[20:18] forth that had not previously had any
[20:20] being
[20:20] had not previously had any existence any
[20:23] physical existence
[20:24] and one translation says god in the
[20:26] beginning created
[20:27] substance of the heaven and the
[20:30] substance of the earth
[20:32] and and that really struck me that god
[20:33] in the beginning created something
[20:35] that became the substance of what the
[20:37] heavens became
[20:38] and what the earth became and so he
[20:40] brought into existence the first
[20:42] elements from which heaven
[20:44] and earth were later formed and we could
[20:46] see this very thing we could see this
[20:48] uh maybe these two layers to this
[20:50] scripture that god brought forth the
[20:52] substance from which creation came or
[20:54] from which he
[20:55] formed creation because the bible says
[20:57] in john chapter one
[20:58] in the beginning was the word and we
[21:01] know it's
[21:02] the word that begin to create john
[21:03] chapter one verses one to three
[21:05] in the beginning was the word and the
[21:07] word was with god
[21:08] and the word was god the same was in the
[21:11] beginning with god
[21:12] all things were made by him and without
[21:15] him was not anything made
[21:17] that was made so there was there was a
[21:20] form of being that god the invisible god
[21:22] formed himself into the logos
[21:25] and then from this body this theophany
[21:27] he began to create
[21:29] and in the beginning he brought forth
[21:30] substance that became the heavens
[21:32] he brought forth substance that became
[21:34] the earth
[21:35] in hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 through
[21:37] faith we understand that the worlds were
[21:39] framed
[21:40] by the word of god so that the things
[21:42] that are seen were not made of things
[21:44] which do appear so by faith we
[21:47] understand that the worlds were framed
[21:49] by the word of god because in the
[21:52] beginning was
[21:53] the word and the word was with god and
[21:55] the word was god and all things were
[21:56] made
[21:57] by the word and proceeded forth from the
[21:59] word
[22:00] and so in the beginning god created
[22:02] brought forth substance that began to
[22:04] bring forth the heaven and the earth and
[22:07] i want to look at these two elements
[22:09] the heaven and the earth and this has
[22:11] just been burning on my heart
[22:12] for some time and i'm so grateful to
[22:14] have the privilege of
[22:16] sharing it with you today he made the
[22:18] heaven
[22:19] and the the heaven the first heaven that
[22:21] god made was the very habitation of
[22:23] elohim
[22:24] that god who is the invisible god he
[22:26] dwelt we could say in a dimension that
[22:28] was his alone
[22:29] it really was the only thing that was
[22:31] and it was just god
[22:33] if we were to imagine me uh being alone
[22:36] in this room today or
[22:37] me being alone or existing by myself you
[22:39] would try to imagine me within some
[22:41] space
[22:42] and you say well brother aaron's at home
[22:43] alone and so you would picture some
[22:45] dimension and space and
[22:47] there would be all these different
[22:48] elements that we begin to comprehend
[22:50] what makes someone alone but god
[22:52] wasn't alone in that there was space and
[22:54] there was other room for others
[22:56] he was alone and that that was all there
[22:58] was god was
[22:59] the only space god was the only being
[23:02] and he just existed all by himself
[23:04] so when he formed himself into the word
[23:06] of the logos
[23:07] he had he brings forth the heaven that
[23:09] he that there's a dimension now of
[23:11] heaven
[23:11] that becomes the habitation of elohim
[23:14] the heavens of heavens the
[23:15] highest order and we see these
[23:17] dimensions
[23:18] and it's also referred to as the
[23:20] tabernacle of god
[23:22] and so the heaven i want to just put
[23:23] this image before you today
[23:25] the heaven represents the supernatural
[23:28] and when we speak of heaven god is
[23:29] identified with heaven
[23:31] jesus said my father which is in heaven
[23:33] and he referred to the father which is
[23:34] in heaven
[23:35] we think of heaven as being a dimension
[23:36] of glory a dimension of the supernatural
[23:39] a dimension of the divine and it's it's
[23:41] appropriate to begin to think that way
[23:43] god created the heaven
[23:44] it's a dimension that's associated with
[23:46] him and if you take it just
[23:48] another step down and ponder how the
[23:51] stars and the galaxies in the universe
[23:53] are also declared as the heavens god
[23:55] identified himself with the heavens
[23:57] and wrote his first bible in the stars
[24:00] so the stars and the galaxies and all
[24:02] the things that are up there
[24:04] and even this other supernatural part
[24:06] that we're pointing to
[24:07] it's it's it's symbolized and represents
[24:09] the the habitation of god the dwelling
[24:11] place of god
[24:13] so the stars and the galaxies the whole
[24:14] universe can also be
[24:16] signified into heaven so you have the
[24:18] heaven that's created then you can see
[24:19] that this is the habitation of god god
[24:22] writes his first bible there
[24:23] it's the first place that god is being
[24:25] expressed you can see it even be
[24:27] expressed in the sun in different ways
[24:28] that you could draw this out
[24:30] in all the different constellations god
[24:32] is expressing himself
[24:34] in the heavenlies but remember that it's
[24:37] the
[24:37] tabernacle of god it's the dwelling
[24:39] place of god the heaven is
[24:41] then he says god created not just the
[24:43] heaven
[24:44] but he also created the earth and when
[24:47] he creates the earth this is
[24:48] the land as opposed to heaven and it's
[24:52] interesting to note that from the moment
[24:53] that god says god created the heaven
[24:55] and he says and the earth from this
[24:58] point on the narrative
[25:00] only relates to the earth we're not told
[25:03] a story in another galaxy
[25:06] everything that takes place is take
[25:07] place within relation to the earth even
[25:09] if you bring up the image
[25:11] of of satan coming before the lord in
[25:14] the book of job and you see some sort of
[25:16] heavenly scene
[25:17] nothing that's being expressed doesn't
[25:19] have some connection with what's taking
[25:20] place on earth
[25:21] so the narrative from this moment on
[25:23] even in creation
[25:25] in the rest of the book of genesis
[25:26] what's being expressed is everything
[25:28] that relates to where we are now
[25:30] the natural things that we see and all
[25:32] the senses that we use to contact
[25:34] this earth so now what he brings forth
[25:36] is that there's a heaven
[25:37] and now there is an earth and god
[25:41] intended
[25:43] something glorious to be declared in
[25:45] this verse
[25:46] very simple verse and i'm sure all of us
[25:48] should have it memorized if you need a
[25:49] bible memory verse let's just all
[25:51] remember genesis 1 1 this week
[25:53] in the beginning god created the heaven
[25:55] and the earth that's i think that's
[25:56] simple enough for all of us
[25:58] but god is decl is intending something
[26:01] glorious by this verse
[26:03] and if you could for a moment just maybe
[26:05] humor me i was just sitting back
[26:07] thinking about it this past week
[26:09] this bible is god in written form the
[26:12] stars is the first bible that god wrote
[26:14] then god
[26:15] has preserved himself in a written bible
[26:17] so think of how
[26:18] tremendous and important the very first
[26:21] words of the bible would be
[26:24] god the way god starts is the way god
[26:25] finishes god's got to start a particular
[26:28] way he begins a particular way
[26:30] and so think of how important genesis 1
[26:32] 1 must be
[26:33] because it sets in motion the unfolding
[26:35] of god and i believe that when god said
[26:38] in the beginning
[26:38] god created the heaven and the earth he
[26:41] wrapped up
[26:42] so much truth in this one statement that
[26:44] the
[26:45] further revelation of it can get so deep
[26:47] and so deep
[26:48] that it'll draw you away from carnal
[26:50] things it'll cause you to see things
[26:52] from a completely different perspective
[26:54] because god in one verse has articulated
[26:56] his great plan
[26:58] he sets it all in motion here and he
[27:00] lays it out before us that in this
[27:02] creation
[27:02] this is the first creation that it's
[27:04] expressed god in the beginning created
[27:07] the heaven and the earth and this is how
[27:09] important this scripture is and i want
[27:11] to use a few statements from brother
[27:12] branham
[27:13] to show how we can look at this and
[27:15] understand that this
[27:16] is significant because it's god showing
[27:19] something
[27:20] he makes this statement the resurrection
[27:22] can be proved by looking at the creator
[27:24] how that he created all this botany life
[27:26] and how everything serving his purpose
[27:28] must die
[27:28] and if it dies it lives again because
[27:30] it's got perpetual life
[27:32] but the only way it can live again is a
[27:34] germatized seed
[27:36] so he's saying that we can look at the
[27:37] natural course of flowers and plants and
[27:40] see dying and coming back up again and
[27:42] we can see that even the creation
[27:45] expresses resurrection and it's proved
[27:48] by looking at how the creator put these
[27:50] symbols
[27:51] in creation or in natural life in botany
[27:53] life and we can see this type natural
[27:55] declaring the spiritual
[27:57] he says this though now god expresses
[27:59] himself
[28:00] in that creation and it shows that all
[28:02] these pagan gods and things that we
[28:04] that we have are not right they're just
[28:06] philosophy imaginations
[28:08] but the one who created the heaven and
[28:10] earth
[28:11] expresses himself back through his
[28:13] creation
[28:14] and what he is in his program
[28:18] now we should take this as commentary on
[28:20] genesis 1 1
[28:22] that the very one who created in the
[28:23] heaven the earth
[28:25] expresses himself back through that
[28:27] creation so that we can see what he is
[28:30] and his program so in genesis 1 1 god
[28:33] expresses himself
[28:34] and his program seems very simple in the
[28:36] beginning god created the heaven and
[28:38] earth and some say well to me that means
[28:39] that god
[28:40] had the ability to create and he created
[28:42] a universe and an earth within that
[28:44] universe that's kind of like a sandbox
[28:46] and now he's the
[28:46] he's a god that set everything in motion
[28:48] so he just now sits back with his
[28:50] arms folded kind of seeing how things
[28:52] will play out but yet
[28:53] god expresses something greater in that
[28:56] verse than just a man creating a sandbox
[28:59] god expresses himself in that creation
[29:03] the one who created the heaven and the
[29:05] earth expresses himself
[29:06] back through that creation and the
[29:09] message letting off the pressure he says
[29:11] we know
[29:12] that this world is a creation and before
[29:14] there can be a creation there has to be
[29:15] a creator
[29:16] of that creation and this creator
[29:19] expresses himself
[29:21] in the creation hold that thought in
[29:23] your mind
[29:24] it says in the beginning god the creator
[29:27] created the heaven and the earth so god
[29:30] is the creator the heaven and the earth
[29:32] are his creation
[29:33] and brother brahm is saying god
[29:34] expresses himself in the creation
[29:37] so god has expressed himself in heaven
[29:39] and earth there's an expression of him
[29:41] in this creation
[29:42] if we did not even have a bible we still
[29:44] know that that's the truth just as we do
[29:47] the bible only sets it in order now god
[29:50] created the creation is expressing
[29:53] himself
[29:54] back in the creation so there's there's
[29:57] more depth to it
[29:58] uh there's more meaning to it than just
[30:01] uh you and i
[30:02] taking substance and building something
[30:03] and say well this is my great work this
[30:05] is my great masterpiece
[30:06] we say oh well look at what brother
[30:08] aaron built and all we know he likes
[30:09] this color and we know he likes this
[30:11] design
[30:12] and you try to see myself in that it's
[30:13] very different what god did
[30:16] he continues and he's not a god just of
[30:18] one solid sears and roebuck harmony
[30:20] house
[30:20] he's a god of variety he makes big hills
[30:23] and little hills he makes the deserts
[30:24] and he makes lakes
[30:25] and he makes little trees and big trees
[30:27] and white flowers and red flowers and
[30:29] makes little men and big men
[30:30] and red-headed women and black-headed
[30:32] women and he makes us different because
[30:34] he wants us
[30:34] that way shouldn't that just allow us
[30:37] just to rest in how god has made us
[30:40] he's a god of variety and he makes some
[30:41] rich and some poor
[30:43] some in between but we've got a place to
[30:45] serve god
[30:46] and that's the place that he's placed us
[30:48] in if we'll just abide
[30:50] in that place beautiful words there of
[30:52] encouragement and admonishment just to
[30:54] be who god's made you to be and variety
[30:56] is beautiful to god
[30:58] and so as he says this there's different
[31:01] ways that god expresses himself
[31:03] so it's not a matter of all of us just
[31:04] trying to conform to a particular
[31:06] attitude or particular way
[31:08] but allowing god to express himself
[31:10] through our being
[31:11] but the point that i'm really wanting to
[31:13] draw from this is that god
[31:14] expresses himself in the thing that he
[31:16] creates
[31:17] the one who created the heaven and the
[31:19] earth expresses himself back through the
[31:21] heaven and the earth
[31:22] god creating the creation is expressing
[31:24] himself back
[31:25] in the creation so we read in the
[31:28] beginning god
[31:29] created the heaven and the earth god
[31:31] expresses himself
[31:32] in heaven and earth this is the first
[31:36] expression of god that we're introduced
[31:38] to
[31:39] we could we could we could maybe some
[31:41] would might disagree with this statement
[31:43] but i can personally say for myself
[31:45] i i was not introduced to an image
[31:47] before in the beginning
[31:49] or john 1 in the beginning was the word
[31:51] i had no concept of that
[31:53] until the prophet comes back and begins
[31:54] to describe how this
[31:56] infinite invisible god forms himself
[31:58] into a low gospel
[31:59] and this becomes an expression of god
[32:01] then what we're introduced to in genesis
[32:03] 1 1 in the beginning god
[32:05] elohim the covenant god created the
[32:08] heaven and the earth
[32:09] and so god wants us to catch this
[32:11] expression
[32:13] because what is he foreshadowing in this
[32:15] if he expresses himself
[32:17] in that creation he expresses himself
[32:19] back through his creation
[32:20] god creating the creation is expressing
[32:22] himself back in the creation
[32:24] so that we could see what he is in his
[32:26] program what is he showing us
[32:30] and the word express is brother madam
[32:31] uses this word
[32:33] it's to represent in visual art or to
[32:36] put into words that
[32:37] is just one sense of an expression you
[32:39] have a thought you try to express it
[32:40] in a visual way or put it into words and
[32:42] in that sense we say a word is a thought
[32:44] expressed
[32:45] but the word if you look at the
[32:47] etymology of it means to press
[32:49] or to squeeze out or to speak one's mind
[32:53] so to express something something's
[32:55] being pressed or squeezed out
[32:57] and so it creates this picture if one is
[32:59] expressing something
[33:00] something is being squeezed out and
[33:02] taken out of their mind and put into
[33:04] form
[33:05] and we see this happening it had to be
[33:06] there in god's thoughts in god's heart
[33:08] and in the latin it means to represent
[33:10] to describe
[33:12] to portray to imitate and it literally
[33:15] means
[33:15] to press out and i might be getting a
[33:18] few on my side today even me
[33:20] maybe my brother matthew would just
[33:21] really rally behind this but this word
[33:24] to express in the latin it literally
[33:26] means to press out and it's the source
[33:28] of the word la
[33:28] italian word espresso can i get an amen
[33:32] anybody want to amend me here now i got
[33:35] everybody's attention may god just give
[33:37] the caffeine of that to us now and
[33:39] energize us
[33:40] spiritually claim it but he so it comes
[33:43] from this
[33:44] expression or expressed the english word
[33:46] we use this is what's portrayed in the
[33:48] italian word espresso from x which is
[33:51] out a prasar
[33:52] to pressure to push to press or to push
[33:55] out
[33:56] the the latin root to that means to
[33:58] press to hold fast
[33:59] and it it the word the picture word
[34:02] that's created it's in the sense of how
[34:04] that
[34:04] may be clay under pressure takes the
[34:07] form of an
[34:08] image and that's when you when you
[34:11] espresso and i don't pretend to know how
[34:12] it works and i'm sure there's many that
[34:14] will just correct me on it but there's a
[34:15] pressing that takes place
[34:16] to make the espresso to get the the life
[34:19] out of that being to get the flavor out
[34:21] of the caffeine especially
[34:22] and it does it in such a way to where it
[34:24] presents something that can be enjoyed
[34:26] it's taking the substance of that being
[34:28] and through pressure presses out an
[34:30] expression of it
[34:30] presses out a different image or
[34:32] manifestation of it so this
[34:34] expression that brother madam is using
[34:36] god expresses himself in that creation
[34:38] god has expressed himself
[34:39] back in that creation so we can know
[34:41] what he is in his program
[34:43] there's a sense of something being
[34:45] formed
[34:46] in something being made manifest like
[34:49] you could take a clay and press an image
[34:51] into it
[34:51] and you see something being expressed
[34:53] but god does not create
[34:55] like an artist god does not create like
[34:58] a barista god is not like any one of us
[35:00] at our espresso machine making coffee
[35:02] it's not something that he's created
[35:04] that's a standalone
[35:05] but he wants to become expressed it's
[35:08] something that's becoming tangible it's
[35:10] something that's becoming material
[35:11] and this invisible god when he begins to
[35:13] express it's not
[35:15] just a reflection but it is him
[35:19] it's the becoming god he's not just
[35:21] painting the picture and handing it out
[35:23] or taking a picture and distributing and
[35:24] saying oh this is a reflection of him
[35:26] this is an image of
[35:27] but no this is him this is god making
[35:30] himself known
[35:31] this is god sharing with us so that we
[35:33] through the learn we can learn through
[35:35] the comfort and patience of scripture
[35:37] have hope
[35:41] and so what is created reflects what is
[35:44] in god's mind
[35:46] he says that's what an expression is to
[35:47] press out to squeeze out to speak one's
[35:49] mind
[35:50] so this is it's being squeezed out is
[35:52] being portrayed and what's the first
[35:54] expression we see in genesis 1
[35:56] the first expression in the bible the
[35:57] heaven and the earth
[36:00] and this is what this is where maybe if
[36:03] i was better at this i could save this
[36:04] for the end and just kind of bring it in
[36:06] the way to where it's like ah aha
[36:08] but what he's expressed here in heaven
[36:10] and earth he portrays the heavenly
[36:12] bridegroom
[36:13] and the earthly bride in the very first
[36:16] verse of the bible there's christ and
[36:19] there's you
[36:20] in the beginning god pressed himself
[36:24] out brought for squeezed out of his mind
[36:27] a groom
[36:27] and a bride represented as a heavenly
[36:30] bridegroom
[36:31] and an earthly bride because we know he
[36:34] made the earth
[36:34] to get a bride out of him so they're not
[36:37] expressed
[36:38] as separate conditions or separate
[36:40] creations
[36:41] when they're created he expresses them
[36:43] as being created together
[36:45] and and although we can see in language
[36:48] and maybe in position
[36:50] we might say maybe one was greater than
[36:51] the other one was here and one was there
[36:53] one was higher one was lower but they're
[36:55] coexisting together
[36:57] it doesn't say in the beginning god
[36:58] created the heaven and then
[37:00] and then it takes the earth and it's
[37:02] created uh later on or
[37:04] he he says this is something i'm
[37:05] representing in the very beginning
[37:07] regardless of the condition of it
[37:09] regardless of how much time passes the
[37:11] image i want my believer to see
[37:13] that in the beginning they were just as
[37:15] much in my mind
[37:16] as christ was in my mind that my
[37:18] expression is not complete
[37:20] without heaven and earth though i made
[37:22] known in christ jesus though i was
[37:24] expressed in the sun
[37:26] there's more to that expression there is
[37:28] a wife there's a bride that must come
[37:30] forth so he says i
[37:31] have created heaven and earth together
[37:34] coexisting
[37:38] so they're they're together and brother
[37:39] banham talks about
[37:41] uh and and i want to use this very
[37:42] quickly
[37:45] he says we're so great it's just to see
[37:47] this harmony this is what i was thinking
[37:49] heaven and earth existing and the
[37:50] harmony
[37:51] among between them brahman says we're so
[37:53] glad that we can look up and see the
[37:54] stars in the skies and the moon
[37:56] and the great solar system as it
[37:58] revolves in such perfect
[38:00] harmony and the earth is part of that
[38:03] harmony
[38:04] it's remarkable that a a comet can pass
[38:07] by and scientists could say
[38:08] you won't see that again for 324 years
[38:11] and 12 minutes you're like what really
[38:13] and then if time passes they just can
[38:15] like clock work
[38:16] it's going to come right back around
[38:17] again wow there's a timing there's an
[38:20] order there's a harmony to all these
[38:21] things the earth exists
[38:22] within the solar system and within the
[38:24] heavens it exists
[38:26] in harmony by gravitational pull and
[38:29] it's
[38:30] it's circling around the sun in each one
[38:32] in their places
[38:33] god is showing that there's a harmony
[38:35] that's even existing with the earth
[38:36] within the rest of the greater whole and
[38:39] brother branham uses this thought and
[38:41] greatest battle ever fought and i
[38:42] thought of the order of that heavenly
[38:44] host
[38:44] not one of them is out of place everyone
[38:47] keeps his time
[38:48] perfectly he says god's great army i
[38:51] thought of the soldiers how that if that
[38:52] moon would ever get out of order
[38:54] notice what he says the earth would be
[38:57] covered up with water in just a few
[38:58] minutes
[38:59] so there's something about the
[39:00] heavenlies that keeps order in the
[39:02] earthly
[39:04] and if the heavenly god out of place it
[39:05] would cause chaos upon the earth
[39:08] so there's there's an expression here of
[39:10] harmony and continuity that god wants to
[39:12] see
[39:13] between heaven and earth he said the
[39:15] earth would be just like it was
[39:17] when god decided to use it for us to
[39:20] have us here on it
[39:21] it was without form and void and
[39:23] darkness was upon the face that
[39:25] was upon the breath of the earth and if
[39:27] that moon would ever move
[39:28] it would do the same thing again so god
[39:31] is expressing that there's he intends to
[39:34] have harmony between heaven and earth
[39:36] that if the the heavenly was to get out
[39:38] of order it would cause chaos upon the
[39:40] earth
[39:40] but as long as the earth is in direct in
[39:42] the right relationship with the moon
[39:45] and the moon doesn't move out of
[39:46] position or the earth doesn't move out
[39:48] of position
[39:49] the earth is safe it won't return back
[39:52] to void it won't return back to darkness
[39:54] he says when the moon rocks a little bit
[39:56] away from the earth the tide comes up
[39:57] when it goes down it follows the ties
[39:59] it's god's great army so we could see
[40:02] then that there was a dependency of the
[40:04] earth upon the heavens
[40:06] and in the beginning god is showing his
[40:08] plan of harmony
[40:09] between christ and his bride now let's
[40:12] not look at that arrangement
[40:14] as being three different things or three
[40:15] different entities but really just
[40:17] one expressed in two it's the invisible
[40:20] god expressed in groom
[40:22] the invisible god expressed in bride and
[40:24] so god in the beginning is showing his
[40:26] plan of harmony between christ
[40:28] and his bride now just to take it a step
[40:32] further
[40:34] the bible refers to in the beginning of
[40:36] the creation of god and brother branham
[40:37] identifies that as being jesus christ
[40:41] and in mark chapter one and i want to
[40:43] read it very quickly in
[40:44] three different places so you can see
[40:46] how the emphasis of the gospels
[40:48] trying to expressing this principle
[40:51] because i'm wanting to look at in the
[40:52] beginning god created
[40:53] the heaven and the earth now we identify
[40:56] with the earth none of us were born in
[40:57] heaven
[40:57] show of hands right so we all we all are
[41:00] related very well to this earth to the
[41:02] natural things
[41:03] but yet now god when he's when jesus
[41:06] christ comes notice
[41:07] the language that is used at the baptism
[41:10] on the jordan river mark chapter 1
[41:12] verses 9 to 11.
[41:13] and it came to pass in those days that
[41:15] jesus came from nazareth of galilee
[41:18] and was baptized of john in jordan and
[41:21] straightway coming
[41:22] out up out of the water he saw the
[41:24] heavens opened
[41:26] and the spirit like a dove descended
[41:28] upon him
[41:29] and there came a voice from heaven
[41:31] saying thou
[41:32] art my beloved son in whom i am well
[41:35] pleased
[41:36] and it's not just a father pleased with
[41:39] this son
[41:40] but in whom i am well pleased to dwell
[41:42] in
[41:43] he's not just saying i'm real proud of
[41:45] your son but now he's indwelling
[41:47] the sun there's there's a union that's
[41:49] taking place
[41:51] it's it's written this way matthew
[41:52] chapter 3 verses 16 to 17
[41:55] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[41:57] straightway out of the water
[41:58] and lo the heavens were opened unto him
[42:01] and he saw the spirit of god descending
[42:04] like a dove
[42:05] and lighting upon him and low a voice
[42:07] from heaven saying this is my beloved
[42:09] son
[42:09] and who i am well pleased again the
[42:12] heavens opened
[42:13] the spirit of the lord descending upon
[42:16] him lighting upon him
[42:17] like a dove descending upon him a voice
[42:20] of god identifying himself with this
[42:22] dissension of the spirit
[42:23] it says in john chapter 1 verse 32 and
[42:26] john bear record saying i saw the spirit
[42:28] descending from heaven like a dove and
[42:31] it abode
[42:32] upon him so we see an image of the
[42:35] heavenlies opening up
[42:36] and it coming down to abide on flesh
[42:40] coming down to abide upon jesus christ
[42:42] and it's an indwelling
[42:44] it's it's a it's a the holy spirit
[42:46] coming and identifying himself with the
[42:48] man christ jesus
[42:49] coming coming to unite with him and this
[42:51] is the language that brother branham
[42:53] uses
[42:54] and this is what and again we're reading
[42:56] from genesis chapter 1
[42:57] in the beginning god created the heaven
[42:59] and the earth now at the baptism of
[43:01] jesus christ we see the heavens open up
[43:03] the spirit like a dove descending upon
[43:06] jesus who is now in flesh
[43:08] it's a it's a flesh man he's we could
[43:10] say in one sense he's 100
[43:11] man but yet the blood that was in him
[43:13] was divine it was
[43:15] it was the blood of god it wasn't any
[43:16] other blood so the deity of jesus christ
[43:18] relates to his blood
[43:20] but now at the jordan river something is
[43:22] happening to this cree
[43:24] this creation something's happening to
[43:26] this son who's now
[43:27] flesh and blood who is now walking in
[43:29] flesh who's a young baby that was born
[43:32] in a manger
[43:33] and grows up and we see a glimpse of him
[43:35] at 12 years old and the bible says
[43:36] he increased in wisdom and his stature
[43:38] and in favor with god and man so now
[43:40] this is flesh that is growing just like
[43:42] you and i
[43:43] this isn't flesh like melchizedek where
[43:45] god just creates a body
[43:46] blows himself into it walks it now this
[43:48] is a this is a man this is a man with a
[43:50] with a desire this is a man with
[43:52] passions
[43:52] this is a man who had his own will
[43:55] he said not my will but thy will be done
[43:58] so what happens here on the jordan river
[44:00] has great significance for us
[44:02] because brother bottom uses there's
[44:03] several places we could read from to use
[44:05] this
[44:06] but he says in the message the lamb and
[44:07] the dove when this dove came from the
[44:09] heavens
[44:10] the meekest bird of all the heavens came
[44:12] to the meekest animal and all the earth
[44:15] heaven and earth kissed each other
[44:17] heaven and earth was united together
[44:20] so this is the image now it is baptism
[44:23] heaven and earth are now uniting
[44:25] in the beginning god created the heaven
[44:27] and the earth
[44:28] again in another message called lamb and
[44:30] dove all with a confirmation to see a
[44:32] lamb and dove come together
[44:34] heaven and earth united god and man
[44:37] united he's shown a union now heaven and
[44:41] earth united
[44:41] heaven and earth united says in another
[44:43] place when the dove settled down on the
[44:45] lamb
[44:46] heaven and earth embraced each other and
[44:48] kissed
[44:51] in the beginning god created the heaven
[44:52] and the earth now
[44:54] in in the beginning of the creation of
[44:56] god
[44:57] jesus christ there's a time when heaven
[45:00] and earth are embracing and kissing
[45:03] he says in another message god making
[45:05] his promise that was the greatest event
[45:08] that this world has ever seen and will
[45:10] see
[45:12] when heaven and earth kissed he said it
[45:14] was the greatest event this world
[45:16] ever seen and we'll see until until
[45:19] christ
[45:20] and the church has united together again
[45:24] oh hallelujah i just have to express it
[45:26] now and not save it for the end
[45:28] once again heaven and earth are kissing
[45:31] once again
[45:32] heaven and earth are uniting together
[45:35] so once again it's the greatest event
[45:37] this world has ever seen
[45:40] the greatest event this world has ever
[45:41] seen and we'll see until christ and the
[45:43] church is united together again
[45:45] that is when god and man became one
[45:49] heaven and earth embraced each other and
[45:51] kissed each other and
[45:52] settled the sin question forever is when
[45:55] the dove
[45:56] and the lamb united together
[45:59] says again in one other place he says
[46:01] many people bypass this scripture
[46:04] but to me it's one of the most
[46:05] outstanding it's one of the outstanding
[46:07] scriptures of the bible
[46:08] that when heaven and earth embraced when
[46:11] god came down in the form of a dove and
[46:13] went upon his son
[46:14] in the form of a lamb when god in christ
[46:16] became one when the dove came down on
[46:18] the lamb
[46:19] heaven and earth kissed each other god
[46:22] and man was reconciled together why it's
[46:25] one of the greatest
[46:26] moments in the world ever have that when
[46:28] man and god was reconciled together
[46:31] the dove and the lamb came together
[46:36] heaven and earth kissed one of the
[46:38] greatest greatest moments the world ever
[46:39] had
[46:41] has ever seen or will see until
[46:44] until you see the picture that's being
[46:48] painted
[46:49] in the beginning god created the heaven
[46:51] and earth it's not just
[46:52] it's not just a a rough start to god
[46:54] trying to tell a great story
[46:56] it's almost as if he told the whole
[46:58] story in one verse
[47:01] in the beginning god created the
[47:02] expression of a bridegroom
[47:05] and he created an expression of a bride
[47:08] that would be united
[47:09] and live forever in eternity and we even
[47:12] understand
[47:12] in the beginning god created they have
[47:14] an earth period we don't know how long
[47:16] it got here
[47:17] or how long it was here we don't know
[47:18] how long it existed when people say well
[47:20] this rock's billions and billions of
[47:22] years old
[47:23] i i don't argue with them on that i'm
[47:25] sometimes perplexed by the methods they
[47:26] use and
[47:27] and i don't quite understand the science
[47:29] and you realize it takes there's a level
[47:30] of faith that they have in the process
[47:32] to come to arrive
[47:33] so conclusively at this number no it is
[47:35] exactly 3.2 billion years old well could
[47:38] it be 3.1 oh
[47:39] hold on there buddy you know don't mess
[47:41] with science no it's 3.2
[47:44] very precise very adamant very focused
[47:46] this is what it's supposed to be
[47:48] and so but god is expressing something
[47:51] eternal related to you and i
[47:54] and then genesis 1 1 in the beginning
[47:56] god created the heaven and the earth
[47:58] and then in revelations chapter 21
[48:00] verses 1 to 3
[48:02] john says and i saw a new heaven and a
[48:04] new earth
[48:05] for the first heaven and the first earth
[48:07] were passed away and there was no more
[48:08] seed
[48:09] now this this seems uh very striking and
[48:12] i want to come to a place in future home
[48:13] where brother ram deals with this
[48:15] the new heaven and the new earth are
[48:16] seen they're visualizing he says the
[48:18] first heaven and the first earth are
[48:19] passed away and there was no more sea
[48:21] and i john saw the holy city new
[48:23] jerusalem
[48:24] coming down from god out of heaven
[48:27] so now we see something coming down out
[48:30] of god
[48:31] out of the heaven which is the
[48:32] tabernacle of god and he
[48:34] sees what is called a new jerusalem
[48:37] but then he says prepared as a bride
[48:40] adorned for her husband
[48:42] so when he sees the city his inspiration
[48:44] it's a woman
[48:45] it's a bride he's told he's going to go
[48:48] see the bride
[48:49] and he's shown a city if we read later
[48:51] in the same chapter
[48:52] because what is being expressed is the
[48:53] wife
[48:55] the lamb's wife she has made herself
[48:57] ready so as this
[48:58] city comes down out of heaven out of god
[49:00] the new jerusalem
[49:02] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[49:03] husband it's connected with the new
[49:05] heaven and the new earth
[49:06] it's an expression of new heaven and new
[49:08] earth he says and i heard a great voice
[49:10] out of saying
[49:10] out of heaven saying behold the
[49:12] tabernacle of god
[49:14] is with men because now it has come down
[49:17] out of heaven
[49:18] from god out of heaven and he will dwell
[49:20] with them and they shall be his people
[49:22] and god himself shall be with them and
[49:24] be their god
[49:27] what has what's transpiring in this what
[49:29] john has seen in the end
[49:31] which holds a great truth for us now he
[49:34] is seeing
[49:34] where heaven is now fused and united
[49:37] with earth
[49:38] there's not gonna there's not gonna be a
[49:40] heaven and here we are on earth and
[49:42] we're praying to a god in
[49:44] heaven he's actually saying that now the
[49:45] tabernacle of god is with men
[49:48] and heaven and earth have been fused
[49:49] together and now this is god's permanent
[49:51] dwelling
[49:53] what god had in his mind in the
[49:54] beginning that he wanted to become
[49:56] it now he's saying it's now finally in
[49:58] the image that he had in the beginning
[50:00] to where now it's being expressed where
[50:02] now god is tabernacling with man
[50:04] in this new jerusalem in this new heaven
[50:06] and new earth the heaven is now united
[50:08] with the earth permanently
[50:11] god's permanent dwelling that's why it's
[50:13] called the tabernacle of god is now with
[50:15] men
[50:16] whereas there is god in heaven god in
[50:17] heaven now there's a union in the fusion
[50:19] that takes place
[50:20] expressed here in revelations 21. now
[50:23] watch how brother branham addresses this
[50:24] scripture he reads a few other passages
[50:27] and it's in the sermon future home of
[50:29] the
[50:30] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[50:34] bride
[50:35] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[50:38] and the earthly bride it's it's
[50:40] tapped into in the beginning god created
[50:42] the heaven
[50:43] and the earth it's tapped into where the
[50:45] heaven and earth embraced and kissed at
[50:47] the time of jesus christ on earth
[50:48] is tapped into revelations 21 the new
[50:51] heaven and the earth
[50:52] it's a union together and the future
[50:54] home
[50:55] and he reads in these different places
[50:57] and he reads especially from revelations
[50:59] 21
[50:59] he says by these passages one might
[51:02] think or be led rather to believe
[51:04] that the whole planet of this earth will
[51:06] be destroyed
[51:08] he says i will make a new heaven and a
[51:10] new earth see that the heavens will be
[51:12] gone and the earth will be gone
[51:13] completely annihilated he said
[51:15] if one reads this they could be led to
[51:17] believe that there's a total
[51:18] annihilation of the earth and there's a
[51:20] new earth that comes forward
[51:23] he says but a close study and with the
[51:25] help of the holy spirit we can see
[51:27] the truth of this and that's what we're
[51:29] going to get into
[51:30] we're going into it's only the atmos
[51:33] atmospheres around it and the sin that's
[51:35] upon the earth that will be destroyed
[51:37] why because the earth was an original
[51:39] spoken word
[51:40] attribute of god and notice how he walks
[51:44] us through this we realize that the
[51:45] heavens means the atmosphere is above
[51:47] what does it do it then these thistles
[51:50] and sickness and death and politics and
[51:52] sinful man and sinful woman and evil
[51:53] spirits
[51:54] will all be gone away and annihilated
[51:57] and remember whatever god does to the
[51:59] earth he also does to the person
[52:02] so this is your promise you can hold on
[52:04] to these things that whatever these
[52:05] sicknesses and these thistles and these
[52:06] politics and
[52:07] whatever evil spirits you can be
[52:08] delivered of these things annihilated
[52:10] so it has to be done that way because
[52:12] we're going to live
[52:13] right here we'll prove that by the bible
[52:16] right here is where we live notice
[52:18] thistles germs all sickness and things
[52:19] will be completely taken away
[52:21] all this its existence that's in the
[52:23] earth now man-made systems politics
[52:26] sin all kinds of evil spirits that the
[52:28] world is contaminated with
[52:29] and all the heaven the heavens above us
[52:31] in here is contaminated with evil spirit
[52:34] now we're going to go deep and long in
[52:36] this not me this is brother brown i'm
[52:38] saying this
[52:39] you may say well too late brother aaron
[52:40] i know i made the mistake of not looking
[52:41] at my watch but
[52:42] i'm kind of i'm i'm i'm paying attention
[52:45] to the time
[52:46] he says we're going to go deep and long
[52:47] in this all this exists in the heavens
[52:49] or atmospheres
[52:50] and the earth which is now this earth
[52:53] holds those things
[52:54] but it wasn't made for that purpose
[52:57] sin caused it to be like that it was
[53:00] made by god the creator
[53:02] and all our bodies that we live in now
[53:04] was put on the earth when god created it
[53:06] because you're dust out of the earth it
[53:07] was all laid out there when god
[53:09] himself created it you were in his
[53:12] thinking
[53:13] so in the beginning god created the
[53:15] heaven and the earth you are in his
[53:17] thinking
[53:17] so he gives you an expression of
[53:19] something that you can identify yourself
[53:21] with
[53:22] in the void and the emptiness and the
[53:24] darkness and we can relate to that
[53:25] why you were in his thinking in the
[53:27] beginning he knew the way that you would
[53:29] come
[53:30] he knew the path that you would take so
[53:31] he lays a pattern of redemption
[53:33] he lays a seed of hope so that there's
[53:36] no life here today
[53:37] that has endured abuse or suffering or
[53:39] sickness or doubt
[53:40] or even stumblings or backslidings and
[53:42] even the things that we say from our
[53:44] mouth we shake our fisted god
[53:46] that god laid a pattern in scripture so
[53:48] that you too yourself could believe
[53:51] his love towards you is redemptive and
[53:53] he'll reach to you wherever you are
[53:57] paul even said it of himself you know
[53:58] what i i was made a blasphemer
[54:01] so that everyone could have hope in
[54:03] redemption
[54:05] i know i'm paraphrasing maybe a new
[54:07] translation there
[54:08] but just to put it in our in a way that
[54:10] we could understand some modern language
[54:12] he said look my life my testimony
[54:14] expresses and declares
[54:15] i even a blasphemer have received grace
[54:17] he says why so that i could be an
[54:18] example
[54:22] he was made for that purpose god when he
[54:24] created you were in his thinking in him
[54:26] the great eternal was the thought which
[54:27] is his attribute
[54:28] and now sin caused all this to happen
[54:31] and god through this age
[54:33] through this age is gathering up his
[54:35] material
[54:36] amen it was all laid there in the earth
[54:39] you were in his thinking from the very
[54:41] moment when heaven and earth came
[54:42] forward
[54:42] you were in his thinking you were in his
[54:44] mind he says now in this age
[54:46] he's gathering up his material in this
[54:48] time right now
[54:49] he's gathering up the ordained material
[54:51] that he laid in the earth isn't that
[54:52] wonderful to think of that
[54:55] so he comes to the very end that was in
[54:56] paragraph 65 a future home of the
[54:59] heavenly bridegroom the bridegroom
[55:01] represented in heaven and the bride
[55:03] represented as the earth
[55:04] he says this in paragraph 4 44 as he
[55:06] comes to the end notice
[55:07] the tabernacle of god will be with man
[55:11] the former things has passed away this
[55:13] thing has passed away
[55:15] this means that heaven has come down to
[55:18] resident with man
[55:20] heaven and earth are embraced just
[55:23] exactly when the dove came on part of
[55:25] the earth which was
[55:26] jesus he was dust of the earth man god
[55:29] coming from that one little life germ by
[55:31] creative power
[55:32] and that blood that was in that the life
[55:34] that was in that blood ascended back to
[55:36] god but the blood dripped upon the earth
[55:38] to claim it
[55:39] he says this means heaven and has passed
[55:41] and come down to be resonant with man
[55:43] heaven and earth are embraced just like
[55:46] it happened in jesus
[55:47] at his baptism he's wanting us to see
[55:50] this image
[55:52] that now for us there's something very
[55:55] uh
[55:56] personal that we can identify ourselves
[55:57] with in the beginning god created the
[56:00] heaven and the earth
[56:01] something very personal we can begin to
[56:03] identify with jesus at his baptism
[56:06] that even though he were son yet learned
[56:08] he obedience by the things which he
[56:09] suffered
[56:10] though he was made perfect and made
[56:12] sinless he had to come to a place of
[56:14] surrender
[56:15] at the jordan river even when john says
[56:17] i i'm not worthy to baptize you because
[56:20] uh us to fulfill all righteousness i
[56:23] must humble myself to the will of god
[56:26] gives us hope hope of regeneration hope
[56:29] of a new birth
[56:32] it's the covenant god who's expressed
[56:34] his ambition and desire in genesis 1
[56:36] 1 the covenant god heaven and earth
[56:40] groom and bride christ represented in
[56:44] his own personal ministry
[56:45] heaven and earth embracing brother
[56:48] branham says this in church in its
[56:49] condition
[56:51] uh and i'm just i'm drawing i'm drawing
[56:54] to a close here
[56:54] i'm just very very close so i have one
[56:57] maybe lengthy statement to read from if
[56:59] christ is a mystery
[57:00] and just two other statements before
[57:01] this just to bring it to this this
[57:03] climax here heaven and earth embracing
[57:05] heaven and earth kissing the word being
[57:07] united
[57:08] by abraham says this about that event
[57:10] and john said i bear records seeing the
[57:12] spirit of god like a dove coming down
[57:13] and abiding on him
[57:15] hallelujah he says there you are
[57:18] i i don't know if he's saying there you
[57:20] are and like i'm trying to identify
[57:22] that that's what i was telling you about
[57:23] but it strikes me as him telling me
[57:25] there i am
[57:28] can you see yourself heaven and earth
[57:30] embracing
[57:31] the spirit of god like a dove coming
[57:33] down and abiding on him there you are
[57:35] can you identify yourself personally
[57:36] with that
[57:37] he says the dove and the lamb united
[57:39] together that's when god
[57:41] and men became one that's when heaven
[57:44] and earth embraced each other
[57:46] hallelujah that's when god was made
[57:48] flesh
[57:50] that's when the word was made flesh
[57:52] that's when god was made perfectly flesh
[57:54] at that time of that union at the jordan
[57:56] river that's when god was made flesh
[57:58] brought it
[57:59] that's when god came down from the
[58:00] spirit form and was made a man and dwelt
[58:02] among us
[58:03] that's when all eternity embraced each
[58:05] other
[58:06] that's why you were represented there
[58:08] that's why you have personal
[58:10] representation in jesus christ
[58:11] that's why we believe in him was she
[58:14] and him was the bride in him was the
[58:16] expression of a woman
[58:18] that would come forth as a church that
[58:19] would be his bride
[58:21] she says that that was when god was made
[58:23] flesh
[58:24] so brother brown takes the sermon
[58:26] invisible union
[58:28] of the bride of christ it is the
[58:31] invisible union of
[58:32] the earthly bride to her heavenly
[58:34] bridegroom
[58:35] he has made himself known in this day so
[58:37] that we could know our mate the revealed
[58:39] word
[58:40] it is the the heavenly bridegroom
[58:42] uniting with the earthly bride
[58:44] to take us to our future home
[58:48] to bring us to that place where we would
[58:50] reside in our future home
[58:52] so brother when preaching that sermon he
[58:54] says in jesus the word took my place
[58:57] he became me that a sinner that i might
[58:59] become him the word
[59:01] let me hold true to it not
[59:04] the church the word our allegiance is
[59:07] not to a church
[59:09] our allegiance is to the word he says oh
[59:12] amen oh that spiritual union of christ
[59:16] and his church now because remember when
[59:19] he said earlier that was the greatest
[59:20] event this world had ever seen and we'll
[59:22] see
[59:23] until christ and the church unites
[59:25] together again
[59:27] so when he says all that spiritual union
[59:29] to christ and his church now
[59:30] he's saying now it's the repeat of the
[59:33] greatest event
[59:34] now the earth is seen again when it saw
[59:37] when christ
[59:38] was there in the jordan river all the
[59:40] spiritual union of christ this church
[59:41] now
[59:42] when the flesh is becoming word and the
[59:45] word is becoming flesh
[59:46] we saw the word become flesh in jesus
[59:49] christ now
[59:50] flesh is becoming word i don't think you
[59:52] just got it turned around i just believe
[59:54] there's something special in there for
[59:55] me personally
[59:56] i can see the word made flesh in christ
[59:58] oh let me see
[1:00:00] my flesh become made word
[1:00:04] he says the word is becoming flesh
[1:00:06] manifested vindicated
[1:00:08] just what the bible said would happen in
[1:00:10] this day it's happening
[1:00:11] day by day
[1:00:14] why it's accumulating so fast out there
[1:00:16] in those deserts amen
[1:00:19] and these things taking place that i
[1:00:21] couldn't even keep up with it
[1:00:23] we're nearing the coming of jesus to be
[1:00:25] united with this church that's what that
[1:00:27] coming represents
[1:00:28] a union united where the word becomes
[1:00:30] the word
[1:00:31] call of the holy spirit he says
[1:00:33] searching the hearts
[1:00:36] god was made flesh that day when heaven
[1:00:37] and earth embraced
[1:00:39] now once again heaven and earth are
[1:00:42] embracing
[1:00:43] and it's not just the word being made
[1:00:44] flesh but flesh being made word he says
[1:00:46] it's word
[1:00:47] becoming the word i want to read this
[1:00:51] statement
[1:00:52] from christ is the mystery of god
[1:00:54] revealed
[1:00:56] that's lengthy i'm starting with
[1:00:57] paragraph 476 he says it's god
[1:00:59] in man that's his manifestation
[1:01:04] that's what he's revealing that's what
[1:01:07] he's trying to do
[1:01:08] in god's own word revealing it it shows
[1:01:11] that man cannot create and i believe
[1:01:12] he's using moses as an example just
[1:01:14] prior to this he says
[1:01:15] god is the creator and it ain't man no
[1:01:18] more
[1:01:19] i don't mind using ain't there it ain't
[1:01:21] man no more
[1:01:22] it's god the creator in man which is his
[1:01:26] church now
[1:01:27] he says amen going home to heaven
[1:01:31] that's the season we're living in it's
[1:01:33] god in his bride
[1:01:34] going home to heaven live with him ever
[1:01:37] god expresses eternal love to his church
[1:01:40] he says listen listen close now i want
[1:01:42] you to not to fail to get this
[1:01:46] no other church no other sign no other
[1:01:48] fellowship no other government no other
[1:01:50] testimony no the creed no denomination
[1:01:52] is accepted outside of this
[1:01:55] god accepts nothing else but that christ
[1:01:58] in you the hope of glory
[1:01:59] the only thing that god recognizes no
[1:02:01] fellowship no church he's repeating it
[1:02:03] again
[1:02:03] no fellowship no church no creed no
[1:02:05] denomination no nothing everything else
[1:02:07] is dead
[1:02:08] it's fragments that has to be cut off
[1:02:10] pruned off away from the thing
[1:02:11] that christ might live with preeminences
[1:02:14] in you
[1:02:16] so let's examine ourselves to be sure
[1:02:18] that we have not tied ourselves to
[1:02:20] anything that would keep him from having
[1:02:22] preeminence
[1:02:23] in us as he says no other church no sign
[1:02:26] of fellowship government testimony
[1:02:27] created denomination
[1:02:28] everything else has to be cut off all
[1:02:30] the fragments pruned off that he might
[1:02:32] have preeminences in you
[1:02:33] says not referring back got one limp
[1:02:36] here that says
[1:02:36] it's my organization that's got to be
[1:02:38] cut off i got my soul and so here this
[1:02:41] says this my mother tells me i'm a holy
[1:02:42] oh that's got to be cut off too
[1:02:44] well i know my husband wants me to wear
[1:02:46] these shorts that's got to be cut off
[1:02:47] too
[1:02:48] it's got to be cut off and pruned till
[1:02:49] that's just you and christ alone
[1:02:53] think by the living presence of the
[1:02:55] living christ by the living word
[1:02:57] oh living christ living presence living
[1:02:59] word
[1:03:00] that's what i want living christ's
[1:03:02] living presence living word
[1:03:04] he says watch by his own personal
[1:03:06] personal vindication
[1:03:07] proves his church not members he never
[1:03:10] done it in the days of moses
[1:03:11] he never done it in the days of anybody
[1:03:13] else at the end of the world when it
[1:03:15] come
[1:03:15] to the place where it was the
[1:03:16] destruction the days of lot it wasn't
[1:03:18] membership
[1:03:19] it was personal vindication god and
[1:03:22] flesh see
[1:03:23] personal vindication that's what we
[1:03:26] encourage
[1:03:28] is personal vindication not our own
[1:03:30] ministers do not seek their own
[1:03:32] personal vindication but your personal
[1:03:34] vindication
[1:03:35] that christ could be personally
[1:03:37] vindicated in your life that you could
[1:03:39] have an assurance that you've been
[1:03:40] bought with the price
[1:03:41] that you've been sealed with the holy
[1:03:42] ghost that you're walking in the path
[1:03:44] that he has for your life
[1:03:45] it doesn't matter if a church is
[1:03:46] vindicated doesn't matter if a ministry
[1:03:48] is vindicated
[1:03:49] what matters is that you are personally
[1:03:51] vindicated by a living christ
[1:03:53] a living presence a living word
[1:03:57] oh we could take those names and attach
[1:03:59] them to a church but what matters is
[1:04:00] that it's personally vindicated in your
[1:04:02] life
[1:04:04] the personal vindication god and flesh
[1:04:06] the personal vindication
[1:04:08] will invite the musicians to come he
[1:04:09] says remember think of that
[1:04:12] people born in his spirit in a day like
[1:04:14] this
[1:04:15] in this great denominational age that we
[1:04:17] live in and the living god takes his
[1:04:19] living word and vindicates it personally
[1:04:22] that this life that's in the word the
[1:04:24] germ that's in the seed
[1:04:26] and the word is a seed that sower went
[1:04:28] forth to sow and the life
[1:04:30] is christ and the word in the word
[1:04:32] personally in you
[1:04:34] vindicating something that you cannot do
[1:04:37] proving himself that it's not you but
[1:04:40] it's him
[1:04:42] this is what we are holding to this is
[1:04:44] what we're believing for
[1:04:46] a living god takes his living word and
[1:04:48] vindicates it personally
[1:04:50] this life that's in the word in you
[1:04:55] proving himself that it's not you that
[1:04:56] it's him and you've become one
[1:04:59] a love slave to him to be a bride the
[1:05:02] song i was thinking is the key of see
[1:05:04] going home
[1:05:05] i'm going home there's nothing to hold
[1:05:07] me here
[1:05:08] you've become one a love slave to him to
[1:05:12] be a bride
[1:05:13] thanks be to the living god who created
[1:05:16] the heavens and the earth
[1:05:18] and all that's in the midst in the midst
[1:05:21] of the heaven and the earth
[1:05:22] thanks be to god he brings that image up
[1:05:24] right in the middle of this passage
[1:05:26] thanks be to god who created the heaven
[1:05:28] and the earth why
[1:05:29] because what we're reading here is what
[1:05:30] was in genesis 1 1.
[1:05:33] what brother brahm is expressing in
[1:05:35] christ is the mystery god revealed what
[1:05:36] was in the back part of god's mind
[1:05:38] he says just now being made known to the
[1:05:40] church what he was wanting to achieve
[1:05:42] what he was wanting to accomplish what
[1:05:43] he was wanting to express
[1:05:44] that's what was in genesis 1 1. it was
[1:05:47] there
[1:05:47] in the heaven and earth that he created
[1:05:49] it was just hid as a mystery
[1:05:51] thanks be to god the living god who
[1:05:52] created the heaven and the earth no
[1:05:54] wonder he's alpha and omega the
[1:05:56] beginning and the ending
[1:05:57] he was that which is and shall come the
[1:05:59] root and offspring of david the bride in
[1:06:01] morning star
[1:06:02] he is all in all his presence
[1:06:05] in the individual with a personal
[1:06:08] vindication of himself
[1:06:10] expressing himself the living word
[1:06:12] that's promised for the day
[1:06:14] expressing itself through you
[1:06:18] a a vindication of the great
[1:06:21] revelation of god who's the great
[1:06:24] vindication of the great revelation
[1:06:27] of god who is it just one person
[1:06:30] that's all it takes it says you are
[1:06:33] a vindication of the great revelation of
[1:06:36] god look
[1:06:36] only in an individual never in a group
[1:06:40] an individual not in a group this is if
[1:06:43] you read it this is just what he's
[1:06:44] saying
[1:06:45] over and over it's a great it's a
[1:06:46] vindication of the great revelation
[1:06:49] expressing itself through you he says
[1:06:51] look only in an individual
[1:06:53] never in a group an individual not in a
[1:06:56] group
[1:06:56] his identification is with an individual
[1:07:02] he wants you to individually identify
[1:07:04] yourself
[1:07:05] with him in the beginning god created
[1:07:08] the heaven
[1:07:10] and the earth i want i i it should be a
[1:07:12] revelation to you
[1:07:14] that in the beginning we created the
[1:07:15] heaven i was represented in that earth
[1:07:19] not to end in chaos not to end in
[1:07:22] sadness and
[1:07:23] sorrow and disunity but because i was
[1:07:27] linked with that heaven and there's some
[1:07:30] that will leave for
[1:07:31] a later time it's in this hour it's
[1:07:34] united again
[1:07:35] heaven and earth have embraced when
[1:07:38] christ the word comes to your heart
[1:07:40] and makes himself known could we just
[1:07:42] bow our heads for a moment
[1:07:43] why don't we just stand to our feet and
[1:07:45] we'll offer prayer for you
[1:07:56] he says it's to an individual never a
[1:07:58] group an individual
[1:08:00] i could say we've stood as a group maybe
[1:08:03] there'd be some here today that would
[1:08:04] want to
[1:08:08] ask the lord to be personally identified
[1:08:11] with you and you'd want to just raise
[1:08:12] your hand and say lord
[1:08:15] identify yourself with me lord
[1:08:18] maybe you'd say lord i identify with
[1:08:19] genesis 1 2
[1:08:21] darkness void confusion chaos you say
[1:08:24] lord identify yourself with me as the
[1:08:26] spirit of god would move upon the face
[1:08:28] of my deep
[1:08:29] let the spirit of god move upon my chaos
[1:08:32] and my hurt and my sorrow let it move
[1:08:33] upon me lord
[1:08:36] identify yourself with me
[1:08:40] if our heads bowed let us just pray our
[1:08:42] gracious heavenly father
[1:08:44] lord we see a beautiful picture
[1:08:46] unfolding in just one verse
[1:08:50] we see how you in the beginning
[1:08:52] expressed yourself as a heaven and an
[1:08:54] earth
[1:08:55] and it represents christ the word
[1:08:59] and his bride the word
[1:09:02] and we come down to this age the age
[1:09:04] where you're gathering up your material
[1:09:08] and lord we may feel lost and broken we
[1:09:10] may feel
[1:09:11] useless and cast aside and
[1:09:14] we may feel that many years have been
[1:09:16] wasted wandering around
[1:09:19] but lord how long did that earth lay
[1:09:21] there in that condition
[1:09:23] for an appointed time where you begin to
[1:09:25] move and begin to speak
[1:09:28] lord may it be a young soul's appointed
[1:09:31] time today maybe a
[1:09:32] maybe a backslidden believer lord
[1:09:34] whoever it might be that would fall
[1:09:36] under the voice of this message lord
[1:09:38] may this be the moment the time where
[1:09:40] they realize the spirit of god is moving
[1:09:42] upon their chaos
[1:09:43] moving upon their years of brokenness
[1:09:46] moving upon their years of turmoil
[1:09:48] and he's going to bring order going to
[1:09:49] bring beauty

[1:09:53] needs you'd touch us where we're hurting
