[0:00] the um
[0:01] the subject again is supreme faith
[0:03] revealed in abraham i'm specifically
[0:05] looking at how that abraham's journey is
[0:07] connected to adam's fall
[0:10] and uh how the mystery of abraham's
[0:12] faith and his journey
[0:14] there's elements that are hidden in
[0:15] genesis chapter one
[0:17] one two three and four and i don't say
[0:20] that to kind of make the first few
[0:21] chapters mysterious or to add any kind
[0:24] of layer of mystery to abraham's life
[0:27] but we're just looking at how there's
[0:28] certain things that took place in the
[0:30] beginning
[0:31] and then when the beginning was ending
[0:34] and you have this uh
[0:36] new
[0:36] this chaotic order that begins to unfold
[0:39] and god is telling the story in
[0:41] chapters 5 even through 11 of mankind's
[0:44] wickedness judgment and then their
[0:46] resumed wickedness after the flood
[0:48] there's just things that we can look to
[0:51] to understand why god begins to pattern
[0:54] things in abraham's life
[0:56] and not so that we could understand the
[0:58] character abraham but understand how god
[1:00] is dealing with us to produce a
[1:02] rapturing faith and to to anchor
[1:05] ourselves in the unconditional covenant
[1:06] to anchor ourselves in the election of
[1:08] god
[1:09] and i wanted to back up just very
[1:11] quickly
[1:12] make reference to
[1:14] how the kind of the i the image of
[1:16] supreme faith it came to me through the
[1:19] scripture that says where abraham's
[1:21] faith was made perfect when he offered
[1:23] up his son isaac so supreme faith was
[1:26] expressed on mount moriah that the
[1:28] offering of isaac as a sacrifice
[1:31] expressed and it's a very
[1:33] deep deep profound deep and wide picture
[1:38] that expresses certain sentiments or
[1:40] certain things that are very rich and
[1:42] very profound and so
[1:44] there's so much to it that we could keep
[1:45] adding and adding and adding so i'm not
[1:47] wanting to belabor something or just
[1:48] repeat myself but i wanted to bring this
[1:50] image up before us again how that this
[1:52] offer the willingness to offer up isaac
[1:54] and even being asked to offer up his son
[1:56] as a sacrifice um brings this expression
[1:59] of supreme faith
[2:01] and it is said in genesis chapter 22 and
[2:03] i don't have
[2:05] these um scriptures for you to read i
[2:07] wanted to just go through them very
[2:08] quickly but in genesis chapter 22
[2:11] verses 8 and 13 as they're going up the
[2:13] mountain isaac notices we're going to
[2:15] sacrifice and there's no sacrifice and
[2:18] so he inquires as to the sacrifice and
[2:20] abram said abraham said my son god will
[2:23] provide himself a lamb for a burned
[2:25] offering so they want went both of them
[2:27] together this is abraham's
[2:29] seemingly unwavering
[2:31] it's as if he already knows it he's
[2:33] certainly confident he says god will
[2:35] provide himself a lamb he's he's very
[2:37] confident about this and then it says in
[2:39] verse 13 and abraham lifted up his eyes
[2:41] and looked and beheld behind him a ram
[2:44] caught in a thicket by his horns and
[2:46] abraham went and took the ram and
[2:47] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[2:49] the stead of his son and abraham called
[2:52] the name of that place jehovah jireh as
[2:55] it is said to this day in the mount of
[2:56] the lord it shall be seen and we realize
[3:00] that even in the meaning to jehovah
[3:02] jireh we see it is the lord sees but
[3:04] it's the lord sees and he also provides
[3:06] jehovah jireh he provided in that moment
[3:09] according to the confession of abraham
[3:12] who said that god will provide himself a
[3:14] lamb and sure enough it's exactly what
[3:17] happened and so he names it even after
[3:19] what he had spoken and confessed
[3:20] beforehand this place jehovah jireh
[3:23] because god provided
[3:25] and i wanted to i wanted to remind you
[3:26] of that because i'd like to come back to
[3:28] it
[3:29] at the end if possible and just quickly
[3:31] reviewing on the last few services how
[3:34] that god is patterning in abraham and
[3:36] sarah this pattern that we see in their
[3:38] lives he's patterning them after adam
[3:41] and the woman that there's things that
[3:44] are represented as a contrast there's
[3:45] also things that are represented in
[3:47] similarities but we see the image god
[3:49] achieving the image of one man and his
[3:52] wife all alone with the promise that's
[3:54] how adam and the woman were that's where
[3:57] abraham and sarah come after separation
[4:00] and so this uh this call to separate
[4:03] from unbelief achieved an image that we
[4:05] saw in genesis 3 but then it's also
[4:08] achieving a separation from what marred
[4:10] that image a separation from unbelief
[4:13] and so i want to continue to identify
[4:15] the pattern in abraham's life and and
[4:18] some of these things that we can see
[4:20] hidden and that are matching in genesis
[4:22] 1 to 4.
[4:24] and if you could i will just look at
[4:26] verse 10 of our text genesis chapter 13
[4:29] verses 10 11 of our text
[4:32] and it says
[4:33] and as we were noting on the separation
[4:37] that the separation to us as brother
[4:39] brown emphasized it over and over again
[4:41] abraham separating from lot is
[4:44] a type of us as believers separating
[4:47] from unbelief
[4:48] and so it's not identifying
[4:51] human human beings necessarily that
[4:53] we've got to
[4:55] shun and have nothing to do with but
[4:56] rather it speaks more to at the most
[5:00] necessary level separating from unbelief
[5:03] and uh and so i want to focus still on
[5:06] that dynamic but look at it from another
[5:09] another element of it it says in verse
[5:11] 10 and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld
[5:14] all the plain of jordan that it was well
[5:16] watered everywhere and then this
[5:18] annotation before the lord destroyed
[5:20] sodom and gomorrah so this condition was
[5:22] much more beautiful
[5:24] than it would be after the destruction
[5:26] and the judgment even as the garden of
[5:28] the lord this is a peculiar description
[5:30] because it's not often that the garden
[5:31] of the lord is mentioned but yet it's
[5:33] raised up in view as lot chooses
[5:37] this is something that would have had
[5:38] this image or strikingness as the like
[5:40] the land of egypt as thou comest out of
[5:42] zoar then lot chose him all the plain of
[5:46] jordan so this is what he chose he wants
[5:48] the plane the well-watered area the
[5:50] beautiful cities and a lot journeyed
[5:52] east and they separated themselves the
[5:54] one from the other so the separation has
[5:56] transpired
[5:58] and in this separation god is showing us
[6:00] the image of one man and one woman god
[6:02] is showing us the separation from
[6:04] unbelief and remember that the name lot
[6:06] means uh a covering
[6:08] uh it it it that's just it's a very
[6:11] simple definition it means a covering so
[6:13] lot and this is what we're taught in the
[6:15] message of the hour this is just very
[6:17] it's very simple tonight um so if you
[6:20] came studied up and you you you took
[6:22] that five hour energy or popped some of
[6:24] those pills that make you focus really
[6:25] really good you might be a little bit
[6:27] disappointed and wish you would have
[6:28] saved them for tomorrow because it's
[6:29] really really simple i think you're
[6:30] gonna be able to grasp this very easily
[6:32] because you probably already know it but
[6:34] lot then and we're taught this in the
[6:35] message represents the a formal
[6:38] christian the lukewarm believer so it's
[6:40] formal lukewarm religion
[6:43] and if you ponder the characteristics
[6:44] that brother branham identifies in lot
[6:46] you find he's the personification of a
[6:49] label to see and make believer
[6:51] it's like they lived back then i mean
[6:53] law embodies this laodicean attitude and
[6:56] he's the personification of the
[6:58] laodicean make believer and the bible
[7:00] says this and i want you to catch this
[7:02] phrase here and notice this phrase lot
[7:05] journeyed east
[7:07] so he lifts up his eyes he sees the
[7:09] plane of jordan he sees it's well
[7:10] watered and he sees it like the garden
[7:12] of the lord is the land of egypt and he
[7:14] chooses him this and it says in lot
[7:16] journeyed east this is a specific phrase
[7:18] that has tremendous meaning
[7:21] and by saying that lot journeyed east
[7:23] he's identifying lot with the religious
[7:25] spirit that impersonates truth
[7:28] it is a religious move for him it is
[7:30] something that is
[7:31] religiously justified as something that
[7:33] he has uh that he has a certain motive
[7:36] in doing but yet it's not rooted in the
[7:38] word and it wouldn't be like hey i like
[7:40] all the frivolity down there in sodom
[7:41] and hey
[7:42] this looks like it's going to be a lot
[7:44] of fun there when it says lot journeyed
[7:46] east he's being identified with the
[7:48] religious spirit that motivates him
[7:51] brother braham said in the message
[7:52] wisdom versus faith lot was a religious
[7:54] man
[7:56] a type of the formal church that's just
[7:58] a quick statement lot was a religious
[8:00] man a type of the formal church
[8:02] recognize where brother branham is
[8:04] identify where brother is identifying
[8:06] lot it says in the presence of god
[8:08] unrecognized there is always three
[8:10] classes of people in a religious
[8:11] gathering believers make believers and
[8:14] unbelievers well not this one this isn't
[8:16] religious gathering by no means there's
[8:18] always three classes of people in a
[8:19] religious gathering believers make
[8:21] believers and unbelievers the game is
[8:23] figure out who's which right
[8:25] but then it says this always them three
[8:28] and there they was and he's referring
[8:31] right into the time of abraham there is
[8:33] the unbelieving sodomite the
[8:35] make-believer lot
[8:37] and abraham the elected church
[8:39] so this is where brother brown begins to
[8:41] put lot in the context of the story of
[8:43] abraham
[8:44] and i'll say this even in as god has
[8:47] dealt with my heart i feel like i'm not
[8:49] even doing
[8:50] a real deep dive on lot this is just the
[8:52] surface things to look at
[8:54] uh um and how the brother he's placed in
[8:57] the word of god so we must identify that
[8:59] lot was very religious
[9:01] and his journey and east and we're just
[9:03] focusing on this phrase and lot
[9:05] journeyed east
[9:06] it's a representation of this carnal
[9:09] formal man-made religion lots journey
[9:11] and east this is a religious exercise
[9:14] this is a this is something that's
[9:15] motivated by religion brother ram said
[9:18] lot he called him the lukewarm church
[9:20] member in another place he said he had a
[9:22] form of godliness and another place he
[9:24] said lot was a carnal character so these
[9:27] are things that we begin to recognize in
[9:29] the character and the nature of lot and
[9:31] as we mentioned on sunday when we're
[9:33] introduced to him our introduction is
[9:35] strife that there's some sort of
[9:37] competition and
[9:38] and animosity between the herd men and
[9:40] between
[9:41] abraham and lot so when god looking at
[9:45] this just very simply when god separates
[9:47] abraham from lot
[9:49] it it represents something very distinct
[9:52] in abraham's life obedience to the word
[9:55] of god get away from your family get
[9:56] away from your kindred and because of
[9:59] what lot represents it it stands for
[10:01] separation from religion it stands for
[10:04] separation from impersonation
[10:07] and this is something that just kind of
[10:08] gets very near our hearts and something
[10:10] we have to be aware of because as we
[10:12] speak these things it's best just to
[10:14] internalize and look within ourselves
[10:16] how can i separate from unbelief how can
[10:18] i within myself within my thought
[10:20] process within the things i say and do
[10:22] and so
[10:23] when we when we if we recognize this
[10:25] just i know i'm just kind of throwing it
[10:27] out there and there's a lot of things we
[10:28] could use to substantiate it
[10:30] but god separating abraham from lot
[10:33] represents a separation from false
[10:34] religion man-made religion carnal
[10:36] believing make believing laodicean
[10:38] lukewarm condition a formal religion
[10:40] cold religion all those different things
[10:43] we can look then in genesis chapter 4
[10:46] and see the image of false religion
[10:48] we can look in genesis chapter 4 and see
[10:50] this the the the the seeds of a false
[10:53] religion are first seen
[10:55] in the worship of cain in genesis
[10:56] chapter four
[10:58] which is cain is the product of what
[10:59] unbelief
[11:01] and sin in the beginning would begin
[11:02] with unbelief
[11:04] and we've i think we've read this
[11:05] statement uh before
[11:07] but uh it's i want to i want to read it
[11:10] again just to kind of reintroduce some
[11:12] of these things
[11:13] into evidence it says and you notice
[11:15] that all those cults of this day are
[11:16] beginning in genesis they have their
[11:18] starting back in genesis winding up here
[11:21] in the last day for instance many of
[11:23] them like how that formal religion being
[11:25] in kane now you identified the formal
[11:27] religion and lot now he's identif we're
[11:30] going back and recognizing that it's
[11:32] genesis was in king and then notice how
[11:34] he paints the kind of the trail of it
[11:36] how it come on out and come down through
[11:38] the sons of noah ham out of ham he had
[11:40] nimrod nimrod built the tower of babel
[11:43] babel comes on down through well let me
[11:45] just stop there for a moment as i've
[11:46] studied the life of abraham within the
[11:49] jewish tradition
[11:51] there's many that believe that abraham
[11:53] withstood nimrod and nimrod threw him
[11:55] into prison for 10 years one tradition
[11:57] as it was 10 years another one is that
[11:59] nimrod threatened to throw him into the
[12:00] fiery furnace so there's a lot of
[12:02] interesting traditions that revolve
[12:04] around abraham and his situation
[12:07] or his his life there in babel but here
[12:10] this nimrod builds a tower of babel and
[12:12] then he carries it babel comes on down
[12:14] through keem nebuchadnezzar's time and
[12:16] on out into revelations babylon notice
[12:18] he just picks it up with cain
[12:20] and that seed goes all the way through
[12:23] the babylon that that existed before
[12:25] abraham was called is the babylon that
[12:28] existed during the time of abraham's
[12:29] seed soul journey in israel it's the
[12:31] babylon that exists today the spiritual
[12:34] babylon in the end time
[12:35] it says how that little seed started way
[12:37] back there at the east side of the gates
[12:40] of eden coming on down winding out all
[12:43] kinds of cults and everything started
[12:44] back there winding themselves out to the
[12:46] end notice that the east side of the
[12:49] gate of eden it says now it behooves us
[12:51] to watch be careful be set in the word
[12:54] many things are taking place today which
[12:56] are unscriptural let's watch the
[12:58] scripture to be sure that we're all
[12:59] right
[13:00] that that is always timely
[13:03] watch the scripture to be sure that
[13:04] we're right there's many things that are
[13:05] taking place even today in 2021 that are
[13:08] not that are not scriptural and that we
[13:10] have to be rooted in scripture
[13:12] and there's even a way that people want
[13:14] to kind of massage the message a little
[13:15] bit
[13:16] to present a picture that is not
[13:18] scriptural
[13:19] and so if the message becomes
[13:21] unscriptural it's a mess not the message
[13:24] because the message harmonizes and
[13:26] dovetails with scripture somebody has
[13:27] massaged it and moved it and changed
[13:30] things of it and presented the wrong
[13:32] picture
[13:33] and so this is
[13:35] brother branham identifying formal
[13:37] religion beginning in cain at the east
[13:39] side of the gates of eden and so in
[13:40] genesis chapter four verse three and in
[13:42] the process of time it came to pass that
[13:45] king brought of the fruit of the ground
[13:47] an offering unto the lord now what
[13:50] stands out about his sacrifice
[13:53] well where we live today if someone said
[13:55] a sacrifice of fruit
[13:57] that wouldn't appear to be a sacrifice
[13:59] we think sacrifice we naturally just
[14:01] associate with the shedding of blood so
[14:03] we can immediately begin to identify
[14:04] with what what we know in scripture that
[14:06] cain's offering was bloodless
[14:09] we know according to scripture that by
[14:10] faith abel offered unto god a more
[14:12] excellent sacrifice than that of cain
[14:15] explicitly telling us that cain lacked
[14:17] revelation he did not have a revelation
[14:19] so it was bloodless it was without
[14:21] revelation
[14:22] and as a result of it not being by
[14:24] revelation he actually takes fruit from
[14:27] the ground it says he brought of the
[14:28] fruit of the ground
[14:30] an offering to the lord and we go back
[14:32] in genesis 3 and what was cursed
[14:35] the ground was cursed and so cain is
[14:38] taking an offering from the ground which
[14:40] had been cursed and so we see that
[14:42] there's a lot of ways that we begin to
[14:43] identify how cain builds a beautiful
[14:46] altar and structures his his worship
[14:49] service in such a way that it's very
[14:50] engaging very inviting very pleasing and
[14:53] very uh very beautiful but yet it lacks
[14:56] revelation and that is actually coming
[14:57] from things that something that is
[14:59] cursed and so cain's worship is carnal
[15:01] worship
[15:02] it it is carnal religion it is
[15:04] impersonation it is not with
[15:06] understanding and so when he offers up
[15:09] the fruit of the ground his offering and
[15:12] i know that we've covered these things
[15:13] before almost exactly a year ago but his
[15:16] offering
[15:18] connects directly to
[15:20] the instinct of man when he sinned in
[15:23] the beginning
[15:24] remember the the religious covering that
[15:26] man engaged in genesis chapter 3 verse 7
[15:29] and the eyes of them both were opened
[15:30] and they knew that they were naked and
[15:32] they sowed fig leaves together and made
[15:34] themselves aprons
[15:36] what was that that was man's response to
[15:39] sin this is man's way to handle unbelief
[15:42] create a religion
[15:43] create a religious covering that we
[15:45] identify the message of the hour that
[15:47] the fig leaves were a religious covering
[15:49] and that was the best that mankind could
[15:51] do because he had no way of addressing
[15:53] sin himself
[15:55] and without revelation he had no way of
[15:56] addressing sin without revelation he had
[15:58] no way of reconciling he had no way of
[16:00] making things right so he began he
[16:02] immediately sews these fig leaves
[16:04] together and fig leaves so it came from
[16:06] a tree that had fruit they took leaves
[16:09] of a tree that grew from the ground that
[16:10] had fruit that would have been from the
[16:12] ground and they sowed themselves apron
[16:14] and cane in his knowledge
[16:17] maybe something that he had been taught
[16:19] by his parents but he didn't quite catch
[16:21] the revelation of goes back and takes
[16:23] maybe even figs from the fig tree that
[16:26] bore the leaves that adam and eve made
[16:28] aprons out of to cover their sin and
[16:30] this is the offering that cain gives god
[16:33] and so cain is his religion is a
[16:36] covering and it's associated with the
[16:38] covering that of of adam and the woman
[16:40] in genesis 3 7.
[16:43] and then
[16:45] and the place that he worshipped is the
[16:47] east side of the gate of eden so it's on
[16:49] the it's on the east side it holds this
[16:51] this allure this attraction when mankind
[16:54] was driven out of it and i want to read
[16:56] this to see how uh
[16:58] brother branham in different places
[16:59] makes reference to this and this one is
[17:00] very pronounced he's in question and
[17:03] answers on genesis he said that they
[17:04] said that he went to the land of nod
[17:07] cain was in eden eden the garden of god
[17:09] laid east of eden the garden of eden was
[17:11] in east of eden the east side of eden
[17:14] and the chairmans were placed and the
[17:16] tree of life was at the east gate of the
[17:18] garden and there's where i think cain
[17:20] and abel made their sacrifice and this
[17:22] is mentioned quite often in the message
[17:24] of the hour and there's other
[17:26] biblical scholars and commentators that
[17:28] refer to this there would have could
[17:30] have been an altar that was built there
[17:32] and there would have been this longing
[17:34] to to be in the garden that they'd been
[17:36] driven out of where these cherubim were
[17:38] placed so there was some geographical
[17:40] location that was said this is this this
[17:42] is east and this is facing east and this
[17:44] is where we're going to worship and this
[17:45] is what we're facing and how we want to
[17:47] worship and he says and there's where
[17:48] the cherubim with the flaming sword
[17:50] wouldn't let them come anymore east of
[17:52] the gate did you notice jesus will come
[17:55] from the east the light rises from the
[17:57] east
[17:59] and so there's um there's a significance
[18:02] and this representation of the east and
[18:05] it begins to have this this is where
[18:07] they went to worship this is this is
[18:09] what stands um this is where jesus is
[18:11] gonna come from so eyes set to the east
[18:13] you're looking for christ the light
[18:15] rises from the east you're looking for
[18:17] the horizon of the sun this is a symbol
[18:19] of east the east we know the west
[18:21] represents a setting sun it represents
[18:23] death but the east it's life it's
[18:25] resurrection it's jesus christ
[18:27] now when cain is judged and he in god
[18:30] has respect unto
[18:33] abel's sacrifice but he rejects cain's
[18:36] sacrifice
[18:37] and then cain is and then he murders his
[18:40] brother
[18:41] and then god deals with him and he's
[18:43] sent out he runs away it says in genesis
[18:45] chapter 4 verse 16
[18:48] and cain went out from the presence of
[18:49] the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on
[18:52] the east of eden
[18:54] so now this
[18:57] is saying that
[18:58] when he's there worshiping he's
[19:00] worshipping
[19:01] at the east of eden and there's some a
[19:03] place that holds this attraction this
[19:05] alert to him but now he goes out from
[19:07] the presence of the lord and he dwells
[19:08] in the land of not not win means
[19:10] wandering commotion
[19:12] uh it's it means to be an exile so he
[19:14] has this it's this unrest nothing is
[19:17] settled uh he has no uh no roots no
[19:20] revelation it's a and it's a wandering
[19:22] it's an unrest it's a it's a commotion
[19:24] that's what nod means
[19:26] and when the bible says that he goes out
[19:28] to dwell in the land of nod on the east
[19:30] of eden it indicates once again a
[19:32] religious motive
[19:34] and it's it's him now if he was facing
[19:37] east what he wants to do is he wants to
[19:39] seemingly go further east supposing that
[19:43] he's going to carve out some identity
[19:45] he's going to establish a civilization
[19:47] he's going to he's going to make a name
[19:48] for himself and it's not going to be in
[19:50] rejection of god but it's going to be a
[19:53] further manifestation of this
[19:54] enlightenment of man and those that that
[19:57] understand god and have some continuity
[19:59] or harmony with this nature and so here
[20:01] here it says on the east of eden it's a
[20:04] it's religious motive that is motivating
[20:06] cain
[20:08] just as lot journeying east
[20:11] and so brother branham and the message
[20:12] power of transformation and i'm glad i'm
[20:14] coming to this statement because i think
[20:15] it'll settle some of you who are kind of
[20:17] trying to think and i'm a contortionist
[20:19] tonight
[20:20] brother branham says in power of
[20:21] transformation he says see how religious
[20:23] it was
[20:25] he reads genesis 4 16 he dwelt on the
[20:27] east of eden he says see how religious
[20:29] it was went around to the east side east
[20:32] side
[20:33] see that's that's the that's him
[20:35] journeying east of eden was him being
[20:37] religious
[20:39] it's a religious spirit that's on cain
[20:42] cain didn't run away just completely
[20:43] broken what have i done can i ever be
[20:45] restored to my family can i ever be
[20:47] restored to my brother he went away
[20:48] under religious anointing that's never
[20:50] quite going to recognize the of
[20:52] what he had done
[20:53] and so he's driven by religious motive
[20:55] he says see how religious he was he went
[20:58] to the east side
[20:59] now this
[21:01] i believe the scripture is intentional
[21:04] that when
[21:05] the that when the bible says that lot
[21:08] journeyed east
[21:10] and that cain
[21:11] went to on the east of eden it creates a
[21:14] symmetry and a connection between lot
[21:17] and the nature of cain
[21:18] and brother brahm does the same thing in
[21:20] the message the junction of time
[21:22] he said when abraham and lot journeyed
[21:24] together abraham to be heir of the world
[21:27] all things now he had a lukewarm
[21:29] backslidden church member with him
[21:31] i thought you'd all amen really loud
[21:33] about that he had a lukewarm backslidden
[21:35] church member with him his nephew blood
[21:37] relation to him
[21:39] okay good you guys are doing good
[21:40] tonight and his name was lot a lukewarm
[21:43] modernistic bloodless church member just
[21:46] a very type of today lot is a lukewarm
[21:49] modernistic bloodless church member in
[21:52] other words he does not have
[21:54] he does not he's not under the atonement
[21:56] and so we see a perfect picture even of
[21:58] the foolish virgin in that they had it
[22:00] in every age they got it today a form of
[22:02] godliness denying the power thereof they
[22:04] got it today there was lot going along
[22:07] right along just as religious as he
[22:09] could be
[22:10] remember those are the statements that
[22:11] are made of cain just as religious as he
[22:13] could be he was in church he did things
[22:16] religiously lot is just as religious as
[22:18] he could be but when it comes to the
[22:19] showdown there's spiritual understanding
[22:22] and then brother bam says why it even
[22:24] began way back when cain and abel so
[22:27] he's making this direct connection of
[22:29] the nature of abraham and nature of lot
[22:31] he said we see this personified again in
[22:33] cain and abel when cain a modern man
[22:35] came to the church and
[22:37] to the altar built a church he says cain
[22:40] built to church
[22:41] he uses that reference quite often that
[22:43] the building of an altar represented
[22:45] building church so you say well abraham
[22:46] never went to church he built altars
[22:48] everywhere
[22:49] he worshipped he he went to churches not
[22:51] that lot forms this anti-type well if
[22:53] lot's of religious church-going church
[22:55] member i don't want to go to church no
[22:57] abraham shows us the right way of doing
[22:59] it so cain was a modern man came and
[23:01] built a church what am i trying to say
[23:03] to you
[23:04] i'm trying to tell you my friend that
[23:06] just going to church and making a
[23:08] confession and doing good works will
[23:09] never save you you've got to be born
[23:12] again it has to come as a spiritual
[23:14] revelation
[23:16] it's there's a i think there's a way
[23:17] that we get so church-centric and we
[23:20] focus everything in on church to think
[23:21] that it's all about the church it's
[23:23] about that's what it's about well
[23:26] well you see we say that maybe in
[23:28] defense to those who don't believe in
[23:29] going to church but don't we believe
[23:31] that if you go to church without
[23:32] spiritual revelation you're no better
[23:34] off than those that stay at home
[23:37] this is this is something that we have
[23:39] to take into consideration because
[23:41] church isn't the salve it's not the it's
[23:43] not the soothing it's not the smoother
[23:45] uh what church becomes is a place where
[23:48] those who need the birth hear about it
[23:50] and those who've received it feed it
[23:53] and so it becomes like this fulcrum
[23:54] everything's gonna this is where things
[23:56] really begin to connect and make sense
[23:58] is the spiritual revelation of the new
[24:00] birth which is the baptist only goes
[24:02] i've got to be born again it's got to
[24:03] become a spiritual revelation and so
[24:05] that's what begins to bring the
[24:07] separation between abraham and lot
[24:10] that's what brings the separation
[24:11] between cain and abel
[24:15] in the sermon does god change his mind
[24:17] let me just slow down here
[24:19] i'm going so fast i think i can
[24:22] i had a couple quotes i'd taken out of
[24:24] my notes because i thought it would be
[24:25] um would be too long tonight and
[24:28] i realize i'm not going to be too long
[24:30] and i don't mind being long as long as
[24:32] i'm not too long
[24:34] but even reading these i think i might
[24:35] be too short so
[24:37] bear with me i think i'm going to read
[24:38] some of these quotes that i had pulled
[24:39] out but had at the end of my notes
[24:43] brother branham says this he says lot
[24:45] now catch how he makes this connection
[24:46] it's in the sermon by faith moses lord
[24:49] as he had to make a choice abraham give
[24:51] lot his choice and god gives you your
[24:53] choice choose you this day who you'll
[24:55] serve in the garden there was a tree of
[24:57] knowledge and a tree of life brother
[24:59] brahm does this in a few places where he
[25:01] talks about abraham and lot choosing and
[25:03] he relates it to the choice in the
[25:04] garden of eden it says man was given the
[25:06] privilege to choose either one he
[25:08] desired and so it is today you're given
[25:10] your privilege as three more agents to
[25:12] choose whatever you want to choose
[25:14] my advice to you is don't look at the
[25:16] modern things around you and the
[25:19] popularity and the glamour that you
[25:21] could be but choose rather by faith in
[25:23] him
[25:24] that give the promise that someday he
[25:26] will come and will right in all wrongs
[25:28] and will give you eternal life and raise
[25:30] you up no matter if you take the
[25:32] despised way with the lord's few make
[25:34] that choice
[25:36] again it's this it's this image that
[25:38] brother branham connects of the choice
[25:40] of lot to the choice that was in the
[25:42] garden of eden even the choice of
[25:44] abraham adam and the woman choosing uh
[25:46] to choose life choose between the tree
[25:48] of knowledge and the tree of life and
[25:50] they were to abstain from partaking of
[25:52] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[25:53] and they partook in it he said lot's
[25:55] choice was akin to adam's sin
[25:58] lot's choice was in harmony with the
[26:00] fall of the woman and it's also in
[26:02] harmony with the fall of cain or the sin
[26:04] of cain to offer religious worship
[26:11] he says in the message hearing
[26:13] receiving and acting he says now these
[26:15] differences have always been since cain
[26:17] and abel
[26:18] cain and abel the first human beings
[26:19] that produced life on earth
[26:21] adam and eve brought forth two one one
[26:23] of one kind and one of another there was
[26:26] cain and abel there was esau and jacob
[26:28] all along down the line there's always
[26:30] been that the two spirits warn against
[26:32] one another in the churches we've had
[26:34] plenty of it and it's always come to a
[26:37] place where there had to be a time of
[26:38] separation
[26:39] abraham and lot started out to find the
[26:42] city whose builder and maker was god lot
[26:45] was a carnal character and it finally
[26:48] come to a place that abraham and lot had
[26:50] to be separated before abraham could
[26:52] ever attain the promise
[26:54] they had to separate one from the other
[26:56] and so it is tonight you've got to
[26:58] separate yourself from the things of the
[26:59] world you've got to walk with christians
[27:01] i'm a great believer in christians
[27:03] fellowshipping with christians says you
[27:04] cannot walk together unless you're
[27:06] agreed and you agreed first with christ
[27:08] there's the primary part you agreed
[27:10] first with christ and every man agrees
[27:11] with christ will agree with you
[27:14] that the first degree with qui agree
[27:16] with christ
[27:17] he's saying there's two spirits and he
[27:18] lines up cain and abel jacob and esau
[27:20] and he recognizes these twins come even
[27:23] down to jesus and judas two spirits warn
[27:26] against one another in the churches and
[27:28] as he paints the picture cain and abel
[27:30] he brings it again to abraham and lot
[27:32] how they seemingly started out together
[27:34] searching for a city whose builder and
[27:36] maker is god but lot has a carnal
[27:38] character
[27:40] and because he has a carnal character
[27:42] god has to separate abraham from lot so
[27:45] that he's not confused as an heir of the
[27:48] promise and so that he doesn't hinder
[27:50] abraham from fully walking into the
[27:52] promise he had to bring that separation
[27:55] and i just want you to catch how the
[27:56] message of the hour identifies cain and
[27:58] abel and then also this image and
[28:00] abraham in lot and then this is this
[28:03] what may be the one that is the most
[28:05] pronounced how brother branham deals
[28:07] with this
[28:08] and the message does god change his mind
[28:12] he says i think that what abel had at
[28:14] the beginning a spiritual revelation
[28:17] that it wasn't fruit of the field of the
[28:18] works of our hands or so forth it was
[28:20] blood
[28:22] and he offered to god a more excellent
[28:24] sacrifice than cain did
[28:27] so this is brother branham
[28:29] um
[28:30] laying these things out
[28:33] abel had a spiritual revelation
[28:35] cain did not have a spiritual revelation
[28:38] then he says immediately we find in
[28:39] abraham this one's in there brother john
[28:41] if you could find it and does god change
[28:42] his mind he says we find in abraham and
[28:46] lot the same thing in a choice
[28:49] the same thing in abel and cain is the
[28:53] same thing in abraham and lot
[28:55] a choice
[28:56] which we see that he already identified
[28:58] it as a choice between
[29:00] uh uh is a adam and the woman had a
[29:02] choice in the garden between good and
[29:04] evil now there's a choice set between
[29:07] abel and cain and now we find abraham
[29:10] and lot the same thing in a choice
[29:12] because lot went down and when the time
[29:14] come when the spiritual and the natural
[29:17] church came in a clash because of the
[29:20] herdsmen
[29:21] when we were going through the the story
[29:23] of ruth and we just covered those first
[29:25] few chapters in the story of ruth we
[29:26] found that ruth was a moabite and you
[29:28] looked at the history of the moabites
[29:30] and who are the moabites they're sons of
[29:31] lot
[29:32] to the relationship lot's daughters
[29:34] bring forth these sons moab and you see
[29:36] the what is moab very formal seven
[29:38] altars balaam balaam worship all these
[29:40] things the fundamental the religious the
[29:43] uh so close it could deceive the elect
[29:45] this is what lot represents and we
[29:48] notice how they talked about the clash
[29:50] the clash coming the conflict coming
[29:51] with moab we see it right here already
[29:54] in abraham and lot it happened long
[29:56] before moab was on the scene it happens
[29:58] between abraham and lot the spiritual
[30:00] and the natural church clash because of
[30:03] the herdsmen they had to separate one
[30:04] from another
[30:05] and whenever this does it sets up a
[30:08] jealousy
[30:09] we find out abel because he god had
[30:12] received him and he did not receive
[30:13] cain's beautiful big offering he had
[30:16] toiled so hard for
[30:18] and was religious and bowed down and
[30:20] worshiped and done everything that abel
[30:22] did only he didn't have the revelation
[30:24] of what was the truth
[30:27] the the bouncing back and forth now
[30:29] brother brown talks about cain and abel
[30:31] abraham and lot
[30:33] abel offered by revelation cain didn't
[30:35] offer by revelation lot and there was
[30:37] jealousy with lot
[30:38] lot was jealous
[30:40] cain is jealous so we find out when god
[30:42] accepted abel's revelation and his
[30:43] offering it made cain get jealous of
[30:46] abel
[30:47] and there was the first murder
[30:49] we find out that jealousy become between
[30:51] the herdsmen of abraham and lot and they
[30:54] had to separate we find out that moses
[30:56] and cora had a clash also jesus and
[30:58] judas had a clash and as ever it's been
[31:01] the same thing
[31:03] and so is it today
[31:05] the natural church and the spiritual
[31:07] church have a clash when they come
[31:09] together
[31:11] do you realize your inner conflict
[31:13] as a believer is when the real spiritual
[31:16] gene begins to butt heads with the
[31:17] carnal gene inside of you
[31:20] with all the theology all the tradition
[31:22] all the ways of man and all the even
[31:23] some of the message myths that we we
[31:25] pick up through our through being raised
[31:27] in the message and things
[31:29] uh we've we heard a song written by a
[31:31] message believer and we get in our heads
[31:32] like it was a quote right and there's
[31:34] these things that loom very large in our
[31:35] theology that we're nothing more than i
[31:37] need something that rhymes i need
[31:39] something that rhymes oh that sounds
[31:40] really good and it becomes part of our
[31:42] message theology it's like no it was
[31:44] just a beautiful melody that expressed a
[31:45] particular thought it's not part of our
[31:47] doctrine and there's a lot of things
[31:49] that exist within our carnal minds
[31:51] whether it be memories and past
[31:53] experiences and past hurts or even
[31:55] expectations and ideas of the future
[31:58] sometimes our biggest conflicts aren't
[32:00] with people but with the carnal ideas
[32:03] that deeply reside within our psyche
[32:05] within our minds and our memories and
[32:06] our hopes and ambitions and then the
[32:08] spiritual gene begins to want to drive
[32:10] those things out and we have a clash
[32:12] within ourselves and god allows it to
[32:14] come to conflict because he wants to
[32:16] address that dichotomy he wants to
[32:19] address that the dissonance the
[32:21] difference that you have within yourself
[32:22] so he can say lot it's time to leave
[32:24] you've got no place in this
[32:27] got no place in this inheritance
[32:29] i've been studying a lot on on ishmael
[32:32] and i'm feeling that maybe we might get
[32:33] into the subject of ishmael here very
[32:35] soon as it relates to the story of
[32:37] abraham and you'll find that in the
[32:39] story of abraham
[32:40] abraham's life is continually separating
[32:44] and remember we mentioned conflict
[32:46] delayed is conflict multiplied in the
[32:48] sense that if if if
[32:50] abraham had never had conflict then he's
[32:52] going to have a multiple conflicts in
[32:53] the end
[32:54] so you recognize god puts him through
[32:56] conflict over and over again and he
[32:58] allows abraham it's very beautiful
[33:00] despite his mistakes abraham succeeds
[33:03] out of them each time
[33:06] he's it are you just i get kind of
[33:07] caught up and now caught up in the story
[33:09] of abraham but god tells him hey i want
[33:11] to take you to a place that's very very
[33:12] beautiful he walks him into canaan he
[33:14] begins to look around and see this
[33:16] beautiful beautiful beautiful country
[33:18] and he's walking around and seeing it
[33:19] and he's like this is where god's going
[33:21] to bless me next thing that happens
[33:22] famine
[33:25] wait a minute
[33:27] this is the place of blessing and it's a
[33:29] family it drives them down into egypt
[33:31] but god gets them out of egypt we find
[33:32] these over and over again these things
[33:34] begin to happen and what's what's
[33:36] happening things come up and god
[33:38] identifies there's a conflict and god
[33:41] gets abraham through it and his faith is
[33:43] stronger as a result of it and god just
[33:45] keeps he comes into conflict even in his
[33:48] own line god makes his faith stronger
[33:50] and you find there was this continual
[33:52] separation in the life of abraham
[33:54] continual separation even coming down to
[33:56] where after
[33:58] isaac is born there's still more
[34:00] separating that needs to take place
[34:03] and he separates from
[34:04] ishmael because this is the way that god
[34:07] this is the life that begins to
[34:08] transpire and take place in abraham's
[34:10] life
[34:11] is this separation he says and as ever
[34:13] it's been the same thing and so is it
[34:15] today
[34:16] the natural church and the spiritual
[34:18] church have a clash when they come
[34:19] together
[34:21] now the natural tries to match the
[34:22] spiritual always with the carnal
[34:24] impersonation
[34:25] but as it was with east on jacob it will
[34:29] not work
[34:31] i'm just letting you know right now if
[34:33] you're impersonating it's not gonna work
[34:34] for you
[34:36] it's not gonna work you gotta you're
[34:38] gonna have to get real
[34:40] because you're the seed of god
[34:42] and it's gonna have to be real
[34:43] impersonation won't work and thank god
[34:45] that he let some of our best acting
[34:48] performances fail
[34:50] like we should have got i don't know if
[34:51] it's a grammy emmy or what it is but
[34:53] should have got something for that
[34:55] acting an oscar that's what it is
[34:57] i should have got an oscar for that
[34:59] performance and god won't let you even
[35:01] get nominated because he's gonna make
[35:03] you fall flat on your face to recognize
[35:05] that's not your call in life you're the
[35:07] real thing
[35:08] and he allows conflict and allows
[35:10] difficulty allows struggle to expose
[35:12] ourselves i'm a fraud
[35:13] i'm pretending i'm acting this isn't the
[35:15] real thing and so god brings us into
[35:17] these conflicts brings us into these
[35:18] places so that we can reevaluate our
[35:20] lives re-evaluate our experience
[35:21] re-evaluate the direction we've been
[35:23] headed and realized oh god thank you for
[35:25] showing me that there's more that i can
[35:27] have in my experience with you instead
[35:29] of just letting me coast all the way on
[35:31] through as a really good actor
[35:35] it will not work it works for an esau
[35:38] but you're not an esau you're a jacob so
[35:40] whatever little bit of esau remains in
[35:42] us by the nature and nurture of a
[35:43] natural birth and going many years
[35:45] without a new birth that nature has got
[35:48] to be completely excommunicated from our
[35:50] thought process and isolated away from
[35:52] our faith so our faith can stand supreme
[35:55] and pure
[35:58] this is what is being represented in
[36:00] separating abraham from lot is that god
[36:03] is going to separate us from our
[36:04] religion separate us from our pretense
[36:06] separate us from impersonation separate
[36:08] us from mythologies and traditions and
[36:10] all the carnal lukewarm formal ways that
[36:13] we conduct ourselves that make us feel
[36:15] very good religiously but don't bring us
[36:17] any closer to god literally
[36:20] that's what the separation was about
[36:23] you'll find that abraham's story is a
[36:24] journey of separation
[36:26] he himself from a bloodless lifeless
[36:28] religion
[36:30] to a religion that had feeling in it
[36:33] religion that had life in it you say
[36:34] didn't have feeling that took a man in
[36:35] his advanced age and asked him to be
[36:37] circumcised
[36:38] tell you abraham lived a rough life
[36:41] the things that god asked him to do the
[36:43] things that were required of them i i'm
[36:44] kind of getting into some of the other
[36:46] things i've been studying that i thought
[36:47] that are developing maybe into some
[36:49] other areas but here abraham has told i
[36:52] give you this land and he doesn't have a
[36:54] place to bury his wife he's got to buy
[36:56] it and play an exorbitant price for it
[36:58] think about that
[36:59] this is your land abraham i give it to
[37:02] you but he has to overpay for a burial
[37:04] plot for his wife and you read abraham's
[37:07] testimony he never
[37:09] rebukes god
[37:12] when his wife died and said you know
[37:14] what you gave me this land and i don't
[37:15] have a place to bury or notice the
[37:17] character of abraham where he just kept
[37:19] taking it in stride and he kept
[37:22] believing and he kept persevering the
[37:24] character that is on display in
[37:25] abraham's life is so beautiful how
[37:27] abraham called out of ur no different
[37:29] than anyone else but by walking with god
[37:32] he has this disposition to be able to
[37:34] take hardships and difficulties and even
[37:36] what seems to be so against the promise
[37:39] to not even have a own a piece of land
[37:41] to bury his wife that he has to overpay
[37:43] to bury her that he conducted himself
[37:45] above it all
[37:47] why because his story is a journey of a
[37:49] lifeless carnal false cold even demonic
[37:53] worship of false gods
[37:55] to a life
[37:57] a religion with life in it
[38:00] that's the story of abraham
[38:03] separation from a bloodless
[38:06] being a bloodless church member
[38:09] and so as lots worship is identified in
[38:12] cain
[38:15] abraham's worship is identified in
[38:16] abel's revelation
[38:21] genesis chapter 4 it says in abel he
[38:23] also brought the first lings of his
[38:24] flock
[38:26] and of the fat thereof
[38:28] and the lord had respect unto abel into
[38:30] his offering
[38:32] though it doesn't say that lot
[38:35] made an offering literally that was akin
[38:38] to the offering of cain
[38:40] but yet in his choosing the garden of
[38:42] god and choosing the well-watered plains
[38:44] and despite its wickedness it's in the
[38:47] similitude of the transgression of cain
[38:49] who offered fruit of the ground a
[38:51] beautiful altar without blood lots
[38:53] identified in that
[38:55] but now in abel's offering
[38:58] he takes the firstlings of his flock and
[39:00] of the fat thereof and the lord had
[39:02] respect unto abel and to his offering
[39:05] now
[39:06] instead of getting into whether it be
[39:08] the visions that abraham had and the
[39:09] different altars that he built and all
[39:10] the different sacrifices he would have
[39:12] made let's look at the one in general it
[39:14] when he offered up his son in genesis
[39:16] 22.
[39:18] the bible says that abraham offered and
[39:20] he's asked by god to offer up
[39:22] his only son
[39:24] in the hebrew that could have been
[39:25] translated to very easily only begotten
[39:28] son
[39:29] he's been asked to offer up his only
[39:31] begotten son and i believe the scripture
[39:34] is very harsh in this detail
[39:36] to not cause any confusion as to the
[39:39] place that ishmael has ishmael has his
[39:41] own covenant god gives him a covenant
[39:43] god looks out after him but god has
[39:44] wanted to be very specific that there's
[39:46] no mixing and misunderstanding as to
[39:48] whom the seed the promise of the seed
[39:50] pertains to and so when he tells abraham
[39:53] to go sacrifice his son he says your
[39:55] only begotten son
[39:57] isaac
[39:58] so that it's clear that this one has a
[40:00] special representation as being the seed
[40:03] of abraham through serra which is the
[40:04] only one that god recognized so abraham
[40:07] offers his only begotten son on mount
[40:09] moriah in an offering isaac as his only
[40:12] begotten son it follows the pattern of
[40:14] abel offering the firstling of his flock
[40:18] just as abel offered the first thing of
[40:21] this flock here is abraham offering his
[40:23] only begotten son
[40:25] and it's in those very moments that
[40:27] abraham is offering up his only son that
[40:29] god provides a ram for abraham
[40:34] and when god provides the ram for
[40:37] abraham
[40:38] and i know we went through we've gone
[40:40] through this story but when god provides
[40:42] it abraham has to go grab it he fetches
[40:45] it he's going to place it upon that
[40:47] altar he's going to cut it open to allow
[40:49] it to bleed he's going to offer this
[40:51] sacrifice upon the altar and he's going
[40:53] to shed the blood of this lamb upon the
[40:55] altar as an offering to god instead of
[40:59] his son
[41:03] what is that in the image of it's not
[41:06] merely just in the image of abel
[41:07] offering his worship in genesis chapter
[41:09] 4
[41:10] but it's in the image of
[41:12] genesis chapter 3 verse 21
[41:15] and the very
[41:17] heated moments of the sin
[41:19] and the judgment that followed
[41:22] it says unto adam also and to his wife
[41:24] did the lord god make coats of skins
[41:28] and clothed them
[41:30] remember when we looked at the scripture
[41:32] a year ago how that in the in the way
[41:33] that the scripture is presented
[41:36] uh we know we know that it's the lord
[41:39] god
[41:40] the lord god made coats of skin and
[41:42] clothe them but in the original language
[41:45] it it doesn't suggest that god went out
[41:48] hunted down a lamb slayed them skinned
[41:50] them cured the hide
[41:52] and and stitched everything and sewed
[41:53] them together and made these skins for
[41:55] adam and and and the woman and put them
[41:58] on him but it's saying that god provided
[42:01] them the knowledge god gave them if i
[42:04] could say this way god gave them the
[42:06] revelation that this is what they were
[42:08] supposed to do
[42:10] and if we could take it in the sense
[42:11] that god god gave this commandment and
[42:15] caused adam
[42:16] to go god provided a lamb for them god
[42:20] provided a way for them god gave him a
[42:22] revelation of what it took to escape out
[42:24] of the garden under a promise with the
[42:26] covenant of redemption they were to take
[42:28] this lamb and slay it and dress
[42:30] themselves in the bleeding skims of this
[42:32] lamb this is the revelation that god
[42:34] gave adam so it would have been adam as
[42:36] the sinner and the participant that
[42:38] would have taken the lamb and slayed it
[42:42] according to the revelation that god
[42:43] gave him and then dressed himself in it
[42:46] and even if you say well it says brother
[42:48] bram said over and over again that god
[42:49] killed
[42:50] god killed the lamb but he also said god
[42:52] killed his son
[42:54] but who was it that killed him the
[42:56] guilty
[42:58] who actually put their hands upon him
[42:59] according to a prophecy according to
[43:00] prom put their hands on him and killed
[43:02] him it was it was his own
[43:05] his own brothers that did it
[43:07] and so that was adam's revelation
[43:10] in genesis 3 21 to make these coats of
[43:12] skins and clothing that would have been
[43:14] the shedding of blood that would have
[43:15] been the first sacrifice because of sin
[43:17] that's what makes abel's revelation so
[43:19] important
[43:21] because it's not merely it's it's really
[43:22] not just coming out of
[43:24] nowhere it's connected to genesis 3 21.
[43:28] whereas abel's offering is connected to
[43:29] genesis 3 7. what's the problem with
[43:31] that that's in the throes of guilt
[43:34] and fear
[43:35] and what do we do religious covering
[43:38] without revelation let's sew fig leaves
[43:40] together and dress ourselves but then
[43:42] adam's
[43:43] the dressing himself and the slain of
[43:45] the land is up by revelation and so abel
[43:48] picks up this revelation of what took
[43:50] place in the garden and he dr he kills a
[43:53] firstling of his flock just as would
[43:54] have been done as they're being driven
[43:56] out of the garden and that's what
[43:58] abraham's revelation is connected to the
[44:01] offering of abel and even the sac the
[44:03] revelation of adam
[44:06] and the part to me that is so beautiful
[44:07] in that
[44:10] is
[44:10] god said in this very these very
[44:12] passages in genesis 3 15 as he cursed
[44:14] the serpent
[44:16] and the seat of the woman will crush
[44:17] your head
[44:19] and this is the prophecy of jesus christ
[44:21] and brother brahman said that god
[44:23] designated genesis 3 15 to abraham
[44:26] and so abraham's life patterns this
[44:28] faithfulness to that promise where he
[44:31] has to back away from every unbelief he
[44:33] has to separate himself from anything
[44:34] contrary to the promise and then his
[44:36] life begins to act in accordance to the
[44:38] very first revelation that comes after
[44:41] the promise that it's by blood this seed
[44:43] of the woman is going to be a lamb his
[44:45] blood has to be shed the sinner has to
[44:48] be covered in that blood and abraham
[44:50] exits the garden of eden with that
[44:51] revelation then abel offers the same
[44:54] sacrifice of a lamb before god at the
[44:57] eastern side of eden and then abraham
[44:59] does the same thing with genesis 3 15
[45:02] designated to him he goes upon mount
[45:04] moriah seemingly to offer his own son
[45:08] but god once again provides a lamb
[45:11] instead of his son
[45:14] we know that cain and then even in the
[45:15] pre-figure of lot offered the wrong
[45:17] sacrifice
[45:19] so many scriptures that we could read
[45:20] how able
[45:22] offered blood by revelation the
[45:23] revelation of what what took place in
[45:25] genesis 3.
[45:27] i saw mother mike if you come just close
[45:30] here
[45:32] so what god does is he takes abraham and
[45:34] separates him from cain's religion
[45:38] he takes abraham and he sets separates
[45:40] him from anything that's false so that
[45:42] he can build his faith
[45:45] i know i've already made reference to it
[45:46] i just want to close with this image in
[45:48] your mind
[45:49] the climax of climax of that faith
[45:52] god takes abraham and begins to separate
[45:54] him and mold him the climax of that
[45:56] faith was a sacrifice
[46:00] that particular sacrifice on mount
[46:02] moriah
[46:03] in the figure of genesis 3 and genesis 4
[46:06] to take a lamb that god has specifically
[46:08] provided supernaturally
[46:11] god provided
[46:12] because what did he say
[46:14] my son god will provide himself
[46:18] a lamb for a burnt offering
[46:21] god provided
[46:22] himself even if it be god provided as a
[46:25] worship and an offering to himself a
[46:27] lamb and so he goes up to the he goes up
[46:30] to the the altar
[46:32] and god provides does he provides that
[46:35] lamb what is it calling back to genesis
[46:37] 3 15.
[46:38] call back to genesis 3 21 a call back to
[46:40] genesis 4 4
[46:42] pure true worship
[46:44] and spirit and truth
[46:46] separated from carnality
[46:48] separated from false religion separated
[46:50] from politics and pretense i know i use
[46:52] those words a lot popularity all the
[46:54] things that just
[46:55] muddy up our worship
[46:57] that's what separating from lot
[46:59] represented
[47:00] is a separation from carnal lukewarm
[47:02] formal cold religion
[47:04] i say lord be it unto me according to
[47:06] thy word
[47:07] just keep purging me just keep
[47:08] separating me keep getting me away from
[47:10] all unbelief because i know my faith
[47:12] will grow strong as he does it that's
[47:15] why abraham's faith got stronger after
[47:16] 25 years
[47:19] because he kept separating from unbelief
[47:20] in the absence
[47:22] of the tangible evidence of the promise
[47:24] his faith grew stronger as long as he
[47:26] separated from unbelief
[47:29] he didn't need to be able to put his
[47:30] hands on a pregnancy test he didn't need
[47:31] to go in and get a physical say yep
[47:33] you're you're not sterile you're looking
[47:34] good your wife's got good eggs
[47:35] everything's great everything's looking
[47:37] good it's just a matter of time oh boy
[47:38] it's going to happen he didn't need any
[47:40] of that
[47:41] all he had to do is separate himself
[47:42] from unbelief in the absence of the
[47:44] manifestation his faith could still grow
[47:45] stronger
[47:46] and god can do the same thing for us
[47:49] because i recognize we live we live in a
[47:50] dry time we live we live we live in a
[47:53] time when the world is more pronounced
[47:55] than it's ever been
[47:56] and and its ideas and its ideologies and
[47:59] boys satan is so slick
[48:01] to take things that are purely worldly
[48:04] and put like just a little bit of try to
[48:06] put a little bit of a bible sheen on it
[48:08] kind of buff it and polish it up with a
[48:10] little mcguire scriptural wax or
[48:12] something and kind of gets it on there a
[48:13] little bit and he tries to present it to
[48:15] go look at this can you believe this and
[48:17] you're like
[48:18] huh
[48:19] and and we're we're ogling something
[48:21] because he's just put a coat of wax on
[48:23] it that makes it seem like this is
[48:24] something we need to be worried about
[48:26] like this is a scriptural this is a
[48:28] scriptural issue and this is a biblical
[48:30] problem and this is an affront to the
[48:32] message of the hour
[48:34] and you have to take a step back and
[48:35] realize there's so many distractions
[48:38] so many lots pressing for our attention
[48:40] so many ishmaels trying to get inside
[48:42] get inside the covenant there's so many
[48:43] things that are trying to get in our way
[48:44] and we need to separate more than ever
[48:47] before from everything that is false
[48:49] everything that is formal everything
[48:50] that is called everything that is make
[48:52] belief
[48:53] and if you could take the principle that
[48:55] brother branham shared with us where he
[48:56] says you just agree with christ first
[48:59] let's not get so caught up in trying to
[49:01] figure out all the things that we want
[49:03] to hate and be anti let's just get so
[49:06] pro christ that all the anti takes care
[49:09] of itself
[49:10] just get so caught up in faith focused
[49:13] on faith focus on the word all abraham
[49:16] had to do to get lot to separate from
[49:17] him is just become very very narrowly
[49:20] focused upon the promise and lots just
[49:22] begin to back away and ishmael's begin
[49:24] to back away as you begin to get more
[49:26] forward and progressive about the
[49:28] promise
[49:30] that's what we need to do just get more
[49:32] focused on christ more centered upon the
[49:35] word of god and that it just has this
[49:37] way of balancing things out in our life
[49:41] i know things are hard i know things are
[49:43] difficult i know that we have our eyes
[49:45] maybe sometimes on the horizon for
[49:47] something different something better
[49:50] but be encouraged
[49:51] the more you focused on christ
[49:55] the sooner we will
[49:57] we will meet that pattern we will have
[49:59] that meeting in the air in that eastern
[50:01] sky as it were
[50:02] there will be this this climactic
[50:04] ascension into the presence of god
[50:06] forever more and it won't be by carnal
[50:08] religion it will be by faith a walk of
[50:10] faith
[50:11] i know i'm repeating some of the same
[50:13] patterns over and over and over again
[50:16] but i
[50:19] i trust
[50:20] that you're praying
[50:21] [Music]
[50:23] all the time
[50:24] for the lord to speak to you
[50:26] and you have power over these next few
[50:29] days to get so desperate with god
[50:31] that he can
[50:32] tailor a sermon specifically for you
[50:35] that may not even mention abraham at all
[50:40] why
[50:41] because you call on god for it
[50:43] because the word is meeting your needs i
[50:44] know that and i'm grateful for it but
[50:46] it's it's upon the hunger and the desire
[50:48] that you have in your heart for the
[50:49] things of god
[50:51] that motivates us and moves us
[50:53] we love you very much we're grateful for
[50:54] your presence tonight
[50:56] he's so precious to us
[50:58] his fellowship with the brother last
[50:59] night we were just by
[51:01] text messaging and
[51:03] just a precious presence that you could
[51:04] have just sharing scriptures and quotes
[51:06] and i shared something with him and he
[51:08] just said all the love of god it just
[51:10] speaks so much of the love of god and it
[51:12] was what i had in my heart as i shared
[51:14] it but i didn't explicitly say it i said
[51:16] that's what's being revealed to us saves
[51:19] the love of god in these things let's
[51:21] stand tonight
