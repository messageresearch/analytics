[0:01] luke chapter 6 start with verse 27 but i
[0:04] say unto you which here
[0:06] love your enemies
[0:08] do good to them which hate you do you
[0:10] believe that
[0:12] these are the words of jesus christ it's
[0:13] written in red so even the the nominal
[0:16] christians the denominational christians
[0:18] these are the ones that they ought to
[0:19] believe and practice it says bless them
[0:21] that curse you and pray for them which
[0:23] despitefully use you and unto him that
[0:26] smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also
[0:28] the other and him that taketh away the
[0:30] cloak forbid not to take thy coat also
[0:33] give to every man that asketh of thee
[0:34] and of him that taketh away thy goods
[0:36] ask them not again
[0:38] and as you would that men should do to
[0:40] you do ye also to them likewise for if
[0:43] you love them which love you what thank
[0:45] have you for sinners also love those
[0:47] that love them and if you do good to
[0:49] them which do good to you which thank
[0:51] have you for sinners also do even the
[0:53] same
[0:54] and if you lend to them of whom you hope
[0:55] to receive what thank have you
[0:58] presenters also lend to senator sinners
[1:00] to receive as much again
[1:02] but love ye your enemies and do good and
[1:04] lend hoping for nothing again and your
[1:06] word reward shall be great you shall be
[1:08] the children of the highest for he is
[1:10] kind unto the unthankful and to the evil
[1:14] be therefore merciful as your father
[1:16] also is merciful just to interject this
[1:19] in matthew chapter 5 where the full
[1:20] sermon on the mount has been given
[1:23] their beginning in matthew chapter 5.
[1:25] these same scriptures are uh same
[1:28] sayings are being said and as he says
[1:30] you'll be the children of the highest
[1:31] for he is kind and the unthankful and to
[1:33] the evil
[1:34] says be therefore perfect even as your
[1:36] father which is in heaven is perfect so
[1:38] these things are quite remarkable
[1:41] characteristics of a true believer be
[1:44] therefore merciful as your father also
[1:45] is merciful judge not ye shall not be
[1:48] judged condemn not ye shall not be
[1:49] condemned forgive and ye shall be
[1:51] forgiven give and it shall be given unto
[1:53] you good measure pressed down and shaken
[1:55] together and running over shall men give
[1:58] into your
[1:59] bosom for with the same measure that you
[2:01] met with all it shall be measured to you
[2:04] again
[2:04] and spake a parable and you spake a
[2:06] parable unto them can the blind lead the
[2:08] blind shall they not both fall into the
[2:11] ditch the disciple is not above his
[2:13] master but everyone that is perfect
[2:14] shall be as his master and why beholdest
[2:17] thou the mote that is in thy brother's
[2:19] eye but perceiveth not the beam that is
[2:21] in thine own eye those words relate to
[2:25] one being larger than the other and as
[2:27] the scripture would have it the one
[2:28] who's wanting to remove
[2:30] uh the obstruction the other person's
[2:32] eye has one it's even bigger than the
[2:35] one in the eye the one that he wants to
[2:36] remedy says and why beholdest thou the
[2:39] mote that is in thy brother's eye but
[2:40] perceives not the beam that is in thine
[2:42] own eye either how can't thou say to thy
[2:45] brother brother
[2:46] let me pull out the mote that is in
[2:48] thine eye when thou thyself behold us
[2:50] not the beam that is in thine own eye
[2:52] thou hypocrite cast out first the beam
[2:54] out of thine own eye and then shall
[2:56] shalt thou see clearly to pull the mote
[2:58] that is in thy brother's eye
[3:00] and power heads heavenly father as we
[3:02] are
[3:03] gathered together today and have
[3:05] worshiped and praised and lifted you up
[3:08] and exalted your name
[3:10] as we have laid aside the demands upon
[3:13] our time in our minds
[3:14] and even
[3:16] labored to set aside
[3:19] all the thoughts about the resources
[3:21] that are being used and the things that
[3:23] are scarce and
[3:25] how necessary it is to do certain things
[3:27] lord we're just washed now in this
[3:29] moment and we're looking to you to come
[3:32] to break the bread of life and to speak
[3:33] to us give us those things which we have
[3:36] need of
[3:37] and lord as you speak to us we'll we'll
[3:39] hear and we'll know that it is you so i
[3:41] pray father that you bless your people
[3:43] that you give them strength and courage
[3:45] today as we are living in a great time
[3:48] and the the most wonderful time to be
[3:50] alive as a christian it's also the
[3:51] darkest time this world has ever been in
[3:54] and there's another side to that lord
[3:55] and this law of contrast
[3:57] and i pray that you could just so get
[4:00] our attention today to pull away from
[4:03] all the nastiness of the world and all
[4:06] the darkness of politics and all the
[4:08] frivolity of society and not look at all
[4:11] those things and not look at this layla
[4:13] to see an age descending into chaos but
[4:16] lord just stay in step and continue to
[4:18] ascend
[4:20] and we just commit all things to you
[4:22] today desiring that you take control
[4:23] this part of the service for your glory
[4:25] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[4:27] pray amen
[4:29] god bless you you can be seated
[4:33] continue on the subject of barriers and
[4:36] boundaries there's been a lot that has
[4:37] been said to this point
[4:39] and i find myself reflecting on some of
[4:42] the initial services and realizing
[4:45] that i hope that we're not too far away
[4:47] from some of the foundational points
[4:49] that we've ministered on this
[4:50] because in a lot of ways it was kind of
[4:52] setting laying the foundation and
[4:54] setting the parameters and the
[4:55] boundaries
[4:56] of uh what we want to talk about so that
[4:59] we we realize uh where the where the
[5:02] emphasis is and where my burden is
[5:04] because i think there's maybe a lot of
[5:05] ways you could just cherry pick
[5:07] certain principles or just assume what
[5:09] direction i may be going and so i think
[5:11] it's very important
[5:12] to
[5:14] maybe keep in mind some of these other
[5:15] things that we've been ministering on
[5:16] today we're going to begin a subject on
[5:19] this same topic i want to finish some of
[5:21] the things on pride but also can
[5:23] segue into another part on setting
[5:26] limits
[5:27] and so we are going to be discussing on
[5:30] setting limits because a boundary is the
[5:32] limits of something that's something
[5:34] that determines the extent or the
[5:36] furthest point to reach of something uh
[5:38] barriers are obstacles to entry uh a
[5:41] boundary would be a wall a part of a
[5:43] boundary could be a door but then a
[5:45] barrier would be something put in front
[5:47] of that door
[5:48] to keep you from entering in so there's
[5:50] a difference between barriers and
[5:51] boundaries and today we're going to be
[5:53] using
[5:55] looking at the thought of setting limits
[5:57] and i do want to
[5:59] i don't know how much time we'll spend
[6:01] on this part but then in the future
[6:03] services lord willing talk about
[6:05] recognizing limits so we set limits but
[6:07] we also recognize limits our own
[6:09] limitations the limits of others and in
[6:12] the subject of recognizing limits and
[6:14] i've done a lot of been doing a lot of
[6:15] studying on what love ain't
[6:17] and uh and there's things that we have
[6:20] to even recognize uh certain things how
[6:22] love expresses itself how love responds
[6:25] and hopefully we'll touch on those
[6:26] things in recognizing limits and then
[6:28] hopefully
[6:29] have some time and inspiration to
[6:31] uh
[6:33] talk about addressing barriers in our
[6:35] lives and even other people's barriers
[6:36] and how that we ought to approach those
[6:38] so it kind of gives you a little bit of
[6:39] a road map of the things that we're
[6:41] wanting to look at
[6:42] but on uh the subject of
[6:45] barriers and boundaries we spent two
[6:47] services i believe it was on the pride
[6:49] paradox and we said it used this
[6:52] terminology if you'd use different
[6:53] terminology it's this is not a doctrine
[6:55] so i wouldn't object but we've talked
[6:57] about a good pride and a bad pride if
[6:59] you want to talk a good pride is
[7:00] confidence and self-respect or uh um
[7:03] faith and those different things that's
[7:05] certainly fine with me but we used it in
[7:06] the phrasing of a good pride and a bad
[7:09] pride
[7:10] and we've emphasized how if you have
[7:12] that bad pride or the the pride that
[7:14] we're most familiar with
[7:16] it doesn't respect boundaries and it's
[7:18] always laying barriers it's always
[7:20] setting traps and so it's something that
[7:21] we recognize that bad pride is gonna go
[7:24] right beyond barriers um and it's gonna
[7:26] it's gonna go right beyond boundaries
[7:28] it's gonna set barriers and it's a it's
[7:30] something that prohibits us from walking
[7:32] in the fullness of the character of
[7:34] christ
[7:35] now let's look at these last two verses
[7:37] of our text luke chapter 6
[7:40] verses 41 and 42 because i want to pick
[7:42] up where we were on wednesday night
[7:44] and and kind of wrap up some things on
[7:47] this dichotomy of a good pride and a bad
[7:49] pride jesus says and why beholdest thou
[7:51] the mote that is in thy brother's eye
[7:53] but perceiveth not the beam that is in
[7:55] thine owner you've got they've got a
[7:57] splinter
[7:58] you've got a stick and and he's saying
[8:00] why would you why are you doing this
[8:02] either how can't thou say to thy brother
[8:05] brother let me pull out the moat that is
[8:07] in the eye when thou
[8:08] thyself behold this not so now it's like
[8:11] you're not even aware you're not even
[8:13] conscious you're not even sensitive you
[8:14] don't even recognize the hypocrisy in
[8:17] this or the contradiction behold it's
[8:19] not the beam that is in thine own eye so
[8:21] there's a i don't know if it would be
[8:23] narcissism if it would just be
[8:25] cluelessness insensitivity some
[8:27] brashness he jesus relates it to
[8:30] hypocrisy which is rooted in pride he
[8:32] says thou hypocrite cast out first the
[8:35] beam out of thine own eye
[8:37] and then shalt thou see clearly to pull
[8:40] out the mote that is in thy brother's
[8:42] eyes
[8:43] in other words remove your barrier first
[8:45] recognize your obstacles your hindrances
[8:47] in some sense maybe even recognize your
[8:49] limitations then you can see yourself
[8:51] soberly then you can see yourself in
[8:54] such a way to know that this impediment
[8:56] in my own eye has been removed i can be
[8:58] more empathetic to my brother as i begin
[9:00] to remove his and you can also he says
[9:03] see clearly to pull out the mote that is
[9:05] in thy brother's eye so now you're
[9:07] actually seeing the right way you see
[9:08] the need the right way you can respond
[9:10] the right way and so it's really i know
[9:13] a lot of times the emphasis is on the
[9:14] hypocrisy
[9:16] of the person and the brashness and he
[9:18] is dealing with this negative pride
[9:21] but it's such a deeper principle and
[9:23] that's one thing i want to touch on is
[9:24] how he's talking about
[9:26] uh even in a healthy way recognizing
[9:29] yourself and in the healthy way helping
[9:31] others but as he refers to hypocrisy
[9:34] it's it's identifying this presumptive
[9:37] arrogance that we would call the bad
[9:38] pride or this nasty pride
[9:40] and we put it in these terms on
[9:42] wednesday
[9:43] that jesus is looking at it may have
[9:45] even been last sunday as well that jesus
[9:47] is saying take care of your problem
[9:49] first
[9:51] and and we recognize that this might
[9:52] seem to be kind of a counter intuitive
[9:54] to what paul teaches later look upon the
[9:56] needs of others and eternal life is
[9:58] living for others so we might think that
[10:00] instinctively i i don't worry about my
[10:02] own problems i don't have to take care
[10:04] of my own house and it doesn't matter
[10:05] what's wrong with me i'm just going to
[10:07] try to help everybody else and i'm going
[10:08] to help this person and in some ways
[10:12] or what jesus is identifying is just how
[10:14] much hypocrisy that is when you yourself
[10:17] are not taking the medicine you yourself
[10:19] are not obeying the word of god you
[10:20] yourself are not in the position that
[10:22] you ought to be in in order to be of
[10:24] service and of you so he's saying that
[10:25] you have to take care of your problem
[10:27] first
[10:28] and there are some other scriptures that
[10:30] are coming to mind that we've used over
[10:32] the last couple services but this one i
[10:34] think um
[10:35] identifies it it was in galatians where
[10:37] paul is uh
[10:39] in galatians we are using those
[10:40] scriptures
[10:42] and how paul is talking about good pride
[10:44] and bad pride in addressing those
[10:47] in order for us to be in the position to
[10:49] bear your own burden and bear you one
[10:51] another's burdens and so he had to deal
[10:53] with these two opposite sides of pride
[10:55] and so the solution to arrogance was a
[10:57] proper opinion of yourself the the
[10:59] solution to pride and this presumption
[11:02] and these and arrogance is to see
[11:04] yourself the right way
[11:05] not a negative opinion of yourself but a
[11:08] correct opinion
[11:10] not a bad opinion of yourself not a a an
[11:12] idea that you're broken and you're
[11:14] unable and you're no good but an honest
[11:16] opinion of yourself because jesus says
[11:18] you know why don't you get the beam out
[11:19] of your own eye because you're
[11:20] completely unfit and unable to help
[11:22] anybody in the first place you fool he
[11:24] says no just get the beam out of your
[11:25] eye then you'll be able to see clearly
[11:28] to pull the moat that is in thy
[11:29] brother's eye so there's not even rebuke
[11:31] of motive to want to remove the moat
[11:33] there's not even a rebuke of ability
[11:35] that you can't even do it he's just
[11:36] saying hey let's just first things first
[11:39] let's address things in the right order
[11:41] and i think we've touched on this
[11:42] last year through different um
[11:45] different services on how you have to do
[11:47] things in the correct order it wasn't
[11:49] talking about practice even i think it's
[11:51] like you have to do things first things
[11:52] have to be done the right way and we can
[11:55] look at all these things in the word of
[11:56] god that you must do that you must do
[11:58] but you have to recognize where you are
[11:59] and if you're a sinner repent first
[12:03] there's in order you have to repent
[12:04] first in order to do the other things to
[12:06] walk in the paces of god's word and so
[12:09] that's the solution uh to pride
[12:12] is to see yourself the right way
[12:15] and as jesus is talking about removing
[12:18] the mote that is in thy brother's eye
[12:22] he's talking about one getting rid of
[12:24] hypocrisy so there's a proper opinion of
[12:26] oneself there's a view
[12:28] as paul talks about it ye who are
[12:30] spiritual restore such a one who has a
[12:32] moat in their eye and and restore that
[12:34] one but do so in a spirit of meekness
[12:36] considering your own self this is the
[12:38] proper opinion of oneself so it's only
[12:42] safely in within the boundaries of what
[12:44] god has called us to be safely within
[12:46] god's borders that we can help others
[12:48] with their barriers
[12:50] if we're kind of out if we're drowning
[12:52] you're not going to save somebody else's
[12:53] drowning
[12:54] and so there has to be some position of
[12:56] safety and confidence to be able to help
[12:58] others
[12:59] and we use these uh these principles
[13:02] that pride is about self-control
[13:04] uh pride is about defining yourself in
[13:07] boundaries or about defining yourself
[13:09] and boundaries are about controlling
[13:10] yourself
[13:12] and we looked at how that self-control
[13:14] is
[13:15] at the heart of pride self-control is at
[13:16] the heart of setting boundaries
[13:19] and so if you are a victim of pride
[13:21] which we all are so we just need to be
[13:23] honest with ourselves it's something
[13:24] that we need to guard and they say that
[13:26] humility is a funny thing
[13:28] as soon as you think you have it you've
[13:29] lost it
[13:31] and so that's the that's kind of the the
[13:33] proper edge that we must always have is
[13:35] never oh you know if there's just one
[13:37] thing i'm so grateful for i'm so glad
[13:39] i'm humble
[13:40] like
[13:41] if i didn't have this humility i mean
[13:43] come on
[13:44] uh you you it's one of those things that
[13:46] you just kind of always have this edge
[13:47] lord keep me humble lord i want to
[13:48] humble myself
[13:50] because if you have a bad pride you
[13:51] can't help yourself you certainly can't
[13:53] help others
[13:54] and without a good pride you can't help
[13:56] yourself and you can't help others
[13:59] so just that little balance set with the
[14:01] good pride which is a healthy view of
[14:02] yourself a pride and christian virtue a
[14:05] dignity a respect a recognition of what
[14:07] you're called to a belief now your
[14:09] shoulders back i'm a son of god i'm an
[14:12] heir of a kingdom
[14:13] my confidence is in the election and the
[14:15] seed not the flesh as brother brown
[14:17] talks about how it's not the man that
[14:19] comes predestinated in the church book i
[14:21] believe it is but it's the seed and
[14:22] you're recognizing yeah i mean i
[14:24] inherited this body basically from my
[14:25] mom and dad and my nature from my mom
[14:27] and dad but by the new birth by election
[14:29] there's something of value there's
[14:30] something of worth that's making sense
[14:32] of that nature and nurture and bring
[14:34] this gold that god has ordained for me
[14:37] to come into perfection of and so
[14:39] there's you got to have a good pride
[14:41] now in matthew chapter 5 verses 12 to 16
[14:46] and it's just really i'm just kind of
[14:48] skimming over some just kind of touching
[14:50] the surface of it
[14:51] and i've been studying on
[14:54] the subject of salt
[14:55] and my goodness there's a lot a lot to
[14:58] be said
[14:59] on this and i just kind of want to brush
[15:01] over it maybe we'll come back to it
[15:02] later if the lord would inspire but i
[15:03] just want to stay very close to what
[15:05] he's quickened to me
[15:07] jesus says rejoice and be exceeding glad
[15:09] for great is your reward in heaven
[15:11] for so persecuted they the prophets
[15:13] which were before you you know what he's
[15:14] talking about we should rejoice and be
[15:16] seating gladden in the persecution
[15:19] and so he says ye are the salt of the
[15:22] earth but if the salt hath lost its
[15:24] savior wherewith shall it be salted how
[15:26] can it get it
[15:27] savor again if it's lost it it is then
[15:29] forth good for nothing but to be cast
[15:31] out and be trodden under foot of man so
[15:34] think of this because i want to come i
[15:35] don't necessarily want to spend a lot of
[15:37] time on this aspect but this image comes
[15:38] to mind that if something loses its
[15:41] power or the salt if it loses its
[15:43] efficacy if it no longer retains the
[15:46] qualities that make it valuable
[15:49] it becomes trodden under the feet of man
[15:52] so once it loses
[15:54] its uh characteristics then it's a
[15:57] doormat
[15:58] once you lose its characteristics it's
[15:59] stepped on it's despised it's rejected
[16:01] it's thought less of he says and verse
[16:04] 14 ye are the light of the world this is
[16:07] now salt and light these are two
[16:10] incredible elements that jesus is
[16:12] relating us to
[16:14] you are the salt of the earth and now
[16:15] the light of the world a city that is
[16:17] set on a hill cannot be hid neither do
[16:18] men light a candle and put it under a
[16:20] bushel but on a candlestick and it
[16:22] giveth light unto all that are in the
[16:24] house let your light so shine before men
[16:27] that they may see your good works and
[16:29] glorify your father which is in heaven
[16:31] what amazing characteristics that jesus
[16:34] wants us to align ourselves with and as
[16:37] we've been addressing a good pride and
[16:39] want us to think more healthy about
[16:41] ourselves and our calling and how see
[16:43] ourselves as god sees us and see others
[16:45] as god sees sees them
[16:48] to compare us to salt and light i mean
[16:51] he takes these elements and presents
[16:52] them to uh the believers say this is
[16:55] what you are you're the salt of the
[16:57] earth not just your neighborhood but of
[16:58] the earth you are the light of the world
[17:01] this is incredible position and calling
[17:03] that the believer has
[17:05] now just specifically on the subject of
[17:07] salt he says when salt becomes tasteless
[17:09] it means it's kind of lost its
[17:11] the root of the word is foolishness when
[17:13] it's become foolishness it's not serving
[17:15] its purpose anymore this is what it's
[17:17] good for when it loses its
[17:18] characteristics when it loses its taste
[17:21] not just its taste and its seasoning
[17:22] power but its preserving power
[17:25] and its power to hold away corruption
[17:27] and all the positive benefits of the
[17:29] that salt has is at that point it
[17:31] becomes worthless
[17:33] so if it's not demonstrating its power
[17:35] if it doesn't have if it's not
[17:37] expressing these essential uh the
[17:40] nutrients and the effect and the impact
[17:42] and there's so much that can be said
[17:43] just on the subject it says then it just
[17:46] is kind of good for nothing it's stepped
[17:47] under the feet of men men don't regard
[17:49] it in other words if salt didn't have
[17:50] its characteristics then man would just
[17:52] treat it like dirt
[17:56] so as the salt of the earth if i could
[17:58] express it this way we cannot lose
[18:01] uh we cannot fail to express our
[18:03] essential qualities
[18:05] we are the salt of the earth we have to
[18:06] have a confidence that i'm salt
[18:08] therefore i i come with certain
[18:10] characteristics i have certain qualities
[18:12] i have a certain power as salt then i'm
[18:15] seasoning something and paul uses that
[18:17] analogy later with our
[18:18] our speech if i'm salt then i can hold
[18:21] away corruption i can preserve if i'm if
[18:23] i'm salt i have a i have a certain
[18:25] benefit that comes with it and so we
[18:27] cannot lose our essential qualities we
[18:30] cannot fail to express uh what we are
[18:33] and
[18:34] and what god has made us
[18:36] brother adam says you just get salty the
[18:38] earth will get thirsty
[18:40] you live such in your neighborhood and
[18:41] around your people the people know say
[18:44] there's a real christian
[18:46] i tell you that if there ever was a
[18:48] christian there she is or there he is
[18:50] that's the way to be
[18:51] this is a kind of a theme that brother
[18:53] venom uses about getting salty just gets
[18:56] salty the earth gets thirsty and it
[18:58] seems to be maybe a little bit of a
[18:59] trick in some restaurants and where
[19:01] they're going to serve you a salty
[19:03] appetizer in order to kind of quicken
[19:04] this desire in this thirst and they
[19:07] that's one of the ideas i think behind a
[19:09] happy hour
[19:10] is that they want to serve you a lot of
[19:12] cheap salty snacks so you keep drinking
[19:14] a lot of ordering a lot of drinks and
[19:15] running your bill up because salt makes
[19:18] one thirsty or it causes you to crave
[19:20] and that's at least the the logic
[19:22] or a principle that's used about it but
[19:24] brother man is saying we have to be
[19:25] salty
[19:27] now salt is symbolic of a lot of things
[19:30] there's just so much imagery and meaning
[19:33] and so much to draw from when he says
[19:35] you are the salt of the earth and i
[19:37] think you yourselves can begin to think
[19:39] about this it's symbolic of many things
[19:41] it's used to preserve it's used for for
[19:43] health it's used for seasoning food and
[19:46] salt is even was regarded as a currency
[19:49] something that could be bartered for it
[19:50] was something that was just not readily
[19:52] available you there wasn't just all
[19:54] these different salts and salt and salt
[19:57] shakers everywhere
[19:58] it was something that could even be used
[20:00] as currency something could be used in
[20:02] exchange so salt had a lot of meaning
[20:05] in jesus day maybe more than it does now
[20:07] so it's a very powerful illusion not an
[20:09] illusion but an illusion to think of us
[20:11] in these terms of salt but there's two
[20:14] sides to salt
[20:17] you could be salty in a good way
[20:19] or you can be salty in a bad way
[20:23] it says you are the salt of the earth
[20:26] salty or salt has an interesting history
[20:28] of negative connotations
[20:30] it was even i found
[20:32] the etymology etymologist in me
[20:35] found that there was a time in the 16th
[20:37] and 17th century where salty was used to
[20:39] kind of express somebody who's a little
[20:40] bit risque and maybe a little bit too
[20:42] forward or inappropriately forward and
[20:45] aggressive in that way so it has there's
[20:47] a lot of negative connotations
[20:48] historically with the insulting
[20:51] uh maybe even we're more familiar with
[20:53] the use of something salty being angry
[20:55] or irritated or maybe a semen or
[20:58] something would be salty
[20:59] and he's tough or aggressive
[21:02] someone who's salty can be exceptionally
[21:03] bitter
[21:04] they're so they're bitter they're angry
[21:06] they're resentful they're upset
[21:08] and then some of the more fun uses of
[21:10] salty uh we might be familiar with uh in
[21:14] in the kind of the slaying like you're
[21:15] jumping salty right that's the way we
[21:17] use it back in philly as you're jumping
[21:19] salty it talks about somebody who's
[21:21] unexpectedly are suddenly angry man he
[21:23] was jumping salty and so it's a way that
[21:26] it's used even for someone who's kind of
[21:27] embarrassing or annoyed annoyed well
[21:29] they got all salty when i brought up the
[21:31] fact that this that happened and that
[21:32] happened so there's
[21:34] i mean you've said something oh he's
[21:36] salty i mean
[21:37] uh i mean the world would be like i know
[21:39] tell me about it right in a negative
[21:41] sense but then
[21:43] there's this you are the salt of the
[21:45] earth certain characteristics and
[21:46] attributes certain expression certain
[21:48] way you're carrying yourself an attitude
[21:50] that you have but it's used in a
[21:51] positive light
[21:53] and i
[21:54] i realized now i did bring it with me i
[21:56] have a few pages of notes here where
[21:58] brother branham in the question and
[22:00] answers in 1964 in august of 1964
[22:03] he uses his term be salty
[22:06] in response to several different
[22:08] questions i'll just maybe count them
[22:10] real quick
[22:12] i think six six
[22:14] seven questions
[22:16] he uses the the principle of b salt in
[22:19] response to him and the questions are
[22:21] very interesting very varied but they're
[22:22] mostly focusing on
[22:24] uh
[22:25] relationship where there's an
[22:26] unbelieving spouse and my husband uh
[22:29] wants to go to a church that i don't
[22:30] want to go to and he says
[22:32] well you're a christian
[22:34] go to church with your husband
[22:36] right he says go he says be salty
[22:39] and he talks about criticism and
[22:41] opposition and maybe
[22:43] going to other churches and in this
[22:45] context he's saying when he says be
[22:47] salty he's not saying well you should
[22:49] just be annoyed
[22:51] you should be jumping salty at your
[22:52] husband suddenly unexpectedly angry on
[22:55] sunday morning says honey let's go to
[22:57] church
[22:58] he's saying no you ought to be salty in
[23:00] the sense that jesus was saying that
[23:02] this is in a positive way this is in a
[23:04] seasoning way this is in making somebody
[23:06] thirsty i'm like wow maybe there's more
[23:08] to this belief more to their conviction
[23:10] than just this is the right church and
[23:12] this is the only doctrine and this is
[23:14] the truth
[23:15] in my eyes maybe there is a real life
[23:16] behind this and he's using kind of this
[23:18] phrasing of be salty here's one
[23:21] particular instance it's question 417. i
[23:23] have a friend who i love very much she's
[23:25] had some tapes and letters that i
[23:26] believe that have
[23:28] uh that have that i believe
[23:30] and it's kind of a fragment never talk
[23:32] to her so the way it kind of reads is
[23:34] she knows she's had some tapes and
[23:36] letters of what i believe but i've never
[23:37] talked to her mate really i guess i'm
[23:40] afraid of destroying her and losing her
[23:42] as a friend friendship what should i do
[23:45] and so here's somebody who that believes
[23:47] the message somebody else who doesn't
[23:49] believe the message
[23:50] how how do i navigate this
[23:53] because i don't want to destroy my
[23:54] friendship and brother brahms answer is
[23:56] well if you're not willing to destroy
[23:58] all your relationships for this message
[23:59] then you don't really believe the
[24:00] message
[24:02] and so i think it's really instructive
[24:03] so musicians if you could come i want
[24:05] you to chew on that
[24:06] uh no his answer is speak to her in love
[24:11] it's not like well any friendship that
[24:12] won't survive your testimony of this
[24:14] message isn't a friendship word of
[24:15] heaven he says speak during love and he
[24:17] says i believe i answered that and i
[24:18] think this is the last
[24:20] question he answers
[24:22] yes it's the last one reference where he
[24:24] talks about being salty so he says i
[24:26] believe i answered that yeah for the
[24:27] last uh three other services he had used
[24:30] this kind of language to express to
[24:32] someone who's in this difficult
[24:34] interpersonal relationship differences
[24:36] in beliefs and difference in actions and
[24:38] even one wife was being real aggressive
[24:40] to the husband well you don't even
[24:41] practice what you preach and he said
[24:43] well if you're not practicing what you
[24:44] preach maybe you deserve it
[24:46] it says but if she's maybe she's not
[24:48] that kind of person where she's mean he
[24:50] says i don't know he says but just be
[24:51] salty
[24:52] and so his answer is i believe i answer
[24:55] that
[24:55] but don't try to push anything on
[24:57] anybody
[25:00] i i want to go into it hopefully
[25:02] wednesday night on this use of force to
[25:05] accomplish things
[25:06] he says don't try to push anything on
[25:08] anybody just be salty
[25:11] just be salty they'll long to be like
[25:13] you remember jesus stood at the door and
[25:15] not
[25:17] the one who can just
[25:20] knock the door down do whatever he wants
[25:23] he knocked and so that we would permit
[25:25] and consent so he says don't try to push
[25:27] anything on anybody just be salty the
[25:29] long to be like you
[25:31] be salty be influential
[25:33] exert an influence be powerful but not
[25:36] too salty
[25:38] be salty but not too salty in other
[25:40] words don't uh don't get aggressive
[25:42] don't get pushy don't become overbearing
[25:46] there has to be this right balance and
[25:47] if people who cook will find this that
[25:50] something without salt you can
[25:51] immediately know
[25:53] something with too much salt you
[25:55] immediately know
[25:56] something with just the right kind of
[25:58] balance you won't even comment on it
[26:01] because what happens and you're like
[26:02] it's a little salty but maybe not too
[26:04] much but probably just a little bit past
[26:06] the line
[26:08] and so there is a there's this
[26:11] and i'm just using salt as another way
[26:13] of thinking about this line between a
[26:16] positive pride and a negative pride this
[26:19] perverse arrogant arrogance that you can
[26:21] carry
[26:22] and there is what is called a salt
[26:25] paradox
[26:26] um there is a lot of scholarship and
[26:28] research on it scientifically especially
[26:30] when it relates to nutrition
[26:32] and health
[26:33] and i'll just i'll just summarize it for
[26:36] you there's two different schools of
[26:37] thought we've heard a lot of it for many
[26:38] many years salt is bad get it out of
[26:40] your diet you're gonna die
[26:42] and then there's a lot of other research
[26:44] that comes around and says you know what
[26:46] that was a little bit misguided and so
[26:48] it's just like with msg i'm sure we're
[26:49] gonna find out that the lack of msg is
[26:52] the reason why kovid prevailed so much
[26:55] or something odd like that they're just
[26:56] going to come back around on you know
[26:58] what trans fat get as much as you can
[27:00] and oh okay so i can have olean chips
[27:02] again great
[27:04] um there's so many different things uh
[27:06] that back and forth within these uh
[27:09] academics but there's a lot of
[27:10] scholarship and research it's very
[27:12] pointed uh factually based and there's a
[27:14] lot of harmony accord that they're
[27:16] finding in their research and so i'll
[27:17] just summarize it for you you ready too
[27:20] much salt in your diet you can die
[27:23] not enough salt in your diet you can die
[27:26] right kind of similar to what happens
[27:27] when you have a funny pain and you want
[27:29] to google it
[27:30] let me just tell you what the final
[27:31] answer is you have cancer and you're
[27:33] going to die
[27:35] so don't even google it it's not even
[27:37] worth it
[27:38] no matter what it is that's weird my
[27:39] elbow hurts you have cancer and you're
[27:41] going to die
[27:43] and so when it comes to the salt paradox
[27:45] too much salt in your diet detrimental
[27:47] to health it could cause you to die but
[27:49] not enough salt because you're like
[27:50] salt's going to kill me i don't want any
[27:51] salt but hold on no not too far because
[27:54] if you don't have enough you're going to
[27:54] die
[27:56] and so it's assault paradox
[27:58] reminds me of pride
[28:00] too much pride you're going to fall
[28:03] not enough pride you'll never stand
[28:06] too much pride headed for destruction
[28:09] not enough pride you'll never recover
[28:10] from calamity you never overcome
[28:12] difficulty
[28:15] too much pride
[28:17] you'll never
[28:18] respect boundaries
[28:20] not enough pride you'll never defend
[28:22] boundaries
[28:23] too much pride every every every
[28:26] boundary's a barrier you're just gonna
[28:28] kick it down disrespect it and then
[28:29] throw barriers up in other people's way
[28:31] who are trying to possess their
[28:32] boundaries and
[28:34] and and there's so there's this give and
[28:35] take
[28:36] a healthy pride you're going to set your
[28:38] own boundaries you can defend your set
[28:40] your boundaries defend your boundaries
[28:42] and with the right kind of pride and
[28:43] healthy pride just the right amount of
[28:44] pride you're going to be have this uh
[28:47] ambition to overcome barriers
[28:49] instead of oh it's in my way i don't
[28:51] know what i'm going to do you this the
[28:52] kind of perseverance that grit the
[28:54] determination for the brandon identifies
[28:56] to be persistent that that's the kind of
[28:58] confidence i believe in what i'm doing i
[28:59] believe there's fruits and the results
[29:01] and i'm going to press through this i'm
[29:03] going to overcome it and so too much
[29:04] pride you're going to fall not enough
[29:06] pride you'll never
[29:08] walk in the place that you want to
[29:10] brother man says salt is the savor if it
[29:12] contacts there has to be contact you
[29:14] just be salty the world will get thirsty
[29:17] god give us men and women who are real
[29:19] men and women who stand
[29:21] gallantly
[29:23] to stand gallantly
[29:25] uh maybe put another way shoulders back
[29:27] chin up confidently
[29:30] and there's there's this idea of not uh
[29:32] of not somebody gloating and sticking
[29:35] their nose up and looking down on
[29:36] everybody else but somebody who's got
[29:38] some confidence in who they are and what
[29:39] god's calling them to be
[29:41] and we touched on it just briefly and
[29:43] making comments that when the bible says
[29:44] the meek shall inherit the earth
[29:46] and we think in terms of meekness that
[29:48] this is just people who are broken and
[29:50] impoverished and have nothing going for
[29:52] them or their pushovers and they never
[29:55] want to say anything and they always
[29:56] give up in a fight and they always run
[29:58] away when accosted and never willing to
[30:00] uh confront anything and can't handle
[30:03] contention and there's a way that we
[30:04] just describe meek people as weak people
[30:07] but the true idea of meekness is to have
[30:10] the power to force but not use it
[30:13] i mean that's what meekness means it
[30:14] just means like hey i could if i want to
[30:18] but i won't
[30:19] and that's the beautiful part of the
[30:21] meek someone who has
[30:23] and think of it this way in the language
[30:24] that jesus is using
[30:26] the meek are those who if they wanted to
[30:28] by force could take the earth
[30:31] and since they don't they'll inherit the
[30:33] earth
[30:35] you can take it by force you can take
[30:36] about opportunity and privilege you can
[30:38] do it by power but instead of doing it
[30:40] that way you'll inherit it the right way
[30:42] it's accomplishing the right thing the
[30:44] right way
[30:45] and so in the message it becometh us to
[30:47] fulfill all righteousness
[30:49] the other man says and after you've made
[30:50] a confession you must stay with your
[30:52] confession that's right it's behooving
[30:54] you becoming as a christian as a
[30:56] believer to stay with your conviction
[30:59] don't let the devil push you off here
[31:01] and there
[31:03] they said listen a christian who stands
[31:05] gallantly salt
[31:07] has a characteristic it's something
[31:09] that's strong and something that
[31:10] perseveres and something that can uh
[31:13] hold things at bay in terms of its uh
[31:16] power to preserve and keep corruption
[31:18] from setting in
[31:19] you have a position to call him to hold
[31:21] things off to fend things off he says
[31:24] don't let the devil
[31:26] push you off here and there you're
[31:28] always mudded up
[31:30] you're always off the main road don't
[31:31] let people do this to you
[31:33] don't let circumstance do this to you
[31:35] don't let um others the devil do this to
[31:37] you says you're always in and out that's
[31:39] the way you can't stay nowhere that's
[31:41] the reason why you can't it's because
[31:43] you're being pushed over you're being
[31:44] tossed to and fro you're not standing by
[31:46] your conviction you're not standing
[31:47] galilee you're not being salty in a
[31:50] gallant way you're you're not holding
[31:52] this meekness and it's truth he says you
[31:55] can't have confidence in yourself
[31:59] interesting
[32:01] we can have a look we can have a fun
[32:02] discussion at lunch if we just want to
[32:05] cabbage down on one statement you should
[32:06] have no confidence in the flesh right
[32:08] like okay that's our marching orders and
[32:10] then all of a sudden other scriptures
[32:11] and statements start coming up hmm
[32:14] okay
[32:15] what does that mean then what do we do
[32:17] with this
[32:19] and so so this idea of being confident
[32:21] in yourself yeah there's a real
[32:22] nastiness to it right
[32:24] there's a real uh there's a real
[32:26] negativity that can be associated with
[32:28] it but remember that scarecrows are used
[32:31] to keep crows away from good stuff
[32:35] it's used to cause fear and listen if i
[32:37] could say this i've alluded to it
[32:39] there are so many beautiful truths about
[32:41] the opening of the word the third pool
[32:43] the seventh seal the seven thunders the
[32:45] open the revealing of the mysteries the
[32:46] things that have transpired in this
[32:48] message and the devil has been really
[32:50] good at getting a lot of scarecrows to
[32:52] run out and take the lead on what all
[32:54] those things are and what they mean and
[32:56] a lot of bad characteristics and conduct
[32:58] associated with it so some people like
[33:00] you know what i don't even want to mess
[33:01] with it because look at all the nonsense
[33:03] that's associated with it and that's
[33:05] scaring you away
[33:07] from these beautiful things that have
[33:09] happened in the word of god and that are
[33:10] available to us as the members of the
[33:12] bride and so we can have such a negative
[33:14] connotation about confidence and we're
[33:16] like well i don't have any confidence in
[33:17] anything or anyone it's like well there
[33:20] is a right way that you can have
[33:21] confidence he says you can't have
[33:23] confidence in yourself so just know
[33:25] there's a healthy way to do that or no
[33:27] one can have confidence in you
[33:31] he says you've got to stand and when
[33:33] you've done all you can do to stand this
[33:35] illusion to ephesians 6 then stand just
[33:37] keep on standing
[33:41] something beautiful about knowing your
[33:42] worth
[33:45] not inflating or overestimating what
[33:47] you're worth but knowing your true value
[33:50] paul was we've emphasized this in a lot
[33:52] of different ways
[33:53] especially over the last in this subject
[33:55] of barriers and boundaries that i need
[33:57] to understand the measure of faith that
[33:59] has been given to me because i have one
[34:01] in any measure is worth value
[34:05] right think of it it's it you we say oh
[34:07] well jesus had it without measure we
[34:09] have it by measure that in no way was
[34:11] meant to limit you
[34:13] it's just to understand dispensation
[34:15] it's to understand uh expression and
[34:17] manifestation it's not to take away from
[34:19] you anything it's you have to recognize
[34:21] no know yourself
[34:24] recognize yourself jesus was who he was
[34:27] not because of circumstances and rumors
[34:29] and because he didn't have anything but
[34:31] jesus knew perfectly who he was
[34:34] and that's what caused him to overcome
[34:36] and how did he overcome by the word and
[34:38] humility
[34:41] so in this
[34:43] you can't have confidence yourself and
[34:44] no one can have confidence in you you've
[34:46] got to take care of yourself
[34:48] think of yourself in the right way
[34:50] and know your value know your work take
[34:52] care of yourself and think of yourself
[34:54] as someone who has the responsibility of
[34:56] caring for someone else and thinking
[34:57] about your thinking about their needs
[34:59] because it's like what the bible says
[35:01] the bible says look not upon your own
[35:03] needs but the needs of others
[35:05] so it's kind of making us realize i need
[35:06] to think of myself the right way
[35:09] and regard the value that i have because
[35:11] i've been given the responsibility to
[35:14] look on the needs of others
[35:16] right
[35:17] so i i need to i need to draw from this
[35:20] this resource of scripture that so
[35:22] beautifully lays out and we recognize it
[35:24] even we say well let this mind be in you
[35:26] it's this mind of christ that we begin
[35:28] to take on and accept an assent to and
[35:31] receive and let to let it loose in our
[35:33] lives is from this position of
[35:34] acceptance and belonging and oneness
[35:36] with the father and i know my value i'm
[35:39] taking care of myself i'm thinking the
[35:41] right way about myself and with this
[35:43] healthy opinion of myself i realize i'm
[35:45] going to think of myself as one who's
[35:47] been given the responsibility to look on
[35:49] the needs of others
[35:52] because
[35:52] why why would we be called to to look
[35:55] upon the needs of others and to bear one
[35:57] another's burdens
[35:59] if you haven't been gifted to do it
[36:02] if you're not going to be given the op
[36:04] the power and opportunity to do it so
[36:06] you start changing i'm not just somebody
[36:08] who's got nothing to add and i'm just
[36:09] looking for an opportunity to kind of
[36:10] trick everybody right you're not an
[36:13] imposter hanging out in the hospital
[36:14] pretending to be a doctor just waiting
[36:16] for the chance to practice your
[36:18] your wares on an unsuspecting patient
[36:21] you've got the goods you've got the
[36:22] calling it's something inside of us and
[36:24] however that strikes home to you we've
[36:26] got to start thinking about ourselves
[36:27] the right way in living the right way is
[36:30] one who god wants to use for the right
[36:32] things
[36:36] now i realize had i just maybe expressed
[36:39] and shared a little bit more on salt we
[36:40] could have just been finished and gone
[36:41] to an early lunch
[36:43] but i wanted this is uh
[36:45] the
[36:46] we're moving from the thought of the
[36:47] pride paradox now into setting limits
[36:50] it's very important though to have this
[36:52] fresh in our minds these things here i
[36:53] just expressed here are going to come
[36:55] back around as we move on this morning
[36:58] setting limits
[36:59] setting limits is
[37:01] um
[37:02] what i'd like to do by the word of god
[37:04] and especially drawn so much from the
[37:05] message of the hour it's so beautiful
[37:08] people want to take brother branham as
[37:09] just some sort of paint tote carry
[37:11] backwoods you know kentuckian
[37:13] you know who uh wasn't very graceful or
[37:16] educated or well studied all right fine
[37:19] listen what he had to
[37:20] say so profoundly beautiful and relevant
[37:23] so deep so instructive touching on every
[37:26] element he's not approaching these
[37:28] things academically he's not approaching
[37:30] these things with psychology he's
[37:32] approaching from the word of god and it
[37:33] has the answer to every human behavior
[37:38] every human thought and idea so we're
[37:40] wanting to take the word of god and
[37:41] address myths
[37:42] regarding christian virtues
[37:45] there's myths about christian virtues
[37:47] that actually are counterproductive to
[37:49] christian virtue
[37:51] there's ways that we approach church
[37:52] that's counterproductive to what church
[37:54] ought to be there's myths even about
[37:56] personal liberty that are
[37:58] counterproductive to personal liberty
[37:59] there's a way that we want to define
[38:01] personal liberty in such a way where it
[38:02] takes away our liberty
[38:04] and so i want to
[38:06] uh as we've been saying fi tapping into
[38:09] the
[38:10] the the boundless love of god and the
[38:12] limitless power of god by identifying
[38:14] the boundaries of god yes it's a paradox
[38:16] but we have we can only fully understand
[38:19] and appreciate personal liberty when we
[38:21] recognize personal limitations
[38:25] and experience the richness of the
[38:26] relationships that god has placed in us
[38:28] in when we recognize our limitations and
[38:31] respect the limitations of others so
[38:32] there's just so much in this
[38:35] that i feel overwhelmed that i'm looking
[38:37] at something and i'm looking at all this
[38:39] all these things that are just being
[38:41] quickened to me from the word of god and
[38:42] then i only have just a moment to try to
[38:44] describe you what i'm seeing and so if
[38:46] you could be very patient with me this
[38:48] is just one you're just getting one
[38:49] slice
[38:50] and there's so much that you could the
[38:52] word of god can things the holy spirit
[38:54] can bring into view to make it a perfect
[38:55] picture so if something seems i don't
[38:57] know you just let god bring the rest
[38:59] into the view make it relevant for you
[39:03] and i have been very
[39:05] very burdened heavily
[39:07] on this subject to the point to where i
[39:09] wrestled with
[39:11] uh
[39:12] the simplicity of it and how easy it
[39:15] might be for someone to kind of escape
[39:17] just how pertinent it is to the bride's
[39:19] ministry and how pertinent it is to the
[39:21] bride's advocacy and how pertinent it is
[39:24] to understanding and walking fully in
[39:27] the oneness that we're to have with the
[39:28] word
[39:30] and so one thing that has been very real
[39:32] to me in the commission that god gave me
[39:34] in coming here
[39:36] uh very direct very scriptural a very
[39:39] distinct my wife and i are very clear in
[39:41] the vision that god has given us in
[39:42] coming here
[39:44] and i recognize that the things that i'm
[39:45] ministering are necessary in order to
[39:47] heal us
[39:48] necessary to set us free
[39:51] and there are
[39:53] so many different negative experiences
[39:55] that some of us have had there's so many
[39:57] i'm not saying this is for everybody so
[39:58] i'm not trying to put something on you
[39:59] oh he says i need healing oh he says i
[40:01] need to be free i'm not saying that
[40:03] about any all of us just
[40:06] as a need that god wants to meet
[40:08] there's been so much an abuse and
[40:10] bondage
[40:12] uh
[40:13] that
[40:14] many of us have experienced and negative
[40:18] dynamic mechanics and even dynamics in
[40:20] churches that have warped our
[40:22] experiences and so we're even not even
[40:26] we're not even conscious anymore
[40:28] of
[40:29] the of of how we really relate to one
[40:32] another and how we look at church and
[40:33] ministry and the word of god we're not
[40:35] even we're not even viewing the message
[40:37] the right way
[40:38] because so much of it begins to take on
[40:41] this veneer and this facade of humanity
[40:44] and personality and so much emphasis is
[40:46] are on natural things and personal
[40:49] things and politics
[40:50] we're never really getting past the
[40:52] human part and getting into the divine
[40:54] part
[40:55] and the christ part and and we're not
[40:58] even recognizing that that's what we're
[40:59] relating to and that's what's really
[41:00] binding our experiences and holding all
[41:02] of us together and there's a lot of
[41:04] things that we go through that then
[41:05] maybe some people get a little bit more
[41:07] aware of that like oh my goodness look
[41:09] this is what it is it's human it's
[41:10] political there's so much pretense
[41:12] there's so much that's wrong and they're
[41:14] turned off by it because now what that
[41:16] what they're finally recognizing and
[41:18] perceiving is the hypocrisy of it
[41:21] and the and how this principle is
[41:23] contrary to this one and this behavior
[41:24] is hypocritical and inconsistent with
[41:27] this teaching and so what they begin to
[41:29] do is their perception begins to get
[41:30] warped and they're like you know what
[41:31] there's nothing to this
[41:34] because they think what they're seeing
[41:35] is what it is but they're not really
[41:36] seeing it
[41:38] and the bible christianity this message
[41:40] has been weaponized to cage people
[41:43] it has been weaponized to to bind people
[41:45] by fear and control
[41:47] and people are holding to things and
[41:50] fearful of doing things and fearful of
[41:54] expressing something or overcoming or
[41:56] making a decision and they're bound and
[41:58] they think that oh well this is this is
[42:00] right to to uh kind of bind to myself
[42:03] this is right to limit myself this is
[42:05] right to be controlled and to beat my
[42:07] body and hold myself into subjection and
[42:09] what you're operating is under these
[42:11] negative dynamics instead of operating
[42:13] under faith
[42:14] because at the root and at the core
[42:16] christianity is believing god's word
[42:19] it's trust it's faithfulness it's it's
[42:22] this uh
[42:23] an unwavering commitment to the to jesus
[42:26] christ that's what faith is and all
[42:28] these other things begin to muddy up the
[42:29] water and we find ourselves living in
[42:31] this tension between denial and desire
[42:35] and i'm not talking about this
[42:37] this tension of well i really desire um
[42:41] a joint right now but i'm going to deny
[42:43] myself the joint there's this there's
[42:46] this um
[42:47] dynamic
[42:48] i just uh
[42:50] modality or way of thinking a way of
[42:52] processing things a way of acting
[42:54] to where it fits and i'm just really i
[42:57] just find i'm so encouraged by the the
[42:59] the liberty by your your openness today
[43:02] and you're just pulling the word of god
[43:04] i can just i can just speak freely and i
[43:06] love this
[43:08] that we we take this idea of
[43:11] and i'm coming right to it in
[43:13] in luke chapter six
[43:15] and
[43:16] uh mark chapter eight wanting to come
[43:18] back to that so this is just beautiful
[43:20] kind of setting this up
[43:22] we've experienced like the proper
[43:24] application
[43:26] of denying an evil desire
[43:29] of of desiring something evil
[43:31] and then by conviction by faith
[43:35] denying it
[43:36] and so is we have that we have that uh
[43:40] that experience and we recognize that
[43:42] process that there's things that you can
[43:44] be tempted by and i have to say no to it
[43:46] and we see that in the word of god and
[43:48] we've experienced it but then we take
[43:50] that same instinct
[43:52] and it can be used against us when we
[43:54] have a righteous desire and a righteous
[43:57] leading of god
[43:59] and we find ourselves denying it
[44:02] because we've just that's what we're
[44:03] used to
[44:04] we're just used to the pastor telling us
[44:06] what to do we're just used to being told
[44:08] this is the only church that's got the
[44:10] truth we've been told that if you leave
[44:12] you won't have this we've been told that
[44:13] if you believe something else then you
[44:14] don't believe the message and we have
[44:16] and there's just a lot i can keep going
[44:17] on and on and on in all other ways that
[44:19] we find ourselves limiting our growth in
[44:21] the word of god and but we i i'm longing
[44:25] for more i sense that there's got to be
[44:26] something more to this and i feel that
[44:29] god is leading into more beautiful areas
[44:30] into the message of god and the word is
[44:32] opening up to me but all of a sudden you
[44:34] find yourself being told just deny
[44:36] yourself we've seen where that's gone or
[44:38] we just deny yourself you just need to
[44:40] stick with this just deny yourself
[44:41] because you're going out on a limb and
[44:43] we live in that tension
[44:47] and there is a if i could find myself
[44:49] again in the salt paradox and the pride
[44:51] paradox there's a tension paradox too
[44:54] much is a bad thing not enough is a bad
[44:56] thing
[44:57] but brother lucas did a um a youth
[44:59] meeting on stress
[45:02] it was very beautiful to identify and he
[45:04] used some natural examples of how
[45:06] important it is to have certain tension
[45:08] in certain stressors you've got to have
[45:09] that
[45:10] but then there's a there's a tipping
[45:12] point to that and we don't want to walk
[45:14] forward in the word of god and god is
[45:15] wanting to lead us into greater things
[45:17] and we have a desire but then we begin
[45:19] to repress that and hold it back
[45:22] is that something that's uh you can
[45:25] understand and relate to
[45:27] now in luke chapter 6 and i'm going to
[45:29] go ahead and read verses 27 to 36 we've
[45:32] already
[45:33] looked at verses 41 and 42 but i say
[45:35] unto you which here love your enemies do
[45:37] good to them which hate you
[45:39] bless them that curse you and pray for
[45:40] them which despitefully use you
[45:42] and unto him that smiteth thee on the
[45:44] one cheek offer also the other
[45:48] and sorry let's just how do we all
[45:50] envision that right
[45:52] boom and you're kind of like i think you
[45:55] need to get this one too right that's
[45:56] the way that's the way it sounds
[45:58] so he says and take and him that take
[46:01] away thy cloak forbid him not to take
[46:03] thy coat also
[46:04] give to every man that asketh of thee
[46:06] and of him that taketh away thy goods
[46:08] ask them not again he says give and lend
[46:11] without expecting anything in return and
[46:13] as ye would that men should do to you do
[46:16] ye also to them likewise
[46:19] i want to touch on this
[46:23] later
[46:25] but the reason why
[46:27] we allow others to treat ourselves
[46:29] poorly
[46:30] is because we treat ourselves so poorly
[46:34] there's there's there's a lot there
[46:37] and so it says as you would that men
[46:38] should do to you do ye also to them
[46:41] likewise do unto others as you would
[46:43] have them do unto you
[46:44] and sometimes we're acting
[46:47] towards others
[46:48] in a way that we do to ourselves
[46:51] right
[46:55] for if you love them which love you what
[46:56] thank have you and i i find for time's
[46:58] sake i just want to
[47:00] i want to skip to verse 35 he's saying
[47:02] there's got to be a higher character
[47:04] that we operate by because the world
[47:06] will appreciate those who appreciate
[47:07] them and the world will be happy to give
[47:08] to somebody who's going to give in
[47:09] return and the world can easily love
[47:11] somebody who loves them but where's the
[47:13] divinity where's the deity where's the
[47:14] christ it says but love your enemies and
[47:16] do good and lend hoping for nothing
[47:18] again and your reward shall be great and
[47:19] you shall be the children of the highest
[47:21] as we mentioned before this similar way
[47:24] be therefore perfect
[47:26] be merciful as your father is merciful
[47:29] now with this image in mind of love your
[47:31] enemies
[47:32] jesus is teaching on how we treat others
[47:36] and and and so we ought to treat others
[47:38] the right way do as you would that men
[47:40] should do to you and what you think you
[47:42] deserve and what you think is right and
[47:44] appropriate for yourself
[47:46] do that to other people so you recognize
[47:48] how damaging it would be
[47:51] if you don't have the proper opinion of
[47:53] self
[47:54] right
[47:55] then how can you have a proper opinion
[47:57] of other people
[47:59] well i think it's fine if people violate
[48:00] my piece so it's going to violate your
[48:02] peace right
[48:04] so there's a real richness to this and
[48:06] because we all we automatically think oh
[48:08] wouldn't you want a million dollars so
[48:09] give a million dollars to somebody else
[48:11] and you know do unto others as you would
[48:12] have them duty to praise you and lift
[48:14] you up and encourage you and
[48:16] and we think of it only in the positive
[48:17] sense but you realize there's a darkness
[48:19] to this
[48:20] that that whether if you think this way
[48:22] you've got to you've got to have a uh
[48:25] you got to break out of this negative
[48:27] mindset and as we look at these things
[48:29] you strike you on the cheek turn the
[48:31] other one if someone takes sushi for
[48:33] your cloak give them your coat also we
[48:36] can read this to mean you have to stay
[48:38] very very close to me it's 11 17. i'll
[48:40] tell you the time so you don't have to
[48:41] look you don't have to get all
[48:46] you know
[48:47] uh i can just tell you it's 11 17.
[48:50] uh don't ask me what time it is um if
[48:52] you need to know maybe you can just pull
[48:54] on that gift and i'll tell you future
[48:56] but it's 11 17.
[48:57] we could read this you have to be very
[48:59] very careful here we could read this
[49:02] to mean that we must welcome all
[49:04] offenses
[49:07] that we should just be willing to give
[49:08] everything away and expect nothing in
[49:10] return that jesus oh well just you know
[49:12] i should i can let you borrow money
[49:14] brother aaron can i borrow 100 bucks and
[49:16] that i should just be fine and happy if
[49:18] i promise i'll pay you back be happy if
[49:19] you never pay me back
[49:21] and there's a way that we begin to
[49:22] process this we're just oh we've got to
[49:24] be fine with being the doormat i got to
[49:25] be fine with being taken advantage of
[49:27] and that we therefore offer ourselves to
[49:30] be trodden under the foot of man
[49:32] that we that we ought to just put
[49:34] ourselves in position to always be taken
[49:37] advantage of because this is what
[49:38] christians do
[49:40] and and isn't it amazing how
[49:42] you're always the christian that has to
[49:44] take the high road not the other
[49:45] christian you're talking to
[49:47] well why don't you just humble yourself
[49:48] and forgive it's like
[49:53] okay
[49:55] are you
[49:56] am i the only christian in this
[49:57] conversation
[49:58] i told my wife one time she was dealing
[50:00] with somebody and this is somebody you
[50:02] know twice her age and she got off the
[50:04] phone i said honey you were the adult in
[50:05] that conversation
[50:07] you're the only adult in that
[50:08] conversation
[50:09] and uh and just to that point of what we
[50:11] expect i remember one time
[50:14] i was i had a client who had a
[50:16] particular
[50:17] need that they needed some
[50:19] representation on and it was just kind
[50:20] of a new relationship and it was a
[50:22] student from a seminary there's a number
[50:24] of uh students from the seminar that
[50:25] would do these real estate deals and uh
[50:28] they needed some representation and so
[50:30] we talked about it was gonna be and
[50:31] we're talking about what needed to be
[50:32] done and so it's time for me to tell
[50:33] what my fee would be and he said also
[50:35] remember he said i'm a christian he knew
[50:37] i was a christian who has a ministry
[50:39] says so i'm a christian so
[50:41] you know adjust accordingly and i just
[50:44] said praise god praise god
[50:46] i'm so glad to finally
[50:48] have a brother who's willing to pay me
[50:51] more for my services since i'm a
[50:52] christian
[51:02] for too many people it's a one-way
[51:03] street
[51:06] we know that christian characters
[51:08] consider it we know that christian
[51:09] character is compassionate
[51:12] but we also know that there's boundaries
[51:14] to christian character and it's always
[51:16] the word of god as i've been studied on
[51:18] love
[51:19] uh
[51:20] love is not what you think it is
[51:23] if god is love and god is his word then
[51:24] love has to operate strictly within the
[51:27] parameters of the word of god
[51:29] and it's not it doesn't adjust itself to
[51:31] what's sappy and syrupy and what's all
[51:34] warm fuzzy when he says love your
[51:36] enemies it doesn't mean like oh
[51:37] isn't he just i just want to pinch his
[51:40] cheeks it's not a warm fuzzy feeling
[51:42] when you love your enemies right but we
[51:44] think that's what it means
[51:45] you got to really have a warm fuzzy
[51:47] feeling about the people who hate you
[51:49] and we're like not gonna happen
[51:51] right never gonna have a warm fuzzy
[51:52] feeling about some people but i gotta
[51:54] love them
[51:57] right
[51:58] so maybe love's not what we think it is
[52:00] contrary to dc talk
[52:03] love isn't a verb always
[52:06] it's not the verb they're thinking about
[52:07] i don't know what they're thinking about
[52:10] the christian character is forgiving
[52:13] self-sacrificing these are the truths of
[52:15] the word of god this is the red letter
[52:16] this is what paul taught but yet there's
[52:18] there's a question i want to pose in
[52:20] light of luke chapter six are there
[52:22] boundaries of safe boundaries for a
[52:23] christian
[52:25] is jesus just kind of saying hey here
[52:27] you go be rip to shreds taking advantage
[52:29] of whatever they want to do to you just
[52:31] let them do do because that's what
[52:32] christians do let me ask you this are
[52:34] there limits or parameters within is
[52:36] there a better way of understanding luke
[52:38] chapter six and the things that are
[52:39] being said here and even the beatitudes
[52:41] and these things that jesus is listening
[52:43] who we just don't take this far extreme
[52:45] without any kind of limit without any
[52:46] context or understanding just like well
[52:48] you're a christian you should just allow
[52:50] yourself to be taken advantage of and so
[52:52] you just have to subject yourself to
[52:54] abuse and torment and negativity and
[52:56] harshness and ridicule and
[52:59] and all sorts of things that are
[53:00] damaging to your faith
[53:02] right but you just have to go you just
[53:04] have to do it
[53:05] in mark chapter 8 verses 34 and 35 we
[53:08] use this wednesday night and when he had
[53:09] called the people unto him with his
[53:10] disciples also he said to them whosoever
[53:13] will come after me let him deny himself
[53:16] and take up his cross and follow me
[53:19] i love how himself
[53:21] yourself is
[53:23] is united with the cross and that's
[53:24] where we find ourselves in union with
[53:26] christ the cross for whosoever will save
[53:28] his life shall lose it so immediately
[53:30] again think well whoever's trying to
[53:31] preserve themselves and save their lives
[53:33] and
[53:33] and protect it is going to lose it but
[53:35] whosoever shall lose his life for my
[53:38] sake and the gospels the same shall save
[53:40] it
[53:41] so it's not just a matter of losing
[53:43] yourself and letting yourself go and not
[53:44] caring and being abased at every
[53:46] opportunity and subjecting yourself to
[53:48] whatever happens in the whims of people
[53:50] and the evils that can be perpetuated
[53:52] and say well i'm not going to protect
[53:53] myself because if i try to save my life
[53:55] i try to protect myself i try to protect
[53:57] my spirit and set up my defenses then
[53:59] i'm just going to lose it
[54:01] but he says if you will then lose your
[54:04] life for the gospel sake and for the
[54:06] sake of christ so there's a way that he
[54:08] wants you to abandon things
[54:10] there's context for it there's a
[54:12] boundary for the losing of your life he
[54:14] says it's go that's going to be saved
[54:16] and this self-denial this denial of self
[54:18] he talked about and i didn't mean to get
[54:20] into it because it's a subject in itself
[54:22] the tension between desire and denial
[54:25] the self-denial that jesus mentions let
[54:28] him deny himself
[54:30] he joins it with individual choice
[54:33] you recognize that let him deny himself
[54:36] and take up his cross
[54:38] it's his cross
[54:40] so the denial of self to let him deny
[54:43] himself has a richer meaning than just
[54:45] some sort of well i've got nothing i've
[54:47] got no choice i'm not my own anymore uh
[54:50] there's no autonomy here he's saying let
[54:51] him deny himself and he joins it with
[54:53] the individual choice to take up your
[54:55] personal cross so there's still some
[54:57] recognition of self
[54:59] there's some denying of yourself but
[55:01] then there's also some deeper
[55:03] understanding that i have a burden i
[55:05] have a task i have a responsibility and
[55:07] i'm going to take up this cross and take
[55:10] up this cross my responsibility my task
[55:12] my burden my boundaries my who i am i'm
[55:15] going to deny myself anything that would
[55:17] be a barrier to following christ any
[55:20] ambition any idea any nature and nurture
[55:22] contrary to what he's called me to do
[55:24] but i still have a choice a personal
[55:26] choice to take up my cross and follow
[55:28] him and therein lies your true identity
[55:33] and self-denial is a dot not a doctrine
[55:35] of self-hatred
[55:37] there's this thing this i know that
[55:38] we're not living in the uh
[55:40] the mental ages is that what we called
[55:42] it
[55:43] uh the medieval ages uh the middle ages
[55:45] and the times where there was like this
[55:47] uh even as luther wrestled with his sins
[55:51] he inflicted upon himself in his penance
[55:54] physical pain
[55:55] and and i just used luther as an example
[55:57] because it's one personal testimony i've
[55:59] read but then this ah there's the self
[56:02] beating and and
[56:03] and causing pain and inflicting says why
[56:06] it's this in this sense of i i need to
[56:09] feel i need to express repentance i need
[56:11] to show remorse i need to express just
[56:13] how horrible i am and and foul i am and
[56:16] we may have moved beyond the physical
[56:19] flogging or the the making myself
[56:21] physically uncomfortable but they're
[56:22] still like the ghost and the shadow of
[56:25] self-denial and christianity has to do
[56:27] with
[56:28] self-hatred and it's a lie
[56:32] it's an absolute line
[56:34] to deny yourself and to take up a cross
[56:37] is not to consent to abuse
[56:39] well jesus is telling love your enemies
[56:41] do good to those that despite that hate
[56:42] you and bless them that curse you and
[56:44] pray for them to despitefully use you
[56:46] this is not a a an invitation to be
[56:48] taken advantage of
[56:51] like we're singing you know you know
[56:53] jesus i'm available to you and to
[56:55] everyone else you can take advantage of
[56:56] me
[56:57] you know it's not we don't we're not
[56:58] singing a chorus to the world like hey
[57:00] i've signed up for yeah go ahead take it
[57:02] you want my money here's my money
[57:04] you want my car here's my keys
[57:07] it's not it's just a little bit of an
[57:09] imbalance and if if it seems like maybe
[57:11] i push too far in the one side from
[57:14] being kind of extreme that's just maybe
[57:16] my personality but i do it to make a
[57:18] point that maybe you could just back up
[57:20] a little bit like yeah he's kind of
[57:21] pushing it real aggressive on that end
[57:22] but you know what this has there's a
[57:24] there's a real applicable point here
[57:28] in matthew chapter 10 verse 16 he says
[57:30] behold i send you forth the sheep in the
[57:32] midst of wolves thanks
[57:35] thanks
[57:36] you're sending me out i'm as a sheep in
[57:38] the midst of wolves
[57:40] i think i preached a graduation a
[57:45] banquet one time called behold the
[57:46] wolves or it was a you know like here
[57:48] they are
[57:49] let me introduce you to the wolves
[57:52] behold i send you forth a sheep in the
[57:54] midst of wolves
[57:55] be therefore wise as serpents and
[57:57] harmlesses doves
[57:59] now this is teaching of jesus christ
[58:02] he's telling us you are going out as
[58:04] sheep in the midst of wolves what the
[58:05] wolves want to do want to eat the sheep
[58:06] rip them up tear them limb to limb
[58:08] and jesus says therefore offer your
[58:11] limbs to the wolves they may rend you
[58:13] and rip you apart and destroy you and
[58:15] take away your life
[58:17] because if we misinterpret luke chapter
[58:19] 6 matthew chapter 5 we might just say
[58:20] well as sheep we just we just yield to
[58:22] whatever happens whatever comes we can't
[58:24] defend ourselves we can't do anything
[58:25] against it but he says to be wise as
[58:28] serpents
[58:29] the words exercise prudence concerning
[58:30] your own safety i'm gonna send you out
[58:32] it's gonna be peril it's gonna be
[58:33] difficult it'll be a lot of tension a
[58:35] lot of rebukes a lot of chastising a lot
[58:37] of difficult circumstances but be very
[58:39] prudent and wise concerning your own
[58:41] safety i'd be very cautious to avoid
[58:43] harm because the why the wisdom of a
[58:45] serpent is quickly can evade a danger
[58:49] but then also be harmless as dubs it
[58:50] speaks of an innocence
[58:52] that a dove is not going to provoke
[58:54] injury a dove is not going to act in a
[58:56] way that invites harm right the
[58:58] tenderness the meekness of a dove
[59:00] it it it quickly itself is going to be
[59:02] alarmed in more of a tender meek way
[59:05] maybe not in the the the serpent's way
[59:07] of evading and disguising itself and
[59:10] blending in with its area or setting up
[59:14] its defenses to warn a dove is very meek
[59:17] and
[59:17] uh and
[59:19] harmless as he says be harmless as doves
[59:21] doves in their inability to offend you
[59:23] ought to be the same way in other words
[59:24] you want to be wise as a serpent to
[59:26] avoid harm but also don't be so bold and
[59:30] brash to invite it be innocent of evil
[59:33] it's a combination of unflinching zeal
[59:36] but then calm discretion
[59:39] an amazing combination of attributes
[59:41] it's another paradox per se
[59:43] the wisdom of a serpent would save them
[59:45] from the unnecessary unnecessary
[59:47] exposure to danger
[59:49] if you're wise as a serpent you're not
[59:51] just inviting harm you're just not
[59:52] inviting yourself to be trampled over
[59:54] your head cut off and to be abused you
[59:56] he says this to be wise as a serpent
[59:58] you're going to be cautious and avoid
[1:00:00] danger but to be harmless as a dove
[1:00:01] would allow them to escape the kind of
[1:00:03] conduct that brings harm and escape
[1:00:05] sinful conduct that's hurtful interest
[1:00:08] to themselves or even to others
[1:00:11] avoid the conflict and danger he's
[1:00:12] saying be harm you're going to be sheep
[1:00:14] in the midst of wolves this is dangerous
[1:00:16] this is precarious you ought to be you
[1:00:18] have to be aware that there's forces
[1:00:21] and because of your nature and because
[1:00:23] of how god's called you're considerate
[1:00:24] you're self-sacrificing uh you you're
[1:00:27] you're you're denying yourself you're
[1:00:28] taking up a cross you're compassionate
[1:00:30] you're forgiving uh you're willing to
[1:00:32] serve you're all these things you're
[1:00:33] willing to humble yourself you're the
[1:00:35] one that is willing to get beneath
[1:00:36] somebody else because of these things
[1:00:38] and this nature and these essential
[1:00:40] qualities of the holy spirit he's saying
[1:00:42] i send you forth and it's going to be
[1:00:44] dangerous so be wise as a serpent a
[1:00:46] harmless as a dove in other words avoid
[1:00:48] conflict and danger and don't return it
[1:00:51] if you're unable to avoid it
[1:00:55] so it's it's part and parcel it comes
[1:00:57] together avoid conflict
[1:00:58] be wise as serpents and harmless as
[1:01:00] doves avoid it if you can but if you
[1:01:02] come into conflict don't return it
[1:01:06] therefore i want to come back to luke
[1:01:08] chapter 6 verses 29
[1:01:10] to him that smites you on the cheek
[1:01:12] offer him the other also turning your
[1:01:14] cheek doesn't mean
[1:01:15] you offer the cheek that hasn't been
[1:01:17] slapped up to be slapped
[1:01:23] right i mean if you don't see it that
[1:01:24] way i'm not going to ask you to say amen
[1:01:28] but and when you think very deeply about
[1:01:30] this and what christ is trying to say is
[1:01:32] that if somebody slaps you in the face
[1:01:37] is it's literally not telling them that
[1:01:39] you've got to let them slap you on the
[1:01:41] other side of your face to even out the
[1:01:44] burn or the red mark
[1:01:46] it's not
[1:01:47] to
[1:01:48] invite the slap again
[1:01:51] but not to slap back
[1:01:53] right
[1:01:57] you can't you can't slap back and then
[1:01:58] ask why did they slap
[1:02:00] right
[1:02:01] you just say why how can you slap right
[1:02:04] this is what jesus is saying in matthew
[1:02:06] chapter 5 verse 39 but i say unto you
[1:02:07] listen to how he says it that you resent
[1:02:09] not evil resist not evil
[1:02:13] that you resist not evil
[1:02:15] now this has been taken into
[1:02:17] non-resistance of violence
[1:02:20] and to some extremes towards like you
[1:02:21] can't you can't do anything if somebody
[1:02:24] shows up at your door and demands your
[1:02:25] stuff you can't take do anything to
[1:02:27] defend yourself against it it's a very
[1:02:29] interesting
[1:02:30] doctrine in theology and i've written
[1:02:32] read some of the books on it a part
[1:02:34] portions of it and one in particular
[1:02:36] he says you resist not evil but
[1:02:39] whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
[1:02:42] cheek turn to him the other also
[1:02:45] so when he uses this illusion of being
[1:02:47] smitten on the right cheek
[1:02:49] it's not so much that someone is is
[1:02:51] going to
[1:02:52] shoot you and they kind of miss and just
[1:02:55] kind of catch you in the shoulder oh
[1:02:57] were you aiming for the heart it's right
[1:02:59] here
[1:03:00] it's right here i know you missed but
[1:03:02] just get me right you want to get closer
[1:03:03] maybe you're not a good aim
[1:03:06] it's talking about within relationships
[1:03:08] somebody does something to demean you
[1:03:09] hurt you offend you humiliate you
[1:03:12] and jesus is talking about forgiveness
[1:03:15] says if you get smile if someone smites
[1:03:17] you on one cheek offer also the other
[1:03:19] it's a it's a language to suggest
[1:03:20] forgiveness and he's talking about
[1:03:22] responding the right way after personal
[1:03:25] defense he's talking about
[1:03:27] about not
[1:03:29] not acting out what would be you have to
[1:03:31] actually
[1:03:32] not act you have to act against instinct
[1:03:35] if someone punches you your instinct is
[1:03:37] to punch back
[1:03:38] and so it's very beautiful that he would
[1:03:40] uh use it in this context because when
[1:03:42] someone hurts you what our instinct is
[1:03:45] to hurt back
[1:03:46] you've hurt me so i want to hurt you
[1:03:47] back you've said something rude i want
[1:03:48] to say something rude back. and so he's
[1:03:50] jesus is talking about not returning the
[1:03:52] same conduct
[1:03:54] out of spite
[1:03:56] not returning the same conduct out of
[1:03:57] vengeance
[1:03:59] that if someone smites you in a way to
[1:04:01] humility you embarrass you to cause a
[1:04:04] personal offense he's saying i know that
[1:04:06] it would be very easy for you to offend
[1:04:08] and return but you can't do that
[1:04:10] and i want to go into this deeper with
[1:04:12] using the message of the hour maybe
[1:04:14] it'll be wednesday night but i want to i
[1:04:16] want you to pause on that thought that
[1:04:18] there
[1:04:19] that when it says that if someone hits
[1:04:22] you
[1:04:23] just let them hit you again
[1:04:25] is not what he means
[1:04:27] if someone hits you don't hit back
[1:04:29] i'll tell you right now
[1:04:31] that if you find yourself hitting back
[1:04:33] take notice
[1:04:35] something's not right
[1:04:37] you're not who you are anymore
[1:04:39] that's not you
[1:04:40] you're in a situation you're hitting
[1:04:42] back something's got to change
[1:04:45] you're not operating anymore by the
[1:04:46] character of christ like lord what have
[1:04:48] i become what am i doing
[1:04:50] this is not in the nature of the word of
[1:04:52] god this isn't how i believe i'm acting
[1:04:54] out what happens to people and i guess
[1:04:55] this is getting into what i'm wanting to
[1:04:57] come to you know people who hate
[1:05:00] something so much they can become it
[1:05:04] so you have to recognize that fine line
[1:05:06] what have what it means to turn the
[1:05:08] other cheek
[1:05:10] and and so
[1:05:13] with that
[1:05:14] that principle and that idea
[1:05:16] and i want to revisit it
[1:05:18] i want you to consider the following
[1:05:20] when pondering this
[1:05:23] pondering whether the word authorizes us
[1:05:25] and gives us the liberty give us the
[1:05:27] power but then also the permission the
[1:05:28] approval to set limits
[1:05:31] using luke chapter six kind of like well
[1:05:33] look what it says
[1:05:34] right this is what this is what it says
[1:05:36] you're a christian you ought to do this
[1:05:38] you ought to do that um after all we're
[1:05:41] christians right we should be able to
[1:05:42] treat each other however we want we've
[1:05:44] kind of take this we're christians we
[1:05:45] love one another uh not only should we
[1:05:47] chew one another's chewing gum but you
[1:05:48] also should be able to put up whatever
[1:05:49] whatever i spit in your face
[1:05:51] right it's kind of the idea that we
[1:05:53] begin to characterize
[1:05:54] of when it comes to
[1:05:56] uh christian character christian virtue
[1:05:58] and personal autonomy and liberty but
[1:06:01] consider this and just thinking about
[1:06:02] whether or not the word establishes
[1:06:04] limits
[1:06:05] in relationships
[1:06:07] in hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore
[1:06:08] seeing we also are compassed about with
[1:06:11] so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:06:14] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:06:16] sin which doth so easily beset us
[1:06:19] and let us run with patience the race
[1:06:21] that is set before us we got to run our
[1:06:23] own race
[1:06:24] and he's addressing
[1:06:27] barriers to the finish line
[1:06:29] so he says let us lay aside every weight
[1:06:31] it's 11 35 for the person who's wanting
[1:06:33] to know let us lay aside every weight
[1:06:35] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[1:06:36] us you're operating the gift appreciate
[1:06:38] it
[1:06:40] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:06:42] sin which death so easily beset us this
[1:06:44] besetting weight which is a burden an
[1:06:46] encumbrance a barrier
[1:06:48] this be said in weight
[1:06:50] or sin it means an offense
[1:06:53] something that could even cause you to
[1:06:54] stumble to be setting weight a burden an
[1:06:56] encumbrance or sin a besetting sin
[1:06:59] we're to lay aside these
[1:07:01] so i ask you are you conscious of the
[1:07:04] things it calls it besetting that
[1:07:05] something that envelops or surrounds or
[1:07:07] wraps you up are we conscious of the
[1:07:09] things that press against us
[1:07:11] the things that cause pressure
[1:07:13] the things that are kind of pushing us
[1:07:14] to act against who we really are the
[1:07:16] things that are kind of it's besetting
[1:07:18] in that it's it's it's hindering me it's
[1:07:20] enveloping me it's changing the way i
[1:07:22] think the way i act and my instincts and
[1:07:24] i'm really a serving person and really
[1:07:27] i'm a caring person and really i'm
[1:07:29] sensitive and really i love and i want
[1:07:31] to fellowship and really i have this
[1:07:33] desire but what's causing me the
[1:07:35] self-denial the self-hatred what's
[1:07:37] enveloping me and pressing me
[1:07:41] are we are we conscious of those things
[1:07:45] because
[1:07:47] disrespect
[1:07:53] can be a barrier to bearing your own
[1:07:55] burdens
[1:07:57] let's lay aside the weight of sin what
[1:07:58] so even if you said us let us run with
[1:08:00] patience the race that set before us
[1:08:01] what is causing you to lose your
[1:08:03] patience in other words
[1:08:05] what's frustrating you
[1:08:07] take a step back what is causing you to
[1:08:09] lose it what's causing you frustration
[1:08:11] what's causing you to no longer be
[1:08:13] patient and ask yourself maybe i don't
[1:08:16] need that test
[1:08:18] and that's why i keep failing
[1:08:21] and it's more of an idea of walk away
[1:08:23] let it go
[1:08:24] i said i'm going to sit here until i can
[1:08:26] just be patient with it
[1:08:30] it's
[1:08:31] it's really a beautiful picture if you
[1:08:33] can let the lord speak to your heart
[1:08:35] abuse manipulation control these
[1:08:37] different personal attacks that we may
[1:08:39] experience and i'm maybe using really
[1:08:41] supercharged uh language just to
[1:08:44] describe conflict in our daily
[1:08:45] relationships and responsibilities
[1:08:47] within marriage and raising our children
[1:08:48] and things at work and things in church
[1:08:50] and even our relationship with the lord
[1:08:52] there's a lot of things that can be a
[1:08:53] barrier to us being able to bear our
[1:08:55] burdens things that stumble us things
[1:08:57] that block us
[1:08:59] and we know as it's emphasized rightly
[1:09:01] over and over and over again there's
[1:09:02] some personal weight some personal sins
[1:09:04] that we must lay down
[1:09:06] lay aside the weight lay aside the sin
[1:09:09] lay aside the personally the personal
[1:09:11] weights the person will be setting sin
[1:09:13] lay aside all these barriers and all
[1:09:14] these encumbrances every man must bear
[1:09:16] his own burden so find the burdens that
[1:09:19] are yours and unload everything that you
[1:09:21] ought not to be carrying there are
[1:09:22] personal things that we must lay down
[1:09:24] but then there's also weights and sins
[1:09:26] that we must avoid
[1:09:29] there's some that are yours it's this is
[1:09:31] your responsibility this is your problem
[1:09:33] lay it down but then there's others that
[1:09:35] we ought not to willingly accept and
[1:09:37] invite because they become besetting
[1:09:39] sins or besetting weights that are
[1:09:41] holding us back and we ought to learn to
[1:09:42] avoid them
[1:09:44] things that rob us of our peace things
[1:09:45] that still are joy things that disturb
[1:09:47] our mind
[1:09:48] if you peace is gone your joy is gone uh
[1:09:51] your stability safety everything is
[1:09:53] compromised then a boundary is being
[1:09:55] violated somewhere
[1:09:57] you've either stepped beyond protection
[1:09:59] or something's got within your spirit
[1:10:01] and is in his defiling it and you have
[1:10:02] to recognize wait a minute this is not
[1:10:04] how a christian ought to feel this is
[1:10:06] how i i should not be made to feel this
[1:10:08] way in relationships if you're feeling a
[1:10:10] certain way and you don't feel safe
[1:10:11] there has to be a way to communicate
[1:10:13] that and hopefully the person is making
[1:10:14] you feel that way oh i'm sorry i didn't
[1:10:16] realize i was doing that and what
[1:10:17] respect that
[1:10:19] and isn't it horrible that churches
[1:10:21] anymore have become what they become
[1:10:23] places where you come here and the
[1:10:24] sword's just going to be exercised on
[1:10:26] you this is the judgment see you're in
[1:10:28] the judgment house i hope you brought
[1:10:30] your band-aids and your stitch kits and
[1:10:32] everything because you're going to get
[1:10:33] slaughtered this morning
[1:10:35] and some people just actually take the
[1:10:36] motto that you should come to church and
[1:10:38] your goal is to afflict the comforted
[1:10:40] and comfort of the afflicted
[1:10:42] it's like well that's your job then you
[1:10:44] better bring it all around in the end
[1:10:45] because everybody's afflicted you might
[1:10:46] as well comfort us
[1:10:48] and that's what relationships become
[1:10:51] beating down and tearing up and
[1:10:52] destroying i said if you feel if you
[1:10:54] don't feel
[1:10:55] welcome maybe you're not welcome right
[1:10:58] if you don't feel maybe maybe you're in
[1:11:00] the wrong spot in other words there's
[1:11:02] got to be some acknowledge understanding
[1:11:04] that some boundaries being violated if i
[1:11:06] feel this way
[1:11:07] paul's paul's referencing it verse 14 to
[1:11:09] the same chapter to 15. follow peace
[1:11:11] with all men that's the goal
[1:11:15] is to follow peace that that there would
[1:11:17] not be contention that there would not
[1:11:18] be strife there would not be war in in
[1:11:21] acrimony follow peace with all men and
[1:11:22] holiness without which no man shall see
[1:11:25] the lord whoo that escalated quickly
[1:11:29] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[1:11:31] the grace of god we must look diligently
[1:11:34] in this lest we are failing of the grace
[1:11:36] of god experiencing his grace
[1:11:39] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[1:11:42] trouble you
[1:11:43] and thereby many be defiled
[1:11:45] listen to your emotions as they talk to
[1:11:47] you
[1:11:48] a root of bitterness
[1:11:50] one of the most damaging
[1:11:52] things to a relationship is resentment
[1:11:55] and we begin to experience that
[1:11:56] resentment the contempt i think even in
[1:11:58] in some ways it's described this that
[1:12:00] when people come to the stage in a
[1:12:01] relationship where they're they're
[1:12:03] contentious they just resent the things
[1:12:05] that are done
[1:12:07] that that's a terrible marker
[1:12:10] if you've you've come into one of the
[1:12:12] most the worst dynamics of a
[1:12:14] relationship when you resent and it's
[1:12:15] amazing how some people will continue to
[1:12:18] subject themselves to an atmosphere that
[1:12:20] only creates resentment
[1:12:23] instead of trying to work out what how
[1:12:26] did we cross this line where now no
[1:12:28] matter what this person does even if
[1:12:29] they're sincere or right you resent it
[1:12:34] 11 40.
[1:12:40] if somebody's getting uncomfortable what
[1:12:41] time is it
[1:12:43] they're running analytics right now in
[1:12:45] the duration of my prior 140 services or
[1:12:48] whatever like what time are we nearing
[1:12:49] the metric now where should i use my
[1:12:51] timeout should i go for two
[1:12:55] what does the sheet say
[1:12:57] well my sheet tells me i'm
[1:12:59] doing good
[1:13:01] hebrews chapter 12 verse 14 15 is where
[1:13:03] we're at
[1:13:04] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[1:13:06] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[1:13:09] you have to recognize when you're being
[1:13:11] defiled when you when there's this
[1:13:12] bitterness something's wrestling you
[1:13:17] follow peace with all men
[1:13:19] if you can't have peace you're not
[1:13:20] always obligated to
[1:13:22] welcome contention
[1:13:24] you can't have peace you're not always
[1:13:26] welcome to you don't have to invite that
[1:13:28] circumstance if you can't have peace
[1:13:29] this is important you don't have to
[1:13:31] invite the contention the fighting the
[1:13:32] attack
[1:13:34] but what is it that's often said but
[1:13:35] we're family right
[1:13:38] it's like
[1:13:39] this is what families do we fight in the
[1:13:41] backyard and it's like you know what we
[1:13:42] don't even have a front yard
[1:13:43] like we spend our whole lives in the
[1:13:45] backyard
[1:13:47] right
[1:13:48] it's like you might as well just say
[1:13:49] where are you the backyard car's the
[1:13:51] backyard church is the backyard the
[1:13:53] restaurant's the backyard because this
[1:13:54] is what we fight in the backyard it's
[1:13:55] like i found a new name for earth
[1:13:58] the backyard
[1:14:02] but we're christians
[1:14:03] you're my brother you're my sister
[1:14:06] i had a man tell me one time a brother
[1:14:08] tell me one time at the time i didn't
[1:14:10] think he'd be a brother so i really
[1:14:11] wanted to invite him to do it but he
[1:14:12] said like this brother here i want to
[1:14:14] punch him in the face but i can't
[1:14:15] because he's my brother
[1:14:16] and at the time i was like you're not my
[1:14:17] brother take a swing
[1:14:20] and uh but we they kind of have this
[1:14:23] attitude that if your family or church
[1:14:25] or whatever all's fair in love and war
[1:14:27] sorry uh-uh
[1:14:28] that's not how it works
[1:14:31] romans chapter 12 verses 17 to 21
[1:14:35] recompense to no man evil for evil this
[1:14:38] is what jesus said it says resist not
[1:14:40] evil
[1:14:41] and turn the other cheek
[1:14:43] your natural instinct is to hit back
[1:14:47] right
[1:14:49] i remember one time my sister told me
[1:14:51] she said
[1:14:52] you need to pop that zit
[1:14:55] and i just said well you need to lose
[1:14:56] some weight whoa
[1:14:59] if you get anything out of service today
[1:15:01] don't ever say that
[1:15:03] all right if you just haven't been there
[1:15:04] at all 11 43 you haven't been in you
[1:15:07] know you're finally tuning in hey
[1:15:09] take that home as like real gold don't
[1:15:12] ever say that and just have the rule to
[1:15:14] say don't say that to anybody
[1:15:16] that way you don't get in the habit of
[1:15:17] always saying it to your buddies
[1:15:19] and you don't accidentally say it to
[1:15:21] anybody else your wife your sister your
[1:15:23] mom
[1:15:24] just somebody at the store
[1:15:27] if they offend you don't try to offend
[1:15:29] them back but hey what are we we're in
[1:15:30] the we're in the uh
[1:15:32] a rap battle era right
[1:15:36] if somebody
[1:15:37] uh releases a diss track on you you are
[1:15:39] obligated to release one as well right
[1:15:42] and i think i sometimes i don't know if
[1:15:43] i've ever shared this but some people
[1:15:45] tell me you know i stream so-and-so
[1:15:47] services i'm like oh that's awesome and
[1:15:48] i string so-and-so services and i'm like
[1:15:50] oh well how's that tennis match going
[1:15:52] right
[1:15:53] i mean they're just playing tennis with
[1:15:55] each other somebody preaches you know
[1:15:56] one plus one equals two this brother's
[1:15:58] preaching against math and it's like you
[1:15:59] know they're just kind of cueing off one
[1:16:01] another
[1:16:02] anyways
[1:16:05] recompense to no man evil for evil
[1:16:07] provide things honest in the sight of
[1:16:09] all men
[1:16:10] if it be possible as much as lieth in
[1:16:13] you as much as was within your power
[1:16:15] as much as you are able if it be
[1:16:16] possible i love how much grace is
[1:16:18] expressed here if it be possible as much
[1:16:20] as life is within your responsibility as
[1:16:23] much as you have power over the
[1:16:24] situation to affect it live peaceably
[1:16:26] with all men
[1:16:28] recognize he's not saying that you are
[1:16:29] with a contentious uh angry violent mob
[1:16:33] and you've got to live peaceably in the
[1:16:35] midst of it he said as much as it's
[1:16:36] within your power to create peace and
[1:16:38] harmonize then do it if it be possible
[1:16:41] as much as you are able it's within your
[1:16:42] control live peaceably with all men why
[1:16:44] we must follow peace with all men
[1:16:47] wrote it to the hebrews in chapter 12.
[1:16:48] now the romans in chapter 12
[1:16:51] dearly beloved avenge not yourselves
[1:16:54] in other words if you can't live in
[1:16:55] peace if there's contention if there's
[1:16:57] fighting if there's acrimony if there's
[1:16:59] offenses things being lobbed your way
[1:17:00] and criticisms and there's
[1:17:02] violations
[1:17:04] and things done that are not right and
[1:17:06] is that might be really uh aggravating
[1:17:08] language even in this in the smaller
[1:17:10] things if there's just little things
[1:17:12] that kind of poke at you and prod you
[1:17:14] and you don't appreciate then let's not
[1:17:16] get in the cycle of returning and kind
[1:17:19] even in the small little petty things
[1:17:21] that can happen in relationships and
[1:17:23] where well they did this to me so i'll
[1:17:24] do this they'll do that to you
[1:17:27] there's a way of responding where you
[1:17:28] don't need to avenge yourself there's a
[1:17:29] way that you can de-escalate he says but
[1:17:31] rather give place unto wrath
[1:17:34] i like that
[1:17:37] for it is written vengeance is mine i
[1:17:39] will repay saith the lord so you got to
[1:17:40] let the lord do it
[1:17:42] let the lord deal with somebody
[1:17:44] therefore find enemy hunger feed him
[1:17:47] if he thirsts give him drink
[1:17:49] for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of
[1:17:51] fire on his head just don't tell him
[1:17:53] that's what you're doing while you're
[1:17:53] doing it hope you enjoy the hot coals
[1:17:56] no i asked for coffee
[1:17:59] be not overcome of evil but overcome
[1:18:01] evil with good
[1:18:02] i would say this is our goal right
[1:18:05] love your enemies
[1:18:06] therefore that enemy hunger feed them
[1:18:08] thirst give them a drink this is our
[1:18:10] goal this is what we want well i want to
[1:18:11] come to a place where my spirit is free
[1:18:13] i want to come to a place where i'm not
[1:18:15] bitter i'm not resentful i want to come
[1:18:16] to a place where if i found that my
[1:18:18] enemy needed something i would be
[1:18:19] willing to give it to him
[1:18:22] that's the goal don't do be not overcome
[1:18:24] of evil but overcome evil with good
[1:18:28] the word in no place ever empowers the
[1:18:30] believer the christian to treat others
[1:18:32] with contempt
[1:18:36] i challenged you last week who do you
[1:18:38] look down on
[1:18:40] who is it we look down upon
[1:18:43] and someone say the devil say all right
[1:18:44] that's scriptural we will look down upon
[1:18:46] him one day i'm like this is the thing
[1:18:47] that bothered me all right you got me
[1:18:50] but in this room is there somebody you
[1:18:51] look down on
[1:18:55] there's a there's an attitude where we
[1:18:56] have to realize there's just there's not
[1:18:59] place given in the scripture where we
[1:19:00] ought to treat others with scorn
[1:19:04] we're not authorized to mock or belittle
[1:19:06] anybody
[1:19:09] and the word does not so the word does
[1:19:10] not empower us to mistreat others and
[1:19:13] the word does not exempt christians from
[1:19:15] accountability for how they treat others
[1:19:18] amen
[1:19:19] we are not exempt from the
[1:19:20] accountability for how we treat others
[1:19:23] so accordingly as christians we have a
[1:19:25] duty
[1:19:27] to set limits in order to protect our
[1:19:28] hearts
[1:19:30] and ultimately hopefully hold other
[1:19:32] people accountable
[1:19:33] and i've run out of time so i'm going to
[1:19:35] stop
[1:19:36] or i'm going to jump to the end
[1:19:41] i'll come back to it
[1:19:44] but i'll say this we have the full
[1:19:45] authority of god to set boundaries
[1:19:49] to establish protective boundaries for
[1:19:51] ourselves for our family we're fully
[1:19:53] authorized to do it
[1:19:56] and therefore if you could take what
[1:19:58] little i've shared and some of the
[1:19:59] things i'm leaving off now
[1:20:02] it's a warning because hopefully that in
[1:20:04] one way what i'm addressing would some
[1:20:06] people somebody take this as you know
[1:20:07] what i have to set limits
[1:20:10] but hopefully it's also instructing
[1:20:12] others as a warning to not bypass or
[1:20:14] violate boundaries
[1:20:16] yeah there's a conduct then that i can
[1:20:18] engage in where i'm the enemy i'm the
[1:20:20] cheek smiter
[1:20:23] i'm the one grabbing the cloak and
[1:20:24] taking the coat like there's a way that
[1:20:26] you've got to begin to recognize that
[1:20:28] there is a possibility according to
[1:20:29] human behavior and influence that maybe
[1:20:31] i'm the one
[1:20:33] that's breaking that's passing
[1:20:34] boundaries maybe i'm the one that's
[1:20:36] being insensitive maybe i'm the one
[1:20:38] that's engaged in hurtful conduct and
[1:20:39] therefore i realize oh my i need to be
[1:20:41] sure that i'm not doing this anymore
[1:20:44] and so much about this subject of
[1:20:46] barriers and boundaries is about
[1:20:47] demonstrating to others
[1:20:49] what is right
[1:20:52] what is right for their correction and
[1:20:54] for their instruction
[1:20:56] that if you constantly allow somebody to
[1:20:58] always violate a boundary you're
[1:21:00] enabling them to continue to be boundary
[1:21:02] violators and some people raise their
[1:21:05] children constantly violating their
[1:21:06] children's boundaries and they're all
[1:21:08] shocked and hot under the sports caller
[1:21:10] when their children violate everyone
[1:21:12] else's boundaries in adulthood it's
[1:21:14] because you never established that a
[1:21:16] child can say no that a child has a
[1:21:18] right to certain things and they think
[1:21:20] the whole world is about being told what
[1:21:21] to do and
[1:21:22] whoever's the strongest survival of the
[1:21:24] fittest and so there's a way that we
[1:21:25] must act to establish certain things and
[1:21:28] to regard certain things so that it's
[1:21:29] instructed to those who are repetitive
[1:21:31] in their bad behaviors
[1:21:34] oh my i do want to close i will say that
[1:21:36] as a as a positive confession i would
[1:21:38] like to end this but so many ways the
[1:21:40] way that we we shriek back and we don't
[1:21:42] stand for ourselves and we don't say and
[1:21:44] do the right things it's just constantly
[1:21:46] enabling the person i was sharing this
[1:21:48] with my wife in conversation that if
[1:21:50] somebody asked you to do something if
[1:21:52] it's not appropriate to ask tell them
[1:21:56] kids you're like oh you know what i just
[1:21:58] don't have time tomorrow oh what about
[1:21:59] the next day
[1:22:01] well you know i just you know we got
[1:22:03] then what about the next day
[1:22:05] right because they see it as a barrier
[1:22:07] oh it's fine this is just a barrier
[1:22:09] let's work on the barrier and you
[1:22:11] haven't articulated to them i feel like
[1:22:12] if i express this we could just end the
[1:22:14] series you haven't articulated to him
[1:22:16] wait a minute i'm sorry that's a that's
[1:22:18] something you don't cross
[1:22:19] that's disrespectful you don't talk to
[1:22:21] somebody that way or that's you don't
[1:22:23] you don't approach it that way or that's
[1:22:25] not right that's not appropriate and you
[1:22:27] establish you don't use the excuses to
[1:22:29] that to the person think well that's
[1:22:30] just a barrier let's overcome it
[1:22:32] does that make sense
[1:22:34] it's your responsibility to let that
[1:22:36] person know wait a minute this is a
[1:22:39] boundary and then they might go oh i
[1:22:42] never knew that thanks for letting me
[1:22:44] know and they walk away going i've been
[1:22:45] doing that my whole life
[1:22:47] telling those sisters they need to lose
[1:22:48] weight what have i done
[1:22:50] and and we've set the boundary today
[1:22:52] we've told you don't do that it's
[1:22:53] insensitive you're never going to get
[1:22:55] married that way
[1:23:01] sister i i'm interested but what are
[1:23:03] your thoughts on
[1:23:04] slim fast
[1:23:08] what's it called thin healthy mama
[1:23:10] what's this the weirdest diets we got
[1:23:12] out there
[1:23:14] all right all right
[1:23:18] romans chapter 16. verses 17 to 19 i'm
[1:23:21] bringing this just down to
[1:23:24] close here now i beseech you brother and
[1:23:26] mark them which cause divisions and
[1:23:27] offenses
[1:23:28] you know what defense refers to
[1:23:31] the trigger of a trap
[1:23:35] i think it's a very good modern word
[1:23:36] triggers
[1:23:38] something's true something triggers you
[1:23:40] why do you always
[1:23:43] subject yourself to it
[1:23:45] mark them which cause divisions and
[1:23:47] offensive offenses contrary to the
[1:23:49] doctrine which you have learned
[1:23:50] and avoid them brother reggie was
[1:23:52] sharing something with me that he
[1:23:53] preached on defense and offense i was
[1:23:56] thinking pondering that and actually
[1:23:57] wanted to call you yesterday and and get
[1:24:00] more get more like kind of load me up
[1:24:02] you know i want to revisit this subject
[1:24:04] says and avoid them the lord could have
[1:24:06] been translated to shun
[1:24:08] all right a christian is to
[1:24:11] love their enemies turn the other cheek
[1:24:14] if you're sued for your cloak give your
[1:24:16] code also right there's this whole idea
[1:24:18] but then paul we're talking about limits
[1:24:19] we're just looking at the word does the
[1:24:21] word of god authorize us as christians
[1:24:23] to take to take measures to promote
[1:24:26] growth in our lives and to avoid the
[1:24:28] things that bring us down and to be sure
[1:24:30] that we're proceeding right in the right
[1:24:32] spirit in the right direction in the
[1:24:33] word of god he says mark those that
[1:24:35] cause divisions and offenses and avoid
[1:24:38] them
[1:24:40] for they are that are such serve not our
[1:24:42] lord jesus christ but their own belly
[1:24:44] it's arrogance it's presumptive pride
[1:24:46] it's satisfying themselves it's it's
[1:24:49] immediate gratitude it's that nastiness
[1:24:51] of self that they're serving and by good
[1:24:53] words and fair speeches deceive the
[1:24:55] hearts of the simple for your obedience
[1:24:57] has come abroad unto all men i am glad
[1:24:59] therefore on your behalf but yet i would
[1:25:02] have you wise unto that which is good
[1:25:04] and simple concerning evil
[1:25:08] i would that you would be wise
[1:25:09] concerning that which is good that's
[1:25:11] what you associate with that's what you
[1:25:13] harmonize with that's what you feed on
[1:25:14] that's what you know that's what you're
[1:25:15] pursuing that's what you're
[1:25:16] understanding and innocent and simple
[1:25:18] concerning evil in other words we do not
[1:25:21] have to invite harm
[1:25:24] we are not forced to consent to evil we
[1:25:26] are not forced to serve to subject
[1:25:29] ourselves to unrighteous conduct in
[1:25:31] personal relationships he says i would
[1:25:32] that you would be wise unto that which
[1:25:34] is good cleave to that which is good
[1:25:35] abhor that which is evil
[1:25:39] there's a it's a joining yourself too he
[1:25:41] says be simple concerning evil be wise
[1:25:43] as serpents harmless as doves mark those
[1:25:45] which cause offenses and avoid them
[1:25:47] think about all these different
[1:25:48] scriptures lay aside the weight don't
[1:25:49] let a bitterness spring up inside me if
[1:25:51] it be possible and it's within your
[1:25:53] power live peaceably with all men but if
[1:25:55] you can't have peace and harmony in
[1:25:57] accord then something's got to change
[1:26:03] we need to learn and
[1:26:05] i was going to use an example when i
[1:26:06] realized now by skipping it i i might
[1:26:09] kind of have you and i realize now maybe
[1:26:11] would have just pushed us farther but
[1:26:12] you have to be very careful to
[1:26:13] understand where my heart's at and what
[1:26:15] i'm identifying
[1:26:16] hopefully it can become more personal to
[1:26:18] you in a very relevant way
[1:26:20] but we need to learn to set boundaries
[1:26:21] we need to know how to clearly define
[1:26:23] them and we need to learn how to address
[1:26:24] the violations
[1:26:28] i kept coming back to this over and over
[1:26:30] and over again
[1:26:33] and i could not get away from it
[1:26:34] yesterday i think i just don't know
[1:26:35] where
[1:26:36] i don't know where this is
[1:26:38] um
[1:26:40] it's just what kept coming to my mind
[1:26:41] over and over and over again
[1:26:43] too much salt and you'll die too much
[1:26:44] pride you'll die but not enough you
[1:26:46] won't live you won't stand
[1:26:48] the pride paradox
[1:26:50] setting limits
[1:26:53] according to a limitless word all these
[1:26:54] things i i know it's kind of like this
[1:26:57] difficult balance and you might be
[1:26:58] following me like i you feel like oh
[1:27:00] brother aaron's going over
[1:27:02] go back over here but hopefully just in
[1:27:04] time we just find that balance and that
[1:27:07] rhythm to just start going forward
[1:27:10] and i was thinking of this scripture in
[1:27:12] first kings second kings chapter seven
[1:27:14] verses three and four is what i want to
[1:27:15] read to you
[1:27:17] but in this time
[1:27:19] the syrians have besieged samaria
[1:27:23] i think i believe it's king bin hadad
[1:27:25] besieges samaria and it's in a time of a
[1:27:27] great famine so now it's being sieged
[1:27:29] and so if it had been a time of plenty
[1:27:32] it still ultimately would have been very
[1:27:33] bad but it'd be in a time of famine
[1:27:36] it makes exasperate circumstances and as
[1:27:38] the city's being besieged it gets so
[1:27:40] awful
[1:27:42] that
[1:27:44] the bible relates the story of how a
[1:27:46] woman told this other
[1:27:48] a woman let us eat my child
[1:27:51] this is desperate
[1:27:53] this is grieving this is terrible
[1:27:55] and it tells us interest so this is the
[1:27:57] circumstances within the city
[1:28:00] it's a famine
[1:28:01] it's being besieged it's being torn down
[1:28:03] there's not being fed they're dying
[1:28:04] they're devouring one another it's
[1:28:06] complete utter chaos
[1:28:09] is stuck within this and those barriers
[1:28:12] come and
[1:28:13] there's so much that i could try to
[1:28:14] express to but in second kings chapter
[1:28:15] seven verses three and four
[1:28:17] so there were four leprous men at the
[1:28:18] entry and end of the gate and said they
[1:28:20] said one to the other another why sit
[1:28:23] here until we die
[1:28:25] that's what kept coming to me over and
[1:28:26] over and over and over again why
[1:28:29] sit here until we die
[1:28:31] why why would we sit
[1:28:34] in a place where we're dying
[1:28:37] you know i die daily not in that way
[1:28:39] right the way that you just have to turn
[1:28:41] around like oh well you know this is
[1:28:43] what this is my cross and this is what i
[1:28:45] have to bear and this is what i have to
[1:28:46] go through and and if you're not
[1:28:48] suffering you're not getting perfect
[1:28:49] character and there's a way that we can
[1:28:50] take all these beautiful principles in
[1:28:51] the word of god that have their place
[1:28:53] and we misapply them and we're forcing
[1:28:55] ourselves into dynamics and mechanics
[1:28:58] that are not healthy to our spiritual
[1:29:00] growth
[1:29:02] why sit here until we die these four
[1:29:05] lepers finally come to this understand
[1:29:06] they're sitting there at the entrance of
[1:29:07] the gate if we say notice their their
[1:29:09] thought process we will enter to the
[1:29:11] city and then the famine is in the city
[1:29:13] and we shall die there
[1:29:14] we're gonna die i'm dying where i'm at
[1:29:16] spiritually dying i'm completely nothing
[1:29:18] is good nothing is healthy nothing's
[1:29:20] reviving nothing is revitalized if if i
[1:29:23] if we enter the city says i'm going to
[1:29:25] die there he says and if we sit still
[1:29:26] here we die also
[1:29:29] now therefore come and let us fall into
[1:29:31] the host of the syrians if they save us
[1:29:33] alive we shall live and if they kill us
[1:29:36] we shall but die in other words i'm
[1:29:37] going to die where i'm at i'm going to
[1:29:39] die if i go in there i'm going to die if
[1:29:40] i stay but there's a chance that i might
[1:29:42] live if i act upon this desire there's a
[1:29:45] chance that i might live if i get myself
[1:29:47] out of the situation why sit here until
[1:29:50] i die i'm dying i don't have to die
[1:29:55] christianity is life it is liberty it is
[1:29:58] joy it is happiness let us not take the
[1:30:01] sackcloth and ashes of downtroddeness
[1:30:03] and brokenness and being a doormat and
[1:30:05] being abused being marginalized and
[1:30:07] being and manipulated controlling well i
[1:30:10] guess that's just what i do i'm sheep
[1:30:12] and i just let the shepherd do whatever
[1:30:13] he wants with me no you're letting
[1:30:15] another sheep do that to you
[1:30:18] your shepherd doesn't do that to you
[1:30:20] you're christ your lord and savior jesus
[1:30:22] doesn't do that to you we've entered the
[1:30:25] wrong kind of dynamics we're living in
[1:30:27] the wrong kind of tension we're getting
[1:30:29] too much salt we have too much pride
[1:30:31] it's time to to act why sit here until
[1:30:34] we die
[1:30:36] it's such an amazing thought to see
[1:30:38] these four lepers sit there go you know
[1:30:40] what if we stay right where we are we're
[1:30:42] going to die
[1:30:43] that much is certain
[1:30:45] if we go in there we're going to die so
[1:30:48] here they are just kind of at the gate
[1:30:49] they know they're not fully invested
[1:30:50] they know they know they're not in there
[1:30:52] enjoying whatever the city has to offer
[1:30:54] they've they've already they already
[1:30:55] know they're they're the lepers right
[1:30:58] they're not in the upper crust right
[1:30:59] they're in the wrong kind of cast in
[1:31:01] this scenario you know what we can't
[1:31:03] really go in and live we know we're
[1:31:05] going to die
[1:31:06] if we stay here we're going to die
[1:31:08] it's like so you know what
[1:31:10] i need to
[1:31:14] let's go
[1:31:17] because if we sit here
[1:31:19] why sit here until i die
[1:31:21] and brother branham the message who is
[1:31:22] this melchizedek i know
[1:31:24] this is good i i know this will help the
[1:31:27] way he places this
[1:31:29] because if you're given the alter if
[1:31:31] you're given the choice say sit here
[1:31:33] till i die
[1:31:34] go in there and die
[1:31:36] or go to the enemy and maybe they'll let
[1:31:38] me live
[1:31:39] that that uh
[1:31:42] maybe that creates
[1:31:43] an idea of well the chances are i'm
[1:31:45] going to die and i don't want to risk
[1:31:46] death at the hand of my enemies i'd just
[1:31:48] rather resign myself to die in
[1:31:50] circumstances that i have control over
[1:31:52] in circumstances that are familiar to me
[1:31:54] right
[1:31:55] right it's the idea that people don't
[1:31:57] like change
[1:31:59] and so afraid of change they know they
[1:32:01] need change but they're so afraid of it
[1:32:03] and like i know i'm gonna die but
[1:32:05] change is a more horrible thought to me
[1:32:07] than death so i'll just take what's
[1:32:08] comfortable and die a comfortable death
[1:32:11] uh or an uncomfortable death at least in
[1:32:13] settings that are familiar to me
[1:32:14] i'm just using a language that hopefully
[1:32:16] can become relevant to your life in
[1:32:17] whatever circumstance you're in
[1:32:19] and the message who is this melchizedek
[1:32:21] he says one time there were three lepers
[1:32:24] sat at the gate of samaria and then
[1:32:26] leper said why do we sit here till we
[1:32:28] die
[1:32:30] because all the syrians starving to
[1:32:31] death and eating one another's children
[1:32:33] they said if we go down to the enemy
[1:32:35] camp the syrians if they kill us we're
[1:32:37] going to die anyhow if they save us
[1:32:39] we'll live
[1:32:41] and they took that chance
[1:32:45] and by that faith
[1:32:48] what a very
[1:32:50] what beautiful language brother branham
[1:32:52] they took that chance and by that faith
[1:32:57] not that we would ever encourage him but
[1:32:58] say well what do you got to lose but
[1:33:00] i'll say this if you continue doing what
[1:33:02] you're doing just listen listen to me if
[1:33:04] you keep doing what you're doing there's
[1:33:06] no doubt you're going to die
[1:33:08] something needs to change
[1:33:12] and they took that chance and by that
[1:33:14] faith they not only saved their selves
[1:33:15] but the whole group
[1:33:19] and elijah just prophesied by this day
[1:33:21] tomorrow so much is going to be sold for
[1:33:22] so much it's like that's impossible
[1:33:24] that's impossible that's impossible
[1:33:27] but what it took was for these four
[1:33:29] lepers to say if we stay in this
[1:33:31] situation we're going to die something
[1:33:34] needs to change and then brother brahms
[1:33:35] says this this is the the beautiful
[1:33:37] switch now now you're going to die you
[1:33:41] can't live
[1:33:43] but you're not asked to go to the camp
[1:33:45] of the enemy you're invited to the house
[1:33:47] of the father and live
[1:33:50] that's what you're being invited to
[1:33:53] and where we're living today what's been
[1:33:55] opened up to us to what we have a choice
[1:33:57] over i'll say this take away the message
[1:33:59] of the hour i believe that god would
[1:34:02] have something so i'm not i'm not just
[1:34:04] being presumptuous that in the absence
[1:34:05] of the message of the hour there would
[1:34:07] be no god but yet that's what god did
[1:34:10] that's what god opened up that's what
[1:34:11] god made available and our choice
[1:34:13] anymore is not like well they're all
[1:34:15] wrong so i'll pick the one that's the
[1:34:17] least wrong it's all awful it's all
[1:34:19] perverted it's all bad it's all no good
[1:34:21] so i'll just do the pros and cons and
[1:34:23] i'll look at amenities and i'll look at
[1:34:25] price average now look at how much gas
[1:34:26] cost or i'll choose this and i'll choose
[1:34:29] that
[1:34:30] this isn't a scenario where it's like
[1:34:31] well these are your treatment options
[1:34:32] you can do this one and live six months
[1:34:34] you can do this one live seven months
[1:34:36] this one's more expensive though but
[1:34:37] this one's less painful
[1:34:39] what kind of part why would you want to
[1:34:40] be in that situation
[1:34:43] so you're saying if i do this i have
[1:34:45] this chance it's painful and it costs a
[1:34:47] lot but this one i have a greater chance
[1:34:48] but it's more painful
[1:34:50] and it costs more
[1:34:52] and that's not you're hearing me that's
[1:34:54] not your choice
[1:34:56] well our choice isn't that you're gonna
[1:34:58] die choose the way you're gonna die
[1:35:00] he says you're invited to the house of
[1:35:02] the father and live
[1:35:05] your choice isn't i guess i just need to
[1:35:07] take the the quickest death the longest
[1:35:10] death the easiest death the least
[1:35:12] expensive death no we're not living in a
[1:35:14] time of death we're not living in a time
[1:35:16] of of dying and shriveling up
[1:35:19] and we're not living in the age of just
[1:35:21] eking it out we're living in the age of
[1:35:23] triumph we're living in the age of more
[1:35:25] than a conqueror we're living in the age
[1:35:27] where even death comes under your feet
[1:35:31] you are not the one to be trampled on
[1:35:33] you're the one doing the trampoline if i
[1:35:35] can say this is under inspiration
[1:35:37] our feet are shod with the preparation
[1:35:40] of the gospel our feet have its peace
[1:35:42] that our feet are standing in it's peace
[1:35:45] where we find ourselves not in war not
[1:35:47] in strife not in contention so it's in
[1:35:49] this place of safety in this place of
[1:35:52] peace that we can conquer our enemies
[1:35:55] not by responding in kind what is the
[1:35:57] statement that today they fight fire
[1:35:59] with fire but we will fight fire with
[1:36:01] water
[1:36:05] you're not asked to go to the camp of
[1:36:06] the enemy
[1:36:08] you're invited to come to the house of
[1:36:09] the father and live
[1:36:11] come and see
[1:36:13] you're invited to something beautiful
[1:36:15] you're invited to something great
[1:36:18] and i felt to say this to those of us
[1:36:20] who are experiencing certain situations
[1:36:23] and challenges right now
[1:36:25] and where you are in your lives i'm
[1:36:27] saying to you today
[1:36:31] why sit there till you die
[1:36:34] take a chance
[1:36:35] and by that faith
[1:36:38] come to a place to live
[1:36:40] your own personal lives your own
[1:36:42] circumstances and situations the choice
[1:36:44] isn't death or death you have the choice
[1:36:46] of life
[1:36:48] deny yourself
[1:36:49] take up the cross
[1:36:50] and follow him
[1:36:52] god bless you today if you'd stand
[1:36:54] together with me
