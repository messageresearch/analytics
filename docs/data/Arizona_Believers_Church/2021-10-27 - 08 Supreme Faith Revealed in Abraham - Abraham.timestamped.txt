[0:00] genesis chapter 11 verse 1 it might seem
[0:02] a little odd because we're continuing on
[0:04] supreme faith revealed in abraham but i
[0:06] want to just slow down tonight and be a
[0:09] very very simple on identifying some
[0:11] characteristics that god uses to set up
[0:14] the life of abraham and it says and the
[0:16] whole earth was of one language and of
[0:19] one speech if you looked at chapter 10
[0:21] it it outlines noah's descendants
[0:25] and his three sons those are kind of
[0:27] what chapter 10
[0:30] sets forth as japath ham and shem's
[0:33] descendants and now it's saying that
[0:35] the whole earth is of one language and
[0:37] of one speech and it came to pass as
[0:39] they journeyed from the east that they
[0:41] found a plane in the land of shinar and
[0:43] they dwelt there
[0:44] and they said one to another go to let
[0:46] us make brick and burn them thoroughly
[0:49] and they had brick for stone and slime
[0:51] had they from order and they said go too
[0:54] let us build us a city and a tower whose
[0:56] top may reach unto heaven and let us
[0:59] make us a name lest we be scattered
[1:01] abroad upon the face of the whole earth
[1:03] and the lord came down to see the city
[1:04] and the tower which the children of men
[1:06] build in the lord said behold the people
[1:08] is one and they have all one language
[1:11] and this they begin to do and now
[1:12] nothing will be restrained from them
[1:14] which they have imagined to do go to let
[1:17] us go down and there confound their
[1:19] language that they may not understand
[1:21] one another's speech
[1:23] so the lord scattered them abroad from
[1:24] thence upon the face of all the earth
[1:26] and they left off to build the city
[1:29] therefore is the name of it called babel
[1:31] because the lord did there confound the
[1:33] language of all the earth and from
[1:35] thence did the lord scatter them abroad
[1:37] upon the face of all the earth
[1:39] and then it transitions these are the
[1:41] generations of shem hashem was 100 years
[1:43] old and begat our facts said
[1:45] two years after the flood let's pray our
[1:49] gracious heavenly father we're so happy
[1:51] to be in your presence this evening
[1:53] just a wonderful group a wonderful
[1:54] gathering we've been blessed by the
[1:57] singing by the special lord just even
[1:59] the ministering gifts amongst us and the
[2:01] love of coming this evening and and
[2:03] showing their support and their love
[2:05] lord we're just blessed by your presence
[2:07] we're blessed by the voices that have
[2:09] been raised and lord we're now excited
[2:11] about what your word holds for us
[2:13] tonight
[2:14] though we could read this bible a
[2:15] thousand times or there's a thousand
[2:17] different touches and a thousand
[2:18] different revelations and a thousand
[2:20] different uplift upliftings that we
[2:22] could receive from your word so tonight
[2:24] lord
[2:25] though this may be the 10 000th service
[2:27] for somebody and though this may be
[2:29] hundreds of hours that we put in
[2:31] together as a church lord it's still
[2:33] fresh it's still new to us and so we
[2:35] pray that you come
[2:36] break the bread of life to speak to us
[2:38] in a powerful way take control of this
[2:40] service for your glory as we all just
[2:42] relax in your presence and rest in your
[2:44] word tonight in the name of lord jesus
[2:46] christ we pray amen god bless you you
[2:48] can be seated
[2:51] continue on the subject of supreme faith
[2:53] revealed in abraham
[2:56] and kind of what we've been identifying
[2:58] is how that god's dealings with abraham
[3:01] help us to understand our faith and by
[3:04] recognizing that abraham's supreme faith
[3:07] that he comes to in genesis chapter 22
[3:10] is the product of god developing that
[3:12] faith and cultivating that faith it was
[3:14] the process not only of election but god
[3:17] appearing to him many times revealing
[3:19] himself revealing his character
[3:21] expanding on the promise abraham i'm
[3:23] going to do this and then he identifies
[3:25] with more specificity as he walks with
[3:27] god uh what those things are so we kind
[3:29] of look to looking at abraham to help us
[3:32] understand how that rapturing faith is
[3:34] going to be cultivated by the word of
[3:36] god in our hearts in the end time
[3:39] and i want to back up to kind of a theme
[3:42] that we have a subject that we
[3:44] a principle that we identified in the
[3:46] first couple services on this series
[3:49] is that in choosing abraham and i just
[3:50] want to do this very briefly in choosing
[3:53] abraham god intended to set forth
[3:56] abraham as an example
[3:58] and it was his intent to use his life to
[4:01] portray the plan of salvation
[4:03] now i'm not wanting to touch on this
[4:06] right now but it just it's at the
[4:08] forefront of what's in my burden is
[4:10] really when you come to abraham's life
[4:12] this is god picking up genesis chapter 3
[4:15] verse 15 that there's going to be a seed
[4:17] come see to the woman and so this is god
[4:20] wanting to not only fulfill prophecy but
[4:23] in this prophet's life and not only to
[4:25] bring genesis 3 15 to past he's wanting
[4:27] to use this character abraham to portray
[4:30] his plan of salvation so you could
[4:32] actually look into his life and by
[4:34] looking at his life you could see
[4:36] something mirrored back that god will do
[4:38] in your life and brother branham makes
[4:40] this statement very brief statement that
[4:42] i'm pulling out of the sermon abraham's
[4:44] grace covenant he says what is he doing
[4:47] and he's referring to very specific
[4:48] instance in scripture i believe it's
[4:50] even genesis chapter 18. he says he's
[4:52] showing to abraham this what he's going
[4:55] to do to abraham's seed
[4:57] and we saw that in several different
[4:59] statements we used last month and how
[5:01] that um
[5:02] several services ago how that god was
[5:05] going to use abraham as an example and
[5:07] he's an example to the believer and he's
[5:09] determined to be
[5:10] an example of the believer today an
[5:12] example of that faith
[5:14] and in the book of romans you'll find
[5:16] that paul
[5:17] the central character to paul
[5:19] expressing the plan of salvation and
[5:21] grace and faith he uses abraham and in
[5:24] romans chapter 4 verse 1 he says what
[5:26] shall we say then that abraham our
[5:28] father as pertaining to the flesh hath
[5:31] found
[5:32] and he's asking this question and i'm
[5:33] not maybe going to help you to
[5:35] understand that verse any with any
[5:36] greater clarity but just use it to show
[5:39] that here in romans chapter 4 paul's
[5:42] talking about abraham our father and he
[5:44] uses him as a central figure and an
[5:46] example of salvation by faith
[5:50] and what he's doing is he's identifying
[5:51] a pattern that if this is our father
[5:53] abraham and this is how god dealt with
[5:55] abraham he said he's identifying if this
[5:57] is what god did to the father this is
[5:59] what god does to the children and he
[6:01] uses him as an example that was not
[6:03] abraham justified by faith and wasn't he
[6:06] called by grace and did he do this and
[6:08] didn't he do that and he's expressing
[6:10] this and he says in the same chapter in
[6:12] verse 16 therefore it is of faith that
[6:14] it might be by grace to the end
[6:17] the promise might be sure to all the
[6:19] seed not to that only which is of the
[6:21] law but to that also which is of the
[6:24] faith of abraham who is the father of us
[6:27] all so abraham is the father of us all
[6:29] and being the father he's one that
[6:32] affords an example because that's what
[6:34] fathers ought to be they ought to be
[6:35] examples
[6:36] and and and there's even paul expresses
[6:38] the ideal that we would be followers of
[6:40] god as dear children so it's that that
[6:42] father relationship he's the example
[6:44] he's a forerunner and so paul is
[6:47] expressing how using abraham as a
[6:49] central figure an example of salvation
[6:52] by faith he's using a first example of
[6:55] grace he's using him as this pattern
[6:57] that god wanted to establish and he's
[6:59] identifying it and so this is again this
[7:03] is just kind of review
[7:04] uh to set the stage for a very specific
[7:06] thought tonight but i'm wanting to
[7:08] remind you that the exercise of looking
[7:10] at abraham's life is to help us to yield
[7:13] to god's process to produce a rapturing
[7:15] faith in our hearts
[7:17] and when i say rapturing faith in our
[7:18] hearts i believe that that is to put us
[7:21] into a position to believe that we have
[7:23] power to bind the greatest to the least
[7:26] so when we're we're not talking about
[7:28] just living completely defeated uh
[7:31] miserable lives and then one day just be
[7:33] like all right fine i've had enough of
[7:34] them to change my body but to begin to
[7:36] exercise faith to have victories in all
[7:38] sorts of areas of our lives whether it
[7:39] be mental and physical financial
[7:41] relationships estrangement to see health
[7:44] restored to our bodies to see family
[7:46] members restored to the faith and all
[7:49] sorts of exercises of our faith that we
[7:51] could have as we come into a real mature
[7:54] love of god in a real mature faith and
[7:56] so abraham is an example
[7:59] in the message abraham and his seed
[8:01] after him brother brahm says what he did
[8:03] to abraham by justification he did to
[8:06] his seed
[8:07] what he did to abraham through
[8:08] sanctification separation when he did he
[8:11] did the same thing
[8:12] when the church separates itself from
[8:15] all the things of the world then god
[8:16] applies the blood to it
[8:18] i isolated this particular one from a
[8:21] dozen or so where brother branham is
[8:22] using abraham
[8:24] and there was a few that seemed to be
[8:26] maybe
[8:27] more particular on brother branham
[8:28] identifying the process of justification
[8:31] sanctification and the baptism of the
[8:33] holy ghost it's already foreshadowed in
[8:35] abraham he uses in one place when he
[8:37] crossed over the river that that was a
[8:39] type of baptism and justification and he
[8:42] and he uses different examples in
[8:44] abraham's life to say look what
[8:45] abraham's doing his life is telling a
[8:48] story that we can relate to in our
[8:50] spiritual journey
[8:51] and he uses it here that what he did to
[8:53] abraham by justification he did to his
[8:55] seed and so what he does to abraham in
[8:58] these phases of his life and these
[9:00] stages of his journey though it might
[9:01] not be perfectly chronological to our
[9:03] stages and though we can't just we don't
[9:06] try to specifically try to match up
[9:07] certain things and say well i'm just in
[9:09] the euphrates crossing right now of my
[9:11] life as abraham was and
[9:13] and have a trip planned to egypt coming
[9:15] up right because we could learn from his
[9:17] example and not go to egypt and so it's
[9:19] not that we would try to force ourselves
[9:21] in a particular scriptural pattern uh
[9:23] that's a mistake sometimes we make we
[9:24] try to identify so particularly to
[9:26] people and says well i'm just like job
[9:28] or i'm just like prof the prophet amos
[9:30] and we try to take the specific details
[9:32] in their lives and kind of
[9:34] shoehorn our way to fit their their
[9:36] model but there's things we can learn
[9:38] there's examples and types and shadows
[9:40] and that's what brother branham is
[9:41] pointing out is that abraham is used to
[9:44] portray the plan of god
[9:46] that he's even used to foreshadow god's
[9:48] purpose and god's plan of salvation very
[9:51] specific things that happen with the the
[9:53] vision that he has uh uh of the
[9:56] sacrifices a vision of jesus christ the
[9:58] the isaac walking up mount moriah to be
[10:01] sacrificed is portraying and
[10:02] foreshadowing christ and so these many
[10:05] different details that god preserved
[10:07] within the book of genesis
[10:10] holds significance to us
[10:12] and we realize he doesn't tell the whole
[10:14] story
[10:15] there's many many details that are left
[10:17] out there's some that are he just refers
[10:18] to in general there's a lot of gaps that
[10:20] maybe you feel by drawing some of these
[10:22] inferences from the scripture
[10:24] but and
[10:26] there's
[10:26] and certain things that are implied
[10:29] there's a lot of things that we can draw
[10:30] from it but the specifics hold
[10:32] importance to us
[10:34] and there's details in his life that
[10:37] reveal important characteristics that
[10:39] help us relate to his faith
[10:42] if we just read that there was a man
[10:43] named abraham who had perfect faith and
[10:46] offered up his son isaac upon the altar
[10:49] upon the moment that god spoke to him
[10:51] and that is the faith that we ought to
[10:52] have in the end time i would think i
[10:54] failed the test every time
[10:56] i even once i begin to have children i
[10:58] begin to think you know what and this is
[11:00] if this stumbles anybody i apologize
[11:02] but with the thought of wow if the if in
[11:04] the rapture i was to leave my children
[11:07] behind
[11:08] there was a part of me that thought i
[11:09] would just rather stay with them through
[11:11] tribulation
[11:13] i'd rather be there for them i'd rather
[11:14] nurture them and be there and help them
[11:16] and comfort them and the whole thought
[11:18] of being separated from my children
[11:19] almost completely changed my ideal of
[11:21] let's just get out of here i thought
[11:23] hold on i want to be sure i want to know
[11:25] about the the the
[11:27] the permanence of my child my children's
[11:29] salvation i want to know that they're
[11:30] going with me i want to understand
[11:31] better the promise of the token uh
[11:33] because it completely changes your whole
[11:35] attitude i begin to feel if god was
[11:37] going to ask me to take the life of my
[11:39] son or my daughter i'd be like wait a
[11:40] minute
[11:42] how could i do this
[11:43] but thankfully god does not just tell
[11:45] the story of this perfect man abraham
[11:47] who had the faith of god's elect and
[11:49] this is what we got to do we got to fit
[11:50] into a two scripture a panel of what
[11:53] perfect faith is he tells the story and
[11:55] then telling the story it unfolds
[11:57] specific details
[11:59] um pacific and at length details that we
[12:02] can identify with to help us relate to
[12:04] his faith
[12:05] now if you like to turn in your bibles
[12:07] i'm going to focus in genesis chapter 11
[12:10] and a little bit in chapter 12. it's
[12:11] going to be a lot of scripture reading
[12:12] going to be very very very simple and
[12:15] it's been 111 times that i've thought
[12:17] this since we begin to minister here but
[12:19] i think i'm going to be short and brief
[12:20] tonight but as has happened in 110 times
[12:23] to this point i'd be very surprised if
[12:25] i'm
[12:26] less than an hour
[12:28] but in genesis chapter 11 verse 26 i
[12:30] just want to start here because it kind
[12:31] of helped me just to orient uh orient
[12:34] myself to how i was looking at these
[12:35] scriptures it says and terra lived 70
[12:38] years and begat abram now we're
[12:39] introduced to this character abram who
[12:41] we know later in genesis 17 his name is
[12:43] changed to abraham abram the and
[12:46] haran
[12:47] and so this this verse is the
[12:49] introduction to abram and i thought it
[12:51] was just a good point to start tonight
[12:53] if we're going to start looking at his
[12:54] life
[12:55] if we want to look at a particular
[12:56] detail in his life i thought this would
[12:57] be a good starting point
[12:59] if we read the next six verses it it
[13:01] gives greater details of his particular
[13:04] life and so
[13:05] at this point as there's been a
[13:07] genealogy um
[13:09] of abraham genesis chapter 11 verses 10
[13:11] to 25 we begin to read these are the
[13:13] generations hashem
[13:14] those 15 verses outlined the lineage of
[13:17] shem's descendants after the flood and
[13:19] then once we get to abram we don't know
[13:21] these kind of details there's some very
[13:23] specific details more than just who
[13:25] begat and how many sons they were and
[13:27] how many years it was we get more
[13:29] details to abraham's life because that's
[13:31] the story that's going to be amplified
[13:33] through the remainder of the scripture
[13:35] right we look at the book of we look at
[13:36] the old testament and we realize that
[13:38] even the book of genesis is trying to
[13:40] get us to abram as fast as we can and
[13:42] provide some context for who this
[13:43] character is because the rest of the
[13:46] bible result revolves around and is
[13:48] centered around abraham and his seed
[13:52] and we look we realize that it's only
[13:54] recorded if it has something to do with
[13:57] abraham and his seed and that the entire
[13:59] bible is built around that so we it
[14:01] starts to give us a few more details in
[14:03] the next six verses about his life and
[14:05] about his wife
[14:06] but then these these prior verses these
[14:08] 15 verses before in verses 10 to 25
[14:12] these descendants after the flood it
[14:13] kind of gives the um the appropriate
[14:15] genealogical context we can understand
[14:17] who abraham is within this long line of
[14:20] descendants of sham and even noah it
[14:22] also gives some historical context
[14:24] because it's giving us
[14:26] some
[14:27] years that we can begin to recognize how
[14:29] long after the flood that it was but
[14:31] even kind of building this together we
[14:33] would we could see that uh it's likely
[14:35] that abraham was alive hashem was alive
[14:37] at the same time abraham was having
[14:39] lived 500 years but it's kind of giving
[14:41] us some context to understand who did
[14:44] abraham come from and who his family was
[14:46] and ah and that helps us with the story
[14:49] but it's in probably the most important
[14:52] context and i don't i there's not some
[14:55] big great reveal here so if you're in
[14:56] suspense holding your breath this is the
[14:59] moment where it's like
[15:01] right like wow i never saw that before
[15:03] and i don't expect this but
[15:05] the most important context probably to
[15:07] abraham's life isn't so much who his
[15:09] father was his uncle was great great
[15:11] grandfather and all those things but the
[15:12] first nine verses of genesis chapter 11.
[15:15] and these this it's written in here
[15:18] because it provides this necessary
[15:21] contrast to what god's going to do in
[15:23] abraham in chapter 12.
[15:25] because there's a way that we could read
[15:26] this and you think oh well did we really
[15:28] even need this this tower of babel
[15:31] uh
[15:32] reference here did why was this in here
[15:34] oh god god provided that in there so we
[15:36] could understand why there's so many
[15:38] different languages and why the whole
[15:39] earth is overspread
[15:41] uh with with different languages and
[15:43] cultures and ethnicities and these
[15:45] things and maybe we use it to kind of
[15:47] have some archaeological make sense of
[15:50] it or genealogical sense or anthropology
[15:52] kind of gives us this study kind of
[15:54] gives us this well this is where this
[15:56] all stems from
[15:57] but it it provides us some very
[15:59] important contrast to the life of
[16:02] abraham and i think it's some of the
[16:03] most important context that we can draw
[16:05] from the life of abraham is in genesis
[16:07] chapter 11 starting with verse one
[16:09] because what and
[16:11] i want to read it with you the first
[16:12] five verses
[16:13] what god begins to do with abraham now i
[16:16] want to say this before i read these
[16:17] five verses what god begins to do in
[16:19] abraham is distinctly different
[16:23] than his family than how god dealt with
[16:25] his family it's distinctly different
[16:27] than his ancestors like the condition of
[16:30] mankind and the condition of the world
[16:31] and society and the uh and the and the
[16:34] cosmos at large it's very different the
[16:36] way that god has just dealt with them
[16:38] and god has just addressed them even if
[16:40] we wanted to see how he dealt with noah
[16:42] you realize that his dealings with adam
[16:43] his dealings with noah
[16:45] uh
[16:46] adam cain noah you just could come on
[16:48] down genesis chapter 11 and then how god
[16:50] deals with abraham it's very important
[16:52] just to see how distinctly different god
[16:55] deals with abraham and then also how
[16:57] distinctly different abraham becomes
[17:00] because god intervenes in his life
[17:02] and i think it would be very important
[17:04] for us to realize that abraham was the
[17:06] way he was because god so
[17:09] uh graciously yet forcefully imposed his
[17:13] character in his life
[17:15] had god never done it abraham wouldn't
[17:16] be written about as the father of faith
[17:18] that there's no animals that he'd be
[17:20] recorded and said oh we were just
[17:22] reading of harambe and nimrod and
[17:23] abraham you wouldn't have done it
[17:26] but it's because god kind of made this
[17:28] point to force himself into abraham's
[17:30] life and guide him and direct him and
[17:33] abraham just was overwhelmed with the
[17:35] revelation of god and that's how he
[17:37] becomes this father of the faith and
[17:39] this father of billions of people around
[17:41] the world that look to him as the father
[17:43] of their religion this is it's because
[17:45] god
[17:46] changed him
[17:48] and diverted his path so by god's
[17:50] intervention in his life abraham begins
[17:52] to react and behave very differently
[17:55] than the rest of the people in the world
[17:57] now verse 1 of genesis chapter 11.
[18:01] we've already read this but i want to
[18:02] read these i want to read five verses
[18:05] and then i want to read three verses of
[18:06] genesis chapter 12 and i want to bounce
[18:09] back to verse 4 of genesis 11 and start
[18:11] looking at
[18:12] the compare and contrast it says and the
[18:15] whole earth was of one language and of
[18:17] one speech and it came to pass as they
[18:19] journeyed from the east that they found
[18:21] a plane in the land of china we'll come
[18:23] to that towards the end of the service
[18:25] and they dwelt there and they said one
[18:26] to another go to let us make brick and
[18:29] burn them thoroughly throughly and they
[18:31] had brick for stone and slime had they
[18:33] from order they're wanting to build
[18:35] now to this point they would have dwelt
[18:37] in tents and they would have been more
[18:38] nomadic and they would have but now
[18:39] they're wanting uh some solid something
[18:42] permanent
[18:43] and they said now really grab a hold of
[18:45] this and then let it linger then we'll
[18:47] read god speaking to abraham and then
[18:49] we'll start to pick out
[18:51] this contract these contrasts and they
[18:53] said go to let us build us a city and a
[18:56] tower whose top may reach unto heaven
[18:58] and let us make us a name lest we be
[19:00] scattered abroad upon the face of the
[19:02] whole earth
[19:04] and the lord came down to see the city
[19:06] and the tower which the children of men
[19:07] builded so they had begun to build and
[19:09] we're making some progress on this
[19:11] this is mankind and their attitude
[19:15] and it's
[19:16] positioned right in the middle right
[19:18] after
[19:19] the japan's descendants ham's
[19:20] descendants shems descendants and right
[19:22] before it goes from shems line to abram
[19:24] it inserts this detail chronologically
[19:27] but more importantly to provide context
[19:29] for what how go of what the world was
[19:32] like when god began to deal with abraham
[19:35] and now in genesis chapter 12
[19:37] it says now the lord had said unto abram
[19:39] and this is what kind of gives us more
[19:41] of this background of what was happening
[19:43] in verses 27
[19:44] to 32 of genesis 11. the lord had said
[19:48] unto abram get thee out of that country
[19:50] and from thy kindred and from thy
[19:52] father's house unto a land that i'll
[19:55] show you so the land the kindred the
[19:57] father's house the family the ancestors
[20:00] there these are all god brings them into
[20:02] view
[20:03] and he says i want you to look at the
[20:05] land look at the people look at your
[20:06] family and i want you to get away from
[20:08] it and i'm going to take you to a
[20:09] different land that i'm going to show
[20:10] you and i will make of thee a great
[20:12] nation and i will bless thee and make
[20:14] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[20:16] blessing and i will bless them that
[20:18] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[20:20] thee and then thee all families of the
[20:22] earth
[20:23] be blessed shall all the families of the
[20:25] earth be blessed now
[20:27] i think you can already see just by
[20:28] reading those verses
[20:30] like the lego pieces start connecting
[20:32] like
[20:33] this is interesting point counterpoint
[20:35] spy versus spy you start seeing these
[20:37] contrast
[20:39] now let's look at verse 4 of genesis
[20:41] chapter 11 so we can see the mindset and
[20:42] the attitude of the people it's really
[20:44] the only
[20:46] insight into the dialogue of the day the
[20:48] prevailing mindset of the day before god
[20:49] speaks to abram uh we could see some
[20:52] activity of abraham's family but that's
[20:54] spurred on by god but
[20:56] these this activity in genesis 11 at the
[20:58] end is god's response to what's
[21:00] happening within this climate that we
[21:02] see here in genesis 11 at the beginning
[21:04] and in verse four i'm going to go just
[21:06] phrase by phrase and they said go to
[21:09] let us build us a city and a tower and i
[21:11] don't think did i yeah thank you brother
[21:13] john for putting that up there i think i
[21:14] just realized that maybe i didn't even
[21:15] put this these things in the slide
[21:17] because i was just going to go back and
[21:18] look at this verse go to let us build us
[21:22] a city and a tower
[21:24] notice that let us build us
[21:27] it's not let me build you
[21:30] and it's not um will you build me
[21:33] it's it's it's us let us build us
[21:36] and notice how different this is from
[21:38] the language that god uses towards
[21:40] abraham i will bless i will make and
[21:44] right away you begin to see this
[21:45] difference wherein the people in genesis
[21:47] 11 say let us build us
[21:50] and we're going to do this and we're
[21:51] going to accomplish this and it shows
[21:53] that there's a self-reliance
[21:55] that they're reliant on their ingenuity
[21:56] we can make bricks and we can have
[21:58] mortar and we can build things and we
[22:00] can we can achieve certain uh
[22:02] accomplishments and what a what a great
[22:04] turnaround to a civilization that had
[22:06] just been wiped off the face of the
[22:08] earth when they were achieving such
[22:09] great scientific achievements
[22:12] and they may have looked and thought oh
[22:13] man we can replicate the the pyramids
[22:16] and we can do this and we can do that
[22:17] and it was still this is still in us we
[22:19] can still accomplish these great things
[22:20] by science and so there was a
[22:22] self-reliance whereas god is using a
[22:24] language to abraham to not imply that if
[22:27] you will i will
[22:29] but unconditionally i'm going to do it
[22:31] abraham
[22:32] i am going to do it there was there's
[22:34] this difference then between the
[22:35] self-reliance of the day that prevailed
[22:38] in that day versus an individual
[22:40] completely relying upon god
[22:42] and so it's let us build us a city and a
[22:45] tower
[22:46] and very interesting as i begin to study
[22:49] this how that they desired
[22:51] and
[22:53] i want to get to in a moment actually i
[22:55] realize now i took several scriptures
[22:56] out that we're going to show how god in
[22:59] genesis 1 28 wanted the world wanted the
[23:02] humanity to disperse
[23:04] and even in his commandment to know it
[23:06] it implied that there's this
[23:07] disbursement that you're to cover up and
[23:08] this place is referenced later in the
[23:10] scripture that's to to say that man was
[23:12] to fill up the earth and to go to these
[23:14] bounds and he had established these
[23:16] bounds and man was to go to it so they
[23:18] were going to be on this journey
[23:19] and i'm kind of getting ahead of myself
[23:21] here and by them saying you know what
[23:23] let's build because if you're on a
[23:25] journey you want to travel light right
[23:27] it was very it was uh very humorous to
[23:29] watch elliott pack for his very first uh
[23:32] youth camp he's going to
[23:34] and i thought well man will they allow a
[23:36] u-haul on the plane because
[23:38] and uh and i was like man i think they
[23:39] have a limit on checked bags and
[23:42] uh and it was it was i thought i was
[23:44] gonna have to buy another ticket just
[23:45] for his backpack to sit in the seat i'm
[23:48] a little bit of hyperbole there but he's
[23:50] wanting to bring a lot of stuff and i'm
[23:51] saying elliott if you could just i've
[23:52] been traveling for a few decades now if
[23:54] you could just learn from me i've got
[23:56] some pretty good ideas on how you can do
[23:57] this
[23:59] and we managed to get it all into a
[24:01] carry-on size uh bag
[24:03] and then micah shows up with well okay
[24:05] well maybe it was okay to bring a few
[24:06] bags and the biggest one you got
[24:08] uh he had an excuse because he was
[24:10] packing a whole sleeping bag and we
[24:12] arranged one for him in north carolina
[24:14] but if this idea would be like you know
[24:17] what maybe you shouldn't build a house
[24:19] out of bricks
[24:20] if you want to take it with you
[24:22] right right you know this idea that
[24:25] there's the permanence and something
[24:26] being established and
[24:28] what begin to this idea and this i kind
[24:30] of get lost in just my comfort tonight
[24:32] with you as family
[24:34] but
[24:36] this idea that's being conveyed here and
[24:37] i've been very moved by studying this
[24:39] maybe just personally as i've started
[24:40] studied this in depth and there's a lot
[24:42] of things maybe fun to fellowship on and
[24:44] it this may not be something that um
[24:48] would open up into preaching on this
[24:50] subject right now but there's the entity
[24:52] is being lifted up in this moment more
[24:54] than individual
[24:56] when they begin to say let us build us a
[24:59] city and a tower the entity if i could
[25:01] use this or the state or the church now
[25:04] becomes greater than the individual
[25:06] let's build something with walls and
[25:08] foundations and make this permanent and
[25:10] now we're all going to be sacrificed to
[25:12] the entity we're all going to be
[25:13] sacrificed to the state we're all going
[25:15] to be sacrificed to the government we're
[25:17] all going to be said come on
[25:19] yes get your pitchforks get your ars out
[25:21] right
[25:22] um
[25:23] there's this subservience then to the
[25:25] greater entity the sacrifice to the
[25:27] entity and so there's something there's
[25:29] this ambition to build something not
[25:31] just greater than the individual but
[25:33] that strips the individual from the the
[25:36] leadership in their own lives and their
[25:38] own individual identity to make the city
[25:41] and the tower that they're building to
[25:42] be preeminent
[25:44] it's very interesting we begin to look
[25:45] at kind of what the political agenda was
[25:48] or really what's taking place is whereas
[25:50] a man could take his family and he would
[25:52] be going forth to find a place where he
[25:54] could be positioned and he could be
[25:55] satisfied that he's found his lot and
[25:57] he's found his placing and he has this
[25:59] family there's kind of this idea of
[26:01] let's now forsake this leadership and
[26:03] come together to serve the city and the
[26:05] tower and it really begins to speak of
[26:07] something very different than what the
[26:10] mindset god wanted the people to have
[26:13] and it's not to say that building the
[26:14] city itself would have been wrong but
[26:16] the motive and the ambition behind it
[26:18] begins to expose a great air in their
[26:19] hearts and we'll see that as they they
[26:21] continue to talk about what they're
[26:22] wanting to accomplish and so where there
[26:24] might be state and government and church
[26:27] and and and certain uh higher or
[26:30] organizational structure
[26:32] it's fine so long as it doesn't
[26:34] sacrifice the individual
[26:37] it's fine
[26:38] as long as it doesn't strip away the
[26:40] individual leadership of the holy ghost
[26:41] in a person's life in in a family's life
[26:44] in a husband's life and his ability to
[26:46] lead the family and what you see
[26:47] beginning happening here is this lifting
[26:49] up of the state lifting up of the church
[26:51] lifting up of this entity and that
[26:53] becomes what is preeminent and what has
[26:55] to be served and what has to be
[26:56] sacrificed for it
[26:59] and so
[27:01] they are wanting to build a city and a
[27:04] tower with what the brick and stone and
[27:06] slime that they had
[27:08] come up with
[27:10] in verse 4.
[27:12] but then it says of abraham in hebrews
[27:13] chapter 11 verse 10
[27:15] for he looked for a city which hath
[27:17] foundations whose builder and maker is
[27:19] god
[27:21] wasn't the foundations that were wrong
[27:23] it wasn't the permanence that was wrong
[27:25] but abraham sought a city built by god
[27:28] whereas his his ancestors sought to
[27:30] build a city without god
[27:33] abraham's looking for a city that would
[27:35] have foundation something that's
[27:36] permanent but it's not let us build us a
[27:39] city it's a city that god has built for
[27:41] him
[27:43] it's a city that would be identified
[27:44] specifically with something eternal
[27:47] and this is the ideal
[27:49] that is being expressed by his ancestors
[27:52] let us build us a city
[27:54] and a tower whose top may reach unto
[27:56] heaven
[27:58] let us build us speaks of self-reliance
[28:01] whose top may reach under heaven speaks
[28:02] of self-preservation
[28:04] that now they're wanting to preserve
[28:06] themselves they want to achieve certain
[28:08] heights in order to avoid god's judgment
[28:11] because it's still very fresh in their
[28:12] minds you know the water raised up about
[28:14] yahai
[28:16] and so we could just build a city about
[28:18] yeah
[28:19] we're going to be all right like they're
[28:20] looking around and said see the
[28:22] watermark see how this was destroyed let
[28:24] us build us a city whose whose height
[28:27] may reach unto heaven and it wasn't so
[28:29] that they would merely have a spire that
[28:31] could be visible from hundreds of miles
[28:34] away but so that they could do it as a
[28:36] as a sign
[28:38] of
[28:39] surpassing god's judgment avoiding god's
[28:41] judgment
[28:43] and and so i think that's just a very
[28:45] simple uh simple point to make that they
[28:47] are wanting to avoid god's judgment
[28:49] whereas if we wanted and this is why i'm
[28:51] not maybe bringing the contrast
[28:53] uh it's uh
[28:56] in in detail as i would have liked but
[28:58] abraham in contrast is willing to yield
[29:01] himself to god's judgment and just do
[29:02] whatever god wants him to
[29:04] he's not looking to preserve uh
[29:06] completely totally preserve himself but
[29:08] ultimately he yields to god's plan
[29:11] and we see that there's actually a
[29:12] working out of these instincts
[29:15] from abraham because of this is what is
[29:17] in his ancestors so whose top may reach
[29:19] unto heaven this is their wanting to
[29:21] preserve themselves avoid god's judgment
[29:23] and let us make us a name
[29:26] this city and this tower is to be a
[29:28] monument of pride
[29:30] this was something that they wanted to
[29:32] establish permanent recognition of
[29:34] that just as the the so many things of
[29:37] our ancestors have been wiped out so let
[29:39] us build us a city and a tower that will
[29:42] be a monument of pride that will have
[29:44] eternal significance permanent
[29:45] recognition and this is their ambition
[29:48] let us build us a city and a tower whose
[29:51] top may reach unto heaven and let us
[29:54] make us a name
[29:57] self-reliant self-preservation a
[29:59] self-exaltation
[30:01] to to lift up themselves to make a
[30:03] monument unto themselves to have this
[30:05] accomplishment look at the city that we
[30:07] built look at this monument that the
[30:09] whole world looks to and it has this
[30:11] permanent recognition so what they
[30:13] wanted to do is establish an identity
[30:15] that no one would ever forget
[30:17] wanted to establish a name that everyone
[30:19] would always remember they wanted to be
[30:21] this center and this focal point and the
[30:24] genesis of all commerce and religion and
[30:26] that billions of people could look back
[30:28] one two one day and say that's where we
[30:30] began see the spire see the city see the
[30:32] tower that's our origin that's our
[30:34] genesis they wanted that to be the
[30:36] father
[30:38] and and think of who is now
[30:41] abraham
[30:43] how different it is that god allows this
[30:45] story to unfold because in genesis
[30:47] chapter 12 verse 2 it says and i will
[30:49] make of thee a great nation
[30:52] and i will bless thee and i will make
[30:54] and i'm adding that i will and make thy
[30:57] name great
[30:59] again notice the specific contrast see
[31:01] how those pieces fit together perhaps in
[31:03] opposition to each other says let us
[31:06] make a name for ourselves
[31:08] let us make us a name a reputation let
[31:12] us establish ourselves permanently
[31:14] before the people as this legacy that
[31:16] can be looked back upon and god now
[31:17] singles out abraham and notice how
[31:19] specifically it seems to be that god is
[31:22] contradicting the attitude of his
[31:24] ancestors and his family by saying i'll
[31:26] make you a great nation
[31:28] and i will make thy name great it's god
[31:32] now what they wanted to make of
[31:33] themselves god is singling out one man
[31:36] it's not a group thing it's not a state
[31:37] thing it's not this entity it's not this
[31:39] city in this tower but it's one man from
[31:41] which there's going to come a great name
[31:43] and a great nation and notice how
[31:47] again the the attitude of the people
[31:49] just unfolds even more let us make us
[31:52] build us a city and a tower whose top
[31:55] may reach unto heaven and let us make us
[31:57] a name
[31:58] this is kind of this is part of their
[32:00] whole
[32:01] uh
[32:02] inspiration lest we be scattered abroad
[32:05] upon the face of the whole earth
[32:08] let's do this
[32:09] lest that we be scattered
[32:12] this is their effort to prevent
[32:13] separation
[32:15] notice these different things that come
[32:16] cropping self-reliance self-preservation
[32:18] self-exaltation now they want to prevent
[32:20] separation
[32:22] and there's several scriptures we could
[32:24] have used we've alluded to this just
[32:25] several moments ago they're saying
[32:27] unless we're scattered abroad that right
[32:29] now we're all together and humanity's
[32:31] somehow amassed together in this valley
[32:33] in this plane in this area
[32:35] and why don't we go ahead and build
[32:37] something permanent this can become the
[32:38] hub let's all settle here let's all make
[32:41] this great and we're not allowed to
[32:43] leave and this is who will become this
[32:44] is what's going to be the focal point
[32:46] and it's and if you're not a part of
[32:47] this you're not a part of it and
[32:49] and let's establish something great here
[32:51] and let's not move out the rest of the
[32:54] world and they're doing this so that
[32:55] they could all stay together and that
[32:57] they wouldn't be separated but the most
[32:59] important thing to recognize is that
[33:01] they're rebelling against god's specific
[33:03] command to fill up the earth
[33:06] this is this is a this is a rebellion
[33:08] against a known command and even an
[33:12] instinct that god may have been placed
[33:13] inside of them that you're to disperse
[33:15] to go to the bounds and god has set the
[33:17] boundaries and god has set the bands and
[33:19] you want to go and disperse and spread
[33:21] out all over the whole earth and we'll
[33:23] find here in a moment when we read it
[33:24] again just to have these things click
[33:26] together as we go that that is what god
[33:28] wanted and so god accomplished it
[33:31] but they're doing it
[33:33] in rebellion against god they're
[33:35] building a tower to avoid god's judgment
[33:38] they're they're building it to the city
[33:40] to prevent separation they wanted
[33:42] permanence
[33:44] they wanted protection
[33:46] and so there's all these things that
[33:48] they wanted to achieve on their own
[33:50] now can you just can you see the
[33:52] contrast
[33:53] and this is why god put it in genesis
[33:55] chapter 11 in the beginning and then and
[33:58] then not that it's the chapter and verse
[34:00] that
[34:01] is so remarkable but genesis chapter 11
[34:04] first few verses genesis chapter 12
[34:06] first two verses and it's like
[34:08] these people and abraham
[34:10] the world and abraham humanity abraham
[34:13] the mindset of the society the mindset
[34:15] of the world this mindset of government
[34:18] and man and humanity what god wants to
[34:20] do in abraham and it provides a perfect
[34:22] contrast
[34:24] he said in genesis chapter 12
[34:26] 12 genesis chapter 12 verse 1
[34:29] well
[34:30] now the lord had said unto abram get
[34:32] thee out of thy country and from thy
[34:35] kindred and from thy father's house unto
[34:38] a land that i will show thee
[34:41] now this is i want you to zero in on
[34:43] this think about this allow your allow
[34:44] the holy spirit kind of push open some
[34:47] understanding expand some understanding
[34:48] brings or or bring some things into view
[34:50] to understand abraham's life in this
[34:52] greater context god called him out of er
[34:55] he says i want to get thee out of thy
[34:56] country he's called him out of ur and to
[34:58] haran
[35:00] then he's going to come out of her and
[35:02] toward canaan
[35:03] and begin to identify whereas they never
[35:05] wanted to be lest we be scattered abroad
[35:07] upon the face of the whole earth and
[35:09] we're moving around and we're going to
[35:10] permanence we want protection
[35:12] abraham never had a permanent address
[35:15] he's always having to change his mail
[35:16] forwarding
[35:17] and don't ever do it in newton north
[35:19] carolina you'll never get your mail
[35:21] i i've i was promised checks and all
[35:23] sorts of things i probably want to
[35:24] sweepstakes and i've never got it
[35:26] because they don't know how to afford
[35:27] mail in newton north carolina i feel
[35:29] like i've started all over in a witness
[35:30] protection program
[35:33] and and so abraham never had to worry
[35:35] about the postmaster in newton but he
[35:37] had a he had he never had a permanent
[35:39] address or maybe he really had to worry
[35:40] about it
[35:42] just a tip here i was told by the
[35:44] postmaster in phoenix when i was moving
[35:46] from here before
[35:47] that all i had to do is just forward my
[35:49] i didn't know where i was moving a lot
[35:50] like abraham glory
[35:52] um i didn't know where i was going and
[35:53] he said just do forward it to general
[35:55] delivery in the area where you're
[35:57] staying temporarily i'm like you're a
[35:58] smart man
[36:00] well they didn't have it in the area i
[36:01] was living in two months worth of mail
[36:04] gone
[36:06] so
[36:07] pray for me
[36:08] that happened 14 years ago it doesn't
[36:09] matter whenever it was
[36:11] but just a thought there as i was
[36:12] reading about permanent addresses so
[36:15] think about it abraham or abram as the
[36:17] bible says the the hebrew
[36:20] the one who crossed over from the other
[36:22] side
[36:22] and really never settles down is
[36:24] actually also is really abram the
[36:26] wonderer
[36:28] if you look at it in deuteronomy chapter
[36:29] 26 verse five i didn't just kind of pull
[36:31] that out in a scrabble match but it says
[36:34] and thou shalt speak and say before the
[36:36] lord thy god a syrian ready to perish
[36:40] was my father
[36:42] and he went down into egypt and
[36:44] sojourned there with a few and became
[36:45] their great a nation great mighty and
[36:48] populous now whether you're referring to
[36:51] uh
[36:52] jacob
[36:53] or um
[36:54] israel or or
[36:56] isaac jacob israel isaac or abraham and
[36:59] all the same
[37:01] in this sense that it's part of this
[37:02] lineage in this great history a syrian
[37:04] ready to perish was my father i want to
[37:06] come back to that and he went down into
[37:07] egypt and soldiered there with a few and
[37:10] became their nation great mighty and
[37:12] populist exactly according to what god
[37:13] said he would do
[37:15] but this statement a syrian ready to
[37:17] perish literally means a wandering
[37:19] syrian
[37:20] and nobody needs to change their name to
[37:22] a wandering syrian
[37:25] but here he is known and referred to
[37:27] this is exactly how
[37:29] god wants him to speak a syrian ready to
[37:32] preach a wandering syrian
[37:34] to perish was my father this is how that
[37:36] you're going to speak and this is how
[37:38] you're going to speak to god this speaks
[37:40] of abraham who is a nomadic shepherd
[37:42] very specifically speaks of abraham
[37:44] because he was a syrian by birth
[37:46] and here he is he's a wandering
[37:49] and this it's important to kind of
[37:51] recognize this aspect where in hebrews
[37:53] 11 excuse me in genesis chapter 11
[37:55] they're wanting to they have their own
[37:57] bricks they have their own slime they
[37:58] have their own plans they have their own
[38:00] architects they have their own labor let
[38:02] us build us a city and a tower
[38:04] permanence protection
[38:06] um central hub of traffic and and laws
[38:08] and governments and you see in that time
[38:10] period the code of harambee and nimrod
[38:13] and these great governments and cities
[38:14] that are all being built up it kind of
[38:16] had this reliance upon the entity
[38:19] reliance upon the state and reliance
[38:20] upon structure and government and
[38:22] economics but by making abraham nomadic
[38:25] it kept him in constant reliance on god
[38:29] kept him unsettled it kept him unsettled
[38:31] just enough to where he was always
[38:32] having to
[38:33] rely upon god and what happened is
[38:35] instead of a city or a church or man or
[38:38] a personality or or some kind of program
[38:42] that never could become central to
[38:44] abraham's life only god was the central
[38:47] center of his life you couldn't even say
[38:49] well here it was in this city here it
[38:51] wasn't this city god was the center
[38:53] and so if god moved he moved from hebron
[38:55] if god moved he moved from this place
[38:57] and that place because god remained the
[38:59] center of his life
[39:01] and he was put in a position where he
[39:02] needed to depend upon god's word he
[39:04] needed to depend upon god's leadership
[39:07] to find his placing to find his rest and
[39:09] to find success
[39:11] in the city of the tower of babylo of
[39:13] babel they just would have found their
[39:14] success in how thriving the entity was
[39:17] and how booming the metropolis was and
[39:19] how successful their crops were and how
[39:21] much they were growing how much commerce
[39:23] they achieved and all the taxes that
[39:25] were paid and how everyone lined up and
[39:27] got along
[39:28] and achieved this great accomplishment
[39:30] but now abraham could only find his
[39:32] success in the leadership of god he
[39:34] could only find success in this voice
[39:36] that was speaking to him driven by this
[39:38] unseen hand to do what he wanted to do
[39:41] and you look at his life and his
[39:42] wonderings of his life we would say this
[39:44] man never found a footprint a place that
[39:46] he could call home but as we did sunday
[39:48] morning we look back on him realize that
[39:50] god was using abraham for something very
[39:52] great
[39:54] consecrating the very ground of
[39:55] palestine
[39:56] consecrating the very places that his
[39:58] aunt his descendants would later visit
[40:01] somehow rescuing them from the curse of
[40:04] his ancestors
[40:08] it says by faith
[40:10] hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 and 10 by
[40:12] faith abraham when he was called to go
[40:14] out into a place which he should after
[40:16] receive for inheritance obeyed and he
[40:18] went out not knowing whether he went
[40:20] a wonder
[40:22] the wandering syrian by faith he
[40:24] soldiered in the land of promise as in a
[40:26] strange country dwelling in tabernacles
[40:28] dwelling in tents
[40:33] the difference you begin to one of the
[40:34] differences you begin to recognize
[40:36] between the people in genesis 11 which
[40:38] will be the same mass of people that
[40:40] abraham
[40:41] is a part of
[40:43] you begin to recognize a difference in
[40:45] dependence
[40:47] in genesis 11 the people are dependent
[40:49] upon themselves
[40:50] they're going to accomplish things on
[40:52] their own but then you begin to
[40:53] recognize the story that unfolds in
[40:55] abraham and we see it happening through
[40:56] many many different chapters that
[40:57] abraham was going to learn to totally
[40:59] depend upon god
[41:01] and not his idea of well what about
[41:03] eliezer's son and oh well what about my
[41:05] wife's suggestion that it'd be by hagar
[41:07] all these he had to come to a place
[41:09] where he completely and totally depended
[41:10] upon god
[41:12] so in verse genesis chapter 11 verses
[41:15] five to nine this is kind of god now
[41:16] zeroing in on what they're doing the
[41:19] lord came down to see the city in the
[41:20] tower which the children the men builded
[41:23] and the lord said behold the people is
[41:25] one it struck me how it uses the
[41:28] singular verb to describe the people
[41:29] this is how one they had become the
[41:31] people is one and they have all one
[41:33] language and this they begin to do so
[41:35] they started on this great plan with
[41:37] this brick and this mortar
[41:38] to build the city and the tower whose
[41:40] height may reach to the heavens
[41:42] and to keep them from separating being
[41:45] scattered abroad he says
[41:47] and now nothing will be restrained from
[41:49] them which they have imagined to do so
[41:51] god then
[41:52] this is god's attitude towards the
[41:53] people
[41:55] go to let us go down and there confound
[41:58] their language
[41:59] that they may not understand one
[42:01] another's speech
[42:03] this is this is god's dealing with
[42:05] humanity
[42:07] the last thing we see of how god deals
[42:09] with people before he deals with abraham
[42:13] now i want you to recognize just this
[42:14] vast difference that when they're all
[42:16] making this big huge mistake and trying
[42:18] to do something they shouldn't do god
[42:19] just confounds them
[42:22] they confound their language and
[42:23] separate so the lord scattered them
[42:24] abroad from fence upon the face of all
[42:26] the earth and they left off to build the
[42:28] city this is god's judgment because they
[42:29] can't understand one another anymore
[42:31] they can no longer do what they were
[42:33] wanting to accomplish and they become
[42:34] separated by their languages and they're
[42:36] divided amongst themselves and we begin
[42:38] to see in just a few chapters there's
[42:39] wars among kings different tribes and
[42:41] different powers and different things
[42:43] being coming
[42:45] coming to the surface verse 9 therefore
[42:47] is the name of it called
[42:49] babel
[42:51] because the lord did there confound the
[42:53] language of all the earth and from
[42:54] thence did the lord scatter them abroad
[42:56] upon the face of all the earth god had
[42:58] to use confusion
[43:00] in strife and disagreement and
[43:03] misunderstanding in order to get the
[43:05] people to spread out like he wanted them
[43:06] to
[43:08] and this is how god deals with the
[43:09] people with the self the selfish
[43:10] ambition and this attitude let us build
[43:13] us a city and make us a name and avoid
[43:15] the judgments of god and avoid from
[43:16] spreading out in rebellion against god's
[43:18] commandment and think about how
[43:20] differently god deals with them we're
[43:22] going to come down this is a move of god
[43:24] upon humanity he's going to confuse
[43:26] their language cause strife and division
[43:28] scatter them out of the whole earth and
[43:30] it's a judgment of god to interrupt
[43:32] their program and how differently god
[43:34] then begins to deal
[43:36] with abram
[43:38] that instead of god causing confusing
[43:41] confusion to motivate abraham instead of
[43:43] all sudden abraham walked waking up one
[43:44] day and going up to his dad saying hey
[43:46] dad would you like to have some
[43:48] breakfast and his dad hears abraham
[43:49] going
[43:52] he's like
[43:53] i don't wanna ha ha and abraham's like
[43:55] what are you what are you saying do you
[43:57] want breakfast and they can't
[43:58] communicate and it's like hey this is
[44:00] not gonna work we just need to separate
[44:02] it wasn't that that caused the
[44:03] separation abraham it's not frustration
[44:06] it's not also in the failures of these
[44:07] plans
[44:08] god is using get yourselves together all
[44:11] right you've heard the charlie brown
[44:12] teach your voice before it shouldn't
[44:13] confuse any of you
[44:15] but there's a uh there's such a
[44:18] difference in how god wants to deal with
[44:19] abraham now it's very personal
[44:22] god needs to correct the people in
[44:24] genesis 11 and they need to fulfill his
[44:26] word of dispersion all across the whole
[44:28] the earth and to the boundaries that god
[44:30] had established and so he uses confusion
[44:32] and strife and disagreement the
[44:33] interruption of plans where they're just
[44:35] kind of spread out with all these
[44:36] disagreements and all this upheaval but
[44:39] with abram he deals with the completely
[44:40] different says abram i will get up
[44:43] i want you to leave your father's house
[44:44] i want you leave your kindred i want you
[44:45] leave your country but i'll tell you
[44:47] where you're going later
[44:49] doesn't say in genesis 11 that god told
[44:51] any of them where they were going to end
[44:52] up they just ended up where they met
[44:54] where they ended up
[44:59] it is
[45:01] in this
[45:02] as we read in verse
[45:05] 1
[45:07] genesis 11 verse when it is from this
[45:09] plain in the land of shinar
[45:12] that the city and the tower of babel
[45:14] rose up
[45:17] and again i want to i want you to think
[45:18] about abraham now
[45:20] shinor biblically and was the country of
[45:23] two rivers the southern region of
[45:25] mesopotamia
[45:27] now i want you to think very
[45:28] specifically now
[45:30] of where
[45:31] abraham
[45:33] where this tower was built it says in
[45:35] genesis chapter 10 verses 8 to 10
[45:39] and cush begat nimrod
[45:41] and he began to be a mighty one in the
[45:43] earth
[45:45] he was a mighty hunter before the lord
[45:46] wherefore it has said even as nimrod the
[45:48] mighty hunter before the lord
[45:51] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[45:53] babel
[45:54] remember how it said in genesis 11
[45:55] therefore the name of it is called babel
[45:57] the beginning of his kingdom this man
[45:59] nimrod the beginning of his kingdom was
[46:00] babel and iraq and akkad and khalnay in
[46:03] the land of shinar in verse 11 it says
[46:06] and and he went forth with power
[46:09] and began to establish cities
[46:11] it's in the land of shinar where nimrod
[46:14] builds he begins to build these cities
[46:15] and the beginning of his kingdom is
[46:17] babel
[46:18] and shinar is the ancient name for the
[46:20] territory nader later known as babylonia
[46:24] or chaldea
[46:25] you see where i'm going with this and
[46:28] i'm going to stop on this because then i
[46:29] want you you get to the subject of
[46:31] babylon and
[46:34] right
[46:36] god called abraham
[46:38] while he was living in babylonia
[46:41] in the plane of shinar
[46:43] in er
[46:45] this is why god gives us the context
[46:48] of the spirit in the climate and the
[46:51] motive and objective in the mindset of
[46:53] the people
[46:55] in the plane of shinar in the city of ur
[46:58] of the chaldees
[47:00] because it's representative of babylon
[47:04] it's the place where the tower of babel
[47:06] was built this would have loomed large
[47:08] in the people's conscience this would
[47:09] have been something that was part of the
[47:11] uh of of their ancestry and part of
[47:14] their uh
[47:15] history and their geology the land of
[47:17] the entire babylon babel and it's the
[47:19] very place of babylon which means
[47:21] confusion
[47:24] and and i want to just i want to read a
[47:25] couple statements to close tonight and
[47:27] i'll lord when i'm very very excited to
[47:29] pick up on this on sunday
[47:31] and uh as a precursor to our picnic
[47:34] this subject to see what god is doing in
[47:36] abraham and just recognize it i know
[47:38] it's very very simple but this is what
[47:40] i've been building to in this and i
[47:41] think there's some wonderful things to
[47:43] recognize in the contrast but this is
[47:44] the most important uh
[47:47] thing that kind of raises up as it all
[47:49] comes together what we're reading about
[47:50] in genesis 11 is babylon
[47:53] we're identified as a babylonian mindset
[47:56] a character a nature
[47:59] a government a way of doing things
[48:02] and that's what god calls abraham out of
[48:07] we're thinking
[48:08] that we were the first to be called out
[48:10] of babylon
[48:11] no
[48:13] abraham was
[48:15] and that's why we are
[48:17] because he set the example
[48:19] in the message israel in the church part
[48:21] one this is a series i recommend
[48:23] it's one of those beautiful series if
[48:24] you're trying to think of something to
[48:25] listen to it's a very tremendous series
[48:27] to go back and listen to in 53 in march
[48:30] of 53 brother branham has been on the
[48:31] field preaching a lot for six or seven
[48:33] years he's kind of coming off the field
[48:34] and he says man i've been out there i've
[48:36] been looking at things and he preaches a
[48:37] series called israel in the church and
[48:39] he's shown the parallel as a prophet
[48:40] diagnosing the condition of the church
[48:43] world and how it parallel parallels the
[48:45] journey of israel and this israel the
[48:48] church a very
[48:49] very profound series of sermons and i
[48:51] that i recommend you listen to if you're
[48:52] looking for some listening something to
[48:54] listen to as you ought to be listening
[48:55] to the message
[48:57] it says israel in the church part one
[48:59] abraham coming from babylon with his
[49:01] father down into the valley of shinar
[49:03] where the souls of many journeyed after
[49:05] the destroying of babylon or the
[49:07] confusion taking place genesis 11 the
[49:09] tower of babel abraham's father parent
[49:11] brought abraham and his loved ones down
[49:13] into shinar in all that land among all
[49:15] those people
[49:16] one man found favor with god
[49:19] now i want you to notice
[49:20] that is the beginning of christianity
[49:23] of the church
[49:25] because what is god calling him out of
[49:27] out of babylon
[49:28] out of confusion
[49:30] out of this mindset and this lifting up
[49:32] a personality and lifting up a pretense
[49:34] and pride in all these monuments of
[49:36] self-preservation self-exaltation
[49:39] prevent separation self-reliance all
[49:41] these things that's wanting to take
[49:43] place within this structure of babylon
[49:45] that's what god calls abraham out of
[49:49] he says this is the beginning of
[49:50] christianity
[49:52] when did christianity begin
[49:54] the parallels are so striking it began
[49:57] when god called abram to get out of the
[49:59] country of what earth the land of the
[50:01] counties babylonia the plain of shinar
[50:03] the place of the entire babel come out
[50:05] of the confusion abraham
[50:07] and it's going to be a journey to a
[50:09] place that i will show you
[50:12] just several paragraphs later i think
[50:13] that was paragraph 42 this is in maybe
[50:15] in the 70s he says now abraham after
[50:17] coming out of the land the chaldeans the
[50:19] land the city of irv the chaldees or the
[50:22] of the chaldeans the land of shinar
[50:24] separated come out
[50:26] look at that just like christians today
[50:29] still wondering
[50:31] maybe it's not a wandering syrian
[50:34] wondering phoenicians
[50:36] right wondering human wondering
[50:38] christians we're wandering but not away
[50:41] from god not wondering and questioning
[50:43] god but there's still this journey he
[50:45] says just like christians today in the
[50:47] beginning of the christian church is it
[50:50] brother ram is bringing back before
[50:52] christ back before the day of pentecost
[50:55] he's coming all the way back to the
[50:56] example of abram and say the moment he
[50:58] called him out of ur in the land of the
[51:00] caldis from the plain of shinar away
[51:01] from the tower of babel out of babylonia
[51:04] he was beginning the christian church
[51:08] the beginning of christianity and he
[51:10] established this pattern of this journey
[51:12] what may seem to be just like christians
[51:14] today separating still wandering
[51:19] the patriarch abraham will close on this
[51:21] statement
[51:22] abraham was just an ordinary man wasn't
[51:24] something special
[51:26] god never called him as far as we have
[51:27] any record until he's 75 years old his
[51:29] wife which was his half-sister being 65
[51:32] years old at the time they'd probably
[51:34] lived together since they were very
[51:35] young and she was barren and had no
[51:37] children
[51:38] god called the complete separation
[51:41] to separate himself from the rest of the
[51:44] world and from all his people and from
[51:47] all of his kindred
[51:49] now
[51:50] before we think that this is just a
[51:52] prescription
[51:54] to separate from family
[51:55] remember the context is the babylonian
[51:58] mindset
[52:00] the context isn't just separating from
[52:03] there's this attitude well light can't
[52:04] have fellowship with darkness and it's
[52:06] this real arrogant projecting of
[52:08] revelation and we know more and
[52:10] understand more and this is why family
[52:12] members can't fellowship with other
[52:13] family members because they just have
[52:15] way too much revelation
[52:17] right and and they use certain
[52:19] scriptures how can two walk together
[52:21] except they be agreed and light can't
[52:22] have fellowship with darkness and
[52:23] abraham had to separate from his family
[52:26] but the division wasn't so much oh you
[52:28] got to cut yourself off from your family
[52:30] but it was god calming away from an
[52:31] attitude and a mindset and a spirit that
[52:34] probably sounded a lot like we know too
[52:36] much and we're too good for you and
[52:38] abraham was probably really happy to get
[52:39] away from the pretense
[52:42] the narcissism that existed long before
[52:45] we came up with the word
[52:49] i said god called a complete separation
[52:50] to separate him from the rest of the
[52:52] world from all his people from all of
[52:53] his kindred
[52:54] why why because babylon and then also
[52:57] there was a special thing for him to do
[53:00] and when god expects you to do a special
[53:02] thing he demands a complete separation
[53:03] from any doubt
[53:05] you've got to come to full obedience to
[53:07] obey what he says
[53:09] notice this god demands it continue the
[53:11] same statement you can't do it no other
[53:13] way
[53:15] and now he always sets an example and
[53:18] that was his example who abraham
[53:21] abraham was his example of a complete
[53:23] separation from all of his family all of
[53:25] his kindreds and so forth to walk a life
[53:28] separated to god
[53:30] there could not be this overbearing
[53:32] influence of personality and opinion
[53:35] and politics and pretense and this is
[53:37] the way we do it and this is how we want
[53:39] it done and this is what we're trying to
[53:41] achieve and we want to we want to have
[53:42] this certain persona and a certain image
[53:45] and and project a certain thing abraham
[53:47] had to be separated out of this mindset
[53:49] of babylon separated from this tower of
[53:51] babel ambition separated from the
[53:53] lifting up of human government and human
[53:56] state and human entities he had to be
[53:58] separated from that to walk a life
[54:01] separated to god
[54:04] and when people do that on their own it
[54:07] brings a harmony among the people not a
[54:10] forced agenda not a forced a union not a
[54:13] force getting together and we all try to
[54:15] find something that we can all agree on
[54:16] and we all kind of get along
[54:18] on this particular agenda but when we're
[54:20] all consecrated living separated lives
[54:23] to god it promotes the right kind of
[54:25] fellowship amongst us
[54:28] the right kind of unity
[54:30] and so where i i
[54:32] invite the musicians to come
[54:35] and i want i just want to close right
[54:37] there
[54:38] with what god called abraham out of
[54:42] was babylon
[54:44] and think about it
[54:46] and try not to preach it right now but
[54:48] think about it
[54:50] read in the book of jeremiah read in
[54:52] second kings read read in the old
[54:54] testament that when god wants to use
[54:56] something
[54:57] to punish israel for their disobedience
[55:01] they're taken out of the promised land
[55:02] and into where
[55:04] babylon
[55:07] exactly where they go why because that's
[55:09] the pattern it's what god called abraham
[55:11] out of to go into the promised land
[55:14] and when they forsook the covenant of
[55:16] god and forsook his commands it's as if
[55:18] god takes away the blessing
[55:20] and they're carried out of the promised
[55:23] land
[55:24] the kings bound and blinded and dragged
[55:26] into where babylon
[55:28] and made captives in babylon
[55:30] because it's what god established in
[55:33] genesis 11 and chapter 12 is look at
[55:36] babylon look at the attitude look at the
[55:38] politics look at the government look at
[55:40] the mindset look at how laodicean it is
[55:43] now
[55:44] and he said this is what i'm calling you
[55:45] out of
[55:46] let's stand tonight
[55:49] thank you so much for your pulling on
[55:51] the word of god your attentiveness
[55:53] wonderful spirit amongst us tonight
[55:56] thank you so much for allowing me that
[55:58] the privilege of just releasing
[56:01] releasing my burden to you
[56:04] if we could just bow our heads in a word
[56:05] of prayer sister and if you had
[56:06] something on your heart to play you just
[56:07] take that liberty
[56:10] if you have a need
[56:12] you can make it known by lifting your
[56:13] hand tonight to him
[56:19] and i have no doubt that he knows
[56:22] he's the god who sees
[56:24] [Music]
[56:25] and hopefully as we've been attempting
[56:27] to make the faith of abraham relatable
[56:29] you could realize yet again
[56:31] how
[56:32] personally
[56:34] your experience matches abraham's
[56:36] because what did he call you out of
[56:38] babylon
[56:40] called you out of confusion
[56:42] some of us have experienced separation
[56:44] in our family because of our obedience
[56:46] to truth and realize wow
[56:48] i have
[56:50] the faith
[56:51] of abraham with that faith quickened and
[56:53] kind of instigated and stirred up
[56:56] tonight could you accept him now for all
[56:58] that you have need of
[57:00] as a church there's things that we
[57:01] desire to see could we bind our hearts
[57:03] together to believe that god's going to
[57:04] give us provide us what we have need of
[57:08] there's ones that even though we're a
[57:10] young church we see things that take
[57:12] place amongst families or individuals
[57:14] and we desire to see god bring a
[57:16] restoration
[57:17] come upon the scene to benefit and to
[57:19] take hold and nurture and encourage
[57:22] let's lift these people before the lord
[57:24] tonight
[57:25] such a beautiful presence here
[57:28] such tremendous needs we have in our
[57:30] hearts lift your voice to him as you've
[57:32] raised your hands let's pray our
[57:33] heavenly father
[57:35] lord i pray tonight that as we stand in
[57:37] your divine presence that you would hear
[57:39] our cries
[57:41] as we join our hearts together
[57:44] individually consecrated to you and
[57:46] living a life separated to you lord we
[57:48] have this unity unique unity
[57:51] because of separation it is a paradox
[57:54] but in coming away from the world and
[57:55] lay out to see it coming away from our
[57:57] own ideas and certain things that bind
[57:59] and
[58:00] kind of get under
[58:02] pervert our view of things we found
[58:05] unity in separating
[58:07] i pray lord that as we have this unity
[58:09] of the faith tonight to believe all
[58:10] things are possible may you grant us
[58:12] this desire of our heart as a church to
[58:14] to have a more permanent facility to see
[58:16] god moving within families see the
[58:18] restoration of those who are lost and
[58:20] the further quickening of those that you
[58:22] begin to deal with
[58:24] or even things that we begin to
[58:25] experience in the beginning and
[58:26] fellowship that we had that might might
[58:28] seem to be a little bit distant now may
[58:29] you restore these things
[58:31] restore different loved ones and bring a
[58:33] greater unity and fellowship amongst us
[58:36] that's our desire
[58:39] and lord for the need that was
[58:40] represented by the hands that were
[58:41] lifted i pray now lord that you would
[58:43] heal sick bodies release encumbered
[58:45] minds
[58:46] lift up lord downtrodden spirits
[58:50] and may your presence be felt within our
[58:52] homes
[58:53] lord for one who has a divided home may
[58:56] your presence be felt
[58:58] and just as you came down in the life of
[59:00] abraham in a very clear way and
[59:02] articulate way begin to unfold your
[59:04] promise to abram within his household
[59:06] within his family may you do that within
[59:08] our households
[59:09] lord may we reject the notions of
[59:11] laodicean babylon and babel that come
[59:13] into our homes and we're all speaking
[59:15] different languages and this person's
[59:17] anti this and this person's provat and
[59:19] we seem as if we're speaking completely
[59:21] different languages can we not recognize
[59:23] it's because we have selfish ambition
[59:25] and we've allowed ourselves to come
[59:27] under the anointing of genesis 11 as
[59:29] opposed to the anointing of genesis 12.
[59:32] may we find that voice
[59:35] can bring us under one headship and gain
[59:37] a greater clarity lord
[59:39] and i commit the people to you believing
[59:41] that we will hear testimonies
[59:43] we will hear more praise reports as you
[59:45] did this wonderful work in the life of
[59:47] sister sandy lord cancer-free having
[59:50] manifesting that she had always been
[59:51] cancer-free lord i believe there's going
[59:53] to be more outstanding testimonies of
[59:55] deliverance from life-long disabilities
[59:58] and and ailments that have plagued and
[1:00:00] situations that seemed long gone i
[1:00:02] believe lord we're gonna have more
[1:00:04] testimonies
[1:00:05] so may we with the faith of abraham take
[1:00:07] our position and begin to walk through
[1:00:09] your promised word
[1:00:11] grant us a great peace tonight as we
[1:00:13] close our service bless your people
[1:00:15] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:00:17] pray
[1:00:18] amen
[1:00:20] amen god bless you
