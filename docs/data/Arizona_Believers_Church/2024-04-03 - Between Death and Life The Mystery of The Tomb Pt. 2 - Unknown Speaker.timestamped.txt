[0:00] I I'm going to continue on what we were
[0:02] ministering on Sunday morning I will
[0:04] give a little bit of a review so that
[0:06] we're all kind of on the same page and
[0:07] anyone who wasn't there uh won't be
[0:09] completely caught off guard but we
[0:11] ministered on between death and life and
[0:14] we were looking at the resurrection and
[0:15] the death of Christ and then his living
[0:17] after death and in that between death
[0:21] and life we were looking at the tomb and
[0:24] we called it the mystery of the Tomb
[0:25] we're just going to call this a part two
[0:27] kind of a continuation of the
[0:28] Resurrection story but then bringing it
[0:31] to where we are today with some themes
[0:33] and some types that are applicable to
[0:36] the resurrection that we're experiencing
[0:37] in this hour because brother brandom
[0:39] said that was a resurrection he said
[0:40] what a resurrection that was and he says
[0:42] what a resurrection this is and there's
[0:45] been another Resurrection out of
[0:46] Darkness another Resurrection out of uh
[0:49] death and we were using this uh quote
[0:52] from turn on the light and so the themes
[0:54] in Shalom and there's a man here who can
[0:56] turn on the light and some of those
[0:57] themes about light coming and thy light
[0:59] being here has been really inspiring to
[1:02] me in this subject he said God never
[1:03] speaks a word unless he's got a reason
[1:05] for speaking that word he's not like you
[1:08] and I that we just or especially myself
[1:10] that speak so many foolish things God
[1:12] speaks every word with a meaning and
[1:14] something that he's trying to achieve
[1:16] and will achieve by his word and it will
[1:19] perform exactly what he said it will do
[1:22] now we know that God interprets his word
[1:24] by bringing it to pass so when he says
[1:26] it'll perform exactly what he said he
[1:28] will do a lot of people wrestle with the
[1:30] black and white of the prophecy and
[1:32] reject the flesh that comes to fulfill
[1:34] the prophecy CU they get real hung up on
[1:37] the way something's worded not realizing
[1:39] that God's the one that is the one that
[1:41] interprets these things a and yet we
[1:43] believe it and we ought to believe it
[1:44] with all our heart I was uh going back
[1:47] over some things uh uh just over the
[1:49] scriptures where it's happened this way
[1:52] that it might be fulfilled and we saw
[1:53] some of that on Sunday and you go back
[1:55] and you could read some of those things
[1:57] that the Bible says in the prophecy and
[1:59] what takes place you realize wow I'm
[2:01] glad he's telling me that because we
[2:03] wouldn't necessarily been been able to
[2:05] put the two together but when God speaks
[2:07] something he's got a reason for speaking
[2:09] it and he speaks a word with the purpose
[2:12] to bring it to pass and that that's at
[2:15] the real core of those things we were
[2:16] looking at in the resurrection is why
[2:18] was it a tomb hollowed out of a rock and
[2:20] why was it a tomb that no man had ever
[2:22] laid in before and why was he wrapped in
[2:24] clean linen and all these specific
[2:26] details that are given to us we believe
[2:28] even if we don't quite catch it
[2:30] ourselves we just believe that God has a
[2:32] reason in doing that we used this
[2:36] concept and maybe I can work through
[2:37] this pretty quickly on a black box I
[2:39] just want to remind you of this uh very
[2:42] quickly he said a black box we looked at
[2:45] as a complex model or system uh that's
[2:47] not easily interpreted in other words
[2:49] you can't explain it you can you can see
[2:51] you can see what it produces but you
[2:53] don't know exactly how it produces it
[2:56] and and so it's something that's not
[2:57] easily understood uh or it's it's not
[3:00] straightforward and we looked at it from
[3:02] the standpoint that it's a system that
[3:04] can be viewed by the inputs that go in
[3:07] and the process that we results in but
[3:09] in the in between it's called the black
[3:11] box because you're just not exactly sure
[3:14] you know what goes in you see what comes
[3:16] out but you're not sure what's taking
[3:17] place behind that curtain to make it all
[3:20] come together and work and so that is a
[3:22] system that we view in terms of inputs
[3:24] and outputs but you don't really have
[3:26] knowledge or understanding of how that
[3:28] it works you could even say for some of
[3:30] us the our cars are a black box because
[3:33] we put gas in it and we start it we push
[3:35] the gas and we push the brake and it all
[3:37] seems to work but yet we don't
[3:39] understand the inner workings of of of a
[3:41] car but there's certain things that are
[3:43] a true Black Box where it takes very
[3:46] special knowledge or or an intimate
[3:49] understanding of the details in in
[3:51] behind the the structure to know how
[3:53] it's working and a black box it's they
[3:57] use that phrase black or opaque because
[3:59] you can't see it uh is one way they're
[4:01] looking at the light doesn't can't enter
[4:04] into it but it means also it's not easy
[4:06] to be understood even if you could see
[4:08] all the components you're not sure how
[4:10] they're interacting together to produce
[4:11] a result so we say the Box holds a
[4:14] mystery you see something before you see
[4:16] something after you can understand
[4:18] certain parts but I don't know how this
[4:20] works the internal workings I don't have
[4:22] understanding of how it produces it and
[4:25] that's what we're looking at there's a
[4:26] there's a mystery to it because the
[4:27] inner workings are a secret or they're
[4:29] hidden hidden so we looked at it this
[4:31] way Jesus Christ is verified according
[4:33] to scripture to be dead on the cross he
[4:36] dies the scripture give witness the
[4:37] Centurion Witnesses it pilate verifies
[4:40] it Joseph arthea takes the body down
[4:43] wraps it in clean linen uh and brings it
[4:46] to a grave he not of a stone H not of a
[4:48] rock in the side of a hill and and we
[4:50] see all these things and there's
[4:51] evidence clear evidence that he's dead
[4:53] he goes in the Tomb the stone great
[4:55] stone is rolled over the tomb it is
[4:57] sealed there's guards that are set watch
[4:59] and then the next thing we know he
[5:01] starts appearing and the only thing we
[5:02] know is that there's been an earthquake
[5:04] and the stones rolled away and the angel
[5:05] of Lord is saying he's not here and so
[5:08] what we don't see is the actual elements
[5:10] of that resurrection and the
[5:11] transformation from a body that was dead
[5:13] into a body that was alive so he enters
[5:15] the tomb dead and all of a sudden we
[5:17] find him outside of the Tomb alive and
[5:20] I'm looking at it from this standpoint
[5:22] there wasn't visible there was not
[5:24] Witnesses of that transformation from
[5:26] Death to life they saw life go to death
[5:30] on the cross he he he uttered cried out
[5:34] and then gave up the ghost it's finished
[5:35] and gives up the ghost so there's a
[5:37] witness of life into death but now death
[5:40] transforming into life the tomb hid that
[5:43] transformation so it's kind of this
[5:45] hidden Mystery between death and the
[5:46] life after death is in that black box is
[5:49] in that
[5:50] tomb and we looked at it from this
[5:52] standpoint that between death and life
[5:54] there was God there was the word and we
[5:57] could bring a lot of scriptures out in
[5:58] this way that stood there in in in that
[6:02] tomb as one that would preserve the body
[6:04] from corruption as a hiding place from
[6:06] that corruption and as the one that
[6:08] would raise him up from the dead and God
[6:11] is even that we could say in a way he's
[6:13] a black box he's not easily be to
[6:15] understood something where there's no
[6:16] clear explanation you just believe him
[6:18] something that's difficult to understand
[6:20] and explain uh he's
[6:24] unsolvable he he's he he's his thoughts
[6:26] are Beyond ours his way in the water we
[6:28] can't even see so it it it's God is that
[6:32] mystery that was there in behind the
[6:34] tomb that raised him from the dead the
[6:37] Bible says him Jesus Christ God raised
[6:39] up the third day and showed him openly
[6:43] and the the transformation from Death to
[6:46] life we don't see that take place but he
[6:48] does present the sun over 500 see him
[6:51] and he appears to his disciples he
[6:53] appears to Mary there's so much uh uh
[6:56] that is done in public after that but
[6:59] the tomb where he was laid was not just
[7:02] a place to lay his body but we were
[7:04] using it as a place that God could work
[7:06] it was a sacred meeting place a secret
[7:08] meeting place hollowed out of a stone
[7:10] hollowed out of a rock and in darkness
[7:13] in the Rock behind the stone God did
[7:17] something did something secret did
[7:19] something hidden did something
[7:21] unexplainable and you say well God did
[7:23] it and say well how did he do it you say
[7:24] well it' be by his word well how how did
[7:26] the word work there God said let there
[7:28] be light and there was light
[7:31] how and and what a scientist wants to do
[7:33] is say well his breath contained this
[7:36] and and those those chemicals in his
[7:38] breath interacted with these other
[7:40] elements and as they begin to collide it
[7:42] created a firmament and as it begin to
[7:44] burn it was this Perpetual cycle of
[7:46] burning and they'd want to be able to
[7:48] explain it but really we have to just
[7:50] say by faith we believe God created the
[7:51] heavens and the Earth it's kind of a
[7:53] mystery to us it's unexplainable but we
[7:55] know it was God it was God using his
[7:57] word and yet we realize that it's uh so
[8:00] we could see the word we could see the
[8:01] results but how it works God hides it
[8:04] it's
[8:06] unexplainable and so they in darkness I
[8:08] feel like we're all kind of on the same
[8:09] page and this is what I couldn't really
[8:11] some of these things is what I couldn't
[8:12] get to on
[8:13] Sunday but death is secretly
[8:17] reversed in the rock it was the
[8:21] resurrection of Jesus Christ in Isaiah
[8:24] CH 53:5 it says but he was wounded for
[8:27] our transgressions he was bruised for
[8:29] our iniquities the chastisement of our
[8:31] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[8:34] we are healed the resurrection was the
[8:38] guarantee of those things H it was it
[8:41] was the proof and the evidence that he
[8:43] was who he said he was and he was
[8:45] wounded for our transgressions bruised
[8:47] for our iniquities our peace uh was
[8:49] chastised upon him with his stripes we
[8:52] are healed and when he raises up Christ
[8:54] from the dead he forever consecrates a
[8:57] way that we could have that peace that
[8:59] we could have our sins forgiven that our
[9:01] iniquities would be washed away and our
[9:03] healing has been
[9:05] purchased and where therefore we have
[9:07] this promise in Romans chap 8: 10 and 11
[9:10] if Christ be in you the body is dead
[9:12] because of sin but the spirit is life
[9:14] because of righteousness but if the
[9:16] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[9:18] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[9:21] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[9:24] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[9:26] dwelleth in you so by his strife we are
[9:29] healed by his Spirit we are raised in
[9:32] the same way we are following in his
[9:34] steps a and that baptism of the Holy
[9:36] Ghost is the earnest of redemption it's
[9:39] a guarantee to us that we will be raised
[9:42] Incorruptible that just as he has a
[9:44] glorious body we will have a glorious
[9:46] body like unto his glorious body and now
[9:49] I realized I'm going to start just
[9:51] sandwiching maybe a lot of stuff
[9:52] together and and just stick with me if
[9:55] you could in the sermon who is this mzc
[9:58] and I I I made the intentional decision
[10:01] not to provide these quotations for no
[10:03] other reason other than I'd like you
[10:05] just to hear what he's saying and maybe
[10:08] not get lost in the reading because I
[10:09] may read faster uh than some of you or
[10:12] read slower than some of you uh can read
[10:14] on the slides so I just want to all of
[10:16] us stay together and focus on this and
[10:19] now brother Bram says and then when you
[10:21] become subject to that Spirit it throws
[10:23] your whole being subject to that spirit
[10:25] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[10:27] world but the seed word word made
[10:29] manifest or quickened Hallelujah Made
[10:33] Alive and when the Bible said don't do
[10:35] this the body quickly turns to it
[10:37] there's no question and what is it
[10:40] notice it's the earnest of the
[10:41] Resurrection I want you to catch this
[10:44] quickening power raised Christ from the
[10:45] dead it's that same spirit that dwells
[10:48] in you so we're just kind of pointing to
[10:50] the scripture and maybe I'm saying this
[10:52] just to for myself just to kind of have
[10:54] piece that these things link together
[10:55] and you're not just thinking brother
[10:57] Aaron's talking about his favorite
[10:58] vegetable again and nothing makes sense
[11:00] but that you just recognize some sort of
[11:02] connection here that in the Black Box we
[11:04] know was quickening
[11:06] power we may not know ex this exactly
[11:08] how it works we can't explain it but it
[11:11] met Christ there behind the stone and it
[11:14] raised him up according to the word
[11:16] according to prophecy now that same
[11:19] spirit is in Us by the baptism of the
[11:21] Holy Ghost and it's an Earnest that
[11:24] there'll be a resurrection so now
[11:26] there's got to be a connection to
[11:27] whatever was in that mystery box
[11:29] whatever was in that black box the body
[11:31] was raised up again because it's already
[11:33] start this body will be raised up again
[11:35] because it's already started it was once
[11:38] subject to sin andmed in corruption but
[11:40] now it's got Earnest it's turned
[11:42] Heavenly now that's the earnest that
[11:45] you're going in a Rapture praise the
[11:48] Lord Death means death just means a
[11:50] change of of dwell just a change of
[11:53] dwelling place for the moment here we
[11:55] are living in this world and it's a
[11:57] cursed Earth and it's a body that's uh
[11:58] dying and getting sick and could be
[12:00] healed uh only to get sick again but
[12:02] when you when you die you go into
[12:04] another dimension you go into another
[12:05] realm and your guarantee of a glorified
[12:08] body you've lived with all along if
[12:11] you've had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[12:13] amen he says a sick person
[12:16] laying it's the earnest a sick person
[12:18] laying dying nothing left but death
[12:20] that's all can happen it's seen as
[12:22] Shadows of people done eat up with
[12:24] cancer I've seen Shadows of people done
[12:26] eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and
[12:28] see them persons a little while after
[12:30] that perfectly normal and strong and now
[12:33] there he's kind of changing a little bit
[12:34] in his his his uh emphasis here the
[12:37] earnest of the Rapture is the quickening
[12:40] power that's in You by the baptism of
[12:41] the Holy Ghost and he says I've seen
[12:43] people eaten up with cancer and
[12:45] tuberculosis that uh a little after a
[12:48] while they're perfectly normal and
[12:49] strong they were on the doorstep of
[12:50] death and now they're not anymore he
[12:52] says if there's no Divine Healing then
[12:55] there is no Resurrection cuz Divine
[12:58] Healing is the Earth Earnest of the
[12:59] Resurrection we we focused a lot of this
[13:02] in the series Christ my healer so
[13:04] there's if there's no Divine Healing
[13:06] there's no Resurrection Divine Healing
[13:07] is the earnest of the Resurrection amen
[13:09] you know what the earnest money is don't
[13:10] you it's the down payment he was wounded
[13:14] for our transgressions with his stripes
[13:15] we are healed notice how wonderful we
[13:17] love him he says so this is now I kind
[13:21] of did a little bit of a Switcheroo
[13:23] Christ is dead and he's and he raises
[13:26] again and now that's the resurrection
[13:28] that's what took place in the Tomb
[13:30] that's the mystery of the Tomb we could
[13:31] call a resurrection we can see that he's
[13:33] alive and he was dead so he was
[13:35] resurrected from the dead that
[13:37] Resurrection guarantees our Salvation it
[13:41] purchased our Salvation it paid the
[13:42] price we're washed from our sins as we
[13:45] receive that atonement and then and so
[13:48] that's a resurrection the quickening
[13:50] power of the Resurrection lives in you
[13:51] it's a guarantee of a change of your
[13:52] body so then brother brandham says then
[13:55] Divine Healing
[13:57] now is an earnest or points to the
[14:00] change of our body or
[14:03] Resurrection brother Bram says Divine
[14:05] Healing has more to it than just Divine
[14:07] Healing this is in the sermon 10 virgins
[14:09] he says Divine Healing has more to it
[14:11] than just Divine Healing that's quite a
[14:12] mouthful he says this Divine Healing
[14:14] only says that there is a God who's
[14:16] coming
[14:17] again Divine Healing reminds you of
[14:20] fullness of redemption Divine Healing
[14:22] tells you that when you've got the Holy
[14:24] Ghost you have power in you to create
[14:26] another world and go live on it you've
[14:28] got power to change this body in a
[14:30] moment in a twinkling of an eye you just
[14:31] got to have the faith to allow it to
[14:33] operate says there's a God who's coming
[14:35] again other words there's a promise he's
[14:37] given that you will step out of the
[14:39] Grave or that your body will be changed
[14:42] says what does Divine Healing speak of
[14:44] it's the earnest of our Resurrection if
[14:47] there's no Divine Healing then there is
[14:49] no
[14:52] Resurrection so the mystery of the Tomb
[14:54] is a resurrection from Death to life
[14:57] which Divine Healing is is a constant
[15:00] reminder of that's what Divine Healing
[15:02] points to it points to a resurrection So
[15:05] Divine Healing is point is saying that
[15:07] there's a God who's coming again but
[15:09] it's connected to the God who came in
[15:12] his son and has sent his son to die and
[15:15] rose again so it points back to the
[15:18] resurrection and reflects towards
[15:20] another resurrection and that's what
[15:22] Divine Healing ought to
[15:23] represent if we ever start majoring on
[15:26] the minor of Divine Healing it's when we
[15:29] forget what it represents not only past
[15:31] but present and
[15:33] future points to
[15:36] something now this could seem to be like
[15:39] a maybe just a a real sharp turn but I
[15:44] want to look at the third pool and had
[15:47] we had the time on Sunday I think we
[15:48] could have uh just woven this together
[15:51] maybe a little bit better uh but I I do
[15:54] want to uh just take a sharp turn and
[15:57] talk about the third pool in con contion
[15:59] with this we saw how in his resurrection
[16:01] last year when we looked at this again I
[16:03] remember I know you guys remember every
[16:04] single word so I don't have to say very
[16:05] much about it uh that in the mystery of
[16:09] uh between uh hell and heaven the
[16:11] mystery of Christ Ascension and we're
[16:13] already working on next year's sermon
[16:15] sister Elizabeth wrote down the title
[16:16] for me so I could just start working on
[16:18] the
[16:18] mystery uh you know what it was out we
[16:23] saw how that in his resurrection the
[16:25] third pool was being manifested and that
[16:27] he went and preached to the souls that
[16:28] are eternal lost and there's a lot of
[16:30] that image of the third pool then in
[16:33] Christ Min Ministry that relates to the
[16:35] third pool in this hour and so I want to
[16:37] look at the third pool and that using
[16:39] that phrase third pool is very familiar
[16:40] terminology to us and we know that it's
[16:43] connected to the ministry of brother
[16:45] brandom and this is the phrases I want
[16:47] to talk about so you can see it it fits
[16:49] with this black box it won't be a public
[16:51] show can't be impersonated said don't
[16:53] tell the people don't try to explain it
[16:56] it'd be like looking at a black box and
[16:57] trying to describe what's behind it in
[17:00] the the sermon after he's given I we'll
[17:02] come back to the or origins of the third
[17:04] pull uh when he ministers the sermon is
[17:07] this the sign of the end sir he connects
[17:09] the third pool to the seven Thunders
[17:11] that bring back The Headstone and he
[17:13] says the mystery that would opened up to
[17:15] us that would bring Christ bring power
[17:17] to the church in that very sermon he's
[17:19] connecting the third pool to the seven
[17:21] Thunders to Revelations 10 and the Very
[17:24] fulfillment is as John the Baptist foran
[17:27] the first coming there's a lot of things
[17:29] he begins to tie together in that he
[17:30] talks about the pyramid constellation of
[17:32] the Angels so there's a lot there's a
[17:35] lot of material that we have in the
[17:36] message of the hour as it unfolded from
[17:39] the first time that he shares the
[17:40] concept of three PS to the time that he
[17:43] begins to say to us we now know what it
[17:45] is and what it does it's the opener of
[17:47] the word and he's very definitive about
[17:48] it are we all on the same page and isn't
[17:50] everybody just excited whenever you
[17:52] mention the third pole
[17:54] Glory now the the phrase three pulls are
[17:58] the concept of first pull second pool
[18:00] and third pool is introduced in the
[18:01] sermon why are people so tossed about
[18:05] and I'll maybe repeat this that
[18:08] terminology was the language that the
[18:09] angel of the Lord
[18:11] used and brother brandham as he's there
[18:14] uh and as he's sharing this on January
[18:16] 1st of
[18:17] 1956 he's explaining where he had just
[18:20] been he's and he's praying dear Jesus I
[18:21] don't know what I'm going to do here I
[18:23] am right back where I started from again
[18:26] I guess I made a failure remember he's
[18:29] going to ask for his old job back uh
[18:32] he's not going to be ministering anymore
[18:34] there's just he feels this is the low
[18:35] point or he's I'm a failure I'm back to
[18:38] where I started so here's someone's
[18:40] Ministry the trajectory should be a
[18:41] certain way and he's saying that he
[18:43] crashed he's burned he's burned out it's
[18:45] over uh and Billy Paul's you know say
[18:47] reasoning with him he's so discouraged
[18:50] but it's in this prayer it's after this
[18:52] prayer I don't know what I'm going to do
[18:53] I'm a failure I'm starting all over that
[18:56] the Lord appears to him and gives him a
[18:58] vis ision with multiple
[19:00] parts and and brother brandham tells of
[19:03] this multi-part Vision in great detail
[19:05] in the sermon what is a vision and this
[19:07] is just a few months later after this
[19:10] this is in April after why are people so
[19:12] tossed about and the first part I just
[19:16] want to go over this very quickly and
[19:17] the first part he's in a meeting with
[19:18] brother Argan brigh a and then he says
[19:21] it's at that moment where he's in this
[19:22] meeting with brother arganbright that he
[19:23] went farther into the vision to the next
[19:26] part and in that part he's trying to to
[19:28] lace a little baby shoe with a little
[19:30] bitty 1/8 inch uh eyelets with a/ in
[19:33] string so 8 in eyelet halfin string he's
[19:36] trying to lace that booty and he's he's
[19:39] making a mess and the angel Lord says
[19:41] don't you understand that you can't
[19:42] teach babies Supernatural things so here
[19:46] he was trying to thread a half inch uh
[19:48] um string through an eighth of an inch
[19:50] eyelet and it wasn't going to work and
[19:53] this is this is how he entered further
[19:55] into the vision that's the first part
[19:57] then the second part he's standing by a
[19:59] lake surrounded by a fishermen who are
[20:01] trying to catch small
[20:03] fish they're they're fishing they're all
[20:05] fishing they're trying to catch these
[20:07] small fish but brother bam thinks about
[20:08] catching a rainbow trout he wants to go
[20:10] after something different doesn't want
[20:12] small fish he wants a rainbow trout and
[20:15] remember brother Brown's Ministry is
[20:16] different than all these other fishermen
[20:18] so he picks up a rod and this is what
[20:22] the vision and this is all the same
[20:23] vision he says the he said when you do
[20:26] now let the lure sink down first pull it
[20:30] slow then when you do now you'll feel
[20:32] some nibbles at it but don't tell nobody
[20:35] what you're doing keep it to
[20:37] yourself you can see him cast it Allure
[20:40] into the water you know it's gone in
[20:42] behind the water and that he may show
[20:44] some movement but you can't explain
[20:47] what's happening in the water don't do
[20:49] it don't try to explain it they can see
[20:51] you're fishing but you don't tell them
[20:53] exactly what you're doing that needs to
[20:54] remain a mystery it needs to be
[20:57] unexplained he says keep it to yourself
[21:00] he says you'll fill some nibbles at it
[21:02] but don't tell anybody what you're doing
[21:03] keep it to yourself then when you fill a
[21:04] nibble again pull just a little bit but
[21:06] don't pull too hard and then it'll pull
[21:09] it away from the little fish and when
[21:12] they scatter that will attract the
[21:15] attention of the big fish and they'll
[21:17] grab it right that's the way you'll
[21:20] catch
[21:21] it then when they bite on the third time
[21:24] set your hook for the catch and I said I
[21:27] understand but he said but keep still
[21:30] don't tell nobody keep still brother B
[21:32] like oh I I get it what a great idea I'm
[21:34] going to cast it out there I'm going to
[21:36] kind of move it a little bit that's
[21:37] going to attract attention a lot of
[21:38] little fish are going to gather around
[21:40] it I I I'm going to just do it a little
[21:42] bit more and when I do that the fish are
[21:44] going to move away but it's going to
[21:45] attract something else so there's an
[21:47] attraction taking place unseen there's
[21:49] things taking place in an invisible
[21:52] realm and then brother brandham says
[21:55] that the ministers got all enthused and
[21:58] he began to explain it and he pulled too
[22:01] hard on that second
[22:03] one and we could get into some more
[22:06] details details about it but that that
[22:08] CH uh that he does what he shouldn't
[22:10] have done and the angel said to him just
[22:14] what I told you not to do and I said yes
[22:16] that's right he said you see and this is
[22:18] the language of the the angel that first
[22:21] pull was when you used to put your hands
[22:23] on the people and tell them what their
[22:25] trouble was the second pull was when
[22:27] You' know the secet secrets of the heart
[22:29] like I told you he says instead of you
[22:32] keeping that to yourself you tried to
[22:35] explain all about it and tell the people
[22:37] and when you did you didn't know nothing
[22:39] about it yourself and how could you
[22:41] explain
[22:43] it I mean really how could you explain
[22:47] it if it's if it's something
[22:49] Supernatural it's a temporary
[22:51] Resurrection if he's taking people by
[22:52] the hand and things are happening a and
[22:55] he's able to tell what happened and then
[22:56] he's able just to know what's in
[22:58] someone's heart how do you explain that
[23:01] except that it's
[23:02] God how how do you explain that and get
[23:05] into the nitty-gritty and the angel even
[23:06] says you didn't even know anything about
[23:07] yourself it's a black box to you you can
[23:11] see the results but you can't explain it
[23:12] and you've caused a bunch of carnal
[23:14] impersonations to rise up and you see
[23:16] what you've
[23:17] done so this is in that and this is the
[23:20] language of the Angel the first pool and
[23:21] the second pool and a pull is he uses
[23:24] the phrase pull he uses attract
[23:26] attention he's using the phrase to catch
[23:28] it set your hook for the
[23:30] catch and and and in that language
[23:33] there's something there's a hidden
[23:36] hook H uh there there is a there is a
[23:39] hidden purpose that's impossible to
[23:42] explain that was the first part of the
[23:44] vision lacing the booty then he's
[23:46] fishing and then the third part of the
[23:49] same
[23:50] vision the same vision which we know
[23:52] that brother Brandon was never literally
[23:53] lacing a baby's booty and disappointed
[23:56] the Lord we know that he wasn't actually
[23:57] fishing and caught a trout a fish that
[23:59] was just skinned Over The Lure and
[24:01] didn't actually make a mess of his line
[24:03] and everything literally and brother B
[24:05] was reminding him of that and chastising
[24:07] him for doing it or we know that he
[24:08] never actually did those things in order
[24:10] for it to uh come to pass or be a
[24:13] warning so it's all part of this same
[24:15] vision and he says about in this third
[24:17] part that he that it says to go higher
[24:19] and go way up was the language that he's
[24:20] using and he saw a great tent and a
[24:24] little room in the
[24:25] middle and again let me remind you the
[24:27] term pull and thease first second and
[24:29] third are the Lord's words now you're
[24:32] all message students your message
[24:34] Believers I trust that you're listening
[24:35] to these things yourselves so that
[24:37] you're not just hearing it from me for
[24:38] the first time or you haven't only ever
[24:40] heard it from me because then there's
[24:42] could be a lot missing for you until you
[24:45] hear it for
[24:46] yourself he says this in the sermon
[24:48] being led of the Holy Spirit now this is
[24:50] just that next month that he's
[24:52] explaining this and in this uh tent this
[24:57] great Cathedral where there's this
[24:58] little room he begins to describe this
[25:00] portion this way there was a nice smooth
[25:03] uh speaking gentleman stepped out and
[25:04] said now whether why brother brandom's
[25:06] resting a little bit will the line well
[25:09] the will the prayer line uh will line
[25:11] the prayer line up said you all with the
[25:13] prayer Cards begin in a certain place
[25:15] line up to my right so now here in this
[25:18] tent he says while brother bram's
[25:19] resting we're going to have a prayer
[25:21] line so people with prayer cards line up
[25:23] what are they lining up for they're
[25:24] lining up for that healing for that
[25:26] Divine
[25:27] Healing and he said said so I looked
[25:28] over that would be to my left where I
[25:30] was standing and there was a little
[25:32] building sitting in there little
[25:34] building that's built like that and all
[25:36] the people oh just look like went around
[25:38] the tent out of city block or great of
[25:40] people and they were all standing around
[25:43] there with their prayer card and just
[25:46] then I seen a woman in an ambulance
[25:48] stretcher was laying and a man behind
[25:50] her was on
[25:51] crutches so they were standing there
[25:53] waiting their turn and there was a lady
[25:56] taking down their names and things
[25:59] and then there was a canvas stretched
[26:00] here that no one could get around that
[26:03] tent says now I want you to watch this
[26:05] and listen how it is now so you watch
[26:08] the
[26:10] difference are you able to just kind of
[26:12] create this mental picture you can see
[26:15] there's a tent great Cathedral likee
[26:16] tent and brother bandam in other places
[26:19] describes it in great detail it was even
[26:20] something he desired to have himself and
[26:22] he wanted to replicate these things was
[26:24] a burden that he had uh to see these
[26:26] things done a a a and actually manifest
[26:29] in a very literal way and he's
[26:31] describing this great long line and he
[26:32] says there was one woman in an ambulance
[26:34] stretcher another man on crutches and
[26:36] there's someone there taking the names
[26:38] of these people a and so these are all
[26:41] things he can describe and he could see
[26:43] but he says I want you to listen and
[26:45] watch this now and watch the difference
[26:47] then I heard something whipping around
[26:49] were were were like that always goes
[26:51] every time we have a healing service so
[26:54] he's seen this same thing this healing
[26:56] service this worrying around he talks
[26:58] about the that light and different
[26:59] things in different places that's just
[27:00] what happens that's the way it's always
[27:02] sounded sounded that way in the bush
[27:04] that time when I heard it it's always
[27:06] been that way I felt it I heard it
[27:08] rather going moving and I looked and
[27:10] here was that real soft light moving
[27:12] away from me and went down and went into
[27:15] that little building this is a building
[27:17] inside of a tent this is a room I think
[27:19] in one place it says 12T x 20 foot uh so
[27:22] maybe a little bit bigger than sometimes
[27:24] we might imagine it but he said it's a
[27:25] little building it's a little room it's
[27:27] this a separate structure within a
[27:29] structure kind of like how the
[27:31] Tabernacle was laid out you have an
[27:32] outer Court you have an inner Court you
[27:34] have the holiest of holies that there's
[27:35] a in there in this thing that's laid out
[27:40] uh he said there was uh something
[27:42] different he says he said that little
[27:45] light went into that little building he
[27:47] says and then there's something
[27:49] different between the light and the
[27:51] angel because he was still there with
[27:54] me and the light had went into that
[27:57] building
[27:58] and this Angel still speaking behind me
[28:00] which is a big man and I like the
[28:02] capitalized man there he said I will
[28:06] meet you in there so it won't just be
[28:08] the light he said but I will meet you in
[28:11] there and we're on the same page there
[28:14] they're in a meeting brother B's is feel
[28:16] he's looking up above he's seeing all
[28:17] these things transpire that worrying
[28:19] light that had been with him in the
[28:20] first pool and the second pool been with
[28:21] him in all these prayer lines it goes
[28:23] into that little room and now the Lord
[28:25] says I'll meet you in there and brother
[28:28] Bram says so then I said I don't
[28:30] understand why in there he said
[28:35] watch I'm getting excited about
[28:38] this now we've been doing fantastic with
[28:42] time I'm probably be back to preaching
[28:44] at an hour
[28:47] again he says and we'll come to this in
[28:50] a moment but since you all famili I'm
[28:51] looking out and I see everybody here is
[28:52] a solid message believer that knows
[28:54] these things has Revelations of these
[28:56] things and strong convictions in these
[28:57] things
[28:58] we know that one of the constant
[29:00] consistent them about the third pull
[29:02] that really comes into uh being an
[29:04] impression when he preaches the Seven
[29:06] Seals it won't be a public show don't
[29:08] try to explain
[29:10] it so it means it's going to be
[29:13] something hidden or
[29:15] unexplainable it may be observed in
[29:18] terms of inputs and
[29:20] outputs but really what it is is hidden
[29:24] really what it is is a
[29:26] secret now let's just look at a few
[29:29] places where brother Branham talks about
[29:30] a public show before this this the
[29:35] terminology is used in this Vision that
[29:37] he had brother brandom in one place is
[29:39] in a prayer line he said here's the
[29:40] patient but you're standing here like a
[29:42] public show Almost oh what will take
[29:45] place what will be the decision of this
[29:47] woman standing here the worrying of the
[29:49] light would have been here with them
[29:50] right there in the prayer line he said
[29:51] this is the way it's been in the healing
[29:53] service and he would stand on the
[29:54] platform and he'd take a hold of their
[29:56] hand and he would know what their
[29:57] problem was or or he would know in the
[29:58] second pull that he would very discern
[30:00] the very thoughts of their heart so
[30:02] those are all the same Dynamics he's
[30:04] saying these things were a public show
[30:06] here's a woman standing here in the
[30:07] prayer line like a public show another
[30:10] place he's praying won't you father
[30:12] please don't hold it against me to try
[30:14] like this would be a public show but
[30:16] Lord bless this dear woman and give her
[30:18] this great witness as she's watching my
[30:20] hand reverently KN one that her life is
[30:22] just a few more days unless that will
[30:24] help her so here he's saying I'm holding
[30:26] her she's watching my hand this cancer
[30:29] whatever it is May it go away so she can
[30:31] know that she's healed he says don't I I
[30:33] know don't hold it against me that it's
[30:36] public that it's going to be a public
[30:38] show or others are going to
[30:39] see and he says this to another lady he
[30:42] says I want you lady to be patient to
[30:44] watch you're the one that has the cancer
[30:46] once again prayer line an audience on
[30:49] the platform public stage says you're
[30:52] the one that has the cancer and he says
[30:53] our heavenly father thou knowest all
[30:55] things and I know that I'm not here
[30:56] trying to make a public to display Your
[30:59] Divine gifts but here he is so this is
[31:02] that language that he's
[31:04] using and and and he's it's on the
[31:07] platform now you can't necessarily
[31:10] explain the vibration in his hand but he
[31:12] could say there's the vibration and you
[31:14] can see it uh he's actually Discerning
[31:17] someone's thoughts in in their heart
[31:18] he's going back into their past he can
[31:19] see into their future he knows their
[31:21] very their name and where they live and
[31:23] that's broadcast it's expressed out
[31:25] there those are the things that in that
[31:27] first first pull and second pull the
[31:28] angel Lord is saying hey you've
[31:30] explained too much you've tried to tell
[31:32] the people and you didn't even know it
[31:34] about yourself so then brother Brown
[31:36] when he's describing this third part of
[31:38] the vision he says I seen that light
[31:40] leave me and go to that building and go
[31:42] in that building and a voice say I'll
[31:43] meet you in there that'll be the third
[31:45] pull I said why he said well it won't be
[31:48] a public show like the
[31:50] other so it goes into this room because
[31:53] it will not be a public
[31:56] show
[31:59] trust we're all on the same
[32:01] page so now let's back up just a little
[32:05] bit in that same place I was just
[32:08] reading and being led of the Holy Spirit
[32:10] and I looked and here went that real
[32:12] soft light moving away from me and went
[32:15] down and went to that little building
[32:17] and then there's something different
[32:19] between the light and the angel CU he
[32:21] was still there with me and the light
[32:23] went into that building and this Angel
[32:25] still speaking to me which is a big man
[32:28] and he said I will meet you in there so
[32:31] then I said I don't understand why in
[32:34] there he said
[32:37] watch so now this is Brother Bram is
[32:41] going to watch so that he can get
[32:43] understanding of what's
[32:45] transpiring to understand why in there
[32:48] and this woman when she come out of
[32:51] there on the ambulance stretcher so she
[32:54] went in there on an ambulance stretcher
[32:56] right yes ma'am so when he's describing
[32:59] this he says she's coming out she was
[33:01] pushing the stretcher out the other side
[33:05] this is exactly what brother Brown
[33:06] begins to describe it's something he
[33:08] even leaves out when he said it the
[33:10] first time and I get the feeling that he
[33:12] did it because he realized don't explain
[33:14] too much so he tells some of it and he's
[33:16] thinking uh kind of paint myself in a
[33:19] corner here maybe I shouldn't say too
[33:20] much maybe he's wondering how much do I
[33:22] share how much should I say so when he
[33:23] tells it this time he begins to share
[33:26] things that he didn't say the first time
[33:28] and he says that I'll meet you there
[33:31] that will be the third pole I don't
[33:33] understand so the Lord doesn't
[33:34] necessarily explain it he just says
[33:37] watch and you can pick up on
[33:40] something he says I want you to as he
[33:42] said I want you to kind of notice there
[33:44] and to see these things there there's
[33:46] something uh there's something
[33:48] different and so he says watch this
[33:51] woman that was laying on the ambulance
[33:52] stretcher goes into the little room on a
[33:55] stretcher but when she comes out she's
[33:57] pushing the stretcher Jesus went in the
[34:00] Tomb wrapped in clean Linens fresh
[34:02] Linens laid on a stone behind his Stone
[34:05] and he comes out free loose
[34:09] alive she's pushing the stretcher on the
[34:11] other side and she said the lady that
[34:13] was taking the names and writing things
[34:15] down the lady asked her what
[34:18] happened and saw the woman that went in
[34:20] on the ambulance stretcher she said I
[34:23] don't
[34:24] know it just happened
[34:28] she said I've been in this stretcher
[34:30] I've been down in bed for
[34:33] years but I went into the room sick I
[34:37] went in the room bound I went in the
[34:39] room dead and nobody saw it nobody can
[34:43] explain it nobody knows how it happened
[34:45] but now I'm pushing the thing I laid on
[34:48] on the other side and the lady wants to
[34:50] tell me what happened explain it to me
[34:52] explain it to me explain to me what
[34:53] happened explain to me what it means and
[34:55] I say I don't know all I know I was dead
[34:58] all I know I was crippled oh I know I
[35:00] didn't have health and now I'm pushing
[35:02] the very thing that I laid on explain it
[35:05] to me I can't but I'm
[35:08] alive and here come the man out packing
[35:11] his
[35:12] crushes and they asked him what he said
[35:16] he didn't
[35:17] know and he was coming to the platform
[35:19] to
[35:20] testify you see that it's real simple
[35:24] this is just as simple as what we were
[35:25] saying on Sunday something's happening
[35:27] in that room unexplainable unseen but we
[35:30] know the man's there we know Christ is
[35:33] there it's a meeting place and people go
[35:36] in sick and they come out
[35:39] well the sermon what is a vision he says
[35:42] this he says well I noticed the prayer
[35:43] line I'm just going to add a little bit
[35:45] more body to this we're going to be
[35:46] wrapping this up here pretty soon so if
[35:48] you want me to preach longer you going
[35:49] have to pull harder so I noticed the
[35:52] prayer line seemed like it went all
[35:53] around the tent and out and down the
[35:54] street such a prayer line and I looked
[35:56] over which was this to my left and that
[35:58] would be to my right if I was standing
[35:59] on the platform would be that way
[36:02] there's a piece of canvas stretched
[36:03] there and in behind this canvas was a
[36:06] little square building about 12T across
[36:09] and 20 foot long something like that
[36:13] well I stood and looked at that and I
[36:15] seen them bringing a lady upon a
[36:17] stretcher and there was a lady taking
[36:19] her name and things on a paper and so
[36:21] there was someone come and got her and
[36:23] pushed her through now what I love about
[36:25] this is someone could record their name
[36:27] their sickness their condition and
[36:30] everything wrong and the next man come
[36:32] through with his crutches and I see them
[36:34] go through that little
[36:36] building they enter in and he says and
[36:39] on the outside the lady come out
[36:41] screaming to the top of her voice
[36:43] pushing this stretcher and then there
[36:45] was another lady on the other side
[36:47] looked kind of like a dark-haired woman
[36:49] and she said what happened and she said
[36:52] I just don't
[36:54] know she said I couldn't tell you what
[36:57] happened
[36:58] I've been paralyzed for 20 years and
[37:00] looky I feel like I was never
[37:02] sick oh you talk about a healing you
[37:05] talk about a change I was paralyzed for
[37:08] 20 years and I feel like I was never
[37:10] sick and just didn't come out the man
[37:12] leaping and jumping with his crutches in
[37:14] his hand and I looked at that now here's
[37:17] something notice close there was a
[37:19] difference between the angel of the Lord
[37:21] and that light because I heard something
[37:23] a moving and as it does when it comes
[37:25] here on the platform at night kind of
[37:26] like brother makes a sound like a fire
[37:29] whipping around licking Blaze and it
[37:31] left me and went right down over top of
[37:33] that audience and went down and stood
[37:35] over the top of the little building then
[37:36] it settled down on top of it and then
[37:39] when it did this one that was standing
[37:41] by uh by me behind me the same voice the
[37:45] Angel's voice he said I will meet you
[37:48] there and this is the third pole but
[37:51] nobody will know anything about it I
[37:54] said well I don't understand why in
[37:56] there why there he he said it will not
[37:58] be a public show this time people will
[38:01] go in behind the veil people will go in
[38:03] behind the canvas people go in behind
[38:06] the little room behind the tent they'll
[38:08] go in there and they'll be changed and
[38:10] they won't be able to explain it you'll
[38:13] just have to experience it for
[38:18] yourself coming back to that sermon
[38:20] being led of the
[38:22] spirit he said' I don't understand that
[38:25] in there
[38:28] he's still saying it after it
[38:31] happened said I'll meet you there it
[38:33] won't be a public show brother BR still
[38:34] saying I don't understand that in
[38:37] there I I I I'm not quite picking up
[38:39] what's
[38:40] happening he says and
[38:43] watch here's always script he it's
[38:46] always
[38:48] scriptural he said are you listening
[38:50] it's
[38:51] 807 in and out it's not going to be
[38:53] crowed by the time you get
[38:55] there did not our Lord say when thou
[38:58] prayest be not like the Hypocrites that
[39:01] like to make a show now this is the
[39:04] Angel Lord connecting what's taking
[39:05] place in that little room to
[39:08] scripture and said enter into the secret
[39:11] closet and when you've done so close the
[39:15] door then pray to the father that seeth
[39:18] in secret and he that seeth in secret
[39:20] shall reward thee
[39:22] openly that's that's the that's what the
[39:25] scriptures want to see when thou prayest
[39:28] enter into your closet enter into the
[39:31] secret place where the Lord is and the
[39:33] Lord which is hidden the Lord which is
[39:35] unseen he will reward thee openly so
[39:38] there will be there will be a
[39:39] Vindication there will be a culmination
[39:42] there there will be something happened
[39:44] that's going to be a final separation
[39:46] but you've got to enter into the secret
[39:47] place
[39:49] first says you remember that name that
[39:51] you were hunting that time that you
[39:53] dreamed about and I said yes he said
[39:56] I'll meet you in there in this time it
[39:59] won't be a public Show and The Vision
[40:01] left
[40:03] me this is the scripture he's connecting
[40:05] to this little room this building this
[40:07] calls it a square and then he describes
[40:08] it as 12T across 20 foot long this
[40:13] is this is the scripture that the angel
[40:15] Lord is placing on that third pool which
[40:18] is the third part of that singular
[40:20] Vision enter into your
[40:24] closet and close your door
[40:28] brother Brandon when he's preaching the
[40:29] sermon humble I think it's humble
[40:32] thyself he says ow in order to do this
[40:36] I'm expecting something to happen in a
[40:38] prayer
[40:40] meeting is connected even to these uh
[40:44] the scripture right the prophecy and
[40:46] many of you remember the vision of the
[40:48] last pull that third
[40:49] pull you remember there was something
[40:52] happened just before
[40:54] that I seen that light com and go down
[40:57] to that place and said I'll meet you
[40:59] there now I'm looking for something to
[41:02] happen why because he's
[41:04] there something's going to happen can
[41:06] you explain it no but he's going to do
[41:08] it who raised Christ from the dead God
[41:10] did how did he do it by quickening power
[41:13] what what stood there the word prophecy
[41:14] we you see all these things that that
[41:16] fit this uh the the way that we can
[41:18] begin to kind of look at some of the
[41:20] material but yet we can't explain what
[41:22] God
[41:24] does and now brother Brandon makes this
[41:26] statement we've already mentioned it
[41:28] before but I I want you just to pick up
[41:30] on this and catch this as we try to turn
[41:32] the corner on this and finish it up he
[41:34] says his spoken word will be Vindicated
[41:37] when the son of righteousness shall rise
[41:39] with healing his wings he's preaching
[41:40] Shalom this is the end time the son of
[41:42] man will be revealed these things are
[41:45] going to take place and the healing part
[41:47] there will not be a physical healing as
[41:49] you think as saying somebody's got a
[41:51] sickness it'll be taken away from him he
[41:54] said that's what he's doing now in type
[41:57] yeah yeah that's what he's doing now in
[41:59] type so the type of Divine Healing is
[42:02] just pointing to this healing that's
[42:04] going to take
[42:05] place the the Divine Healing in this
[42:08] Vision there was a Divine Healing a
[42:10] woman paralyzed on a stretcher she comes
[42:11] out walking pushing the stretcher a man
[42:13] with crutches shouting Hallelujah and
[42:15] he's healed what was it it was Divine
[42:17] Healing what does Divine Healing speak
[42:20] of a resurrection what was that what was
[42:22] it a type of what that we saw on the
[42:24] other side the quickening power of the
[42:26] Resurrection what could we conclude
[42:28] that's in there cricketing power to
[42:30] snatch them from Death to life God is
[42:34] using the example of Divine Healing to
[42:36] speak of this great truth that's
[42:38] somebody's got a sickness that's taken
[42:40] away he said he's doing that now as a
[42:42] type but the whole creature will be
[42:45] changed this Mortal will take on
[42:47] immortality this old age will jump into
[42:51] youth Hallelujah I'm anxious for that
[42:54] time when this old age is going to jump
[42:56] into you
[42:58] oh that word that you're feeding on
[43:00] right now that word inside of you that
[43:02] new body is going to materialize around
[43:05] the word that's inside of you right now
[43:07] the world can't see it but it's
[43:09] happening I may not be able to explain
[43:11] it but it's going to
[43:16] happen that healing in this Vision spoke
[43:21] of it was Divine Healing in the vision
[43:24] and regardless however you want to
[43:26] interpret it we know that Divine Healing
[43:27] points
[43:29] to the
[43:31] resurrection and the sermon again what
[43:34] is a vision I just want to repeat this
[43:35] phrasing because it's where he connects
[43:37] these thing together he said I don't
[43:39] understand going into the closet like
[43:41] that why and he said is it not written
[43:43] by our Lord when thou prayest be not
[43:46] like the
[43:47] Hypocrites who like to be heard before
[43:50] men but enter into the secret closet and
[43:53] pray to the father who seeth in secret
[43:56] and he who seeth in secret shall reward
[43:58] thee openly brother brandom says it's
[44:00] perfectly to the scripture every time it
[44:03] is and I said I
[44:07] understand it's exactly what he said
[44:09] right when he was fishing I understand
[44:12] but he made a mess of it right those are
[44:14] his own words he but now this one thing
[44:18] he knows I've got to be
[44:20] faithful and when you listen to brother
[44:22] Brandon preaching the seventh seal and
[44:24] he goes through these very things again
[44:26] and he's saying he told me he would meet
[44:28] me in there and he said that will be the
[44:30] third pull and then he says and just the
[44:32] other day he said this is the third pull
[44:35] and brother B he's sharing this he even
[44:36] comes to a place where he feels like
[44:37] I've gone too far I've got to stop and
[44:40] he was so careful even that week he was
[44:42] so careful he even makes a comment there
[44:44] I was in a little room every day uh the
[44:47] angel met me in that little room he says
[44:49] and giving him the revelation of these
[44:51] things and brother man was so careful
[44:52] with his language because now he says I
[44:54] understand this has got to be a secret
[44:57] meeting
[44:58] yeah Matthew 6: 5-6 and when thou
[45:02] prayest Thou shalt not be as the
[45:05] Hypocrites are for they love to pray
[45:08] standing in the synagogues and in the
[45:10] corners of the streets that they may be
[45:12] seen of men verily I say unto you they
[45:16] have their
[45:17] reward but thou when thou prayest enter
[45:20] into thy closet that's a secret room
[45:22] it's an inner chamber says where the
[45:25] father and when thou shut the
[45:28] door pray to thy father which is in
[45:30] secret which is hidden thy father which
[45:32] seeth in secret shall reward thee
[45:36] openly enter into a secret place it's an
[45:40] inner chamber his brother Bram was
[45:42] looking at the this great tent this
[45:46] Cathedral even when he he's fishing on
[45:48] the bank there's a lot of preachers all
[45:50] around him but they can't see what's
[45:51] happening under the water he's got
[45:52] understanding he's got instructions he's
[45:54] supposed to fish a certain way when he
[45:55] makes a mess of it the angel takes him
[45:57] higher goes into this Cathedral like
[45:59] place this great tent and then inside
[46:01] the tent which is populated by many
[46:03] people from the public it's going down
[46:04] around town he says there's a little
[46:06] room in there that people with prayer
[46:08] cards are entering
[46:10] into and it's it's a secret place what
[46:13] that it's a it's hidden from view it's
[46:15] not a public
[46:18] show and even this Greek word that's
[46:20] used for closet it's used of a store
[46:22] room where Treasures are
[46:24] kept it's a special private place place
[46:27] and there's a lot of commentary on just
[46:30] even how there would be special rooms um
[46:33] at the top of a house that would be
[46:35] hidden that wouldn't be accessible
[46:36] necessarily to the public but it would
[46:37] be a cooler place a little bit higher
[46:40] place and even God speaking in Isaiah CH
[46:43] 26:20 because it says but thou when thou
[46:46] prayest enter into thy closet and when
[46:48] thou H has shut the door it's got to be
[46:49] sealed off he says come my people enter
[46:53] thou into thy
[46:55] Chambers and shut th doors about thee
[46:58] hide thyself as it were for a little
[47:00] moment until the ignation be overpassed
[47:03] there's judgment that striking the West
[47:05] Coast there's judgment that's striking
[47:07] Leo DEA the word of God is coming and
[47:10] pronouncing judgment declaring those
[47:12] that are filthy that'll remain filthy
[47:13] there's judgment but while this wrath is
[47:16] coming job said oh that thou would has
[47:18] hide me but we're not being hidden in a
[47:20] grave we're being hidden in a chamber in
[47:23] a secret place enter into the chamber
[47:25] shut the door out the and hide as it
[47:28] were for a little
[47:30] moment while these things are coming to
[47:32] pass in Psalms 31:20 says Thou shalt
[47:35] hide them in the secret of thy presence
[47:37] from the pride of man Thou shalt keep
[47:39] them secretly in a pavilion from The
[47:41] Strife of
[47:43] tongues to keep them to secret it's the
[47:46] secret of his presence I think that
[47:48] would be just the best way to describe
[47:49] it it's the secret of his presence
[47:51] brother Bram said my Ministry is a
[47:53] little bit different my Ministry is this
[47:54] to declare him that he's here I'm not
[47:57] like all these other fishermen on the
[47:58] bank trying to catch a small fish I've
[48:00] got to catch something in particular I'm
[48:02] not going to fish in a way to attract
[48:04] all the little ones but even the way all
[48:06] fish will scatter a lot of people but
[48:08] it'll catch the rainbow
[48:09] trout it'll get the ones that I'm called
[48:12] to amen Thou shalt keep them secretly
[48:16] that speaks of a covering or a hiding
[48:19] place to hide
[48:22] them in his
[48:24] presence as he tells them in Isaiah shut
[48:27] to enter into thy chamber and shut the
[48:30] doors withdraw from leod DEA enter into
[48:34] a safe
[48:35] place not out in the open not publicly
[48:40] known not explainable not
[48:44] disclosed for in the time of trouble he
[48:46] shall hide me Psalms 27:5 this is his
[48:49] Rapture text for in the time of trouble
[48:50] he shall hide me in his
[48:52] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[48:56] shall he hide me the
[48:58] Tabernacle the temple and even in the
[49:02] way that it's laid out there was a
[49:03] secret place a Most Holy place there was
[49:06] a tabernacle within a
[49:08] tabernacle there was a temple within a
[49:10] temple so in the secret place of the
[49:13] temple in the secret place of the
[49:15] Tabernacle shall you hide me he shall
[49:18] set me up upon a
[49:22] rock to call it the secret of his
[49:24] presence to hide be hid secretly in a
[49:26] Pavilion he's going to hide me in his
[49:28] Pavilion and the secret of his
[49:29] Tabernacle denotes that innermost place
[49:30] a privileged place a secret place that
[49:33] Pavilion it speaks of a
[49:35] booth Thou shalt set me up upon a rock
[49:39] musicians if you'd like to
[49:43] Come Thou shalt set me
[49:48] up it's a
[49:51] setup I love
[49:53] it set me up upon a rock
[50:11] there's so much more that we could
[50:12] express
[50:23] here let me just put this in here maybe
[50:27] I'll amplify this a little bit more at
[50:29] later
[50:30] time it's a secret place in the secret
[50:34] of his
[50:35] presence he's going to hide me in his
[50:37] Pavilion his little room in his his
[50:39] place where he is it's going to be a
[50:42] privileged to do this not everyone's
[50:43] invited
[50:46] there when thou
[50:49] prayest enter into a secret place shut
[50:53] the door and commune start looking at
[50:55] what prayer is
[50:57] commune with the father in
[50:59] secret it's not a public show it's not
[51:04] explainable When We Gather here as a
[51:07] church it's open to the
[51:10] public when we
[51:12] preach it's it's digested even by the
[51:14] public people stream people can come
[51:16] people can visit the word is preached
[51:18] but these are all things that are
[51:20] observed people can record what's being
[51:23] said people will they'll transcribe it
[51:26] they'll dissect it they'll do all sorts
[51:28] of things with these things that are
[51:29] public they do the same thing with
[51:30] brother braham's Ministry and the things
[51:32] that he said but there's a secret hidden
[51:35] part why do you speak to us in
[51:38] Parables it's just the nature of
[51:40] God they're not obvious on their
[51:46] face and on that day that Christ
[51:52] [Music]
[51:55] died
[51:57] he was taken down from that cross he was
[52:01] dead Joseph of arthea craved the body of
[52:04] Jesus he begs for it and takes him down
[52:06] and his dead body wraps him in clean
[52:09] linen would be wrapping him tightly
[52:11] preparing him for barrial he's air
[52:14] affirmed
[52:15] dead takes him into a
[52:19] rock going to hide him in a Clift of a
[52:22] rock get hide him in a place in the side
[52:24] of a hill he out of a rock lay a great
[52:26] Stone in front of it the Stone's going
[52:29] to be
[52:30] sealed but hidden from view nobody else
[52:33] around to be able to see it though
[52:35] there's guards posted out watch and
[52:36] there'll be a lot of people later on
[52:38] that'll witness the effects of it there
[52:40] in the darkness hidden from view Jesus
[52:42] Christ is raised from the dead by the
[52:45] quickening power of God that's the
[52:49] resurrection when those people went into
[52:51] that little room and they were changed
[52:54] on the other side that's Divine Healing
[52:55] what does it remind us of what took
[52:57] place behind the stone what took place
[53:00] in that
[53:01] rock brother Brandon brings us to this
[53:04] very place this is just kind of teaching
[53:06] some things here at the close just kind
[53:07] of putting these things together he
[53:08] takes psalms 27 he says Thou shalt hide
[53:12] them in the secret of his
[53:15] Tabernacle he shall set me up upon a
[53:18] rock a man for man shall be a hiding
[53:21] place a covert from The Tempest as a
[53:25] rock in a and thirsty land as a hiding
[53:27] place that's what he is brother Bram
[53:30] says in the sermon Shalom again this is
[53:33] just coming back this is another place
[53:34] where he's preaching this coming back to
[53:36] there's a man here can Turnal light this
[53:38] theme of Shalom thy light has come I
[53:41] like the way David speaks that The Rock
[53:44] you notice so many times God Is My Rock
[53:48] you know what a rock is referred to in
[53:49] the Bible rock is a revelation like
[53:53] Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son
[53:54] of the Living God he said blessed art
[53:56] thou Simon son of Jonas Upon This Rock
[53:59] This revelation God revealed it to me
[54:01] Flesh and Blood never revealed it to me
[54:03] but my Father which is in heaven Upon
[54:05] This Rock This Revelation I will build
[54:08] my church and David here crying out God
[54:11] is my rock my Revelation you can't give
[54:15] an explanation to Revelation there's got
[54:18] to be the inspiration and stimulation of
[54:20] Revelation to understand it we could
[54:22] point to the process we could say I was
[54:24] an unbeliever I was sick I was confused
[54:27] I was caught up in denominationalism but
[54:29] then we start to use a language well
[54:31] then an eagle screamed then The Light
[54:33] Came my way then I Heard a Voice then I
[54:35] was born again and we're just trying to
[54:37] use a language to explain the
[54:39] unexplainable but what happened the like
[54:42] Christ I met the man and I was
[54:47] changed he's my
[54:49] Revelation that cannot be
[54:52] explained
[54:54] there's I think there's a tendency we we
[54:56] want to explain
[54:58] things people want to explain to
[55:03] them i' much rather God just give the
[55:09] Revelation it's a secret thing it's a
[55:12] hidden thing what is that rock what does
[55:15] a rock represent
[55:17] Revelation what is he setting us on in
[55:19] this Rapture cycle a
[55:22] rock hidden in the Clift of a rock
[55:25] that's where I
[55:27] stand on Christ the solid
[55:30] rock power over
[55:37] death consider these things think about
[55:39] these things
[55:40] yourself this is the message of the hour
[55:44] and I'm not ashamed of any of
[55:46] it I'm not ashamed of any of it you
[55:49] could try to preach this message not
[55:51] using quotes you could try to preach the
[55:53] message well we're just going to stick
[55:54] with scripture that you know that
[55:57] there's those that may try that there's
[55:58] ways that maybe you could do it but you
[56:00] know what I know my
[56:02] audience I'm preaching a mess as
[56:04] Believers I'm PE preaching to people who
[56:07] are being set upon a
[56:08] rock and I want to be faithful to my
[56:11] calling so you be faithful as the hungry
[56:14] you be faithful as the as the chosen who
[56:17] are chosen to meet you be faithful as
[56:19] the ones that pray to H to have that
[56:21] secret meeting with this isn't this
[56:24] isn't it right right we didn't even
[56:27] close the doors tonight got all of them
[56:29] open well maybe not all of them but
[56:31] we've got but it's you personally with
[56:33] him communing
[56:35] fellowshipping and and what's happening
[56:37] in there is changing you and the world
[56:39] is witnessing it and they're asking you
[56:42] what happened and you find it hard
[56:44] sometimes to explain what's happening
[56:46] don't you find it hard sometimes to
[56:48] explain what's happening but you know
[56:49] it's happening it's happening it's
[56:52] happening in you you know it you can't
[56:54] explain it it's different why it's him
