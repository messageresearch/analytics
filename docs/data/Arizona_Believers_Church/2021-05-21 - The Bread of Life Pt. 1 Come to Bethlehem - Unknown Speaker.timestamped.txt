[0:00] ruth chapter 1 verses 19 to 22.
[0:07] so they too went and this is ruth and
[0:10] naomi
[0:11] and i understand a little bit of the
[0:13] back story maybe ourselves having read
[0:15] it
[0:15] many times so they went they too went
[0:18] until
[0:18] they came to bethlehem and it came to
[0:21] pass when they were come to bethlehem
[0:24] that all the city was moved about them
[0:25] and they said is this naomi
[0:28] she said unto them call me not naomi
[0:30] call me mara for the almighty half dealt
[0:32] very bitterly with me i went out full
[0:35] and the lord had brought me home again
[0:37] empty why then call you me naomi seeing
[0:41] the lord have testified against me
[0:43] and the almighty hath afflicted me so
[0:46] naomi returned
[0:47] and ruth the moabitess her
[0:49] daughter-in-law with her
[0:51] which returned out of the country of
[0:52] moab and they came
[0:54] to bethlehem in the beginning of barley
[0:57] harvest
[0:58] amen you may be seated just to make a
[1:01] few
[1:02] comments here at the outset in terms of
[1:04] what
[1:10] what my title is we've been speaking on
[1:12] being hungry and hungry and
[1:14] hungering and thirsting after the things
[1:16] of god and
[1:17] him quenching our thirst and different
[1:19] aspects and elements of being hungry
[1:21] and i've been struck by the statement
[1:23] inspired by the statement
[1:25] how that brother brown teaches us that
[1:27] in the rapture message that the shout is
[1:30] a message
[1:30] he's very clear about it's a message
[1:32] it's the message it's a messenger
[1:34] and he uses the phrase it's the living
[1:36] bread of life
[1:37] bringing forth the bride and so i've
[1:40] been pondering
[1:41] the bread of life the living bread of
[1:43] life and i've been studying in the book
[1:45] of ruth and
[1:46] have a real desire to look at some
[1:48] specific things in the book of ruth as
[1:50] it provides
[1:51] many wonderful types that help us
[1:53] understand what's transpiring
[1:55] in the time that we're living in even
[1:56] help us to understand how our lives have
[1:58] unfolded
[1:59] um in the message and so i'm starting
[2:02] with
[2:03] the bread of life and i think there'll
[2:04] be a few parts in this at least
[2:06] and maybe a couple parts on come to
[2:09] bethlehem and that
[2:10] come to bethlehem is more of an
[2:12] invitation and a welcoming to come to
[2:14] bethlehem
[2:15] and as we read it mentioned a couple
[2:17] times here in ruth and hopefully we'll
[2:19] have time
[2:20] to touch on it a little bit at the end
[2:22] how her and naomi
[2:24] came to bethlehem and they came to
[2:26] bethlehem
[2:27] at the beginning of barley harvest now
[2:30] if you'll take your bibles i'd like to
[2:31] begin with
[2:32] revelations chapter 3 verse 20
[2:35] and we've pointed out this scripture a
[2:38] few times already in the last few
[2:40] services so i feel that
[2:41] we can just jump right into this and
[2:44] begin
[2:45] with this we understand the condition of
[2:47] laodicea
[2:48] and how they tout themselves as being
[2:51] well furnished and well supplied and not
[2:53] neces
[2:53] not needing anything and having no
[2:55] necessities that we're lacking
[2:57] but then the lord himself judging their
[3:00] condition and saying that they're
[3:01] actually poor and blind and they're
[3:03] miserable and wretched and naked and
[3:05] they don't know the condition that
[3:06] they're in
[3:08] he's giving them counsel of what they
[3:10] can do to remedy their situation
[3:13] and this verse here to me is very
[3:14] important for us to understand as
[3:16] message believers
[3:17] he says behold i stand at the door and
[3:20] knock
[3:21] if any man hear my voice and open the
[3:24] door
[3:25] i will come into him and will sup with
[3:27] him and he with me
[3:29] it's important for us to see what this
[3:31] verse represents
[3:32] when we look at laodicea there's a lot
[3:34] of scriptures that we look at and we can
[3:36] become very familiar with
[3:38] and we feel that we've understood them
[3:39] we've placed them and we under
[3:41] we can identify just exactly how the
[3:44] spirit is speaking to the condition of
[3:45] the age
[3:46] how the spirit is speaking how that they
[3:48] can repent even how the lord speaks in
[3:50] terms of
[3:51] to the overcomer i'll grant to sit with
[3:53] me in my throne there's a lot of
[3:55] elements that we understand
[3:56] but this verse is very important for us
[3:58] to understand
[4:00] what it represents because it signals a
[4:02] change in dispensations
[4:04] and as you reading through each church
[4:06] age you see a compliment you see it
[4:07] admonishment
[4:08] and you see these different things that
[4:10] god is dealing with in the church ages
[4:12] there's a messenger
[4:13] a message to the angel of laodicea but
[4:16] this
[4:16] pronouncement behold i stand at the door
[4:19] knock if any men hear my voice
[4:21] there's nothing like this in any other
[4:23] age
[4:24] and it come in at the end of the seventh
[4:25] age it has a very special significance
[4:28] because there's a change
[4:29] in dispensations and we hear the phrase
[4:33] a lot dispensation and i think the
[4:34] question's even been asked of me
[4:36] different times in the past or i've
[4:38] actually seen it submitted and
[4:40] questioned and answers what does
[4:41] dispensation
[4:42] mean and i think it's easy for us to
[4:44] think oh well dispensation is a time
[4:46] period
[4:47] but there really there's really a
[4:49] greater significance to it than just a
[4:51] time period
[4:52] in the scriptures to use the phrase
[4:54] dispensation speaks of a
[4:56] a god's ordering or divine ordering of
[4:58] worldly affairs
[5:00] god's setting in order worldly events
[5:02] and events that take place
[5:04] i can even be spoken of a dispensation
[5:06] could be god's ordering an arrangement
[5:07] of someone's life
[5:09] so a dispensation scripturally if we
[5:12] it's
[5:12] something that god does it's something
[5:14] of god's doing it's it's a
[5:16] a plan of management or it's a
[5:18] particular
[5:19] administration so for changing
[5:21] dispensations then god is ordering
[5:23] things
[5:24] differently or there's a different kind
[5:25] of administration
[5:27] as we know that there's uh there's a
[5:29] gift there's one spirit but there's
[5:31] different administrations of that same
[5:32] spirit
[5:33] it speaks to the same thing and in the
[5:36] rapture message
[5:37] brother branham says we are changing
[5:39] dispensations
[5:40] we're at a corner so if we know that
[5:42] we're coming to the end of the church
[5:43] ages we know that we're coming to the
[5:45] end of time
[5:46] then you have to recognize something
[5:47] shifting something's changing
[5:49] and that there's come a time of changing
[5:51] there's a transition that's taking place
[5:53] and you could say the same thing in uh
[5:55] in egypt at the time of the exodus that
[5:57] here they had been
[5:58] slaves for hundreds of years but at the
[6:00] time that god is now going to lead them
[6:02] out when that process begins you could
[6:04] say
[6:05] well there's been a change in
[6:06] dispensation because the events that are
[6:08] taking place today
[6:10] are not to further our enslavement or to
[6:12] prepare us
[6:13] to hold on and and sojourn in egypt for
[6:15] another 100 years
[6:17] but there's events taking place that are
[6:18] going to lead to our exodus out of
[6:21] egypt and in a journey that ought to
[6:23] have ended very quickly into the
[6:24] promised land
[6:25] there was an exodus out of egypt into
[6:27] the wilderness
[6:28] and that was a change of administration
[6:30] change of a dispensation
[6:33] and so we've entered into if we're it at
[6:36] a time where we're turning a corner
[6:37] there's been a change in dispensations
[6:39] we've entered into a distinct time where
[6:41] god administers his word
[6:43] or administers a particular word brings
[6:45] prophecy to past
[6:47] in order to fulfill a specific purpose
[6:50] just as prophecies were coming to pass
[6:52] at the time of the exodus and moses was
[6:54] coming and there were signs and wonders
[6:55] that were given
[6:56] that was because now god was working to
[6:58] bring them out not to keep them enslaved
[7:01] but now he's working to bring them out
[7:02] so god we've entered a time where god is
[7:04] going to administer or bring his word to
[7:06] pass
[7:07] in order to fulfill a specific purpose
[7:09] in this season that we're living
[7:12] and so god we can read this to
[7:14] understand if there's a change in
[7:15] dispensation
[7:16] god is going to develop his purpose and
[7:18] reveal himself to man in a different way
[7:22] he's going to unfold his purpose reveal
[7:24] himself to man
[7:25] in a different method or a different way
[7:26] that's what it means it's the same god
[7:29] it's the same word but now he's coming
[7:31] in a particular way to fulfill a
[7:33] particular promise
[7:34] if we just looked at and this is where i
[7:36] think instead of just looking at
[7:38] dispensation as a time period
[7:40] but looking at in relation to god and
[7:42] how he's revealed himself and the
[7:43] purpose
[7:44] that he has in in in your life and the
[7:46] purpose that he would have with his
[7:47] church
[7:48] uh this word dispensation if we just
[7:51] looked at it in our english language it
[7:52] means
[7:53] the act of dispensing or dealing out so
[7:56] if a
[7:56] dispensation actually has the idea of
[7:59] dispensing or handing out or giving out
[8:01] it means to disperse or administer or
[8:03] distribute
[8:05] and in the scripture the greek word
[8:07] that's translated to dispensation it
[8:09] means management of a household
[8:10] it's actually translated also to
[8:12] stewards
[8:13] and this was kind of my inspiration that
[8:15] eve i think even began me kind of
[8:17] looking in this area
[8:18] how that we are to be as paul claimed
[8:21] himself to be a steward of the mysteries
[8:23] we are stewards of the mysteries and to
[8:25] be a steward of the mystery i think
[8:27] sometimes
[8:27] maybe this was just my own fault so if
[8:30] as i share this you go
[8:31] silly silly brother aaron for thinking
[8:33] that but um
[8:34] it was almost as if you're a guardian of
[8:36] the mystery we're stewards so we're
[8:38] we're keepers of it we're protectors and
[8:40] we kind of had this image of one
[8:42] standing at the door trying to keep
[8:43] people out
[8:44] right we're protectors of the mysteries
[8:46] and we're stewards of the mystery so i
[8:47] ruled this house i
[8:49] i'm governed in this house i'm a
[8:50] protector of the flock and i have to
[8:52] watch out and i have to do these things
[8:53] but to be a steward of the mystery
[8:55] is it's a dispensation so you have a not
[8:58] only is it just a government
[8:59] over it but it's not to protect it but
[9:02] it's to distribute it
[9:04] you're a student of the ministry in
[9:05] order to dispense it to god's people
[9:07] and to share it with the people so that
[9:09] they can be beneficiaries of it
[9:10] so in the in the greek to be to have a
[9:13] dispensation
[9:14] it's the administration of a property
[9:16] it's the management of a household
[9:18] and the greek word that's used okonomiya
[9:21] is actually the word we get in our
[9:22] english economy from
[9:25] so so now i want you to start thinking
[9:26] about this because i think this is just
[9:28] beautiful
[9:29] when you begin to think about an economy
[9:31] and how a stewardship or an economy or a
[9:33] dispensation the economy
[9:35] is just the the careful management of
[9:36] resources
[9:38] and how resources are distributed earth
[9:39] how things are produced and how those
[9:41] things are good
[9:42] and services are exchanged so an economy
[9:45] is the wealth and resources the goods
[9:47] and services
[9:48] of a particular country or region so now
[9:51] if god is talking about a dispensation
[9:53] for his church it's not just a
[9:55] time period but it has to speak of a
[9:57] particular government
[9:58] a word that is governing a prophecy that
[10:01] has been fulfilled
[10:02] a divine order that is settling upon his
[10:05] people
[10:05] and it speaks of an economy so i like to
[10:08] think of it this way god has changed the
[10:10] economic conditions for his bride
[10:12] he's changed the economic conditions of
[10:14] his people and so whereas the economy
[10:16] would relate to the production and
[10:18] consumption of available goods and
[10:21] services
[10:22] in the natural we can begin to identify
[10:24] that in the spiritual
[10:25] there is a certain production of goods
[10:27] and services there's a consumption of
[10:28] goods and services
[10:29] and the bride has an economy she's
[10:32] living according to a different set of
[10:34] rules she's living according to a
[10:35] different
[10:35] anointing a different government even a
[10:38] different government and administration
[10:39] unfolding other than what has been
[10:41] before because god's spirit has to meet
[10:44] the challenges
[10:44] of the time that we're living in now and
[10:48] so there has been a change in the
[10:49] economic conditions of god's people a
[10:51] dispensation
[10:52] is an economy it is the resources that
[10:54] are being made available it's services
[10:56] that are being made available
[10:58] it is god and an act of dispensing his
[11:01] word
[11:02] to fulfill a particular purpose and so
[11:05] when it says behold i stand at the door
[11:07] and knock
[11:07] this is i'm wanting to recognize this is
[11:10] a change
[11:11] in the way that god has spoken to the
[11:12] other church ages
[11:15] i stand at the door and knock
[11:18] now i know that we've read the scripture
[11:20] before and we've heard really good
[11:21] teaching
[11:22] on this but i want you to ponder a
[11:25] little bit about what this means
[11:28] christ knocking at the door calling
[11:32] to those that are on the inside the
[11:34] image is that christ is on the outside
[11:36] trying to get someone's attention
[11:38] right if he's behold i stand at the door
[11:42] and knock
[11:42] you you're not knocking on even the
[11:44] languages that suggest that there's one
[11:46] who would hear
[11:47] a knock in and respond to the voice you
[11:50] wouldn't do this
[11:51] as a group right he's not just trying to
[11:54] play a trick on whoever's in the house
[11:55] knocking and running to entertain the
[11:56] people that are around them
[11:58] he there's someone on the other side
[12:00] christ is by himself
[12:01] knocking on the door so there's those
[12:03] that are inside now this could be used
[12:05] in an evangelistic way to appeal to the
[12:07] center to get them to consider that
[12:09] christ is knocking on the door of his
[12:10] heart
[12:11] and and i wouldn't object to that use at
[12:13] all but it's not only a an appeal that
[12:15] could be used as an appeal to the sinner
[12:17] uh to receive christ as their savior uh
[12:20] not only could it be used as an
[12:21] invitation to salvation
[12:22] what you have to recognize that
[12:24] literally in this scripture and the
[12:25] primary meaning of the scripture
[12:27] is that it's a direct address to the
[12:29] apathetic condition of the laodicean
[12:32] church
[12:33] they're they're they are lukewarm they
[12:35] they're arrogant they're self-satisfied
[12:37] they're complacent
[12:38] they're neither hot nor cold and so in
[12:40] this condition
[12:41] christ is now addressing their condition
[12:44] so you realize that the church is in
[12:46] this condition and now christ symbolizes
[12:49] himself as standing at a door and
[12:50] knocking
[12:51] to those that are on the inside it this
[12:54] apathetic condition
[12:55] has created this separation from christ
[12:59] to where now he's knocking trying to get
[13:01] someone's attention to call him out of
[13:02] that condition
[13:04] and so this is this is exactly what this
[13:06] scripture stands for
[13:07] christ is on the outside of the church
[13:10] and
[13:11] christ um this church has abandoned the
[13:14] word
[13:14] this church has rejected christ and
[13:16] having abandoned the word and rejected
[13:18] christ
[13:18] christ is now on the outside knocking
[13:20] trying to get their attention so it has
[13:22] two i just want to point out two very
[13:24] direct implications
[13:26] christ isn't on the inside
[13:30] right we're talking about invert always
[13:32] invert
[13:33] we've maybe accepted for years oh christ
[13:36] is on the outside he's a fugitive in his
[13:38] own church he's been rejected out of
[13:39] laodicea he stands at the door and
[13:41] knocks
[13:41] if he's on the outside of the laodicean
[13:43] church knocking to
[13:45] to get their attention then what does
[13:47] that mean he's not in there
[13:50] that's heavy it's a really heavy thing
[13:53] to consider that he's not in there now
[13:55] if he's not in there what does that mean
[13:58] those on the inside are without christ
[14:02] we could have our breakout session now
[14:04] i've been threatening to do that but my
[14:05] we could just sit around and say okay
[14:06] let's think about that for a minute
[14:09] if christ is knocking on the door then
[14:11] he's not in where he's knocking
[14:13] and if he's not in where he's knocking
[14:15] the one he's appealing to is not doesn't
[14:17] have him
[14:18] and therefore those that are on the
[14:20] inside are under the threat of judgment
[14:23] and the things that are going to come
[14:25] upon laodicea and so the reason why
[14:27] christ is knocking
[14:28] is because those who are on the inside
[14:29] need something for the time that they're
[14:31] living in
[14:32] and if they don't get it they're going
[14:33] to come under judgment so he's knocking
[14:35] in mercy
[14:35] he's knocking in grace to get their
[14:37] attention because he's saying hey i'm
[14:38] not in there and i'm not going to be in
[14:40] there
[14:40] and if i'm not in there you don't have
[14:42] me so you've got to respond
[14:44] to the voice in order to have the union
[14:46] to escape the judgment that's coming
[14:49] and this is where i want to focus on
[14:52] tonight as we've been speaking about
[14:53] being hungry and
[14:55] are you hungry and i am hungry and are
[14:57] you being fed
[14:58] and and over the last couple services
[15:00] speaking about eating to live and typing
[15:02] that with
[15:03] with certain uh bad habits that we might
[15:05] have in the flesh and
[15:06] and those type of using those types just
[15:09] to speak to how god wants to satisfy the
[15:11] bride's appetite
[15:13] ask yourself and i know this is very
[15:14] very elementary and it's it's not just a
[15:17] a cheap scheme to get easy amends i just
[15:19] feel to
[15:20] to to go about it this way and i'll even
[15:22] say this
[15:23] i'm going to maybe in the exact opposite
[15:25] of what i would normally do normally i
[15:26] would start in the book of ruth and
[15:28] maybe build to this
[15:30] but i just feel to start where i would
[15:31] end so really this is the end of where
[15:33] uh where i would ultimately build
[15:35] through this bread of life come to
[15:36] bethlehem
[15:38] if christ is knocking at the door and
[15:41] and he has been rejected let's just
[15:43] consider who it is they've rejected
[15:47] who has been shut out who is it that's
[15:50] become a fugitive and just notice these
[15:51] scriptures
[15:52] these characteristics of christ in john
[15:54] chapter 14 verse 6
[15:56] jesus saith unto him i am the way the
[15:58] truth the life
[16:00] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[16:03] therefore if christ is no longer in the
[16:05] midst of the laodicean church he's on
[16:07] the outside
[16:08] then the church does not have access to
[16:10] god
[16:11] the way the truth the life is gone so
[16:13] without the way there is no going
[16:15] without the truth there is no knowing
[16:16] without the life there is no living
[16:18] there is no going there is no knowing
[16:20] there is no living in it anymore
[16:23] think about it this is just what the
[16:24] scriptures are telling us christ is not
[16:26] on the inside so the way is missing the
[16:28] truth is missing the life is missing
[16:29] therefore they cannot come to the father
[16:32] as long as they've lost this connection
[16:34] with jesus christ
[16:36] in john chapter 6 verse 63 and i know
[16:38] we've used a lot of these scriptures in
[16:40] this series
[16:42] he's speaking to those that came looking
[16:44] for what the bread
[16:45] the natural bread because who wouldn't
[16:47] want a friend who could feed you every
[16:48] day for free
[16:50] he's he's challenging this notion that
[16:52] they wanted to be there for the miracles
[16:54] and well
[16:54] moses gave us bread in the wilderness
[16:56] and she said no no it wasn't moses they
[16:58] did it was my father that did it
[16:59] and he's making the point that the bread
[17:01] that fell in the wilderness was by in
[17:03] type him
[17:05] that i am the bread and he says it is
[17:07] the spirit that quickeneth
[17:09] the flesh profiteth nothing
[17:13] if i could put it in this context it's
[17:15] the spirit of god that really gives life
[17:18] feed the body all you want and it's just
[17:21] you're just going to get to the grave
[17:22] like everyone else so it's the spirit
[17:25] that quickens it's the spirit that's
[17:26] going to give life it's the spirit that
[17:27] gives strength
[17:28] it's actually the spirit of god that can
[17:30] carry the body and sustain
[17:32] the body and give it vitamins and give
[17:34] it nutrients in the absence of proper
[17:36] food
[17:37] right just even think about it in the in
[17:40] daniel when they were
[17:41] uh they'd announced all these israel
[17:44] children and
[17:45] these fine of princes and these fine
[17:47] young men who were
[17:49] skilled and had talents and knowledge
[17:51] and they'd been kept kidnapped out of
[17:53] babylon and they would have been raised
[17:54] in very strict homes according to the
[17:56] the laws of god and there would have
[17:57] been things they couldn't eat or drink
[17:59] and now they've been kidnapped
[18:00] and they're wanting to turn these young
[18:02] men into chaldeans they want to turn
[18:03] these men into babylonians
[18:05] and so what do they do they're going to
[18:06] change their language change their
[18:08] language they'll assimilate into the
[18:09] culture
[18:10] and number two wanted to change what
[18:11] they'd eat and drink this is how they're
[18:13] going to assimilate them and daniel says
[18:14] no i won't defile myself with what the
[18:16] wine and meat
[18:18] and daniel's the only one that speaks up
[18:21] he says i'm not going to do it and all i
[18:22] imagine just all the other ones would be
[18:24] like
[18:24] awesome if we're going to be slaves we
[18:25] might might as well eat well steak and
[18:28] wine for as long as we're slaves
[18:30] and they were probably excited about but
[18:31] dana says no give me water and
[18:33] vegetables
[18:34] everybody's like daniel come on man live
[18:36] a little besides that's just our parents
[18:38] religion and here we have this chance
[18:39] and this is their only way out we've got
[18:41] to get it
[18:41] we can assimilate into the culture and
[18:43] we can do these things and have these
[18:44] things
[18:45] but daniel says no i tell you what why
[18:46] don't you just give me water and
[18:47] vegetables
[18:48] and then see who turns out in the end
[18:50] who looks better
[18:51] and there was others that joined the
[18:53] three hebrew children hananiah
[18:55] misha and israel they they join in as a
[18:58] right they join in with
[18:59] daniel say no we won't defile ourselves
[19:01] either and in the end
[19:03] god made the difference in just drinking
[19:06] water and eating vegetables god made the
[19:08] difference and sustained
[19:09] because the spirit quickeneth the flesh
[19:11] profiteth little
[19:13] it's not the flesh that we need to feed
[19:15] it's not the flesh that we need to obey
[19:16] it's not the flesh that needs to have
[19:17] the preeminence the spirit does
[19:19] and he says the words that i speak unto
[19:21] you they are spirit
[19:22] and they are life so what is he
[19:25] differentiating he's distinguishing
[19:27] between
[19:28] the natural bread that feeds the body
[19:30] and the spiritual bread that feeds the
[19:31] soul
[19:32] natural bread can feed the body you may
[19:34] come to me because i can multiply fish
[19:35] and multiply bread
[19:37] and that'll that'll get you through the
[19:38] day and that'll just feed your body but
[19:40] that profits nothing the profits
[19:42] literally says
[19:42] but this is our profits nothing but this
[19:45] the words that i
[19:46] speak they are spirit in their life he's
[19:48] wanting to separate between natural
[19:50] bread and spiritual bread
[19:52] so he's the way the truth of life the
[19:54] words that he speak are spirit and life
[19:56] and then in verse 51 of the same chapter
[19:58] i am notice he says i am the living
[20:01] bread
[20:02] which came down from heaven i am i am
[20:06] the living bread which came down from
[20:07] heaven
[20:08] he that cometh to me excuse me if any
[20:12] man
[20:12] eat of this bread he shall live forever
[20:14] and the bread that i will give
[20:16] is my flesh which i give for the life of
[20:19] the world
[20:20] now he definitely says it a way to
[20:21] stumble them oh that we're gonna he's
[20:22] gonna give us flesh we're gonna have to
[20:24] be cannibals we're gonna have to eat
[20:25] eat his skin or eat his muscles but he
[20:27] said i am the living bread of life i'm
[20:29] going to give my flesh and it's going to
[20:31] be given for this world and by that
[20:33] people who partake in this
[20:35] are going to live forever so what is it
[20:38] that's been rejected out of the church
[20:39] the way the truth of life the words
[20:41] which are
[20:42] spirit and life and they've rejected the
[20:45] living bread
[20:46] which comes out of heaven they've
[20:47] rejected the living bread that if a man
[20:49] eat any men eat of
[20:50] he shall live forever they've rejected
[20:52] that
[20:54] now by through lip service they
[20:55] certainly don't claim to have rejected
[20:57] christ they actually claim to be serving
[20:59] christ
[21:00] but they have rejected him look at verse
[21:02] 35 of the same chapter and jesus say
[21:04] unto them
[21:05] i am the bread of life he that cometh to
[21:08] me shall never hunger
[21:10] and he that believeth on me shall never
[21:12] thirst
[21:14] this is what they rejected the one that
[21:15] satisfies hunger the one that satisfies
[21:17] thirst
[21:19] behold i stand at the door and knock
[21:21] christ being on the outside of the
[21:23] church they've rejected
[21:24] the bread of life they've rejected the
[21:26] one that'll satisfy their hunger they've
[21:28] rejected the one that if they
[21:30] believe on him they'll never thirst so
[21:32] you
[21:33] if you're hungry you want to eat if
[21:34] you're thirsty you want to drink christ
[21:36] is the one that would provide what you
[21:38] need to eat
[21:38] christ is the one that provides what you
[21:40] need to drink in order to satisfy
[21:42] hunger and thirst he who hungers and
[21:44] thirst after righteousness shall be
[21:45] filled
[21:46] they've rejected the fulfillment of
[21:48] whatever would satisfy that hungering
[21:50] and thirsting
[21:52] in john chapter 7 verse 37 because
[21:54] notice how jesus says i'm the bread of
[21:56] life
[21:57] if a man eats me he'll never hunger but
[21:58] then he that believeth shall never
[22:00] thirst
[22:01] this is a real beautiful scripture that
[22:02] has a lot of
[22:04] a lot of um elements to it because it's
[22:07] at a time of a feast
[22:09] in john chapter 7 verse 37 in the last
[22:11] day that great day of the feast
[22:14] jesus stood and cried saying if any men
[22:17] thirst
[22:18] let him come unto me and drink now i'm
[22:21] going through this just to identify
[22:22] again what's not
[22:23] in that place where those are that
[22:27] christ is knocking
[22:28] there's a door he's knocking on
[22:29] symbolically there's a door that he's
[22:30] knocking on
[22:31] and how it's symbolized in the scripture
[22:33] there's people who are in a particular
[22:34] place we could say in laodicea
[22:37] who are without christ this is who
[22:38] they're without
[22:40] they're without the bread of life
[22:41] they're without the one who stood and
[22:43] said if any man is thirsty
[22:44] let him come unto me and drink and it
[22:47] says
[22:48] in the last day the great day of the
[22:49] feast in verse two it says
[22:51] now the jews feast of the tabernacles
[22:53] was at hand
[22:54] so he comes at a time of the feast of
[22:56] the tabernacles where they had these
[22:57] seven days
[22:58] and then in the and then they'd have the
[23:00] last day of the feast and through these
[23:01] seven days they'd be offering all these
[23:03] different bullocks and all these
[23:04] sacrifices
[23:05] and they'd be offering these sacrifices
[23:07] through seven days for the for all the
[23:09] nations of people
[23:10] but on the last great day the great day
[23:12] of the feast or it says the last day
[23:14] that's the eighth day
[23:16] after seven days of sacrifices to all
[23:18] the gentiles and all the people
[23:20] and all those of the nations of the
[23:23] world on the eighth day there's a holy
[23:25] convocation
[23:26] and they're going to now only offer one
[23:28] bullock and it's for the believers
[23:30] one bullet for israel one bullet for the
[23:32] people of god
[23:33] and so on this last day the eighth day
[23:36] of holy convocation
[23:37] it's the last feast day of the year
[23:40] i just pondered this now as we we're
[23:42] looking at this in the context of the
[23:44] seventh church age and on the
[23:45] at this time this dispensation that
[23:47] opens up in the seventh church age
[23:49] on this day the priest would actually go
[23:51] to the
[23:52] uh the fount of shalom and they would
[23:54] fill up a golden vial
[23:56] full of water and then they would take
[23:57] it to the sacrifice and they would pour
[23:59] this water upon the altar and isaiah
[24:02] speaks of it that with joy you'll draw
[24:04] from the
[24:05] wells of salvation and there's all this
[24:07] rich tradition and history
[24:09] of this uh libation of water and this
[24:11] offering of water on this eighth day
[24:13] this holy convocation
[24:14] but then jesus stands up while this very
[24:17] thing is taking place
[24:18] in the feast of the tabernacles on this
[24:20] eighth day in this holy convocation
[24:23] now he stands up and cries with a loud
[24:25] voice if you're thirsty come to me and
[24:28] drink
[24:29] the priest have grabbed a golden vial
[24:31] and they're filling it up with water and
[24:33] they're bringing it to the altar and
[24:34] they're pouring this water out
[24:35] and there's this water offering and it
[24:37] symbolizes these different things to you
[24:39] and this freshness
[24:40] and this washing but i'm actually the
[24:42] fountain i'm greater than the pool of
[24:44] siloam
[24:44] i'm the fountain if you'll come to me
[24:46] and drink you'll you'll
[24:47] never thirst again
[24:51] so he stands up in the time of the
[24:53] ceremony
[24:56] and the time of this celebration has
[24:57] been taking place and they're
[24:58] celebrating their last feast of the year
[25:00] the last feast day of their year jesus
[25:02] stands
[25:03] and he makes this pronouncement come to
[25:05] me those who are thirsty
[25:07] and i want you to see an image of
[25:08] laodicea in this
[25:10] i want you to see that how through seven
[25:12] church ages through all the religions
[25:14] that have been building all the
[25:15] denominations that have been building
[25:16] and you arrive at a time where there's
[25:18] ceremony there's religion there's works
[25:19] there's tradition
[25:20] there's even the uh how people say i've
[25:22] done many wonderful things in your name
[25:24] and i've done this work and i've done
[25:25] this sign i've done that wonder we're
[25:27] rich we're increased
[25:28] with goods and they're actually bragging
[25:29] of their spiritual economy they're
[25:31] bragging about their works and they're
[25:32] grabbing bragging about their services
[25:34] and they're bragging about all the
[25:35] wonderful things they have it's right
[25:37] there at this time that the ceremony is
[25:39] taking place
[25:40] and all the tradition and all the things
[25:42] that kind of pleases the eye
[25:43] and all the things that they do to play
[25:45] church christ stands up and says wait a
[25:47] minute
[25:47] you guys are just playing church i am
[25:50] water that you can partake in and never
[25:53] thirst again
[25:55] it's then that christ stands he says he
[25:57] stood
[25:58] and speaks so who is knocking in
[26:01] revelations 3 20 who is speaking
[26:03] jesus christ who is he he's the bread of
[26:06] life
[26:08] what is he he's the fountain of living
[26:10] water
[26:11] he is the bread that came out of heaven
[26:13] he's the water that came from the rock
[26:17] think about that as he's identified in
[26:19] john chapter six himself
[26:21] as they begin the conversation in the
[26:22] back and forth he's saying i'm the bread
[26:24] of god that comes out of heaven
[26:25] what were those things they were
[26:27] provisions in the exodus
[26:30] so christ has identified himself as the
[26:32] provision
[26:34] this is the who that is missing in
[26:35] laodicea this is the what that's missing
[26:37] in laodicea
[26:38] if he's not there what's not there bread
[26:42] if he's not there then what's not there
[26:44] water
[26:45] and those are the elements for life so
[26:48] if he's not there there's no
[26:49] there's no life if he's not there
[26:51] there's no provision for life there's no
[26:52] sustainer there's no giver
[26:54] there's no bread there's no water
[26:55] there's no life if he's not there
[26:58] so he says i stand at the door
[27:01] what is this door if there's a door
[27:05] then it speaks of an entrance or
[27:08] some passageway is this an entrance back
[27:12] into laodicea it says behold i stand at
[27:14] the door knocked
[27:15] is christ wanting to take a a is he
[27:18] wanting to come back into laodicea
[27:21] or is it actually an exit
[27:24] is is the door there so that christ can
[27:26] get back in or is the door there
[27:28] symbolically as a passage for the person
[27:30] who's stuck in that condition
[27:32] out of that condition and into an
[27:34] audience with christ
[27:36] in revelations chapter 4 verse 1 it's
[27:39] important
[27:40] it's important to see just how closely
[27:42] connected these things are because
[27:43] as we read it we have revelations
[27:45] chapter 3 then we have revelations
[27:46] chapter four
[27:47] but as john is writing it he doesn't
[27:49] kind of you know kind of wet his pen
[27:51] again and then start
[27:52] chapter four it just says in verse one
[27:54] after this i looked
[27:56] after what after these things have been
[27:58] spoken to the angel of laodicea
[28:00] this is very this is very recent this is
[28:03] very near it's right here he has heard
[28:04] this pronouncement
[28:05] behold i stand at the door knock then it
[28:08] gives the reward to the overcomer
[28:09] and this is after this i looked and
[28:11] behold a door
[28:13] was opened in heaven so these behold i
[28:16] stand at the
[28:17] the door and knock and now john sees a
[28:19] door opened in heaven
[28:21] and the first voice which i heard was it
[28:23] as it were a trumpet talking with me
[28:25] which said
[28:26] come up hither and i will show thee
[28:28] things which must be hereafter
[28:30] so you've had these seven church ages
[28:32] that take place but there's got to be a
[28:34] translation there's got to be a rapture
[28:36] there just can't always be a cycle of
[28:37] revival and death god doesn't have
[28:40] one compliment for the laodicean church
[28:42] age not one good thing to say about it
[28:44] what is it what is it he has to say
[28:46] about it nothing why because he's going
[28:48] to take a people
[28:50] out of it and there's going to be a
[28:51] rapture and there's going to be a
[28:52] resurrection of the sleeping saints and
[28:54] there's going to be a meeting in the air
[28:55] so now the transition isn't to try to
[28:57] fix the church and get everything right
[28:59] to perpetuate the church ages it's time
[29:01] to change dimensions
[29:02] because he needs to reveal himself to
[29:04] the jews he needs to wrap up the 144 000
[29:07] there needs to be a millennium there
[29:08] needs to be a white throne judgment we
[29:09] need to get to that eighth and final day
[29:11] where we'll live eternally with him
[29:12] in a new heavens and new earth so now
[29:14] things are changing and rapidly coming
[29:16] to pass
[29:17] because god is fulfilling his promised
[29:18] word
[29:20] after this i look and a door is open and
[29:22] a voice as it were like a trump is
[29:24] speaking
[29:24] come up higher come up higher behold i
[29:28] stand at the door and knock now there's
[29:30] a door open
[29:31] and it says come up higher and i'll show
[29:32] these things i'm going to reveal things
[29:34] to you
[29:34] which are going to take place after
[29:36] you've seen these things transpire and
[29:38] laodicea
[29:40] so chapter 3 introduces a door that
[29:43] christ is on the one side of
[29:45] and everyone else is on the other side
[29:47] again symbolically
[29:49] we see a door and christ is on one side
[29:51] and everyone else is on the other
[29:53] but now chapter 4 identifies a door
[29:55] that's opened in heaven a door speaks of
[29:57] a gate it's actually translated
[29:58] could be translated a gate speaks of an
[30:01] entrance or a way or a passage
[30:04] he says i looked and behold a door was
[30:06] open an open door speaks of an
[30:08] opportunity to do something i have an
[30:10] open door to do this or is there an open
[30:12] door there it's not
[30:13] we're not looking for a literal door but
[30:15] it's opportunity opening up
[30:18] when a door is open he said well this
[30:19] door just opened they don't look around
[30:21] and say well i didn't see a door
[30:22] you're actually just talking about what
[30:24] an opportunity that just came up
[30:26] a door just opened this just happened
[30:28] these things taking place
[30:29] and so an open door speaks of an
[30:31] opportunity to do something
[30:32] it's a discovery of things that are
[30:34] going to be when a door opens it's an
[30:37] opportunity for exploration it's an
[30:39] opportunity for new land it's an
[30:40] opportunity
[30:41] for new possessions when a door opens
[30:43] it's like a new opportunity a door open
[30:46] opening and saying coming up higher the
[30:48] door opening is you could be said
[30:50] said this way the door opening is him
[30:53] hearing a voice saying come up higher
[30:57] that's that's an open door that's an
[30:58] opportunity being made
[31:00] and so now this is the beautiful part to
[31:02] me he says now a door is opened in
[31:04] heaven
[31:04] you have all these church ages unfolding
[31:07] and you have these things that are
[31:08] transpiring
[31:09] and these compliments and these rebukes
[31:10] and these things taking place
[31:12] but now at the end of the laodicean
[31:14] church age and at the beginning of
[31:15] revelations chapter 4
[31:17] which is setting the scene for the open
[31:18] of the seals the scene changes from an
[31:20] earthly scene to a heavenly scene
[31:24] now it's it's not just earthbound
[31:25] anymore it's not just uh things related
[31:27] to the earth but now
[31:29] john's orientation changes and the
[31:31] opportunity is to no longer remain
[31:34] bound to the earth to no longer remain
[31:36] bound to creeds and dogmas and church
[31:38] systems and church orders
[31:39] but now it's come up higher now the
[31:41] scene changes from earthly things to
[31:43] heavenly things
[31:44] it's a change of dispensation
[31:48] now heaven's being laid open
[31:51] now heaven's being revealed to the bride
[31:53] which is upon earth
[31:55] and opportunities being given we could
[31:58] say oh
[31:58] i haven't i had a door open up had an
[32:01] opportunity presented to me
[32:04] and this is something it's remarkable
[32:06] how that
[32:08] if if you told somebody well why did you
[32:10] quit your job
[32:11] and and why are you why are you doing
[32:13] that why are you doing this training why
[32:15] are you why are you doing that so well
[32:16] an opportunity opened up
[32:18] i've been given a chance well what is it
[32:20] well i can get really rich doing this if
[32:21] i put in my time i do this and i'm on
[32:23] the ground floor
[32:24] and and i can i can really i can make
[32:26] make a lot of money
[32:28] and unless yeah i guess i just let's
[32:30] just be honest
[32:31] unless we know it's a pyramid scheme or
[32:33] mlm or something like that we generally
[32:35] can understand it right well go for it
[32:37] that's great that's wonderful
[32:38] but then somebody testifies i've had an
[32:40] opportunity open up
[32:42] to know christ in a greater way i've had
[32:44] an opportunity open up
[32:46] to to to feed on the word of god i had
[32:48] an opportunity open up to make a greater
[32:50] investment
[32:51] in eternity in my spiritual life people
[32:53] won't object to that i have no problem
[32:56] with an opportunity that opens up to
[32:58] feed the flesh but what about an
[32:59] opportunity opening up to feed the soul
[33:03] the scripture speak come up higher is
[33:05] the do
[33:06] the door opening and so what is this
[33:10] door behold i stand at the door knock
[33:11] there's so much imagery that's
[33:13] contained in this i stand at the door
[33:16] because in john chapter 10 verses 7 to 9
[33:18] and then the door opening jesus has
[33:21] already said i am the way.
[33:24] so in that sense he is a door
[33:30] then said jesus unto them again this is
[33:32] john chapter 10 verses 7 to 9.
[33:35] verily verily i say unto you i am the
[33:37] door of the sheep
[33:39] i am the way that sheep come
[33:43] it's for the sheep and notice the
[33:44] language he's using all that ever came
[33:46] before me are thieves and robbers
[33:48] but the sheep did not hear them i am the
[33:51] door
[33:52] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[33:55] saved
[33:56] and shall go in and out this is how we
[33:58] do it by him
[34:01] and then you're coming and going
[34:02] remember how that spoke of wisdom and
[34:05] and discernment and knowledge and
[34:06] understanding and this is the part i
[34:08] want you to focus on
[34:09] he's the door of the sheep i am the door
[34:12] you enter in and what find
[34:13] pasture and that word literally means
[34:16] food
[34:17] find provision find the necessities for
[34:20] true life
[34:21] so the door represents the way to
[34:24] provision
[34:26] the door represents a way to life to
[34:28] feed to have substance
[34:29] just as he was the provision in the
[34:31] exodus the door
[34:32] that is opened up through a voice is the
[34:34] way that you can be fed in the time of
[34:36] famine
[34:39] it's the way that we're fed to receive
[34:40] strength to fly above the nonsense of
[34:42] the world and the nonsense of religion
[34:44] it's the way that we receive strength to
[34:46] triumph over death
[34:49] so this door is an entrance we can look
[34:51] to the scriptures and see this very
[34:52] plainly it's an entrance to the
[34:54] to see the unveiling of jesus christ
[34:57] it's an entrance into the fullness of
[34:59] redemption to receive all
[35:01] that calvary paid for to receive all
[35:03] that it stood for
[35:04] how that in calvary he paid the price of
[35:07] redemption but he did not pay the price
[35:09] of redemption just so that
[35:10] eons and eons and eons of time would
[35:12] unfold where people believe
[35:14] and are saved and then die and we just
[35:16] always have funerals and always have
[35:18] funeral no
[35:19] it was a redemption where he purchased
[35:21] it knowing that one day
[35:23] redemption would come in fullness and he
[35:25] died so that
[35:26] ultimately there would be a people that
[35:28] would not have to die a physical death
[35:31] so there has to come a fullness of
[35:33] redemption
[35:34] behold i stand at the door and knock and
[35:36] now a door open in heaven it's the
[35:38] opening of something
[35:41] and it's not just something different
[35:43] but absolutely necessary
[35:46] it's not something different oh well
[35:48] we're different than this and we're
[35:49] different than that
[35:50] and and sometimes you have these splits
[35:52] within organizations and it's like well
[35:54] so they have this really robust
[35:56] organization and they're thriving
[35:57] they're growing churches and things are
[35:59] going really really well
[36:00] and then they split off and they kind of
[36:01] just change the name maybe they put a
[36:02] comma in or maybe they make something
[36:04] plural
[36:04] and you go well oh this is a i thought
[36:06] you guys were together well why are you
[36:07] no longer together well
[36:09] they only use one cup we believe in
[36:10] having many cups of communion
[36:13] or the split happens because they want
[36:15] to go to several cups but this group
[36:17] wants to have one cup
[36:18] i mean my brother one time had a
[36:20] conversation he was written into
[36:21] somebody
[36:22] and they said oh we believe in only
[36:24] using one cup in communion
[36:26] and he said okay all right that's fine i
[36:27] get that but if you don't use one cup
[36:30] it's something wrong oh yeah maybe
[36:31] that's
[36:31] blasphemy or transgress in the word of
[36:32] god there's got to be one cup he says
[36:34] well
[36:34] what would happen if you had a thousand
[36:36] people you know
[36:37] and you all had to drink because the
[36:39] thing was it all had to be drinking from
[36:40] the same cup
[36:41] and the way that the language is being
[36:43] used to defend it is you just have to
[36:44] get a gigantic
[36:48] you know you think the big gulp is big
[36:51] and you have to have something really
[36:52] gigantic you know and i don't know if
[36:54] they just use straws at that point or
[36:56] how you'd make it work but they have
[36:58] split over things like that
[37:01] we believe in little shot glasses we
[37:03] believe in dixie cups
[37:05] we're at a past an impasse here and they
[37:07] split off
[37:08] this is not just something different
[37:12] where now i just see something a little
[37:14] bit different this is something
[37:15] absolutely necessary for life
[37:18] behold i stand at the door and knock he
[37:21] says if any man
[37:23] hear my voice this is an invitation then
[37:27] to the bread of life this is an
[37:30] invitation to the fountain of life
[37:32] you'll like this and i'll probably i
[37:34] should probably preach on it and just
[37:36] let loose a little bit maybe take off my
[37:37] coat and walk the aisles
[37:39] but if any man hear my voice that word
[37:42] voice there
[37:43] is phoney you know how it's spelled
[37:47] p-h-o-n-e that's the phone we should be
[37:50] worried about
[37:51] right not the the pixel 6 that's coming
[37:55] out or the
[37:56] next iphone i remember one time i think
[37:58] it was overseas and i was talking and i
[38:00] said i had at the time i think i just
[38:01] said i had
[38:02] the new iphone 10 and there was only an
[38:04] eight out
[38:05] and it caused a stir amongst these
[38:07] people overseas thinking that somehow in
[38:09] america we were already rocking the ten
[38:12] and they were stuck with the eight i had
[38:13] to kind of stop the meeting and explain
[38:15] i was just trying to be funny
[38:16] maybe don't get my sense of humor i'm
[38:18] sorry i didn't mean to suggest that you
[38:19] guys were using outdated technology
[38:22] but this is the phone the phone a that
[38:24] we want to hear
[38:26] if any man hear my voice
[38:29] the sound of uttered words it comes from
[38:33] false which speaks of light which means
[38:34] to bring forth into life
[38:36] the voice is what reveals the voice is
[38:39] what declares
[38:40] it's the voice that leads you into light
[38:43] the voice has come up higher and i'll
[38:44] show you things here after behold i
[38:46] stand at the door knocked it was not his
[38:48] hand that makes you aware of him not his
[38:51] providence necessarily
[38:52] but with his providence there has to be
[38:54] a voice that turns on the light
[38:57] it's not just his hand but it's his
[38:58] voice if any man hear my voice it's the
[39:01] voice the utterance of words
[39:02] that lead you forth into life the
[39:04] scripture speaks of how his life his
[39:06] words
[39:07] are a way of life his words are a lamp
[39:09] it's the voice the phonet
[39:11] that declares his presence and brings
[39:13] you higher
[39:14] into another realm changes you from
[39:16] earthly to heavenly
[39:19] and in this image that we have christ
[39:21] standing at the door knocking
[39:22] and there's these people on the inside
[39:23] that are actually very hungry very naked
[39:26] and and wretched and miserable and don't
[39:28] know it the knocking his providence that
[39:30] would knock
[39:31] his voice that would declare his
[39:32] presence is the voice
[39:34] that would awaken a person to the need
[39:36] that they have
[39:37] for the one that stands calling
[39:40] it's the voice that awakens the hungry
[39:43] to what is lacking
[39:44] in their laodicean diet that's why we
[39:47] don't have to try too hard to explain
[39:49] things
[39:50] don't have to try too hard to point
[39:52] things out and and
[39:54] just be the voice
[39:57] a life lived by the word is a voice
[40:00] that's exactly what paul preached paul
[40:01] said look i write to you guys letters
[40:03] you read the letters
[40:05] and if you read my letters and then you
[40:08] lit this and this is what he said
[40:10] if you read my letter and then you live
[40:12] what i wrote i don't even need to come
[40:14] speak to those that here see your life
[40:19] because from you is uttered forth
[40:22] and declared forth the things that i
[40:24] write
[40:25] so you become the voice you become the
[40:27] life
[40:29] and so the voice is what awakens the
[40:31] hungry to what's lacking and we talk
[40:32] about being
[40:33] salty that's that's what is
[40:36] awakened so i just riffing on a song
[40:37] that a brother wrote
[40:40] it's what awakens someone to what
[40:42] they're lacking when you're salty they
[40:44] get a taste for it they get thirsty
[40:48] awakens them to what's missing in their
[40:49] diet
[40:51] now notice the symmetry of scripture to
[40:53] have a
[40:54] a voice behold in the darkest of all
[40:57] ages the most foul and lewd of all ages
[40:59] the one age that's ridiculous has no
[41:01] compliments
[41:03] blind wretched poor miserable and naked
[41:06] and then you have a voice that's going
[41:07] to call to awaken those who are in it
[41:10] and what i'm wanting to see it's a call
[41:12] for a union of the elect
[41:14] with christ because the church age
[41:17] system is rejected
[41:19] and and how that in this condition
[41:22] there's a voice then come up higher
[41:24] notice what it says in revelations
[41:26] chapter 18 verses one to four
[41:28] and after these things i saw another
[41:30] angel come down from heaven having great
[41:32] power and the earth was
[41:33] lightened with his glory and he cried
[41:36] mightily with a strong voice saying
[41:38] babylon the great is fallen has fallen
[41:40] as become
[41:41] the habitation of devils and the hold of
[41:43] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[41:45] unclean and hateful bird for all nations
[41:49] have
[41:49] drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
[41:52] fornication so there's drinking that's
[41:53] represented here
[41:54] and the kings of the earth have
[41:55] committed fornication with her
[41:57] and the merchants listen to the economy
[42:00] now the merchants of the earth are waxed
[42:01] rich
[42:02] through the abundance of her delicacies
[42:04] this is describing
[42:06] the culmination of babylon in laodicea
[42:09] this is describing the the babylonian
[42:11] system and the spiritual system of
[42:13] babylon in the religion
[42:14] and and it's waxed rich through the
[42:16] abundance of her delicacies
[42:19] you can see this if you read in in in
[42:21] revelation how you're it's describing a
[42:23] woman like wow this woman's beautiful be
[42:25] careful it's babylon
[42:27] john even marveled at her beauty but
[42:29] wrong beauty
[42:30] wrong amenities wrong economy there
[42:32] might seem to be a lot of luxury a lot
[42:33] of things that you could enjoy
[42:34] a lot of things that would satisfy but
[42:36] the flesh profiteth nothing the religion
[42:38] that satisfies the flesh religion that
[42:41] puffs up the flesh religion that
[42:42] preserves the flesh the religion that
[42:44] lifts up man
[42:45] religion that makes other people uh
[42:47] greater than
[42:48] others within the economy of god those
[42:49] are things that relate to the babylonian
[42:52] system
[42:52] and don't fall for that and notice how
[42:55] it says in verse four and i heard
[42:57] another voice
[42:58] hallelujah i heard another voice from
[43:00] heaven saying come out of her come
[43:02] out of what babylon why is there a voice
[43:06] saying come out of babylon there must be
[43:08] elect in there that are not ordained to
[43:11] eat her delicacies to be blinded by her
[43:13] doctrines
[43:14] and so there's a voice saying come out
[43:17] so this is out of time just like it is
[43:20] in laodicea where there's a bunch of
[43:21] people sitting around
[43:23] and are we rich and aren't we wanted for
[43:25] and aren't we doing good and don't we
[43:26] have everything we need
[43:27] and they're worshiping christ not
[43:29] realizing he's no longer in there
[43:31] but all of a sudden there's a knocking
[43:33] and everybody might start getting
[43:34] excited about the knocking but there's
[43:36] one that sits there and says wait a
[43:37] minute i'm blind
[43:38] i'm naked and it's a voice calling out
[43:41] from beyond the darkness a voice
[43:44] calling out saying what what did it say
[43:45] what did the voice say
[43:47] come up higher what is it what is it
[43:50] everyone be quiet be quiet for a moment
[43:52] i need to hear a still small voice
[43:54] and everyone's just shouting over the
[43:55] earthquake everyone's shouting over the
[43:57] fire
[43:57] everyone's shouting over the whirlwind
[43:59] but there's a hunger and so and so i say
[44:00] no
[44:01] i gotta hear this still small voice what
[44:03] does it say come out of her my people
[44:06] come out of her my people why do i need
[44:09] to come out
[44:10] that you be not partakers of her sins
[44:14] that you not partake in it and that you
[44:16] receive not of her plagues
[44:18] come out of her why there's judgment
[44:20] coming come out of her because there's
[44:22] only one way of escape
[44:25] and what is it what is it telling him to
[44:27] do he says that you be not partakers and
[44:29] you receive not
[44:30] there's a pro there's a partaking
[44:32] there's a giving and a taking there's an
[44:34] exchange
[44:34] come out of her economy
[44:38] come out of her dispensation leave her
[44:40] systems leave her order don't rely upon
[44:43] her to feed you don't rely upon her to
[44:45] clothe you don't rely upon her food
[44:48] don't rely upon that system you could
[44:51] keep reading in revelations chapter 18
[44:53] verses 10 to 14 it refers to her
[44:55] merchandise of precious metals
[44:57] and precious stones and all the clothing
[44:59] and all the cloth
[45:00] and all the materials and then it
[45:01] identifies her cinnamon and her wine her
[45:03] oil
[45:04] her fine flour her wheat the beast to
[45:06] eat the sheep
[45:09] wow sounds like there's enough there to
[45:10] have a pretty good thanksgiving dinner
[45:13] well sounds to me brother aaron like she
[45:15] has all the trappings and the
[45:16] accoutrements of a good church i mean
[45:18] why shouldn't we go to church here it
[45:20] has everything we need and it seems like
[45:22] they have all the delicacies they have
[45:23] all the provisions and
[45:24] it would satisfy in every phase because
[45:26] they've actually got this program for
[45:28] this group and this program for that
[45:29] group they have this and they have that
[45:31] and
[45:31] they have a traditional service real
[45:33] early and they have a non-traditional
[45:34] service a little bit later
[45:35] and they have all the trappings the fine
[45:37] flour the cinnamon the wine the beast
[45:38] the sheep the precious stones and
[45:40] precious metals
[45:41] they have everything but god says get
[45:43] out of there plagues are coming
[45:48] it's babylon's feast of death
[45:51] it's rotten it's filthy it's cuppa is
[45:52] full of iniquity
[45:54] and lewd and foul things and they're
[45:55] drinking of the wine of the wrath of a
[45:57] fornication
[45:58] and if you drink wine you get stimulated
[46:01] so it doesn't mean those people aren't
[46:02] excited
[46:04] doesn't mean they're not thrilled but
[46:07] he's saying come out of her
[46:10] come out of her into what a new economy
[46:15] come out of her to a new availability of
[46:17] spiritual resources
[46:21] behold i stand at the door and knock
[46:26] if any man hear my voice
[46:30] and it says and open the door
[46:34] i will come into him
[46:37] such a beautiful statement if you
[46:39] haven't realized i'm not going very far
[46:40] tonight i'm just really unpacking
[46:42] revelations 3 20.
[46:44] i just i feel like this is important for
[46:45] us to recognize these
[46:47] principles in scripture i stand at the
[46:50] door and knock
[46:52] if any man hear my voice
[46:55] and it says and open the door
[47:01] at the open of the door i will come into
[47:04] him
[47:06] what was hidden now what was closed or
[47:09] on the other side of the door
[47:11] opens up now it's not to everyone it's
[47:15] to the one who hears
[47:17] and opens the door if any man hears my
[47:20] voice
[47:21] and opens the door i will come into him
[47:24] so whatever
[47:25] whatever condition the person was in on
[47:28] the other side of this door
[47:30] when this opportunity opens up he says i
[47:32] will come into him whatever was hidden
[47:33] whatever is closed whatever sealed off
[47:35] now opens up open the door
[47:39] he that opens the door upon hearing the
[47:40] voice you can even look at it in this
[47:42] sense
[47:43] that you seize the opportunity upon
[47:46] hearing the voice you're responding
[47:48] because there's something different
[47:49] that's taking place than what you hear
[47:51] in
[47:52] the uh and when there's an open door
[47:54] that's set before you which no man can
[47:55] open
[47:56] right this is a different dynamic of the
[47:59] open door that we hear earlier in the
[48:01] church ages
[48:01] this is a different kind of dynamic
[48:03] because now it's it's an opportunity
[48:05] that a man has to take advantage of
[48:08] the open door upon hearing the voice i'm
[48:09] gonna take advantage of this opportunity
[48:11] i'm gonna seize the moment i'm gonna
[48:13] take this i mean i've heard his voice
[48:15] and i'm gonna come to him
[48:16] he that hears my voice and opens the
[48:18] door i will come into him
[48:20] and notice i will manifest myself
[48:22] personally to him
[48:26] that way he's raptured up quickly
[48:29] into a private feast with the lord
[48:32] and everybody else is still hanging out
[48:33] in laodicea kind of looking at you
[48:34] thinking you're crazy
[48:37] why because david prophesied that he'd
[48:38] be feasting what in the presence of his
[48:40] enemies
[48:42] that's what god does he could just take
[48:45] us away
[48:46] right but prophecy doesn't say he's just
[48:49] going to take us away
[48:50] prophecy says i'm going to spread a
[48:52] table out before you
[48:54] in the presence of your enemies and i'm
[48:56] going to prepare a feast
[48:59] and you're going to eat in the presence
[49:01] of your enemies
[49:03] relaxed in resting
[49:07] not nervous not fearful not worried
[49:12] right there in the presence of death
[49:16] right you're just going to enjoy it
[49:19] and you're going to eat and that and the
[49:21] enemy's going to be rattling their
[49:23] shields and their swords and their
[49:24] chains and they're going to be sitting
[49:26] there saying
[49:26] and normally if you would eat in a war
[49:28] you'd eat quickly
[49:29] you'd eat in haste but the language that
[49:31] the scripture uses of one who's at rest
[49:34] hid in the secret of his tabernacle
[49:36] feasted in the presence of his enemies
[49:38] eating and not fearful of all those that
[49:40] are gathered around him why
[49:41] he knows he's victorious
[49:44] i will personally reveal myself to him
[49:46] and i will come
[49:48] with him and he says and i will sup with
[49:50] him
[49:51] and he with me sup
[49:55] it's used at the last meal of the day
[49:59] why is it you why is it you sup and this
[50:00] time the last meal of the day
[50:02] because it's the last feast before the
[50:04] translation
[50:05] it's the last feast before the
[50:06] tribulation last feast before the
[50:08] wedding supper in the sky
[50:10] there's going to be a meeting in the air
[50:11] there's going to be a wedding supper but
[50:12] before that wedding supper there's a
[50:14] marriage that's taking place here
[50:15] which is a spiritual feast it's the last
[50:19] meal of the day just as jesus stood up
[50:20] on that eighth day in that holy
[50:22] convocation
[50:23] in the last feast day of the year the
[50:24] last day of the feast of the tabernacles
[50:26] and he stood up said i am
[50:28] the well of living water come and drink
[50:30] of me and you'll never thirst again
[50:31] now a very similar thing is taking place
[50:33] within the church
[50:34] as they're all sitting in darkness and
[50:36] wandering in darkness and going into
[50:37] chaos
[50:38] he stands and says come to me behold i
[50:41] stand at the door knock
[50:44] i will come into him and will sup with
[50:46] him and he with me
[50:47] i'm going to hold a personal communion
[50:49] with him
[50:51] i'm going to feed him the bread of life
[50:54] i'm going to give him
[50:56] living water this is what takes place in
[51:00] revelations chapter 10.
[51:03] mighty angel descends out of heaven with
[51:04] the book open
[51:06] and there's a voice that speaks and says
[51:07] go to him that has the book and tell him
[51:09] to give you the book
[51:10] but what happens when you get to him who
[51:12] has the book
[51:14] it's take it and eat it up
[51:19] this is what jesus says behold i stand
[51:21] at the door and knock here's opportunity
[51:23] here's an
[51:23] opening up and if you come to him he
[51:26] says i will sup with you
[51:27] in you with me i will hold personal
[51:29] communion and you'll have the privilege
[51:31] of taking the word of god
[51:33] and eating it up
[51:36] what do these things speak of
[51:49] the bible says in first thessalonians 4
[51:51] 16
[51:54] and the lord himself shall descend from
[51:56] heaven with the shout
[52:00] with the voice of the archangel and with
[52:02] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[52:03] shall rise first
[52:09] listen to what brother brahman says in
[52:11] the rapture jesus does all three of them
[52:13] when he's descending
[52:14] a shout this is very simple there's not
[52:19] a lot of expounding on it but just
[52:20] ponder it
[52:21] what is the shout it's the message going
[52:24] forth
[52:25] first you see this perfectly in line
[52:27] with scripture
[52:28] the phrase the living bread of life
[52:31] bringing
[52:32] forth the bride
[52:36] there has to be something to bring you
[52:38] forth
[52:40] just as there is a voice to call someone
[52:42] out of the laodicean condition
[52:44] just as there was a voice to call those
[52:46] out of babylon just as there's a voice
[52:48] that was a door open in heaven calling
[52:50] john higher
[52:51] there has to be something of life and
[52:54] vitality
[52:55] it's a draw it's an attraction here's
[52:58] the living bread of life which attracts
[53:00] the bride away from dead things away
[53:02] from rotten things away from stale
[53:04] things
[53:05] away from hybrid things that can't give
[53:07] life and she says this
[53:08] is what i was hungry for this is what i
[53:10] was searching for
[53:11] this is what i was longing for all my
[53:13] life little did i know if this was what
[53:15] was leading me
[53:16] christ the revealed word this is what i
[53:18] was hungry for
[53:20] and it brings people forth
[53:23] and it's the living bread of life
[53:26] bringing forth the bride
[53:28] a need there has to be a need then in
[53:30] god's people
[53:32] that he is going to meet that when he
[53:34] makes himself known
[53:35] it's deep calling to deep
[53:38] at the noise of thy fountain i've left i
[53:40] left my water i left this natural i left
[53:43] these things
[53:43] i'm responding now to this call why
[53:46] because i've heard a voice and this is
[53:48] what i've longed for this is what i'm
[53:49] hungry for
[53:50] it's the living bread of life it's jesus
[53:52] christ
[53:53] i am the bread of god that comes out of
[53:54] heaven i am the living bread i am the
[53:56] bread of life what does it do
[53:58] it's what brings you up and raises you
[54:00] up
[54:03] look think of how it looks in matthew
[54:05] 25.
[54:06] you have you have these virgins who
[54:10] there's five wise and five foolish and
[54:12] then there's a cry maid behold the
[54:13] bridegroom cometh
[54:15] at midnight behold the bridegroom cometh
[54:18] now there's a lot of there's a lot of
[54:21] assumptions that we could make with the
[54:22] scripture
[54:25] but invariably all of them wake up
[54:31] and the wise rise and trim their lamps
[54:33] and they seem to be the one that really
[54:35] respond to behold the bridegroom cometh
[54:38] and you could read it to where the
[54:39] activity of the wise
[54:41] is what kind of gets the foolish
[54:43] stirring oh
[54:44] they're trimming their lamps but the
[54:46] foolish realize
[54:47] they don't have any oil the fullest very
[54:51] well may just be deducing by the fact
[54:52] that the wise have trimmed their lambs
[54:54] that it must be time for the bridegroom
[54:56] to come so they're all acting only based
[54:58] upon the movement of those who have the
[55:00] oil
[55:00] and now there's great activity and
[55:01] they're like we don't have oil give us
[55:03] one like
[55:03] sorry you can't get it from us go buy it
[55:06] yourself and what they do they go to buy
[55:08] oil
[55:09] so there's some economy there's some
[55:11] giving and exchanging there's supply and
[55:12] demand there's some
[55:13] sort of commerce that's taking place but
[55:16] while they're out trying to transact for
[55:18] the holy ghost
[55:19] the bride who has it meets with her
[55:21] bridegroom
[55:22] and they begin to have a feast
[55:26] and it says in revel it's matthew
[55:28] chapter 25 verse 10 and while they went
[55:30] to buy
[55:31] the bridegroom comes and they that were
[55:33] ready and had oil
[55:34] they go into the marriage or the union
[55:37] and the door is shut
[55:39] they miss the opportunity and so the
[55:42] door is shut but now there's a union
[55:45] that's taking place
[55:46] for those who ordained the elect to the
[55:48] oil those
[55:49] who have heard the voice and gone out to
[55:51] meet him now the door is shut and what
[55:54] was it it was the living bread of life
[55:56] the master is come and calling for thee
[55:59] that brings you
[56:00] to him for the union and for the
[56:02] marriage
[56:04] it's a living bread of life that brings
[56:05] forth the bride
[56:07] it's not gonna be politics not gonna be
[56:09] personality
[56:10] not gonna be opportunity it's christ
[56:15] that has to be what you're tied to more
[56:16] than anything it has to be christ
[56:19] that's who you've met that's who's
[56:20] speaking to you that's who you're
[56:22] following
[56:22] that's who you're married to
[56:30] listen to how brother branham puts it in
[56:31] god's chosen place of worship
[56:33] i say the harvest time would be a
[56:34] wonderful sermon to listen to these
[56:36] god's chosen place of worship would fit
[56:38] very well with this too
[56:39] he says my friends i don't want to hurt
[56:41] feelings but i'm responsible for a
[56:42] message
[56:44] what was that message
[56:48] think about it and the message is come
[56:49] out of this mess
[56:52] hey i got you have to be careful because
[56:56] some people might
[56:57] misunderstand you but i think there's a
[56:59] mess age that you got to get out of
[57:03] come out of this mess and if i ask you
[57:06] to come out where am i going to take you
[57:08] i love this would i take you to the
[57:10] branham tabernacle
[57:12] it's as much fault as any of the rest of
[57:14] them
[57:17] but there's one place i can take you
[57:20] where you are
[57:21] safe and protected from death oh well
[57:23] where's that green's mill
[57:26] oh it's got to be tucson right no it's
[57:28] in alaska
[57:30] where is it let's find it this mecca
[57:32] let's find this place that we can all go
[57:34] that's in jesus christ god's
[57:38] place of worship that's the place i'm
[57:41] introducing to you tonight
[57:43] where god puts his name introduction
[57:47] opportunity not not come to this church
[57:51] and believe this system and
[57:52] follow this order and do these rules and
[57:54] do these things no it's i'm
[57:56] introducing you to jesus christ there's
[57:59] one place that he put his name
[58:02] right where god put his name where he
[58:03] promised he'd meet every person that
[58:05] come in there
[58:06] he would worship with him
[58:09] he would worship with him and feast with
[58:12] him that's in christ
[58:14] not in no church no tabernacle
[58:18] amen it's not in a church it's not in a
[58:20] tabernacle this is the kind of
[58:22] confidence we can have in
[58:23] with as believers is absolutely solemnly
[58:26] believe
[58:27] and some of you have experienced this it
[58:28] has nothing to do with whether or not
[58:30] there's got to be a church or there's
[58:32] got to be this or there's got to be that
[58:33] but there's just a christ that i'm
[58:35] married to and he's the one that's
[58:37] feeding my soul
[58:40] and thank god that there's still
[58:42] churches today that are introducing this
[58:44] christ
[58:44] and pointing to christ and lifting this
[58:46] crashed up so that sheep of this fold
[58:48] could come to a place where
[58:50] the christ is lifted up and they can be
[58:52] led and they can be fed
[58:53] by christ who is their savior
[58:56] he would worship with him and feast with
[58:58] him that's in christ
[59:01] not in any particular church and not in
[59:04] any tabernacle
[59:09] so in the book of ruth with that as a
[59:11] foundation i'd like to turn to my text
[59:13] now
[59:15] and uh if we could just preach the
[59:17] summer started yet
[59:19] now i'm going to end i'm going to end
[59:21] here as a matter of fact i'll ask
[59:24] brother micah and brother loyal to come
[59:26] just to create expectation for a close
[59:30] i could get carried away in this so i
[59:34] want to be very
[59:35] strict in how i express this in the
[59:36] close it says
[59:39] the two went until they came to
[59:41] bethlehem
[59:44] and it came to pass when they were come
[59:46] to bethlehem
[59:48] bethlehem means in the hebrew house of
[59:51] bread
[59:52] the word their bread is even used of
[59:54] food
[59:58] jesus christ had to be born in bethlehem
[1:00:02] why because he is the house of god's
[1:00:05] bread
[1:00:07] and notice what's beautifully being
[1:00:09] represented in the book of ruth i'm just
[1:00:10] i wanted to go backwards
[1:00:13] you know i'm going to introduce the
[1:00:14] introduce this and i i trust personally
[1:00:16] i hope and i hope that the lord will
[1:00:18] allow me to go into this next wednesday
[1:00:23] ruth what is it call
[1:00:27] the mobitus ruth the gentile
[1:00:32] comes to bethlehem you think about the
[1:00:36] story and i just i don't want to give
[1:00:37] too much away
[1:00:38] necessarily or get too far down the road
[1:00:40] in it not giving anything away but just
[1:00:42] start getting ahead of myself and
[1:00:43] feeling like i want to take more time to
[1:00:44] expound upon this but just ponder these
[1:00:46] things
[1:00:48] it was famine that caused israelites
[1:00:53] to leave and to go into moab
[1:00:56] so they left because of famine and as a
[1:00:59] result of the famine
[1:01:01] and them leaving these two
[1:01:04] hebrew boys marry this one if i could
[1:01:07] just say
[1:01:08] mary's ruth and naomi's husband dies and
[1:01:12] ruth's husband dies and orpa's husband
[1:01:13] dies but we know
[1:01:14] that naomi goes i got to go back i got
[1:01:17] to go back to israel i got to go back to
[1:01:19] the promised land i got to go back to
[1:01:20] where i come from
[1:01:22] and she persuaded her orphan to stay and
[1:01:23] she said fine i'll go back but there was
[1:01:25] something in ruth
[1:01:27] that wouldn't let her stay back
[1:01:30] and so you have in this image of a
[1:01:33] famine that caused these circumstances
[1:01:36] famine and death is how the book of ruth
[1:01:39] opens
[1:01:41] and it's famine that causes this gentile
[1:01:44] woman
[1:01:45] to come to bethlehem and when she comes
[1:01:49] to bethlehem
[1:01:51] she doesn't come in a famine
[1:01:54] she comes at the beginning of barley
[1:01:57] harvest
[1:02:01] and you ruth you've come
[1:02:05] not during a time of a famine but you've
[1:02:08] come
[1:02:10] at harvest time and so the
[1:02:13] the the invitation
[1:02:17] that i'm expressing is come to bethlehem
[1:02:23] ruth is you if you as you ponder the
[1:02:25] story her trajectory of life
[1:02:29] excuse me she wasn't aiming for it
[1:02:33] she was just kind of walking in what was
[1:02:35] taking place and doing the best she
[1:02:36] could and following what was in her
[1:02:37] heart but what did god have all along
[1:02:40] she just happened in the place
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:44] happened but it was there she met
[1:02:47] the kinsmen come to bethlehem
[1:02:53] this is what the voice of revelation 3
[1:02:54] 20 calls to you
[1:02:56] he says come to bethlehem come to the
[1:02:59] house of god's bread
[1:03:01] aren't you thankful to be feasting on
[1:03:03] the bread of life let's stand together
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:14] tonight
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:23] let's bow our heads in prayer
[1:03:27] if you need a touch from the lord
[1:03:28] tonight i just i invite you to
[1:03:30] lift your hand as an expression to him
[1:03:33] saying lord
[1:03:34] i'm lifting up a hand of hunger and
[1:03:36] thirsting
[1:03:38] you know your circumstances in life and
[1:03:40] you know just even
[1:03:41] you know
[1:03:44] better than myself just how supernatural
[1:03:46] the service has been for you
[1:03:49] if it's met a need just lift your hands
[1:03:50] to him and accept it and receive it now
[1:03:52] in the name of the lord
[1:03:54] if you have a heart's cry or a hunger
[1:03:55] just lift your hands to him and say lord
[1:03:57] i have this need
[1:03:58] in my life take him for all that you
[1:04:01] need
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:03] there's a place he wants to meet you
[1:04:07] personally and manifest himself to you i
[1:04:10] i feel that almost
[1:04:12] i don't know if there's any hand that
[1:04:13] wasn't raised tonight
[1:04:16] we're all in one accord then think of
[1:04:19] that right now believers
[1:04:21] everyone has raised their hands from the
[1:04:22] youngest to the oldest
[1:04:24] raise their hands we're all of the same
[1:04:26] mind now
[1:04:28] ask don't be afraid to ask the things
[1:04:31] that can transpire right now are
[1:04:33] limitless with god don't be afraid to
[1:04:37] ask of the things that you've been
[1:04:38] afraid to ask for
[1:04:40] don't be afraid to ask for the things
[1:04:42] that maybe seem to have been so elusive
[1:04:44] but don't ask a miss
[1:04:45] ask believing ask for the right reasons
[1:04:48] our gracious heavenly father tonight
[1:04:49] it's been such a tremendous
[1:04:51] atmosphere and even now lord as we gave
[1:04:54] an invitation to the people to lift
[1:04:56] their hands to you
[1:04:58] to make a request every single hand in
[1:05:00] the building went up lord
[1:05:03] with the unity like this lord i believe
[1:05:05] that you're moving in people's hearts
[1:05:07] and that things right now could happen
[1:05:10] of supernatural quality and significance
[1:05:14] a lord whatever need was represented by
[1:05:15] the lifting of hands whatever need is
[1:05:17] being lifted to you through a whispered
[1:05:19] voice whatever need is being lifted to
[1:05:20] you
[1:05:21] from the cry of one's heart i ask now
[1:05:23] father that you would come and meet that
[1:05:24] need
[1:05:26] lord regardless of the condition of
[1:05:28] laodicea regardless of the condition of
[1:05:29] the church world regardless of the
[1:05:31] condition of denominations in religion
[1:05:34] there's still a voice calling to the
[1:05:35] elect
[1:05:38] whether it be come out of her and open
[1:05:40] the door and
[1:05:42] come up higher there's a voice that's
[1:05:44] calling out to us
[1:05:46] [Music]
[1:05:47] which is an introduction to you jesus
[1:05:49] christ
[1:05:49] [Music]
[1:05:51] the privilege of sitting at your table
[1:05:53] and feasting
[1:05:55] and i asked lord that you would grant an
[1:05:57] abundant grace to us as we are fighting
[1:05:59] battles that we never thought we would
[1:06:00] fight
[1:06:02] as we're facing enemies that we thought
[1:06:04] were long vanquished
[1:06:07] as we're wrestling with things that the
[1:06:08] devil would want us to think are
[1:06:10] elementary and
[1:06:11] we should have conquered that a long
[1:06:12] time ago
[1:06:14] lord we're asking for grace tonight and
[1:06:18] i pray that you would give to your
[1:06:19] people the rest
[1:06:21] that your word brings the comfort of the
[1:06:24] holy ghost and the comfort of one
[1:06:25] another
[1:06:27] that we would be encouraged and
