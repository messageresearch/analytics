TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in Matthew chapter 24 I want to just read it again very quickly just to kind of reset it says for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect this is one of brother branham's key scriptures in the sermon the seed of discrepancy and we've been taking from the seated discrepancy some different statements and going down a path to continue on this subject of the kingdom and over the last few Services I can't remember just how many parts it was we've been looking at worldly kingdoms and the worldly kingdoms are the discrepancy that was sown by Satan in the beginning and that discrepancy one of the key things we're focusing in on is it's a contradiction to what's already been that's the definition that brother Branham gave the discrepancy it's not just something different as you'll study and the word of God as you study nature you see the God's the god of variety he said there's a God of differences and different seasons and in times and manifestations I've been studied on the tree of life and in the Jewish tradition some rabbis taught in the midrash and the different oral Traditions they believed that the tree of life is going to put forth thousands of different varieties of fruit and Eternity so God is a god of variety he's a god of differences but the seated discrepancy is actually a contradiction to what has been not a contradiction in the sense that this is sweet and this is sour but the contradiction in that maybe it tastes very very similar but says oh no it's not sour but it's sweet and so that's the that's what the discrepancy is and we know that God used Satan's ambition he used his pride his his pretense and even his political uh inclinations and his politics God used it against Satan he used that ambition and I think maybe the way that I've looked at it in the past is kind of he said it he said a trap using Satan's ambition he said a trap to manifest his attributes and in doing that manifest Redemption and I want to read read one statement and in doing so it's going to kind of hopefully capture some of the momentum that we've been on through these first few Services says in the sermon the seat of discrepancy now we find when God sowed his seed in the Garden of Eden and he calls it his first harvest of human beings he says we find out that it brought forth an able that would be Adam and the woman bringing forth a child that would be in the image of Adam Adam who was in the originally in the image of God he says but when Satan sowed his seat of discrepancy it brought forth the cane where did he sow it into human beings into the field it brought forth the cane one brought forth a righteous one one brought forth an unrighteous one because the eve listened to the word of discrepancy contrary to the word of God so there's a spiritual failure first in her mind she receives that lie that Satan's deforming poison that opened up to the literal physical seed of Cain coming forth and it started the ball of sin rolling right there and has rolled ever since we saw how false religion begins to manifest to Genesis chapter four we can fall it right on through to Babel in Babylon all the way to the very end where Babylon is the church it's a woman that's represented in the end and we'll come back to that in Greater detail but I wanted to read again the statement here in Matthew chapter 24 24 because this to me is a scripture that picks up uh the culmination of all the seeds that Satan had sowed in the beginnings they had planted in the beginning now what Christ is referring to in Matthew 24 24 is kind of the time of the Harvest of the wheat and tares when Babylon comes to its power to its Perfection if we could use that phrase and the church is coming to her Perfection and the two Vines have grown up and there it's time for the Harvest the wheat and Terrors have come to full maturity time for the Harvest Jesus uses this for this to describe the end timer characterizes the culmination of Satan's planting for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they the false Christ and false prophets shall deceive the very elect and it's a statement that we know very very well and there's ways that we maybe kind of paraphrase it to see the very like if it were possible but we recognize that there's going to be some manifestation and there's going to be some culmination or climax that by all appearances looks very Christian or christ-like looks very powerful and beautiful god-like if I could say that or presents the word of God and presents the things of God and the nature of God in such a way to where there's some part of us that would want to say oh wow that's beautiful or that's great or that seems sensible and that seems right or I could enjoy that whatever it might be that this flesh may be drawn to so it's going to be so tremendous that but for God the election because we know it's the elect who are not deceived if God had not just elected that you would not fall for the trick you would and so I I emphasize that just so that we're more depending upon him right depending upon the spirit depend on the word of God uh to not fall for Satan's tricks than we are to be like I think I've got this figured out I know what it looks like I know what it does I've just been you know fellowshipping on different things and studying different things and boy there's sometimes you you find a quote and you just grab it you're like oh man this is it this is the doozy this is going to pin it down and you stake everything on it this is wrong brother Braham said this this is wrong and then next thing you know the person says oh yeah but what about all these other quotes hey oh well okay well let me put that one up let me think about this and what so we're trusting in the Holy Spirit to give us guidance and Leadership to recognize these things so I want to take a step further in this the subject and um I I'm going to give a different uh title to it to Edens and in looking at this I'm specifically looking at two different Edens I'm not narrowing it down to only two Edens because I'll kind of tell you there's going to be a turd eating that's coming that Eternal one so it's not just these two Edens there's going to be another one but I want to look at two Edens God's Eden you can send me the original Eden and Satan's Eden and look at how that these are perfect types and and I love the way that brother Brandon puts it and I'll read from two places uh where he talks about it here in just a moment but he calls them types because what God did in the beginning we've been saying was kind of seed form and just the alpha then what Satan does is he comes next and so that's then we have Satan's Eden and this kind of the maybe the blueprint for where we're going but there will be God is always the Omega Satan can't be the one that has the final saying say God doesn't sow seed then Satan sow seed and then God's like oh well we're just going to figure this out but God had already sowed into the seed something to come and already had a plan to come and the Satan does his move and he makes his move but God is going to have the final say God is the Alpha and the Omega Satan comes into in between but it's going to be in the end that whatever was typed is going to be fully manifest and so here in God's power to transform brother Branham says here notice the type of the two Edens so closely type together to almost deceive the very elected Matthew 24 24 said it would be that way so this Eden these two in these two Edens if we have a Gods Eden and Satan's Eden he's saying uh that this one is so close to the first that it could deceive according to Matthew 24 24 but I want us to stop for a few moments and consider these two Edens and one thing especially how the Bible tells us that God's word did produce that Eden and how God's word warns us that a other Eden would come so there's the two things that we're pondering that God's word produced in Eden and God's word told us another Eden would come then he visits it again just over a month later month and a half later in power of transformation he says here notice the second Eden typed closely to the first to deceive almost to take the elected so the second eating types so closely to the first and he says these two Edens how this Eden has tried to type just like Satan did at the beginning to even the real Eden the first Eden just watch them type together now I know that that statement um it maybe seems a little bit bulky but there's two Edens and this one Eden is has tried to type this second Eden is tried to type the first to reproduce the first uh just like Satan did at the beginning to the eve and the real Eden how he misrepresented something he says the first the the first Eden just watch them type together now he's comparing them together so those are the two Edens the original eating the beginning and this next one that comes now if you'll allow me to for just a few moments I want to kind of cover a lot of stuff that we've been ministering on uh not just in this series but I think even a lot of ways it's the last couple series we've been ministering on and just look again at God's Eden we're looking at Genesis chapter one Genesis chapter 2 and look at God's Eden that's the original Eden that God uh brought forth by the spoken word and so God brings it forth by the spoken word and uh there's there's a lot um I've just been saving some things to maybe just take some time as a church in Genesis chapter 1 verse one even just looking at that and then even to verse three the things in the beginning because the more I'm reading in the message there I say that brother Branham has put in a lot of emphasis on those first three verses that when God did something something was broadcast and that it's that in such a way toward even uh there there's a way that you could look at it that's the moment at which God spoke everything and from that moment on it just manifest from that it's just things are coming forth from what our what he already said and so when God speaks it and brings forth the heavens and the Earth and God brings forth he plants the original Eden he brings everything for if you want to look at those 6 000 years or those six days it was all pregnant with the seed within itself to bring forth and Eden scripturally is a place of pleasure or Delight even in the the Hebrew word uh that is used even in other places even when Sarah says me have pleasure with my Lord the word she used there is conjugated from Eden so Eden is a place of pleasure or Delight or something that gives pleasure even the the Hebrew word for Heaven is gone Eden which is the Garden of Eden so to Hebrew when they think of Heaven they use the even the phrase the future Paradise is the Garden of Eden so that's what that's what Eden represents Eden brother bam says is the great Paradise of God so think of that characterization that Eden is a place of Happiness the phrase Paradise in the Persian is um the King's Garden so that something that had to do with something that was preeminent so when God creates um the earth and the world your heavens and the Earth it's a throne for God it's going to be his pleasure Garden but then he puts man as representative of him into that and so if I could say this this uh this Kingdom that God is bringing forth hid the kingdom like it's a mystery that's bound up within it and so brother man makes this statement and God's power to transform God in six thousand years those are the six days of creation had planted all these wonderful seeds and then notice how he says or he had spoke his word and so again there's that there's that clue about how uh even when he said let there be light there's a clue there to what he's done he spoke his word and so his word is the original seed that must produce to even think that God says a virgin shall conceive is spoke it's got to happen it's got to come to pass and it will come to pass even to the point where Jesus says these rocks will cry out if it says that there's going to be praise given if it says there's going to be this happen even if we didn't do our part God's part will come to pass because the spoken word must produce and we've been using Genesis 2 25 how that in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and then everything comes forth and then God frames it with the man and his wife were both naked and we're not ashamed Billy Graham calls it God's economy Arrangement order of Innocence there was no sin they knew no sin and even they were even though they were naked there was no shame in that nakedness and they were not ashamed and they were even hid from anything that would lack in in other words if I could put it this way if someone was to say did you know you're naked they could say no but why does that matter because there was no shame there's no lacking it wasn't like oh oh no you mean you mean and to kind of sell them short everything was just perfect and everything was just set perfectly in order now you all are just pulling very very nicely this morning it's wonderful now this is a key phrase that I hope can carry forward through the rest of this sermon in Satan's Eden the brother man says this about God having faith in all his word his seeds brought forth an Eden of Holiness love and eternal life so how did the Eden come forward God's faith in his own word God by faith in his word brought forth an Eden of uh Holiness love and eternal life that's what God's Eden produced Holiness and it brought an Eden of Holiness of love understanding Perfection and eternal life and he said that's what God's planting and that's what it'll be at the end so there's your but it's by his faith in the word God had faith in his own word so he's not asking you to do anything that he hasn't done already so he had faith in his own word and it produces this Eden and it was all God's right it was all of his creation and that's why there's there's this the statement that uh is I think it's in the Hebrew where it kind of more assumes this that whenever their reference who referenced God even to a Jew and they reference God it's he who spoke and the world came into existence and that's one way they always characterize yahweh's the one who spoke and brought the world into existence so that you would realize that I don't care who you worship all these gods of your imagination all this mythology all these other creations that you have that are man's there's one who spoke and the world came into existence so it was all under his control everything was perfect um God was satisfied when he looked at his creation he was satisfied it's good it's good it's good it's very good and so everything was in harmony there was peace that reigned and God set his headquarters over all this creation heavens and earth if he looked at it as a singular creation he said his headquarters in the Garden of Eden that's a word terminology brother Adam uses there was his headquarters and so that being the headquarters it was symbolic of the capital city symbolic of the throne it's symbolic of of that Chief place that it's all the kingdom but this is the one place uh where it's all my power is represented and my presence is represented where my presence will be and the first Eden God's original Eden we're just looking at that first Eden that Satan tries to type so well this first Eden began with the garden now this is this is for me in looking at this I thought it was remarkable God's first Eden begins as a garden but then in eternity it brings forth the city of God so God started very simple and and then as it progresses and grows it ends up as a city but notice how quickly Cain built the city God plants a garden and one day it'll grow to be a city but Satan just right off the bat wants something quick and Cain builds a city right right away and so as God built begins with the garden and he takes man and he places him in that Garden of Eden and he sets there him there to be the ruler and have dominion over all the Earth and so though God had control over this Eden and had control over the whole creation he had control over Eden and the garden at the East of Eden God then turns it all over to his son Adam and his wife the woman and he gives it to them and he says here all power is yours to rule and Reign Over Eden and now the God who had complete control has transferred control to Adam and his wife do we believe that I trust that you you accept that according to the message of the hour where he said be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth and have dominion over everything there is in other words Adam had the power to speak and control creation he he had even named creation he would have been a God on Earth ruling and reigning with full power and control if you wanted to walk on water he could if you wanted to stop the winds he could if he wanted to whatever he wanted to do he and his wife had full control and it was now as God creates this Eden there is it's a place now that God wants to he's wanting to be become it's in his nature to become again not just to have but to become as we say even that word the Hava is not to have something but it's God who wants to become something so the invisible is working himself to expression and the Creator expresses himself back in creation and so he is in his creation so when he creates heavens and earth he creates an Eden a garden in Eden he places man there we can say Eden was God's Cathedral it was his exalted throne and this is it represented there's God's temple in God's Tabernacle and those are key phrases that I think are important for us to understand what God was doing the Tabernacle the tintel uh the the temple this is his tent this is something he wants to inhabit and when God achieves this in Genesis chapter two it's a perfect picture of the dwelling place that Christ and his bride become brother Graham says Adam was a type of Christ in every figure he said the first Adam and Eve typed the second Adam and Eve so here is God giving forth a type and just like that devil he types the type so here God gives the type and it's just a prototype and Satan's trying to copy the Prototype he's like that's not even that's not even fully released yet it's just and he's going to market with the Prototype but get it after hurry hurry build a city right and here Satan comes and he's working off of God's type and he's typing a type and that's a lesson for us that sometimes types types right right itches our ears but we don't look for types we look for truth identified truth identify the word of God once you find the truth if I could say this the truth is enough but then just kind of maybe the the extra sauce or whatever the sizzle is when you start seeing it typed but you start with the truth but a lot of people start with the type they start with the numbers they start with the times and the seasons and the the current events and they start there and work their way backwards to the message of the hour work their way backwards to the word but we start with the word which is truth and then we see the types and here God starts with the word and brings something forth in type but what does the devil do he types the type doesn't have the truth he types the type and that's a real lesson for us to understand about these Edens So Adam was the type of Christ and every figure Even Adam and the woman were a type of Christ and his bride it says in Isaiah 66 verse 1. I'm looking at God's Cathedral his Tabernacle his tent he says thus saith the Lord the heaven is my throne and your Earth is my footstool remember how that's even represented in Adam who is Heavenly and Earthly bound to Earth Supernatural joining together with him the supernatural Spirit coming into him and how the heaven is the throne the Earth Heaven fastened to the Earth and that becomes God's Throne he says where is the house that you will build unto me and where is the place of my rest where is it going to be it can't be made by man but God's the one who makes his dwelling place and so he creates Heaven and Earth and nature and all that is therein and then he he wants to indwell man his brother man says Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple so God created man when he brought forth man and he brings him forth on that day he's saying he is going to be my Cathedral he's going to be my temple this is who's going to be my dwelling place and that's what God wanted he wanted to become one with that he wanted to step into that and so this is God's uh this is God's Temple this is God's place of rest this is God's house and remember as we just read from the church age book chapter three Man was created for God to be a temple of God brother man says Satan knew this and that's why sin came the way that it did this is why he was in Eden is because when he sees it in that sixth day that man comes forth and the woman comes forth he recognizes this is God's Dwelling Place this is what God wants to become this is even the the image I'm rebelling against in heaven this is this is that this is what is going to assume that placeholder so he comes against it and fights against it brother Brandon says in the sermon who is this Melchizedek he's quoting from John chapter one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God then he skips down to verse 14 I believe it was and then the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us and so here is the this expression of the word the word made flesh and when the word is made flesh it dwells Among Us and we know that in the in the coming down of God the God above us then God With Us and now it's not just God With Us in his son becoming flesh and dwelling among us but now to dwell in us so that's how where God is going he says Abraham says hold that there now notice his first being was Spirit Supernatural all right the great eternal God's first Spirit Supernatural Eternal remember Adam his first Supernatural first Spirit second he began to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body so when God the great invisible Eternal one forms himself into a theophany uh and this Elohim gains its expression it's from that that he creates had he not and again maybe if I'm just uh there's a little bit of speculation on my part please forgive me but had God just created something Beyond himself and gave expression to something uh maybe just for lack of better terms it could have been awkward right the very first thing that would come forth would be I'm the only one I'm God this is it but God actually forms himself first and now he's going to begin to create from that so that everything else that comes is secondary two the one that always was and so God now as he brings forth and recognize that in the heaven of Heavens in the Supernatural Heavens that there was order there was Angels there was things that existed then and so now when he forms himself that he says he began to form himself towards flesh so the Supernatural is first then he begins to form himself towards flesh and then the and if I could say that we see that uh we see that typed in Adam but if I could just skip a lot God whose invisible forms himself into into the logos is the phrase we use of that and now when he does that as he has assumed some form that's not the final form that's not that's not God's ultimate to him he's not like oh man the logos just worship the logos worship the logos even if we look at it that way that's just the thought it's the fullness and the full of it but he wants the expression of it and so he forms himself he wants to form himself towards flesh so when the word became flesh in Jesus Christ that is what he was aiming towards so it says in Hebrews 10 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offering that what it's not but a body hast thou prepared me brother Birmingham says God prepared himself a body in the form of the Lord Jesus so that's when God began to form himself towards flesh Jesus Christ then he becomes that flesh that God was moving towards that's what God wanted to move into that's what God wanted to come into and that's what Adam and the woman typed is in pre-figure and with if I could even say maybe the potential of it that God would come and dwell in and become one with his creation the Bible says in Colossians 2 9 4 in him Christ dwelth all the fullness of the godhead bodily so this is God coming to man Christ the man Christ Jesus not born of a a of sinful flesh not born of an act between a man and a woman but fully created by God the beginning of the creation of God all the fullness of God dwells in him so he thou becomes the dwelling place of the word the word is made flesh now I know that we this is mentioned so often that really the the full gravity of it I think sometimes escapes us but when you are born again you become a new creature in Christ Jesus your new creation by virtue of the birth in your soul your soul then becomes pure like Adams was before he fell becomes pure as if there was no sin because it's born again of Incorruptible seed and by that regeneration and by you having a soul now that exists uniquely indifferent from anyone else who doesn't have the birth God can come back into you and dwell in you and influence you and motivate you and begin to work with you and grow and cultivate that life that has been birthed down into the soul to the point to where Paul says in First Corinthians 6 19 what no you're not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own so then now we not just Christ but now we are the temple of God God made man to be his Temple the resting place of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit today finds rest in his children the Holy Spirit today finds rest in you isn't it interesting how much we cry out for rest Lord I need rest for my weary soul I need rest for my mind that's always racing and I don't know what it is about laying down horizontally that makes my mind just kind of fire on and begin to work on all cylinders and Lord I just need rest I just need rest I just need rest he's kind of like huh that's what I need it's what I want that's what I'm looking for in you maybe we could just invert it a little bit when we call it when we're mind is racing and we feel a little bit of discombobulated mind you just say Lord find Rest in Me Lord I welcome you come find rest find peace in me Lord just come come to your temple come to your Tabernacle because our body is a temple of the Holy Ghost now as we've been kind of able to look at God's Eden and what it typed and where God was wanting to move towards flesh incarnation we know that in Genesis chapter 3 then came the wicked one he's the one that begins to sow the tares and he caused man and now this is you'll be able to grab a hold of these principles especially from the breach in different places he caused man to lose control in other words God had handed something as it were to the man and the woman and said here is title here's full control you have uh you have full dominion and it had a clause in it except if you eat of this that day you die so there was a there was a provision in that title that was conveyed there was a restrictive covenant if I could say that to where now as Abraham called it conditional that now you have full writing title full use and enjoyment and power over the Earth but if you ever cross this line you're going to lose control or lose power and the title deed is we could use that just as a way to convey to describe this conveyance the title deed to Heaven and Earth went back to the original owner so when when Satan causes them to lose control now now it's chaotic because control has been lost but Satan does not get his hands on the book Satan by virtue of this hybriding Satan has not gained control in the sense that he has title to Heaven and Earth but now that the title has gone back to the father and it goes back into the hands of the original owner and as he begins to speak consequence and curse you could see that God is the glory of God is withdrawing and the power of God is being taken away to her now man is going to fend for himself on an earth that he no longer controls you're going to fight with the ground now Beast is going to be uh adversarial to you and there's going to be enmity there's going to be Wars and fightings because man no longer controls Heaven and Earth and his brother man uses the phrase cavity to describe Satan's uh poison how it deformed he said it created a cavity so the fall of pure Man created a cavity or if I could say this a vacuum for Satan to begin to build his kingdom now this if if Adam and the woman had God not set the things in motion and well if I could I'll just say this way there's God could certainly place the man and a woman in such a way to her no matter how much Satan tried to do right no how much he tried to go around and chirp and chatter just had no effect it could have been bound by manifested son and daughter completely bound no plate no way to work even in the service like no sorry move move along right just power to bind uh every evil spirit power to bind any wrong inclination God could have certainly made it made it that way but now when the absence of the glory of God in the absence of the title deed this creates and even with the cavity that's now formed in Cain in his line after him Satan has a channel to begin to work through and so when it says in Ezekiel thou Hast been 28 13 thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God he had a mode of an objective and brother Brown uses Isaiah 14 Ezekiel 28 and he's using this when he builds God of this evil age and Satan's Eden he's a very very important scriptures to him he's wanting us to recognize this world we're living in and the things that are at the end and he says in Satan's Eden it's been and now is Satan establishing his kingdom in the Earth this is why he was in the Garden of Eden the Garden the Bible says of God God's Eden Satan finds himself in God's Eden Satan's establishing his kingdom in the earth that's exactly why he's doing it for he wants to establish his own kingdom so what Satan wants to do is he wants to establish his own kingdom so we have to kind of get that settled in there right quick that this is what Satan wants to do he wants to establish his own kingdom now if you could take your Bibles and turn to uh first second Thessalonians chapter 2. I hope that in this this is um we'll move along uh for you all these are I want to read in several places in the scripture and a couple places a little bit lengthy but I'm wanting you to recognize if I could say Ezekiel 28 13 thou has been in the garden of God and what the ambition was to do and in Isaiah Chapter 14 verse 12 or even in that expanded section the desire of Lucifer in the beginning was to be like God and and he wanted to exalt himself above the stars of God uh and this he wanted to sit on the Mount of the congregation the sides of the north this is Satan saying I want to be able to create I want to bring forth life this is what I want to be at the Capstone I want to be at the top and I want to have my downline he's the first original pyramid schemer and and so he is he's the one that's wanting to do it by false means and so he's wanting to do this right he's wanting to accomplish something so in second Thessalonians 2 1-8 now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ these phrases man or there's mouthfuls and by our gathering together unto him and what a beseeching that ye be not soon shaken in mind so there's one thing he doesn't want us to be or be troubled how by Spirit neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us listen don't be afraid of artificial intelligence replicating sermons and voices and videos and images Paul was even afraid that they would uh Forge his handwriting and send out make letters and we made it right God saw through it all God preserved it God had a way so he said nor by that letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand so there was a something very particular about the day of Christ so now that day of Christ he says let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a fallen away first so there has to be a fall in a way that happens first maybe different ways we could look at that but there's first a fallen away and that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition so there's a fallen away and then after this Fallen away some at some point after this the man of sin is going to be revealed and this man of sin is called the Son of Perdition now notice how Paul describes the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God seated discrepancy he opposes and contradicts and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped because God is the one only one who's due worship so that he why why does he do this so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God now that's quite a statement that he what he wants to do his ambition and what he's trying to achieve is to exalt himself above the sons of God the stars of God so that he is worshiped and he wants to find himself resident within and controlling and living in the temple of God showing himself that he is God what now think of that and how brother Branham says God reserved for himself the right to indwell man so when Cain comes forth as not purely human and Satan can begin to indwell Mankind and animate him and possess him he's kind of saying this is what God wanted all right this is what God wanted all along and if you look I said well yeah that that's a human being that's Homo Sapien and clearly this is evil and this is a devil possession and so there's a way that by possessing he's saying this is what God reserved I I am God by being to possess and animate and Inspire and enthuse and these things is that not what God is is that not what God does so he's showing himself that he is God wherein we know that oh when Christ came he's the pure Original Seed God descends Heaven descends the spirit descends And indwells that son showing this is the seed that I've reserved for myself right insane it's like hmm so what was going on these last four thousand years what was all this should have thought of that before you tried to play chess hey so God now Satan's trying to show himself as God he says remember the not that when I was yet with you I told you these things so Paul's asked him if he they remembered what he preached he says and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time so now you know why this is there's some things that are withholding and waiting and as he says he that letteth will let till she she the bride be taken out of the way so there's certain things that cannot come into their fullness till the bride is gone now this is the key phrase I've been wanting to build to In this passage for the mystery of iniquity death already work so there is a mystery of iniquity working only he who now letteth will let hear this verse is until she the bride be taken out of the way so the mystery of iniquities working God is withholding the fullness the full manifestation until the bride be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked one be revealed now there's there's some layers to this because it mystery of iniquity that Wicked one there's the man of sin the Son of Perdition it almost seems in some ways symbolic and cryptic and this wicked one will be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming now if I could say this this son of perdition this man of sin this wicked is exposed and exposed under the opening of the seals coming all the way back to White Horse where I said no that's not Christ this is that Wicked one this is just as he rode out against humanity in the garden and he was building his Babylon uh through the Old Testament now we see that he's doing the same thing to the church this mystery of iniquity doth already work and it's going to be working and this man of sin is not going to be incarnate now maybe getting ahead of myself until the bride is taken out of the way and it's the open of the seals that reveals him or exposes him not in his manifestation to his own but to the elect and in doing so it destroys the power of Satan's deception over the elect and notice how it says the mystery of iniquity where was iniquity first found in Lucifer and so the mystery of iniquity it begins as a mystery but then it will be incarnate in the man of sin or the Son of Perdition now remember Satan is only impersonating so there's a mystery that begins first as the mystery of iniquity and we know in Satan's kingdom that it's going to be incarnate in the man of sin and what is he doing he's mimicking God's pattern where there's a mystery first and then flesh second this is Satan's Satan's pattern and so Jesus says in John 17 12 look at mystery of iniquity and then how it's going to become fully incarnate in what we call the Antichrist while I was at with him in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou Hast gave this to me I have kept in none of them is lost so he could say that none that he was given were lost but there is going to be one that is lost and he says he's not the original because they're the one he was given none can be plucked out of his hand he says but the Son of Perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled just as Adam and the woman were a pre-figure of Christ and his bride now Abel and Cain were a pre-figure of Christ the Incarnate God and Judas incarnate devil and if you could follow in this this the scope of things in the beginning God we have creation Satan deforming creation have these thousands of years of history that primarily revolve around Israel and then when we come to Christ it you have what you have produced then in the days of Christ is Jesus Christ the son of God Genesis 1 28 Genesis 3 15 The Original Seed in flesh that God can dwell in and therefore there has to be there has to be a component that Satan is trying to achieve and whether Satan is being calculated or not and said oh the Messiah is here well it's time from it's time for my Judas it's time for my enmity it's time for my murder it's time for me to waiting to snatch them whether it's not that Satan had to be deliberate about that part but God allows Judas to be then the twin the twin to Christ that one that that mimic weed and as he comes forth as the Incarnate devil in Judas in Luke 22 3 we read that then entered Satan into Judas so just as God came in Heaven and Earth embraced and Heaven Earth kissed and embraced and dwelt in Christ now we see hell coming up because Satan brother says Judas was from hell and he went back to Hell the Son of Perdition he's a product of Hell he's the product of this evil design Satan then indwells him then Satan entered into Judas now and and what I'm doing today if I if I have if you haven't recognized already I'm kind of just moving along trying to move along in this chronologically in some ways and so recognize this scription first Timothy 3 16. if someone could keep track of all the times I say and so I'd appreciate the data on it I'm going to try to get rid of it and so in first Timothy 3 16 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness now could we not agree that there's a lot of controversy with respect to the mystery of iniquity and so now this is the contrast without controversy great is the mystery of godliness the mystery of iniquity which is going to be incarnate as Paul is saying in second Thessalonians 2 The Mystery of iniquity death already worked but it will not be full incarnate fully expressed fully manifested till the bride be taken out of the way so now we have great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preaching the Gentiles believed on in the world received up in the glory so here's the hidden truth of God likeness the mystery of godliness is that God would be manifest in flesh the mystery of godliness or equality was manifested in the man Christ Jesus the mystery of God likeness the mystery of equality the mystery of godliness is made flesh as there would have been this mystery of God from the beginning and they would refer to him as the one whose folk in the world came into existence the one whose name cannot be mentioned the one who is above all the one who's the greatest the one who's the preeminent the Lord of lords the god of gods the one that they would refer to now this mystery of godliness this thing that was mysterious that man sought after that the questions were bound up in him to know his creator it is manifested in Jesus Christ the mystery of godliness in Christ the last Adam the tree of life right the Tree of Life in the beginning the Tree of Life In Christ so we could see this these are just quick building blocks try to wrap up God's Eden you have in God's original Eden the tree of life now you have Christ who comes forth as the tree of life that was there in the beginning and then you're going to have a tree of life in the end in the Eternal City of God there's going to be a tree of life and so Incarnation has not stopped because what does brother bam teaches in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he brings forth a bride tree which will be the Tree of Life restored back to him as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden so in the gone Eden in the garden of the in heaven in the heaven of heavens and the Eternal City there's going to be a tree of life which will be you and Christ there is God's Eden and we're looking at Satan's Eden though how it types God's Eden and how that he comes as a wicked one into God's Eden and it's the mystery of iniquity and what he's moving towards and what he's trying to accomplish and so this other Eden as we're going to call it another Eden or Satan's Eden it's Satan's kingdom that he's been wanting to build and brother bear says it's built up to its Pinnacle now it calls it civilization and there was a I read it last week and how brother how brother Brown said that civilization began civilization is not of God and there's a philosopher and he would have been alive at the time that brother Branham was on Earth so I'm not sure if brother Branham read this it says man is civilized not in his not proportionally to his capacity to believe but in his willingness to doubt I was like thank you philosopher God bless you right it's exactly what brother Bram said That civilization a man is not civilized in proportion to his ability to believe but he becomes civilized proportionally to his willingness or his capacity to doubt and brothers uses the exact same language to say civilization is of the devil and it formed from doubt in unbelief why because man is not trusting in God he's trusting in himself to civilize and to bring forth civilization which is Satan's ambition through that self-awareness and pretense I'm not barbaric I'm not half human and half beast don't look at how civilized I am and brother says civilization is built up to its Pinnacle now so it's coming to its Capstone it's coming to its climax in the sermon God's power to transform is I have my I usually have my my clock up here so I can see what time it is and it it blinked off and I was thinking is that the Lord do I just not to regard time and so if it happens again I won't turn my clock back on it says in God's power to transform Satan's purpose from Eden thou has been and eat in the garden of God was to make his own self an Eden and exalt himself above so the stars of God would worship Him Sons would worship Him and this is the Striking part and he has absolutely carried it out now and when he's done this and brought it into the church is this this is identifying the false christs this is there is a lot that can be said about in terms of being an atheist and agnostic and how many say you know they kind of rationalize with their lack of faith and belief and and they they look at things as a uh well I I I'm better to to doubt uh what I don't know and what I haven't experienced and what I can't see than to believe in something that I can't prove and to believe in something that that's not tangible to me and that's that's the mindset that's the mindset of the agnostics and the atheist but that's not Satan's seat Satan does not want to be worshiped as Satan he wants to be worshiped as God he's not wanting to present himself as a a as an obvious hideous demon he wants to be seen as God so he's identifying the false Christ that deforming power that produced a look-alike now in second Corinthians chapter 11 verses 13 14 and 15 for such are false Apostles deceitful workers I know I'm jumping right into a thought but as we could think back to Matthew 24 Paul is recognizing and identifying as John said the Antichrist spirit is already at work among you and where was it working and where was it moving in false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ now this is this is really strong language and it is clearly saying that demonic spirits can motivate and animate people who are professing to be Christians and even Ministers of God now I don't say that lightly and I certainly don't say it at all to make us all suspicious and say well you're a man of the cloth brother Aaron is it possible I I'm not wanting to sow suspicion I I like one time a minister preached and was preaching he preached so hard against preachers afterwards he was asked he was like he preached against preachers and that's where he says he says well brother do you do you not believe in Preachers I mean because they're very very hard clearly pronounced statement against preachers and he preached against preachers and the guy says well listening to you I believe that you don't believe in Preachers and the preacher's response is what do you think I am a hypocrite it's kind of like so false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light right so I'm not the Angel of Darkness right that's not how Satan presents himself I mean whenever we do voices like that we know whoa that's the devil right but chances are he might be more like I know it's confusing and but you there's a lot of Cults in this world and you can tell by the intolerance and right and we when we get in we're flesh like pass nothing but the devil don't listen to that right you know that's that it's the devil doesn't present himself as this demon half goat half alligator with horns and everything he he comes through he transforms himself into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works so we know Satan Works through impersonation to deceive he does it through that mimic weed the the stowaway seed the evil twin those are the twins of every Revival that's the the false Vine and the True Vine that's that's just replete through the word of God and so there is a representation of the worldly kingdoms as we come to two Edens and we're looking at them what they type and if I could say this now so that maybe this isn't lost Satan now as God has his Eden we know where that ends up but now it's just a type so in terms of the type God's type sayings type in the type but his is just a type but where does his end up feeling the Lake of Fire right that's where it goes and gone no more so it does have an end now brother Brandon says this in Satan's Eden and that's why Satan has done this and he's talking about a kingdom he's saying Satan I believe the just a few paragraphs before Satan's established in his kingdom and Earth he wants to establish his kingdom I think he goes to Isaiah 14 and then he says that's why Satan has done this he wants a kingdom and he's worked through the ministry to do it and God promised he would do now he began by religious deceit and Eden and he's continued ever since so there's a there's the caution the strong caution and and I beseech you to start first in your garden you you you're you are your capacity to be deceived lies within how much carnality exists and I say to see just momentarily let astray it's going to exist first and foremost in how much of the weed thinking you have in your head and how much how much Terrors you've been consuming and how much of the world that that's where it exists because you can't find yourself drunk on the world and the other like well that man's not a man of God right not going to be able to do it you have to look within yourself first and weed out the tears separate everything that offends let's start with this ground let's get this ground clean let's move the beam from my own eye so that I could recognize the sliver like I have to have to start with myself first so before we ever point a finger at all that that person over there and this person over there and this ministry and this move and this Doctrine before we ever point a finger anywhere else say Lord see if there be any wicked way in me see if there be any pretense or Pride or inclination to religion Lord don't make me guilty of pain lip service to the message of the hour in my heart be far from you Lord don't let me worship as a terror I Want To Worship in spirit and in truth Lord that that's the theme for me through in perfect love is that Lord my whole heart is all that will suffice don't let there be any part of my heart that's hypocritical or held back so when we look at this I don't want to be deceived into religion myself but this Matthew chapter 24 is showing us that this is an Eden but I'm calling it an Eden that can be so close and eating it so close to what God's trying to produce what will well he will produce in second Corinthians Chapter 4 verses one to six notice how Paul is connecting Satan's Eden to the beginning that's our that's our that's your lesson that you for the next six verses is try to identify how Paul is connecting Satan's agenda and he exists is where we get the phrase um that the uh the God of this world and then we get God of this evil age and Satan's Eden he says therefore seeing we have this ministry as we've received Mercy we thank not now this is where I want you to begin to recognize but we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty where Satan is a liar your father's a liar he's the father of it he lied in the beginning here we see the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness that brings us back to the image of the serpent that subtle crafty deceitful nor handling the word of God deceitfully that's exactly what the Beast the serpent did in the beginning he handled the word of God deceitfully but now here's the contrary the the true but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God so there's the Satan takes the truth the manifested truth and he handles it deceitly deceitfully with the hidden things of dishonesty walking and crafting his policy and we don't do that we take the manifestation of the truth he says but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world the Lost are in whom are the Lost the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believed not so if you believe not you are lost and it's the God of this world that's that that's quite a phrase the God of this world the God of this age the God of this time the god of these kingdoms is Satan offered every worldly Kingdom to Jesus and Jesus did not dispute his control now maybe we could dispute ultimate ownership right because there's one that holds title to the whole earth the heavens and earth and so God is holding title and letting the devil squat letting the devil do whatever he wants and to occupy these Realms but God holds title Satan just has control and so here is or he has access to control so he says that the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believed not last now notice what this control and what the God of this world his ultimate objective is lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is in the who is the image of God should shine unto them you should be you should think and see an image of Genesis 1. man was made in the image of God let us make man in our image there's your type but now Christ is the Son of God not a type but he is the Fulfillment of the image of God and he says that lest the Glorious gospel of Christ who is in the image of God his gospel should shine because in the beginning let there be light he comes back to it for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake and now he comes back to a creation narrative for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness in the beginning God said let there be light and then we find in um just missing now third or fourth day where he begins to create greater and lesser lights and separates these things further he said god who caused the light to shine of Darkness have shine into our hearts chaotic dark muddled confused to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ and it wasn't lumens that did it right it's not that God has like 10 billion Lumen light the word Shone into our hearts to light up the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ what beautiful connections to in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and God said let there be light and God separate the light from the darkness and he brought forth a beautiful Eden in those days of creation and God has shined his light into our hearts once again into a chaotic flesh in the world that's been marred by darkness and confusion people Paul is saying God has now taken his word and bypassed all the efforts of the God of this world brought forth the son or daughter of God notice how he says the hidden things of dishonesty the walking and craftiness the handling the word deceitfully and the lost because the God of this world has blinded them and covered them over and perverted him and you have the God of this world standing there this is where we get the truth of the God of this evil age is Satan this is how we know that this is Satan's Eden but there in the midst of Satan's Eden God hath shined his light into our hearts that's why he continues we have this treasure in Earthen vessels now in Satan's Eden and I'm just on my my last page of notes Here in Satan's and he says now we find out that every seed bringing forth of its kind there was no death in that Eden there'll be no death in the new Eden there was nothing else but Holiness Purity and eternal life Now by unbelief in all of God's word has brought the seed of unholiness in Satan's Eden remember how this is Brother bam says God with faith in his own word brought forth an Eden of holiness so now Satan by unbelief in God's word has brought a seed of unholiness notice the the opposite God has heavens and earth and or he has the heavens of Heavens he has this beautiful invisible realm and he creates something that's darkness and chaos and he casts Satan down to it if but momentarily that's what it looks like to express something but that's Satan's Satan's realm is this opposite he brought in Eden of unholiness he says we are now entering in where Satan is taking the throne here we're coming to the climax as the Antichrist in an Eden of this Earth and Eden of sin perverted religion this is what the Antichrist Spirit represents this is what's exposed uh not only in the church teaching of a church ages but exposed in the open of the Seven Seals he says he is taking his throne he says he started not upon I am Satan I am the great Angel no and I guess I could have done that in my devil's voice he goes no not upon that but upon perverting God's word I mean I mean God said you can't eat of every tree in the garden right isn't that what he said yeah no we can't eat of the tree of knowledge against evil because if we eat it we die oh sister you'll surely not die God knows that if you eat of that you'll become like him and you'll know good from Evil oh how pleasant it must Ascend how pleasing it was in the way that he spoke and the way that he brought her into it so he says upon perverting God's word he says and that's how he's brought his kingdom in every age this is this is the two Edens God's Eden and now Satan's Eden and now in this great deceitful age ready to take his throne by his people how is he going to do it through people he has built himself an intellectual educated scientific Eden right scientific preachers scientific Church scientific theology everything is scientific everything's based on knowledge the whole church is built upon knowledge it ain't built upon faith let me I want to quote brother Thomas soul he made a statement where he says some things must be done on faith but the most dangerous kind of faith is that which masquerades as science brother Thomas that's uh there's a lot there's a lot that he says there science it's faith masquerade into science that's what science is right it's a faith what is that Faith to doubt God's word it's religion and it takes actually in many ways it takes more faith to accept scientific theory than it would be to believe that there's just a being that's greater than all of us that created it right like it's like I think you need more faith in your religion because actually a Believer because as it says here I mean I gotta I gotta go in there's nothing like a economist to get you distracted but he says everything is based on knowledge the whole church the nominal Church the Eden is built upon knowledge it's not built upon Faith it's built upon science which is a religion masquerading as knowledge it's doubt masquerade in his knowledge it's carnality masquerading is knowledge because we know that knowledge there's a true knowledge that in Hosea it says my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge and because they've rejected knowledge I will also reject thee so you got to be careful that it's not advocating for being ignorant it's not advocating uh for for a lack of knowledge as much as it is exposing the worldly knowledge and the knowledge of this world and the knowledge that science is to think to know is pursuing a part from faith you realize there was a time in the greatest scientist upon Earth were Christians and what they were exploring is not so much ways to prove God wrong but ways to understand God better and the things that he set in motion and laws he said motion any scientist today who rejects God but then Embraces the theory and the work and all the efforts made by scientists before them in some ways they are being intellectually dishonest because they wouldn't have what they're working with had there not been people who assumed certain absolute truths in the beginning and the more that they become untethered from absolutes their their domain and their dogma's data and they make comparisons and they extrapolate things and they try to predict things and listen let's just do it today we could ask you to do it now based upon what temperature was it today at nine o'clock in the morning I don't know maybe it's in the 90s what is it now so if we extrapolate from that in about eight more hours it's gonna be 280 degrees no joke just look at the data look at the numbers look how it's trending so there's a way that Science Now their dog must become the data and they're Tethered to it it's always changing it you can manipulate data to present any any kind of wild idea you want just change one parameter like aha the study works Perfect all we did is just remove this and add this parameter and they get the p-value they want P for pretense P for false p-h-a-l-s-e prophecy right that's how they come up with it but when you have an absolute and you begin with in the beginning God created the heavens of the earth and you have absolutes then from there you could begin to work with the other things that God helps you to know and to understand I think maybe I'm kind of getting lost in that but I think it's important to point out that the knowledge is that which is pursuing away from God the program's talking about and so Satan's Eden they're in this Eden from the beginning thou has been in the garden of God Eden he has been manipulating influencing redesigning since the beginning and he occupies this place as Ephesians 2 2 says we're in time past ye walked according to the course of this world before you were born again you walked under the influence of the world you were born into the world with the nature of the world sown in you the nature of your parents the nurture of the world the nurture all that all you could be was worldly according to the prince of the power of the air this is where Satan go to Ephesians 6 you see that their spiritual wickedness this is where he's operating he's the prince of the power of the air and it's that spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience brother Bram takes it and says that's children of rebellion and he identifies the first one is Cain the child of rebellion against the word he became the fruit of Eve's Rebellion against the word so he is a child of Disobedience he is a child of deforming power not disobedient children but children of Disobedience but we by the new birth become children of obedience and now having been born again we can only be disobedient children which sometimes we are but you're no longer children of Disobedience you know no longer children of rebellion but you've obeyed from the heart that Doctrine all right need to hurry Satan's eating he says again now he abide this fall he by this fall it has taken over he has taken over and possessed the Garden of Eden himself he took it over now just as remember how the God took six six days produces it now he has had six thousand years of deceitful rule deceiving the people God's children as he did then because they were based on free moral agency to act anyway they wish to and believing that they would act right or trust him they would act right then they've come with the wrong act and sold their birthrights as Esau did for the world and Satan won it and he took it over and he said six thousand years to build up his Eden as God had six thousand years to bring his Eden to a close Genesis 1 2 now Genesis 3 to where we are today and by deceit deceit of the word and if I maybe just want to get in just say this as we could see what God did and comes to Genesis 3 Genesis 3 1. in Satan now the mystery of iniquity cast down to earth now it begins to work in this realm of in this realm of the world and Heaven and Earth he becomes the Prince of the power of the air the God of this world and as he's working brother I'm saying now here we are now we're right to where Satan's going to take his throne and we could we can Orient ourselves scripturally right in the Book of Revelations where all this is right to the moment to where Satan's being exposed his plan is being exposed it's got to be coming to its climax because now since his product is the false church we can identify certain things in the scripture that we've arrived to right it's remarkable how beautiful this fits he says and he has said six thousand years to build his Eden as God had six thousand years to bring his Eden to a close and by deceit deceit of the word or the people now established his own Eden in this earth in sin God's Eden was established in righteousness Satan's Eden is established in sin because Satan is sin God is righteousness and God's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace in life and Satan's establishment is in sin and religious sin notice he deceived his deception as he said it would he promised to do this who promised to do it Satan did Satan said I will do this I will achieve this I will achieve a congregation I will achieve a church I will achieve an Eden I will achieve my own bride and brother bam says and he's done it he's absolutely done it and so two Edens I want to continue on this subject so right now I'm just searching in my heart where I want to stop with my notes today and so I want I want to be able to set I want to set it in a good good momentum I I want it to be positive it's so positive I think people are giggling about it two Edens God's eaten in the beginning is that first one that's God's Eden all his seed is son it's an Eden of righteousness now what is what is sin righteousness perverted an Eden of life now Eden of death which is life perverted all that all these ways you begin to see Satan is impersonating Satan is mimicking Satan is bringing his kingdom so you have God's Eden in the beginning and if I could say this because that's after six thousand years now Satan's Eden at the end a lot of comparisons maybe we can make in the beginning it's then that maybe we find that it hasn't quite come to the Harvest to where the Discerning Eye can see but notice how brother Branham comes and his ministry comes at the end to be able to bind all the tears to look back in the Harvest time he preaches Harvest Time this is the time when we begin to delineate and separate Chuck pulls away Terrors are identified they're all bundled to be burned why because now where we are now is God's kingdom beginning and given enough time now it's the time of the Harvest and we can see Satan's kingdom in the end now it doesn't mean that Satan's kingdom all of a sudden is revealed literally to everyone's eyes as being that hybrid goat crocodile horns and fire breathing and those things no it presents itself as the True Vine is still Satan's eating in the end is an opposite it's a contradiction So In This Very time that we're living in now Satan is perfecting his Eden he's he's accomplishing his own image what's the temperature right now I'm just trying to take the temperature anybody know is it comfortable or is any anybody comfortable right now okay good oh god there I gotta I got a thumbs up but Luke you're the man right now I'm gonna do these last 10 minutes to you but in Revelations chapter three I can do this very quickly and I'll expound upon it more later I just feel like I can't leave right there Revelations chapter 3 verses 16 uh actually I'm gonna start with verse 14. there's an unto the angel the Church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness now remember this phrase the beginning of the creation of God is important because now he brings us back to God's purpose in the beginning and to Christ who was the beginning of the creation of God so now in this time when this creation is going to come to its fullness I know that works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot it doesn't begin with the compliment only age where he doesn't do it so then because Thou Art lukewarm and either cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth what is this it's the hybrid it's the pale it's the mixture nothing's distinct it's muddied over it says because thou sayest I am rich and increase increased with goods and have need of nothing this is Satan's Eden you know us not that thou wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Raymond that thou mayest be closed speaking to the fact that they say they're rich but they're not they're not increased with Goods they do have they do have needs they they don't know that they're wretched miserable poor blind and naked so he's he's counting them according to their true need and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint that eyes with isab that thou mayest see do you notice the language that's being used in Revelations chapter three and how perfectly it parallels Genesis 3. because now in the end he's counseling them that they may by white raiment that the shame of their nakedness do not appear and their eyes be anointed that they may see and it's exactly lines up with the serpent sermon in the beginning God doth know that your eyes will be opened and you'll see and in the if you even look in Genesis chapter 2 again man and the woman were naked and unashamed but now he says that the shame of nakedness do not appear in other words now in Revelations 3 in the climax and Pinnacle of Satan's Eden the devil's bride is naked and ashamed in the climax of his Eden just as in the end of God's Eden there was nakedness without shame Satan now can only type the type and so what has he produced an Eden of nakedness and Eden of Shame why because he's he's stripping away he's trying to mimic he's trying to impersonate brother bam says in God's Eden they were naked and didn't know it and now when Satan's even be it by science and education they're naked again and don't know it what a perversion notice we're living in the climax of Satan's Eden so in this climax of Satan's Eden he's achieved a nakedness but he can't produce it without shame he can only produce it in a perverted way I I'd had it in the notes I'm glad I took it out but brother man says Eve was the most beautiful woman that ever struck the Earth Satan wanted to reproduce that but as soon as he hybrid it he can never get back to that he can never produce that kind of beauty he could never come back but he's trying as hard as he can we are living in the climax of Satan's Eden and God's Eden naked and unashamed but brother bam says notice how by science and education in his Eden it comes right back to nakedness remember in God's Eden God looked at his Eden and said it's good it's good it's good it's good it's very good but now and it's his Eden pleasure Delight the King's Garden but brother Branham says in laodicean church age and we read this together I'm sure you've noticed that the spirit had not said one kind thing about this age in other words God looks at his Eden says it's good Satan's eating it's not good there's not a good thing that can be said about it God's Eden was a place of light and happiness it's a pleasure ground but Satan's Eden reading Revelations 3 a place of Darkness misery wretched blind naked and here Satan say well their eyes aren't opened in Genesis 2 and they're naked and so he's I I've achieved my own bride who's blind and naked it's like ah no it ain't the same thing buddy you've produced a false Vine you're producing a False Image you typed the type that's just the type I've held the truth these things are just representing things this is the Garden of Eden that I produced and you begin with the city and you're ending in darkness and Chaos I'm beginning with a garden and I'm gonna end with the New Jerusalem and God is looking at this whole plan and this is brother says it's a perversion now they're wretched miserable blind and naked this is Satan's Eden but if I could end on this Brothers if you could come to your instruments now Revelations chapter 3 verse 20. in verse 21 behold I stand the door knock I'm knocking on a door in the middle of this wretchedness this nakedness this blindness that the very moment when Satan's about ready to assume his throne he goes I'd stand at the door knock If any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me Oh What a Beautiful invitation just as there was an invitation to eat in Genesis 3. now there's an invitation to a feast in Revelations 3. and then this phrase to him that overcometh it's the one age where God had no good thing to say it's an age where there's a blending over from the prior Open Door age but then brother Bram talks about the open door to Satan that Satan has but he says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame prevailed and it sat down with my father in his throne in the middle of Satan's Eden an invitation to the kingdom right in the middle of it Satan came to the woman and knocked and opened a door to worldly kingdoms he gained access to worldly kingdoms he gained access to build his own kingdom on Earth so now God Waits after six thousand years after Satan has achieved his bride his church his Babylon there's another voice another voice calling you out of Babylon just as God did Abram out of chaldea just as he called him away from the Babylonian worship and the Babylonian temples and he called them away to a land that he would give him now God at the end of this age is knocking saying open up let's have let's have this feast in the end time let us enjoy these things that are open and it's an invitation in the middle of Satan's Eden it's an invitation back to the kingdom this is the promise as it says will sit with me in the throne it's a promise that points to a kingdom restored a kingdom revived it represents the throne represents kingly power uh the the royalty of the Kingdom he's wanting that to be in our eyes as Peter writes for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly not just ministered but abundantly fullness into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I thank God that in the midst of Satan's Eden the kingdom has been brought to us the Christ is knocking on the doors of our hearts and he said behold let's feast just as the woman partook of false knowledge in the beginning and by unbelief and doubt and deforming power she fell now I've come to my bride in the end and I am speaking to her come away my love open up the door let me Feast with you and once again by eating but this time in its Truth by eating you will be translated above worldly kingdoms and be ministered unto you abundantly in the Everlasting Kingdom it's triumphant Victorious overcoming oh Hallelujah [Music] I in my heart I went another uh maybe 10-15 minutes Beyond where I was wanting to stop but I just every in every single one of these Services I'm trying to purpose in my heart to never end on the worldly kingdoms to not end on Satan's Aiden but always punch it back at the end that we will there's going to be this kingdom is rising the the king is here think about the language that is being represented in the open of the word there's been this uh saying a tectonic shift the Paradigm Shift no matter how you say it it just can't describe it enough of what has opened up to us in this hour and how we have the privilege of looking back and seeing six thousand years of treachery and deceit and ruin in chaos and impersonations and religion and we have the privilege of sitting here and having our eyes open to be able to see that trail of the serpent to see how he works in religious ways and we can stand firm in the middle of the road on God's word and listen don't get caught up in debasing in running down what Satan's kingdom is serving as meat you just see it on the word that God has brought us I think we spend way too much time critiquing what other people are eating and it might just be because the spirit that's sown into so many fad diets and nutritional ideas is a lot of it's based upon what everyone else is doing and look at what they're eating and look how they look listen I believe that we can eat clean in this hour the word has been restored to us we're feeding on unfailing body word of the son of man I don't want to just deride and criticize and lambast what the world's eating they're eating on things that they only know of but oh God let me be one that shows that there is a full feast made available and may I be the very hand of God that knocks on the door of a heart of a Believer who's hungry and thirsting for this that should be your desire for your homes that's my vision for this church is that it would be a place where we could come and feast in this hour praise the Lord hallelujah could you stand with me
