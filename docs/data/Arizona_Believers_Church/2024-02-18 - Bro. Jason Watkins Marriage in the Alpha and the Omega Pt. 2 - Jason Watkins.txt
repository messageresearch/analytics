TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Revelation CH 1 verse 1 we'll read 1-8 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John now a couple of things I'll just say leading into this very first uh let me just say this very first dip uh out out of the word that we're going to take today I've already explained to you from Psalms 102 so you're already with me you're already on board that we're building the living Tabernacle of the living God's presence well that ought to include marriage as we were saying last night that you know that Paul when he speaks to the church and you know husbands love your wives and didn't just say to do it but actually explained how to go about it that as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it and there's lots of men who have obeyed the first first part of that because that was the free part the easy part you loved her but have you loved her in expression like Christ loved how he went about doing it say love is a doing of course it's a doing love is an expression love brother Brandon talks about that great Fountain from the eternities that great Fountain of Love did it stay that Fountain back in the eternities no it's it expressed and that's why brother Brandon would say that you know in in the how that God has only had one goal in the uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed God has only ever had one goal see and so we know that he brings it in in you know three three phases of God above god with and then God in but but you realize that he has ever only had one goal and that goal been expression to express himself so he was never content to just be alone uh with his deity he wanted to express and this is why really the world misunderstands the godhead so deeply because they they don't understand expression and so they look at the godhead like a linear mathematical equation and they either come up with one or two or three and all three of those Concepts fall short or go too far the trinitarians in their formula Chop God into three individual ual persons you say well that we know that's wrong but then brother brandham talks about the Oneness and in the Oneness formula they see Jesus only so what are they missing they're missing the expression of God in his bride they're missing the church see so this is why brother Brandon would say that that every son and daughter of God he would teach us this very clearly and this is right on tape teaching that that every son and daughter of God born again by the the spirit of God you are actually a part of God's godhead that's a direct quote part of God's godhead look it up and so you realize that the whole thing uh begins to be understood by expression well then that then once you know that then you have to take ownership of the fact that wow I need to do some surrendering so he can do some expressing because for sure there's nothing good about me that's going to be that's going to give glory to him there's none of us good no not one sometimes I've seen young sisters who you know fall for some worldly boy and he's got beautiful eyes and he's got a beautiful smile and and uh and then she tries to he's not a Believer so she wants to qualify to me why she's kind of interested in him brother Jason he's a good person I said no he's not there's none good there's none good get that through your mind sisters brothers there's none good no not one we're all open slicers it's God rich in Mercy he's the only one good Jesus said why callest thou me good there's only one good that is God see and so so we realize that Peter said that apart from the Holy Ghost we're just animals we're just brute beasts see there can be filio love in that human relation which is just really uh extreme human friendship which will fail you when times get rough I don't know why I'm saying this today this okay it'll fail you sisters brothers you're looking for a spouse trust me Good Times uh you will get good uh good response but let times get rough only love will sustain see and so we realize that that and I and I'm quick to point out to young men and young women they might say they love you and they might even actually mean it and they're not telling a lie that for all they know they mean they love you but just understand that the mechanism of Love of real love which is agape love which is God's love that's the only form of true love the Bible doesn't say God has love the Bible says God in fact is love so and the Bible says that the love of God that love is poured into us by the Holy Ghost so how do they have the real love if they don't have the Holy Ghost see how do you you might have a car sitting out there but if you don't have an engine in it what what good is it going to do you you push it that ain't going to get you very far it'll cost you a lot of Of Heartache but put an engine in it and have everything running right and it'll and it'll service you see so so again uh I I guess maybe the Lord is if we're going to talk about marriage we better start with those who aren't yet married so that when we talk about why things get so wrong in marriage you won't make the mistake and you can turn around and look at the adults and go y'all getting [Laughter] this so so I'm just I'm just I'm just trying to follow the leadership of the holy spirit so when we come to the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave to him and brother brandham you know and I'm not going to go down that trail today cuz it's really a a rabbit trail that would engulf all my time but you know it's hard to it's hard to comprehend and it's difficult to get your mind around the fact that Jesus in his Earthly pilgrimage when he's walking the shores of Galilee he didn't know everything and he said I have to whatever I see the father do and brother brandham says that plainly on table you know there were things he he talks about you know when the woman touched his him of His Garment he didn't know who it was when a certain thing happened said Jesus and this is right on tape he said Jesus didn't know what to do and he had to wait see and so when he's in the room to raise the dead child there's so much unbelief and brother brandom this is his language he was in trouble imagine he was in trouble because there's so much unbelief and he said he had to literally speak in Tong and call into the spirit world tithum which is being interpreted damsel arise and he called her spirit back in fact is in jah's home he had to put everybody out they were laughing him to scorn brother Brandon would say it sometimes in a pray and he'd say now let me just turn my back he said I got to I got to block all of that see so so there's things in the Ethereal that we don't fully understand we're not trying to preach on it today but they're real and there's the presence of the Lord here today and there's angels and they're real brother brandham said in one you know sometimes Services can become so anointed the word can be some come so great he said you bump into something and turn around and there's nothing there he said you bumped into an angel so this is no joke this is for Real the presence of God is here and the devil is also trying to V for your attention see so we're we're you know life is sometimes not as it seems that's almost an statement so it's it's you know there there's things where he comes and then they ask him brother brandham uses that scripture in Acts they ask Jesus will you now re restore the kingdom to Israel and he says you know that's not for you to know even the son doesn't know that's his words even the son doesn't know the father knows but and and so it's it's it's so now but when he comes back in the Book of Revelation after he's ascended on high sent back his life into the church now now he's got the next phase of expression cuz he was God was never intending to stay bottled up in one lowly Nazarene walking the shores of Galilee his whole idea was a kingdom right A kingdom of saints that's why brother Brandon would say he's the beginning of the creation of God he's a brand new type of human he's a prototype for the whole Kingdom and you're the continuation of that same creation so so then if Jesus being perfect had to surrender to the father wouldn't you if Jesus already not being born in sin but had to learn obedience by the things he suffered how about you and I right I want to tell you something friends you're guaranteed to in the message of the hour you're guaranteed to not hear these things in the average pull pit oh we are privileged to know what God has brought to us in this hour so so we find this that that he comes back now he's got this great Revelation that he's going to give to John because again he's not going to keep it to himself it was never the plan he's going to give it to John to give to the churches and those Messengers those living creatures are going to be working those those those seven spirits of God not seven gods seven spirits of the same God that's going to work in his Messengers stars in his hand who are going to catch a revelation and run with it in every age so you know that's what you're reading you're reading Jesus in in Revelation 1 he's starting to explain how he's going to pull off Psalms 102 he's eventually going to get there this is how it's happening and you're it am you're involved and so he's sending you a revelation it's only a revelation that can keep you from paying too much attention to the world getting you know mesmerized like John did when he saw the the great Harlot and and John says I marveled with great admiration and the angel had to almost rebuke him and you know slap him to his senses but how did he do it he said I will tell you her secret and the revelation of the Antichrist brought John to his senses and he knew this is not to be worshiped and followed this is why brother brandham said when those two or three little girls at the end of the preview of the Bride they started getting out of Step he said it's CA they were looking at that other church and they got out of Step see so the beauty is that the prophet was he said I when I come to the come to myself I standing in the middle of the room saying stay in line get back in line and the beauty of it is is that if you're at a line today you're only half a step to get back don't let the devil discourage you now military people know that when you're marching left left left right left and you get out of Step all you need is just a half step and that'll put you right back in line you know I wasn't in the military I've seen it I've seen it described and they're left left left right left and if they get out of line all they have to do is left left just just take that half step and you'll be back in line it's not too late you're just a half a step out today make that half AEP step get back in line see so so we find then that he you know he he's he's talking about how that Christ now this burgeoning Revelation and that's why I was saying it's it's it's it's hard to comprehend it's difficult to get your mind around the fact that you right now if we're going to compare your life right now to the life of the Nazarene right then right back there before he died before he went up before he sent his life back before before he comes to John when he's walking the shores of gallilee comparing that time in his life to this time in your life it's hard to absorb that you know more than he did you know secrets of the Rapture that he didn't yet know you already know it amen you understand you're blinking you're you're don't just calm down calm down breathe but but this these are these are the things brother Brandon was bringing out to us doesn't make us greater than Jesus it just puts us in step with his Revelation cuz he was always going to come to that and you couldn't come to it until he come to it and gave it to the church so you got it from [Music] him verse two who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of the things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the times is at hand he goes on down you know John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits of God which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ catch it now verse five who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and watch us from our sins in his own blood I don't see how a trinitarian reads these first five verses and makes Jesus a second person I don't know how you can read these descriptions and come away that he's a second person or that you're missing out that he has an expression in a family see and hath made us verse 6 and hath made us priest and uh Kings and priest and un to God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they that which pierced him and all the kindreds of the Earth shall wh because of him even so a man so so you're in verse six you're reading the game plan for 2,000 years of church history and by the time you get to verse 7 you're at the end of the tribulation and the brid's already been long gone and the whole earth sees him and they're not happy to see him can you imagine claiming you're a Christian and you wouldn't be happy to see the Lord right it takes my breath away how do you what how does that even I mean it suddenly they see him and they don't Rejoice seeing him they whail because of him because that's when that's when they know for certain they've missed I and he says in verse eight I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayeth the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty how do you read those first eight verses and Come Away With A trinitarian or a Oneness thinking see so so when we when we look at it in that way you're you you you find out that that in that in this verse six you know Christ is is actually beginning to to show the church who she is she he's now living in her in verse six and hath made us Kings and Priests under God and so when we when we look at it that way you know I verse six is literally announcing that the cycle of the bride's Ministry has begun now it hadn't it didn't begin when John came back it it began in the upper room what when he comes back he's it's basically clarifying because brother brandham said that was the pattern for the whole church in that Upper Room experience the ministry of the son of man didn't end with Jesus it multiplied in the upper room and that was a Ministry of the son of man now don't confuse the ministry with the office the office of son of man is a prophet which they had Paul was on the scene but the ministry of the son of man kept going even after brother Brandon went home even after Paul went home the ministry of the son of man means the word now made flesh see so verse six now verse five the first five verses are going to very clearly depict who Christ is there can be no ambiguity no mistaking this is who he is this is who's talking John is using all you know the the Lord is saying now John I want you to write it like this when they read it there's going to be no doubt who it is talking to you when they read this they'll know it's me now after five verses and they get to verse six this is going to be uh an aha moment for the church to realize that the cycle of the bride's Ministry has now started because of a revelation of the word of God that's what happened in the upper room amen a revelation of the word of God when they you know they they T brother Bram said you know before it come and they had discussion well you know I had a feeling could that be it no I don't know we better wait well what about this well no we better wait and on after 10 days and here it come and then when they get outside and somebody misinterprets it by the word Peter quickly corrects it no no no this is not what you think it is this is not drunkenness this is not well you know all of those bad characteristics this is that which Joel prophesied so now that revelation of the word strikes thousands of them and they become baptized and filled with the holy spirit so the new birth it always comes by the revelation of the word not because you shook or shouted or jumped or ran or somebody even laid hands on you it might happen it might not it might this might happen you might not but one thing sure is it'll be a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and your life will then will then if you go into acts after acts 238 you you say how do we know they were born again of the spirit of God read verse 42 from there they continued in the apostles Doctrine the breaking of the bread prayers amen so the new birth begins to mold you into the image of the word so it's all about now announcing the cycle of the bride's Ministry has begun it's that's going to go all the way through Seven Ages it's going to bring back the last Eve who will not fail amen that's now that's the set time that we're in an eve who is predestinated not to fall then of course it'll be it as it's manifested in this last St then the kingdom of the Eternal Lord and his Christ that's Jesus and his bride the kingdom of the Lord and his Christ which is the restored Adam and Eve shall be established in the Earth forever and shall never be overthrown ever so we're glad for this yes so so now so brother brandham would say it like this in the church age book and uh the in the revelation of Jesus Christ he hath made us see as we read in in our in our and hath made us Kings and Priests brother Brandon picks that up he hath made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this one of them he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the lord it's all Grace he redeemed us for a purpose now that's where you really got to start to absorb he did this for a purpose it's not okay you're at an altar okay you're saved see you in heaven right see we are it is true we're going home on The Old Ship of Zion but he never told you to take your luggage go down to the docks and sit on your luggage he did it for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings oh we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne that's in the Millennium that's where we read in Psalms 102 says but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom says in Romans 5:17 for If by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ Colossians 1:13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom the reign of his dear son see it's the ministry of the son of man that's rulership that's reigning that's where the real Authority is where real power is and if you feel a little bit you know behind in how to make that work you're in good company brother branam struggled to understand it in fact is when he came to the scripture if you say to this mountain brother brandham admitted after the fact after he finally understood it he admitted openly in pull pits around the world he said I never would preach on that cuz I didn't understand it he said I the reason I couldn't understand is because I had always taught everything is in the atonement he says but he is saying that before the calvaries even and he says because because the problem is he's not saying Jesus isn't saying if I say he's saying if you say and brother Brenham is scratching his head and he said well I just made up my mind that if anybody asks me about that scripture I would just say well he said that before the atonement pretty good Baptist answer that's pretty good Baptist answer but but the Lord wasn't going to let him get by with that and he takes him into the woods you remember the squirrels and that happened in Kentucky and then I mean Indiana and a couple weeks later or maybe vice versa he's hunting you know the Reds and then the Grays and the Lord is just almost driving him insane and he he's making him let's let's talk about this and brother bam said you know I thought about that scripture if you say and and and there there Comes The Voice you know what are you doing I'm hunting hunting squirrel how many you need three say where they'll be and brother brandham he just almost if you go back back and listen to to brother bram's uh tale of that especially in one sermon escapes my mind right now if you can I can look it up for you if you want to know but but brother brandham just almost went crazy in those woods trying to get his mind wrapped around it and every time he thought he had it figured out he was wrong and the pressure and the anxiety before anxiety was a thing he was he was falling to pieces he's screaming out who are you what do you want that's what the way he describes it on tape he said usually I he's all Disturbed usually I see that light I don't see the light but I hear the voice who are you what do you want leave me alone but the Lord wouldn't leave him alone he was determined that he was going to get that and brother bradam said but I can't understand it because you're saying if I say and the Lord come down after weeks and weeks of nearly driving him to a breakdown the Lord just finally says you stand in these prayer lines and you know the very secrets of people's hearts you you think that's you that knows that and brother Braham thought wait a minute and he said you're able to tell the future and prophesy and things come to pass you think that's you doing that and brother brandham caught it and he said no Lord It's not me doing it it's you doing it through me and he said I realized at that moment that any son or daughter of God now here's the key here's the big old if it's only two letters but it's huge it any son and daughter of God if they're willing that they're that they're willing to live up in those atmospheres then they are the ones who will say to this mountain because it won't be you saying it it'll be him saying it and you're out of the way and he can finally get on with expression oh Lord give me fresh surrender today let my home let my life let my marriage let my family when the when we say we're going to apply the token that ought to mean something amen it's not a cliche when you apply something you bring it into contact and so if you want to apply the token to your children bring them into contact with the token amen see so so we find that that he he's saying we're Kings and Priests now right now we reign with Christ have dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil amen you know so we can show off no so we can look big no so so we can be the you know the best no showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself not showing me showing him for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure so we're in the age where the alpha has come the Omega has come back to the alpha this is the the ministry of the son of man that was that that Ministry was lost and it goes into the ministry of the Son of God because Jesus instead of being able to come back and get a bride and brother brandham said when he comes back he finds her a fallen woman just like Eve just like Jehovah found Israel Fallen they said we want a king and the prophet said but God is your king yeah we understand that just become a cliche to them he's our King but we want an actual King as if God wasn't an actual King and so so we find that that when he comes he instead of being able to take a bride in a Rapture Christ must sit down you know he must seal up the word in Seven Seals sit down in the eternities and start interceding for the ignorance of the people and this is why Luther could come along with partially false Doctrine Wesley could come along preaching trinitarianism which is a doctrine of demons those three unclean spirits like frogs and and we find that yet he was the messenger and the people who follow is messenger and part of the first resurrection because Christ is interceding for the ignorance just like Paul told the Jews there in the book of Acts I think chapter 13 or 16 I don't remember he said you know there was a time back there when you brought these animal sacrifices and God winked at your ignorance but now he requireth all men to repent the word is the fullness of the word is coming you got to come to the fullness of the word 1600 years of animal sacrifice we're done with that the ministry of the son of man is is to grow through a family so we find that we're in that age now where Christ in the alpha is the same in the Omega and and brother Brandon brother Aaron and I were talking about this in the back room where and if you want to find the references to this this is where brother Brandon when he was teaching on his Revelation series Revelation three Revelation four Revelation 5 and brother Bram is using an example in there of Christ standing in front of standing in front of a manora you know the seven golden lampstands that you see and he said and he's got his hands stretched out and this hand is hitting the first one and this hand is hitting the last one so he's in his fullness in the first and he's in his fullness again in the last he's the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the ending the alpha the Omega brother bam says but he doesn't say anything about the middle now it's not that Christ wasn't in the midst of the seven lamps stands John saw him walking there and he saw him G about the pths with a golden G brother Ram said it's a woman it's the church covered and dressed in the Robes of of of righteousness of Christ and Jesus promised to never leave the church so certainly Jesus was in the middle it's just that not everything in the middle was now purely him brother brandham called it there had been an admixture of true and false it wasn't pure anymore yet yes he was there but now there's an ad mixture now there's two churches started out with one in the beginning in the alpha church every church was a message Church there was no such thing as a Christian Church that wasn't a message church and now we're the most minority in the world because of that ad mixture and because now he speaks to the churches and brother Brandon would say it's curious that he would say church is he says because we find that there's now a false Church impersonating the true church and even the true church he said is now losing losing those original feelings that she had even the True Churches starting he talks about that in the bitterness of of Smyrna and how that that bitterness was was was increasing so so you know when you begin at Ephesus now all right now I I I want to turn a corner and let's bring it home to our idea of marriage Wonder we good yes you're good I haven't lost anybody in the shuffle no all right praise the Lord if you got a question don't ask it till after I'm done so so when you begin at Ephesus as Ephesus did the Ephesus meant you know aimed at and relaxed now watch watch the the the the the process of this I would call it a dichotomy where you have the first age that starts out under the lion so pure but they begin to relax they begin to lose their fervency it they begin to decline and then by the time you get to the next age bitterness has set in and by the time you get to pergam that means marriage now they're now you've got an adulterous remarriage to a false husband so you see you see how that's working it's and and a lot of times that's how marriages will happen uh too often times you can begin as Ephesus did and the problem with Ephesus is that they started taking people into the church who weren't born again of the spirit of God as we said last night they just admired the fine qualities of Jesus and started calling themselves Christians he said they did that cuz that's what they were but it was just a mental thing it wasn't a real conversion and the and and that's how the church began to be diluted and and and and and then that that's how you end up it went off into apostasy and finally it's going to Crown a false prophet and the you know the seat where Satan's seat is and Jezebel religion and uh triple crown and oh my you know and and so but we're finding a pattern here that that when you go into a marriage first of all that's why brother Brandon would say pray yes be led of the spirit because that's the pattern at Ephesus to be a Christian you needed to be baptized you needed to repent be baptized and the promise was to you see and so you had the church birthed but even then you had people already hiding under the radar ananas and saf and different ones and people who walked for a while and Paul said later I tell you even weeping they have become enemies of the Cross you have people who started out so got so arrogant in their so-called Christianity that they were even criticizing Paul and resisting his teaching even John starts telling a story said there's this there's this man this pastor up here and he he doesn't receive my Ministry and he won't even allow his people to visit and he he tells everybody to stay away from me John says I'm going to go up there I'm going to deal with that guy so you already had the spirit of antichrist working in the churches and it was starting to decline even while the apostles were still alive you know they they're they're they're they're writing letters you know and sending it out we need to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered we're slipping we're seeing too much carnality what's going on everybody see so you had the gnostics moving in destroying the deity of Christ and it wasn't wasn't a real human and the reason they didn't want to believe he was a real human because if he was a real human and overcame by the word then that become incumbent upon them to do the same and they didn't want to do that and people don't want to do that so they make the new birth some kind of you know mental thing just a mental ascent and it's not to be that it's to be a living fiery experience amen and this is what marriages are to to be established on because Paul when he's saying you know husbands love your wives as exactly like Christ did well how'd you do it Paul well he gave himself for it you know and and and I remember I remember so clearly probably four or five years deep into my 42-year marriage sister Debbie and of course I loved her my and my love was genuine I loved her dearly and as we were saying last night I love her even more today so it proved it was real because it's grown but I remember four or five years into our marriage and I'm sitting there on a Sunday morning I'm got my my Bible open I'm dressed she's getting the boys dressed and getting as a mother would do uh except for my youngest son Chris you didn't dress him he dressed himself picked out his own clothes did his own thing and it was always perfect we never had a problem and um but that was Chris he has a little turbo you wake him up he's comes fully awake and he's ready to go that's Chris if you ever be around him he's my drummer if you ever see him on video he's he's great guy but uh she's back there busy getting the other two ready who really needed help oh boy they needed help and so I'm sitting there reading my Bible and I'm reading that passage husbands love your wives a and I thought yes amen praise the Lord love my wife as Christ loved whoa huh I didn't know that was there as Christ oh you're you're not just telling me to do it you're telling me how to go about it as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it and I I remember I just I sitting in my chair waiting we were going to go to church Sunday morning and I just had my Bible and I just laid my head back and I said Lord it started with a confession it started with repentance which is worthless if you don't make a change and I said Lord I've loved her she's my soulmate but I have never loved her like this there's still too much self-centeredness here and I made up my mind right then and my wife will testify it to this day it didn't happen overnight no lightning flashed I didn't suddenly go into a telephone booth and come out wearing a cape but I began the transition toward Zion I began to turn my eyes toward Heaven I begin to think about Christ and how he lived and and it and and and it and it wasn't perfect and it hasn't been Flawless but it's been steady and it's been sincere and I have said Lord I want to love her like you've loved me and there's one thing for sure you have expressed your love to me and I have no doubt you love me if you hadn't have I'd have been kicked to the curb a long time ago but God has loved me can you testify to that friends unworthy as we are the Lord has loved us anyway and and so so when when you when you realize then that that this was the process and that's why it says pray get a revelation from God because that's how the church started you see that parallel I'm sure you get that it was a parallel but what happened was is you started having people coming into the church who didn't do that you have people getting married who don't pray and get LED of the Holy Spirit see and so so this is why today divorce courts are filled uh brother Wes was telling me last night as a court reporter that was one of the things that dealt with the most was divorce far more than murders or robbery or anything like that it was always divorce see because it's all just a mental as we were saying last night just a mental agreement and so then what does that lead to then then what happens when when you get in a marriage like that it starts to cool and then a lot of times one or the other and it's really bad if both of them go to the second stage because the relationship has cooled now bitterness sets in resentment starts to build it's a bitterness of resentment and the next thing you know God forbid it leads to infidelity and you say well but we're Christians we're born again I did pray I believe I've got my eternal mate listen listen listen I'm telling you I have seen by experience thank God I haven't seen it often but in 35 years preaching this gospel on six of seven continents I've had my share of seeing couples who were I knew I knew they were Believers they're Believers to this day I knew that they they really did love one another and I knew that this was really I knew this was their Eternal mate but I watched the relationship cool and I watched bitterness grow and I watched unfaithfulness come from that Born Again people say could that happen say well uh you know and I know it's often said well brother M said my Holy Ghost would keep me from that so anybody that would do that could not possibly be born again well I you know I'm glad you've got such judgment Powers I don't I don't dare to to do that I let God decide that but I know this you say well he said the Holy Ghost would never my Holy Ghost would keep me from that well yeah no kidding of course he would the Holy Ghost is never going to go along with that he's never never going to agree to you living like that but neither is he going to force you see so of course he's not going to allow it but he's also not building robots and and there's there's penalty and you reap what you sow so so good so good seed and if you've swed Bad Seed do like do like Esther when there was no hope and the word couldn't be changed and Bad Seed the king had said it and they're all going to be killed and she goes to him you know change your word he says I'm a hazus I change not I can't change my word just like God she's the bride this is Christ he can't change his mind about his word he's already said whatsoever you sow that's what you're going to reap so well then what do I do it's all hopeless no it's not I'll make another law that on the day before that law comes into effect you can kill all of them who were going to kill you so so the the the good the new seed destroyed the effect of the of The Bad Seed when it was sown you say I've sown a lot of Bad Seed start sewing good seat over the top of it that works in both directions Jesus said by your Traditions you've caused the word of God to have no effect turn that on the devil turn that on the devil say y boy you got me to sow plenty of bad but today I'm sewing good and by the time that bad comes up I'll have so much good it'll destroy any effect you could have on my life amen amen see so so what happens then is is you know as they came to Christ mentally you know based on the bodily sensations of the human spirit in your flesh and you have an experience of something other than the heart connection to Christ and this opens you up to making the wrong choices for a mate which later ends in disappointment as I said can become bitterness can become infidelity now I realize today and I believe it with all my heart that I'm speaking largely to those who have the correct God L mate but the effects of disappointment can still work the same the effects of cooling in the relationship can work the same way and cause the same bitterness even if it's your Divine mate I've seen it happen sometimes you know there's all kinds of reasons why that can happen sometimes it's because maybe you know some some some active uh abuse perhaps I don't know maybe poor raising and misguided training in your childhood there's all kinds of reasons why people are closed up and can't let their expressions and let their love uh flow one to another it's a sad case maybe it was some misinterpreted theology from a previous Ministry you said under perhaps some maybe some trauma uh from a previous situation and then and then conversely you know maybe maybe not a an active abuse but maybe a passive lack a passive lack of intimacy and emotional neglect and this can also be from a collection of those exact same things leaving you with emotional wounds that that leave you afraid of deep feelings afraid of deep emotional relationships amen now y'all were shouting when we were in The Book of Revelation and all of that so don't go cold on me now see I did all that to set you up did all that to prove to you that you're supposed to be the image of the Son of God in the earth you're you're the continuation of his ministry and you said Amen to that don't take that amen back I'm going to tell you something friends it takes great humility great sincerity before God to admit to ourselves that whatever it is whatever it is that keeps us from following God's word and God's design it's the same as any other weakness wherein we won't let as Paul said we won't let the mind of Christ the mind that was in Christ operate in us see because the mind of Christ would heal you of that injury that trauma the Holy Ghost would teach you to be like Jesus how to release your love how to release your affection Jesus didn't have a problem with that and nobody got more abused than him nobody was done more dirty than him if you feel like you've been overcome and things have been so bad and uh you know just Paul said Just remember he who suffered such a contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be faint lest you be wearied in your own mind and faint see you haven't suffered under blood you haven't went through what Christ did yet he continued to love continued to express it it wasn't just I love you no it was an expression of Love see so it doesn't matter you know what it is that's keeping you uh uh locked up and and afraid of deep feelings afraid of deep emotional relationships it's just the same as any flaw or error that's what he told to the Philippian church but it's also the same error within yourself that you won't as Paul said to the colossian church let the word dwell in you richly amen let it allow it permit it cuz God's not going to force you you understand it's he's a gentleman he doesn't do that you've got to let the mind which was in Christ be in you you've got to allow the word to dwell in you richly you know it's a terrible transgression of selfishness and self-centeredness that allows it to keep going and and molding our negative actions or the lack of our positive actions that build up don't don't don't despise it as small things you might say well I'm not doing all kinds of negative things well are you failing to do the positive things there there you're you're in construction you're to be building up the body of Christ Stone upon Stone amen amen word upon word line upon line see so so and and to me friends the thing that makes selfishness and self-centeredness and I want you to notice the the word the the the word that stands like a beacon at the beginning of those two words selfishness self centeredness the things that the thing that makes selfishness and self-centeredness so egregious to God is that he was so willing to pay such a ransom for you amen Jesus Paid listen young people GE don't be ashamed of the Gospel Jesus Paid a horrible price on your behalf he suffered such a contradiction of Sinners against himself the contradiction of trading the innocent for the guilty that's hard to handle Jesus who was innocent and God swapped him for all of us guilty Sinners amen amen and brother brandham said God condemned him as a sinner and sent him to hell and the whole reason he did that is so you would never have to go there don't ever lose sight of that you young men young women don't ever lose sight about the price he paid for your Redemption for your claim I remember one time I was in in um um I think I was in the Ukraine one one of those countries might have been Russia but I or bellarus I think we were in Ukraine and um we were at meetings there and brother Eugene and I and um I don't remember if brother Barry was there at that time his early days and uh brother Eugene and I and I think brother Lonnie we went up to into the town to because there was only one place in everywhere that had uh a working phone that you could call overseas and so um we went up there and I remember the young woman it was some I think it was like um an insurance office or maybe and she was you know she had her desk there as you to greet you as you come in she was the secretary and what more so she knew who we were we were preachers and the minister had went with us and explained you know in Russian that we were there to try to call home and uh a very attractive young woman and really bubbly and happy which was unusual to find in that area most of them had just come out of you know under from under the Iron Curtain they're very solemn and they didn't Express themselves that's one of the things we struggled with in in early days there in Russia and Ukraine is you rejoice in the word of God and they just set stoically no matter what you said you couldn't I mean you would move Heaven and Earth it wouldn't matter they just set because and I realized that for 40 years they had been trained to just sit stoic and not express yourself you don't act out in public you don't act you don't you don't shout at a ball game you don't shout in church you don't shout on the street you don't do anything and if you did and boy did they get a load of brother Eugene oh my goodness as soon as he got out of the van and he heard an echo we were all these buildings and he said praise the Lord and he heard an echo praise the Lord the Lord Lord Eugene said glory glory glory and they're like you like whoow I said hey Cowboy you better take a volume or something you're you're not going to you're going to be in trouble here and so um we walked in and so she was bubbly and turns out that she spoke just a little bit of English and she was kind of wanting to show off a little bit here's some Americans I want to show off my English and uh she's got this burbly bubbly you know almost an American personality already and uh she starts bragging about her night out on the town and how she was still a little tipsy because she had a little too much to drink and whoopee and she was having a good time and she saw that we weren't w't amused by that and she knew that we were ministers and uh and and I just you know I just I began to speak to her because I can hardly keep quiet in times like that and I said well you know Sister maybe you should uh consider you know what the consequences of that might be and my goodness you could tell somebody had said something like that to her before and she just immediately threw up her hand my body my body she didn't want to hear this my body and and I just looked her in the eye and I said who in the world told you that you built it you can keep it alive and if your breath left your body you wouldn't be dead who told you it was your body let me tell you about somebody who owns your body and that's the Son of God who died to redeem you and therefore he owns you you do not own yourself and you owe your life to him otherwise going to die am and and a lot of times this is the this is how self-centeredness works it's it's all about me and it's really supposed to be all about him and you know you say well I'm not doing anything wrong well are you actively doing things right you're supposed to be building supposed to be building up see you say well I I I I can't get over the wound Christ can get you over it the Lord can get you over it that's what he want he wants to do that that's what the word is for for he sent his word and healed the people see so how in the world then can we countenance selfishness and self-centeredness in our lives or in our marriages and claim to be Believers how do husbands not love their wives by demonstration of the Holy Spirit and claim to be a believer how do wives not reverence their husband and claim to be a believer very good see so it's like I said last night too many husbands have failed to leave father and mother and cleave only under their wife and too many wives have never accepted the word that their desire was to be to their husband and whatever his dreams and his goals she doesn't even keep her name she's to surrender to his leadership see and so so you know you can stack it any way you want friends but marriage as designed by God in the beginning it's just a microcosm of the relationship between Christ and his church I said it last night I've started to say it several times here today let me finally get it out when Paul is is talking about you know how that we are to conduct ourselves and uh you know how it's not just a thought that I'm going to have uh this is this is supposed to become a reality in our lives so so when we when we think about how that it's supposed it's just a mic rosm of the relationship between Christ and his church Paul Paul says gives you those instructions and he basically comes down from that made this point last night he comes down from there and he and I'm just going to add live a little bit and and paraphrase the scripture you know now what I was saying about husbands loving your wives and demonstration wives are reverencing your husband I really meant it now don't don't overs spiritualize what I'm about to say and not do that I want you to catch a but I'm really speaking of a great mystery that what you are is a model of what he and his church are but don't get so Heavenly minded that you forget your Earthly duties I really meant what I said husbands really do that wives really do that but understand and and understanding is half the battle because once you and then the other half is is always application once you understand the word of God then you become responsible to apply it and when you apply it it works it can restore broken marriages it can take away bitterness and resentment it can restore fervency and love between that couple see that's the that's that's the first thing you have to own if your marriage is in trouble is that weakness in your marriage signifies weakness in your relationship with the Holy Spirit spirit [Music] amen just going to let that one sink a minute weakness in your marriage signifies weakness in your relationship with the Holy Spirit that's right and that's the first thing you have to own if your marriage is in trouble or even if you sense hindrances to all that God has purposed in your relationship say my relationship is fine it's going along but can you really say when you get on your knees and you're talking to the Lord and nobody else is around can you really say Lord every purpose that you have designed for my home and my marriage and my life Lord I'm hitting on all cylinders if you can't say that then you need to start work say oh I need to go to I need to go to marriage counseling to get my marriage fixed you do need marriage counseling from here because what you need fixed is inside here and I'm not discrediting what outside sources can do to help but all that can do is help the mental and we're not we don't love Christ by mental we don't I don't love my wife by mental nobody forced me to love her I can't not love her I know it's a double negative but I can't not love her see it it's it's it's like the like the snowball that rolls starts rolling down the hill after a while you can't stop it anymore after a while it'll roll you right over you can't stop it or even stay ahead of it and this is this is how love is supposed to go forward and upward onward and upward it's supposed to end in Psalms 102 with Zion being the glory of God and all the world comes in to bring to recognize their Glory of of Christ recognize the glory of Christ in his family yes amen I want to say to you today forget forget blaming anybody very good amen forget it because you said say but you don't know my story okay even if it's true let me just go ahead and Patch you on the back and say your story is true yeah the abuse is real but even if it's true that is not going to fix anything has it's not a that it's true as a mood point he wants you to become whole he wants your marriage to look like his marriage hallelujah amen he wants this church to look like his church he started his church how he wanted it and now he wants it how he started it hallelujah amen what have you suffered really that Jesus didn't suffer times a thousand forget blaming your spouse forget it forget blaming your parents forget blaming the preacher amen forget blaming the devil forget blaming the devil amen why can't I blame the devil you were warn warned in God's word to cast down vain imagination you were warned in the word to flee youthful lust you were warned in Romans 13 and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness stop blaming everybody say it's not my brother or my sister it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light Ephesians 58-1 17 for we were sometimes Darkness amen come on all you holy people we were sometimes Darkness but I'm not that way anymore now are ye light in the Lord not you have light but now are you light in the Lord say thank God hold on don't get too excited because the next one's going to put you under responsibility but now are you li in the Lord walk as children of light that's that's active that's proactive walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth if I had a board up here and you could write every full definition of goodness and righteousness and truth and list every sinm known in the English language you would never find in your list bitterness yeah angry anger unforgiveness con you know contempt that's why the the Bible says whatsoever you do in word or deed do a in the name of Jesus and whatever you can't do or say in the name of Jesus don't do or say it I I told a I told a audience one time I said there's no way to say to your spouse you make me sick in the name of Jesus Christ I hate you I'm tired you in the name of Jesus Christ I heard a story one time I don't know if it was true or not I think they were telling it as a true story elderly man and woman been married many many years 60 plus years I think sitting on their rocking chairs on the front porch rocking and uh the the the lady you know in her age her hearing had gone bad and so she didn't hear so well I think it's down like 20% hearing and the husband is rocking beside her and he just starts gazing over at her and he just starts thinking about you know poor thing you know must be hard lose your hearing and my she's been such a faithful woman she raised my kids she cooked my meals and man he his heart just began to swell with love and affection he just felt such a compassion almost like back in it felt like he loved her like a teenager again my what a woman and he he turned to her and he said dear I'm so proud of you and she says what' you say and he said I I I said I'm proud of you what' you say I I I said I'm proud of you I'm tired of you [Laughter] too I have to break you up a little bit you're starting to go into vapor lock on me with all of this and so but we we were warned in the scripture we can't blame anyone you can't even blame the devil we were warned in the scripture that we were sometimes Darkness but now are you light in the Lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and Truth proving what is acceptable you see it's proving it it's bringing glory to God you're proving the word you can say anything but but live a ser yes the the people will argue with your theology but they can't argue with your life see prove what is acceptable unto the Lord how you oh my but my my my situation is so bad well you warned to have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness oh I I I you know I I can't I'm too wounded this this that or the other we that's the works of darkness but rather reprove them how do I reprove them I go rebuke them slap them around no you shine the light you live the light you you be like Christ who was the light and the life and and God so loved the world Jesus literally lived that sermon for it is a it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light if you're willing to do that he's willing to do that see brother brandham and and he cares do you care and he says oh and took a whole sermon does he care does he care brother brandham goes all the way back in the Old Testament and just takes a journey through the scriptures does he care look how he cared in this life and in this life and this sister and this brother and he goes on and goes to the New Testament showing and proving that he cares and he even comes into the modern day and tells a story of a young man who was treating his his wife wrong and there was a a breach and he had just they they had just left so happy and the and the man had something happen in his mind and he had a he had some kind of complex that's that raised its ugly head it hadn't been dealt with and he comes back and the man was just despondent the marriage was over and the relationship was done and they didn't even know what to do but brother Brandon begins to pray and the Lord come on the scene and healed that man and and turned it around and took that complex away and he said see Jesus cared about that young man he cared he'll care for you today brother Brenham said but you got to care first if you care then he'll care if you're here today say Lord I care enough I want a new purging I want my whole life to be like you I want I want to live I want to bring you glory if you care enough to do that if you care enough to say forgive me of all my wrong ways and my wrong thinking and let my life be taken over by you then he'll care enough to do it see that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil the days are so evil friends that there there's hardly a there's hardly a place for for you to go out into the world and be anything other than the love of God the days are so evil it's the world's already got it hard enough as it is without God's family being trapped up in this kind of stuff so you know the question becom he says wherefore be you not unwise I'm coming this this could be part of my final admonition to you today before I close be therefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is see so you know where are you going to hide now what what what's your what excuse will you give yourself what pass will you give yourself now after hearing this sermon just this one and all I've done is confirm to you things you already know and I can say as Paul I mean there would be some some pull pits I would go to where I feel like I got to almost rebuild the foundation and for I could even get in anywhere this don't this ain't one of them pull pits you're wellfed yeah like Paul said you have no need that I teach you anything you you yourselves already know I'm here to stir you up by way of remembrance by way of remembrance you know these things are true you've said here and raised hands and said amen along with me because we know this is true yeah I want to own it yes Hallelujah we forget sometimes that in blaming everything and everybody else we have seen the enemy and it is us tell you something friends it starts with repentance from your heart and repentance is more than just saying I'm sorry repentance from the heart is a pledge to God that you will begin today to let Christ be the Lord of all your life all your feelings all your emotions come on Saints how many are willing to take that Journey he can fix anything if he's given full sway I want to say to you today the Holy Spirit made me write this in my notes he wants to fix it I'm here to tell you he wants to fix it because he knows here's why he knows that in repairing your marriages he repairs his relationship with you see and that's what he's really been after all along my burden today is not to call you to a New Birth by the Holy Ghost but to say that the Holy Ghost is a fire that needs to be burning in our lives it needs to be a it needs to be affecting rather than being affected you remember you remember brother Brandon when he and I'm I'm I'm going to close right here um the musicians can return let me just close right here have our musicians and song leader come back brother brandham and standing in the Gap real dose of humility for the prophet begins to MIT you know his own breakdown and his own feelings and his own hurts remember that to the to the degree that he got like Jeremiah he just said I just don't even I don't even want to do what I'm doing anymore I just want to go back into the Wilderness be a Trapper and if the Lord gives me a word I'll come out of the Wilderness like Elijah and I'll give it to the people and I'll turn on my heels and go back people had done that to him he was a Man Who Loved people he was a man who cared about people and to have given his whole life that's hard to endure you've you've given so much and people have thrown it back in your face that's hard to endure those are the scars that pastors endure pastors never really have a problem if you have a problem just because you have a problem that doesn't make you a problem to the pastor people say I'm sorry I've been such a problem you haven't been a problem as long as you're not one of those who has a problem and wants to keep your problem then that's a problem and those are the things that wound so deeply when you when you spend so much of yourself and you're spend and willing to be spent and then have that thrown back in your face it's hard to endure and brother brandham had just had had had enough of it like Jeremiah I'm done I don't want to preach anymore you know and uh God took him on a journey remember he showed him that man that looked like Fletch and he showed him that burning dump along the side of the road remember that remember telling that I mean you know think of think of the think of what God showed him a smoldering dump that's a if you've ever been around a smoldering dump it's not a place you want to be it stinks the things that already stink when they're smoldering they really stink and everything is just strewn it's just wreckage CU nobody cares it's just all the refu and garbage and I'm going to tell you something friends now it's smoldering there's smoke proving there's fire but nobody wants to be around there it's not like a bonfire where you say hey hey y'all this Friday night this Saturday we're going to have a bonfire man everybody gets excited everybody's drawn to that they want to man it's a bonfire wow there's nothing negative about it it's all positive yippee let's build it bigger see because a blazing fire like that is a positive thing a smoldering fire that's just not hardly it's just burning barely enough just to smell bad nobody wants to be around that and brother brandom said if you carry out your plan this is what this is your future and brother brandom said I I stood there and I thought he said I was cold and I looked out into that dark dark Ness and he said I thought think I used to preach to thousands now here I am a smoldering dump and the image of Fletch and that's all I'm ever going to amount to but God didn't want that for his Prophet but brother brandham had to choose if you say well could he have chosen otherwise of course he could have although God knew he wouldn't Abraham could have chose not to believe but brother brandham said God knew he would accept it otherwise he never gave him the unconditional Covenant he would have made it conditional in case he ever changed his mind but he knew Abraham would believe it so brother Ram said he would have never gave him that kind of unconditional Covenant except he already knew Abraham would believe it he knew brother Brandon would make the right choice but yet brother brandham still had to make it he had to be willing to come back for healing and be restored he had to be willing to be to the bride what she needed him to be husbands wives children families churches this is a collection of families that's what a church is you're going to have to be spiritually healthy you want a spiritual church amen you want a spiritual church you got to have spiritual families amen and the only way to get spiritual families is to have heart experiences with the Holy Ghost and be up be a bonfire don't be a smoldering dump be a bonfire be something that is helpful to people and attracts people amen we are Kings over the flesh we are Kings over the world we are Kings over the devil amen do you believe that we are Kings over sin amen there's nothing that can hinder you if you're willing to let go as they say and let God Amen let's bow our heads father I thank you that I was able to conclude my thought today got all the way down to the bottom of my notes father feel unburdened now and I Lord we thank you we Rejoice Lord the the first half of the sermon was just to establish to the people who they are and the position they carry and what the responsibility is and what Christ has done for us and then and then what how does that become incumbent upon us and we rejoiced in it Lord but then we had to come down where we live and you know find these areas is where you come to our address and you deal with our hearts and you deal with our lives and Lord it becomes like this it becomes more somber it becomes more thoughtful it becomes more sincere and I think that it ought to be that way we need to think like David think on our ways brother brandom talks about your servant David when he said I thought on my ways he said David knew that he had made God an awful lot of promises but he hadn't really kept them very well and it bothered him I thought as I thought on my ways he thought about all those promises all those bold declarations all that the determination that he never put wheels to he never really had kept it never saw it through to a conclusion and it bothered him and he said I've turned my feet toward the lord I pray that it be today Lord God let us think on our ways and see where we measure up according to the word we've heard today we love and we Rejoice being a part of it but what does that mean it's got to mean something lord it's not just you're not just here to entertain us you're here to mold us and make us and if we'll care enough you'll care cuz you're the only one who can do it anyway we can't fix ourselves but we we've got to at least care and we've got to at least be honest and we've got to at least be like David and think on our ways and acknowledge our shortcomings before you raise up our hands and surrender and say Lord God have your way in my life have your way in my life Lord God show me Lord H show me yourself more clearly let me see your movements let me be fervent let me be near you let my life be filled with sincerity we're almost home it's almost over this is the only chance we'll have to lay up Treasures for that life the only opportunity we'll have to live for you the Earth Lord Humanity coming to the end of 6,000 year journey in a fallen Condition it's almost over lord mankind will never walk the earth again and that new heavens and that new Earth ungodliness will never again walk the surface of this Earth I want to be part of that Lord I I look forward to that I want to be part of that unfolding hidden Mana to where he and that word someday will become what you never dreamed possible I know that involves me I know I'm part of that there's some type of burgeoning that lays ahead for us all and I I want to be in that number I want my family to be in that number I want my spouse I want my children I want this church I want all my loved ones Lord God don't let me get in the way help me Lord God to surrender me so that you can be that bright and Shining Light I commit it into your hands in Jesus name amen amen
