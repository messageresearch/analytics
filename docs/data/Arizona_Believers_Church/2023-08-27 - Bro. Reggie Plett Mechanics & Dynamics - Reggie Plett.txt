TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but I want to read uh the first nine verses of Proverbs chapter 8. doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice she standeth in the top of high places by the way in the places of the paths she crieth at the gates at the entry of the city at the coming in at the doors now this is her crying this is this is uh wisdom and understanding these are the words she's crying in these next verses unto you o men I call and my voice is to the sons of man oh ye simple understand wisdom and he fools be of an understanding heart think the Lord even speaks to the fools here for I will speak of excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right things for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an Abomination to my lips all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing forward or perverse in them they are all plain to him that understandeth and write to them that find knowledge amen would you pray with me one more time our precious Heavenly Father Lord feels so good Lord to be in this place Lord this building that we have consecrated that has been set aside for the service of the Lord and Lord as we've come in and we've worshiped you Lord we've sung our praises to you we ask that God you've you've felt invited that you feel Lord that you hold the preeminence in this place that each one here has come with a desire Lord to look to you and to receive from you and God we want to give you the high place Lord this day we would ask that God you would as these words would be spoken that God your Holy Spirit would move through this building Lord it would Quicken the minds of your people that as they begin to think on the word of God a God you would draw close and your spirit God would begin to minister to the desires of their heart the Lord you would Minister to the needs that they have God pressing needs in their lives that God when that our faith could reach out and grab a hold of the Supernatural and bring it into our bosom and say that was for me that God it would change our lives forever in a greater way the Lord we would become closer to you and that we would recognize that God your desire is always to be closer to us we commit ourselves Lord we consecrate ourselves we turn our attention fully to you this morning and we ask now that you would have your way in this service be with our pastor Lord those that are traveling those that are not here that wish they could be here I pray you'd minister to them where they are we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you you can be seated this morning my title is mechanics and Dynamics and I picked this uh slider I put this slide together because this top picture is just a rendering it's some artists rendering of an atom it's very crude rendering on each of those spirals that would be gathered going around that little Center ball there's actually other little balls cycling around that ball and those are protons and as brother Eli was ministering Wednesday night about some of these things I thought boy best of luck to you to explain some of that because I I I I felt like I was right with him I was like I I don't know I'm no physicist I'm I'm no scientist but there's there is a principle and the scientists can grab the mechanics of something and they love that they love the mechanics of an atom and and the build up of an atom but the bottom picture is the result of an atom being split now this if if I did not if I couldn't explain to you atoms when they split they create an explosion or they create an implosion which then creates an explosion when you when you put some other things with it and you say well I have no idea what you're talking about don't give me the science of how that works and I just detonate a bomb you go I got it I get it and statistics have shown and this is statistics which again is really very mechanical and boring to me um but it's statistics that show that men and women are more alike than they are different we are more alike than we are different however at the far ends of the spectrums the differences are very big and in other words it was described in one way like this when just given free choice for uh life uh for for for a job for an occupation when when not pressed upon when not leaded LED in any direction as a child not not groomed as a child to go a certain way in life like in for instance some of the fathers are saying you know you know my son I want him to become a great athlete I want my son to be a great athlete and so they put posters up in his room of athletes and sports and they buy all the sports equipment for him and they stick it in his room and he's just crawling and the mom is like what are you doing he's like my boy you know my boy's gonna he's gonna be a pro athlete and like we don't even know if he's going to be able to talk you know but fathers will then you know son well son what are you doing you know what are you doing with your free time let's get outside let's throw the ball let's let's hit hit the ball let's whatever it is whatever ball or whatever sport it is that you're doing you're training your child to become the pro athlete for let's get on the ice for the Canadians out there if if you didn't groom them to go a certain direction to become an engineer to become a doctor if you just left human beings alone to free choice without giving them in any direction statistics show that males that the vast majority of males will tend to go towards the stem fields which is like engineering and building and I don't know science things like that and women tend to go into Social Services Health Care Nursing those type of professions and they say statistically that is because men are geared toward liking things while women are geared to liking people now again those are just statistics there are men who care more about people than things and they're women who care more about things than people and all the men are going Amen brother and the sisters are going Amen brother and you know exactly what the other person your significant other that's sitting next to you no you know exactly which way they lean if you spent enough time Mike and Maddie you'll figure it out these next four slides if we go through these next four slides slowly is to evoke an emotion from from some of you so if you could just hit the next slide Brother John and then the next one and then the next one and then the next one now some of you you're you're what is the what's the chemical that's being dopamine your dopamine is just on fire right now I can start preaching right now and and I'm going to get more amens but these next four slides and the next one and the next one and the next one now the men that are looking at this are like uh but the women who are sitting here the women that sounds terrible excuse me you for the sisters who are sitting there looking at this they're going yeah that's my man and they you know they're looking in the bank accounts sitting okay they're like thank you and what we have here is we have mechanics and we have Dynamics and the men who like the things care about the mechanical parts of this thing and they're going sweetheart look at this new drill I got sweetheart look at this new saw I got isn't this exciting and she's like can you build me this thing she doesn't care about the thing she cares about you doing the thing and and and you want her to appreciate the thing but she only appreciates that you got her thing done that's terrible isn't it sisters and so when we were looking at mechanics and Dynamics we're all geared a different way now I'm going to give you a little bit of History my background is Dutch and Irish and probably some German and maybe English I'm a real Heinz 57 and Canadian and now all of the stereotypical things that you'd like to say about each of those races are running through your head Irish um Dutch mm-hmm and as each of us then now introspectively begins looking at our culture looking at our past you begin thinking about well what is your background and what is it that they say about your culture and you go uh-huh um and You Begin thinking about these things we have tendencies to do certain things and to act certain ways it's just inherent in us when we're born it's just who we are it's so what we do and then we like to place it upon our backgrounds and that's that's okay there's nothing wrong with that we even hear brother Brandon I'm talking about that that my people they were Irish and and and my mother was Native American and he I was I had a temper to fight a buzz saw as a as a child and you know I went to those kids and you know I was gonna shoot every one of them I had intentions to shoot everyone and the gun went click click click click click click click you're like what some of you were are absolutely foreign to that that I have no there is no tendency in me to ever when somebody Rises up against me I shy away I would never go after somebody with a gun and some of us are going oh exactly you know exactly that's exactly what I would have done it's the way we're built it's our mechanics it's the way we're built up and then the Dynamics that works within us say great thanks for this lesson this morning where does this apply in the word of God I think it applies in our entire lives and it applies Within and and I always go I always go in and I go out and I and I say you as an individual have your own walk with the Lord that's you and the Lord and that's your first Circle you and the Lord and after that Circle you may have a significant other and it's you that significant other and then and the Lord and and that Circle then just got a little bit bigger and then you start having children and that Circle that Clan just got a little bit bigger and then perhaps they're blessed enough to be a part of a church body and that Circle just got a little bit bigger and then your work uh your co-workers and then your community and that Circle just gets bigger and bigger and bigger as it goes out and I my desire is to see God working in all aspects of my life and I think that's every believer's heart is that God I want to make sure that this is secure that this bond between you and me is secure after that we'll work on the next circle out and then the next circle out and then the next one and so forth and and some of us are so good at that that we're effective within a community that within the within a greater Community within the the mayor and and and the people that don't know anything about the message of this hour are still affected by the message of the hour in your life and when I see somebody who who's good at that I go praise God I want to be more like you I want to be more like that but I need to take make sure that these things are taken care of first before I try that so I have a I have this quote that I'm going to read it's very lengthy but I I couldn't shorten this up because I want you to get the the full Dynamic of this of this quote so you get the picture so this is from the message the impersonation of Christianity remember random says now praying that God will understand I know he does he understands we know that now I was speaking to a very scholarly man from Canada so here we go right away go ahead with your stereotypes and as we know the Canadians are if you know them have ever had personal acquaintance with them they are Scholars very deep most of them and they do not have the troubles up there that we have here now that doesn't mean Canadians don't have troubles they have troubles up there we don't have down here okay and in there I found that this man yet not much older than I he's probably 50 and he was completely grayed and his mustache was gray and yet not over 50 years old and I said to him my brother when he came to the room where I was staying the pastor of a church I said looked at him and just a few years ago in Saskatoon when we had a great meeting together at the big arena when I first started into the Evangelistic meetings he was black-headed his mustache was black and he was had two young daughters and they're married now and got children and so I said in my heart oh what has happened he's wondering what's made him go gray so quick what's happened he said brother Branham about two years ago I thought maybe the Lord had called me to the United States for work he said I went to the West Coast and got connected with the certain broadcast that goes National and he said when I seen the dishonesty of the way they misused the finance that was sent in he said I just as a Christian couldn't stay there any longer I left and I got hooked up with another said it was out of the frying pan and Into the Fire he said then I just kept and found out so many things and said to find the weakness of the American pulpit and I said brother that is true we have no middle class here to speak of we either have the real cold and formal and indifferent or the extreme fanatic okay so I'm I'm taking a little bit of of artistic Liberty here to demonstrate mechanics and Dynamics and I'm likening mechanics to this real cold formal indifferent it's very mechanical then you have this real fanatical which is very Dynamic it's all Dynamics and we don't have the middle ground and I said it's too bad and he said then I come here and he said brother Brandon as soon as I got here and my first message I found out it was beating on the piano and turning over the chairs and he said then I begin to wonder and said then through it all I I tried to preach the gospel just in the word and when it did he said there was something another that after a while the Lord let me break through to the anointing and brought the Holy Spirit came into our midst with a love and the peace of God began to flow over the building just by preaching the gospel and said then I said now the holy spirit is here and we will now Worship the Lord and concentrate Our Lives unto God wouldn't that be a nice service that'd be beautiful and said some young boy with not enough wisdom to hardly get in the door runs up to the pulpit he said amen preacher that's right look oil's been dripping out of my hands all morning Hallelujah let people come up here and I'll get this anointing oil for healing he said brother Branham I said Sonny find you a seat and sit down and said you know what happened the presiding Elder said to me you find you a seat and sit down he said how will we ever how can you or preachers who try to hold that position between the two Fanatics balance the load I said just the grace of God oh what a place that's the truth just the grace of God and the man threw his hands in his face and wept till the wife and I standing there and the tears dropping off on his trouser legs he said brother Branham I'm heading for Saskatoon to get out of this mess of evil spirit and I said that is true the American Social intellectual groups has become so against the other group and the other group has run forth into into Fantastics until the true gospel it's hard to find a place of approach and to get a preeminence but and as I left the house speaking to brother Cox on my road down he knows nothing of this and he sits here down the road I said Lord how true that is and how hard that it's been to try to get the true gospel to the people pulling from both sides and trying to hold in the middle of the road as we've as we've contended from that since the hour the Cornerstone was laid see now in some I said what about these Americans down here what will happen to them and it seemed like something said just spoke to me and said what are you doing what is this to thee follow thou me so I just I'll stop here to say each of us may look at somebody else across the building across the street at another church across the world and we look at them and we look at the way they're acting and we see the way their church is doing it and we see the way our brother or our sister does things and in our minds we're thinking why do they act like that why is it that they do things like that why do they do the that the way they do it the Lord is saying what is that to thee what are you doing follow thou me you follow me and we say yes Lord that's true God help me and then the vision returned to my mind the day that I laid the Cornerstone on return home I was quoting it to my wife how many remembers the vision of the morning of the Cornerstone it's laying right there in the Cornerstone Now 23 years ago I think and it was I was just across the street here just waking up one morning about seven o'clock in the June when the Cornerstone was laid I believe or July and on the morning looking out towards the rising of the Eastern Sun I was praising the Lord because the Tabernacle would then be have this Cornerstone laid Mr Markham and them had been here and many of them had digging the foundation and so forth and I was to lay the Cornerstone we have the pictures and so forth of it and each one was to place in this Cornerstone a certain little token and even Catholics come by and drop their little beads and so forth whatever they had into the Cornerstone but that morning the holy spirit said to me as I was laying there I went in them days I didn't know to call it a vision I just said it was a trance and I saw a vision which spoke and said that my work would be between the two faculties of the Pentecostal the Trinity and the Oneness and there was an empty place on each side to be filled I did not cross them up I just broke from each tree and planted it down and up into the heavens went the great trees are growing quickly and the fruits fell down and they were delicious I was eating them and at the cross just ahead of me lay all covered with fruits and then when I got to the place the Holy Spirit come down to the top of the trees and said shaking and roaring and it said do the work of an evangelist said when you come out of this read second Timothy 4 said do the work of an evangelist this is not your Tabernacle and I said where and I seen the Tabernacle as it is today I said where is my Tabernacle and he sent me down under the bright blue sky and he said do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but shall Heap for themselves together teachers having itching ears and shall be turned from the truth to Fables if that hasn't happened word by word that is why I've tried to strictly stay with the word and that's my subject tonight on the word so we see brother Branham with this desire in his heart not not to go after the trinitarians and correct the trinitarians and not to go after even though I believe he did not to go after the Oneness and to correct the Oneness and to just straighten the Oneness even though I believe he did but to stay in the middle of the war just preach the word of God the unadulterated word of God and the two when they can see the word of God being preached those that have the mechanics say that's true what he's preaching that is true the mechanics are in that I believe it and it and then when they see the spirit moving the Dynamics moving they say my I've never seen that before but the mechanics are right I'll keep listening and It produced fruits out of mechanical starchy cold fundamental people and then those that were running to Fantastics that were the Pentecostals that were the trinitarians they didn't know about the word they just knew that the spirit of God was moving they saw the working the outpouring of the gifts they saw the tongues they saw the interpretations they saw the Divine Healing and they said that is God that's got to be God but they didn't know where to tie it to they didn't know the mechanics of it they didn't know is that I don't know how it works does God even explain how it works and he does he does but they didn't know that but they just knew it was God but they could see brother Branham and they could see those Works they could see that Ministry they could see the Divine Healing they could say that's of God but when they began hearing the mechanics of it the teaching of it the placing of it they said we don't have that but that man's true and and with each of those different groups of people thinking different ways feeling different ways acting different ways when they saw that this was of God It produced fruit Delicious Fruit and we say to those that are fantastic to those that that lean towards the Fantastics that don't take the time to study the word of God but they love the things of God they love the word of God they love the people of God they love the acts of God when we see fruit moving in their life we say praise God bless you and when we see those who are so studied and they know exactly where it is and this is where brother Brandon really talks about the the Pharisees this is how they missed even the coming of the Messiah was that they they knew the pattern of God they knew this is this is how God does things through the pasties come through this way he's spoken to the prophets this way he sent an angel in this way therefore when he comes he'll come this way and when he didn't they missed it they were so caught up in the mechanics of the thing that when the Dynamics took place they missed it so we see these two groups of people we say whoa where am I who am I and I believe that as a believer and I I see brother I see in the message of the hour brother Branham the way he was built the way God gave the the Visions to him the way the way he presented the word of God the way he told his stories was all by design a perfect design I believe to the place that the first thing the first desire that brother Branham even in his meetings you can see that he would have multiple day meetings and he would say now these first few days I'm simply trying to get people to embrace the word of God to give their hearts to the Lord then those last services I like to use those for the healing services because if you can get the first part first then whether you get sick again or whatever it's it's a you're a sealed product it's a finished work your body may your you may get healed during the meeting but if your soul is lost what's to what avail and you begin to see how he lined his meetings out so that his first Services were do you know Jesus Christ do you know he's alive and that the spirit that dwelt within that man is here to dwell in you and people would say what brother Brandon was saying the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not for something of the past but is something that's very much for today and so anybody that has tried to create some sort of a mystery fog around that just let's go to the word of God and then see if God will back that up to prove to you that what I tell you is right is true people would say okay I'll I'll cool my Jets I'll sit I'll listen for a little bit and then their faith could grow and they could receive things that they never thought they could congressman upshop who was paralyzed uh you know an invalid for so many years after so many years he comes to a meeting and God heals him why didn't he heal him years before God Was preparing that seed for that so as we look at both the mechanics and the Dynamics and we say oh they're very mechanical or we we examine our own life I'll tell you I'll just I'll go ahead and I'll step out first I'll speak first this morning okay and then the rest of you that have your hands up that want to speak that the camera can't see right now just get in line and then you up in the box seats in the balcony and everywhere else I'm a very mechanical person I'm more mechanical than I am dynamical I don't know if that's even a word I love the studying of the word of God I love to study it I love to run the references I love to look at the etymology I love that I love the study of the word of God and so many times I'm always trying to emphasize to my own family study the word get your Bible sit down study it well why is this happening well have you studied have you looked it's some people really like that some people really appreciate that some people say oh I love that these very tidy it's very it's very orderly other people it drives them crazy it drives myself I drive myself crazy and then you see other people I know of some families growing up in my life they'll do something they'll they'll make a a business decision or they'll make up they'll make a vacation plan without a plan they'll just we're just doing this thing and and then and or they'll make this decision I'm gonna you know I went ahead and I just put down thirty thousand dollars on and you're going you did what and they come back and they're like isn't this amazing I gained 150 000 and you're like how did they do that I don't know I just believed that it would work and I mean we we do laugh at that because it's you know I'm laughing cynically in my head I'm going okay of course you did but the reality of that is is that there's this there's this part of the it's a faith in them that they throw out a fishing line and they pull up a submarine you know I mean like they hit gold and I and I've noticed that a lot of of those people that I'm mentioning man when they hit when they hit it they hit it but when they hit bottom man they hit bottom it's like these Peaks and valleys I mean epic like Rick you know and I'm just like just I just want to gain you know I just I just want any gain but you know and it's like yeah okay well you got it but it's so small nobody it's like but it is a gain right and I and I look at those people and I go I want more of that I do I'll just be truthful I say God I know how I made up this is the point I was getting at was the first thing brother Brandon when he when he put together the church age book the very first part of it is the deity of Jesus Christ and why is that at the front and not the back well it's all through it but it's right at the front and the point is is if you can recognize him who he is it will give you a rest it'll give you a confidence it'll build your faith to know if this is who he is then I'm confident he's in control I'm confident I can lean upon him I'm confident that he's got the answer it gives you this faith it gives you this confidence to know who he is first okay then the next thing is is who are you oh that's a big one so now we're this big complex creature called a human being and we're going who am I you know I mean there's people you look at them in your whole life you go to church with them and you go out they're so put together I tell you they're so put together and then years down the road you go to their home for supper and they're like I tell you I'm a wreck I can't I can't do this I can't and you're like I mean they're just pulling down this whole fabric of what you thought they were and you're like I thought you were so put in there like oh no I'm a mess so we come to church on Sunday morning we get into our prayer closet daily hourly minute by minute we get we we're uttering prayers to God going who am I who am I mean we say it in all kinds of different ways like who am I and they were like who am I okay you know you get these glimpses of who you are and you go oh that's glorious you know the minister gets up and he goes I want to redo the end of the book and you're like I love the end of the book and he's like but the journey to the end of the book is raw and you're like yeah so now he wants to show you who you are and when you begin understanding Who You Are then he says now let's see who we are let's find out who we are and you find that this desire of who he is is for you to know who you are and that he can make you the potential of who you're supposed to be that's the desire of the believer so brother Brandon expresses a little bit these mechanics and these Dynamics he expresses it in in the church in the framework of the church in the framework of of uh I say the church it's it's not the bride necessarily but we're just going to call it the church she's included but it it's also including the umbrella of what is called the church and in the message the token brother Branham says I've always said I've met two classes of people now I've pulled up several quotes here from different messages because he says this a lot and I I want to read them to substantiate because you're going to know these quotes but it substantiates what he's saying you you so that you just it wasn't just something well I don't know if that's what he was saying well he says it multiple places so it gives you an idea that I think that's what he's saying I've always said I met two classes of people the fundamentals and the Pentecostals now I kind of go the fundamentals and the fantasticals he calls it Pentecostals the fundamentals positionally studies the scriptures and figure it out they say well we're sons of God they believe that yes sir but they don't have any faith with it but the Pentecostals has a lot of faith and they don't know they're sons of God like a man got money in the bank can't write a check and the other one can write a check got no money in the bank if you could just ever get the thing together till men and women could realize you that's been truly baptized into the Holy Spirit and you have the token to display you have a right to every Redemptive blessings that God promised everything that he promised is yours hold your token over your unwavering Faith as you pray and over his word faith in his word you say I believe the word I need faith in his word so he said I got faith faith in what it needs to be faith in his word okay the message the identified Christ of all ages and I find out I I find two classes of people as it goes along one of them is the fundamentalists and the other one is Pentecostals now the Pentecostals got something but they don't know who they are and the fundamentalists know something but ain't got nothing with it so now there it's just like a man has got money in the bank and can't write a check and the other one can write a check got no money in the bank if you could ever get that thing together it would be a great thing but now in the face of this way we try to carry the meeting is for you you as the individual for your need in Christ now I like that because there's many husbands that are like holding dearly to their own Souls but they're like I gotta keep it together for my family but the first things first is you your need as an individual God will take care of your family he'll do it he'll do it and he'll take care of you he'll take care of you individually salvation Divine Healing or whatever you have need of is to you by faith know that you're in the presence of Christ and by faith you reach and get it for that's the only way you'll ever get it is by faith we are saved by faith we're healed see nothing that God has to come down and do again he's already done it one more then Jesus came and called that's what's the matter with the people I've often said it's a little ridiculous to say it I find two classes of people as I travel the fundamentalists and the Pentecostals outside of that I don't know about it and the fundamentalists are people who positionally knows where they stand but they haven't got any faith in what they're doing and the Pentecostals is the people who they have has got that Faith but they don't know who they are it's just like a man that's got money in the bank and can't write a check and the other one can write a check and hasn't got no money in the bank if you could ever get it together if you get the Pentecostals to wake up that the holy spirit that you claim to have that's him identifying his name and his word then sign Your Name Across the check and hand it in watch it watch it be recognized by the banks of Heaven husbands and wives you know it's like the husband's like I got the money in the bank and she's like I can write the check get them together you know and watch the the Pinterest show up in your house you know it's like all of a sudden you'll start seeing all kinds of things showing up in your house and you men are like I'm not a decorator don't you worry you put the money in the bank she'll write the check the mechanics and the Dynamics I know I know I know who I am I know my makeup I know which way I lean see the other and I want it I want more of it but I see how far it goes and I go ah I don't know that I want that it's but but but this other is saying I know who I am I know how I act and I know I see that and I appreciate it and I need more of it but they see the far end of it and they go I want nothing to do with that right I mean there's just some of us that it's it's like you know I I tell you we need the spirit we need more Spirit we need more spirit and you look at somebody else who who's like well you know be careful where the spirit goes and and they go oh they're cold they're starchy they're fundamentalists and I want nothing to do with that and the fundamentalist is going praise God I see what God has promised for today you know one day if only I tell you and he sees this other group that's going I'll tell you God is moving and and I see God moving you and they're going cuckoo cuckoo I don't know that I want any of that brother Branham is saying there's fruit in both they both produce fruit good Delicious Fruit if you could get the two together what a feast Colossians chapter 3 and verse 17 and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him we love when people do things in Word so nice it's so pleasant but we really love it when they do indeed we really like that but if you if you only did indeed and not in Word some of you look at me so strangely when I say these things and I've heard this I've heard this discussion so many times do you love me you know I love you I bring home the bacon and I do this thing I know but I want to hear you tell me oh so the word is important and then there's you know oh I love you you know how much I love you oh I love love love love love love love I love him lovey love you it's like then show me you know you're you're all talk and no game okay whatsoever ye do in word and or deed word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus First John 3 18 my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth so this word and tongue is one thing and this deed and Truth we're seeing this connection Saint John 4 23 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him I I love that you worship me in spirit I love it I love it child I work I I I love your worship and spirit you need some truth now with it child you got lots of Truth boy you're loaded with truth good good job so happy how much truth you went and you sought and you found it and I'm happy now it's time to add some Spirit to that truth and I'm seeking those that will worship in spirit and in truth the smyrnian church age brother Branham says he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day you see I tell you brother reg you're such a fine teacher the way you teach things is so beautiful and you know I prayed that God would reveal and he sent you and your that your teaching is just it's teaching me all kinds that's great that's wonderful thank you for the words thank you for your even the faith in me but this teacher he's talking about is an inside teacher and that's not me that's not any man that you'll ever find that is none other than the spirit of God himself The Same Spirit that dwelleth in him if that same spirit that dwelled in him raised Jesus from the dead it will Quicken your mortal bodies too if that Spirit dwells in you [Music] now there's a message it is the rising of the Sun and I'm I promise you I'm coming to a close here shortly which I promise okay the message is it is the rising of the Sun and I find that when brother Brian was talking about mechanics and Dynamics it's the one sermon where he covered he talks about it the most in your table search it will come up the most he does such a nice job of illustrating mechanics and Dynamics and I grabbed one small quote from it says until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit now listen I want you to put your name in here remember that story of the sailor boy who is the sea captain got sick and he he knew that this sailor boy was a Christian and he asked him could you come in here could you read me the Bible and that sailor boy he said read to me something from the Bible and he said well there's this scripture that's always one of my favorites my mother taught it to me and it was he was bruised for our iniquity and by his stripes we are healed he goes over that and the captain says that is so lovely that is so nice he says but you know my mama when she taught me to read it she taught me to put my name in it and he goes he reads this scripture but he uses not by his stripes I'm Healed he he uses his name and the captain says oh that's so nice could that be done for me and he says sure and he reads the captain's name into that very scripture and the captain gets up puts on his coat and goes out and he continues to live because by faith he believed when that boy put his name in there he believed that was meant for him and I want you to believe the same thing when brother Branham says this him uh if he hit on 16 cylinders talking about Jesus Christ so will the bride it doesn't say maybe if he said on 16 cylinders you might hit on eight if he hit on 16 you might hit 12. he said if he hit on 16 cylinders you will hit on 16 cylinders now you say I'm not a 16 cylinder person I don't know if I can do it he said you could he said you would if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride amen for he said in John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again at the last day that's the Easter message the Dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without the Dynamics no good neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics oh my when I read that I think oh God there's hope for me oh God not only is there hope for me I believe you want that for me and if I can believe that God wants it for me then I believe that I will come to that I've got to believe that I and if I don't come to that then the Lord will take me home and that's okay with me and somebody will hit on 16 cylinders somebody will bring both the mechanics and the Dynamics together and I'm not saying that one day I will I believe that God has done that for you that has received the baptism of the Holy for you that do believe this I believe that both is there the opportunity for what we desire to be is a possibility that we can be and this is why I read proverbs 8. now I know this is a little bit of artistic Liberty but just bear with me I'm just going to go over those first three verses proverbs 8. verse 1. doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice imagine wisdom and understanding as mechanics and Dynamics they're crying out they've got something to say they just they've got something that's good that's desirable for you you search proverbs Solomon is constantly saying if there's one thing to get get wisdom few and understanding you know get them they're like sisters and they'll be a treasure for you I'm telling you get wisdom and get understanding and this idea of get the mechanics and the Dynamics get them I promise you it's a benefit I promise you it'll work wonders in your life does not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice she standeth in the top of the high places did you find her did you find her this morning she was in the top of the high places did you find her you say no I was in a hurry to get here we were running late brother the kids were keeping me from her no problem no problem she was by the way in the places of the paths did you find her there no I flew past that at 90 miles an hour this morning on the 101. no problem she crieth at the gates did you get her there did you get it there you say man I tell you I've just I've got all these jobs lined out you don't understand my schedule I'm busy no problem she was at the entry of the city did you get her there no I like to sleep I just you know I'm just going to be honest I'm a lazy person I'm just lazy and I just didn't no problem she was coming she was at the coming Inn at the doors the point I'm trying to make is that there was always there's this opportunity it's this opportunity that's been presented that this idea of mechanics and Dynamics and well I know who I am I know who I am and I know who I want to be and and you know another Sunday you know I can't wait till next Sunday because I might get it no problem it might be there I I have no doubt it'll be there waiting for you but you know it's waiting less than 24 hours from now your job and school and every other problem that's not here at this place on Sunday morning and mechanics and Dynamics are what we need is what we want it's what I'm Desiring for my Monday morning when I when I'm approaching my family first thing in the morning when we're going to do our devotions together if we would do them together I probably won't I'll probably be chasing deer early in the morning okay but when I come back I want the mechanics and the Dynamics working and when I have to go meet the customer I want the mechanics and the Dynamics operating in my life perchance per chance I could be a witness for Jesus Christ it's that daily it's that daily it's the Practical use thing that's what I believe that this message has given us is that practical daily daily outworking and and it's and that's such a terrible thing to say daily it's Moment by moment the the spirit of God moving through me the moment by moment I could say something that might that might have been wasn't brother Reggie that was that was God and you know what that is you know what that is you know when you go when somebody has said something and you go to them later and you say that was just the Lord and then you're taken back and you know you're oh thank you thank you I don't know what I said it don't matter right the opportunities waiting it's sitting there waiting for us she's crying out she's crying out the mechanics the Dynamics she's crying out amen if the musicians would come you know I love that we have the young people right here on the front in my heart I think I'm probably 17 now probably 17 years old at this point I think 17 year olds are allowed to sit up here right I feel like I'm one of you I feel like I'm one of you young people foreign as a young person to go to church because that's just what that's what you do that's what you do on Sunday and I know what it is as a young person to go to church with a with an aching desire in my heart for God to change my life [Music] and you look around at the world around you at the grown at the adults around you that believe the word of God you see how they act you you've got you're going to go home to a family that believes that and you know how they act even even at home and not here in front of everybody else and I [Music] am thankful that you that you've got that foreign say I just want more Dynamics I want to see God more in my life I believe he's there you may be at that place where you say I believe he's there I believe I've seen him in my life I but I need to see him more I need to see him more evident in my life I feel like maybe I've gone cold or Star stale and I need him more the point is is I if you want that he wants you to have it he wants you to have more of that if you say I don't I don't I don't know how it works it seems so mysterious it how does it work so many times you've heard this advice but it's just the truth we're going to say read your Bible [Music] this this is our foundation it's right here the word of God foreign this is our foundation now there's many other books that we're going to recommend that you read good ones as many sermons we're going to want you to read or hear but a few young people I'm not 17. just a little over 25. almost twice but I still I still have moments and you can look around you could look at those that are even older than I am and you could ask them you still have these feelings that I'm feeling that you want more of God you want him more evident and more dynamic in your life and if you looked around those grown people that you have looked to and thought whatever you thought about them if you looked around they would I believe with all my heart they would tell you a man I still feel that way [Music] and if you ask them when you ask that when you felt that way did he do it for you so many of these older Believers would tell you he did it he does it he's faithful he does do it he's faithful at giving both the mechanics and the Dynamics and when I needed more mechanics God created the circumstances for me to search the scripture for me to search it out so that I could be anchored in knowing why he does what he does and when I felt that I was anchored and then my my my mind and my heart thought what could God do that's when the dynamic said oh taste and see [Music] taste those Dynamics [Music] I wonder if we could just sing this together this is the air I breathe this is my daily bread sing it with me
