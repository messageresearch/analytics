[0:00] now let's jump in and go to uh second
[0:02] Peter chapter 3 I've got my clock
[0:06] here that's pretty
[0:08] neat i' there's a clock embedded in the
[0:10] Pulpit here brother minnow now that
[0:12] means absolutely nothing but there is a
[0:15] clock there all right let's let's just
[0:19] look at this we're we're our subject is
[0:21] the Harvest time now um I don't want you
[0:25] to worry about this but when a minister
[0:27] comes to your church and says I've been
[0:29] doing a little ser series at home that
[0:31] usually strikes fear in the heart of
[0:33] most congregations right uh because he's
[0:36] going to try to condense everything into
[0:37] one service and I'm not uh but I wanted
[0:40] to take a principle for you because in
[0:43] the Harvest time it's a really exciting
[0:45] thing to watch at the end of the Gentile
[0:48] dispensation of how many things are
[0:50] connected and I want to look at some of
[0:52] those tonight all right so there's all
[0:55] kinds of things that are taking place
[0:56] but here's what brother Braham said
[0:57] remember these words remember these
[1:01] words that everything is at the
[1:04] end you got to think about this now now
[1:07] for a moment what is a harvest but an
[1:10] end of something isn't it it's a
[1:12] completion of something and so when you
[1:14] come to the Harvest there's nothing
[1:16] beyond that there's only Gathering
[1:19] things in now to the burn that's what
[1:21] that's what the whole goal is is to have
[1:25] uh what what you've planted what you've
[1:26] swn and so Harvest represents an end
[1:30] and here's a prophet coming to us and
[1:32] signaling not only to us but to the
[1:35] whole world hey we're at an end time
[1:37] cycle we're at the end folks wake up
[1:40] there's nothing Beyond this for the
[1:42] Gentiles so therefore what's been sown
[1:45] is now showing itself in this Harvest
[1:48] cycle and the only thing left is a
[1:51] gathering in a gathering in to the
[1:53] father's barns okay so that's that's the
[1:57] principle and brother Braham says things
[1:58] like this many times in many places he
[2:00] says remember these words that
[2:02] everything's at the end civilization is
[2:04] at the end there's only a pretty thin
[2:07] veneer of civilization left in our
[2:09] world democracy is at the end that's
[2:13] interesting everything he said the
[2:15] nation is honeycom just any time be
[2:17] blown to Pieces other nations he said
[2:19] the world's at the end every moral thing
[2:21] must die that IMM immortality can take
[2:24] its place and he said we got to come to
[2:27] this place we're here we're at the end
[2:29] and nothing else can care now but Jesus
[2:32] and He does care so the name of the
[2:35] sermon is he careth for you and he says
[2:37] when you come down to that end point
[2:40] when you come down to that end in in
[2:42] season he said now you've got to make
[2:45] sure you know the one who's going to
[2:47] care for you in those dark times and
[2:50] you've got to be aligned with him and so
[2:53] that's what he's reminding us so there's
[2:55] many many scriptures now many many uh
[2:57] statements about this Harvest cycle but
[2:59] Jesus says in Matthew 13 let both grow
[3:02] together until the Harvest and and the
[3:05] the the workers in the parable are
[3:06] saying hey we notice now there's weeds
[3:09] in the field should we go and pull them
[3:10] up and the master said no no leave it
[3:12] all leave it all and let it grow
[3:14] together until the end so everything
[3:17] carries on in the same path until the
[3:20] end and in the time of the Harvest I
[3:22] will say to the Reapers gather you
[3:24] together uh first the tears and bind
[3:26] them in bundles and burn them but gather
[3:28] the weed into my barn so that tells us
[3:30] something we have an ingathering of the
[3:33] wheat and we have an out Gathering of
[3:36] everything else right so that's the
[3:39] picture that we should have about this
[3:41] Harvest Time that there's a there's a
[3:43] precious commodity that's gathered in
[3:46] but there's also an out Gathering
[3:48] there's something that is not needed and
[3:50] it's gathered away from this over here
[3:53] the separation finally
[3:55] comes and and and this this we know very
[3:59] uh commonly is what happens in the end
[4:02] times so when we think of harvest time
[4:04] and here I am with you know Saskatchewan
[4:07] Farmers here trying to talk to you about
[4:09] the Harvest so you folks can just uh get
[4:12] get on your phones for just a few
[4:14] minutes here and I'll I'll be right back
[4:15] brother
[4:17] minnow we think of harvest like this we
[4:20] think of uh a field of wheat but you
[4:23] understand right that we are the Harvest
[4:26] in the last day it's the souls of men
[4:29] that God is looking for right you
[4:31] understand now this is not about a bunch
[4:33] of loaves of bread this is about you and
[4:35] I right okay there's three principles I
[4:38] want to give you here about this Harvest
[4:39] Time number one if you planted a seed a
[4:42] harvest is inevitable the outcomes
[4:46] expected I mean we know what's going to
[4:48] come at the end of the growing cycle
[4:49] without any interruptions we know that
[4:51] if we plant wheat we're going to have
[4:53] wheat at the end and and that's the
[4:56] outcome I mean we know what we're going
[4:58] to get the second thing is you cannot
[5:00] change the outcome in the
[5:04] Harvest Right what you whatever you sow
[5:07] that's what you're going to reap so you
[5:09] can't pray and say oh Lord give us
[5:12] something different in the Harvest no it
[5:14] depends on what you
[5:16] planted right that's that's what's
[5:19] important here and you can't be looking
[5:20] for a different outcome now let me give
[5:22] you a little example I've had people
[5:24] come to me I've had one time I remember
[5:26] specifically I had a parent come to me a
[5:28] father come to to me and uh he was
[5:30] having problems with his 18-year-old
[5:32] daughter now a teenager and kind of
[5:34] growing up and uh she was exhibiting
[5:37] Tendencies of disrespect and lack of
[5:40] communication and wanted to do her own
[5:41] thing didn't want to listen to Mom and
[5:43] Dad and uh it it was uh it was not very
[5:46] good I mean she was getting into some
[5:47] real trouble and he came to me and he
[5:50] said brother Barry he said you're here
[5:52] to talk about families in our church
[5:54] here he said 'I want you to talk to my
[5:56] daughter and fix the problem
[6:00] and I said to him sir you cannot change
[6:03] the outcome in the
[6:05] Harvest we've got to go back a little
[6:08] bit here and we also have to begin to
[6:10] sew something better in her heart in
[6:13] order to get a better
[6:15] Harvest because we're not going to
[6:17] change the outcome in the Harvest time
[6:18] does that make sense and the third thing
[6:20] to obtain a different crop you got to
[6:22] sew different
[6:23] seeds every one of us can do that right
[6:26] we can seow better seeds whether it's in
[6:27] your marriage or your family or your
[6:29] work or your whatever uh we want to be
[6:32] able to sew the right seeds to get the
[6:34] right
[6:35] crop okay so brother brandom says again
[6:38] he's infinite he said certainly he knows
[6:40] you and what are you scared about now
[6:42] here's what I I I I I need to say this
[6:44] at the beginning here so that uh we have
[6:47] this underscored and he said he put your
[6:49] name on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[6:50] the foundation of the world what are you
[6:52] worried about you've got the Holy Ghost
[6:53] sealed into the kingdom of God how many
[6:55] can say amen he said the church is
[6:57] scared and I'd say the world is scared
[7:00] he said but don't be scared fear not
[7:03] only believe that's what God wants he
[7:05] wants you to believe him he want you to
[7:07] trust him with all of your heart so
[7:10] there are things that are happening that
[7:12] you may not be able to understand there
[7:13] are things that are happening that will
[7:15] look very illogical and even very
[7:17] dangerous uh coming up in the world
[7:19] there's things that uh you know uh
[7:21] nations with their fingers on triggers
[7:24] uh that would have detrimental
[7:25] consequences uh in our world here but he
[7:28] says brother bam says a l lot of people
[7:29] are scared but he said don't you be
[7:31] scared I want you to only believe that's
[7:34] what brother bram's advice that's good
[7:36] advice for all of us to take now let's
[7:39] go back to Second Peter if you don't
[7:40] mind and if you have your Bibles here
[7:42] this is the one passage I want you to
[7:44] read with me here second Peter chapter 3
[7:46] and: three now all of second Peter is
[7:49] about the end time all of second Peter
[7:52] is about end time prophecies and uh
[7:54] Peter is giving us basically uh how how
[7:57] this is going to go down uh in the first
[8:00] three verses here and I want to pick it
[8:01] up in verse three chapter 3: three
[8:03] knowing this first that there shall come
[8:06] in the last days scoffers walking after
[8:08] their own lust so this is how it's going
[8:10] to happen folks okay this is what Peter
[8:11] is saying this is not now but whenever
[8:14] this takes place when the day of the
[8:15] Lord comes here's how it's going to roll
[8:17] out okay there will be scoffers there
[8:19] will be people who say verse four where
[8:22] is the promise of he's coming for since
[8:24] the fathers fell asleep all things
[8:25] continue as they were from the beginning
[8:27] of the creation and for this they are
[8:30] willingly ignorant
[8:32] of that phrase in the Greeks willingly
[8:35] ignorant of it means they are delighted
[8:37] to be ignorant or unaware of what's
[8:40] coming there's a lot of people in our
[8:42] world who don't want to hear what you
[8:43] believe because then they would have to
[8:45] act on it they'd have to do something
[8:47] about it they would have to respond to
[8:50] what they are now being made aware of so
[8:52] they don't want to hear it and they
[8:53] really don't want you to come around and
[8:54] talk about it and so they're delighted
[8:56] to be unawares just like the people in
[8:58] Noah's day listen we leave that to Noah
[9:00] and his family and the people who want
[9:02] to hang around and try to dispute him
[9:04] but we're just going to carry on with
[9:05] our business just like it was in the
[9:07] days of Noah so is it today there are
[9:09] obvious glaring signs in our world that
[9:12] something's about to happen but you know
[9:14] what there's a lot of people saying you
[9:15] can look after that the government will
[9:16] take care of us the Marines are in place
[9:18] we'll just go on about our business and
[9:20] that's the wrong way to be thinking
[9:22] about our time right they are delighted
[9:24] to be
[9:25] unaware that by the word of God the
[9:27] heavens which were of old of and the
[9:29] Earth standing out of the water and in
[9:32] the water now this is an odd phrase this
[9:34] is odd the way it's worded whereby the
[9:37] world that uh that then was being
[9:39] overflowed with water perished but the
[9:41] heavens and the Earth which are now by
[9:42] the same word are kept in store reserved
[9:44] under the fire against the day of
[9:45] judgment and predition of ungodly men
[9:48] now we don't normally put phrases like
[9:50] that but let me just paraphrase it for
[9:52] you just for a moment what Peter is
[9:55] telling us is that the same God who
[9:57] created the Earth out of the the water
[9:59] out of the ocean and raised up this
[10:02] Earth to where it is use that same water
[10:05] to destroy the Earth in the days of
[10:09] Noah that same God who created and then
[10:12] destroyed is also the same God who will
[10:15] destroy by
[10:17] fire that's what that's what he's simply
[10:19] telling us don't underestimate the fact
[10:21] that God who created the earth now will
[10:23] be reserved to judge it he will but this
[10:25] time he's not going to do it by water
[10:27] he's going to do it by fire so it's a
[10:29] promise that he's actually stating here
[10:32] in that passage verse 8 but beloved be
[10:34] not be not ignorant of this one thing
[10:36] that the day uh that that one day is
[10:39] with the Lord is a thousand years and a
[10:40] thousand years is one day and the Lord
[10:42] is not slack concerning his promise or
[10:45] lazy that word in the Greek it means
[10:47] lazy he's not slack concerning his
[10:50] promise as some men count laziness but
[10:53] he is longsuffering here to us word not
[10:56] willing that any should perish but that
[10:58] all should come to repentance and the
[11:00] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[11:02] a night so there be a suddenness about
[11:04] this in the which the heavens and earth
[11:06] shall pass away with a great noise and I
[11:07] mean we've never seen the elements pass
[11:10] away we've never seen Stars shaken we've
[11:14] never seen the moon covered with blood
[11:16] we've never seen the phenomena that the
[11:18] bible promises is going to happen but
[11:20] it'll all happen and according to the
[11:22] first part of the verse it'll happen
[11:23] quickly it'll happen like a thief in the
[11:26] night and seeing then that all of these
[11:29] shall be dissolved now that word
[11:31] dissolved is a really important word and
[11:33] here it is and we won't have time to
[11:34] deal with all of it but it literally
[11:36] means listen now it means to unbind or
[11:38] to set something free something that was
[11:41] maybe Bound in prison is now let go am
[11:44] it means that something that is uh Bound
[11:47] by laws for instance if there are uh
[11:49] laws that bind the people like in the
[11:52] former Communist Regime or like in North
[11:55] Korea they have laws that bind the
[11:57] people uh and and it it they it deprives
[12:01] them of freedom and freedom of movement
[12:04] watch what Peter is promising he said
[12:06] that when all of these things will be
[12:09] dissolved so I want you to think now
[12:12] about our time that we're living in
[12:14] we're in the season where would you
[12:16] agree all of these things are coming to
[12:18] pass or about to come to pass right all
[12:21] of these things that I just read are
[12:22] about to come to pass or they're coming
[12:24] to pass in our time right God what what
[12:27] Peter is saying is that in that hour
[12:29] God's going to dissolve everything that
[12:33] is
[12:34] bound he's going hey thankfully he
[12:37] Unbound us from the systems of this
[12:39] world or he Unbound you from drugs or he
[12:42] Unbound you from denominational systems
[12:44] or he Unbound you from your own uh lust
[12:47] or your own fears or your own anxiety
[12:49] God's able to do that he's able to take
[12:51] whatever it is that holds you and
[12:53] dissolves that and let you go free Amen
[12:56] in the same way that Lazarus was set
[12:58] free from from the uh grave and the
[13:00] grave flows that bound him you also can
[13:03] be set free your children can be set
[13:05] free anybody out of the world can be set
[13:07] free nothing is powerful enough to hold
[13:10] them when God decides to dissolve people
[13:14] from the things that hold them back and
[13:16] even the systems and the governments of
[13:18] this world and the uh the elements of
[13:20] this world none of it will be able to
[13:21] hold uh the people of God back or the
[13:24] Earth back from coming into its place
[13:26] again he says all of that shall be olved
[13:29] what manner of persons then and this is
[13:32] the question that he asked how how in
[13:33] the world should we act how in the world
[13:35] should we conduct ourselves on a
[13:37] day-to-day basis and then he gives us an
[13:39] indication here in beginning in verse 12
[13:42] looking for and hastening unto the
[13:44] coming of the day of the Lord that word
[13:46] looking for it is the word expect so if
[13:50] if he's asking the questions here what
[13:51] manner of persons Al show Al should you
[13:53] also be we should be a people who are
[13:56] expecting something to happen not
[13:59] wondering my goodness what's happening
[14:02] what's what how in the world is all this
[14:04] going to come to pass and I don't know
[14:06] if God could do I don't know if it's
[14:07] going to happen and he he's he's not
[14:09] saying that he's saying you should be
[14:11] expecting and hastening unto the day of
[14:13] God where in the heavens being on fire
[14:15] shall be dissolved and the elements
[14:17] shall melt with fervent heat
[14:18] nevertheless we according to his promise
[14:21] look for that's the same word we should
[14:23] be expecting new heavens and a new Earth
[14:25] We're not we're not only expecting God
[14:28] to to gather a bride we're expecting
[14:30] that God's got a home for us in another
[14:32] in another kingdom isn't that right that
[14:35] God's got another place for us God's got
[14:36] another body for me and we should not be
[14:38] just wondering that we should be
[14:40] expecting that that's what Peter says
[14:42] you want to know what kind of person you
[14:43] should be you should be a person who
[14:45] lives in expectation of the things that
[14:48] God has promised because that kingdom is
[14:49] coming closer all the time and God is
[14:51] revealing more of that to us in our time
[14:54] and we feel like we're coming closer to
[14:55] that and pretty soon we're going to be
[14:57] changed in a moment and taken into that
[14:59] Kingdom forever and there's a body
[15:01] waiting for us over there and there are
[15:02] all the saints of all the ages that are
[15:04] gathered over there on the other side we
[15:06] should not be just wondering about that
[15:08] we should be expecting that to happen
[15:10] just like we expect that tomorrow will
[15:12] be
[15:14] Thursday nevertheless we according to
[15:16] his promise look for we expect new
[15:18] heavens and a new Earth wherefore
[15:19] beloved seeing that you look for such
[15:21] things wherefore since you expect those
[15:23] things to happen be diligent that you be
[15:26] may may be found of him in peace without
[15:28] spot and
[15:30] blameless
[15:32] now let's just go a little faster here
[15:35] through some of this Abraham was looking
[15:37] for it brother Bram said he said that
[15:39] Prophet knowing it was somewhere he knew
[15:41] that city was somewhere John saw it
[15:43] coming but Abraham thought it must be on
[15:45] the Earth right then why because he met
[15:47] mzc the king of that City and he gave
[15:49] him a tithe in other words he was
[15:51] expecting something he was looking for
[15:53] something to happen and he said the tree
[15:55] of life will be there and it's only for
[15:57] the Overcomers he said do you know know
[15:58] that it isn't for the denominational
[16:00] people it'll be for the Overcomers how
[16:02] many Overcomers do we have here tonight
[16:04] Overcomers are people who according to a
[16:07] prophet have a revelation that God will
[16:09] give you authority over the devil here
[16:11] it is right here it's a revelation
[16:13] that's what you need to pray that God
[16:14] gives you is a revelation of your
[16:16] identity so that you know exactly who
[16:19] you are and you can stand with authority
[16:21] over the things that bind you and say
[16:23] hey sorry we're living in a time that
[16:25] nothing can bind us we have been
[16:27] dissolved by the grace of God and we
[16:30] have been set free and he whom the sun
[16:32] sets free is free indeed all right that
[16:34] makes sense all right so that's just a
[16:37] little of of second Peter chapter 3 but
[16:39] now let's go a little bit further and
[16:41] you need to know this okay we're going
[16:43] to tuck this into our pocket here as we
[16:45] go forward brother Braham said you're
[16:46] standing completely a as if you've never
[16:50] sinned in the first
[16:52] place now you got to watch this quote I
[16:54] love this God don't even
[16:57] know
[16:59] he doesn't know right amen yeah right no
[17:02] that's what brother brandom said I'm
[17:04] only saying what the tape
[17:06] say so in other words let's put it this
[17:08] way let's just say that I'm the woman at
[17:10] the wh and I get a cross on the other
[17:12] side and I run into Jesus on the other
[17:14] side and she says
[17:18] oh lord it's so good to see you you
[17:20] remember me yes I remember you you were
[17:23] the woman from sikar yes I was the woman
[17:25] with with four
[17:27] husbands I sorry I don't remember that I
[17:30] remember you but I don't remember yeah
[17:32] you told me that I had four husbands and
[17:33] the one I was living with was not my
[17:34] husband now and I I was a woman who
[17:37] couldn't even come to the well because I
[17:38] was a sinner and all the other sister I
[17:42] I'm awfully glad you're here I'm sorry I
[17:43] don't know what you're talking about oh
[17:46] yeah yeah yeah I was the woman that that
[17:48] ran into town nobody would have anything
[17:49] to do with me and I I ran back into town
[17:51] and got everybody to come out yes I
[17:52] remember that but I don't remember
[17:54] anything about the the the husbands that
[17:56] you had you know why because God don't
[17:58] even know the things you put underneath
[18:00] the blood God doesn't even know it's in
[18:03] the sea of his forgetfulness read on you
[18:05] were accused of it by the accuser but
[18:07] really from the beginning you were
[18:09] predestinated to be a son or a daughter
[18:10] of God in other words that's the seed
[18:13] that God placed in you to look for
[18:15] something at the Harvest Time right
[18:17] you're washed your old book of
[18:18] divorcement is put away absolutely out
[18:20] of
[18:22] existence even in the mind of
[18:26] God it's out of
[18:28] existence You're The Virtuous bride of
[18:31] Christ washed in the blood of Christ
[18:32] therefore why should we be afraid rather
[18:35] I think we should be a people who expect
[18:37] good things to happen Don't Be Afraid
[18:39] don't be afraid of what's Happening even
[18:41] if it looks pretty dark and confusing
[18:42] and illogical don't be afraid because
[18:45] you've been predestinated as a member of
[18:47] the bride of Christ brother Ram says it
[18:50] again he says God by predestination
[18:52] brought this seed that was in you to
[18:54] life he said and expressing itself cuz
[18:56] that's what seeds do you don't need to
[18:58] instruct seeds you don't need to educate
[19:00] seeds right seeds seem to know what to
[19:02] do right from the very beginning even
[19:05] when they're not doing anything right
[19:07] you put them in the right place in the
[19:08] right environment with the right
[19:10] elements you know what and they know
[19:12] what to do you don't need to say 12
[19:14] steps for pumpkin seeds to produce
[19:15] pumpkins you don't need to do that right
[19:17] they just know and here's what brother
[19:20] Braham says that God by his
[19:21] predestination brought that seed that
[19:23] was in me to life and it's expressing
[19:25] itself and on top of all that he said
[19:27] it's over come it doesn't Express itself
[19:30] down there in the Bog or the swamp he
[19:32] said it's getting up to express itself
[19:35] and neither did you in your sin and
[19:37] adultery and everything that you lived
[19:38] in he didn't Express Christ back then
[19:41] right you expressed the nature of your
[19:43] father and mother as a sinner I don't
[19:44] know about you but I did he said but you
[19:47] didn't Express nothing but there was a
[19:49] seed in there and it got a chance to
[19:52] express itself into life and now you're
[19:54] in the presence of Christ with the
[19:55] sunlight and it brought out what you
[19:57] really was in the beginning glory to God
[20:00] and you know where we see the real me is
[20:02] in the
[20:03] Harvest right that's where we see the
[20:06] real me and you know what that's where
[20:07] we see the real you yes is in the
[20:10] Harvest
[20:11] Time all right now look ju let me let me
[20:16] just let me it's 10 to 10 10 to 10 in
[20:19] Virginia
[20:20] time the first PLL second uh healing
[20:25] second pull prophesying so here's
[20:27] brother Bram he's explaining to us how
[20:29] God has brought him through these phases
[20:30] of ministry he says now we're at the end
[20:33] and and this is what we're talking about
[20:34] here is the Harvest and he said remember
[20:36] that third pole was the opening of those
[20:38] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[20:40] that's been sealed in the word over all
[20:43] of these years let me graphically put it
[20:45] out here because I'm a graphic person
[20:47] and he says the third pole had these
[20:50] parts to it they it was the opening of
[20:52] the word and the manifestation of the
[20:54] sons of God and and that's how that's
[20:56] how it all happens under this last day
[20:57] Ministry hisory and he under that under
[21:01] that manifestation here we had a son of
[21:03] God who manifested the character of
[21:06] Christ in all of these areas right
[21:08] you're you're following the board here
[21:10] I'm just kind of summarizing it all for
[21:12] you in creation when he spoke to
[21:13] squirrels into existence and I I talked
[21:16] to brother George Smith and I I said
[21:18] brother George and sister Rebecca you
[21:21] know she was there when brother BR
[21:22] brought those squirrels home the ones
[21:23] that were spoken into existence and I
[21:26] said what did you do with them I me I
[21:28] mean we'd tend to mount them right or we
[21:30] at least tend to photograph them and put
[21:32] them on social media I mean that's the
[21:34] least you could do she said we ate
[21:38] him that's why he went hunting in the
[21:40] first
[21:42] place and and this the storm spoken out
[21:45] of existence and all of these examples
[21:47] here when you think about it listen no
[21:50] one was there when brother Bram spoke
[21:52] those squirrels into existence right
[21:54] there are no pictures there are no
[21:56] Witnesses and I'll say this to
[21:59] you he's either really right or he's
[22:03] really wrong one or the
[22:06] other in telling these stories brother
[22:08] braham's either really right or really
[22:10] wrong I believe he's really right amen
[22:14] because I think this is what God wanted
[22:16] to display in the character of an
[22:18] overcomer in this last day and did it
[22:20] through an adopted son and and I believe
[22:23] that's that's what we're looking at here
[22:25] and then of course preaching to the
[22:26] total LW so there's a there's an element
[22:28] of witness to the world in just you
[22:31] being here in the last day right with
[22:33] the expectation you have in your heart
[22:35] and people look at you and they say
[22:37] you're different my goodness you're
[22:38] different you don't have metal stuck in
[22:40] your body you don't have tattoos
[22:41] everywhere uh you don't like the music
[22:43] everybody else likes you you love going
[22:45] to church you rejoice when someone dies
[22:47] you people are odd you people are really
[22:50] weird and we say thank you because that
[22:54] is a compliment to
[22:56] us
[22:58] so let's focus for a moment here and I I
[23:02] I use this diagram a lot because in the
[23:05] last days obviously the center of
[23:08] attention is Christ right he's at the
[23:10] center of everything and he's causing
[23:13] everything to take place as it is and
[23:15] these elements are also included on the
[23:19] stage if you like of the last day now
[23:22] here's the reality and I don't know
[23:24] where you all are but when this all
[23:27] happens so when this all winds up you're
[23:29] going to be in one of those bubbles or
[23:31] another yeah there's nobody nobody is
[23:34] not included here unbelievers Jews
[23:38] church members bride everybody's
[23:41] included here so you just want to be
[23:44] sure you're in the right bubble you want
[23:46] to be sure you're in the right place
[23:48] right cuz you're you're going to be
[23:50] affected by end time
[23:52] events one way or the other so I I added
[23:55] a little bit more to this this circle
[23:58] here and I the other bubble I added in
[24:00] was the foolish virgins because we were
[24:02] looking at the foolish virgins and
[24:04] versus the church versus the bride and
[24:06] that's that's another study here but
[24:08] let's look at it here the bride plays
[24:10] its part in Revelation 10 because it was
[24:13] not Revelation 10 was not just about
[24:15] brother brandom verse 7 but Revelation
[24:18] 10 stops at verse 11 so verse 8 to 11
[24:22] says that John took the book and ate the
[24:25] book and prophesied again amen right and
[24:28] you know what that's our part isn't it
[24:31] so then we we know that Israel comes
[24:35] into view and what's interesting is that
[24:38] all the nations of the world gather
[24:40] against Jerusalem to battle and I think
[24:42] with a mere casual glance you can see
[24:45] how that's possible in our time there's
[24:47] a lot of people I mean I have I have the
[24:50] count of the votes of the nations
[24:52] against Israel and there's very few on
[24:54] the pro side most everybody's moved over
[24:58] to the against side and so we're almost
[25:01] at a point where that's fulfilled
[25:02] according to Zechariah it's extremely
[25:05] interesting uh to to look at Zechariah
[25:08] 14 and how accurate it is then also the
[25:11] the world had to become like the days of
[25:13] Sodom that's what God allowed to happen
[25:16] in this last days will we'd all agree
[25:17] with that and then National Powers I
[25:20] mean you could start anywhere on the map
[25:22] the United Nations or China and Russia
[25:25] what's happening in Europe and and so
[25:26] forth all of those things are important
[25:29] the the the foolish virgins are
[25:31] described in Matthew chapter 25 you know
[25:34] coming out of the church out of that
[25:35] last day and brother ramam said it's all
[25:37] connected
[25:39] together that's what's interesting
[25:41] they're not all separate entities here
[25:42] but they are connected the events that
[25:44] cause this are all connected together he
[25:47] said God deals with the Jews he said uh
[25:49] as individuals not as a nation uh s
[25:52] sorry as a nation he said Israel is
[25:55] ready to receive the spirit when Elijah
[25:57] and Moses appears Revelation 11 and he
[26:00] says Israel comes to its Homeland and so
[26:02] forth but we're individuals so God deals
[26:04] with us a little bit differently right
[26:06] but uh but but God's dealing with
[26:09] everybody and they're all
[26:10] connected there there's all of these all
[26:12] of these elements are connected uh
[26:14] geopolitically if you like in the world
[26:16] now watch see the angel of the
[26:18] Lord is on the earth now and he's moving
[26:23] around fixing everything for the coming
[26:26] of the Lord
[26:28] wow who
[26:31] knew it's the same angels that heard the
[26:34] sin when they went down to Sodom we've
[26:38] come down to see whether these things
[26:39] are so wow well the same Angels they
[26:42] know how it all happens right all right
[26:45] so let's do it all right so the same
[26:47] Angels arrive and they arrive at lot's
[26:48] house right and there're all right you
[26:50] come on over here you you stand over
[26:52] here for a second if you will you come
[26:54] on I need you be ready be ready
[26:58] all right so this is lot Andy family
[27:00] right so the Angels causing this saying
[27:02] you guys go out of town all
[27:04] right your lot's rebellious Sons you you
[27:07] you can stay right there because you and
[27:09] Sodom all you guys are going to burn all
[27:11] right so you can stay right there so the
[27:13] angel is making sure that the right ones
[27:15] are out and the other ones are left
[27:17] where they are that's that's not a
[27:19] coincidence something's making that
[27:22] happen guys you want to come and have
[27:24] your seat
[27:26] here one stayed with Abraham the elect
[27:29] and the other one was he said he went
[27:31] down to Sodom and the angels so forth
[27:33] and preached well all right let's let's
[27:35] here's what brother mam I think is
[27:36] saying that the angel of the Lord is on
[27:38] earth
[27:40] now so right now he's
[27:43] saying he's saying all right I if you
[27:46] don't mind yeah be ready you got to be
[27:47] ready okay we only got an hour
[27:49] here I need you over here and I need you
[27:52] and come on I need you I can't pick you
[27:54] up you're too big you sit right here I
[27:56] need you there America is a big country
[27:58] so I got to move at a certain distance
[28:00] here
[28:01] and the Angel's moving things around you
[28:05] may think that you stumbled into this
[28:07] church and you know you made a decision
[28:08] based on a job or something else Hey
[28:10] listen the angel knows what he's doing
[28:12] the angel knows a little bit about
[28:14] things that are happening in another
[28:15] realm than what you
[28:17] know the Angel's able to place you the a
[28:20] Angel's able to uh you know move people
[28:22] around and this this Bo no now you this
[28:25] boy meets a certain girl because a
[28:27] family visits and then all of a sudden
[28:29] they're married you know I recently I
[28:30] talked about that in my own church and
[28:32] how my boys married uh you we were led
[28:34] to go to the church that I Pastor now
[28:36] Hickory Bible Tabernacle and you know my
[28:38] boys all married girls in that church
[28:39] and you know I'd say now my boys are
[28:41] pretty glad that they that I felt led to
[28:43] go to that
[28:44] church and and back when I went to that
[28:47] church back when I went there all the
[28:50] boys were not marrying
[28:51] age but you know what it was I believe
[28:54] that the angel of the Lord wanted me in
[28:55] a certain place and that place the boys
[28:57] in a certain place and then these young
[28:59] girls are being raised a certain way and
[29:01] you know all of a sudden there's a blend
[29:03] there and we think hey don't ever think
[29:05] that's coincidental God is moving you
[29:07] around just exactly where he wants you
[29:09] to be and you should just maintain the
[29:12] you can go back to your seats there guys
[29:14] you should you should maintain that
[29:15] sensitivity to the Holy Spirit to follow
[29:18] what he wants you to do and where he
[29:20] wants you to be because this is what
[29:22] brother braham's telling us it's a
[29:23] moving time it's a fixing everybody on
[29:26] the platform on the St AG where God
[29:28] wants you to be that's exactly right
[29:30] well now think a little higher I believe
[29:32] that God brought those Jews back from
[29:34] all those countries back to Israel when
[29:37] when they had nothing when they had
[29:39] nothing and the angel was watching over
[29:41] Israel and they won battles against all
[29:44] the Arab Nations that were surrounding
[29:45] them that vowed to push them into the
[29:47] sea and they were so desperate back in
[29:51] that day there's a a biography of eer
[29:53] viman who was the head of the Israeli
[29:55] Air Force and he said when they would
[29:56] fly up and practice bombing runs in
[29:58] their planes he said they would have 10
[30:01] lb sacks of flour on the floor of the
[30:03] plane and they would drop those sacks of
[30:05] flour out to mimic bombs to see where
[30:08] they'd land because they could not waste
[30:09] their ammunition on practice runs and it
[30:12] became so desperate for Munitions and
[30:15] help that that finally they sent goldem
[30:17] Myer over to Nixon when all the other
[30:19] nations shut the door on Israel back in
[30:21] that day and Nixon said we are now
[30:24] vowing to help Israel and I believe
[30:26] that's that believe God blessed America
[30:28] for uh those responses because you're
[30:30] always blessed in relation to how you
[30:32] treat the Fig Tree you're always blessed
[30:34] in how you treat Israel and and I
[30:36] believe that the angel of the Lord
[30:37] orchestrated those events I believe also
[30:39] that those Jews allowed to come were
[30:41] allowed to come back to Israel I I I was
[30:44] around when the Soviet Union uh
[30:46] collapsed in the sense that the doors
[30:47] came open it was a unheard of event
[30:49] unexpected event but two things happened
[30:51] when the when the Soviet Union fell
[30:53] number one the message went in now PE
[30:57] now the message had access to the
[30:59] Believers that were in Russia and I'll
[31:01] guarantee I've been there many times
[31:02] there are lots of really good Believers
[31:04] in Russia but they were not allowed to
[31:06] have the message prior to the fall of
[31:08] the Soviet Union and the second thing
[31:10] happened was the Jews got out and they
[31:12] came back to Israel again uh in droves
[31:15] and there was nothing could hold them
[31:16] back I believe that was a uh the hand of
[31:18] the angel of God but the world had to be
[31:20] like Sodom and gomore didn't it and I
[31:22] believe that there are things that were
[31:24] orchestrated in our world because you
[31:25] know what from the Garden of Eden until
[31:27] Woodstock I mean things were normal
[31:29] pretty well men knew they were men they
[31:31] worked women knew they were women they
[31:34] kind of look after the family right and
[31:37] were keepers at home all of a sudden in
[31:39] the 60s everything went nuts right yes I
[31:43] don't believe that's a coincidence
[31:45] that's right I believe the world had to
[31:47] be like Sodom and Gomorrah in the last
[31:50] day there are many many things that we
[31:52] could illustrate here uh you know Hitler
[31:54] and musini and uh there was men raised
[31:56] up who had a certain mindset and had a
[31:59] certain uh uh you know desire to do
[32:01] things that were fulfilling scripture
[32:03] not saying that they were right but I
[32:04] believe that God allowed uh you know the
[32:07] different uh uh conditions to exist
[32:09] within countries for uh these kind of
[32:11] men to take power there has to be a
[32:13] reason why I mean this is more modern
[32:16] here here's uh you know Secretary of
[32:17] State Anthony blinkin and uh Mr abas who
[32:20] was the head of the uh PLO and they're
[32:22] sitting there prior to a news conference
[32:24] that they're having that's why they're
[32:25] kind of looking casual there and uh you
[32:27] know they're they're about to discuss
[32:28] things here about the uh Jewish conflict
[32:31] there in in Gaza but you know what's
[32:33] interesting is the background the
[32:35] background is a picture of the Temple
[32:37] Mount because this has always been about
[32:40] Jerusalem don't think it's about Gaza
[32:43] Gaza looks like parts of the Arizona
[32:45] wilderness I've been over there it's
[32:48] nothing but rocks and dirt and uh they
[32:50] don't have cactuses the only difference
[32:53] but I will tell you it's a wasteland
[32:54] they're not they're not worried about
[32:56] the Arab people are not worried about
[32:58] Gaza itself they're worried about
[33:00] Jerusalem that's always the center of
[33:02] attention over there it's a center of
[33:04] Prophecy for this day and if you go to
[33:06] Zechariah the emphasis is on Jerusalem
[33:09] not on Gaza that's
[33:12] right I believe the angel of the Lord
[33:14] allows that so at the end of the ages we
[33:16] have a cycle a distinct change begins to
[33:18] take place where the church goes into
[33:20] apostasy leoty and darkness and a
[33:23] judgment cycle begins right don't need
[33:25] to belabor that point we know that's
[33:27] true we also know too that the bride
[33:29] enters into what's identified as the
[33:30] bride age how many believe that we're
[33:32] living in a time where uh God begins to
[33:34] deal exclusively with the bride of
[33:36] Christ with an understanding with an
[33:38] understanding that is not parallel by
[33:40] any other age or let me say it this way
[33:43] God does not hide things from us God hid
[33:46] things for
[33:49] us God's a great Hider and he doesn't
[33:53] hide things from us he hid things for us
[33:55] so there were certain things that remain
[33:57] hidden All Through the Ages for us in
[33:59] the last day to know isn't that right
[34:02] and and God God allowed these great
[34:04] things to be revealed and are being
[34:06] revealed today in this bright age and I
[34:08] I listen I'm thankful that we I live in
[34:10] this in this last age I'll tell you what
[34:13] the cycle of restoration for Israel
[34:15] begins and we're we're well into that
[34:17] right we're well up the road in terms of
[34:19] the restoration of Israel and where they
[34:22] are and then fourthly the Antichrist
[34:23] begins to Rise To Rule and and it's not
[34:27] it's it's not in the way that many
[34:28] people thought but he comes in the Bible
[34:30] says with flatteries so he's not going
[34:32] to come in as a beast but we know what
[34:35] his nature truly is all right
[34:40] so I chat a lot with Andrew and
[34:43] different Brothers you know about things
[34:44] that are happening in our time and
[34:47] always in January I'm always curious
[34:48] about what people are are saying about
[34:51] the main events of last year and then
[34:53] what's going to happen ahead now they're
[34:55] not prophets right people in Media or
[34:57] government or not profits but I always
[34:59] think it's interesting what they are
[35:01] predicting what they're saying about
[35:03] what's what's important what's
[35:05] coming and I thank God for a profit just
[35:08] about every day because otherwise you'd
[35:10] be guessing and probing like everybody
[35:12] else in the world and I found this
[35:14] diagram now I want you to take a look at
[35:16] the diagram for a
[35:18] minute in the it it's kind of divided
[35:22] into four sections here and uh let me
[35:24] see if I can I can't I can't do this
[35:26] right no not in these screens on the top
[35:29] part there you got an hourglass that's a
[35:31] time uh time sequence there and the the
[35:35] idea conveyed is that uh time is running
[35:38] out and and that's what they want to
[35:40] imply over over here you have Mr
[35:43] zalinski and Mr Putin there and they're
[35:46] representing the struggles that are
[35:47] going on it's all about bombs and
[35:49] ammunitions and so forth and you have Mr
[35:51] Trump up here and uh this is the the
[35:53] Warfare scene now did you guys enlarge
[35:55] that for me okay okay so let's go down a
[35:57] notch here I thought it was interesting
[35:59] that they put these moons here as well
[36:01] that uh you know represent cycles and uh
[36:04] I thought it was interesting here we
[36:06] have uh medical technology and things
[36:08] related to DNA on this on this quadrant
[36:11] here over here is technology we'll talk
[36:13] a little bit more about technology in a
[36:14] second here and then down here on the
[36:17] bottom we have I I think this is Mr uh B
[36:21] President Biden and this is uh Mr Z in
[36:24] China China and uh we have all the
[36:28] manufacturing and all that stuff over
[36:29] here and over here you have uh and I
[36:32] think this is Biden because we have all
[36:34] of the uh you know the uh global warming
[36:37] and things like that you know and it was
[36:39] it was interesting all right so bring it
[36:40] back to regular size here for me so
[36:43] there what what the article was about
[36:45] was talking about all of these important
[36:48] quadrants in this diagram here but what
[36:50] I thought was really interesting when I
[36:52] looked at it long enough is what's in
[36:53] the middle what's in the center of this
[36:55] diagram what is it that they would have
[36:58] deem most important here for
[37:01] 2024 Ballot
[37:04] Box wow really a Ballot
[37:08] Box why in the world do we have a Ballot
[37:12] Box in the middle of what's going to
[37:14] happen in
[37:15] 2024 well I did a
[37:18] count and in 20124 there are 109
[37:22] election events that are going to take
[37:24] place in 40 different nations which are
[37:27] going to affect over half the world's
[37:30] population in a dramatic
[37:32] way I did the
[37:36] count meaning that by the end of this
[37:40] year we could see a dramatic shift in
[37:42] just
[37:43] about half the population of the
[37:46] world aligning with a different
[37:50] governing power than what they are
[37:51] aligned with
[37:54] Now put on your seat belt 202 24 is
[37:56] going to be an interesting one but watch
[37:58] this in the second coming of the Lord
[38:00] Brother Braham says no matter how well
[38:01] we try to take care of our physical
[38:03] being or to take care of the church
[38:05] there's coming a time when all these
[38:06] things shall pass away you're not in
[38:09] other words you're not going to stop the
[38:11] passage of time that changes all of
[38:13] these things God's got it predetermined
[38:16] God's got it set and you know what
[38:17] you're a part of it and all of it's
[38:19] going to happen around you you just need
[38:21] to sit there and be in expectation for
[38:23] the good things that God has promised
[38:24] for the people of God Amen but there's a
[38:26] lot of stuff going to happen here and
[38:28] brother bam says no matter how you try
[38:29] to protect it no matter how you try to
[38:31] protect your church no matter how you
[38:33] try to protect your political position
[38:34] or your party you know what it's all
[38:36] going to happen God's way because God's
[38:38] the one that's got his hand on the
[38:39] remote right isn't that right all right
[38:42] so there are there are all of these
[38:44] elections that are going to take place
[38:45] and you might think wow it doesn't make
[38:47] much difference let me show you one that
[38:48] does and it's this one and this
[38:50] election's already passed it's the
[38:53] election for the governing power of
[38:55] Taiwan and and despite China's best
[38:58] efforts the opposition party got in in
[39:01] Taiwan and they're the people who are
[39:04] leaning towards
[39:06] separation now they're they're having to
[39:08] do a uh you know a a cooperation with
[39:11] other smaller political parties but uh
[39:13] this man Mr lie uh he is the head of the
[39:16] party that has been uh promoting
[39:18] separation now here's the thing here's
[39:21] the thing you need to know that our
[39:23] government has pledged to support Taiwan
[39:25] in the event of being attacked act to
[39:28] the point where they would put soldiers
[39:30] on the ground in that battle from
[39:33] America American soldiers on the ground
[39:35] in that battle that will change your
[39:39] life that will change
[39:42] things but this is a big deal because
[39:44] now you have the two superpowers that
[39:46] have resources to fight aiming at one
[39:49] another if this thing actually comes to
[39:52] pass that election is over it's already
[39:54] passed the other one will happen in
[39:56] November that will change a lot of
[39:58] things in our world depending on what
[40:00] happens in that outcome right the
[40:02] American election that'll happen plus
[40:05] all the other elections that'll take
[40:07] place I mean this gets really
[40:08] interesting if you're older than 45 this
[40:11] is the way we viewed the world as we
[40:12] were growing up right some of you old
[40:14] folks that are sitting here who don't
[40:15] want to admit you're
[40:17] old we had two ways of looking at the
[40:20] world and and one was dominated by
[40:22] America and democracy and the other part
[40:25] of the world was do at by communism
[40:27] Russian and Chinese communism different
[40:29] brands and so forth but we were kind of
[40:31] supported on two two uh we we existed
[40:35] with two points of view if that M does
[40:37] that make sense where else do you find
[40:40] you know an end time event what what's
[40:41] scriptural about this well here we find
[40:45] in the end time Daniel saw the whole
[40:46] thing supported by two different feet
[40:49] iron and Clay two things that don't
[40:51] mix
[40:53] right and did it work nope they never
[40:58] Blended together so therefore you have a
[41:02] a a distinction you have separate things
[41:04] and I love this diagram because it has
[41:06] the church ages right here on the bottom
[41:07] of it and all the candles are lit here
[41:09] we're at the
[41:13] end and it's just interesting so here's
[41:16] the diagram brother bandam Drew now he
[41:18] didn't have PowerPoint like we have but
[41:21] somebody made notes and I have a sister
[41:23] in my church who was there uh when
[41:25] brother brandom Drew this diagram and
[41:27] this is a uh a sketch of how he drew it
[41:31] back in that day same idea here is the
[41:35] here's the Capstone and as the Jews are
[41:37] returning in this last day because if
[41:39] this is the end of the Gentile
[41:40] dispensation here uh the Jews return in
[41:43] 1948 up until now and the Capstone comes
[41:46] down and smites this image of De feet
[41:49] here so now we have a change and so
[41:51] that's why the the Russian system broke
[41:53] up like it did and all the rest of it
[41:55] there but uh we find that uh brother
[41:57] Brandon places all of this at the end of
[41:59] the church ages Harvest Time right so
[42:04] what what I said to you in the beginning
[42:05] was was a whole bunch of things that
[42:07] happen in the Harvest time because all
[42:09] the seeds are come to maturity
[42:11] everything's come to maturity at the end
[42:12] time so we see the real thing at the end
[42:14] time and here we have ready for two
[42:16] prophets that come out three and a half
[42:18] years in this in this section over here
[42:20] uh and and two prophets that come to
[42:21] Israel according to Revelation 11 I know
[42:23] I'm going fast I'm going to leave you
[42:25] this PowerPoint so you can go back and
[42:26] look at it and look at all the quotes
[42:27] and so forth uh whenever you want to but
[42:29] it's really interesting now what's
[42:31] happening in the world I'll be very
[42:32] brief here that there are other groups
[42:34] now that are rising up because those two
[42:36] superpowers are not uh are not in
[42:39] control as they were so there are other
[42:42] superpowers that are merging together
[42:44] and I'll guarantee you all of them are
[42:45] merging together against America and
[42:47] they're merging together against Israel
[42:49] and that's what's important so we have
[42:51] Brazil and China South Africa India and
[42:55] Russia that's why they call it bricks
[42:58] and they had a summit just recently
[42:59] where they all got together now these
[43:01] people are very different the
[43:02] governments are very different how they
[43:03] make their money is very different and
[43:05] they don't really agree much except on
[43:07] this one thing they hate Israel and
[43:08] number two they don't want to be under
[43:10] the American umbrella in life and
[43:13] joining them this year is going to be
[43:15] five other nations Ethiopia Iran Egypt
[43:17] UAE and Saudi Arabia and those 10
[43:19] nations with all the money they have and
[43:21] the oil resources they have they have
[43:23] more buying power than all the other
[43:25] nations of the
[43:27] earth and so they're going to they're
[43:29] going to cause an influence in our world
[43:31] because they're going to have uh as of
[43:33] January 1st 2024 this is going this
[43:36] group is going to change and there's
[43:38] more people wanting to be a part of that
[43:39] because they don't want to be a part of
[43:41] the American system anymore and they
[43:43] certainly agree with their hatred of
[43:45] Israel what I'm saying to you is that a
[43:47] lot of times you may not even see all of
[43:49] these things happening because if you're
[43:50] watching the media they're only going to
[43:52] tell you what they want you to know but
[43:54] modern events are made clear by CNN no
[43:57] it's not modern events are made clear by
[43:59] prophecy aren't
[44:01] they and so there are things that are
[44:04] happening in the background here that we
[44:06] need to be aware of very important
[44:08] things and brother Ram says and here's
[44:09] the gospel he says come and give a mercy
[44:11] call throughout the Nations for years
[44:13] and we've turned it down and now working
[44:16] the devil taking his seat turning the
[44:18] hearts of those political men against
[44:20] Israel hold it now take a look at the
[44:22] year he says this this is 1956 seven
[44:26] friends that is 66 years ago and brother
[44:30] Braham saying look all these political
[44:32] men are going to be against Israel
[44:33] they're looking over they're hooking up
[44:34] Over Yonder with the Arabs and he said
[44:36] we're as good as gone we'll sink just as
[44:38] sure as the
[44:39] world he says I love my nation I love
[44:41] what it stands for but brother I love my
[44:43] Lord above everything and I love to see
[44:45] my nation to its knees humbling itself
[44:47] but I'm afraid we'll never do it we're
[44:49] at the end time why a mixed multitude
[44:52] got in
[44:53] there so go back to the bubbles now you
[44:56] have you have Israel right you have uh
[44:58] you know the the the bride you have the
[45:00] nations of the earth you have the church
[45:02] foolish virgins and all all those
[45:04] bubbles around and Christ is at the
[45:06] center of it all and all of it's been
[45:08] prophesied and you're living in the day
[45:10] when it's all coming to pass and you can
[45:12] sit there and say this day this
[45:14] scripture is
[45:15] fulfilled and you happen to be in the
[45:18] right bubble you should be thanking God
[45:20] every day you wake up in the morning yes
[45:24] sir all all right can I have a couple of
[45:27] more
[45:28] minutes I have no idea where we are all
[45:31] right let's
[45:32] look this is an amazing statement and I
[45:35] never noticed it until the other day
[45:37] brother time and he said lots of people
[45:39] fail to have discernment about the times
[45:41] we live
[45:42] in but he said as we see the time that
[45:45] we live
[45:46] in there must be something somebody's
[45:48] overlooking somewhere what a statement
[45:51] for a prophet to say there's got to be
[45:53] something going on that you know
[45:54] everyone's missing my my goodness what's
[45:56] happening because God had never let
[45:58] these things happen without giving us a
[46:00] sign and you know what he's telling the
[46:02] people that that's not God's way God
[46:05] always gives a sign wake up everybody
[46:08] there's a sign that's been put in front
[46:10] of you right a prophet hello a prophet
[46:14] that came in the last
[46:16] day and you know what signs do they
[46:18] point you to something signs are not the
[46:20] destiny signs point you to something and
[46:23] brother br's pointing us to something
[46:24] but there's a whole lot of people
[46:25] sitting there saying
[46:26] somebody's overlooking something
[46:29] somewhere that was a great
[46:31] statement so can I show you something
[46:34] here you're probably not
[46:36] expecting the last bubble that I would
[46:39] put on the board would be the technical
[46:44] order of things the digital
[46:48] Revolution now I we don't have we don't
[46:51] have a whole lot of time to go into this
[46:54] but I'll give you a little heads up up
[46:56] next Wednesday night this February 7th a
[47:00] week from the day in my church I've got
[47:03] one of my sons who's a digital guy to
[47:07] give us a an expose on how digital media
[47:13] affects
[47:14] you and I will tell you how it does it
[47:16] really real simply I I don't know a
[47:18] thing right I'm over 30 trust me I don't
[47:20] know what I'm talking about that's why
[47:21] I'm getting him to do it he's he's
[47:23] trained in that
[47:24] area
[47:26] this is what the article said in the
[47:29] economist it said with Ruth ruthless
[47:32] efficiency social media can deliver
[47:35] unlimited amounts of the content that
[47:37] influencers create or Inspire that
[47:40] stopped me because I didn't know what an
[47:41] influencer was and that makes the
[47:44] combination of influencers and social
[47:46] media
[47:48] algorithms perhaps the most powerful
[47:51] form of advertising ever
[47:54] invented I Micah could probably get up
[47:56] here and rattle off what that what that
[47:58] actually means and if trust me I'm over
[48:00] 30 I don't know but what what my son is
[48:03] going to do is talk about these two
[48:05] things influencers and algorithms and
[48:07] how they're tailored to make
[48:09] you attracted to bound to social media
[48:15] all the time and I will assure you it's
[48:18] a very powerful thing it's a very
[48:20] powerful thing now it's from the Tree of
[48:22] knowledge of Good and Evil so there are
[48:24] good things that you can get done and
[48:25] there's there's other things that you
[48:26] can't get done so I was asking him
[48:28] what's an influencer and he said you
[48:30] know it's those guys that uh you know
[48:32] like on YouTube you get on there and
[48:33] they'll show you how to how to make
[48:35] biscuits from scratch right the old
[48:37] women would tell you how to make
[48:38] biscuits from scratch and she' get in
[48:39] there and and uh get her hands in the
[48:41] bowl and she's mixing that up and you're
[48:43] and she said I've got some links below
[48:45] and you you click on the link Amazon
[48:47] bang mail two days later you got all the
[48:49] supplies you need and you're making
[48:51] biscuits just like her because you've
[48:52] been influenced right I said oh wow I
[48:56] know what an influencer is because I
[48:59] only look at two things on YouTube and
[49:02] one thing is sermons and the second
[49:04] thing is woodworking brother Brian you'd
[49:06] be proud of me and I I I look at
[49:08] woodworking things and these guys are 10
[49:11] tools every worker woodworker must have
[49:15] right and so I'm a sucker I mean I go
[49:18] right down into that trap and I I'm
[49:21] looking I'm looking at it and uh guy's
[49:23] doing this Nifty thing with a and I've
[49:26] been struggling with that you know I
[49:27] almost lost my some my fingers with that
[49:29] and he's got and a link is below in the
[49:32] hey click on that bang Amazon two days I
[49:35] got it over in my shop and I'm using
[49:36] that cuz I've been
[49:41] influenced now my algorithm which is my
[49:43] friend whether I know it or not sees the
[49:47] kind of gullible person I am and says
[49:50] let's throw a million gadgets at brother
[49:53] Barry and let's see how he reacts to
[49:56] that so now I'm sitting there saying who
[49:59] knew all these people were out there
[50:01] with all these gadgets whoa it's like I
[50:03] died and went to
[50:07] heaven this is a powerful
[50:11] thing it's a powerful thing powerful to
[50:14] the point of no matter how we as
[50:18] Christians try to
[50:21] influence this great big thing out there
[50:24] called the internet with all of its
[50:25] algorithms we're a minuscule part of
[50:29] that process so if all of us now all
[50:32] every every Christian in the world
[50:34] dedicated their life to being on the
[50:36] internet and clicking only on good sites
[50:39] you still wouldn't influence the cosmos
[50:42] it's way way way too big and powerful
[50:45] for that to change and there are people
[50:47] making decisions long ago about how this
[50:50] is all going to happen that's what's
[50:52] interesting and it's a frontier or a
[50:54] fight or a battle or a trap and we never
[50:57] saw coming and neither did we get a
[50:59] choice because how many of you adults
[51:01] that are here and teens that are here
[51:03] that don't have a phone and I'm not
[51:05] saying you should throw your phone away
[51:07] I'm not saying that at all but I'm
[51:08] saying that we're all
[51:09] involved and some of us are really
[51:12] involved to the point where this is
[51:18] today and I don't know if you saw this
[51:20] or heard this but this was powerful and
[51:23] I was following along this morning as
[51:25] this was F unfolding and I was doing
[51:26] some work and preparing for tonight but
[51:28] I was following this because this is a
[51:31] senate hearing and there are very
[51:33] powerful Senators here in this seated in
[51:35] this role right here and they they're
[51:37] they're doing the pledge the five top
[51:39] Executives for uh for Facebook and uh uh
[51:43] Snapchat and Instagram and so forth they
[51:45] were all there they were all there five
[51:46] of them were there uh Tik Tock were
[51:48] there and tick and talk were both there
[51:50] and they were these these five were
[51:52] standing there 1 2 3 4 5 and they were
[51:55] standing standing there and they were
[51:56] grilling them for the third time about
[51:59] uh their processes and about the effect
[52:01] of social media on young people and so
[52:02] on and by the way Florida just passed a
[52:05] law that you had to be 16 and over
[52:06] before you can use social
[52:09] media and everybody said wow they said
[52:12] it all
[52:14] together so today what would made this
[52:17] hearing very interesting is that in the
[52:20] audience it was filled with moms and
[52:24] dads of of children who had died because
[52:29] they picked up
[52:30] fenel on Facebook they they uh were
[52:33] involved in uh child pornography and
[52:36] they were involved in this that and the
[52:37] other thing and the parents of these of
[52:40] these children who had died are sitting
[52:43] back in the audience and they're
[52:45] listening to these Executives talk about
[52:48] how their one aim in life was to make
[52:50] lots of money and they they had internal
[52:53] documents that were leaked to the public
[52:55] and and and uh Mr Zuckerberg from
[52:58] Facebook said that we a fix a financial
[53:02] value on every young person in this
[53:04] country who uses Facebook anybody know
[53:07] what the amount is
[53:10] $270 and there were people in the
[53:12] audience who had t-shirts on and there
[53:15] it said I am worth more than
[53:19] $270 and in other words the system was
[53:22] designed to merchandise all of these
[53:25] young people that are in the world not
[53:27] only through meta but through all the
[53:30] other major venues as well I mean it was
[53:33] just extraordinary and I listened to a
[53:34] little bit of it and then at the end Mr
[53:36] Zuckerberg from Facebook or meta he got
[53:38] up and turned to those
[53:40] families and said to them I apologize
[53:43] for the death of your children we need
[53:46] to do more and so on and you know made a
[53:48] made a a token apology at least he made
[53:50] an apology but made a token apology and
[53:52] they blasted him after he made that
[53:54] apology and in other words there are
[53:56] real life
[53:58] consequences for this whole thing of
[54:01] influencers and
[54:02] algorithms and I made light of it just
[54:04] in a moment here about the woodworking
[54:06] but I'll tell you there are real
[54:07] consequences when kids go down that go
[54:10] down that slippery slope and they find
[54:12] themselves involved in things that they
[54:14] never thought they'd be involved in and
[54:17] parents and even message believers who
[54:21] get pulled down that slippery slope and
[54:23] find themselves in a place said never
[54:25] thought they'd
[54:27] be we have a responsibility as parents
[54:29] and grandparents to know what we need to
[54:32] know to help protect our children and to
[54:35] have wisdom to be able to use
[54:37] discernment in the time that we're
[54:38] living in because you know what it's
[54:40] here to stay it's just like brother bam
[54:42] said tubless tires and uh you know uh
[54:44] other other things that he said they're
[54:46] here to stay we're not going to do
[54:47] anything to change that and this is here
[54:49] to stay you know what you got to do you
[54:52] got to learn to navigate through Le oysa
[54:55] you got to learn to navigate through
[54:56] this season with
[54:59] wisdom wisdom from
[55:02] above now watch in James chapter 3 the
[55:05] wisdom that descendeth not from above is
[55:08] Earthly sensal and de devilish hold on
[55:12] now it's he James is describing two
[55:16] kinds of wisdom wisdom that is from
[55:18] above is this wisdom that comes from
[55:21] below is this but they're both called
[55:26] wisdom that's what's interesting there's
[55:29] a wisdom that's going to do you no good
[55:32] but there's a wisdom that comes from
[55:35] God but the world calls this wisdom
[55:38] because it lets them know how to replace
[55:41] the muffler in your car and it also lets
[55:44] you know how to you know buy drugs and
[55:46] it lets you know how to do all anything
[55:48] in the cosmos that you want to
[55:52] know watch
[55:55] and the fruit of righteousness is sown
[55:58] in in peace of them that make peace
[56:02] there is a there's a good fruit of
[56:04] wisdom that that produces
[56:07] righteousness but there's another kind
[56:10] of fruit that comes from the other use
[56:14] of so-called wisdom our answer to this
[56:17] whole problem is seeking wisdom from
[56:21] above not from Google cuz I got news for
[56:26] God doesn't even use it he
[56:29] doesn't he doesn't even have
[56:32] it because he doesn't need
[56:37] it
[56:39] huh this gets really
[56:43] interesting brother braham's telling us
[56:45] that the whole thing is going back to
[56:47] the way God intended it in the first
[56:50] place he sit up there in the British ice
[56:53] Fields he said they blast 500 ft down
[56:54] through the ice and there's palms and
[56:56] ferns I've been there I've been in
[56:58] Siberia and they have found the you know
[57:00] the woolly mammoth up there and so forth
[57:02] I've been right up where that in that
[57:03] area where that is and he said it showed
[57:05] it was once a Tropic and he said now it
[57:08] leans back the Earth leans back because
[57:09] of the blast in Noah's Day from the anti
[57:12] luian
[57:13] destruction this is
[57:15] 1964 I'm going to close here
[57:18] okay do you believe this is
[57:21] right come on he's either really right
[57:24] or really wrong one or the other there's
[57:26] kind of no halfway in in things he's
[57:29] saying here amen and I believe the very
[57:31] thing that threw it out of its cycle
[57:33] then is ready to throw it back in its
[57:34] cycle now am man destroys himself by his
[57:38] knowledge and God destroys
[57:39] nothing so we're at we're at the end
[57:42] we're at this har we're in this Harvest
[57:43] cycle where the whole thing is there's
[57:45] remember now there's a gathering into
[57:47] the kingdom and a gathering out of
[57:48] everything else right that's what you're
[57:50] looking at now the real separation that
[57:52] matters it's h is happening okay okay
[57:55] everybody with
[58:00] me last quote Joshua said now you're
[58:04] going to see the glory of God I think
[58:05] it's the last quote I think it
[58:08] is Joshua said now going into the
[58:11] promise and crossing over you're going
[58:12] to see the glory of God for they hung
[58:14] the pillar of fire over
[58:15] them but don't let it get out of your
[58:18] sight because you've never passed this
[58:20] way
[58:21] before good advice I believe there's an
[58:24] exper I believe there's an experience
[58:25] for the church I love it how brother bam
[58:27] connects that with this I love that when
[58:31] he says same thing today you know he
[58:34] makes statements like that I believe
[58:36] there's an experience for the church
[58:37] that's something the church should
[58:38] remember let's move outwards uh towards
[58:41] Jordan tonight maybe you've never passed
[58:43] this way before but let's pass this
[58:47] way God's here leading
[58:50] you he's here to lead you if you've
[58:53] never passed this way to it be unfair
[58:55] for God to say I hope you make it he
[58:58] didn't do that he came to lead
[59:01] us that's what's talking to your heart
[59:04] and telling you to do it is the holy
[59:06] spirit second part of the quote now I
[59:08] can see the people as they went marching
[59:10] on the angel of the Lord went into
[59:12] Jordan before them and the angel of God
[59:14] oh I love this the angel of God will
[59:16] lead you every step of the way say it
[59:22] with me every step of the way say it
[59:24] again
[59:25] every step of the way that's his
[59:30] promis God sometimes you think the
[59:32] trials are heart and I'm not I'm not
[59:34] minimizing some of the trials some of
[59:36] you are going through because the
[59:38] pendulum swings this way and this
[59:42] way and sometimes you feel real secure
[59:44] about things secure about your job all
[59:47] your kids are at at the dining room
[59:49] table and eating dinner with you and
[59:51] your health is good and your boss says
[59:54] to you you'll always be you'll always
[59:56] have a job here
[59:58] buddy but all of a sudden the pendulum
[1:00:00] swings the other
[1:00:02] way and the doctor comes in and looks at
[1:00:05] you and pushes the file out and says I'm
[1:00:07] afraid we can't do anything
[1:00:09] else or you see a bunch of Chinese
[1:00:12] people walking around the
[1:00:15] plant you realize your job's not so
[1:00:18] secure
[1:00:23] anymore
[1:00:25] you'll pray differently in those valleys
[1:00:28] than you will you will on then you will
[1:00:30] on the mountaintops I'll guarantee
[1:00:32] you'll pray differently down here that's
[1:00:34] why God allows the down here sometimes
[1:00:37] you think trials are hard God ain't need
[1:00:39] no hurry you're the only one that's in a
[1:00:41] hurry we love results God loves the
[1:00:45] journey we love results God loves the
[1:00:49] process that process is very important
[1:00:52] you're the only one that's in a hurry he
[1:00:54] let Dani get right to the Lim's Den
[1:00:55] before he overcome just rise up and
[1:00:57] start walking by faith God I believe you
[1:00:59] I'm Bound for the promised land you
[1:01:01] promised it to me and I'm expecting that
[1:01:03] that's what Peter tells us to believe
[1:01:05] like in the last day have have
[1:01:07] anticipation have expectation on your
[1:01:10] mind in your heart because some of you
[1:01:12] have problems and you think they're as
[1:01:14] big as anything in the world look at the
[1:01:16] screen with me some of you think your
[1:01:18] problems are bigger than anything else
[1:01:20] they're big as the Earth and my goodness
[1:01:22] how am I over going to overcome I'm
[1:01:24] going to end with this but some of you
[1:01:26] think your problems are so big and I
[1:01:27] mean there's Ain't No Way ain't no
[1:01:29] solution to that but you know God
[1:01:31] created all of these didn't
[1:01:32] he let's just step out a little bit
[1:01:35] further from that and look at this
[1:01:36] screen here and realize that God also is
[1:01:39] bigger than the earth isn't
[1:01:41] he follow the Earth with me if you
[1:01:45] will because when we go
[1:01:48] further the Earth is just a pixel there
[1:01:51] that's the sun who hey who created the
[1:01:54] Sun
[1:01:55] same God right same God that created all
[1:01:58] of it and sometimes we think it's the
[1:02:00] biggest thing in the world our problems
[1:02:01] are the biggest thing in the world and
[1:02:02] in reality they're not can I go a little
[1:02:04] bit further here hey look here's the sun
[1:02:07] over here and these are some of the
[1:02:09] other planets that they know about that
[1:02:11] are in the universe there Arcturus well
[1:02:13] let's go a little bit farther look the
[1:02:15] sun is not even visible it's a pixel
[1:02:17] over here and you can't even see it it's
[1:02:19] over here under this little thing and
[1:02:21] and the Earth is long gone
[1:02:25] long gone in comparison to the God who
[1:02:27] created all of
[1:02:30] it brother brandom said father he said
[1:02:33] you're you're the Lord our strength a
[1:02:37] very present help in time of trouble and
[1:02:39] father May that arm of of a Believer May
[1:02:42] that one that that prays May that arm of
[1:02:44] Faith that'll go beyond this sin cursed
[1:02:47] World Reach Out beyond the moon and the
[1:02:49] stars until it touches His Garment way
[1:02:52] up yonder and May there come a voice
[1:02:55] from saying Heaven saying I am the Lord
[1:02:57] that Health thee and I'm Jehovah sh I'm
[1:03:00] a very present help in a time of trouble
[1:03:01] I'm here to help you let me tell you
[1:03:03] your faith can raise up it can reach
[1:03:05] farther than the the the circumstances
[1:03:07] of this world and the problems that you
[1:03:09] face your faith can reach beyond your
[1:03:12] hurt your faith can reach beyond your
[1:03:15] confusion your faith can reach beyond
[1:03:17] your solutions that you try to come up
[1:03:18] with to figure out how am I going to fix
[1:03:21] this and how am I going to work that and
[1:03:22] how am I going to supply for my family
[1:03:24] or whatever else your armor of faith can
[1:03:26] reach beyond all of that and touch the
[1:03:29] God who created it all amen and believe
[1:03:32] that let my friend believe that God is
[1:03:34] watching over you watching over this
[1:03:36] bride in the last day that uh that we're
[1:03:38] living in brother B said he gives us
[1:03:40] this advice commit your case to God and
[1:03:42] go on as if it was all over commit your
[1:03:44] case to God and go on as if it was all
[1:03:46] over don't build up the pressure let off
[1:03:48] pressure will you say I'm worried
[1:03:50] brother B he I just don't know let off
[1:03:52] the pressure and cast your cares upon
[1:03:54] him because he cares for you he said
[1:03:57] don't you worry about your cares that's
[1:04:00] his business when you give your cares to
[1:04:02] God in faith and in prayer they're his
[1:04:05] business now not yours and you go on as
[1:04:09] if that was not as if it was
[1:04:12] over because you know what God loves it
[1:04:15] when you thank him in the midst of a
[1:04:17] trial as opposed to thanking him when
[1:04:20] the answer is
[1:04:21] obvious when you begin to thank God in
[1:04:24] the valley when you begin to thank God
[1:04:26] before he does anything visible on your
[1:04:28] behalf he loves that I mean he loves
[1:04:32] that because he knows somehow you
[1:04:34] believe he's going to work this out you
[1:04:35] know he's going to fix this you know
[1:04:37] he's going to come to your Aid somehow
[1:04:39] even if you can't see it or feel it or
[1:04:41] nothing seems to be coming together when
[1:04:43] you're in the middle of that trial or in
[1:04:44] the slew of despondency and you're
[1:04:47] thanking God for his mercies and you're
[1:04:50] thanking God for his grace and you're
[1:04:52] thanking God for the solution amen God
[1:04:55] must love that even more than when he
[1:04:57] does something obvious and then you're
[1:04:59] saying I thank you Lord I knew you'd do
[1:05:01] it people of Faith are thanking God no
[1:05:04] matter what the circumstances are like
[1:05:06] because we're not governed by
[1:05:09] circumstance in the Harvest Time that's
[1:05:11] the kind of people God's looking for
[1:05:13] let's stand to our feet let's stop right
[1:05:16] there
