[0:03] Genesis chapter 1:es
[0:06] 27-31.
[0:08] I am so excited to preach this today
[0:12] that I got one hour of sleep. So if I
[0:16] fall asleep, I've got a good excuse.
[0:18] Uh if you fall asleep, I I have no
[0:21] excuse. Uh but I'm just so thrilled and
[0:25] I'm trusting we have the time to be able
[0:28] to adequately approach this and cover
[0:30] this
[0:32] and um may God just be with us. Let's
[0:34] just focus now in our hearts um on this
[0:38] Genesis 1:es 27-31. So God created man
[0:43] in his own image. In the image of God
[0:45] created he him. Male and female created
[0:48] he them. And God blessed them. And God
[0:51] said unto them, "Be fruitful, and
[0:53] multiply, and replenish the earth, and
[0:55] subdue it, and have dominion over the
[0:57] fish of the sea, and over the fowls of
[0:58] the air, and over every living thing
[1:00] that moveth upon the earth." And God
[1:02] said, "Behold, I have given you every
[1:05] herb bearing seed, which is upon the
[1:06] face of all the earth, and every tree in
[1:09] the which is the fruit of a tree
[1:11] yielding seed, tree yielding seed, to
[1:13] you it shall be for meat, and to every
[1:16] beast of the earth, and to every fowl of
[1:17] the air, and to every thing that
[1:18] creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
[1:20] is life. I have given every green herb
[1:23] for meat, and it was so." And God saw
[1:26] everything that he had made, and behold,
[1:29] it was very good. and the evening and
[1:32] the morning were the sixth day. God
[1:35] bless you. You may be seated.
[1:40] I'm continuing on the subject of God
[1:44] created and it's uh flowing forth from
[1:47] the subject we began when the church
[1:49] started on in the beginning. And we've
[1:52] kind of taken that phrase in Genesis 1:1
[1:54] and we've gone from in the beginning now
[1:55] to God created. In the beginning, God
[1:58] created. And one of our points that
[2:01] we've been emphasizing in this is you
[2:03] cannot read creation uh really any
[2:06] scripture for that matter. You cannot
[2:08] read it as merely a historical record of
[2:10] what God did. So like reading the
[2:12] newspaper what happened yesterday and uh
[2:14] reading an encyclopedia or reading a
[2:16] Wikipedia entry and and just reading
[2:19] something historical but rather when we
[2:22] read the creation the story of creation
[2:25] there's real there's substance to it.
[2:27] There's life to it. There's meaning to
[2:28] it. And it's more than just history.
[2:31] Brother Brandham says in falling a part
[2:33] of this world, but the one who created
[2:35] the heaven and the earth expresses
[2:37] himself back through his creation what
[2:39] he is in his program. Now this could be
[2:43] said of the creation at any time at any
[2:46] point in time but especially so in the
[2:49] beginning of the creation him being the
[2:51] author of it him being the designer him
[2:53] being the architect uh him being the
[2:55] artist he's reflected in his work his
[2:58] character his attributes his desire and
[3:00] brother Brham says the one who created
[3:02] the heaven and earth is expressing
[3:04] himself back through that creation so
[3:07] God would be invisible you could know
[3:09] him if you could understand his creation
[3:11] Amen.
[3:12] And it could be like a work of art that
[3:13] could be abstract and you look at it and
[3:15] you don't understand it and you're not
[3:16] quite sure what it means, but then the
[3:18] artist could reveal to you this is what
[3:20] that means or give you a little bit of
[3:21] their background, their background and
[3:23] all of a sudden something can begin to
[3:25] take shape and he says what he is in his
[3:28] program. So what we want to know is God
[3:32] and then also his purpose. We want to
[3:35] know God not just that there is a God.
[3:37] The Bible says that uh that God without
[3:40] faith it is impossible to please God. So
[3:42] he that cometh to him must first believe
[3:44] that he is and that he's a rewarder of
[3:47] them that diligently seek him. So it's
[3:49] not just believing that he is but also
[3:51] an understanding of his desire and
[3:53] understanding of his promises. So we
[3:55] ought to know what he is in his program.
[3:58] And understanding what began in Genesis
[4:01] chapter 1 and chapters 2 helps us
[4:05] understand what's happening now.
[4:08] And I I had when I originally began just
[4:11] to to put the scriptures together. I was
[4:13] hoping to get through uh Genesis chapter
[4:15] 1 and Genesis chapter 2 uh today, but we
[4:18] may not even be able to get through
[4:19] Genesis chapter 1. But I I want to focus
[4:22] on this. If you want to just kind of
[4:24] begin reading through it, Genesis
[4:25] chapter 1, Genesis chapter 2, Genesis
[4:28] chapter 3, that encompasses in the
[4:30] beginning. It encompasses a period of
[4:33] time in which God is laying down a
[4:35] pattern. And it's important for us, I
[4:37] believe it's important for us to
[4:38] understand what transpires in the first
[4:40] three books of the Bible so that we can
[4:43] understand what God is doing right now.
[4:45] Brother Brandham says in the power of
[4:47] transformation there was Adam and Eve
[4:49] walking in the garden of Eden every seed
[4:52] bringing forth. So he kind of brings us
[4:54] to the silence between Genesis chapter 2
[4:56] and Genesis chapter 3. Every seed is
[4:58] bringing forth. Everything is doing what
[5:00] God had ordained it to do. Something had
[5:02] been set into motion. Things are
[5:04] unfolding. And then he I'm skipping just
[5:06] a few phrases here to come to this. He
[5:08] says, "Oh, how I'd like to stop here for
[5:10] a moment to say there is where we are
[5:12] facing yet the completion of that word."
[5:17] So what is what what was set forth in
[5:20] Genesis chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2,
[5:22] we today are finishing that.
[5:24] Amen.
[5:25] And I that's remarkable. It's remarkable
[5:28] to see it in that light that we are
[5:30] completing and we are fulfilling God's
[5:32] original spoken word. that the seed that
[5:34] was sown is going to come to its
[5:36] perfection in this hour. And that's what
[5:38] we are fulfilling and that's what we're
[5:40] accomplishing. And to me, that is such a
[5:43] necessary connection to God that goes
[5:46] beyond this belief that we all are just
[5:48] born as sinners and that we are pleading
[5:52] to the cross that we might be forgiven
[5:54] of our sins so that God as an angry God
[5:57] would no longer be mad at us and then
[5:58] take us as orphans a and adopt us as
[6:02] children. And now really technically
[6:04] we're orphans, but he's adopted us and
[6:06] so now he's let us into the family and
[6:09] somehow this becomes our relationship to
[6:10] God. He's not mad at us anymore. No,
[6:13] that's not so for the elect.
[6:17] The the the elect have a connection with
[6:19] God in the beginning.
[6:21] And so we've we were looking at through
[6:23] several services and and this will be
[6:25] the only review that I'd like to give
[6:27] even though those points were reviewed.
[6:30] We're seeing God's plan of a bride at
[6:33] the beginning
[6:36] and then his plan to bring her forth at
[6:38] the end in perfection. You may not see
[6:41] her in perfection at the beginning, but
[6:43] she's there. She's represented. And so
[6:46] God's plan in the beginning, he hid
[6:48] something. He held something back, but
[6:49] he allowed shadows and foreshadowing and
[6:51] types and different glimpses. And so
[6:53] we're looking at God's plan for a bride
[6:55] in the beginning and how that he brings
[6:57] her forth in the end in perfection. And
[7:00] we also were highlighting that by
[7:02] showing the beast at the beginning, what
[7:04] his ambition was, what his desire was,
[7:06] and also uh the the the beast at the
[7:09] end. So we see the beast at the
[7:11] beginning, the beast at the end, the
[7:12] trail of the serpent, and how that when
[7:14] the when Satan was in the garden of
[7:16] Eden, who did he attack? He attacked the
[7:19] woman. He he he looked right to where
[7:21] the woman was because his ambition was
[7:23] to dethrone God, to overturn God's plan.
[7:26] He opposed the plan of God. So, he went
[7:28] straight to the woman and and I and we
[7:32] don't have it explicitly laid out to
[7:35] where the devil says, "I know it's
[7:37] through the woman." But we can see Satan
[7:39] has always probed and tried to guess.
[7:43] What did he do to Jesus? If thou be.
[7:45] So, it's the very same question that's
[7:47] asked of the woman because we're taught
[7:49] that the temptation of the woman in the
[7:51] garden is the same temptation of Christ
[7:53] in the wilderness. And so, we read it
[7:55] as, "Ah, yay. Have God said you can eat
[7:57] of every tree in the garden? But then
[7:59] when it comes to Christ is if thou be
[8:01] the son of God. So the the vein the
[8:04] emphasis the the the questioning had a
[8:07] similar line and he wanted to uncover
[8:08] the same information. Are you that tree
[8:11] that brings forth eternal life?
[8:14] Are you the one through which this
[8:15] kingdom is going to be reproduced? Are
[8:17] are you that tree? And so Satan was in
[8:20] the garden of Eden looking for the seed
[8:22] of power, looking for a seed of life.
[8:24] And this message exposes Satan in the
[8:27] beginning all the way to the end.
[8:29] Amen.
[8:29] Brother Random desired to preach the 12
[8:31] uh trail of the serpent. And he began to
[8:33] lay that trail out there in the end of
[8:35] his ministry even more distinctly and
[8:37] clearly. And in doing so, I believe it
[8:39] left to us a revelation to be able to
[8:41] see the wicked one be revealed, the
[8:44] wicked one exposed. We see him in the
[8:46] beginning and at the end because it's
[8:48] the bride that he's trying to dethrone.
[8:50] It's the bride he's trying to destroy.
[8:52] So, he was there in the beginning trying
[8:53] to find her and he's here in the end and
[8:56] he can't get to her.
[8:59] So, as we go forward in this, I want to
[9:01] take a comparison just to this is kind
[9:04] of just to get your your your script uh
[9:06] scriptural mind thinking and and
[9:09] pondering the Bible and and looking at
[9:12] the beginning and the end. And I want to
[9:14] take a comparison of the first three
[9:16] chapters of the Bible and the last three
[9:18] chapters of the Bible. So you have
[9:20] Genesis 1,
[9:22] you have Genesis uh chapters 1, 2, and
[9:25] 3. And and it begins in the beginning.
[9:28] And then you have Revelation chapter 21
[9:31] uh 22 and 23. And the Bible ends with
[9:34] amen. So I'm wanting to look at these
[9:37] parallels as these things go forth. In
[9:39] Genesis chapter 1 verse one says, God
[9:44] created the heavens and the earth. And
[9:46] so this is what comes up in the very
[9:48] beginning of the Bible. The first thing
[9:49] that's mentioned is in the beginning God
[9:51] created the heavens and the earth. And
[9:53] then Revelations 21:1 John sees the new
[9:56] heaven and the new earth.
[9:58] So now it's a a totally renovated and
[10:01] brought forth in perfection. It served
[10:03] its purpose. Now it's glorified because
[10:06] it's an original spoken word attribute
[10:07] of God. And we see it in the beginning
[10:09] and we see it maybe in a chaotic form
[10:11] immediately following this. But then in
[10:13] the end, John sees the new heavens and
[10:15] the new earth. In Genesis 1:16, it
[10:19] speaks of two great lights, a sun to
[10:21] rule the day and a moon to rule the
[10:23] night. And so we see this coming up and
[10:25] being described in detail in Genesis 1.
[10:28] In Revelations 21 24, the Bible says
[10:32] that the city had no need for the sun or
[10:34] the moon.
[10:35] Amen.
[10:36] So we see it come up in the beginning.
[10:38] It fulfills a purpose. It expresses
[10:39] something. But then in the end in
[10:41] Revelations 21, the city has no need for
[10:43] it because the lamb is the light
[10:45] thereof. Amen.
[10:46] In Genesis 1:5, God creates darkness and
[10:50] he calls it night. He separates out
[10:52] light and darkness and therefore you
[10:53] have night. And God establishes this in
[10:56] the beginning. But in Revelations 21 25,
[11:00] there shall be no night there.
[11:03] So you you you begin to see something
[11:05] that God lays things out in the
[11:08] beginning in a certain way to accomplish
[11:10] his purpose, but then in the end
[11:12] everything's found its perfect place.
[11:13] Amen.
[11:15] Not that it wasn't perfectly positioned
[11:16] then, but it was placed to fulfill a
[11:18] purpose. Used to fulfill a purpose.
[11:21] Recall that brother Brandham said
[11:23] because the woman was cast over to that
[11:25] side. She was placed in the garden and
[11:27] she was used for the fall because she
[11:29] was used for the fall. In the end, she
[11:31] has a sacred charge for redemption. So,
[11:34] you have a woman represented in the
[11:36] beginning, but in the end, she doesn't
[11:37] make the same heir as the first. The one
[11:40] in the end restores and redeems the one
[11:43] in the beginning.
[11:44] Paul said, "They without us could not be
[11:45] made perfect." There's a perfection that
[11:47] takes place that redeems the whole
[11:49] image.
[11:50] Amen.
[11:51] So he says, "And there shall be no night
[11:52] there." In Genesis 3:1, we see that the
[11:55] devil is in the garden. What is he doing
[11:57] there? He's trying to deceive. Wants to
[11:59] defile creation. In Revelations 20:10,
[12:02] the devil is cast into the lake of fire.
[12:05] Amen.
[12:06] We see him in Genesis 3. In Gen
[12:07] Revelations 20, he's going to be no
[12:09] more. Genesis 3:16
[12:13] is where sorrow is born. Speaking to the
[12:15] woman, in sorrow thou shalt conceive and
[12:17] bring forth children. It's the first
[12:19] time that sorrow is brought into view.
[12:21] Revelations 21:4, it says there should
[12:23] be no more sorrow.
[12:24] Amen.
[12:26] Notice what's happening. What's in the
[12:28] beginning, what's happening in Genesis
[12:30] 3:17, there's a curse upon the creation.
[12:34] There's a curse even upon uh the
[12:36] serpent. There's a curse upon creation.
[12:37] But in Revelations 22:3, it specifically
[12:40] says there shall be no more curse.
[12:44] So Genesis chapter 1, Genesis chapter 2,
[12:46] Genesis chapter 3, it's like God is
[12:48] setting up his bowling pins.
[12:49] Yeah.
[12:50] Right. He's setting up the targets. He's
[12:52] taking aim. He says, "These are the
[12:53] things I'm going to deal with."
[12:55] Hallelujah.
[12:56] These are the things I'm going to show
[12:57] you that we've got I got power over. I
[13:00] these are the things that are going to
[13:01] come. These are the things are going to
[13:02] be, but in the end, they shall be no
[13:03] more. There shall be no more night
[13:04] there. The devil is cast in a lake of
[13:06] fire. There shall be no more sorrow.
[13:07] There should be no more curse. Also in
[13:09] Genesis chapter 3, just kind of
[13:11] summarizing it. What does the devil do?
[13:12] He comes in speaking lies through the
[13:14] lie. It brings sin. Corruption enters.
[13:17] Defilement enters into creation. But in
[13:19] Revelations 21 27, there's there shall
[13:23] no lie, no abomination, no defilement
[13:25] enter into that city.
[13:29] Because this is what John is describing
[13:30] in Revelations 21. He saw that the city
[13:33] descending out of heaven from God
[13:36] adorned as a bride for her husband. And
[13:39] although lies and sin and defilement
[13:41] enter in Genesis chapter 3, but in
[13:43] Revelations chapter 21, it says, "In
[13:45] that city, no liar, no abomination, no
[13:48] defilement shall enter there into the
[13:50] city." Genesis chapter 3, we see that
[13:53] death enters. We know death was
[13:55] conceived even spiritually and that God
[13:59] said uh that he had prophesied it the
[14:01] day you partake that day you'll die and
[14:03] we see we know that death entered in and
[14:05] we'll get into this in greater detail uh
[14:07] in the future that that when that the
[14:11] skins were made death has entered the
[14:13] first thing has died and so Genesis
[14:16] chapter 3 death enters Revelations 21:4
[14:19] there shall be no more death
[14:23] so you see the beginning of things, but
[14:25] then you see the end of things,
[14:27] the summation, the completion. In
[14:29] Genesis 3, 24 speaks of how that mankind
[14:32] is kept from the tree of life. He's
[14:34] barred from it. He He has no access to
[14:37] it.
[14:38] But in Revelations 22 verse two, the
[14:41] tree of life is in the midst of the
[14:42] city.
[14:44] It's restored back to mankind.
[14:45] Amen.
[14:47] And it says even in verse 14, they shall
[14:48] have a right to the tree of life.
[14:51] What is it that's represented there?
[14:53] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[14:55] He brings forth a bride which will be
[14:57] the tree of life restored back to him,
[15:00] husband and wife in the garden of Eden.
[15:04] And in Revelations 21 9 and 10,
[15:08] notice notice what it says here. And
[15:10] there came unto me one of the seven
[15:12] angels which had the seven vials full of
[15:14] the seven last plagues, and talked with
[15:15] me, saying, Come hither, I'll show thee
[15:17] the bride, the lamb's wife. And he
[15:20] carried me away in the spirit to a great
[15:22] and high mountain and showed me that
[15:24] great city, the holy Jerusalem,
[15:27] descending out of heaven from God. This
[15:30] is the climax of creation.
[15:33] Th this is now this is we're reading the
[15:35] last,
[15:36] right?
[15:37] In the beginning, God Genesis chapter 1,
[15:39] Genesis chapter 2, Genesis chapter 3.
[15:41] But now we're seeing God's program
[15:42] satisfied.
[15:44] Now we're reading in the end. And in the
[15:46] end, God is actually, if we could just
[15:48] use this phrase that may be familiar,
[15:50] but I'm not making it equal to that. But
[15:52] God is tying up a loose end
[15:54] or he's connecting dots. That might be a
[15:56] better way of saying it. He's saying,
[15:57] "In the beginning, there was death.
[15:58] Here, there'll be no death. In the
[16:00] beginning, there was sorrow that came.
[16:02] There'll be no sorrow. In the beginning,
[16:03] there was the devil. In the end, he's
[16:05] destroyed. In the beginning, the tree of
[16:06] life was hid from man. In the end, it's
[16:08] restored back." And notice everything
[16:10] that's being described is something that
[16:12] has to do with the city.
[16:14] And who is the city? you.
[16:16] So, you were represented. It's a Oh my
[16:18] goodness. It's in the beginning. He went
[16:20] ahead and set up all your challenges,
[16:22] all your enemies, all your weaknesses,
[16:25] everything that would come against you
[16:26] and attack you. And he set it up in the
[16:28] beginning and said, "I'm going to
[16:29] destroy these so that in the end you're
[16:31] perfect and free from them."
[16:34] He laid them all out ahead of time,
[16:36] protecting you, shielding you, hiding
[16:38] you from the beginning.
[16:40] And in the climax of creation, we see
[16:42] this parallel. Genesis 1 and Revelations
[16:44] 21, Genesis 1 and Revelations 22 and
[16:47] Genesis 3 and Revelations 22. And we see
[16:50] 20, 21, and 22 all coming to deal with
[16:54] in the beginning of God's creation.
[16:58] Now, I want to drop back if you just
[17:02] turn in the very beginning of your
[17:04] Bible. And I want to drop back now. And
[17:06] if a lot of maybe what we'll share
[17:08] today, you can say, "Well, we've we've
[17:09] kind of hit some of these points." But I
[17:11] just felt so overwhelmed to just take
[17:13] the time to go verse by verse through
[17:16] the first chapter of the Bible. I'd like
[17:18] to do the same with the second chapter.
[17:20] I'd like to do the same with the third
[17:21] chapter. It is it is so important to our
[17:26] understanding of even salvation.
[17:29] Right?
[17:29] Do we truly understand Christ if we
[17:33] don't understand the original sin?
[17:34] Right?
[17:35] Do we truly understand Calvary? If we
[17:39] don't understand the need for an
[17:40] atonement and even connecting it back to
[17:42] the promises in the being, do we even
[17:44] understand ourselves
[17:46] then?
[17:47] So there's so it's so important and I
[17:49] want to drop back to Genesis chapter 1
[17:51] and start with verse one.
[17:54] And I want to go through the scripture
[17:55] with an understanding of two things and
[17:57] we've emphasized these through the first
[17:59] these first nine services on this
[18:00] subject. First, remember God's unfolding
[18:04] a mystery.
[18:06] Every detail has significance. Every
[18:08] verse has meaning. It all serves a
[18:12] purpose.
[18:14] And that's in God's part. We're seeing
[18:15] God's heart unfold. We're seeing God,
[18:17] the architect, the designer, the
[18:19] creator, expressing him now in the way
[18:21] he sets things and establish things. And
[18:23] he he's revealing to you something about
[18:24] his character, what he likes.
[18:27] If you were if you were at a at a a
[18:29] buffet, I don't know if we still have
[18:30] those anymore, uh, but if you're at a
[18:33] buffet and uh, and I don't really prefer
[18:36] those, but if you went to one and
[18:38] someone said, uh, I'll go I I'll get you
[18:40] a plate for you. They'd go up there and
[18:42] they just get a bunch of stuff and then
[18:44] you could give it to them and you could
[18:45] probably discern what they would like by
[18:47] what they pick at, what they try and
[18:48] everything that's finished. But if you
[18:50] really wanted to know what they liked,
[18:52] you would watch them go to the buffet
[18:55] and pick out what they want
[18:57] and create their plate. You're like,
[18:58] "Okay, I know they like this. I know
[19:00] they like that." And so what someone
[19:02] chooses, how someone does something,
[19:04] that's the way that they like it done.
[19:05] It expresses something about their
[19:06] character. God's the same way in this
[19:08] creation. When he does something a
[19:10] particular way, we could say, "Well,
[19:11] why? Why did he do that?" We may never
[19:13] know the why, but what's important is
[19:15] that's how he does it.
[19:17] Yes.
[19:18] how he does it is is important. Even if
[19:20] we can't understand the why, if it's the
[19:22] way God does it, that's the way we do
[19:24] it.
[19:25] You could you could very easily say,
[19:26] well, why do we have to be baptized in
[19:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? And
[19:31] we could provide a theological argument,
[19:33] give a scriptural basis for it. We could
[19:35] even give a lot of different examples
[19:37] just in the word of God to support why
[19:39] it's done that way. But if you want to
[19:41] come down to why God has made it an
[19:43] actual physical commandment,
[19:45] it's his prerogative.
[19:47] Amen. Yeah.
[19:48] And we can see the wisdom in it how that
[19:49] would it would be an outward sign to
[19:52] show that someone has truly understood
[19:54] that their sins have been remitted. And
[19:56] so it's like a litmus test. It's a it's
[19:58] an out it's a confession to others. And
[20:00] you realize by them being willing to
[20:01] take the name of Jesus Christ in water
[20:03] baptism by immersion a after the
[20:05] repentance of sin believing for the seal
[20:07] of God which is the baptism of the Holy
[20:09] Ghost which is the new birth. Then
[20:11] that's that's the way God has
[20:12] established it. We may never understand
[20:14] completely the why, but we know that's
[20:16] the his that's the what and the how he
[20:18] wants.
[20:20] And the second part that we want to be
[20:23] very to consider as we read through this
[20:26] is Satan's ambition.
[20:28] How that Satan was now as God's plan
[20:30] begins to unfold, Satan is very eager to
[20:32] disrupt it. And so he stands by at the
[20:36] ready to interrupt, to inject himself.
[20:39] In the parable of the sewer, the son of
[20:41] man goes forth seowing seed and then
[20:43] what does the wicked one do? He comes
[20:45] behind it seowing tears. And so had this
[20:48] had the son of man not swed first. He
[20:50] would have been waiting.
[20:52] He was waiting. He's he's always there.
[20:54] He's going to come next. He's going to
[20:55] come after. He's going to be the one
[20:57] that's going to come follow the word to
[20:59] do something to try to undermine the
[21:00] word to try to do something to hinder
[21:02] it. And so remember Satan had an
[21:04] ambition that is expressed even in
[21:06] Ezekiel and Isaiah how they had this
[21:08] desire. His desire was towards creating,
[21:11] procreating in life. He wanted that
[21:13] power because he was it was withheld
[21:15] from him in the beginning. And so
[21:17] remember, Satan has an ambition. So as
[21:20] these things are being laid out, Satan's
[21:22] watching.
[21:24] And so God is setting up his pieces.
[21:28] It's like the original Strateggo.
[21:31] And and Satan thinks he's figured it
[21:33] out. Oh, I know exactly what he's doing.
[21:35] But God is doing it all as a trap.
[21:38] Because it says in church age book
[21:41] chapter 3, it says, "Thus what God
[21:43] worked out here in the garden was his
[21:45] predestinated plan."
[21:47] And when Satan had brought about that
[21:49] which was necessary to the purpose of
[21:51] God, and it's a fragment, but I just
[21:53] want to catch this principle. Though
[21:54] it's a fragment, it's a principle that
[21:56] remains. Satan brought about that which
[21:58] was necessary for the purpose of God. So
[22:00] there's Satan acting to bring out God's
[22:04] purpose, interacting with the pieces,
[22:06] interacting with the scene, uh uh uh
[22:09] doing things to bring certain things out
[22:11] because in the end we read sorrow,
[22:13] defilement, abomination, lies, death,
[22:16] all those things are no more. They've
[22:18] been dealt with. And when they're no
[22:21] more, there is no seed by which they can
[22:25] ever be revived.
[22:26] Amen.
[22:27] And so God allows Satan to give life to
[22:31] those things. Did not God say, "I I the
[22:34] Lord create evil." Wait, he used it now
[22:37] to express his attribute. It's part of
[22:38] his great plan and program. So it says,
[22:40] "Thus what God worked out in the out
[22:41] here in the garden." What God allowed to
[22:44] happen in the garden is his
[22:45] predestinated plan. So there's a
[22:47] predestinated plan being laid out which
[22:50] holds a mystery. Holds a mystery of
[22:52] redemption. Holds a mystery of election
[22:54] and predestination. And Satan's right in
[22:56] there thinking he's messing it up, only
[22:58] allowing it to unfold to meet God's
[23:00] purpose.
[23:01] So now, Genesis chapter 1 verse one, and
[23:04] we'll see how long it takes for us to go
[23:06] through one chapter in the Bible. In
[23:09] Genesis 1 verse one, in the beginning,
[23:12] God created the heaven and the earth. We
[23:15] looked at this in great detail through a
[23:16] few services how God in the very
[23:18] beginning draws the image of the
[23:21] heavenly groom and the earthly bride and
[23:24] that there's something being expressed
[23:26] now in the word later in type with
[23:28] Christ and the Holy Spirit and heaven
[23:31] earth embracing and kissing and us being
[23:33] united with him. And they're laid out in
[23:35] the beginning and it shows in the very
[23:37] beginning the two things that are going
[23:39] to come together as the climax of
[23:40] creation. The the the groom and the
[23:43] bride. We know also in John 1:1 it says
[23:46] in the beginning was the word and the
[23:49] word was with God and the word was God.
[23:51] So in the beginning God who is the word.
[23:54] God is the word in the beginning. So in
[23:56] the beginning was the word in the
[23:58] beginning this word God created the
[24:00] heaven and the earth. Brother Brandham
[24:02] says in Christ is the mystery of God
[24:04] revealed. He is speaking of Christ the
[24:06] principal theme of the entire Bible. If
[24:09] you read the Bible and don't see Christ
[24:11] in every verse of it, go back and read
[24:13] it again.
[24:15] If you can't see Christ in every verse
[24:17] of the Bible, then you read it again
[24:19] because you've missed something.
[24:21] The Bible is Christ. He is the word.
[24:24] When you read in the beginning, God
[24:27] created there is Christ.
[24:30] And he says from that to the amen in
[24:32] Revelations is every word testifying of
[24:36] Jesus Christ.
[24:38] Now, I I I don't know if I'm just
[24:40] showing how poor of a planner I am, but
[24:43] I I didn't even notice the parallel to
[24:46] the slide. How it says in the beginning
[24:48] and the amen
[24:50] to this very statement here. See, it's
[24:51] God that has control of this.
[24:53] If anybody brags about their gift, then
[24:55] you question the gift because it's not
[24:56] theirs.
[24:58] It's yours. You can brag on it. Not
[25:00] mine. It's for you. But this is just how
[25:02] God lays these things out. So, you can
[25:04] see the parallel, the continuity. Here
[25:06] brother Brandham is saying there's
[25:07] Christ in the beginning there's Christ
[25:09] from that in the beginning to the amen
[25:12] in revelations every word is testifying
[25:15] of Jesus Christ. Now your relationship
[25:18] to Jesus Christ is not as an orphan or
[25:21] separate but you are embodied in that
[25:23] Christ. So there's a testimony that is
[25:26] of benefit to you.
[25:27] Yes
[25:29] there it will glorify Christ and edify
[25:31] you. There's something to be gained from
[25:33] scripture. So, as we read each one of
[25:35] these verses, we're not just reading
[25:36] them so that we can go back and and pull
[25:38] out our Bible uh planning app that we we
[25:42] read the whole Bible in the year and I
[25:43] can go in there and check the box that
[25:44] says Genesis 1 and like I've only got
[25:46] several thousand to go. But, uh we're
[25:48] doing it because there's something to be
[25:50] gained from it. Genesis 1:2, "And the
[25:53] earth was without form and void, and
[25:56] darkness was upon the face of the deep,
[25:58] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[26:00] face of the waters." As we read through
[26:02] this, I'm going to stop to to bring in
[26:05] certain details or elements. And I
[26:08] thought of it this morning since I
[26:10] wasn't sleeping. And uh and I just
[26:12] thought of how my mind just kept going
[26:14] to these verses over and over and over
[26:15] again. I thought my it's what I'm doing
[26:17] is I'm just taking a stone and I'm just
[26:20] skipping it across the water and it's
[26:22] just going to skip 31 times. It's not
[26:24] even to get deep into it. It's just
[26:26] skipping across the surface. But I want
[26:28] to do just a few skips just to touch on
[26:30] a few things. And as we look at this, it
[26:32] says the earth, it now begins to
[26:34] describe the earth. You have the heavens
[26:36] and the earth. And it may have existed
[26:38] in some harmonious state. But then now
[26:41] this is the chaotic earth that God wants
[26:43] to describe. The earth was without form
[26:45] and void and darkness was upon the face
[26:47] of the deep. And so this chaotic uh
[26:49] earth we looked at in the very first
[26:51] service we preached here when this
[26:53] church was birthed. Arizona's believer's
[26:55] church. We preached in the beginning and
[26:56] we took Genesis chapter 1 and uh verses
[26:59] 1 and two and we identified ourselves
[27:02] with verse two.
[27:04] Amen.
[27:04] We realize I I can relate to chaos.
[27:07] I can relate to vanity. I can relate to
[27:09] nothing. And God wants us to even
[27:11] recognize that he brought your first ver
[27:14] your first birth into view. Born in sin,
[27:17] born with the fallen flesh, born with
[27:18] the fallen nature, he brings your first
[27:20] birth into view. He brings it right
[27:22] there into chaos, showing you that what
[27:24] he wants to do is he wants his spirit,
[27:26] which is the word, to move upon your
[27:28] chaos.
[27:30] He He uses this as the first image. So
[27:32] that this is the first way that we can
[27:34] begin to relate to God. That he's
[27:36] interested in your disorder. He's
[27:38] interested in your confusion. He's
[27:40] interested in your uh lack of feeling
[27:42] like you belong in your hurts and your
[27:44] pains. And he doesn't just meet it with
[27:45] this brute force, but in love and
[27:47] compassion. He begins to brood over your
[27:49] hurts, brood over your aches, brood over
[27:51] your brokenness. Why? With the spirit
[27:53] which is the word to bring harmony and
[27:55] order.
[27:56] Amen.
[27:57] I thank God
[27:58] that he places that in there.
[28:01] And the spirit which is the word,
[28:02] brother Brandham says, and spoken word
[28:03] is the original seed. Now, if you want
[28:06] to if you want to take a more upper
[28:08] level course on this, you could listen
[28:10] to spoken words of the original seed or
[28:12] study through it, read it, read it uh
[28:14] because it parallels so well with what
[28:16] we're reading here in Genesis chapter 1,
[28:17] 2, and 3.
[28:19] And he says, "Now this word of God is
[28:21] eternal. God being infinite cannot speak
[28:24] one thing and then later on change it to
[28:26] something else to a better decision."
[28:29] Right?
[28:32] He says, "Because every decision of God
[28:35] is perfect." Now, who's the judge of
[28:38] that?
[28:40] I ain't.
[28:41] Right?
[28:43] If you want to know what justice is in
[28:45] truth, whatever God says is true,
[28:47] whatever God does is justice.
[28:49] He is not subject to our standards of
[28:52] justice. When we say that's unfair,
[28:55] we're using some metric
[28:57] that we've come up with as humans
[28:59] to determine and arbitrate fairness,
[29:01] right?
[29:02] To and I've used this example before how
[29:05] that in a in a free market economy to a
[29:08] seller a fair price is a high price
[29:11] to a buyer a fair price is a low price.
[29:14] But the price that they meet at and be
[29:17] willing to transact at would be fair
[29:19] market value. When we try somebody with
[29:22] a a crime or we have a civil case to be
[29:24] adjudicated and decided, we bring a jury
[29:27] of peers and we believe that if we could
[29:29] get people who do not have skin in the
[29:31] game or a vested outcome or some vested
[29:34] interest in the outcome and nothing to
[29:36] do with the parties that 12 people or
[29:38] six people, the decision that they come
[29:40] to is justice. We have a judge who may
[29:44] arbitrate something, decide something.
[29:46] And we use these standards in order to
[29:48] come up with some way for us in the end
[29:50] to say it was fair.
[29:52] Even if you feel that you were wronged
[29:54] in the process, we had to come up with
[29:56] over thousands of years ways to
[29:58] determine justice. But when it comes to
[30:00] God, he's not subject to a jury. He's
[30:03] not subject to a judge. He's not subject
[30:05] to fair market value. God establishes
[30:08] value on his own.
[30:09] Amen. Whatever he says is worth 10,000
[30:12] worlds, it's worth 10,000 worlds.
[30:14] Whatever he says is beautiful, it's
[30:15] beautiful. Whatever he says is great.
[30:17] Whatever he says is nonsense is
[30:18] nonsense. That's God's justice.
[30:23] It's wonderful.
[30:25] So he says God's decision is perfect.
[30:28] Once his word is once spoken,
[30:31] it can never die.
[30:33] Amen.
[30:34] It lives on and on and can never die
[30:37] because it is God. So remember, how can
[30:40] we be facing the completion of that
[30:42] word?
[30:44] Didn't that word just disseminate into
[30:47] the void? Hasn't it just broken up and
[30:50] lost its its waves? It's it's gone now,
[30:53] isn't it? No. If God has ever spoken
[30:56] something, it's alive.
[31:00] His word can never die. His word can no
[31:02] more die than he can die. That's the
[31:04] reason we we read in St. John chapter 1,
[31:08] the first chapter. In the beginning was
[31:10] the word and the word was with God and
[31:12] the word was God and the word was made
[31:14] flesh.
[31:17] The same word that was spoke in the
[31:19] beginning with his eternal purpose came
[31:23] on over and was made flesh and dwelt
[31:25] among us. God's word.
[31:28] So there was a word
[31:31] spoken in the beginning. And if you take
[31:33] notes, this is a good place spot to take
[31:35] a note and say there's a word spoken in
[31:37] the beginning that was made flesh and
[31:40] dwelt among us. Something that God said
[31:43] in the beginning that never died. Now
[31:45] you say, well, was it when he said uh
[31:47] let each uh uh let the cattle come
[31:50] forth? Was that the word that was made
[31:51] flesh? No. There's a word that pertained
[31:54] to Christ. There was something that was
[31:55] spoken that could never die and it came
[31:57] over and was made flesh. It's God's
[31:59] word. In the beginning was the word. Now
[32:02] as we get to verse three,
[32:05] from verse three to verse 31, creation
[32:07] is described over the course of six
[32:09] days. And uh that's I haven't revealed
[32:12] any mystery there. So don't quickly jot
[32:14] that down as if this is something I've
[32:15] just figured out. Uh even if it was
[32:18] something I just figured out. I'm sure
[32:19] you all knew that. But creation is
[32:21] described over the course of six days.
[32:23] And there's different ways that schools
[32:25] of theology and commentators have looked
[32:27] at this. There's no question that God is
[32:30] dividing time. There's some interval to
[32:32] this and that there's an evening and a
[32:35] morning and there's distinct junctures
[32:36] that identify some specific interval.
[32:39] But we recognize the day to be a 24-hour
[32:42] period. And if we just use that kind of
[32:44] loosely to describe some definite space
[32:47] of time, we we couldn't read this
[32:50] logically and it just be an indefinite
[32:52] period of time. In day one being an
[32:54] indefinite period of time and day two
[32:55] being an indefinite period of time
[32:56] because there'd be so much overlapping,
[32:58] it really wouldn't make much sense in
[33:00] the end. But the Bible says in second
[33:02] Peter 3:8, "But beloved, be not ignorant
[33:05] of this one thing." If the scripture
[33:07] says that then not only is it relevant
[33:09] in the context but it's probably
[33:11] something that we should hold on to to
[33:12] understand other things. So he says that
[33:14] one day is with the Lord as a thousand
[33:17] years and a thousand years as one day.
[33:20] So this is a very unique perspective
[33:22] that you could have one day with the
[33:24] Lord. So in the beginning there was six
[33:26] days of creation. So you could have one
[33:28] day with the Lord is as a thousand
[33:30] years. But then in the reverse a
[33:32] thousand years is one day.
[33:36] And and it's just it it it refers to the
[33:38] fact that this this interval, this time
[33:41] can be represented though it be a day,
[33:43] it could signify a thousand years.
[33:44] Though it might be referred to as a
[33:46] 24-hour period, it's actually in reality
[33:49] or in time a thousand years. And that's
[33:52] why this is and I I don't like uh uh
[33:56] just offering my opinion. So I don't
[33:59] know if I'm telling myself to stop
[34:02] at this point. You know, I actually tell
[34:03] myself no opinions. Yeah. And I I'll
[34:05] write it down. No opinions. Keep your
[34:07] opinions out of this. My opinions have
[34:09] no place. So, this is an opinion. This
[34:11] is a thought.
[34:14] Uh that when it comes to the millennium,
[34:16] man, we got a lot of things we talk
[34:18] about when it comes to the millennium.
[34:19] Could it be this way? Could it be that
[34:20] way? Could it be this way? It's a
[34:21] thousand years,
[34:23] but who knows if it just doesn't feel
[34:24] like a day to you,
[34:26] right? You're going to be in a glorified
[34:28] body, fully redeemed, nothing added to
[34:30] you for redemption. Here, fully
[34:31] glorified body. You are absolutely and
[34:34] completely an eternal being
[34:37] fully perfected
[34:39] and yet somehow interacting in in a
[34:42] thousand year thousand years of time on
[34:44] earth and it could be like what time is
[34:47] it? It's thousand years like man that
[34:48] went by fast,
[34:50] right?
[34:51] So it it even speaks to how the eternal
[34:54] relates to time. Doesn't relate it to it
[34:56] the same way that we would. So now the
[34:59] the the message of the hour gives
[35:02] validity to and establishes that the day
[35:04] was a thousand years.
[35:06] So though it may be in a 24-hour
[35:08] interval to a creature of time, what is
[35:11] unfolding would be a thousand years. And
[35:15] brother Brandham says this in power of
[35:16] transformation and this would be another
[35:18] sermon that you could go back and listen
[35:20] to along with spoken words of the
[35:21] original seed and see these parallels
[35:23] just perfectly lining up. He says 6,000
[35:25] years God took to make this. And we see
[35:27] in Genesis 1 yet now we see that in this
[35:31] and I'm I'm taking my time on these
[35:34] things to to establish something and
[35:36] this is a very important critical part
[35:38] here. We see that in this in what the
[35:42] 6,000 years God had an objective that he
[35:45] wanted to bring to pass.
[35:47] So, do you can you just let that like
[35:50] lock in on that
[35:52] and try to get beyond just the wording
[35:55] and catch the thought behind it, the
[35:56] logos behind it that God allowed
[36:00] creation to come to pass over 6,000
[36:03] years. And he had an objective in not
[36:07] only bringing creation to pass, but in
[36:09] how he did it and how long he took.
[36:13] God was not just well we'll see when we
[36:15] finish and whatever we get done in 6,000
[36:17] years we'll just leave it that way. God
[36:19] was very purposeful, very diligent, very
[36:22] deliberate and how things were
[36:24] established and arranged. And watch this
[36:25] as we begin to read. You'll see that
[36:26] God's very specific, very particular.
[36:29] And so God is going to reflect his
[36:31] objective in creation. You'll see that
[36:33] God had an objective that he wanted to
[36:35] bring to pass. So he's going to reflect
[36:37] his objective in creation. And then he's
[36:39] going to utilize every part of this
[36:41] creation for the purpose for a purpose
[36:44] in his program. Every part, even the
[36:47] duration,
[36:49] there's meaning to it. In Hebrews
[36:51] chapter 8:5, I want to use this just to
[36:53] emphasize how that God has lays a
[36:55] pattern and signifies something so that
[36:57] it must be followed. He said, he's
[36:59] speaking of the priesthood. He says,
[37:01] "Who serve unto the example and shadow
[37:03] of heavenly things." So here's offices
[37:06] on earth, priests on earth who are
[37:08] actually serving an example of something
[37:10] supernatural in heavenly and a shadow of
[37:13] heavenly things. So what a priest does
[37:14] on earth, he's reflecting something
[37:16] that's already been manifested in
[37:18] heaven. As Moses was admonished of God
[37:21] when he was about to make the
[37:22] tabernacle, foresee saith he, God saying
[37:26] that thou make all things according to
[37:28] the pattern showed to thee in the mount.
[37:35] So there is a pattern that is first
[37:38] expressed and then when there's a
[37:41] manifestation
[37:42] of the pattern or when there's a
[37:44] manifestation, it's got to follow the
[37:45] pattern. That's right.
[37:47] Now, Moses is the one that wrote Genesis
[37:50] 1, 2, 3. He's the one that wrote the
[37:51] Pinto. He's the one that writes the
[37:53] first five books of the Bible by
[37:54] supernatural inspiration by the breath
[37:56] of God. So, Moses, when he would write,
[38:00] God would breathe these things. And
[38:02] Moses himself was put in a position
[38:05] where God showed him something and then
[38:08] built it according to the pattern. So
[38:10] when God had Moses build and create
[38:12] something, he was first given a pattern
[38:15] and the completion or the perfection of
[38:17] the tabernacle was fit fit the blueprint
[38:20] of what was already showed to him. So
[38:23] this shows God's nature and I use these
[38:25] scriptures because I want you to begin
[38:27] to identify that God's nature then is to
[38:30] establish a pattern first.
[38:33] So when we're reading Genesis chapter 1,
[38:35] we can't read it in a way that and I I
[38:39] want to be so respectful because I have
[38:41] so much reverence for this word. It's
[38:42] perfect. Amen.
[38:44] I and I have so much reverence for the
[38:46] message of the hour which is has has
[38:48] brought to us made this Bible a new book
[38:52] that that we have I want we should be
[38:54] careful to not misplace the truth that
[38:58] when we understand that we're going back
[39:00] to the garden or we understand that
[39:02] there was perfection in the garden. We
[39:04] understand that God laid out a perfect
[39:05] Eden. All that was perfect perfect
[39:07] understanding of love of God. There's no
[39:08] death there. There's no s there. But God
[39:10] when he did that was representing
[39:13] something or laying a pattern.
[39:17] We understand just by virtue of the fact
[39:19] that we're all here fully clothed
[39:23] eating meat like steak, red meat. If you
[39:26] ever overhear me say I smoke, I'm
[39:28] referring to meat.
[39:31] But we So we realize now that we're
[39:33] obviously not living according to what
[39:35] was there in the garden. And so God knew
[39:38] this wouldn't be the climax,
[39:40] right?
[39:41] He set it forth as a pattern.
[39:43] And even as the Bible says, as we read
[39:45] these next six days, God even uses the
[39:48] six days as a pattern. In Exodus 20:es 9
[39:51] to 11, six days shalt thou labor. Okay?
[39:54] So now God's given the law to man. They
[39:56] have six days to work and do all thy
[39:58] work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath
[40:01] of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt
[40:04] not do any work. thou, nor thy son, nor
[40:07] thy daughter, thy man's servant, nor thy
[40:10] maidervant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
[40:12] stranger that is within thy gate. So you
[40:14] couldn't get the gentile to do your
[40:16] bidding for you either on the on the
[40:17] Sabbath.
[40:19] So he's telling the people, "Rest on the
[40:21] seventh day. You have six days to work.
[40:25] You, your son, your daughter, your
[40:26] manservant, maid servant, cattle,
[40:27] stranger, whoever it is, you got six
[40:29] days to work." And notice verse 11. For
[40:32] in six days the Lord made the heaven
[40:34] made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
[40:37] that is in them is and rested the
[40:39] seventh day.
[40:41] Now look at how that God set forth a
[40:43] pattern in Genesis 1 and two or Genesis
[40:46] 1. And now he revives it in Exodus
[40:49] chapter 20 and says, I only want you to
[40:51] work six days and rest on the seventh.
[40:53] For God, the Lord made the heaven, the
[40:55] earth, the sea, and all that is in them.
[40:56] And then he rested on the seventh.
[40:58] Therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath
[41:00] day and hollowed it. So when God did
[41:03] this, he had a deliberate purpose. And
[41:06] he actually set a foundation or a
[41:08] pattern that would be later followed.
[41:11] So was it arbitrary? No. God was setting
[41:14] forth a pattern. If we could look at it
[41:16] this way, this was a precedent.
[41:19] God is showing forth the precedent. And
[41:21] then even we realize for us that there's
[41:23] a that there's a Sabbath for us. So God
[41:25] is laying this precedent down of labor,
[41:28] work and work and labor. But then there
[41:29] being a day of rest and it was six days
[41:32] of labor, which would be the number of
[41:33] man. Seventh day, which represents
[41:35] completion, is a day of rest. And
[41:37] there's a shadow or a foreshadowing.
[41:41] I'm going to create the earth in six
[41:42] days. Then after six days, I'm going to
[41:44] rest. What did he foreshadow? That
[41:46] Israel would have a Sabbath day. So it's
[41:49] also a type. There's a shadow and a
[41:50] type. Is it the full and some substance
[41:52] and the whole of everything?
[41:54] Historically, 6 days to create the
[41:55] earth. Okay. Yeah, we get it. 24 hours
[41:57] is a thousand years. So, 6,000 years God
[41:59] created the earth. All right, let's move
[42:00] on. No, there's something being spoke in
[42:01] it. And notice what brother Brandham
[42:03] says. I'm going to read from three
[42:04] places. It might be uh it might be
[42:07] overkill, but I really want to make my
[42:09] case. He says, "Satan's eaten. He's made
[42:12] another Garden of Eden, and 6,000 years
[42:15] it's taken him to make it." Just like
[42:18] God did at the beginning, God made his
[42:21] Eden in 6,000 years. That's me adding
[42:24] that. And Satan corrupted it. Now,
[42:27] Satan's made his own Eden, and God's
[42:29] going to destroy it.
[42:31] I like how God could just uh one up
[42:33] Satan.
[42:34] Oh, Satan, isn't that nice? You
[42:36] corrupted it. Well, guess what I'm going
[42:36] to do to yours? It's not even exist
[42:38] anymore.
[42:39] That's why we know there's no eternal
[42:41] hell. It says, "You shall consider his
[42:42] place and it shall not be."
[42:45] It won't even be anymore. it won't even
[42:47] exist. So God isn't just going to merely
[42:49] uh corrupt uh the devil's abode and
[42:52] corrupt the devil's existence. He's not
[42:53] going to have one anymore. And power of
[42:55] transformation. Again, I read from this
[42:57] several times uh this morning. He'll say
[43:00] again later. And as God took 6,000
[43:02] years, which the original with the
[43:04] original word, remember that to bring
[43:07] forth every word of its kind and
[43:10] everything that he made would be God's
[43:12] own word bringing forth of its kind. So,
[43:14] it's the word that brings forth. We we
[43:16] need to understand this part, this
[43:18] dynamic of what's being expressed in
[43:20] these several verses we're reading
[43:21] today. And now God took 6,000 years to
[43:25] express the original word, to express it
[43:29] in its seed form, to express it in a
[43:31] particular image. He says, "Now the
[43:32] deformer has taken 6,000 years to deform
[43:35] the word of God. And what has he done?
[43:37] He has brought himself to a new type of
[43:39] Eden, Satan's Eden. And that's where we
[43:42] are living today." Now, isn't that an
[43:44] interesting negative parallel
[43:47] that you see 6,000 years in a perfect
[43:50] Eden, man and woman in an Eden, living
[43:52] in perfection, but now here we are 6,000
[43:55] years later, we're living in an Eden,
[43:56] but it's not God's delight. It's Satan's
[43:59] delight.
[43:59] Right?
[44:00] And Satan is just loving it.
[44:04] This is Satan's He's the God of this
[44:07] evil age. He's the God of this world.
[44:09] He's the prince of the power of the air.
[44:11] He He's ruling things and he's deceived.
[44:13] He's delusional.
[44:15] I was fellowshipping with a pastor in
[44:17] Tucson this week and he was sharing with
[44:19] me some personal things. Uh it was
[44:21] brother Doug Baker and and we were what
[44:24] he was expressing to me. It just showed
[44:26] me he was sharing this with me how
[44:29] someone could be under this delusion.
[44:30] This is just me kind of summarizing it.
[44:32] And you could think you look at the
[44:34] person, you think, man, they're really
[44:36] sincere.
[44:38] And yet, they're completely convinced uh
[44:41] they're sincere about a wrong so much
[44:42] that, you know, they really believe
[44:44] this. They're really convinced of this.
[44:46] But then you have others who are just
[44:48] slick
[44:49] and they don't believe what they're
[44:51] saying no more uh uh than than it is
[44:54] true. They don't believe it at all. In
[44:55] other words, but they want you to buy it
[44:57] as if it's truth. And and I and Satan to
[45:00] me is one who God even speaks of
[45:02] bringing a strong delusion. They're just
[45:03] delusional. They actually think he he
[45:05] still thinks he can win.
[45:09] That's why that wounded serpent when it
[45:11] went out into the waters became more
[45:13] volatile because it still was holding on
[45:16] to the hope that it could overcome the
[45:18] bride. It could overcome the elect.
[45:21] So now he says that's where we're living
[45:22] today. Very sobering.
[45:24] But yet remember
[45:28] the end these things are dealt with in
[45:30] leadership. One of brother Bram's very
[45:32] last last words he's going to be sharing
[45:34] with us. God, it taken you. He's
[45:36] praying. This is so beautiful. God, it
[45:38] took you 6,000 years according to the
[45:40] Bible to build in Eden. And you put your
[45:42] son and his wife in there, his bride to
[45:44] rule over it. Now, that's an image we're
[45:47] going to try to come to this morning.
[45:49] And Satan come around and perverted it.
[45:51] He's got 6,000 years and he's built his
[45:53] own intellectual eating through science
[45:55] and education and so-called
[45:57] intelligence. And he's built it into a
[45:59] mess of death.
[46:00] Amen.
[46:01] And what does he use? Science and
[46:03] education and so-called intelligence.
[46:06] And though we live by the tree of
[46:07] knowledge of good and evil, and though
[46:09] we are have benefited by science and
[46:11] education and intelligence, we need the
[46:13] wisdom of God and the leadership of the
[46:15] Holy Spirit to counteract all the poison
[46:17] and the leaven that's contained in these
[46:19] things.
[46:21] I I I I I believe in an education. I I
[46:24] believe in science. I actually as a
[46:26] matter of fact I would say that um in
[46:28] God we trust. Everyone else bring data.
[46:31] Right.
[46:32] Right.
[46:33] That's right.
[46:34] And so in God we trust but everyone else
[46:35] I want I want some scientific method
[46:37] applied to your theory. I want to I want
[46:39] to see this thing worked out. I want to
[46:40] know uh the margin of error. I want to
[46:42] know the controls that were put in the
[46:44] experiment. I want to know how big the
[46:46] test pool was. I want to know if if
[46:47] there was a control group. I I want to
[46:49] know everything about it. Did you know
[46:50] if you drink that it's going to cause
[46:51] cancer? What are you basing that on? I'm
[46:53] basing it on a study that was written in
[46:55] 1972. Can you give me the study? I want
[46:57] to read it. And I'll read the entire
[46:58] thing. I'll go to all the footnotes and
[47:00] I'll find the 460,000 articles that have
[47:03] been published since then that debunk
[47:04] it.
[47:05] And I'll say I I'll get my dolly with
[47:07] all my banker boxes full and I'll say,
[47:09] "Where do you want me to put this? I'm
[47:11] returning your study with my studies."
[47:14] That's how I am when it comes to natural
[47:16] things
[47:17] because that's what we live by and
[47:20] that's the that's what pervades in the
[47:22] carnal realm in the natural world. But
[47:23] then notice what God says. Oh God, take
[47:26] us back to Eden again, Lord, where
[47:29] there's no death, where there's no
[47:31] sorrow.
[47:32] His hunger and his desire as he begins
[47:35] to express it is not that we would
[47:38] remain intellectual, not that we would
[47:40] begin just to cope. That that may be one
[47:42] of the biggest problems with a lot of
[47:44] the things that are out there today.
[47:46] It's really just how to live here and
[47:47] get by.
[47:48] Yeah.
[47:49] It's really I mean, if you could just
[47:50] subtitle every single religious, every
[47:52] single doctrine and every single
[47:54] theology out there is how to get
[47:56] comfortable in Leodysa.
[47:59] How to get by in Satan's Eden.
[48:01] Right.
[48:02] And I'm so glad that the message we've
[48:04] received is how to get out of here.
[48:08] Someone asked me, "What does that mean
[48:09] going home? is was that about you coming
[48:11] back to Arizona? I said, "Well, I guess
[48:13] you could look at it that way,
[48:15] but it's it it just in the beginning,
[48:17] it's not necessarily going to be the by
[48:19] line to the church logo uh uh forever,
[48:22] but it speaks of what our purpose of
[48:24] gathering is."
[48:25] Amen.
[48:28] It's the for the purpose of leaving.
[48:31] And if we can have going in mind and
[48:34] that lost souls are part of that,
[48:36] evangelism is part of getting the
[48:37] message out. If it means supporting a a
[48:40] missionary work and supporting an
[48:42] endeavor, uh, Brother Barry Coffee has
[48:45] been trying to uh, uh, get a certain
[48:47] project done and there's some funds that
[48:49] are needed for that. And Lord willing, I
[48:51] want to take up a missionary offering
[48:52] the first Sunday in December. So maybe
[48:54] you could remember that, we could remind
[48:56] you of it as well. That there's things
[48:57] that we support, not because we want to
[48:59] be checking all the boxes of what a
[49:00] church does.
[49:02] There's no stations.
[49:04] Did you do your Our Fathers? Did you do
[49:06] Glory Bees? Did you do all No, we do
[49:08] these things because we have a result in
[49:10] mind. We're going home. He says, "Oh
[49:12] God, take us back to Eden again
[49:15] where there's no death, where there's no
[49:16] sorrow."
[49:19] In Genesis 1:es 3:5,
[49:22] "And God said, "Let there be light." So
[49:24] now we're now we're just going to pick
[49:26] up on these six days of creation.
[49:28] He says, "And God said, let there be
[49:30] light." And there was light. And God saw
[49:32] the light that it was good. And God
[49:35] divided the light from the darkness. And
[49:37] God called the light day, and the
[49:40] darkness he called night, and the
[49:42] evening and the morning were the first
[49:44] day.
[49:46] Now, I I was uh pondering this and and
[49:50] and meditating. And I say, "Lord, I I
[49:52] want to understand better the placing of
[49:55] these things."
[49:57] Because the sun by name does not come
[50:01] into view till later in the fourth day
[50:03] when there's two great lights.
[50:05] But yet something's being expressed here
[50:09] that is a a lightbringer and therefore a
[50:12] lifegiver, right? And it has the it is
[50:15] something that in being divided. There's
[50:17] a light that's shining that we could say
[50:20] at the very least represents is
[50:22] represented in the sun that we know
[50:24] today.
[50:26] And that there's a light then that was
[50:28] existing then as a sun which was divided
[50:31] between light and dark. And he says when
[50:34] he divided the light from the dark he
[50:36] called the light day in the darkness he
[50:39] called night. And it says in the evening
[50:42] and the morning were the first day. So
[50:43] now God has established the interval and
[50:46] by creating on the first day the result
[50:48] of the first day is a day. It's almost
[50:51] like circular reasoning on the first day
[50:53] God created the day and so he said let
[50:55] there be light. Now brother Brandham
[50:57] says and it is the rising of the sun and
[50:58] I want to this is your driver's test.
[51:00] How many can read this?
[51:03] Can anybody read this? Well those in the
[51:05] first three rows any brother Mike okay
[51:08] but you got binoculars that doesn't
[51:09] count.
[51:11] Anybody? Anybody in the back read that?
[51:12] You can read it, Gabriel. Awesome. Okay,
[51:15] that's great. So, then I'll keep that
[51:16] font.
[51:18] I just didn't want to have to keep
[51:19] cycling through all the slides. It just
[51:20] was easier on me. Uh, I ran out of time,
[51:24] I guess, maybe to break it up into
[51:25] several slides. But just try to follow
[51:27] this, those who can those who can read
[51:30] and interpret for the neighbor next to
[51:31] you if there's any ambiguity. But notice
[51:33] it is the rising of the sun. Abraham's
[51:36] preaching this not as a historical it
[51:38] was the rising of the sun but a
[51:40] declaration to the bride on April 18th
[51:43] 1965. It is the rising of the sun.
[51:47] Amen.
[51:48] The sen. He says and the first light was
[51:51] ever given in the earth was God's spoken
[51:53] word. There's the spoken word again.
[51:55] That's the first light that ever came as
[51:56] God's spoken word. The first light that
[51:58] ever struck the earth was God's spoken
[52:00] word. He said let there be light. So
[52:03] when we see let there be light and
[52:05] there's a light it is the it is Christ
[52:09] which is the sun
[52:11] which is God in the beginning the logos
[52:13] is like a sun that comes out of God and
[52:15] then we see it now embodied in a light
[52:17] and he says that's God's spoken word he
[52:19] says he said let there be light and
[52:21] there was light that turned darkness
[52:24] into light in order I love the poetry
[52:26] over these next several statements in
[52:28] order to bring forth a creation of joy
[52:30] and life upon the earth. Then the spirit
[52:33] of God as it moved with love and
[52:35] compassion at that great day, the first
[52:38] day of the dawn of creation upon the
[52:40] earth, the sun rose and swept across its
[52:44] rays and dried up the waters from the
[52:46] earth and made an atmosphere above. And
[52:48] he's describing these things that begin
[52:49] to happen as the sun begins to beat upon
[52:51] upon this chaos and this darkness. And
[52:53] he says, he describes it, isn't this
[52:55] beautiful? He says, and all for its
[52:57] first time it was to bring joy and life
[53:00] to the earth by seed. That was a great
[53:02] hour. Could we pause and just frame that
[53:04] for a moment? A creation of joy and
[53:08] life, compassion.
[53:11] A and he says, "Oh, a great day of dawn
[53:13] of creation rays beaming out bringing
[53:16] joy and life." He says, "That was a
[53:18] great hour." So now, as Genesis chapter
[53:20] 1 3:5 is framed, we look at the now that
[53:23] is an amazing, beautiful picture. That
[53:25] has to be the most glorious sunrise
[53:27] ever. That's the one we want on our
[53:30] Instagram. No filter.
[53:33] It's perfect, right? Notice what he
[53:36] says.
[53:38] But oh, it wasn't nothing.
[53:40] That sunrise, like the sunrise on that
[53:43] Easter morning. The first time with the
[53:45] sun leaping into the skies, it brought
[53:47] forth a greater sunrise than ever
[53:49] because it came greater news with this
[53:51] sunrise than it did with the sunrise at
[53:54] the beginning.
[53:55] So we say, "In the beginning, God said,
[53:57] "Let there be light." Oh, that's
[53:58] amazing. That's fantastic. That's
[54:00] powerful. That's God's spoken word. But
[54:02] then one day, the sun rose.
[54:05] The su n rose with the s o and that
[54:08] rising of the sun was greater.
[54:11] Oh, what a resurrection that was. What a
[54:14] resurrection this is.
[54:16] It just keeps getting goodter and
[54:17] goodter.
[54:20] Oh, that's so beautiful. He says,
[54:22] "Because it came greater news. This
[54:24] sunrise brought a news that he is risen.
[54:26] He's quickened from the dead as he
[54:28] promised. He's risen from the dead. Now,
[54:30] as you study the message, as you go and
[54:32] listen to his rising sun, he's bringing
[54:33] a pillow to our day.
[54:36] So, we can look back and say, "Oh, if I
[54:37] could have just been there in Genesis
[54:38] 1:3, if I could have just been there,
[54:41] maybe, oh, if I could just be there when
[54:42] he come out of the tomb,
[54:45] but you're here
[54:47] witnessing a beautiful sunrise." That's
[54:49] right.
[54:51] He said the first time the sun rose in
[54:53] Genesis 1, it was bringing a message
[54:55] that there will be a life. There will be
[54:57] life upon the earth, mortal life. But
[55:00] this time when the sun rose, there was a
[55:02] dual sun rising, another sen rising.
[55:05] Sunrising, it was not only an su rising,
[55:07] it was an s had risen to bring eternal
[55:10] life to all God's promised seat. Now
[55:12] notice the connection that by
[55:13] fornowledge he had seen laying upon the
[55:16] earth.
[55:18] So there's something expressed now as
[55:20] the sunlight comes forth and it's going
[55:22] to be beaming through these six days of
[55:23] creation. God is foreshadowing
[55:26] that one day the sun's going to rise and
[55:28] it may unfold over a couple thousand
[55:31] years and through several church ages,
[55:33] but the light's going to find the seed
[55:35] because it was laying there in the
[55:36] beginning and came forth through several
[55:38] thousand years and it's coming forth
[55:39] now.
[55:42] You could even say through 6,000 years,
[55:45] right? Humanity will reign upon this
[55:47] earth and there'll be souls that are
[55:49] saved in one and there in etern through
[55:51] 6,000 years and then we'll have our
[55:53] millennial honeymoon rest the seventh
[55:55] day.
[55:58] He says no more could the botney life
[56:00] live back there at the beginning without
[56:02] the su to bring it to life. No more than
[56:04] today when sons of God is upon the
[56:06] earth. It takes the sen light to bring
[56:08] them to eternal life. His chosen ones
[56:10] that he knew before the foundation of
[56:12] the world. He had chosen them in himself
[56:14] before the foundation of the world. And
[56:17] on Easter morning, then in this dirt
[56:21] somewhere laid our bodies at that time.
[56:24] For we are the dust of the earth.
[56:27] Somewhere in the dirt.
[56:30] Somewhere
[56:31] in the earth, which we'll point out in
[56:35] greater detail when we get to Genesis
[56:37] chap chapter 2, this flesh represents
[56:40] it.
[56:42] He says, "And in heaven," so now this is
[56:44] two two important elements I want you to
[56:45] see because once we get to the next uh
[56:49] the next two days these elements begin
[56:51] to take shape. He says on Easter morning
[56:55] our bodies laid in the dust of the earth
[56:57] represented there in the dust earth
[56:58] represented in earth in some way. He's
[57:00] saying when that sun rose and then the
[57:02] so rose that we were represented
[57:04] somewhere and he says and in heaven. So
[57:06] as a representation on earth and in
[57:08] heaven there was a book of memory and
[57:10] his attributes was in him knowing that
[57:12] because this son of God raised it would
[57:14] also raise the life every son that was
[57:17] for ordained to this great time. He knew
[57:19] it would be
[57:20] and what a more glorious sunrise that
[57:23] was ever than it was at the beginning at
[57:26] at time when it first dawned.
[57:29] Amen.
[57:30] It was a more glorious sunrise then on
[57:33] Easter morning than it was at the
[57:34] beginning when it first dawned. So the
[57:36] first d awning glorious, glorious,
[57:38] glorious, very good, very good, perfect,
[57:40] perfect. But then there's another one
[57:42] which is even more glorious, even more
[57:44] perfect, even more beautiful.
[57:50] That gives Genesis chapter 1:es 3-5 more
[57:53] weight, more significance.
[57:55] Now he said in this the the rising of
[57:59] the sun there being a day and a night
[58:02] and brother Brandham likens the sun
[58:04] rising. He says it's going to there's
[58:05] the the earth
[58:08] there there's a representation in earth
[58:10] the body there's something representing
[58:11] earth but then there's a book in heaven
[58:15] but they're they're not completely
[58:17] disconnected
[58:18] because he says he knew that the life of
[58:21] every son for ordained to this time he
[58:23] had a book of memory in heaven of the
[58:25] life that was going to be in the earth
[58:28] right
[58:29] and and a special record called the
[58:31] lamb's book of life that that's
[58:32] connected to so there's something in the
[58:34] heaven, but it has to be reflected here
[58:35] upon the earth. Genesis chapter 1 6 to8.
[58:38] See, we're doing this verse by verse.
[58:40] And he says, God said, "Let there be a
[58:43] firmament in the midst of the waters."
[58:45] Now, the the language here is is
[58:47] intriguing. And let it divide the waters
[58:49] from the waters. And God made the
[58:52] firmament and divided the waters which
[58:55] were under the firmament from the waters
[58:57] which were above the firmament. And it
[58:59] was so. So if we go in the beginning, it
[59:01] begins to describe the earth without
[59:02] form and void and chaos. It actually
[59:04] speaks of some kind of fluid mass
[59:06] without any discernable shape. And so
[59:08] there was some some waters there's
[59:10] waters now that are being divided and
[59:12] there's going to be waters that are
[59:13] above and there's waters that are below.
[59:16] And God called the firmament heaven. So
[59:18] now once he's divided the waters and
[59:21] there's a firmament above,
[59:23] there's waters above the firmament and
[59:25] there's waters under the firmament.
[59:26] There's now a dimension called heaven or
[59:28] a space called heaven. Not the
[59:31] supernatural realm of heaven, but the an
[59:33] atmosphere. And the evening and the
[59:35] morning were the second day. So as God
[59:38] created light in the first day and the
[59:40] evening and the morning were the first
[59:41] day. Now God has brought a division and
[59:44] it's the second day. To try to summarize
[59:47] this
[59:49] uh without the benefit of any animation
[59:50] or slides, but God is dividing
[59:52] atmospheres.
[59:54] When it says he brings forth the
[59:55] heavens, it it's like a it's a medium of
[59:58] light and life.
[1:00:00] It's a it's a dimension. It's an
[1:00:01] atmosphere. It's a realm. It's the air
[1:00:03] we breathe.
[1:00:06] And as it begins to speak of waters
[1:00:07] below and waters above, there's this
[1:00:09] vapor. There was a vapor that it
[1:00:10] describes the clouds and there's mist.
[1:00:12] There's water. Because you realize that
[1:00:14] um H2O, it can be in solid form, it
[1:00:16] could be in vapor form, it could be in a
[1:00:18] liquid form. It's still the same thing.
[1:00:20] It's water. So there's there's different
[1:00:21] ways that the water is represented. You
[1:00:23] have vapors, you have clouds, and with
[1:00:24] the vapor and the light, what do you
[1:00:26] have? You have rainbows. And these
[1:00:28] things are expressed and and made
[1:00:30] manifest in these heavens. As God would
[1:00:32] begin to create, there's waters that
[1:00:33] would then be represented upon the earth
[1:00:35] that we'll see here in a moment. But
[1:00:37] then as God creates these heavens, you
[1:00:39] have God dividing the atmosphere. God is
[1:00:41] actually stretching out the sky with
[1:00:44] mist of clouds and vapors and and and
[1:00:47] and light shining in the mist creating
[1:00:49] rainbows and different things or
[1:00:50] different reflections. And in Psalm or
[1:00:53] the the elements that would make the
[1:00:55] rainbow, the things that would be in the
[1:00:56] sky to be able to declare signs and
[1:00:58] express things. And in Psalms 104:2, he
[1:01:01] says, "Who cover thyself with light as
[1:01:03] with a garment." I think that that's a
[1:01:06] beautiful warm scripture. He covers you
[1:01:09] with light as a garment. And then it
[1:01:10] speaks of God, how who stretcheth out
[1:01:12] the heavens like a curtain. And that's
[1:01:15] that's how the language is used when it
[1:01:17] talks about how God made the firmament.
[1:01:19] And you look at this scripture in other
[1:01:21] places. It was as if God was expanding
[1:01:23] something.
[1:01:24] He's expanding the skies. He's expanding
[1:01:26] the heavens. As the Bible even speaks in
[1:01:28] Amos, the stories of heaven. And it's
[1:01:31] not like a story, but it's it's speaks
[1:01:33] of some kind of order, some kind of
[1:01:35] junction and and spacing that God is
[1:01:37] creating and dividing. The waters above
[1:01:39] the firmament now are creating the
[1:01:42] perfect atmospheric conditions for life.
[1:01:46] God is creating an atmosphere above, a
[1:01:50] buffer of protection.
[1:01:52] Uh there's ways that it could be
[1:01:54] described where God had created this
[1:01:55] perfect greenhouse because now you have
[1:01:57] the a buffer of water around the entire
[1:02:00] earth and it would create where
[1:02:02] everything was the same temperature,
[1:02:04] everything had the same ability. We say,
[1:02:05] "Well, what zone am I in? plants can I
[1:02:07] plant this time of year? Is it dry? Is
[1:02:09] it humid? Am I upside down? Am I right
[1:02:11] side up? You know, it it was just one
[1:02:13] climate. And God is establishing this by
[1:02:16] not only where he placed the earth in
[1:02:18] relation uh uh to the other planets and
[1:02:20] the sun, but by the atmosphere that
[1:02:22] surrounds it. There would be a lower
[1:02:24] atmosphere which would be thicker and
[1:02:27] that's the air that we breathe. But we
[1:02:29] know as we go higher in the higher
[1:02:31] atmosphere, the air gets thinner and
[1:02:33] we're not able to breathe that air or it
[1:02:36] becomes harder to breathe. But yet it's
[1:02:37] a realm where birds can fly. So there's
[1:02:40] life upon earth. There's going to be
[1:02:41] life in the air. And then there's a
[1:02:42] higher atmosphere which would be the
[1:02:43] thinnest. And it's in that atmosphere in
[1:02:46] those heavens uh where the sun and the
[1:02:48] moon and the stars are going to be
[1:02:49] placed and find their final fixed
[1:02:51] position. So what is God doing as we
[1:02:53] read further and read through it? God is
[1:02:55] establishing the elements for life and
[1:02:59] God is placing the elements for life.
[1:03:03] That oxygen maybe is coming into view
[1:03:05] when God begins to stretch out the
[1:03:06] heavens and create firmaments above and
[1:03:08] firmaments below. Because if there's
[1:03:10] water and we know that it's made of
[1:03:11] hydrogen and oxygen, we realize that
[1:03:13] there had to be something then that's
[1:03:14] being separated out that provides an
[1:03:16] atmosphere where we could breathe oxygen
[1:03:19] and not water.
[1:03:23] And he's bringing not only establishing
[1:03:24] and placing the elements for life, but
[1:03:26] he's putting them in order. He's
[1:03:28] establishing order. How that there there
[1:03:31] may have been, this is just as I've
[1:03:33] pondered, this may have been gravity
[1:03:34] that now is being put into place. That
[1:03:37] where you had a fluid mass that maybe
[1:03:38] was able to run freely and and there was
[1:03:41] really uh just different forces that
[1:03:43] were holding it together. But now when
[1:03:45] God begins to divide, there's a
[1:03:46] pressure, there's a gravity that's going
[1:03:48] to begin to hold things. And God is
[1:03:49] actually in the beginning instituting
[1:03:51] the laws of nature that science itself
[1:03:54] breaks into and discovers.
[1:03:57] When they discover the laws of the law
[1:03:59] of gravity, when they discover the laws
[1:04:00] of nature, they're breaking into God's
[1:04:02] laboratory. Genesis 1 and two,
[1:04:05] that they're just discovering what God
[1:04:06] has already laid out, what God has
[1:04:07] already instituted, what God has already
[1:04:09] put into place, and it's time perfectly.
[1:04:11] And they can predict this, and they can
[1:04:12] predict that. And they have all these
[1:04:14] different scientific laws and rules of
[1:04:16] nature. They even call it mother nature.
[1:04:18] They call it laws of nature, things that
[1:04:19] are immutable. This is what happens. We
[1:04:21] know this is what's going to happen. God
[1:04:23] is already establishing them in Genesis
[1:04:25] 1:es 6 to8. Then in verse 9, and God
[1:04:29] said, "Let the waters under the heaven,"
[1:04:32] because he's divided them. Then in verse
[1:04:34] 9, he says, "Let the waters under the
[1:04:36] heaven be gathered together under one
[1:04:38] place, and let the dry land appear." And
[1:04:41] it was so. Oh, this is so beautiful.
[1:04:44] So now there's waters under the heaven,
[1:04:47] but they have to be opened up. There's
[1:04:50] waters covering up the land. And now
[1:04:52] think of what God does. He parts the
[1:04:55] water so that there's dry land. And we
[1:04:58] see this image come up at the Red Sea,
[1:05:01] at the Jordan River, in Elijah, in
[1:05:03] Elisha. Why? because it's something that
[1:05:05] God does in the beginning and
[1:05:07] establishes a pattern that when the the
[1:05:08] waters are open up, there's dry, there's
[1:05:10] transition,
[1:05:12] there's moving into position that
[1:05:14] there's there's an unfolding of the
[1:05:15] supernatural. It's it's the third pull.
[1:05:17] It's the open of the word. There's
[1:05:18] different things that we can begin to
[1:05:20] show. This is what takes place. It's the
[1:05:22] power of the spoken word. It's the
[1:05:23] vindication of God's prophets. And here
[1:05:25] is the beginning. There's waters that
[1:05:26] cover up. And as long as the waters
[1:05:28] covering up, there's not going to be
[1:05:29] able life be able to come forth. There's
[1:05:31] not going to be able deliverance of
[1:05:32] what's in the earth. But God divides the
[1:05:34] waters under the heaven. They're
[1:05:35] gathered in place to let dry land
[1:05:37] appear. And it was so. And then now that
[1:05:39] it's manifested, God begins to name and
[1:05:41] begins to call. And God called the dry
[1:05:44] land earth. In the beginning, God
[1:05:46] created the heavens and the earth. But
[1:05:48] now it is being placed positionally. Now
[1:05:51] it's be given a set identity. Now it's
[1:05:54] the earth capital. Now we have something
[1:05:56] of identity, something of purpose. And
[1:05:58] God called the dry land earth. And
[1:06:00] gathering together the waters, he called
[1:06:02] the seas and God saw that it was good.
[1:06:06] Oh, praise God. I'm just so moved. What
[1:06:09] happens now when there's just a mass
[1:06:11] before with their light coming with the
[1:06:13] firmaments being there as God comes to
[1:06:15] the first day and the second day and now
[1:06:18] something very supernatural is happening
[1:06:20] in the third day.
[1:06:21] Amen.
[1:06:22] And he begins to place things here and
[1:06:24] the earth and the seas are coming into
[1:06:26] view. And there's a special designation
[1:06:28] that's being separated out. And God is
[1:06:30] framing something,
[1:06:31] right?
[1:06:33] God has actually taken the waters to
[1:06:35] frame the dry land. He He's making it.
[1:06:38] He's going to weave them together. He's
[1:06:40] going to work them together. But now the
[1:06:41] land comes forth. And now notice these
[1:06:43] things that Brother Adam says because
[1:06:45] when this dry land appears, it's
[1:06:47] foreshadowing something very, very
[1:06:49] beautiful.
[1:06:51] If I promised you if you just really
[1:06:52] really got into this and pulled really
[1:06:54] hard and it really struck home and you
[1:06:57] could amen from your heart like you've
[1:06:58] always wanted to that I would stop,
[1:07:01] would that would that free you up to do
[1:07:02] it?
[1:07:04] Sometimes they say put your seatelt on,
[1:07:05] take it off.
[1:07:06] Amen.
[1:07:07] We don't need airbags. We don't need a
[1:07:09] seat belt. Lace up your shoes. This is
[1:07:11] fun stuff right here spiritually.
[1:07:14] And I I personally when the word is
[1:07:15] good, I giggle. I chuckle. I laugh. So
[1:07:17] if you just want to laugh, go for it.
[1:07:20] Brother Paul Levall is a kindreded
[1:07:21] spirit in that regards. So if you even
[1:07:23] want to give me a amen, just encourage
[1:07:27] me through this. In the beginning, if we
[1:07:29] come from the dust of the earth, our
[1:07:31] bodies laid on this earth at the
[1:07:33] beginning.
[1:07:33] That's right.
[1:07:34] So when the earth when the waters are
[1:07:36] covering it up and you think about
[1:07:38] brother using the analogy of that pond
[1:07:40] lily down under the muck of the waters
[1:07:41] and darkness and everything, light's got
[1:07:43] to get to it some. He says you got to
[1:07:44] come to victory somehow. So all the
[1:07:46] seeds that may have been laying in the
[1:07:48] earth by God's spoken word, they're
[1:07:49] never going to come forth unless God
[1:07:51] parts the seas. Unless God parts the
[1:07:53] waters, parts the Red Sea. They're never
[1:07:55] going to get to the promised land unless
[1:07:56] he parts the Red Sea. They're never
[1:07:57] going to cross Jordan unless he parts
[1:07:59] the Jordan. You're never going to make
[1:08:00] it till God parts the waters.
[1:08:03] And so now in the beginning it if we
[1:08:05] came from the dust earth, our bodies
[1:08:06] laid on the earth in the beginning. So
[1:08:08] our bodies are sealed in the earth.
[1:08:12] Our names are also sealed in the lamb's
[1:08:14] book of life. So, Brother Bam says on
[1:08:16] Easter morning, our bodies laid in the
[1:08:18] dirt somewhere, but in heaven, there's a
[1:08:21] book which represents us.
[1:08:23] And so, now this is just so so
[1:08:25] wonderful. Here in the message, turn on
[1:08:27] the light. He says, "Our bodies were on
[1:08:29] the earth before there was any life here
[1:08:32] or anything. The calcium, potass,
[1:08:34] petroleum, cosmic light, whatever it
[1:08:36] was, was here when God created the
[1:08:38] earth." So he's saying your bodies, your
[1:08:40] natural body, your human flesh right now
[1:08:43] has representation
[1:08:45] under the muddy waters, under the dark
[1:08:47] waters in Genesis 1:9. But then the
[1:08:50] spoken word of God causes the waters to
[1:08:53] gather to one place in dry land appears.
[1:08:56] So you it's it's a parallel of how you
[1:08:59] come to view.
[1:09:00] Even if by by view of being washed by
[1:09:02] the water of the word, it washes
[1:09:04] something away and separates you out as
[1:09:06] a Christian. When you go to water
[1:09:08] baptism, you go down in that water as a
[1:09:10] burial. But what comes back up? A new
[1:09:12] creature.
[1:09:13] Amen.
[1:09:14] Oh, hallelujah. Can you see how God
[1:09:17] establishes a pattern in Genesis 1 that
[1:09:19] we as every believer are walking in?
[1:09:21] That's right.
[1:09:23] God is unfolding the book.
[1:09:26] Now, we use a phrase often, the title
[1:09:28] deed to redemption. But at this point,
[1:09:31] it's not to redemption. It's just the
[1:09:34] title deed.
[1:09:36] God is actually giving
[1:09:41] God is actually giving the description
[1:09:44] that would be contained
[1:09:47] in a deed.
[1:09:49] He's describing all of it said in the
[1:09:52] bounds.
[1:09:54] It's the it's the description part that
[1:09:57] which the title deed pertain to. God's
[1:09:59] unfolding it.
[1:10:01] Is it just this mass of water? No. Let's
[1:10:03] divide the waters. It's this land. It's
[1:10:05] what's represented this land. And he's
[1:10:07] setting the anchors of redemption.
[1:10:10] He's actually setting he's setting the
[1:10:11] the the anchoring stones for pillars
[1:10:15] because it's going to be the title deed
[1:10:16] of redemption, but he's got to lay the
[1:10:18] bedrock.
[1:10:21] He's got to he's got to dig deep and lay
[1:10:22] the foundation. So, brother, now catch
[1:10:25] this here because he says now as we've
[1:10:29] seen the firmament above and he creates
[1:10:31] the heavens. So now that he's created
[1:10:33] the heavens, now he separates out water
[1:10:37] as seas and the earth as land and
[1:10:41] something's being embodied here. Brother
[1:10:42] says your your bodies in the dirt, but
[1:10:44] your me your life is represented in a
[1:10:47] book. Brother says remember these are
[1:10:48] hidden mysteries, the six seals. And
[1:10:50] he's referring to the seven. The seven
[1:10:52] altogether is one great big book. Just
[1:10:54] six scrolls rolled together and it
[1:10:56] unwinds the whole book of redemption.
[1:10:58] That's how the earth was redeemed.
[1:11:01] So it's redemption of what? The earth.
[1:11:04] That's the reason John wept. Because if
[1:11:06] no one could get that book. Now what I
[1:11:09] want you to see is the earth is that
[1:11:10] book or the earth is embodied in the
[1:11:13] book. What the earth has become is a
[1:11:16] reflection of what's in that book. And
[1:11:18] if that book is lost, it loses its
[1:11:20] identity. It loses its shape. It loses
[1:11:22] its purpose. Because he says all
[1:11:24] creation, everything was gone. She'd
[1:11:26] just simply turn back to atoms and
[1:11:29] molecules and so forth and cosmic life
[1:11:31] light and not even be creation person
[1:11:34] nothing else.
[1:11:36] Does it strike you to realize then why
[1:11:39] that book was so important?
[1:11:42] John realized everything that's happened
[1:11:44] to this point if that book is not taken
[1:11:47] then everything we see disintegrates
[1:11:49] back into chaos again.
[1:11:50] Right?
[1:11:51] Everything that's happened. He says
[1:11:52] because Adam lost the rights of that
[1:11:55] book. What did he forfeit? The earth.
[1:11:58] He forfeited the creation. He forfeited
[1:12:00] everything that was contained in in
[1:12:02] Genesis 1, Genesis 2. He forfeited the p
[1:12:05] the the promise of it, the purpose of
[1:12:07] it, the potential of it.
[1:12:10] And brother Bam saying that book
[1:12:11] represents it and it's Revelations
[1:12:14] chapter 5. There's a book sealed.
[1:12:16] And the Bible says, "No, no, no man in
[1:12:19] heaven, nor in earth, neither under the
[1:12:24] earth.
[1:12:26] There's no man
[1:12:28] that that that is existing within these
[1:12:30] atmospheres
[1:12:32] that exists within the realm of
[1:12:33] creation." Do you realize how he
[1:12:35] described it? I even pointed it says in
[1:12:36] the earth. And we might say, "Are you in
[1:12:38] Texas or are you in North Carolina? Are
[1:12:39] you in Phoenix? Are you in Poria?" And
[1:12:41] we kind of just kind of mean, are we on
[1:12:43] on the earth? But it's something that's
[1:12:46] in it, represented in it.
[1:12:50] Now I see why the son of God had to
[1:12:52] descend from glory.
[1:12:53] Amen.
[1:12:54] For the redemption of it.
[1:12:56] That's right.
[1:12:57] Because no man in heaven nor in earth,
[1:12:58] neither under the earth, was able to
[1:13:00] open the book, neither to look thereon.
[1:13:03] But what takes place? There's one
[1:13:05] worthy.
[1:13:06] That's right.
[1:13:07] There was one found worthy. And we'll
[1:13:10] find as we continue, we've even
[1:13:11] mentioned it before. It's the one that
[1:13:13] God hid from the work of Satan. It's the
[1:13:15] one that God preserved, the original
[1:13:18] spoken word, seed, son, Christ
[1:13:21] in the breach. Brother Brandham was
[1:13:22] talking about that sealed book in
[1:13:24] Revelations 5. Here's the book of
[1:13:26] redemption. Here's the plan of
[1:13:27] redemption. Here's the only way you'll
[1:13:30] ever be redeemed. For here is the title
[1:13:32] deed to the redemption of the whole
[1:13:34] heavens and earth. Amen.
[1:13:38] So the book is the redemption of heavens
[1:13:42] and earth and God in the second day
[1:13:46] brings forth the heavens and God in the
[1:13:49] third day is now bringing forth the
[1:13:52] earth and the seas or the earth
[1:13:54] represented as dry land called earth and
[1:13:56] the seas. So what happens?
[1:14:00] What happens when the book is opened in
[1:14:03] Revelations 10:es 1-2? And I saw another
[1:14:07] mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:14:11] clothed with a cloud
[1:14:14] and a rainbow was upon his head. God
[1:14:18] laid those elements in day two out
[1:14:20] there. And now he comes down from heaven
[1:14:22] clothed with his head clothed with the
[1:14:24] cloud of rainbow upon his head. His face
[1:14:25] as it were the sun and his feet as
[1:14:28] pillars of fire.
[1:14:31] And what do these pillars need to find?
[1:14:34] The foundation, the bedrock. And it
[1:14:37] says, and he says this, and he had in
[1:14:39] his hand a little book open, which is
[1:14:42] what the title deed to heavens and
[1:14:45] earth. And what does he do with the book
[1:14:47] open? It says he comes down with a
[1:14:49] little book open and he set his right
[1:14:50] foot upon the seas and his left foot
[1:14:53] upon the earth.
[1:14:56] The very anchoring points for the
[1:14:57] pillars of redemption. God lays them out
[1:15:00] in the third day. I'm going to cause dry
[1:15:02] land to appear. I'm going to place the
[1:15:03] seas there because one day his feet are
[1:15:06] going to come down as pillars and going
[1:15:07] to redeem the seas and the dry land and
[1:15:10] it's going to be the redemption of the
[1:15:11] whole thing. And God set the place for
[1:15:14] his feet in the beginning.
[1:15:16] Amen.
[1:15:18] The foundation of the pillars are laid
[1:15:20] in the third day. What is it? The third
[1:15:22] day represents resurrection,
[1:15:25] perfection.
[1:15:27] He signified one day there's going to be
[1:15:28] a rising of the sun.
[1:15:32] And the clouds that come in day two and
[1:15:35] the vapor and the light, the light from
[1:15:37] day one and the vapor from day two
[1:15:39] that'll be able to create rainbows one
[1:15:41] day. I'm going to bring all these
[1:15:42] elements of the first three days and I'm
[1:15:45] gonna express them on earth in the deed
[1:15:47] the book of redemption of the entire
[1:15:49] heavens and earth come down and anchor
[1:15:51] on sea and land.
[1:15:56] Wow.
[1:15:58] We're not even done with the third day
[1:16:02] because in Genesis chapter 1 11-13 and
[1:16:04] God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[1:16:07] grass, the herb yielding seed, and the
[1:16:11] fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[1:16:14] kind,
[1:16:15] whose seed is in itself upon the earth,
[1:16:18] and it was so."
[1:16:21] Verse 11, Genesis 1:11 is a critical
[1:16:23] scripture. Let the earth bring forth
[1:16:26] grass, the herb yielding seed, and the
[1:16:27] fruit tree yielding fruit. So it would
[1:16:29] flowers and grass, green grass and
[1:16:31] flowering plants.
[1:16:33] And it's after his kind
[1:16:36] whose seed is going to be in itself.
[1:16:39] And they yielded after their kind
[1:16:43] in their channel. He says, "And it was
[1:16:44] so." And watch what happens. And the
[1:16:46] earth brought forth grass. God speaks
[1:16:48] now. The earth is doing it. grass, the
[1:16:50] herb yielding seed after his kind, the
[1:16:52] tree yielding fruit whose seed was in
[1:16:53] itself after his kind. And now all these
[1:16:56] elements in place and God saw that it
[1:16:59] was good.
[1:17:02] Now if all these elements are not in
[1:17:04] place,
[1:17:05] it's not good.
[1:17:07] But God sees something as good when it's
[1:17:10] in its place fulfilling his purpose.
[1:17:13] So God sees the fruit bring forth fruit
[1:17:16] after its kind. He sees the grass
[1:17:17] bringing forth of its kind. everything
[1:17:18] in its place in its position and God see
[1:17:20] that it's good and the evening and the
[1:17:21] morning were the third day. So the this
[1:17:25] phrasing now let the earth this ends the
[1:17:27] third day. My the morning the the first
[1:17:30] part was amazing
[1:17:32] and then this next part is so critical
[1:17:36] to this redemption. So critical to why
[1:17:38] there needed to be redemption.
[1:17:40] Redemption was necessary. a resurrection
[1:17:43] was necessary because the violation of
[1:17:45] this very scripture.
[1:17:47] And the spoken word is the original
[1:17:49] seed. He says he's given his title to
[1:17:51] his sermon. The spoken word is the
[1:17:53] original seed. Now, if you'll notice,
[1:17:54] God said, "Let it bring forth in his
[1:17:57] kind. Whatever it was, it must be
[1:17:59] brought forth of its kind.
[1:18:03] It must be just a little legal tip for
[1:18:06] you that in in legal language in a
[1:18:09] statute if it says uh u you shall do
[1:18:11] something it's actually implies that
[1:18:14] it's voluntary. But if it says you must
[1:18:16] do it, it's compulsory.
[1:18:19] So I don't know if it says you shall
[1:18:21] wear a mask, it's actually trying to say
[1:18:23] well it's recommended and suggested that
[1:18:25] you do. If it says you must, then it's
[1:18:27] mandatory. And here it says that it must
[1:18:30] he's saying it must bring forth whatever
[1:18:33] it was it must bring forth of it brought
[1:18:35] forth of its kind. Brother writes in one
[1:18:37] place the law of reproduction is
[1:18:38] emphatically that each brings forth
[1:18:40] after its likeness.
[1:18:43] So if if this is God's law of
[1:18:45] reproduction, if you look a particular
[1:18:48] way, then as a plant, as a fruit, as a
[1:18:51] flower, even as we get later in animal
[1:18:53] life and kind, then if it looks a
[1:18:55] particular way, then it's progeny should
[1:18:58] look that way.
[1:19:00] No offense to all the doodles we got out
[1:19:02] there now, the labberoodle and the
[1:19:04] beagle doodle and all the other doodles
[1:19:06] where we have dogs that don't shed,
[1:19:07] which is wonderful. It's marvelous, but
[1:19:10] that's not God's original way. If you
[1:19:12] look like if you're a poodle, which that
[1:19:13] could be hybrid, I don't know. But if
[1:19:15] you look like a poodle, a poodle should
[1:19:16] have poodles,
[1:19:18] oodles of poodles,
[1:19:20] right? That's how it should look.
[1:19:23] And it it speak God's order. That's
[1:19:25] God's way. Now, I'm not going to trifold
[1:19:27] with this. I'm not going to argue with
[1:19:28] this. God said this that basically when
[1:19:31] he says it that he's saying each bring
[1:19:32] after its kind is in an image that God
[1:19:35] ordained, it had a characteristics, DNA,
[1:19:38] a certain life, a certain way that it
[1:19:39] should be. And if it ever brings forth
[1:19:41] again, it must look like itself.
[1:19:45] Let that revelation strike deep within
[1:19:47] your heart. Brother Bram says in
[1:19:48] paragraph 4:13, this is in the evening
[1:19:50] of spoken words of the original seed.
[1:19:51] Here is where the spirit said, "Pick up
[1:19:53] the pen." So now this is God's word.
[1:19:56] This is God speaking. Brother Brandham
[1:19:57] even as one like a Samuel uh who never
[1:20:00] wrote a book, but yet God spoke to him.
[1:20:01] And here he is never wrote a book of the
[1:20:03] Bible, but yet these dynamics, these
[1:20:04] powers are working upon brother
[1:20:06] Brandham. He says, "Pick up the pen. Now
[1:20:08] this is God's words here. Now, here's
[1:20:10] what I'm trying to say to you. This is
[1:20:11] what God's trying to say to us.
[1:20:14] He says, "The law of reproduction bring
[1:20:17] forth of its kind." Genesis 1:11. Now,
[1:20:19] in the you'll find in the church age
[1:20:21] book, Brother Brandham amplifies it more
[1:20:22] and he's able to uh uh lay it out in
[1:20:26] writing what what the Lord said to uh
[1:20:28] pick up your pen and write. But God says
[1:20:30] Genesis 1:11 is my law of reproduction.
[1:20:33] You must bring forth of its kind. And
[1:20:35] the very next thing God says, the very
[1:20:38] next words out of God's mouth, the last
[1:20:41] days, the true church bride comes to the
[1:20:43] headstone will be a super church, a
[1:20:45] super race.
[1:20:47] So when he when Genesis 1:11 is placed
[1:20:49] in there, what God has in his mind is
[1:20:52] not so much that the flower the purple
[1:20:54] flower produces a purple flower and that
[1:20:56] the green grass brings forth green grass
[1:20:58] and that all these the the orange brings
[1:21:00] forth an orange and apple and apple and
[1:21:01] these things and you don't eat grapes
[1:21:03] that taste like cotton candy. He's just
[1:21:04] saying all these things. It's not just
[1:21:06] for that. It's because in his mind,
[1:21:09] there's an original spoken word which is
[1:21:11] Christ. And the bride is going to be
[1:21:13] that.
[1:21:15] Oh, hallelujah. So, he says, "That's my
[1:21:17] law of reproduction." Reproducing what,
[1:21:19] God? My law of me reproducing myself is
[1:21:22] got to be by the same word.
[1:21:27] No wonder you're him.
[1:21:30] It's the same seed.
[1:21:34] God is expression is character.
[1:21:37] The original must not be changed, must
[1:21:38] not be defiled. It's why Paul preached
[1:21:40] against another Jesus, another gospel.
[1:21:43] And he says, "Which there's not."
[1:21:46] And then notice how God ends the book.
[1:21:48] Revelations 22 18 to 19.
[1:21:52] These are ones that we could have put
[1:21:55] in that original slide. He says, "For I
[1:21:57] testify unto every man that heareth the
[1:21:58] words of the prophecy of this book. If
[1:22:00] any man shall add unto these things. Now
[1:22:02] remember, think of this book. Even the
[1:22:04] Bible being representing the book of
[1:22:06] what? The earth. It tells the whole
[1:22:08] record from beginning to end. The earth.
[1:22:10] The heavens and earth are represented in
[1:22:12] this book. The heavens earth are
[1:22:13] represented in the sealed book, the book
[1:22:15] of redemption. It's all represented and
[1:22:17] there's and they're connected together
[1:22:18] in type and they're they're expressed in
[1:22:20] the same thing. He says, "If any man add
[1:22:21] unto these things, God shall add unto
[1:22:23] him the plagues that are written in this
[1:22:24] book. And if any man shall take away
[1:22:26] from the words of the book of this
[1:22:28] prophecy, God shall take away his part
[1:22:29] out of the book of life and out of the
[1:22:32] holy city and from the pro and from the
[1:22:34] things which are written in this book.
[1:22:36] So God opens creation with the law of
[1:22:40] reproduction in the law against
[1:22:42] hybriding, the law against mixing, a law
[1:22:46] against crossing the seeds. So God opens
[1:22:49] creation with this law and then he seals
[1:22:51] his Bible with this warning.
[1:22:55] Don't add to the word. Don't take away
[1:22:57] from the word because you won't get the
[1:22:59] original.
[1:23:00] Amen.
[1:23:00] You'll get something
[1:23:02] but it won't be the original.
[1:23:05] Brother Bram says, "Today is a great day
[1:23:07] of hybriding animals, corn, wheat,
[1:23:08] making a better looking product, but
[1:23:11] it's no good." Because in the beginning,
[1:23:13] God saw that it was good. But now that
[1:23:16] it's hybrid, it's no good. It's rotten.
[1:23:19] No life in it. It dies. It can't
[1:23:20] reproduce itself. It's dead. That's why
[1:23:22] things hybrid today don't have a lot of
[1:23:25] them don't have seeds
[1:23:28] or if they do there's nothing to them
[1:23:30] because they're hybrid. It's outside the
[1:23:32] proper channel of life. Because
[1:23:35] everything that we have on earth, now
[1:23:36] this is a statement that holds a lot of
[1:23:38] weight. Everything that we have on earth
[1:23:39] today in its original form is a spoken
[1:23:42] word of God. If it's in its original
[1:23:44] form, oh man, hunt for those things.
[1:23:47] Try to find those things. Therefore,
[1:23:49] I'll skip God. Therefore, God's spoken
[1:23:51] word is original and everything that God
[1:23:53] created, spoke into existence is
[1:23:55] original and it must stay that way.
[1:23:57] Right?
[1:23:58] Now, remember, every spoken word of God
[1:23:59] is the original seed. God planted
[1:24:02] everything in the earth by his word. And
[1:24:05] as long as you stay with the original
[1:24:07] seed, it will breed itself right back
[1:24:10] and reproduce itself again. If you
[1:24:13] hybrid it, it dies.
[1:24:17] As long as you stay with the original,
[1:24:18] it reproduces. And that was what God
[1:24:20] wanted. Whose seed is in itself after
[1:24:23] his kind. Now, I happen to know that
[1:24:26] we're that you're you're not eating till
[1:24:27] around one o'clock. So, it's going to
[1:24:30] take you about 15 minutes to get where
[1:24:31] you're eating anyway. So, I I don't want
[1:24:33] us just milling around wondering what
[1:24:35] we're going to do for the next hour. So,
[1:24:37] here we go.
[1:24:39] Verse 14 to 19. Genesis 1 14 to 19. And
[1:24:42] God said, "Let there be lights in the
[1:24:43] firmament of the heaven to divide the
[1:24:45] day from the night, and let them be for
[1:24:47] signs, for seasons, for days, and
[1:24:49] years." So now we have stars and things
[1:24:50] that are going to be put in the heavens.
[1:24:51] And he says, "And let them be for lights
[1:24:53] in the firmament of heaven to give light
[1:24:55] upon the earth." So many great beautiful
[1:24:56] things being expressed. And it was so.
[1:24:58] And God made two great lights. So now
[1:25:00] these these placing of these great
[1:25:02] lights. The greater light to rule the
[1:25:03] day, which is the sun. And the lesser
[1:25:06] light to rule the night, which is the
[1:25:08] moon. The sun represents groom, a
[1:25:12] husband. The moon represents wife or
[1:25:14] bride. And now they're together ruling
[1:25:17] the entire day. day and night and the
[1:25:20] earth. We've already looked at in great
[1:25:22] detail, so we won't have to spend much
[1:25:23] time on this. And God set them and it
[1:25:25] says in stars also. So all these things
[1:25:27] are being placed in the heavens. God has
[1:25:28] order for them, purpose. And God set
[1:25:30] them in the firmament of the heaven to
[1:25:31] give light upon the earth. So now they
[1:25:33] only have purpose as it relates to the
[1:25:36] earth.
[1:25:37] The sun, the moon, the moon exists for
[1:25:40] the earth's benefit,
[1:25:41] right?
[1:25:42] The the sun exist for the earth's
[1:25:44] benefit. And then you'll find that every
[1:25:46] single one of these elements that are
[1:25:48] being placed are being placed so that
[1:25:50] life can come forth for man's benefit.
[1:25:53] Amen.
[1:25:54] Because that's what the earth was for.
[1:25:56] That's right.
[1:25:56] And he says, "And he set the firmament
[1:25:58] of heaven to give light upon the earth
[1:25:59] and to rule over the day and over the
[1:26:00] night and to divide the light from the
[1:26:02] darkness. And God saw that it was good.
[1:26:03] And the evening and the morning were the
[1:26:05] fourth day."
[1:26:10] And we we've spent time on that before.
[1:26:12] So I want to just we see God's
[1:26:14] representing something right in the moon
[1:26:17] in the sun in the ruling how in the end
[1:26:20] even in the very end you'll have no need
[1:26:22] for the sun and the moon because the
[1:26:23] lamb is going to be the light.
[1:26:26] Genesis 1:es 20 to 23 we're coming to
[1:26:29] the fifth day now
[1:26:31] this fourth day these first four days
[1:26:34] establish something in place it now the
[1:26:36] fifth day. Now notice now that all now
[1:26:39] that the herbs, the the flowers, the
[1:26:41] fruits, the grass, the waters, the
[1:26:44] light, now that everything's there, if I
[1:26:46] could just use this word, it's like the
[1:26:48] aquarium
[1:26:49] or the pen, the field, the fence has
[1:26:51] been put in, the hay bells are out,
[1:26:54] everything's out, right? It's all there.
[1:26:56] And God said, "Let the waters bring
[1:26:58] forth abundantly the moving creature
[1:26:59] that hath life and the foul that may fly
[1:27:02] above the earth and the open firmament
[1:27:04] of heaven." So now we see that what he
[1:27:05] created on the second day is going to be
[1:27:07] a abode and habitation for birds to fly
[1:27:09] through. So now these things he's doing
[1:27:11] in the prior days he's g he had them for
[1:27:14] a purpose. So now there's going to be
[1:27:16] the the waters that come forth on that
[1:27:17] day that are divided out that we see and
[1:27:19] come forth in the third day he's going
[1:27:20] to put fish in it. The heavens that were
[1:27:23] made in the second day he's going to put
[1:27:24] birds in it and the earth and above the
[1:27:27] earth. And God created great whales, and
[1:27:30] every living creature that moveth, which
[1:27:32] the waters bringeth forth abundantly
[1:27:34] after his kind, and every winged foul
[1:27:37] after his kind. And God saw that it was
[1:27:40] good. So God is doing this very orderly.
[1:27:43] He goes from great fish in the waters to
[1:27:45] even smaller fish and smaller to even
[1:27:47] those that might crawl along the banks
[1:27:50] and be in and out of the water. This is
[1:27:52] God doing things in a very orderly way.
[1:27:54] Brother Bram says in power of
[1:27:55] transformation it come like by evolution
[1:27:58] like he was learning more all the time
[1:28:00] making something greater and greater but
[1:28:02] see he was above it all and just let it
[1:28:04] evolute up like that. See everything he
[1:28:06] be to bring upon the earth from botney
[1:28:08] life and fish and so forth it came on
[1:28:11] into birds and the animals.
[1:28:17] Now I'm going to back up here
[1:28:20] because I want you to notice this in
[1:28:21] verse 22.
[1:28:23] Now does this sound familiar? And God
[1:28:26] blessed them the fish and the fowl and
[1:28:31] say saying he blessed them saying. So
[1:28:33] the blessing is the saying be fruitful
[1:28:36] multiply and fill. The word fill is
[1:28:38] replenish. Be fruitful multiply and fill
[1:28:41] the waters in the sea and let the foul
[1:28:43] multiply in the earth. And the evening
[1:28:45] and the morning were the fifth day. So
[1:28:49] in this fifth day, you could pro you
[1:28:51] could get into numerology. You could get
[1:28:52] into different types. Remember, I'm just
[1:28:53] skipping a stone across the waters. Now,
[1:28:56] God says for the first God is expressing
[1:29:00] this now of living things,
[1:29:04] things that uh that are have sustaining
[1:29:07] life, not like just a fruit or a plant
[1:29:09] that has a seed that it's going to bring
[1:29:11] forth. Now, you have life that's going
[1:29:12] it's going to be a different way of
[1:29:14] sustaining life, a different way of
[1:29:16] feeding, a different way of growing, a
[1:29:17] different way of of reproducing. And it
[1:29:20] says, "God blessed them."
[1:29:23] This blessing is a divine order for
[1:29:26] their continuation.
[1:29:28] Catch this. Hold hold fast to this. This
[1:29:32] when it says God bless them, power is
[1:29:34] granted. A as living beings, the fish
[1:29:37] and the fowl are now empowered through
[1:29:39] this blessing, through this saying to be
[1:29:41] fruitful, multiply, and then to fill up,
[1:29:44] come to completion.
[1:29:46] And so the word of blessing, you could
[1:29:48] just take this into your bosom now. This
[1:29:50] word of blessing was the actual
[1:29:52] communication of the ability to
[1:29:55] procreate and to increase.
[1:29:59] Had God not spoken it, they could not
[1:30:01] have been fruitful.
[1:30:02] Had God just said, "Be fruitful," then
[1:30:04] they would have just been fruitful. But
[1:30:06] he said, "Be fruitful and multiply
[1:30:09] and fill." And so the word spoken
[1:30:12] actually communicates to them or
[1:30:14] empowers them with the ability to
[1:30:16] reproduce and increase. God blessed them
[1:30:19] by virtue of his word. He gave power to
[1:30:22] procreate and further and continue the
[1:30:24] species. Otherwise, there would have
[1:30:26] been a great well
[1:30:28] and maybe it lives forever, but there
[1:30:29] wouldn't be many.
[1:30:32] But notice the blessing. God blessed
[1:30:34] them. And it's by the spoken word that
[1:30:38] the fowl and the fish become empowered
[1:30:41] to reproduce the original.
[1:30:47] Verse 24.
[1:30:51] We've made it to the sixth day
[1:30:54] before noon.
[1:30:56] And God said, "Let there let the earth,"
[1:30:59] now verses 24 and 25, God said, "Let the
[1:31:02] earth bring forth the living creature
[1:31:03] after his kind. cattle and creeping
[1:31:06] thing and beast of the earth after his
[1:31:08] kind. And it was so.
[1:31:11] And God made the beast of the earth
[1:31:13] after his kind. And and notice the
[1:31:16] language is now he speaks to the earth.
[1:31:18] God said, "Let the earth bring forth."
[1:31:20] So when it says God made, it's his
[1:31:22] spoken word becoming active upon the
[1:31:25] earth wherein these things already
[1:31:26] existed in seed form. So it's God
[1:31:28] bringing them forth by the spoken word.
[1:31:30] And as they come forth, it's the beast
[1:31:32] of the earth after his kind, according
[1:31:34] to the seed that was sown. The cattle
[1:31:36] after his kind, and everything that
[1:31:38] creepeth upon the earth after his kind.
[1:31:40] And God saw that it was good. Why?
[1:31:44] Because it's after his kind. It's
[1:31:46] according to the seed, the species. Let
[1:31:48] the earth bring forth. By the power of
[1:31:50] God's word, the creatures are produced
[1:31:52] from the earth. And the creation reveals
[1:31:55] God's nature after his kind. Each
[1:31:58] species with its unique characteristics
[1:32:00] with a unique seed and unique DNA
[1:32:02] ingrained in it. God wants them to bring
[1:32:04] forth and he describes them in different
[1:32:06] capacities. Cattle, creepy things and
[1:32:08] beast. You could almost separate these
[1:32:10] different parts of the animal kingdom.
[1:32:11] You have fish, you have foul, you have
[1:32:13] creeping things, you have cattle, you
[1:32:15] have beast, all these reptiles,
[1:32:16] different classes, and science
[1:32:18] categorizes them today, right? And they
[1:32:21] could come to a species and genus and
[1:32:23] distill it down and say, "Well, you have
[1:32:24] this kind and you have that kind." And
[1:32:26] they all branch out and they all go back
[1:32:27] to these these originals. And God lays
[1:32:30] out the original and says this is the
[1:32:32] channel. This is the channel. This is
[1:32:33] the channel.
[1:32:35] Brother Ram says in the masterpiece he
[1:32:37] began to work upon creeping things upon
[1:32:38] little animals upon the earth and begin
[1:32:40] to bring that from that into something
[1:32:42] higher. And then finally he brought into
[1:32:44] the larger animals such as a lion, a
[1:32:46] tiger, a bear. Then he brought into the
[1:32:47] life maybe of monkeys and apes and so
[1:32:49] forth. Not an evolution as we think one
[1:32:51] came from. That was a complete creation.
[1:32:54] God working in a pattern.
[1:32:59] I've got to hurry. As God in his great
[1:33:00] evolution, question and answers began to
[1:33:02] make fish. Then he made birds and then
[1:33:04] he made other things, animals, and they
[1:33:05] kept coming on up till one come out to a
[1:33:08] chimpanzeee and to a monkey and on down
[1:33:10] to a gorilla and then in the form of a
[1:33:12] serpent.
[1:33:13] God is so orderly that science today can
[1:33:17] actually determine which one God created
[1:33:20] first.
[1:33:21] And God does it with such detail that
[1:33:24] they can say, "See this. This is the
[1:33:26] next one that followed and this is how
[1:33:29] they connect." And then they get a
[1:33:31] missing link. They don't know how that
[1:33:32] connect. They don't know exactly how it
[1:33:34] connects, right, man?
[1:33:36] Oh my. If they could only just accept
[1:33:38] the Bible.
[1:33:40] Do me a favor. Stand on your feet.
[1:33:42] Stand on your feet. An exceeding great
[1:33:45] army. I love it. You're all standing
[1:33:47] except some people.
[1:33:49] Look at this. I'm getting you. Don't
[1:33:52] worry. You can just stay seated there if
[1:33:53] you want. Oh, God bless him.
[1:33:56] You can be seated.
[1:33:59] If I created the expectation of a close,
[1:34:00] I apologize, but we're getting there.
[1:34:03] We're in the middle of the sixth day. We
[1:34:05] don't have any more days after that.
[1:34:07] God is working in a pattern. And the
[1:34:10] pattern is so lined up, so connected in
[1:34:13] invisible union. And so was God manifest
[1:34:15] in the beginning. Now notice finally he
[1:34:17] was appeared as Jehovah, God the Father.
[1:34:18] Then he appeared as the son in Jesus
[1:34:20] Christ. Now he appears as God the Holy
[1:34:22] Ghost. The same God all the time. Three
[1:34:24] manifestations of the same God.
[1:34:27] Now he says now we find that each
[1:34:29] generation God has lauded his word from
[1:34:32] the beginning. So in each generation of
[1:34:34] creation there's an allotted word that's
[1:34:36] being expressed. All have a position.
[1:34:38] All have a place. All have a purpose.
[1:34:39] And he says just like evolution came
[1:34:42] just like the first thing God created
[1:34:44] probably. Let's say he created botney
[1:34:46] life. Then he created animal life next.
[1:34:47] Then he created human life. Next kind of
[1:34:49] an evolution rising higher.
[1:34:52] So as God is created from the smallest
[1:34:55] detail through the living things, it
[1:34:58] gets higher and higher, greater and
[1:34:59] greater and greater. And now we're we're
[1:35:00] just stopping for a moment. We're
[1:35:02] pausing. And before we close, I want us
[1:35:05] to stand here in the middle of the sixth
[1:35:06] day, in the middle of the six-hour
[1:35:09] sermon and ponder. Just think now for a
[1:35:13] moment.
[1:35:14] The first four days, I'm not going to go
[1:35:17] back and start reading them again. God
[1:35:20] brings light in order out of darkness
[1:35:22] and confusion. Day one, light.
[1:35:26] Day two, atmospheres and heavens, skies.
[1:35:29] Day three, he divides the water from the
[1:35:31] land and springs forth grass and flowers
[1:35:34] and fruit. Notice how beautiful this
[1:35:37] would have been to witness
[1:35:39] if God if he had like an iPhone 12
[1:35:43] with time lapse. Think of how amazing
[1:35:46] this would be.
[1:35:49] He formed in this day four. He sets the
[1:35:52] sun in its place. He puts the moon in
[1:35:54] its place. It's symbols of power and
[1:35:56] position. They're visibly placed over
[1:35:57] the earth. What does it do? It gives
[1:35:59] light.
[1:36:01] And he's giving all the dimensions of
[1:36:02] life. This is this is the territory.
[1:36:05] This is the realm. This is the
[1:36:06] greenhouse for grass and flowers and
[1:36:08] plants. This is the oxygen for for
[1:36:10] plant. This is the water for fish. This
[1:36:12] is the air for birds. And he's putting
[1:36:14] all these things and he's actually as he
[1:36:16] brings these things forth these things
[1:36:17] in the first four days, he forms the
[1:36:19] setting for man's existence. And he's
[1:36:22] setting forth his kingdom.
[1:36:24] But man doesn't exist yet.
[1:36:27] And on day five and six, God creates
[1:36:29] every kind of living thing in sea and
[1:36:32] air upon the land. And now it's the
[1:36:34] evidence of God's life. These are things
[1:36:37] that are animated, not just a fruit
[1:36:39] tree, not just grass, but now these
[1:36:40] things are, it even speaks of the ne
[1:36:43] where they would have a living, they're
[1:36:44] living creatures. They have a desire,
[1:36:46] they have appetites, and and they
[1:36:49] actually are given a commandment. So
[1:36:50] there'd be an impulse for creation.
[1:36:52] There'd be an impulse for feeding.
[1:36:53] There's instincts that are placed within
[1:36:55] them.
[1:36:56] So now the scene is set. In your mind's
[1:36:59] eye, if you could just imagine this, the
[1:37:00] scene is set. It's the domain in days 1
[1:37:03] to4.
[1:37:05] Now it's the subjects,
[1:37:07] the dominion, the creatures to be ruled
[1:37:09] by a higher power are all placed in the
[1:37:11] respective places. As we would read in
[1:37:14] verses 29 and 30, notice what it says.
[1:37:18] Genesis chapter 1:es 29 and 30. And God
[1:37:20] said, "Behold, I've given you every herb
[1:37:23] bearing seed, which is upon the face of
[1:37:25] the earth, and every tree in the which
[1:37:27] is the fruit of the tree yielding seed,
[1:37:29] to you it shall be for meat."
[1:37:32] Everything in the first four days,
[1:37:35] everything in the first three days had
[1:37:36] to be there for the herb yielding trees
[1:37:38] to be there, for the fruit to be there.
[1:37:40] And now God has actually taken man and
[1:37:43] see all this, I've given it to you.
[1:37:47] All this was for you.
[1:37:50] And then he says now in the next verse
[1:37:51] and the to the every beast of the earth
[1:37:53] and every foul of the air and to
[1:37:55] everything that creepeth upon the earth
[1:37:56] wherein there is life I have given every
[1:37:58] green herb for meat and it was so. And
[1:38:00] he points the animals and he says see I
[1:38:02] did this for you.
[1:38:05] No wonder the Bible says if he cares for
[1:38:06] a sparrow,
[1:38:08] if he would watch out over those things,
[1:38:10] if he knows those things, how much more
[1:38:12] has he thought of you?
[1:38:15] Think of like brother Ram says God knew
[1:38:16] you'd love mountains. a new you'd like
[1:38:18] to bass fish all these different things.
[1:38:19] He said, "God, in the beginning when he
[1:38:21] did all this, if you could just come
[1:38:23] under the arm of God right now, as he
[1:38:25] points to his creation, he says, "See
[1:38:28] all this, I did it for you.
[1:38:31] I've laid all these things out there.
[1:38:34] I've put them in their place."
[1:38:36] But in that very moment
[1:38:39] as God describes it in verse 29 and 30,
[1:38:43] it could be said at the moment before he
[1:38:45] says this next thing because it's into
[1:38:48] this perfection into this evolution of
[1:38:51] an orderly creation. Do you understand
[1:38:55] what it means when he says I go to
[1:38:56] prepare a place for you? Just as God
[1:39:00] comes to the precipice of creating man
[1:39:02] in chap Genesis chapter 1 verse 25. It
[1:39:05] is a evolution of an orderly creation.
[1:39:08] It is a perfection. But now as he comes
[1:39:10] to this God can say I have done all this
[1:39:14] for my son and his bride to be. every
[1:39:18] detail, every seed, every life, every
[1:39:22] light, every order, every dimension,
[1:39:24] every molecule, I've arranged it for his
[1:39:27] perfection, for his benefit, for his
[1:39:29] success.
[1:39:31] And so when it comes time for God to
[1:39:33] bring forth man, he does not merely
[1:39:35] speak to the earth to bring forth, but
[1:39:37] it says in Genesis 1:26, "And God said,
[1:39:41] let us make man in our image, after our
[1:39:44] likeness, and let them have dominion."
[1:39:47] And now notice what he begins to say.
[1:39:48] Over the fish of the sea, over the fowl
[1:39:51] of the air, and over the cattle, and
[1:39:53] over all the earth, and over every
[1:39:55] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:39:58] earth, God has now said, "Everything
[1:40:00] I've done from Genesis 1:1 to Genesis
[1:40:04] 25, I'm now going to hand to my son.
[1:40:09] I'm now turning it over to you. I did
[1:40:12] all this for you." not necessarily for
[1:40:15] himself, but he's placed it into the
[1:40:16] care of his son. And God describes every
[1:40:19] single created thing.
[1:40:24] He says, "And let them have
[1:40:27] let them have it as their domain. Let
[1:40:29] them have it to rule over." I'm
[1:40:31] entrusting it to them. And notice the
[1:40:33] very language it says. He doesn't say,
[1:40:34] "Let the earth bring forth," but he
[1:40:36] says, "Let us make."
[1:40:40] He's not springing forth of the same
[1:40:42] matter which the animals came from. Not
[1:40:45] springing forth in the same way that the
[1:40:47] plants came from. He's not springing
[1:40:48] forth. You got to catch this first
[1:40:50] expression now that God wants the man to
[1:40:53] come and he comes forward not as the
[1:40:55] animals did, not as the plants did, but
[1:40:58] now he comes forth from the very spoken
[1:41:00] breath of God, through the very heart of
[1:41:02] God. Let us make man in our own image.
[1:41:05] It had to be something in God that pours
[1:41:08] forth as the logos came out of God. It
[1:41:11] was represented in the supernatural. Now
[1:41:13] God's bringing something in the
[1:41:14] spiritual realm, a body, a man called
[1:41:16] Adam.
[1:41:19] In Genesis 1:27, God created man in his
[1:41:23] own image, in the image of God created
[1:41:26] he him. Male and female created he them.
[1:41:30] Oh, hallelujah. He did not come the same
[1:41:32] way as the plants, as the animals. He
[1:41:35] didn't come the same way as the fish and
[1:41:38] the fowl, but the creation of man was on
[1:41:40] this wise.
[1:41:42] That's why when Jesus comes upon the
[1:41:44] earth and so and so begat so and so and
[1:41:47] so and so begat so and so and these are
[1:41:49] the generations of Christ. But then when
[1:41:51] it comes to his birth and the birth of
[1:41:53] Jesus was on this wise when Mary was of
[1:41:56] yet had not known a man, she conceived
[1:41:58] Christ of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:42:03] What did God do? It was all He he he
[1:42:05] kind of put it out there.
[1:42:07] Could the devil decipher this? Could he
[1:42:10] figure this out? You think you're going
[1:42:12] to run a muck with the children of
[1:42:13] Israel? You think you're going to defeat
[1:42:15] promises? You think you're going to do
[1:42:16] all this and and and and scuttle what
[1:42:19] I'm trying to do, but oh, just wait.
[1:42:23] Just wait.
[1:42:25] After 2,000 years, there'll be a flood
[1:42:26] come.
[1:42:28] And after 2,000 years, a messiah will
[1:42:30] come.
[1:42:32] And that Messiah is going to be the one
[1:42:34] you've been trying to hunt down all
[1:42:35] along. And then you'll think, "I got
[1:42:37] him. The word is made flesh. And now
[1:42:41] I've got him. And I've crucified him."
[1:42:43] And the devil didn't know there was
[1:42:45] another 2,000 years
[1:42:49] because there's another one to come
[1:42:50] forth.
[1:42:54] He came by the power that calls things
[1:42:57] that are not as though they are. And
[1:43:00] what happens? They become.
[1:43:04] Man was not seen to this very moment.
[1:43:06] Man was not even conceived. As a matter
[1:43:09] of fact, serpent was over there going,
[1:43:11] "Man,
[1:43:13] I'm cunning. I can talk."
[1:43:16] And upright, animated. He would look at
[1:43:18] everyone else and he'd feel like, "I'm
[1:43:19] the pinnacle of creation.
[1:43:24] And notice God still had one more step.
[1:43:28] And they were born. They come forth from
[1:43:30] God. And in John chapter 1 verse one, it
[1:43:32] says, "In the beginning was the word."
[1:43:34] And what verse does brother Brandham
[1:43:36] always skip to? Verse 14. But notice
[1:43:40] what precedes verse 14.
[1:43:43] But as many as received him, to them
[1:43:46] gave he power to become the sons of God.
[1:43:50] What a blessing.
[1:43:52] Even to them that believe on his name,
[1:43:54] which were born, not of blood, nor of
[1:43:57] the will of the flesh, nor of the will
[1:43:59] of man, but of God.
[1:44:02] Amen.
[1:44:03] What a beautiful image. Not born between
[1:44:05] a man and a woman. Not born from the
[1:44:07] flesh of this earth. Not coming forth
[1:44:09] originally in God's conception in his
[1:44:11] mind is just from the tree of life. But
[1:44:13] now this is the lamb's book of life. I
[1:44:15] give power to those to become, to
[1:44:17] express, and to manifest. What a
[1:44:19] blessing. He's communicating a blessing.
[1:44:21] And God's blessing you, giving you power
[1:44:23] to become. And he says, "And the word
[1:44:25] was made flesh and dwelt among us. And
[1:44:27] we beheld his glory." The glory is the
[1:44:29] only begotten of the father, full of
[1:44:31] grace and truth. Do you realize the sons
[1:44:34] and daughters of God who are blessed and
[1:44:36] given power to become or put in quickly
[1:44:39] before the word which was in the
[1:44:40] beginning is made flesh. He wants you to
[1:44:42] come in view. Yes. Amen.
[1:44:45] To them that receive him, I've blessed
[1:44:47] and I've given power to become the very
[1:44:49] word of God. Not by the will of man, not
[1:44:51] by blood, not by flesh, but by the
[1:44:53] original spoken word seed. And that he
[1:44:56] flows so naturally. And the word was
[1:44:58] made flesh and dwelt among us. And now
[1:45:00] the word is made flesh and dwells in
[1:45:02] you.
[1:45:04] Praise be to God for his great work that
[1:45:06] he has done. Do you feel it in your
[1:45:08] heart to offer him thanksgiving? Amen.
[1:45:11] What a beautiful picture that has
[1:45:12] unfolded. I know I may have taken great
[1:45:15] liberty with you and advantage of you
[1:45:17] here just with our local assembly here,
[1:45:20] but oh my my heart is so burning, so on
[1:45:24] fire. I I I'm experiencing just a
[1:45:26] renewal of energy to serve him,
[1:45:30] to serve his purpose, to do his will, to
[1:45:33] lay aside nonsense,
[1:45:35] to be wrapped into his purpose,
[1:45:38] to achieve his purpose, yield to his
[1:45:40] design,
[1:45:43] the beautiful continuity.
[1:45:46] Verse 28,
[1:45:50] and God blessed them. Remember the
[1:45:55] blessing of verse 22.
[1:45:57] What did it do?
[1:45:59] The blessing empowered.
[1:46:03] The blessing was God's conveying
[1:46:08] and empowering
[1:46:11] the creation to create.
[1:46:16] And God bless them. the man with the
[1:46:21] woman represented the male and female.
[1:46:23] God blessed them and said unto them, "Be
[1:46:28] fruitful and multiply
[1:46:31] and replenish," which he said to the
[1:46:34] fowls and the fish, "Be fruitful,
[1:46:36] multiply, and fill. But now with the
[1:46:39] highest of creation, one more, and
[1:46:43] subdue it."
[1:46:47] Could you ponder this just for a few
[1:46:48] more moments?
[1:46:51] Man comes forth and now God blesses them
[1:46:55] and he gives them power to what? Become.
[1:47:00] To them gave he power to become. He
[1:47:03] gives power to reproduce another son of
[1:47:06] God.
[1:47:10] This is prophecy.
[1:47:14] Can you recognize that? Then
[1:47:16] this is prophecy.
[1:47:18] I was telling Sister Elizabeth last
[1:47:20] night, I'm beginning to I I I'm feeling
[1:47:23] that Genesis 1:28 may be the most
[1:47:26] significant verse in creation
[1:47:29] because everything God was doing from
[1:47:31] verse one
[1:47:34] was getting to man
[1:47:36] to the point where brother Brandham said
[1:47:37] after he brought man forth, you couldn't
[1:47:39] create anymore.
[1:47:41] He got into the eyes. He come to the
[1:47:42] reflection of heaven. There wasn't
[1:47:44] another step
[1:47:46] except to bring out a mystery that was
[1:47:47] still hidden God.
[1:47:49] So when God gives this commandment, just
[1:47:52] read from here. Read chapter 2, read
[1:47:55] chapter 3, read chapter 1, 2, and three.
[1:47:57] Read it. Ponder it. Pray. Let the Holy
[1:48:00] Spirit quicken these things to you. Dig
[1:48:02] into the message. Say, "God, I want to
[1:48:03] see Christ, and in seeing Christ, I want
[1:48:05] to see myself, but this is a blessing to
[1:48:09] mankind."
[1:48:11] And God blessed them. And if this
[1:48:14] blessing then was never fulfilled by
[1:48:17] Adam and the woman.
[1:48:19] But that blessing became embodied in
[1:48:22] Jesus Christ. Then you are under this
[1:48:26] prophecy.
[1:48:27] This is the bride's blessing. God
[1:48:30] blessed them. It's not just a blessing
[1:48:33] upon groom. It's a blessing upon bride.
[1:48:36] It's not just blessing upon husband.
[1:48:38] It's blessing upon wife. This is your
[1:48:40] blessing.
[1:48:41] This is the bride's blessing. God bless
[1:48:44] them. Be fruitful, multiply, replenish
[1:48:47] the earth, and subdue it.
[1:48:50] This is the prophecy you're under. This
[1:48:53] is the promise we are under. This is my
[1:48:55] blessing. Oh, we can have our prayer of
[1:48:58] JZ. We can have our our our in our our
[1:49:00] incidental things. Listen, I don't mean
[1:49:02] any disrespect to the promise of divine
[1:49:04] healing, but that only reflects and
[1:49:06] manifests that there will be a
[1:49:08] resurrection. It is only a type that
[1:49:10] there will be death swallowed up in
[1:49:11] victory. And we can enjoy those things,
[1:49:13] but listen, the blessing that the bride
[1:49:16] is under is a blessing to subdue.
[1:49:23] Verse 31.
[1:49:26] And God saw everything that he had made.
[1:49:31] And behold,
[1:49:32] it was very good.
[1:49:35] And the evening and the morning were the
[1:49:38] first day, the sixth day.
[1:49:41] You can stand on your feet for real this
[1:49:43] time.
[1:49:45] Please stand.
[1:49:53] If we could sing that, have that song
[1:49:55] playing.
[1:49:59] Holy words long preserved.
[1:50:04] It means more to me.
[1:50:07] Means more to me in this moment than it
[1:50:09] ever has
[1:50:12] because now
[1:50:16] could you could you come under his arm
[1:50:19] for a moment?
[1:50:23] If God said, could we bring back the
[1:50:24] PowerPoint there?
[1:50:27] If God said to Adam
[1:50:30] after he blessed them,
[1:50:34] if he said, "See this.
[1:50:39] See this Adam,
[1:50:42] I did this for you."
[1:50:44] [Music]
[1:50:46] Then after another 6,000 years,
[1:50:49] the end of the in the end of the Satan's
[1:50:51] Eden, could you come under his arm for a
[1:50:54] moment
[1:50:56] and you look back at 6,000 years of
[1:50:58] creation,
[1:50:59] he could begin to walk through you, walk
[1:51:01] you through every day
[1:51:03] and say, "See that I did that for you."
[1:51:08] Why? Well, so that you'd know I'm a
[1:51:09] healer.
[1:51:11] See that? I did that for you. Why? How's
[1:51:15] that attitude? So that you would know
[1:51:17] the barren woman could bring forth a
[1:51:19] child.
[1:51:21] See that lost son come back.
[1:51:25] I did that for you. Why? So you can have
[1:51:28] faith to believe your son will come
[1:51:30] back. And we have the benefit as Adam
[1:51:34] did on the sixth day to see it all.
[1:51:39] And we stand today with all the momentum
[1:51:41] from Genesis 1, building to this very
[1:51:44] hour.
[1:51:45] And in his presence,
[1:51:48] I implore you to yield to him.
[1:51:51] If you've never given your heart to him,
[1:51:53] young child,
[1:51:55] teenager, if God's pulling on your heart
[1:51:58] as a young boy, a young girl, if God's
[1:52:00] pulling on your heart as a young man, as
[1:52:02] a young lady, if God's pulling on your
[1:52:03] heart, someone's streaming, whoever it
[1:52:05] might be, let him put his arm around you
[1:52:07] now. and with the benefit of 6,000 years
[1:52:11] of creation of God's Eden and 6,000
[1:52:13] years of defilement of Satan's Eden,
[1:52:15] still see that God let him do it to
[1:52:18] bring forth God's purpose and
[1:52:19] predestinated plan and yield to him.
[1:52:24] Could you do that? Let's bow our heads.
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:36] Surrender to him.
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:39] Just yield to him.
[1:52:44] If you need prayer, we pray with you.
[1:52:47] If you desire to be baptized in the name
[1:52:49] of Jesus Christ, we'll baptize you.
[1:52:54] Let me let me
[1:52:58] let me offer this.
[1:53:01] I know we've probably said it a dozen of
[1:53:03] times and done it over and over again.
[1:53:08] But your faith's been raised right now
[1:53:11] to a place maybe it's never been before.
[1:53:13] If you want to claim a promise, claim
[1:53:15] it.
[1:53:16] Right now in his presence, you claim
[1:53:18] that promise. I'm not just a son of this
[1:53:22] earth, a product of this earth. I'm a
[1:53:25] different material altogether. And now I
[1:53:28] stand as Adam could have on that day and
[1:53:30] had dominion. I now stand before you
[1:53:33] now, God. and I claim my redemptive
[1:53:36] rights as a son or daughter of God for
[1:53:37] my family, for my health.
[1:53:42] We bow our heads in prayer. You desire
[1:53:45] to lift a hand.
[1:53:47] Our gracious heavenly father,
[1:53:52] I pray now for the hearts that are
[1:53:54] lifted up before you. Hands have been
[1:53:56] raised. Confessions are being made.
[1:53:59] And Lord, may we feel and sense and know
[1:54:06] what Adam may have felt on that day.
[1:54:12] And I pray that we would fully yield to
[1:54:14] Genesis 1:28.
[1:54:18] that we would so give ourselves over
[1:54:22] to verses 29 to 30
[1:54:28] that we could come to understand
[1:54:31] what Romans 8 meant
[1:54:33] when it said all of creation was
[1:54:35] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:54:38] sons of God.
[1:54:41] And Lord, as in the beginning, you begin
[1:54:42] to place things,
[1:54:45] bring things forth in a seed and life
[1:54:47] begin to come forth and then eventually
[1:54:49] even in other days, you positionally
[1:54:51] place them and set their where they
[1:54:52] might be. I ask now, Father, that you
[1:54:54] would bring a seed to life. I want to
[1:54:57] see a soul come to to you, Lord. I want
[1:55:00] to see life come forth. What a great
[1:55:02] miracle, the miracle of salvation to see
[1:55:05] one go be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:55:07] Christ. Lord, I want to see children
[1:55:09] come to the Lord. But I want to see
[1:55:10] wayward ones come back. Lost sheep come
[1:55:12] back. Scattered ones, wounded ones
[1:55:14] healed.
[1:55:15] May they come to this light, Lord. May
[1:55:18] they come home.
[1:55:21] And Lord, us who have been birthed by
[1:55:23] this beautiful word. May it continue to
[1:55:26] positionally place us in the promises
[1:55:29] that we could partake in the divine
[1:55:31] promises.
[1:55:34] I commit the people to you now, Father.
[1:55:36] Commit this service to you. I've
[1:55:37] delivered my burden. I seal it. and
[1:55:39] conceal it with an amen, Lord. And we'll
[1:55:40] worship and be dismissed. So I pray that
[1:55:42] you bless your people, through their
[1:55:44] intentiveness and their diligence, their
[1:55:46] patience, perseverance, Lord. Though
[1:55:48] weary, they have not slumbered, Lord.
[1:55:50] Though tired, they have not yielded to
[1:55:52] it. They focused. They've been just
[1:55:54] right there, Lord, as it were, on the
[1:55:55] edge of their seats. I pray that you
[1:55:58] would bless them, Father. Give them the
[1:56:00] desires of their heart. And as they've
[1:56:02] stood upon a divine promise right now,
[1:56:04] Lord, with their faith raised to a level
[1:56:06] now, and they've claimed it, Father, I
[1:56:09] join my faith with theirs, believing
[1:56:11] that they have received it in the name
[1:56:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ. And may it be
[1:56:15] manifested, Father. In the name of the
[1:56:18] Lord Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen.
[1:56:22] Amen.
[1:56:24] Amen.
