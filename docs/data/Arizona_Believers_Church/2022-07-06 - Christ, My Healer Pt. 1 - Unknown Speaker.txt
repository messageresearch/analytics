TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my tie-in for this subject kind of goes back to what we're speaking on under the sycamore tree on last Sunday but the Sunday before and we were arriving at a particular place where we mentioned how the church is a place as we saw with the sycamore tree with Bartimaeus and zacchus it's a place where there's salvation and Divine Healing or at least church should be a place where those things are taught and ultimately where those things are available for them to be received and we took some time to address kind of lay out a little bit on Divine Healing address a little bit about salvation and we mentioned how that we were wanting to start a series on Divine Healing and I wanted to make some comments at the outset and tonight's just going to be foundational and it's interesting when it comes to Salvation and it comes to Divine Healing I'm going to put it this way there's some odd controversies related to both anybody okay good we're maybe all familiar with some of them unfortunately maybe we're all familiar with some of the odd controversies um that exist with respect to Divine Healing and salvation some of the controversies make uh make salvation or even Divine Healing Obsolete and you think salvation obsolete yes there's some that believe there's no more salvation there's some that believe that salvation doesn't apply anymore because of certain events or circumstances and there's also those that believe that uh Divine Healing is no longer available and that it's obsolete and there's some that there's some misplacement of even salvation and some misplacement of of Divine Healing and we're not necessarily going to get into the details of the misplacing or the the opposite those that make it obsolete but one of the worst things and maybe that's what I was maybe coming to on Sunday but I left off of it is that there's some that make salvation and Divine Healing compete and they make them where one is preferred over the other or one's better than the other we know that one would be preferred or the other but they do it they make them compete in that one beats the other one down and makes the other one worthless or makes the other one seem as if it's not anything and you might think well I don't I'm not familiar with that but I can actually I was a witness to a situation one time where a minister and another person seeking counsel or discussing Divine Healing and this person wanted to see a miracle in their life and they asked the minister basically do you believe in Divine Healing and instead of the minister just saying yes I believe in Divine Healing he wanted to say you know Salvation is greater than Divine Healing and salvation is what we believe in and the person said I just want to know that you believe in Divine Healing if you pray for me and they started arguing and I had to actually break up almost a fist fight between a minister and a man seeking Divine Healing seeking healing because they made the two compete salvation is the greatest I just need to be healed but Salvation is greater I just want to be healed and so maybe that helps inform you a little bit there's times when we make them compete but the subject I want to start whether it be a series or a segment but the title is Christ my healer and I'm tiling it this way so that you can make it personal this isn't about brother Aaron this is you Christ my healer you say maybe a segment or series about Divine Healing in referring to Divine Healing and the scriptures that support it it will be even maybe looking into the reasons that God gives gifts in the church looking at even the manifestation of the spirit and in doing so there's a lot of subjects we could visit there's a lot that are within my view a lot that we're touching on as we study and we will visit subjects such as miracles signs and wonders and the way that God moves and those things one of the things we've been looking at is the purpose of the Altar and a lot of uh and and just a lot of different things that we're familiar with that mean something to us that we're taught that maybe we've experienced in our lives just a lot of a lot of subjects to touch on but I want to do it in the context of the present truth not that these things would be the ultimate but how they all build together to create rapturing faith and so tonight as you may be familiar with me I'm just going to be laying out a lot of materials on out to kind of lay my materials out materials that may not create a foundation but can be used for a foundation so trust that you can be patient with me while I do some groundwork and if it's not perfectly fruitful for you just know it's fruitful for me and it'll help me in future services to be able to go through this endeavor because we're wanting to put the pieces on the table so you can start to identify what we're going to be looking at and as I've titled this Christ My Healer again I want it to be personal to you I really desire this to be something that you could take some personal ownership in and I'm wanting to preach these things as a way of encouraging your faith and in doing that it would uh we're nurturing that Faith to grow and that it can go from Faith to perfect faith and your faith can grow into full measures we recognize that in the scripture one of the statements I've been coming across quite a bit over the last little bit is from the sermon expectations I think we may have used this sometime last year Billy Bam says give your faith a chance turn it loose unbridle it let it work and that's what we want we are we want our faith to be turned loose we want to be unbridled we want it to work he says you've got it all bound down with traditions and this is where we can make it personal because we could say as a church we don't have tradition we could say as a message we don't have traditions and we've been loose from traditions and we can make a lot of uh lip service to that so then we'll just make it personal to you as individuals that we do not want our faith to be bound by any Traditions he says turn it loose unbridle it let it work you've got it all bound down with traditions and he says turn it loose cut it Loose let God have his way with you it makes a statement somebody's words right either what you're looking at or What God Says and so sometimes there's some competition if somebody's word what you're looking at or what God says it can be a matter of our orientation towards something what we're viewing either what you're looking at or what God says God's word is true believe it and so these things we're going to be looking at in order to unbridle our faith give Faith the chance and as it just kind of strikes my heart now there's times we look at the word of God and say the word of God there's healing in the word of God but we have the question well I just don't know if it's for me and there's something that we're looking at that's causing us to think less of ourselves or Unworthy of a promise so it's important to kind of challenge ourselves too not come up with the conditions under which God's word needs to work but just take God at his word and and as you turn to Romans chapter 10 verse 17 . I want to touch on the importance of of doctrine that maybe the how far we'll get to this evening is touching on the importance of Doctrine and teaching and because we're going to be wanting to gain an understanding of what divine uh what Divine Healing is or maybe put this way what Divine Healing is based on we talk about Christ my healer what am I basing that on in Romans chapter 10 verse 37 it says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God one of the most maybe pronounced scriptures that we know Faith cometh by hearing and that hearing then by the word of gods we have to hear the word of God for Faith to come brother Bram and the sermon believeth thou this he says faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God that's what gives us Faith before we can have faith we must have a basis for Faith now we're familiar with dozens of statements uh with respect to that and I would even say uh we're familiar that faith has to have a resting place in Faith's final resting place is always the word of God that's what we have to base it on that's why when people share testimonies or they're telling you what God did in their life it's important that you not put your faith on the specifics of their life on the structure maybe that God built in their life for the breadcrumbs in their life but you put it on the foundation or the basis that brought that to path my wife was testifying to someone and expressing what God had done in our lives at one time and then they came someone came back around later and said that's what we're wanting to happen in our lives we're going to do the same thing and it's and you want to be careful in that situation because they may think well they did it so I'll do the same thing and get the same results but it has to be your faith has to be based on something it has to be based on a promise not just doing what somebody else did and thinking you're going to get the same results if somebody testifies we don't want to make it anecdotal in that we're only looking at what happened but we want to know the basis for their faith that produce the results and so Faith must have a basis and we know that it it's the word of God and I want to touch on this even though I know that you know it so this is really maybe just for me but the devil's tactic has always been to cause confusion concerning God's truth that's his tactic he he knows what God has said he knows God's promises he knows God's nature and his character so he is not going to be successful in destroying God but he wants to destroy our confidence in God's word cause confusion about God's will cause confusion about God's truth which we know is his word Jesus in John chapter 8 verses 43 and 44 says why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word why do you understand my accent or my dialect why do you not know where I'm from he says because you cannot hear my word they heard his Audible Voice but there was still something missing there was not a connection being made so there's a lack of understanding of what he was teaching they weren't picking up what he was saying and notice the the immediate statement he makes as a way of answering further this question of why they do not understand his speech year of your father the devil well that was really nice and the lust of your father ye will do now this is certainly a rebuke to them because they said we are not born of fornication we are of Our Father Abraham and they did not want to be likened to the uh the Cain who was of that Wicked one so he says you are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth talk about the devil now because there is no truth in him so why do they not understand Christ's speech why why is it they cannot hear his word because the devil's a liar and when you speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it so when the devil speaks he speaks against truth and the devil speaks he speaks to confuse truth and confound us concerning God's truth so it's it is his nature it is his tactic to use lies to confuse the truth even to the point of telling a half truth or part truth or something that can be 99 true but the one percent lie be the leaven that mixes within it and and and defiles it and so it's a common tactic of the devil to create a perception of conflict within the word of God and I want you to ponder this very deeply I want to make this part of the foundation that the word of God does not contradict itself there is no there is no promise of God so God promised me this but he promised me that and both can't be true right you cannot look at the word of God in such a way to where it contradicts itself so the devil wants you to perceive a conflict in the word of God to make the word itself fight against itself and then you have to choose a winner and you have to choose one that's better one that's greater one that's right or one that's correct and so the devil wants to make the word of God appear to be fighting against itself so that you take sides and choose one part of the word at the at the detriment of another part and then as soon as you make that choice you can become a champion of one particular side take ownership of a particular Viewpoint and then really begin to Rally behind a particular way of seeing it and you find yourself in defense or in championing one view you have to tear down the other and you can think you're doing the Lord's work while you're doing it because the devil has tricked us in defining a contradiction when there really isn't one and the message God of this evil age he says we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve that she is not that type of a woman the way this statement strikes me and and I I just I know in reading it now this evil age is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve it strikes me that this age is evil to prove you're not like Eve now as God has allowed it to become this evil and become the Pinnacle and the climax of Satan's Eden so you can prove that you're not that type of woman not in the sanctity of God's Eden but in the midst of Satan's Eden God has allowed it to be this evil and God has allowed it to be an evil age so that you can prove as the elect that you're not that type of a woman it says and she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word and Adam's bride believed every bit of a word all but confused on one promise so this is Satan's tactic to cause confusion this is one way of describing the fall in the beginning is because there was a repudiation of Truth it was Rebellion it was Disobedience and they contradicted God's clear instruction to not eat fruit of the tree but once you get into it you realize maybe it wasn't just clear instructions and not eat physical fruit because that would have been a little bit uh misleading perhaps in the things that we read but it was clearly a confusion about the promise and he says the promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face what a way to describe Eve's failure confused on the promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever or failed on that promise but failed under face-to-face temptation of the enemy and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she is to come and contact Again by the same thing I read that to mean the bride is going to have to come face to face with the devil and be tempted face to face with the Enemy and be tempted not by just denominational truth or something but every word not to test your denominational truth not to test your message subculture not just to test uh certain things that relate to social and political attributes of church and the fellowships we have but you're going to be Tried by every word for in the beginning of the Bible man was given the word of God to live by one word misinterpreted by a man called Satan in a person of an animal called The Serpent Satan in this person could talk to Eve and misinterpreted the word to her and was lost see it must be every word now that uh that makes it kind of that drills it down pretty tight so we say well if we're going to have to if we're going to be tempted by the same thing then it's have to be a Temptation face to face and it was Satan in an animal called The Serpent or in misinterpretation by a man and we can start saying well then who who are these people right and we say stop the tape we're going to name names no that's not what we need to do we need discernment to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks because he's going to come in such a way to try to cause confusion about the word even to the point where Christ says if you weren't elect and if it wasn't impossible it would deceive us so there's no walking away bragging tonight that we're not deceived by the devil in this misinterpretation of one word of God in the way that he can bind things together and cause confusion we don't brag on that we recognize it's the grace of God if we recognize truth and hold to it so Satan's tactic is to cause confusion and I want to I want to put it in this sense to perceive a contradiction in the word of God so that we use the word to tear down another part of the word and we want to be very careful we find if you look at church history and you even find disagreements that men many times we never I said take that back not just men will just put us all in there I don't want to be a reverse chauvinist whatever that would be uh but there's a there's a way that we can it's an instinct maybe to tear down things you don't understand that if you don't understand it you just tear it down if you don't understand it you speak against if you don't understand it uh you want to discredit it and you want to talk against it and we want to be very careful that if we don't understand something or just because we don't understand it be very careful not to tear it down or to criticize it because I think that's a weakness of humanity is to speak against and lash out and fight against or resist things that they don't understand I hope you could just put that in the context that I mean it now in second Timothy chapter 3 verses 16 and 17. it says all scriptures given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness this is the important part that the man of God may be perfect truly furnished unto all good works I believe that we ought to read this in the sense that if this all scripture is given by the Breath of God it's inspired by God and is profitable and useful and made for Doctrine reproof correction instruction and righteousness that if it wasn't for verse 17 the rest of it really wouldn't be useful it's for a purpose even the the doctrine the reproof the correction the instruction and so that the man of God may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works so the word which is given by the inspiration of God is for our perfecting or our full furnishing means to furnish perfectly so we are furnished perfectly unto all good works we're made perfect by Doctrine by reproof by correction by instruction those are the things that perfect the person now think about that that's what perfects us we might have ideas of what perfects us and I'm not saying your idea is wrong your idea will fit in one of these categories people say well we don't really get lost caught up in Doctrine we just preach we just like to preach uh Divine Healing well that's a Doctrine so I I wanted to preach a I think it was a series I can't remember what it was in the title I wanted to preach is Doctrine is not a dirty word and my wife said no that's two edgy so I changed it and I called it good Doctrine is not bad and so there's a there's Doctrine is it's essential to everything we believe Doctrine is that which is taught a Doctrine or is it means to teach precepts to explain or expound a thing to someone and so all scripture is probable for Doctrine and then there's reproved correction instruction but it's profitable for Doctrine it's profitably to be taught the precepts of the scripture it's worth it to take time to teach the things of God so that we could understand the things of God so this this entire thought on Christ my healer it's teaching on Christ it is teaching on the doctrine of Christ Christ even his teachings and his doctrines in order to give a basis for our faith so that we can place our faith so that it can grow and and I would say that is for salvation it is for healing it is for leadership is for discernment it is so that you can be perfect and perfectly furnished unto all good works brother Bradham when he preaches the seven Church ages in 1954 I'm just going to reference this very quickly he says I just love teaching oh my I think it's wonderful it gives the basis and settles the church that's what teaching does it gives a basis and it settles the church so it's an important part of our fellowship with God it's an important part of our diet as Christians to have the right kind of teaching he's even here as we look in at this scripture Our Perfection depends on good Doctrine our Perfection depends on correct teaching and it is that the man of God may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works if I can say this it's necessary for a rapture in Psalms 103 this is what we read in the in the beginning as our text I'd like to spend more time on this I'll just touch on it very quickly tonight I had originally as my text tonight in Psalms 107. or he says he sent his word and healed healed them and I just found that I wasn't going to have time to get to it so we're gonna uh just look at this part here in Psalms 103 verses 1 to 5. if you could just focus on this as we read through it maybe we'll visit some things as we read or after we're done reading bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not not forget not all of his benefits that's where it benefits in the Hebrews translated to reward it's translated to dessert or that get what you deserve not the kind that we want to have later on and uh at Culver's or someplace but it is a it is what someone deserves it's translated to recompense and so it is something given forget not all his benefits his rewards the desserts that we deserve of the recompense or the things that he has given us something given and the word this word reward is translated to recompense here benefits forget not all his benefits it comes from the word to deal fully with or to ripen so when there's recompense when there's rewards someone's been fully dealt with it it speaks of a ripening even the weaning of a child so it's some sort of growth and development that's related to these benefits something that has achieved that God is granting to us these rewards and it has to do with development to deal fully with or to ripeness forget not all his benefits and I believe he describes these benefits in verse 3 who forgiveth all thine iniquities this is a benefit the Forgiveness of iniquities who healeth all thy diseases this is one of the benefits this is one of the rewards this is one of the things that is given who redeemeth thy life from destruction there's so much that can be Amplified in these as you Ponder them who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies isn't that wonderful these are his benefits who satisfy thy mouth with good things this could be natural and spiritual but I believe he's speaking more profoundly to the spiritual man this these are the benefits of God that were told not to forget when we bless the Lord we consider his benefits his benefits of Salvation and healing Redemption this crowning and even the satisfying and a notice so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles again just as the scripture said that all the scripture is given uh by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine reproof correction and instruction that you may be perfect now he gives us all these benefits of forgiveness healing Redemption crowning satisfaction so that your youth is renewed so there's a growing in God's grace there's an experience of All His blessings as we walk into Eternal youth right there's a renewing of our youth we can see this most perfectly in the change of our body to achieve a a a a state of being where you remain 18 to 21 years old forever right we're not going to be changed just to enter into another cycle of life and then death and wouldn't it be horrible to wake up 18 years old like wow isn't this wonderful next thing you know you start aging again that's not what's going to happen it's going to be a renewal of Youth it speaks of a resurrection it speaks of a Rapture which Divine Healing is the earnest of but notice these things are necessary and these acts of God's benefits in your life of forgiveness of iniquity healing of thy diseases Redemption from destruction crowning with loving kindness and Tender Mercies satisfying thy mouth with good things is necessary for the renewal of our youth and the keeping fresh of our experience with Christ in Galatians chapter 5 verses 7 to 9 and there's a lot of backgrounding we could give to this but I trust you already know it Paul in his rebuke of the Galatians I believe it's in chapter three he says who has Bewitched you and so he was dealing with these influences that kind of came in and took them from where they were of their steadfast faith and what they had previously been taught by Paul and their stability in the gospel and the present truth and then other people come in and start mixing with it and blending it and distracting them and he had to rebuke them of falling away from Christ and listening to other things that detracted from the truth and so he says you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth a tremendous question you ran well you were doing good but at some point in your running you were hindered and so he asked the question who did this who hindered you and he uses this phrase to describe those that hindered him or the thing that hindered him as this persuasion this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump a persuasion is to induce to believe in this sense it is to believe by words to induce to believe by words in a deceptive sense or a negative sense this persuasion you have been induced by words to believe something that is not true this persuasion did not come by him that called you you ran well but now you're being hindered because you're being induced by words to believe something that is not expedient you've been induced by teaching and by air to slow down to no longer reach for the right things and he says a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump leaven is ultimately a pervasive influence that if you if you let Levin do its job it's going to change the whole lump that there's no place for leaven and I know this again this may be uh kind of tighten it up quite a bit and say well there's no room for being wrong there's no room for uh for air well we shouldn't make a place for it all right we shouldn't make a place for it and say well at least I believe half of it or at least I uh um you know I don't I don't mind eating a pie that's full of seeds as long as I could just taste the Cherry a little bit and just keep chucking out seeds all the time all right you don't want to make room for it know that if it's there God is still correcting God is washing have Grace for yourself have Grace for other people know that we're all striving shoulder to shoulder again not Toe to Toe not uh fighting eye to eye but we're walking shoulder to shoulder and we're and we're striving for truth and so there's times when maybe we see one thing here we see one thing there and it may be in a sense we could say this that maybe there's a little bit of a pendulum swing for some and maybe for all of us or at times we swing way out here maybe we swing out there but as time goes on hopefully what we're doing is we're coming right to the middle of the road and we might be on different cadences and different rhythms but if we'll all just stay in tune to the conductor eventually we'll all just get just right maybe we're just all those instruments warming not before the great finale for The Great Final Act and we might seem like we're out of tune and there may be a little bit of a pendulum swing but just stay in the word of God it'll harmonize eventually we'll get in tune and so if there's a if there's some something that doesn't seem right we want God to correct it because we don't want air to have a seat at the table because A little leaven will eleven the whole lump and it's a hindrance and so when Paul says you ran well what hindered you well it was a persuasion it was some teaching it was some idea that got in their minds that hindered them from fully obeying the truth and so the wrong understanding can hinder the truth in our lives and I don't mind putting on our understanding because there's times when uh and I don't believe I put the scripts the statements in here tonight I was really running out of time in in trying to uh narrow this down for this evening but there's times when the right teaching can be misunderstood right it's times that it happens and that's when from the point of here in our head to our heart it's the longest distance traveled for a man is for something to drop from the head to the heart and sometimes it enters into our head and in letting it just come right through the channel down into the heart there's other things that begin to attach itself to it and once it does that it can't fit in the channel because there's all sorts of baggage that that's clinging on to it and that's where correct teaching uh can be misunderstood but then there's also times when there's incorrect teaching and don't ever beat yourself up if you can't understand incorrect teaching that's a good thing I was told one time uh someone preached on the godhead and a sister came out of church and she said well now I don't know if there's five or six Gods but that was really deep and I liked it and I thought no that's not it and so there's times maybe we try to understand something and if we can't again if you don't understand you don't have to tear it down but remember if it's air ultimately you probably can't understand it and just be careful there and I know that there's that's not that's not competing with the idea of tearing things down things we don't understand if you don't understand it leave it alone right if there's a question leave it alone brother Brown says and let's not try to wrap our heads around it necessarily but just trust God to give us insight to give us understanding brother random makes this statement in the unpardonable sin he says think of it no fear the greatest plague there is in the Christian church today is afraid and the reason they're afraid is because they're taught they're not taught right and settled right on the gospel what's the reason for fear the wrong teaching the reason they're afraid is because they are not taught right and since they're not taught right they're not settled right on the gospel so if the gospel can be taught right it's what settles the people brother myself oh I love teaching it gives the basis and settles the church so the reason why there's fear again make this personal our fear can be tied to some misunderstanding of what is taught or adhering to and trying to figure out something that's not right fear is it comes from the reason why people are afraid because they're not taught right and settled right on the gospel now this is again we want you to make this personal the wrong kind of teaching the worst way the wrong the error the wrong kind of teaching or balance and teaching the worst thing it does is it makes us reluctant as Christians we're reluctant to believe we're reluctant to take God at his word we want to believe it because as we see it in the word we want to enjoy it or we want to have a good attitude towards it and you know how you hate that feeling of resentment and you hate that feeling of um I'll never forget when brother Biscoe was preaching and the way he described he says you know when you just get that I was like yes I know that I know what if that's exactly what is you just feel that little in your spirit and I don't like that feeling and there's times we might have that and it's because of human emotion uh perception and opinion and past experiences and you start to resent something you start to get bitter towards something and to resent something and get bitter towards it that's not the spirit of Christ to recognize something as evil to recognize something is wrong I recognize something as Unholy or unrighteous that's a pleasing feeling that's a embolding feeling that's something that's very clean and so what happens when we're when we're feeding on the wrong things and entertaining the wrong things it's starting to build that complex in our hearts and build something in our minds and we begin to feel this sense of wow I feel uneasy and when we begin to get reluctant to take God at God at his word there's some leaven in there somewhere the devil wants us to do is maybe not outright reject something but hesitate to believe it just hesitate just to make us reluctant and that's through fear now in Ephesians chapter 1 verses verse 13 just read this one verse this will have a dual purpose because he's talking about the Seal of God but he's also talking about the process of God speaking of Christ in whom ye also trusted how did we come to trust in Christ after that ye heard the word of Truth so trust it speaks of hope you hear the word of God and it gives you an expectation and having this expectation it gives you faith in whom you trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believe so hear that you hear the word it gives you expectation it produces Faith because it's not just trust and hearing but it also brings Faith because after you believed you believed after hearing the word and it says after that you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise so there is a seal of God after you believe you hear the word it gives you an expectation God's fulfills his word you see God confirming his word god deals with your heart it gives you faith and then the Seal of God is a seal of your faith it is a definite experience of the Baptist holy ghost that comes upon the believer who believes God's word God's word and you're sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise but if you the wrong view now will put the promises of God Out Of Reach because you have to hear the word of Truth and it's the word of truth that creates the right kind of expectation God in meeting those expectations brings forth faith and it's your faith that God seals now that's in the context of receiving the Seal of God but virtually every other promise of God could fit into that Paradigm where you hear it preach and it brings an expectation of it and then when God satisfies it or meets it it builds more faith and that's how it ought to work that's how God's word is made to work but then again the wrong perception will cause us to hesitate will inhibit our reach we're not expecting we're not hoping you heard the word of Truth and then after you heard it you trusted in Christ and you believed and that's because the word is drawing you to reach forward the word is causing you to Endeavor forward it's something that's promoting uh releasing you from bondage you're no longer Tied by Traditions you're no longer held back by things that hinder you and if you don't have the right thing preached if you're not hearing the right things what does it cause you to do it keeps these things out of your reach now I'll go so far as to say it's not necessarily listen to the wrong things it's not taking time to listen to the right thing now you don't have to be out there just trying to find all the latest false prophets and I'm going to buy their books and stream their services and fill myself up on blood moon part 1006 uh but you're but you could just be listen all the other things in the world and and by feeding on all these things in the world it's not promoting faith now brother bam touches on this in the context of Divine Healing he says as soon as you repent of your sins if God's truly convicted you and you've repented and been baptized in Jesus name God's under obligation to give you the Holy Spirit right now right then I may want to come back and visit this because it's really important to recognize the the what God the process of the new birth he says if you've been convict if you've repented of your sins by a true conviction and been baptized in Jesus Christ's name God's under obligation to give you the Holy Spirit right now right then one of the quotes I took out I don't believe it's in there he says you you say you've been seeking the Holy Ghost for years and he says I'm not scolding you but you either mistought something's wrong somewhere you don't understand because he teaches us very plainly there's no tarrying Services there's no uh there's no point of trying to wait for a special time it's according to your faith in God's word that's right because his word said so it's nothing on God's part it's your part because people have been mistaught God's under obligation once there's a true conviction and repentance and a baptism in Jesus name to give you the Holy Ghost but if the wrong kind of understanding has you under the expectation of something else you can actually be hindering the progress of that experience we even heard about it with brother Matthew over these last two Services I thought they're absolutely tremendous and worthy of going back and listening to if you haven't heard them or even maybe revisit them yourself if you were here but he mentioned how that one sister the way she was nature and the way she was bent she had the Holy Ghost but because of her nature and her past she was not going forward because she kept getting hung up on speaking in tongues so brother Brown said I'm just going to pray that God let you know it and so it shows that process and that development that can take place within our faith and adoption the adoption series part one brother Banner says Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of walking out on thin ice we call it that's why you want to be very careful when you teach I believe that is why God made a division amongst the gifts that you have some evangelists you have pastors you have Apostles you have you have the different gifts and then you have a teacher there's a gift of teaching and I believe the holy spirit is the teacher but I believe a man of God who has a true teaching gift is to be prized and to be valued and and so this is something that when there when it comes to teaching to be very deliberate a very patient and not just treat it like inspiration because Brevard says you're walking out on thin ice maybe he says but we just feel that maybe at this point at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what I think to a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus so sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother Beeler that teaching goes beyond that kind of an interesting call out to brother Beeler I don't know if he was kind of needling him a little bit but anybody know brother Beeler maybe we find what the inside joke was he says I sometimes think that preaching is a wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother that teaching goals beyond what the wonderful thing of preaching he says sometimes I think preach is a wonderful thing I would suspect that he's saying preaching is always a wonderful thing but there's teaching that sometimes goes beyond that he says it kindly especially to the church he says preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is and he makes this profound statement and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are so we want to rightly be able to have faith we can have faith but then Faith being positionally placed blossoms our faith uninhibits our faith loosens our faith unbridles our faith and he's saying that preaching catches The Sinner preaching it vitalizes our faith and it gives us expectation and hope and after we have believed on him we're sealed with the Holy Spirit a promise that's what preaching does is it catches The Sinner to come to a true conviction to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and then we are sealed because of God's obligated to meet us on that condition with the right understanding to be sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's a faith that we receive by the preach of the word and brother Graham says then sometimes teaching goes beyond that to positionally place that man what he is and we want to rightly be able to have faith and that comes through this teaching he's saying to positionally understand who we are the Brandman that godhead explains is you've got to believe you've got to have faith you've got to have confidence and how can you have confidence in anything that you don't even know where you are going how could I travel down a road that I've never been before at Breakneck speed and all around curves not knowing what the next curve holds so it happens a lot of people driving out there in some of the Hill Country and the Ozarks and the mountains they're just they're tearing through there and they think they know where they're going they think where the turn is and they lose control he says you've got to see where you're going or you don't know how to walk it's part of that confidence placing positioning you got to know where you're going you got to know where to place your feet you wonder why you find disappointments because you're listening to some promise if you step there God will meet you there but there's no word to step there and you end up falling and you want to get up and shake your fistic God right but if there's nothing there to step on that can't be Faith that's leading you you have to have confidence in what you're doing he says this quote has been featured prominently in our services here since the start of this church and images of Christ he says the church can never progress until it knows what grounds it what grounds it is progressing on we can't Pro make progress unless we know the way to progress we know the path that we're traversing and I believe that before anybody can ever move or have real confidential Faith it's first they have to know where they stand and how to stand after they make their stand I believe that is essential for you cannot just head long plunge into something with faith when you don't know where you're plunging remember the subject of Blind Faith some people think that faith is Flying Blind but in reality faith is a sense so you're not Blind Faith sees something Faith knows something Faith sees the evidence and it doesn't say well I'm just going to parachute out and just trust that God will catch me no it jumps knowing there's provision it jumps knowing there's a promise right head plunges into something knowing God has made the promise and that's what gives us real confidential faith is because we know what grounds we're progressing on and then this beautiful statement and if our faith he says you've got to know and if our faith is set right and in the right position it gives a constant satisfaction where does Fear come from misunderstanding where does happiness and joy and peace come from understanding why is it we can feel unsettled and restless and feel compromised because there's a lack of understanding now again I want you to make it personal because you think oh well that that's false teaching or it's this or it's that or maybe I don't have faith and maybe I don't believe no I'm not trying to I'm not trying to make you question your faith I want you to place your faith trying to devalue it belittle it make it seem like something you don't have but it's just taking what you do have and placing it correctly brother when he says teaching places the man where he ought to be so let's say teaching exposes you all as a bunch of frauds right that's not what teaching does teaching it is not about exposing frauds teaching about taking those who are part of that body part of the part of the pyramid taking those stones and positionally placing them where they belong and giving them confidence about who they are and what God made them in their part in God's economy and where they belong in God's Kingdom and if our faith can be set right and in the right position it gives us that steadiness and that constant satisfaction trust you you're catching the theme Here as we want to preach on Christ my healer we're teaching on Christ given a basis for faith and we're wanting the faith to grow and there's things that preach that catch our attention that startle us cause us to believe and then there's an understanding of the word of God that's going to enrich and going to make that faith and cause it to mature there's a and think about it it works hand in hand there's not uh this is not a uh this is not a rap battle between evangelists and teachers right where one's got to outdo the other and one's better than the other and what we need is more of this and what we need is more of that we need them all to be working together we need all these parts working together doing our part honoring each part giving honor to each each member knowing that we this church serves the true church and as any minister of this church therefore we serve the purpose of Christ and not our own purposes not our own Ministries but we desire to see individuals brought up in the nurture of God to come to understand the word of God and to know him and so it's the work of the holy spirit in the church that's the spirit of God teacheth these things reveals these things makes these things known to us Jesus in John Chapter 14 verse 26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost that's the teacher the inside teacher the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you to bring to remembrance is to it's to cause you to be mindful of and and that is what teaching is to do is to to is to promote the things that can be understood to cause you to be mindful of them to allow them to be established and to become permanent and fixed into our thinking the Holy Ghost will teach you all things bring all things to your remembrance the things that Christ has taught the things relating to Christ it says in John 16 13 how be it when the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth so if there's a spirit that's only leading you so far if there's a spirit that's adding to or taken away and trying to change truth that's a point to stop and say what kind of spirit is this because the spirit of God is going to guide us into all truth brother Bama in the sermon here ye him says for when God brought us into his kingdom by the Baptist Holy Spirit and become a child of God notice this these hear ye him we're dealing with the process of God developing of character development of the Son of God into the image of Christ he says we became a child of God and sent us the best tutor God sent us the best tutor that there was in all Heaven the Holy Spirit he is to nurture and to bring up and to raise and to teach the church if you have the Holy Spirit then let it do its job unbrother your faith and let the inside teacher teach you nurture you bring you up raise you he says brother we need Holy Spirit teaching and tutoring it's part of the development of our character kind of the part of the perfecting of the person it is part of building rapturing faith in the bride that's the comforter that's the role of the Holy Ghost who is the teacher the spirit of Truth and the spirit of truth comes to us that they open to the word this is that this is the day now the perfect fulfillment of many scriptures a shining light shining more and more into the perfect day this is the time of understanding the time of revealing in Romans chapter 12 verse 2 and again I might seem like it seems like I'm just dumping a puzzle out under the table and just moving pieces around that's exactly what I'm doing I'm just trying to put the puzzle pieces on the table turn them all over right side up you can start putting them together start putting the Border together if we don't have time to do anything else tonight we're just trying to get the pieces on the table so the scene if this seems disjointed to me it I I look I can see the picture and see how it fits in maybe that's what I need to do is show you the picture before we dump all the pieces out if we could only do that in Romans chapter 12 verse 2 and be not conformed to this world so there is a power of the world to try to contort us distort us conform us pervert the growth of the development of the life in us he says be not conformed because that's what's temporary that's not durable it's not long lasting so you're it's actually in the sense that this can only apply to a believer in the sense that your life which is tending to something else is being manipulated or formed to fit something else that it doesn't belong to and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God be transformed that means to change from one form into another to transfigure I says this transformation is going to take place by the renewing of your mind this is the renovation this is a change for the better complete change for the better the word means to cause to grow up we're not just children impersonating adults we're not just 12 going on 21 but we're in the process of being developed to where we cause to grow up in such a way that the person is made completely new that's what we're to be in the process of transformed by the renewing of our mind the holy spirit of God which is the inside teacher guiding us into all truth bringing all things to our remembrance stirring our minds up causing us to keep in mind the precepts of God and the teachings of God I know you're familiar with this statement we're just wine coming around to our clothes and the message power of transformation brother says now that we've been saved as we are and that we've been filled to the Holy Spirit as we have so that notice this their salvation and it's not just believing or a confession but he's bringing us to this idea this truth of being sealed with the Holy Ghost so if once we've been sealed he says as we have and I believe that it's to understand what he's going to say next now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in US that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word so the transformation is going to be by his word and now that we've been saved and filled with the Holy Ghost what that the stage that you enter into once you are still to Holy Ghost is the process of letting the mind of Christ be a perfect Liberty in you because if his mind can be liberated in you if your faith can be unbridled then you will be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God that's what it's going to take is by his word once you've received the Holy Ghost I can make back up it's by his word that you're going to believe it's by his words you're going to be silent the Holy Ghost and then the process of development continues in the believer that now that I've been born again by the Holy Ghost and its new life is dwelled inside my soul I want the mind of Christ to be fully developed in me because as he has preeminence then I am going to be totally transformed as a person from natural things to spiritual things from worldly things to Supernatural things so that I can do do do the perfect will of God and in doing so be the proof of his word to prove the perfect will of God and so when this foundational part on Christ is my healer I'm wanting to take the time as God would lead to teach the right things to unbridle our faith I believe that this message is the restoration of faith that's a restorative message and there's things that we could look at to see I'll just maybe drop this in here there's things that brother Brown when he's come into his ministry even early on in his ministry and he begins with the signs and wonders and Divine Healing and there's things that he's having to establish as a messenger to the seventh Church age there's a necessary restoration of things that the Pentecostal the genuine Pentecostal move begin to let loose of and begin to defile so his ministry is working in restoring certain precepts upon which God desired the Capstone to settle and that's part of his ministry but we know that wasn't all his ministry but these things all work together man sometimes you hear people kicking against something and they kick so hard against it they don't realize they're knocking their Foundation right out from underneath them so this it's to promote the faith that God has given us there's faith that we've received now I this in Acts chapter 19 verses one to seven this is I want to use this as an example now not as a perfect template of what I'm referring to but an example of how the right kind of teaching brings people further and so it's not a rebuke oh you don't believe you believe this you believe that it's not it's not trying to tear down everything and make somebody feel like they're nothing but it's the process of God to bring people to the journey right the way that God makes himself known there's a reason why we all weren't born speaking in tongues at you know at day one as babies I guess we were speaking in tongues in some ways but it's not that we all come through the same pattern but people come through processes sometimes people spend many years in false doctrines or denominations and we could just write it all off as a huge waste but God's a redeemer God will use all of it he redeems all of it God has a purpose and God's orchestrating things we always want to keep the right attitude towards one another and the things of God in Acts chapter 19 verses 1 to 7 and it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus in finding certain disciples now I believe it's intentional that they name drop Apollos because Apollos in Acts chapter 18 verses 24 and 25 we're told that he was in Ephesus teaching what only the baptism of John so John was Apollos was in Ephesus teaching to be baptized according to John's baptism so Paul visits Ephesus finding people who listen to Apollos a man who's a powerful powerful teacher and came into further knowledge of the truth later he said unto him have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed so Paul is coming upon believers he doesn't say have you received the Holy Ghost I'm trying to find out if you're Believers he says he's acknowledging their belief in their faith he says but have you received the whole to go since you believed and they said I mean we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost so think of this they had believed what they heard and what they had not heard they could not believe so they were Believers of what they heard all they need to hear is further truth and since they are by nature and by election Believers they'll believe truth when they hear it so we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost what then were you baptized so again there's this understanding that there's this process of unfolding of the word of God there's an evolution of Faith there's an unfolding of the Mysteries even there's a there's an unfolding of Revelation and sorry he's not trying to say oh you've been nowhere you've done nothing it's just giving us this discernment you're Believers so have you received the Holy Ghost we haven't heard of the Holy Ghost so he says then how were you baptized they said under John's baptism so now he knows what they're believing where are they at he knows where to meet him to take them further and his then said Paul John barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ when they heard that they didn't meet Paul shake his hand and say what's next what should we do should get baptized no he had to take them from where they were they had faith in what they had heard but now Paul took that faith that they had and placed it in the present truth you are a Believer have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed we haven't even heard of the Holy Ghost then how were you baptized well then let me show you what that baptism was pointing to let me show you what that Faith was given for it was Faith to believe in the promise it was Faith to believe in the coming of Christ it was Faith to believe that which was coming after the Forerunner and so he's took the faith that they had and you say oh you guys are just a bunch of Pentecostal wannabes you guys are just a bunch of this that and the other no he just took the faith they had and placed it brother says and where I think Pentecost failed he says now we've tried to jump the fence we've tried to stick the cart before the horse you tried to claim things and do things before God did it and got a lot of Flesh worked up into it and that's what's the matter with the church if real Pentecostal Faith settled over an audience of this size brother all of California would know something that happened up here tonight that's right he says there's something wrong now please catch this he said there's something wrong it isn't wrong with God it isn't wrong with your faith nothing wrong with God he says it isn't wrong with your faith it's being placed right knowing what you're doing and how to do it that's the secret of the whole thing then yielding yourself to the will of God that's the secret of the whole thing is that knowing having your faith placed right and then when your faith is placed right then you know what to do as he said to be brought in to do the perfect will of God then you yield yourself to the will of God I love that it isn't wrong with your faith you say well those people at Ephesus had had the wrong kind of Faith No they had Faith but it was only placed in part of the promise and when they heard the further unfold in the word that Faith could easily then now grow and take possession in the further light opened up new land for their faith to inhabit new land for their feet to step on into and to take possession of so it's not something wrong with your faith if you're not experiencing the benefits of God's word if there's something that's not unfolding for you let's not try to take that year well I don't have faith I have the wrong Faith let's just ask God to take our faith and place it right to positionally place it that's the secret of the whole thing and then yielding yourself to the will of God in Colossians chapter 1 9 Colossus chapter 1 verse nine these are my closing scriptures Paul in his prayer for the church he says for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire his unceasing prayer in his desired and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding hey if we're being restored back to what Paul taught this is what we teach right if this is part of what's uh what it was taught then he there's a desire to be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding there's nothing wrong with your faith it's being placed right knowing what you're doing and how to do it that's the secret of the whole thing and then yielding yourself to the will of God then we want God to take the word of God and open it up to us that we might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding so that we can yield ourselves to the will of God and Paul the very one that's right in this was told by ananias in Acts chapter 22 the god of our fathers have chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that just one and should us hear the voice of his mouth and so Paul just wasn't keeping it to himself saying well I've been chosen that I should know his will and see the just one and should hear the voice of his mouth his desire for the Colossians is that they might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding these things are very important the word is very precious to us we're familiar with brother man says I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our midst implying we can be impressed right maybe all of us here tonight it's a Wednesday night we're impressed obviously but is it sufficient sufficiency speaks to meeting the purpose or the objective are you sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst maybe a lot of us are impressed we've been impressed we've been impressed and we're just impressed but the word must sufficiently impress us we have to Value it I want to read a lengthy statement from voice of the sign we're just closing on this so we'll invite the musicians to come brother Ram's actually praying so maybe you could just pray in your hearts now and just Ponder these things that we've shared with you he says our heavenly father we have deemed this such a privilege to come to you in prayer come in the name Lord Jesus is at the very beginning of this sermon the voice of the sign and we are promised by him that if we ask anything in his name it will be granted thou knowest the need of every one of us you know what our hands represented as they went up that's why we say it's not a fruitless exercise to raise our hands he says I pray father that you'll answer each request tonight get Glory and now let the great teacher of the word the Holy Spirit come upon us tonight and reveal himself to us and make himself known unto us by the evidence of his resurrection may he come among us tonight Lord and visit our hearts this is this is poetry it's beautiful these are prayers that we could have before every service ourselves personally then he says speak to us through the things that he has promised for this day he's preaching the voice of the sign so he's wanting it to be impactful for the voice of this day Paul didn't go and preach a meeting to Ephesus and knowing that they were all taught under Apollos and just did a pep rally right around the baptism of John think about it Paul could have gone to ephodus Ephesus or ephodus for that matter and found out that they were Disciples of John and that they'd been baptized in the baptism of John and that Apollos had taught him and just cheered him on and rallied them on in what they already knew but it was the present truth and unfolding of God's word and he knew that what they had received by the preach of the Gospel had brought him to that place and they were at the doorstep of the next promise now if he had came and preached against Apollos preached against John the Baptist think of how hard his work would have been to bring him to Christ right think about how hard it would have been all Palace that knucklehead doesn't know nothing that guy's just all about his blogs and he's just all about the numbers and have you seen his Instagram account there's nothing to that guy and he could have just tried to run to paulus down or he could have tried to run John the Baptist down he could have just tried to tear everything down and then they would have been like well then now what do we believe well John the Baptist taught that Christ was coming you mean that guy you said was a knucklehead and didn't believe anything and denied him when he was in prison and you talked about Apollos who didn't know nothing it had to be taught by a colon Priscilla then would he then what are you going to be doing Paul took him and brought him further he says let the great teacher of the Holy teacher let the great teacher of the word of the Holy Spirit come upon and reveal himself to us and make himself known just by the evidence of the Resurrection May he come among us tonight Lord and visit our hearts speak to us through the things that he has promised for this day May the words that promised for this hour be manifested before us that we might rest to sure he says where the language became very relevant to me in this great Troublesome time that you said would come upon the Earth to try all people remembering God of this evil age she will betrayed by the word she'll come face to face under temptation of the enemy to this this challenge the trial people and now I'm expecting some pretty hearty amens on this one and it certainly has come to that time father when manner tried and there are so many different angles till no one hardly knows what to do angles [Music] this way somebody coming that way somebody coming at this way somebody's saying the whole thing is wrong all these different things all these different angles and he says a person hardly knows what to do but Lord I pray that you will make known to us tonight that you're here and with us it's here to help us grant our requests for we ask it in Jesus name so many different angles to where people don't know what to do oh God help us as Believers as proponents of Truth you being stewards of the Mysteries your testimony may your testimony not cause a disconcordant angle may your path your trajectory your faith not create some conflicting angle oh may we all just let our lives harmonize with the word of God so there's not just so many different angles where your people don't know what to do but he says if he'll make himself known that he's here and he's with us then he'll help us to know the right angle then that's his prayer and it's paragraph eight after he's done praying he says now tonight I think then unless we know the word of God we don't know what to do right so many different angles until no one knows hardly what to do well then we need him to come and do what teach us the word of God because if we don't know the word we don't know what to do we can't have faith until we know what is the will of God [Music] but and then he says and what then if we know it is the will of God the word of God says something then we can gladly follow that he makes a very curious statement now if the Lord Jesus was walking around personally on the earth tonight in human flesh he said tomorrow it will be raining all day long we would check our location all right but he says if the Lord said it's gonna be raining even if we're in Phoenix and he says it's going to be raining all day long tomorrow now it would be very easy for me to take an umbrella when I leave in the morning because he said it so the word of God you know it's Christ It prepares you you know he said it's gonna rain so I'm going to grab an umbrella now if he didn't say it I don't know when what to look at then what to look at so maybe if we don't know he says we're silent where God is silent but if he hasn't spoken to it then we can't say well it's not going to rain he just is silent about it but if he said it's gonna rain you could take an umbrella he says so that's the way it is in everything we do we want to know the hour the age we are living do you not think that this message is exactly that that it's Jesus Christ telling us personally the time and the season and what to expect and whether it's going to rain tomorrow so we can have an umbrella he told us the time that we're living and this word is sufficient to prepare for the Rapture and for the change what the devil wants to do is make it fight against itself cause so many different angles listen I may be using a language that may be a little bit odd many times people are not rejecting Christianity they're rejecting the subculture of the Bible many people do not reject the message they reject the message subculture associated with it and we do not need to be the voice of subculture the voice of Politics the voice of opinion and personality we must be the voice of Christ brother Matthew mentioned the statement I believe it was Jordan Peterson can we call him brother Jordan Peterson we know there is one in Tucson at least that there is a there's an idea where he makes a statement and I don't know if I necessarily agree with it but he says Jesus is the only Christian or was the only Christian yes he was the the the the first Christian right he's the one that embodied what it means to be christ-like because he was Christ then we do not want to be the vocalization of our own opinions our own ideas our own takes on things but we want to be the perfect reflection of that one who is Christ and he is his word [Music] to do that it's going to take his word lifting up and a promoting of his word trust that we can fellowship and just pray for me as we launch into this subject again tonight just foundational things God bless you let's Stand Together
