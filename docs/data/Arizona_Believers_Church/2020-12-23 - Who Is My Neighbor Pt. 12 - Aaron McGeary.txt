TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hallelujah let's go to the lord in prayer together we want to continue to remember the pastor of jericho tabernacle brother johnny alvarez he's been intubated and placed upon a a ventilator we just pray that god would touch him i know there's others in his family that are not feeling well and we're just praying that god would touch that church right now i don't believe they're able even to have services so let's pray for jericho tabernacle and brother johnny alvarez many in our church who are traveling right now some that are still sick so let's just remember each need in prayer gracious heavenly father lord we are here tonight to see you and we rejoice to be able to see you and others as you look out upon the congregation and those that have gathered together we see you we see a testimony we see the hand of god the lord it encourages us we're encouraged by the people that we fellowship with those that gather together and lord it's even more invigorating to feel your presence come while we worship and to sense your nearness to us and lord just since feeling that dynamic of seeing brothers and sisters and being encouraged and then worshiping and being more encouraged and fill in your presence it builds an expectation to know that these this this fellowship and seeing one another and worship is building to the place to where you can come and take the bread of life and break it to us so lord as we stand in your divine presence we pray that you'd come bless the scriptures that are read the quotations that are shared lord the burden that has been placed upon my heart as i express it may you stand ready to quicken it to the believer's heart it may be something that encourages us father may it be something that instructs us and i pray lord that above all may it be something that allows us to surrender and yield that you might have a greater preeminence in our individual lives and that's what we long to see fathers not a more refined church service not a a better working church lord but rather christ in the individual heart coming to it's an individual coming to maturity in their position lord that's what we desire to cultivate to facilitate so tonight lord each one of us as individuals are surrendered to you have your way we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen let's turn in our bibles to luke chapter 24. luke chapter 24 and we'll read verses 27 to 35. luke chapter 24 verses 37 to 35 again we say merry christmas to all of you it's so nice to have many of you out to the house the lord i know that it's a busy time right now and there's some that were not able to be here and it'll be more maybe not around this weekend with the traveling but we're glad that you're here tonight uh we far exceed the scriptural uh mathematics of where two or three are gathered and so we can be confident that christ is in our midst tonight and desires to speak to us but we share holiday greetings with you from my wife and i from our family we love each one of you dearly we're so happy to be together luke chapter 24 verse 7 27 and we're continuing on the subject of who is my neighbor i felt perhaps maybe even tonight could be a climax or culmination but we'll just see luke chapter 24 verse 27 this is on the road to emmaus somebody shared something with me today minister shared something with me they said we all want to be like paul we want to be on the road to d-mask us kind of clever luke chapter 24 but this is the road to emmaus verse 27 and beginning at moses and all the prophets he christ expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself they drew nyan to the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave it to them their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread you may be seated as we've been ministering on the subject of who is my neighbor asking ourselves that question who is my neighbor we could even be a question that we're asking ourselves as a church who who is our neighbor and uh i thought of even entitling the message tonight but i think we're going to be maybe uh just a little bit more focused in a way to where this wouldn't be maybe the appropriate title but the answer would be you are whoever who is my neighbor i if i would asking myself who's my neighbor i would look at those near me those i come in contact with and i say you are and you are my neighbor and uh we've wanted to use this parable of the good samaritan as a means of challenging us uh about our place and position within the community within the uh the city the the county the state that you live in and also to ponder the role that you have within a sisterhood of churches and those that you fellowship with and a lot of ways is to challenge certain prejudices and notions that we have and are really just bad habits that are really counterproductive to church because as a church you just the the mission and the goal ought to see that others are saved and others are healed and others are benefited by the gospel and if we become too insular in our experience and even the way that we congregate and the way that we view fellowship then the church is no is not effective any any beyond anything other than the activity that takes place within the four walls and i believe with all my heart that church does not exist to stand there and point people to come and gather where we are but rather it's a place that we assemble together where we are encouraged enriched by the word of god enriched by fellowship and the presence of the lord and then we go out and we live our lives as families in such a way to where we make a difference in our homes and then we make a difference in our communities our neighborhoods and that's the way that we ought to be living not this isn't the sum and substance tonight that's right i don't mean to make any of you feel bad but you have not climaxed tonight by coming to service but rather you've come to get something to feed your soul so that it makes something it makes a difference for you on thursday and so we do not live to go to church we go to church to live and in coming to church we receive something that feeds us that sustains us and then pushes us out into society and that's where we want to make a difference and we want to and we want to touch people's lives and we want to we want to live for others because that's eternal life and those are just some of the themes that have been burning in our hearts over these last few months as we've ministered on this subject and so i want to go back to the verses we were in luke chapter 10 verse 34. and these are the verses that we were in last time and we took the journey of this samaritan how that he came to where he was and we looked at this process of him humbling himself and the contrast to the priest and the levite and we read where it says and he came and he went to him and bound up his wounds and in the process of binding up the wounds one of the elements to this or two of the elements was pouring in oil and wine and it says that he set him on his own beast and brought him to and in and took care of him we identified this as our personal responsibility our personal duty to love our neighbors as ourselves because jesus in answering the question of this lawyer well who is my neighbor he could have just told the story there was a man on the wayside and he was wounded and a priest went by him and he didn't do anything a levite went by him and he didn't do anything but the samaritan came by and he helped him and he could have just used very quick language to make the point but jesus is also identifying what it means to love your neighbor and so he went through these steps of how he came to where he was and he went down to him and he bound his wounds and he poured in the oil the wine he set him on his own beast and then brought him to an end and we're going to focus on that particular aspect to bringing him to an end and took care of him we all have an individual responsibility as christians to live for others amen and and and we could say this in one sense if all you can do is pray pray if all you can do is give give but say lord i want to live for others use me for your glory let me be your hand extended let me be your eyes let me be your very heartbeat let me do something for others and so we have a personal individual responsibility to live for others and the elements that is that is used in binding up the wounds of this wounded one this one who had been befallen by unfortunate circumstance he uses oil which brother bam types to the spirit and wine which he types as revelation and we looked at how that these must be our personal possession we must have the holy spirit we must have revelation and if we have the holy spirit in revelation then we can be effective witnesses if you don't have the holy spirit it's very difficult to testify of the holy spirit if you don't have revelation it's very difficult to testify of the word of god but being possessors of a new birth experience being possessors of revelation then it's the source from which we minister and then it also becomes the means by which we minister or the elements that we minister with we have the holy spirit to give we have the revelation to share and it so it not only becomes the very basis of your experience and the thing that inspires you but it's something that you can inspire with and minister with and it's those things that'll minister to people's wounds to the lost and the hurting and so we were looking at our individual responsibility to love our neighbors as ourselves to care to minister to be concerned for others and so the samaritan if you look at verse 35 he has brought this this man who is wounded and this man who was left half dead he brought him to an end and in taking him to the end this verse shows us that he didn't just drop them off but it says and on the morrow when he departed it means he was there with him in the inn he was there to look after him to care for him he brought him to a place that maybe he was familiar with but this man wouldn't be familiar with and he was there to help him acclimate he was there to meet his needs and then after he was when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host of the end and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spend us more when i come again i will repay thee now if we looked at this parable and now as christ affords us an example if christ is viewed as the good samaritan in this parable then we must put ourselves in his footsteps we must place ourselves in his example and realize that if christ acted as the samaritan in this example then there's some measure by which we have to live our lives as the samaritan so we must be sacrificial we must be a servant we must give as christ gave but if we look at this as christ now being the samaritan who brought the wounded one to the end it's then christ that commissions the inn and the keeper of the end to serve this wounded sick one so christ does his part to take care of him but now there's a commission and i want to view this as a commission to the church to look after to the lost to look after the wounded to look after the hurting and after the sick it's something you've been commissioned to do but he has not left you without resources he gives you the pence that you need to minister with we'd read this statement i believe last time and i want to do it again just to see this pattern that we just raised brother branham is preaching a sermon and he's talking about these converts those of you who've received the holy spirit and he's identifying them and he he shows these ministers that are standing nearby he says all these ministers here were all just exactly the same the bible believing filled with the holy spirit promoting the word of god and we want you to join their church so you can continue on he goes now they are the the good samaritan he says now the good samaritan has come by poured oil in the wound but he's took you now and he wants you to go to one of the ends here the closest to you listen christ wants you to go to church and i say those things on a wednesday night because you get like 100 amens when you say christ wants you to go to church and everyone's like yes amen we believe and so christ wants you to go to church there's a danger in not being in fellowship there's a danger not being part of a body a healthy body that can nurture you and that can fellowship with you and encourage you so he says he wants you to go under these ends here the closest to you he's done paid the pr the pastor to take care of you so he's paid and how has he paid and i believe this this should be viewed as things that the church has not just the pastor he's received the holy ghost got blessings of god and health and revelation so god has given gifts to men gifts to the church he's given blessings for your use and your benefit so when he says christ wants you to go to church because he's given the pastor he's given the innkeeper he's given them blessings and health and revelation it's not for the pastor it's not so he can look big and bad before the people but it's something he has as a servant to give out to others that they might be strengthened and they might be ministered to so he says they have the he has holy ghosts and blessings and health and revelation he can just feed your soul so you come now and join one of the churches and it'll be the best thing you can do to keep your spirit fed and moving on now if brother branham identifies this as one of the best things it'll be the best thing you can do to keep your spirit fed and moving on first we acknowledge that's because it's scriptural and then we also have to recognize then this is something that satan will fight against so satan is going to do everything he can to keep someone from going to church how we recognize it in our own personal lives he's going to do things to try to keep us from going and for those uh who maybe are in the practice in the habit of going there's certain things that intervene uh that keep us from being making different services and being as consistent as we would like and we are we're able to overcome that and we fight through it and we get back on track and that's because we have a desire to be in service and we recognize satan's fighting us but then there's a if i could just say this and i wasn't maybe anticipating saying it this early there's a lot of things about church that can keep people away from church you don't be that reason you should challenge i don't ever want to be the reason that someone doesn't want to go to church because if we're not careful we could be the very reason that people don't want to go to church and church is the reason why people are missing church why because church has become something that church shouldn't be so we should all as individuals labor and strive to create the right kind of atmosphere too to reach out in a particular way and have the right kind of attitude towards centers towards the loss to people maybe there might be people you that that come and visit the church and you may know him for years and like i've never really liked that person you are now being challenged to humble yourself find out why that's there and overcome it amen that's great because christ wants us to be welcoming brother branham says in jezebel religion he says remember the good samaritan that found the man wounded he brought him to the end and brother man says that's the church so we've already seen how in the prior quotation he says that the these pastors there they're in keepers they've been gifted with things they've been given things to look after those who are going to come to the end come to a church be a part of a church and brother brandon again here identifies the church as the n in the parable of the good samaritan so when we are commissioned to love our neighbors as ourselves then we have a resource available to us that oil and revelation the word the spirit and revelation we minister to our neighbors those that we come in contact with our family members but then we also have a place that we can invite them to come and in coming god continues the ministry continues the serving and continues to work to see that the person is not just told the truth but by the truth made free and made whole so it's not it's not all upon you and sometimes we do take that responsibility i'm trying to answer these questions and i'm trying to get this person to see and i've been witnessing to my co-worker and i've been witnessing to this person i've been trying to get them to see well god has a place that you can bring them and and you don't have to worry about what's preached and what's sung there's a there's a dynamic about this place about this inn where god will deal with hearts as he pleases and it's wonderful to be a part of a church where you're happy to invite somebody to it and i believe that we ought to be excited to invite people to witness of this great truth that we have and welcome them to church and you can literally tell them come to the end right because we're meeting in a hotel right now you could tell them come to the end come to a place brother says he brought him to the end that's the church and gave the man their two pence told him that if he needed any more he'd pay him when he come so he's got two pence he's able to doctor you up if he's a man of god if he's a man of god that stands on the word of god he's got what god gave him the spirit and the word so we're looking at this this dynamic of how we have this individual personal responsibility to live for others and we would do that outside of these four walls we would do that outside of our just going to church but then in coming but then and being a part of a body and part of a church we now as a church collectively have a responsibility to care for the ones that the individuals are ministering to so that we we help we assist we do we look into what we can do to help and we we provide by virtue of our church services a place of safety and a place of comfort where the lost the hurt in the wounded could come and be healed and it's our love for others then that would compel us to guide them to the end and we saw last time my brother says you you want to get in there put your shoulder to the wheel do all that you can and serve so we have a role that we play within the church we should be praying and asking god i would say not just even within the church but asking god show me my purpose show me my position let me do all that you want me to do amen and i believe that we all have a part to play with in the local assembly brother branham says in the message doors in door he says every door opened and and even in your heart oh just touch the little button and watch them all go right around the circle say come in lord jesus be my lord and all lord of my lord my all and he continues to sing oh let me from this day not let you stand at the door be holy thine and he says you that raised your hands and wants to be farther led towards the lord i ask you to go down to the revival of night tonight and i'm sure the pastor there would take you from here to the inn he has six pence whatever was given it was two pence to take care the oil and the wine to pour in he can finish the job and that's the function of the church not just the pastor because if the pastor could just finish the job then maybe just hey this is where i live give you my gate code or whatever you come come see me and you come to me and i'll finish the job but it's something we do as the body because it's something that the even a genuine pastor realizes you're not all here because of him he's here because of you right that's the only reason why a pastor is where he is is because there's people there that need ministry and so he is dependent upon the people he realizes the only reason why i'm here is because there's the people of god need to be ministered to and i'm a servant and i have a gift so god used this gift for the people's benefit and so it's not just the pastor because i don't believe churches should be pastor-centric it should be word-centric and christ-centric and so in reading this statement it's just merely to identify that we as a church have the elements and the dynamics to bring people to the end and be ministered to by jesus christ he says i'm sure he would take you here to end it speaks of the church and the church then is equipped to see that the job that christ started is finished because christ is going to do it he's going to finish it and he's asked us to be co-laborers with him in that process bill branham again i'm just using these statements to show that we as a church should identify ourselves in this parable of the good samaritan wherein the question is answered who is my neighbor and the question is answered what does it mean to love my neighbor as myself we are identified in this parable as the end in the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he talked about his meetings in bombay italy said recently excuse me bombay india recently there was no way of saying we couldn't get the churches to cooperate because of the cooperation we went under another church and some of the churches were down on them and that started the rest of them to down this group isn't that a shame just a shame but the people come anyhow amen it's such a it says it's such a bad thing if we can get the ministers to cooperate so that the man when he's converted he can have a church home to go to he says if you turn him back turn him back out into the devil's pig pen then he'll come right back again just like he was but if you've got a place that you can direct him to some good and then this is where he comes again to the end like jesus with the samaritan he taken him to the end he said the good samaritan taken the fallen man to the end he says we've got to have a place like that and i would encourage you to be in a place where you can do just that you you don't want to be you do not want to have the kind of experience where you drag yourself to church because you got to check that box because in the back of your head you know brother branham said that a believer will be there when the church doors are open it's like ah church doors are open i guess i need to be there but you want to have a place like brother branham's identifying here a place where you can send somebody to he says and you can have a church home to go to so it's not just a church it's a church home what is home what kind of what does it mean to have a home it's a place that evokes thoughts of safety and comfort and belonging in family in nurturing homes should not conjure up images of abuse and threatenings and manipulation and control homes should conquer conjure up images of warmth and safety something inviting something welcoming and we ought to be those that are identified in the scripture as a samaritan together with christ where we have a place that we can bring people to and it's all of our responsibility to have the right kind of attitude create the right kind of atmosphere to see that this can be a home church not just a church but a church home he says but you've got to have that place to direct somebody to he says we've got to have a place like that let it be our prayer as arizona believers church lord make this place like that make it a church home make it a place that even an end and we ought to be unselfish in this way lord even if it's an end that means it's a place that someone comes for a time to rest and be strengthened and then god would take them and place them somewhere else we can rejoice in that amen we can rejoice that even if before a season god would let our body minister to somebody and then he would take them and place them somewhere else use them for his glory somewhere else or put them in another place where they could be ministered to and taken further we rejoice in that amen oh god our prayer make us make us that kind of place brother bram says and god hath provided a way god hath provided a way all right at the way provided i might have missed a letter there in the title he says like the traveler that fell coming from jericho from jerusalem to jericho and they took him to the inn the little provided place and they poured some oil in and give some money and he got well let's i believe god this would be my my conviction and i don't like to share my my testimony or my conviction or my opinion but i will say this my conviction is this is a little provided place and maybe you can testify for yourself that god has given you some healing and poured in some oil and wine and been ministered too but this is our thought process as the church let us be a little provided place for the weary traveler let us be a place where people could come and hear the word of god preached and fellowship with others who have a christ-like spirit there's no judgment there's no condemnation there's no arrogance there's no belittling there's no elitism that comes with it that we've tore down walls of clicks and social constructs that separate people and god let us be a place where of whatever ethnicity whatever background whatever struggle whatever difficulty they have that it's not our dynamic personalities but it's the preeminence of christ that makes people feel welcome you may be somebody that's very wealthy and you can live luxuriously and you have uh nice things but if you're christ-like in your spirit then the poorest perfect person could come and rub shoulders with you and say that somebody that i like and somebody i can benefit from amen don't have to all have the same social background and the same opinions on certain things and all love to eat at ritos or all of us wear the same kind of clothes but it's the nature in the spirit of christ that becomes the magnetism that draws people so we don't try to just create a church where everyone dresses the same everyone acts the same and everyone does the same thing and everybody buys the same things because oh oh is that what he drives that's what i want to try oh that's where he that's where i want to eat but we so we don't want to all just become a commune where we all have things in common and that's what begins to bond people together but let it be the preeminence of christ that becomes a magnetism therefore all men all men can be drawn unto him a little provided place in the scripture romans chapter 15 verses 5 to 7 i hope this can i hope this could just mean something more to you though they're familiar but just kind of let it kind of strike you a little bit differently now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to christ jesus we ought to have the mind that he had and we ought to have the same attitude towards the center towards the weak towards the lost towards the hurting and even toward the the arrogant and blind we ought to have the same attitude towards them that we be like-minded one toward another according to christ so he's talking about our attitude towards others the way that we perceive others our knee jerk reactions to others he says that you may be with one mind in one mouth glorify god even the father of our lord jesus christ so there must be unity there must be harmony selfishness breaks unity selfishness builds walls makes you eat you could even be within a church very selfish and you just build walls around yourself and he says in verse 7 wherefore receive ye one another as christ also received us to the glory of god welcome one another be inviting to one another be hospitable to one another receive ye one another he says so we're welcoming we're being hospitable we're opening up ourselves to one another it says as christ as christ also received us whew there goes every excuse right as christ also he said what did he receive in your own arrogance and your own ignorance if we could maybe uh bring everybody into that fellowship maybe just not a couple of us but in your own weakness and sin and your own confusion and your hurting in your imperfection in your brokenness christ received you in your brokenness christ received you and your hurting christ received you in your confusion christ received you in the state that you were in when you turned and likewise we can as the church of god we can do as paul says receive you one another as christ received you i can take you as you are but i've got the goods and i've got something by a gift of god as a church as a believer i've got oil i've got wine i've got blessings i've got health i've got revelation you don't have to stay the way you are there's something that we've got where god can mend brokenness he can deliver he can set free we stand confidently as ones that bear this power bear this ex this ministry to see that others are saved and others are healed so brother brad i'm identified as the two pence healing and salvation we've got it do you have it you have it let me when i say we i'm not using the royal we as an eye i'm using we as in all of us who are here all of us who are part of this fellowship we have the bride of christ she has these things the healing and the salvation there's a beautiful type in there he says then if you need more this will i bring when i come the church has had healing and salvation but in this last days she needed something to take rapture in faith and he's come he's given us the more and the opening of the word to get us out of here it's just beautiful types contained in these scriptures now so he says we are to receive one another we're like minded towards one another according to christ and wherefore to be welcoming we're to be inviting to one another in hebrews chapter 13 verses 1 to 3. now i share this to challenge us because we're very quick to make certain calculations i had a brother share with me a very dear friend who said that he realized that he was very quick to assess somebody and essentially place a value on them and i realize i'm kind of using my own words right now and then very quickly determine just how much time he wants to invest in them i said the lord was just really shattering those notions of how quickly we just calculate these things and say well it's probably not worth the effort listen it's all worth it yes we use wisdom to not cast our pearl before swine and we use wisdom to not caustically share the gospel to condemn somebody and we want to use wisdom in the way that we share it and and we ask god to guide us and delete us but listen the efforts that you take to see that someone could just be delivered from something or they have a confusion a remedy and their lives just made better and made easier and our marriage restored it's worth every effort amen and not make some uh just some decision that well if it doesn't result in this it's not worth it it's worth it it's worth it to labor in hebrews chapter 13 verses 1 to 3 it says let brotherly love continue be not forgetful to entertain to invite to welcome and i believe in one place that says allow them to lodge and if we look at it as a church it will allow those to come and remain terry he says be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some of entertained angels unawares we can be very quick to kind of assess somebody and kind of get an idea well this is where i think they're at and this is what i think they're worth and the bible actually tells us to let brotherly love continue and be not forgetful to entertain strangers because you never know when it's an angel that you're ministering to and so then we have to we have to have this maybe as a constant reminder lord i don't ever i i never have license to mistreat anyone i know we've mentioned that many many times there's no place in the scripture where it says we're told be christ-like and be forgiving and be be uh be humble and serve and then it says except when this and then you can be unchrist-like are we always trying to figure out lord when it when when can i braid this whip i've been carrying this thing with me i want to know when i can flip over tables and toss out the money changers i want to know when i can do that let's not look for those opportunities let's look for opportunities to serve and humble ourselves and do what we can to render aid and and to minister to somebody because the bible's saying don't be afraid don't be forgetful to minister to one to tarry with somebody to give strength to them he says for thereby some have entertained angels unawares not even knowing but they've ministered to angels he said remember them that are in bonds as bound with them so now you're putting yourself in their shoes in them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body serve by putting yourself in their position if they're in bonds remember them that are in bonds as if you were in bonds with them those that are suffering adversity be as being also with them in the body that maybe just to bring it into current events maybe there's some of us who i heard that someone we knew or someone we loved had coveted 19 we said well we're praying for you and then you got it and then after that when you found out somebody says i'm praying for you why because you could empathize you could put yourselves yourself in their shoes and you're like hey man i'm praying a little bit differently than i was praying uh march through july i'm praying a little bit differently than i was before why because you have the ability then to empathize with what they're going through and paul is saying let's labor if we can to be empathetic if someone's in bondage of sin hey which one of you was it right so that we could pray for them as having been one that was bound let us never forget what we were right i was reading in the scripture in the god hiding himself in simplicity today and brother branham was talking about how there was no room for jesus at the end and we're going to at the end and we're coming to that here in a moment and he was saying there he was in a manure-filled barn and he's born in a manger and he's born in this and he's born in that and there's no room for him and he's turned out and rejected and he says but there's but he came it came to something later it's kind of what it refers to and and as christ comes to his glory and he comes to his majesty but we should never forget the origin of it how it begins in humility and may we never none of us ever forget what we've come from amen now remember our humble beginnings you say also i could always be beat over my head so that i could always be under the bondage of it so i could hover over me as a shadow no you look back on it victoriously you look back on it as being made more than a conqueror you look back at it as somebody says that is what i've been brought out of you're looking down at the pit you're looking down at what once tormented you and what's haunted you just as the scripture says the whole world the saved and redeemed will look back at satan and say this is what tormented us you're looking back as a conqueror and in looking back and remembering what you came from when you see somebody else who's befallen by the same thing you can then enter into ministry and do empathetic prayers say lord i know what they're going through amen i understand their pain their bondage and how they could be so overwhelmed with something and if we don't forget that we were there before then we could look on it with compassion instead of so typical they asked for it remembering them we can entertain angels unaware we need to receive one another be welcoming what does jesus say in matthew 25 40 because he said there's those that are going to enter into glory on at the day of white throne judgment i was going to say when i was hungry you fed me when i was sick you ministered to me when i was naked you clothed me when i was in bond you visited me and the people are going to go when when did we do that and he says in so much as you've done it under the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me do you realize then how that if there's those who are going to enter into life on that day for the way that they minister to the body of christ as brother brown uses the phrase that we're good to the bride then you realize we likewise have that responsibility that we're not just living for somebody we're not just uh when it says love thy neighbor as thyself and we think oh well i've got to do that to this unbelieving cruel you know and we go through all this list of reasons why we don't think we should love no you don't know who you're witnessing to you don't know who you're ministering to in so much as you've done unto these the least of my brethren you've done it unto me so we read last time brother says whatever you do to somebody you're doing it unto christ do you remember that whatever you do to somebody you're doing it unto christ if you lie about them you're lying about christ if you're hurtful towards them you're hurtful towards christ well brother aaron they've told me they don't believe the bible they flat out denied well i witnessed them about the message and they said it was a bunch of nonsense and i'm in a cult and they even cussed about brother branham and they said this about christ they did this and they did that whatever you do to them you're doing it unto christ i i almost feel like i could have just come tonight and just kind of shared that and played a game of telephone and made it go through make sure everybody got it and if we really sat there and pondered it we just like and we kind of all leave going i got to go home i mean it really really struck us the full weight of it washed over us and we'd be like i really owe that cashier at dollar tree an apology yeah i really oh that person in the drive-thru chick-fil-a an apology because whatever you do to them you're doing it unto christ would that not change everything you're on the phone with amazon customer support listen i'm telling you buddy you know wait a minute i'm talking to christ hold on if and you realize this is just maybe some best practices do you realize if you if you tell somebody i'm at your mercy i know you have control i know this is at your discretion i'm coming to you i'm asking you because i know you're the person who can help me that you just could completely change the dynamics so you're actually speaking to the one whatever you do to somebody you're doing to christ you're acknowledging your humble yourself to somebody on the other end of the phone and you're empowering them to get what you need done instead of saying hey listen buddy i've been buying from you guys for three weeks now you realize how much money i spent 23 and 40 cents and if you don't treat me right you're going to lose a customer buddy you're like so long bye-bye right they're just see ya not to scare anybody but you know why they have all these rewards programs they want to find out who's shopping and not making them money and i think one day the door's just going to be locked when we show up you're always buying on clearance and returning we don't want you in here anymore but coming back let's get back on track here just the season season of returning and giving i've often said if you don't believe in return ministry my wife has one but whatever you do to somebody you're doing it unto christ this ought to be instructive to us as i pondered these things and was coming i just loved how the the momentum of this came to this place as we identified the church as the end in this parable in luke chapter 2 as we read sunday here comes this season of what we now know to be we call it christmas season but in that time they were to come together to be taxed and as their as they are the days of uh mary's come accomplish to be delivered in verse seven luke chapter two verse seven she's with child and and joseph had to come uh to bethlehem it did to everyone had to come to his own city to be taxed and it says and there when she comes to the town and and the stories dramatized and told actually came across the statement where brother brown says i know everybody preaches this time of year that there's no room at the end he says so i'm going to go a different direction i thought wait a minute i was i want to mention that tonight and i didn't take it as a a big stop sign but it is common no room at the end no room at the end so we understand how it's dramatized that families are coming into the city and maybe being late to come for this time to be taxed they're going to end after inn and lodge after lodge and place after place and there's no place for joseph and his pregnant wife to lodge there's no place like there was even for the samaritan and the wounded man when he came in they would have had a bed and would have a place for them to sleep but it says that she brought forth her first born son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes garments that were fit for animal use and laid him in a manger this is not not a crib this is not a bed this is because there was no room for them in the inn now we realized that those in that day were not being told the messiah is she's carrying the messiah will you make room for them it wasn't put in those terms but yet we take from that the example that was said in the scripture and the type that christ is not always welcome there was no room he was not welcome there was no place made and this should challenge us as a church that as we are told that we should be like-minded one toward another receive you one another's christ receive you be not forgetful to entertain strangers because you may be entertaining angels and in so much as you've done unto the least of these my brethren you've done unto me we ought to be welcoming and inviting and create an atmosphere that others when they come they can be ministered to and helped and encouraged while they're here and we cannot do that unless christ is welcome there's a lot of effort made sometimes with in nominal christianity and modern bible churches to try to make a place real hip and real cutting edge and real welcoming to people so that they can feel like hey i this is this is groovy i like this i could get along with this this is i really like the cut of your jib pastor this is a place that i can get be comfortable in but they have not welcomed christ and the only way that we can make a church a place where difference can be made is if we welcome christ brother abraham says in the deity of jesus christ today the church has soup suppers pie suppers see who can dress the best go into the church for pomp glory who's the best church the best seats who can play this who can do that let it challenge us as a church that we never get into these these metrics and ways of judging things when we're looking at the amenities and the worship and the in the instrumentation and the syncopation of the choir and how fat they get on that in the bridge let's get all that out of our minds that's not what's going to make this church a difference maker if christ is going to be the one that's a difference maker soup suppers pie suppers who can dress the best go into the church for palm glory who's the best church the best seats who can play this who can do that and no room no room for who christ all the times they got all times they got something else to do besides prayer they can't pray anymore they got something else to do they can't pray anymore they just can't serve god like they used to no room for him in the inn and this is the end time friends no room for him in the end he says of course i know what that end meant but i've been referring to this end what is it about the church just as the church is the end and the parable of the good samaritan the church is represented here in luke chapter 2 verse 7. the end had no room for me says and he's now rebuking the church and challenging the church he says there's no room for him in the end i'm referring to this end and he makes a very very striking reference and if you want to go back and read it it's in ecclesiastes chapter 12. brother brahma is quoting verses five and six you can read those first several verses there at how there's um nothing better for a man and he's talking about the vanity of man and his labor and his work and what it ends up in and then brother man takes this and places it in his rebuke of the end but the bible said in that day when the almond tree shall flourish the desire of men shall fail because he goes to his long home and this is a phrase that was referring to death to the grave and the mourners go about the streets and the civil court be broken or the pitcher broke in the fountain we know brother brandon comes back later and refers to churches as being broken cisterns and the stagnant old stale traditional bound by ideas and and humanism the broken cisterns and he uses this scripture in references to churches being an end and it's speaking the scriptures are speaking of vanity and death and what is brother brown and i did define your church becomes one of these long rooms one of these broken cisterns where it's deaf there's no life to be given out there's no health there's no revelation there's no real ministering taking place because it becomes very staid very traditional very structured very rigid and it becomes very humanistic and when that happens christ is not welcome in christ not being welcomed there's not the life giver the health giver the savior and the healer there to do what he can do what a profound scripture for him to inject in this rebuke of the ends and i believe that we make christ welcome by making others welcome christ is welcome if we are welcoming to others our atmosphere must be christ-like creating the right kind of atmosphere as i read in luke chapter 24 in the beginning i'll narrow it down to verses 28 to 31. these disciples of christ are heartbroken and they're discouraged and they're walking along the road back home and christ draws near to him and he's like man why are you guys so sad why are you so gloomy they go man have you not heard are you a stranger have you not heard what happened about jesus and a man mighty of god and a man believed to be the messiah and after it's been three days since he's dead and now they go to the the tomb and he's empty and christ rebukes him oh fools and slow of heart why because he heard them rehearsing words back to him that he had spoken in three days told him that ought to have been things that clicked form things that happened they were going along discouraged he says and they drew nine to the village and he opened up the scripture to them and espounded to them christ says they drew not into the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further what is that it's kind of it's it's a situation where it's kind of like uh well i'm not really interested i'm gonna keep going you guys you guys have fun i'm not interested you guys go you guys can go in i'm not really interested but then it says but they constrained him saying abide with this for it is toward evening now brother brahm takes this and we often think that it's that we use it as their house and this is one of these disciples homes and he goes in and this is the this is where one of them would have lived but brother branham takes it in several places and he says this was an inn that they were coming into for the night because it was getting too late and they had a longer journey and they needed to stop for the night so as the night was coming on they say abide with first towards evening the day is far spent and and it's we can't keep traveling now now is the time to stop and because they constrained him and said remain with us carry with us you know why don't you stay tonight with us let's come in let's carry together tonight says and he went into terry with him he kind of acted like he didn't want to go but they weren't they weren't happy with that with that they wanted more they wanted to implore more they wanted to take the extra step and they constrain him they'll abide with this terry and it came to pass as he sat at meat with him he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and how was it this very how was it it came to this place this would not have happened had he said no i'm not i you know i'm good i'm going to keep going and they said all right your loss right their eyes would have never been opened they would have never had a message to go to the eleven and those that were with them and say he's risen and appeared to simon they would have still been just as confused and even more confused like man that was amazing this guy just talked to us and all these scriptures it was remarkable but when they came when he constrained them to stay in the inn come abide with us tarry with us it's then that there was this fellowship that happened and in the breaking of the bread he was made known to them in the placing of the word of god and brother branham says and who is this melchizedek but still they never recognized it all day long they walked with with you and still didn't know you but night come they constrained you to come in and when they went into the little end and closed the doors then you did something just the way you did before your crucifixion and they recognized it was the risen christ he said in another place those very words it wasn't until they came into the inn it says when you when they came into the little inn and closed the doors that's where the revelation was opened up to him in the message when their eyes were opened they knew him notice here's the thing to do the next thing we find out they invited him to come in he got to the little place the little end where they were going to stay it was towards the evening and they said oh come and abide with us he made out like he was going on past oh i thought that many times he's only wanting you to invite him he made out like he would pass them on by he might make out like he's going to pass you by sister in the wheelchair or you sir in the cod are you out there with heart trouble that can't live but just a little while longer these people are perhaps crippled they might live an ordinary lifetime but somebody out there with heart trouble might die before the morning might die before tomorrow he might act like he's going to pass you by but he's only wanting you to invite him that's what he's wanting you to do it might even seem like god you're straying a little bit but it's one he's like jesus oh god come to my defense come to my aid come to my need he's wanting you to invite him to welcome him i i just this this thought keeps coming in my mind as i was looking at this on the parallel paths we want to welcome christ we'll invite christ he may seem to want to pass us by but we're compelling lord no come that's why we come 30 minutes early because we're praying lord come visit us today and we're praying for those that we know have needs we're praying for those that we don't need something oh god be mighty god come and step upon the scene lord do use use the song service lord be with the minister who as he preaches you say oh lord i know he has a tendency to veer off this way so lord you just take them bind them close to the burden that you've given them and we're praying and we're creating an atmosphere and we're welcoming and we're inviting it's the very purpose for song service to wash our conscience to create an atmosphere to let the holy spirit come by because we want to welcome christ so he can what break bread and in the breaking of bread be made known to us but then there's also on the along the same path we're wanting to welcome others we're wanting to be inviting we want to be something that compels someone to say this is a place where i know i can get something that i need and here recently i was fellowshipping with a young man and i i said to him as he was talking and he was asking questions and i said well um why don't you why don't you take my number down and if you want to ever reach out or i'll come visit the church you know you could you could come and the conversation just continued and i was like well i'm not gonna i'm not going to say well don't you want my number it's a really catchy one zero one two three i mean you you might really like it but i just uh i thought well we just continued to open up and witness and and share some things and then all of a sudden he just said can i have your number i want to go to church and i could have taken offense right there at the beginning i could have been like oh you don't want my number well i got to go right but there was like there was a constraining there was a change he made as though he didn't really matter to him and sometimes it could be that with people i'm not interested i don't know but let's not just be so quick to give up if you know somebody's hurting you know somebody's lost you know you've got the more that they're looking for you know you've got something that can minister to their needs don't be so quick to just let them go but say oh god let me tariff with them let me constrain them tell them come abide come to the end that you can get what you need says you might act like he might act like he's going to pass you by but he's only wanting you to invite him you might think well he's healed so and so the other day last month two years ago i sing yeah he might act like he's going to pass you by but he's only wanting you to invite him he makes out like he's going to pass what he was then he is today what he does then he does today he said so notice you must do the same thing you've got to invite him in it was then and only then that he could reveal himself i said it was then and only then yes the journey was important yes it laid a tremendous foundation but when they constrained him to come into the end to come into the place where the word could be rightly divided was then then that he revealed himself and it's instructive to us to invite him invite them into your family situation invite them into your work situation invite him into your health needs invite him welcome him he's waiting to be invited in christ let me say this christ needs to be welcome here in this physical gathering in our church in our fellowship he needs to be welcome and as if as we make christ welcome and we welcome others we are not inviting people to a church experience if you want a church experience there's better church experiences out there they've got a lot more programs a lot better things to offer a lot better light show right you know a lot more you know hip hip acquire and worship bands and everything there's this there's a lot of church experience out there you can get better but what you want is you don't want people to have a church experience do you want them to have an experience with christ and it's our attitude it's our expectation that we have when we come to church we come to church and we're just it's our expectation that creates an atmosphere it's our vision what we come wanting to accomplish what we're trying to do all that projects christ to the people if we're humanistic if we're carnal if we're bitter if we're upset and and there's grudging and all different things if there's the wrong motive and objective then we come we're projecting that and people will come and visit be like yeah i just didn't feel welcome and then we're very quick to be like well that just kind of shows what they're made of all right let's let's let's challenge ourselves if we're ever rebuked if we're ever corrected if anyone who even is an unbeliever ever has something negative to say to us let's first examine ourselves before god and say god was it warranted amen did i give them reason to believe that i would lie did i give them reason to believe that i didn't have their best interest in mine oh god let it not be true what they had to say about me be amazing what you can accomplish when you can humble yourself to somebody and say i'm sorry and they're like oh i kind of have expected you to really let me have it what's the goal that they could see christ our attitude our expectation the way we behave it projects christ to people so we must create a welcoming atmosphere for christ we must create that kind of atmosphere for christ and for those who need him brother braham says in the message god hiding himself in simplicity now i think it's our duties talking about the church and the remodeling of the church and how beautiful the church was and how nice it had become he says now i think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of god whose duty is it it's your duty your duty your duty to make the inside right with the inside the atmosphere the the the the way people feel the way people interact he says it's our duty we have that duty we say oh lord i showed up at church i'm here i'm 30 minutes early where two or three are gathered in my name there you'll be in the midst you come on do it lord make it dynamic make it inviting make it welcome you know it's our duty to do it amen by humbling ourselves he says this will just not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic of jesus christ in every person that comes in that's what we dress ourselves in before we walk through that door lord let me be let me portray the beautiful characteristic of jesus christ we don't know who's going to be visiting us today lord i don't know who's going to be coming amongst us i don't know who i might run into in the foyer i don't know who i might come in contact with after church but lord may i be dressing in the beautiful characteristic of jesus christ that everyone who sees me will see something different be salty may it be a consecrated place to our lord a consecrated people let us be a provided people in a provided place but they're going to call the end the little provided place i want to be a little provided person in that little provided place he says maybe a consecrated place to our lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people amen i trust it'll always be a house of god of beauty by what the character of the people brother branham says and god provided way for this god's provided way for this day did that resonate with you the beauty of the church is the character of the people and it's our duty to make the inside right where christ would feel welcome god's provided way for this day it says remember the education wouldn't be the instrument to lead them to god's provided place and he's usually the example and he comes to hear a second how those ducks how when they when they go to hibernate when they go to uh to to migrate at a particular season that there's an instinct in the leadership education wouldn't be the instrument to lead them to god's provided plays the instrument they have is instinct them ducks know that the instinct will take them to god's provided place so does the holy spirit take the church to god's provided place now the reason why this quote struck me to be used here is to challenge the idea that if i have portrayed it all in my enthusiasm for inviting people to church and my enthusiasm for saying that this inn is a place that people could come to receive healing and salvation if in any of that it has gotten out of balance to seem that i'm making arizona believers church and wherever they gather and that church something special about that place about the building or about the about the fact that it is a church and make church more preeminent than the christ that the church serves and the christ that the church is welcoming and the christ that the church is ministering this quote helps orient us again to realize this is we are not a church-centric people we are a christ-centered people and it's christ that draws us to worship it's christ that we're gathering around it's christ that has the preeminence really honestly seriously if it was just about church go to any church why people think we're crazy when they say you drive how far go church how many churches did you pass on your way to that church like are they not all preaching christ are they all lifted up he said but no no it's not just about church it's a church home it's a place i belong it's a place where christ is welcome and i'm a part of what god is doing i'm there with a vision and a purpose so he says god's instinct will bring them to god's provided place he says so does the holy church hold excuse me the holy spirit take the church to god's provided place not to join a church but to be filled with his presence to see his word made manifest vindicated that's god's provided way for the church always so this is this is commissioning us this is setting us straight this has given us the right kind of purpose and vision for the people this is god's provided way for the church always for the people to bring them to the place that god has provided for them that's exactly what the church should be today all right catch it we are not the place that god has provided to bring them but we are placed so that we can bring people to his provided place which is christ so that's the function we have if it was just a matter of getting people to church let's just all come up with some kind of gimmick some kind of giveaway some kind of raffle some kind of lottery everybody right now look under your seat if you have the number seven you just got a 700 gift card to anthropology and we just all finds all sorts of ways to get people to want to be there but what we do as a church is we take people god's provided way for the church is to bring others to the place that god has provided for them that's exactly what the church should be today the church is responsible for lifting up christ preaching the word so that others find their place and if that means god leads them to another church we rejoice if that means god uses them for his glory somewhere else we rejoice because this isn't the ultimate placing it's in christ that we receive our ultimate placing that's right it is our responsibility to bring them to the place that god has provided not a pew i believe that christ has given us as i said christ has given us those two pence healing and salvation to serve with to minister with to lift up christ that's the right way for a church to grow brother branham says in the message letting off the pressure i hope that that can serve as a balancing i don't want to ever get out of balance in in expressing this we should go to church we have to have a home church brother i said it very plainly a few places you can't stay at home and be a christian you just can't so we realize this there's something about this that the word is sanctioned the word is blessed but if you get it out of balance you're not going to be the right kind of christian in the message letting off the pressure he says the waves can beat and baffle and sickness can come death can come anything else but you're safe evermore christ our refuge god's provided place of safety i i'm reading this to back up how brotherhood says that god's provided way for the church is to bring them to a place that god has provided for them that's exactly what the church should be today this is the place this is the place where we lead this is our per our responsibility as a church is to bring people to this place of safety christ our refuge god's provided place of safety christ is the only place of safety for those who wants to live he's the only one that has eternal life there's no church no denomination no president no king no pope no bishop no minister nothing can give you safety but jesus christ therefore we do not have at our disposal the threat that if you leave here you're going to be lost no if you leave christ there's your danger that's when you're going to lose everything nothing can give you safety but jesus christ he's the only place that can give you safety and he's god's provided safety oh we can provide this and provide that and it'll fall but when god provides anything it's eternal and that's god's provided way for our safety in christ i love it when you're in him when troubles come like sickness or worry disappointment he bore our sorrows with his stripes we're healed everything that we have needed for the rest of our journey is right here in the refuge we don't even point to our own healing our own salvation what does brother branham say it's remarkable when you listen to those tapes in the early years brother says i'm no healer i can't heal you and when he begins to talk like that some people be like you brought me here you told me this guy was a healer the reason why i'm here holding this pair of cars this guy is a healer he said i couldn't do nothing to heal you i'm no healer i'm no i don't do that and they're like wait a minute we're all here because you're the healing goes no it's christ that heals you i'm just to serve and i can just stand here and pray for you i can just do what he tells me i can just stand by the word of god right it's letting christ have the primes letting the word have the preeminence and a church doesn't brag that it's got what you need to finish the job but it realizes that in christ everything that we have needed for the rest of the journey is right here in the refuge and when the churches welcome christ the refuge into its midst it can say we know the one who can carry you who can heal you who can strengthen you who can encourage you who has what you need i want to close with this statement this statement is just so challenging to me he says god let us take the opportunity while it's presented to us they are depending on us they left their word the word of god that was shown to them and it brings to mind that they without us could not be made perfect in this procession of believers through centuries and how they did their part and when they died they passed the baton of the word of god but then he says they're depending on us to carry it out you're running the last leg you're going to be the ones that cross the finish line he says jesus come to confirm it and to send the holy spirit to continue the work and to give us power to work by till these things be all finished and then the great ransom church of the living god be caught up to meet him there are some here today listen to his prayer oh god may it just become something that we can be captivated by listen to the prayer of this prophet there are some here today father who do not have this blessed restful hope in their souls may this be the day that they will receive it he says there may be those here who've grown weary in the way let them know lord that we never come to a picnic but to a battleground you fight every inch of the way he says give them courage strengthen them amen well i think we've already pointed it out here before it wouldn't just smack them upside the head you know better than that you know pull yourself up by your bootstraps buddy you didn't this is what you think this message was a picnic no it's empathizing right but think about those that have been grown weary in the way give them courage strengthen them there's some here that's been wounded lord the enemy has shot darts of sickness into their bodies and afflictions there are warriors there are warriors laid here on the battlefield that would be up and going if they could listen catch this catch this warriors laying on the battlefield warriors these are my words now in case someone is just listening these are my wires that might even be see me laying out of church warriors who are not where they used to be or where they know they should be or where we think they ought to be warriors that are wounded scattered wounded sheep all over here they are lame wounded and they would be gupping going if they could but they must be taken to the end where the caretaker is to take care they must be taken to the end you can't just do a facebook campaign and hope they get the message or have a church no he says there's got to be something they need somebody they must be taken to the end with their caretakers to take care father may the ambulance of god carry them to a real genuine faith this afternoon granite lord lord let me be an ambulance driver if there's a wounded warrior out there there's wounded sheep there's somebody who's scattered somebody who's hurting and they would be here if they could lord let me go and take them let me go and take them to the end where they can be ministered to there may be those here who've grown weary in the way warriors laying in the battlefield but they must be taken to the end we're there to be taken care of may you be inspired may you be inspired to love your neighbor as yourself recognizing your individual responsibility the collective responsibility that we have as a church and say lord we in welcome you we invite you let's stand to our feet tonight sister cassandra if you'd come you could play that song in the key of seat actually i think i see it sing in the key of f turn your eyes upon jesus can we do a little [Music] self-examination tonight i i'm not going to apologize but i will at least acknowledge that it might not have been as festive as some of us wanted and that when the jingle bells and the balls of holly and maybe we thought we'd all just gather around tonight with our hot cocoa and some marshmallows and talk about the birth of christ and i even realized the way that i could try to characterize it that this was really hard and cutting but i will say this i know it is challenging but i sense it's something you welcome that there's actually a joy that's quickened within your heart to be challenged in this way because you're up for it i believe you're up for it and i believe you're capable of being the bearers of christ's presence so let us as we pray let us ponder as we bow our heads even now as i like to go to the lord in prayer say lord i want to do my part let me be a little provided person in this little provided place god is shaping us to minister god is establishing us to welcome wounded to minister to the hurting god is establishing us to be prepared to not be turned off to not be uh i have the wrong kind of reaction knee-jerk reaction to situations and circumstances god is preparing us now so let's say the lord i'm a willing vessel lord here i am use me for your glory lord strip away all pride and all prejudice all bias all pretense opinions that build barriers and habits that push people away and instincts that are that are offensive oh god do a work in me i'm a willing vessel and as you're standing there tonight with your heart lifted up to him let's welcome christ let's do it as a church lord we're dedicating ourselves as brother braham said it may be a consecrated church and a consecrated people let's even consecrate as we will be gathering in these in this room lord we consecrate this room to you we consecrate this podium and the table and the piano the instruments the chairs we consecrate our equipment we consecrate our hearts we're consecrating this place we consecrate ourselves as individuals may this be a consecrated place and a consecrated people that others will see christ oh maybe i maybe i should apologize for not expressing it sooner that we should be consecrated we should be consecrated to him for his cause and his purpose let us pray our gracious heavenly father lord we consecrate ourselves to you now lord consecrated at this christmas time consecrated with a purpose consecrated with the commission to love our neighbors as ourselves lord may we not seeking to justify ourselves narrow the definition of who our neighbor is but may it be whoever we come in contact with we will treat them as if we are treating christ we will to do to them what we would do to ourselves lord i pray tonight as we have willing hearts here who are up for the challenge as we yield ourselves may the sweet holy spirit come now and strengthen them and encourage them those that have grown weary in the way the wounded warriors laying upon the battlefield lord may you come take them take them tonight those who've gathered here at the end those that are streaming the service lord take them with this ambulance to real genuine faith lord strengthen us that we might be your servants lord we don't always want to be in the hospital bed so our prayer is as you're witnessing to us and ministering to us in strength and said lord i want to be on the battlefield for you lord i want to be an ambulance driver one day lord i'm inspired by how the sister reached out and prayed for me i'm inspired how this brother took his time for me here i am lord i'm wounded i'm being ministered to i'm being witness to but my desire is to not always remain in the bed but lord i want to go do likewise so i pray lord that you would take a hold of us for your glory heal our wounds and our scars our complexes and our fears dress us up pour in the oil and the wine take us who are hurting who've been wounded who've been bruised scattered but yet collected together here this evening and heal us up and strengthen us and encourage us because lord we're eager to go back out on the battlefield made me no longer wounded but lord sensitive because of our scars and knowledgeable because of our past to do great battle for your kingdom and i pray that you consecrate us consecrate this room lord may there be a hedge about it we bind spirits that we try to defile it we pray that it would be a place consecrated and preserved till sunday lord [Music] father i pray for that you would reach those that you've ordained us to reach lord let us be willing to be hospitable and welcoming and inviting [Music] lord i pray we see souls saved restored ones i pray for it lord we collectively as a church believe that it will be bless us tonight as we worship as we're soon dismissed lord thank you for your precious presence that's been with us in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen
