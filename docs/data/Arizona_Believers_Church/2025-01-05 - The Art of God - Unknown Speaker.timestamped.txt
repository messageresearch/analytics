[0:00] Genesis 1 verse
[0:03] 1 and the uh title slide should give
[0:07] some uh might begin to tip off a little
[0:09] bit or give foreshadow some of the
[0:12] things that it's in my heart to address
[0:13] and to look at this is the uh creation
[0:17] of Adam very popular uh piece of art in
[0:21] the cine Chapel by
[0:23] Michelangelo and uh you do have to do
[0:25] some creative cropping Genesis chap 1
[0:29] verse 1
[0:30] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[0:33] and the Earth in the beginning God
[0:36] created the Heaven and the Earth amen
[0:39] you may be
[0:45] seated I'm going to give a title uh to
[0:47] today's sermon the art of God and it
[0:51] might be a little difficult to see uh
[0:55] and but the title is the art of God and
[0:59] and seeing the title slide and then now
[1:01] see in in the text slide you can already
[1:03] begin to see maybe what my emphasis is
[1:06] and fellowshipping on this with
[1:08] different ones over the past while and
[1:10] mentioning that I would the Lord was
[1:12] dealing with my heart on Art and artwork
[1:14] and I find that I'm a great have great
[1:17] admiration for art an artist and art
[1:19] work and myself not being one and kind
[1:22] of being a poser myself and wishing uh
[1:25] that I could be I I appreciate those who
[1:27] are and who are gifted and have those
[1:29] talents that God has given them and as I
[1:32] was fellowshipping on this subject and
[1:35] kind of sharing my heart on what my
[1:37] overall Vision was somebody asked well
[1:40] uh where is that in the Bible and not
[1:42] maybe in a cynical sense but like where
[1:43] are you going to go scripturally and I
[1:45] just said in the beginning God created
[1:48] and so we'll come to that here in the
[1:50] beginning uh just to begin to amplify
[1:52] that but I believe as I've been uh as
[1:55] I'm wanting to look at the subject of
[1:57] art that there is a
[2:01] that Supreme art is the setting forth of
[2:05] true things that are true and that there
[2:07] is a uh with the art that I'm thinking
[2:11] about something that sets forth a
[2:12] statement of not just fact but a
[2:14] reality and I was impressed with as I've
[2:18] just being a lover of Art and studying
[2:20] art over the last few years I've been
[2:21] impressed with how art was used in
[2:23] spreading truth in particular the gospel
[2:27] but also spreading falsehood and how
[2:30] that there is a there was a certain
[2:31] dependency in certain periods of people
[2:33] on art to be able to experience a
[2:35] reality or to know that a reality was so
[2:39] we live in a day and age where we can
[2:40] live stream it and we can see things and
[2:43] believe that because it's on video or
[2:45] because it was on the news it happened
[2:47] we're also now entered into a day and
[2:48] age where anything can be faked H to the
[2:52] to the extent that you could see
[2:53] something on video with your own eyes it
[2:56] it's it's a fabrication of something
[2:58] that never happened so we've
[3:00] transitioned out of relying solely maybe
[3:02] on a a graphic rendering by an artist to
[3:04] say this is what Mount Everest looks
[3:06] like to being able to see it for
[3:08] ourselves in video to now not being sure
[3:11] whether or not that is what it purports
[3:12] to be and so it's a really fascinating
[3:14] time that we're living in now and this
[3:17] dependency of in the past ages of people
[3:21] to on art to experience and to know and
[3:24] to understand things uh and to even know
[3:27] that certain realities exist it really
[3:28] fascinated me so as I'm kind of just
[3:30] sharing my heart on the outset of what
[3:32] was how God was dealing with my heart I
[3:35] began to think about how that there is
[3:38] something we I would like to use the
[3:40] theme of art if I could say it that
[3:43] way and the Art of God and the concept
[3:46] of Art and artwork and
[3:48] creativity and how that we there is an
[3:51] expression of Truth in reality so it's
[3:53] that premise that an artist is trying to
[3:55] render something whether it be false
[3:57] reality or true reality or Express
[3:58] something and how that God the art of
[4:01] God is about God expressing truth and so
[4:04] I could just put it that way and then
[4:06] always remember the premise is the full
[4:09] manifestation of the word of God has got
[4:10] to be expressed in this hour for a
[4:13] Rapture so it's not just without a basis
[4:15] or a vision I'd like to begin by reading
[4:18] from the Masterpiece if anybody would
[4:19] like a listening list just feel free to
[4:21] reach out to myself or my wife I'd be
[4:23] happy to provide those things to you but
[4:25] in the Masterpiece brother brandham says
[4:28] one of the main things that interest me
[4:30] in Forest Lawn was Michelangelo's the
[4:33] great sculpture the Monument of Moses
[4:35] found a photograph uh from 1929 when
[4:39] they I think it was at the very
[4:40] inauguration of the beginning of this
[4:42] display I think it's still there now uh
[4:45] but just set up a little bit differently
[4:46] it says brother says it's a reproduction
[4:48] there of course it isn't the original
[4:51] but with such a great Masterpiece so
[4:53] here's a reproduction of an original and
[4:56] brother BR saying it's not the
[4:57] reproduction that's a masterpiece but
[4:59] the repr production uh is a
[5:01] representation of the original that was
[5:04] a great Masterpiece brother Bram having
[5:06] the opportunity says and as I stood and
[5:08] looked at it I like that something that
[5:10] looks like it or represents got
[5:12] something to it and he's this uh there's
[5:16] many statements to this effect goes I
[5:17] like art real well I believe God is in
[5:21] art and if your name is Art you can
[5:22] really just drill down on this and just
[5:24] believe with all your heart he says I
[5:26] like art real well I believe God is in
[5:28] art let me just say this if you want to
[5:30] find all the places in the Bible and the
[5:32] message of the hour where art is
[5:34] mentioned you're in for a long
[5:37] day because thou art a God and there's
[5:40] so many different Arts but I've read
[5:42] every single instance in the message and
[5:44] in the Bible of the use of Art and uh
[5:47] and I'm better off having done it
[5:49] brother says I like art real well I
[5:51] believe God is in art I believe God is
[5:53] in music I believe God is in nature God
[5:55] is everywhere he says and anything
[5:58] that's contrary to the original is a
[6:00] perversion so there is this concept of
[6:03] the art of God and that God is in art
[6:06] and that God is also in music and he's
[6:08] in nature and there's certain things in
[6:11] nature and in music and even in one
[6:12] place he refers to dancing in this
[6:14] context and things that we would say are
[6:16] the Arts that are original that are pure
[6:19] that were designed by God or inspired by
[6:22] God but then there are things that are
[6:24] knockoffs or replications or some sort
[6:26] of cheap reproduction that is a pervert
[6:29] version of the original or contrary to
[6:32] the original so it could be something
[6:34] that uh is not the original but is some
[6:37] sort of simulation of it but then the
[6:39] worst thing is something that is
[6:41] slightly different in a perversion of it
[6:44] and it's this statement that I believe
[6:46] God is in art and brother bam says in
[6:48] different ways that God is in art he's
[6:51] he's in it not all of it but he is in
[6:54] this and in Genesis 1:1 I want to begin
[6:58] to look at God as the original artist
[7:01] the original creative it says in the
[7:03] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[7:06] Earth I've used a a painting of a
[7:09] Russian Ivan avazi who painted this
[7:14] scene that he calls the creation God in
[7:17] the beginning creating he has another
[7:18] one that's about the chaos in verse two
[7:20] it's really really beautiful pictures
[7:22] but it says in the beginning God created
[7:24] the Heaven and the Earth this means he
[7:26] shaped it he formed it he fashioned it
[7:29] and it would be as we might say a Potter
[7:31] or a builder Creator one that's using
[7:34] material and creating fabricating and
[7:36] representing something shaping it
[7:38] forming it using these artistic and
[7:41] creative abilities but one things that's
[7:43] remarkable God is he didn't use any
[7:45] existing substance he was using he was
[7:48] the creator himself in Hebrews 11:3 it
[7:52] says through faith we understand that
[7:54] the worlds were framed by the word of
[7:57] God so that things which are seen were
[7:59] not made of things which do appear God
[8:02] created by his word and in creating by
[8:05] his word he brought forth everything
[8:06] that was in the original creation and he
[8:09] was not using some other man's material
[8:11] or some other existing civilization's
[8:13] material he was using creative of things
[8:16] he created himself brother Brandon when
[8:18] he's referring to the seven Church ages
[8:21] and how God built a church through seven
[8:22] Church ages he said when God started off
[8:25] like an artist drawing a picture of
[8:27] something he begins to feel in his parts
[8:30] and you can be you can begin to see it
[8:32] shape up and that's what artists will do
[8:35] I don't claim to be one but I've watched
[8:36] some do their work and they'll start
[8:38] with the sketch and they begin to fill
[8:39] in and if you ever watch a video on how
[8:41] to learn to draw they make it look so
[8:43] easy like oh I just need to do a little
[8:45] half circle there just do a little line
[8:47] here and just do a little thing there
[8:48] and just start to fill everything in and
[8:49] then you look and like what is this I'm
[8:52] the next Picasso or dolly or something
[8:54] CU looks nothing like the original but
[8:56] yet there's that's what God was doing in
[8:58] the building of a church he was like an
[9:00] artist drawing a picture and there's
[9:02] different things that begin to uh form
[9:04] and then he begins to fill it all in and
[9:06] that's how an artist will work as they
[9:08] know just with the right order and the
[9:10] right way to place things together so in
[9:12] the beginning when God began to create
[9:14] he was doing the same thing he was
[9:15] drawing a picture putting Parts in their
[9:18] place and then filling things in that
[9:19] they begin to shape up in Genesis 1: 14
[9:23] to 15 says and God said let there be
[9:26] lights in the firmament of the heaven to
[9:28] divide the day from the night let there
[9:30] be for signs and for seasons and for
[9:32] days and years and let them be for
[9:35] lights in the firmament of the heaven to
[9:36] give light upon the Earth and it was so
[9:40] so I'm using this picture of Van Go Star
[9:43] night this is it represents the stars
[9:46] and the planets and the the things a
[9:48] very impressionist replication of the
[9:51] the night sky in other words this is not
[9:53] how it looked but it was the how it
[9:55] impressed him he drew it kind of in the
[9:57] way that he observed it and things he
[9:58] saw in it but he's depicting the the
[10:01] night sky with its stars and its planets
[10:03] these are the lights that God begin to
[10:05] bring forth when he said let there be
[10:07] lights in the heavens and let it the
[10:10] lights of the heaven give light upon the
[10:11] Earth and we know that God is writing
[10:14] his first Bible so as he begins to place
[10:16] these planets and these stars and their
[10:18] alignments in different places he's
[10:20] using the sky as a canvas to write a
[10:23] Bible it's as a work of art by an artist
[10:27] in Psalms 33:6 it says by the word of
[10:30] the Lord were the heavens made and all
[10:32] the host of them by the breath of his
[10:35] mouth God as an artist one a writer is
[10:39] writing a story in the skies there he's
[10:42] putting something up there as we might
[10:44] say in the Zodiac and different
[10:45] constellations and man is not just
[10:48] looking at him saying hm I see this
[10:50] shape but it's God by Design was putting
[10:52] things there in Psalms 19: 1-6 and
[10:57] brother bram's the one that makes
[10:58] reference to the Zodiac beginning with
[11:00] the Virgin and ending with the lion and
[11:02] different things how there's not that we
[11:04] would sell out to a religion of
[11:05] astronomy in astrology but that there's
[11:08] certain types and things that exist
[11:09] within that he says the heavens declare
[11:12] the glory of God and the firmament
[11:14] showeth his handiwork God being the one
[11:17] that created it the artist that unfurled
[11:19] the canvas and then begin to place the
[11:22] stars and the lights within the heavens
[11:24] he was doing it and it declares his
[11:26] glory and it shows his artistry his
[11:30] artwork and then about this artwork
[11:32] notice just what it represents and what
[11:34] this writing of the Bible signifies
[11:36] there is no speech nor language where
[11:38] their voice is not heard words it's it's
[11:41] a declaration throughout all the world
[11:43] their ly is gone out through all the
[11:45] Earth and their words to the end of the
[11:47] world you see how the Bible was written
[11:49] first in the stars in them hath he set a
[11:52] tabernacle for the
[11:54] son which is as a bridegroom coming out
[11:56] of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong
[11:58] man to run a race his going forth is
[12:01] from the end of the heaven and his
[12:03] circuit unto the ends of it and there's
[12:05] nothing hid from the heat thereof what
[12:08] do the heavens declare they tell his
[12:10] story not history but it declares his
[12:13] story it's setting forth certain uh it
[12:16] portrays his vision there's
[12:17] foreshadowing there's symbolism in it
[12:20] it's reflecting back his plan to have a
[12:22] a bridegroom and a bride it shows his
[12:25] purposes of death burial and
[12:27] Resurrection it's all represented there
[12:28] and it tells a story in the heavens and
[12:31] these creations from in the beginning
[12:33] God created to God saying let there be
[12:36] and God bringing forth the land and God
[12:38] writing his Bible in the skies these are
[12:40] the art of
[12:42] God it's part of a whole Masterpiece of
[12:44] God's
[12:46] creation and then in verse
[12:49] 27 Genesis 1: 27 it says so God created
[12:54] man in his own image in the image of God
[12:59] created he him male and female created
[13:02] he
[13:03] them now this is the bringing forth in
[13:07] the creation of Adam and when God
[13:10] creates Adam as you see very in
[13:12] particular here in this scripture he
[13:13] says God is now he's created heaven and
[13:16] earth and he's created land and animals
[13:18] and sky and firmaments and all these
[13:21] things and things in the sea and things
[13:23] on land and there's this great beautiful
[13:25] uh creation that the Creator is
[13:29] expressing himself in in terms of his
[13:32] vision his desires he writes the Bible
[13:34] in the sky but now notice what this
[13:36] artist has done is he's now made man in
[13:39] his own image and God is God is bringing
[13:42] forth a
[13:44] self-portrait I want you to think of it
[13:46] that way God is bringing forth a
[13:47] self-portrait God's an artist who's been
[13:50] creating this beautiful Artistry but now
[13:53] he paints himself in mankind and this
[13:56] picture is a perfect picture
[13:59] I don't know if I'm able to control this
[14:01] maybe we've lost
[14:06] it ah we're on we're
[14:09] good and in creating a
[14:12] self-portrait this is one of the first
[14:15] self-portraits that show really how it's
[14:17] done and this Johan's Gump I think is
[14:20] his name shows that as an artist he
[14:23] would look in a mirror and he would
[14:25] paint himself on the canvas his face
[14:27] that he would see in a mirror so so
[14:29] before there were
[14:30] mirrors self-portraits are really hard
[14:32] to
[14:33] find and so this is this is one that
[14:36] shows I want you to think about this in
[14:37] terms of God that if he's creating a
[14:40] work and he and he creates him he's
[14:42] going to bring forth Man In His Image
[14:44] and his likeness there's a mirror that's
[14:46] reflecting his likeness and then on the
[14:48] canvas he's bringing forth a a something
[14:51] to be seen that looks like the artist
[14:54] when the Bible says God created man in
[14:56] His image and in his likeness we could
[14:57] say that God in some way is replicating
[15:00] his likeness as an artist bringing forth
[15:03] a self-portrait of himself
[15:05] self-portraits is intended to represent
[15:07] the artist and could either be uh uh
[15:10] solely them in the picture even
[15:12] sometimes an artist would render them as
[15:14] part of a group there's many different
[15:16] famous self-portraits this is the
[15:18] earliest known uh self-portrait uh van
[15:21] EK and this is the earliest one that
[15:23] they know of and most likely he probably
[15:25] used a mirror to do so and represents
[15:27] himself in a very Regal Way with the
[15:29] turban and they suspect even though his
[15:31] art was very valuable at the time and he
[15:33] was highly sought after that this was
[15:35] something that he would use to show his
[15:38] handiwork and show what a good artist he
[15:40] was and hopefully fetch a higher price
[15:42] and be commissioned to do other things
[15:44] this is one of the more interesting ones
[15:46] Corb of a uh of the desperate man I'm
[15:49] not going to try to say it in French and
[15:51] it has a real interesting connection
[15:52] with art the desperation of man Da Vinci
[15:56] who did his own self-portrait unique
[15:58] line and very singularly but it's it's
[16:01] him that's in it famous ones of
[16:04] rembrand and self-portraits of different
[16:07] time periods there's a lot of famous
[16:09] ones I was going to use the ones of the
[16:10] guy who was always doing funny faces and
[16:12] uh we might use those for later but
[16:14] self-portraits are things that really
[16:16] stand out to us and it reflects the
[16:18] artist and it's one of the things that I
[16:21] guess at one time when I would look at
[16:22] Art it be yeah that's that's that looks
[16:25] good or that looks like what it should
[16:26] look like but you may not have an
[16:28] appreciation for it but it was until I
[16:30] began to learn more about the artist and
[16:33] their artwork what it represented what
[16:35] the context was what the story of the
[16:37] artist was you can begin to appreciate
[16:39] more what you're looking at say wow
[16:41] that's that's a picture of a nice Garden
[16:44] scene you say well it's not just a
[16:46] garden Scene It was painted by so and so
[16:48] and this is their history and this is
[16:49] their background and then you begin to
[16:51] understand the artist vision and their
[16:53] their story and their style and the way
[16:55] that they worked and you can begin to
[16:56] see things in the picture that you
[16:57] didn't see before and then you say well
[16:59] this picture is representing a a scene
[17:02] in the Bible and then you begin to
[17:03] notice that there's all sorts of
[17:05] symbolisms and scriptures that could be
[17:07] set forth in just one
[17:09] SC and it was Art it was used in a time
[17:12] period to be able to preach the gospel
[17:14] in a single
[17:16] panel that not one's not being able to
[17:19] read the word maybe not being in
[17:20] everyone's language that a rendering a
[17:23] painting artwork would be able to
[17:24] portray something about Christ or the
[17:26] glory of God
[17:29] and these self-portraits would Express
[17:31] the artist and that's what God had done
[17:33] when he said he created man in his own
[17:35] image he was it was a self-portrait of
[17:38] himself and then one of the most uh
[17:41] famous
[17:43] self-portraits vano in his lifetime
[17:46] painted more than 40 self-portrait
[17:48] portraits most of them not realistic did
[17:50] one where he looked Japanese and he
[17:52] looked like a Buddhist monk and he was
[17:54] always creative and doing certain things
[17:56] and setting himself forth in different
[17:58] looks but this is one that I would say
[18:00] is brutally
[18:01] honest when you look at those other
[18:03] self-portraits and then you see uh maybe
[18:07] photographs of the one who did the
[18:09] self-portrait you're thinking wow that's
[18:10] a very flattering
[18:12] self-portrait and and there's a way that
[18:14] if we could all really draw we would
[18:16] draw ourselves in a way that's very
[18:19] flattering and aha we can all do it now
[18:22] by virtue of
[18:23] filters right and what what we end up
[18:26] doing is we put ourselves forth in what
[18:29] we think to be a very flattering light
[18:31] hides our imperfections it can thin our
[18:33] face it can whiten our teeth it can give
[18:35] us
[18:36] hair
[18:37] Glory there's all sorts of things that
[18:40] we could do but yet it's not an honest
[18:43] self-portrait we'll say things about
[18:45] ourselves and present ourselves in a
[18:47] certain way and we could take something
[18:49] that's very imperfect and make it look
[18:51] very perfect but in reality that's not
[18:55] you but here van go did something that
[18:58] was honest this was in January
[19:00] 1889 it's the year that he painted The
[19:02] Starry Night it was the year before he
[19:04] died of a gunshot wound to his
[19:07] stomach and he had cut off his ear
[19:10] shortly before this had been
[19:12] institutionalized and when he paints his
[19:14] self-portrait he doesn't paint him in a
[19:16] manner to where you would not see the
[19:18] ear but he paints it where you do see it
[19:21] he paints it to where you could see this
[19:23] honesty of his Brokenness his shame
[19:26] something that was of a great stain on
[19:28] him
[19:29] and this is a portrait of man as he sees
[19:32] himself being
[19:34] honest but when God brought forth Adam
[19:37] that was a perfect picture there was no
[19:40] bandage to the ear there was no filter
[19:42] there was no touching up there was no
[19:44] God wasn't trying to make himself look
[19:46] better in Adam and that Adam was a
[19:48] filtered version of God or he was a
[19:50] touched up version of God a photosho
[19:52] version of God and and nor was he uh
[19:55] some of these other self-portraits with
[19:57] their flaws and their inconsistencies
[20:00] and it's certainly not this van go
[20:02] self-portrait after he's been
[20:03] institutionalized having cut off his ear
[20:05] and meld it to an ex-girlfriend after a
[20:07] fight with one his roommate this is this
[20:10] is the uh van go is being honest about
[20:12] the way that he is in his Brokenness but
[20:15] God's original portrait was a perfect
[20:21] picture and the sermon marriage and
[20:23] divorce brother Bam's talking about the
[20:25] creation of
[20:26] man he says I seen a picture one time
[20:29] and I believe it was in Greece of an
[20:30] artist that painted a picture of Eve she
[20:33] was the most horrible looking thing I
[20:35] ever
[20:36] seen that shows what a carnal mind can
[20:39] look
[20:40] at and this is one that I found that is
[20:43] a depiction of
[20:44] Eve
[20:46] uh and Adam with kind of a very swarmy
[20:49] look you know kind of you know looking
[20:51] over at his wife but that is not a very
[20:53] flattering picture of Eve this would be
[20:56] a horrible looking thing and he says
[20:57] that's the carnal
[20:59] mind taking their their inspiration of
[21:03] what they think Eve would look like and
[21:05] putting it on canvas with pain and with
[21:07] a great gift and he says but she wasn't
[21:10] she wasn't a horrible looking thing she
[21:12] was beautiful because she was a perfect
[21:14] woman all
[21:16] woman she was a perfect woman all
[21:23] woman and then brother Brenham says in
[21:25] spiritual food and due season brother
[21:27] John I think you can just take it from
[21:28] here
[21:30] similar statement he said that just puts
[21:32] me in mind of a Greek artist I seen one
[21:34] time in an ancient Cathedral this is the
[21:37] one that I think he might have been
[21:38] referring to I'm not absolutely certain
[21:40] but this is one that's in a cathedral in
[21:42] Italy and it is this fresco painting of
[21:47] Adam and Eve it says showing what Adam
[21:49] and Eve looked like they looked like
[21:51] Beast or something and if anybody knows
[21:53] where it is I couldn't find the one in
[21:54] Greece or one in a cathedral still
[21:57] looking uh I'm actually in the process
[21:59] of collecting every single an image of
[22:02] every single piece of art that brother
[22:03] brandham references not physically just
[22:05] the
[22:06] digital
[22:07] uh could be get that could get really
[22:10] expensive how did you end up with
[22:12] Michelangelo in your
[22:17] backyard thank you
[22:20] Bitcoin he said they look like Beast or
[22:22] something and you could go back and look
[22:24] at that picture again and you see this
[22:27] there is a and in the larger picture it
[22:31] it it doesn't look completely
[22:33] human he says it it's horrible looking
[22:35] they look like Beast or something and he
[22:37] says that's what the carnal mind can
[22:38] perceive of some spiritual thing so what
[22:42] did what did Adam and the woman look
[22:44] like and and they come up with some sort
[22:46] of conception of what they think they
[22:47] look like and then they put it on canvas
[22:49] they put it on Stone they represent it
[22:51] in a cathedral he says that's the carnal
[22:53] mind if you're drawing Adam and Eve and
[22:55] you're making them look like horrible
[22:56] people and ugly creatures he said that's
[22:58] the carnal mind's perception I think
[23:00] Adam was the most handsome man that ever
[23:02] lived and Eve was a perfect woman in
[23:05] every
[23:06] way he says now carnal Minds wraps up
[23:09] the thing in their own ideas now this is
[23:12] where I'm hoping that this begins to
[23:14] have a little bit more spiritual
[23:15] emphasis to you the carnal mind wraps up
[23:18] the thing and the one that transcribes
[23:20] this capitalizes the
[23:22] thing so that there's things about God
[23:24] things that relate to God the capital t
[23:26] h i n g is speaking of God his creation
[23:30] things that are the Divine there's a
[23:31] carnal mind that will wrap up the word
[23:33] in their own
[23:35] ideas so there's a there's a grasping of
[23:38] the word there's a grasping of God's
[23:40] vision and his plan and his creation and
[23:42] his desire then the carnal mind gets
[23:44] that uh uh wrapped up and then they want
[23:47] to bring a production of it they want to
[23:49] display it and they portray it and it's
[23:53] a horrible looking thing it's nothing
[23:56] like the original it's not the way that
[23:57] God envisioned and it's mind it's not
[23:59] the way the the artist had conceived it
[24:01] and brought it forth he says then God
[24:03] sends down and infolds the thing by his
[24:06] power so there is a conception of God in
[24:10] his word and his desire that the carnal
[24:12] mind can pervert but it's God who
[24:14] ultimately brings it forth and unfolds
[24:17] it as a canvas being unfolded as an
[24:19] artwork being put on display and he
[24:21] unfolds it by his power
[24:24] am the man and the woman were perfect
[24:27] statues of the art of God they were in
[24:30] the stature of God's perfect creation
[24:33] brother bam uses a language to express
[24:35] that it was this great family portrait
[24:37] that expressed God's original and
[24:40] unblemished
[24:41] artwork the original Masterpiece of a
[24:46] family God created God beginning as an
[24:49] artist to draw his lines and then fill
[24:51] it out and ultimately God bringing forth
[24:53] the self-portrait of
[24:54] man as God on Earth the expression of
[24:58] man and woman this is his great artwork
[25:01] perfect statues sculptures beautiful not
[25:06] horrific in the Mind's Eye of these
[25:07] psychologist brother B says are these
[25:09] artist but it was God's
[25:13] art in 2 Timothy CH 3: 16 And1
[25:17] 17 says all scripture is given by
[25:19] inspiration of God and I appreciate you
[25:22] being patient with me as I just fumble
[25:24] through this
[25:25] today and maybe there's a little bit of
[25:27] pressure realizing that when you you
[25:30] Broach a subject that seems to be
[25:32] combining things that would relate to
[25:35] maybe art and and museums and education
[25:38] and
[25:39] intellect
[25:41] uh but I've studied it from the
[25:43] standpoint of the scripture and the
[25:45] message of the hour and it's those
[25:46] things that brought the brought this
[25:48] subject to the Forefront for me to share
[25:50] this with you that there is something
[25:53] that God's wanting to express in this
[25:55] hour in this time
[25:58] and you've got to catch the mind of the
[26:01] artist or it won't be a reflection that
[26:04] other people see it it won't it won't
[26:07] accurately depict the reality of what
[26:09] God's wanting to express in this
[26:11] hour God is an artist here in 2 Timothy
[26:15] 3: 16 and 17 having unfurled the canvas
[26:18] of the sky and placed the stars and the
[26:20] planets to tell a story and to write his
[26:23] first Bible now the written work all
[26:25] scriptures given by inspiration of God
[26:28] it's representative of his Creative
[26:30] Vision it's something that's the very
[26:31] Breath of God and when we say God
[26:34] breathe another thing that struck me is
[26:36] that a man breathes or exhales when he
[26:39] labors it's that laboring of God this
[26:42] Breath of God is one who would exert his
[26:44] effort and his influence over this
[26:46] masterpiece all scripture this Bible
[26:49] this holy writ that we cherish so much
[26:51] was given by the labor in the Breath of
[26:53] God and is profitable for Doctrine for
[26:56] reprove for correction for for
[26:58] instruction and righteousness no written
[27:01] Masterpiece is as profitable as the
[27:04] scripture amen many men have pinned
[27:06] great tales and novels and stories and
[27:08] true accounts and there's great wisdom
[27:10] that can be gleaned from the volumes of
[27:12] books that have been written by these
[27:13] talented artist and authors but here all
[27:16] scripture given by the inspiration of
[27:17] God is profitable for Doctrine Repro
[27:20] correction instruction and righteousness
[27:22] and the final product that the man of
[27:23] God may be perfect thly furnished unto
[27:26] all good works
[27:28] the Bible is the art of God it's God's
[27:32] original
[27:33] work something that God created and then
[27:37] what's remarkable as the very tool the
[27:40] very work product of the artist can then
[27:43] begin to influence the viewer the one
[27:47] that would read the word of God would
[27:49] begin to profit from its Doctrine its
[27:51] reproof its correction instruction and
[27:53] this word which was inspired by God is
[27:55] not a mere painting that one would look
[27:58] like oh that's awesome that's amazing
[28:00] but there's something Supernatural about
[28:02] this written word that when you can
[28:04] catch the mind of the artist when you
[28:06] could catch the vision and see it for
[28:08] yourself even as a mirror it'll cause
[28:11] you to be perfected and thly furnished
[28:13] under all good works you yourself then
[28:16] becoming a product of the
[28:20] artist God in the scripture we can see
[28:23] as he creates it's the Creator
[28:25] expressing himself back out through the
[28:27] creat ation as an artist and as you
[28:31] would look at different time periods of
[28:32] certain artists you see their influence
[28:35] and this was a time period when this
[28:36] artist was greatly influenced by this
[28:38] other artist and this is a time period
[28:40] where they were influenced by these
[28:41] things and there was a lot of lot of
[28:43] ways that you begin to interpret the
[28:44] context in the time period but going
[28:46] back to the original there's no other
[28:48] influence there's no other pattern
[28:49] there's no other symbols there's no
[28:51] other ideology there's nothing else that
[28:53] it could be a mimic of it's God himself
[28:56] Elohim the great artist who bringing
[28:58] forth creation and he is reflected in
[29:01] his creation amen we find it in the
[29:04] earth we find it in the heavens we find
[29:06] it in the Bible we find it in
[29:08] man and brother brandham says in the
[29:11] sermon sir we would see Jesus he said
[29:13] Jesus never said he's going to bring
[29:15] them to
[29:16] Bethlehem Jesus never said to the Greeks
[29:18] when they come up now just a moment if
[29:20] you want to see it I'll take you back to
[29:22] Bethlehem where I was born I'll tell you
[29:24] how it happened back there it wasn't
[29:27] that it's not in the Art of Storytelling
[29:30] it's not in the art of travel it wasn't
[29:32] in the art of beholding a beautiful
[29:33] scene and being able to describe it and
[29:35] show that to him he said he point that
[29:37] it wasn't that he pointed them to a
[29:39] future place if they wanted to know him
[29:43] if you want to know me in other words I
[29:46] won't take you back and tell you when I
[29:47] was born at Bethlehem and all about that
[29:49] I'll point you to a place where I'm
[29:51] going to be crucified for you and in
[29:54] there if you'll be crucified with me and
[29:56] take up your cross and follow me you'll
[29:58] know who I am otherwise from that you'll
[30:02] never learn it through your ancient
[30:06] Arts now there was there was even an
[30:10] ancient art to the philosophers the
[30:12] Greeks and the different uh cultures and
[30:14] there's certainly an ancient art to what
[30:16] the Jews espoused but here as he talked
[30:19] to them the Greeks the philosophers he
[30:21] says you won't find me you won't find
[30:23] your salvation you're not going to find
[30:25] God through ancient Arts but you'll find
[30:28] me you'll find me there at Calvary and
[30:31] then brother brandham just notice how
[30:32] astute this is he says well you say
[30:34] brother brandham but we learn it through
[30:36] the art of the
[30:38] Bible brother B says no we
[30:40] don't now he's not disputing that the
[30:43] Bible is Art but he's disputing the fact
[30:45] that you could solely know God through
[30:47] studying the art of the Bible he says if
[30:50] we learn it through the art of the Bible
[30:52] then why didn't the Pharisees have
[30:55] it good point if you could if you could
[30:58] learn it solely just by pouring over the
[31:01] pages and and just studying it and
[31:03] looking at it from an artistic
[31:04] standpoint or trying to look at it
[31:06] within its historical accuracy and
[31:08] whatever the other things might be in
[31:10] the original language and and try to
[31:12] absorb it as one Masterpiece just
[31:14] pouring through it and learning it as a
[31:16] product of art itself he says you're not
[31:18] going to learn it through the Bible
[31:19] alone because if that was so the
[31:21] Pharisees would have immediately
[31:22] recognized Jesus
[31:24] Christ it isn't learned through the art
[31:27] of the Bible
[31:28] because we got many artists trying to
[31:30] paint
[31:33] it there's a there's a Bible we can say
[31:37] this is the original work of art but he
[31:38] said there's many other artist
[31:40] repainting
[31:42] this to what we have is not necessarily
[31:45] the original Bible the original work the
[31:46] original artwork that in itself unveil
[31:49] unveils Christ and in every verse
[31:50] there's Jesus Christ he says it's not
[31:52] just learned through the art of the
[31:54] Bible again he's not saying the Bible is
[31:55] not art but he's saying there's too many
[31:57] artist trying to repaint it or paint it
[32:01] he says but the Bible is right God is
[32:05] the
[32:07] artist if we study the Bible as a work
[32:10] of art and we're merely what looking
[32:12] what another man painted will completely
[32:14] miss it but he says the Bible is right
[32:16] and God is the artist all scriptures
[32:19] given by inspiration of God it's
[32:21] profitable but we can't just find it by
[32:24] studying it solely as a piece of art
[32:27] itself but we to recognize God is the
[32:29] artist God had a vision God had a
[32:32] purpose God had a desire and without
[32:34] that context the artwork is rendered
[32:37] less meaningful than it ought to be and
[32:39] even worse sometimes we're viewing
[32:41] something said isn't that a an
[32:43] amazing amazing painting isn't that
[32:46] beautiful and come to find out it's a
[32:48] reproduction of something by an artist
[32:52] from the
[32:52] original and in my mind I'm thinking I
[32:55] want to see the original a lot of pieces
[32:57] of of art that I found that I really
[32:59] really like that were just artist
[33:01] practicing their craft and their skill
[33:03] by replicating one of the known works of
[33:05] their
[33:07] time and doing so you'll always get that
[33:11] artist's
[33:12] interpretation of what they
[33:16] see things that maybe they're learning
[33:18] things they want to emphasize things
[33:20] that they may want to
[33:21] change but when you come to the word of
[33:24] God God Is Right the Bible is right and
[33:27] the Bible is the art of
[33:29] God in second Peter chap 1: 20 to 21 I
[33:32] believe this touches on brother B saying
[33:34] many artist trying to paint it we know
[33:37] that we could paint with our words and
[33:38] trying to paint him in a bad picture
[33:40] paint you into a corner he says knowing
[33:42] this first that no Prophecy of the
[33:43] scriptures of any private
[33:46] interpretation that word is UN loosening
[33:49] or un
[33:50] unveiling and and you could have in a
[33:52] sense you could use that in the way of
[33:53] one unveiling a work of
[33:56] art the the prophet of God the scripture
[33:58] is of no private interpretation other
[34:01] words it cannot be presented as one's
[34:03] own work man cannot say I wrote this and
[34:07] man cannot tell that he has the sole
[34:10] understanding of the inspiration behind
[34:11] it he cannot privately interpret the art
[34:14] of
[34:15] God no Prophecy of the scriptures of any
[34:18] private interpretation for the prophecy
[34:20] came not in Old Time by the will of men
[34:22] but holy men of God spake as they were
[34:25] moved by the Holy Ghost prophet prophecy
[34:28] was the art of God God having allowed a
[34:31] man to prophesy and inspiring them to
[34:33] write out his prophecy others could sit
[34:35] and admire the work and now try to
[34:37] interpret it themselves it says that
[34:40] this should happen oh it says that he
[34:42] shall come doing this and now it says
[34:43] that and so prophecy becomes the art of
[34:46] God that many try to
[34:48] interpret but it's not until God by his
[34:51] power unfolds it and fulfills it that
[34:55] you see the true meaning of the work of
[34:56] art
[34:59] prophecy is something that God brought
[35:01] forth by his inspiration holy men of God
[35:04] spake as they removed by the Holy Ghost
[35:06] this is the Bible the art of God and
[35:10] what does man do they fabricate it cheap
[35:14] reproductions they they set it forth as
[35:16] their own original work or they guess at
[35:17] it and they say I think he means this
[35:19] and I think it means that I think this
[35:21] person's that and I think this is
[35:22] happening that's happening and men are
[35:25] are looking at trying to figure it out
[35:27] but God wrote it he's the artist the
[35:30] word is the art of God and God Alone
[35:33] knows the true meaning behind
[35:36] it in Philippians chap 2: 5 to8 let this
[35:39] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[35:41] Jesus who being in the form of God
[35:44] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[35:46] God but made himself of no reputation
[35:50] took upon him the form of a servant and
[35:52] was made in the likeness of men there so
[35:56] much that we could see in this and go
[35:57] God created Adam and brought him forth
[35:59] as a stature of God in the image of God
[36:02] a perfect sculpture of uh manliness
[36:05] perfect sculpture of Womanhood in the
[36:08] woman and God brought forth a
[36:10] self-portrait perfect picture no blemish
[36:13] no flaw but now in this forming in
[36:17] making and
[36:19] fashioning says he was found in the
[36:21] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[36:25] became obedient unto death even the de
[36:27] death of the
[36:29] Cross to make to form this likeness this
[36:32] fashion in all evokes the thoughts of an
[36:34] artist engaged in
[36:35] creating and this sense it's one who is
[36:38] going to bring forth a son who is going
[36:40] to be a replication of the father he's
[36:42] going to be in the image of the Father
[36:43] the Son coming forth and God the perfect
[36:46] artist now brings forth his son in the
[36:49] image of the
[36:51] imperfect God chooses to frame this
[36:55] sinless savior in a Manger
[36:58] in a
[37:00] stable and and not surrounded by
[37:02] Grandeur that that's how God framed it
[37:04] why because the man as he originally was
[37:06] brought forth in a perfect framing of a
[37:08] perfect Eden and an all inspiring
[37:11] picture of man a fully grown mature uh
[37:14] handsome man brings forth a beautiful
[37:17] fully mature woman who are ready to go
[37:19] forth and dominate the world and to
[37:22] populate that's a incredibly beautiful
[37:25] powerful picture but when God brings
[37:27] brings forth his son the original
[37:29] perfect artist God himself this perfect
[37:32] artist brings forth a
[37:33] baby lying in the manger in the image of
[37:36] the imperfect not as Adam in the perfect
[37:39] original picture but on a canvas of
[37:42] Fallen Humanity in flesh that was weak
[37:46] weary could hunger could cry could feel
[37:50] pain could
[37:53] die God did that so that we could he
[37:56] could reflect something in his work that
[37:58] we could identify
[38:00] with and so Paul in writing says let
[38:02] this mind be in you that was in Christ
[38:05] Jesus having been formed and fashion and
[38:07] made by his father in the likeness of
[38:10] man he humbled himself and became
[38:12] obedient to God's will he says let this
[38:15] mind be in you though you may be an
[38:17] imperfect canvas and though you may not
[38:19] have come forth just like Adam and even
[38:21] though you may not have been the sinless
[38:22] son that was to come into the world and
[38:24] die for your sins we've got to let this
[38:26] mind be in US
[38:29] this kind of
[38:30] [Applause]
[38:31] humility so that God could use us
[38:33] brother Bram says he made of himself no
[38:37] reputation now I'm struck by how brother
[38:39] brandom expresses this the man that made
[38:42] an artificial tooth made a reputation
[38:44] for
[38:45] himself is interesting I don't know who
[38:48] the man
[38:49] is uh but the one that made the real
[38:52] tooth made of himself no
[38:54] reputation now the man that makes the
[38:56] artificial tooth is
[38:58] fabricating a replica of the
[39:01] original and they're getting really
[39:03] really good now with their replications
[39:05] did you know that faux leather now is
[39:07] more desirable and more Supple and
[39:09] better and longer lasting and looks more
[39:10] beautiful than real
[39:13] leather that's where they've gotten
[39:15] that's where they're going the synthetic
[39:17] the the replication the
[39:19] fabrication is to the man is better but
[39:21] it's a
[39:24] knockoff He makes himself of no
[39:26] reputation the man that it has a cheap
[39:28] imitation of the original oh it lasts
[39:31] longer it'll never do this it'll never
[39:32] do that he says but the man who made the
[39:34] original tooth made himself no
[39:36] reputation the man that made an
[39:38] artificial arm made a reputation for
[39:40] himself God in the original brought
[39:42] forth something original and everything
[39:44] else that man would do after that is
[39:46] replicating perverting or working off
[39:48] the original and the ones that kind of
[39:51] rep re-represent to recreate to reset
[39:53] forth and rearrange they make
[39:55] reputations for themselves but when the
[39:57] great artist God came down to earth to
[39:59] be manifest in his son he was
[40:03] unrecognizable in that self-portrait he
[40:05] made himself of no reputation the man
[40:07] who made the real arm made of himself no
[40:10] reputation he says the Way Up Is
[40:12] Down always remember that and then he
[40:14] makes this statement be humble be sweet
[40:18] and kind brothers be sweet and kind be
[40:24] creative he says let Christ be in you
[40:28] now that's a really
[40:30] odd interposition there to Say be humble
[40:33] be sweet be kind let Christ be in you
[40:35] and we're saying y I got it I got it I
[40:37] got he says be creative and all the
[40:39] artists here are like Yay right
[40:43] crafts and there's a it's different to
[40:46] say be
[40:47] creative and he's not necessarily saying
[40:49] go out and create an atmosphere go
[40:52] create squirrels and bring worlds into
[40:54] existence it it's a phrase that we might
[40:56] see in a really nice
[40:58] calligraphy font in someone's powder
[41:00] bath you know be creative and nice
[41:02] watercolor touchings on it it evokes a
[41:06] thought of be
[41:07] creative loosen my creativity and I
[41:10] believe he means it let Christ be in you
[41:13] Christ the original Christ the original
[41:15] artist the one who made the arm the one
[41:17] that made the tooth the power that
[41:19] brought all worlds into existence he
[41:20] lives in you the great artist The Great
[41:22] Creator lives in you and he says be
[41:24] creative then
[41:27] in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:1 it says for
[41:29] what man knoweth the things of man save
[41:32] the spirit of man which is in
[41:34] him even so the things of God knoweth no
[41:37] man but the spirit of
[41:39] God this is a scripture we often refer
[41:43] to and we use the example that we relate
[41:46] to one another because we're are we are
[41:48] share the commonality of Being Human and
[41:51] if we ever lose sight of that that's
[41:53] when real problems start when we look
[41:55] down upon somebody else as being less
[41:57] human human or less deserving of life
[41:58] and and through our judgments we begin
[42:00] to create categories of humanity but we
[42:03] can relate to man in his suffering in
[42:05] his joy and his success or his failures
[42:07] we do so because the spirit of man is in
[42:09] us and the more that they study animal
[42:12] life and animal kind they find that
[42:13] there's
[42:14] particularities certain species and
[42:16] certain breeds and certain ways of
[42:18] thinking and acting and you'll find that
[42:20] we may never be able to understand and
[42:22] we will not be able to understand the
[42:23] way the animals act and think because we
[42:25] are not animals
[42:28] there is not the Affinity of spirit to
[42:30] be able to relate to the things that are
[42:32] being
[42:35] done sometimes we I I find myself
[42:38] usually if my children do something that
[42:40] I disagree with my first response is to
[42:42] ask a question I want not I don't want
[42:45] to do that anymore maybe comes off as
[42:47] too
[42:48] loyly uh what I'd like to be able to do
[42:50] is think of the question and be able to
[42:52] answer it for myself why are you doing
[42:54] that son oh yeah yeah
[42:58] I did the same thing yeah uhuh oh I know
[43:00] why he's doing that yep I did the same
[43:01] thing yesterday that's why he's doing
[43:03] it there there's ways that we we can
[43:06] relate we can empathize we can begin to
[43:08] recognize the spirit of man but he says
[43:10] the things of God you can't know but by
[43:12] the spirit of God brother brandom in the
[43:15] sermon he that is in you I didn't
[43:17] provide this quote did I I meant
[43:20] to he that is in you November 10th in
[43:24] the evening 1963 anybody want to guess
[43:26] what what's preached in the morning
[43:29] souls in prison now and he follows that
[43:32] up with he that is in you I don't think
[43:35] it was a
[43:36] mistake now what if tonight that you
[43:38] could say with all your heart that the
[43:40] spirit of Shakespeare lived in
[43:42] you that Shakespeare lived in you you
[43:44] know what you would
[43:46] do you'd do the works of
[43:49] Shakespeare you would you would create
[43:52] poems and plays and so forth because
[43:54] Shakespeare was the type of an artist a
[43:56] great write or poem writer now if
[43:58] Shakespeare lived in you the works of
[44:00] Shakespeare you would do so here's this
[44:03] a writer the spirit of a writer this
[44:06] this type of art this kind of work
[44:07] product this skill he says what have
[44:10] Beethoven lived in you you would write
[44:13] songs like Beethoven a great composer
[44:16] you would write songs like Beethoven
[44:18] because Beethoven would be your life you
[44:20] would be a Beethoven reincarnated again
[44:24] if Beethoven lived in you the works of
[44:25] Beethoven you would do
[44:27] because Beethoven lived in you in other
[44:31] words the spirit and the life of the
[44:32] artist is what inspires and produces the
[44:35] Creator's art that if the spirit of
[44:38] Shakespeare is in you then you have that
[44:40] artist Spirit you have his inspiration
[44:42] you would have perhaps his talents and
[44:44] his eye for detail and that creativity
[44:46] and so you'd bring forth as a writer
[44:48] you'd bring forth that Spirit of a
[44:50] writer would bring forth writings the
[44:52] spirit of the painter would bring forth
[44:54] paintings the spirit of one that
[44:55] composes music would bring bring forth
[44:58] compositions why because it's that
[45:00] Spirit of the Artisan that brings forth
[45:02] the work product for what knoweth the
[45:04] things of man save the spirit of man
[45:06] that is in him if you had the spirit of
[45:07] the man Shakespeare you would write uh
[45:10] uh sonnets and you'd write poems and
[45:11] you'd write plays and you'd write these
[45:13] great things why because that's the
[45:15] spirit of that artist brother B often
[45:18] said well if I was a Dyan I I had the
[45:20] spirit of Dyan I'd have a gun I'd be a
[45:21] shooter and he says if you had the
[45:22] spirit of Beethoven you'd write works of
[45:24] art and that's because that's the spirit
[45:26] of that man but verse 12 continues now
[45:29] we have received not the spirit of the
[45:32] world you have not received the spirit
[45:35] of Shakespeare you have not received the
[45:36] spirit of beethova you have not received
[45:38] the spirit of brother
[45:39] brandom there's a lot of ways that we
[45:41] can look at the the art of the message
[45:44] and we can see brother Brandon
[45:46] reflecting back in that in that art and
[45:48] many of us can try to replicate and
[45:51] reproduce in image of brother brandham
[45:54] and that's the wrong type of
[45:55] reproduction
[45:57] because we have not received the spirit
[45:59] of the world nor have we received the
[46:01] spirit of brother brandom and we don't
[46:02] want to take on the spirit of our
[46:05] pastor but we have received the spirit
[46:08] which is of god that we might know the
[46:10] things that are freely given to us of
[46:13] God we have received the spirit of God
[46:16] that we might know the things of
[46:20] God brother brandham says in the sermon
[46:22] Jehovah Gyra part one he said the spirit
[46:24] that was in him is on you eternal life
[46:28] he is The Giver of eternal life he's a
[46:30] redeemer to bring back that which fell
[46:32] in the fall in the human race to bring
[46:34] back to god notice the spirit that is in
[46:38] you is a giver a
[46:39] redeemer and the spirit that was in
[46:41] Christ is in you and if the spirit of
[46:45] Dylan was in me I'd have guns got a lot
[46:48] of brother
[46:50] dylans and if the spirit of Dylan was in
[46:53] me I'd have guns if the spirit of an
[46:54] artist was in me I'd paint pictures
[46:58] I've collected I believe every single
[47:00] instance where brother bam says that the
[47:02] spirit of an artist was in
[47:04] me and he says it over and over and over
[47:07] it's one of my largest quote collections
[47:08] as I've been studying this if the spirit
[47:10] of an artist was in me I'd paint
[47:11] pictures and he says if the spirit of
[47:13] Christ is in you the works of Christ you
[47:16] will do the life that was in him is in
[47:20] you this is why he could say be
[47:23] creative now this is bringing it down
[47:26] and maybe taken a Windy Way a long way
[47:28] and maybe a difficult way for you maybe
[47:30] you've been wrestling with it maybe I've
[47:33] been very clumsy and awkward and trying
[47:34] to express these things and I would say
[47:36] that God has allowed it for a reason
[47:39] that's very self-serving but I will
[47:40] still say that God's allowed it for you
[47:42] to wrestle with yourself to look past
[47:44] the canvas or the humanity to kind of
[47:45] try to catch what is what is God wanting
[47:47] me to hear through this mumble
[47:50] jumble my brother-in-law Jonathan sent
[47:52] me a uh
[47:55] uh a me yeser or just a quote and I
[47:58] think about it because you might think
[47:59] it's mumble jumble but it's uh it it's
[48:02] really just
[48:04] uh stuttering and
[48:07] babbling and he said I hate it when
[48:09] people accuse me of Lolly ging
[48:11] lollygagging when I'm clearly Dilly
[48:13] dallion and I was like that's nothing
[48:15] but the
[48:16] truth so I apologize for my
[48:19] stumbling my
[48:21] stuttering but there's something here
[48:23] that we need to
[48:24] see that if God in the original brought
[48:27] forth creation and he's expressing
[48:28] himself and man comes forth now God is
[48:31] an artist painting a self-portrait that
[48:32] becomes marred the Great Masterpiece is
[48:35] marred and now man and Satan through his
[48:37] agenda is completely marring God's
[48:39] Masterpiece changing Its Reflection
[48:41] changing its purpose changing its image
[48:43] to where the things that we now exist
[48:45] see and exist now are so far from the
[48:49] original but then in Jesus Christ God
[48:52] brought forth a work of art a production
[48:54] for us to see ourselves in
[48:57] that in him was the was the artist
[48:59] himself God in his son the power to
[49:02] create and maybe skipping a lot of
[49:04] different uh scriptures and statements
[49:07] and just relying on your prior knowledge
[49:10] now Christ in
[49:13] you let this mind be in you Christ in
[49:18] you the spirit of the artist is in us we
[49:21] are his we are his
[49:23] artwork now his spirit is in US
[49:27] in 2 Corinthians chap 3: 2 and 3 Paul
[49:30] says ye are our epistle
[49:33] written in our hearts known and read of
[49:36] all
[49:37] men as Paul is expressing this desire of
[49:41] a father these thoughts of a father that
[49:43] I have this writing this inspiration
[49:45] this work in my heart but now you have
[49:47] become the expression of this Vision
[49:50] this thing this epistle this writing in
[49:52] my heart has now been expressed in you
[49:55] so that you be come the work product of
[49:57] my inspiration you are now known and
[50:00] read of all men now lest we think that
[50:02] that's just merely Paul he says for as
[50:04] much as ye are manifestly declared to be
[50:06] the Epistle of Christ if we want to
[50:09] think of epistle as a letter or a
[50:10] writing this is a representative work a
[50:12] production of Christ it's an artwork of
[50:15] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[50:18] ink painted not with paint written not
[50:20] with think not type with the typewriter
[50:22] but with the spirit of the Living God
[50:24] not in tables of stone but in the
[50:26] fleshly tables of the heart in other
[50:29] words Paul is using a language to say
[50:31] that you are a work of art
[50:33] expressed and there could be inspiration
[50:36] there could be an image there could be a
[50:37] desire that is embodied in the the the
[50:40] Christ as he's ministered and that
[50:43] itself represents inspiration and that
[50:45] as you have received that inspiration
[50:47] you have become the Declaration of that
[50:50] inspiration you yourself have become
[50:52] that work of art you become your life
[50:55] lived becomes the inter interpretation
[50:57] of the
[50:59] inspiration and as some of you artists
[51:01] may know there's different types of art
[51:03] there's so many different types of art
[51:05] where and influences but one thing that
[51:08] I last year was learning more of is
[51:12] Impressionism versus
[51:14] realism and I I don't mean I don't want
[51:16] to get lost in the Weeds on this because
[51:17] I think there's a value and benefit I
[51:19] think there's Beauty in both of them in
[51:20] art and there's a lot to be learned from
[51:22] the impressionist who's not his goal is
[51:25] not to Faithfully accurately and with
[51:28] great
[51:29] detail reflect and portray the original
[51:33] as it looked but rather as Van Go Star
[51:36] night his impression of it the way it
[51:38] strikes him the way he sees it I there's
[51:41] a there's a great Beauty in art and
[51:42] there's may be some value or type in in
[51:46] reality in the truth for us as Believers
[51:48] but I think the biggest problem when it
[51:50] comes to the word of God is there's too
[51:51] many impressionist and not enough
[51:55] realism that when God inspires the word
[51:57] when God word God's word comes to you do
[52:00] you take it and do you want to present
[52:02] it through your
[52:04] impression or can you Faithfully reflect
[52:06] back what it really
[52:09] is because you are a written
[52:11] epistle all scriptures given by
[52:14] inspiration of God the Bible is a is a
[52:16] work of God it is the art of God now
[52:18] this art of God this written word is now
[52:21] in your heart being lived out in you you
[52:23] are the manifested Declaration of the
[52:26] word of Christ in 2 Peter 3: 15 and 16
[52:31] and account that the longsuffering of
[52:32] Our Lord is salvation and then he gives
[52:36] this example even as our beloved brother
[52:38] Paul also according to the wisdom given
[52:40] unto him hath written unto you I
[52:44] apologize for not having some of these
[52:46] things in there goofed on these the
[52:48] slideshow says Paul according to his
[52:51] wisdom given to him from God he's
[52:54] written unto you so now Paul said you
[52:57] are the epistle that was in our hearts
[52:59] we've written unto you the word you've
[53:01] received this word the gospel has been
[53:02] preached to you now you become a written
[53:04] epistle notice this language Peter uses
[53:06] as also in all his Epistles speaking in
[53:09] them of things in which are say things
[53:12] hard to be
[53:13] understood so as you are a living
[53:16] epistle you have the original work of
[53:19] God the art of God you see him in nature
[53:21] you see him in the heavens you see him
[53:23] in the Bible in the sky you see the
[53:24] written word which is the art of God you
[53:26] see Christ as he was on Earth he becomes
[53:28] this expression of God but as we have
[53:30] the Bible being the art of God now we
[53:33] have this example how that Paul's
[53:35] scripture the things that he wrote are
[53:38] in them are things hard to be understood
[53:41] says which they that are unlearned and
[53:43] unstable
[53:45] rest that means to twist to turn aide to
[53:49] torture means like to put on the rack
[53:51] and to twist and to cause to be painful
[53:53] to pervert metaphorically as one who
[53:55] tortures language in a deceitful
[53:59] way they will take as being unlearned
[54:02] and unstable they twist and distort the
[54:07] word they've taken the Epistles of Paul
[54:10] as he's as he's preached the word of God
[54:11] as Christ was declared through the
[54:13] gospel through his preaching through his
[54:15] writings there's those that seeing that
[54:18] and receive it then twist it and
[54:20] contorted he says as they do also the
[54:22] other scriptures unto their own
[54:24] destruction
[54:27] this is when we con seeed this then if
[54:30] the Bible as a work of art becomes a
[54:33] tool of the
[54:34] artist and now with through its
[54:36] inspiration it's wanting to make you
[54:39] thly
[54:40] furnished that you now become the
[54:43] product we sing You Are The Potter I'm
[54:45] the clay what is it that's Artistry that
[54:48] is God is an artist you are his work of
[54:50] art and there's a yielding to the hands
[54:52] of that Potter to make us as we ought to
[54:54] be if the word of God is to mold us and
[54:56] to Fashion us and to shape us then
[54:59] there's there's a and that's to be the
[55:00] the inspiration of the artist forming
[55:03] you painting you and bringing you forth
[55:05] an expression of the word what Peter is
[55:07] saying is that unstable and unlearned
[55:10] take that inspiration and begin to twist
[55:12] it and contort
[55:13] it to suit their themselves so that they
[55:17] as a replication as they as a work
[55:20] product are not accurately reflecting
[55:22] the artist
[55:24] inspiration they become a work of art
[55:26] that it's just a
[55:27] knockoff may be cheaply fabricated it's
[55:30] not the original it's not according to
[55:32] the original inspiration it's a twisted
[55:34] eple it's a great cover band brother
[55:36] loyel for Hill song
[55:40] songs becomes
[55:42] misinterpreted you're not you're not a
[55:45] work of art that God wants to bring
[55:48] forth for others to see and to hear the
[55:52] gospel I I'll say this and I maybe just
[55:56] uh expressing this it might make some
[55:57] sense to you I didn't necessarily bury
[56:00] this lead uh for on purpose but how
[56:03] these things were inspired to me over
[56:05] the last couple years and especially
[56:07] last year is in
[56:09] asking what does how how am I to live
[56:13] how am I to act what am I to look like
[56:15] what am I to sound like so that others
[56:17] see
[56:19] Christ and if we borrow from the wrong
[56:24] image we can actually we can try to
[56:27] reflect Christ in a way that to the
[56:29] world they're like I don't even know
[56:32] what that
[56:33] is we borrowed from the Baroque Period
[56:36] and we tried to present ourselves as
[56:37] Saints right with Halos and dress in a
[56:40] very Regal Way in a way that the gospel
[56:41] is being portrayed in an age gone by and
[56:43] we're trying to do it in a way that I
[56:45] want to reflect the spirit of Christ and
[56:46] nature of Christ we would only be re be
[56:48] cosplay of another
[56:51] age and so in my heart I'm thinking Lord
[56:54] how is it that we as men how is it we as
[56:57] women and children how is it as a church
[56:59] or as the bride of Christ how is it
[57:01] you're wanting to bring us forth as your
[57:03] work of art that will act refle
[57:05] accurately reflect what Christ looks
[57:07] like today in
[57:10] 2025 there's got to be a way that God
[57:12] desires to be seen and it's
[57:16] not and it's got to be such it's got to
[57:18] be accurate to this time period it's got
[57:20] to be IR
[57:23] relevant that's that's the inspiration
[57:25] to this
[57:27] in the sermon Serv we would see Jesus I
[57:29] think we read from this a moment ago
[57:30] where he said God is the artist of the
[57:33] Bible he said the Creeds today say join
[57:36] this say this doxology repeat the
[57:38] Apostles Creed join our church shake
[57:40] hands be baptized in the name of the
[57:42] father Son and Holy Ghost those are
[57:44] denominational Creeds and then he says
[57:48] the
[57:49] artist capital A God the artist didn't
[57:52] paint the picture that
[57:54] way the artist painted it that Jesus
[57:57] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[58:00] forever he that heareth my words and
[58:02] believeth on him that sent me has
[58:04] Everlast eternal life The Works that I
[58:06] do shall he do also these signs shall
[58:08] follow them that believe that's the way
[58:11] the painter painted it so when God
[58:14] reflects that you know you've struck the
[58:17] right
[58:19] painting when God reflects
[58:22] that Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[58:24] today forever those are my my words
[58:26] there so when God reflects that you know
[58:28] you've struck the right painting outside
[58:30] of that you got a bogus
[58:32] copy a lot of those going around anymore
[58:35] you got to be very careful where you
[58:36] order from and what you get because it's
[58:38] a it's a bogus copy like well I thought
[58:41] for sure sure this was a balency I was
[58:43] positive it
[58:46] was but it's a bogus copy take that old
[58:50] bogus copy of some kind of a Creed and
[58:52] throw that thing out the door tonight
[58:55] and take the Bible's Gospel Light and
[58:57] let the painter paint Christ in
[59:02] you away with the wrong
[59:05] mirrors the wrong replications the wrong
[59:09] interpretations away with the other
[59:10] artist trying to paint the
[59:12] bible let the painter God paint Christ
[59:17] in
[59:18] you that your life becomes the canvas
[59:21] and the way that you live and the way
[59:22] that you act becomes Christ in 2025
[59:25] Christ in this modern times Christ in
[59:27] this day and age that we're living in I
[59:29] believe as Christians we got to go we go
[59:31] the opposite way but I believe that
[59:34] there's a fanaticism and there's an
[59:35] interpretation and there's an
[59:37] impressionist replication of what that
[59:39] might look like and in doing so we get
[59:41] further and further away from the
[59:43] darkness that needs our light and we
[59:45] become a part of the darkness I mean in
[59:48] this day and age in reality like the
[59:50] weirder you are the more they'll accept
[59:52] you like wow man you're really weird I
[59:54] like that you don't believe in this you
[59:57] don't believe in that I didn't know you
[59:58] were hip I didn't know you were cool do
[1:00:00] you eat granola too do you make your own
[1:00:03] lip gloss you know it's like everybody's
[1:00:05] just doing hipster things and making
[1:00:08] match sticks out of leftover firewood
[1:00:09] and all sorts of stuff and the world can
[1:00:11] Embrace that being weird living off the
[1:00:14] grid and doing all sorts of that that
[1:00:15] might just lump you into all the weirdos
[1:00:17] and the insane people in today's day and
[1:00:19] age so it's got to be a very sane
[1:00:21] sensible way the for the gospel to be
[1:00:23] expressed listen I'll say whether you're
[1:00:25] a scar or a hipster or or or uh whatever
[1:00:29] you might be God has got to be expressed
[1:00:31] in his unique way that he has shaped
[1:00:34] your canvas so that his voice can be
[1:00:36] heard in this hour and we can't do it
[1:00:38] through some sort of forced homogeny
[1:00:40] where everybody's the same way or being
[1:00:42] some radical looking people to where
[1:00:45] we're so far away from Humanity that the
[1:00:47] message is
[1:00:50] missed I know these things are difficult
[1:00:52] I I know to understand just well we
[1:00:54] should all do this we should all do that
[1:00:56] and it should look this way and it
[1:00:56] should act that way and I think there's
[1:00:58] some very clear tenants in the scripture
[1:01:00] of how a woman should dress how a man
[1:01:02] should look the things we should
[1:01:03] participate in the things we should
[1:01:05] enjoy and the things that we should
[1:01:06] allow there's some very clear
[1:01:08] prescriptions in scripture but these
[1:01:10] things cannot be construed to make a
[1:01:12] checklist of a way that we're all
[1:01:14] supposed to look thinking that's going
[1:01:15] to accurately portray the artwork of God
[1:01:18] in this day and
[1:01:19] age we've got to let God the painter
[1:01:23] paint Christ in US in Romans 88:9 it
[1:01:26] says but you are not in the flesh but in
[1:01:28] the spirit you're not in the spirit of
[1:01:30] Dylan you're not in the spirit of
[1:01:31] Shakespeare you're not in the spirit of
[1:01:32] Beethoven but you are in the spirit of
[1:01:35] Christ God the artist The Creator if so
[1:01:37] be that the spirit of God dwell in you
[1:01:41] but if the spirit of God dwells not in
[1:01:42] you now if any man have not the spirit
[1:01:44] of Christ he is none of
[1:01:46] Christ he is none of his if I could say
[1:01:50] it this way if the spirit of Christ is
[1:01:52] not in you you are not his work product
[1:01:56] if the spirit of Christ is not in you
[1:01:57] you are not his artwork you are you are
[1:02:00] impressionism you're a fabrication you
[1:02:01] are a knockoff you cannot be the art of
[1:02:05] God you are not a new creature created
[1:02:07] in Christ Jesus you're not his creation
[1:02:09] you're not his handiwork you're not his
[1:02:10] Vineyard you're not his
[1:02:13] building and Romans 10:8 says but what
[1:02:16] saith it the word is nigh thee even in
[1:02:18] thy mouth and in thy heart that is the
[1:02:21] word of faith which we preach the word
[1:02:24] is not just on you it's just not near
[1:02:26] you not just even in your mouth but it's
[1:02:29] in your
[1:02:31] heart the spirit of God dwelling in you
[1:02:34] brings the word to your mouth and then
[1:02:37] it'll bring it near
[1:02:39] you the spirit of the great artist God
[1:02:41] the spirit of Christ that is in you the
[1:02:44] Creator wanting to paint Christ in you
[1:02:46] will bring it to your mouth that you as
[1:02:48] a Storyteller you as an artist with your
[1:02:50] words you as a writer you that one would
[1:02:52] who say things can paint Christ with
[1:02:55] your words
[1:02:57] certain seasoning
[1:02:58] and refreshing to your speech that can
[1:03:01] portray Christ and then the word being
[1:03:04] on you near you nigh you not only you're
[1:03:07] a creator of an atmosphere but the image
[1:03:08] that God has created in your life can
[1:03:10] preach the word Christ it's another
[1:03:14] Masterpiece being
[1:03:16] created another unveiling of a great
[1:03:18] work of art in this
[1:03:21] day in the sermon Jehovah Gyra part two
[1:03:27] brother brah is speaking about Abraham
[1:03:29] and how they just held to that promise
[1:03:30] that she would bring forth a son holding
[1:03:32] to God's word holding to the word
[1:03:34] because God Said So no matter what the
[1:03:36] Creeds that covered it up still that
[1:03:39] word laid there it had to come that word
[1:03:43] laying in Abraham's heart no matter how
[1:03:46] many says the days of this is gone and
[1:03:48] that
[1:03:50] there I want you to think of it this for
[1:03:52] yourself wherever wherever you sit today
[1:03:55] if if you have not the spirit of Christ
[1:03:57] search it with everything that is in you
[1:04:01] everything that is in you if you put if
[1:04:03] you had some New Year's resolution of
[1:04:05] what you wanted to do you had a bucket
[1:04:06] list this year you should get desperate
[1:04:08] about being born again and say Lord I I
[1:04:11] know that I I'm not where I need to be I
[1:04:13] know I haven't fully surrendered I
[1:04:14] haven't I haven't repented of my sins I
[1:04:16] haven't been baptized in the name of the
[1:04:17] Lord Jesus Christ I I I I need to call
[1:04:20] upon God for Revelation I need to
[1:04:21] experience this new birth get desperate
[1:04:23] about that become the desperate man amen
[1:04:26] seeking and searching after the power of
[1:04:28] God to Quicken you and to change you so
[1:04:31] you can have the spirit of God inside of
[1:04:33] you and if you feel and believe and know
[1:04:36] that you have been born again and that
[1:04:37] the word is not just around you and not
[1:04:40] just in your mouth but it is in your
[1:04:41] mouth and around you because the word is
[1:04:43] now original in your heart and the
[1:04:45] spirit of God is inside of you with this
[1:04:46] directive to be creative I want you to
[1:04:48] take heart in that word is
[1:04:51] powerful this word that is in you it is
[1:04:54] the spirit of Christ that is making you
[1:04:57] his that is making you the art of God
[1:05:00] that is bringing you forth as a
[1:05:01] manifestation of the word of God the
[1:05:03] word is in your heart hold to it like
[1:05:06] Abraham did hold to it like Sarah did
[1:05:10] because brother says as long as that
[1:05:11] word is laying there it will be
[1:05:15] creative
[1:05:16] Lord as long as that word is laying
[1:05:20] there I think in some ways we could
[1:05:22] maybe preach this to where we all just
[1:05:24] want to go out and make friendship
[1:05:26] bracelets or start painting pictures and
[1:05:28] brother regie I just forgot you've
[1:05:29] become a budding artist over the last
[1:05:31] couple years maybe you could really
[1:05:32] relate to these things maybe he's the
[1:05:34] one that pulled me into this channel
[1:05:35] after all but there's ways that we can
[1:05:37] say this inspires me for art and I want
[1:05:39] to go to an art museum and I want to
[1:05:40] paint pictures and I want to do that all
[1:05:42] wonderful things that there some of
[1:05:44] these things are good Recreation a good
[1:05:45] use of your time uh but because there's
[1:05:48] good art there's bad art right but we
[1:05:51] maybe all known a bad art in our days
[1:05:54] and there's things that are positive
[1:05:55] there's things that can be very very
[1:05:56] negative but my inspiration is not to
[1:05:58] drive us into that type of creativity
[1:06:02] but to recognize that if God says be
[1:06:04] creative that me is a vessel of God me
[1:06:06] being a canvas me being flesh that the
[1:06:09] word is laying there and as long as that
[1:06:11] word is laying there it will be creative
[1:06:14] because it's a deratization
[1:06:17] [Applause]
[1:06:25] of God's Vision God's desire you are the
[1:06:28] art of
[1:06:30] God I know there's a a maybe a play on
[1:06:32] words in there and it's not intentional
[1:06:34] that they have the heart of God the
[1:06:35] purpose of God the desire of God and if
[1:06:37] there's anything maybe to help it make
[1:06:39] it click that if there's the heart of
[1:06:40] God you are the expression of
[1:06:43] it it's laying there it will be creative
[1:06:46] in other words if we can get out of the
[1:06:48] painter's
[1:06:49] way if we can stop trying to rest and
[1:06:52] twist the way that it's to look like and
[1:06:55] to present ourselves in a way that we
[1:06:56] think it should
[1:06:57] look he'll paint Christ in
[1:07:01] you I I I'll say this en closing
[1:07:04] musicians feel free to come to your
[1:07:07] instruments I I I just ask God to help
[1:07:09] me to say this let me give you an
[1:07:12] analogy that there's some that really
[1:07:14] lock up and I have had great fellowship
[1:07:16] with Brothers on this subject and heard
[1:07:18] it ministered to where there are
[1:07:20] artificial barriers that begin to be
[1:07:22] placed on predestination
[1:07:26] and the reason is is that if you preach
[1:07:28] predestination too much then people will
[1:07:32] take that as a sign or permission to go
[1:07:35] in
[1:07:36] sin and there's that that teaching of
[1:07:41] predestination that becomes rotten
[1:07:42] nonsense and it's that interpretation
[1:07:44] the impression that people get from the
[1:07:46] word of God that says that pre you're
[1:07:47] predestinated you cannot be lost that
[1:07:50] once saved always saved and we realize
[1:07:52] well there's a truth to that but then it
[1:07:53] can become perverted and recognizing all
[1:07:56] the people that have
[1:07:58] perverted the the the the expression of
[1:08:02] predestination what we can do is begin
[1:08:04] to put artificial restraints and
[1:08:08] barriers on the creativity of
[1:08:11] Christ in in other words say well
[1:08:13] there's no predestination there's no
[1:08:14] this and no that and we try to massage
[1:08:16] it and change it to where the picture
[1:08:17] makes more
[1:08:18] sense and I say that to say this that
[1:08:21] there
[1:08:22] is maybe a caution there can be a little
[1:08:25] bit of
[1:08:27] nervousness
[1:08:32] about setting forth an individualistic
[1:08:37] expression of Christ in each
[1:08:40] person and removing all the artificial
[1:08:44] barriers and constraints on God's
[1:08:46] creativity in trusting God's
[1:08:50] word and the spirit of Christ in you to
[1:08:53] bring forth the work of art that he's
[1:08:57] creating and not take so much just it's
[1:09:00] as if we're standing over the shoulder
[1:09:02] of God and going
[1:09:04] really they're going to let them do
[1:09:06] that let's change that instead of just
[1:09:10] saying Lord You're the
[1:09:12] Potter now if it's contrary to the word
[1:09:14] look at the artist real quick how'd you
[1:09:16] get over here right we want to be Christ
[1:09:19] we want to be according to his word
[1:09:20] there's a there's sufficient detail in
[1:09:22] the message of the hour in the word of
[1:09:24] God for us to be able to look at the
[1:09:25] fruits of something and say that that's
[1:09:27] not the word of God but where we have
[1:09:30] rested and we've twisted and we've tried
[1:09:32] to come up with these cheap knockoffs
[1:09:34] where we're all just homogenized and we
[1:09:35] all just become in our own H uh Echo
[1:09:38] chambers of the message and we try to
[1:09:41] reproduce the these message
[1:09:44] Believers I wrote a song when I was a
[1:09:46] young message believer it's it's like a
[1:09:48] I got my uh my belt buckle and my STS
[1:09:50] and hat I'm on my way and we did a nice
[1:09:52] little diddy we used to sing around a
[1:09:53] campfire and there was this where you
[1:09:55] could create this this image of a
[1:09:57] message believer do you hunt do you
[1:10:00] drive this and do you have a belt buckle
[1:10:02] and do you have a picture of the cloud
[1:10:04] and right have you rubbed the stone on
[1:10:07] an Easter yet right there's just a way
[1:10:09] where we just created some sort of uh Co
[1:10:12] message
[1:10:13] cosplay and we and our conventions
[1:10:15] become nothing but cosplay special
[1:10:18] meetings nothing but cosplay and invite
[1:10:20] this Creator invite that Creator invite
[1:10:22] this influencer and it's it's its own
[1:10:24] world that's so far away from
[1:10:28] reality and so maybe we find that
[1:10:30] there's some safety in that and
[1:10:31] structure and the and these are the
[1:10:33] parameters but I believe that if we are
[1:10:36] artificially restricting God's
[1:10:38] creativity it'll never produce this
[1:10:43] masterpiece I'm not advocating that
[1:10:45] anything goes but I'm advocating that
[1:10:48] we've got to let God have his
[1:10:50] way to let him mold us and to make us
[1:10:53] and Lord if you want to express yourself
[1:10:57] in me then I want you to express
[1:10:59] yourself in
[1:11:02] me I believe we can trust God to do
[1:11:05] that I may in my language be using may
[1:11:08] seem to give uh some of you may feel
[1:11:10] like well this is a lot of latitude that
[1:11:12] God's going to be expressed in different
[1:11:13] cultures and ideas and Lifestyles and I
[1:11:16] want to be the example to this and I
[1:11:18] want to be example to that and and you
[1:11:20] might use it as an excuse to find your
[1:11:22] way in com into
[1:11:24] compromise but I will say this the word
[1:11:26] is no
[1:11:28] pushover God is not a a a pushover he's
[1:11:32] not Doty you will not get away from
[1:11:36] it and if you will hold yourself
[1:11:39] accountable to the word of God the word
[1:11:41] will not let you get away with it and
[1:11:43] say ah you know you're just justifying
[1:11:45] it I was at a um a function one time in
[1:11:49] law school a good friend of mine he went
[1:11:51] to Seminary we had many many wonderful
[1:11:54] times of Fellowship around the word of
[1:11:55] God and a lengthy discussion on water
[1:11:58] baptism and finally at the end of the
[1:12:00] conclusion he said wow you know what
[1:12:02] Aaron I think you may be right and that
[1:12:04] was the end of it right because it was
[1:12:06] just about oh you may be right and we
[1:12:07] were sitting at a function one time and
[1:12:09] he was holding a beer he's drinking a
[1:12:12] beer and he's a minister he's a
[1:12:13] theologian he's a has a position in this
[1:12:15] church he was in and he was like why
[1:12:17] areen you drinking I'm
[1:12:18] like because the word of God he goes
[1:12:20] well I mean even the Bible says a little
[1:12:22] Wine's good for the belly I'm like cores
[1:12:25] since when has that been a little
[1:12:27] wine right and I just looked at me and I
[1:12:30] said Stephen you know you're using that
[1:12:33] scripture to justify something that's
[1:12:35] wrong and he was exposed in that moment
[1:12:39] and I trust that the word of God will do
[1:12:41] that for some of us here constantly and
[1:12:43] consistently resting and twisting the
[1:12:46] word to suit our own
[1:12:49] picture Lord I'm done playing
[1:12:52] games hash no filter
[1:12:55] I want to be an accurate reflection of
[1:12:57] the word of God in this hour and not
[1:12:59] contrive myself to be some uh uh
[1:13:02] somebody destitute and humble a and and
[1:13:05] lacking certain things because that's
[1:13:07] what the word says I should be or nor do
[1:13:09] I want to be opulent and extravagant in
[1:13:11] some sort of religious spiritual way
[1:13:13] because that's what I think the world
[1:13:14] says I should or the word says I should
[1:13:15] be or try too hard to be worldly so that
[1:13:18] you can be a hip message
[1:13:20] believer God I just want to be what you
[1:13:23] need me to be in this hour
[1:13:26] let me pray for you as we stand
[1:13:30] together and if brother Michael could be
[1:13:33] ready to come and sing I'd appreciate
[1:13:38] that communion today at
[1:13:42] 4:00 let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:13:44] of
[1:13:46] prayer with your heads bowed if anyone
[1:13:48] would like prayer today and there's just
[1:13:51] a particular need you might have in your
[1:13:52] heart just lift your hand to the Lord
[1:13:54] whatever the may be if it's very precise
[1:13:57] as to these things we ministered this
[1:13:58] morning it's in your heart I'm not uh
[1:14:03] making a specific call except that if
[1:14:05] you desire prayer and there's a need
[1:14:07] that you have just lift your hand let's
[1:14:08] pray our heavenly
[1:14:10] father Lord I just felt a a a
[1:14:13] nervousness today Lord as I
[1:14:16] ministered I don't know that maybe I was
[1:14:19] myself and may maybe there's a good in
[1:14:23] that but Lord I ask that you for forgive
[1:14:25] me for whatever failures
[1:14:28] and lack of faithfulness in my own life
[1:14:31] that would have hindered me today and
[1:14:33] just been a barrier I trust that for
[1:14:36] me it was only felt and seen on my
[1:14:40] end and that you have found good ground
[1:14:42] today that your word penetrated it made
[1:14:45] spiritual
[1:14:47] sense Lord Brother Bram said in many
[1:14:50] different places that he was a lover of
[1:14:51] art he told certain stories many times
[1:14:54] of him
[1:14:55] visiting uh museums and admiring
[1:14:58] [Music]
[1:15:01] art and
[1:15:03] I I myself feeling the same way and
[1:15:06] admiring certain artist and having read
[1:15:09] books and studying
[1:15:11] and trying to understand more about the
[1:15:13] creative Pro process and those different
[1:15:15] things I I realized that it can seem
[1:15:20] from one glance to be entirely carnal
[1:15:26] but Lord I
[1:15:28] pray that you would help the believer to
[1:15:32] recognize this great challenge today in
[1:15:34] the in this
[1:15:37] hour is that the brightest light that's
[1:15:40] going to
[1:15:41] shine is going to be the image in the
[1:15:45] image of a man or a woman a child a
[1:15:49] teenager that looks like all the other
[1:15:51] canvases in the world today
[1:15:55] that we are not just Amber orbs floating
[1:15:58] through the world and people seeing us a
[1:16:02] a as these mystical creatures of light
[1:16:04] with great powers are drawn to something
[1:16:07] Beyond themselves and cry out that they
[1:16:10] too could become these mythical
[1:16:14] orbs but Lord we've got to be Christ in
[1:16:18] humanity that there's still a badger
[1:16:21] skin there's still a veil there's still
[1:16:22] a canvas that looks lot like other
[1:16:26] humans but in the way that we live and
[1:16:28] the way that we act we are expressing
[1:16:32] the
[1:16:33] holy and Lord that was one of the Great
[1:16:39] [Music]
[1:16:53] wrestlingspotlight Halos and perfect
[1:16:57] expressions of religious artifacts then
[1:16:59] it's never real to us it's
[1:17:02] unattainable so God I pray that we could
[1:17:04] become bearers of light to help us oh
[1:17:08] Lord to overcome Prejudice and resting
[1:17:11] and twisting and
[1:17:13] cosplay to become the very art of God in
[1:17:16] this day and age I want to know how to
[1:17:19] live like
[1:17:20] you Lord I want to know what it looks
[1:17:22] like in this day and age I want to know
[1:17:23] what it sounds like
[1:17:26] Lord we can't just all download playlist
[1:17:28] of gorian chants and pipe music and and
[1:17:32] try to create some sort of somber holy
[1:17:34] religious order Lord how is it reflected
[1:17:37] in my music how is it reflected in My
[1:17:39] Worship how is it reflected in my dress
[1:17:41] how is it reflected in my obedience and
[1:17:43] my
[1:17:45] Recreation how Lord can I pursue certain
[1:17:47] Endeavors and likes in a way that brings
[1:17:49] you glory and also testifies accurately
[1:17:51] of your nature and your character
[1:17:56] that I do not use so many artificial
[1:17:58] man-made constraints that I create a lab
[1:18:00] that with one breach it just causes such
[1:18:03] great infection and contamination that
[1:18:04] the old system falls
[1:18:07] apart but Lord may I be able to enter
[1:18:10] into the
[1:18:11] world as a sheep among wolves with a
[1:18:15] life and a power so strong that it's
[1:18:16] inoculated against
[1:18:18] infection and yet has such great power
[1:18:21] that by the virtue of my life it can
[1:18:25] cause others to be influenced and to be
[1:18:27] transformed into an art of
[1:18:31] God we're praying today for us as a
[1:18:33] church I'm praying today for our
[1:18:35] families I'm praying today for
[1:18:40] myself we are on this great
[1:18:44] Battlefield and we must choose right
[1:18:49] now whether or not we'll let you
[1:18:51] paint Christ in US
[1:18:55] or we stubbornly choose to paint our own
[1:19:00] self-portrait help us Lord I pray as I
[1:19:02] ask all this in the name of the Lord
[1:19:03] Jesus Christ amen
