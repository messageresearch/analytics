[0:00] I would like to entitle this uh Small
[0:04] Talk
[0:17] deity and truly uh to come to this Psalm
[0:21] here verse
[0:24] 7as he says it will not he will not be
[0:27] afraid of evil tidings
[0:33] his heart is steadfast trusting in the
[0:38] Lord now you need to be uh
[0:47] mature
[0:51] to to see that this part of the Bible
[0:54] become a reality in our
[0:58] heart
[1:01] it doesn't matter the news that you
[1:03] might
[1:04] hear you're not going to feel
[1:08] that not because you are
[1:11] somebody not because I am
[1:15] somebody but because of the god that we
[1:18] have
[1:21] amen the
[1:24] almighty uh you're not you're not going
[1:27] to preoccupy yourself with that
[1:31] what is it uh is it healing econom
[1:36] economy
[1:38] money
[1:45] stress because what affects one of the
[1:47] things that affects most this world is
[1:54] stress and as Christians sometimes we
[1:57] permit the devil to just drag us like
[2:00] the world is being
[2:04] dragged and the stress will sometimes
[2:06] lead us to uh
[2:15] unbelief because if you are trusting in
[2:17] God how are you going to uh solve a
[2:23] problem a lot of
[2:28] times we say that that we trust in
[2:34] God and we want God to give us the
[2:37] answer to our
[2:39] problems but our
[2:42] [Music]
[2:44] way and if it's not in our
[2:48] way then we feel that God's not
[2:54] working and at
[2:58] times we uh make the problem
[3:03] bigger now see
[3:07] deity we know that deity is God in human
[3:16] flesh lately I've been meditating on
[3:18] this word
[3:21] deity and even
[3:24] so we
[3:27] believe that God sent us a very powerful
[3:33] Prophet now he was revealed through
[3:37] [Music]
[3:38] him because no human being can do what
[3:41] he's
[3:43] done through
[3:45] him amen we all believe in that deity
[3:49] Amen in the prophet
[3:51] right that God brought
[3:56] down and
[3:57] revealed and he had
[4:01] discern the hearts of the people through
[4:03] the
[4:05] prophet now it had to be the almighty
[4:09] God because he had
[4:17] promised that just like he discerned the
[4:21] heart of
[4:24] Sarah likewise it had to be in this last
[4:28] days and it
[4:35] happened and there's a lot of tapes that
[4:38] you can hear from Brother brandham Where
[4:39] he discerned the the heart of the
[4:45] people and it's uh it's very beautiful
[4:48] to believe in
[4:50] deity because God promised
[4:53] itos because he promised that I would
[4:55] not leave you orphan or alone solos
[4:59] alone
[5:04] he said I will send the comforter the
[5:06] Holy
[5:09] Spirit that's
[5:12] deity it's
[5:14] beautiful to
[5:16] believe and it's very
[5:18] easy to believe in
[5:22] deity in the prophets of the
[5:28] Bible
[5:33] it is easy to believe that there was
[5:36] deity in brother
[5:38] Bram because of what God did through
[5:45] him it's very easy sometimes to believe
[5:48] that deity is in the
[5:52] pastor and even so
[5:56] God uh told Brother Branham
[6:01] if you
[6:03] do if you
[6:06] can get the people and that's where the
[6:09] little problem
[6:10] exists now if you
[6:13] can get the people to
[6:21] believe nothing nothing can be
[6:24] impossible canc not even
[6:28] cancer
[6:30] but there was a
[6:33] condition that the people had to
[6:37] believe that it was God through
[6:47] him a lot of people did not believe and
[6:50] therefore did not receive their
[6:55] healing now myself about 20 years ago
[7:04] while I was cutting here on 75th and B
[7:09] Road uh it happened or God sent
[7:13] me a
[7:19] client back then uh that person that
[7:21] client was between 60 and
[7:24] 70 and as I was speaking to him or or
[7:27] talking to him
[7:34] don't know how I mentioned the the last
[7:37] name of
[7:39] brandom I believe I believe I was uh
[7:42] talking about the Bible to
[7:46] him and of course he was not a believer
[7:48] of the
[7:51] message then he said you know what I was
[7:54] in one of his campaigns when he was here
[7:55] in
[7:56] Phoenix me and my brother
[8:03] and we went to one of his campaigns uh
[8:05] to see if it was true what he was
[8:11] saying and as we were standing as the
[8:13] line was forming to uh uh for the
[8:16] healing service to pray for the
[8:20] sick we thought that it wasn't
[8:22] believable or that that was
[8:26] untrue now he was a very good preacher
[8:30] and a good
[8:33] evangelist but he never mentioned that
[8:35] he was a
[8:38] prophet now uh to him he was just a good
[8:41] preacher and a good
[8:44] evangelist and as me and my brother were
[8:47] uh
[8:49] observing then my brother all of a
[8:51] sudden remember
[8:55] something that I had uh stomped on my uh
[8:59] big
[9:01] toe and it was swollen and
[9:06] purple and he said oh I remember that
[9:09] happened cuz I didn't remember and he
[9:14] said and he said why don't you go
[9:16] forward and see if it's
[9:19] true so I got in
[9:24] line and all of a sudden as I came back
[9:28] from the line
[9:30] my brother was waiting for
[9:36] me and the service was
[9:40] over and when the service was over
[9:43] we exited out and then my brother uh I
[9:46] told him why don't you take your shoe
[9:50] off and I took my shoe
[9:54] off and my and my toe was as normal as
[9:57] the other toe
[10:02] he said God used that
[10:07] man how not to believe
[10:11] brothers that it was God
[10:14] using Brother
[10:18] brandham
[10:23] deity but if you
[10:26] can get the people to
[10:32] believe
[10:35] now God gave us
[10:39] promises not go throughout the world and
[10:41] preach the
[10:44] gospel and you can put your hands on the
[10:49] sick but all of that is there there's a
[10:56] um a compromise or or something that you
[10:59] must
[11:02] do now you and
[11:06] me uh I don't believe that it was just
[11:09] for brother
[11:12] brandham now I can see it now that
[11:16] way this is what I
[11:19] believe that it wasn't just for brother
[11:23] BR it is for each and every True
[11:27] Believer we must must
[11:30] do that we must want that the people
[11:33] will believe
[11:37] us that they will see us as children of
[11:42] God because even
[11:46] God if they didn't believe
[11:50] Jesus he didn't do no
[11:56] Miracle the people have to believe
[12:01] us but the problem
[12:07] begins with
[12:10] deity with
[12:15] ourselves a lot of times not even
[12:17] ourselves we believe
[12:24] ourselves we we claim to be Sons and
[12:27] Daughters of God
[12:37] but us ourselves don't even believe in
[12:40] the commission that was given to
[12:45] us but you know one
[12:52] thing I've been studying a little bit on
[12:54] the seven compound names of
[12:57] God
[12:59] Jehovah
[13:04] Gyra God will
[13:08] provide just with that one
[13:11] alone if we just believe that
[13:17] alone we would almost get to uh uh fig
[13:22] uh just have everything uh at hand there
[13:25] to believe
[13:27] amena Jehovah
[13:30] Rafa uh Jehovah your healer
[13:37] amen
[13:41] Jehovah uh your
[13:46] banner but what's what's a flag on your
[13:49] banner what is it good
[13:52] for so you can
[13:55] identify
[13:57] amen
[14:02] but a lot of times not even
[14:05] ourselves uh no what is it that identify
[14:15] us you know a ship cannot navigate if it
[14:18] doesn't have a flag where it comes
[14:24] from it should be the same with the
[14:27] Christian I've always
[14:31] believed that a true
[14:35] Christian now me myself I have
[14:38] believed I I'm not saying that it has to
[14:41] be that
[14:43] way but I have believe with all my heart
[14:47] that you and
[14:49] me that people should identify
[14:54] us and it should be something there that
[14:57] would make that would look different
[15:00] different in
[15:05] work wherever we might
[15:11] be that if there was a a if there were
[15:14] to put a
[15:16] line and they would put us right there
[15:19] in the middle of that
[15:23] line it should be something that it
[15:26] would stand out from the people that are
[15:28] there on that line
[15:33] amen
[15:35] Jehovah our
[15:40] Banner but a lot of times instead of
[15:42] picking up the banner or the flag we
[15:44] hide
[15:48] it Jehovah Shalom Jehovah
[15:56] Shalom Jehovah is our our
[16:02] peace our
[16:05] peace in the Christian
[16:13] home uh it should be in abundant Jehovah
[16:19] Shalom our
[16:27] peace and not just in our
[16:31] homes people should see
[16:37] us like
[16:41] someone that can help
[16:46] them and not like just another problem
[16:48] in their
[16:52] lives Shalom Jehovah
[16:57] shalom if you are a son of
[17:02] God you should have peace for the people
[17:05] that surround
[17:09] you not more
[17:12] problems no
[17:14] more or more
[17:26] stress yes Jehovah
[17:30] Jehovah is my
[17:32] pastor and we will not lack
[17:41] anything that right there if if we just
[17:44] believe it it doesn't need an
[17:46] explication of that you
[17:53] knowu Jehovah
[17:57] shiku uh Jehovah's
[18:02] Justice and Jehovah
[18:06] shama Jehovah is
[18:11] present every
[18:16] Christian we should
[18:19] have in our present
[18:27] life manifestation of all these
[18:32] names
[18:38] Jehovah but brother
[18:47] brandham I'm sorry I was reading uh the
[18:51] statue of a perfect
[18:53] man and as I was
[18:56] studying uh the stature of a perfect
[19:00] man the fruits of the
[19:03] spirit did you know that every one of
[19:06] these compound
[19:11] names they go hand in hand with every
[19:16] fruit of the
[19:18] spirit the first name of Jehovah that
[19:22] appeared in the
[19:25] Bible it was Jehovah Gyra
[19:29] Jehovah will
[19:34] provide and the first
[19:37] fruit is
[19:42] Faith uh God cannot provide unless me
[19:45] and you have
[19:48] faith but you know I found something out
[19:52] in my
[19:56] life that God
[19:59] uh send to
[20:05] us that's why I've been enjoying this uh
[20:09] messages from brother Aaron uh the
[20:15] kingdom he says search ye first the
[20:18] kingdom of God and the
[20:21] rest will
[20:23] come uh and be added onto
[20:27] you
[20:28] but the problem that I found out in my
[20:35] life that I was looking at first to be
[20:38] added on to
[20:41] me it was the kingdom of
[20:47] God uh for a long time as a
[20:52] Christian I was looking for those added
[20:55] on things that were
[20:57] promised the
[21:01] blessings to prosper
[21:07] economically so many
[21:10] things that I forgot to search for the
[21:12] kingdom of
[21:14] God to look for the holy
[21:17] spirit in my
[21:20] life none of these
[21:23] names will have an
[21:27] effect
[21:29] or will be manifested in my
[21:39] life see it's like that man that brought
[21:43] that his
[21:44] son uh that was full of demons unto the
[21:53] Lord he said I took him to your
[21:55] disciples and the demons wouldn't leave
[21:57] them
[22:00] and then the disciples asked how come we
[22:02] couldn't get that de those demons
[22:05] out because these
[22:08] demons only come out
[22:12] with with uh
[22:15] fasting and
[22:19] prayer now a lot of times
[22:22] Brothers I have found
[22:26] myself that I want to be found or named
[22:30] a Son of
[22:34] God but but I don't want any of what
[22:37] comes with it being a Son of
[22:40] God or that and that is to
[22:44] pray uh to
[22:50] fast read my Bible
[22:54] daily listen to the
[22:56] message
[23:01] you see we
[23:03] know that faith is a
[23:08] foundation of the
[23:12] growth or Revelation what brother Aon
[23:16] was speaking
[23:19] about faith
[23:22] faith we must have faith
[23:26] amen but to have
[23:29] faith we must be born
[23:35] again we need to find the kingdom of
[23:41] God if we
[23:44] don't then those demons or devils are
[23:47] going to laugh about
[23:53] us and not just the
[23:56] Devils even the people
[24:08] right sometimes we don't uh take on the
[24:11] challenges that the devil might present
[24:13] to
[24:14] us because we don't
[24:17] feel
[24:21] prepared it's because we
[24:26] know
[24:29] that we are not fulfilling our uh duties
[24:33] as a
[24:38] Christian brother brother Bram uh spoke
[24:42] and said you you have two things to
[24:46] do
[24:48] daily is to
[24:50] pray and to uh reach your Bible
[24:56] amen
[24:59] and we also should
[25:03] fast that
[25:05] way because when he
[25:09] said and these signs shall follow those
[25:12] who
[25:16] believe now right there he didn't place
[25:19] the ministry
[25:21] there he put the believer there
[25:26] amen I you know
[25:31] now there he didn't say uh go and talk
[25:34] to your pastor and the deacons to come
[25:36] and pray for this sick
[25:38] person he said the
[25:45] believer but many times we do what Adam
[25:50] did now he went and hid himself when he
[25:54] found out that he wasn't right with
[25:56] God
[25:59] because when he was uh right with
[26:02] God then he would come out and meet
[26:09] him that's why it's very
[26:13] important to examine ourselves
[26:18] daily see those uh footprints that we're
[26:22] leaving
[26:26] behind
[26:29] what is that image that we're leaving
[26:37] behind a lot of times we just uh forget
[26:41] to look
[26:46] back and see how crooked or what way
[26:51] we're or going
[26:56] forward
[26:58] and a lot of times if we just took the
[27:01] time to just look occasionally
[27:08] back and see our
[27:14] Footprints and if
[27:16] we're walking
[27:20] straight or maybe we're just zigzagging
[27:24] one side to
[27:26] another
[27:28] that would help
[27:29] us to line ourselves
[27:36] up with just by our own
[27:43] Footprints but a lot of times we don't
[27:45] want to be
[27:50] judged remember one
[27:53] thing if we are part of the
[27:56] Bride
[27:59] we are being judged as it is right
[28:08] now and if you and I are being judged we
[28:12] should be
[28:21] happy but we should be given a good
[28:26] example
[28:28] and you know as as I would listen to
[28:33] that oh yes I would say you know what
[28:36] the people of of the the world should
[28:39] should look at me uh like this in in in
[28:42] this
[28:42] manner and and that's
[28:46] good but it would always go above
[28:50] me in in my
[28:56] home how is my wife uh seeing
[29:02] me how is my son looking at
[29:11] me how are my co-workers looking at
[29:20] me are they seeing part of
[29:26] God
[29:28] you know and and I remember when I was
[29:29] like around
[29:32] 20 like a
[29:37] worker and now uh as a Christian now I
[29:40] feel
[29:43] ashamed because every day I would just
[29:53] complain of
[29:56] everything
[29:59] it was more of a problem than a solution
[30:01] for me at
[30:05] work I didn't I didn't think that people
[30:08] were looking at us as a Son of God
[30:16] there and not just at
[30:20] work now my wife is here and she's a
[30:24] witness at
[30:26] church
[30:31] everything would bother me and and I
[30:33] would complain even as I exited the the
[30:36] the
[30:38] service I was already
[30:41] complaining because the preacher took
[30:43] too
[30:48] long maybe because the the the brother
[30:52] that came and directed The the song
[30:54] leader just made one more song too
[30:59] long the place where they set
[31:10] me for me it was a problem with the
[31:15] deacons don't you know who I
[31:19] am why are you sitting me
[31:24] there you should uh have a place for me
[31:26] uh reserved over there on that
[31:31] side yes
[31:34] brother when me and you have not been
[31:37] born
[31:39] again we are a problem
[31:47] walking we we may uh you know make
[31:50] believe that we're good
[31:55] Christians and you know before uh being
[31:58] born
[32:02] again A lot of times we look for
[32:07] knowledge before the Holy
[32:12] Spirit and then we become experts on the
[32:17] Bible we uh turn to being experts on the
[32:24] message so we can just complain of what
[32:27] other people are
[32:32] doing but not to judge our own
[32:39] life that's why for me
[32:43] for it's very important and it is
[32:46] important to
[32:49] understand the three stages of
[32:56] Grace
[32:57] F understand if I've been born again
[33:00] because that's
[33:04] fundamental to understand
[33:06] deity in me in me in
[33:13] myself uh deity will not come to
[33:18] be if we you and I are not born again
[33:23] right
[33:25] good
[33:31] uh we could believe in
[33:33] deity in another
[33:36] person but the hardest
[33:40] thing is to
[33:44] believe deity in yourself and
[33:51] myself what did God ordain us to do or
[33:54] send us to do is to do it
[34:05] myself look I I believe it with my
[34:08] heart when you are sure
[34:12] yourself that you have been born
[34:19] again you're not preoccupied or you
[34:22] don't
[34:24] worry about the pastor a lot or maybe
[34:27] your
[34:30] pastor because of of what teaching he's
[34:33] going to
[34:35] give
[34:39] why because if the holy spirit is with
[34:44] you and if he makes a mistake an
[34:49] error you are confiding in the spirit
[34:52] that's in you
[34:55] Brothers cor no so you can discern what
[34:59] you're uh digesting is good or
[35:03] wrong
[35:05] or or any
[35:09] preacher or if the pastor sends you to
[35:12] do
[35:15] something I'm not afraid for the pastor
[35:17] to send me to do
[35:19] something first of
[35:22] all because I believe in my heart that
[35:25] he is a man of God
[35:29] right and he's not going to send me to
[35:31] do something that's
[35:35] incorrect and even if he was to make an
[35:37] error a
[35:40] mistake the spirit that's inside of me
[35:43] is going to help
[35:49] me but we have to confide in what we
[35:52] believe and what what we
[35:55] trust
[36:00] we can have a lot of
[36:03] knowledge but if we don't have
[36:07] Revelation Nicodemus said to to the
[36:10] Lord we
[36:12] know we know who you
[36:16] are uh he
[36:18] knew but he never accepted it
[36:23] himself he had
[36:25] knowledge
[36:27] but he had no
[36:35] Revelation so a lot of
[36:40] times I was just out there finding
[36:43] myself looking for
[36:45] knowledge but no
[36:51] Revelation and many times
[36:54] knowledge like I said a while back
[36:59] will take us to be a
[37:02] problem because at
[37:05] times like we have so much
[37:09] knowledge then it's very
[37:12] difficult uh to
[37:14] understand and align
[37:18] ourselves according to the word of
[37:25] God we have to
[37:32] search understand I had a real hard time
[37:35] why brother Brandon would say at
[37:38] times search or look for the Holy
[37:42] Spirit was desperation
[37:50] desperate because me and you cannot do
[37:55] nothing as
[37:58] Christians without the Holy
[38:05] Spirit to begin with we cannot even uh
[38:09] make the first
[38:11] step the
[38:12] fundamental or the foundation is
[38:19] Faith what good is it to believe that
[38:21] God can make Miracles if we don't have
[38:25] faith
[38:29] if you don't have faith then you don't
[38:30] have
[38:37] virtue perhaps we can be in a place or
[38:41] arrive to a
[38:44] place now me and myself uh
[38:48] personally I never knew brother
[38:55] brand to see that God was using that
[39:03] person but God did permit me to be right
[39:07] next to my
[39:10] mother
[39:11] person th this is the one
[39:18] person that I have seen that God had
[39:21] moved
[39:22] tremendously in a
[39:25] person I
[39:29] even seeing uh dead Rise Up from the
[39:34] dead now I can't say and deny that God
[39:37] does not
[39:40] exist because perhaps I didn't see
[39:43] brother but God
[39:45] permitted through my
[39:49] mother see that God that's
[39:53] Almighty and like my father
[39:56] oh like a f like like a
[40:02] father I have to uh go forward or give
[40:07] it to my
[40:12] son it is one of my uh I I preoccupy
[40:15] myself with that's just a worry of me in
[40:19] life
[40:20] now that my
[40:23] son can
[40:25] see
[40:28] to see the God that he listens to in
[40:31] this
[40:33] church in my
[40:39] life because if it ain't that is just a
[40:42] a word of
[40:44] mouth in it's my
[40:47] responsibility that my
[40:50] son with my life with my
[40:55] works see that God that's
[41:00] acting because if we go to the Book of
[41:05] Judges it says that the generations
[41:08] begin to wither or fall apart from
[41:13] God because they stopped seeing his
[41:16] works his his mighty
[41:23] works it is our responsibility
[41:27] that our generation that's coming behind
[41:30] us does not get away from
[41:40] God because without
[41:45] works it is just another denomination
[41:48] like any other
[41:55] one what good is it for my son that I
[42:01] believe in a revelation that God sent
[42:08] down that we have the highest
[42:12] Revelation but if we are afraid to uh
[42:16] pray for the
[42:19] sick what what good is it to my
[42:24] son to know
[42:29] that God had has revealed all the Seven
[42:35] Seals but in daily life he cannot see
[42:38] that powerful
[42:39] God
[42:45] Amen
[42:47] however to show
[42:50] that I have to
[42:53] search the kingdom of God
[42:56] we have to search the kingdom of
[42:59] God and
[43:01] be if we can say it this
[43:05] way like a buffet that's
[43:08] walking what do you
[43:11] need Jehovah will
[43:15] provide pass
[43:24] peace do you need
[43:26] for me to help you to identify
[43:29] yourself
[43:34] Jehovah what do you
[43:38] need in what stage are you in uh what
[43:41] steps are you in your stage
[43:45] you maybe I'm at the stage of
[43:50] Faith but I know that my brother here is
[43:52] in
[43:55] virtue let's just bring him out here so
[43:57] he could
[43:58] pray what is
[44:00] virtue
[44:04] power and virtue came out of him that's
[44:07] what the Bible
[44:11] said brother Bram said it is
[44:15] power it is science
[44:19] or or
[44:24] knowledge temp it is
[44:29] templin hold on
[44:32] to now that if you can be tempered
[44:35] that's very
[44:40] difficult it
[44:46] says that in the hard times or the tough
[44:51] times that's where the leaders you know
[44:54] who your leaders are in the tough times
[45:00] because they're they
[45:05] Temperance not just uh are are taking
[45:09] abide by what they
[45:16] see even to know
[45:21] ourselves I am uh learning
[45:24] myself uh to be
[45:29] Temperance the problem is not that
[45:31] things bother
[45:34] you the problem is how you react to
[45:41] that if me and you have not learned to
[45:44] have
[45:46] Temperance uh to control
[45:49] ourselves you need the holy spirit
[45:54] amen do you have temperance
[45:59] in my youth I didn't have
[46:02] it everything bother
[46:08] me and even now there's things that
[46:10] bother
[46:11] me but the
[46:14] difference is my reaction to
[46:17] that to those things that bother me
[46:22] now if it's me that it's the problem
[46:26] or that I'm
[46:29] exaggerating or is it the other person
[46:32] that's doing
[46:33] that I can help him do things a little
[46:39] better
[46:43] patience
[46:45] Shalom Jehovah
[46:47] Shalom that's what patience is
[46:54] peace that's another
[46:58] thing that cost me quite a
[47:02] bit and that
[47:05] Brothers if me and you are not connected
[47:08] with God
[47:12] daily we are not going to have
[47:15] Temperance and we're not going to have
[47:20] patience and brother Bram says
[47:24] patience
[47:29] now it's not the patience of what the
[47:31] world gives you even though it
[47:37] is but on the fruits of the spirit the
[47:40] patience that he's talking
[47:44] about is the patience that you're calm
[47:48] because God's going to do what he has to
[47:50] do
[47:53] amen he has the and it's
[47:58] difficult because God never works within
[48:01] our
[48:02] time our
[48:07] way and that really took a toll on me it
[48:10] cost me a
[48:12] lot to understand and to accept
[48:22] it uh fear of God
[48:30] the last
[48:32] one uh brotherly
[48:36] loveah Jehovah
[48:39] sh Jehovah is
[48:42] here how many
[48:45] times someone
[48:48] needs someone
[48:51] else yah sh Jehovah sh
[48:56] to feel
[48:57] God remember
[49:00] something
[49:01] God is a
[49:05] spirit and he needs a human
[49:09] body so he can
[49:13] perform that's what brother brandham
[49:15] taught
[49:17] us so he can show his
[49:23] love what good is it for people people
[49:26] to say that we believe a god of
[49:32] love but they never see that love
[49:38] amen that we believe in a God who
[49:42] saves and we're the first ones to uh
[49:45] kick
[49:50] them and all
[49:54] this
[49:57] I'm I'm speaking about the ones that are
[49:59] near us they're the ones that see us
[50:06] 24/7 sometimes it's easy to uh conquer
[50:08] someone who sees us only two or three or
[50:11] four
[50:16] hours but the ones that we live with do
[50:19] they see us in the same
[50:24] manner
[50:28] what do we
[50:30] need but the but
[50:34] faith is like a
[50:38] muscle if we don't fortify it we don't
[50:41] exercise
[50:45] it it'll never be
[50:51] strong look the uh if a person that's
[50:54] never made made any uh physical uh
[50:58] things or
[51:01] exercise cannot go and just lift up a
[51:05] weight of 100
[51:10] pounds he has to start with a 10 pound
[51:13] or a 20
[51:17] PB it's the same thing with
[51:20] faith if you've never practiced
[51:24] it
[51:25] is you're not going to come up and raise
[51:27] someone from the
[51:32] dead because maybe you haven't even
[51:35] prayed for a
[51:38] headache that's
[51:41] faith we have to practice Faith
[51:45] Amen to fortify
[51:50] it if me and you do not
[51:54] practice
[51:56] we can never be strong in
[52:00] faith
[52:02] deity deity is God in
[52:05] us to
[52:08] believe all of his
[52:11] promises not not just believe them to
[52:15] understand that
[52:19] God gave those promises to the
[52:23] people but the people
[52:28] needed so those promises can come
[52:31] through you and
[52:36] me all those
[52:39] words
[52:42] and must be uh be manifested in
[52:50] someone I want to ask that you uh stand
[52:54] on your feet what
