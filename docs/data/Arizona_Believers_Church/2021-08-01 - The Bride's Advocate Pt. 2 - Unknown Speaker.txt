TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen first john chapter two are we gonna read verses one to six again first john chapter two verses one to six we'll mention it again at the end we're having a meeting next sunday at 2 30 here um that's a church meeting for the members of the church we'd like to have a meeting for everyone uh we could maybe call it a business meeting a church meeting at 2 30 next sunday here at the church first john chapter 2 verse 1 my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous that's what we're focusing on is that phrase we have an advocate with the father and it it expounds upon this advocate and he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments as a liar and the truth is not in him but who so keepeth his word and him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked and we saw the symmetry with john chapter 14 and 15 and 16 last time on those commandments and the comforter and the holy ghost if we could bow our heads in a word of prayer a gracious heavenly fathers we stand in your divine presence today we're requesting your assistance lord we desire your help as speaker and listener lord we realize that unless you would come and do the part of the here to open up our hearts and to quicken things to us then the part of the speaker is is in vain and lord if you would not come and anoint the speaker's lips and to move him out of the way and take that word and minister to our hearts then again lord it would be in vain but with your presence here with us working on both ends we believe that you can speak to us in a very profound and practical way today lord our hearts are mindful of the many that we know that are sick lord that are fighting sickness and affliction lord we think of sister karen propolis heard a positive report lord of how you're touching her we pray that you completely deliver her lord for sister karen pruitt may she be revived lord may she come out of this sleeping lord and this brain bleed may be gone may any negative damage or any damage that they believe has transpired lord may it be completely reversed may she be made well lord for brother tom earnest i ask that you'd heal him raise him up lord he's expressed a tremendous amount of support for the cause of christ lord in years of labor and and ministry we pray that you touch him and heal him comfort his family lord for those that are hurting that are sick that are not well lord those that are absent from us we pray that you'd help them strengthen them and encourage them father bless brother gene today on his birthday may you give him strength bless him and give him his heart's desires lord this service today is yours use it for our benefit father and for your glory we ask this in the name lord jesus christ amen it could be seated i'm just going to jump right into the subject of the bride's advocate again and i feel that though there's going to be maybe some backtracking and a little bit of reviewing that it really is a subject that doesn't need much uh much foundation or background you'll just be able to enter right into it but when we looked at last time we have an advocate which we're taking from first john chapter two verse one that advocate is the same word that's used for comforter and it's john he's the only writer in the new testament that uses the word the comforter or the advocate they're one the same so the advocate is the comforter our advocate is the holy ghost and we identified in scripture is how that this advocate of this comforter is an inside teacher we talk about the teacher the inside teacher the inner inner witness as we looked at it and so it's a it's something that in dwell dwells within the believer and from the inside it testifies to us from the inside it encourages us from the inside it supports us so it's not a comforter that's kind of on the outside you know kind of cheering us on uh telling us what to do externally but it's something that dwells on the inside and encourages us in john chapter 14 verses 16 and 17 jesus says and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever again we can see the example of advocacy jesus knowing that he's going to be gone prays for his disciples and he's telling them that i'm with you as your teacher as your master is your guide you're hearing me teach things and you're hearing me say things and i'm telling you where to go and what to do but when i'm gone i'm going to pray the father and he's going to send you the comforter and he will abide with you and we know not just with but in them forever and he says even the spirit of truth so our advocate is the comforter it is the holy spirit it is the spirit of truth and then it he makes this statement whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and this places the the function of the holy spirit or this role of the advocate this role of the comforter he's saying that only the born-again have this advocate only the born-again have it and and maybe the the lack of a robust amen is sympathy uh for the world that doesn't have it but only the elect have the this comforter only the elect had this advocate and and that means that to have it you must be born again so if there's somebody who does not have it the solution is to be born again then you can see the kingdom of heaven and here it says that the world does not know him nor can it receive them because they remain in a sinful state so it is not for the world the world cannot see him the world does not know but you know him for he dwelleth with with you and he shall be in you and this very phrase this uh periclatos in the greek it speaks to be alongside of to be divinely appointed to be summoned to be there so he's divinely appointed to ever remain within the believer if you've been born again you're always born again you can't be unaborn again we we really truly believe that once saved always save in the literal sense if you're saved you can't be unsaved if you're sealed you can't be unsealed and so if you have if you have the advocate if you have the comforter if you have the indwelling of the holy ghost on the soul when you're born again it ever remains there and so the role of an advocate is to be an inner strength the role of the advocate is to be a supporter from the inside to support you to encourage you to lead you and to guide you again he's an inside teacher so this begin to think a little bit more broadly about the holy ghost you've received it's not well i've been born again and now i have the holy ghost and it's some kind of a marker deep down inside your soul that identifies the fact that you're a christian but it's actually a vitality it's a power it's a life that lives on the inside of you to encourage you it lives on the inside of you to support you when you find that nobody else supports you nobody else understands you you can't get answers you're not sure you what to do there's a power on the inside of the believer that they can look to and say you're my advocate you're my supporter you're my leader you're my guide so you're not looking externally you're you're digging deep down within your soul and finding the resource that you need to be led to be encouraged to be supported an advocate in the scripture is one whose pleads on someone else's behalf so the advocate pleads on your behalf it supports your interest it promotes what's best for you so you want to listen to your advocate you don't want to listen to your own thoughts you want to listen to your advocate because he pleads on your behalf he supports your interest he actually promotes what is best for you the holy ghost is going to promote the things that are best for you and we one of the things that really stood out to me personally as i studied this over the last couple weeks is that our advocate is in this role of maintaining this unbroken continuity with god that if we did not have the advocate then we could come we could be in certain situations where we feel his presence and it can fall upon our flesh and we can rejoice and we can dance and we could even speak in tongues or or manifest different gifts and do different things but the advocate the one that dwells on the inside guarantees this unbroken continuity between the believer and god and he's there for that and why is he there because your soul is born again but your spirit and your mind aren't and the flesh wars against the soul and does everything it can to bring darkness and to bring confusion and bring this discontinuity as satan would desire to sift you as wheat but i have prayed for you that your faith fail not so that we could remain in harmony and continuity and in fellowship with the father i'm going to read i'm just going to read a number of different bullet points it's not a it's not a quote just yet but i'm just going to read all these different things that brother branham said the advocate was in the sermon what is the holy ghost and he's talking about the advocate he says it's a seal sign comforter deliver rest peace goodness healing power righteousness resurrection life these are all the things that he says the advocate is he's a seal he's a sign he's a comforter he's a deliverer he gives you rest he's peace he's goodness healing power righteousness resurrection life he said he's the god of heaven so this is something powerful that you have on the inside of you if it's the god of heaven it's not a get out of jail card that you have in your heart that you've got to present to god whenever he wants to throw you in hell that's not it at all it is god himself on the inside of you he says it has mercy it stands in your place it does things you can't do he's on your side he's an advocate he's for you he's not against you he's for you he says it's all that god has for you so if you want all that god has the advocate is there to bring it to you the advocate is there to lead you to receive it the advocate is there to show you how to take possession of it he says it's the assurance that god has received you and so there's there's just another i think that phrase to me is one of the most profound it's the assurance that god has received you when you have the advocate he assures you that you've been received does that mean a lot to you it should because we wrestle in our minds many times well am i accepted and am i worth it am i good enough have i been born again but the advocate is there to assure you that god has received you and he makes the statement it's god's open door to all these things so the advocate is the one that leads you through that door to participate in the healing and the resurrection the righteousness the power the deliverance the rest the peace the goodness all those things the advocate is the one that is going to allow you and teach you and train you and support you and encourage you to present possess everything that you have need of and he makes this statement brother bannon makes a statement in that sermon what is the holy ghost he says we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything in acknowledgment that we who are filled with the holy ghost do not immediately we're not immediately translated into a millennium but we exist within a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps and god recognizes them to be trapped and the holy spirit wants to train us to recognize the traps because it's not something oh you're a born-again christian you should have known better well maybe technically in one sense but it's not that it's always obvious it's traps it's full of darkness it's full of everything and then he kind of gets into maybe the heart of a person who's fearful and worried he says you say oh i'm afraid to take the christian life i'm afraid to do this i'm afraid i'll do this and so they're afraid to make this commitment because what if i don't live up to the standard or if i do this then this happens and that happens he says don't be afraid he's not even it's not even saying you won't do it he's saying don't be afraid if you do or you don't don't be afraid we have an advocate john is even saying if you if we sin my little children these things i write into you that you sin not and if we sin if we make a mistake we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous he says we have an advocate oh he stands by us he's in us and makes intercessions for us the holy spirit constantly costing constantly making an advocate for us all the time so let's not be afraid don't be afraid of this world which is full of unbelief full of enemies full of sin full of traps we we shouldn't be afraid to live this christian life because you can you can live this christian life you're me you've been made more than a conqueror you are a conqueror you are more than a conqueror you're an overcomer you are the a daughter of god you are a son of god therefore he looks out after you he's going to encourage you he's going to lead you he's going to guide you there should not be fear failure that means if you fail you're not afraid of it sometimes it will fear i have no fear of failure it's not this arrogance that i won't ever make a mistake i will not let my mistakes testify to me that i'm not his child i recognize lord show me what i did wrong to make the mistakes if i fail this is an opportunity to learn if i fail this is an opportunity for me to repent to really show the zeal to really show my enthusiasm that when i've made a mistake i'm willing to repent and to confess and john teaches us that when we make a mistake if we confess he's just and faithful to forgive us so he says don't be afraid we have an advocate and he says he makes intercessions for us and i really feel that this role of an intercessor is very deep and very in very uh i like to say profound and and i'd like to expound upon it and i've and i'm only going to go so far today and actually just cut my sermon in half and and just realizing i didn't want to go too far and get too lengthy so i try to find just a spot where we could stop and i want to pick up more on these these things next sunday lord willing but let me begin just to take a step further by making a comment again about what we've ministered before the advocate and advocacy is not within the context of an uh where there's it's not in conjunction with an adversary so oftentimes we think of an advocate and i come across this quite a bit when people ask me what kind of law that i do are you a criminal lawyer you're a prosecution or your defense and so they think and though the legal profession is adversarial regardless of what area you're in it's mostly adversarial um there's i mean i'm neither a criminal defense lawyer nor am i a a prosecutor so i'm neither one you're like oh well then you're not really a lawyer well that's what most people think lawyers do is they either represent the guilt or they want to prosecute the guilty there's no innocence no innocent people in the criminal justice system but it's uh and so when we think advocate we think of this legal role or one who's my defense attorney he's there for my defense and an advocate is not adversarial and though we may see that he makes intercessions for us we have an advocate with the father they're together with him he's not in the role of constantly convincing god to forgive our sins that's why i want you to think of this a little bit differently he's not standing there going oh yeah by the way aaron did it again yeah if you could just forgive him for that i know this is getting old but please forgive him that's not the role of the advocate the advocate isn't there constantly trying to cover for you and constantly trying to make a uh you know convince god to forgive you and let you go this time and oh don't hurt him he didn't mean it that's not the role of an advocate and and john even expounds this or wants us to understand from which place this role is birthed and where it comes from by saying that we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he says in verse 2 and he is the perpetuation for our sins this is an important connection our advocate is identified with jesus christ the righteous and our advocate is one with the atonement so he says and he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the world he is saying that jesus christ our advocate he is the atoning sacrifice he is the sacrifice that atoned for our sins and not just the sins of the jews but for the sins of the gentiles and so when he says he is our propitiation christ himself became the sacrifice and that word of perpetuation means he's the appeasement that if there was a requirement he satisfies it satisfied it if there was anger or wrath that you were subject to he appeased it he has settled the matter he is the perpetuation for our sins and so it's very important for us to catch the connection between the advocacy of christ and his role as the atonement so that we're not thinking that we're not always thinking that his role of advocate is always him atoning for something no he was the perpetuation and i'm going to just drive this home for the remainder of this morning he's the perpetuation once for our sins but forever our advocate the perpetuation is for our sins once and for all and so in the bible where this word the perpetuation is used i want to mention the different places it's used in romans chapter 3 verses 23 to 26 he says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god all have done so so when john said in first john chapter 1 if any man says he has not sinned he's a liar why because all men have sinned and is and needs to be born again but then the born again this is the paradox once you're born again you cannot sin because the seed remaineth in you lord you cannot you cannot be subject to permanent judgment anymore so he says for all of sin and come short of the glory of god being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus and now speaking of christ jesus and those justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom jesus christ whom god hath set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of god to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just so is jesus christ the righteous he is just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus and so god himself is just jesus christ himself is justified god is just in justifying you when you believe in jesus christ well how how in the world how in the world can it be that my faith in jesus christ justifies me before god because he set jesus christ forth to be the perpetuation so he has been set forth he has been made a sacrifice that through his blood he can declare you righteous because your sins are forgiven they have been remitted for the remission or forgiveness of sins so through jesus christ there is an appeasing or an atoning or placating is the word could be used in the greek he has placated god's wrath god the law it demands justice and god requires death for sin and where there's sin there must be death and because all were born in sin and all have sinned and come short of the glory of god god's wrath was upon us but then he sets jesus christ forth to appease god's wrath so it removes god's wrath that sacrifice becomes the atonement the word perpetuation that's used in john and also used in romans here is translated in a couple places as mercy seat he set him forth to be the mercy seat and the mercy seat was the cover of the ark of the covenant the lid of the ark of the covenant in the holy of holies and the the image that's being brought up into this new testament how he sent him forth to be the mercy seat he sent him forth to be the perpetuation the mercy seat was sprinkled with the blood of the sacrifice on the day of atonement so on one day and one day a year on the day of atonement the high priest would take the blood of this sacrifice and go into the holy of holies and he would take the blood of the sacrifice or the atonement and he would sprinkle it upon the lid or the cover of the ark of the covenant and in doing so it symbolized something that the sacrifice the life that was lost by the sacrifice that's represented by this blood this unblemished sacrifice this this lamb was the atoner this thing that was offered this beast that was offered was the atonement the sacrifice recognized the life that the people deserve to lose because of their sins so the people deserve to lose their life because of their sins and so instead of them dying they went through this ceremony every year where they took the sacrifice they shed its blood the high priest went in behind the veil into the holy of holies took this blood sprinkled the blood upon the mercy seat and it was this ceremony in doing so that represented that i should have died but the innocent has died in my place and then it would in the in the hearts of the people they would believe their sins for that time had been atoned for and so the the belief in the old testament the teaching in the old testament is by this offering god's judgment was appeased and their sins were atoned for and but they had to come back a year later and do it again now what the bible teaches us and this is what we'll highlight now for a little bit is that for the elect christ did this so in the old testament the mercy seat was a literal seat with behind a covering of the ark of the covenant behind the behind the veil and the holy of holies and the priest would go and he would shed the blood of a sacrifice take the blood go in behind the veil into the holy voice sprinkle blood upon the the the cover the lid of the ark of the covenant that would be called the mercy seat and that would stand for the perpetuation this is in our place this is where we ought to have been judged and we ought to have lost our lives and they would literally do that year after year after year but christ does it one time and that's one part of the symbolism and what i've been um studying on the way the lord has kind of been inspiring me is to look at this is looking at this mercy seat looking at propitiation and how it relates to the bride's advocacy and how it even relates to our advocate how we can have access to such a powerful advocate but when jesus christ is on the cross what is what what transpires this great shaking in this earthquake that takes place it rents the veil of the temple and what does it expose there's no blood on the ark of the covenant that's not the mercy seat the mercy seat had changed it had been as one time it was on wheels and it was in motion once again it was now in motion because now the mercy seat is hanging upon the cross and all the elements that were there in the original mercy seat behind that veil all those same elements now exist upon the cross with the deity and the blood and it's lifted up before the people and now you had to look to that sacrifice for your atonement because there was no more blood in there for in their sacrifice there was no more blood upon that altar and so christ represents this for us in first john chapter 4 verse 10 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and in loving us sent his son to be the perpetuation for our sins remember how we identified very early on last sunday he says if you love me you keep my commandments and now that if you really ponder what he's saying if you love him you want to keep his commandments this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous that we love him we want to keep his commandments could you say amen to them and he realizes that no matter how much you love him absent a helper you could never do it so it's his way of giving us the peace that we so long for it's his way of assuring us of our acceptance by when we received him by faith he accepted us upon our confession and so he gives us the baptism of our ghost as the seal of our faith as this assurance that we've been received and and we've received uh we've been not only received by him but we're forgiven and then he gives us some a power on the inside to do the things that we would want to do as a christian and so it's not hearing is his love made known not that we loved him and forced his hand but he loved us and he sent a perpetuation he sent an atonement the very word that's used here this perpetuation or mercy seed it's coming from uh to from the root to favor or grace or kindness it is the kindness of god it is the grace and favor of god that is being expressed to us he is a perpetuation he is the perpetuation for our sins this is what john says jesus christ the righteous is not only our atonement but he is our advocate with god now that that that's where even you can begin to understand that when john saw he turned and he was told he was going to see a lion and he turned and he saw a lamb it fits perfectly with his understanding of how her advocate who would you want your advocate to be you'd want to be the lion that's who you'd want your advocate to be but he was also your lamb your atonement jesus christ the righteous he is our perpetuation so the the foundation now of this advocacy is upon this atonement and so and and i want to i just want to remain in that thought on establishing the atonement because once you identify the role of the atonement it makes the role of the advocate permanent he's not advocating for you and then oh wait hold on wait a minute there's another issue we have to deal with there's something else that needs to be done once you identify the fact that he has played he has done the part of your atoner he has atoned for your sins it makes his role of advocate as secure it's permanent it's not something you should always be fearful of and worry some of and and i speak to this because our our life's experiences have put us in this frame of mind many times that we're somehow going to lose the favor of god that he's going to be done with he's going to cast us aside and we're going to develop this huge complex that at any moment god's going to treat us like the people who loved us after the flesh treated us and that has got to be completely done away with we can no longer live under this shadow that god somehow is going to turn around and be angry at us again there's this revelation that even luther himself had and he expressed it so beautifully if my sins are forgiven then smite me he said if truly my sins are forgiven then smite me lord smite me smite me i believe he says it multiple times because he was expressed in the reality that if sins are forgiven then there really is no wrath of god upon me whatever he allows to take place in this life achieves what his vision is and his goal is not he for only for me but for his kingdom so if you've forgiven me of all my sins then my position and your kingdom is secure then use me however you want use me lord however you want because by the atonement your role in my life as advocate is eternal and so i want to continue to examine the atonement the this atonement is being part of what this advocate has done to keep the proper balance though we've alluded to it i'm just going to substantiate it through a number of scriptures but i'd like to just maybe do it through a portion of scripture we read last time hebrews chapter 10 and we start with verse 14 i'm going to read to verse 22 but i'm going to interject back and forth through different places as we read through this so if you you've taken notes you can write down hebrews chapter 10 verses 14 to 22. i'm going to read verse 14 then kind of skip around i go to a couple other places in the same chapter but he says for by one offering he have perfected forever them that are sanctified one offering this isn't multiple offerings this is one offering not offered continually and not offered over and over it's by one offering he have perfected forever them that are sanctified he was offered one time for all this is what is being set forth here in the book of hebrews he says in verse 12 of the same chapter but this man after he had effort offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of god so by this sacrifice the sanctified are eternally perfect not by multiple sacrifices not by multiple offerings of the same one by one offering the the sanctified are forever perfect by this man he has offered he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever and verse 10 of hebrews 10 by the which we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all so notice this repetitive theme just within these first few verses but we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever so by one offering have perfected forever them that are sanctified so the atonement your atonement for all your sins past present and future the atonement was secured through one offering in the old testament it was something that was done on the day of atonement it was something that was done over and over and over again but now there has been one offering offered through jesus christ and in that offering it is permanent it is certain it's not temporal the rain can't wash it away time can't diminish it your decades in sin do not diminish the power of it it is it is ever powerful and so he's saying this one offering perfects forever them that are sanctified and he says it's offered once offered once for all so for by one offering have perfected forever them that are sanctified verse 15 whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before now this is almost this is almost in the same parallel the same line that john says my little children if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is a perpetuation for our sins john is saying he's our advocate he's our advocate because he was our perpetuation now in hebrews notice he's saying he's a perpetuation he was once offered for all of us he was once offered for all of us therefore and because he was offered once for all the holy ghost also is a witness to us if i could say this in one sense and and on one hand maybe it sounds a little odd to say it but then the more you think about it maybe it seems more obvious but he could die for our sins and he could do it in such a way to where it's paid for but what full benefit would we receive if we ever knew it never knew about it like if we just kind of took the attitude hey listen guys he died for the elect the elect are fine let's just all go go enjoy life i think why do we need to show up here twice a week we could be doing so many other things even better things in our community and all the money we we give to the support of the kingdom of god and everything we that we could use this differently why they're relaxed they're covered by the blood anyways and if we just kind of had that attitude i mean maybe technically in some way we could convince ourselves that okay yeah truly surely if the blood was shed then it covers them but that was that's not god's program he said well that's not enough i didn't that's not what i did this for this isn't why i died that is somehow behind closed doors it was secret it's been atoned for and you can just go live your life however you want he says because of that the holy ghost is a witness to us now this is for us who've received it and maybe he's pulling back the curtain a little bit on what's been burning my heart in terms of the bride's advocacy but he says the holy ghost is a witness to us the advocate then will testify to us he has been offered once for all sin he has offered one sacrifice for sins forever by one offering he's perfected forever them that are sanctified and because of that the holy ghost is a witness to us for after that he had said before the advocate will testify to us cause us to remember to never forget well what is it what is it it's right here in verses 16 and 17. this is what the holy ghost testifies to this is what the advocate raises before us this is the covenant that's a very important word to recognize there this is the covenant that i'll make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts not upon the tables of stone it's not written upon their their doorposts and put on these eyelets and these things i will put my law under their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more he's quoting from jeremiah 31 verses 33 and 34 he's actually quoting this old testament prophecy this is the covenant that i will make with him this is a new covenant this is a different testament this is a different promise i will not just write laws that they that these external things that i'll have to observe but i'll put my very word into their hearts and in their hearts will i write them and thou give them this grace so that they can be liberated to follow the leadership of that law that is written within their hearts their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more against them so they're not always looking over their shoulder they're not always worried about some comeuppance or getting some karma but they'll be liberated and they will be free he's already established in hebrews chapter 8 verses 10 and 12. if you had time to look at that i'm just going to skip over in hebrews chapter 8 verses 10 to 12. he's already quoted this exact phrase here in jeremiah 31 and he repeats it again this is the covenant i'll write it in their hearts and their sins and iniquities while i remember no more this is what the holy ghost wants to testify of the holy ghost also is a witness to us your sins and your iniquities will i remember no more the word is written in your heart the word is there on the inside this is your advocate in second corinthians chapter 3 verse 3 for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart the spirit the indwelling spirit is set forth as the spirit of the living god riding upon the fleshly tables of your heart you're not just the the epistle in the the heart of paul but the the epistle the word of god is engraved within your heart it says your sins and iniquities will i remember no more no more against you i will put my laws into your hearts and in their minds will i write them it's the spirit of god imprinted in your soul and and the advocates there to remind you of that advocate's there to to to encourage you in that to support you in that this is the covenant that i will make i will not just atone for a sacrifice externally but in this the perpetuation the life of that sacrifice can return back upon the believer to then be a law within their hearts i'll write this word within their heart and witness and testify to them that their sins have been atoned for continuing verse 18 hebrews 10 verse 18 we've read verses 15 16-17 now verse 18. now where remission of these is because remember the perpetuation is set forth to be the remission of sins where the remission of these is there is no more offering for sin now think about that where when sins have been remitted there's no more offering if your sins have been forgiven you don't need another offering for your sins so where sins have been from remitted there is no more offering for sin when sin is forgiven there is no need where it says there is no more often for sin some of the translations say there is no requirement there is no need for another sin offering there is no need for a further atonement that is another sacrifice is not required so as much as we would love to die for the sins of our children or we would love to give our lives uh to atone for someone else's sins it's not required and it wouldn't work because there was one offering for sin and then it says that when sins have been remitted there is no need for another offering so when your sins have been forgiven when you've been identified with that sacrifice then there is no need for another offering when you have been identified with your sacrifice then your sins are forgiven they are remembered no more against you they are gone and having been atoned for jesus christ does not need to walk into the presence of god and go i guess i need to die again and i know sometimes it's used as poetry that whenever we sin it it it it hurts the christ there before the father and whenever we sin there's another affliction in him and he winces in pain and every time we sin he experiences another nail within his flesh and really that's maybe just poetry to make us guilt feel guilty for our sins but there's no reality to that right it's not that he's always up there having to atone for our sins and atone for our sins and i hope that you're staying very very close to what i'm trying to say today because i'm being very faithful to the word of god i want you to recognize that your advocate is connected with the atonement he is a tone for your sins his advocacy isn't constantly apologizing for you constantly trying to cover you up constantly trying to make excuses for you sin is atoned for by for those who have the advocate you've been released from the burden of sin for where remission of sins are there is no more offering of sins his his finished work is by him being the sacrifice by him being set forth to be the perpetuation it has ratified it is confirmed it has validated the new covenant this is the covenant and by the sacrifice of jesus christ he inaugurates the new covenant therefore sin is atoned for and no further offering is needed and the scripture is basically saying whether that where even in light of the old testament sacrifices are no longer needed there does not need to be the continual offense of sacrifices when sins have been annulled this is out this is where we see the transition now that by the offering of jesus christ the high priest doesn't need to go in every year and offer offer a ram he doesn't need to offer a bullock he doesn't need to offer a lamb he doesn't need to offer a bull it's been a tongue for by one offering sins have been atoned for in hebrews chapter 9 verses 25 to 26 nor yet that he should offer himself often really the in hebrews the um i i i i i don't know if i'm apologizing now or starting to regret the way i've laid this out but it's really beautiful if you just kind of follow the language and i've kind of moved it around so it seemed to be a little have more continuity with the thought that i'm trying to express here on this one offering forever the atonement's been offered forever and how the advocacy of jesus christ is built upon this fact that he is that we have been accepted through this atonement but paul has taken the template of the old testament and the old priesthood he's been saying oh well they had these priests that were made priests after the law but we have a high priest jesus christ who's after the order of melchizedek not the order of aaron and he's saying we have a high priest we have the sacrifices we have a tabernacle we have a covenant and he compares it to their priesthood their tabernacle their sacrifices their covenant and he's saying this is so much better they had theirs we've got one that's so much better we have a better high priest we have a better promise we have a better sacrifice we have a better tabernacle and and he's laying showing this parallel and expressing these things so in referring to jesus christ who is made a high priest forever after the order melchizedek nor yet that he should offer himself often so we see that the high priest would go in every year and offer sacrifices jesus christ now is a high priest but he doesn't need to constantly go in and offer himself as the high priest entering the holy place every year with the blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself he only had to do it one time he appeared as the sacrifice once whereas high priest every year had to go behind the holy place with the blood of others he'd take the blood of this sacrifice and sprinkle it upon the lid upon the mercy seat to be a perpetuation and they had to do this every year jesus christ is not a high priest who is also the sacrifice he's the sacrifice he's the high priest and paul's saying this doesn't mean he has to go in every year and sacrifice himself but he appeared once he said in our time to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself he did it once that's the perpetuation and we have an advocate with the father well who is this advocate jesus christ the righteous the righteous sacrifice the atoner the atonement the perpetuation for your sins and that gives me confidence in that lion gives me confidence that he's that it's he's for me he says it's once now back to verse 19. so we've been reading hebrews chapter 10 verses 16 17 18 now verse 19 to 22 having therefore brethren and let's let's uh pause for a moment just recap it by one offering he's perfected forever them that are sanctified upon that basis we have an advocate now the advocate the holy ghost is a witness an inside witness saying you have the word the word is nine the word is in your heart the word is he's deposited himself in you you have deity when you speak it's deity speaking there's this encouragement nourishment to the soul there's this nourishing of our spirit to strengthen you in the inner man and part of his witnesses and your sins and iniquities he remembers no more against you justified freely by his grace so he's established that he's this witness and then now he's saying this this witness of the holy ghost there's not this repetition of the offering of sacrifices because he's been offered once one time for all that should settle it and so now he says this is what it ought to produce for us this is what it does having therefore brethren boldness in light of this having therefore brethren boldness to enter now this is this gets really rich and and i'm not even going to get into it i'm just gonna just savor it for a moment having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus what they had a high priest who had to go in he had to wash himself he had to dress a certain way they put bells on his skirt right just in case they didn't hear him wiggling around in there they'd drag him out they had to tie some to his ankles so nobody else went in there this was a very serious thing you just didn't go behind nobody could not just anybody could go in there a high priest who went through a very meticulous detailed preparation had to go behind there and hope that he was accepted and sprinkled the blood and then everyone no he made it he atoned for us everything's been atoned for and then paul all of a sudden just makes this dramatic shift to where we have one offer and he's been offered forever for us and and how that he doesn't have to go in every year and do it but he did it once for all and now all of a sudden everything changes he says now with this witness of the holy ghost we can have boldness ourselves to do what enter the holiest by the blood of jesus we have or we can enter into there why because he's the door of everything that god has for us how is it that we could enter into the holiest the holy of holies this this secret place by a new and living way this is the new covenant by a living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh his flesh forever consecrated a new and living way and having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near we have a high priest let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith this could be where a lot of us find ourselves many times god's just wanting to establish this true heart in the full assurance of faith this is why the holy ghost is a witness of this covenant that i'll put my law on your hearts and in your minds and your sins and iniquities while i remember no more so that we can have a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water now now you have the very image of what the high priest went through and now it's being attributed to us not just jesus christ maybe we could all just accept well jesus christ did that he was the sacrifice but now we're the ones that because of this atonement have this access and the true heart and full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkle from an evil conscience in our bodies washed with pure water we have the boldness to enter into the holiest through our atonement the blood of the atonement has cleansed us the blood of the atonement has washed us revelations 1 5 by his own blood he's washed us by his own blood he's cleansed us and made us what kings and priests so now we have been ceremonially placed in this position of ourselves being kings and ourselves being priests to offer up sacrifices i think it's said many times even in the in the by the the jews and their talmud and in their law that their sacrifices will continue to be offered until the final sacrifice and from then on only the sacrifice of praise is given we've had one sacrifice given and now we offer up to him our bodies as a living sacrifice now that we're washed through the blood of jesus christ we have this access to god this is this is he's made a way he says it's a new and living way we have an advocate with the father so it's connected with the atonement this opens up things to us we realize now that our advocate is not just having to busy himself with trying to all of our mistakes and our doubts and our fears he can busy himself with encouraging us in them he can busy himself with lifting us up above them and teaching us and leading us and guiding us through this world of traps and darkness full of enemies and sin through the atonement we have access to god paul in first corinthians chapter 6 verse 11 when he's talking about you know whoremongers and adulterers and everything he says and such were some of you and some of us said amen he said such were some of you he says but you're washed but you're sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god if if you could just walk out of here with one assurance today if you are a born-again son or daughter of god let it just ring within your heart you are washed you are sanctified you are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god don't let any lie any rumor any myth truth any false doctrine put you in this state of purgatory it's nonsense that takes the word of god and establishes a quote unquote message purgatory for the bride there is none you are washed you are forgiven you are justified freely by his grace let us not try to carve out some place where the bride is always just there unsure well what's going to happen maybe i could be fullest virgin just get it out of your head right now if there's any foolishness in you this word will drive it away i commit myself as a man of god we establish this church with the purpose that it'll drive away foolishness through the word of god then it'll wash you cleanse you purify you strengthen you and encourage you none of you will be dangled over hell you'll be encouraged and nourished by the holy ghost you're washed you're sanctified you're justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god and this is the truth the advocate wants to remind you of the advocate doesn't play mind games with you the advocate's not trying to trick you and using reverse psychology i mean to this day i'll never forget my grandma got me one time and we were we were digging up sand crabs in san diego just by the buckets full we were wanting to keep them for some reason i don't know what we're gonna do with them i don't know if we're gonna have a sand crab boil later or but uh my grandma said boys throw these throw these sand crabs back in the ocean and you know my two younger brothers are the ones you hear all the stories about uh they they refuse they know we're going to keep all these crabs we want to keep these crabs so my grandma turns in and says aaron always listens to what i have to say he'll throw him back and i'm like what am i supposed to say no i don't grandma i don't listen to anything you say by the way in went the sand crabs but that's not god doesn't have to use reverse psychology with this he just encourages us you can do it and if he ever tells you you can't don't try to do it it's the beauty of it he's like no don't do that you know oh no i can do it i can do all things through christ no sorry that's not it it's not what we meant by that don't do that trust me that's what he's there for he's not trying to trap you he's not trying to trick you this is the advocate reminds us of this truth to keep the access clear remember it's not adversarial he's there as an advocate to remind you he that god is for you brother graham said i used to think jesus loved me and god hated me but he's like wait jesus was god's way to have me like this was he was my he he used jesus not because he was mad at me and jesus loved me and said no god please don't he god had a way to bring you to himself to bring you into fellowship and so the advocate reminds us of these truths this new and living way forever consecrated for us and they want to lead us to a greater understanding of truth so catch that our advocate joins us to our atonement therefore we stand justified forever justified forever there's where you know sometimes maybe when there's been an offense i want you to listen really good now because this is this will get real personal there's times when we've been offended and we don't fully forgive because we want to use the offense to our advantage later right i'm just gonna hold on to a little bit of my fence i forgive you but i'm still gonna use this later so you can bring it up whenever it's to your advantage will you remember when you did this i thought you forgave me for it yeah well but it's this is different now you you did this and you did that and you didn't read all the clauses and did you read the agreement i provided you at the time that i agreed to forgive you no i i didn't know i needed to read the fine print well you should have read the fine print that's not what god's gonna do that's not how god treats us we stand justified forever he doesn't hold back some offense to use so he can get the upper hand with us and through our advocate he he strives with us to maintain uninterrupted access to grace uninterrupted access to god's favor as we read all those things that the advocate is he's there so that we can access help leadership direction comfort not from the position of weakness there was a song i heard many many years ago and actually really liked it i thought it kind of had like a maybe it was it may have been more the music than the uh or the melody more than the words but the words kind of struck this chord that we're the beggars right we're the beggars at the feet of the cross and at first it's kind of yes yes we're just beggars and i realized that's just where that's just where the devil wants to keep us as long as you can just be a beggar at the cross and just never get to the throne you'll be happy with that and so we're not just these beggars at the foot of the cross by the cross we are raised seated with him in heavenly places in christ we have we have through our repentance and through our confession and recognize ourselves to be weak and recognizing ourselves to be sinful through the confession of sin and by identifying ourselves with the sacrifice we are now we are not in a position of weakness anymore but the atonement has put us into fellowship with god now i would join heirs with christ if he's the one hanging on the cross he did it not that we would just be beggars at the cross but that we would be joint heirs with them seated together with him in heavenly places that's that's the image that this the the advocate wants to bring us up to in romans chapter eight i the the uh what i'd like to touch on next time lord willing on sunday is this role of this perpetuation this intercessor he's a mediator he's gonna talk he's a surety he's a mediator job one time cried out and said who's going to act as the days been the bondsman between us here i am a sinful man and here's a righteous god who is it that's going to bring these two parties together into fellowship jesus christ the righteous did that for you he's brought you into fellowship so now look at romans chapter 8 verses 14 to 16. remember the comforter is the holy ghost it is the spirit of god it is your advocate he is your advocate for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god as children of god he gives us his spirit to lead us that's what makes us as children that's one of the most important things you have as a son or daughter of god you should guide you should guard that and protect it with everything the individual leadership of the holy spirit within a person's life is so precious then he says for you have not received the spirit of god bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god this is what the advocate does it testifies to you it witnesses to you they that are the children of god are led by the spirit of god therefore we have not received a spirit of bondage to cause us to fear a spirit of legalism a spirit to drive us to do things to force us to do things but yet we have an advocate even on the inside of us with the father the spirit witnessing to our spirit and encouraging us and telling us that we are his children that's what the spirit of god inside of you is to do is to tell you you are mine you are mine you are my son you are my daughter and you'll find as we've tried to substantiate this in the last service and in this service just and we could do so with even more and more statements especially as it relates to the holy ghost this advocacy is the blessing that god bestows upon his family alone those that are led by the spirit of god are the children of god in other words only the children of god have this inside teacher to lead them we could establish a program to where we're all just told what to do all the time right what should i do what should i do we get our marching orders we're told what to do and in that way a church would operate like a family would the parents are the holy ghost to the children until what the children get the holy ghost and so that's the goal that's our goal as in ministry that's our goal and family that's our goal as a church is not that we would always just be very clear on what we're supposed to do and what we're not supposed to do but so that everyone has a relationship established with jesus christ where their soul and god locks together and they become one and you begin to see families led of the holy spirit led of god and the word working mightily in their hearts and working within their lives and then we recognize we come together as a church family to encourage one another in those things because really what i was thinking of and i thought man i just would like to preach the whole sermon from this standpoint the advocate's the difference maker and really that you just have to say it realize i don't have to have part 12 on that you know this is just he's the difference maker that that's it he makes the difference what makes the difference between the old you and the new you the advocate the holy ghost the comforter that's what makes that's what makes you different what what what's the what what makes that you different than those that are stumbling in darkness not you your advocate we can't brag oh i'm just smarter and oh you know what i when i heard this message you know i really picked up on it you know and i really i was able to pick i just poured myself into it and i've always done this and i've always done that let's just all accept the fact that we are who we are today in christ because of the atonement and our advocate if there had not been an atonement our advocate would have left us a long time ago but we have a permanent atonement and our sins haven't been atoned for and us being identified with this sacrifice we become new creatures in christ jesus and by the indwelling of the holy ghost i've had an advocate and he's the one that's kept me he's been the difference maker the great difference maker let me say it's not too late for him to make a difference it's not too late there's he's still working within us to make us what we ought to be and then one thing i thought well let me just read ephesians chapter two well let me see if i wanna let me just skip ephesians chapter 2 but ephesians chapter 2 verses 13 to 18 paul is saying that jews and gentiles at one time were just separated became by the sacrifice of jesus christ he's abolished any enmity to where now we're one and he's saying that he's reconciled both he's reconciled different backgrounds different ethnicities different beliefs he's reconciled us together in christ into one body for through him we both have access by one spirit under the father and i thought the advocate is not only the difference maker it's the great equalizer we're all the same there's none among us that should start kind of positioning ourselves as wiser than somebody else because if they've got an advocate they have access to all the wisdom in the world and it doesn't matter how much experience you have or how much how long you've been at it how long you've been preaching i could get up here and say well i've been preaching this message for so many years you've only been serving god a couple of years well the advocate's a great equalizer because he could come and tell you what you need to know now for the time you're in having only served the god a year and i'm still earning it why because the spirit of god that advocates the equalizer that brings us all one in jesus christ and nobody's looking up to anybody else and no one's looking down upon anybody because we have an advocate with the father that raises us up equal in christ he's a difference maker he's the harmonizer you'll say well equalizer you're going to bring me down let's just say harmonizer brings all of our differences and all of our gifts and all of our different experiences and the advocates harmonize us together let us strive for the harmony that ought to be seen within the body of christ in closing it's our advocate that supports us he's a teacher he's a leader brother branham says don't be afraid we have an advocate he silences our fears he helps us in our discouragements in mark chapter 13 verse 11. it was expressed elsewhere with a few more verses i just pulled this one out in just this one verse he says but when they shall lead you and deliver you up it's in the same image that jesus begins to speak to the disciples in john chapter 14 15 16 about you're going to be scattered and you're going to be sent forth this sheep into the midst of wolves and i'm going to leave you and when i leave you the world's going to hate you because they hated me and he begins to paint this really really dark picture of what's to come it's within that context he says but i'm going to give you an inside teacher i'm going to give you an inner witness i'm going to give you an inner strength stephen don't worry you're going gonna have a strength on the inside an advocate there who's gonna be holding you up when they stone you peter don't worry right now you you may be denying me but don't worry i've prayed for you because one day you're gonna be able to stand up and say don't crucify me the way they did my lord hang me upside down because i'm not worthy to die the death that he died and you have these apostles and these disciples willing to become martyrs how did they do it by this inside advocate who bore them up and strengthen them and so jesus in the spirit of the same testimony says but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what you shall speak neither do you premeditate i had a preacher one time tell me that this is the the uh well they took issue with the fact that i studied all the time and uh maybe because they never studied but um and they told me why don't you just use mark 13 11. take no thought i'm like well if i was being delivered before my enemy you know thanks for the heads up on how your congregation views me i won't pre-meditate at all i thought i was going to church i guess i'm going to the council but this isn't for when we the work of ministry or studying or what the preacher should do this is the way all of us this is a promise all of us have when we're put in a situation that maybe we're not prepared for gonna be called on the carpet we're gonna be criticized someone's gonna challenge us someone's gonna try to hold our feet to the fire someone's going to try to really get us and work us over pin our ears back take no thought beforehand what you shall speak neither do you need to premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye he says for it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost the comforter will speak for you the inside teacher your advocate will give you words to speak in the time that you need to say don't go through this life well i don't know if i'm smart enough i don't know if i have the wisdom what if they challenge me what if this happens and what if that comes up you rest in the fact that you have an advocate on the inside he'll tell you what to say oh to think that there's times when the lion needs to speak on your behalf and he'll do it through you and there's times when the lamb will speak and you'll speak and it'll be the atonement speaking what you shall speak the holy ghost will tell you that's the advocate because when times get tough and the pressure comes on he's there for you we're all familiar with romans 8 28 all things work together for the good notice the preceding verses we'll close with this the musicians would like to come romans chapter 8 verses 26 and 27 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities this is the role of your advocate he helps you in your infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought we don't know how exactly to petition god because of our need we don't know we're not sure what to ask for anybody ever been there before i know what my need is but i'm just not sure what's going to meet it i don't know how to pray i don't know how to ask notice the beautiful role of the advocate but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered where is this spirit the one that's in you that helps with your infirmities and as you pray the spirit will make intercession on your behalf and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercessions for the saints according to the will of god paul is identifying the advocate which is acting within us not take a number wait in line and hope to have an audience really a lot of the things that we we could see here in hebrews and romans in these different places is really tearing down the entire catholic system of the approach to god completely tearing it down and it was done ahead of time it was established before that fact and it was put in place that this whole idea of even how that mass is is called the the sacrificial mess they're offering up christ again to be sacrificed over and over and over again [Music] but the bible is telling us that the spirit within us this advocate acting within us it's not pleading with god but notice what it's doing is directing your request it's not the holy spirit sees you over here tormented and not knowing what to do and the advocate kind of goes over here and talks to god and says look i know they've made a lot of mistakes you know they keep running up against this brick wall i know they're not clearly trusting you as they should but please don't don't let them have what's coming to them you know if you could just get them out of this mess one more time that's not how it works but when we'll humble ourselves remember how you grieve your advocate all you gotta do is say i'm sorry he's right back what showing you how to make things right as you begin to pray oh god i'm in a horrible situation i don't know what to do in the holy spirit this is what the scripture is describing the spirit helps us with our infirmities the spirit making intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered because it knows what is the mind of the spirit because it intercedes for the saints according to the will of god the spirit searches our hearts it renews our minds and now notice this the spirit itself advocates for the right cause it knows how to speak it'll tell you what to speak when you need to say it it knows how to it knows what to pray for it'll cause you to pray the right way can you begin to see where the bride's advocacy comes from this the spirit knows how to motivate you for the right cause and in a time and day when there's so many causes and so many voices and so much polarization more than ever we need an advocate that can tell us the right things to advocate for let's stand today [Music] i know i titled this the bride's advocate but as i studied last week it just kept coming to me over and over again our advocate our advocate our advocate personally identify with these things he's your advocate we could just bow our heads in a word of prayer [Music] gracious heavenly father as we stand in your presence today we're desirous of a greater awareness of this advocate [Music] this helper [Music] the supporter lord is it's said that you are our champion in that you've conquered forests and you've won the victory [Music] but the bible teaches us that you give us the victory [Music] so you champion us you courage us you support us lord as we labor to preach a positive gospel to your people may they receive it with contriteness of heart may there be no leaven mixed in with it may there be no presumptions or assumptions on their part may there be no arrogance lord may there be no hardiness but may any now who need to repent may they do so may the lord ask forgiveness for mistakes and failures may they confess their faults before you knowing that you're just and faithful to forgive them and lord may we never forget that your advocacy is based upon atonement and they had christ not been offered once for all sins there is no advocacy [Music] that your role as advocate and champion and encourager and supporters prefaced on this offering once for all [Music] lord i pray that we could walk within the promises of these scriptures whether it be mark 13 whether it be romans chapter 8 hebrews chapter may these things become more real to us more alive to us and we thank you for your advocacy in our lives thank you for your support and your encouragement lord when we've wallowed around in self-pity when we've embraced too often victimhood or wanted to look at as weak and poor and sad and we've kind of patted ourselves on the back being beggars at your cross lord thank you for forgiving us for this victim mentality lord and we thank you for encouraging us today to stand up not as beggars but as son and daughters of god not as orphans and outcasts but as true born-again sons and daughters of god lord we believe that we have been received by you we believe that we are in your family and may we with the true heart full of the assurance of faith come into the holiest of holies in fellowship with you i pray bless us now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
