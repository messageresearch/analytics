[0:00] we're preaching again tonight on
[0:02] wonderlust and wonder lost this is part
[0:04] six this will be the last service Lord
[0:07] willing if he would will on this
[0:09] particular subject on wonder lust and
[0:11] wonder lust today's title is rest
[0:13] refocus
[0:16] and I'm using that just as uh even
[0:18] Commandments or encouragements rest
[0:20] refocus this is kind of what's been a
[0:22] driving theme in my heart as we've
[0:24] looked at the subject matter I'm sure
[0:26] you could see the tie-ins in terms of
[0:27] the things that drive us and get our
[0:29] attention and we struggle with that
[0:31] we're wanting just to rest and refocus
[0:33] and this is the conclusion this is the
[0:35] conclusion of wonderlust and wonder lost
[0:37] a series that I would say is about
[0:39] desire human desire but also The Wonder
[0:41] of Christ
[0:43] and tonight I just want to preach
[0:45] a capping message I just want to preach
[0:48] it without trying to go back and tie
[0:50] different things in I'm just trusting
[0:52] that there's been enough groundwork
[0:53] that's been laid enough material been
[0:55] put out there and so we wanted to kind
[0:57] of preach a message that can sum it up
[0:58] and leave it in a good spot and
[1:02] um but then also draw from all the other
[1:04] services that we've preached thus far
[1:05] and I trust in doing so you can be
[1:08] encouraged
[1:10] okay I was starting to wonder if maybe
[1:11] we misplaced the amens in the move and
[1:15] maybe they maybe they swept those up and
[1:16] put them in the dumpster so uh just
[1:19] relax and I'll feed on the eight men's
[1:22] I'll take it as some currency
[1:24] um tonight and in the beginning even
[1:26] when we started this the inspiration was
[1:28] even asking the question that
[1:30] can we restore our sense of wonder when
[1:32] it comes to the things of God and there
[1:34] might be a part of us that feels that
[1:36] we're maturing we're no longer oohing
[1:38] and owing after childish things and we
[1:40] know that bodily exercise doesn't profit
[1:43] very much and so we don't look to
[1:44] certain things in the physical and we
[1:47] kind of look at a maturing faith in a
[1:48] way and say well my faith is mature and
[1:50] I'm not relying so much on these other
[1:52] things and I know this and I've heard
[1:54] that and everything seems to get settled
[1:56] but it might be good to ask ourselves is
[1:58] this Faith or am I getting numb
[2:00] have I lost my sense of wonder for the
[2:02] things of God are there things about the
[2:04] word that used to enthuse me I used to
[2:06] get excited about and it's really not
[2:07] Faith that's operating now it's more
[2:09] just a sense of I'm not as excited about
[2:11] it as I was before and so we're looking
[2:13] at rekindling our love for Jesus Christ
[2:16] being excited about the things of God
[2:17] being excited about the message as
[2:20] fellowshipping today with my wife and
[2:22] talking about different situations and
[2:24] really what it's going to take to make a
[2:25] Rapture and to me in my heart regardless
[2:29] of what someone's situation is if they
[2:31] fall in love with the message and feed
[2:32] on it and if they're in a different
[2:34] Church situation wherever it might be if
[2:36] they fall in love with this message and
[2:38] feed on it God's going to give them what
[2:39] they need to make it in a Rapture going
[2:41] to give them what they need for their
[2:43] family and for their home and I just
[2:44] believe that and so that's the one thing
[2:47] you want the people to be excited about
[2:49] and energized by is the word of God
[2:51] and we
[2:53] we touched on this I think this has been
[2:55] a consistent theme of how is it that we
[2:56] can break out of this numbness of
[2:58] lukewarmness and this uh all the kind of
[3:01] the dullness that we get in our lives
[3:02] and we said that Breaking Free from
[3:04] lukewarmness begins with identifying all
[3:06] the numbing agents that are in our lives
[3:08] the things that are overloading our
[3:10] senses and overwhelming us with burdens
[3:12] and cares and anxieties and as that our
[3:14] heart weighs down even the psalmist said
[3:17] my heart is so drawn it Cleaves to the
[3:19] Earth I'm unable to look up I'm unable
[3:21] to be expected I'm unable to have hope
[3:23] and so we want to as the scripture says
[3:25] look up your Redemption drop night look
[3:27] up from the things that we're scrolling
[3:29] on look up from all the things that have
[3:31] our attention and that's the that's the
[3:33] quickest way to start restoring The
[3:34] Wonder of Christ is finding all the
[3:36] things that are kind of pushing our head
[3:38] into the Dust
[3:40] in Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 8 it
[3:42] says all things are full of Labor you'll
[3:44] recognize many of the scriptures we use
[3:45] tonight we're just wanting to preach
[3:47] them as a capping to this all things are
[3:49] full of Labor
[3:50] man cannot utter it the eye is not
[3:52] satisfied with sin nor the ear filled
[3:54] with hearing
[3:56] as we looked at that before we realized
[3:58] it's saying that all things are never at
[4:00] rest they're always changing things are
[4:03] one way one day they're different the
[4:04] next day all things are full of Labor
[4:06] they're constantly changing it means
[4:08] it's Restless turning over and it says
[4:10] the eye is not seen uh satisfied with
[4:13] sin or the ear filled with hearing it's
[4:16] this restlessness with the eye a
[4:18] wrestling restlessness with The Ear The
[4:20] Eye may see something but then it knows
[4:22] there's more to be seen so it wants to
[4:24] see it the ear may hear something but it
[4:25] knows there's more to hear something
[4:27] just changes just a little bit anymore I
[4:30] found that there's a in every song that
[4:32] comes out now there's an acoustic
[4:34] version there's a live version there's a
[4:35] sped up version there's a house remix
[4:37] right uh uh and and then there's an 80s
[4:41] techno one and every song I'm talking
[4:43] about Christian music I'm not talking
[4:44] about you know my uh some other playlist
[4:46] I've got going on I'm just saying every
[4:48] song you go to look it up and there's
[4:49] some remix with it why because even the
[4:52] ear is not satisfied with the radio
[4:53] version they want to hear a deep cut off
[4:55] the B side uh that has just a little bit
[4:57] different vibe with it and that's the
[4:59] way the ear works that's the way that
[5:01] the eye works it's never satisfied and
[5:03] the writer's saying this is all things
[5:05] are Topsy Turvy changing tumultuous and
[5:08] if he's writing this in whatever year he
[5:10] was riding it can I say it's just gotten
[5:12] worse
[5:13] that if one is observing as Solomon
[5:16] could everything that the world had to
[5:17] offer both good and bad what money could
[5:19] buy what luxuries and fineries would be
[5:21] available what entertainments and social
[5:24] things could have he had it even the
[5:26] wisdom that he thought would bring him
[5:27] happiness he's saying everything changes
[5:29] and if it was bad then it's only gotten
[5:31] worse as man continues to invent ways to
[5:34] try to satiate and be filled that's what
[5:37] the words are used there the eye is not
[5:39] satisfied sated it's not the ear is not
[5:42] fulfilled with hearing it's he's
[5:44] inventing many different ways to uh to
[5:47] find that satisfaction
[5:49] and the modern technologies that we use
[5:52] for many different conveniences
[5:54] they've all capitalized on and
[5:56] manipulated our hard-wiring as human
[5:58] beings and our chemistry every single
[6:01] one of them they've Advanced at this
[6:02] point where there's things they did back
[6:03] in the day and they just did it and they
[6:05] did it till they found it it worked I
[6:06] tried this and it didn't sell I tried
[6:08] this and it didn't sell I tried this and
[6:09] it didn't work but then I tried this and
[6:11] it worked and through trial and error
[6:12] and through marketing they've been able
[6:14] to use things that get people's
[6:15] attention and now they've actually been
[6:17] able to kind of pull back the curtain a
[6:19] little bit by signs and say this is
[6:20] actually what's happened in people's
[6:22] minds when you do this this is what
[6:24] happens when you allow this to happen
[6:25] and that time so now everything is
[6:27] calculated
[6:28] everything is designed everything is
[6:30] planned and it's all done to try to work
[6:32] off of our hard wiring and our brain
[6:34] chemistry to to manipulate us
[6:37] and to control us
[6:39] and it's made us Restless as we've been
[6:41] using the phrase maybe for a dopamine
[6:42] hit we got to scratch that itch we feel
[6:44] kind of restless and that's that
[6:46] wonderlust for synthetic high from
[6:48] something that's fake
[6:50] that we have this wonderless where we
[6:51] want to uh we want these fake we we get
[6:54] some sort of sense of Happiness which is
[6:57] very very shallow from fake
[6:58] accomplishments from things that have a
[7:00] ping that have a ring that have a sound
[7:02] that flash that do something that that
[7:04] excites us but yet there's really no
[7:06] substance in it
[7:08] and brother Branham says this about
[7:10] the laodicean church age we've got that
[7:12] insured I think so we're good
[7:14] he says it cries that it has a great
[7:16] amplitude of all things this is the age
[7:18] that we're living and it cries we've got
[7:19] everything we need we've got this we've
[7:21] got that it cries with that there's a
[7:23] great amplitude of all things but it
[7:25] keeps burning with desire like an
[7:27] unsatisfied fire this is the age that
[7:30] we're living in this is the if you want
[7:31] to hear a characterization of the age
[7:33] we're living in it says they cry that
[7:35] they have a great amplitude of all
[7:36] things and the church said
[7:38] okay right that was not very
[7:41] enthusiastic remember we're talking
[7:42] about everybody else out there come on
[7:44] relax a little but we cry that we have a
[7:46] great amplitude of all things but it
[7:48] keeps burning with desire like an
[7:50] unsatisfied fire and it's this
[7:52] characterization that helps us
[7:54] understand even better what Revelations
[7:55] 3 17 means because they're saying wow
[7:58] we're rich we're increased with Goods we
[7:59] have need of nothing but their actions
[8:01] declare otherwise
[8:03] burning with an unsatisfied fire in
[8:06] other words desire has not produced
[8:10] the right thing it hasn't produced
[8:12] satisfaction it's not producing some
[8:14] sort of patience it's not producing
[8:15] endurance it's not producing I'm content
[8:18] with what I have it's burning like an
[8:20] unsatisfied fire and in this our
[8:23] attention spans have shrunk and we're no
[8:25] longer to achieve longer periods of
[8:27] thought or quiet we're unable to we've
[8:29] lost the ability to focus uh it's
[8:31] becoming weaker we're uneasy with
[8:34] silence
[8:35] we're uneasy when things are just still
[8:37] we need something to kind of fill it up
[8:39] imagine if we all came in here before
[8:42] service 30 minutes early and there was
[8:44] nothing on the overhead there was no
[8:46] music playing everything was just still
[8:47] we'd start getting uncomfortable
[8:49] because we're no longer comfortable with
[8:51] something still we're no longer
[8:53] comfortable with quiet we get uneasy
[8:55] when something's not moving and
[8:56] something's not flashing when there's no
[8:58] lights and so this is if you if you're
[9:01] trying to you're waiting for me to call
[9:02] out what it is you have to make this
[9:04] applicable
[9:06] I everyone every single one of us have
[9:07] some other way this is Manifest in
[9:09] itself because guess what I'm using
[9:11] scriptures that have been used for a
[9:13] couple thousand years I'm using quotes
[9:15] that have been used for decades and they
[9:17] had their application and days gone by
[9:19] and they'll have various applications
[9:21] among us tonight just exactly how our
[9:24] attention and our focus is being lost
[9:26] and how the world is using different
[9:28] things to kind of side track US
[9:30] John chapter 10 verse 10 it says the
[9:32] thief cometh not but for to steal and
[9:35] there's a thief's not coming to add the
[9:36] thief's not coming to give the thief is
[9:38] not coming to make things better but it
[9:40] comes to steal and to kill and to
[9:42] destroy
[9:43] so there's a thief that wants to take
[9:45] from you
[9:46] there's a thief that wants to kill
[9:48] something they want to destroy something
[9:49] if they can't take it they want to kill
[9:51] it if they can't kill it they just want
[9:52] to ruin it there's a thief that wants to
[9:54] do that but he says I am come that they
[9:56] might have life and that they might have
[9:58] it more abundantly this phrase awakens
[10:01] us to the reality that we can have life
[10:02] but then you can also have it more
[10:04] abundantly it's not just a matter of
[10:06] breathing but it's about it's about
[10:07] thriving and living well and having
[10:09] things in our lives that are worth
[10:10] living for so he says I am come that you
[10:12] might have life and that you have life
[10:14] more abundantly if I could say this and
[10:17] if it sounds old-fashioned I mean it
[10:18] with all my heart the word is the way to
[10:20] live Christ says I am come that you
[10:22] might have life I'm come that you might
[10:24] live and that in living you might have
[10:25] it more abundantly in other words the
[10:27] word is the way to live
[10:29] but the thieves are robbing they're
[10:32] killing and destroying our peace our
[10:34] patience our desire for God our pleasure
[10:37] that's what the thief comes to do
[10:40] I'm identifying all these different uh
[10:42] information and communication
[10:44] Technologies all these uh gadgets or
[10:47] games or apps or opportunities and they
[10:49] can just even be Pursuits we have a lot
[10:52] more recreational opportunities
[10:54] available to us in the day that we're
[10:55] living in uh there's there's space made
[10:58] for that there's accommodation given
[11:00] there's opportunities and resources that
[11:02] allow us uh to be that's one of the
[11:04] things about Phoenix is there's no off
[11:05] season when it comes to baseball
[11:08] you can play baseball year round if you
[11:10] want to and I imagine that they probably
[11:12] even have fantasy leagues even for the
[11:14] for all the semi-pro leagues and the all
[11:16] the high school leads that are going on
[11:17] you can stay busy in sports every day of
[11:20] the year in a climate like this
[11:22] and so there's all sorts of things that
[11:24] I would like to refer to as thieves that
[11:26] are robbing killing or destroying your
[11:29] peace
[11:31] your patience your pleasure
[11:33] and with the death of patience comes the
[11:35] loss of Hope
[11:37] and with the loss of hope it leads to
[11:39] the lack of real living
[11:41] the lack of life
[11:44] and one phrase it and if I could just
[11:46] say this I meant to say it in the outset
[11:47] that maybe a lot of the things I'm
[11:48] sharing tonight are these little pieces
[11:50] that we didn't spend some time on that
[11:53] we just had in our heart from the
[11:54] beginning and a phrase I've been wanting
[11:56] to use I think I've just referred it a
[11:57] few times as a zombie scroll
[12:00] it's a phrase that if you use in within
[12:02] Media or technology they're certainly
[12:04] mindful of it because it's just it's
[12:06] zombie School refers to a Mindless
[12:08] action just out of habit
[12:10] and the phrase that was used by some of
[12:12] the ones that first coined it with no
[12:15] real destination or benefit
[12:17] it's a Mindless scroll it's the moving
[12:20] of the thumb
[12:21] I just uh the that constant repetitive
[12:25] movement where there's it's a Mindless
[12:28] action out of habit if I could tie it
[12:30] into some of the things we've mentioned
[12:31] before kind of this constantly seeking
[12:33] out a reward
[12:34] that that just that right one that we
[12:37] can follow the right one that we can uh
[12:38] we can kind of whatever it is you do
[12:40] smash subscribe subscribe you know turn
[12:43] on notifications whatever it is send a
[12:45] like there retweet there's just
[12:47] something you're waiting for that moment
[12:49] to fire off and then because of this
[12:50] zombie mindset
[12:52] uh it our minds are unfocused
[12:56] and the more unfocused our minds are
[12:58] getting the the more
[12:59] unsatisfied we're becoming or
[13:01] dissatisfied we're becoming and if
[13:03] anything we're just more distracted than
[13:05] we've ever been before
[13:07] I know we've mentioned this before and
[13:09] it's probably well well known and been
[13:10] entered into many people's uh vocabulary
[13:13] these days is the Paradox of choice and
[13:16] scientifically and academically they're
[13:18] still debating it and they're still
[13:19] wondering whether or not some of the
[13:20] studies can be replicated or the
[13:21] findings can be replicated so let's
[13:23] select the academics um debate it and go
[13:25] by your own experience when you're given
[13:27] more things to choose from you're
[13:29] generally less happy with the choice you
[13:30] made
[13:31] he's like man I knew I should have
[13:33] ordered you know number 612 of of the
[13:36] 1200 thing you know 1200 options I've
[13:39] had my my common dad joke when I go to a
[13:42] place like Cheesecake Factory is can I
[13:43] have the large menu
[13:44] right because they just give you pages
[13:47] and pages I didn't order an encyclopedia
[13:49] there's there's pages and pages of
[13:52] choices and the more options you have
[13:53] the least satisfied you're going to be
[13:55] so think about the day and age we're
[13:56] living in when there's there's more
[13:59] flavors of water now than you had
[14:01] choices in blue jeans when you were a
[14:03] kid
[14:04] and there's more options and more
[14:06] choices it just makes us more uh
[14:08] fragmented and Scattered and and more
[14:11] upset and distracted
[14:13] the Bible says in Ecclesiastes chapter 6
[14:15] verse 7 all the labor of man is for his
[14:17] mouth and yet the appetite is not filled
[14:21] maybe we could preach that to speak of
[14:22] gluttony
[14:25] um still remember brother Lonnie Jenkins
[14:27] preaching on it once
[14:28] but man seeks to satisfy his selfish
[14:32] urges
[14:33] that to say um it Labor's for his mouth
[14:35] it's for self-gratification you know
[14:37] it's man is not laboring for your
[14:39] somebody else's mouth or even his
[14:41] family's mouth but a man first seeks to
[14:43] satisfy his own urges and his own
[14:45] desires but it says but yet the appetite
[14:47] is not filled in other words he's never
[14:49] really happy from it
[14:51] I'm going to labor as the Bible says
[14:53] that all things are full of Labor I'm
[14:55] going to labor to make myself happy but
[14:57] I'm never able to make myself happy so I
[14:58] just keep laboring to make myself happy
[15:00] and they're just kind of caught up in
[15:02] this constant working to satisfy an urge
[15:05] but the Bible says in Galatians chapter
[15:07] 5 verse 24 and they that are Christ have
[15:11] crucified the flesh with the affections
[15:13] in lust
[15:15] quite a remarkable scripture
[15:17] could I just make an observation if it
[15:20] feels this weird when we open up this
[15:21] big it'll be scary if we ever get a
[15:23] higher ceiling in a bigger Church
[15:26] we might just have to force people to
[15:28] sit on all the front rows and maybe
[15:30] build in a drop ceiling first and just
[15:33] slowly raise it up over a couple years
[15:35] before we just kind of know oh wait a
[15:37] minute
[15:37] because it just it feels just a little
[15:39] bit different tonight so if there's more
[15:41] room for sound if there's more room that
[15:45] I'm trying to take up with my voice you
[15:47] fill it with amens and will feel warm
[15:50] and fuzzy
[15:52] this scripture here to me is one that is
[15:55] very remarkable maybe easy to be
[15:57] misunderstood it says they that are
[15:59] Christ have crucified the flesh with the
[16:01] affections and lust it we read it to say
[16:04] if you are Christ or if I could put it
[16:07] this way it does not say if you are
[16:09] Christ then your flesh with its
[16:11] affections and lust are dead
[16:13] is saying they that our Christ have
[16:15] crucified the flesh with affections and
[16:17] lust so we could read it to say well if
[16:19] I was Christ then my affections and lust
[16:20] would be dead but that's not the way
[16:22] that it's written because the affections
[16:24] that are mentioned here are just merely
[16:25] your emotions
[16:27] and it says that lust speaks of um the
[16:30] wrong kind of desires so it's not saying
[16:32] that the barometer to determine whether
[16:34] or not you are Christ and been baptized
[16:35] into Christ is that you have no emotions
[16:37] and no wrong desires but it does mean
[16:39] something that they that are Christ are
[16:41] in the habit and manner of taking any
[16:43] wrong emotion and making it subject to
[16:45] Christ and taking any wrong desire in
[16:48] making it subject to Christ being a
[16:50] Christian does not mean that being
[16:52] joyful in the Lord and happy the Lord is
[16:54] not the absence of any disconcerting
[16:56] emotion doesn't mean I'm never sad just
[16:58] means I'm always believing but this kind
[17:00] of the emotional Harmony that comes or
[17:01] that we can have as a Christian is
[17:03] knowing that my sadness does not overrun
[17:06] me that my despair does not drive me
[17:08] that my emptiness and my anxiety is not
[17:11] my kind of my banner or my covering but
[17:14] I can be I can be at a some level of
[17:16] confidence and have some sort of
[17:18] stability saying I know I'm sad I know
[17:20] I'm hurting I know I'm frustrated but
[17:22] Christ is my is my banner he's the one
[17:24] that will cover me so the Bible says if
[17:26] you are Christ you crucified the flesh
[17:29] that strong language crucified would be
[17:31] the most horrible punishment means to
[17:33] kill it to private of Life your emotions
[17:35] and your wrong desires
[17:37] Romans 8 13 if you live after the flesh
[17:40] ye shall die
[17:41] we have to think of this not just in
[17:43] terms of one or the other it's absolute
[17:45] that if you live after the flesh you're
[17:47] going to die a physical death and that
[17:50] you'll die spiritually and you can't be
[17:52] a son or daughter of God he's speaking
[17:54] morally in this ethical sense of your
[17:56] confidence in your spirit and Your
[17:58] vitality as a believer that if you live
[18:00] after the flesh you're going to
[18:01] spiritually dying but if ye remember the
[18:04] scripture if you eat through the spirit
[18:05] do mortify the Deeds of the body ye
[18:09] shall live
[18:10] therefore we have through the spirit the
[18:13] power to mortify the Deeds of the body
[18:15] under the influence of the spirit we can
[18:17] be active in our own mortification of
[18:19] the Deeds of the body the desires of the
[18:22] flesh the longings and the wants of our
[18:24] minds and our Spirits if you live after
[18:26] just the wants of the mind and the
[18:27] spirit if you just kind of obey your
[18:29] thirst and you're driven by the things
[18:31] that uh your mind wants then he says
[18:34] that's death but if you can buy the
[18:35] spirit mortify that then you shall
[18:38] actually live
[18:39] Colossians 3 5 says mortify Therefore
[18:41] your members which are upon the Earth
[18:44] this the members here is it's not a
[18:47] commandment to the leadership of a
[18:49] church to kill the members of it nor is
[18:51] it commandment to get deprive a physical
[18:53] life of any member in your body but it
[18:55] says mortify Therefore your members
[18:57] which are upon the Earth this is how you
[18:59] do it and these are the members it's
[19:01] talking about these these working things
[19:03] fornication
[19:04] I don't need to give the definitions of
[19:06] these I believe you could find your own
[19:07] appropriate definition uncleanness
[19:09] inordinate affection evil concupiscence
[19:12] and covetousness it says which is
[19:14] idolatry
[19:16] and this is speaking of all these things
[19:18] and saying deprive of power the things
[19:21] that deify yourself
[19:23] deify your flesh in other words it gives
[19:25] preeminence to what your mind wants what
[19:28] your spirit wants uh and and what you
[19:30] you might be inclined to do physically
[19:32] what you might be inclined to do by
[19:34] Desire by emotion deprived of power the
[19:36] things that worship yourself deify
[19:38] yourself and the things that are created
[19:40] over the things of God
[19:42] because to practice these things the
[19:44] fornication then cleanness the jealousy
[19:46] the lusting the covetousness the
[19:48] inordinate affection the lack of
[19:49] moderation it says is idolatry it places
[19:52] self over God
[19:54] as I was reading these scriptures today
[19:56] and just looking over my notes it's
[19:58] crucified the flesh mortified the Deeds
[20:00] mortified Therefore your members this is
[20:03] this is an instruction that works
[20:05] against the Instinct of laodicea an age
[20:08] which is people's rights an age which is
[20:09] about preservation and age which is to
[20:12] accommodate and and allow yourself to uh
[20:14] to be yourself and to uh make
[20:17] contingencies for any any person's
[20:20] uniqueness or peculiarities to where now
[20:22] uh you know we don't even believe you
[20:24] should I believe that we have to we
[20:25] ought to have the right to be offended
[20:27] ourselves and we ought to just carry
[20:29] that and say you know what I'm going to
[20:30] be offended it's just the time we're
[20:31] living in but everyone's wanting to be
[20:32] so careful about people's rights and the
[20:34] way people are to our now layout to see
[20:36] is just characterize the exact opposite
[20:38] of this because there's no
[20:39] self-sacrifice
[20:41] there's no pain there's no denying the
[20:43] flesh as a matter of fact they expressed
[20:45] the flesh instead of subduing it
[20:48] give expression to those thoughts you're
[20:50] having give expression to the battles
[20:52] you're having it's completely opposite
[20:54] to the scripture
[20:56] I wish I had a way to express this I've
[20:58] been reading some things
[21:00] and and I it's I guess in a way as I
[21:04] read it I realize this is very heavy
[21:05] dense reading that's kind of maybe from
[21:07] a philosophical standpoint but if I
[21:10] could just kind of put it in my own
[21:11] words the Bible is so beautiful
[21:13] in that as you read the gospels and you
[21:15] read the New Testament and even as it's
[21:17] joined to the Old Testament it answers
[21:19] all the questions
[21:21] it's it's not like the the traditional
[21:24] mythologies it's not like all the the
[21:26] myths that have been passed down it's
[21:27] not all the the heroes Journeys that are
[21:29] in there there's not all the uh all the
[21:32] the ways that they try to say all the
[21:33] patterns in the gospel and all the
[21:34] patterns in the Bible that you see the
[21:36] saying Ark and storyline in every other
[21:38] religion and all sorts of other cultures
[21:40] but none of them have the answers that
[21:43] the cross has none of them have the
[21:45] answer that the empty grave has none of
[21:46] them have the answer that the way the
[21:49] Bible approaches says look we're just
[21:50] going to pull the curtain back and we're
[21:53] going to be honest about human nature
[21:54] we're going to be honest about mythology
[21:55] we're going to be honest about Legends
[21:57] we're going to be honest about the mind
[21:58] going to be honest about humanity and
[21:59] it's the only one that answers the
[22:01] weakness of mankind
[22:03] the rest have built a religion to prop
[22:05] up their weakness
[22:07] and so laodicea does it gives expression
[22:10] to the flesh instead of mortifying it
[22:13] but I believe that by faith we can
[22:15] control our Feelings by faith we can uh
[22:19] control our emotions and subdue the our
[22:22] wrong wants or our wrong desires as it
[22:24] says they that are Christ have crucified
[22:26] we can bring under subjection our
[22:28] feelings and our emotions we can subdue
[22:30] the wrong wants and the wrong desires
[22:34] as so much of this has been building off
[22:36] the definition of wonderlust
[22:38] that dissatisfaction that Restless Drive
[22:42] just trying to find something that can
[22:43] make us happy and fulfilled brother
[22:45] Brown says if your faith is set right
[22:46] we've read it enough or some of you may
[22:48] be able to finish it and if our faith is
[22:49] set right in the right position it gives
[22:51] a constant satisfaction
[22:56] what that needs what is it that needs to
[22:57] be set right in the right position
[23:00] our faith
[23:02] not the pulpit some of you may be
[23:03] sitting here going oh man mathematically
[23:05] that's just not in the right spot
[23:06] they're not using the golden ratio to
[23:08] put the Cajon and the piano and the bass
[23:11] and and brother Aaron's head is taller
[23:13] than the backdrop and you just didn't
[23:15] realize how tall I am
[23:17] there's all sorts of things you might be
[23:19] thinking oh no oh no on this no no no no
[23:21] no no you got to get your faith set
[23:23] right
[23:23] it's not getting everybody where they
[23:25] need to be it's not about getting all
[23:27] your Ducks lined up and if I could just
[23:28] get this and I think I just get that and
[23:30] you think that in your life you're just
[23:31] going to allow things to kind of
[23:33] magically click into space and like oh
[23:35] there you go got it everything's
[23:36] clicking everything's in the place that
[23:38] it needs to be then I'm going to be
[23:39] happy and you're running the numerology
[23:41] and you're running this and you're
[23:42] running that you're trying to figure out
[23:43] no let that take care of itself
[23:45] let the calendar let economics let
[23:48] politics let it all take care of itself
[23:49] if you can get your faith set right in
[23:51] the right position that's what gives
[23:53] constant satisfaction and by constant
[23:56] satisfaction and contentment I'm not
[23:58] just referring to uh you know some
[24:00] Franciscan monk that's just like I'll
[24:03] just take the haircut and the driving
[24:04] clothes and I'll just be happy with the
[24:06] vegetables I grow in my garden and just
[24:08] kind of live this forced austereness no
[24:10] we're talking about real Joy a constant
[24:12] satisfaction not a a legalistically
[24:15] imposed austerity or legalistically
[24:17] imposed sadness and soberness but real
[24:20] real happiness
[24:22] focus on this statement I don't have it
[24:24] for you in the slides but I want to read
[24:26] this
[24:27] as a maybe just a quote that you can
[24:29] write down and uh
[24:32] and do it in a really nice font with a
[24:34] good filter and put it on Instagram
[24:35] hashtag real living
[24:38] he says you've got to have faith
[24:40] but you've got to know how to use that
[24:42] faith
[24:43] to make yourself well to get happiness
[24:45] out of life
[24:47] you know why we may not be getting the
[24:49] happiness and satisfaction we want out
[24:51] of life because we're trying to use
[24:51] everything else but faith
[24:54] you might say well I have faith great
[24:55] and I'm not happy oh now that you have
[24:58] faith you have to know how to use it
[25:00] he says not only to make yourself well
[25:02] we might say oh that has to do with
[25:03] physical healing well it's emotional
[25:04] healing as well it's some sort of
[25:06] Harmony among the parts and to get
[25:08] happiness out of life here's the secret
[25:10] to all believers the world have other
[25:13] means to give them what they call
[25:15] happiness but for a Believer God has
[25:17] given you Faith to get the satisfaction
[25:19] you want out of life and you say oh no
[25:21] oh no I wish I could get it out of a
[25:23] bottle I wish I could get it out of a
[25:24] pill I wish I could get it out of
[25:25] accomplishment sorry he elected you to
[25:28] something different you might as well
[25:29] just lean into it and just accept it
[25:32] that your real satisfaction is going to
[25:34] come from using your faith right because
[25:37] that's how a Believer gets happiness out
[25:39] of life
[25:41] when we preached on a desired detox I
[25:43] was not suggesting a simple dopamine
[25:46] detox nor was I suggesting a digital
[25:49] detox
[25:51] what I was suggesting was a death to
[25:53] deadly desire
[25:55] that in a desire detox it's recognizing
[25:58] that even a dopamine detox is somewhat
[26:00] of a misnomer because it's always active
[26:02] there's always dopamine present in your
[26:04] brain unless you have some serious
[26:05] disease and it's not something that we
[26:08] want to just regulate dopamine and
[26:10] figure out ways we can all build a sense
[26:14] deprivation tank on some other part of
[26:16] this property so we can figure out ways
[26:18] it's my turn it's my week just to
[26:20] deprive my no that's not it it's not
[26:21] gimmicky
[26:23] it's not some sort of new fad where you
[26:25] gotta we're going to try a dopamine
[26:27] detox or even a digital detox I think uh
[26:29] some of those things are great in
[26:31] individual circumstances and may work
[26:33] well with certain things but as a church
[26:35] I'm not prescribing a digital detox we
[26:37] all throw away
[26:39] um our blackberries and we all get rid
[26:40] of our uh
[26:42] Commodore 64s or whatever it is we're
[26:45] using these days I'm not I'm not
[26:46] suggesting that I'm not suggesting that
[26:48] we get rid of anything but or even
[26:51] change habits except to the extent that
[26:53] you recognize there's things in your
[26:55] life that are stimulating desire
[26:58] I mean there's things that are 8-bit
[27:00] that are just as addictive as things
[27:02] that are that are in full HD and 3D so
[27:05] it's more recognizing desire
[27:08] you can say well you know brother Aaron
[27:09] the best series you ever preached was on
[27:11] wonderlust and wonder lost I got rid of
[27:12] all of my digital devices and and I no
[27:15] longer have any screens and it's just
[27:17] been it's been a life changer so that's
[27:19] wonderful I haven't seen you in a while
[27:20] at church oh that's because I'm I'm on
[27:22] the reservation at the casino now
[27:25] and I I I don't play the slots brother
[27:27] Aaron they're digital now
[27:29] I just roll the dice and played the
[27:31] cards physical bro they are no batteries
[27:34] it's not I'm not suggestion at all that
[27:36] it has to do with the digital detox or
[27:38] dopamine deprivation it's about death to
[27:41] deadly desires as the Bible says if you
[27:44] live after the flesh you shall die that
[27:46] the labor for the mouth is not
[27:48] satisfying it's recognizing these
[27:50] scriptural things if I could say this
[27:51] it's taking
[27:53] it's a matter of taking deliberate
[27:54] scriptural steps
[27:56] the death of Desire or desire detox is a
[27:59] deliberate scriptural steps to kill the
[28:01] flesh mortify the Deeds of the flesh
[28:03] crucify the flesh through the spirit
[28:05] subduing and mortifying the Deeds of the
[28:07] flesh mortifying your members which are
[28:09] upon the Earth which is like these
[28:10] things that work in idolatry it's a
[28:12] matter of taking those things and
[28:14] starving off and bringing under
[28:15] subjection the carnal desires
[28:19] in doing so this is the theme of rest a
[28:22] Restless mind The Wonder of Christ in
[28:23] doing so it's going to rest and Liberate
[28:26] the mind
[28:28] it's going to allow your mind the mind
[28:29] is what is the the thing that is feeding
[28:31] off of the things of the world your soul
[28:33] doesn't feed off of it so it's not
[28:35] becoming more robust there's something
[28:37] in the mind that's feeding off of it and
[28:39] the more that you can starve desire and
[28:41] get this begin to detox the desire of
[28:43] the Mind the chemistry the hardwiring
[28:45] get that get the mind to slow down the
[28:47] more your mind will be able to
[28:48] contemplate
[28:50] the more that you'll find Wonder in the
[28:53] things of God
[28:56] the battle in the mind as we mentioned
[28:57] Sunday brother Branham said the battle
[28:58] in the mind he said the place where
[29:00] decisions are made
[29:02] the mind is what controls actions it's
[29:04] what controls thought
[29:06] there's just you could think about this
[29:08] in a very broad way just how the mind
[29:10] works and just how it's present in
[29:11] everything we do
[29:13] and this battle in the mind is what's
[29:15] raging right now
[29:17] the human mind brother Brahm says was
[29:19] chosen for the place of battle at where
[29:21] it was begun and that is because
[29:23] decisions are made from the mind the
[29:25] head
[29:27] that's why Satan chose the mind
[29:29] but God knowing better chose the heart
[29:32] and all that the world can offer you is
[29:34] some sort of stimulation to the mind to
[29:37] the detriment of the heart
[29:38] and so when we think of the greatest
[29:40] battle ever fought I think we could all
[29:41] agree it's in my mind it's in my mind
[29:43] I'm having mind battles how many battles
[29:44] in my mind and it can be a matter of
[29:46] just all the neurons firing in the brain
[29:48] chemistry and sicknesses and nutrition
[29:51] and all sorts of Mind battles can all
[29:53] come back to things that are happening
[29:54] in the mind and they realize that it's
[29:56] not just the brain that creates the mind
[29:58] but there's things actually in our gut
[29:59] our biome and our gut and all sorts of
[30:01] things that kind of create the person
[30:03] the mind the personality the spirit and
[30:05] brother Adam said the human mind was
[30:07] chosen he's referring to the head
[30:08] because that's the place decisions are
[30:10] made and we recognize the greatest
[30:12] battle ever fought is in the mind but I
[30:14] want to remind you again if there's a
[30:16] place where the battle's being fought
[30:18] it's not just where everyone convenes to
[30:21] fight and then goes back to their
[30:22] strongholds there's a battle in the mind
[30:25] because that's where Satan chose to
[30:27] hunker down and there's a battle because
[30:29] now God is fighting Satan in that Realm
[30:33] if it wasn't for the Holy Spirit
[30:34] fighting in that realm it wouldn't be
[30:36] much of a battle but God is fighting not
[30:38] in your mind but God the word is
[30:40] fighting for your mind I believe that we
[30:43] ought to have this kind of conviction in
[30:45] our heart that it's not just a battle in
[30:47] the mind it's a battle for the mind and
[30:50] that's a battle that I want the Holy
[30:51] Ghost to win and I don't want just
[30:53] Redemption of my soul and I'm not just
[30:55] living for Redemption of my body but I
[30:57] want Redemption of this mind
[31:00] the Bible speaks of it in so many
[31:02] different places Romans 12 2 about the
[31:03] renewing of your mind I've been drawing
[31:06] so much from God's power to transform or
[31:07] the power of transformation how it's by
[31:10] the renewing of our mind
[31:12] the word has power to stabilize your
[31:14] thoughts it has power to win our mind
[31:16] the Bible says in Philippians let this
[31:18] mind be in you
[31:21] brother Stephen Bryant was sharing with
[31:23] me how he was reading in the Bible in
[31:25] the Book of Genesis and he was just
[31:27] remarking how
[31:29] God said let there be and I thought it
[31:31] was a real powerful observation he said
[31:33] it's it's worded in such a way to where
[31:35] God just allowed it
[31:37] let there be
[31:39] that was the act of God creating he
[31:41] allowed it to be that's just how great
[31:42] he was as if there was some Force inside
[31:45] of him and a powers out of a desire to
[31:48] have a vision inside of him that was
[31:50] bound up and if he wanted to see it he
[31:52] just let it happen
[31:53] and then the Bible tells us to let this
[31:56] mind be in you in other words he's given
[31:58] you some sense of power to let it be
[32:00] that it's bound up inside of you by the
[32:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the whole
[32:06] Barnyard full of chickens is saying I
[32:08] hope whatever he does this doesn't let
[32:10] the mother Christ come in him right
[32:12] they're all looking at you like an eagle
[32:14] and everything in this Barnyard in this
[32:16] layout to see in realm chicken Cooper
[32:17] living in is all trying to get you to
[32:20] not let this mind be the Bible no the
[32:23] Bible teaches the message teaches the
[32:25] devil's heard that and all his imps that
[32:27] the bride has the mind of Christ or keep
[32:29] still and so what he's trying to do is
[32:31] make you busy enough to where you won't
[32:33] sit still and so busy you don't
[32:35] recognize you have the mind of Christ
[32:37] and we need to let that mind be in US
[32:42] in Ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse excuse
[32:44] me Ecclesiastes chapter seven
[32:47] verse 29 Lo this only have I found this
[32:51] is summary language
[32:53] he gets to the end he says hey at the
[32:55] end of the day this is it fear God and
[32:57] keep his Commandments
[32:59] that's the only way you're going to be
[33:00] happy it's the only way you can secure
[33:02] anything of worth low this only have I
[33:04] found that God hath made man upright God
[33:06] in the beginning made mankind pure but
[33:09] the devil having mingled it
[33:11] man has now he says they have sought out
[33:13] many inventions
[33:15] distracted from distraction by
[33:18] Distraction
[33:19] they sought out many inventions it's
[33:21] processes and meditations of the mind it
[33:23] comes from the root to plan or to devise
[33:26] it's a reckoning in their minds this is
[33:28] important for you to catch this
[33:30] because I'm I am uh this is not a
[33:33] wonderless sermon I know exactly where
[33:34] I'm going to end up
[33:36] they they plan and they devise the word
[33:39] means to reckon so this is man he's
[33:41] Reckoning now he's thinking in his mind
[33:44] this will make me happy
[33:47] this is where true Joy will be oh if I
[33:49] just do this think about Solomon Solomon
[33:51] said I'm the wisest man if I just enjoy
[33:54] luxuries and have the best food and have
[33:56] the best wine and get all the best
[33:57] amenities if I just chase this if I just
[33:59] marry how many wives does it take to be
[34:01] happy well not even a thousand will do
[34:02] it and so he's just looking and trying
[34:05] to find a happiness and trying to figure
[34:06] out something and he's saying they have
[34:08] some sort of plan or scheme some meaning
[34:10] or intent they're Reckoning and it's the
[34:13] process of the mind so it says they have
[34:15] sought out which they seek and they
[34:16] inquire or they desire the things that
[34:19] they're Reckoning
[34:21] they're seeking to satisfy the Reckoning
[34:23] of the mind I reckon if I eat that it'll
[34:26] make me happy I reckon if I can go on
[34:28] that vacation it'll make me happy I'm
[34:30] seeking out all these calculations in my
[34:32] mind that keep telling me Oh trust me if
[34:34] you just do it it'll be the end of it
[34:36] I think all you got to do is go
[34:37] skydiving and you'll never need to climb
[34:39] a mountain you'll never need to do
[34:40] anything else no it's not true
[34:42] just you say well I I climbed a mountain
[34:45] then you find out there's another one
[34:46] taller hey
[34:49] all right and then you then you're
[34:50] trying to climb all the the tallest and
[34:52] then you're trying to climb them
[34:53] backwards
[34:55] with Crocs
[35:03] in Psalms 94 19 with all these
[35:06] they're seeking they're seeking to
[35:07] satisfy Restless mind
[35:09] so think of how the psalmist writes this
[35:10] and to me it's just a sister scripture
[35:12] to what the Solomon was saying in the
[35:14] wisdom in that family and all the
[35:16] different writers of that age certainly
[35:18] this speaks to it that man has sought
[35:20] out many inventions but then it says in
[35:21] the multitude of my thoughts Within Me
[35:23] thy Comforts Delight my soul
[35:26] all these reckonings I imagine if I did
[35:28] this I imagine if I did that all these
[35:30] things that the Mind keeps saying
[35:32] the zombie scroll I'm like oh yeah
[35:36] right and everything that keeps
[35:39] bombarding the Mind here's this Moment
[35:41] of clarity but you know what it's your
[35:42] Comforts that Delight my soul
[35:45] I think it's beautiful that as a church
[35:47] we still come together on a Wednesday
[35:49] night and Sunday mornings that most of
[35:51] you and to your compliment or here 30
[35:54] minutes early and when we come we're not
[35:55] just shooting the breeze and talking we
[35:57] sit down and we're still and that our
[35:59] services in total are lasting and we're
[36:01] getting out around noon and we're here
[36:03] for two at two and a half hours
[36:05] and I think it's great because that's
[36:07] that's the greatest distance some of us
[36:09] are going to ever get
[36:11] from everything else out in the world
[36:13] and I think it's one of the reasons why
[36:15] the traditional service and the way that
[36:17] we continue to have services and the way
[36:19] that it was established and we can stay
[36:21] true to in the word of God is Services
[36:23] just like this it's because it's not
[36:25] catering to the short attention span
[36:27] where we have pyrotechnics and smoke
[36:30] machines and lights during the song
[36:31] services strobing
[36:34] yeah 10 000 reasons give me another 10
[36:38] right
[36:39] and you're all hyped up right and
[36:42] everything's great and then it's done
[36:43] and then the pastor gets up they're like
[36:44] is that Armani right and then he talks
[36:48] for a while in some psycho gibberish and
[36:50] like that yeah that was really good that
[36:51] was great I mean it was in 20 minutes 30
[36:53] minutes right 45 minutes and then guess
[36:55] what they want to heard you out
[36:57] because they got another group waiting
[36:59] to come in for the light show right
[37:01] someone asked us the other day so how
[37:02] many services do you have how big is the
[37:04] church and oh how many services and I
[37:06] was just like one
[37:07] we just have one service like you're
[37:09] Arizona Believers Church shouldn't you
[37:11] have an A and A B and a c
[37:13] right
[37:16] shouldn't there be some more service
[37:17] times as I don't know how many we would
[37:19] have if we broke it up into shifts
[37:21] but I think it's great we do it this way
[37:23] what because we're not going to cater to
[37:26] that base instinct to just give me a
[37:27] snippet
[37:29] if any one of you are working on
[37:31] producing any kind of YouTube shorts for
[37:33] my sermons or you know some tick tocks
[37:36] let's consult first only if we can
[37:39] monetize it
[37:41] but that's not the way the gospels to be
[37:42] preached that's not the way it's
[37:43] supposed to be presented that's not
[37:45] that's not that's not the angle and and
[37:47] maybe I should just qualify nothing to
[37:49] be said about doing that but that's
[37:51] that's not our message this is where it
[37:53] comes
[37:54] through Gatherings like this this is the
[37:56] foresight of God to know that moments
[37:59] like this can strengthen the spiritual
[38:01] man strengthen the internet and give you
[38:02] the kind of fortitude when there's
[38:04] something pressing and wanting you to
[38:05] give in you know say I know that I have
[38:07] it in me to sit still for a while
[38:10] and in the multitude of my thoughts
[38:12] within me it's your comforts
[38:15] with all the activity in our mind our
[38:16] anxieties our fears our desires he's
[38:18] saying God with all the reckonings and
[38:21] all the processes and all the multitude
[38:22] of
[38:23] static and buzzing and pinion that goes
[38:26] on in my head it's whenever it's your
[38:28] consolation that soothes me
[38:32] it's a Soother
[38:33] to satisfy her
[38:35] it's it's that thing that begins to
[38:37] placate us it's a it's a it's the
[38:39] blanket to the child
[38:41] they talk about if when you're raising
[38:43] children and babies there's certain
[38:44] things you give them to kind of soothe
[38:46] them and even as they deal with people
[38:47] with certain ticks and things and mental
[38:49] struggles later in life or anxieties
[38:51] they tell them to do things that can
[38:52] soothe and and certain ways that they
[38:54] try to bring that sense of comfort this
[38:56] is beautiful he says it's your Comforts
[38:58] it's your consolations that soothe me
[39:01] I believe it's a direct rebuttal to
[39:02] wonderlust because it's saying in the
[39:04] multitude of my thoughts your Comforts
[39:06] are what Delight in the multitude of all
[39:08] the thoughts in other words in all this
[39:10] the thinking that my desire is going to
[39:12] somehow lead me to something new or
[39:14] better
[39:15] I find it's your consolation that
[39:17] actually satisfies I've got all these
[39:19] thoughts that there's going to be
[39:20] something novel enough to quench I think
[39:22] I got all these thoughts tell me that
[39:24] there's something better and if I know
[39:25] there's not something better I just feel
[39:27] that if it's something else some pattern
[39:28] interrupt something different that
[39:30] that's going to lock everything into
[39:31] place and finally I'll be able to Exhale
[39:34] and just begin to really live and and
[39:36] what he says it's your consolation it's
[39:37] a rebuttal of this wonderless that says
[39:39] you're not going to find
[39:41] something better
[39:43] it's his Comforts that Delight your soul
[39:46] Ecclesiastes chapter 4 verse 1.
[39:49] so I returned and considered all the
[39:51] oppression that are done under the sun
[39:55] all the oppressions that are done under
[39:56] the sun
[39:58] and behold the tears of such as were
[40:00] oppressed
[40:04] and tears of all those that were
[40:05] oppressed
[40:06] and they had no comforter
[40:08] and we think that makes a lot of sense
[40:10] those who are oppressed they they don't
[40:12] have a comforter they don't have
[40:13] something to satisfy they don't have a
[40:15] place of their own that they return to
[40:17] that they're free from the fear of it
[40:19] being taken the the oppressed have a
[40:21] task master over them that's why they're
[40:23] always unsettled that's why they have no
[40:25] comforter the word there is they have no
[40:26] consolation they have no ease
[40:29] the oppressed have no rest
[40:31] but then it says on the side of their
[40:32] oppressors there was power
[40:35] but they had no comforter
[40:37] this is the observation you're not
[40:39] you're not uneasy because you don't have
[40:41] more power
[40:43] you don't have the power you want you
[40:44] haven't accumulated enough it's it's
[40:45] it's changing the thought process that
[40:48] if I could just get to the Top If I
[40:49] Could Be the king of the hill I'll have
[40:51] comfort
[40:52] I only feel this way because I in the
[40:54] I'm in the position I'm in he says the
[40:56] oppressed have no comforter and on the
[40:58] side of their oppressors they that had
[40:59] the power there was no relief from
[41:01] desire
[41:02] there was no relaxing of thirst all the
[41:04] oppressed who have not they they don't
[41:07] have comforter because they have things
[41:08] taken away from they don't have the
[41:10] means to get the things that make them
[41:11] happy they don't have the power to be at
[41:13] rest but on the side where there's power
[41:15] there's no relaxing of their thirst
[41:19] in the sermon Hebrews the series Hebrew
[41:22] series chapter 3
[41:23] he says you ask them about it listen to
[41:26] this response I I I I know I'm being
[41:28] lengthy
[41:30] uh tonight it's just been so comfortable
[41:32] with just the right uh the right mix of
[41:35] faith and and you pulling the right
[41:37] group of people here tonight is just a a
[41:39] Clear Channel
[41:40] so this is you ask them about uh
[41:44] you know just you're provoking thought
[41:47] and
[41:47] brother Adam he's talking about just
[41:49] this greater desire or hunger and the
[41:51] things of God he says well we got our
[41:52] television
[41:53] that's how we find Comfort all right go
[41:55] ahead and update it right
[41:58] we got our
[42:01] perfect timing
[42:03] that's how we find comfort
[42:06] and he said that's the American attitude
[42:10] we got television we got plenty of money
[42:12] we got Fine Cars got nice homes what do
[42:15] we need with the Lord we don't need that
[42:18] you put a put a beat to that and to go
[42:20] viral
[42:21] we got television we've got plenty of
[42:23] money we got Fine Cars got nice homes
[42:24] what what do we need the Lord with the
[42:27] Lord what are we having we don't need
[42:28] that he says and that's the attitude now
[42:30] if I can say this if it's not thought of
[42:33] or spoken
[42:34] the attitude's evidenced in the action
[42:38] he says this is the attitude now they
[42:39] may not say we've got television we've
[42:41] got Comfort we've got television and
[42:43] money and flying cars nice homes we
[42:45] don't need the Lord we don't need that
[42:46] they're maybe not saying that but the
[42:48] attitude is evident in action
[42:52] they said he says that's their comfort
[42:55] they're trying to find comfort in these
[42:57] luxuries Comforts in Technologies
[42:59] Comforts and television the media and
[43:02] the the sensitize of the Flesh and the
[43:03] satisfying of Desire but there's a
[43:05] greater comforter
[43:07] Jesus said I'll send you a comforter
[43:09] he's an advocate it's one that's
[43:11] summoned to your side to be a helper and
[43:14] discomfort is the one that gives true
[43:16] rest
[43:17] and I'm grateful for this comforter I'm
[43:19] grateful for how brother I'm spoke of
[43:21] the comforter and how in a dangerous day
[43:23] of so much Temptation and so much
[43:25] pulling on the flesh that we have a
[43:27] comforter that can keep us from it
[43:29] if you don't have that hope then then I
[43:31] say you you seek the baptism of a holy
[43:34] ghost with everything that is in you
[43:36] because in the day and age you're living
[43:37] in God will let you fall flat on your
[43:39] face to tell you you are nothing without
[43:41] me the Bible does not say through
[43:44] religion or through a repetition of
[43:46] scripture or some sort of Mind exercise
[43:47] that we can mortify the Deeds of the
[43:49] body but it's only through the spirit
[43:51] that we can mortify the Deeds of the
[43:53] body that means he is my helper in that
[43:55] mortification he is my Aid and my helper
[43:58] in mortifying the Deeds of the body and
[44:01] therefore I have him as my Advocate and
[44:03] he's the one that gives me rest from all
[44:06] these things
[44:07] the Bible says in Matthew chapter 11
[44:09] verses 28 29 and 30 come unto me all ye
[44:12] that labor
[44:14] all the labor of man is for his mouth
[44:17] all things are full of Labor
[44:19] this come unto me all you that labor
[44:21] those of us who are full-time students
[44:23] or live at home and don't have a job we
[44:26] might say oh well that scripture's when
[44:27] I grow up no this is for those who
[44:29] actually are
[44:30] recognize every day as a toil
[44:33] come unto me all you that labor and are
[44:35] heavy laden
[44:36] and I will give you rest
[44:41] and then it's just this amazing
[44:44] image take my yoke upon you I don't have
[44:47] the time tonight I'm just going to have
[44:48] to go more quickly through this but take
[44:51] my yoke upon you and learn of me
[44:53] for I am meek and lowly in heart
[44:56] and ye shall find rest unto your souls
[44:59] it's odd how it speaks on one hand that
[45:01] you are some sort of Beast of Burden who
[45:03] is laboring and heavy laden and then
[45:05] there's this invitation for rest and
[45:07] you're thinking oh I'm going to throw
[45:08] this off and now I'm going to come over
[45:10] here and he's got I got another one for
[45:12] you
[45:14] but he says my yoke is easy and my
[45:15] burden is light
[45:17] so there is a yoke there is a burden but
[45:20] it's only in this that you find rest
[45:23] amen it's in that yoke and that burden
[45:24] where there is true rest
[45:26] and that as it says come unto me and you
[45:28] I'll give you rest it means to refresh
[45:31] means to take ease
[45:33] to cause one to cease and desist from an
[45:36] activity
[45:38] that that draws from their strength that
[45:41] draws from their vigor it means to cease
[45:44] from something to give you to to allow
[45:47] you to recover and collect your strength
[45:51] come unto me yehu laboring and heavy
[45:54] laden cease from this activity so that
[45:56] you can recover and collect strength
[45:59] rest
[46:01] recover
[46:03] that's what addicts do right they go
[46:05] into recovery
[46:06] we need to rest cease from this activity
[46:09] so we can recover our strength it speaks
[46:11] of relieving of the strain of Desire
[46:14] Come Ye that are laboring and heavy
[46:17] laden come and I'll give you rest I'll
[46:18] give you rest from that strain
[46:20] I'll relieve you from the strain of
[46:22] Desire just take your yoke upon me in
[46:25] Philippians chapter 4 verses 4 to 9 it
[46:27] says be careful for nothing
[46:29] but in everything by prayer and
[46:30] supplication with Thanksgiving that
[46:33] Thanksgiving is such an important part
[46:35] that with the spirit of gratitude it
[46:37] builds patience
[46:39] and that where you're grateful and
[46:40] you're thankful you're able to endure a
[46:42] lot more he says let your request be
[46:43] made known unto God this is an answer to
[46:46] anxiety this is an answer to
[46:47] restlessness this is a prescription for
[46:49] those who are seeking comfort in things
[46:52] that don't provide it
[46:53] and the peace of God which passeth all
[46:55] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[46:57] Minds through Christ Jesus this is an
[46:59] escape from those who are desperately
[47:01] trying to love the things they
[47:03] desperately want
[47:04] if it seems strange to you some of you
[47:07] it'll click and then we'll be singing
[47:09] Take the name of Jesus with you and
[47:11] you'll go ah
[47:13] amen
[47:14] because there's things in our lives that
[47:17] we desperately want but if we're honest
[47:18] we don't even like it let alone love it
[47:21] so what we try to do is we're trying to
[47:23] love the things we want we're trying to
[47:25] love the things that have come by great
[47:26] cost and we've invested so much in we're
[47:29] trying to convince ourselves through
[47:30] cognitive dissonance no I love this I
[47:32] love this I I actually do love this and
[47:34] this is the rest for those who are
[47:36] constantly trying to love the hurtful
[47:38] things they want
[47:40] come unto me
[47:43] through prayer and supplication I could
[47:45] spend much more time on this prayer and
[47:47] this supplication this come having a
[47:49] place where you rest aside from all the
[47:51] demands of life and from that place of
[47:53] rest and that coming aside now that
[47:55] you've secured the time and the place
[47:56] you begin to desire God
[47:59] and I believe that we can find our
[48:01] satisfaction and rest in The Wonder of
[48:03] Christ
[48:05] in The Wonder of the word that's our
[48:07] rest and that's our Focus
[48:09] continue to verse 8 finally Brethren
[48:11] whatsoever things are true
[48:13] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[48:16] things are just
[48:19] whatsoever things are pure
[48:22] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[48:24] things are a good report
[48:27] they could just think of these things
[48:29] true honest just pure lovely good report
[48:34] these things are so contrary to the
[48:36] synthetic experiences we have these
[48:39] things are real
[48:41] and he says if there be any virtue the
[48:43] strength that there be any praise Or
[48:44] Glory this honor if there be any virtue
[48:46] and if there be any praise think
[48:49] on these things I think I'm hitting my
[48:52] Runway here where we could try to well
[48:53] we're going to be able to end I'm not
[48:56] want you to start the clock or whatever
[48:59] don't get somebody warming up in the
[49:01] bullpen I'm going to finish this one
[49:05] true honest just pure lovely good report
[49:08] are these things
[49:11] he says think on them
[49:13] reckon
[49:15] just as the Bible said and all the
[49:16] multitude of my thoughts and I go
[49:18] seeking after desire and all these
[49:20] things that was talking about before
[49:21] where it's this Reckoning of Mind where
[49:22] the man thinks I reckon I've sought out
[49:25] many inventions I reckon if I do this
[49:26] it'll bring me happiness I reckon that
[49:28] this is the way that it is I reckon I
[49:30] reckon it says hear that think to reckon
[49:33] to account it deals with reality
[49:36] not assumptions
[49:37] it's coming from the root of logos
[49:40] logis oh my
[49:42] it means it deals with realities just as
[49:45] men have sought out many inventions
[49:47] they've reckoned things but it didn't
[49:48] satisfy this is what it reads in the
[49:51] Lexicon if you read it if I think or
[49:53] this logozamai if I reckon my bank has
[49:57] 25 in it it has 25 in it
[50:01] so it says if there be any praise if
[50:03] there be any virtue then think on these
[50:05] things let's reckon on these things
[50:07] because if you're going to meditate on
[50:09] something if you're going to ponder
[50:11] something and think about it if you're
[50:12] going to reckon something then if you
[50:14] say bye I have 25 in the bank if it
[50:16] doesn't have 25 in the bank you've been
[50:19] deceived
[50:20] you're Reckoning is wrong your Reckoning
[50:22] is off so if it doesn't whatever I
[50:24] reckon if I think this will bring me
[50:26] happiness if I think this will bring me
[50:28] peace and it doesn't I've reckoned wrong
[50:30] I've been deceived and so this is the
[50:32] empty promise in the empty vanity of
[50:35] Desire where I and of media and
[50:37] information communication technology we
[50:39] think it's going to make us happy it
[50:41] never has and never will
[50:43] it's created these shallow synthetic
[50:45] experiences of oh I feel like I have
[50:48] some Cloud I feel like I have some value
[50:49] I feel like I have some Prestige you're
[50:51] keeping up with the pretense and it's
[50:53] giving you some shallow social rewards
[50:55] that mean a lot to people but in real
[50:57] genuine long-lasting happiness it's
[50:59] never provided it for anyone
[51:04] think on these things
[51:06] the things that are true and honest just
[51:07] and pure lovely and good report this is
[51:10] the focus I was talking about
[51:11] Focus to bring to focus on something as
[51:14] a verb is to bring something into Focus
[51:16] the noun that point of conversion
[51:17] convergence
[51:19] and the etymology of the word is just
[51:21] very beautiful Focus
[51:22] the point of convergence it comes from
[51:24] the Latin Hearth or fireplace
[51:27] because that would be the point of
[51:29] convergence in a home
[51:31] that would be the place where the family
[51:32] would gather
[51:34] so this word that's used for Focus The
[51:36] Hearth the fireplace it's figurative of
[51:37] family figurative of home
[51:40] with that that have to have that kind of
[51:42] focus when you you bring something to
[51:44] focus as a point of convergence this is
[51:47] the opposite of wonderlust
[51:49] because now you have a hearth
[51:51] you have a fireplace you have a common
[51:54] meeting point a point of convergence
[51:55] that no matter where we've all been and
[51:57] what we've done we have some place in
[51:58] common we have something in common we
[52:00] have some goal it's the opposite of
[52:01] Wunderlist where there is no hope there
[52:03] is no fixed Destiny there is no place
[52:05] that we say this is where we come
[52:07] together and we have common ground
[52:09] that's what church becomes it becomes a
[52:11] focus it becomes a refocusing we come
[52:13] from all the other places that we've
[52:15] been and we can come back to a place
[52:16] like this and say this is where we come
[52:18] together again
[52:20] this is the Earth this is the Gathering
[52:22] point
[52:24] to refocus means to transfer
[52:27] to a center of activity or energy
[52:30] what is that Center true honest pure
[52:33] lovely just good report
[52:37] if there be any you all you know the
[52:39] scripture by heart you've probably
[52:40] already created a nice little post for
[52:42] it
[52:43] that has a nice ring to it this is
[52:45] reality any praise any virtue think on
[52:48] these things
[52:49] we have what I've called the distraction
[52:52] pandemic
[52:54] and it's something that has just rapidly
[52:56] taken over the world it's gone viral
[52:58] like an infectious disease
[53:00] where everyone is distracted
[53:03] we're becoming we're and this
[53:06] distraction comes with the price
[53:09] distracted driving
[53:11] is an activity we often hear about they
[53:13] say any activity
[53:15] a distracted driving would be engaging
[53:17] in any activity that distracts you from
[53:19] the primary job of driving
[53:21] so distracted driving is anything that
[53:23] would deter
[53:24] deter your attention away take your
[53:26] attention away from the task of driving
[53:29] and they said that if you talk on your
[53:31] cell phone or the a person who's
[53:33] impaired with a .08 blood alcohol level
[53:36] is four times more likely
[53:40] uh to have a crash if you're drunk right
[53:42] .08 four times more likely to have a
[53:44] crash than someone who's not drunk it's
[53:46] the same for talking on a cell phone
[53:49] so we're thinking oh man these drunk
[53:50] drivers it's premeditated murder and
[53:52] these guys who drink and drive you know
[53:53] all right talking on the phone increases
[53:56] your chance for an accident just as much
[53:59] as drinking and driving
[54:01] now don't just throw in the towel and
[54:02] start drinking
[54:03] it tells us that the mind is just as
[54:07] impaired as one is intoxicated with a
[54:11] substance as they are when their mind is
[54:13] distracted by a conversation
[54:15] just as likely and they say that if you
[54:18] text while driving it increases the
[54:20] likelihood of a crash up to eight times
[54:24] so talking on the phone is the same as
[54:25] being drunk driving texting you might as
[54:28] well be blackout drunk
[54:30] creases the likelihood eight times
[54:34] this is just with respect to a very
[54:36] dangerous activity that requires our
[54:37] retention I just want to use it as an
[54:39] analogy of just how fragmented our minds
[54:41] have become in our daily activities
[54:44] so this is just what the devil wants us
[54:45] to do get so concerned about all these
[54:47] social things and these media things and
[54:49] these entertainment things and these
[54:51] Sports things because it's going to
[54:52] consume you enough to where you're not
[54:54] paying attention to how you're leading
[54:55] in the home how you're driving your
[54:58] children
[54:59] you're just going to leave it to
[55:00] everybody else to satisfy the needs of
[55:02] those in your lives it comes with the
[55:04] cost
[55:07] and I believe the function and design of
[55:09] laodicea is just to fragment our minds
[55:12] the very function of the very design of
[55:14] it is just to take our attention away
[55:15] from The Wonder of Christ
[55:17] in Jeremiah chapter 6 verse 16
[55:20] I love the scripture I'm so glad I was
[55:22] able to get to it thus saith the Lord
[55:23] stand ye in the ways and see
[55:27] and ask for the Old Paths where is the
[55:30] good way
[55:32] I think we need a little bit more some
[55:34] more throwback believer stuff right
[55:37] being those vintages is all the rage
[55:40] right people want things that are
[55:42] vintage why because it's only things
[55:44] that last
[55:45] if there's if there's antique shows in
[55:47] 30 years Ikea is not going to be
[55:49] featured at all right these things
[55:51] aren't going to make it
[55:53] it's the things that were real and had
[55:56] substance and value in these things that
[55:57] they that they used to make with real
[55:59] materials
[56:00] you think that's a couch it's just a
[56:02] hologram couch that they've put in your
[56:04] bedroom you're thinking isn't that a
[56:06] great couch it's like The Emperor's New
[56:07] Clothes with all the things we're buying
[56:11] standing in the ways and see and ask for
[56:14] the Old Paths where is the good way when
[56:16] I say throwback Believers okay maybe
[56:19] vintage Christians I'd rather be an
[56:20] old-time Christian than anything I know
[56:22] to be an old-time Christian you have to
[56:24] let loose at some of this new Time stuff
[56:27] and walk therein and you shall find rest
[56:29] for your souls what a prescription stand
[56:32] in the ways and see ask for the Old
[56:34] Paths where is the good way walk in that
[56:36] and that's what's going to Delight you
[56:38] that's what's going to satisfy that's
[56:40] what's going to bring the stabilization
[56:41] in the home that's what's going to set
[56:43] your mind at ease but it says we will
[56:45] not walk therein
[56:47] I believe it's important for us to find
[56:49] the good path
[56:50] and I say it because as I'm trying to
[56:52] turn the corner here to close
[56:55] I recognize the danger in some of these
[56:57] things that sometimes when we preach
[56:58] Against The Usual Suspects of addiction
[57:01] and pornography and entertainment and
[57:02] movies and all these different things
[57:04] and you preach on it that we could just
[57:06] swap out an unbridled lust for just a
[57:09] real strict legalism
[57:11] and it never satisfies the legalism will
[57:14] never satisfy
[57:17] just going to the ex to another extreme
[57:19] just swapping out addictions isn't going
[57:21] to change you
[57:22] so it's important to find the old path
[57:24] and just not swap out addictions
[57:26] brother Branham says in the sermon he
[57:28] cares do you care
[57:29] he says we find all those things is
[57:31] because people are trying to find
[57:32] Comfort that's why we see the things the
[57:34] accumulation of things and media and
[57:36] multimedia and televisions and
[57:37] entertainments and apps and all these
[57:39] things it's because man's trying to find
[57:41] peace
[57:42] they're trying to find something he says
[57:44] and remember your comfort is your
[57:45] religion
[57:46] and you make those things your religion
[57:49] these things that we're trying to find
[57:51] comfort in the things that we find
[57:52] identity and the things that we find
[57:54] rewards and the things that we seem to
[57:56] be prospering in and finding success in
[57:58] he's saying people are seeking and
[58:00] searching and doing all these things
[58:01] because they're trying to find rest
[58:03] they're trying to find Comfort he says
[58:04] you're whatever you find your comfort in
[58:06] you make it your religion
[58:09] why because religion is used to cover
[58:12] the nakedness your desires producing
[58:15] you run after your desires and you
[58:17] realize I'm still naked you run after
[58:18] your desires you realize you're still
[58:19] naked so you make it a religion to cover
[58:22] yourself up
[58:24] he says your comfort is your religion
[58:29] and you make those things a religion and
[58:31] religion is just a covering
[58:34] so I say just religion is not the answer
[58:37] hold this in your mind let me say this
[58:39] because I trust it's part of the theme
[58:41] of where we may go next religion is very
[58:43] unsafe when we lose sight of Christ
[58:46] here at Christian religion I'll say it
[58:48] this way the message is very unsafe when
[58:51] you lose sight of Christ
[58:55] I'm pausing so you can write it down and
[58:56] you're all just looking at me
[59:00] I hope you remember it
[59:03] because just religion is not the answer
[59:05] just uh spell it out brother and tell me
[59:07] what I can do digital detox help me give
[59:09] me give me give me just tell me straight
[59:11] and I'll do it
[59:12] that's more dangerous
[59:15] because you're in the set you'll take
[59:17] the same the same weakness that caused
[59:20] you to do something habitually you'll
[59:22] transfer it to something that I ask you
[59:24] to do legally and you know better off
[59:26] no closer to Christ
[59:28] I've just swapped places with Apple and
[59:31] Google right and we've come out of Lao
[59:34] to see it and we come into a really
[59:35] strict rigid religious culture and now
[59:37] that's what binds us and satiates
[59:41] right
[59:42] because it's not just religion
[59:44] it's not about finding your place in
[59:47] church and making sure that you have
[59:48] things to do and and giving you all
[59:51] things to make you feel satisfied no I
[59:52] want you to find Christ
[59:54] I I say this and I know it it and maybe
[59:56] it carries with it the risk that you all
[59:58] would leave but my desires that you find
[1:00:01] Christ and if you have to leave here to
[1:00:03] find it I'm happy with that
[1:00:05] because that's the only thing that
[1:00:06] satisfies and all the years that I've
[1:00:09] served the Lord and the churches I've
[1:00:10] served in and the places I've lived and
[1:00:12] all the things I've done the only thing
[1:00:14] that is satisfied is Christ that's where
[1:00:16] I found my peace that's where I found my
[1:00:19] joy and God help me if I would ever want
[1:00:21] to drop you a vet
[1:00:24] that's why I call it not just wonder
[1:00:26] last and leave it at that but it's
[1:00:28] Wonder lost because I want you to fall
[1:00:30] in love with Christ all over again and
[1:00:32] every time I preach I would that you
[1:00:35] fall in love with Christ
[1:00:38] he says in Exodus 33 14 he said my
[1:00:41] presence shall go with thee
[1:00:43] and I'll give you rest
[1:00:48] and let me say there's a lot of singing
[1:00:50] about his presence I hear the modern
[1:00:51] worship songs it's all about his
[1:00:53] presence and you realize they're talking
[1:00:55] about how they feel when they get
[1:00:56] together and sing
[1:00:59] that's the presence that they find
[1:01:00] beautiful
[1:01:01] is is the momentum you get with the
[1:01:04] right chord progression and the right
[1:01:06] layers and the right sounds and good
[1:01:08] good writing and a great atmosphere and
[1:01:10] and the the kind of the hive mentality
[1:01:12] and the mob mentality listen have a
[1:01:14] great time and that's what people call
[1:01:16] the presence but that's not what sums up
[1:01:19] his presence
[1:01:20] his presence isn't summed up in religion
[1:01:22] it's not summed up in worship it's not
[1:01:23] summed up in the manifestation of the
[1:01:25] gifts it's more than that
[1:01:27] there's an outpouring of his Spirit
[1:01:29] there's gifts of the Spirit there's a
[1:01:31] moving of the spirit those things are
[1:01:32] wonderful and and we they ought to we
[1:01:34] ought to have the Liberty to enjoy them
[1:01:36] but let's not ever convince ourselves
[1:01:38] that that's the presence that this
[1:01:39] message is trying to introduce us to and
[1:01:42] that's that's that satisfies if I could
[1:01:44] just make it to church oh oh brother
[1:01:46] Aaron preaches when he preaches on
[1:01:48] Wednesday night that's when we really
[1:01:49] get worked up and we have a little bit
[1:01:50] more exuberance and and things get the
[1:01:52] flowing really good I'm gonna get my fix
[1:01:54] no it's not in that
[1:01:57] that's not going to be what was
[1:01:58] satisfying
[1:01:59] as I've studied this this anchors deep
[1:02:02] in my heart I say it was so much grace
[1:02:04] and God helped me to declare it for I
[1:02:05] feel that I must that we can cover up
[1:02:08] worldly Desire with charismatic worship
[1:02:10] and a religious fervor
[1:02:13] hey bro when I studied the message of
[1:02:15] the hour time and time again brother
[1:02:17] Brown's complaint and gets
[1:02:18] Pentecostalism was their lack of modesty
[1:02:21] and Holiness in their personal lives and
[1:02:24] he was uncovering a downside and a
[1:02:25] detriment to when we leaned to the
[1:02:27] Pentecostal we leaned to the sensations
[1:02:29] we leaned to the manifestations brother
[1:02:31] random told us that's where the passions
[1:02:33] Run Deep that's where the fussing begins
[1:02:35] that's where the backbiting is why
[1:02:36] because that can stimulate the mind and
[1:02:39] the spirit just as much as the other
[1:02:40] things and if you're not Anchored In
[1:02:42] Christ you can use charismatic worship
[1:02:44] you can use shouting and dancing in the
[1:02:47] manifestation I guess to cover
[1:02:49] worldliness at home and a lack of
[1:02:52] modesty and thinking and it's happened
[1:02:54] for the hundreds of years
[1:02:59] when I said this
[1:03:01] religion becomes unsafe when we lose
[1:03:04] sight of Christ
[1:03:05] we could become addicted
[1:03:08] in unhealthy ways to religious
[1:03:10] activities
[1:03:14] it may it never be
[1:03:16] that this church causes you to do
[1:03:19] anything unhealthy
[1:03:21] whether it be by requiring of you
[1:03:23] service
[1:03:24] or giving you opportunities and find
[1:03:26] ways that that you could feel satisfied
[1:03:29] know it in Christ first
[1:03:32] if you want to fill up all the time in
[1:03:34] the day just just ask the trustees
[1:03:36] there's a there's a job to do if you
[1:03:38] want a busy yourself for religious
[1:03:40] things and things that have to do with
[1:03:41] the church and things that have to do
[1:03:42] with missions that we could find
[1:03:44] something for you to do but if it's not
[1:03:46] a conduit For the Love of Christ that's
[1:03:48] bound up in your heart if it's not
[1:03:49] coming from a safe place because you
[1:03:51] love the Lord and this is something you
[1:03:53] believe then there's many unhealthy
[1:03:55] things we can give ourselves to you say
[1:03:58] where's this coming from I could preach
[1:04:00] against the wonderlust and get your
[1:04:02] attention and you try to move yourself
[1:04:05] away from the world but let's not run to
[1:04:07] something else that's doubly worse let's
[1:04:10] run to him
[1:04:11] find him in our as our joy fight him as
[1:04:14] our Outlet
[1:04:16] because we can come we can become
[1:04:18] addicted addicted in unhealthy ways to
[1:04:20] church activities and religious things
[1:04:24] and our hearts are bound in a prison
[1:04:27] if church and religious activity become
[1:04:29] our sole focus of safety
[1:04:31] and our sole focus of rest
[1:04:34] God help us to let that may that not be
[1:04:37] where we find our rest
[1:04:40] is it it were prisoners
[1:04:42] if the sole focus of our worship to God
[1:04:46] and the sole focus of our safety and our
[1:04:48] rest
[1:04:49] is bound up in some in church
[1:04:56] I didn't understand why I had this quote
[1:04:58] at this point but it sure makes a lot
[1:04:59] more sense now
[1:05:02] how many have ever read or listened to
[1:05:03] the sermon the invasion of the United
[1:05:05] States I don't know some of you are
[1:05:07] thinking that sounds like a good movie
[1:05:10] but brother Brown preached it in 1954.
[1:05:13] and he was talking about Satan has moved
[1:05:15] his seat from Europe and it's in
[1:05:17] Hollywood read it today with an eye to
[1:05:20] what exists today it's such prophecy
[1:05:23] and he was warning
[1:05:25] in other words you think this is bad
[1:05:27] it's invading
[1:05:29] and he says don't feel angry at me
[1:05:32] you just remember that I'm preaching to
[1:05:34] you
[1:05:35] I want to preach this as if this was the
[1:05:37] last sermon I'd ever preach in my life
[1:05:39] I want to preach every sermon I preach
[1:05:41] as if I was a dying man preaching to
[1:05:43] dying men
[1:05:45] and I am my light's burning down every
[1:05:47] day yours is too we're dying Mortals and
[1:05:50] we've got to face the Living God some of
[1:05:52] these days
[1:05:53] and we better be in deep sincerity about
[1:05:56] this
[1:05:57] and and I failed to go back and listen
[1:05:59] to it because the way it's transcribed
[1:06:01] when you listen to it it's like he's
[1:06:03] saying it's not in this and just in a
[1:06:04] glamor and carrying on and join the
[1:06:06] church and go here and there act this
[1:06:07] way in that way
[1:06:09] we better be serious about this sober
[1:06:11] about this just carrying on joining
[1:06:13] Church going here and there act this way
[1:06:15] in that way no thought to it
[1:06:17] we better have old-fashioned prayer
[1:06:19] meetings in our homes and crying out to
[1:06:21] God day and night
[1:06:22] this is a 1954. the day is at hand a
[1:06:26] time of distress a time of trouble the
[1:06:28] Bible said a dark day and we're living
[1:06:29] in it
[1:06:31] if I could say this I know this might
[1:06:32] seem just to be a little bit odd as I
[1:06:35] say this but this is coming from the
[1:06:36] source of what I've been looking at
[1:06:37] looking from the message of the hours I
[1:06:39] focused on this lately
[1:06:41] what he's admonished them to cry out for
[1:06:42] we've received
[1:06:46] what brother Branham was doing in his
[1:06:48] early Ministry and what he thought he
[1:06:50] was laying a foundation for and what he
[1:06:51] was preaching he was building up to the
[1:06:53] very things the message brought us and
[1:06:55] he was tell him to cry out and the Very
[1:06:56] things they cried out he was telling him
[1:06:58] to cry out for we received
[1:07:00] well because the rest isn't even in the
[1:07:01] crime
[1:07:03] it's in the vindication
[1:07:04] man
[1:07:06] let me say there's a rest for God's
[1:07:07] elect
[1:07:09] there's a proper yoke
[1:07:11] come unto me
[1:07:13] I say let's not be lulled into the
[1:07:15] numbness
[1:07:16] it's like a blanket of a Darkness over
[1:07:19] us it's a cloak we can feel it let's not
[1:07:21] be numbed he says in Galatians 5 1 Stand
[1:07:23] Fast therefore in the Liberty where with
[1:07:25] Christ hath made us free there's still
[1:07:27] some more things to share tonight just
[1:07:29] hold on with me it's 8 35 stand
[1:07:31] therefore in the Liberty where Christ
[1:07:33] hath made us free and be not entangled
[1:07:35] again with the Yoke of bondage
[1:07:38] the Yoke of bondage would be anything
[1:07:39] that hinders
[1:07:41] anything that Masters you anything that
[1:07:44] directs you you that are bound up and
[1:07:46] yoked up with something and you're being
[1:07:48] driven like an ox to do somebody else's
[1:07:50] bidding you're being driven to plow
[1:07:52] somebody else's field you're doing
[1:07:53] driven to do something that's going to
[1:07:54] benefit somebody else take it off put my
[1:07:57] yoke on you it says let's Stand Fast and
[1:07:59] The Liberty where Christ has made us
[1:08:01] free and be not entangled again with the
[1:08:02] Yoke of bondage I say to you if your
[1:08:05] families have found rest in these things
[1:08:06] if you're finding respite from the ever
[1:08:09] presence of media and entertainment and
[1:08:11] YouTube and all these other things if
[1:08:12] you're finding ways to get distance from
[1:08:15] it I say Stand Fast in the Liberty
[1:08:20] true Liberty
[1:08:22] is living as we ought to not as we want
[1:08:25] to
[1:08:27] I know that may not make a lot of sense
[1:08:28] to the world but true Liberty is living
[1:08:32] as you ought to not as you want to
[1:08:35] free from the desires of the flesh not
[1:08:38] just giving into my whims not just
[1:08:40] giving into will I feel this way or will
[1:08:41] I Want It That Way true Liberty is
[1:08:43] living as one ought to
[1:08:46] amen that's the fallacy of the Democracy
[1:08:48] they're trying to sell us now is that in
[1:08:50] Liberty and people's rights and letting
[1:08:52] people do what they want that's not real
[1:08:54] Liberty real Liberty is doing what you
[1:08:56] ought to do
[1:08:57] that's our liberties Christians as
[1:08:59] living righteously to be righteous is to
[1:09:01] be as you ought to be
[1:09:04] I say righteous living is preferred to
[1:09:06] riotous living
[1:09:09] I'll say this too the ought to is where
[1:09:13] Real Love Is
[1:09:17] let me say this
[1:09:22] Micah
[1:09:24] you there'll be me days
[1:09:26] you may not want to
[1:09:28] but you always ought to love your wife
[1:09:32] there may be days when you don't feel it
[1:09:34] there may be times when it's really hard
[1:09:36] but there's never a moment when you
[1:09:38] shouldn't
[1:09:40] does it not make sense to you
[1:09:42] there may be days when it's hard but you
[1:09:45] know that you always ought to
[1:09:47] in Liberty is doing as you ought to
[1:09:49] that's where the Love Is
[1:09:50] you may not feel it it may not be what's
[1:09:52] immediate in your mind there's enough
[1:09:53] dumbing down of our minds there's enough
[1:09:55] layers of complexities and broken hearts
[1:09:58] and relationships and things that
[1:09:59] compile onto somebody where we could
[1:10:01] find a complex that won't allow us to
[1:10:03] break through and it's not doing what
[1:10:05] you want it's doing what you ought
[1:10:06] that'll allow you to break through the
[1:10:08] very things that restrain and bind up
[1:10:09] love that's in our hearts
[1:10:14] it's where real living can be found
[1:10:18] to live and wonder
[1:10:21] not driven by desire
[1:10:25] are you okay with this
[1:10:29] brother Brandon quotes often from the
[1:10:31] Psalm of Life
[1:10:32] it's a poem by Henry Wadsworth
[1:10:34] Longfellow I don't know why we always
[1:10:35] call him by his full name it just seems
[1:10:37] to be what they do
[1:10:39] but it's a poem about the purpose of
[1:10:40] life and how to handle struggles
[1:10:44] and it's brother Brown says I love it it
[1:10:46] tells something it manifests something
[1:10:48] it's got real something into it some
[1:10:50] meanings program's attitude towards it
[1:10:53] and the whole poem opens up with the
[1:10:56] rebuttal to a listener
[1:10:58] who from the as you read it it appears
[1:11:00] as if he's explained Life As a matter of
[1:11:02] numbers and figures
[1:11:03] it's a formula
[1:11:05] it's the algorithm
[1:11:07] it's the matrix it's the mind this is
[1:11:09] the way that we live this is the way
[1:11:10] that you can rig life and figure it out
[1:11:13] and life is all about stats and
[1:11:15] statistics and life is science and
[1:11:16] figures and all these things it says
[1:11:18] it's a rebuttal
[1:11:20] but this is the phrase that brother
[1:11:22] Branham in if you think oh my goodness
[1:11:24] how long is he going to preach
[1:11:26] I'm wondering the same thing
[1:11:29] this this is this is what I'm wanting to
[1:11:31] end with with this thought brother Brown
[1:11:33] refers to over and over again this
[1:11:34] coming to me this week
[1:11:36] be not like dumb driven cattle
[1:11:39] and brother bam talks about it how
[1:11:41] they're being driven and talks about how
[1:11:43] they're driven
[1:11:44] but be not like dumb driven cattle are
[1:11:46] you familiar with brother I'm quoting it
[1:11:48] over and over again
[1:11:49] think about what the dumb driven cattle
[1:11:51] being done they're blindly they're
[1:11:54] walking blindly towards their own death
[1:11:57] dumb driven cattle
[1:12:00] being driven to the death by those who
[1:12:02] stand to gain from their death
[1:12:05] this is the image that Henry Wadsworth
[1:12:07] Longfellow can I just call him
[1:12:09] Longfellow for sake of brevity this is
[1:12:10] what he has in his mind as he's writing
[1:12:13] this and he's writing about the purpose
[1:12:15] of life and the struggles of life and
[1:12:16] even the momentum of things that can
[1:12:18] happen in life and he says don't be like
[1:12:19] dumb driven cattle
[1:12:22] that you're just being driven even if
[1:12:24] it's just this driving force walking
[1:12:26] blindly towards your own destruction
[1:12:27] he's saying fight back
[1:12:30] fight back against those who are hurting
[1:12:32] me like cattle fight back against those
[1:12:34] who are corralling you and using you
[1:12:36] again for your own demise and for their
[1:12:38] benefit
[1:12:40] and in the Psalm of Life it's asking the
[1:12:42] question is life really worthless
[1:12:45] is life a worthless imaginary fantasy
[1:12:49] and I wonder how is it that we can avoid
[1:12:51] this Faith fate
[1:12:53] how is it in this this life that we're
[1:12:55] in now this biblical life this battle
[1:12:57] that we're in right now how is it that
[1:12:59] we're going to somehow rise out of it
[1:13:01] Shake ourselves and stay connected with
[1:13:04] things that matter and give us real
[1:13:05] living how are we going to break free
[1:13:08] Longfellow cells tell me not in mournful
[1:13:10] numbers life is but an empty dream
[1:13:13] for the soul is dead that Slumbers and
[1:13:16] things are not what they seem
[1:13:19] life is real life is earnest and the
[1:13:22] grave is not its goal Dost thou art to
[1:13:24] dust that returnist was not spoken of
[1:13:26] the Soul not enjoyment and not sorrow is
[1:13:30] our destined in their way but to act
[1:13:33] then each tomorrow find us farther than
[1:13:35] today
[1:13:36] this is relevant
[1:13:38] not enjoyment and sorrow that's not our
[1:13:40] Destiny or in but to act
[1:13:42] and that each tomorrow find us further
[1:13:45] than today art is long and time is
[1:13:47] fleeting according from Hippocrates this
[1:13:49] the skill it takes a long time to
[1:13:50] inquire things it takes a long time to
[1:13:52] achieve but time is so short and our
[1:13:54] hearts those Stout and brave still like
[1:13:57] muffled drums are beating funeral
[1:13:58] marches to the Grave
[1:14:00] it's the world's broad field of battle
[1:14:02] in the Bible Book of Life be not like
[1:14:04] dumb driven cattle be a hero in The
[1:14:07] Strife
[1:14:08] in this broad field of battle in this
[1:14:10] greatest battle of the Mind in this
[1:14:11] bivoc of life let us not be like dumb
[1:14:13] driven cattle be a hero in the strife
[1:14:15] and others fight back
[1:14:17] in fact it aspires to do anything is to
[1:14:20] fight back against this onslaught
[1:14:23] trust no future however pleasant Let the
[1:14:26] dead past bury it's dead not beautiful
[1:14:28] how he did that trust no future how
[1:14:30] pleasant it might seem Let the dead pass
[1:14:32] bury its dead act in the living present
[1:14:35] heart within and God overhead
[1:14:38] lives of Great Men all remind us we can
[1:14:40] make our lives Sublime and departing
[1:14:42] leave behind his footprints on the sands
[1:14:45] of time
[1:14:46] footprints that perhaps another sailing
[1:14:48] or life saw the main a forlorn and
[1:14:50] Shipwrecked brother seen shall take
[1:14:52] heart again
[1:14:54] let us then be up and doing
[1:14:57] with a heart for any fate
[1:15:00] still achieving still pursuing
[1:15:03] learn to labor and to wait
[1:15:06] let us then be up and doing
[1:15:08] with a heart for any fate
[1:15:11] still achieving still pursuing learn to
[1:15:15] labor and to wait
[1:15:17] musicians if he'd come
[1:15:21] brother Bradham takes this
[1:15:24] poem
[1:15:27] and he reads apart
[1:15:34] and he ends the sermon God's power of
[1:15:36] transformation he's in it with the
[1:15:38] colonies
[1:15:39] he's asking some just to give their
[1:15:41] heart to the Lord and respond
[1:15:44] and can I could I ask you to search your
[1:15:47] hearts now
[1:15:49] and as we read this quote it's a lengthy
[1:15:52] quote
[1:15:53] but I want you to think of how that
[1:15:55] brother Branham is charging speaking
[1:15:57] this to these people and it's a prayer
[1:15:59] and he's just it and it's so striking he
[1:16:01] says Dear God they're yours
[1:16:03] I've seen two men stand to their feet
[1:16:05] father
[1:16:06] I pray God that you'll take them now
[1:16:08] they want to be your sons
[1:16:11] these men that are standing
[1:16:13] and it's remarkable to think that that
[1:16:16] these these these men
[1:16:18] in this sermon
[1:16:20] preached right here in Phoenix there's
[1:16:22] just two
[1:16:23] in a sermon like this just two
[1:16:28] and this is what he continues to say now
[1:16:30] think about ourselves they have woke up
[1:16:32] from the ignorance of the life that they
[1:16:34] have lived
[1:16:35] and now they want to be afreshed a nude
[1:16:38] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit upon
[1:16:40] that seed that's been planted in their
[1:16:41] hearts this day
[1:16:43] this is what I pray for us that we can
[1:16:45] wake up from the ignorance of this life
[1:16:48] be a fresh and renewed rest refocus
[1:16:52] Eternal God the Creed of all things who
[1:16:54] made your word and I believe that you
[1:16:55] knew these men would do this this
[1:16:56] morning I pray Lord that you will water
[1:16:58] that word day and night and never let
[1:17:00] Satan to pluck it from your hands
[1:17:02] may it be a tree that sometimes in the
[1:17:04] paradise of God when it's all brought
[1:17:05] back again for your word cannot fill
[1:17:07] it'll be again
[1:17:08] likening their lives to be in a tree of
[1:17:10] life
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:12] let it be that tree in the paradise of
[1:17:15] God
[1:17:15] say then there will not be this kind of
[1:17:18] civilization in the world to come
[1:17:20] there will be no automobiles or nothing
[1:17:22] that science has ever done
[1:17:24] there'll be no such things in the world
[1:17:26] that is to come but it'll be God's Own
[1:17:28] type of civilization that he'll set up
[1:17:30] in the Glorious ring
[1:17:32] for in this civilization there is
[1:17:34] sickness death sorrow graze and want
[1:17:37] but in that Kingdom that is to come
[1:17:39] there is no death no sorrow no sickness
[1:17:41] no old age
[1:17:43] oh God it'll be new there
[1:17:45] in your civilization
[1:17:48] my heart pulsating to this as I read it
[1:17:51] today be not like dumb driven cattle
[1:17:54] be not like dumb driven cattle he says
[1:17:57] God transform us today by your power
[1:18:01] by the renewing of our mind to turn from
[1:18:03] the meager elements of this world now
[1:18:05] unto the word of God
[1:18:08] that's all these things the world can
[1:18:09] offer you are meager elements and may we
[1:18:12] be renewed by the transforming power of
[1:18:14] God upon the seed that is in our heart
[1:18:15] that we believe
[1:18:17] and the creatures called Sons and
[1:18:19] Daughters of God this is my prayer for
[1:18:21] you to you father for the people
[1:18:24] in Jesus name
[1:18:26] amen
[1:18:28] could this be your prayer tonight
[1:18:31] that God would transform us
[1:18:33] by the renewing of our minds
[1:18:35] from the meager elements of this world
[1:18:38] I pray for you rest
[1:18:40] and refocus
[1:18:42] may God grant it in our individual lives
[1:18:44] of personal lives
[1:18:46] I think of the young men that are living
[1:18:48] and their singlehood in this day and age
[1:18:50] and maybe retreat
[1:18:52] to their homes or their apartments by
[1:18:54] themselves alone to the young couples
[1:18:57] trying to make a way in this world to
[1:18:58] the families raising children the
[1:19:00] fearful thoughts of raising no matter
[1:19:02] where we are in life we need him
[1:19:04] we need that Solitude we need that
[1:19:06] quietness we need the Stillness
[1:19:08] and I I just sum up this series on
[1:19:11] wonderlust and wonder lost I say rest
[1:19:14] cease and desist from the activity
[1:19:18] that's draining you
[1:19:20] so that you can recover strength
[1:19:22] and then refocus on the word
[1:19:25] because that's what will transform us
[1:19:27] could we stand together tonight
