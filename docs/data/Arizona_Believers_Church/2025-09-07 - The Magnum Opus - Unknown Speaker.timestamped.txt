[0:00] John chapter 6 verse 30- 42. I um I
[0:07] realize this may be a little lengthy and
[0:11] I'm was wanting to cover a lot more in
[0:13] this particular um John chapter 6 30-42.
[0:17] Let me get out of John chapter 10. It's
[0:20] like wait this isn't even adding up.
[0:22] John chapter 6 verse 30 it says and they
[0:27] said therefore unto him what sign
[0:28] showest thou then that we may see and
[0:32] believe thee what dost thou work our
[0:35] fathers did eat mana in the desert as it
[0:38] is written he gave them bread from
[0:40] heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them
[0:42] verily verily I say unto you Moses gave
[0:44] you not that bread from heaven but my
[0:46] father giveth you the true bread from
[0:48] heaven for the bread of God is he which
[0:50] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[0:52] unto the world. Then said they unto him,
[0:55] Lord, evermore give us this bread. And
[0:57] Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of
[0:59] life. He that cometh to me shall never
[1:01] hunger, and he that believeth on me
[1:02] shall never thirst. But I said unto you,
[1:05] that ye also have seen me, and believe
[1:08] not. All that the Father giveth me shall
[1:10] come to me, and him that cometh to me, I
[1:12] will in no wise cast out. For I came
[1:14] down from heaven, not to do my own will,
[1:16] but the will of him that sent me. And
[1:19] this is the Father's will which hath
[1:21] sent me, that all which he hath given
[1:25] me, I should lose nothing, but should
[1:27] raise it up again at the last day. And
[1:30] this is the will of him that sent me,
[1:33] that everyone which seeth the Son and
[1:35] believeth on him may have everlasting
[1:37] life, and I will raise him up at the
[1:39] last day." The Jews then murmured at him
[1:42] because he said, "I am the bread which
[1:43] came came down from heaven." And they
[1:45] said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of
[1:48] Joseph, whose father and mother we know?
[1:50] How is it then that he saith,"I am come
[1:53] down from heaven?"
[1:55] Amen. You can be seated.
[2:00] My title may strike you as a little bit
[2:01] odd, especially if you've never heard
[2:03] this phrase before, but I'm calling it
[2:04] the magnum opus. As we've been on the
[2:06] subject of art lately on music, as of
[2:09] late all year, we've been kind of using
[2:11] that uh analogy of art, God being the
[2:14] ultimate artist. over the last several
[2:15] services been using music uh as a
[2:18] template for examining certain truths in
[2:20] the Bible. And so this may be a familiar
[2:22] phrase to some of you. The magnum opus.
[2:25] I'm calling it the magnum opus.
[2:28] Wednesday night we ministered on the
[2:29] key. I just want to take a few moments
[2:30] to go back over some of these subjects
[2:32] on the key. Christ is the key. Never
[2:36] forget that. Christ is the key. He is
[2:38] the way out of darkness. He is the truth
[2:41] exposing error. He is the life that
[2:43] overcomes death. That's the key, the
[2:45] way, the truth, the life. And Christ uh
[2:48] is the only there's only one key.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; So what's the key? How can we figure
[2:52] this out? What's the key? Jesus Christ.
[2:54] And we should never forget that in
[2:56] everything that we experience and
[2:57] everything that we go through, Jesus
[2:58] Christ is the only key. Maybe a lot of
[3:00] things that we appreciate, a lot of
[3:02] things we love, we say, "Well, church is
[3:03] the key. Church is the key." Well, it's
[3:06] important. It's part of it. But what
[3:08] would church be without Jesus Christ?
[3:11] What would church become if we focused
[3:12] on something other than Jesus Christ?
[3:14] And a lot of you can imagine what that's
[3:16] like because you've experienced it, but
[3:18] you Jesus Christ is the key, but you can
[3:21] only grasp him by faith. And so we
[3:24] looked at it from the standpoint that
[3:26] faith is the hand holding the key. You
[3:28] can all acknowledge the key. There's the
[3:30] key. There's the book. It's sealed. It
[3:32] can't read it. And how can we read it?
[3:34] And what can we do? And we can all
[3:35] acknowledge truth even by reading
[3:37] factual things. But what does it take to
[3:40] really grasp it and to have it and to
[3:42] hold it? It takes faith to do that. So
[3:44] faith is the hand to hold the key. It's
[3:47] the only hand that can hold Jesus
[3:49] Christ.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; Uh it cannot be historical record. It
[3:52] can't be, you know, transcripts found in
[3:54] in uh clay pots in in Syria. It's got to
[3:57] be something real that you find by faith
[4:00] and believe. And a key, as we could just
[4:03] kind of surface it this way, key is
[4:05] something that's crucially important.
[4:07] And so if that's the it's the key to
[4:08] this. It's crucially important. And that
[4:10] way we could say church is but Christ is
[4:12] the key. And we could say a key is
[4:13] something that's important. Musically
[4:15] it's that tone or note. So you could say
[4:18] in music a key is a tone or a note. And
[4:20] then just combining those things
[4:22] together, the keyynote. You've heard
[4:23] that phrase before, the keynote. It's
[4:25] that leading idea, that central
[4:28] principle. And Jesus Christ is that
[4:30] leading idea, that central principle or
[4:33] the principal theme in the entire Bible.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; That's what it that's what the Old
[4:38] Testament is prophesying of. That's what
[4:40] the New Testament is foreshadowing is
[4:42] Jesus Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[4:45] And so if Christ is the principal theme
[4:48] of the Bible, he should be the key to
[4:50] our lives. He should be the keynote. He
[4:52] should be that principle in our life.
[4:55] and faith says we're going to look be
[4:58] looking really specifically at faith. I
[4:59] felt led after Wednesday night just to
[5:01] continue along this pathway. The sermon
[5:03] today I believe would have fit perfectly
[5:05] maybe on that last service of the year
[5:07] when you have been preaching on art all
[5:09] year long then it's the magnum opus
[5:11] right you reach that great climactic
[5:13] ending I just feel that now's the moment
[5:16] but faith is the keynote to scripture
[5:19] uh because without it you cannot you
[5:21] cannot know Jesus Christ or God because
[5:23] the Bible teaches us he's known by faith
[5:26] and that's very easy to say but if
[5:28] anyone here has ever wrestled with faith
[5:30] it can be the the the inverse So that is
[5:33] scary
[5:33] &gt;&gt; cuz you're like, "Well, I thought I knew
[5:35] what maybe I don't know." And there can
[5:37] be a lot of external things in our
[5:39] flesh, the mind and body war, and they
[5:42] fight because it's like, "Well, what is
[5:43] faith?" Because you're so used to seeing
[5:44] things and touching things and and you
[5:46] want to be able to go by something very
[5:48] very real and and uh uh tangible, but
[5:51] yet this faith is elusive. Because what
[5:54] faith itself is a sense, and we try to
[5:56] figure out, we try to contact that faith
[5:59] through these other senses. We want to
[6:01] at least. Wouldn't it be great if you
[6:03] could just strangle faith and just be
[6:05] like, I got my hands around its neck and
[6:08] I see it and I'm going to look it in its
[6:09] eye and say, "You're mine."
[6:10] &gt;&gt; But we're not able to do that.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; But yet, it's still this keynote. In
[6:15] Ephesians 2:8, it says, "For by grace
[6:17] are you saved through faith, and that
[6:20] not of yourselves." And we could say,
[6:22] "The grace isn't of yourself, nor is the
[6:24] faith. It is the gift of God." Amen.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; So the salvation of grace is received by
[6:31] faith. This is the faith of Christ. Not
[6:34] just in Christ. This is faith in Christ.
[6:37] But then also the faith of Christ. By
[6:39] grace. You are saved through faith. So
[6:41] you can say how were you saved? By
[6:42] grace. How were you a recipient? How did
[6:44] you grasp that salvation? By grace.
[6:47] Through faith.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; Galatians chapter 3:22. The scripture
[6:51] hath concluded all under sin that the
[6:54] promise by the faith of Jesus Christ.
[6:58] So then all are under sin that it is not
[7:00] of ourselves that the promise by faith
[7:04] of Jesus Christ. How is the promise
[7:06] apprehended? How do we receive it? By
[7:08] the faith of Jesus Christ might be given
[7:09] to them that believe.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; So there's this other element. It's by
[7:14] the faith of Jesus Christ and it's given
[7:15] to them not them that are ambivalent.
[7:19] Sometimes this is where we begin to
[7:20] wrestle well if it's election if it's
[7:22] faith if it's of God then what part do I
[7:25] play except perhaps just going numb and
[7:27] and mindblank and then something
[7:28] happening but I believe there is a
[7:30] conscious even an intellectual component
[7:33] where you have to accept Christ and make
[7:36] a decision even if it's in your mind
[7:39] against everything else that's fighting
[7:41] and waring you well how do you know how
[7:42] do you know that in your mind you just
[7:44] say I I'm making my choice I'm making my
[7:47] decision So there's faith of Jesus
[7:50] Christ that allows us to partake in
[7:52] these promises. So it's a faith that's
[7:54] only by Jesus Christ. In Philippians
[7:56] chapter 3:9, he says, "And be found in
[7:58] him, not having mine own righteousness."
[8:01] This is where we see that we're all
[8:02] under sin and it's not of ourselves. So
[8:05] it's not our own righteousness which is
[8:07] of the law which believe it or not a lot
[8:09] of us have produced by being really good
[8:12] church kids raised in a good home raised
[8:15] believe in the Bible believe in the
[8:16] message and we do as best as we can but
[8:18] that would be our own righteousness but
[8:20] the righteousness that which is through
[8:22] the faith of Christ the righteousness
[8:25] which is of God by faith. So this faith
[8:28] is the faith that Jesus Christ has given
[8:31] the believer again not just in him but
[8:34] of him the faith of Christ so that it
[8:38] produces the righteousness which is of
[8:40] God and again the writer saying by faith
[8:44] so there's a there's this uh
[8:45] undergirling this theme fa faith faith
[8:48] faith that's what that's the keyynote to
[8:50] the key that's the that's the the the uh
[8:54] in the Bible I think it's Paul that may
[8:56] say it or James it says the holding In
[8:57] fact, the mystery of the faith in a
[8:59] clean conscience. Maybe it's James. So,
[9:01] there's this mystery to the faith.
[9:02] What's the mystery to the faith? You
[9:03] can't see it, taste it, smell it, hear
[9:05] it. You can't imagine it.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; You can't just love it.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; You can't There there's a there's a
[9:11] certain thing to where faith itself is
[9:12] evidence. Fa faith is something that's
[9:15] just there. It's a theme.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; And so, with that in mind, I'd like to
[9:19] turn to John, if we could together, turn
[9:21] to John chapter 6. I'm going to be
[9:23] reading, Lord willing, verses 22 to 71.
[9:25] So I would like to cover this chapter in
[9:28] somewhat detail. Um there's maybe a lot
[9:31] of different ways we could have walked
[9:33] through this particular principle of the
[9:35] magnum opus and we could have done it uh
[9:39] different ways but God just inspired it
[9:41] to me this way. So it's going to feel
[9:43] like a a teaching through these
[9:45] particular verses. So stay with me. Uh
[9:47] it's going to be a lot of Bible reading.
[9:49] The day following, when the people which
[9:50] stood on the other side of the sea, the
[9:52] day following the miracles of the loaves
[9:54] and fishes, saw that there was none
[9:56] other boat there, save that one wherein
[9:59] to his disciples were entered, and that
[10:01] Jesus went not with his disciples into
[10:03] the boat, but that his disciples were
[10:05] gone away alone. Could you imagine, you
[10:09] know, if you're saying like you had
[10:10] this, it reads almost as if John had a
[10:13] word limit that he was trying to get to,
[10:15] right? He's just telling us everything.
[10:16] What was the atmospheric pressure that
[10:18] day? you know, and it's like, but this
[10:19] these things are all necessary because
[10:21] he's saying there was no other boat
[10:22] there, but the ones that the disciples
[10:25] took and they knew that Jesus wasn't
[10:27] with the disciples in the boat. And then
[10:28] the next verse kind of tells us, how be
[10:30] it there came other boats from Tiberius
[10:32] n under the place. And so they're saying
[10:34] that there were other boats there, but
[10:36] they knew these boats had come after the
[10:38] fact. So there was all these boats that
[10:40] the disciples leave in. That was the way
[10:42] across the sea, and Jesus didn't go
[10:44] across the sea with them. And now they
[10:46] see these other boats back and Jesus is
[10:48] so they're still there. So Jesus
[10:50] couldn't have left with those and he's
[10:52] deliberate in saying where they did eat
[10:54] bread. This is the miracle after that
[10:57] the Lord had given thanks. So it's
[10:58] wanting you to set the scene. When the
[11:00] people therefore saw that Jesus was not
[11:03] there neither his disciples, they also
[11:06] took shipping. This is the earliest uh
[11:08] reference to logistics and UPS and
[11:10] Amazon. They also took shipping and came
[11:13] to Capernaum seeking for Jesus. Now that
[11:18] sounds really good. Sets the scene. He
[11:21] has just performed these miracles. This
[11:23] eye detention sign something that gets
[11:25] your attention. And whatever the reason
[11:29] that they're seeking, as we get into
[11:30] this later, they were at least seeking.
[11:33] They're looking. They're wanting to find
[11:35] Christ. This is a worthy endeavor.
[11:37] Something's provoking them. let us go
[11:39] out and search for this Christ who we
[11:41] believe to be the truth which we know
[11:43] now to be the way and the life. So
[11:45] they're seeking what would be the right
[11:46] thing even if they don't know what it is
[11:48] yet. Deuteronomy 4 29 it says but if it
[11:52] if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord
[11:55] thy God thou shalt find him if thou seek
[11:58] him with all thy heart and with all thy
[12:00] soul. A similar principle is expressed
[12:03] in the book of Jeremiah where if you
[12:05] seek me with your whole heart, you'll
[12:07] find me. So this is a very beautiful
[12:10] principle that those that seek God, he
[12:13] will be found. And the qualifier is if
[12:15] you seek him with all your heart and
[12:17] with all your soul. I believe I think
[12:20] that we could read this to say that if
[12:22] you truly have sought God with all your
[12:24] heart and all your soul, you will find
[12:26] him. Amen.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; So then if you are seeking God and you
[12:29] don't find him, the the the the onus
[12:31] doesn't switch to Jesus or God, it's
[12:34] still on you as to whether or not you've
[12:36] sought with all your heart and all your
[12:39] soul.
[12:41] Says in Matthew 7 7 to8, "Ask and it
[12:45] shall be given you. Seek and ye shall
[12:47] find. Knock and it shall be opened unto
[12:50] you. For everyone that askketh
[12:52] receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth,
[12:54] and to him that knockketh it shall be
[12:55] opened.
[12:57] These are, this is a promise of Jesus
[12:59] Christ. Let's just take it very literal.
[13:01] If you just heard a man say, "Ask and it
[13:04] shall be given you." And if you wanted
[13:06] to test him whether or not his words are
[13:08] right, you would just ask.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; And if you don't get it, then that man's
[13:13] a liar.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Because he just said, "Ask.
[13:17] Seek and you shall find. Knock and it
[13:18] shall be open. and everyone that askketh
[13:20] receive it. But here we can see this
[13:22] principle. Then he that seeks will find.
[13:24] He that seeketh findeth. He that
[13:26] knockketh the door is open. This is a
[13:28] promise of Jesus Christ. So as they
[13:30] leave here in John 6 24 uh when they
[13:33] took shipping they're seeking for Jesus.
[13:36] In verse 25 it says, "And when they
[13:37] found him on the other side of the sea,
[13:40] they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest
[13:44] thou hither?"
[13:46] In other words, they were astonished
[13:47] that he made it when he did because as
[13:51] the scripture has already told us and
[13:53] John in great detail has said, "Well,
[13:55] these boats left already with the
[13:56] disciples." They knew that Jesus was not
[13:58] on that boat. They knew all the boats
[14:00] that had returned were people coming
[14:01] from the other direction. And so, the
[14:03] only way that Jesus could have got to
[14:05] where he was in their minds, the only
[14:07] way is if he traveled by land all the
[14:09] way around and they're saying, "Whoa,
[14:12] hold on. It's way too early for you to
[14:14] be here. if you traveled by land. So
[14:17] immediately they're just they're
[14:18] questioning how he did it. How did you
[14:21] get here? There's some maybe uh if we
[14:24] could say some uh kind of like when
[14:26] someone says you told me you left at
[14:28] 10:00 and you're here at 10:30. I live
[14:30] an hour away. And there's this
[14:32] implication you were speeding,
[14:36] right? Pred premeditated
[14:38] murder. And that's the way it's going to
[14:41] take an hour for your angel to catch up.
[14:44] Right? There's this questioning of how
[14:46] it happened just because of logistics
[14:47] and then you say, "Oh, didn't you know
[14:49] they opened up that new bypass?" You're
[14:51] like, "Oh, a tiki dobeck, right? Didn't
[14:54] mean to falsely accuse you." But there
[14:55] is some kind of how did you get here?
[14:57] This astonishment and amazement as to
[14:59] how he was able to get there. Now, could
[15:01] have you imagine if he said, "Oh, I
[15:02] walked on water. That's it." Right?
[15:06] You're out of here. That would have been
[15:08] the end. Even though they would have
[15:09] seen the walking on water, but you can
[15:10] see where their attitude is. That would
[15:12] have been probably enough for them.
[15:14] Verse 26, Jesus answered them and said,
[15:16] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, you
[15:18] seek me." True.
[15:21] Not because you saw the miracles, but
[15:24] because you did eat of the loaves and
[15:26] were filled. We could say that there was
[15:29] a It wasn't the whole heart.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; Was it the whole soul that they were
[15:35] seeking after or was it just the whole
[15:37] tummy?
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Was it their gut? Was it their stomach?
[15:40] I I put have Jesus expose their search
[15:42] history, right? He he he had he had
[15:46] their Google history to know I know what
[15:48] you've been searching. How can I
[15:50] monetize unlimited bread?
[15:53] &gt;&gt; There was something more to the dynamics
[15:55] taking place such that he was saying
[15:58] what is it that you're seeking? What
[16:01] were you coming for? And so very
[16:03] shallow, very surfacy. Didn't get very
[16:06] deep with them. the miracles did not
[16:07] have a a deeper resonance than the
[16:09] fleshly appetites and maybe the things
[16:11] that they were perceiving.
[16:13] He says, "You sought me because of the
[16:15] miracles."
[16:17] And that's true. But if I could say it
[16:20] this way, they sought him only for the
[16:23] miracles.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, there's maybe not a
[16:27] deeper inquiry there. It's, well, let's
[16:30] just prove if he can keep doing this.
[16:32] Let's see if we can find how he did it.
[16:35] Let's see. I I I this is something in
[16:37] here that if I could come if I could be
[16:39] satisfied with this realm, you know, and
[16:41] this is true, then I I don't mind
[16:44] revisiting this over and over and over
[16:46] again. But the reality was they didn't
[16:48] seek him because of the miracles or he
[16:50] says you saw the miracles, but you
[16:53] sought me only for the miracles because
[16:55] miracles and signs and even these things
[16:57] that demonstrated a supernatural power
[16:59] didn't resonate any further than what it
[17:01] could do for your mind and body.
[17:04] So the main concern and this is very
[17:07] important for you to to think about
[17:09] their main concern was worldly
[17:11] advantage.
[17:13] This and I'm not I'm not wanting us to
[17:15] become experts on the attitude of the
[17:17] Jews back in that in that time period. I
[17:19] want you to recognize right now, even in
[17:21] your own human instinct, there's a way
[17:23] that you wrestle things out with God,
[17:25] with the word, and even with Christ to
[17:27] where there's some part of you that's
[17:28] seeking worldly advantage or is
[17:31] reluctant to let go of what you perceive
[17:34] to be an advantage in the world to
[17:36] follow Christ,
[17:38] &gt;&gt; whether it be the way you look or the
[17:39] things you can do, all sorts of things
[17:41] that are going to be waring within your
[17:42] spirit. And so they sought him or their
[17:45] concern was worldly advantage whether it
[17:47] was social or economic or some political
[17:50] benefit.
[17:51] Could you imagine if at church every
[17:53] time you came to church and I'm not
[17:55] saying it's not true but every time you
[17:57] came to church and you came the right
[17:59] way that there was just all of a sudden
[18:02] $100,000
[18:03] uh deposited into your Bitcoin wallet.
[18:07] And some of you know right now
[18:10] we know who's been searching with their
[18:12] whole heart. my whole mind. No. If that
[18:14] was true, you wouldn't miss a service
[18:17] &gt;&gt; because you'd immediately recognize this
[18:19] worldly advantage to doing it.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Where do you live? I live in Chicago.
[18:24] Where do you go to church? Arizona
[18:25] believers church. I get on a plane every
[18:27] Saturday night and I fly p my private
[18:29] jet. I'm there on Sunday mornings
[18:30] because I get one bitcoin every time I'm
[18:32] there. Right?
[18:34] &gt;&gt; And why would you do it? World
[18:35] advantage. Right.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; So, there's something at play here when
[18:39] they begin to look into this and they're
[18:41] seeking it and they're pursuing it and
[18:42] there's there's this journey across the
[18:44] sea likewise to find Jesus and they're
[18:46] seeking Jesus. And immediately Jesus
[18:48] exposes something. So, he says in verse
[18:51] 27, labor not for the meat which
[18:53] perisheth, that would be that bread, but
[18:55] for that meat which endureth unto
[18:57] everlasting life. We read this without
[19:00] mere without even a stumble or wait
[19:02] what? We don't even go back. But he's
[19:04] saying, "Labor not for the food, the
[19:05] bread, the meat, the sustenance that
[19:07] feeds the flesh, but labor for the meat
[19:09] which endureth and perseveres eternally
[19:12] and causes you to live forever."
[19:15] And when we hear that Pon Deleon or
[19:17] whoever it was uh uh you know sailed to
[19:19] Flida and and tried to find the fountain
[19:22] of youth, we find out when he gets there
[19:24] and there we're thinking that guy's
[19:26] insane. There is no such thing as a
[19:27] fountain of youth. But Jesus prophesies
[19:29] of one.
[19:31] And he says, "Which the son of man shall
[19:33] give unto you." Now, there's only one
[19:35] source, the son of man. Talk about a
[19:38] hard pill to swallow. For him hath God
[19:41] the father sealed. And this has
[19:42] something to do with God identifying
[19:44] himself. I believe in John 3 that
[19:46] identifying God seals him. So the real
[19:49] challenge is to their motives. You say,
[19:51] "Well, that's a good thing, but what's
[19:52] your motive and what's your objective?"
[19:54] It's kind of digging into probing what
[19:57] their state of mind was when they were
[19:59] seeking. What were they trying to find?
[20:02] Were they just trying to find food? Were
[20:04] they trying to find uh uh you know
[20:08] vindication? Were what were they what
[20:09] were they looking for? I I I'm just
[20:12] maybe trying to think of it in a broader
[20:13] way so you can begin to think of how
[20:15] Jesus challenged it. Don't labor for
[20:17] natural things and carnal things and
[20:19] things that are just facts or things
[20:21] that are just fiction or things that'll
[20:22] just perish or come and go. What are you
[20:24] truly seeking?
[20:26] And so in verse 28, then said they unto
[20:29] him, and this to me is such a
[20:32] um
[20:34] I I'm reading it differently than I ever
[20:36] have before. I'll say that this is on
[20:38] me. Then said they unto him, "What shall
[20:40] we do that we might work the works of
[20:44] God?"
[20:45] Now, it's not till late as of late that
[20:49] I and when I say as of late, I don't
[20:50] mean this morning, but last week that
[20:53] this scripture finally clicked that when
[20:55] they said, "What what shall we do that
[20:57] we might work?" That it is in some ways
[21:00] responsive, if not directly responsive
[21:01] to him saying, "Labor,
[21:04] &gt;&gt; labor for meat from heaven. Labor for
[21:07] the meat that the son of man will give
[21:08] you." So they ask what shall we do that
[21:12] we might work the works of God that
[21:14] erosomi let what may we work which is to
[21:17] do to perform to cause to exist to
[21:19] produce what shall we work to uh produce
[21:23] the arggon to work the works the arrog
[21:27] to the arggon those are just the uh the
[21:30] Greek words and that's anything
[21:31] accomplished by hand or art or industry
[21:34] or mind what can we do to work the works
[21:39] Or if we could say what can we do to to
[21:41] to to produce that product of God
[21:45] and it does it seem to me it seems
[21:47] responsive to Christ's instruction to
[21:49] labor for meat but even in this question
[21:52] there's something missing because they
[21:54] are overtly seeking approval of God.
[21:58] What can we do to work the works of God?
[22:01] Notice how quickly it's almost as if
[22:03] they bypass the son of man. And this is
[22:05] how clever the devil is. You could say,
[22:07] "Well, uh, this is the truth. This is
[22:09] the truth." And then they just want to
[22:10] slip right past the truth and say,
[22:12] "Well, I just want to know God in a
[22:14] personal way." As if to say that truth
[22:15] doesn't matter anymore.
[22:18] So, this is just how slick the devil is.
[22:19] He almost bypasses Christ, the son of
[22:22] man. And so, they're not truly seeking
[22:24] the son of man to receive what he gives.
[22:27] They're putting themselves on the same
[22:29] level as the son of man because they've
[22:31] seen these wonderful works that Christ
[22:33] has done. And now they say, "Well, what
[22:35] can we do to work the works of God? Cuz
[22:38] I I if you're laboring for the Father,
[22:41] let me equally and likewise labor for
[22:43] the Father and let me do the works that
[22:44] pleases him since you claim you're doing
[22:46] the pleasing." And there's no submission
[22:47] to the Son of Man
[22:50] that had the bread that they that he
[22:52] says they should be fighting for.
[22:55] Are you following me?
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Verse 29. Jesus answered and said unto
[22:58] them, "This is the work of God." If
[23:03] you're taking notes, now's the time to
[23:04] do it. If you're not taking notes,
[23:06] probably now is not a good time to
[23:07] start. But it's a good practice. This is
[23:10] the work of God that you believe on him
[23:12] whom he hath sent. This is the arggon.
[23:15] Anything accomplished by God's hand, by
[23:17] God's art or industry or God's mind,
[23:19] this is the product of God that you
[23:23] believe on him whom he hath sent.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; So let me say this is the work that
[23:27] pleases God.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; To believe on him that God sends.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:34] And we could say ultimately primarily
[23:37] most importantly Christ.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; So in Hebrews 11:6, but without faith it
[23:44] is impossible to please him. For he that
[23:46] cometh to God must believe that he is.
[23:48] So here's that seeking the searching.
[23:50] Faith is necessary to please God. And in
[23:53] this searching, he is a rewarder of them
[23:55] that diligently seek him. There's the
[23:58] qualification of the seeking. There's
[24:00] the qualification. You know whenever you
[24:02] you all every single one of you uh use
[24:04] this chat GPT there's a maybe drop down
[24:07] menu and you can choose quick answer all
[24:09] of you use the quick right you want it
[24:12] fast I want to be on engine five I want
[24:14] to get it fast I want to know the answer
[24:16] right away none of you are using the
[24:17] deeper or whatever else it is you use
[24:19] maybe if you're using co-pilot which is
[24:21] all what the cool people use and you're
[24:23] not saying I'll wait 30 minutes to find
[24:25] out an answer right because none of us
[24:27] want to really be that diligent
[24:31] But he's saying that diligently seek
[24:32] him.
[24:35] It takes faith to do this. It takes that
[24:37] diligent searching in your heart.
[24:40] Now, I want to emphasize this. I'm not
[24:43] changing meaning. I'm not trying to turn
[24:44] this around, but let's read it exactly
[24:47] the way he said it. This is the work of
[24:49] God. The work of God is you believe on
[24:54] the one he sends.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; This is God's product
[25:00] &gt;&gt; when you believe
[25:02] &gt;&gt; on Jesus Christ.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Do you catch that?
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; He's not saying it in the sense that you
[25:09] what can we do to work the works of
[25:11] Christ? And so now I'm going to work
[25:14] something for Christ and that's going to
[25:17] be a work that pleases God. but rather
[25:20] the work of God is if you want to see
[25:22] the work of God in your life is when you
[25:25] believe on him that he has sent.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; That's God working in your life.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; I know we want to see it in a lot of
[25:32] other ways, but so help me. I I want to
[25:35] see God working to where I can I can
[25:38] invest a early on the early stages in a
[25:42] a meme coin right at the outset and I
[25:45] become one of the future wells.
[25:48] That's going to be that's God working in
[25:49] my life is when I get ahead of the
[25:51] system and I make the right call on
[25:53] Tesla stock that's going to be the real
[25:55] miracle. No, the miracle of God is not
[25:57] the house and not the all these other
[25:59] things. The miracle of God is when I can
[26:01] just simply believe
[26:04] &gt;&gt; his word.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; This is the magnum opus.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; A magnum opus in art is a great or
[26:14] important work.
[26:16] The magnum opus is the greatest
[26:18] achievement of an artist. Some could
[26:21] argue this with respect to different
[26:22] ones. Say, well, Beethoven's ninth,
[26:24] that's his magnum opus. And some say,
[26:27] well, Van Go uh Van Go's starry night,
[26:30] that's the that's his magnum opus. And
[26:32] we identify it with something that is
[26:34] their greatest accomplishment,
[26:37] something that would be that single most
[26:40] identifiable work that they have
[26:41] produced.
[26:44] And I'm saying to you today, the work of
[26:48] God is when you believe.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; And that's the magnum opus. Now, when he
[26:54] says the work of God is that you believe
[26:56] on him who he has sent, I would think
[26:58] that on some level they have thought,
[27:00] okay, you've come from the father. You
[27:03] want us to believe in you. And so they
[27:04] said unto him, therefore, what sign
[27:06] showest thou then?
[27:09] This is verse verse 30. What sign
[27:12] showest thou then? that we may see and
[27:16] believe thee. So now, who who is the the
[27:20] who's the onus being put back on? Once
[27:21] again, it's on Christ.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; You prove to me. You show me. Do do
[27:27] something more to convince me to
[27:29] believe. And he says, and then our
[27:31] fathers did eat mana in the desert. As
[27:33] it is written, he gave them bread from
[27:35] heaven to eat. So, they're still wanting
[27:36] something now in the moment, visible,
[27:38] provable, carnal, tangible, however you
[27:40] want to look at it, but they're wanting
[27:42] something more.
[27:44] And think of this. Why were they there?
[27:48] Why did they travel across the ocean or
[27:50] excuse me, not the ocean? Surprise. They
[27:52] were in Pasadena. No, they um Why did
[27:54] they travel across the sea
[27:57] to see this to see him? To seek him the
[28:00] miracles.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; That's why they were around to begin
[28:03] with. They had already seen signs and
[28:06] miracles, but now what are they doing in
[28:09] retrospect? They're making light of them
[28:12] cuz now they're saying, "Well,
[28:16] what's a bunch of loaves and fishes,
[28:18] right? Moses gave us bread from heaven."
[28:22] And no doubt they could have said, "And
[28:23] he gave us quail." And I've never been
[28:24] much of a pescatarian anyways. I
[28:26] preferred the quail.
[28:28] So, there's already going back and
[28:29] trying to qualify and making light of
[28:31] what Jesus said because it's like, well,
[28:33] what more can you do? Because now that
[28:36] we're looking at it and we're going back
[28:38] and combing through these things and
[28:39] you're kind of starting to challenge us
[28:40] a little bit. We're getting
[28:41] uncomfortable. So, now we kind of want
[28:42] to downplay why we're here to begin with
[28:45] is what more can you do than Moses?
[28:49] In Matthew 12:es 38-39, then certain of
[28:52] the scribes and the Pharisees answered
[28:54] saying, "Master, we would see a sign
[28:56] from thee."
[28:58] It's in our family. We've been
[29:00] discussing as of late the uh certain um
[29:03] strategies and arguments and fallacies
[29:06] and and one that is come up quite a bit
[29:08] is well, you can't prove me wrong.
[29:11] And it's like, well, game over, I guess.
[29:15] Uh but here they're saying, you know,
[29:17] show us a sign from thee. But he
[29:20] answered and said unto them, an evil and
[29:21] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[29:24] sign.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; An evil and adulterous generation
[29:27] seeketh after a sign.
[29:31] Now that's that's hard language,
[29:33] especially when he's saying he's he's
[29:36] using them as this litmus test for the
[29:38] whole generation. Evil and adulterous,
[29:40] faithless,
[29:42] &gt;&gt; unfaithful,
[29:44] &gt;&gt; evil and adulterous generation, they
[29:45] seeketh after a sign. So let's go back
[29:47] to the idea of seeking. They were
[29:49] seeking after Jesus. No, they weren't
[29:51] seeking after Jesus. They were seeking
[29:53] for something ancillary. They were
[29:55] seeking something beyond Jesus because
[29:56] they find him. And now they start having
[29:58] all these qualifications.
[30:00] They have all these other things that
[30:01] start coming into the picture to cloud
[30:03] their view. And so he's saying, "No, you
[30:05] seek after a sign. You're not truly
[30:06] seeking the heart of God, the mind of
[30:08] God and truth, or to get to the bottom
[30:10] of the truth of what's being said. You
[30:11] want a sign. And he says, and he gives
[30:13] them the sign. There shall be no sign
[30:14] given to thee, but the sign of the
[30:16] prophet Jonas.
[30:18] We could say then they're not actually
[30:20] seeking God, but some proof or
[30:21] verification.
[30:24] That something is of God.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Seeking with their mind, not the heart.
[30:30] Maybe seeking on some level. and they're
[30:34] kind of hung up in the si sign part
[30:36] aspect of it.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Our fathers ate. Show us a sign just
[30:41] like those Pharisees and scribes. So
[30:43] verse 32, then Jesus said unto them,
[30:45] verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses
[30:47] gave you not that bread from heaven.
[30:49] Stop. Wait a minute. Hold on.
[30:54] Did he or did he not?
[30:56] Sounds like Jesus is now saying that
[30:59] Moses was wrong or that they're that
[31:01] they're lying and that maybe it wasn't
[31:02] bread from heaven. But we know the Bible
[31:04] said bread from heaven, but Jesus
[31:05] saying, "No, he gave you not that bread
[31:07] from heaven." He's wanting them to focus
[31:09] now. Yeah, I may have multiplied bread
[31:13] in an act of creation or multiplication.
[31:16] And this was supernatural. And yes,
[31:18] Moses gave you bread from heaven, but
[31:19] I'm not talking about that bread.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; It's kind of what he chided the his
[31:23] disciples for. Beware of the leavenven
[31:25] of the scribes and Pharisees. And all of
[31:26] a sudden, they looked at the Roman meal
[31:27] loaf, right?
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Like the leavenven of Herod. You bought
[31:31] the wrong bread. You're supposed to buy
[31:32] Davey's Crazy Bread or whatever it's
[31:33] called, right? I need at least 12 seeds
[31:35] in this. I'm not going to eat that
[31:38] stuff. Do you not do you not know that
[31:40] gluten's of the devil? Right? You know,
[31:42] I didn't know. Was it grass-fed corn? I
[31:44] don't know. So, there's a but he's
[31:47] chiding them once again for how shallow
[31:49] their understanding was. He says, "But
[31:52] my father giveth you the true bread from
[31:54] heaven." What did he already tell us?
[31:55] The son of man will give it to you.
[31:59] But now he's saying it's the father that
[32:00] gives it. But still, there's only one
[32:01] way to receive it, through the Son of
[32:03] Man. But my father giveth you the true
[32:04] bread from heaven, the true bread, not
[32:06] just bread from heaven. For the bread of
[32:07] God, which he is, he which cometh down
[32:10] from heaven,
[32:12] &gt;&gt; and giveth life unto the world. Why does
[32:14] he make it so hard? Jesus Christ, why do
[32:17] you make it so hard?
[32:20] Why do you have to say it this way?
[32:23] Why don't you just take more time and
[32:24] kind of explain this? Give him the full
[32:26] story and the background. Why does it
[32:27] have to seem so in your face? Then said
[32:30] they unto him,"Lord, evermore, give us
[32:33] this bread." This is their response. And
[32:37] in the trajectory of things, if we
[32:38] didn't know better, we might be
[32:39] thinking, well, this seems to be
[32:40] unfolding well. These back and forth,
[32:42] the questionings, the answers, the
[32:44] seeking, it's all unfolding good. And so
[32:46] now there's this moment where it's like,
[32:48] that's what I want. I want this bread.
[32:51] I'm sincere. It's this moment where I'm
[32:53] wanting it and I'm willing. My heart is
[32:55] open. Give me this bread. But there is
[32:58] still an element missing in John chapter
[33:01] 4 when we see the woman at the well and
[33:02] Jesus begins to talk to her and contact
[33:04] her spirit and tell her things about her
[33:07] that other people didn't know or that he
[33:09] or he wasn't supposed to know. So almost
[33:11] like he's a diver or something. He's
[33:13] reading her mind and he's going to be
[33:14] sharing these things with her. But
[33:16] before he gets there and her heart turns
[33:18] and she says, "I perceive you're a
[33:19] prophet." And she runs into the city
[33:21] saying, "Come see a man who's told me
[33:23] everything I was." Before that, in verse
[33:25] 14, Jesus says, "But whatso whosoever
[33:27] drinkkeeth of the water that I shall
[33:29] give him shall never thirst." So now he
[33:30] has a water that's not the natural
[33:32] water.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; You came to draw from a natural well to
[33:35] get natural water from natural things. I
[33:37] have a water which is not natural. It's
[33:38] supernatural.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; So she knows in that way. She should
[33:41] know. But the water that I shall give
[33:43] you shall be in him a well of water
[33:45] springing up into everlasting life.
[33:47] Notice the symmetry to the bread which
[33:49] tends to everlasting life. And now the
[33:50] water which tends to everlasting life.
[33:52] and the symmetry of her response. The
[33:54] woman saith to him, "Sir, give me this
[33:57] water that I thirst not, neither come
[33:59] hither to draw." But yet we know
[34:01] according to scripture, her perspective
[34:03] was still carnal.
[34:05] Just as those in John chapter 6, yes,
[34:08] give me this water. I want that water. I
[34:11] want that bread. Well, do you know what
[34:13] you're asking for? I
[34:15] &gt;&gt; mean, how many times have we had that
[34:16] happen? You know, how hot do you want
[34:18] that? Well, what's the scale? 1 to 10.
[34:20] Well, I'll take a 12 then. Do you know
[34:23] what you're asking for? Yeah, I've had a
[34:25] hot pepper before. Right. And and it's
[34:28] like there's a there's a certain measure
[34:29] of are you really serious about this?
[34:34] &gt;&gt; So, they were either serious about
[34:37] literal bread
[34:39] or maybe derisive because they didn't
[34:41] believe that kind of bread existed.
[34:43] Even the woman at the well, it says,
[34:45] "Well, give me this water that I never
[34:47] thirst again."
[34:49] Is it this, you know, give us, Lord,
[34:51] give us this bread?
[34:54] Either they believed it in a literal
[34:55] sense or they're kind of like, yeah,
[34:58] give it, give us this bread from heaven,
[35:00] rabbi. And whatever the reason, it was
[35:04] born from ignorance of what he said.
[35:07] They're not understanding what he said.
[35:08] Would you agree?
[35:10] &gt;&gt; They're not understanding what he said.
[35:11] And there was some
[35:14] sensuality for what he was providing,
[35:16] some taste, some appetite for what he
[35:18] could give them naturally or maybe even
[35:21] vain desire, that vanity, the pride,
[35:24] whatever it is that's motivating them.
[35:25] We could come back and we're maybe
[35:27] backing into this, but it's not whole
[35:29] heart. It's not whole mind. It's not
[35:30] sincere seeking Jesus Christ. There's a
[35:32] lot of other things that are coming into
[35:34] the picture. Oh, give us this bread. And
[35:36] it's it has a a tone of they don't
[35:39] understand or they're asking for other
[35:42] reasons or that still that idea of
[35:44] worldly advantage. So Jesus says in
[35:46] verse 35, I am the bread of life.
[35:51] How come they don't say, "Lord, you are
[35:53] that bread?" How come they're not saying
[35:55] that we believe you or that? How come
[35:57] they're not resonating back and echoing
[35:59] what he said? Remember that they still
[36:02] profess that they want it, but they're
[36:05] not even able to tell him what it is
[36:06] they want.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; They're not even able to mirror what
[36:09] he's offering.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; It's almost as if he's saying, "I give
[36:13] you bread." And they're saying, "Lord,
[36:15] give us the stone.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; It's not that what they're responding
[36:19] with isn't matching." So he says, "I am
[36:21] the bread of life. He that cometh to me
[36:25] shall never hunger."
[36:27] &gt;&gt; What does the Bible tell us? They didn't
[36:28] want to go to him.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; They wanted the bread. They wanted they
[36:34] they they were seeking something, but
[36:36] they don't want to go through God's
[36:37] provided way to get it.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; So, they can still be on they can still
[36:42] be on the lookout for it, right? I'm
[36:44] going to visit a new restaurant that's
[36:45] supposed to have really good hamburgers
[36:46] because I'm looking for the best burger
[36:49] in the valley. And you don't take my
[36:50] word for it where it is. You're curious
[36:53] now, aren't you? So, there's a way
[36:55] though where you just don't want to take
[36:56] it from the experts. You don't want to
[36:58] just take it from the source. You don't
[36:59] want to take it for the one that's
[37:01] telling you about the bread. You don't
[37:03] You want to bypass it.
[37:08] Uh,
[37:09] I'll save that for later.
[37:16] He that cometh to me shall never hunger.
[37:19] He that believeth on me shall never
[37:21] thirst.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; This is this is the truth.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; If you want to have that bread, you got
[37:26] to believe on him. If you want to have
[37:27] that water, you got to believe on him.
[37:28] Verse 36, but I said unto you that ye
[37:32] also have seen me and believe not.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; They had already seen it.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; The thing that they're asking for, they
[37:40] had already seen.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; The thing that they're desiring was
[37:44] already made manifest. Sir, give me this
[37:46] water. Lord, evermore, give me this
[37:48] bread. Show us the sign. And he's
[37:50] saying, you've already seen me, but you
[37:53] do not believe.
[37:55] They had heard with their ears. They had
[37:57] seen with their eyes the key, the
[38:00] masterpiece, the perfect son of God.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; But the magnum opus was not rotten them.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; They had seen the key and the
[38:09] masterpiece, but there was not they it
[38:12] did not echo back with a master stroke.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; There's the key, but nothing was
[38:19] resonating back to say that fits the
[38:21] hole in my heart.
[38:24] that unlocks my desire, that satisfies
[38:27] what's missing.
[38:31] He says, you you see, but you don't
[38:33] believe. In Proverbsap 14:6,
[38:36] a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it
[38:39] not.
[38:41] Really, really, really lean in on this.
[38:43] Think about this. The scorner seeks
[38:44] wisdom, seeks truth, seek seeks God,
[38:48] seeks after Christ, but never finds it.
[38:50] But knowledge is easy unto him that
[38:52] understandeth.
[38:54] You know what the scorner is in the
[38:55] scripture? It's a critic.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; The one that's characterized by mockery.
[39:01] They're flawinders.
[39:03] We're looking at the flaw paradox.
[39:05] They're the ones that are fixating on on
[39:07] um uh things that don't make sense.
[39:09] They're they're they're not truly
[39:11] seeking.
[39:14] That's a real litmus test for anything
[39:16] that you're feeding on.
[39:19] What's this nature behind it?
[39:20] Skepticism.
[39:22] fear, hatred, bitterness, animosity.
[39:26] I maybe I should take my own advice.
[39:28] When I'm searching for something and
[39:30] looking for a product to buy, I only
[39:31] read the one-star reviews.
[39:34] Maybe I'm learning something today cuz I
[39:37] kind of want to know what does everybody
[39:38] hate about it, you know, what's the
[39:40] problem, you know, cuz all the five star
[39:43] reviews are in Chinese. So, I I want to
[39:45] find out, you know, what are the one
[39:46] stars having to say about it? And and
[39:49] that way I could find if I read a bunch
[39:50] of fivestar reviews and they're just
[39:52] ranting about the fact that they closed
[39:54] five minutes before closing time, then I
[39:55] know they probably have good food. This
[39:57] guy's just upset because he picked the
[39:59] wrong place to eat, right? Or this guy
[40:01] just kind of always has a bone to pick.
[40:03] You know, something along those lines. I
[40:04] don't know. I'm just saying that's not
[40:06] relevant. Read the reviews. You see a
[40:07] Yelp restaurant that's got 40,000
[40:09] reviews and all 40,000 are five stars.
[40:12] It might be because of the draft beer in
[40:14] the porch,
[40:16] right? and you show up and it's nothing
[40:17] but a honky tonk asking for your ID when
[40:19] you walk in. A lot of times there's
[40:21] reasons why it is that way and it's not
[40:23] always what the reviews you think they
[40:24] are. So, I digress. I'm back to what I
[40:26] was saying that when you find somebody
[40:27] that's a scorner, they don't know truth
[40:30] because they can never find it and they
[40:31] can't be your source for it.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; They can only be your source for scorn,
[40:36] mockery, negativity, derision,
[40:39] &gt;&gt; animosity, bitterness.
[40:43] They can only point you out to the
[40:45] things that hurt, but never to the
[40:46] things that heal
[40:48] &gt;&gt; because they're a scorner.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 15:14, "The heart of him that
[40:55] hath understanding seeketh knowledge."
[40:58] Think of just how rich this is. But the
[41:00] mouth of fools feedth on foolishness.
[41:04] There's a much richer character you can
[41:06] gather than from the scripture here in
[41:08] even John 6. Because what were they
[41:10] doing? the mouth of fools were feeding
[41:12] on foolishness.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; It's foolish questions. There's
[41:15] dishonesty. There's deceit. There's
[41:17] fraud. The rudiments of this world.
[41:19] Someone who has a heart of him that
[41:20] understands actually seeks knowledge.
[41:23] The one here in the scripture actually
[41:25] understand what Christ was saying would
[41:26] begin to seek the son of man would begin
[41:28] to seek that bread and seek that truth.
[41:30] But the mouths of the fool still had a
[41:32] lot of questions. But they were foolish
[41:34] because what appetite did they have? for
[41:36] foolishness, for dishonesty, for lies,
[41:38] deceits, and frauds.
[41:44] A scorner seeks wisdom and cannot find
[41:46] it. The foolish feed on foolishness.
[41:51] So he says, "You did not believe me."
[41:54] So he says in verse 37 now, because you
[41:56] have all these people who witnessed the
[41:58] same miracle the day before and now you
[42:00] have the majority of them do not
[42:01] believe. So he says, "All that the
[42:03] father giveth me shall come to me. And
[42:05] him that cometh to me, I will in no wise
[42:07] cast him out."
[42:09] He says, "He that cometh to me, the
[42:11] bread of life, shall never thirst or
[42:13] hunger. He that believeth shall never
[42:14] thirst or hunger." So now he's saying,
[42:16] "All that the father hath given me will
[42:18] come. For I am come down from heaven,
[42:20] not to do my own will, but the will of
[42:22] him that sent me. And this is the
[42:25] father's will which hath sent me, that
[42:27] all of which he hath given me, I should
[42:29] lose nothing." So he won't lose any that
[42:31] are his
[42:32] &gt;&gt; but should raise it up again at the last
[42:34] day.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; No doubt there's,
[42:38] you know, some layers there to the ones
[42:40] he's speaking to. And this is the will
[42:43] of him that sent me. Remember, this is
[42:46] the work of God that you believe on him
[42:48] whom he hath sent. This is the will of
[42:50] the father. This is the will of God that
[42:52] everyone which seeth the son and
[42:53] believeth on him may have everlasting
[42:55] life, and I will raise him up at the
[42:57] last day. This is the will of God. This
[43:00] is the purpose of God that you see the
[43:02] son and believe and become heir to
[43:05] everlasting life and heir to a
[43:06] resurrection.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Seeing Christ in believing on him, this
[43:11] is God's will.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; The magnum opus we see in John chapter 6
[43:16] is this is the masterpiece of God. This
[43:19] is his master stroke. This is the
[43:21] keynote. This is the work of God. When
[43:23] you believe on the one that he sent, he
[43:25] sends his son. You see the sun and what
[43:27] do you do? You radiate back in faith.
[43:29] You believe. You resonate in the same
[43:31] intensity and the same wavelength. You
[43:34] wave. You You radiate back.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; But Frankie, I'm wishing I could
[43:38] remember that that measurement right
[43:40] now. That's mega. That's it. I'm
[43:41] resonating back to him.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; That's the magnumopus of God.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; When we see and believe,
[43:50] &gt;&gt; this is the will of God. In 2
[43:51] Corinthians chapter 5:7, for we walk by
[43:54] faith, not by sight. Amen.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible says before whatsoever is not
[43:57] of faith is sin.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; We are occupied, directed by, guided by
[44:02] faith. That assurance, that belief, that
[44:04] persuasion.
[44:06] It is a different sense.
[44:09] We walk by faith, not by sight. What is
[44:11] sight here? It's not the physical
[44:13] vision, but rather the superficial
[44:15] appearance of present things. In other
[44:16] words, how we perceive things, what
[44:19] seems apparent. On its face, it looks as
[44:22] if Jesus is belittling the works of
[44:24] Moses. On its face, it seems as if Jesus
[44:26] is doing this. On its face, he said, "We
[44:29] don't go by sight." God's faith is God's
[44:33] faith is greater
[44:36] &gt;&gt; than this reality based solely on human
[44:38] perception.
[44:41] Would not
[44:43] someone being sick,
[44:46] being anointed with oil, being prayed
[44:48] for, believing for their healing, would
[44:49] not them being sick on its face testify
[44:54] that God's a liar when he says, "Lay
[44:56] hands on the sick and they shall
[44:57] recover."
[44:59] You've never thought of that before. Did
[45:00] I just make a mistake? Everyone runs for
[45:02] the door at the same time. You all get
[45:04] stuck like at a cartoon, right? And the
[45:06] last person's just behind you trying to
[45:07] push you all out.
[45:11] This is
[45:13] this is this is the reality of the
[45:14] scripture.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; But we don't base our belief on what
[45:21] seems apparent.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; This faith we don't
[45:25] this faith is different from the
[45:27] subjective and objective uh reality of
[45:30] the world. And I say subjective, it's
[45:32] not what we believe according to our own
[45:34] subjective reality. So say well faith is
[45:37] not what we see what seems apparent to
[45:39] us subjectively. I want to go so far as
[45:41] to say it's not based upon this reality.
[45:43] Uh that's based upon this acceptance or
[45:45] acknowledgement of objective reality.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; You believe God's good and I believe
[45:50] God's good and yo you believe God's
[45:52] good. Okay then that we will accept that
[45:53] God's good. You're going to believe in
[45:56] the goodness of God apart from even your
[45:58] own subjective experience and objective
[46:00] experience.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; That's why some of you believe in what
[46:03] you believe in natural things. Contrary
[46:06] to how many five-star reviews there are,
[46:07] contrary how much brother Aaron touts
[46:09] some hamburger joint or whatever it is,
[46:11] you you just say, "No, my experience
[46:13] tells me otherwise."
[46:16] &gt;&gt; But this faith is not based upon that
[46:18] subjective experience or just this
[46:20] acceptance of an objective reality.
[46:22] Faith is based upon a reality beyond the
[46:25] range of any normal human experiences.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; It's beyond the range of merely physical
[46:35] human experience.
[46:38] I think there's it's two there's two
[46:40] sides to this.
[46:43] There's a dark side and there's a a
[46:44] bright side.
[46:46] That's because it's like faith. Well,
[46:49] faith it's elusive. But that's what
[46:50] faith is. Remember, in order for
[46:53] something to be faith, there has to be
[46:55] something against it,
[46:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Has to be.
[47:00] That's why here we live by faith.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; In eternity, it's going to be full
[47:06] perfect realization
[47:08] &gt;&gt; of everything we believed.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; So until we get there, when we believe
[47:13] by faith that there's eternal life,
[47:16] death testifies against it.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; If we were all 800,000 years old right
[47:22] now, we could all have a lot of evidence
[47:24] to believe that, hey, you know what?
[47:25] Looking a lot like there's eternal life,
[47:28] right? I've been here for 800,000 years
[47:30] and I'm still single. I have no hopes to
[47:32] get married. But hey, you know what? At
[47:34] least I know that there is eternal life.
[47:36] And it's object. It's subjective
[47:38] experience. But faith believes in
[47:40] something beyond. And what the reason
[47:42] why you still have faith despite
[47:44] everything that's against it is because
[47:45] that's what faith is.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; And in Galatians 3 26, it says, "For ye
[47:50] are all the children of God by faith in
[47:53] Christ Jesus." Amen.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; We are God's children by faith in Christ
[47:59] Jesus.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; So I want to I want to share it this way
[48:02] and hopefully I can sprint through
[48:04] what's what's remaining here.
[48:07] That's your magnumopus.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; That that's your magnumopus. What's the
[48:13] greatest thing you could do? Believe.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; What's the only thing he asked you to
[48:17] do? Believe.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; So what's the greatest thing you have?
[48:22] Your faith. Right.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; What's the greatest work in your life?
[48:25] Faith.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; You Well, I I kind of think I'd like to
[48:28] think that Jesus Christ is Brother
[48:30] Aaron. Okay. Can I take away your faith
[48:34] and he still be the greatest gift? I'm
[48:37] not trying to play semantics with what
[48:38] Brother Brandham taught. I'm trying not
[48:39] to try to play semantics with the
[48:41] scripture. This is the work of God that
[48:42] you believe in Christ.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; So, you can't even separate J- E Su from
[48:48] F AI T.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; G R A C. You can't do it. That's right.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; That's your magnum opus.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Listen, whether you believe him or not,
[48:55] Christ is the key.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Whether you accept him or not, he's the
[48:59] one truth by which everyone will be
[49:01] judged.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; And so when he becomes a part of you by
[49:04] faith, that's your magnum opus.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 2:5 says that your faith
[49:09] should not stand in the wisdom of men.
[49:12] Men produce their own magnumopus through
[49:14] wisdom, through industry, through art,
[49:16] of the mind. They want to search it out.
[49:18] They want to arrive. They want to
[49:19] discuss. They want to discover. This is
[49:21] man's insatiable desire to be inventors
[49:23] and entrepreneurs. There's something
[49:24] that drives men to accomplish tangible
[49:26] things. They can say, "I'm standing on
[49:28] my own intelligence. I'm standing on my
[49:30] own ability." And it's pride that drives
[49:32] them to attain to things instead of just
[49:34] coming naked to Christ. I got nothing.
[49:36] Here I am.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; You alone have the bread of life. But
[49:39] the Jews refused to do it through pride
[49:40] and arrogance.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Because they wanted their faith to stand
[49:44] in the wisdom of men.
[49:46] But Paul said, "It's done such that you
[49:48] fa you your faith stands in the power of
[49:52] God."
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Not on the foolishness of carnal things,
[49:58] &gt;&gt; realize just how temporary
[50:02] it is to try to base everything on
[50:04] temporary things,
[50:06] &gt;&gt; carnal things.
[50:11] And then in verse 41
[50:15] the Jews murmured at him
[50:18] because he said I am the bread which
[50:19] come down from came down from heaven
[50:23] and all that that implies right
[50:27] it's not that they looked at him says if
[50:29] you know if any anybody doesn't look
[50:30] like a loaf of bread it's this guy. So
[50:33] it was everything that he implied by
[50:35] that.
[50:36] So, it's not just that part. There's
[50:38] more to the story. I'm saying that now
[50:40] because I want to come to something to
[50:41] where it's like, yeah, they nitpick on
[50:43] one thing because that that was too hard
[50:46] to accept. But really, you got to take
[50:47] it all in context. And now notice what
[50:50] they immediately say. They weren't
[50:51] asking this question when they sailed
[50:52] across the ocean, were they? And they
[50:55] said, "Is not this Jesus the son of
[50:57] Joseph whose father and mother we know?
[50:59] How is it that he saith, I came down
[51:01] from heaven?" Oh, now they've got a
[51:03] problem.
[51:05] Now, now they're
[51:10] just a little bit ago, they knew every
[51:11] they knew who his father and mother
[51:12] were.
[51:14] They knew exactly who he was.
[51:19] But yet, they told themselves, "There's
[51:21] something to this. It's worth pursuing.
[51:24] Let's go seek." But then their search
[51:26] history gets exposed. They get
[51:28] uncovered. And now all of a sudden, it's
[51:30] like,
[51:31] "I'm visiting my aunt here. You were in
[51:33] my way. I'm going over here.
[51:37] They rejected faith in Jesus Christ
[51:40] because of their own lusts,
[51:42] &gt;&gt; their own carnality. Now, sure, they'll
[51:44] be intellectually dishonest about it.
[51:49] And they were being dishonest here. John
[51:52] 10 22 to 42. Notice this in a similar
[51:56] vein. It says, "And it was at Jerusalem,
[51:57] the feast of the dedication, and it was
[51:59] winter, and Jesus walked into the temple
[52:01] of Solomon's porch. Then came the Jews
[52:04] round about him and said to him, "How
[52:06] long does thou make us to doubt?" So now
[52:08] it's his fault they doubt,
[52:10] right? Jesus Christ is the swer of
[52:13] doubt. You know, he he did more damage
[52:15] to the Old Testament than he did good.
[52:18] How long does thou make us to doubt? If
[52:20] thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
[52:22] That's how we want it, right?
[52:25] We want God to come down and wake us up
[52:27] in the middle of the night and say,
[52:28] "Aaron, Aaron, take the job. Take the
[52:33] job."
[52:35] Right? We want we want that. But if he
[52:36] did it, you would completely panic and
[52:40] be like, "Oh my goodness, the devil
[52:41] wants me to take the job."
[52:43] And God's like, "Oh, thought that's what
[52:46] you asked for. Never mind. I'll go back
[52:48] to the still small voice." Right? And
[52:50] all a sudden, you just get this still
[52:51] small voice. Take the job. Thank you.
[52:54] Can't believe the devil did that.
[52:57] There's that faith, that still small
[52:58] voice. Tell us plainly. And Jesus
[53:01] answered them, said, "I told you."
[53:03] Right? He's always beating around the
[53:05] bush. He just said, "I told you." And
[53:08] you believed not.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; The works that I do in my father's name,
[53:13] they bear witness of me. But you believe
[53:15] not because you are not of my sheep.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; How that that fails on our DEI qualities
[53:21] here. I mean the initiatives that we
[53:23] have put in place to qualify for
[53:25] inclusion and diversity and there needs
[53:28] to be equity. You cannot have a rigorous
[53:31] admission standard that would keep
[53:33] people out who are goats.
[53:36] That's not fair to the Bradies of this
[53:38] world. You've got to have a standard
[53:40] that just lets us all join.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; He says in verse 27, "My sheep hear my
[53:46] voice and I know them and they follow
[53:48] me."
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he begins to talk more about
[53:51] I'll give them eternal life. They'll
[53:52] never perish. No man can pluck them out
[53:54] of my hand. The father is greater than
[53:56] them all.
[53:58] And verse 30, I and my father are one.
[54:02] And then the Jews took up stones again
[54:04] to stone him.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Notice just how mad it makes them. This
[54:09] is not even rational behavior. At that
[54:11] moment, they decided that their sole
[54:13] purpose in existing and their sole
[54:14] public ministry was to discredit him, to
[54:17] destroy him, and kill him.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; That's the works of Satan.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; When immediately, that's what their
[54:24] purpose is in life.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Then the Jews took up stones to stone
[54:28] him. Jesus answered, "Many good works
[54:29] have I showed you from my father. For
[54:32] which of those works do you stone me?"
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Wow, what an answer.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; And you don't think the devil's clever?
[54:38] They answered, "For a good work we stone
[54:40] thee not, but for blasphemy, because
[54:44] that thou being a man maketh thyself
[54:46] God."
[54:48] Notice the the hypocrisy in that cuz
[54:51] remember how before when they said, "You
[54:54] said that your father was God. How could
[54:58] you do that?"
[55:00] And he turns right around and says,
[55:01] "You're born of fornication." They go,
[55:02] "No, God's our father."
[55:08] And somebody's over there going,
[55:12] "Wait, what? Hold on. It's wrong when he
[55:15] says it. It's right when you say it.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; That doesn't make sense.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; You're a hypocrite.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; That's what they are. It's a hypocrisy
[55:24] of them in this the religious-minded in
[55:26] this instance where they said their God
[55:28] was their father was God, but it's not
[55:31] okay for someone else to say it."
[55:35] especially Christ when he's destroying
[55:37] their religious system
[55:40] and they say, "Well, it's not because
[55:41] the good things you did, but it's
[55:42] because these things you said." So
[55:45] that's their way of disregarding all the
[55:47] good,
[55:48] &gt;&gt; not even having to wrestle with it
[55:49] anymore.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; I don't even need to wrestle with the
[55:52] supernatural in your life because I've
[55:54] been able to find what I think to be
[55:55] blasphemy.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; And that way I can walk away with all my
[55:59] cognitive dissonance and say, "The man
[56:01] deserves to die."
[56:04] and they're being dishonest.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; So he says in verse 59, I'm just going
[56:10] to skip now because we're running out of
[56:12] time. Verse 59, these things said he in
[56:15] the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.
[56:18] Now this is of these Jews that murmured.
[56:22] So now we're kind of closing the chapter
[56:24] on the Jews. So now all the Jews that
[56:25] had come around are like, "Dude, this
[56:27] guy is wacko. We're going to take up
[56:29] stones to stone him. We're mad at this
[56:31] guy. We know who this guy is. We know
[56:32] his father and mother. We've we've bird
[56:34] dogged this. We've talked to everybody.
[56:35] We know exactly who he is. Let's leave.
[56:37] Verse 60. Many therefore of his
[56:40] disciples when they had heard him heard
[56:43] this said, "This is a hard saying. Who
[56:45] can bear it?
[56:48] Not everything Jesus says is just easy
[56:50] peasy."
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Again, like I said before, God hasn't
[56:54] made it. I was fellowshipping with a
[56:55] brother here recently and I said, "Do
[56:56] you realize if you were perfect without
[56:58] flaws, you wouldn't need God?"
[57:02] self- sovereign, self-sufficient,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; all powerful, all knowing.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; There'd be no fitting in with God.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; And so, here's the hard saying, if it
[57:12] was all Tell us plainly, and really, how
[57:15] shortsighted would anybody be to think
[57:17] that if he said it plainly, they would
[57:19] believe?
[57:21] &gt;&gt; I got a lot of doubt. You're causing a
[57:22] lot of doubt, buddy, because of these
[57:23] things you said. Now, go ahead and just
[57:25] own up here. Just tell us the truth
[57:26] whether or not you be the Messiah, and
[57:28] we'll believe you.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Right? It's like, "Oh, I'm the Messiah.
[57:34] Stall him." Right? That there's just a
[57:38] level of dishonesty in the scripture
[57:39] here. But now notice it's not the Jews.
[57:42] It's his disciples saying, "Yeah, this
[57:44] is a hard saying." To this point, they
[57:46] hadn't really expressed much. But now
[57:48] that this the Jews who murmured and now
[57:50] they feel maybe the weight of this
[57:52] conspiracy and maybe as the crowd was
[57:53] dwindling there in Capernaum like this
[57:55] is a hard saying and which is Jesus knew
[57:58] in himself that his disciples murmured
[58:00] at it. Hm. Is that mind reading? Sure
[58:02] sounds like divination that would be a
[58:04] Deuteronomy 18 violation. And he said
[58:05] unto them, do this offend you?
[58:09] What? And if you shall see the son of
[58:11] man ascend up where he was before? This
[58:13] is again an example where Jesus in the
[58:15] moment recognizes his own disciples are
[58:18] uncertain and now they're murmuring
[58:20] themselves. The Jews have murmured. Now
[58:22] his disciples are murmuring. And Jesus
[58:24] says, "You know what? I'm sorry. I
[58:26] shouldn't have said it that way. I I
[58:28] that I said that to the Jews just to
[58:30] kind of get some people to fall away. So
[58:31] let me just let me just temper it here.
[58:33] Let me just say God loves goodness and
[58:36] just be good, right? You know, I'm an
[58:39] example of goodness. I'm kind of an
[58:40] allegory for life. just embrace me as an
[58:42] allegory. Follow me, you know, let's not
[58:45] get caught up in all these weird things,
[58:46] but just you get what I'm saying? You
[58:48] feel me? And like they're all like,
[58:49] "Okay, good for a minute there. We
[58:51] thought you were actually kind of trying
[58:52] to say you were the bread of life and
[58:54] you were the only way to eternal life
[58:55] and now you made it a little bit easier.
[58:57] This is more palatable. Could could we
[58:58] not preach this to others because that
[59:00] seems like it'd be more people would be
[59:01] able to embrace it that way." Jesus
[59:03] doesn't do that. He says, "Oh, does that
[59:05] offend you? Oh, you think that was bad?
[59:09] Let me just go ahead and begin to break
[59:11] the mystery open to you. You stuck
[59:13] around this long. Let me go ahead and uh
[59:15] uh let me go ahead and preach the seven
[59:16] seals.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; It is the spirit that quickenth. What
[59:22] What is it to you if you see the son of
[59:23] man ascended up where he was before? It
[59:26] is the spirit that quickenth. The flesh
[59:28] profiteth nothing. The words that I
[59:29] speak unto you, they are spirit and they
[59:31] are life.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; But there are some of you that believe
[59:33] not.
[59:36] For Jesus knew from the beginning who
[59:37] they were that believed not and who
[59:39] should betray him
[59:41] &gt;&gt; to be like Jesus. Right? And he said,
[59:45] "Therefore I said unto you that no man
[59:47] can come unto me except it were given
[59:50] unto him of my father,
[59:52] &gt;&gt; the magnumopus."
[59:54] &gt;&gt; From that time many of his disciples
[59:57] went back and walked no more with him.
[1:00:02] when he failed to clarify the record.
[1:00:05] When he failed to back off, when he
[1:00:07] didn't give in to the need for the
[1:00:09] carnal and natural things, when it was
[1:00:10] more let's just stick with signs and
[1:00:12] wonders and miracles. It's been said
[1:00:13] that when he went to the word and the
[1:00:15] word only and he comes back to the
[1:00:16] spirit which quickens and then called
[1:00:19] out the fact that just merely following
[1:00:21] him is an evidence of election and he
[1:00:23] brought it down to a choice and a
[1:00:25] decision. From that time, many of his
[1:00:27] disciples went back and walked nor with
[1:00:29] him.
[1:00:31] If I can say this, the miracles were not
[1:00:33] the masterpiece.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; The faith that was quickened was the
[1:00:38] magnum opus.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; The bread was not the masterpiece. The
[1:00:43] teachings were not the masterpiece. The
[1:00:45] words were not the masterpiece. It was
[1:00:47] the spirit quickened by the word.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; That was the masterpiece.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; It was when those words somehow begin to
[1:00:55] resonate with them and they're kind of
[1:00:56] like, "Oh my goodness, that's a hard
[1:00:58] saying, but hey, you know what? Life's
[1:01:00] hard and oh my goodness, I can't make
[1:01:02] sense of that. But you know what? This
[1:01:03] is this is very interesting. Something
[1:01:04] in my heart is stirring.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; I have an atheistic coworker who's got
[1:01:09] some really strong arguments
[1:01:10] scientifically about how horribly wrong
[1:01:13] this Bible gets a lot of stuff. And
[1:01:15] there's something in here that's kind of
[1:01:16] like, yeah, you know what? Why do we
[1:01:17] even follow the Bible? Oh, isn't it
[1:01:18] interesting that you're 98% more likely
[1:01:21] to be a Pentecostal if you're born in
[1:01:22] this backwood city in Kentucky and just
[1:01:24] the same if you're born in this little
[1:01:26] state in India to be a Muslim. And
[1:01:28] you're like, "Wow, isn't this really
[1:01:29] interesting that it's all geographical
[1:01:30] and this seems to be more about genetics
[1:01:32] and cultural upbringing and social norms
[1:01:34] than it has to do with God." And you're
[1:01:35] like, "Maybe I'll move to India."
[1:01:39] But then something in your heart says,
[1:01:40] "No,
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; I feel like I won the lottery."
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Being born to the family I was born in.
[1:01:48] I feel like I feel like for me, what a
[1:01:50] grace because I see a brother Simon
[1:01:52] who's had to fight through hell,
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; to find truth
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; and to stand for it.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And so if that's your explanation, you
[1:02:03] can't explain that.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; The faith quickened in Ephesians chapter
[1:02:11] 2:5. When you were dead in sins, hath
[1:02:13] you hath he quickened, right? hath
[1:02:16] quickened us together with Christ. And
[1:02:18] again, by grace you're saved.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Psalms 119:50, this is my comfort in my
[1:02:23] affliction. Write it down. This is your
[1:02:24] comfort in your affliction. What is your
[1:02:26] comfort in your affliction? For thy word
[1:02:27] hath quickened me. There's nothing like
[1:02:30] the word to comfort you when you're
[1:02:32] going through a hard time.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; I know we might want to numb ourselves
[1:02:35] with entertainment and it's like, oh my
[1:02:37] goodness, we're going through difficult
[1:02:38] times. Let's go to Disneyland or let's
[1:02:39] go ahead and binge The Sopranos or
[1:02:41] whatever it might be. And if Vid Angel
[1:02:43] has it, obviously. And you know what? If
[1:02:45] it's Vid Angel, it's probably just like
[1:02:46] 2 minutes. You could binge the whole
[1:02:48] thing in two minutes. Mafia, bad over.
[1:02:52] New Jersey, no good. Like, man, we could
[1:02:54] get through a lot of series with this.
[1:02:57] And there is a Oh, could you just
[1:02:59] imagine if there was such a thing that
[1:03:01] could weed out all the politics and
[1:03:02] pretense and the posturing and the false
[1:03:04] doctrine in sermons? Like, every guy's
[1:03:07] sermon on his website is two seconds.
[1:03:10] It's like you can you can have your
[1:03:12] seats.
[1:03:17] Turn off the filters. It's three hours
[1:03:19] long.
[1:03:23] But here's your comfort and your
[1:03:24] affliction. His word.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like his word to comfort
[1:03:28] you. That's why the very first thing the
[1:03:30] devil begins to try to cause separation
[1:03:32] in is the word.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; He wants to get distance from the word.
[1:03:37] One of the worst things that can happen
[1:03:38] to our young people is when the voice of
[1:03:40] the prophet becomes foreign to them.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Because that's going to be the one of
[1:03:44] the first things the devil tries to make
[1:03:46] strange
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; is the voice of God. And I'm not just
[1:03:49] talking about the tone of brother
[1:03:50] Brandham, but the message, the Bible,
[1:03:52] spiritual, scriptural things that are
[1:03:53] competing with the entertainments and
[1:03:56] the podcast and all the things that the
[1:03:58] world has to offer. And all of a sudden,
[1:04:00] old English
[1:04:02] and a physical book,
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know, man.
[1:04:07] You want me to read? Therefore, they
[1:04:08] gathered them together and filled 12
[1:04:10] baskets with fragments of the five
[1:04:11] barley loaves of which remained over and
[1:04:13] above them that had been eaten. And
[1:04:15] you're like, what in the world are
[1:04:16] barley loaves?
[1:04:18] If it's not a a Minecraft loaf, right?
[1:04:21] If it can't be 8bit,
[1:04:24] I I don't want to have anything to do
[1:04:25] with it. It's almost like you have to
[1:04:26] reframe things in a way that they
[1:04:27] understand this life is bigger.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; So, it's the word. I really want the
[1:04:33] word quickens you. It's the word that
[1:04:34] does it. He's quickened us together with
[1:04:35] Christ. How? By grace you're saved. It's
[1:04:37] the word. The word is the spirit that
[1:04:39] quickenth. Romans 10:17 18. So then
[1:04:41] faith cometh by hearing
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; This is how the word is meant to bring
[1:04:49] forth and produce. The word preached is
[1:04:51] a spirit that quickens and makes a
[1:04:53] masterpiece in you. Your magnumopus.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; What was the masterpiece in your life?
[1:04:58] Not that you got healed. Not that you
[1:05:00] got a job. Not that he fix your
[1:05:01] marriage. No. The fact that you believe.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:06] And then in verse 18 it says, "But have
[1:05:07] they not heard?"
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, verily their sound went in out all
[1:05:11] the world, all the earth, and their
[1:05:13] words under the ends of the world. So
[1:05:16] have they not heard? Yeah, but they
[1:05:17] didn't believe the report is what the
[1:05:18] Bible says.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; They heard, but faith didn't come.
[1:05:24] That's where you see Hebrews, it didn't
[1:05:25] profit them because it wasn't mixed with
[1:05:26] faith. I believe Hebrews 4:2,
[1:05:29] by grace you're saved. Think of this
[1:05:31] quickening of faith in Matthew 7 21-23.
[1:05:35] Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord,
[1:05:37] Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:05:38] heaven, but he that doeth the will of my
[1:05:40] father which is in heaven.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; You remember what the will of God is.
[1:05:45] This is the will of him that sent me
[1:05:46] that everyone seeth the son and
[1:05:48] believeth on him.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; This is the work of God that you believe
[1:05:51] on him whom he hath sent.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; So it's not everyone that says Lord,
[1:05:55] Lord, will enter, but he that doeth the
[1:05:56] will of my father which is in heaven. I
[1:05:58] think it's important perhaps to consider
[1:06:01] that he's not just saying that you have
[1:06:03] only in your life done God's perfect
[1:06:05] will because wouldn't you think that all
[1:06:08] of us are out maybe even the birthday
[1:06:10] girl has she always been able to do
[1:06:13] God's God's will every day the perfect
[1:06:15] will of God
[1:06:17] you can say Lord Lord all you want but
[1:06:19] what would be the will of God to believe
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; to believe on Christ
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; but then this is their answer
[1:06:27] many will say unto me in that day, Lord,
[1:06:30] Lord, have we not prophesied in their
[1:06:32] name, in thy name, but they don't
[1:06:35] testify that they saw him and believed
[1:06:36] him, and in thy name cast out devils,
[1:06:39] but they do not say they saw him and
[1:06:40] believed him. And in thy name done many
[1:06:42] wonderful works, but they do not say
[1:06:44] they saw him and believed him. So, they
[1:06:45] had a lot of many, they had many works.
[1:06:46] They did big things,
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; But none of them were seeing and
[1:06:51] believing,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; then I will profess unto them, I never
[1:06:55] knew you. you depart from me ye that
[1:06:57] work iniquity.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; They had a work, but it wasn't the work
[1:07:02] of God. We say, "Oh, these are the
[1:07:04] mighty works of God. What can we do to
[1:07:05] work the works of God?" Lord, Lord, I
[1:07:06] have this. I have this. I have this. I
[1:07:08] have this. And it's kind of like, whoa,
[1:07:09] whoa, hold on, hold on. The magnumopus
[1:07:10] is to believe.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's all you needed. You didn't need
[1:07:14] to go out and try to do all these other
[1:07:16] things to prove to yourself that you
[1:07:17] were a Christian, that you believed in
[1:07:18] God. All you had to do was believe. He
[1:07:20] says, "Depart from me." because you
[1:07:21] didn't have the work of God, the will of
[1:07:24] God, the magnum opus.
[1:07:26] Titus 1:6, they profess that they know
[1:07:28] God, but in works they deny him, being
[1:07:30] abominable, that's not snowmen,
[1:07:33] abominable and disobedient, and unto
[1:07:35] every good work reprobate.
[1:07:38] They profess to know God, but all they
[1:07:39] produce is denial and rebellion.
[1:07:42] They profess that they know God or that
[1:07:44] they're seeking Jesus. There could be a
[1:07:46] lot of ways to phrase this in the
[1:07:47] context of John chapter 6. But what they
[1:07:49] do ultimately is they deny him the way,
[1:07:51] the truth, the life, the one they have
[1:07:53] already seen, the one that they've
[1:07:54] already heard,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; abominable and disobedient,
[1:08:00] and every good work reprobate. What good
[1:08:02] work can you do but believe?
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Because whatsoever is not of faith is
[1:08:08] sin. So we say, "Well, brother, there's
[1:08:10] a lot in this Bible." As a matter of
[1:08:11] fact, the majority of the New Testament
[1:08:12] deals with the external things as
[1:08:13] opposed to the internal things. The
[1:08:15] waiter things are the internal things.
[1:08:17] But if you do all the external without
[1:08:19] the faith, what does all this amounted
[1:08:20] to? It's
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; to be burned.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Because all this is going to be judged.
[1:08:26] And if it can't come down to faith,
[1:08:29] all this was of no value.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus sees that many of his own
[1:08:34] disciples walk away, he turns to the 12.
[1:08:38] You talk about this isn't even a church
[1:08:40] split at this point.
[1:08:42] This is a this is a um
[1:08:46] what is it they call it? This is a
[1:08:49] mandate against his ministry.
[1:08:53] His critics have spoken and now his most
[1:08:55] ardent followers have spoken. The ones
[1:08:56] that he had sent out, the very ones that
[1:08:58] you thought were with them. And now as
[1:09:02] they leave and he's left with 12 the day
[1:09:04] before, you remember the day before?
[1:09:06] Thousands.
[1:09:08] But now it's narrowed down to 12. And he
[1:09:10] turns to the 12 and says, "Will you also
[1:09:12] go away?"
[1:09:14] Now he's asking the questions. And Simon
[1:09:17] Peter answered and said, "Do you do you
[1:09:19] even need to read it?"
[1:09:22] You know what he said, don't you?
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; You know what he said, "Lord, to whom
[1:09:26] shall we go?"
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Thou hast the words of eternal life.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; And we believe and are sure that thou
[1:09:34] art that Christ, the son of the living
[1:09:37] God. Amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; That's Peter's magnumopus. I know his
[1:09:40] sermon on the day of Pentecost was
[1:09:41] pretty amazing, but that was for the
[1:09:43] church. This is Peter's great moment.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; This is this is like when he said Peter
[1:09:49] says, "Oh, thou at the Christ, the son
[1:09:51] of the flesh and blood hath not revealed
[1:09:52] this to you, but my father which is in
[1:09:54] heaven hath revealed this to you. Thou
[1:09:56] upon this rock, this work,
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; this your magnumopus, Peter, never let
[1:10:01] it leave you even in your darkest
[1:10:02] moment. return to this cuz it's going to
[1:10:04] be the secret to your new birth that I
[1:10:06] am the Christ, the son of the living
[1:10:08] God.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; This was his magnumopus, his greatest
[1:10:13] moment, his crowning achievement.
[1:10:15] And Jesus answered, and don't get hung
[1:10:17] up on even those words necessarily in
[1:10:19] this moment in scripture, but this is
[1:10:20] what we know about Peter.
[1:10:22] This is this great moment. To whom
[1:10:24] should we go? Who else has the words of
[1:10:26] eternal life? And Jesus answered them
[1:10:28] and said, "Have I not chosen you? 12 and
[1:10:31] one of you is a a devil. What a Debbie
[1:10:33] Downer. Like this is a moment when
[1:10:35] Peter's saying, "Hey, where are we going
[1:10:37] to go?" Right guys, who else are we
[1:10:38] going to go to? Everybody's like, "Yeah,
[1:10:39] you're right. Who could we go to? Thou
[1:10:40] alone have It's like what a beautiful
[1:10:42] moment." He's like, "And one of you is
[1:10:43] the devil." It's like,
[1:10:48] but why did he say that? He knew. He
[1:10:51] spake of Judas a Scariot, the son of
[1:10:52] Simon, for he it was that should betray
[1:10:55] him, being one of the 12.
[1:10:58] That's tough.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 28:5 says, "Evil men
[1:11:04] understand not judgment,
[1:11:07] but they that seek the Lord
[1:11:09] understandeth all things."
[1:11:13] A carnal search will never find what is
[1:11:16] right.
[1:11:19] But they that truly seek the Lord will
[1:11:21] understand all things.
[1:11:25] There'll be a greater unfolding of the
[1:11:27] word of God,
[1:11:29] a greater depth and love for Jesus
[1:11:31] Christ,
[1:11:33] more of the nature of Christ
[1:11:36] that begins to express and be exhibited
[1:11:37] in a person's life.
[1:11:40] That's what we want to see in one
[1:11:41] another,
[1:11:42] right?
[1:11:44] That's what we want to see in us. That's
[1:11:46] what should alarm us when we don't see
[1:11:48] it in someone else.
[1:11:51] In Philippians chapter 1 6 to11,
[1:11:54] being confident of this very thing, that
[1:11:56] he which hath begun a good work in you
[1:11:57] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:11:59] Christ.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Your magnum opus is his.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And he'll perform it.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; He'll keep performing it.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; You'll never tire of this refrain. You
[1:12:10] never tire of this melody. You'll never
[1:12:12] it'll never grow old. He that has begun
[1:12:14] this magnum opus will continue to work
[1:12:17] it until the day of Jesus Christ. Even
[1:12:19] as it meet for me to think this of you
[1:12:21] all, because I have you in my heart, in
[1:12:23] so much as both in my bonds and in my
[1:12:24] offense and confirmation of the gospel,
[1:12:26] you're all partakers of my grace. For
[1:12:29] God is my record how greatly I long
[1:12:30] after you in all the bowels of Jesus
[1:12:33] Christ. And this I pray that your love
[1:12:35] may abound yet more and more in all in
[1:12:37] knowledge and in all judgment. That ye
[1:12:39] may approve things that are excellent,
[1:12:41] that you may be sincere and without
[1:12:42] offense till the day of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:44] That's the nature of Christ, the
[1:12:45] approval of things that are excellent.
[1:12:48] We can leave today and become experts in
[1:12:50] our disapproval of things that are not
[1:12:52] excellent, right? Bogus. And we just go
[1:12:56] out and we're just completely fed up and
[1:12:59] disapproving of everything that's not
[1:13:01] excellent. But he wants us to grow in
[1:13:04] his knowledge that we can approve
[1:13:05] excellent things that we've been sincere
[1:13:07] and without offense, being filled with
[1:13:08] the fruits of righteousness which are by
[1:13:10] Jesus Christ
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; under the glory and praise of God. Amen.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Said this way in Hebrews 12:2, looking
[1:13:16] unto Jesus, the author and finisher of
[1:13:19] our magnumopus.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; He started it, he'll finish it.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; He that was begun this good work in you.
[1:13:26] Paul says in Galatians 2:20, I'm
[1:13:28] crucified with Christ, nevertheless, I
[1:13:29] live yet not I. Trying to build the
[1:13:32] momentum on how we approach the
[1:13:33] scripture here recently, but Christ
[1:13:34] liveth in me.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; The key, the key note, the masterpiece
[1:13:41] is alive in me. We have this treasure in
[1:13:43] earth and vessels. The excellency is not
[1:13:45] of myself but of God. And the life which
[1:13:47] I now live in the flesh, I live by the
[1:13:50] faith of the son of God
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; who loved me and gave himself for me.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; I'm living by faith.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Musicians, you could come. I guess that
[1:14:00] means brother Elliott and Sister
[1:14:03] Rebecca, you could come to your
[1:14:04] instruments. Your magnum opus. What is
[1:14:06] it? What what's the context I'm putting
[1:14:08] it in today? Your faith. Yeah,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; you are. That's your masterpiece.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; By grace, you are saved through faith.
[1:14:18] What is it that I have? What is this
[1:14:20] work? The author and finisher of our
[1:14:22] faith.
[1:14:24] And this great work must pass through
[1:14:26] the hall of critics.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; That's your lifeline.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in your time of great
[1:14:33] trouble and affliction, what's going to
[1:14:34] comfort you is the word of God. So, what
[1:14:36] is the what is the devil going to try to
[1:14:38] make uncomfortable? God's word.
[1:14:41] If your lifeline in the life you now
[1:14:42] live, you live by the faith of the son
[1:14:44] of God. What is it that Satan's going to
[1:14:46] attack above all? Ultimately, he wants
[1:14:48] to get to the lifeline of faith.
[1:14:52] First John 5:es 4 and 5, for whatsoever
[1:14:54] is born of God overcometh the world. And
[1:14:56] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:14:58] world, even our faith.
[1:15:01] Whosoever is born of God, it is by faith
[1:15:02] that we are the children of God. So
[1:15:05] faith is the victory.
[1:15:08] Who is it that overcometh the world? But
[1:15:09] he that believeth that Jesus is the son
[1:15:11] of God.
[1:15:13] Therein lies the secret to your
[1:15:15] overcoming. If you're not overcoming, if
[1:15:18] you've gotten weak, it's somewhere in
[1:15:20] the faith connection that you can get
[1:15:23] out of it. I'm telling you right now,
[1:15:25] there's no addiction. There's no battle.
[1:15:28] There's nothing you're facing that seems
[1:15:30] to be so overwhelming that if you could
[1:15:31] just get back in tune with that chord of
[1:15:34] faith,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; because that's what the devil's trying
[1:15:37] to get you out of tune to.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; By faith, we believe all things are
[1:15:42] possible.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; By faith, I believe.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; And so, the very thing that the devil
[1:15:47] wants to completely take away is faith.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Don't let him do it. The Bible says
[1:15:54] Hebrews 10:23, "Let us hold fast the
[1:15:56] profession of our faith without
[1:15:57] wavering,
[1:15:58] for he is faithful that promised."
[1:16:03] Let us hold fast the profession. In
[1:16:06] other words, it's what we confess to be
[1:16:07] ours.
[1:16:09] Let us hold fast our magnum opus.
[1:16:14] Let us hold fast to it.
[1:16:18] Why hold fast? Why would we be told to
[1:16:21] hold fast? because it's that very thing
[1:16:23] that'll be challenged.
[1:16:25] I do believe on some level we can
[1:16:27] describe it this way that you have by
[1:16:29] faith taken a hold of the key which is
[1:16:32] Christ and then Satan will hit you and
[1:16:35] hit you and hit you to get you to loosen
[1:16:38] your grip and get you to loosen your
[1:16:40] grip. And then when you let go and you
[1:16:42] begin to say, "I don't know. I don't
[1:16:44] know." And you begin to feel as if
[1:16:46] you're losing your mind and and
[1:16:48] everything gets in turmoil. Satan's got
[1:16:50] you where he where he wants you because
[1:16:51] now the hand of faith is going to try to
[1:16:53] reach and find something.
[1:16:55] And he's going to begin to tell you that
[1:16:57] hand never touched anything. You never
[1:16:58] felt anything. You never got anywhere to
[1:17:00] begin with. It's all a mirage. Look at
[1:17:01] all these other people in India that are
[1:17:02] Muslims because where they grew up or
[1:17:03] whatever, Hindu, whatever it might be.
[1:17:05] And you, what is it? It's just all
[1:17:06] coincidence for you. And you just need
[1:17:07] to rethink this. You need to go through
[1:17:08] this. And all of a sudden, that hand
[1:17:09] begins to think, "What have I done? What
[1:17:10] have I done?" Just reach out for Jesus.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; That's who it was you fell in love with.
[1:17:16] Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; I could promise you none of you fell in
[1:17:19] love with me except for one of you. But
[1:17:22] you know what I mean.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Right? I'm not holding your hand.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Think of all the paths you took here.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Who's leading you? Jesus Christ.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; I say this with all my heart. Don't let
[1:17:35] go of him.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Just take your hand
[1:17:40] and reach back up
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; and take Jesus Christ to say, "I believe
[1:17:44] you." Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Deliberately right now, I'm believing
[1:17:48] you. Let's stand.
[1:17:51] My gracious heavenly father,
[1:17:55] it's a dark day. It's an evil day. It's
[1:17:57] a horrible day, but I thank you for the
[1:17:59] light.
[1:18:02] Lord, we're challenged on every side,
[1:18:04] but you are yet still with us.
[1:18:07] The enemy draws close upon us, but we
[1:18:11] feel your love.
[1:18:13] And Lord, our heart aches
[1:18:15] in moments of great trial
[1:18:19] and loss of strength and even the
[1:18:20] question of our faith.
[1:18:26] But truly any truly we can say we've
[1:18:29] seen you. We've seen you. We've seen you
[1:18:33] and we believe
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:37] Satan, you are defeated.
[1:18:43] You've lost your sting.
[1:18:47] The only power you have old hold of me
[1:18:51] is when I take the hand of faith and I
[1:18:54] pick up my doubt.
[1:18:57] So Lord, I empty my hands of doubt. I
[1:19:00] empty my hands of negativity. I empty my
[1:19:02] hands and I reach out to you and I take
[1:19:06] a hold of the key and I ask, Lord,
[1:19:10] give me understanding.
[1:19:14] Give me this bread, this spiritual bread
[1:19:17] of the Son of Man. Give me the truth,
[1:19:19] Lord,
[1:19:20] that I may know you, be at peace,
[1:19:24] delivered, free.
[1:19:28] I pray this for the young people. I pray
[1:19:30] this for all of us. Father, send the
[1:19:32] angel with the softest hands in this
[1:19:33] difficult moment. Minister to your
[1:19:35] bride. I pray in the name of the Lord
[1:19:37] Jesus Christ.
[1:19:39] Amen.
[1:19:42] Amen.
