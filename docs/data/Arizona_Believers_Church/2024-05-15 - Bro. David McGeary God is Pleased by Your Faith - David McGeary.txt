TRANSCRIPT
========================================
one of the things that is obviously placing Us in this day and this time is we've received an end time message we know that it's it's the anointing of Elisha that was to turn the hearts of the children back to uh the faith of the fathers so it was a faith that was to be restored and it was uh through the ministry of Elisha and uh what I just desire to to minister to you tonight what's upon my heart is and some way not to give it a title but uh he's pleased by your faith so it is enough to believe on the word of God it's is the very requirement of what he's looking for in this day he he was would I find faith when I come and so our confidence can be in if we've receiv received the end time message that was to deliver the faith then that word is accomplishing exactly what God has sent it to perform our our role is to believe it amen so what we want to be aware of is uh is how God is moving in that and also uh everything that the devil would do to try to pre prevent that Faith from being fully effectual or perfect faith in our life and uh brother brandom where a lot of the inspiration we have is from this the ministry of perfect faith and we'll probably be reading from that quite a bit but I I do want to go ahead and turn turn through some additional scriptures if you turn with me to Hebrews chap 11 it is the it is the faith chapter I don't think you could Minister on it with that faith without taking a text from there and in chapter 11 it would read now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen so from the very beginning we know that faith is a substance it's a positive and brother brandham all the way through his ministry you're not going to find it I don't think one sermon where he's not emphasizing the Dynamics of Faith where Faith's final resting place is the word of God we don't if Faith any place anywhere else is not a perfect Faith you can place faith in other things but as Believers what we're interested in is a perfect faith and the only place that you could have perfect faith is in a perfect word right it it's the only place you can have perfect Faith otherwise you have faith that is just as good as what you've put it in yes right so you you're confidence in somebody and when your confidence is broken it's because you put Faith or confidence in that person and they were just as good as the as they were right I mean your maybe your faith was pretty good I mean you had a perfect confidence in the person but what was your confidence in right so that that is a that is something that fundamentally people get confused because you're built to believe right you every every creation made in the image of God is is built with a tuning Crystal you're going to believe in something okay so it becomes very important to understand that there's people who have a strong conviction they have a faith it's probably to them imp paracle the evidence of their faith is their faith but they've placed it in something that is not perfect the only perfect resting place is the word of God heavens and earth will pass away but the word of God cannot pass away it's the very thing now we're it's exciting for us because we know through the through the Eagle Vision of a prophet that even the worlds were formed by faith because God believed his own word when it was spoken now how how incredible is that to understand that faith is never out of the equation okay I I one of the earliest experiences of me as a you know I as a young believer um was to see a miracle was my I had a dog it was dundy her name was dundy she was a she was a good dog and uh being loyal and compassionate she allowed me to take a brush grill a metal BR you know the metal brushes you normally scrub a grill with well it was quite the dearer I tell you what I was helping that dog out I was getting all that summer you know in the summer getting that winter fur out of there and all of a sudden she yelped and I looked down and I had created a a heat blister like er rer burn about this big on her and it really struck me it hurt right like how could she let me do this and just that uh her ability to endure the pain until she couldn't endure it anymore it moved me you know I was like oh my I can't believe I did this and right then when I wanted an answer there was an opposition that that said don't pray it's just a dog God's not going to hear your prayer well we rebuke that God heal we know we've heard about a story about a posum and a fish we've got a message that's imparted Faith right we've got something that has has given imparted Faith to us and as a recipient of that I I took my dog and I I held her to me and I just prayed a simple prayer that the Lord would touch her and miraculously that was gone now I'll tell you this was my a young experience but the very next thought was it was never there you're mistaken right so it it's it's it's important you understand now the same faith that had to pray then had to believe even in the absence now now the now the liar is still there it was never there that first it was it's he's not going to heal it now it's it was never there so what do you have you still have a carnal mind mind that only wants to accept the mental faculties that it's given in other words we know that if there was a wound there you would see it well the fact that it's no longer there what are you now having to doubt your mental faculties and that's what faith allows you to do is have a substance that's able to call those things as though they are that that are as though they are not right right and the things that are not as though they are so A Mir just Faith allows you it it it was just as definitive whether it was there or not but my eyes were even testifying to the fact it wasn't there so what did Faith have to do it still had to rest yeah that God performed a miracle so don't ever think that faith is dependent or somehow is has an obstacle of these five senses right I I'll I'll tell you right now these five senses will always be in opposition to Faith because if they weren't it would no longer be Faith so I'm thankful there's still some if you will uh Faith still has to have its work because even after a miracle is performed there's faith and why am I happy for that because without faith it's impossible to please God and your faith is pleasing right so what's on our heart is even in that opport even after the miracle performed now upon my lips I'm testifying that he's the same yesterday today and forever and I'm sharing that God still heals animals right now I I know my my experience is is not unique I could I imagine if we went through this room right now things are rising up in all of us I remember when God did this he came on the scene for this and we're we're we're gathered together as Believers recipients of a faith that is still performing the supernatural amen um Romans 10:1 17 so so then Faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of God right so the the testimony of the word is going to is going to Quicken faith in you and you're a carrier of that so that's what one thing that um it is from Faith to Faith and it's and you are given the capacity to share Faith it's good I like by by putting the word of God on your lips it was always a mystery how can I impart eternal life that's a powerful statement from a prophet that you as Believers have the power to impart eternal life and it is because you're a carrier of the word when you take the word upon your lips and it's it it and it's it's quickened a word in it season the holy spirit is there to brood out over it and to bring it to pass and we believe that you cast your bread upon the Water we should always be ready to give a response and a word and we want to be in the channel and yield us so that God can Quicken the word through us and we could be a living testimony amen now this is the interesting thing in Hebrews 4: two it says For unto us the gospel was preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and them that heard it so again it goes back to the principle faith is a gift of God so the same word can could could be spoken out and and that what you have to realize is the fact that you can believe it that you have the capacity that you have something in you that does not question that receives the word of God is all the Vindication that you should need to be resting that the word is performing a work in your life there's no other evidence that you need to rest in it's not because you feel it it's not because uh you you uh you know you got emotional it's not because you shouted it's not even because you could feel the anointing it's because the word stands absolute and Perfect by itself it's the word that's what you're resting on the faith that you have is not a sympathy Faith it's not a it's not a form of belief it's not an emotion but it is absolutely tied to the word of God because Revelation and Faith are pretty much the same thing right you don't you by Revelation understand the love letter that the word of God is when it speaks to you it has has life and it has meaning and it it is a dynamic that that that the world tries to imitate and all every inspiration that's out there really tries to steal from the inspiration that God showed in the very beginning with Adam and Eve with with Adam walking in the garden it was that love relationship that when someone could understand something that said on another level that no one else can yeah very good and that's the life of it that's the faith the faith is love one one actually engenders the other because it was while you were unlovable that he died for you it's the understanding of the love of God that actually allows Faith to be exercised in your life we love him because he first loved us he would rather us love one another right that's the fullest commandment well you can't give what you ain't got you can't right you this religion's full people who exercise Hollow etiquette they got just enough religion to make themselves miserable but when you really have been forgiven and you really know what it's like to be taken from nothing when he could love you despite what you were you don't have a stone to throw the only thing you want is others to experience the same love that you've experienced yes and that's the faith that we have is that if he could do it for us if by the price of Calvary by the finished work he could touch your life then that same sacrifice is the same way that he's still touching others amen 1 John 4: 16- 21 and we have known and believ the love of God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love for perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment so one of the very things that we want to capture is is what stands in opposition to Faith fear so what is it that is it by that makes our faith perfect is love it is the method the way that God is going to cast out fear is love so the you can't have faith without love and I it's it's it's as we will Lord willing get in share some quotes um we'll go through just some of the way that God uses uh those things but you you can't separate them yes um if you look at the stature of a perfect man I believe that they have that you have faith on the bottom it's the very foundation and yet at the top is love well if love is the very thing that produces Faith then why is it at the Top If we're built up from the bottom right seems to be a paradox and and to me I just love that the scripture says he's the Alpha and Omega God is love right you he he's the very beginning of it all and he's the end of it all while we're finished in a Capstone of love love is the very it's still at the very bottom it's the foundation it's in faith your faith is rooted and grounded in the love of God for you and how do we know he loves us because his word said so amen so we're we're we are um we're we're we can't lose right he swore by himself because he couldn't swear by any other as we were reading in in Hebrews chapter 11 I I don't think I went past the first verse uh verse two for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things that were seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous and God testifying of his gifts that by it he being dead yet speaketh and this is this is so uh beautiful to us because we understand the Revelation he got and what he understood was that there was a blood requirement that it the the original sin and and the requirement that there was a a lamb slain that when they left the garden there was the they were clothed and it was beating you know their legs as they left there was an atonement that was spoken by the lamb that was slain and Abel by Revelation offers up that sacrifice and then what's in opposition to that is religion right so if you look just in the scale of things in man's carnality the bride of Christ is gathered together in a small building here in Phoenix today while there's great Majesty in religious Grandeur going on around the world yeah and it's no different than Cain taking the the labor the fruit of his works and the labors and how beautiful it was it by all aesthetic means was the more grandioso it was probably more moving it would have been something that you would have been more likely an apt after your own flesh to be around because death is ugly right I you know it just is is ugly and society and everything that it's built to do is Shield our understanding that death is a reality of the Fall it does by Society by the by by Civics we do a really good job of most of you probably haven't had to encounter a dead body on the side of the road you go to some places you go to India different places they put them on the curb you know there's there's certain cultures and societies they don't have the means by that we have to really protect Society at large from the consequences and the results of sin right but here's death not a great scene testifying that a price has to be paid yeah there's always a reproach to the gospel and as soon as you try to take the reproach out of it you're you're you're you're uh you're you're losing it right you you've already lost because if there was not a reproach in it then Jesus Christ would have come in glory he would have come in a way that but from the very time that he is born he's born in a manger right and it was because he was going to be able to be approached by Shepherds that he came in a way that all all could F could come unto him there there is no no matter how you esteem yourself how low that you think you are he came in such an estate that you can come unto him there's not a there that's the one person you don't have to be embarrassed to go before he held it he he would he despised the shame he bore your sin if we could catch the love that he displayed on Calvary and the The Obedience that he had through the things which he suffered to fully understand the love of God it would start to build a confidence in who you are because you're who he sought and who he died for and in this day we have received a restored word in that truth um you know we could we could spend some time and and talk about you know really what's being restored we know that there was four death messenger for Life Messengers and uh we could go into really how he's rebuilding back in the restoration of faith and what we've received in this day is a perfect word to to provide a perfect Faith because we want to get into uh some of the substance of uh you know I think we'll do fine on time we will try not to keep you too long I think we're doing all right and the restoration of the Bride tree paragraph 504 he says listen real close look there was four death Messengers killed that tree that's right that was it the palmerworm Locust cankerworm caterpillar is that right four Messengers get it amen four God said I will restore he's going to restore it how by four death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost right so we're not just coming to Pentecost and then we're restored there was a restoration of the gifts there was the outpouring there was something that took place and there's a parallel that I find with coming that far um in the Book of Romans and and we'll we'll we'll look at it but but where are we at right amen that's what we want to catch because then if we are recognizing our day in our message then our faith can rise up because there's something that's being accomplished he's going to restore it how by four death Messengers killed it John Wesley third Pentecost restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word the word there were four prophets one of them Martin Luther we know he goes in different places calls them reformers but Martin Luther he began to to shine a light there was a little light just a very small strength of justification along the way Wesley stronger sanctification after Wesley the stronger Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost and another great prophet see but in the last days Malachi for Elisha is to come with the very word the word of the Lord came to the prophet in the evening light is to come forth to restore bring back what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of God forth now let there be light God's word can't fail this was a promise it's the light of God producing just like the light Shone brewed out over the Earth and and brought forth a life the light of God in this C can't help but perform but to bring forth the Life of Christ in a bride yes and we're resting in that right we've received an end time message to call forth and to Quicken a bride how do we know the message has come yes how do I know it's for me I had an ear to hear I had an eye to see how it wasn't of me I didn't it wasn't my mental acuity but he placed something in me to believe with yes and it's a gift of God and it's enough and it's pleasing to him yes and and if we catch that we don't we we're not built on Penance right you know one of the tricks of the devil is to think that you have some Merit that you have another place to rest anything that you rest in besides the finished work is is really resting in a in the creation rather than the Creator you're somehow lifting up uh whether it's the gift whether it's you know uh you know because gifts want to steer your resting place back to the word of God it's not that the gift isn't genuine it isn't that it's not of God but man is always being blinded and lifting up a gift and never getting to the gift-giver right so if you ever put the emphasis on anything else but what God intended it to be on you it's just misplaced but that's been that way from the very beginning he said they're without excuse because the things of God are so clearly made manifest in the things around us nature declares God all around us so what has man done he he's caught the inspiration that God has reflected in nature and they started to worship the creation rather than God right but but that is just enough to convict them that there was something that should have drove them further it's it's not a way of Salvation it just says they're without excuse right so the thirst to say just as job had said I'm looking at nature what of man the the flower dies it goes into the ground it comes back again but while I'm on Earth I have Fellowship ship with God through the sacrifice of bulls you know I I have a way of communing with God but what is the thing what he feared was that something could separate him from God and it it was death yeah what happens when man dies right what is going to become of him so nature itself should be enough to convict somebody and I believe if you you know we know that if you meet God on the same basis that someone else has met him he's obligated to act the same right so here's job now carrying forth a revelation that has come from the garden that there's a blood atonement that's needed but there's still the question of what a man when he dies and he's in travail and he's in desperation and that which he feared Came Upon him right and the Revelation that he comes away with and what would ass seem be meant for evil the devil coming and and sifting his life and all the trials and all the travail a Believer through travail is going to come to a revelation that nothing can separate me from God there's not another result there's not another end to the trial of a Believer then that you nothing can separate Me me from God the love of God wins it's Victorious you can you can take it right back to the devil and say I know my redeemer liveth I know that this word of God has could perform a work in my life and that the trying of my faith is more perfect than gold yeah and in the storm when you're testifying to it it's just putting it right back in the face of the devil right and that's pleasing to God when you stand by faith and you say I have no other reason to believe it but besides God's word he said so that pleases God and it bruises the devil it bruises them and um you know I if you can go back and listen to perfect faith I you know I haven't been reading the quotes but brother brandom in there has just come to me close to uh he says I get spells too you know I get moody I get to the spot where what's it gets me it gets those spells when I get all overworked and Satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world and what so remember I'm not immune to Temptation now that's something that he would equate a mood getting in the moly grubs to a Temptation we often think a temptation of oh you know go steal a cookie from the cookie jar right um I'm going to stay up late I don't know you know what I'm going to play my video games even though I got told to go to bed and we go get the phone I don't know but temptation's usually you know thought of as some Indulgence right right something that's going to satiate or be fun you know that's Temptation usually in our thinking but this isn't Pleasant I'm getting Moody I'm getting depressed I'm getting this is not fun but what is it doing it's giving glory to something that is contrary to the word right so he you have to resist that Temptation and I love this secret amen this is some insightful this is a a a soldier who knows how to do battle he's going to tell you how he does battle when he's faced with this situation and he says you know it happens to him when he's all overworked then when I look back and see something like this I put it right back in his face now he's coming off a testimony that's been shared about a healing and how the Lord's used them or something that God's done so what you David encouraged his heart in the Lord so what you do anytime that Satan comes to you and gets you feeling moody maybe it's about your past you know it it greater than all my sin no matter how great you make the problem it just makes my God greater no ma no whatever you're piling on you just lifted up my God because he's greater if I'm that bad than how much love he really loved me yeah if if my sin got so much bigger how much greater the price that Calvary paid right if it's if it whatever it is you've got to now turn that temptation to side with the mood to side with the moly grub and to turn it around and put it back in the face of the devil that helps me overcome what is it like a certain friend of mine setting in the meeting there was a clan a clan doesn't believe in Divine Healing young fellow recently and says nothing's to it and he goes through and he testifies but turn around and put that back in the devil's face whatever he's doing you just smash it right back in his face yeah amen and the Lord knows he'll Quicken it to you but there should be a word of God a a joy that could come and restore the joy of your salvation through the work that Christ has done in your life and if that hasn't become real to you there's an experience that can be had there's a a gift of the Holy Ghost there is a baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ that could come and make all things new that is our promise we have a simple gospel those who come to God must believe that he is right and that he is a rewarder that diligently seek Him and we've received a word that's not going to fail right amen we're we're living in a provided Place uh that God's provided in this day where where these things are still the new birth is still for our children there's a baptism baptism of the Holy Ghost for every generation you know you you can't preach the whole gospel without preaching that right you can't I know we live in the day of the the power of the spoken word and there's things that are transpiring in a realm unseen by the word of God but there still are hands that have to be extended the the prayer for the sick is not taken out of the Gospel I I could admonish you that yes you receiving the word and faith is enough but there's a portion of the scripture that's been given to help your faith that said that you have the Elders of the church pray with you annoint them with oil lay hands on the sick and they shall recover faith in that word is just as good as faith in any part of it right there was the doubting Thomas that required that his hand be put in his side but God is performing things in your life that are going to make Faith effectual right and it's going to be after those things happen then you are commissioned now you you have a faith something's been imparted to you you've seen the word of God performed in your life you're under obligation now to testify what God's made real to you right because that's the that is the economy of God from Faith to Faith amen just uh try to see where we're at amen now one of the beautiful things that that the Lord dealt with me on is that um how the love that we received that the Lord shown us is is pure just as love is pure and brother Brandon begins to go through it I I I I feel we could it's not I love reading the prophet so if I do some lengthy reading I I know that you'll you'll love it too because I I do feel we could say no man spake like this man uh we could find our own words to try to say it but you know this was the voice to our age that God used to impart faith it was a Malachi 4 voice so I I my faith is by reading the words of a prophet and speaking them they'll perform just like we read the word of God in the scripture this word is a is was the word for our day to deliver a faith and I'm excited to be able to have a message that we can listen to that we can go back that's been transcribed and we can absolutely catch it in the life and the anointing that it was meant to be in amen um perfect faith is the master of all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all C circumstance no matter what it is it Masters it now just watch when you believe in anything do anything and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it see it Masters that circumstance so there's always something that has to be in opposition to Faith otherwise faith is not being it's not pleasing right so there's a there's a way that your faith is pleasing and that's because there has to be a circumstance there has to be something that is trying the faith amen but faith is the master of the circumstance and Faith In Love is relation because you can't have faith unless you got love that that is an incredible statement you can't have faith unless you got love we know that I if I have not charity I be I'm nothing right so we could go back and we can go through that the stature of the perfect man really captures that what what those what those virtues are of the spirit but without love you don't have anything there's nothing zero am as much as you can understand the message that you could be a theologian that you could have wisdom that you can have uh diligence in in a lot of things if you've lost the love of God you've actually lost the faith and that's incredible you know we know what the charge was they lost their first love you know the love and faith are not you can't separate them because we don't have a head faith we have a heart Faith the Gentiles did things by the spirit with the word of God written on our heart that the Jews couldn't do by fulfilling the law they Marvel when they saw that here's Gentiles doing by Nature the things written in the law that they exercised that they tried to make themselves perfect in they were genuinely trying to reflect a holy God by the exercising of Law and now here's the Infidel the people who didn't they weren't schooled doing by Nature the things that were reflecting the very life of God because they had had a love had come into their life God had revealed himself to them and if that love is not effectual in our life then what good's the salt for what good is what was it what you know the very things that were believing in and professing to believe if the love of God is not shed forth in our life then it's become of none effect your faith is is is without works the greatest work is to love Faith and love works together here just like a young couple you take a young man a young woman and they love they fall in love with one another and as they go along and begin to know one another their hearts just begin to beat as one amen you know this is the mystery of Christ in the church There's A Love Affair that's going on that we're we're being made into His Image we're bone of his bone amen see they're not husband and wife but they love binds them together and they have confidence in one another now if they really love another really love and you know that this girl loves you and she knows that you love her You've Got Confidence faith in one another if you got faith in one another if you didn't you better not marry her y you know love cast out fear you know that was one of the first questions I had you know as a as a young man having had had experience with the Lord as I got older you know what's love now I know I'd experienced it when I had met the Lord I knew that was real yeah I knew that was love but now I've got all these things that are testifying to that's not a fruit that I know jealousy yeah you know uh lack of peace a lack of confidence but but that's supposed to be love it's tainted right we understand Satan can't create he's a perverter and you know we understand Agape we understand Philly we understand it it just funnels all down and at the at the very bottom you have murder right I mean it it's true you got people who will kill a man out of jealousy and they'll call it love brother Bram said that's not it that's not it but it's their faith it's their love and they put it in the wrong thing notice you got to have faith and you separate them and put one extreme South and one extreme North and they'll and there still that love beats for one another no matter what they're at where they're at and you know that's the other thing love does I mean this is speaking of a separation that love persists but love separates right for this cause a man will father and mother and cleave to his wife right love also causes a separation it it did so in the Life of Christ and it will do so in your life if you love the Lord it will cause a separation it causes a separation from unbelief it causes a separation from the things that you know are not pleasing to him right we we do things by love not by law and there's enough to fall in love with he's the a lovely one he's the lily of the valley there's none like him the works of his hands I mean you look around you see the lives that he's touched the things that could have been ruined that the devil sought to destroy and there's people sitting in here tonight praising the Lord that they've been freed from bondage yes we love the Lord in the works of his hands there's none like them there should be a praise that's emanating from the bride of Christ you know there's no one can worship him like you can he doesn't want to hear someone else's love song he doesn't want to hear a nominal believer's praise it's not acceptable worship they don't even know who he is in vain they do worship me and I know that's tough to say but I don't mean to tear them down what I'm wanted you to understand is how precious you are you know that's the that's the other trick if the devil can make you think that uh you're not called out and you're not separate he tries to make you think you're like everybody else he's a he's a he's a ly balum y we are called out we are separate we are the elect We There is a we do things out of love that maybe others don't feel compelled to do right I I'm not condemning you for that but my love's greater my love's higher my love calls for a separation my love calls for a higher praise yes it that love beats it causes an effect it's not passive yes and if you love the Lord just not trying to dodge hell but you love the Lord then you have faith in God see if you love him like a young girl just happened here in lville not long ago a woman she was she fell in love with this man he had been a Christian a couple years or so got married I love the story I some of you know where I'm going but this story still means a lot to me because it shows a love that's that is pure right they loved and had confidence in one another and they got married and so the woman said to the man hubby it's been hard on you you're just a young Christian you've had so much to go through with drinking and all that she said you've had so much to go through and I know you're bound to be tempted awfully hard and said I want you to know one thing now if you happen to fall if you happen to fall into temptation and and is overcome don't stay away from home you come on back you come right here CU I'm going to be right here waiting for you I'm going to help him pray you through again until you get Victory we believe in Victory I'm going to stay with you because when I married you I married you because I loved you and no matter what you are I still love you few days after that he was eating his lunch with the fellows down in the boiler room he was telling them about it he said now how could a man ever do anything wrong when somebody loves you like that you know the the fear of displeasing the Lord became really worlded me I didn't want to do anything that would cause his presence to leave it's the greatest thing I've ever known and yet he promised to never leave me never forsake me and though I may not feel that he's there he's given me a word that he is right we do things we ought not to do because we don't recognize his presence he's there he's present he's never left you and how could a man ever do anything wrong when somebody loves you like that see there you are How Could You trespass that confidence and when we were Sinners alienated without God in the world in the muck in the mud and I talked this morning God come to us God sought you never you never sought God no man come to me except the father draws him and God come down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and look what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised you real genuine love will create a confidence in his word he caught me when I was nothing I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand see he caught me amen we can know this God real in our lives but he doesn't want you to put confidence still in anything other than his word without faith it's impossible to please God If he if he wanted it other if you and I say that cuz you could try to rest in the emotion don't don't one of the mo earliest experiences I had as a Believer was God teaching me that if you go by sensation and you go by emotion it'll take you anywhere if it's contrary to the word you don't believe it um listen now now think of this this is in that message brother brandham says this he says if any vision is contrary to the word leave it alone it Thank God now think of a prophet of God who God has come to many times and showed him thus saith the Lord through a vision it is it was just as good as finished when he seen the vision he just had to sit there and watch the vision play out and he could have a faith and a confidence that it was the will of God right but supercharged Faith we've been you know think of Thomas now and what he was he said blessed are they who believed right because they've received the word you have the opportunity to be pleasing to God by taking a man's word you may never see a vision yeah but a vision contrary to the word is still not the a place to rest the best place you can rest is in the word of God Amen there is no other place to rest besides the word of God so if you've received a perfect word then it's delivered a perfect Faith how do I know because a Vindicated Prophet came in our day and I've received the message I've received the end time word I believe it how he's given me the faith he's given me the ear to hear that's it now God will Quicken that in signs and wonders and miracles they're performed but if you ever put the confidence in those things you're putting the confidence in the creation more than the Creator and they'll pass away there's a time when healing ceases There's No more healing needed now the healer's still there the man who the god that had the attribute of healer is eternal yes and you can know him as healer you can know him as Savior and you can know him and all the things that he would desire to reveal to you I believe that's the promise we have I trust the Lord's been good to you we um want everybody to come to know the love of the Lord but even in all those things if you want to be pleasing to the Lord all you have to do is believe his word he's not he I I read it it struck me um Lord willing I could find it he says there's nothing else for us to do yeah right it's a finished work there's all we have to do is believe I mean Lord that's all I have to do and that's pleasing to you now I know without works I know those things I'm not I'm not saying there's not works that are manifested but it's out of a love and it's out of a faith that's in a a perfect word and that's pleasing to him because if you did works and it wasn't the right life behind it it wouldn't please them you've just put confidence in your Works doesn't please them you know none of us have works that are not being done better by someone else yeah right good I mean really and as soon as you are the best there's someone coming after you that's going to do it better very good so we're not but we are resting in a perfect work a perfect work that was finished at Calvary and a and and uh our part is to believe yes and that that's enough God bless you let's Stand Together
