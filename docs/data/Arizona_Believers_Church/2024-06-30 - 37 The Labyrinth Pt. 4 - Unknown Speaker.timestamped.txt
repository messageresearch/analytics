[0:00] this is our 37th service on the house of
[0:03] the Lord I know you're all keeping count
[0:04] so you're already right there with us uh
[0:07] this is part four on the Labyrinth I
[0:09] feel that there's um just something that
[0:11] we may be clenching down today that will
[0:15] um help us to maybe move on to some of
[0:16] these other things that the Lord has
[0:17] dealt with us in our hearts but this
[0:19] subject of the labyrinth fits in with
[0:22] what my burden was and how the Lord's
[0:23] been dealing with me on the house of the
[0:25] Lord how it applies to us as individuals
[0:27] applies to our homes it applies to us as
[0:29] a church
[0:30] and so there's a lot of ways that you
[0:32] can make this practical there's a lot of
[0:33] ways that you can uh take certain
[0:35] principles even in this thought and
[0:37] apply them to your personal lives uh
[0:38] your home life it's certainly a
[0:40] direction to us as a church and there's
[0:44] a lot of things that will mention today
[0:47] that we've mentioned before and I'd like
[0:49] to point out that if you're able to uh
[0:52] look back you'll see that there's a lot
[0:54] of themes that we've been covering
[0:55] through these many services that are
[0:57] surfacing today so this is built on a
[1:00] pretty large foundation and especially
[1:03] Wednesday night uh we didn't take a long
[1:05] time but we went through certain things
[1:07] just showing what Simplicity meant and
[1:09] how that in the garden it was this
[1:11] Simplicity that the devil corrupted
[1:13] we'll come to that for a little bit and
[1:15] expound on it a little bit deeper and
[1:17] how that Temptations those Temptations
[1:19] in the garden and then with Jesus Christ
[1:22] in the wilderness uh were right there
[1:25] together that they were uh kind of
[1:26] overlapping with one another and now in
[1:31] 2 Corinthians we've just read it and
[1:33] Paul is saying if you'll just bear with
[1:34] me well let me just uh clarify very
[1:37] quickly on one thing because I don't
[1:38] know if we'll we won't be reading
[1:40] through some of these statements but on
[1:41] the Labyrinth when we use that term the
[1:42] Labyrinth it's we're using it as brother
[1:44] brandham used it in the church age book
[1:46] when he was writing com from commus is
[1:49] uh one thing needful or one thing
[1:52] necessary and and he uses the term
[1:54] Labyrinth we'll read it here in just a
[1:55] moment uh from that book but or from the
[1:59] one thing necessary but he uses this
[2:00] term and how he goes over this page and
[2:02] a half he's talking about a mass of
[2:05] confusion uh people the politics and the
[2:08] fighting and the Really pointing out the
[2:10] failure of Christianity how all these
[2:12] different voices and everyone fighting
[2:13] one another and uh and and Christ being
[2:16] left out of all of it who is the one
[2:18] thing necessary so when we use this term
[2:20] the Labyrinth uh it is it is using it in
[2:23] the same way that brother I believe
[2:24] brother brandham pointed it out in the
[2:26] church age book so here in 2 Corinthians
[2:28] chap 11 as PA is saying if you could
[2:30] bear with me a little in my Folly he
[2:32] says I'm jealous over you it's a Godly
[2:35] jealousy and this Godly jealousy
[2:37] provokes this fear so it's a Godly fear
[2:40] as well in the sense that he's not
[2:41] overcome with some evil thought he's not
[2:44] possessed uh with an ungodly uh emotion
[2:48] but rather his love has led him to have
[2:50] this Zeal to recognize that there's this
[2:52] potential for error and he uses quite a
[2:55] statement that as I have espoused you to
[2:58] Christ I would like like for you to come
[3:01] to this Union with him uh undefiled and
[3:05] pure and so he's warning of the
[3:08] Antichrist spirit that would that would
[3:10] defile the believer's mind now that we
[3:13] should put ourselves in that that
[3:15] channel that these he feared that as the
[3:17] serpent beguiled Eve he would defile the
[3:19] believer's mind so we're taking
[3:21] instruction from this for ourselves to
[3:23] recognize that yes we need to be
[3:26] steadfast we we we need to watch how the
[3:28] devil's trying to defile our own mind
[3:30] we read in Galatians chap 1 how that uh
[3:33] Paul writes and he warns of uh Christ
[3:37] being perverted the word of Christ being
[3:39] perverted and how that in perverting
[3:42] Christ it would defile the church and
[3:44] we're find we see he speaks of that in
[3:46] Galatians chapter 1 and he writes this
[3:48] in the church age book and we can find
[3:50] this in John's letters as well but he
[3:52] writes now remember this Christ in the
[3:55] true church is a continuation of the
[3:57] book of Acts right if it's not the true
[4:00] church it can't be a continuation of the
[4:03] book of Acts if it's not Christ in the
[4:05] true church it can't be a continuation
[4:06] of the book of Acts so if you are the
[4:08] true church unless it's Christ in you it
[4:11] can't be a continuation of the book of
[4:12] Acts what we can be tempted to do as a
[4:15] true church is write her own
[4:18] book and called the acts of the true
[4:20] church when in fact the acts of the the
[4:23] true church in the beginning was the
[4:24] acts of the Holy Spirit through the
[4:26] Believers and in in the true church so
[4:29] there's so much that goes in this right
[4:31] in another book of Acts and it's not
[4:33] just that we would do the same things
[4:35] they did but it would be the Holy Spirit
[4:36] acting through US Christ in the true
[4:38] church is a continuation of the book of
[4:40] Acts but what's the barrier to this
[4:44] continuation of the book of Acts The
[4:46] Book of Revelation shows how the that
[4:49] the Antichrist Spirit would come into
[4:51] the church and defile it making it
[4:55] lukewarm formal and Powerless so the
[4:58] Antichrist Spirit desires to defile and
[5:01] to defile scripturally at least in the
[5:02] New Testament with the Greek word and
[5:04] kind of the the Jewish idea of
[5:06] defilement is anything to the slightest
[5:08] degree that God requires perfection in
[5:11] worship and there were certain details
[5:13] that needed to be observed and so
[5:14] defilement especially if you look at it
[5:16] in the context of the law was just to
[5:18] the slightest degree there wasn't this
[5:20] spectrum to say well that's that's not
[5:22] right that's not right but now it's
[5:23] officially wrong it's that in the
[5:25] slightest degree so Satan is looking to
[5:28] defile Us in the slightest degree and
[5:31] the Book of Revelation shows that the
[5:32] Antichrist spirit is Desiring to defile
[5:36] the church and make it lukewarm formal
[5:39] and Powerless amen a and that's to to
[5:44] defile the our minds corrupt our minds
[5:47] and the Simplicity that is in Christ so
[5:50] that Christ cannot have the preeminence
[5:52] in the true church and continue his work
[5:55] in the Believers as we would recognize
[5:57] that's what the continuation of the book
[5:59] of Acts would be
[6:00] brother bham draws from this statement
[6:02] from comenius and his Unum necessarium
[6:05] he says in short all the things of
[6:07] Christians have become a labyrinth so as
[6:10] the Antichrist Spirit and the Book of
[6:12] Revelation warned it begins to work
[6:15] within the church and now we get to the
[6:17] 17th century and sure enough all of
[6:20] Christianity the things of Christians
[6:22] have become a maze elaborate a dungeon a
[6:25] a wondering mess to where you end up in
[6:27] death faith has been cut up into a
[6:29] thousand of minute
[6:31] articles faith has been distilled down
[6:33] to laws and cannons and all sorts of of
[6:37] rules and regulations and If you deny
[6:39] one of these you are a
[6:41] heretic now certainly we can see that
[6:43] this is so with the Catholic church and
[6:45] as this begins to permeate amongst the
[6:46] daughters that they had their their
[6:48] Cannon their catechism the things that
[6:50] they believed to be uh the way that
[6:52] things should be done and it didn't
[6:53] necessarily have to have root in
[6:55] scripture but they had come under this
[6:58] uh spirit to say this is what we believe
[7:01] and If you deny anything that we believe
[7:02] you're a heretic and if we look at it
[7:04] historically I think I just almost did
[7:06] the Trump accordion if you look at it
[7:08] historically it's why you shouldn't
[7:09] watch debates if you look at
[7:13] it if you look at it historically you'll
[7:16] find that the church actually if they
[7:18] considered you a heretic they would just
[7:20] kill
[7:21] you and so this is what um one of the
[7:24] things comenius is looking at in short
[7:26] all things of Christians have become
[7:27] elaborate faith has been cut up in a
[7:29] bunch of things that you have to accept
[7:31] or you become a her heretic then it
[7:33] becomes more than just religion or going
[7:35] to church on Sunday life has been
[7:37] divided into a thousand matters of
[7:39] conscience and if you don't keep all of
[7:41] these your Scruples are
[7:44] questioned they there's doubt about your
[7:48] experience they want to uh provoke
[7:50] questions in your mind or provoke doubt
[7:52] that if you don't keep all of these
[7:54] thousands matters of conscience then you
[7:56] must not be a Christian you must not be
[7:57] a believer you must not do this you must
[7:58] not have that and so these are questions
[8:01] of doubt that arise from man-made
[8:03] Traditions man-made divisions it's not
[8:06] that uh commenius would be arguing that
[8:08] if one uh rejected the existence of God
[8:12] uh that you shouldn't question their
[8:13] Scruples we go to the Bible and find
[8:15] that only a fool would deny God that if
[8:18] you were to be baptized in the name of
[8:19] the Lord Jesus Christ and someone says
[8:21] well you know the Bible says to be
[8:23] baptized this way and and you're causing
[8:25] doubt and causing questions commenius
[8:27] wouldn't be trying to draw you away from
[8:29] obedience to the word of God he's just
[8:31] saying it's become something completely
[8:33] different than what it was intended or
[8:35] Christ was left out of it so brother bam
[8:37] says what can help only the one thing
[8:40] needful return to Christ looking to
[8:42] Christ is the only leader in walking in
[8:45] his footsteps setting aside all other
[8:47] ways until we all reach the goal and
[8:49] have come to the unity of the faith as
[8:53] the Heavenly Master Built everything on
[8:54] the ground of the scripture so should we
[8:56] leave all particularities of our special
[8:59] confession and be satisfied with the
[9:01] revealed word of God which belongs to us
[9:04] all so there are certain unique or
[9:08] peculiar uh understandings or teachings
[9:11] or maybe special confessions that
[9:13] comenius is referencing and brother
[9:14] brandham is quoting from that have been
[9:17] Christianity's been broken up into not
[9:20] necessarily distilled down to and
[9:22] reduced down to but expanded into
[9:24] thousands of matters of conscience
[9:26] thousands of minute articles a and all
[9:28] these things in the mind and in the
[9:30] conscience trying to rationalize trying
[9:32] to accept trying to agree with and so it
[9:35] the question is how do we get through
[9:37] this Christ Christ is the only way out
[9:40] of the labyrinth Christ is the only one
[9:42] that can can help us and so return to
[9:44] Christ look to Christ alone as your
[9:46] leader walk in his footsteps set aside
[9:49] all of their ways until you reach the
[9:51] goal and as Christ our Heavenly Master
[9:54] Built everything on scripture as he was
[9:57] when he was tempted in the wilderness
[9:59] we've been looking at that it is written
[10:00] it is written it is written he says we
[10:02] should leave all the particularities of
[10:04] our special confessions and be satisfied
[10:08] with the revealed word of God which
[10:10] belongs to us all as it is revealed to
[10:13] you it's
[10:14] yours the word of God it we would even
[10:17] say this is the Inspire the Bible is the
[10:18] inspired word of God it's
[10:21] yours now Paul says as the serpent
[10:23] beguiled Eve in the garden he did it
[10:26] from and we're going to look back at
[10:27] this in detail he did it from the
[10:30] Simplicity he he beguiled Eve in the
[10:33] garden from the Simplicity of
[10:36] God and the paradise of God represented
[10:40] this is some just connecting back to
[10:41] Wednesday night it represented the
[10:43] liberty and and the the
[10:45] bountifulness uh and the Simplicity that
[10:47] is in Christ so Paul is saying as the
[10:49] serpent beguiled Eve from the Simplicity
[10:52] that is in Christ it's not so much just
[10:54] the mechanics of Deceit but rather we
[10:56] could go back to and look at the Garden
[10:59] of Eden and see that there was
[11:01] Simplicity that Paul was talking about
[11:03] even there in the garden Simplicity
[11:06] means it's not compounded it's not over
[11:08] complicated it's not needlessly complex
[11:11] the garden was not needlessly complex
[11:13] there were complexities and intricacies
[11:15] in in creation and it wasn't just
[11:18] looking at says well this is this is
[11:19] really uh mundane but no it was
[11:21] beautiful it was ordinate it was
[11:22] gorgeous but yet life wasn't needlessly
[11:25] complex notice that in the beginning God
[11:28] didn't give them all the laws that the
[11:29] Jews
[11:30] got right life was a lot much more
[11:33] simple and it wasn't compounded or over
[11:35] complicated Simplicity refers to folds
[11:38] to where something has been folded up so
[11:40] that it's lost its meaning or it's lost
[11:42] its wholeness and it can also or it is
[11:45] also translated to bountifulness or
[11:47] liberality we looked in the scriptures
[11:49] and saw that how Paul used this term
[11:52] Simplicity to say he that gives let him
[11:54] give in
[11:55] Simplicity and that there is a and your
[11:57] Simplicity in giving as he commended the
[11:59] Believers it speaks of bountifulness or
[12:02] liberality so Simplicity it's not that
[12:05] well I only gave a dollar or it wasn't
[12:08] uh it was very a straightforward uh
[12:10] transaction it just it speaks to some
[12:13] Liberty in a person's Spirit where
[12:15] they're not motivated by other factors
[12:17] other than the true word of God or the
[12:19] inspiration of the Holy Ghost and that
[12:21] their actions match their heart a a and
[12:23] their heart matches their actions and so
[12:25] it means they're not
[12:28] hypocritical in they're giving they
[12:29] weren't self-seeking there was this
[12:31] openness of heart that Paul's talking
[12:33] about that manifest itself in generosity
[12:35] where this Simplicity of you're giving
[12:38] now when you think think of it this way
[12:39] I think this will help that if someone
[12:41] was to give you something and I think we
[12:43] always find this that someone says here
[12:45] I want you to have this and we're like
[12:49] thank you I've always wanted a million
[12:51] dollars in cash and you're just and then
[12:54] if we've lived a little bit all of a
[12:56] sudden we go what's the catch is this
[12:58] fake am I on camera what's what's going
[13:01] on you don't it's not just simply
[13:03] someone trying to give you something
[13:05] what's in it for them and this is what
[13:06] economics has been reduced to that if
[13:09] there's something you've been offered
[13:10] and you're getting something in the
[13:12] marketplace you have to recognize that
[13:14] nobody's doing you a favor in you a
[13:17] favor alone they're probably doing
[13:19] themselves a favor yes you may be
[13:21] getting a deal but they're probably
[13:22] getting a better deal or it works within
[13:25] their scheme of trying to meet their own
[13:27] needs and satisfy themselves and so the
[13:30] Simplicity removes that from the
[13:31] equation to where whatever is being
[13:34] offered is being done in sincerity not
[13:36] self-seeking not a trick not a trap and
[13:39] this is what the Simplicity that is in
[13:41] Christ is where Christ isn't reduced to
[13:43] a maze to where you're afraid that if
[13:45] you walk through the wrong door you're
[13:46] going to fall into a trap that if you
[13:48] make the wrong step you're going to be
[13:49] banished to hell it's not that's not the
[13:51] way the gospel should be
[13:54] presented so Simplicity is this uh
[13:57] without pretense where there's something
[13:59] behind it there's there's Pride or
[14:01] hypocrisy it's not a mixed signal like I
[14:04] love you I just want you to have this
[14:06] only to come to find out that there was
[14:07] something else attached to that you're
[14:09] being asked of something behind that so
[14:12] it's not inconsistent or contradictory
[14:14] to what appears uh uh to be what God
[14:18] what that the action should be
[14:21] suggesting now Genesis chapter 3: 4 and
[14:24] 5 says and the serpent said unto the
[14:26] woman ye shall not surely die she said
[14:29] that if we God hath said it is written
[14:32] we can put it that way God has said that
[14:34] if the day that we eat of this tree we
[14:38] should not eat nor should we touch it
[14:40] because the day we eat we will die and
[14:43] so Satan says ye shall not surely die
[14:46] now there's just a direct contradiction
[14:49] to the word of God and had he left it at
[14:51] that just to say you now you won't die
[14:54] you you won't you won't die then she
[14:56] would have let's just kind of
[14:59] hypothesize in in this theoretical
[15:02] argument that if he just says you're not
[15:04] going to die that the conversation ends
[15:08] he told me I wasn't going to die uh or I
[15:11] was going to die you're telling me I'm
[15:13] not I'll just go with what God says but
[15:15] what the devil has to do then is he has
[15:17] to find some way for her to question her
[15:20] faith or question her Scruples or or
[15:23] cause some doubt and what better way to
[15:25] cause doubt than to question the
[15:27] character of the one who said you would
[15:29] die and how is it that he does that he
[15:32] says God for God does know so he's
[15:35] saying that God consciously told you
[15:38] something with the in it said something
[15:41] to you that God knew when he told you
[15:43] that you would die this is what he was
[15:45] thinking that in the day you eat thereof
[15:48] you wouldn't actually die but your eyes
[15:51] would be open and you would be as God's
[15:54] knowing good and
[15:55] evil so the devil not only twists the
[15:59] word by saying you won't die he says God
[16:03] doth know so he's misinterpreted the
[16:06] character of God he's misinterpreted the
[16:09] intent of God that God would say
[16:11] something to you and ask you to do
[16:13] something but in that sense he's lying
[16:16] he's saying that God lied to her and
[16:18] that God lied to her and and I want you
[16:20] to catch this he lied to her out of his
[16:23] own pretense right he lied to her out of
[16:26] his own Pride because he was wanting to
[16:29] withhold something from the woman so
[16:31] that she couldn't be like
[16:34] him so it would be one thing but God
[16:36] said listen uh if you eat this you're
[16:39] going to die and the reason you're going
[16:40] to die is you're going to know things
[16:41] you shouldn't know and things are going
[16:42] to happen it's going to defile things
[16:44] and he lays it all out there he just
[16:45] says the day you eat at least the way
[16:47] it's represented scripture and in the
[16:49] way that the woman answers back so I
[16:51] believe though some remains in symbolic
[16:54] form it conveys the Simplicity of God's
[16:57] prohibition and the woman's
[16:59] understanding of it and how the devil
[17:01] complicated it by saying no yeah
[17:04] whatever God lied you will not die and
[17:07] it's not just disagreeing with the word
[17:10] but now it's to question God's
[17:12] motivation in telling her that she would
[17:15] as if God was trying to keep her from
[17:17] something that God intentionally and
[17:20] with premeditation lied to
[17:24] her and in doing so what did it
[17:26] naturally do it confused her
[17:30] whoa whoa hold on God said if we eat it
[17:33] we'll die but what you're telling me is
[17:35] that if we do if if in this in this
[17:39] partaking I'll actually become more like
[17:41] him and it made it this
[17:45] confusion and who knows if it's not this
[17:47] thought of well maybe what he he's
[17:49] actually wanting me to figure this out
[17:51] or maybe maybe this was a test to find
[17:53] out if we really wanted to be like him
[17:55] and it all of a sudden becomes this
[17:57] massive confusion and one the seed had
[17:59] been swn into her mind it led to the
[18:04] act now the garden at this point had
[18:07] been a
[18:08] sanctuary it is where God dwelt with the
[18:13] man and the woman it was Heaven on Earth
[18:15] is how we've represented it and in this
[18:18] moment through Satan twisting the
[18:20] woman's mind about the intent and and
[18:22] the the the character of God the result
[18:26] in chapter 3 says in verse 23 therefore
[18:28] the the Lord God sent him man forth from
[18:31] the Garden of Eden now he's been cast
[18:33] out of the Garden of Eden to till the
[18:35] ground from whence he was taken so he
[18:38] drove out the man he sends them forth
[18:40] and then drives them out he's leaving
[18:43] the Garden of Eden this paradise this
[18:45] Sanctuary this particular place that the
[18:47] Bible says that he made and there he
[18:50] placed the man in it to work and to till
[18:53] and to be there with the woman and to
[18:55] bring forth and and to have dominion he
[18:58] placed at the east of the Garden of Eden
[19:01] cherubs now catch this great symbols in
[19:04] this and a flaming sword which turned
[19:06] every way to keep the way of the tree of
[19:10] life so there was a keeping of the way
[19:13] of the tree of life the way the life the
[19:15] knowledge the truth there's there's this
[19:17] protection and this guard uh guarding
[19:20] and we recognize the way of the tree of
[19:22] life isn't just a literal path to a
[19:24] literal tree that was now somehow hidden
[19:27] and it was a secret chamber that that
[19:28] you could try to you tried to find in a
[19:30] side quest no it's the way of the Tree
[19:32] of Life Christ that was was veiled there
[19:36] was something that dropped down and man
[19:38] no longer had access to the
[19:40] sanctuary so man is driven out of the
[19:43] presence of God in the garden Christ is
[19:46] being represented this cherubims
[19:48] guarding the way to keep the way of the
[19:50] tree of life and I'm using this word
[19:53] sanctuary and and I fail to recall right
[19:55] now just how much we might have
[19:57] developed this in the past and talking
[19:59] about the Garden of Eden but a sanctuary
[20:01] is a consecrated place is a place of
[20:03] rest a place of Refuge a place of
[20:05] protection and and that's what Sanctuary
[20:08] ought to represent we call this the
[20:10] sanctuary and it being the sanctuary
[20:12] that we want to conduct ourselves in a
[20:14] certain way we call it the sanctuary
[20:16] because we believe the presence of God
[20:17] visits us here should be a place of
[20:19] Refuge it should be a place of
[20:21] protection it's a consecrated place and
[20:25] God when he made the Earth and then made
[20:26] the Garden in and then place man in the
[20:29] Garden of Eden this paradise it was a
[20:31] sanctuary in which God would come down
[20:34] and he dwelt with his creation but now
[20:37] as man is driven out of the garden and
[20:39] there's chair bums that are there with
[20:41] the Flaming sword to turn away to guard
[20:44] to keep to keep out anyone from the way
[20:47] of the Tree of Life the Earth was no
[20:49] longer a sanctuary for the Creator and
[20:53] the
[20:55] created now with that image in mind
[20:59] let me connect it back to the house of
[21:01] the Lord we've gone through a great
[21:03] detail in some of the things that we've
[21:04] ministered on this to see that the house
[21:06] of the Lord represented Heaven and Earth
[21:09] that it was made in the image and the
[21:10] pattern of the Heavenly sanctuary in
[21:13] Exodus chapter
[21:15] 25:8 and let them make me a sanctuary
[21:18] that I may dwell among them in making of
[21:21] the sanctuary it was structured in a
[21:23] very particular way you had the outer
[21:26] Court you had the inner court and the
[21:27] holy PL uh uh the and the holy of holies
[21:31] and there in that holy of holies you
[21:33] would see this image in this uh of
[21:36] Heaven because now it's sealed from view
[21:39] then outer Court you would come in a
[21:40] veil and you'd have this inner court but
[21:42] then heaven was a veil and only one
[21:45] person could enter in behind that so
[21:46] there's this representation of Heaven
[21:48] and Earth and these different and this
[21:51] uh the creation of the temple and in
[21:55] that innermost room it was the the holy
[21:58] of holies the Oracle the holy uh the
[22:01] holiest of all and that was where God
[22:05] dwelt you remember these things and we
[22:07] and just from your teaching not just
[22:08] from here but in teaching in Exodus
[22:11] 25:22 it's talking about this mercy seat
[22:14] and this place he says and there I will
[22:16] meet with thee in the Oracle in the most
[22:18] holy place in the holiest of all in that
[22:21] most inner chamber there I will meet
[22:23] with thee this is the sanctuary where he
[22:26] would dwell there I will meet with thee
[22:28] and I will commune with thee from Above
[22:29] The Mercy Seat from between the two
[22:33] cherubims which are upon the Ark of the
[22:35] testimony of all things which I'll give
[22:37] thee in the Commandment unto the
[22:39] children of Israel notice how now we see
[22:42] this very image of the cherubs that were
[22:44] there with flaming swords to keep the
[22:46] way of the tree of life that place where
[22:49] God would have met mankind this
[22:50] representation of being banished from
[22:52] the Garden of Eden and cherums are
[22:54] placed there with flaming swords to keep
[22:56] the way of the Garden of Eden and now
[22:59] God represents this in the very Oracle
[23:02] in the most holy place in the holiest of
[23:04] all that between the cherubims there
[23:06] will his presence be his shakina will
[23:08] come to commune with
[23:11] Israel Psalms 80 ver1 says Thou that
[23:14] leadest Joseph like a flock oh Shepherd
[23:17] of Israel thou that dwelleth dwellest
[23:19] between the
[23:21] cherubims so this became now a
[23:23] representation of where God dwelt at one
[23:26] time he would have dwelt between the man
[23:28] and the woman
[23:29] in the Garden of Eden but now
[23:32] symbolically in this Most Holy place he
[23:34] would dwell between the two
[23:37] cherubs and the house of the Lord and
[23:39] its function this is again just a lot of
[23:41] review and its different functions and
[23:43] its services and its elements and its
[23:45] utensils the house of the Lord and all
[23:47] these things and those that worshiped
[23:49] those that sacrificed in the manner of
[23:51] worship and sacrifice symbolized and
[23:53] represented Jesus
[23:55] Christ in Hebrews chapter 9: 6 to 12 now
[23:59] when these things were thus ordained the
[24:00] priest went away into the first
[24:02] Tabernacle accomplishing the service of
[24:04] God but into the second now when he says
[24:07] the the first Tabernacle there's your
[24:08] inner court but now he is your your most
[24:11] inner Court your holy of holies but in
[24:12] the second went the high priest alone
[24:14] once a year not without blood which he
[24:16] offered for himself and for The Heirs of
[24:18] the people the Holy Ghost this
[24:21] signifying that the way into the holiest
[24:23] of all was not yet made manifest the
[24:26] fact that only one man had the right to
[24:28] enter in with blood being shed and and
[24:31] offering for himself and the HS of the
[24:33] people the Holy Ghost in commanding this
[24:35] and doing this was signifying that the
[24:37] way into the hly of all was not yet made
[24:39] manifest it was not open it was not
[24:42] revealed while as the first Tabernacle
[24:45] was yet standing yes which was a figure
[24:49] what what are all these Tabernacles for
[24:50] what are these rooms what are these
[24:51] divisions what are a structure
[24:53] for it was a figure for the time then
[24:56] present it was a symbol for them at that
[24:59] time in which were offered both gifts
[25:01] and sacrifices that could not make him
[25:03] that did the service perfect as
[25:04] pertaining to the conscience which stood
[25:06] only in meats and drinks and diverse
[25:08] Washings and carnal ordinances imposed
[25:10] on them until the time of
[25:12] reformation and then so that that that's
[25:15] the mouthful I want would love to just
[25:16] be able to for it to just amplify in
[25:18] your mind immediately think the temple
[25:20] the Tabernacle the house of the Lord its
[25:23] worship its ordinances its Washings all
[25:25] those things were for a symbol
[25:28] for the time to come verse 11 but Christ
[25:32] being come a high priest of good things
[25:34] to come so now here the Holy Ghost once
[25:36] signified that the way hadn't been made
[25:38] but now Christ is the way he is the
[25:41] truth he is the life amen he is the tree
[25:43] of life we could say Christ become a
[25:46] high priest of good things to come by a
[25:47] greater and more perfect Tabernacle than
[25:50] the first or the second or this layout
[25:51] of the house of the Lord not made with
[25:53] hands that is to say not of this
[25:55] building not of this Tabernacle nor of
[25:58] the Tabernacle and the Wilderness or the
[26:01] Temple of Solomon or Ezekiel you name it
[26:03] none of those temples neither by Blood
[26:05] of goats and calves but by his own blood
[26:08] he entered into it entered in once into
[26:11] the holy Place having obtained Eternal
[26:13] Redemption for
[26:15] us so Christ was foreshadowed and
[26:18] symbolized and represented in Temple
[26:21] worship he was he was being pointed to
[26:24] figured signified in all these different
[26:27] ways that uh uh worship was conducted in
[26:30] the house of the Lord the high priest
[26:31] the lamb the atonement all spoke of
[26:33] Christ it all spoke of a greater
[26:37] Covenant and and so there God this is uh
[26:41] I just feel like maybe I just placed a
[26:43] box and I want to step back and look at
[26:45] them together in the beginning the
[26:47] Garden of Eden was a paradise it was a
[26:50] sanctuary where God dwelt between the
[26:53] man and the woman and it was it was
[26:56] perfection
[26:58] it was God it was God's creation and
[27:02] then man is driven away and there's
[27:04] cherub bums keeping the way of the tree
[27:07] of life and man is thrust out into a
[27:10] labyrinth he's Thrust out into the world
[27:11] he's going to have to fend for himself
[27:13] and things have vastly changed and that
[27:16] certainly is an
[27:17] understatement and I was uh commented
[27:22] the last year at some point I was I was
[27:25] fat and Jack said that's an
[27:26] understatement and uh we've never let
[27:29] him live it down and what he meant was
[27:31] that's an overstatement but he said it's
[27:32] an understatement and it's lived it's
[27:34] it's
[27:35] lived he's trying to go to come to my
[27:37] defense and he just threw me under the
[27:40] bus but that may be it may be
[27:43] understated to say life life had vastly
[27:46] changed but I'm wanting you to see that
[27:48] now God in trying to bring the
[27:50] Reformation or God trying to bring
[27:52] Redemption and bring man back to what he
[27:54] had lost he starts signifying his divine
[27:57] presence among on his people through the
[28:00] Tabernacle in the wilderness and the
[28:01] temple or the house The Dwelling Place
[28:04] the sanctuary of the Lord dwelling
[28:06] between the two cherubims so the garden
[28:09] and the house of the Lord are the place
[28:11] of God's presence it's where the word is
[28:14] represented where Christ is represented
[28:16] it's what the Holy Ghost was signifying
[28:19] that Christ would make a way for for us
[28:21] to be back into fellowship with God in
[28:23] his
[28:25] presence now I'd like for you to think
[28:27] of it this way
[28:28] that the house of the Lord the the
[28:31] garden and the life that exist in the
[28:32] beginning was not a labyrinth nor was
[28:34] the house of the Lord a labyrinth if we
[28:36] looked at the house of the Lord and
[28:37] though there was carnal ordinances and
[28:39] meats and drinks and diverse Washings
[28:41] and there's a lot of things that
[28:42] pertained to it in its structure just as
[28:45] the Garden of Eden was very ornate and
[28:47] there's a lot of beautiful complexities
[28:48] the house of the Lord the same way but
[28:50] yet it was very it's simply
[28:53] structured it was very straightforward
[28:56] and it was established to bring glory to
[28:58] God it was established uh to bring God's
[29:01] presence it was established to have the
[29:02] shakina glory amongst Israel now that's
[29:05] what the Temple of the house of the Lord
[29:06] should have been but in Matthew 21:13
[29:09] and he said unto them it is written my
[29:10] house shall be called The House of
[29:12] Prayer but ye have made it a den of
[29:16] Thieves this is what the house of the
[29:19] Lord had become if you look at the
[29:21] temple in the days of Herod my what an
[29:23] incredible structure it had become as
[29:25] God had originally had Solomon build it
[29:27] in it simp licity of an outer court and
[29:30] inner court and the holy of holies now
[29:31] there is so much built around it and so
[29:33] much Commerce added to it in some ways
[29:35] when I was studying this and looking at
[29:37] it's was like it became a labyrinth with
[29:38] all sorts of rooms and courts and
[29:41] everything built up around it he say
[29:42] there's nothing wrong with those things
[29:44] but if you lose the meaning of the outer
[29:47] and the inner and you lose the presence
[29:49] of God in the most holy place what is
[29:51] all the other stuff for needlessly
[29:55] complex if all of it doesn't bring you
[29:57] into to his presence if all of it
[29:59] doesn't lift up the word if all of it
[30:00] doesn't bring you to Christ it's
[30:02] needlessly complex and this is exactly
[30:05] what Jesus is call out you have become
[30:07] this place which ought to have been the
[30:09] habitation of the shikina glory he says
[30:11] has become a den of Thieves Christ has
[30:14] been driven out of it the sh glory is no
[30:16] longer there I I am no longer welcome in
[30:19] my own house because through your own
[30:21] ideas you have made it a den of Thieves
[30:24] and what does he say about the thieves
[30:25] in John 10:10 the thief comes only to
[30:28] steal and to kill and to destroy they
[30:33] may have been there promising the
[30:34] worshipper away to access God they may
[30:37] have been there selling Wares to
[30:39] facilitate worship and to Plate their
[30:41] conscience and to satisfy God's
[30:43] requirements but they were truly there
[30:46] to steal to kill and destroy no matter
[30:49] how much Lip lip service they paid to
[30:51] the law no matter how much they said
[30:53] their doves were right no matter how
[30:54] much they claimed all the offerings were
[30:56] perfect they were not amen that's right
[30:59] and at the very least they were not
[31:02] simple they were not there in their
[31:04] liberality they were not there truly to
[31:07] to make sacrifice they were there to
[31:09] line their pockets they were there to
[31:12] kill to steal and to destroy and that's
[31:14] what Jesus said you've made the house of
[31:16] God a place that is needlessly
[31:20] complicated and you've done it to serve
[31:22] man and not
[31:24] me the very thing the prophet Samuel was
[31:27] raised up to
[31:29] correct Malachi 1: 7 and 8 he says ye
[31:33] offer polluted bread upon my altar this
[31:35] is what the Book of Malachi is
[31:36] concluding before Christ comes in the
[31:39] New Testament as you read it chronolog
[31:41] in the chronology of the Bible you
[31:42] offered polluted bread upon my Altar and
[31:45] you say wherein have we polluted thee so
[31:48] it says you've polluted me and they say
[31:50] how polluted
[31:52] bread in that you say the table of Lord
[31:54] is contemptible and if you offer the
[31:57] blind for sacrifice is it not evil he's
[31:59] not talking about blind people but
[32:03] remember offerings and sacrifices were
[32:05] to have a certain character a certain
[32:06] quality in other words the word said to
[32:09] do it this way and they're kind of
[32:10] compromising and you know someone goes
[32:12] to offer up you know a turtle D like why
[32:14] is this one wearing glasses right it's
[32:16] like oh it's fashion don't worry about
[32:18] it you know it's it doesn't really
[32:19] matter it's the inside that counts and
[32:22] so it was said well if you offer blind
[32:24] for sacrifice is not if you offer the
[32:26] lame and sick is it not evil
[32:29] words didn't God tell you to do it this
[32:31] way and now you're just skirting around
[32:33] and you're just saying it's become just
[32:34] ceremony it's become pretense it's all
[32:37] done just to give the show to say we've
[32:39] complied he's really calling this out he
[32:41] says offer it now under thy Governor woo
[32:43] that's was good go offer the very things
[32:46] you're trying to offer to God in the
[32:47] house of the Lord offer it to the
[32:49] governor will he be pleased with thee or
[32:51] accept thy person if you tried to offer
[32:54] the things you're trying to offer God to
[32:56] the most to the your r rulers and the
[32:58] natural people what would they think
[33:00] about it wa this is what you're giving
[33:04] me he says saith the Lord of
[33:07] hosts this is what the house of the Lord
[33:10] had become a den of Thieves blind
[33:13] sacrifices lame and sick and it was all
[33:15] evil it was not the way that the word of
[33:18] God had commanded it so he says in
[33:20] Matthew 23: 13 we've read from this very
[33:23] heavily recently but wo and you scribes
[33:25] and Pharisees Hypocrites the Pharisee
[33:27] embodies the
[33:29] hypocrite Jesus Christ was calling out
[33:31] the hypocrite in his Parables and some
[33:33] of the things that we've been covering
[33:35] for ye shut up the Kingdom of Heaven
[33:37] against men for ye neither go in
[33:39] yourselves neither suffer ye them that
[33:41] are entering to go
[33:42] in and other words the Kingdom of Heaven
[33:45] is
[33:46] real and they're not willing to enter in
[33:50] they're not willing to do it as God said
[33:52] to do it they're not willing to worship
[33:53] as God said to worship the house of the
[33:55] Lord is no longer functioning the way
[33:57] that God said it should be functioned
[33:59] and they are not willing to do it and
[34:00] that's bad in itself but then they
[34:02] wouldn't let anybody else do it so they
[34:04] contrived a lot of different ways to
[34:05] scare people away from the true word of
[34:09] God Luke 11:52 he says that this way woe
[34:12] unto you
[34:13] lawyers for you have taken away the key
[34:16] of
[34:17] knowledge ye entered not in yourselves
[34:20] and them that were entering in ye
[34:22] hindered notice again as you can think
[34:24] back to some of the things we've been
[34:26] ministering on my people are destroyed
[34:27] from for lack of knowledge how that
[34:29] there was this uh um in The Parables of
[34:33] the Rich Young Ruler and The Parables of
[34:37] Lazarus a and Devas and these different
[34:41] things if you look back at those
[34:42] examples there was this disregard for
[34:45] the word of
[34:46] God and they took away the key of
[34:50] knowledge they didn't want to enter into
[34:52] the kingdom of God and if they couldn't
[34:53] enter in for whatever their reasons were
[34:55] they're going to try to keep you from
[34:56] entering in too
[34:58] and Jesus summarizes it this way or I
[35:00] want to use this scripture in summary
[35:01] Mark 7:13 making the word of God go back
[35:04] and read the prior verses to this making
[35:07] the word of God as he's walking through
[35:08] these scenarios where uh one ought to do
[35:11] this and one ought to do that and he
[35:12] says you've taken the word that God gave
[35:15] for a very specific purpose in the law
[35:18] and you've made the word of God of no
[35:22] effect it doesn't produce what it was
[35:24] designed to produce it doesn't
[35:25] accomplish what it was supposed to
[35:27] accomplish God said if this happened do
[35:29] this and it do it it would bring peace
[35:31] it' bring resolution it would take care
[35:32] of the matter but you through your
[35:34] Traditions have made the word of God
[35:36] ineffective which you have delivered in
[35:38] many such like things do ye it's all
[35:40] ceremony by your Traditions it's
[35:42] man-made you've taken the things of God
[35:45] and you've added to it you've taken away
[35:48] and and you've done things to where
[35:49] you've you've confused the truth I was
[35:52] fellowshiping with brother Jim Pinkston
[35:53] yesterday and he made a comment that uh
[35:56] uh I thought it interesting understand
[35:57] that he quoted some of the very
[35:58] scriptures I had in my notes I was like
[36:00] well I'm not necessarily taking this as
[36:02] a green light but he said that one way
[36:05] that one will keep from entering in
[36:07] won't enter in is they just leave it
[36:08] alone they won't get into it they won't
[36:10] preach
[36:11] it how do they keep you from entering
[36:13] They Don't Preach the word of God
[36:16] because they're not willing to enter in
[36:17] themselves so it all became ceremony
[36:19] became
[36:22] man-made now the gospel is meant and
[36:25] intended to bring us into relationship
[36:26] with Jesus Christ
[36:30] I'll say this if the message of the hour
[36:32] does not bring you into relationship
[36:33] with Christ that would be very
[36:36] problematic and if we somehow try to
[36:38] justify ourselves by saying oh but uh uh
[36:40] William brandom or oh but this guy or
[36:42] this guy or church or the people if it
[36:45] does not bring us into relationship with
[36:47] Jesus Christ there's a
[36:49] problem because the gospel which brother
[36:51] bradam I believe came in support of and
[36:54] restoring in defense of and was
[36:56] preaching the gospel is to bring us into
[36:58] relationship with God and is to bring us
[37:00] into his presence the house of the Lord
[37:02] was meant to be a place a sanctuary in
[37:05] those days that man could come and offer
[37:07] worship and sacrifices according to the
[37:09] word of God and in doing so though it
[37:11] wouldn't divorce him from sin it became
[37:13] a way that he could satisfy God's
[37:15] requirements and the worshipper could be
[37:17] purged of their incidental sins and
[37:19] those things of re to say I know that
[37:21] I've done what God required of me but it
[37:23] had completely been made into a dent of
[37:25] Thieves and the word which God had
[37:28] intended to keep the children of Israel
[37:30] was of no effect upon the people it was
[37:32] mere ceremony it's all
[37:36] outward brother Bram says in the
[37:38] dedication of building of the Lord he's
[37:41] talking about some of these uh diverse
[37:43] Washings and these different things in
[37:44] this he's talking specifically in the
[37:46] temple then hup would be thrown in with
[37:48] the Scarlet cedar wood and hup now we
[37:50] know that this is used also in The
[37:52] Exodus but now he's if I recall
[37:54] correctly as I was studying it it's uh
[37:56] he's using it in uh some sort of service
[37:59] in the temple hup is nothing but common
[38:02] weed meaning that the gospel must never
[38:05] be taught by Dr
[38:07] PhD it must be taught in
[38:10] humility in other words it shouldn't be
[38:12] your PhD that forms the basis for your
[38:14] qualifications for delivering it it's
[38:16] not your knowledge and your education
[38:18] the lawyers in those days says W and you
[38:19] lawyers the lawyers were the ones that
[38:21] studied the law they're the ones
[38:24] studying the word that God had given
[38:26] they're the ones that are dividing into
[38:28] minute articles and tithing on mint and
[38:30] Anis and cumin and leaving the weightier
[38:31] matters of the law behind there was
[38:34] things that they were getting into and
[38:35] digging into and it's not education it's
[38:38] not a doctorate it's not a PhD that
[38:40] qualifies you to preach the
[38:42] word and it's none of those things that
[38:45] would necessarily disqualify you as long
[38:47] as you do it in humility and in the gift
[38:49] of God and the service of God he says it
[38:51] must be taught in
[38:53] humility just as humble as the weed is
[38:55] before you the gospel is never to be
[38:58] made complicated to the people it's to
[39:01] be humble amen and Jesus is saying this
[39:04] is needlessly
[39:06] complex you've turned the house of the
[39:08] Lord into a den of Thieves should be a
[39:11] House of Prayer it should be
[39:12] straightforward though it though there's
[39:13] details and there's a lot to it and you
[39:15] rely upon teaching and instruction and
[39:17] you you rely upon the goodness of others
[39:20] man once our hearts become solid once
[39:21] economics took control the whole thing
[39:24] became let loose into nothing but a a a
[39:26] money-making program and scheme to keep
[39:28] things going and to promote their own
[39:30] agendas and their own legacies it was
[39:32] not for the purpose of God's will being
[39:35] done and Paul says I fear lest by any
[39:38] means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[39:39] through his subtlety so your mind should
[39:42] be corrupted from the Simplicity that is
[39:45] in
[39:46] Christ just as it had been
[39:49] defiled to the woman he's now saying
[39:52] it's we I don't want you to be defiled
[39:56] and Christ is making this same
[39:57] observations about the Jews in his day
[39:59] you have defiled the house of the Lord
[40:03] Brother bam says in God's power to
[40:04] transform in the same pattern he
[40:06] deceived Eve he also has deceived the
[40:09] church which is there Eve was a type of
[40:11] the church notice what it did through
[40:13] the wandering for knowledge she slips
[40:15] across the line between right and wrong
[40:17] by listening to Satan's perversion or
[40:19] deformity of the original word of God
[40:24] how is it that Satan is successful by
[40:27] explaining away the value of the word of
[40:30] God he he he tries to deform it and
[40:33] pervert the original word of God for his
[40:38] Advantage because he has something to
[40:40] gain he's a businessman that has
[40:42] something to gain so in the same pattern
[40:45] that the the woman was deceived Satan is
[40:47] working in the church to cause her to
[40:50] wonder in this Labyrinth of knowledge
[40:53] trying to find Christ trying to find
[40:56] good trying to find life trying to
[40:58] please the Lord trying to satisfy
[41:00] themselves whatever it might be but it's
[41:01] perversion it's deformity it's
[41:03] defilement of the original
[41:06] word exactly as it was found in the days
[41:08] of
[41:10] Christ now to make this connection among
[41:13] the garden the house of the Lord and the
[41:15] bride at the end time I'm using the
[41:18] temptation of the woman the Temptation
[41:20] Of Christ and how that Paul says as the
[41:22] serpent beguiled Eve and that the bride
[41:25] in the end time will be Tried by the
[41:28] word the word should be Tried by the
[41:30] word not denominational interpretation
[41:32] but the word the word's going to be
[41:33] presented to her and the word isn't
[41:35] necessarily going to be like well this
[41:36] is God's honest truth do you believe
[41:39] it but you're going to be presented with
[41:42] the word and say yeah but or yeah
[41:47] and or are you
[41:50] sure that this is honest there's a way
[41:53] that it's to be presented to cause the
[41:56] doubt
[41:57] amen Matthew 4: 3-7 let us read this
[42:01] this will form a very critical uh basis
[42:04] for the remainder of our time this
[42:06] morning and when the tempter same one
[42:09] that tempted the woman he comes to
[42:10] Christ came to him and said if thou be
[42:13] the Son of God command that these Stones
[42:15] be made
[42:18] bread and he Christ answered and said it
[42:20] is written man shall not live by bread
[42:23] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[42:25] out of the mouth of God the Bible says
[42:27] that he was hungry he had need of bread
[42:30] he had power to turn stones to bread but
[42:32] Satan presents this offer if thou be the
[42:35] Son of God command that these Stones be
[42:37] made bread now it's not an outlandish
[42:41] proposition if he was to do it he would
[42:43] be proving to the devil that he was a
[42:46] Believer he'd be proving to the devil
[42:48] that he was who he said he was and as
[42:51] the Bible said that the Rocks would cry
[42:52] out and there was there there was this
[42:54] belief in that uh
[42:58] as Christ even s said the Rocks would
[43:00] cow there's this belief that God could
[43:03] cause things to speak or things to utter
[43:05] forth and creation could praise uh for
[43:08] God to turn a stone into bread this this
[43:10] wouldn't be some magician's
[43:13] trick or it wouldn't be
[43:17] unfathomable so it says it is written
[43:19] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[43:20] every word that proceedeth out of the
[43:22] mouth of God he's
[43:24] taking in this moment of tempt ation
[43:28] he's being asked to do something that
[43:29] perhaps he had not thought of or
[43:31] anticipated himself to say well I'm
[43:33] hungry why don't I just uh make myself
[43:36] some
[43:37] bread but he In This Moment he says well
[43:41] you know what's the most important thing
[43:43] besides that is the word of
[43:45] God and and that that's where he's going
[43:47] to
[43:48] stand now in the as it's told in Matthew
[43:52] chapter
[43:53] 4 Luke chapter 4 is a little bit
[43:55] different order and so you try to figure
[43:57] out which one was lying to you but in
[44:00] Matthew chapter 4 it says it this in
[44:02] verse 5 then the devil taketh him up
[44:04] into the holy city and Seth him on the
[44:06] Pinnacle of the
[44:08] temple now he has brought him to the
[44:11] Pinnacle of the temple he's right there
[44:14] on the grounds of the house of the Lord
[44:17] some surmise that the Pinnacle of the
[44:18] temple would have been the highest part
[44:21] A and where they had the steepest drop
[44:23] but nonetheless this would have been I
[44:25] would argue somewhat visible
[44:28] a a and maybe H uh you know this isn't
[44:32] he's not doing this in hiding
[44:33] necessarily he takes him to the Pinnacle
[44:35] of the temple and he says unto him if
[44:37] thou be the Son of God cast thyself down
[44:39] for it is written he's kind of learned
[44:41] something hasn't he he shall give his
[44:44] angels charge concerning thee and in
[44:46] their hands they shall bear thee up lest
[44:48] at any time thou Dash thy foot against a
[44:50] stone God hath said that this would not
[44:55] you will not be harmed you will not be
[44:57] endangered you will not be your foot
[44:59] would not be dashed that the angels will
[45:01] look out after you they'll be your
[45:02] protection so he takes him to this high
[45:05] place and says if you are the Son of God
[45:07] cast yourself down because God said this
[45:11] is what he would do for the Messiah this
[45:13] is what he would do for you if you're a
[45:15] Son of
[45:16] God so cast yourself
[45:19] down and he answers in a very striking
[45:22] way Jesus said to him it is written
[45:24] again the devil used it is written right
[45:28] so Jesus says it is written again that
[45:30] thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God
[45:33] you'll find where brother B us says and
[45:35] God don't clown for
[45:36] anybody he says he doesn't have to
[45:39] answer anything that Satan
[45:43] asks that's why sometimes the question
[45:45] is you know D question and you say who's
[45:49] asking who wants to know right because I
[45:53] don't have to answer the devil's
[45:54] questions amen
[45:57] even though we do have the
[45:59] answer now notice what the devil does in
[46:02] this next phase he chose the Pinnacle of
[46:05] the house of the Lord to do what to
[46:08] cause Jesus I hope you can really focus
[46:12] it now to cause Jesus in his own words
[46:16] to tempt
[46:18] God how is it he tempts
[46:22] God Satan has said it in his
[46:25] proposition the Bible says that he
[46:28] wouldn't let your foot be dashed against
[46:30] a stone that the Angels God would allow
[46:33] the angels to intervene to stop this
[46:35] from happening so because God said this
[46:38] would happen for you he tries to make
[46:41] Jesus the instigator of the Fulfillment
[46:44] of that prophecy he tries to make Jesus
[46:47] the initiator of God fulfilling his word
[46:50] so he's made Jesus now of his own will
[46:53] or own violation in this challenge if
[46:55] thou be the Son of God go said that you
[46:57] would do this and this would follow you
[46:59] or this would happen so you go ahead and
[47:01] do it and Jesus says do you realize what
[47:03] you're doing you're wanting me to say
[47:05] well God you said and then to tempt him
[47:09] to fulfill his
[47:11] word in Mark chapter 16: 17 and 18 if we
[47:14] want to make this a practical for us
[47:16] Jesus said and these signs shall follow
[47:18] them that believe in my name shall they
[47:21] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[47:24] new tongues they shall take up serpents
[47:26] and
[47:27] they and if they drink any deadly thing
[47:29] it shall not hurt them they shall lay
[47:31] hands on the sick and they shall
[47:35] recover so how is it that we could tempt
[47:37] God in the same way it is written that
[47:40] these signs shall follow them that
[47:42] believe so we could tempt God by pushing
[47:45] the
[47:46] signs trying to force his hand and
[47:49] speaking in tongu trying to force his
[47:51] hand in healing trying to say well this
[47:52] is what you said and this is what's
[47:54] going to happen and we tempt God now
[47:56] this may seem seem to be a challenge in
[47:59] terms of getting our heads around this
[48:01] but it's amazing how sometimes people
[48:03] are very quick to say these signs shall
[48:06] follow them that believe they shall cast
[48:07] out devils in my name they shall speak
[48:09] with tongues and they shall lay hands on
[48:11] the sick and they shall recover and they
[48:13] force it as a mandate that you must
[48:16] produce or you're not a Believer and for
[48:20] some reason I think their Bibles skipped
[48:23] a lot of verse 18 CU they don't pass out
[48:26] snakes
[48:28] right and they don't drink poison
[48:32] right to tempt
[48:35] God then again there's those that do to
[48:39] do exactly that because they've made the
[48:41] word of God no effect to their
[48:44] Traditions the mandating the laying on
[48:46] of hands the mandating of healing the
[48:49] mandating to where it becomes manmade
[48:51] proposition I hope you're really
[48:52] listening to this it's in the word of
[48:54] God it's the children's bread it's in
[48:57] the Covenant it's God's promise he said
[48:59] he would fulfill it faith is what
[49:01] activates it as soon as man tries to get
[49:03] in and make a program out of it it's not
[49:06] what it you is meant to
[49:08] be in question and answers part four
[49:11] brother Brandon basically says he I'm
[49:13] around snake handlers what about
[49:16] it dear prophet of God he refers to Mark
[49:19] 16:18 part of L hands on the sick he
[49:21] says I'm around snake handlers what
[49:24] about
[49:25] it yeah we can preach this in North
[49:28] Carolina he said well that's a good
[49:31] question if you're around snake handlers
[49:34] and they say Mark 16 what are they going
[49:36] to be saying these signs shall follow
[49:37] them that believe they shall uh cast out
[49:40] devils in my name and speak with new
[49:42] tongues and take up serpents and drink
[49:44] deadly things and lay hands on the sick
[49:47] he said they're probably going to quote
[49:48] Mark 16 certainly I believe that the
[49:50] Bible means just what it
[49:53] says it means just what it says so you
[49:55] would be a fool to deny this as the
[49:59] signs that follow them that believe but
[50:02] notice that Satan made the offer that
[50:04] this sign shall follow the
[50:06] Messiah you follow me is it is this a
[50:10] difficult
[50:11] proposition is this an immodest proposal
[50:14] think about what I'm asking you today to
[50:16] consider according to the word of
[50:20] God he says I believe if we we try to
[50:23] tempt the Lord into something we're in
[50:25] for it
[50:27] but I don't think that God means for you
[50:28] to bring me a bottle of arsenic to see
[50:30] if I could drink it and prove to you
[50:32] that I have faith more no more than I
[50:34] believe it would be right for you to
[50:35] bring me a snake and let me pick it up
[50:37] and show you I have faith that I can
[50:39] overcome its poison I don't believe that
[50:42] that's
[50:43] so you know there's a certain mechanics
[50:46] of forcing
[50:47] it in other words it'd say like I'll
[50:50] prove you I'm a Believer you go find
[50:52] somebody sick and bring them in here you
[50:54] bring somebody in lame kicking and
[50:56] dragging leave me
[50:58] alone right and I'm going to prove to
[51:00] you that's not the spirit of the
[51:02] Gospel he says I don't believe that so I
[51:05] don't believe that it was that if I was
[51:06] in the water he says I do believe Now
[51:08] Catch the thought to this I do believe
[51:10] if I was in the water water baptizing
[51:12] people doing the work of the Lord or out
[51:14] in the jungle and a snake bit me I'd
[51:15] walk right on in the name of Jes name of
[51:17] the Lord notice how it seems to be in
[51:19] the course of the regular commission
[51:22] that we have not made it part of our
[51:24] commission to lay hands on the sick to
[51:27] take up deadly serpents to drink poison
[51:30] to speak in tongues we have not made
[51:32] that part of the commission but as I go
[51:34] into all the world and preach the gospel
[51:36] if the gospel brings forth the sick lay
[51:39] hands on them if in preaching the gospel
[51:41] you're they try to poison you you will
[51:43] be made H W ho if you're preaching the
[51:45] gospel and snakes try to bite you don't
[51:46] worry about if you're preaching the
[51:48] gospel you'll be speaking a new language
[51:51] preach the gospel let Christ have the
[51:53] prance and let the word do the rest
[51:57] knowing that he promised to do the rest
[51:59] I hope you can catch how he's answering
[52:01] this in 1964 in the year in which he was
[52:04] a
[52:05] prophet I believe that that's what it
[52:07] meant he says what you do with that dear
[52:10] person ever who you are remember this
[52:12] watch what the Bible did about
[52:14] it we could draw from that lesson of
[52:17] Paul no more than I believe if you say
[52:19] Glory Glory
[52:23] Glory I mean what's he talking about
[52:27] I believe you try to say Glory Glory
[52:29] Glory don't tempt God to speak in
[52:32] tongues just let the spirit speak
[52:35] through
[52:36] you now I don't believe in tempting God
[52:39] or pushing anything we wait upon the
[52:42] spirit it does
[52:44] it so what was the devil trying to do
[52:47] well the Bible said these signs shall
[52:48] follow the Messiah and prove it do
[52:53] it and Jesus Jesus didn't get into tizzy
[52:57] just as the woman was
[52:59] tempted oh my goodness and and and she
[53:02] allows herself to be drawn into air and
[53:05] adultery Christ in that moment showed us
[53:08] how to overcome not by power not by
[53:11] saying can we go back to the first
[53:12] question I think the bread will be
[53:14] enough right he said no it is also
[53:17] written bringing it back to the word and
[53:20] the word only Amen in other words you
[53:22] are preserving the reality in the
[53:26] sacredness of the word that says these
[53:29] signs shall follow them that believe you
[53:32] believe it so much to be the word of God
[53:34] you would not pervert it you would not
[53:36] want to defile it you would not want to
[53:37] impersonate it God who wrote it and made
[53:39] the promise has got to be the one to do
[53:42] [Music]
[53:43] it and it would be tempting God in that
[53:46] moment where he says wait a minute I'm
[53:48] not he doesn't say well that's not
[53:50] true and we need to be careful the Bible
[53:52] says to do this well that's not true
[53:54] speaking in tongues as of the devil
[53:55] laying hands on the sick is I'm the
[53:57] devil no you would but we have to
[54:00] recognize it's truth but how would we
[54:02] pervert it and make it of the devil when
[54:04] we tempt God and try to do
[54:07] it I hope that's abundantly
[54:12] clear Satan if you can look at it from
[54:14] this vantage point they're out there in
[54:16] the wilderness turn these stones into
[54:18] bread he says it is written man shall
[54:20] not live by bread alone but by every
[54:22] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[54:23] God oh okay so you're a believer you
[54:26] believe the word you're going to do what
[54:29] the word says okay the word says that if
[54:32] you cast yourself down angels will bear
[54:35] thee up because he won't let the
[54:36] messiah's foot even be dashed by a stone
[54:39] so give me do it you you you believe the
[54:43] word and he says yeah I do I'm not going
[54:45] to deny it I'm not say well that's not
[54:47] true he says it is written that thou
[54:50] shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[54:53] God he brings them up to the Pinnacle of
[54:56] the
[54:56] Temple this elevated platform in this
[54:59] stage to bring them up before an
[55:00] audience and he tries to make this
[55:03] Vindication a public show at the house
[55:06] of the
[55:11] Lord just think about that a little
[55:14] bit the or
[55:18] orchestrating for this to
[55:21] be Christ The Pinnacle of the temple a
[55:24] busy place trying to to force it for him
[55:28] to be the
[55:29] Messiah they knew that the Messiah would
[55:31] suddenly come to his Temple this would
[55:33] be the moment this would be the time
[55:34] scriptures would just start coming to
[55:35] pass immediately but Jesus knew better
[55:38] than to tempt the Lord thy God the house
[55:42] of Lord was ordered a certain way and
[55:46] please remain with me I know that we've
[55:47] probably been around an hour but please
[55:49] remain very very close to me the house
[55:51] of the Lord was ordered in a certain way
[55:54] as we've said before on purpose
[55:56] that God in having the outer court and
[55:58] even when that final tent was erected to
[56:01] create the outer Court the presence of
[56:03] God came down in the in the most holy
[56:05] place and God Vindicated this
[56:06] Arrangement this structure God was very
[56:09] deliberate in establishing the temple
[56:11] with this order I found this drawing to
[56:14] be uh pretty detailed and uh actually I
[56:18] there's a lot a lot of detail to it but
[56:20] I don't necessarily want you to get
[56:21] caught up in the detail but in looking
[56:24] at this this arrangement of Sol 's
[56:27] Temple I want you I wanted just to
[56:29] represent it visually that you have here
[56:31] here's the outer Court you have the
[56:33] Altar and you have the the the Laver and
[56:35] then you have the uh the porch into what
[56:38] they say is the temple then the Oracle
[56:39] but this is the outer Court outer Court
[56:42] inner Court holy of holies you got that
[56:46] as you look at it in the outer court now
[56:47] think of this in the outer Court there
[56:49] would be natural
[56:51] light you have the ab Brazen labor the
[56:54] Brazen altar
[56:56] there in the outer Court it would be
[56:58] under the conditions of Night and
[57:00] Day the cycle of the night and the the
[57:03] evening and the morning some days it
[57:05] could be sunny some days it could be
[57:06] cloudy it's all dependent upon the
[57:08] atmospheres and and the Earth but then
[57:11] as you go out of the outer Court into
[57:13] the temple as it says here or the holy
[57:14] place there in the Holy place you have
[57:16] the candlesticks the seven golden
[57:18] candlesticks the lampstand which you
[57:20] could see that would represent Church
[57:21] ages in there a man had to light the
[57:24] candle it was man-made light there was
[57:25] sh that was baked there was the altar of
[57:27] incense there was another altar there in
[57:29] the Holy place but in the holiest
[57:33] place once you got in behind the veil
[57:36] there God was the light it was a
[57:38] supernatural light there was the ark of
[57:39] the testimony there were the cherums
[57:42] there was the place that God said he
[57:43] would
[57:44] dwell and brother bandam in the sermon
[57:46] hidden life with Christ says you know
[57:48] remember some of these themes in Hidden
[57:50] life he says through the Lutheran Age
[57:51] come forth the just shall live by faith
[57:53] the outer Court this is where we're
[57:55] going to get into the LA in the the I
[57:57] think I have the quotation here this is
[57:58] where you're going to see this Labyrinth
[58:00] the house of God was not a labyrinth it
[58:02] was straightforward God made this
[58:03] arrangement for a
[58:06] reason the outer Court along with the
[58:08] methodists came the sanctification age
[58:10] they call the second definite work of
[58:11] Grace which come in that age and there's
[58:13] the altar age and then the last day is
[58:15] the restoration of the Holy Spirit the
[58:17] hidden life now I don't necessarily want
[58:20] you to get so caught up on whether or
[58:21] not we could bring these distinct
[58:23] distinctions in each age but brother
[58:25] just using this as as a type this
[58:26] Evolution says and in the last days the
[58:29] restoration of the Holy Spirit the
[58:30] hidden life and I'm sure right there's
[58:33] where the trouble
[58:34] ISS are you following this now outer
[58:37] Court inner Court Most Holy Place outer
[58:40] Court Temple Oracle however you want to
[58:41] do it this three-fold division of the
[58:43] house of the Lord that there was an
[58:45] outer court and there were certain
[58:46] things done there certain people allowed
[58:47] there then you narrowed it down then you
[58:48] narrowed it down and these things were
[58:50] all signifying Jesus Christ think of all
[58:52] these things we tried to uh uh introduce
[58:54] into our thought process today
[58:57] he said not where the trouble lays I
[59:00] want you to see it right here's where
[59:02] the trouble lays with the church
[59:05] today can't deviate between the Altar
[59:09] and the holiest of
[59:10] holies now I would say the language is
[59:15] interesting because to deviate is to
[59:17] wander away from to deviate we say oh
[59:20] they deviated off course it's it's maybe
[59:21] to get off course to get off the path so
[59:24] in the way that he's saying it they
[59:25] can't deviate between the Altar and the
[59:27] host of holies the way that it strikes
[59:28] me I'll leave it to the Lord to maybe
[59:30] strike you they're not able to
[59:33] distinguish between the the the the
[59:36] outer Court The Altar and the holies of
[59:40] holies that there when they that the
[59:43] deviation certainly it's a deviation but
[59:45] they're deviating by remaining at this
[59:47] altar of incense they're deviating by
[59:49] remaining at a Brazen altar they're
[59:50] deviating in these other ages and these
[59:52] other ways in not following the way into
[59:55] the present pres they can't distinguish
[59:58] they can't deviate between the Altar and
[1:00:00] the Hol of holies now if you could say
[1:00:02] this if I could say this you can't in
[1:00:05] the way just one maybe one other way to
[1:00:07] look at this he says you can't wander
[1:00:09] away from the holy of
[1:00:11] holies you can't deviate away from the
[1:00:14] holy of holies back to the altar right
[1:00:17] that that this is where the problem lays
[1:00:19] either they don't know how to get in
[1:00:20] there or they're wandering away from it
[1:00:22] the problem lays between the Altar and
[1:00:24] the Shak of Glory the problem lays
[1:00:26] between the Altar and the presence of
[1:00:28] Christ the holy of
[1:00:30] holies he says in there is where the
[1:00:32] place where the church ought to be in
[1:00:34] there and there's too many of them still
[1:00:36] on the outside out there instead of
[1:00:38] being in
[1:00:40] here you catch how he's laid this out
[1:00:43] you're to go all the way into Christ and
[1:00:46] there's this Meandering and this maze
[1:00:48] that when you go this you got to back up
[1:00:50] and do this and do this you got to back
[1:00:51] up and do this he says you can't deviate
[1:00:54] I'm not I know I'm bringing two
[1:00:55] different interpretations of how he say
[1:00:56] you can't deviate meaning you got to go
[1:00:58] in or they can't distinguish they can't
[1:01:00] go in either way it stands for this
[1:01:03] proposition the problem laid between the
[1:01:05] Altar and getting into
[1:01:08] Christ the house of the Lord had become
[1:01:12] a
[1:01:13] labyrinth it had become the
[1:01:15] Labyrinth a massive confusion a
[1:01:19] maze they're offering evil sacrifices
[1:01:23] blind and lame and sick sacrifices
[1:01:26] bread that had been
[1:01:28] defiled merchants and money changers and
[1:01:31] all sorts of people in there making sure
[1:01:33] that here we can we take Bitcoin we do
[1:01:35] Square you can do this just tap your
[1:01:37] phone we do Apple pay everybody was in
[1:01:39] there trying to facilitate religion
[1:01:41] facilitate ceremony facilitate the
[1:01:43] plating of one's conscience and it was a
[1:01:45] sign it was symbolic of what
[1:01:47] Christianity would become later on where
[1:01:49] it's all s it's all ceremony it's either
[1:01:53] too formal or it's just it's completely
[1:01:55] let loose of the word of God someone
[1:01:57] could say turn over the money tables
[1:01:58] kick out the money tables every man
[1:02:00] ought to Worship in the way that he
[1:02:01] wants to Jesus saiding they must Worship
[1:02:03] in spirit and in truth there was a way
[1:02:05] that God intended this even though you
[1:02:07] might look like you're doing it you've
[1:02:08] all become whitewashed
[1:02:10] tombs the of the the hyp hypocrisy of
[1:02:13] the Pharisee a mass of confusion had
[1:02:16] become in the days of Christ what was
[1:02:18] the
[1:02:20] trouble then and even now he cannot
[1:02:23] distinguish between the inner Court The
[1:02:26] Altar and holy of
[1:02:28] holies the
[1:02:30] altar where the where gifts were brought
[1:02:33] the altar where things were offered the
[1:02:35] altar where there was this continual
[1:02:36] worship this altar there whether you
[1:02:38] want to talk about the Brazen labor or
[1:02:40] the Brazen altar in the outer court or
[1:02:41] here is brother BR calls this altar in
[1:02:43] this inner court with in these Church
[1:02:45] ages representing these golden
[1:02:47] candlesticks and these lampstands
[1:02:49] they're all there but what were they
[1:02:51] there signifying what were they there as
[1:02:54] a figure of
[1:02:58] Christ that when he was to come man was
[1:03:00] to enter into the most holy
[1:03:03] place so Satan has devised a scheme to
[1:03:06] try to get us to live in the inner
[1:03:08] Court the altars and the gifts were
[1:03:12] intended by God to bring us into his
[1:03:14] presence not replace
[1:03:17] it whether it be the altar at which you
[1:03:20] would give your heart to God or you
[1:03:22] would pray whether it be the the the
[1:03:23] healing and the gifts and the
[1:03:25] manifestation of his Spirit to profit
[1:03:26] all it was given to bring us deeper into
[1:03:30] relationship with Christ to bring us
[1:03:31] into a greater confidence in his word to
[1:03:33] bring us into his presence not replace
[1:03:37] it Paul says in Galatians 1: 16 and 7 I
[1:03:39] Marvel that you were so soon removed
[1:03:41] from him that called you into the grace
[1:03:43] of Christ unto another gospel which is
[1:03:46] not another but there be some that
[1:03:48] trouble you and would pervert the gospel
[1:03:50] of
[1:03:51] Christ one that would trouble you cause
[1:03:53] inward commotion to to take away one's
[1:03:55] calmness of
[1:03:58] mind to cause those Scruples to be
[1:04:00] questioned to cause doubting it means to
[1:04:02] render anxious or distress to perplex
[1:04:05] the Mind through
[1:04:08] doubt Paul is saying man you're being
[1:04:11] removed from the gospel that I have
[1:04:13] called you to and out of the grace of
[1:04:16] Christ the Simplicity of Christ into
[1:04:19] another gospel which there's not another
[1:04:21] gospel into another Jesus there's not
[1:04:23] really another Jesus but these trouble
[1:04:25] you they take away your peace they make
[1:04:27] you anxious and perplex your mind by
[1:04:29] perverting the gospel of Christ by
[1:04:32] defiling the gospel of
[1:04:35] Christ the trouble is in The
[1:04:39] Labyrinth I'm using this phrase because
[1:04:41] I believe brother Brandon pointed to it
[1:04:42] in the church age book I believe that
[1:04:44] it's a phrase that could help us just to
[1:04:46] summarize very quickly in our minds what
[1:04:48] Christianity has become and what some
[1:04:50] try to make the message into a man-made
[1:04:53] structure
[1:04:56] that as soon as man gets a hold of it
[1:04:57] becomes confusing misleading and
[1:05:00] deceiving brother Bram and drawing from
[1:05:02] comenius in chapter 7 of the church AG
[1:05:04] book it says in Divine service the words
[1:05:06] of men are usually heard more than the
[1:05:07] word of
[1:05:09] God the words of men are usually heard
[1:05:13] more than the word of
[1:05:14] God I think it behooves us as I believe
[1:05:17] I talked one time about anecdotal faith
[1:05:20] and and and and how that we have to be
[1:05:23] very careful and even our test ifying to
[1:05:26] where there's a way in which man could
[1:05:28] be trying to testify of the goodness of
[1:05:31] God to where the goodness of God never
[1:05:33] anchors in faith in God or his word it's
[1:05:36] just look what God did look what God did
[1:05:39] and it's the words of men are heard more
[1:05:41] than the word of
[1:05:42] God and and other but instead it's God
[1:05:45] did this for me God this this for me and
[1:05:47] and not saying upon what basis can I
[1:05:52] believe the word of God each one chap PS
[1:05:55] as he pleases or kills Time by learn
[1:05:58] disquisitions and disproving the views
[1:06:00] of
[1:06:04] others that a
[1:06:07] Shame of the new birth and how a man
[1:06:09] must be changed in the likeness of
[1:06:11] Christ become partaker of the divine
[1:06:12] nature scarcely anything is
[1:06:16] said this is how you can be moved from a
[1:06:19] gospel this is how you can allow your
[1:06:21] minds to be
[1:06:23] defiled is by listening to chatter
[1:06:25] people who kill time by learn
[1:06:27] disquisitions and disproving the views
[1:06:29] of
[1:06:31] others but the new birth and how a man
[1:06:33] must be in the change to the likeness of
[1:06:35] Christ how he could be a partaker of the
[1:06:37] divine nature this is not just one
[1:06:39] little phrase this is weighty this is
[1:06:41] Hefty this is the New Covenant scarcely
[1:06:44] anything is said in Jude 19 or Jude he
[1:06:47] talks about how there's certain men
[1:06:48] who've crept un unawares amongst you and
[1:06:52] they're defiling the grace of God
[1:06:53] they're giving themselves over to
[1:06:54] lasciviousness he says these be they who
[1:06:56] separate themselves sensual having not
[1:06:59] the spirit they disjoin they they part
[1:07:02] they separate making divisions and
[1:07:05] separations what has come from another
[1:07:07] gospel another Jesus another Spirit what
[1:07:09] has come from the warning in Galatians
[1:07:11] the warning in Corinthians what has come
[1:07:12] out of these separations and these men
[1:07:14] that are sensual
[1:07:16] self-promotion of a greater sanctity
[1:07:18] self-promotion of Greater Works
[1:07:20] self-promotion of unique doctrines that
[1:07:22] distinguish themselves from everybody
[1:07:24] else
[1:07:26] and what does the gospel become
[1:07:31] confusion in the sermon hear ye himym
[1:07:34] are we about our father's business of
[1:07:35] the Holy Spirit getting every soul saved
[1:07:37] we can just on the word or are we
[1:07:40] arrogant and dilatory in arguing our
[1:07:42] little religious differences and
[1:07:43] splitting hairs such nonsense no wonder
[1:07:47] faith is
[1:07:49] gone splitting hairs the Labyrinth the
[1:07:53] thousand of minute articles the thousand
[1:07:55] matters of
[1:07:57] conscience through
[1:07:59] arrogance through failure dilator
[1:08:02] failure to do your
[1:08:03] duty arguing about little religious
[1:08:06] differences and splitting
[1:08:08] hairs he says that's why faith is
[1:08:11] gone we got to understand and know what
[1:08:14] builds
[1:08:15] Faith 1 Corinthians chapter 3:
[1:08:19] 1-4 and Brethren could not speak I
[1:08:22] Brethren could not speak unto you as
[1:08:24] unto spiritual but as unto carnal even
[1:08:26] as unto babes in Christ I fed you with
[1:08:29] milk and not with meat for hither to you
[1:08:31] were not able to Bear it neither yet now
[1:08:32] are you
[1:08:33] able for you are yet carnal for as there
[1:08:37] is among you envy and in strife and
[1:08:39] divisions are you not carnal and walk as
[1:08:41] men where there's splitting hairs where
[1:08:43] there's divisions where there's envy and
[1:08:45] jealousy and strife and party makak and
[1:08:47] politicking where there's a lack of
[1:08:50] Simplicity where there's a lack of
[1:08:52] Liberty and remember some of those that
[1:08:54] promised the greatest Liberty are the
[1:08:56] ones that parot the Bible as much as
[1:08:58] they possibly can and Paul says then
[1:09:00] promising Liberty actually bring you
[1:09:02] into greater
[1:09:04] bondage for while one saith I am a Paul
[1:09:07] and another I am of apollis are ye not
[1:09:09] carnal when you've separated yourself
[1:09:11] into these factions and these
[1:09:14] divisions you're
[1:09:18] carnal in the sermon of the Hidden
[1:09:21] life brother the B says the next court
[1:09:23] was a lampstand with a Justified stand
[1:09:25] and it was lit by human
[1:09:28] hands there's where we argue our
[1:09:31] denominations where we argue our
[1:09:33] differences split
[1:09:36] hairs this is where it
[1:09:38] happens
[1:09:40] sensual given to the
[1:09:42] flesh uh uh
[1:09:45] emotional things that are that are in
[1:09:47] that Spirit realm he's saying they can't
[1:09:50] deviate between the Altar and the
[1:09:52] holiest of holies they can't deviate
[1:09:54] from the man-made light the man-made
[1:09:55] worship the man-made uh uh offerings the
[1:09:58] man-made things the things of the flesh
[1:10:00] they can't deviate he says and that's
[1:10:01] where we split hairs that's where we
[1:10:03] argue that's where we differ that's
[1:10:06] where we have our
[1:10:07] differences but in Christ these
[1:10:10] distinctions are
[1:10:12] removed not that it would abolish
[1:10:15] particularities of confession not that
[1:10:16] it would abolish particularities of
[1:10:18] interpretations or or ways of viewing
[1:10:20] things but if we never get to Christ we
[1:10:22] have no common ground but to yield to
[1:10:25] commands interpretation of what the word
[1:10:29] says envy and strife and divisions
[1:10:32] that's what's there in this court around
[1:10:35] this altar lit by human hands that's
[1:10:39] where we argue our denominations that
[1:10:40] where where we argue our difference in
[1:10:42] split hairs oh I don't believe in Divine
[1:10:44] Healing I don't believe the Visions come
[1:10:46] from God I don't believe this I don't
[1:10:48] believe that you're
[1:10:50] arguing because you're
[1:10:53] living in the in her Court you're living
[1:10:57] in the
[1:10:58] altar you're living in the Holy place
[1:11:01] you're living in the
[1:11:03] temple he says yet you're eating
[1:11:06] Mana but you're living under artificial
[1:11:09] light sometimes the light goes out
[1:11:12] sometime your lamp gets smoked up camp
[1:11:15] meeting cramps convention to Convention
[1:11:19] Revival to Revival evangelist to
[1:11:20] evangelist but to who he who desires to
[1:11:23] hide away amen walk into the next place
[1:11:29] there's no artificial light
[1:11:32] anywhere but down between the Ark of the
[1:11:34] wings of these cheram was a supernatural
[1:11:37] light hanging in there which was a Halo
[1:11:40] of God that Lit the whole
[1:11:42] room it's only when we have deviated
[1:11:45] away from the most holy place that we
[1:11:48] split hairs that we argue we try to
[1:11:51] answer the devil but oh that I can live
[1:11:54] in the shakina glory
[1:11:57] the place where there is no artificial
[1:12:01] light it's the way out of the labyrinth
[1:12:04] that the Christianity's
[1:12:07] become in Luke 4 verse4 the orders a
[1:12:11] little bit differently but it says this
[1:12:13] when he was tempted to turn stones to
[1:12:15] bread in the first Temptation the next I
[1:12:17] believe he's uh brought to see all the
[1:12:20] kingdoms and the third is to the
[1:12:21] Pinnacle of the temple and Jesus
[1:12:23] answering said it is written
[1:12:26] this is this emphasis in the sermon of
[1:12:27] the Harvest time it is written that man
[1:12:30] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:12:32] every word of
[1:12:35] God in the face of the word being quoted
[1:12:38] to Jesus he never denied the
[1:12:41] word he didn't try to tear it down he
[1:12:43] didn't try to Sol it he didn't try to
[1:12:44] question
[1:12:45] it he just stuck with the word that also
[1:12:48] said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[1:12:51] God do you believe that we're living in
[1:12:53] the end time yes amen do we believe that
[1:12:56] the powers of Satan are 10 times harder
[1:12:58] than they've been in any age is this the
[1:13:01] most treacherous age the most deceitful
[1:13:03] age is it dark is it
[1:13:05] confusing
[1:13:08] absolutely and what is it he's trying to
[1:13:10] confuse us on
[1:13:12] politics
[1:13:14] no now just be at the risk of causing an
[1:13:18] uproar a Holy Spirit-filled believer can
[1:13:22] vote for a libertarian
[1:13:26] okay and a
[1:13:29] Democrat could they vote for
[1:13:32] Trump okay everybody's just
[1:13:34] like nope we're not saying nothing not
[1:13:37] going to do
[1:13:45] it where are we
[1:13:48] tempted away from
[1:13:52] Christ into the Labyrinth
[1:13:55] the smokiness the cloudiness the arguing
[1:13:57] the fighting the crowds of people in the
[1:13:59] in these other
[1:14:00] Chambers and Christ says I have forever
[1:14:03] consecrated a way not for a church but
[1:14:05] for the individual to enter into the
[1:14:08] most holy place and abide with me
[1:14:11] there the sanctuary
[1:14:14] restored man
[1:14:16] back as it were between the
[1:14:19] cherubims in fellowship with
[1:14:22] Christ and so when Jesus says man shall
[1:14:25] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:14:28] word of God Satan tempts us then on
[1:14:30] every word of God if you won't disagree
[1:14:33] with the word of God he'll try to
[1:14:35] misinterpret the word to you as he did
[1:14:38] the
[1:14:39] woman and the Harvest time hopefully
[1:14:41] this will be able to maybe move on to
[1:14:43] some other themes and some of our future
[1:14:45] Services still in the house of the Lord
[1:14:46] I hope you can see how a lot of this is
[1:14:47] connecting together in the Harvest Time
[1:14:49] notice if Satan fails there where turn
[1:14:54] the stones to bread
[1:14:56] then he'll try his second scheme on you
[1:14:59] and get you to disbelieve the word how
[1:15:02] and go to the
[1:15:03] Seminary he'll try the
[1:15:06] next a
[1:15:09] scheme now here is where you want to be
[1:15:11] real
[1:15:12] careful and just sit for another five
[1:15:14] minutes on this
[1:15:16] part if you
[1:15:18] will then he makes you a
[1:15:21] supernatural
[1:15:23] offer so come back to all this just
[1:15:25] before closing so if you're listening to
[1:15:27] the Harvest time you could track this
[1:15:29] much better than I can convey it
[1:15:31] now when Jesus said I live by every word
[1:15:35] of God then what he wanted to do is say
[1:15:37] it is
[1:15:38] written and use it to make him a
[1:15:40] supernatural
[1:15:42] offer this is all connecting together
[1:15:44] now everything we tried to express to
[1:15:45] you the house of the Lord and its
[1:15:48] defilement and the hidden life and these
[1:15:50] different things and and and how we came
[1:15:53] to the part of him tempting Jesus in
[1:15:55] Matthew 4 this is where Jesus has
[1:15:57] drawing this from and how he's trying to
[1:15:58] tempt what did he say to him if thou be
[1:16:01] the Son of God cast yourself off the
[1:16:02] temple and the word of God says this is
[1:16:05] what will
[1:16:07] happen this is where you want to be
[1:16:10] careful then he makes you a supernatural
[1:16:13] offer I'm going to come back to all this
[1:16:15] just before closing listen if he can't
[1:16:18] tempt you away from the
[1:16:21] word now I'm going to stay with the word
[1:16:24] then then he'll give you a supernatural
[1:16:28] offer if you're going to Proclaim your
[1:16:31] faith in the word if you're going to say
[1:16:33] you can't shake me from it the word my
[1:16:36] faith is in the word man shall live by
[1:16:38] the word only he'll say okay then I'm
[1:16:41] going to test you and tempt you with the
[1:16:44] word to get you away from the word
[1:16:49] only no I'm going to stay with the word
[1:16:52] then he'll give you a supernatural
[1:16:55] offer he said I tell you what you get up
[1:16:58] there and dive off the temple and bring
[1:17:00] back up see how the see show the people
[1:17:03] that you can do something
[1:17:06] Supernatural boy he got them there now
[1:17:08] watch this this is it watch when you get
[1:17:12] to the end where this temptation
[1:17:15] come we're in the end why where's this
[1:17:18] temptation at maybe he might let some of
[1:17:21] you speak in tongues think you got it or
[1:17:24] he might even let you prophesy though it
[1:17:26] not be with the
[1:17:28] word think of where the Temptation has
[1:17:31] come at the end with false prophecies
[1:17:34] false tongues false
[1:17:38] discernment I've seen people stand up
[1:17:40] and prophesy was contrary to the word as
[1:17:42] it to the word is the east from the West
[1:17:45] it's the word that you live by them
[1:17:48] Supernatural gifts Satan can just hand
[1:17:50] them out by the handfuls that don't mean
[1:17:53] one thing amen
[1:17:56] the Temptation at the end is a
[1:17:58] supernatural offer to get you to tempt
[1:18:01] God and to draw you away for the
[1:18:03] Simplicity of
[1:18:06] Christ does that mean we deny healing do
[1:18:08] we deny tongues do we deny deny
[1:18:10] Supernatural gifts no that's right but
[1:18:13] we don't make it complicated we don't
[1:18:16] make it confusing we don't make it amaz
[1:18:18] where there's this Meandering and we're
[1:18:20] following in this Meandering Pathway to
[1:18:23] try to find something secret place where
[1:18:26] we can get our our sins forgiven and we
[1:18:28] can be healed but Christ is the one
[1:18:31] thing
[1:18:33] needful if I could say this hope
[1:18:35] hopefully building a block to continue
[1:18:38] for the a future as we go forward the
[1:18:41] house of the
[1:18:42] Lord Brothers if you could come to your
[1:18:44] instruments the house of the Lord was
[1:18:46] not a
[1:18:47] labyrinth but it represented even in its
[1:18:50] divisions and its worship it represented
[1:18:52] a way back into God's presence
[1:18:57] therefore Our lives our homes our
[1:18:59] churches as we're looking at the house
[1:19:00] of the Lord as it's represented in us
[1:19:03] should have the same purpose we should
[1:19:05] be experiencing the same
[1:19:08] effect and what Satan is going to try to
[1:19:10] do in the end times is to tempt us away
[1:19:13] from the word of God to tempt us away
[1:19:16] from our faith in God by getting us to
[1:19:19] question and to doubt to get our
[1:19:21] Scruples
[1:19:22] up and to present to us us a case
[1:19:26] whether it be as he did to the woman to
[1:19:28] question God's
[1:19:30] honesty or as he did to Christ to tempt
[1:19:33] him to clown for the
[1:19:35] devil to tempt him into manmade Works
[1:19:40] signs
[1:19:43] manifestations to prove that he was a
[1:19:45] Son of God and brother Bram says oh boy
[1:19:47] he got them there a supernatural
[1:19:51] offer I know it seems very very strange
[1:19:53] to say a super Supernatural offer could
[1:19:55] be these signs shall follow them that
[1:19:59] believe brother bam said it's tempting
[1:20:03] God if he says Don't Tempt God to speak
[1:20:06] in tongues just let the spirit speak
[1:20:07] through you let's not tempt God in
[1:20:09] laying on of hands let's not tempt God
[1:20:11] in handling snakes let's not tempt God
[1:20:13] in trying to cast out devils in his name
[1:20:16] preach the gospel that's the Great
[1:20:18] Commission preach the gospel and Christ
[1:20:22] will do the
[1:20:23] rest he will deliver he will heal he
[1:20:27] will protect
[1:20:29] you in Luke 4:1 13 I wanted to close on
[1:20:32] this it's kind of
[1:20:33] sobering in Matthew it says then the
[1:20:36] devil departed and the angels came and
[1:20:37] ministered to him and it says and when
[1:20:38] the devil had ended all the Temptation
[1:20:40] he departed from
[1:20:42] him for a
[1:20:45] season he's
[1:20:48] back he's back didn't take them long
[1:20:51] even the scripture I'm not implying he
[1:20:52] was gone for a couple thousand years but
[1:20:55] he tempts again and what does he tempt
[1:20:56] away from your absolute steadfast
[1:20:59] confidence in the Simplicity that is in
[1:21:01] Christ in the Simplicity of God that he
[1:21:04] loves you he made a promise to you I
[1:21:07] will concede this world is a mess it's a
[1:21:11] labyrinth I I can't defend this world
[1:21:13] it's politics it's economics people
[1:21:15] trying to figure things out in
[1:21:17] presidential elections and whether not
[1:21:18] this President is good for this and this
[1:21:20] President is good for that listen we've
[1:21:22] got better analytics now and there's
[1:21:23] things that we have thought held true
[1:21:25] for years and oh we always thought it
[1:21:26] was this way and now that they can look
[1:21:28] at things in a deeper way and look at
[1:21:29] the metrics they're finding well this
[1:21:31] doesn't always hold
[1:21:32] true and the the stock market and and
[1:21:36] inflation and employment rates and all s
[1:21:39] there there's more data and information
[1:21:40] that's coming to bear on certain things
[1:21:42] to where they're realizing stuff that
[1:21:43] they never realized before and it's not
[1:21:46] just
[1:21:47] simply well what you how are you going
[1:21:48] to vote this year and it's going to be
[1:21:50] this way it's going to be that way it's
[1:21:51] all a mess it's a mess out there yes and
[1:21:55] what ought to have been a sanctuary from
[1:21:58] the world is
[1:22:01] Christ but then he's been chopped up and
[1:22:03] divided up into a million different
[1:22:06] pieces and just in the same likeness and
[1:22:09] the same figure as Christ came in his
[1:22:11] day at the darkest of hour to fulfill
[1:22:14] his promise and to bring about
[1:22:16] Redemption I believe that a prophet came
[1:22:18] on the scene in this hour in a similar
[1:22:20] time of confusion in the midst of a
[1:22:22] labyrinth and he didn't make another
[1:22:24] Labyrinth
[1:22:26] and man I I wish to God that it could
[1:22:27] have just been very very simple and so
[1:22:30] uh when I say simple just just one
[1:22:32] sermon so Vindicated so pronounced so
[1:22:34] vivid so real Earth shattering
[1:22:36] groundbreaking that it could have just
[1:22:38] settled everything and everyone is now
[1:22:40] existing in this
[1:22:41] Utopia a little Bethlehem a New
[1:22:43] Jerusalem right here on Earth believing
[1:22:45] in Jesus Christ honoring his
[1:22:51] word but there be some that still
[1:22:53] pervert the god gospel of Christ and
[1:22:55] will even use the
[1:22:57] message even use the message to try to
[1:23:00] lead you away from
[1:23:02] Christ but they don't do it
[1:23:05] honestly let us not be deceived church
[1:23:09] God is real God is Not mocked let us not
[1:23:12] tempt God but let us trust him trust him
[1:23:16] absolutely I pray I you I pray I'll pray
[1:23:18] this in a moment when we have you stand
[1:23:20] I pray that my burden is not question
[1:23:25] today I pray that in the the the the
[1:23:28] weight and the uh breadth of what I've
[1:23:30] expressed cuz it's a lot that there just
[1:23:33] be just a theme in your heart that
[1:23:35] anchors down that I can trust Jesus that
[1:23:38] Christ this word of God is true the word
[1:23:40] of God is real he's mindful of me and
[1:23:42] that there's this enemy that's trying to
[1:23:44] intervene and attack and trying to get
[1:23:46] us to drag us out deviate away from the
[1:23:48] holy hly drag us back to the altar drag
[1:23:52] us back to the lampstands right

[1:24:02] Christ I want to stand in there and
[1:24:04] commune with him between the
[1:24:06] cherubims as the devil departed Christ
