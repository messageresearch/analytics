TRANSCRIPT
========================================
second corinthians chapter 5 verse 7 and just reading a very very short verse for we walk by faith not by sight for we walk by faith not by sight let's bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father lord as we've gathered in your divine presence today as we have sensed it in the worship and just in lifting up of our hands and our voices to you and we felt your presence we ask that you'd come now take the word which we have read and bless it to our hearts may you make it alive to us by revelation we know that's only something you can do so we pray that you would do so and father just fill our hearts and strengthen us and encourage us and lord may if the settings seem to be unfamiliar if there's anyone that might be uncomfortable whether it be through fatigue or weariness lord or cold whatever it might be father may we just cause ourselves to be settled and focus upon you knowing that this is a this is an opportunity to hear your word and be strengthened and be lifted up and encouraged so we commit ourselves to you now father praying that you bless this service bless our time together in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you you can be seated we're continuing on the subject of blind trust bad faith and wanting to just go forward in this subject and maybe approach it from a little bit different angle but we're looking at how that our faith as believers and as christians is not blind and there's some ways that we approach faith or ways that we have been taught faith or we've kind of come to understand or no faith to where we really are using faith more as blind trust than we are what faith really is and we are actually in just having blind trust it really results in bad faith and so we're kind of challenging ourselves to recognize that our belief is with understanding that it's not just somebody said something so we believe it we just take it for face value this guy told me this and i just believe it but rather we have a personal relationship with god because he has disclosed himself to us he's made himself known to us and so by revelation we know that we're standing on a solid rock and we have this assurance that his word is true and that it's not just something i'm going by somebody else's testimony or i'm going by what somebody else said but this is something that god has disclosed to me and we even were looking at it from the standpoint that our faith has a basis it has a foundation it has something that supports it and something that lifts it up and our faith we could say faith has no reason and that's in the sense that faith is not rooted in the process of logic and human thinking and through the rigorous scientific method and we have this hypothesis that there's a god that created the heavens and the earth and we have tested this hypothesis and we've been able to duplicate the results many different times and so our theory has become fact that god created the heavens and earth that's not how that is not what when we say faith does not have reason or faith has no reason that's the process we're talking about but when we say that faith has reason it's rooted in the fact that god has disclosed something to you and we have a basis for belief in what we believe and even brother branham makes this statement about simeon that god had created in him a faith to believe the word and so god has created in us of faith to believe his word and that's a creation that's very real to us and i think i think i've got a little bit too much maybe on the monitors now but it sounds good i can hear myself today less in a box uh this time than i was last sunday but maybe you could bring the monitors down just a little bit faith is the confident assurance that god has promised confidence assurance that something god has promised is going to happen so faith is the evidence and faith is the substance it's not that you're trying to work up a faith in what somebody else said it's not that we're trying to work up uh faith in a dream that we had but rather faith is a substance in the evidence of something god has divinely promised to us something that god has said something that the word points to so we have a confident assurance that something god has promised is going to happen and and faith is so real that it just it's i know it's going to happen he made the promise it's going to be there i'm not i'm not doubting it i know it's going to take place and so it's a deliberate confidence and a god whose character's been proven to us we know his nature we know his character it's been proven to us and we so we can have a very deliberate confidence in him and these are just some you're saying well you preached this last time this is just me trying to get started and trying to pull in some things to relay the foundation and this faith that we've received is so precious it is such a precious thing so it must remain pure and if you think about how if we were at one time faithless without belief and didn't know what to believe and was aimless and didn't have direction but we hear the word of god preached and hearing the word it excites the faith in us and so in this faith being instigated where's the faith directed right back to the word that we heard and so we hear the word and it produces a faith we know that's god speaking to us so our faith is projected back to to god and to the word then we've got to keep that pure and we don't want to take the faith that god has given us to believe him to trust him to take him at his word if he says it he meant it we believe it and that kind of pure trust that we have to god we shouldn't take that faith and then direct it to anything else that doesn't mean that we need to be doubt everything else and disbelieve everything else and be suspicious of everything else but just realize that that dynamic of faith that pure faith is to the word so we don't want to take that faith and begin to direct it to anything else and then another sense faith being to the word maybe we can we keep our eyes on the word but there's things we start adding to the picture there's things we start adding to the word and things that become a part of the word so it's really not faith being directed alone to the word what we start to add a lot of other things into it and that's that's not going to make our faith real strong because we're adding things into it that doesn't inspire our faith so that's just a way maybe even to challenge ourselves in terms of whether our faith is really strong and robust and growing and so our faith is to the word we don't want to add to the word we don't want to add things into that picture now let's look at where we where we just read in second corinthians chapter five verse seven we mentioned it last time and i really wanted just to uh amplify this a little bit this morning uh paul is talking he's writing about an eternal tabernacle that is waiting in the heavens he says we have this earthly tabernacle but when this one is dissolved we have an eternal a body a building not made by hands waiting for us already in the heavens so he's he's established this present reality in this tabernacle we're groaning and we get sick and we get weak and we have we have disappointments so we're very we're very much aware of this tabernacle through five senses but he's telling them about another body that they obviously can't see and it'd be something else if we woke up every morning and there was this perfect specimen of a body there at the end of your bed that was like hey one day you're going to have me you know one day when you die you're going to be in this perfect body and so every day we just could kind of look at it man i'm going to fit real nice into that and it's going to be wonderful but that's not the reality we don't see that with our eyes so that's what paul is talking about when he makes this in in my bible and i think in most translations kind of that it's in parentheses and i believe it stands it really stands uh in a lot of different contexts we could make this statement but i want you to recognize the context that apologies in it in so that we don't make the wrong conclusions kind of like we do with uh what we refer to doubting thomas and you could build a lot of uh theology off of this doubting thomas doubting thomas but he arrived at faith eventually and brother adam there's only one place i find where brother branham refers to thomas as being a doubter or doubting thomas he never uses the phrase doubting thomas but i think he says about thomas the old doubter and he's using him as an example where sometimes in that pentecostal ranks they had to they had to have this and they had to have that there had to be signs it had to be these different things happening he says if you want to take the old doubter out that's the way that you want to go that's fine he says but god gave us his word and that's what we go by and and in the dynamics of thomas we wanted to look at it a little bit different to say well we can't take those scriptures to lead us to this conclusion that our faith is blind our faith was is without experience our faith is without some substance or evidence uh and and to so that we engage in kind of this blind trust and we never know what's coming we never really know what we're believing it we're just kind of blindly trusting um a story we don't want to take this scripture and we want to kind of look at it within its context to understand that paul is not advocating for blindness when it comes to faith but he says for we walk by faith not by sight again this does not mean that faith is blind because faith is a greater sense it accounts for a sense it's even called the sixth sense in in that it's going to declare something to us and in declaring some sense to us we can act upon that we can we can go forward so this is not blind trust and i think what one of the things that's kind of stern within my heart is we should never put faith in the place to where uh faith is ignorance or or faith is uh well is i don't want to know or i don't understand i don't i i can't figure this out i don't know that i don't know this and we kind of think that faith is always in this realm of uncertainty but yet despite all the uncertainty i have no idea i have no clue i don't have any understanding i don't have any wisdom but i believe we need to be careful that we don't put faith in the wrong wrong place that we understand faith is strong faith is burly faith has hair on its chest and faith is something that is wise and faith is something that is knowing faith in it self is is inspired by hearing the word so there's knowledge there's revelation there's wisdom that's associated with faith paul says for we walk by faith we're influenced by faith we're guided by faith we are governed by faith in what an unseen god and this is the reality paul's talking about we believe in a god that we have not seen and we trust in him and we and we love him and we've given ourselves to him so we're influenced guided and governed by a god who's unseen he says we walk by faith not by sight now when he says not by sight he's not referring to eyesight or the act of vision to where this is uh he's not saying that we walk by faith but we're blind but he's saying we walk by faith but not by the thing that is seen we walk by faith but not the shape of things so it says by sight it's speaking of shape or appearance so ponder how he phrases that then we walk by faith but not the the shape or appearance of something so he's saying while we're here on earth why we live here on earth faith takes the place of direct of a direct vision of heaven while we're here on earth faith takes the place of a direct vision of a new body while we're here on earth faith takes the direct a place the place of direct vision actually i seen the appearance or the shape of the things that are in glory so in the world to come paul is not saying that in the world to come we're going to be blind and we're not going to have eyesight and we're just going to kind of believe oh isn't heaven wonderful isn't this great but he's saying that while we're here on earth faith takes the place of actual vision but when we in the world to come we will have eyesight we will see the shape and appearance of things we will be fully present with only eternal things around us so then just as that that song really encouraged me this morning brother michael because i've been this very thought was that pondering it's part of my foundation that one day our faith is going to end in sight that we're not always just going to live believing in eternal things and just live believing in the resurrection and live believing in a rapture one day they were going to realize the realization the perfect realization of these things that are very real to us and a tremendous reality and a great joy but one day it's going to be absolutely full and complete and everything around us will be eternal you'll never see a flower fade you'll never see something dim you'll never see death and that's the reality that is awaiting the believer one day we're going to be fully present with only eternal things around us but while we're here he's saying here we have the word of god and here we have this promise we believe in the reality of his promises we believe actually we believe in the existence of invisible things that might put us in a little bit of a niche and there might be people out there say ooh you believe in invisible things too but uh we're not talking about uh you know ghost stories and and some kind of phenomena related to uh you know some kind of science fiction phenomena but we we believe in the existence of invisible things and we're influenced by them we are governed by things that we do not see we are driven by things that we have not seen as of yet so to walk by faith is to live in a confident expectation of things that are to come they even think about how where brother branham left us uh when his ministry was finished and i believe it was complete and i believe he delivered us a perfect word and where he comes to preaching the rapture and he preaches things that are to be what was he doing he said we ought to be notified beforehand of the things that are going to be this so that was this is part of the prophet's ministry of disclosing to us what things are going to be like so that we can have an expectation and we can have this confident expectation of things that are to be or things that are to come and so our faith is a belief in unseen realities that one day are going to be realized and then we we yield ourselves to them we allow these these things to influence us so i i want to in that with that we walk by faith not by sight we're not living now because we see the appearance of heaven with natural eyesight like we see oh there's the there's the exit up ahead and these are the things and that's what we're living by it's a faith in the things that god has promised in things that are unseen and those unthink unseen things are influencing us and i want to make this a point before i go forward we ought to be living in the end time with this desire to see the translation realizing that the word that we've received to the prophet and the word that we believe is focused on and centered around the change of our bodies in a translation and a rapture so we should be putting that in view and decisions that we make and the way that we treat one another and even our desire to come to church and to be where the word of god is preached that it's i'm not just living this life so that i can i can have a really good funeral and people could say things about me or i'm not just living this life i can figure out i can buy a burial plot and my goal is the grave no we in this hour can live under a different kind of expectation that this is the hour in the age of a rapture so there's uh there's a foundation i want to come back to it and say that we again hold this in your mind that we as believers live by faith in things that are not yet seen seen by the touch and the sea and the taste and the feel and the smell those things we have a faith a sense that declaring does something very real though it may not be declared in this in a way that everyone else can witness it and realize it so keep that in mind i want to come back to it now i want to read a statement i'm going to read a statement from balman gilead in 1959 and i referred to it in a couple services the first two services on the subject he says the one thing that we have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we have had so we have a faith and he's saying we want to move up to a supreme faith a more supreme faith than what we have had and he says you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you were doing so we have there's a faith he's saying we're moving up in faith and that's something we have to understand about faith is it can move up it can grow it can increase and so he says that supreme faith that he's talking about he says you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you're doing now don't be discouraged think oh well great if it takes a perfect understanding to perfectly know what i'm doing in order to have supreme faith i'm never going to get there no if the promise of supreme faith is imperfectly knowing what you're doing then god is going to let us know perfectly what we're doing so he's you just said this is very uh significant to me it impacted me tremendously you just say well i'm going home i'm going out to and start the car he said that's all an act of faith tomorrow i'll meet you at a certain place that's all an act of faith because you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you so what's it based upon you sit down in a car you're going to turn the ignition there's some you've had some understanding that the mechanics of sitting down in the driver's seat and turning the ignition is all for a purpose and accomplished something i need to go somewhere so i'm going to go to a car why do you go to a car because you know that that is a vehicle that can move by some sort of propulsion you may not understand all the mechanics of how an engine works but you know hey you know what people use these things to get from one point to another so there's some understanding there and he brings it to the place to say that we you sit in your car and you start the car and the reason why you expect your car to start is because it started before and so this is all an act of faith but it's been informed to these experiences he says tomorrow i'm going to meet in a certain place it's all just a regular routine this to me is so it's just profound well that's the way things of god are now this is very this is very striking starting your car going to meet somebody this regular routine he says after you've trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just like a regular routine now not common uh not taken for granted but it's in the routine of things it's something to where i've come to expect this i've come to know this and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god there's a way that we make the rapture be in mind the whole earth is just going to split open right these perfect bodies are going to come flowing up from these crevices or it's just going to be so so significant and so global and so worldwide that cnn's going to be running and it's going to be on the front page of every website but really we know it's the secret going away of the church to the bride the rapture is a revelation and so there's so much that we begin to realize about this translation and this rapture and so this statement brother man is putting this kind of i'm not trying to downplay the rapture it's going to be extravagant it's going to be glorious it's going to be amazing going to be supreme going to be epic with six eyes it's gonna be something that's really gonna be awesome however you wanna describe it so i'm not trying to downplay it but notice how we're gonna get there it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god now a regular routine he says it's an act of faith a regular routine is an act of faith where i'm routinely doing something with expectation and my expectations are being rewarded just as i get in my car start my car and i go somewhere that's all an act of faith and i'm going to meet somebody someone promises me they're going to meet me somewhere tomorrow i go there with the expectation that they're going to be there because it's happened before this is the regular routine of things taking place so it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god notice how this is not this is not blind a blind trust this is uh this is an experience it's a process of promise improve god made a promise he proved it god made a promise he vindicated god made a promise he confirmed it god said he would do it he did it and so we're in this regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god and we find ourselves being rewarded and experiencing the promises of god and experiencing the benefits of god and focus on this part this is the part that's really really strong in my heart and as that happens we begin to learn we can take god at his word and my faith gets stronger and stronger and stronger and so if you have just blind trust that can stagnate it gets cold it gets weak it kind of fizzles away bad faith cannot grow because you're trusting something that cannot energize you cannot invigorate you or strengthen you but true faith just as brother says we've got to move up now into a supreme faith true faith grows true faith increases all in this regular routine even if you look at it in the sense of uh somebody who lifts weights or there's some sort of exercise program or walks on a daily basis they people do that and they get in the habit and the routine of it and it's not that it becomes common it becomes a drudgery to them but they're benefiting from it they start doing something on a regular basis hey this works this helps me i benefit from this and they get in the regular routine of it and so in doing that they're receiving positive feedback and strength and endurance and energy that's the way that we ought to be in the scriptures to where there's this routine there's this discipline of trusting god and it causes our endurance our spiritual endurance our supernatural strength and our faith muscles to build and to grow and so we see the direct benefits of being in the regular routine of the scriptures and following god's plans all four he says a rapture in the message perfect faith and this is um it's some very heavy things i find that what he the point he's making here is very remarkable especially in the context of the message perfect faith has anyone listened or read the message perfect faith recently last few months or so last five years this sweet spot five years i'm just going to remember that and how many have listened to it this century and it's uh so this is it so you know if you can recall and i'm very familiar with we're very familiar with this sermon that brotherhood's trying to build faith even he says before a prayer line coming right and he's looking at this as being some something's building something's growing something's increasing he says now faith is the substance and by it we understand all those things are done so certain supernatural things taking place we understand it's by faith it's not an imagination it is a substance especially perfect faith that's what i'm talking on tonight getting to perfect faith it's not an imagination and this is the part to me that's just very uh is very staggering now others have people come say oh i got all faith oh sure i have well what are you standing here for then right you know in a prayer line have hands laid on your very actions prove you haven't got what you're talking about if you had faith then what you what what you stand in the prayer line for oh okay this is he's gonna be calling a prayer line and he's preaching because he wants to build people's faith but in in a sense this is the way and i don't like to maybe share my personal uh my personal opinion my on my regular job every day i get paid to give my opinion and i'm glad i have that outlet because when i do this i don't have to i don't give my opinion i'm not supposed to and i don't like to but to me it's almost as if brother branham is looking at something and he kind of he's wanting to build their faith he's not going to chastise him he's not wanting to uh you know belittle their faith he's want to take that faith and encourage it and if their faith can build and god can meet him on the prayer in a prayer line and something can happen then that ought to strengthen their faith as they leave like wow did you notice that the word built my faith up he met me on the platform and you leave with the stronger faith not not with the wrong kind of uh approach to god and not with this a cyclical attitude where he's always going in circles and it's never never progressive he's wanting to build them up and it's almost as if he kind of really he's letting out just in a moment of what he's really looking at saying look our faith should be increasing and growing and if you really are talking about how strong you are and how big your faith is and oh yeah i've got that kind of perfect faith he's kind of saying if you really had that then you wouldn't even be in the prayer line and he's not saying anything against prayer lines but he's wanting us to recognize something he says so he makes he asks this question if you had faith and why are you standing the prayer line notice what do you do these things for he's asking a question of what's your reason for doing this what's your it in and not so much maybe in the sense of motive and objective but what's your basis what are you basing this on what what are you looking to accomplish and why do we even why does god make a promise and then fulfill it is it just so he could he has like a bucket list and oh brother aaron asked for this okay well i guess we we got rid of that it's not a to-do list with god it's it's a it's a following the scriptures and the plans of god god has an objective god has a goal so when god does something in your life makes a promise and fulfills it he has this long-range vision to where that's fitting into the overall vision and picture of what he's wanting to accomplish in your life so he step back and say he healed me why did he heal me he's got a purpose in doing it brother mary even teaches us that he's got a purpose in healing us he had a purpose in saving you he had a purpose in doing these different things so he says what are you doing these things for see if you had perfect faith you'd look right straight to god and believe it and walk away you would have no need of coming into a prayer line you'd have no need of these things because your faith has done made it so now i i want to i acknowledge that just how striking that is and how it's really confrontational to say whoa okay he's going to be calling a prayer line he's wanting to faith to raise and he's wanting to see it come to a level and people are going to be coming through the prayer line later on in that service but he kind of slips this in to ask ourselves why are you doing this why are these things done and if you say oh i've got that kind of faith oh i sure of god he said then if you had that kind of faith you wouldn't be standing here no i want to make this point it doesn't mean if you had faith you'd never be standing there that doesn't make sense but he's saying that if you had that kind of faith you wouldn't be coming back here you just take god's word and go forward so he says what do you do these things for he's asking if there's an actual understanding or he's challenging our understanding of why we're doing these things why are you doing it what's your reason for doing it he's actually is there an understanding behind uh these actions in in the things that you're doing do you know what you're doing do you know why you're doing it do you even know why you're in a prayer line is it just because everybody else is well it's saturday night it's the special meetings right everybody puts on their prayer line shoes because that's just what happens he's saying hey are you just doing this traditionally are you just going up there because everybody else is do you know why you're doing it do you know upon what basis god's going to meet you there because it can't be hope so now i i'll say this because i i know uh i'm wanting to if we have time i'd like to get to this apportion in the service today but we there's a i want to trying to be very careful in the way i express this not that i don't want to give away what i'm going to be saying later but at this point i want to be very careful why i say it there's times in our lives when we look back in our christian experience and it's almost as if oh if i could just have that again like the glory years and the the glory days and the power of god was moving and i had this experience at the altar and i remember i could go through the prayer line and i could feel his presence and i could be healed and we almost look back like i just wish i could go back there again and have that and you wonder why it doesn't work again and i want you to ponder if maybe in that the way that you're looking at it you've allowed that to weaken your faith instead of strengthen it because instead of looking at all these wonderful things that god has done for you and just looking forward to what he has and said hey that's got me here so this must be good i'm not denying his word i'm not back in sin i'm not back in sickness again but i'm here i am god has done all these wonderful things for me so those things were powerful those things were supernatural and they've got me where i am today and begin to appreciate just how rich and mature your faith is as a result of those glory years and those wonderful days and those great times and say look i am more stable today because i'm not looking to those things and needing those things to trust god and believe them but they are a part of my pedigree my legacy and my history as a believer so they're ever present with me now now paul says for getting those things which are behind behind now we are connected to our past we're connected to our childhood we're the sum of the experiences that we've had in our past so we really can't leave them behind behind as if we could somehow divorce ourselves from them but realize i am where i am today as a result of all these forces and experiences and things that have moved to my life as a christian so i've got to use what's behind me as momentum to look forward impress on so brother branham makes this statement in the message communion and now i'm uh you all are just pulling so well listening so well today that i i realized i might have bitten off more than i could chew which in another parlance would be printed out more than i could preach i think i got more quotations and scriptures here then i'll be able to get to now this is this is his last last words to us and i look at this message as being very very uh special december 12 1965 he says now we're fixing to observe something here that's really sacred talk about communion i was called on a few days and i want you to i'm just using this story that brother branham tells him this to make make a point here i was called a few days ago to some very fine christian gentleman that's never had this and he understood that we've taken communion literally so here's a christian gentleman who's never taken communion he's like you guys are literally taking bread and wine he says they take in what they call spiritual communion now you think well that seems pretty far-fetched there's people that believe the message and believe there's really no literal rapture they just believe in a spiritual resurrection spiritual rapture no literal rapture and they're very very adamant about what we believe to be the prophet to be the messenger to the age and the word of god being true that we've received but they spiritualize everything there's no literal reality to it this is somebody of some group that didn't take literal communion because they took it spiritually and which as far as communion i'd say all right because communicate is to talk see and the brother give me this scripture said brother don't you think now and so he's looking at this this brother's using the scripture to say don't you see that this is as we take the word of god in the spiritual communion that that takes the place of a literal communion see that reason i'm saying this is so that you would understand what you're doing whether i was addressing this in bringing this up and he's taking time to teach on communion so that whenever one comes to take communion they understand what they're doing so we do not have even when it comes to the things of god he doesn't i know we do this sometimes as parents and there's a time to do it but he doesn't just say take communion because i told you so well why because i told you so why do you guys take him in well the bible says it we just do it because the bible says it if the bible says it we should accept that there's got to be some reason behind it that there's a there's a divine purpose a divine motive a designed plan there's a there's a plan of god behind these scriptures that we follow and so he says i i want you i re saying this so that you'd understand what you're doing if you walk into anything blindly you don't know where what you're doing you can't even have you can't even confidence it have confidence even in you can't have even confidence if you don't know what you're doing we need confidence we need some sort of sureness and stability that we need to have faith he says you can't have confidence if you don't know what you're doing but you must understand what you're doing and why you are doing it these are the things that we are taught in the message of the hour we believe we trust in him and having trusted in him he says after you've trusted him you've watched and do so many things to it just becomes like a regular routine by then there's understanding there's you know the character of god you know the nature of god you know what he promised you're working in wisdom and knowledge and revelation in these different things he says you must understand what you're doing and why you're doing it he said now if we take the word of god isn't that god that we're taking this is the young christian gentleman who had spiritual communion if we take the word aren't we aren't we taking god and i say i said exactly right sir it's true but we read here that they actually paul taught taking the literal lord's supper so this is brother branham identifying how that some tradition had stripped away the meaning of the word that some interpretation well we take the scripture and if we take the word of god aren't we taking god and so it's kind of taken away the real understanding of the word paul is teaching a literal communion and here's somebody people taking the same scriptures twisting them around a little bit and stripping away the the real act behind it and brothers saying the reason the problem exists because there's no understanding then we say oh well i just need to be communing with god i can just pray i can just read the word and as i read the word i'm eating the word and there's revelation that's the intoxication from the wine and so there's the bread and the wine and so i have communion anytime i read my bible and pray and any time god speaks to me and discloses things to me brother i'm saying that's all fine he's actually saying that's wonderful that's great but paul is talking about literal communion so there was some it's very unique because i don't know that i've ever myself met anyone who believed this brother branham explains it in enough detail to realize that this was some mythology based on the word it wasn't denying the word outright but he's actually taken the scripture and said i showed him a scripture don't you think that it means this so they were basing it on the word but it's not actually the word the thought behind it the real meaning go ye and all the world baptize them in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost we say oh let's be very strict that's what it means that's what it said but then you do that and you follow that to the letter and you find that you lack the revelation and the meaning of it to be baptized in the name of jesus christ and so it could be based on the word but be entirely against the word and so in that taking that kind of approach to scripture oh well it says this and it says that and maybe we should do this and and take it this way it had actually taken their trust in the word of god and misdirected it not in what the meaning of the word was and not what the word literally was or really was but into some explanation or false interpretation so they developed this mythology even a religion can be built around those things and whenever they their trust is misdirected that's basically that's trust that is blind and that can only produce bad faith and a faith that's not growing is bad faith he could never be this person could never be walking in the scripture and brother brahman says look if you don't understand what you're doing you can't even you can't walk into anything blindly you have to know what you're doing you must understand what you're doing and why you're doing it if that's the case then our prayers ought to be lord i want to understand what i'm doing i want to understand why i'm doing it and and even if that becomes a routine to you to where you you're desiring that and seeking that it can even cause you as you seek those spiritual things and to have this benefit of knowing what i'm doing and why i'm doing it it'll give you discernment and wisdom to begin to identify natural things that you're doing so you can ask myself what am i doing why am i doing that and realizing wow maybe i shouldn't be doing it once you start having this understanding to realize what you're doing and why you're doing it doesn't fit within the wisdom of the word and the expediency of the work of god in your life and even in the lives of your children and others that you're around it becomes a really strong mechanism of our faith to be able to know what we're doing and why we're doing it in matthew chapter 15 and i want to use this story of this exchange as an ex as it will it's going to come to jesus tells his disciples hey they're they're blind leaders of the blind so we're looking at blind trust and bad faith and really these pharisees and these jewish leaders made arguments in bad faith they're making a bad faith argument here there is a blind trust of the people in these bad faith arguments so there's a lot of ways that what was inspired to me and how i've been studying this personally brings me to this place but i want to i want to read through it and maybe not get uh go piece by piece in too much detail but matthew chapter 15 verses 1 to 14. it says then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands and when they eat bread so they are being he's been challenged as to why his disciples transgress notice the tradition of the elders but he answered the sin of them why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition ooh okay what do we call that these days micah a sick burn is that it do i get an instagram credit for that uh this is something where oh you need some melody for that is what they needed after after jesus comes right back says your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders by not washing their hands when they and he says well why do your traditions transgress the hand of god i say that's checkmate your traditions transgress the commandment of god why does it matter if we transgress your traditions your traditions are contrary to the word he says for god commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he that curseth father and mother let him die the death jesus now points to deuteronomy 5 16. he points to exodus 21 17 jesus has the very words of the prophet and the very words of god to say god commanded honor thy father and mother he also commands curses he that curses his father and mother let him die the death this is what god said he says but ye say whosoever shall say to his father his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me in honor not his father is his mother he shall be free so even though the scripture says he ought to be put to death you liberate him and free him thus have you made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition ye hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draw nine to me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men now i'm going to try to put this in just a little bit different terms so we can understand this in deuteronomy 5 exodus 21 the word created an obligation and i'll just put it in maybe more modern terms created an obligation for a child to support his parents if they were in need so provide some sort of relief and uh to give them some sort of aid to give them uh food or money or some some some sort of if they were in need and deficit then the word obligated a son or a daughter to give to their parents to meet their needs but jesus is saying that the pharisees and these other jewish leaders had honored a tradition and created a tradition that actually was against the word where they said and this is what jesus said they're saying even if your parents are in need and your parents need your support you may give your money and give your support money to the church instead like the word would obligate you to give this money to your parents but will it in order for you to fulfill your obligation in the word but we'll let you give it to the church and by giving it to the church you fulfilled your obligation and you can go free and you realize how that how that breaks down by their man-made tradition they voided the direct commandment of god's word and in doing so they bypassed the wisdom of the word that you create this obligation where children were to support their parents with their need why so that their parents who are in need could be supported and it creates this discipline and an honor and it's a it's a system that would help maintain the health of families and the health of the nation and keep everyone supported but the church comes up with a different way and really to line their pockets to make them look better and and to satisfy their means and they bypass the word of god and in direct violation of god's word and so they come up with and this is where i just trust god could amplify this to your minds and in your hearts because i think this is could be applied in so many other ways and it could be more instructive if the holy spirit did it for you than me just using examples but they came up with the religious function that profited the church and justified the worshiper or the individual but didn't honor god's word came up with some sort of religious function something you could do that would profit the church make the individual feel justified but didn't honor god's word i feel like in some ways i've just defined catholicism and so there's other ways brother vincent caught on to that then there's other ways that you might be able to recognize that maybe in and not so whoa that's way down there we're not catholics but there's ways we can become message catholics there's ways that we can become very denominational become very religious and perform things through some sort of perfunctory religious duty that's going to benefit the church and the overall church and the church system this church structure make me feel good about myself but what what was i doing why was i doing it how has the word of god been on to honored and if we're not if we don't know what we're doing and why we're doing it am i following the routine of the scriptures in the plan of god that's going to benefit me when the rapture is going to come through what following the routine of the scriptures in the plan of god that's how the rapture is going to take place but if i find myself entering more into this blind trust into a religious system in some sort of a structure and function where i can give i can do something within this context and it benefits the church and makes me feel good but that's not going to get you closer to a rapture and when we pause for a moment and ask ourselves is what i'm doing why i'm doing it getting me closer to a body change that'll cause a lot of people to change what they're doing if they really want a body change we came to that realization as a famine this is very personal but we came to this realization as a family that what we were doing and where we were and what was taking place was not getting us closer to supreme faith and that if that's what we wanted as a as individual christians and that's what we wanted for our children then we had to make a very difficult decision to be where we could get supreme faith i thank god it's in phoenix now but we're challenged by this idea it's not just going to church it's not just oh is there a church there does the church believe the message oh great i want to go there i want to be where i know the word i'm hearing is creating an opportunity for me to follow in the routine of the scriptures fulfill the plan of god for a rapture because this is rapture season jesus is just taking this uh uh the religion and the pharisitical approach to tradition and saying listen your traditions are real strong and real great and all figured out makes everybody feel good but you're not even honoring god's word and he called the multitude verse 10 and said unto them hear and understand and this really this really bothers these pharisees not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth that defileth the man in other words it's not eating non-kosher food that's going to corrupt you because this is what's so big the the religious function and the and all the sticklers of all these other things and that if you eat this it's going to defile you says it's not eating non-kosher food that's going to corrupt a man and make him wicked he says it's that which cometh out of the mouth that defileth a man now he's going to expound upon this later because the disciples asked maybe peter says can you explain this a little bit more to me and he says hey whatever you eat just comes out right body digest it but he's saying there's things that are morally corrupt within a man in on the inside and that comes out that's where the corruption is so after he makes this statement that really runs against the tradition of the elders and these jewish leaders and these pharisees of hey don't worry all this non-kosher food you think that's eating that meat is really going to morally corrupt somebody he says then came his disciples in him know us thou that the pharisees were offended after they heard the saying boy you really offended him this time but he answered and said every plant which my father heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up a strong language let them alone he says they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch he's saying the pharisees are blind they are blind leaders of the blind and if the blind are leading the blind the blind leaders fall in the ditch and the blind followers fall into the ditch so they're saying the pharisees are blind because and they're blind to what the word of god they're blind to they they could probably quote deuteronomy 5 they could do quote exodus 21 they knew honor thy father and their mother and he that revived his father and mother is to be cursed and and they understood those things but then they're blind to what they were doing and why they were doing it and they come up with what they think is a tradition that in their minds they rationalize somehow satisfied the obligation that was created by the commandment of god but it was actually anti-word they said they're blind they don't have any understanding they don't even know what they're doing and why they're doing it and everyone else is blind following blind leaders and if you're following a blind leader jesus says you fall into a ditch if you're blind you'll fall in a blind leader you follow there's no progress there was no benefit from the traditions it was actually making the word of god of none effect in other words the word has a purpose it ought to be effective it ought to produce something in your life it ought to bring you further in this spectrum of faith but when you make it a tradition you're going to stay within that tradition so you're stumbling in darkness you know not what you stumble at you're not going forward you're not this is not the path of the just that shineth more and more into a perfect day you're kind of caught in this system you're caught in this paradigm you're caught in this way of viewing things and it's traditionally it stagnates and it grows cold he says there's no progress there's just stumbling there's a saying i think was a ball player back in the 70s made a comment he couldn't tell if he was in a groove or a rut right because if you're in a groove and in some ways it's kind of shaped like a rut but when you're when you're when you're on a road this is something that's been grooved out this is something that's been playing now something that's been leveled out for you to go on a particular path so that you can be more expedient in your travel well you could there's a ditch that can line that and basically kind of go in the same way as the road but it's a lot harder to make the way in the ditch than it is on the road and so here they stumble into the ditch they seem to be real close maybe ride in the border like but you can't make progress in the ditch now i want you to ponder this and think about this they be blind leaders of the blind if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch he does he is not making the proposition i know he didn't think about this but just by me bringing it up maybe it's i would have never thought of that but it caused us to think about the scripture in another dimension he's not making the proposition that we ought to be blind followers it's not the fact that there was blind leaders that was bad so as long as the blind or following a sighted leader were okay but they're both wrong you don't want to be a sighted leader leading the blind but a lot of people these days want their sheep to be blind right and they want to blind trust and accept all my bad faith arguments because they they're the leaders with vision and follow me i'm going to lead you to a rapture and they exploit these things to the detriment of the people and they get away with it because the people are told keep your head down close your eyes trust me and the bible is saying no that's not how jesus is not saying it's okay for you to be blind if your leaders are sighted is saying the leaders ought not to be sighted or they ought not to be blind and neither should you be blind with the scriptures not telling us that we are to be blind followers to be a blind follower is blind trust and bad faith we should never follow anything blindly i feel like i'm doing all right with time so i'm going to read this statement i'm going to read through it and i want you to just kind of catch what brother branham is writing here in chapter 4 of the church age book it's time to get back to god they have a name that they live but are dead tongues aren't the evidence of revival it is the evidence of death tongues proclaimed the evidence that the ceremonial religion of the jews was over that a new era had begun now this is pretty heavy stuff tongues is not the evidence of revival it's the evidence of death this is very very striking and the way that he's putting it in this context it to be very uh i think we should we should desire to really catch the theme the heart of what the prophet is expressing tongues today are ringing down the curtain of the gentile church ages and the gospel's going back to the jews so once we have the restoration of the gifts and speaking in tongues it was once again signifying a new era a change it says people are talking about tongues heralding in a great spiritual move they have missed the boat that's quite a phrase for formal writing they have missed the boat the truth is that it is writing the finish to all of man's ideas programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of god is being ushered in so the speaking in tongues is not in itself this great awakening this spiritual move this great revival in the tongue all the tongues this is life this is revival brother said no the restoration of the gifts is now signifying that we're entering into a new era the curtain is coming down on the gentile kingdom and there's a move of god where man's ideas and programs and kingdoms are going to be torn down and the kingdom of god is going to have preeminence that's what it's a symbol of wake up people of god wake up he says if you don't think this is true just listen to this all over the world in both pentecostal and fundamental groups they're organizing the businessmen they have invaded the pulpit without a call from god they have styled themselves the fishers of men and the founders of a move of god this is very stag striking here they say the gifted ministry of ephesians 4 10 to 13 that god gave the church has failed so they are taking over actually he specifically said we've had all these preachers for some 55 years and hadn't had a rapture yet so let's just go back to tapes only isn't that interesting here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy calling the game sayings of korra and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth so it's blind leaders preaching what experience for truth in other words the experience itself becomes the truth well did you speak in tongues then you got it did you feel it then you got it it doesn't have its bases in the word of god he's not it's not bringing it back to god made the promise god fulfilled the promise god said he would do this god did that so they are blindly preaching experience for truth they are blind leaders and in reality this is to me it may be a the perfect way to understand that scripture blind leaders can only lead the blind because a blind leader is never going to get away with leading somebody who could see because they're like uh do you even know what you're doing and why you're doing it i have no idea where you're going i have no idea what you're trying to do this is not right i can see better than this my sheep hear my voice and they'll not follow they will not follow another they will follow only him and they can tell by the way this guy is going he is just making this up as he goes he's a blind leader of the blind and therefore it's saying that if you have eyes to see follow what you see follow what you know and don't blindly accept experience for truth he says may god have pity on them may their eyes be opened before it is too late oh listen to me and this is i just wanna i actually was gonna take it out i thought that this would be just perfect just to let this marinate for a while when did the prestige of money social leadership business ability or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man for spiritual leadership or give any weight to the word of god why should any of these things give more weight to what somebody is saying than just the word itself how would this give anybody more spiritual leadership than the word that they preach and when in any way materiality or human values begin to show as the media by which god works isn't that remarkable media wouldn't even is more prominent these days social media just entertainment media materiality or human values begin to show as the media by which god works instead of the holy spirit alone then we are fighting against god not for him when we allow materiality and human values to begin to show as the means by which god works and the way that we think god is working in the evidence by which god is moving when we look to all these natural things instead of the holy spirit alone we're actually fighting against god it's not enough that you've it's not that you've created your own arena and you're just over here playing church you've actually lined yourself up on a battlefield and drawn a line and you've stood against god's word it's not like you're just off playing a game somewhere by yourself oh we're just gonna do this and believe that he says you're actually fighting against god not for him and when paul said we walk by faith not by sight he is characterized the believer of having a particular dispens a disposition strong conviction and faith that we walk by things that aren't seen and then so it's a paradox in that brother branham is talking about blind leaders preaching experience for truth so some experience is something that the senses are having to declare to you and he says open your eyes so what are they blind to the spiritual reality of things it's not really faith it's not just it's not that real conviction because he says money social leadership business ability share mental prowess materiality human values is what people are drawn to and if you think about the world today as contrasted by a true believer the body of christ they're influenced by the things that are seen that's what influences them and so if they can see it they trust what they're seeing and they go they're only going by what is presented to them in the appearance paul says we walk by faith not just the mere appearance of things we walk by faith not just by how things appear because sometimes things will appear in a certain way but we have to have discernment to try the spirit to know whether it be of god or not to get behind it and understand the motive objective behind it so we're not just always going by appearance but the world goes by appearance they live for pleasure they live for possessions they live for popularity this is this is how the world lives if it can bring them pleasure they'll do it if it can bring them possessions and money and wealth they'll do it if they can bring them fame they'll do it it's things what the world lives by are things that only the world can give and when you put it in that context when paul says we walk by faith not by sight the world lives as if there's nothing unseen and when you talk about the tenets of communism brother man talks about communism taking over america communism one of its uh foundational beliefs is that there is nothing unseen there is not a supernatural there is not something beyond this everything there's got to be there's no uh subjective truth it's ev everything's common everything's agreed upon there's no supernatural there's no god beyond what we see there's things there it's only what's in this world that we can touch and taste and and these different things so that actually the world lives merely they do not they live as if there's nothing unseen and they live only by the appearance of things and just even in our base nature as human beings we really do blindly trust what we can see we blindly trust we can touch and what we can taste and what we hear we can hear something and we're very it's very easy just to believe what we heard and what's the uh the i don't think it's called the truth fallacy trying to remember exactly what fallacy of truth might be what it's called that the more often you hear something the more likely you are to believe that it's true even if it's a lie just because you hear it so much and so don't you don't you see the challenge and the hour that we're living in we're through every channel through every way there's things there's lies there's myth truths there's fake news or all sorts of stuff that's trying to be channeled and presented to us and we might hear it and be like well that doesn't sound right but you keep hearing it and pretty soon you're like well i heard or you just believe it to be true you're not even sure why you do it's just through the repetition of a lie and we have to be very careful to realize the world lives by that metric that's how that's science science it's got to be something that can be confirmed tested proven confirmed hypothesized subject to a very rigorous method to come up with some some immutable fact of this method and the world lives by what can be touched lives by what can be seen what can be tasted and felt and they live by that without any realization or consideration of what may be unseen let's just live this life and enjoy this life what about a life to come they don't live with this reality that they're going to be called to answer for what they see and what they taste and what they do brother brown in the church age book the same chapter chapter 4 he's talking about the misunderstanding and the false teaching that you can have an experience of being born again and have eternal life and then there's another experience of receiving the seal of god or the baptism of the holy ghost so there's like this one is the salvation and and they'll be born again and you have eternal life and then there comes this another baptism of dynamic power and he's saying there's that there's he said they're one and the same but there's this teaching that kind of divides and tries to separate him in the church age book he's being very particular to divide that out he says what is it that caused this misunderstanding that would separate the two he said the answer is experience what has caused this misunderstanding experience it could be the blind preachers right blindly preaching experience for truth they take their experience and cause a misunderstanding well i remember i got saved when this happened then i got the holy ghost later so i must have been born again then and got the holy ghost later and they try to take their experience and make it fit take the word and make it fit their experience he says listen listen as he says we've gone by experience and not the word away with experience as your measuring line there's only one plumb line only one rod and that is the word so not this is this is a it's i i use the term paradox because it's interesting that people are using experience as validation experience for truth and they say well spirit i can see it i can feel it i can taste it i i've heard it this is wonderful this is great we're interacting with it and brother is saying call that that's blind he's saying that is blindness why because it's not faith in the word because faith is a greater eyesight he said you guys are just blindly trusting your experience oh you felt good and it was like this happened and this happened oh that must be why but he said you've got to come back to the word you've got to base it on the word so he goes so far and say away with experience as your rod away with experience as your measurement well i remember when i was 13 i gave my heart to lord and i was born again and i received eternal life and then i didn't get the seal again i lived in sin and this happened to him i didn't get the holy ghost until later don't try to take your experience and make sense of the word just accept the word thank god for prior experiences thank god for giving your life as a young child thank god for his rescuing out of sin if you backslid don't take your experience as the measuring line and try to make the word fit your experience just know that your experience fit the word that one day through everything i experienced and everything that i went through whether that was my justification and this was my sanctification just rest in the fact that you were born again by the baptism of the holy ghost that you've had that sure experience because that's a word experience and i want to this is i well i'm just going to try to go quickly here i'll go as long as my voice will hold out i told them to turn down the monitors i think they just turned them off because it must just be a real sweet spot there between what sounds good to me and what they can actually do back there and so i think i'm getting out losing my voice this is where now i feel like you're right with me now this might i want to bring this balance to it brother brown is saying we've gone by experience and not the word away with experience is the plumb line experiences cause misunderstanding blind leaders are preaching experience for truth and it can kind of create this ah ooh well experience i don't know but faith true faith is a process of believing god's promise and experiencing him fulfilling it right so faith is vindicated through experience so for us we've gone we've actually been in the place where we didn't believe anything and god we hear the word preached and we experience something and that's what causes us to believe and so faith is vindicated through miracles and signs and wonders in mark chapter 16 verses 17 and 18 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall cast they shall cast out devils that's going to be an experience they shall speak with new tongues that's an experience that shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover these are experiences of miracles but this has been said before notice it says these signs shall follow them that believe we've heard it so many times it's cliche it's just kind of yeah yeah yeah brother and we hear this every time the scripture is mentioned believers aren't following the signs we're not even believing the signs but these signs shall follow them that believe and if you get that mixed up you're going to get mixed up there's no telling where you're getting an apostasy in rejection and blasphemy when you get it the other way around where i'm going to believe the sign no signs follow the believers so you have to in looking at this i brought this up in the lateness of the hour and been long preaching already and i know you're being very very faithful just to stay focused i appreciate that never forget that the context of this these signs follow the believers these things are done to vindicate faith these things are done by virtue of faith these signs follow them that believe they're a confirmation of faith they're vindication of faith and this is what i'll be very careful maybe i realize maybe it would be good just to start singing take the name of jesus with you because i want you to i don't want you to lose sight of i don't want you to put this in the wrong part of the puzzle these things do not become the object of faith these things come out of faith confirm faith but they're not the object of faith where we let experience take precedent over the word we're now everything is just all about whether or not we can feel and we could do this miracle and do this and do that and it all becomes about that and said this is this this is the outflow of my faith these things happen because i believe god i take god at his word i'm trusting him there's a need that arises i pray i lay my hands on the sick these things take place we don't become serpent hunters i just find a snake today somebody brings snake anybody brings snake they handle snakes so we can assume what proof prove that we're believers i want to go to the altar now i might be able to hurry right there you keep passing my time out of there because i think in tongues right that's what i'm looking for i want to have the experience we don't become experienced hunters we trust the word of god we believe the word of god these signs shall follow them that believe and i am trusting to see that in our lives we'll experience these things as we believe god and take him at his word and as these things transpire and take place these signs that follow the believer they become a part of the purpose and plan of god to what perfect you your character and to rapture the bride this is what they're all for this is what these things ought to be doing these things are done to make confirm our faith to vindicate that we're on the right path that we can trust god to where we get to the place to where it's just the regular routine of following the scriptures in the plan of god after you've trusted him and watched him do many things till it just becomes a regular routine so we're not just focused on manufacturing these things but in doing what god's will these things happen because they follow the believer brother branham in the message perfect faith we quoted earlier he says if you had faith what are you standing in the prayer line for he says the word operated in human flesh by physical signs by material signs by scriptural signs perfectly to bring to you a perfect faith for a perfect rapture so then it must be the word operated in the human flesh the word operating in human flesh will bring physical signs material signs scriptural signs and that ought to bring us to a perfect faith for perfect rapture but that's not going to happen if our faith is centered on the signs and our faith is centered on the materiality of things and our faith is centered on and those things become the object of our faith and not the the result of our faith because our faith must be centered on the word we must understand the purpose of these things jesus says in luke chapter 6 verses 39 and 40 and he spake a parable unto them can the blind lead the blind if we answered yes the the truth is not well but the blind cannot lead the blind to the gold the purpose i know they say a broken clock is right twice a day i don't know what if that one's right or not i got one in front of me tells me i'm i'm late i know that say a blind scroll can find a nut every once in a while so we're not talking about blind luck blind can't really lead the blind cannot make the goal and shall they both not vote he says shall they not both fall into the ditch but then watch this next part this is the part to me it's so beautiful blind leaders of the blind you're a blind leader you're a blind follower guess what you're always going to be blind so the result is the same and you both end up in the ditch so in that way you do have a scenario where hey i followed really really well i'm just like my leader he's blind he's in a ditch i'm blind i'm in a ditch look at this is great it worked we're all the same but he says the disciple is not above his master but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master in other words if you have faith and you're following god you'll never be greater than christ you'll never be above them but the object of following god's plan the object of just a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god the object of following god and following the word in signs following you is that you would be perfect as he is perfect that's the object of our faith and god confirming his promises is not that we would always be in a state of need but if our master had a faith then we could come to that supreme faith if christ lived a particular way then we can live that way we're not always these gravely beggars in need but we are becoming as our teacher the disciple can become perfect just as his master and the message unchangeable word of god he said that's the reason they give prayer cards if you don't you'll come right back in the line again come back again it just weakens your faith each time go weaker and weaker weaker and weaker but the man referenced the problem he had early on in his ministry i believe where he said the angel lord told him that the people are going to get to the place to where they won't do anything unless they see a sign and he said it hinders he even talked about how he entered his ministry because things always had to go to direct positive so instead of assigning creating a faith to say wow god said he would do that and he did it well if god can do that then he can do this it creates this very narrow paradigm through which people want to meet god it always has to be at the altar it always has to be in a prayer line it always has to be in this particular way and god i think god is very gracious to us sometimes to withhold from us that same ex that that experience and to not keep meeting us there because he's like look i got so much more for you the the and to recognize the very faith that's trying to that i'm trying to use to draw me back to that is trying to tell me you could take him where you are at hearing the word of god you can take him right where you are and he recognizes this dynamic you would think that if coming through a proud especially one that let's just all be honest we could all agree well brother aaron you're going to have a prayer meeting every sunday and we went through it i already just get weaker and weaker it's me right but with the brother branham this is my brother brown's prayer line if you come back through this prophet's prayer line he's saying it weakens your faith each time go weaker and weaker weaker and weaker he doesn't explain it but i don't think we have to have real deep uh understanding and knowledge to kind of figure out why you would your faith would get weaker when you come through the prayer line for your healing don't get it and come back again and are you convinced are you absolutely convinced oh no you just you know you just didn't pray long enough last time you're coming in doubt the second time well it didn't work the first time hopefully it'll work the second time maybe the third time's the charm what's happening each time expectation disappointment and you think oh wow i mean is it really going to work he's identifying that there's no vision to begin with there's no understanding upon the word of god the basis that you're meeting him the word of god that you're claiming and staking your promise on the faith that you're utilizing and acting in to even come to the prayer line and because of that there's no progress and when you keep trying to jump start it again your faith is getting weaker and weaker instead of stronger and stronger and he approaches it from this standpoint and the message perseverant brother brother mike if you guys could come just to create expectation for a close he says what's the use of coming up here if you're just walking up here he said a perfect faith if you if what do you stand at what are you coming up here for what do you do these things for he says you walk through tommy hicks line tommy osborne oral robbers then back and forth through the line it only weakens your faith that's all when you come here with the full assurance that you're not walking before your brother or anyone else you're coming here because the spirit of god in you has bid you to come something's going to happen that's the reason why you would do it not because it's called and everyone else is going you're not even going because oh i remember that one time at camp that's where i met god i want to feel that again and you're in prayer line trying to figure out why you're there what should i ask for hmm that's not what you do it for he said there's something where you know your bid to come something's going to happen there isn't nothing to keep it from it until then you're just on a walk until then you're just on a walk and you know what walking on a regular even there's even some people go to get uh emotional i need a i need a pill for this anxiety i need this and doctors will just say go on a walk go for a walk it's therapeutic walk and talk therapy it beats a lot of drugs that are out there because there's a benefit of physiological benefit there's an emotional benefit from walking and exerting yourself in the natural the mind and the body but this walk it's only going to weaken your faith you mean i could walk here and walk there run there run here and it weakened my faith yeah because faith works differently it's not through repetition alone just like anybody that lifts weights he'll tell you it's not just the reps you got to be doing them right if you're not doing the reps right you could be doing your body greater harm and no good at all and i think the same with faith muscles there's been things we've sought through the repetition of things and it really didn't make us stronger it made us weaker because we didn't understand what we were doing and why we were doing it he says until then you're just on a walk right around just on a walk right around next minister comes in town right around next minister comes right around that's no good then he says this there's nothing in a preacher no more than there is in your husband or your brother or whoever it might be we are just representatives of his telling you the word some of them have different gifts which the bible speaks of these gifts and i love this part this is all done to vindicate his presence let me say this just to clarify it's all done to vindicate his presence for you not for me not for the preacher not with the one who's getting ready to lay his hands on you not for the one that called the prayer line and we get names we maybe we could read this little bit differently you walk through tommy hicks line tommy osborne on line oral roberts line maybe we have different names today for our circle of fellowship the ministers that we god has met us in and god has vindicated godly men in this hour that he has vindicated with signs and gifts and we've witnessed it but yet there's a dynamic that brother branham's identifying that if you go through these lines and you don't understand what you're doing and why you're doing it you're just on a walk because when you went through that prayer line years ago and god met you the power of god fell upon you and you were healed or still with the holy ghost or spoke with tongues and whatever happened that didn't vindicate the minister it didn't vindicate the camp what it ought to have done is vindicated to you the presence of god in your life and how personal and intimate he wants to become and then you realize i've got access to this god without a prayer line without a cathedral without a tent meeting without a without a congregation without a preacher i've got access to the divine presence and whether it be pillars of fire or angels or tongues or miracles or signs and wonders you begin to have a personal intimate relationship with god and that becomes your type post because these things are done to vindicate his presence cause us to go forward walk further in the word of god who do we bow our heads this is a prayer that brother branham prays and i want there to be something instinctive inside of you something to help you something to encourage you brother branham and modern events are made clear by prophecy december 6 1965 [Music] and father as we open this word now speak to us directly out of this word that we might know the hour that we are living if we know the hour we are living then we can prepare for that hour listen but if we go in blindly not knowing what or where then we don't know how to prepare think of this preparation [Music] what am i doing that's preparing me for rapturing faith how are these things how are the me seeking signs and miracles and wonders and tongues and gifts in great choirs and moot specials or whatever it might be whatever they might sensitize you and really get you stirred up make you feel that god is moving how is all this preparing me for rapturing faith and this is his prayer i make this let's make this our prayer today as this morning is closing so father we pray that you will let us see the ark there and the door open and the message calling us in granted through jesus christ's name he says amen father we pray that you'll let us see the ark there the door open in the message calling us in that's what i want to see do everything that transpires i want to be calling me i want it to be the message calling me into this open door that vindicates his presence that gives me a faith to believe when it's hard to believe let's bow our heads stand together with me today you
