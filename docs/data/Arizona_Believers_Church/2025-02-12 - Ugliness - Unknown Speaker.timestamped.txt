[0:00] my title is
[0:01] ugliness and so if you feel targeted
[0:04] tonight you might have a complex about
[0:07] your looks uh but we do want to deal
[0:09] with the subject of ugliness and our
[0:12] text from Deuteronomy chapter
[0:14] 17 and just verse one Thou shalt not
[0:18] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any
[0:20] bulock or sheep wherein is blemish or
[0:23] any evil favored for that is an
[0:26] Abomination unto the Lord thy God Thou
[0:30] shalt not sacrifice un the Lord thy God
[0:32] any bulock or sheep wherein is blemish
[0:34] or any evil favored this for that is to
[0:37] sacrifice any one of those things is an
[0:40] Abomination unto the Lord thy God Amen
[0:44] we ask God to bless these words that
[0:46] we've read tonight you can be seated if
[0:49] you just keep your finger there let keep
[0:51] your Bibles open to that and concentrate
[0:54] on that I want to pick back up there on
[0:57] this verse and as we've already
[0:58] mentioned our title is ugliness we'll
[1:00] come back to that here in a moment but
[1:03] as it says Thou shalt not sacrifice unto
[1:05] the Lord thy God any bulock or sheep
[1:07] wherein is blemish or any evil favored
[1:11] so it is a bulock which encompasses a
[1:13] lot of different livestock sheep wherein
[1:16] is blemish or evil favor that is offered
[1:18] for sacrifice so it's not that a sheep
[1:21] with blemish is an Abomination to the
[1:23] Lord but it's when something is
[1:24] presented as a sacrifice or an offering
[1:26] to God he considers it a an abomination
[1:31] I just want to take a few moments to
[1:32] look at that uh term or things that are
[1:35] an Abomination and it means a disgusting
[1:38] thing something that is detestable or
[1:40] abhor a loathsome might be a word that
[1:43] we might use and how many here have
[1:45] heard the word Abomination before I'm
[1:47] not saying an Abomination I'm saying
[1:50] Abomination and it is a disgusting thing
[1:53] or something that is
[1:55] detestable and an Abomination generally
[1:58] in the Old Testament was just something
[2:00] disgusting or foul I know when we think
[2:02] Abomination we think in terms of maybe
[2:04] something as we've just read that God
[2:07] detest but there are different things in
[2:09] the Bible that are referred to as an
[2:12] Abomination uh and they're just things
[2:14] that would make you recoil or make you
[2:15] turn away and think oh that's disgusting
[2:18] in Genesis
[2:20] 43:32 and it's speaking about Joseph and
[2:24] his Breen and they set on they for him
[2:26] by himself and for them by themselves
[2:28] and for the Egyptians which did eat with
[2:30] them by themselves because the because
[2:32] the Egyptians might not eat bread with
[2:34] the Hebrews for that is an Abomination
[2:37] unto the Egyptians so to the Egyptians
[2:40] there were things that they considered
[2:43] detestable or disgusting and here the
[2:46] sons of Abraham uh they would not eat
[2:48] with him they would not eat with the
[2:49] Hebrew because they would eat things in
[2:52] animals that the Egyptians worshiped and
[2:54] that's one speculation and so they they
[2:56] were offended if you sat down and
[2:58] someone thought that the the hamburger
[2:59] you're about to eat could have possibly
[3:01] been their ant they might find that to
[3:03] be offensive so there were Abominations
[3:06] to the Egyptians this it has nothing to
[3:08] do with one true God it has nothing to
[3:10] do uh with anything scriptural or
[3:12] spiritual the Egyptians found what the
[3:14] things that the Hebrews would eat they
[3:16] found him to be an
[3:18] abomination in Leviticus 19:7 it says if
[3:22] it be eaten at all on the third day
[3:24] prior verses speak of an offering to the
[3:27] Lord when it may be eaten and then says
[3:30] if it's eaten at all on the third day it
[3:31] is abominable it shall not be accepted
[3:35] and this word here is pigou which means
[3:37] to stink and let's just use um our
[3:40] experience if you have to use your
[3:42] imagination a little bit I'm sure you'd
[3:43] be able to but if something has been
[3:45] left out for a few days it begins to rot
[3:49] and the Bible is saying if you eat
[3:51] anything on the third day it's a foul
[3:53] thing it's refu it's garbage uh at that
[3:56] point it's begin to rot it's unclean and
[3:58] so it's saying it is foul smelling it
[4:01] should not be accepted you should not
[4:03] eat something uh Beyond uh this this
[4:06] third day or on that third day so this
[4:08] is the original FDA telling you how long
[4:11] you could keep meat out at room
[4:13] temperature and then there are things
[4:16] that we've read about here in
[4:17] Deuteronomy 17 these things that we just
[4:20] mentioned the bulock the Sheep weing his
[4:21] blemish or evil fness for that is and
[4:23] this phrase is an Abomination unto the
[4:26] Lord thy God in other words these are
[4:29] things that don't just smell bad after 3
[4:31] days or things that someone would find
[4:33] defensive but these are things that God
[4:35] finds disgusting these are things that
[4:38] God would say would are loathsome to him
[4:40] or detestable and remember we're we're
[4:43] learning his way and I just want to come
[4:45] up with a list of rules that we can
[4:47] abide by but know his ways and why is it
[4:50] that this is required and why is it that
[4:52] God uh asked us to do these certain
[4:54] things and not just try to come up with
[4:56] an end result or product but to
[4:58] understand why God
[5:00] uh feels this way or even why the Bible
[5:02] requires things of us so there are
[5:04] things and I hope that was pretty simple
[5:07] there's things that can be an
[5:08] Abomination to anybody there's things
[5:10] that can be an Abomination because
[5:11] they're rotting they're unclean it's not
[5:13] healthy to eat it but then there are
[5:14] things that to God he despises them and
[5:18] this is a God that we know in Malachi
[5:20] 3:6 says for I am the Lord I change not
[5:24] amen therefore there are things that God
[5:26] despised then and he despises them yet
[5:29] today there's things that God would find
[5:32] detestable he still hates sin and as he
[5:34] says in Malachi 3 just because I've kind
[5:36] of lingered here and I haven't judged
[5:38] these things doesn't mean my attitude
[5:40] towards them has changed and here we see
[5:43] in Deuteronomy 17 that God hates a
[5:45] blemished sacrifice that blemish there
[5:48] speaks of a spot or a defect it's refers
[5:50] to a physical deformity or some sort of
[5:52] moral stain is how that spot can be used
[5:55] sometimes and if I let me say this just
[5:59] to maybe help Focus you guys in a little
[6:01] bit I'd like to be able to give some
[6:03] context to the God's requirement or his
[6:07] love for Holiness maybe give some
[6:09] perspective to Holiness and understand
[6:11] why would God ask us to dress a certain
[6:12] way why would he God ask us to abstain
[6:14] from certain things and so that's that's
[6:16] what we're looking at in detail tonight
[6:19] God hates a sacrifice that has a blemish
[6:22] as we saw in this word uh on Sunday evil
[6:26] favored if it's evil favored it lacks
[6:29] that beauty of symmetry it is ugliness
[6:32] it's something that has some sort of uh
[6:34] deformity it's the opposite of divine
[6:37] proportion we think we mentioned it this
[6:39] way on Sunday an unpleasant or
[6:41] unattractive condition or appearance I
[6:43] know we probably never say uh do you
[6:45] think I'm evil favored or does this look
[6:47] evil favored on me uh that's not the
[6:50] kind of question we ask but it has
[6:51] something to do with the same sentiment
[6:53] that if something doesn't look right
[6:55] something doesn't isn't visually
[6:57] pleasing it's something that's
[6:58] unpleasant or unattractive Ive so what
[7:00] we're looking at tonight is this evil
[7:02] favored or these things that might have
[7:04] some deformity or blemish and we're
[7:06] calling it
[7:07] ugliness a very unpleasant thing to the
[7:11] sight or something that is
[7:13] unsightly we could even say that it's
[7:15] repulsive in appearance or something
[7:18] that is morally offensive it's
[7:19] ill-shaped that's what we mean by
[7:22] ugliness and I'm drawing from
[7:24] Deuteronomy 17 wherein this principle is
[7:28] that no sacrifice and we'll look at some
[7:30] scriptures here at Exodus 12:5 No
[7:32] sacrifice could have any blemish No
[7:35] sacrifice could have a sickness or or
[7:37] some disease disease it could not be
[7:40] ugly to the sight or have a be foul
[7:43] smelling in Exodus chap 12:5 even before
[7:47] these sacrifices are instituted by law
[7:49] says your lamb shall be without blemish
[7:52] so during the feast the first Feast of
[7:54] the Passover the lamb that they were to
[7:56] choose was to be one without blemish a
[7:58] male of the first year you shall take it
[8:00] out from the sheep or from the goats and
[8:03] God is requiring this lamb to be one
[8:05] without blemish you're going to does it
[8:07] say that oh if you have a a goat with a
[8:09] blemish that's a sin he's saying if you
[8:10] take that which has a blemish and then
[8:13] sacrifice it h you're going to eat it
[8:16] that that's not going to satisfy what
[8:18] I'm wanting to portray here in Leviticus
[8:20] chap
[8:22] 1:3 says if his offering be a burnt
[8:24] sacrifice of the herd let him offer a
[8:27] male without blemish he shall offer it
[8:30] of his own voluntary will at the door of
[8:33] the Tabernacle of the congregation
[8:34] before the Lord I know many of you uh
[8:37] can begin to think about all those
[8:39] different scriptures in the Bible that
[8:40] speak of an offering without blemish and
[8:44] Leviticus chapter 22: 17 to2 this is a
[8:48] rather lengthy reading we have all the
[8:50] scriptures here on the slides for you
[8:52] but I'm just wanting you to recognize
[8:54] how God is reiterating over over again
[8:56] that a sacrifice an offering should be
[8:58] without blemish it should not be sick it
[9:00] should not be diseased it should not be
[9:02] ugly and it's not to say that we should
[9:04] find goats attractive but I think you
[9:06] get the point and the Lord spake unto
[9:08] Moses saying Speak unto Aaron and to his
[9:11] sons and all the children of Israel and
[9:13] say unto them whatsoever he be of the
[9:16] House of Israel or of the strangers in
[9:17] Israel that will offer his oblation for
[9:20] all his vows and for all his Free Will
[9:22] offerings which they will offer unto the
[9:24] Lord for a burnt offering yay shall
[9:27] offer at your own will a
[9:30] without blemish we know that there's
[9:32] just so many different levels of
[9:33] offering so many different categories
[9:36] these free wills these oblations a lot
[9:37] of things but here God's consistent
[9:39] requirements it should be a male without
[9:42] uh blemish of the beaves of the sheep or
[9:44] of the goats but whatsoever hath the
[9:47] blemish that shall you not offer for it
[9:50] shall not be acceptable for you now here
[9:53] God in laying out these requirements
[9:55] says it's not acceptable to eat
[9:57] something that is rotting and this is
[9:59] Maybe God's cautionary law to preserve
[10:01] them to keep them healthy but now within
[10:03] the law of sacrifices he's saying that
[10:05] to offer something without blemish is
[10:08] not acceptable it's not acceptable for
[10:10] you to do that verse 21 and whosoever
[10:13] offer the sacrifice of Peace offerings
[10:15] unto the Lord to accomplish his vow or a
[10:17] free will offering in beaves or sheep it
[10:19] shall be perfect to be accepted there
[10:21] shall be no blemish therein just one
[10:24] category after another it's saying that
[10:26] if you're going to offer a sacrifice it
[10:28] needs to be perfect it needs to be
[10:31] without blemish now it starts to get
[10:33] very detailed blind or broken or maed or
[10:36] having a wind or scurvy or scabbed you
[10:38] shall not offer these unto the Lord nor
[10:40] make an offering by fire of them upon
[10:43] the altar of the Lord this is uh quite
[10:46] the gatekeeping God on in terms of what
[10:49] we can offer and what we can't and and
[10:51] we might find this to be a bit offensive
[10:52] or maybe prejudicial where was the Ada
[10:55] or the I guess it wouldn't be
[10:56] necessarily Americans but animals
[10:59] Disabilities Act and verse 23 either a
[11:02] bulock or a lamb that hath anything
[11:04] super Superfluous or lacking in his
[11:07] parts that mayest thou offer for we free
[11:09] will but for a vow it shall not be
[11:12] accepted you can do it in one category
[11:15] this is your free will but as a for a
[11:17] vow it shall not be accepted it
[11:19] recognizes how God's attitude is on this
[11:21] is your free will if you're going to be
[11:22] given it this is fine but if it's for a
[11:24] vow if you're going to offer something
[11:26] for a vow it shall not be accepted you
[11:28] shall not offer to the Lord that which
[11:30] is bruised or crushed or broken or cut
[11:33] neither shall you make any offering
[11:34] thereof in your land neither from a
[11:37] stranger's hand shall you offer the
[11:38] bread of your god of any of these
[11:40] because their corruption is in them and
[11:42] blemishes be in them they shall not be
[11:45] accepted for you we catch in how God's
[11:48] attitude towards things with the blemish
[11:51] and that when it comes to these
[11:52] sacrifices they ought to be perfect they
[11:55] ought to be something that is not uh in
[11:58] these different categories that he is
[12:00] saying are not
[12:02] acceptable are are you following
[12:04] me in Malachi 1 verses 7 to8 he says you
[12:09] offer polluted bread upon my Altar and
[12:11] you say wherein have we polluted
[12:13] thee in that ye say the table of the
[12:16] Lord is contempt that is something that
[12:19] is disdained or despised it's vile and
[12:21] since it's vile it's worthless he says
[12:23] and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice
[12:26] is it not
[12:28] evil and this is a rhetorical question
[12:31] because it's to be assumed that yes it
[12:34] would be evil to offer a blind sacrifice
[12:36] we've already read in levius 22 that
[12:38] these things could not be offered for
[12:40] certain sacrifices and if you offer the
[12:42] lame and sick is it not
[12:44] evil and the conclusion ought to be
[12:47] you're right we've profaned you we we
[12:49] we've disregarded you we disrespected
[12:51] you we've even disdained you and we
[12:53] haven't shown the proper uh attitude
[12:56] towards these things and therefore they
[12:57] become worthless because because we're
[12:59] not concerned about what's being offered
[13:03] and then to drive the point home he says
[13:05] offer it now unto thy Governor will he
[13:07] be pleased with thee or accept thy
[13:09] person sayith the Lord of host try
[13:12] giving the gift that you're giving me
[13:14] try giving it to a governor try giving
[13:16] it to somebody of some esteem try to
[13:18] show some favor to somebody and say here
[13:21] I I I here's an iPad you can have this
[13:24] iPad and you're like oh thank you you
[13:26] look at it's broke it's crushed it's a
[13:27] first generation can't work won't turn
[13:29] on and they're going like okay thanks
[13:32] for the gift and and he's saying you
[13:35] wouldn't give these things to a govern
[13:37] or some important person try it you do
[13:39] it on my altar all the time you do it in
[13:41] your offering and service to me all the
[13:43] time you don't you're not giving your
[13:44] best you're not giving what's required
[13:46] you're giving things that are broken and
[13:47] solid and things that aren't clean and
[13:49] try giving that just to a human being of
[13:52] someone of importance or someone that
[13:54] you're trying to uh show favor to he
[13:56] says they won't accept it either
[13:59] so there's many of these verses that we
[14:02] could use to show God's attitude towards
[14:06] or God's requirement of an unblemished
[14:09] sacrifice a a sacrifice that is not ugly
[14:12] or evil
[14:13] favored and all of these Old Testament
[14:16] sacrifices typed I say all of them
[14:18] because in some way they're all uh can
[14:21] be funneled and towards this one thing
[14:23] they typed or foreshadowed the coming of
[14:25] an unblemished Immaculate Lamb of God
[14:28] Amen in Hebrews chapter 9: 13 and 14 for
[14:31] if the blood of bulls and goats and the
[14:33] ashes of a hepher sprinkling the unclean
[14:36] Sanctified to the purifying of Flesh
[14:39] which we know in these offerings they
[14:40] would have been of a
[14:43] unblemished uh uh bulock or goat or bull
[14:47] and it says if they can sprinkle the
[14:49] unclean and sanctify the pur of the
[14:53] flesh if these things could happen under
[14:54] the law verse 14 how much more shall the
[14:57] blood of Christ to through the eternal
[14:59] spirit offered himself without spot to
[15:02] God Purge your conscience from dead
[15:04] Works to serve the Living
[15:07] God notice how
[15:09] these these offerings that were used in
[15:13] the Old Testament point to the blood of
[15:15] Christ and I apologize that I don't have
[15:18] this scripture there I thought I had it
[15:19] there who through the eternal spirit
[15:21] offered himself without
[15:23] spot what what is that without spot it's
[15:25] without blemish it's without these
[15:27] things that we've already read about in
[15:29] Leviticus and and Malachi and so many
[15:31] different places that we could read from
[15:33] the offerings in the Old Testament that
[15:35] to accomplish these ceremonial things
[15:38] and for the service in the Tabernacle
[15:40] now Jesus Christ fulfills everything
[15:43] that they foreshadowed and he was a
[15:46] sacrifice without spot he said this
[15:49] sacrifice without spot how much more can
[15:51] it Purge your conscience from dead Works
[15:54] to serve the Living God in 1 Peter 1: 18
[15:58] to 21 for as much as you know that you
[16:01] were not redeemed with corruptible
[16:03] things as silver and gold from your vain
[16:05] conversation received by tradition from
[16:08] your fathers that's an accurate way to
[16:10] describe things it says but with the
[16:12] precious blood of Christ you have been
[16:14] redeemed not with a corruptible blood or
[16:16] corruptible nature or with the things
[16:18] that you could get from your parents
[16:20] you've been redeemed with the precious
[16:22] unique and rare blood of Christ as of a
[16:25] lamb without blemish and without spot a
[16:28] lamb that was not evil favored though
[16:30] there was no Beauty in him that a
[16:31] natural man would desire him and we hid
[16:33] our faces as it were from him there is
[16:35] this Paradox that in a natural sense we
[16:37] would recoil but in a sense of a
[16:40] sacrifice God looks upon it says this is
[16:42] a lamb without blemish and without spot
[16:44] this blood which was shed is the
[16:46] precious blood of Christ who verily was
[16:49] for ordained before the foundation of
[16:50] the world but was manifest in these last
[16:52] times for you who by him do believe in
[16:55] God who by him do believe in God that
[16:58] raised him up from the dead and gave him
[17:00] glory that your Faith and Hope might be
[17:03] in God what is the Bible telling us
[17:06] we're just using a few verses to make
[17:07] this point in the Old Testament God
[17:10] required a perfect sacrifice in the New
[17:12] Testament we see that Christ was the
[17:15] perfect sacrifice in 2 Corinthians 5:21
[17:18] for he hath made him to be sin for us he
[17:22] made him to be sin Force this is what
[17:24] happened in that conference when there
[17:26] was hands placed upon the dying lamb
[17:28] there was this transfer of sin there was
[17:31] the scapegoat that was uh there was one
[17:33] that was killed and one that was let
[17:34] loose and it's all symbolizing that one
[17:36] is bearing the penalty one is being made
[17:39] sin uh so that we can have a free
[17:41] conscience and a purged conscience now
[17:43] Christ was made sin for us and the
[17:46] Bible's very clear who knew no
[17:49] sin that we might be made not sin but
[17:52] the righteousness of God in
[17:55] him Christ was the perfect sacrifice
[17:58] without spot without blemish no evil
[18:01] favored who knew no sin sinless spotless
[18:05] Lamb of God you staying with me so far
[18:10] good we'll be making good time in
[18:12] Leviticus 21: 16 to 24 now I really want
[18:16] you to focus intently because I want to
[18:18] use this to speak of Jesus Christ and I
[18:22] believe this is quite remarkable and the
[18:24] Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto
[18:26] Aaron saying whosoever he be of thy seed
[18:29] in their Generations that hath any
[18:31] blemish let him not approach to offer
[18:34] the bread of his God these are the sons
[18:37] of Aaron these that would be in that
[18:39] priesthood not just Levites but those
[18:41] that would offer bread those that would
[18:43] offer sacrifices those that would have a
[18:45] very specific uh uh function within the
[18:50] the inner the inner court and even the
[18:53] high priest himself who would enter in
[18:55] to the holy of holies now listen it says
[18:58] for whatsoever ever man he be that hath
[19:00] a blemish he sh shall not approach a
[19:04] blind man or lame or he that hath a flat
[19:07] nose I think I'm okay or anything
[19:11] Superfluous or a man that is broken
[19:13] footed or broken handed or a crookback
[19:17] or a dwarf or that hath a blemish in his
[19:20] eye or be scurvy or scabbed or hath his
[19:22] Stones broken okay I want you to think
[19:26] about just how specific God is getting
[19:28] about the one who can offer these
[19:30] sacrifices nice not talking about
[19:32] someone who could be even a priest or
[19:35] levite or dis certain but it's those
[19:37] that would be forming be performing
[19:39] these special functions they couldn't be
[19:40] a dwarf they couldn't have a blemish in
[19:42] their eye or have scurby or scab some of
[19:45] the same requirements they had of the
[19:46] sacrifice now the one that's making the
[19:48] offering has to have the same
[19:51] requirements couldn't be broken footed
[19:53] or broken handed couldn't be blind
[19:55] couldn't be lame couldn't have a flat
[19:56] nose
[19:58] verse 21 no man that hath the blemish of
[20:01] the seed of Aaron the priest the priest
[20:04] shall come nigh to offer the offerings
[20:06] of the Lord made by fire so it's
[20:10] specific he hath a blemish he shall not
[20:12] come nigh to the offering of bread of
[20:15] his
[20:17] God are are you focusing with me because
[20:20] I don't want you just to kind of hear a
[20:22] little bit of it leave and then have the
[20:23] wrong idea verse 22 he shall eat the
[20:26] bread of his God both of the most most
[20:28] holy and of and and of and of the half o
[20:33] blemish and of the most of the most holy
[20:35] and of the Holy only he shall not go UN
[20:39] in unto the veil nor come nigh unto the
[20:41] altar because he hath the blemish God's
[20:43] making a distinction God is saying I'm
[20:46] not trying to deprive you of every right
[20:48] that you might have just how that there
[20:49] were some sacrifices that could be at a
[20:51] certain category that one could give of
[20:53] their own free will that there's no
[20:55] prohibition that you couldn't offer that
[20:57] but if I'm going to accept accepted for
[20:59] certain things and very specific
[21:01] purposes it must be perfect and here
[21:03] he's saying that you can eat the bread
[21:05] of your God from even the most holy or
[21:08] the holy you're not prohibited from
[21:10] certain things but if you're going to
[21:12] come behind the veil if you're going to
[21:14] come n into the altar you cannot do it
[21:16] if you have a blemish because if they
[21:18] did he says he profane that he profane
[21:21] not my sanctuaries that they not be
[21:24] defiled for I the Lord do sanctify them
[21:27] and Moses told unto Aaron and to his
[21:29] sons and unto all the children of
[21:32] Israel now these requirements may seem
[21:34] to be pretty severe and that they would
[21:36] be limiting and someone who had a a
[21:38] broken foot or flat nose or was a dwarf
[21:41] and these different things they would
[21:42] say no sorry you can't perform these
[21:44] certain functions but what was it for
[21:47] was God just uh prejudicial was God just
[21:49] a tyrant was he unconcerned or unfeeling
[21:53] uh it wasn't for any of those reasons
[21:55] but it was because they were
[21:56] foreshadowing the perfect one that would
[21:58] come
[21:59] and that would perform the ultimate
[22:00] function of entering in behind the veil
[22:03] as a bloody lamb before the presence of
[22:05] God as Hebrews chapter 9: 11 uh to 12
[22:10] says but Christ being come a high priest
[22:12] of good things to come if he was going
[22:14] to be a high priest of good things to
[22:16] come there are certain requirements that
[22:18] he was going to have to have by a
[22:20] greater and more perfect Tabernacle not
[22:22] made with hands that is to St say not of
[22:24] this building neither by the blood of
[22:26] goats and calves those a beautiful
[22:28] building that Temple was though these
[22:30] goats and calves were perfect and
[22:32] without blemish but by his own blood he
[22:34] entered in once into the holy Place
[22:36] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[22:38] us amen here is one who was not broken
[22:42] one who is not uh uh scarred or scabbed
[22:46] as a person and morally stained he was
[22:48] one who knew no sin he was Jesus Christ
[22:51] was the perfect sacrifice that all these
[22:54] requirements of God were pointing to
[22:59] now I hope you can recognize then that
[23:01] the Old Testament as God gave his
[23:03] requirements in the law and he said that
[23:05] certain things would not be accepted he
[23:07] was doing this showing that there was
[23:08] going to come one who would be accepted
[23:12] and that by that sacrifice we would
[23:14] become accepted so as the Old Testament
[23:17] foreshadowed Christ now the New
[23:19] Testament previews the coming of a
[23:21] Perfect Bride brother brandom uses the
[23:23] phrase another Masterpiece in the
[23:26] making Ephesians chapter 1 veres 3 4 5
[23:31] and 6 blessed be the God and father of
[23:33] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[23:35] us with all spiritual blessings in
[23:36] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[23:40] he hath chosen Us in him before the
[23:42] foundation of the world that we should
[23:45] be holy and Without Blame before him now
[23:50] it's starting to get a little personal
[23:52] we could all laugh when he said up the
[23:54] short guy can't go in behind the veil oh
[23:56] it's funny that the guy with the flat
[23:57] nose can't do this is oh it's sad that
[24:00] the goat that limps can't be a sacrifice
[24:02] and we can look back at the Old
[24:03] Testament just think those are just kind
[24:05] of all weird rules and then we say oh
[24:06] well the reason why is because when God
[24:09] made these requirements he was saying
[24:11] that one day Jesus Christ would be the
[24:13] immaculate lamb who would be without
[24:15] blemish without spot would not be evil
[24:17] favored and he would be the perfect
[24:19] sacrifice who knew no sin whose blood
[24:21] being shed and then offering himself up
[24:24] before the Throne of God the high priest
[24:26] himself entering in behind the veil
[24:28] would atone all of our sins and we sense
[24:32] that oh we're we're forgiven our sins
[24:34] are forgiven and now then when read it
[24:36] it says that he did this that we might
[24:38] be holy and without blemish Without
[24:41] Blame before him in love having
[24:44] predestinate us under the adoption of
[24:46] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[24:48] according to the good pleasure of his
[24:49] will to the praise of the glory of his
[24:52] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[24:55] in the Beloved now just as there were
[24:58] sacrifices in the Old Testament that not
[25:00] were not accepted and things that were
[25:03] not acceptable and Jesus Christ was the
[25:06] sacrifice that God accepted now we by
[25:09] that shedding of that perfect blood that
[25:11] innocent lamb we are to be made holy and
[25:14] Without Blame and we are made accepted
[25:17] in
[25:18] him so now we have this uh Union with
[25:22] Christ in this uh in this image of this
[25:26] perfectness in Ephesians chapter 5: 25-
[25:29] 27 it says husbands love your wives even
[25:32] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[25:35] himself for it what was the purpose of
[25:38] this sacrifice that he might sanctify
[25:40] and cleanse it with the washing of Water
[25:43] by the word recall how the Bible there
[25:46] would be things that blood was shed and
[25:47] there'd be a sprinkling and it would be
[25:50] an animal it would be something that
[25:52] couldn't really know sin or couldn't
[25:53] necessarily sin itself but there would
[25:55] be this innocent substitution of a
[25:57] perfect sacrifice and that blood would
[26:00] be
[26:00] sprinkled and the unclean these vessels
[26:03] and things would be purged and made
[26:05] clean and that by their blood things
[26:08] could be P purified and Sanctified and
[26:10] put into
[26:11] use and even temporarily purified the
[26:14] flesh ceremonially before God through
[26:16] these sacrifices now the shedding of
[26:18] Christ's blood is the act of sanctifying
[26:21] and cleansing he gave himself that he
[26:24] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[26:25] washing of Water by the word that he
[26:27] might presented to himself a glorious
[26:30] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[26:34] such thing but that it should be holy
[26:36] and without
[26:38] blemish now there's this could begin to
[26:41] raise questions like well then does this
[26:43] mean that uh if you have some sort of
[26:47] physical deformity you can't be saved
[26:48] he's that's not what he's talking about
[26:50] because we're we're not necessarily
[26:52] trying to create a visual image as much
[26:54] as we are trying to understand God's
[26:56] way and this is the word work that God
[26:58] has accomplished in us through Jesus
[27:00] Christ and he's washing us with the
[27:02] water of the word to present us a
[27:04] glorious church not having spot or
[27:07] wrinkle or any such thing but that we
[27:08] should be holy and without spot holy
[27:12] without blemish or
[27:14] deformity in Colossians chap 1: 18 to 23
[27:18] we're making great time tonight and he
[27:20] is the head of the body of the church
[27:22] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[27:23] the dead that in all things he might
[27:25] have the preeminence for it pleased the
[27:29] father that in him should all fullness
[27:31] dwell and having made peace through the
[27:34] blood of his cross by him to reconcile
[27:37] all things unto himself by him I say
[27:40] whether they be things in Earth or
[27:42] things in heaven and you that were
[27:44] sometime alienated in enemies in your
[27:47] mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he
[27:51] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[27:54] through
[27:56] death we see that symmetry between the
[27:58] Old Testament sacrifices in
[28:00] Christ now we have to recognize that
[28:03] just as those sacrifices then had a
[28:06] Target and had something it was
[28:08] purifying something it was atoning so it
[28:11] had this foreshadowing of Christ but
[28:13] then you're somehow reflected in that
[28:14] too you're somehow represented in these
[28:17] forms and these figures in the Old
[28:18] Testament and he's saying that through
[28:20] the body of his flesh through death he
[28:21] might present you holy and unblamable
[28:24] and unreprovable in his sight no notice
[28:28] the language that's being used about you
[28:30] holy unblamable
[28:33] unreprovable and if you continue in the
[28:35] faith grounded and settled and be not
[28:37] moved away from the hope of the Gospel
[28:39] which ye have heard and which was
[28:40] preached to every creature which is
[28:41] under Heaven whereof I Paul IM made a
[28:46] minister now if we could qualify things
[28:50] this way just very plainly here it's
[28:53] your soul that is
[28:54] redeemed the blood of God having covered
[28:56] your soul the soul that sent it will die
[28:58] the soul now is regenerated it's made
[29:00] new it has been sealed by the Holy Ghost
[29:03] the soul Sanctified and made whole
[29:06] perfect and holy and when I say holy
[29:08] complete by the blood of God through
[29:11] that regeneration by the baptism of the
[29:13] Holy Ghost the soul has been rendered
[29:15] complete and Paul then says that he
[29:18] wants to present you holy and unblamable
[29:19] and unprovable and it says if you
[29:22] continue in the faith grounded and
[29:23] settled and be not moved away from the
[29:25] hope of the Gospel so there is some hope
[29:27] of the gospel there is something that is
[29:30] even forward-looking to those who have
[29:32] heard the gospel and believed it 1
[29:34] Corinthians chapter 6:1 it says and such
[29:37] were some of you go read chapter 6 to
[29:39] get some more context of all the evil
[29:41] things that were done just by our minds
[29:44] by we were enemies in our minds and
[29:46] alienated from God by these Wicked works
[29:48] that we did by our first nature these
[29:51] things that we received through nature
[29:53] and tradition from our fathers now we
[29:56] are purged from those things and we we
[29:58] were some of those things but you are
[30:00] washed but you are Sanctified but you
[30:03] are justified in the name of the Lord
[30:04] Jesus and by the spirit of our God we
[30:08] are now presented and here we are
[30:10] represented as clean and pure and
[30:12] prepared and made ready are you thinking
[30:15] about this that there's been something
[30:17] prepared there's been something that is
[30:19] washed Sanctified and
[30:21] Justified so that we can be we can have
[30:23] this grounding and this settling unmoved
[30:26] from perfecting holiness amen that God
[30:29] has accomplished these things think of
[30:31] it this way when God has redeemed your
[30:33] soul and he's fitted you as a vessel of
[30:35] Honor that means he's wanting to do
[30:37] something with you that now that he has
[30:40] redeemed you as he has he saved you as
[30:42] he has then there is this mind that at
[30:45] one time did Wicked works now our minds
[30:47] are to be yielded to him to do righteous
[30:51] works so Colossians 3: 4-1 say it this
[30:55] way
[30:58] I trust you're able just to kind of
[30:59] follow me follow me through this the
[31:01] only one who doesn't really need to uh
[31:04] pick up on this is Sister opal right now
[31:06] because she's oh never mind she was
[31:08] listening she just was praying for me
[31:10] thank you
[31:11] sister and cla's CH you know you hate to
[31:14] wake up the little ones it's the adults
[31:15] I'd like to wake up sometimes Colossians
[31:18] 3: 4 to 11 when Christ to his our life
[31:21] shall appear then shall you also appear
[31:23] with him in glory okay Born Again sealed
[31:27] we're we're going to see them now it
[31:29] says mortify Therefore your members
[31:31] which are upon the Earth and some maybe
[31:34] uh people take this to mean kill the
[31:36] members in your church or but there's
[31:38] this subjugating the your members as an
[31:41] individual as a human mortify Therefore
[31:42] your members which are upon the Earth
[31:44] fornication uncleanness inord affection
[31:47] evil concupisent and covetousness which
[31:49] is idolatry these things ought not to be
[31:52] named in our lives for which thing sake
[31:54] the wrath of God cometh on the children
[31:56] of disobedience
[31:58] why would God judge these things he
[32:00] hates them they're still detestable to
[32:03] him there's no way that we can bring the
[32:05] gospel to a place of Grace and
[32:07] Revelation and bring us in the age where
[32:09] well listen I mean everybody's going to
[32:11] fornicate and everybody's going to lust
[32:12] and these things are going to happen you
[32:14] just got to wear what everybody gives
[32:16] and you can't do this and you can't do
[32:17] that and the government made me do it
[32:19] all sorts of nonsense he's said no these
[32:21] things I've always hated doesn't matter
[32:23] if they legalize it doesn't mean if the
[32:25] world accepts it doesn't matter if all
[32:26] the churches in the world to say hey
[32:28] let's not be so heavy-handed let's just
[32:31] gather people together he gets us right
[32:34] however we are he gets us let's just all
[32:36] say we're second he's first and we love
[32:39] Jesus and anything goes no God still
[32:41] hates sin fornication uncleanness this
[32:45] inordinate affection jealousy all these
[32:47] things that are essentially summed up as
[32:49] idolatry this idolatry God hates and the
[32:53] wrath of God comes upon children
[32:54] Disobedience because they perform these
[32:56] works and he says of these children of
[32:59] disobedience in the which ye also walked
[33:01] sometime when you lived in them before
[33:04] you were born again you were by Nature
[33:07] the children of Wrath and you were
[33:08] disobedient children and you had your
[33:10] course with them and you did these very
[33:12] same things he says but now ye also put
[33:14] off all these now we could say by the
[33:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost well
[33:18] fornication uncleanness inor affection
[33:20] these things are gone but he says you
[33:22] now need to continue to put off all
[33:24] these anger wrath malice blasphemy
[33:28] filthy communication out of your mouth
[33:30] lie not one to
[33:32] another oh could we just go back to
[33:34] verse
[33:35] five please no put these things off too
[33:39] anger
[33:41] wrath I didn't say math
[33:44] wrath malice blasphemy filthy
[33:47] communication out of your
[33:49] mouth lie not one to
[33:53] another seeing that ye have put off the
[33:56] old man with his deeds
[33:58] and have put on the new man which is
[34:01] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[34:03] him that created
[34:05] him as he is Holy so ought to we be holy
[34:09] this is in the image of the Creator the
[34:11] author the painter the artist we've put
[34:14] off the old man who was subject to all
[34:17] those things now that we've put on the
[34:18] new man put all these things out of your
[34:20] mouth put all these things out of your
[34:22] spirit get them away from you where
[34:23] there is neither Greek nor Jew
[34:25] circumcision or un uh cir circumcision
[34:28] Barbarian cian Bond nor free but Christ
[34:31] is all and in
[34:33] all we can't somehow exempt ourselves
[34:36] from God's requirement of Holiness
[34:38] because we're of a different
[34:39] culture now there is some variance in
[34:42] terms of culture and things that are
[34:43] culturally accepted and things that
[34:45] people could do in one nation that maybe
[34:47] we're not except expected to do in this
[34:49] nation but I promise you that there's no
[34:51] exemption from the things that God hates
[34:54] just because you're of a different n
[34:56] culture just because you're of a
[34:57] different ethnicity God may look at it
[35:00] and and see things one way see things a
[35:03] away for all of us and there's things
[35:04] that all of us whether you be Bond or
[35:06] free or Jew or Greek or circumcised or
[35:09] uncircumcised God hates
[35:13] sin if there was in certain cultures
[35:16] that some things were accepted some
[35:18] things were allowed well this is just
[35:19] what we do we get higher we get drunk we
[35:21] fornicate these things are socially
[35:24] acceptable they're not considered sin
[35:25] these things are we're allowed to do the
[35:27] government gives us the blessing we have
[35:28] these certain exemptions you can't
[35:30] legislate on a church level or even on a
[35:34] government level or even on a church
[35:35] level a a period wherein you can just do
[35:37] whatever you want for 30
[35:42] days it's is it called lent when they're
[35:44] able to do that I can't remember which
[35:45] one it is like there's 30 days where you
[35:47] don't do anything there's days when you
[35:48] do things and I I can't get
[35:51] it
[35:54] um but he's saying these things no
[35:57] matter what you are you got to put away
[35:59] things I
[36:01] hate in Jude verses 17 to2 but beloved
[36:04] remember ye The Words which were spoken
[36:06] before the Apostles of our Lord Jesus
[36:08] Christ how that they told you there
[36:11] should be mockers in the last time who
[36:13] should walk after their own ungodly lust
[36:16] now why would they be mockers they're
[36:18] not mockers in the sense that they say
[36:20] well we don't even believe in a God so
[36:21] we can do whatever they want but they're
[36:23] mocking because they will suggest that
[36:25] they have true Liberty and that they
[36:27] truly know the Lord and in knowing him
[36:29] they're able to be free to explore and
[36:32] to express themselves whereas they mock
[36:34] you that you are somehow in some sort of
[36:36] bondage these be they who separate
[36:39] themselves sensual having not the spirit
[36:42] though they may claim to have it you
[36:44] know by their Works they clearly do not
[36:46] because they will do the things that God
[36:48] hates but ye beloved building up
[36:50] yourselves on your Most Holy Faith
[36:52] praying in the Holy Ghost so there's a
[36:54] building up you have a Holy Faith your
[36:57] soul is redeemed it is it is perfect
[37:00] before God but now you have to build
[37:01] yourself up in Holy Faith praying and
[37:03] Hol keep yourselves in the love of God
[37:06] looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[37:08] Christ unto eternal life now these next
[37:12] two verses are a mouthful but I just
[37:14] want you to kind of catch the flavor of
[37:15] this and some have compassion making a
[37:18] difference and others save with fear so
[37:22] there's you can make a difference by
[37:24] exhibiting compassion you can have a
[37:25] difference in people's lives as your
[37:27] building up this Most Holy Faith and you
[37:29] see people struggling you see somebody
[37:30] lame uh you make straight the paths of
[37:33] your feet so that that lame person can
[37:34] see a right way and those right will
[37:36] tracks he he can do it through
[37:38] compassion says now that there's others
[37:41] saved with fear pulling them out of the
[37:43] fire hating even the Garment spotted by
[37:47] the
[37:48] flesh that we ought to have the same
[37:51] attitude towards something that God has
[37:53] and that if he hates something we should
[37:55] hate it that there should be this
[37:57] correct way of saving someone pulling
[37:59] them out of the fire recognize that God
[38:01] hates and we would therefore hate even
[38:03] the Garment spotted by the
[38:06] flesh now unto him that is able now the
[38:09] catch this is the the best part able to
[38:11] keep you from falling and to present you
[38:14] fallest before the presence of his glory
[38:16] with exceeding Joy to the only wise God
[38:18] our savior be glory and Majesty dominion
[38:20] and power both now and forever amen
[38:24] there is one who is able to keep you
[38:26] from falling there is one who is able to
[38:29] see that you continue in these things to
[38:32] put off anger and wrath and Malice and
[38:35] blasphemy and filthy communication to
[38:37] see that you continue in the faith
[38:38] grounded and settled and not be moved
[38:40] away from the hope of the
[38:44] Gospel that we are to have a
[38:47] disposition to where where in our lives
[38:49] can make a difference and we can save
[38:52] some from the fire because we have the
[38:54] same attitude
[38:56] towards sin
[38:58] ugliness evil
[39:00] favored now this to me is the Clincher
[39:03] we've just arrived at
[39:04] 804 and we just have a few more verses
[39:07] to read but they should go rather
[39:09] quickly in Romans 12: 1-2 now this is
[39:14] the the punchline as it were God's
[39:17] attitude towards sacrifices in the Old
[39:19] Testament show that he would not accept
[39:22] an imperfect blemish sacrifice Jesus
[39:24] Christ came paid the price himself as
[39:26] that perfect sacrifice that we too might
[39:30] be accepted and that our lives too would
[39:32] be without spot and
[39:34] blemish now in the Old Testament there
[39:36] was requirements and service and those
[39:38] that would offer sacrifice and things
[39:39] that would be rendered and done unto God
[39:42] and Christ fulfilled those things
[39:44] perfectly even as the high priest even
[39:47] as the lamb and now it says of us I
[39:50] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[39:51] mercies of God that ye present your
[39:54] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[39:57] acceptable unto God which is your
[39:59] reasonable
[40:00] service this is what you ought to do
[40:04] it's not necessarily a free will
[40:05] offering in that well come as you are
[40:07] remain as you are do whatever you want
[40:09] but now he's saying that you by the
[40:11] mercies of God ought to present your
[40:13] bodies as a Living Sacrifice and he
[40:17] modifies this sacrifice is Holy and
[40:20] acceptable unto God God in the Old
[40:22] Testament would not accept this broken I
[40:25] I I know they kind of getting in this
[40:27] area were well every song we listen to
[40:29] now on K Love or Whatever It Is uh
[40:32] whatever one that's doing which one is
[40:33] it that's always doing a fundraising you
[40:35] can never you never hear any songs but
[40:37] all of them and so there's it's not it's
[40:42] not this this kind of worldly idea of
[40:44] you know every I think a lot of the
[40:45] songs we hear these days is it's 12:00
[40:47] at night and I'm broken and I'm sad and
[40:49] I had a bad day Jesus be my friend right
[40:54] the nice little banjo track going behind
[40:56] it no there is there is a certain thing
[40:59] that God expects from us to where we're
[41:00] not continuing to do the things he hates
[41:04] the Bible tells us God loves a broken
[41:05] and contrite spirit he will not despise
[41:08] that well why does the bible say that to
[41:10] remind us that there's a certain
[41:11] Brokenness that we can't put in the
[41:13] category of things that God hates but
[41:16] there's a Brokenness that he loves
[41:17] because that Brokenness will tend to
[41:20] wholeness and
[41:22] perfectness and so if we just disregards
[41:25] what he requires here then how we going
[41:27] to get healed over here because we make
[41:30] excuses for our the lack of Holiness and
[41:32] we make excuses for the lack of
[41:34] sanctification it's the reason why we
[41:36] can never receive the healing we need in
[41:38] our Spirits because we're too busy
[41:40] making excuses it's okay to be broken
[41:42] here and wanting God to heal us here we
[41:44] say maybe it's okay to be broken here
[41:46] but not over
[41:48] here I apologize to streamer 123 for
[41:54] screaming we're to present our bodies a
[41:56] living sacrifice holy and
[41:59] acceptable in other words God is looking
[42:01] for a perfect sacrifice acceptable
[42:04] without blemish without spot and notice
[42:06] how beautifully he begins to amplify
[42:08] this and be not conformed to this world
[42:11] don't be shaped in the image of the
[42:13] world don't don't allow yourself to be
[42:16] forced into some pattern don't offer to
[42:18] me an oblation a a a sacrifice anything
[42:23] that you would offer to me don't offer
[42:25] the world to me
[42:27] don't offer to me something that is in
[42:29] the pattern and the habit of the world
[42:31] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[42:33] your mind that ye may prove as a Living
[42:35] Sacrifice prove that which is uh prove
[42:38] what is that good and acceptable and
[42:41] perfect will of
[42:43] God evil favored as we defined it on
[42:46] Sunday was some outward manif
[42:49] manifestation that was
[42:51] asymmetrical that blemished and marred
[42:53] the image of God the the God is a
[42:55] perfect God so something that doesn't
[42:57] look perfect something that would be
[42:58] unclean or foul or stenchy it would be
[43:01] something is that a word stenchy
[43:02] something that would not be the word of
[43:04] the year in
[43:06] 20126 I don't know if you all work on it
[43:09] it might happen but something that
[43:11] smells something that would stink it
[43:13] couldn't be that's evil favored God does
[43:16] not like that God looks down upon that
[43:18] so what he's saying here is that our
[43:19] lives should be a Living Sacrifice holy
[43:21] and acceptable in other words our
[43:23] outward expression the way that we live
[43:25] our lives should be free from any defect
[43:28] that would Mar the image of God in flesh
[43:32] we're not conformed to this world but
[43:34] we're transformed by the renewing of our
[43:36] minds that our lives might prove that we
[43:39] are a holy acceptable sacrifice unto God
[43:43] in the Bible Old Testament a sacrifice
[43:46] was to be clean without Abomination and
[43:49] likewise the same our lives in our lives
[43:51] we must strive to be
[43:54] so 1 Corinthians 15:49 is we have borne
[43:57] the image of the Earthly we shall also
[44:00] bear the image of the
[44:04] Heavenly I don't believe we should wait
[44:06] until the meeting in the air to begin to
[44:08] put that
[44:09] on what are we glorifying god with what
[44:12] are we glorifying God what are we
[44:14] glorifying here on Earth are we
[44:17] glorifying God the
[44:19] world in First Peter chap 2:5 ye also as
[44:23] Lively stones are built up a spiritual
[44:25] house and holy priesthood to
[44:27] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[44:30] to God by Jesus Christ recall just how
[44:34] detailed the word of God was for those
[44:36] who would offer literal
[44:39] sacrifice and there is a spiritual
[44:41] application that those of us who are to
[44:43] be offering up spiritual sacrifices that
[44:45] would be acceptable to God our sacrifice
[44:48] then ought to be without spot without
[44:50] blemish and therefore we who are doing
[44:52] the offerings we ought to ourselves be
[44:55] striving for that same lack of
[45:00] spot I believe Romans 6: 12 to 14 puts
[45:03] it in a very beautiful way so that it's
[45:05] not so much us striving as much as it is
[45:08] US yielding let not sin therefore reign
[45:10] in your mortal body that you should obey
[45:12] it in the lust thereof neither yield ye
[45:15] your members as instruments of
[45:17] unrighteousness Unto sin but yield
[45:19] yourselves unto God as those that are
[45:22] alive from the dead and your members as
[45:25] instruments of righteous
[45:27] unto God you should say to yourself Lord
[45:30] I want to be your
[45:32] instrument I I want you to use me I I
[45:34] want you to live through me for sin
[45:36] shall not have dominion over you for you
[45:38] are not under the law but under grace
[45:42] what Grace has done in this hour is it's
[45:43] appeared teaching that we can live
[45:45] soberly and righteously and godly in the
[45:48] now in this present world now before I
[45:52] I'm going to say this can a person in
[45:54] this day and age live holy can a person
[45:57] in this day right now in 2025 can they
[46:00] live above the world can they keep their
[46:03] lives unspotted yes they can now before
[46:07] we try to get in our ideas what that
[46:09] means like oh that means I can't never
[46:11] do this I can't never do that instead of
[46:13] trying to think about what it would be
[46:15] accept the fact that there's a God who's
[46:17] made the promise that if we could just
[46:19] yield our members to him as instruments
[46:22] of righteousness then we could say I I
[46:24] don't I don't I know that Within myself
[46:27] I can never do it I and I'm not
[46:29] expecting myself to live perfectly every
[46:31] day and I'm not expected to live uh
[46:33] where I never have a bad thought and I
[46:34] never make a mistake and I never get
[46:35] jealous and I never lust I'm not trying
[46:37] to present to you some unreasonable
[46:39] standard but I'm trying to present to
[46:41] you that with man this is impossible but
[46:44] With God all things are possible and
[46:46] it's according to his desire and his
[46:48] nature and his way that we could yield
[46:50] ourselves to him and he can continue to
[46:53] work through us in a way that we can
[46:55] become 21st
[46:58] Christ that we could live in the power
[47:00] of Holiness and in the beauty of
[47:05] Holiness in 1 Thessalonians 5: 22-
[47:12] 24 abstain from all appearance of
[47:18] evil abstain even could be restrained or
[47:21] hold back
[47:23] yourself from all appearance of evil
[47:28] I think there's a lot of meaning to this
[47:31] evil here could mean diseased or blind
[47:33] it means wickedness hold yourself from
[47:36] appearing
[47:38] Wicked This is what we ought to do not
[47:41] only is there to be a restraining from
[47:43] Evil when it appears where we would turn
[47:46] our heads Son of God turn your heads
[47:48] I'll set no Wicked thing before me and
[47:50] there's a clear uh pattern in the
[47:52] scripture to where this scripture could
[47:54] say abstain from hold yourself back from
[47:56] look looking at viewing or digesting
[47:58] through sight and through imagination
[48:01] things that are wicked and evil but then
[48:02] it also is telling us as Believers that
[48:05] we ourselves should not appear Wicked we
[48:09] should not appear unclean we should not
[48:12] appear
[48:13] Unholy and before we try to create some
[48:16] Pious idea as a Pharisee of what that
[48:19] looks like we just need to First accept
[48:21] the principle that there is that
[48:24] requirement of Holiness in this hour
[48:28] musicians you could come to your
[48:29] instruments in 1 Thessalonians 3:13 to
[48:31] the end he may establish your hearts
[48:34] unblamable in Holiness before God even
[48:36] our father at the coming of our Lord
[48:38] Jesus Christ with all his
[48:40] Saints abstain from all appearance of
[48:43] evil and notice he says and the Very God
[48:46] of Peace sanctify you holy he's already
[48:49] said in ver chapter three establish your
[48:50] hearts unblamable and Holiness he says
[48:52] in chapter four that the god that ha
[48:54] called us un unclean God hath not called
[48:56] us to uncleanness but unto Holiness so
[49:00] here he is in verse verse 23 of 1
[49:02] Thessalonians 5 and the Very God of
[49:05] Peace sanctify you holy brother John if
[49:06] you could give that scripture and I pray
[49:08] God your Holy Spirit and soul and body
[49:10] be preserved blameless and the coming of
[49:13] our Lord Jesus Christ Faithful Is He
[49:15] that calleth you who also will do
[49:20] it why does he not do it we're not
[49:23] letting him we've reasoned ourselves out
[49:26] of it Lord willing I want to preach a
[49:27] sermon on how sin is
[49:29] unbelief so that we can begin to look at
[49:32] just how of important principle that is
[49:34] that sin is unbelief why is it that we
[49:36] find ourselves not growing in these
[49:39] things is because we're not letting him
[49:41] do it and we can reason ourselves out of
[49:44] it by this what happened and we somehow
[49:46] find ourselves re rationalizing with it
[49:48] enough to it's like God won't do
[49:51] it again let me come back to the point I
[49:53] was making earlier there's things that
[49:55] we Pine and beg and ask God and we pour
[49:57] ourselves out uh to God for and we ask
[50:00] him to do it because we want to be
[50:02] healed or we want things to be mended we
[50:04] want things to get right and we want
[50:05] things to be all perfect in this area
[50:08] God come and heal this part of my life
[50:10] but there's another part over here that
[50:12] is clearly broken and we're not asking
[50:14] God to mess with
[50:16] this why because maybe we don't think
[50:18] this needs to be perfect God saying no I
[50:22] think he got it all backwards I love you
[50:24] this way I can use you this way way I
[50:27] knew you'd be this
[50:30] way and and maybe in some ways God wants
[50:32] us to remain this
[50:34] way Paul sought the Lord three times
[50:37] Lord Heal Me of this Brokenness he said
[50:38] no my grace is sufficient I'll use
[50:41] it and the Very things that we're asking
[50:44] God to heal and to make right and make
[50:45] whole and make perfect that we think is
[50:47] ugly he's saying you know what in that
[50:49] weakness my strength is made
[50:51] perfect and we don't want God to touch
[50:54] the ugliness over here
[50:57] the lack of sanctification the
[50:59] ungodliness the uh the arrogance The
[51:02] Pride whatever it might be the things
[51:04] that God
[51:07] hates if we are God's
[51:10] City if we are his dwelling
[51:13] place then we ought
[51:17] to we ought to put away
[51:20] Abominations CU they shouldn't be in
[51:21] that City if we then are his Kings
[51:25] having been made this city we ought to
[51:27] put away Abominations if we are his
[51:29] Temple and therefore priest within that
[51:31] t Temple we ought to put away
[51:34] Abominations if we are the sacrifice we
[51:37] ought to put away Abominations if we are
[51:39] the ones offering the sacrifice we ought
[51:41] to put away Abominations if we are in
[51:44] the image of God then we must put away
[51:48] Abominations are we clear on this we're
[51:52] we're not going to look at the law as
[51:53] some sort of archaic thing and be like
[51:55] wow we can't wash our pots and sink and
[51:57] we can't mix our Cottons with our Linens
[51:58] no go back to the way of God who says
[52:01] there's things I hate and if he said it
[52:03] 4,000 years ago that he hated it he
[52:05] hates it today it's not the requirement
[52:07] of the law that was fulfilled in Christ
[52:10] that Paul says don't bring us back to
[52:12] that because those are things imposed
[52:15] under the law until the Holy Ghost would
[52:16] come and could keep us now there's
[52:19] things that still remain the same
[52:21] sisters principles of Holiness Brothers
[52:23] principles of modesty and integrity and
[52:26] honest y there's things that have never
[52:31] changed in 2 Corinthians chapter 6: 17
[52:34] and
[52:35] 18 says wherefore come out from among
[52:39] them and be ye separate sayith the Lord
[52:43] and touch not the unclean thing and I
[52:46] will receive you and will be a father
[52:49] unto you and ye shall be my sons and
[52:51] daughters sayith the Lord Almighty we
[52:54] can't read that to mean that once we
[52:55] separate we become his sons but he's
[52:57] saying that if you will come out from
[52:59] among them be separate and touch not the
[53:02] unclean thing that is
[53:04] acceptable then I can be identified with
[53:07] you I will be identified as your father
[53:09] and you will be seen as my sons and
[53:13] daughters flee from
[53:16] ugliness put away all ugliness we ought
[53:19] to disdain
[53:21] ugliness and if there's one thing we
[53:23] ought to be pursuing in our lives on
[53:24] every level and I I'm I I'm
[53:28] gonna we mentioned it Sunday there's
[53:30] very specific things that God has said
[53:32] that we should be doing precise
[53:34] things and it it amounts to the pursuit
[53:37] of
[53:39] beauty that I don't want this ugliness
[53:42] in my life and I know a lot of times
[53:44] we're thinking about how long a skirt is
[53:45] and whether or not it has a slit and how
[53:47] tight a shirt is and whether or not a
[53:48] guy cuts his hair and there's a lot of
[53:49] things that relate to today standards of
[53:52] Holiness and things that God accepts and
[53:54] things that God desires and things that
[53:56] would be imposed upon us but do you
[53:58] realize it's even down to the way that
[53:59] we treat other people the way that we
[54:01] talk and the way that we lie and the way
[54:03] that we mishandle things those all all
[54:05] of those things relate to things that
[54:06] God
[54:07] hates look at the things that God hates
[54:09] in the Old Testament he still hates them
[54:12] today so put away all
[54:16] ugliness put away all this ugliness and
[54:19] pursue
[54:20] Beauty make it a passion of ours the
[54:23] Lord I'm I'm not wanting to be beautiful
[54:25] to the world
[54:27] I'm wanting to be beautiful like
[54:29] you and I want to be pleasing to you
[54:33] harmonious with you if you could stand
[54:35] with me and pray
[54:36] tonight may the Lord bless you may he be
[54:40] your portion our gracious heavenly
[54:42] father as we close this service we'll be
[54:45] worshiping for a few moments singing
[54:47] some
[54:48] songs I ask that you would be kind to
[54:50] your people once
[54:52] again and Lord I feel a sense of urg y
[54:56] to be very
[54:58] forceful that you still hate ugliness
[55:04] [Music]
[55:06] today and that ugliness takes on many
[55:09] different
[55:10] forms and the world tries to dress it up
[55:14] tries to make it seem less
[55:16] ugly deceitful just as the devil did in
[55:19] the beginning but Lord I believe your
[55:21] attitude towards sexual sin fornication
[55:25] adultery
[55:27] lust and a and
[55:30] homosexuality and the abuse of our
[55:32] bodies the intoxications of substances
[55:36] uh lying dishonesty
[55:38] immodesty unrighteous apparel ungodly
[55:43] appearances Lord whether it be in in the
[55:46] use of jewelry and makeup Lord there's a
[55:48] lot of things that we could say well
[55:49] you're trifling and these things are
[55:51] Petty but Lord there's a clear clear
[55:54] picture in the Bible of things that you
[55:56] hate
[55:58] and Lord if we're we're just going to
[56:00] pay lip service to you then we can do
[56:02] whatever we
[56:03] want Lord if we're just going to come
[56:05] and sing a song then dress how you want
[56:07] live how you want but if we are going to
[56:09] be living sacrifices it's clear in the
[56:11] word that you accept certain
[56:15] sacrifices and Lord we cannot be perfect
[56:17] in ourselves nor are we striving for
[56:19] sinless Perfection but what we want is
[56:21] our character to be made perfect and we
[56:24] want our lives to be this bouquet to you
[56:26] he want it to be a sweet smelling
[56:29] incense an aroma that is pleasing not
[56:31] foul
[56:32] smelling not inconsistent
[56:36] hypocritical Lord we pray for
[56:38] consistency that expresses a Divine
[56:40] symmetry we pray for a Holiness which
[56:44] declares a a godliness a righteousness
[56:47] that is from above may we strive for
[56:50] Purity in our language and our
[56:51] conversations and in our
[56:55] thoughts and and Lord before we even
[56:57] begin to form some
[57:00] idea of what's trying to be imposed and
[57:03] to put it in the category of a clothline
[57:05] gospel or just more it echoes of
[57:07] legalism Lord may we just search your
[57:09] heart and find your way and say that if
[57:12] that's what you require I give
[57:14] it and at least accept tonight that
[57:17] there's an ugliness you do not want
[57:19] there's an ugliness that you want to
[57:21] change there's a beauty that you'd like
[57:22] to give us in exchange for those ashes
[57:25] in change for that
[57:28] Brokenness and Lord where we remain hurt
[57:30] and broken and feeble and lame and halt
[57:33] you say I am your healer I am your
[57:35] portion my grace is sufficient my love
[57:38] covers you will not require something
[57:40] from
[57:43] us that we cannot give so Lord I offer
[57:47] my life to
[57:49] you I want you to use me for your glory
[57:53] and I pray that you deal particularly
