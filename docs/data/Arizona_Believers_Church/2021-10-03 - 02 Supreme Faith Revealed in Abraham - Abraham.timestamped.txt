[0:00] and continuing on the second part of
[0:03] supreme Faith revealed in
[0:05] Abraham and I don't know that I often
[0:08] would say this and it's not monetized or
[0:12] anything but I if you didn't hear the
[0:14] first part on Wednesday night I would
[0:16] encourage you um to go back and listen
[0:19] to that those of us here at our home
[0:21] Church um to listen to that as we trust
[0:24] that we'll probably be on this subject
[0:25] for a little bit uh but we began on uh
[0:29] Wednesday night on the subject of
[0:30] supreme Faith revealed in Abraham and
[0:33] I'd like just to go a step further in
[0:35] the subject and maybe in saying a step
[0:37] further we're kind of coming back and
[0:39] beginning to look at Abraham's life in
[0:41] its be in the beginning where the
[0:42] scripture identifies him but um I think
[0:45] that first part would really help kind
[0:47] of Orient Us in terms of what my burden
[0:49] and vision is for this subject so uh we
[0:52] begin here in Genesis chapter 12 veres 1
[0:54] to4 now the Lord had said notice how it
[0:57] kind of is telling us what had already
[1:00] happened previously now the Lord had
[1:01] said unto Abram get thee out of thy
[1:04] country and from thy Kindred from thy
[1:06] Father's House unto a land that I will
[1:08] show thee and I will make of thee a
[1:11] great nation I Will Bless thee and make
[1:13] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[1:15] blessing and I'll bless them that bless
[1:17] thee and curse him that curseth thee and
[1:20] in thee shall all families of the earth
[1:22] be blessed so Abraham departed as the
[1:25] Lord had spoke unto him and lot with
[1:28] with him and Abram was 70 and5 years old
[1:31] when he departed out of heran and you
[1:34] can be
[1:36] seated we used a statement in the last
[1:39] few service Services where brother bham
[1:41] is speaking of a supreme faith and he
[1:43] says to have that kind of Faith you have
[1:45] to know perfectly what you were doing
[1:48] and then he in describing perfectly
[1:51] knowing what you're doing instead of him
[1:53] kind of zeroing in on being able to
[1:55] figure out all the Mysteries and all the
[1:57] types in the scripture or having a
[1:59] perfect understanding
[2:00] of all Divine Mysteries and shadows and
[2:03] types throughout the Bible he begins to
[2:05] talk about acts of faith how that you
[2:07] say you're going to go home tonight um
[2:09] and that is an Act of Faith or I'm going
[2:11] to meet someone tomorrow that's an Act
[2:13] of Faith and he said that the faith in
[2:15] God that's the way the things of God are
[2:18] you trust him and then you watch him do
[2:21] so many things until trusting him in
[2:24] watching him do what he said he would do
[2:25] he says becomes a regular routine and so
[2:28] he talks about how the rap is going to
[2:30] be the regular routine of following the
[2:32] scriptures and the pl the plans of God
[2:35] the Rapture is going to be the process
[2:38] of the F regular routine of following
[2:40] the scriptures and the plans of God and
[2:43] so that was kind of something that we
[2:44] were using um as a basis for this
[2:47] supreme Faith revealed in Abraham so if
[2:50] we think about it that way Supreme faith
[2:52] is going to come from a regular routine
[2:55] of following the word of God and the
[2:56] will of God and so we think rapturing
[2:58] Faith while that's got to be something
[3:00] pretty incredible and and far-reaching
[3:02] but it's just going to be the regular
[3:04] routine of following the word of God and
[3:05] the will of God for our lives and so
[3:08] it's going to be on a daily basis acts
[3:10] of faith uh and as we have these daily
[3:13] acts of faith it grows our faith into a
[3:16] perfect rapturing faith and so the
[3:18] process of coming to uh uh receiving and
[3:22] manifesting or expressing rapturing
[3:24] faith we have to look at as just a daily
[3:26] life before the Lord daily acts of faith
[3:29] and it's just the these daily acts of
[3:30] faith you're building rapturing faith
[3:33] and and we can't even look at it in
[3:34] terms of you see a picture maybe of
[3:36] someone who's a bodybuilder somebody who
[3:38] wants to uh have large muscles well they
[3:40] got that way through a very a process
[3:42] and there's really no shortcuts in the
[3:44] in the plan of God where we can just
[3:46] inject a solution into our spiritual
[3:48] muscles and they're going to get very
[3:49] full and very and big and very showy
[3:53] it's got to be daily acts of faith that
[3:55] are developing your faith into a
[3:57] rapturing faith and so there's no
[3:59] convention coming up where there's going
[4:01] to be a Saturday night prayer line
[4:03] that's going to inject into you some
[4:05] sort of uh Solution that's going to give
[4:07] you really big Burly Faith muscles
[4:09] that's going to come through daily
[4:11] following the routine of the scripture
[4:13] and in your daily routine if it brings
[4:15] you through a prayer line then it's
[4:16] going to have the effect of increasing
[4:19] your faith piece by piece and so
[4:21] rapturing Faith or we might even use the
[4:24] term perfect faith and supreme Faith as
[4:27] we're using that um nomencl your Supreme
[4:30] faith can seem to be very mysterious and
[4:33] in being mysterious it can as we talked
[4:35] about Wednesday night it can be
[4:36] unreachable um and then some ways even
[4:38] seem impossible when we start putting uh
[4:40] rapturing faith and perfect faith in
[4:42] these different categories or viewing it
[4:44] from different perspectives but as I
[4:46] looked at the life of Abraham and was
[4:48] just reading in the Bible uh in in
[4:50] Genesis chapter 12 and just reading
[4:52] through the subsequent chapters
[4:54] something began to stand out to me about
[4:56] the example of Abraham when we think
[4:58] about him now he's Legend we think about
[5:01] the faith of Abraham we think oh Abraham
[5:03] the fa the father of our faith and he's
[5:04] such a he's such an incredible example
[5:07] and looms so large as this luminary of
[5:09] Faith but really if we look at the
[5:11] example of Abraham faith can be made so
[5:14] practical we begin to look at it to
[5:16] where faith is so practical that it just
[5:18] from walking daily in the plan of God
[5:21] and the word of God our faith becomes
[5:22] Supreme faith that just by following the
[5:25] word of God that's what manifests the
[5:27] supernatural we don't go on the hunt for
[5:29] a supernatural experience we just live
[5:31] according to the word of God and the
[5:32] supernatural happens and so that's what
[5:34] really struck me is this supreme Faith
[5:36] revealed in Abraham that in his life his
[5:39] life unfolds what our faith is as
[5:42] children of God that we can look to his
[5:44] life and his example and see how our
[5:47] faith as the children of God is going to
[5:49] unfold brother Brandon makes this
[5:51] statement in the unconditional Covenant
[5:52] that God made with the people Abraham
[5:55] was the example what all he was going to
[5:57] do to Abraham he was going to do to him
[6:00] and his seed and when he says to his
[6:02] seed he's not just talking about the
[6:03] natural seed through Isaac or even
[6:05] ishmail but what God did to Abraham he's
[6:08] also going to do with his Royal seed to
[6:10] the children of God so Abraham is the
[6:13] example and the message influence he
[6:15] says he was showing an example of what
[6:17] he was going to do in the last days as
[6:20] God dealt with Abraham in Genesis
[6:21] Chapter 18 as he made himself known to
[6:23] him he said he was giving an example of
[6:27] what he was going to do in the last days
[6:29] so what God did to Abraham he does to
[6:31] his seed what God did to Abraham in
[6:33] Genesis 18 he's going to do in the last
[6:35] days and then brother branam in
[6:37] referring to him offering up Isaac and
[6:40] being willing to offer up Isaac upon an
[6:42] altar he says in one day when God seen
[6:45] that his servant was determined to be an
[6:47] example for people of today it's it's
[6:51] then that Abraham's Faith the scripture
[6:53] tells us reached its Supreme expression
[6:55] and it was fully developed and mature
[6:57] when Abraham set forth to uh to take the
[7:01] life of Isaac in obedience to God's
[7:02] command it's then that God realized his
[7:05] servant was determined to be an example
[7:07] of people today I do not believe that
[7:09] brother bam is suggesting that Abraham
[7:11] thought oh I want to be an example for
[7:13] people in 2021 but rather he had a
[7:15] determined faith and that he was
[7:18] determined uh uh um to obey the will of
[7:20] God and he had certain convictions and
[7:22] certain Revelations and certain
[7:24] understandings and it was Abraham's
[7:26] Revelation and I want you to ponder this
[7:28] very deeply maybe in instead of me just
[7:30] saying it right now as my heart is
[7:31] overwhelmed with it maybe just for you
[7:33] to think about it what what are some of
[7:35] the characteristics of that act where
[7:38] Abraham was willing to offer up Isaac
[7:40] upon an altar that spoke of an end time
[7:43] Faith why why was it he determined to be
[7:45] an example he was determined to be an
[7:47] example for people of today what was it
[7:49] about his act then that would actually
[7:52] testify of the kind of faith that we
[7:53] would have now just ponder that a little
[7:56] bit so I want to look today at the
[7:59] Genesis of Abraham's faith and if you're
[8:01] sharp you'll notice I said today so I
[8:03] didn't just say this
[8:04] morning so you could you could be under
[8:06] suspense that perhaps this service will
[8:08] continue to
[8:09] noon but and then I want to look at the
[8:12] Genesis of Abraham's faith and where it
[8:15] began and where the Bible chooses to
[8:16] pick up the story of Abraham we'll refer
[8:18] to him as Abraham even though the Bible
[8:20] calls him Abram uh in these first few
[8:23] chapters of his life that's recorded
[8:25] here in Genesis but I want to look at
[8:27] the beginning of his the calling for him
[8:30] because our faith has an origin and
[8:32] there's a place where our faith begins
[8:34] but more importantly not only does it
[8:36] have an origin but it has a Destiny and
[8:39] as we begin to look at Abraham's Faith
[8:41] we'll recognize that there's a spot
[8:42] where God begins with him but in God
[8:45] beginning dealing with Abraham at the
[8:47] Genesis at the beginning it's not just
[8:50] uh you know something that was for the
[8:51] moment but it was forward-looking there
[8:53] was something that gave Abraham this
[8:55] expectation where he was looking for
[8:57] something and so our faith has a
[8:59] beginning but it also it looks to
[9:01] Destiny it's something we're looking
[9:02] forward to and I I want to identify in
[9:05] this way our faith has a beginning and
[9:07] it's in seed form and it has certain
[9:09] characteristics but in that faith is the
[9:11] potential of perfect faith and so
[9:13] there's something Supreme and full and
[9:15] perfect about the faith that we've
[9:17] received and in 1 Corinthians chapter
[9:19] 15: 19 Paul says if in this life only we
[9:23] have hope in Christ we are of all men
[9:25] most
[9:26] miserable there's something about the
[9:28] faith of Abra that was forward looking
[9:30] to where it wasn't just what was
[9:31] happening that day that gave Abraham all
[9:33] his satisfaction and his joy and his
[9:35] peace and and a sense of uh uh worth and
[9:39] and well-being it was something about
[9:41] the future that uh made Abraham who he
[9:44] was and made him the father of our faith
[9:46] and so it's I think it's important for
[9:48] us as Believers to realize that the
[9:50] faith that we have looks beyond this
[9:53] life and that what we're living for is
[9:55] more than just a funeral with all the
[9:57] pews completely packed in a lot of nice
[9:59] things to say about us we're not living
[10:01] for a headstone or gravestone as it were
[10:04] we're living for a Rapture we're living
[10:05] for a change and we're so confident in
[10:08] that that even if we were to go by way
[10:10] of death we know that we're coming up in
[10:12] a resurrection and so there's no defeat
[10:14] in death there's no fear of the
[10:16] afterlife and so if we in this life only
[10:19] have hope in Christ we are the most
[10:21] miserable people so the fact that we're
[10:23] the happiest is in that we have hope in
[10:26] Christ in an
[10:27] afterlife this is part of the faith of
[10:29] Abraham and we're looking at the Genesis
[10:31] of his faith it says in Hebrews 11: 8
[10:34] to10 by faith Abraham when he was called
[10:38] to go out into a place which he should
[10:40] have receive for an inheritance obeyed
[10:43] and he went out not knowing whether he
[10:46] went now in com this I had meant to say
[10:48] at the outset it was nice to see brother
[10:50] Reggie and his family here today and I
[10:52] wanted to just Express Thanks for the
[10:54] service he ministered a couple weeks ago
[10:56] I was tremendously blessed and then
[10:58] having the Hebrew scholer here today I'm
[11:00] a little bit nervous about going into
[11:02] the book of Hebrews I I can I'm anxious
[11:05] to kind of hear how the Lord has dealt
[11:06] with him on these scriptures but I
[11:07] enjoyed what was ministered on Wednesday
[11:09] night it blessed me so so much and I
[11:11] wanted to say that when I saw him and
[11:12] his family here today that I appreciated
[11:14] that service that he ministered on
[11:16] choice but notice here as it says by
[11:18] faith Abraham when he was called out to
[11:20] go into a place which he should after
[11:23] Reed for an inheritance obeyed and went
[11:25] out so we can look at it in retrospect
[11:28] and say he ultimately was showed
[11:29] different things and and God unfolded
[11:32] things as he went but he went out not
[11:33] knowing whether he went but he knew
[11:35] there was something coming he knew there
[11:36] was a place that was going to be shown
[11:38] to him he knew there was a an ultimate
[11:40] this says by faith he solded in the land
[11:42] of promise now in a land of promise but
[11:45] as in a strange country dwelling in
[11:47] Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[11:49] Heirs with him of the same promise but
[11:51] notice for he looked for a city which
[11:53] hath foundations whose Builder and maker
[11:55] is God even though Abraham lived within
[11:59] the geographical location of the land
[12:01] that was promised to him and he lived in
[12:03] the land of promise he lived as if he
[12:05] was a stranger even dwelling intense
[12:08] with Isaac and Jacob those who are heirs
[12:10] with him in the promise why is it he
[12:12] seemed to be such a stranger in that
[12:14] land because he was looking for a city
[12:16] to come he was looking for a city whose
[12:18] Builder and maker was God that had
[12:20] foundations and wasn't transitory and
[12:22] wasn't tense and wasn't subject to
[12:25] Invasion and droughts and and changing
[12:27] in in the weather he was was looking for
[12:29] something permanent so Abraham's Faith
[12:32] was characterized of being
[12:33] forward-looking he had a vision he had
[12:36] something he was always looking
[12:37] to and if we look at this statement he
[12:41] was called to go out into a place which
[12:45] he should after receive for an
[12:46] inheritance when he was called to go out
[12:49] into a place if we look in Genesis CH 12
[12:52] this is when he was called or this is
[12:54] the first reference we see of him being
[12:56] called specific explicit reference and
[12:59] so Abraham's faith and this is where we
[13:01] can identify with this and and I would
[13:04] even go so far as I say this might be my
[13:06] emphasis for the remainder of the
[13:07] service is that Abraham's Faith began
[13:10] when God called him that's the that's
[13:13] the beginning of Faith this is the
[13:15] beginning of faith is not as we are
[13:17] raised to believe something and we begin
[13:19] to learn about the faith of our parents
[13:21] and then we adopt that Faith as our
[13:23] Paradigm for the way of viewing the
[13:25] scripture a way of viewing life or
[13:26] discipline to approach Healthy Living
[13:28] from a a spiritual perspective our
[13:30] mental well-being but rather our faith
[13:32] begins when God calls us we have that
[13:35] word come to us and so this calling is
[13:38] at the core of true
[13:40] faith and when we begin to as this is my
[13:43] desire in looking at this and just maybe
[13:45] with a group like this we're only
[13:46] bringing these things back to your
[13:48] remembrance because you already know
[13:49] them but by looking at how Abraham's
[13:52] Faith began when God called him I think
[13:54] in looking at even the few things we'll
[13:56] see today we can relate to Abraham more
[13:58] than we think
[14:01] because again as I mentioned before even
[14:02] this morning he's such a legend when it
[14:04] comes to Faith that we don't we just
[14:06] don't readily identify with him we think
[14:08] about the acts of faith and the things
[14:10] that he did and the way God revealed
[14:11] himself and these visitations of the
[14:14] Lord to Abraham and we're just thinking
[14:16] wow you know he's the father of Faith
[14:18] but he's like an idol that we're always
[14:20] just looking up to and always admiring
[14:22] but we can never be it but no he is the
[14:25] he is the father of the faith and then
[14:27] we are of the same faith
[14:29] so there's something about his example
[14:31] that should speak to us to identify the
[14:33] faith that we have so Abraham's Faith
[14:37] begins when God calls him in Genesis
[14:39] 12:1 now the Lord had said unto Abram so
[14:44] this the way that this is
[14:46] structured is and we'll come back to
[14:48] Genesis chap 11 just to kind of see how
[14:50] this uh the why it's ordered this way
[14:53] but it kind of just it's going to
[14:55] describe some incidences that's taking
[14:57] place in Abraham's life but then it
[14:58] gives us this background that God had
[15:00] spoke to Abram and when God spoke to
[15:02] Abram he says get thee out of thy
[15:04] country notice these different stages
[15:06] get out of your your country from thy
[15:08] Kindred and from thy Father's House unto
[15:11] a land that I will show thee so he's
[15:13] saying leave and as you leave and as you
[15:16] depart I'm going to show you where
[15:17] you're going so he asked Abraham to
[15:20] begin a journey without knowing where he
[15:21] was going and there's a saying that if
[15:23] you don't know where you're going any
[15:24] road will get you there but Abraham
[15:27] didn't uh he may not have known where he
[15:29] was going but he knew there was only one
[15:31] place that God was going to lead him
[15:32] there was an ultimate so he said but
[15:34] this is how you have to start I'm going
[15:35] to show you where you're going to be I'm
[15:38] going to show you where I'm leading you
[15:39] but there were certain things he had to
[15:40] do he had to get out of his country
[15:42] first and and this is where I want you
[15:44] to identify with the faith of Abraham
[15:46] when we when we got born again we didn't
[15:48] understand everything all at once and I
[15:50] was like iy I got born again last night
[15:52] I've got rapturing faith I'm just ready
[15:53] to do all sorts of uh powerful mil
[15:56] Miracles and I understand every
[15:57] scripture and I know exactly the date in
[15:59] the moment when my body's going to be
[16:00] changed those aren't that's not what
[16:02] happened when you were born again but
[16:03] there's things that take place and
[16:05] things that have to transpire Before The
[16:07] Next Step can uh come forward before God
[16:10] can bless and God can manifest and God
[16:12] can do things so he got out of his
[16:13] country but then he had to get away from
[16:15] family extended family and then he had
[16:17] to get away from as the Bible says here
[16:19] from his father's house there was a
[16:21] separation that begins to take place
[16:23] unto a land that I will show thee so in
[16:25] Genesis chapter 11 we'll start with
[16:27] verse 27
[16:30] it says this and now these are the
[16:32] generations of tah tah begat Abram nahor
[16:35] and heran and heran begat lot so these
[16:38] are brothers Abram neor and heran and
[16:41] then heran has a son lot that's where
[16:43] lot is the one that we see with Abraham
[16:45] later and haran died before his father
[16:47] Tara in the land of his Nativity in ER
[16:51] of the
[16:51] cdes so here they are in ER of the
[16:55] caldes this is the land where they are
[16:58] and then being in the cdes there's a lot
[17:00] of assumptions that we could make about
[17:02] them being in cdes and then being Moon
[17:04] worshippers and worshippers of Idols I
[17:06] we know that it's commonly believed and
[17:09] we're taught that Abraham and his family
[17:11] were Idol worshippers and in being Idol
[17:13] worshippers I want you to think about
[17:15] this particular aspect about worshiping
[17:17] an idol is they would they would have
[17:21] these images that represented a deity so
[17:24] something that they could see they could
[17:26] worship the god of the Moon and they
[17:28] could see the moon they could worship
[17:29] the god of the sun and they could see
[17:31] the Sun and so the images of the moon
[17:33] the images of the sun something that
[17:35] could strike the eye the appearance
[17:38] could they could worship that or they
[17:39] would fashion themselves idols and they
[17:42] would become graven images that they
[17:43] would worship and so something they
[17:45] could see something they could
[17:46] experience with their senses and
[17:48] something that could never speak back to
[17:50] them but yet they believed in some deity
[17:53] or some life related to it so Abraham's
[17:56] life begins in ER of the Cales he's
[17:59] there with his father and his brothers
[18:00] his brother dies and then Joshua and
[18:03] Joshua
[18:04] 24:2 describes him this way and Joshua
[18:07] said unto all the people thus sayith the
[18:09] Lord God of Israel your fathers dwelt on
[18:12] the other side of the flood in old time
[18:15] even Tara the father of Abraham and the
[18:18] father of Nar and they served other gods
[18:22] so Joshua and this is really the one
[18:24] place where we have this very explicit
[18:26] reference to Abraham's family being Idol
[18:28] worshippers
[18:29] but notice now they're in ER of the cald
[18:31] this is where they live this is where
[18:33] Abraham's F father's house is this is
[18:35] where his Kindred is and this is his
[18:37] country so these verses identified the
[18:40] country that God was going to call
[18:41] Abraham out of the Kindred that he had
[18:43] to get away from and the father's house
[18:45] he had to separate from and before he
[18:47] could come into the country that God
[18:48] would show him and it's in this
[18:51] condition that God speaks to Abraham and
[18:54] says get thee out of thy country come
[18:56] out of ir the caldes come away from thy
[18:58] Kindred come away from thy father's
[19:00] house that serve these other gods it
[19:02] says on the other side of the flood it
[19:04] was located in this other region this
[19:06] other place H uh east of the promised
[19:09] land where he would ultimately arrive
[19:12] and so this is the beginning of
[19:13] Abraham's faith we see that he's
[19:15] mentioned with his father and his
[19:17] brothers and it says that the uh Haron
[19:20] dies before his brother dies uh in the
[19:23] land of his Nativity and it's there that
[19:25] we know that God spoke to him because in
[19:27] Genesis chap 15
[19:29] 15:7 notice this and I've just going to
[19:32] these Great Links to identify these
[19:34] things in scripture because as I begin
[19:35] to read it I said well the Lord had said
[19:37] and it's like well when did he actually
[19:38] speak to him and well who was it that
[19:40] moved out of ER and who was moving and I
[19:42] know it's the Bible if you look at all
[19:44] these references in the Bible it tells
[19:45] this beautiful picture of how God dealt
[19:47] with Abraham in Genesis 15:7 and he said
[19:51] unto him I am the Lord that brought thee
[19:54] out of er of the caldes to give thee
[19:56] this land to inherit so it's God that
[20:00] brought Abraham out of Earth as we read
[20:04] we're going to read here in a moment and
[20:05] I'm reading these first because when we
[20:07] read the the instance in Genesis chap 11
[20:09] it's maybe not clear But as God speaks
[20:12] to Abraham and these things are written
[20:13] down he says I'm the one that brought
[20:15] thee out of Earth to give thee this land
[20:17] to inherit so it's this land it was
[20:20] called a Promised Land why because he
[20:22] was going to inherit that land it was a
[20:25] Promised Land because it was promised to
[20:27] him and it spoke of a future your
[20:29] promise so when we think about the faith
[20:31] of Abraham he says I'm going to call you
[20:33] Abraham had to believe God and by faith
[20:35] he's going to souljour and go into a
[20:37] place that he should after receive for a
[20:39] promise there's something where his
[20:40] faith begins but there's also a destiny
[20:43] of his faith this future promise this
[20:45] future land there's certain things that
[20:47] he promised Abraham that he wasn't
[20:49] seeing immediately in his life and
[20:51] Nehemiah chapter 9:7 Thou Art the Lord
[20:54] the the Lord The God Who did US choose
[20:57] Abram and broughtest him forth out of ir
[21:00] the caldes and gavest him the name of
[21:03] Abraham so God chose Abraham brought him
[21:06] out of her the caldes and gave him the
[21:08] name
[21:10] Abraham it's God's choosing God's the
[21:12] one that brought him out of her in Acts
[21:15] 7: 2 to 4 and he said men and Brethren
[21:18] fathers hearken here Stephen speaking
[21:20] this the god of Glory appeared unto our
[21:22] Father Abraham when he was in
[21:25] Mesopotamia so when we read it it says
[21:27] now the Lord had said unto Abram and it
[21:29] seems that maybe a very uh there might
[21:32] be certain things that we begin to think
[21:33] about wow what was that like and how did
[21:35] God make his himself known to him and
[21:36] how did he speak to him Stephen
[21:38] describes as the glory of God appearing
[21:40] unto him when he's in Mesopotamia when
[21:42] he's in the herb the caldes God speaks
[21:44] to him before he dwelt in
[21:47] Kanan and said unto him get thee out of
[21:49] thy country and from thy Kindred and
[21:51] come into the land which I shall show
[21:53] thee then came he out of the land of the
[21:55] calans and dwelt in heran from then when
[21:58] his father was dead he removed him into
[22:01] this land wherein you now dwell so
[22:03] notice how the scripture gets into these
[22:05] details of how that God speaks to
[22:09] Abraham the glory of the Lord appearing
[22:11] to Abraham he's in Earth the cdes and
[22:13] Mesopotamia then he goes to haran or
[22:15] haran as it says in in Acts chapter 7
[22:18] and then from there he comes down into
[22:20] Canaan now with that is the background
[22:23] and we read Genesis 11 we'll start with
[22:25] verse
[22:26] 29 and Abra Abram and nahor took them
[22:30] wives the name of Abram's wife was Sarah
[22:33] and the name of nahor's wife was milka
[22:34] the daughter of Heron the father of
[22:36] milka and the father of isca but Sarah
[22:40] was Barren she had no child very
[22:43] remarkable details at the beginning here
[22:45] of describing Abraham and Tara took
[22:49] Abram his son and lot the son of heran
[22:52] his son's son and Sarah his
[22:54] daughter-in-law his son Abram's wife and
[22:57] they went forth with from IR the Cales
[23:00] to go into the land of Canaan and they
[23:02] came unto heran and dwelt there and the
[23:06] days of Tara were 205 years and Tara
[23:09] died in haran so now we read that it's a
[23:13] little bit different than how we read it
[23:14] in Genesis 15 and Acts chapter 7 and
[23:16] these other places if we're just reading
[23:18] this it sounds like Tara took his sons a
[23:21] a and his grandson and they're going to
[23:23] go off and he's going to take them and
[23:25] move them to another place but even
[23:27] though the Bible say says it was Tara
[23:29] that took his sons and took his family
[23:32] it was God that called Abram and it was
[23:35] the glory of the Lord appearing to Abram
[23:37] that was going to cause them to move and
[23:39] this is why they're moving but because
[23:42] although i' say it this way although God
[23:44] spoke to Abraham Tara being the father
[23:46] is honored as the one that is the leader
[23:50] but why are they moving because God
[23:52] appeared to
[23:53] Abraham listen there's ways that we can
[23:55] look at our lives and we can see that
[23:57] there's a lot of people that have said
[23:58] and done things and there's a lot of
[23:59] movements and a lot of movement of
[24:02] certain people a lot of things that have
[24:03] taken place and it may seem well this
[24:05] person was the leader and this person
[24:07] was making the decision and this person
[24:08] did this and that person did that but
[24:10] it's all because God has spoke to you
[24:13] and Tara took his family and moved H and
[24:16] moved to Haron but it was God that spoke
[24:18] to Abraham and Abraham's like hey I've
[24:20] got to move I've got to get out of my
[24:22] country it was the rest of the family
[24:23] that went with them but the promise was
[24:25] to Abram and the rest of the family may
[24:27] have followed Abraham's like hey this is
[24:29] not a family thing this isn't a kindred
[24:31] thing this isn't a a country thing this
[24:34] is something I've got to do in my own
[24:35] personal faith and conviction and it
[24:37] says to they left to go into the land of
[24:40] Canaan so that's where he was ultimately
[24:42] going but they stopped and they dwell in
[24:44] heran for a few years the days of Tera
[24:47] were 205 years and Tara died in
[24:49] heran and so chapter 11 ends with them
[24:52] in haran or Corinthians says Kuran
[24:56] kurran about halfway between
[24:59] ER where they came from in Canaan
[25:02] there's different maps you can look at
[25:03] to see how they would had traveled and
[25:05] moved but that's where chapter 11 ends
[25:07] so when we read in chapter 11 that terod
[25:10] took his family and moved from ER to
[25:12] heran it's God calling Abraham and the
[25:15] glory of the Lord appearing to Abraham
[25:16] that causes the
[25:18] move as it says in Genesis 12 ver1 we'll
[25:21] read it again now the Lord had said unto
[25:23] Abram get thee out of thy country and
[25:26] from thy kindred
[25:28] and from thy Father's House unto a land
[25:32] that I will show thee notice these
[25:33] different elements the Lord had said
[25:36] unto Abram Acts chapter 7 uh Genesis
[25:39] chapter 15 these different places that
[25:42] we can read in the Bible show us that
[25:44] God appeared to Abram and his message to
[25:47] Abrams you need to leave
[25:49] ER and there's going to be a land I need
[25:51] to show you but as you leave ER you've
[25:52] got to separate from your Kindred you
[25:53] got to separate from your family as you
[25:56] read this and I I don't want to
[25:58] encourage maybe
[25:59] speculation but I think it would be fair
[26:02] to assume that there were no doubt many
[26:04] things that are hidden in this passage
[26:07] says and the Lord had said unto Abram
[26:09] get thee out of thy country Steph says
[26:12] that it was the god of Glory that
[26:14] appeared Under Our Father Abraham when
[26:16] he was in Mesopotamia and he says that I
[26:18] am the Lord that brought the out of her
[26:20] and there's these different things that
[26:21] are taking place in Abraham's life as
[26:23] it's described and yet we don't know the
[26:26] exact moment that God begin to speak to
[26:27] him don't know the exact day that he
[26:29] left but perhaps hidden In this passage
[26:31] are many days if not years of
[26:34] prayer maybe there's months of seeking
[26:37] and meditation and pondering of this one
[26:40] that has spoken to him where he's just
[26:42] there working and he feels this unction
[26:44] and this presence and this power comes
[26:46] and something speaks him says I want you
[26:48] to leave IR the Cales and I want you to
[26:50] go to a place that I'll show you and
[26:52] just follow me and he's like what was
[26:54] that I've never had the moon speak to me
[26:57] before
[26:59] never had these graven images speak to
[27:00] me before but the revelation of God to
[27:03] Abraham must have been a process must
[27:06] have been a way that God was dealing
[27:08] with his heart to get his attention and
[27:10] bring him to this conviction and this
[27:12] Faith but regardless of the passage of
[27:14] time whether it was in just a single
[27:16] instance or maybe through multiple
[27:17] instances as we're
[27:19] pondering there came a time when Abraham
[27:22] was convinced of God convinced of this
[27:25] voice that was speaking to him convinced
[27:26] of this a glory that was appearing to
[27:29] him convinced of this one that was
[27:30] saying Hey I want you to leave ER the
[27:32] CES so well there was this premonition
[27:34] there was this Spirit there was this
[27:35] voice there was this one talking to me
[27:37] well was it the moon God was it the Sun
[27:39] God was it the god of the uh of the
[27:41] camel what which God was it well it was
[27:43] just a voice it was an unction it was a
[27:44] presence it was a spirit that spoke to
[27:46] me and told me to leave my country to
[27:47] leave my Kindred to leave my father's
[27:49] house and to go to a land that he would
[27:51] show me after there was some point where
[27:53] Abraham became convinced of this
[27:56] voice there was some moment where he
[27:58] became convinced of this dealing within
[28:00] his heart and became convinced of this
[28:03] calling that he had to leave his country
[28:05] leave his Kindred and ultimately leave
[28:06] his father's
[28:08] house and then Abraham's obedience
[28:10] unfolded stage by stage as he left ER
[28:14] the cdes as he came to Haron separated
[28:17] from his Kindred and then ultimately
[28:18] separated from his father's
[28:20] house as we continue to read in Genesis
[28:23] CH 12 God's going to establish a new
[28:26] nation and this is uh
[28:29] this is what I was been pondering this
[28:30] week to to a tremendous depths in my
[28:34] heart that as Abraham is being called
[28:36] and he's going to establish a new nation
[28:39] the entire identity of this nation is
[28:41] linked to
[28:43] God no other
[28:45] identity it's not linked to terara it's
[28:47] not linked to haran it's not linked to
[28:48] ER it's not linked to the CIS there's
[28:50] not a geographical marker right when we
[28:53] say the children of Israel we're we're
[28:55] not talking about a geographical
[28:57] location
[28:58] we're talking about a a children of a
[29:00] man Israel and so it's tracing back to
[29:03] somebody and to when we begin to talk
[29:06] about um the children of Israel they
[29:08] even refer to their God the god of
[29:09] Abraham Isaac and Jacob so there are
[29:12] people that are identified and linked
[29:14] God's going to establish a new nation
[29:16] and this nation's identity is going to
[29:18] be singularly wrapped up in God that
[29:22] that's their that's their identity says
[29:24] in Genesis 12: 2 and 3 and I'll make of
[29:27] thee a great Nation when he says he's
[29:29] going to make of him a great nation this
[29:31] nation is going to be identified by this
[29:33] belief in this one that begin to talk to
[29:35] Abram think about it the whole world is
[29:38] groping in darkness this is shortly
[29:39] after the this is after uh the flood and
[29:42] after the Tower of Babel and everyone's
[29:44] being scattered all over the Earth and
[29:45] it's a time of great immigration and
[29:47] everyone's leaving of necessity to go to
[29:49] conquer lands and they're and they're
[29:51] and they're Gathering their tribes and
[29:52] they're huddling around their their
[29:53] languages and around their family
[29:54] identities and everyone has their
[29:56] deities and everyone has their worships
[29:58] and Men mankind are spreading all over
[30:00] the Earth and God says
[30:03] Abram his nextdoor neighbor could have
[30:05] said hey someone spoke to me today and
[30:07] I'm going to be selling widgets and I
[30:09] was told that I need to paint my coat
[30:10] purple and there's a lot of people that
[30:12] might have been hearing voices a lot of
[30:13] people that had a lot of ideas and a lot
[30:14] of different religions and all of a
[30:16] sudden there's this one guy among
[30:17] Millions says hey someone spoke to me
[30:21] okay you're next I God spoke to me and I
[30:24] had this person speak to me and this
[30:26] person spoke to me but there's one man
[30:27] that says I had someone speak to me well
[30:29] what do you call this one I he's I call
[30:32] him God the god of what I he's he's just
[30:35] the one that spoke to me and told me to
[30:36] leave IR the cdis and he's going to show
[30:38] me later where he wants me to be it's I
[30:40] may be putting in terms that are strange
[30:42] but that's the way the scripture says it
[30:44] one day Abraham got a premonition had a
[30:46] voice had a feeling had a something
[30:48] speak to him and make an appearance to
[30:49] him says I want you to leave where
[30:50] you're leaving and I want you to start I
[30:52] want you to get away from your family I
[30:53] want you separate from this person
[30:54] separate from that person and leave
[30:56] where you are and I'll show you later
[30:57] where going and if that begin to happen
[30:59] and we saw someone tweet this out or
[31:01] post it on Instagram or or or or they
[31:04] they called us and told us what they're
[31:05] about to do said are you sure you're
[31:06] doing the right
[31:07] thing you sure this isn't a scam you're
[31:11] getting took oh we we've heard how these
[31:12] things end well that's what Abraham
[31:14] looks like when you start to identify
[31:15] this man in the middle of nowhere all of
[31:17] a sudden saying I've been told by a
[31:18] deity by some Voice by some Feeling by
[31:20] some presence to do these things he says
[31:23] I'll make of thee a great nation Abraham
[31:25] is going to have an identity
[31:28] linked to one man God or one person God
[31:31] I will make of thee a great nation I
[31:33] Will Bless thee and make thy name great
[31:35] this is God speaking these things and
[31:37] thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[31:38] bless them that bless thee and curse him
[31:40] that curseth thee now everything is
[31:42] revolving around this choosing of God
[31:45] and making of This Nation and in the
[31:47] shall all families of the earth be
[31:49] blessed that'd be quite the brag at the
[31:52] brother Brother's coffee the next
[31:53] morning right Abram shows up with his
[31:56] brothers and everyone and says hey guess
[31:57] what in me every single family in Earth
[32:00] is going to be
[32:01] blessed like wow what kind of world are
[32:04] you living in or what you know who's all
[32:06] going to be left but it says all
[32:07] families of the Earth are going to be
[32:08] blessed and this one man named Abram at
[32:11] the time and I'm going to make of thee a
[32:13] great nation a nation whose origin is
[32:15] going to be the origin of this nation
[32:17] it's Genesis and its beginning is not
[32:19] geographical not even bloodline anything
[32:22] its origin is it's not bloodline because
[32:26] that would have then pertained to his
[32:27] father and his brothers and some of them
[32:28] maybe being half Brothers this origin
[32:31] now is going to be faith in
[32:35] God that's the origin the identity the
[32:38] birth of this
[32:39] nation and in Genesis CH 14: 13 it's the
[32:43] first time we ever see this this
[32:44] Appalachian mentioned and there came one
[32:46] that had escaped and told Abram at the
[32:48] time when lot is uh C captured and told
[32:51] Abram the Hebrew now they're called the
[32:53] Hebrew children they're called Hebrews
[32:55] and that's a name that we associate with
[32:57] the children of Israel but Abram has
[32:59] this identity as he a Hebrew Abram the
[33:02] Hebrew might have been the name that he
[33:03] was given amongst those in the region
[33:05] and Hebrew means one who has crossed
[33:08] over one from
[33:11] Beyond and there's a lot of speculation
[33:13] and commentary as to wow it would have
[33:15] been he would have been beyond the river
[33:16] and he would have been beyond this
[33:17] region and he was not there loc located
[33:20] there in this land of Canaan he was not
[33:22] a a local person wasn't indigenous to
[33:24] this region and so they looked at him as
[33:27] one who came from Eber one that came
[33:28] from another place and listen whatever
[33:30] the atmology was he's given this name
[33:33] Hebrew because there was something about
[33:35] his nature and character that
[33:37] represented somebody that was from
[33:39] Beyond he's a Hebrew one who' crossed
[33:42] over he had crossed over a particular
[33:44] way of thinking he' crossed over from
[33:47] idolatry he'd crossed over from a faith
[33:49] of the senses he'd crossed over from SE
[33:51] taste touch feel smell and hear and
[33:53] Imagination conscience memory reason and
[33:55] affection he' crossed over from these
[33:58] senses of body and spirit and he crossed
[34:00] into another realm of faith and he was
[34:02] no longer of the region and the realm
[34:04] and the belief and the convictions of
[34:07] everybody else in Earth he was one man
[34:09] who had crossed over into a faith in
[34:13] God he was a Hebrew Abram the Hebrew
[34:16] there's a deeper meaning that God
[34:17] intended by that phrase Hebrew we talk
[34:19] about the book of Hebrews we're not just
[34:21] talking about people who are their
[34:23] genealogy can trace back to Abraham but
[34:25] we're talking about people who've
[34:26] crossed over right crossed over out of
[34:28] tradition crossed over dead faiths and
[34:30] dead ideologies and crossed into this
[34:33] New and Living Way this life of
[34:36] faith and notice what it says in
[34:38] Galatians 3:
[34:41] 29 and if ye be
[34:43] christs then are ye Abraham's
[34:48] seed and HS according to the
[34:53] promise this is the nation
[34:59] this great nation that God was going to
[35:00] make through
[35:03] Abram it's through Christ that all the
[35:05] families of the Earth are blessed and he
[35:07] said if we are Christ then we are
[35:10] Abraham's seed and HS according to the
[35:14] promise he says Abraham's seed seed is
[35:17] that which contains the
[35:19] germ you are Abraham's seed you are not
[35:23] Believers in
[35:25] Abraham and you are not Abraham
[35:28] ites or Israelites or the children of
[35:32] Israel but you are Abraham's seed and if
[35:35] you're Abraham's seed then you have that
[35:37] which contains the germ so what we're
[35:40] what we're wanting to do in looking at
[35:42] Supreme Faith revealed in Abraham is
[35:44] recognize our spiritual DNA so much talk
[35:48] about 23 and me and trying to figure out
[35:51] uh uh you know what our DNA is and who
[35:53] our family members are and where we come
[35:55] from I thought about on Christmas to to
[35:57] my extended family giving away DNA kits
[35:59] and trying to see which one's the serial
[36:01] killer when they get all nervous and
[36:03] don't want anybody else to you know turn
[36:05] in their DNA because they're going to
[36:06] get outed or something like that but
[36:08] there's all this trying to figure out
[36:09] you know what's in my DNA who am I
[36:11] related to and who does this you know
[36:12] where do I come from and what
[36:14] percentages from this region what
[36:15] percentage from that region if we could
[36:17] if we even just spend 10 minutes trying
[36:19] to think about what our natural lineage
[36:21] and geology and our family tree and
[36:23] there's some people that dedicate their
[36:24] entire lives trying to go back to the
[36:26] place where they're family began and if
[36:28] we'll spend even an hour weeks or months
[36:31] or dedicate our whole lives to a natural
[36:33] family tree how much more ought we to
[36:36] commit to wanting to know what my
[36:38] spiritual Legacy is what my spiritual
[36:41] family tree is and if I'm a Seed of
[36:43] Abraham I want to know what's in that
[36:47] DNA I want to identify the special
[36:49] characteristics of this great nation
[36:52] because there's something that's being
[36:53] passed from him from this great name
[36:56] from these blessings that's not merely
[36:59] related to Natural seed alone because we
[37:01] begin to look at the Seed of Abraham you
[37:03] find well it wasn't just every Seed of
[37:05] Abraham because it wasn't just going to
[37:07] be through Isaac but then it had to be
[37:10] Isaac through
[37:11] Jacob and you see that this this
[37:13] narrowing down it's a spiritual
[37:19] thing and there's been a there was came
[37:22] I I have pulled dozens and dozens of
[37:24] quotations that refer to this but I'm
[37:26] wanting you to see if we are Abraham's
[37:29] seed to be begin to identify so
[37:32] personally with this I'm just going to
[37:34] use a couple statements maybe a few come
[37:36] back to this thing to this uh this
[37:38] thought process at the end but in the
[37:40] message faith brother Ram says now we're
[37:42] speaking tonight upon faith and I
[37:44] thought it would be nice maybe if we
[37:46] could use this great character of
[37:48] Abraham for an example of Faith because
[37:50] it was to Abraham the promise was given
[37:53] and you are Abraham's seed and airs
[37:55] according to the promise
[37:58] so if you're heirs to the same promise
[38:00] wow let's look at Abraham right because
[38:03] we're Heirs of the same promise and the
[38:05] promise was given to him and we're hirs
[38:08] to the same promise and he's the example
[38:10] of Faith so there's a there's something
[38:12] that's being Express this faith is being
[38:14] revealed in Abraham says and we'll kind
[38:16] of review the life of Abraham just a
[38:18] little because he was an outstanding
[38:21] character now let's look at how how what
[38:23] made him outstanding and he was a man
[38:26] who believed God
[38:28] and now he had no great background to
[38:31] believe God because it's commonly
[38:33] believed that he was from a family of
[38:35] idolators he came down from Babylon his
[38:37] family dwelt in the land of Cala the
[38:39] city of er The Valleys of shinar and was
[38:41] just an ordinary man he wasn't an angel
[38:45] he was just a man like you and I we
[38:48] begin to think about Abram when he's
[38:50] called this Abraham the father Abraham
[38:52] the father of our faith and we be
[38:54] Abraham's seed this Legend This luminary
[38:57] this one that seems to be so large in
[38:59] our minds about faith and perfect faith
[39:01] and rapturing faith and supreme Faith he
[39:04] was just a man like you and I he says an
[39:07] ordinary man and what made him
[39:10] outstanding was he's a man that believed
[39:13] God not just one that believed in a God
[39:16] or believed in a deity but there's
[39:17] something very real about the faith of
[39:19] Abraham in the message Jehovah Gyra and
[39:21] again you'll find dozens of instances
[39:23] where brother bam calls Abraham an
[39:24] ordinary man an ordinary man an ordinary
[39:26] man but let's really think about that
[39:30] when he says he's an ordinary man
[39:32] Abraham was just an ordinary man he
[39:35] wasn't any different from any of us just
[39:38] the same now you want to know how
[39:40] particular this is we think well Abraham
[39:43] was a Jew well no he wasn't there were
[39:46] no Jews
[39:47] yet you say well he's a Hebrew but
[39:49] really in a spiritual sense because he's
[39:50] one that had crossed over he's just
[39:52] another Gentile another one of Nations
[39:55] and tongues that had populated the whole
[39:57] Earth that had come over from the
[39:59] descendants of ham sham and japeth and
[40:00] here he is and they can trace this
[40:02] lineage back uh uh as we do in the Bible
[40:05] but really at that point when you look
[40:06] at all the lineages of all the people
[40:08] and all the families on the face of the
[40:10] Earth there's not anything that sticks
[40:12] out about Abrams over anyone
[40:14] else's but yet God chose that God chose
[40:18] to narrow it down by Genesis CH 11 to
[40:20] one man Abram and he says he's just the
[40:23] same as us people today and this is
[40:25] where I chose this statement because he
[40:27] begins to identify he he's amplifying
[40:30] what he means by he's an ordinary man
[40:32] he's just the same as you and I because
[40:34] you don't want to make him out to be
[40:35] such a particular peculiar great uh
[40:38] gifted and talented and unique person to
[40:41] where we don't ever feel like we can
[40:42] identify with
[40:43] him and and as this has impacted me
[40:47] while I've been studying this I thought
[40:48] we have a very difficult time relating
[40:50] Jesus to Jesus
[40:52] Christ and and it's often we try to this
[40:55] disconnect between Jesus Christ and
[40:56] ourselves I mean it's it's by the fact
[40:59] that he's born of a virgin he knew no
[41:01] sin he's the son of God he didn't bypass
[41:04] his theophany he speaks face to face to
[41:06] God he never did no sin and we look at
[41:08] this example of Jesus Christ and we're
[41:09] like well I struck out at
[41:12] Birth right the the very fact that I was
[41:15] born of a woman I can never be Jesus
[41:19] Christ but yet somehow we are asked to
[41:21] be perfect as our Heavenly Father which
[41:23] is in heaven is perfect and we're asked
[41:24] to be Christlike and and we want to come
[41:27] into the image of Christ and the image
[41:29] of Christ is being molded in us and
[41:31] there's this disconnect between being
[41:32] Christ being like Christ that that the
[41:35] connection is made through the new birth
[41:37] and through our justification but that's
[41:40] if we just say this that's a that's a
[41:42] challenge in itself but now when we
[41:44] begin to look at Abraham we can begin to
[41:46] say now now that this is what I want you
[41:48] to be able to do now that I can do
[41:51] that I can believe God I can do that and
[41:56] it was through that faith that Christ
[41:59] came so you're never going to be Christ
[42:03] until you can believe like Abraham and
[42:06] through that Faith Christ will
[42:08] come and so we're making Abraham
[42:12] human so that our faith can become
[42:16] superhuman we're making a we're looking
[42:18] at the life of Abraham so we realize so
[42:20] you mean you're telling me that I don't
[42:22] act actually have to create squirrels to
[42:24] go on the
[42:25] Rapture I don't have to speak in tongues
[42:28] to know I got the Holy Ghost I don't
[42:30] have to do all these it's this isn't the
[42:32] way that it's going to be and this isn't
[42:33] what adoption is about and this isn't Oh
[42:35] you mean I just have to do what Abraham
[42:37] did because once we start looking at
[42:38] Abraham believed God and just followed
[42:41] in the routine of trusting God and
[42:43] that's the life that I have to
[42:47] live because he says people today when
[42:49] they see God put a gift in the
[42:51] church some people tries to stand that
[42:53] person up as some great big outstanding
[42:56] something well that's wrong wrong
[42:58] couldn't we say the same thing about
[42:59] brother
[43:01] brandham he says you got your mind on
[43:03] the person then instead of on the Christ
[43:06] we are all just the
[43:08] same the Bible said that Elijah was a
[43:11] man subject to like passions as we are
[43:13] he just had the same ups and downs that
[43:16] we
[43:17] have think about Abraham we're Abraham's
[43:20] just like us he has ups and
[43:22] downs not he says now my people formerly
[43:25] are Catholic you all know that and
[43:27] they're great on holy man holy
[43:31] man that runs in the family saying but
[43:35] to me it's not holy man it's holy God
[43:39] that's right it's God is the object We
[43:41] Are Men all the same brother Brandon
[43:45] went to Great Links to try to challenge
[43:46] us not to make the mistake even about
[43:48] him the prophet the one who fulfilled
[43:50] these scriptures of Malachi 4 and even
[43:52] the angel of Revelations 10:7 and the
[43:54] angel to leod deia that he was a man
[43:56] like like we were and you realize it's
[43:59] people that try to go they try to put a
[44:00] man on a pedestal and make him a holy
[44:02] man and this is what the Catholic Church
[44:04] did Jesus Christ was not only born of
[44:06] Immaculate Conception but so was
[44:09] Mary because they get so far and to try
[44:11] to make they get so caught up in this
[44:13] holy man this holy man ideology to where
[44:15] oh brother brandham has the same kind of
[44:17] Mythology regarding his birth and even
[44:19] his children have this mythology
[44:21] regarding their births why because they
[44:22] want to make it about the man and not
[44:24] about Christ and so when we look at AB
[44:27] Abraham we're not making it about
[44:28] Abraham we're making about the God that
[44:31] Abraham supremely
[44:34] trusted we all have the same ups and
[44:38] downs he says God is the object we We're
[44:41] Men all the same but Abraham was just an
[44:43] ordinary man came down from Babylon and
[44:47] he dwelt there in the land of Shar and
[44:48] perhaps his diet was go in of the
[44:50] morning and pick some berries from the
[44:52] bushes and go back out and kill an
[44:54] animal and have his noon Day meal and
[44:56] some more berries for supper and so
[44:58] forth must have been during the spring
[45:00] or summer or the when the weather's good
[45:04] but here's he's saying this is his
[45:06] life let's find out about Abraham what
[45:08] kind of man he was he fast he got up and
[45:11] prayed six hours to start his day fasted
[45:16] for another six hours ate a cracker and
[45:19] drank some water because he was
[45:21] spiritually in tuned to God and didn't
[45:23] want anything to get in the way of his
[45:25] connectedness to the father this deity
[45:28] that speaks to
[45:29] him it's probably because he lived a
[45:32] life that was just the normal everyday
[45:34] life getting up in the morning having
[45:37] breakfast hunting his next meal eating
[45:39] dinner going to bed just this regular
[45:42] routine that God could come and visit
[45:44] him and speak to
[45:46] him wasn't trying to make himself
[45:49] different you know he wasn't the shaman
[45:52] of er always claiming that God spoke to
[45:55] him and always claiming this and always
[45:57] having claims on that he say he's saying
[45:59] this is Abraham he's just just an
[46:01] ordinary man living an ordinary life
[46:04] going about doing ordinary things every
[46:06] day and while Abraham being just an
[46:08] ordinary man God chose Abraham by
[46:11] election just by living an ordinary life
[46:14] doing ordinary things it's being an
[46:16] ordinary man that God met him in the
[46:18] extraordinary it's just living an
[46:20] ordinary life where a natural day turned
[46:22] into something very Supernatural and
[46:24] what did it nothing's magical about the
[46:29] berries they didn't cause a
[46:30] hallucination he didn't get some meat
[46:32] that was a little bit too gy God just
[46:35] chose him by
[46:37] election he didn't get into some kind of
[46:39] Saki or some kind of barri or something
[46:41] that could cause him to hallucinate and
[46:43] he's having this wild dream in his
[46:44] teepee no God chose him by
[46:49] election not because he was different
[46:51] from any other man but it was cuz that
[46:54] God's election has to stand sure
[46:58] I hope you can identify more easily with
[46:59] Abraham today than you ever have before
[47:02] just an ordinary man going about doing
[47:04] ordinary
[47:06] things and you know why Abraham's Legacy
[47:08] endures
[47:10] today the reason why Abraham's Legacy
[47:13] endures to this moment is because God
[47:16] manifested himself to
[47:18] him we don't have we don't know any I me
[47:21] from the moment that it gets to Abram
[47:23] really everyone else is
[47:25] lost to the story Into The Narrative
[47:28] unless a Seed of Abraham crosses paths
[47:30] with
[47:31] him I mean just think about the rest of
[47:33] the Bible the rest of the Bible it it
[47:36] doesn't have like this cutscene to North
[47:38] America and says meanwhile the great
[47:40] great great great great great great
[47:41] great great grandfather Sitting Bull is
[47:44] is you know settling in Lakota for the
[47:46] first time ever and just kind of gives
[47:48] us this cut scene so we can see what's
[47:49] happening on the other side of the Earth
[47:51] the only way we'd ever hear about
[47:52] Sitting Bull's uh family is if one of
[47:55] them came across Paul
[47:57] or one of them came across the king
[47:59] whose name starts with a
[48:01] J right that's the only way it would
[48:04] have happened it has to have something
[48:06] to do with Abraham's family if they're
[48:08] going to make it into the
[48:10] story so what was it what makes Abraham
[48:13] so extraordinary God manifest himself to
[48:16] him and this is the sign the
[48:18] significance of the life of Abraham is
[48:20] singular this is a very simple thing I'm
[48:22] just trying to drive home this morning
[48:24] what made his life so significant is
[48:27] faith in one
[48:28] God faith in the one true God faith in
[48:32] the god of creation that the very God
[48:35] who spoke worlds into existence came and
[48:38] then spoke to one man Abram and made
[48:40] himself known to him the world is
[48:43] worshiping deities the world is
[48:44] believing God the world at one time
[48:46] built a tower to try to avoid the
[48:47] judgments of God but yet now Abraham has
[48:49] this claim and what makes Abraham
[48:52] significant it's very very singular this
[48:54] is what we have to identify in this
[48:56] faith of Abraham its Genesis was Abraham
[48:59] believed in God and the God that he
[49:02] believed in was the god of creation the
[49:04] god of Eternity the one true God the
[49:07] singular God not three Gods Not the
[49:10] multiplicity of Gods Not gods in
[49:11] creation but the god of
[49:14] creation it was true faith in the one
[49:17] true
[49:19] God the Bible says in Genesis 12:4 and
[49:22] so Abraham
[49:24] departed God spoke to him
[49:27] an ordinary man just living an ordinary
[49:29] life eating berries in the morning
[49:32] having a meat for lunch berries in the
[49:34] evening going to do the same thing the
[49:36] next
[49:38] day and God speaks to
[49:42] him it says so Abram departed as the
[49:46] Lord had spoken unto
[49:49] him he's believing in this
[49:52] Lord it says lot went with him and Abram
[49:54] was 70 and 5 years old when he Departed
[49:56] out of
[49:58] herent he departed as the Lord had spoke
[50:00] to
[50:03] him I want us to think here it's
[50:08] 11:17 and
[50:10] I i' I've just come to the spot I really
[50:13] want to focus on laser focus on now for
[50:15] a moment and I'm wanting you to in your
[50:16] hearts just search your
[50:18] hearts because the significance of the
[50:21] circumstances in these
[50:23] verses cannot be overstated
[50:26] really
[50:28] can't because if if the importance of
[50:30] Revelation to the True Believer can
[50:31] never be
[50:32] overemphasized then really what we're
[50:34] talking about is the revelation of God
[50:37] personally to
[50:39] Abraham and in such quiet Simplicity
[50:42] when we look at these scriptures if we
[50:44] start with Genesis chap 11 these are the
[50:46] generations of Tara and we see how that
[50:48] he has a son named Abram and Abram Mar
[50:50] Sarah his half sister and then we see
[50:53] this we see these these things unfold a
[50:57] and we see these
[50:59] um the the his his life unfold it's just
[51:02] in this quiet
[51:06] Simplicity that an obedient
[51:09] Faith unfolds that influences all
[51:14] Humanity we mentioned it Wednesday night
[51:16] 60% of the world believes that Abraham
[51:18] is the father of their faith 60% of the
[51:21] world over 4 billion people saying our
[51:24] Father Abraham and I know that's
[51:26] Christian and Muslims for the most part
[51:28] but they believe they're going back to
[51:30] this one guy that lot maybe the rest of
[51:32] the world you know 40% of the world
[51:33] thinks is mythology doesn't even think
[51:35] is
[51:36] real but this is how large this
[51:38] character is and when we go back and
[51:40] look at his life and it's preserved for
[51:42] us that we believe by faith these
[51:44] elements are preserved for our faith
[51:46] it's in such quiet
[51:48] Simplicity that obedient faith is being
[51:52] expressed look at this look read the
[51:55] story you read in Genesis chapter 11 you
[51:58] read it in chapter 12 you even read it
[51:59] in Chapter 13 and maybe when you get to
[52:02] 14 maybe there's finally some kind of
[52:04] significant clamor that may speak to how
[52:06] great Abraham was but there's no
[52:09] outstanding events in his
[52:11] life that would make him this Mighty
[52:13] Hunter this great General this
[52:15] tremendous
[52:16] leader there's no events of War there's
[52:18] no disclosure of some kind of wealth
[52:20] that make him stand out doesn't say that
[52:23] he was the mightiest hunter in the land
[52:24] it doesn't say that he was the
[52:26] wealthiest man in the land there's no no
[52:28] land that he lived in that seemed to
[52:30] have any particular significance where
[52:32] he's of a particular Kingdom there's no
[52:34] armies there's no laws associated with
[52:36] him there's no science that he
[52:38] discovered there's no Arts that he did
[52:39] there's nothing else associated with his
[52:42] name think even now if we go back and we
[52:45] say now how are we going to Let's
[52:46] identify what Abra made Abraham great
[52:48] it's not his armies it's not his
[52:50] contributions to science it's not his
[52:53] contributions to the Arts they can't
[52:54] even find artifacts of his of him and
[52:57] himself everything about Abraham there's
[53:00] nothing else ass associated with his
[53:02] name except one thing faith in
[53:07] God Abraham's life is wrapped up in one
[53:10] thing that God had personally revealed
[53:13] himself to Abraham and he
[53:16] obeyed at the end of the day that's all
[53:18] that this can come down to this is all
[53:20] that we can look at in the beginning say
[53:22] well it wasn't because Abraham had a
[53:24] strategic was in a very strategic
[53:26] location
[53:27] that was important to a lot of other
[53:28] nations and so he had to bolster his
[53:30] armies and he had to fortify himself
[53:32] against Invaders because he had the most
[53:34] fertile land and because he had this or
[53:36] because his family was that there's not
[53:38] an accumulation of wealth there's not an
[53:39] accumulation of armies there's not an
[53:41] accumulation of any kind of events or or
[53:44] accomplishments that make Abraham stand
[53:46] out when the Bible says God called Abram
[53:49] he's an ordinary Man without any
[53:51] extraordinary
[53:52] accomplishments and what made him
[53:54] special is God's election
[53:57] I hope you can identify with Abraham a
[53:59] little bit more easily
[54:01] today and Abraham as it says as the Lord
[54:03] had spoke to him he departed and went
[54:06] out he journeyed towards Canaan in
[54:08] obedience to the
[54:10] word and faith in the
[54:13] promise and I come across this it's a
[54:16] lengthy statement from a commentary I
[54:19] was reading last week and I'm just going
[54:20] to go ahead and read it to you because
[54:22] it just is written so beautifully and It
[54:24] quotes Genesis 121 get thee out of thy
[54:27] country and from thy Kindred and from
[54:29] thy Father's House un a land that I will
[54:32] show thee this was God's first
[54:35] revelation of himself to
[54:37] Abraham up to this time Abraham to all
[54:40] appearance had no knowledge of any God
[54:43] but the deities worship by his father in
[54:46] Cala now he finds within himself
[54:49] impulses which he cannot resist in which
[54:52] he is conscious he ought not to resist
[54:54] he believes it to be his duty to adopt a
[54:57] course which may look foolish in which
[55:00] he can recogn and and which he can
[55:02] justify only by saying that his
[55:05] conscience bids
[55:07] him are you are you hearing the way that
[55:10] this writer is able to summarize the
[55:12] faith of Abraham I think it's so
[55:13] important for us to recognize this
[55:15] element of the faith of Abraham
[55:17] especially in a time when the whole
[55:18] world is trying to build a case that
[55:20] you're
[55:21] crazy and trying to undermine your faith
[55:24] and listen if you have the faith of
[55:26] Abraham strip everything away prove that
[55:29] the King James Bible was written by
[55:31] Shakespeare prove that this happened
[55:33] prove that that happened and at the end
[55:35] of the day you say you know what I know
[55:36] what it's like to be like Abraham
[55:38] because I'm driven by an Impulse on the
[55:41] inside of me to believe a voice that's
[55:43] speaking to
[55:46] me he finds within himself impulses
[55:49] which he cannot resist and which he is
[55:52] conscious he ought not to resist he
[55:55] believes it is to be his duty to adopt a
[55:57] course which may look foolish and which
[55:59] he can justify only by saying that his
[56:02] conscience bids him he recognizes
[56:04] apparently for the first time that
[56:07] through his conscience there speaks to
[56:09] him a God who is
[56:12] supreme in dependence on this God he
[56:16] gathered his possessions together and
[56:20] departed could you just imagine what it
[56:22] would look like that day when he
[56:24] packed could you imagine what the
[56:26] conversations may have been like with
[56:27] this
[56:29] family dad God spoke to me was dad's
[56:32] like which
[56:35] one what did he
[56:37] say are you going to have to sacrifice a
[56:40] son and you don't have one so you want
[56:41] to borrow one of mine what you know what
[56:43] what do you need no God spoke to me and
[56:45] told me to leave this country and to
[56:48] travel and he's and he's and he has this
[56:51] conviction and Dad I I have to follow
[56:54] him I I I'm convinced
[56:56] and he's packing up his possessions and
[56:58] his whole family is getting to leave the
[57:00] land of their Nativity the place that
[57:02] they were born the place where they had
[57:03] their identity even a place of Sorrow
[57:06] even as a son who had died H uh his
[57:08] brother had died there terara his
[57:10] father's son heran had died Tara his son
[57:12] heran had died and now he's packing
[57:14] together all his possessions and he's
[57:16] departing why because God spoke to him
[57:21] and told him to do
[57:23] it faith in the word moved Abraham
[57:27] not family think about this the faith of
[57:30] Abraham we being Abraham's seed this is
[57:32] what moves and motivates Abraham not
[57:35] family not wealth not
[57:37] curiosity he wasn't like the first
[57:39] Columbus let's go find out what's on the
[57:41] other side let's just travel let's
[57:43] explore and it wasn't the sense of
[57:45] expiration it wasn't the sense of
[57:46] adventure it wasn't his family it wasn't
[57:48] wealth it wasn't curiosity it wasn't
[57:50] fame or popularity wasn't invited to go
[57:53] do something and be a part of something
[57:54] there wasn't this you know some came by
[57:56] with a telegram and said there's gold in
[57:57] them Hills and he left chasing after
[58:00] gold in the hills of Canaan no there it
[58:01] was nothing like that for
[58:04] Abraham for Abraham when we read Genesis
[58:07] 12:4 so Abram departed it was the first
[58:10] step in a lifelong adherence to that
[58:12] spiritual Supreme that had spoke to him
[58:15] first step and him obeying this supreme
[58:20] de God a God who is
[58:24] supreme that in his as this writer says
[58:26] it's his conscience but it's something
[58:28] in his faith deep inside of him it's the
[58:31] F the first time when it says he
[58:33] departed he's now stepping out in a life
[58:35] that would be characterized as obeying
[58:39] this one who is
[58:41] supreme Abram is not moved by
[58:44] famine Abram is not moved by War he's
[58:47] not moved by politics he's not moved by
[58:49] pretense he's not moved by popularity
[58:51] he's not moved by personality all these
[58:53] different things that cause Abraham to
[58:54] move are not any of these natural things
[58:57] but he's under the influence get this
[58:59] the influence of an unseen
[59:02] God he wasn't following a star he wasn't
[59:06] traveling the circuit of a comet he was
[59:08] not chasing the Horizon of a Setting Sun
[59:11] he is now being moved and influenced by
[59:13] an unseen God to even make this even
[59:15] more outstanding to you he's in the
[59:17] middle of idol
[59:19] worshippers he's surrounded by family
[59:21] that worship idols who are bowing
[59:24] themselves to Idols that can be
[59:27] seen and they all bow before an image
[59:29] that can be seen they worship a moon
[59:31] that hangs in the sky they worship a sun
[59:33] that travels the circuit they're all
[59:35] worshiping things visible and tangible
[59:37] and they're all bowing before things
[59:39] that can be seen and then Abram bows his
[59:42] face to the Earth to a god that cannot
[59:45] be
[59:46] seen and think of how extraordinary that
[59:48] must have been in the midst of idolators
[59:50] ruled by the Flesh in the lust of the
[59:53] Flesh and the pride of life and all
[59:55] these things that would have been
[59:56] tangible and everything that so draws
[59:58] people today in the time that we're
[59:59] living that Abram had absolute zero
[1:00:02] shame in worshiping a God that was
[1:00:08] invisible his family is idolators in a
[1:00:10] Land of
[1:00:12] idolatry but it's from that pedigree
[1:00:14] that God elects
[1:00:17] Abraham and Abraham chooses to worship a
[1:00:20] God who cannot be
[1:00:21] seen a God that cannot be set up with
[1:00:24] hands a God that cannot be described as
[1:00:26] it travels the Circuit of the Sun or the
[1:00:29] path of the moon or is found in the
[1:00:32] stars or some image that man would see
[1:00:34] as they connect the dots and the sky he
[1:00:36] worshiped an unseen God that's the faith
[1:00:39] of
[1:00:40] Abraham that's the Gentile
[1:00:45] faith when we think about Abraham he did
[1:00:47] not step from the Breath of
[1:00:49] God it's in this way that we think about
[1:00:52] Adam and how Adam we relate to Adam and
[1:00:54] in Adam all die and there's this
[1:00:56] this this concept of of trying to
[1:00:59] associate ourselves with these
[1:01:00] conditions that exist in the in the
[1:01:01] beginning in
[1:01:04] Adam but Adam he came direct from
[1:01:09] God Abraham did not step forth from the
[1:01:12] hand of God or the Breath of
[1:01:14] God he wasn't even the first he's he's
[1:01:17] not even a cane or an Abel that could
[1:01:19] say well I was the first one born of a
[1:01:21] woman or have some sort of early adopter
[1:01:23] status or something he's he's chosen out
[1:01:25] of of all Humanity on the face of the
[1:01:27] Earth this is the Genesis this is the
[1:01:30] origin of calling Abraham is he's picked
[1:01:32] out of all the massive humanity and
[1:01:34] while everyone else is worshiping gods
[1:01:36] and erecting idols and in altars to
[1:01:38] worship gods that can be seen and can be
[1:01:42] justified he begins to worship a God
[1:01:45] that's
[1:01:45] invisible but a God that can justify
[1:01:51] him and I'm wanting to close but just
[1:01:54] share a few things in closing to kind of
[1:01:55] set up for the next
[1:01:57] part this is a statement that I is
[1:01:59] becoming just
[1:02:01] more profound to me and the Masterpiece
[1:02:03] brother brandham is talking
[1:02:05] about in in this portion of reading uh
[1:02:09] brother brandham is talking about how
[1:02:10] the
[1:02:11] bride is another Masterpiece in the
[1:02:14] making says she's the New Testament
[1:02:16] that's all like oh okay that's all woo
[1:02:18] you know if that's that's all that's the
[1:02:21] one I want right That's all folks that's
[1:02:22] the one I want right there the New
[1:02:24] Testament said another Masterpiece in
[1:02:26] the making Christ was the Old Testament
[1:02:28] the bride's the New Testament and he
[1:02:30] said it taken uh that old it took all
[1:02:33] these things to come to this climax in
[1:02:35] Christ same thing happened through the
[1:02:36] church ages climax in the bride he's
[1:02:38] showing that parallel but he makes this
[1:02:40] statement and he's he begins with
[1:02:42] Abraham in talking about Christ he says
[1:02:44] now he's doing the same thing in his
[1:02:46] never changing
[1:02:47] method so then the method that he begins
[1:02:51] to develop in Abraham is
[1:02:52] remarkable he says we find out in
[1:02:54] Malachi 3 he said I'm God and I change
[1:02:56] not he cannot change his method now as
[1:02:59] he started in Abraham after the fall of
[1:03:03] the first Masterpiece he started in
[1:03:06] Abraham on a foundation to build another
[1:03:10] Masterpiece that's the part I want you
[1:03:11] to ponder on that's the part I want you
[1:03:13] to think about a little bit maybe as
[1:03:14] your homework assignment going forward
[1:03:16] just in your own personal devotion or
[1:03:18] prayer he says that Abraham was the
[1:03:20] foundation of another
[1:03:22] Masterpiece that when the first
[1:03:24] Masterpiece fell in the beginning and
[1:03:27] that there's a prophecy of a redeemer
[1:03:29] there's a prophecy in Genesis 3:15 of a
[1:03:31] seed of the woman that was to come and
[1:03:34] that's the our first inking that there's
[1:03:35] going to be Redemption we don't have the
[1:03:38] mat we don't have another uh brick in
[1:03:41] the foundation another seed swn of that
[1:03:43] until God says Abram get out of your
[1:03:47] country and he says that's where God
[1:03:50] begins to build another
[1:03:52] Masterpiece Abraham is the seed of
[1:03:55] another Masterpiece he's the foundation
[1:03:58] of another Masterpiece he holds within
[1:03:59] him the framework the outline the DNA
[1:04:02] The Germ of another
[1:04:04] Masterpiece he says he started on the
[1:04:06] day of Pentecost to build another
[1:04:08] Masterpiece The Original Seed word
[1:04:10] started in the first church what was it
[1:04:12] now these this is a term I'm not so much
[1:04:14] focusing on what began in the New
[1:04:15] Testament but going back to Abraham and
[1:04:17] what he represents the seed word the
[1:04:20] word manifested the promise that had
[1:04:22] been
[1:04:23] given God had given Abra a promise it
[1:04:26] says that we are the seeds of Abraham
[1:04:28] and hes according to the promise Abraham
[1:04:31] is the one that received the promise so
[1:04:34] Abraham's promise what did what was he
[1:04:36] he's the foundation of God building
[1:04:39] another Masterpiece so that's the seed
[1:04:41] that God SW that one day produced the
[1:04:44] Masterpiece Christ so Abraham's promise
[1:04:47] culminated in a masterpiece Jesus
[1:04:51] Christ so then what are you another
[1:04:53] culmination
[1:04:56] Abraham's Faith culminated climaxed in
[1:04:59] the the the physical representation of
[1:05:02] the Messiah the very manifestation of
[1:05:04] Jesus Christ and the faith of Abraham is
[1:05:06] going to Climax and culminate in the
[1:05:08] body of Christ in the very visible
[1:05:10] manifestation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:05:13] flesh of his
[1:05:15] bride it's the same
[1:05:18] seed
[1:05:20] Abraham was the foundation of another
[1:05:23] masterpiece
[1:05:25] in Matthew chapter 1:1 notice this
[1:05:28] phrasing the book of the generation of
[1:05:30] Jesus Christ the son of David the son of
[1:05:37] Abraham now to a Jew you know that would
[1:05:40] maybe invite an
[1:05:41] argument as they believe in Abraham they
[1:05:43] believe in David they believe in that
[1:05:44] line of that
[1:05:45] lineage but think of us as Christians
[1:05:48] then the Messiah the book of the
[1:05:52] generation of the Messiah the Son of
[1:05:56] David which is the common reference and
[1:05:59] refrain that would be used of the
[1:06:00] Messiah who would have been the son of
[1:06:01] David but then it says the son of
[1:06:04] Abraham the son of David evokes these
[1:06:07] images of the king and the
[1:06:10] kingdom here's the son of David the king
[1:06:12] the Messiah this great glorious one the
[1:06:15] Messiah the one that's going to rule and
[1:06:16] Reign and restore the kingdom and has
[1:06:18] such a royal identity to it this great
[1:06:21] figure of the King David and his family
[1:06:24] and the lineage son of David the King
[1:06:25] even as we'd say the son of David it's
[1:06:27] Christ ruling and reign in the
[1:06:28] Millennium but then it says the son of
[1:06:31] Abraham he was a son of a man even
[1:06:34] representing the son of man that it's
[1:06:36] not he is the root he he is identified
[1:06:39] with with humanity and it's Abraham he
[1:06:42] was the root and the
[1:06:43] foundation of all of Israel the root and
[1:06:46] the foundation he had the Messiah had to
[1:06:49] be traced back not just to David but he
[1:06:52] had to go all the way back to one man
[1:06:54] Abraham
[1:06:57] the book of the generation of Jesus
[1:06:58] Christ the son of
[1:07:01] Abraham to identify Christ with Humanity
[1:07:04] the Messiah with this son of man with
[1:07:07] Abraham as we read before if ye be
[1:07:10] Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and HS
[1:07:13] according to the
[1:07:16] promise the seed is the
[1:07:19] grain that holds the germ of future
[1:07:22] plants
[1:07:25] when you think about a seed that's sewn
[1:07:28] all the other seeds that come from that
[1:07:30] seed you plant you plant a fruit seed or
[1:07:33] you plant a seed in the a seed in the
[1:07:36] ground and you get a Vine full of uh
[1:07:39] fruit all containing all these other
[1:07:42] seeds was all in that Original
[1:07:44] Seed right there in that seed and it
[1:07:47] produces many other fruits has many
[1:07:48] other seeds but all of that had to be in
[1:07:51] the seed to begin with you are Abraham's
[1:07:54] seed
[1:07:56] it's the grain within which The Germ of
[1:07:59] all future plants is
[1:08:01] contained to be the seed it's something
[1:08:03] reserved as The Germ of a new
[1:08:06] race you are Abraham's seed you are
[1:08:08] being identified with something
[1:08:11] particular but yet something so
[1:08:14] ordinary brother Bram says in the
[1:08:16] message modern events are made clear by
[1:08:18] prophecy we are supposed to be the Royal
[1:08:19] Seed of Abraham Isaac he goes the Royal
[1:08:22] Seed of Abraham Isaac was the natural
[1:08:24] seed we are supposed to be the Royal
[1:08:26] seed but the faith seed not the natural
[1:08:29] seed now the faith seed the faith in the
[1:08:31] promised word the promised word he says
[1:08:33] don't miss it was that Royal seed that
[1:08:37] was the seed Abraham's faith we been
[1:08:40] dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed HS
[1:08:43] with him according to the
[1:08:45] promise so I I just feel like I'm
[1:08:48] looking at something I can't even
[1:08:49] describe because he says Abraham was the
[1:08:52] first he started in Abraham to build
[1:08:55] another their Masterpiece Abraham's the
[1:08:57] seed that sown Christ is the fruit of
[1:09:01] that seed to think that God's revelation
[1:09:04] of himself to Abraham was a seed swn
[1:09:07] into Abraham in one day it brought forth
[1:09:09] Jesus
[1:09:11] Christ the revelation of God to Abraham
[1:09:14] one day brought forth the perfect Son of
[1:09:17] God the Messiah if he can do it in
[1:09:19] Abraham he can do it in
[1:09:22] you if he can do it in Abraham he can do
[1:09:25] do it in
[1:09:28] you the seed holds the mystery of the
[1:09:32] plant Abraham held the mystery of
[1:09:36] Christ then in the life of Abraham it
[1:09:38] holds the mystery and Foundation of
[1:09:40] simple
[1:09:41] faith it holds the mystery and
[1:09:43] Foundation of how God is going to
[1:09:45] translate you and how your faith as a
[1:09:48] believer in The Invisible God is going
[1:09:50] to keep you every day of your ordinary
[1:09:53] life to one day meet the Lord in the
[1:09:56] air musicians if you'd
[1:10:00] come the faith
[1:10:03] seed that was the
[1:10:06] seed Abraham's
[1:10:10] Faith he
[1:10:11] believed and received
[1:10:19] Christ if we see Jesus Christ as the
[1:10:21] Living Word that makes God
[1:10:24] present that's what what Abraham
[1:10:27] received and it was a seed in
[1:10:30] him and one day the son of Abraham the
[1:10:35] son of David came forth in the flesh
[1:10:36] Jesus Christ and it was the another
[1:10:41] Masterpiece and so God's just not taking
[1:10:43] another seed right not just going to
[1:10:47] take another seed somewhere it's got to
[1:10:48] be the same
[1:10:50] seed well this is where I want you to
[1:10:52] start thinking about the the simple life
[1:10:53] of Abraham and how it portrays the plan
[1:10:55] of God the Myster of Redemption all
[1:10:56] these things when it came time to find a
[1:10:58] wife for Abraham's son he's like go back
[1:11:01] to my
[1:11:02] family because it mattered to him
[1:11:05] because the wife of the first
[1:11:07] Masterpiece was not just going to be
[1:11:08] some other manufactured
[1:11:11] adopted orphan out there some kind of
[1:11:15] hybrid some kind of Clone made to look
[1:11:17] like but it was going to be the same
[1:11:18] seat of
[1:11:20] Abraham in the message from that time he
[1:11:23] says let's take for instance Abraham
[1:11:26] he was just an ordinary
[1:11:28] man he come down from Babylon with his
[1:11:30] father and he dwelt in the land of the
[1:11:32] calans the city of Earth probably a
[1:11:35] farmer an ordinary man like to eat
[1:11:39] berries for breakfast and berries for
[1:11:40] dinner right go out and kill lunch just
[1:11:43] ordinary man he was no special
[1:11:46] man he was just a
[1:11:48] man and he found Grace in the sight of
[1:11:52] God God told him when he was 75 years
[1:11:54] old that that he was going to make him
[1:11:56] to be a father of
[1:11:58] Nations he's going to give him a child
[1:12:01] by his wife Sarah of course we know this
[1:12:02] Revelation unfolds who was 65 years old
[1:12:05] at that
[1:12:06] time and Abraham believed
[1:12:09] God how was it reckoned to him how how
[1:12:12] how was it he became Abraham the
[1:12:13] righteous how is it he became the father
[1:12:15] of Faith how is it because he believed
[1:12:17] God and it was imputed unto him for
[1:12:20] righteousness so as you look at Supreme
[1:12:22] Faith revealed in Abraham just an
[1:12:25] ordinary
[1:12:26] man not not special just a
[1:12:30] man probably a
[1:12:32] farmer so he himself is a farmer hunted
[1:12:36] his own
[1:12:37] food simple
[1:12:39] man but it's this this ordinary man with
[1:12:43] an ordinary
[1:12:46] trade surrounded by Idol
[1:12:49] worshippers and he believes God he finds
[1:12:53] Grace in the sight of God
[1:12:56] this would be this is the this this is
[1:12:58] the thought I want to present before you
[1:13:00] maybe the prayer that we would offer
[1:13:01] over you or the Paradigm that we would
[1:13:04] step into this is the vision this is the
[1:13:06] plan this is what God is doing in my
[1:13:07] life this is the what God is doing in
[1:13:09] your life may God bring forth this
[1:13:12] glorious mystery in
[1:13:14] [Music]
[1:13:16] US ordinary
[1:13:18] people living ordinary lives doing
[1:13:22] ordinary things but we find Grace in the
[1:13:24] sight of of
[1:13:26] God yeah none of us should be challenged
[1:13:29] when we leave here today to try to
[1:13:30] figure out some profession some
[1:13:32] education some work some deed something
[1:13:34] we can do so we can stand out something
[1:13:36] we can do to prove that we're Abraham's
[1:13:38] deed something we can do to prove that
[1:13:39] we're a child of God something we could
[1:13:40] do to prove that we have faith believe
[1:13:42] God take him at his
[1:13:43] word keep living an ordinary life as a
[1:13:46] student as a daughter as a son as a wife
[1:13:49] as a husband as a mother as a father as
[1:13:52] a help as whatever it may be whatever
[1:13:53] your life has called you to do just keep
[1:13:55] doing what you're asked to do following
[1:13:57] the regular routine of scriptures and
[1:13:59] may it be from this ordinary person
[1:14:01] living an ordinary life that this
[1:14:03] glorious Mystery Begins to unfold in me
[1:14:05] and may the supernatural unfold in the
[1:14:08] Simplicity of my daily life just going
[1:14:11] about doing ordinary
[1:14:14] things maybe it's just
[1:14:17] farming I preached a series of services
[1:14:19] one time called farmers in the Rapture
[1:14:22] and I it wasn't necessarily a cheap
[1:14:23] trick just to get somebody said click on
[1:14:24] that in the world does that
[1:14:26] mean but it's it's the idea
[1:14:31] is
[1:14:32] that our way to a body
[1:14:35] change is living life the right
[1:14:40] way doing the things of Christ in the
[1:14:42] nature and spirit of Christ and doing
[1:14:44] the things of Christ in the nature and
[1:14:46] spirit of Christ aren't always the
[1:14:47] things that we think of in terms of oh I
[1:14:49] wish somebody Could Touch the Hem of my
[1:14:50] pants and be healed or oh if someone
[1:14:52] could just my shadow cross over them and
[1:14:55] and they be made well and we sometimes
[1:14:56] think of these Miracles that are sign
[1:14:58] catchers as a way that's going to trans
[1:15:01] translate our faith listen those signs
[1:15:04] that we see that get our attention is
[1:15:07] what brought us into faith in
[1:15:10] God and then it's that faith in God that
[1:15:13] begins to mature and grow but it's the
[1:15:15] ordinary it's it was an ordinary living
[1:15:18] ordinary life that's cultivating this
[1:15:20] faith into Supreme Faith so let it be if
[1:15:23] Abraham was an ordinary man not a
[1:15:25] special man nothing great to note of him
[1:15:27] no armies no wealth none of these things
[1:15:30] made him into something that God would
[1:15:31] call him then every single one of us
[1:15:34] today is a candidate for the grace of
[1:15:36] God and we can be recipients of the same
[1:15:40] Supernatural then let that seed that was
[1:15:43] revealed to Abraham that produced Christ
[1:15:45] let Christ be produced in
[1:15:47] me let the mystery of Christ unfold the
[1:15:50] same in me let's stand to our feet
[1:15:55] let it unfold in
[1:15:57] [Music]
[1:16:02] me just in my simply daily
[1:16:07] life may the supernatural
[1:16:10] unfold we ought to live under
[1:16:12] Supernatural
[1:16:16] expectation but not Supernatural
[1:16:20] impersonation not to manufacture the
[1:16:23] supernatural but just to bear it
[1:16:26] let it
[1:16:28] happen with our heads bowed let's pray
[1:16:34] today maybe there's someone who came
[1:16:37] today
[1:16:40] discouraged looking back at their life
[1:16:44] and maybe they were just doing an audit
[1:16:46] of their years in the
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:50] message doing an audit of the trajectory
[1:16:52] of things and where things are now and
[1:16:54] asking themselves well you know where
[1:16:57] you know how are things different and
[1:16:59] greater and and if we're supposed to be
[1:17:01] com into a Rapture why is it this
[1:17:02] happening why isn't that
[1:17:04] happening I encourage you to look at the
[1:17:06] life of
[1:17:08] Abraham and all the great and many
[1:17:10] promises that were made to
[1:17:13] him and even within his own family he
[1:17:16] could have said hey Dad hey brothers
[1:17:17] guess
[1:17:19] what in me all the families of the Earth
[1:17:23] are going to be blessed like you don't
[1:17:24] even have a
[1:17:26] son oh no no he said he said he was
[1:17:29] going to make me a great of me a great
[1:17:31] nation your wife's
[1:17:34] Barren there's there's a lot of lot of
[1:17:37] things when you begin to look at
[1:17:38] Abraham's life and a lot of promises
[1:17:40] that God made to Abraham a lot of brags
[1:17:42] that he would have had that wouldn't
[1:17:43] seem like they ever made any it came to
[1:17:46] any manifestation in his life during his
[1:17:48] life
[1:17:49] time but he died believing the
[1:17:53] promise even to where where God gave him
[1:17:55] the promise that your people Soul Jour
[1:17:56] in a Strange Land for 400 years and
[1:17:59] every single promise that God made to
[1:18:01] Abraham has come to pass even if it
[1:18:04] didn't happen in his lifetime and you
[1:18:06] stand here today maybe taking inventory
[1:18:08] it's your own life and your own
[1:18:09] trajectory and ins and outs and ups and
[1:18:11] downs and disappointments and maybe you
[1:18:13] found yourself being challenged just a
[1:18:14] little bit and a little bit maybe
[1:18:16] worried or anxious about are things
[1:18:17] unfolding or things unfolding then I say
[1:18:19] that God has supernaturally discerned
[1:18:22] what was in your heart and your anx
[1:18:24] xiety and even your assessments and your
[1:18:27] audit and the way you're looking back on
[1:18:28] things and trying to assess Church
[1:18:30] experience and where this is going and
[1:18:31] where that is going and he's kind of
[1:18:33] caught you hopefully by God's grace by
[1:18:35] discernment caught your attention say
[1:18:37] wait a minute we're not trying to put
[1:18:39] somebody up on a pedestal and make
[1:18:41] things out into some kind of fantastic
[1:18:43] or some kind of imagination in some kind
[1:18:45] of magical worldly Kingdom of This World
[1:18:48] With all its bells and whistles and
[1:18:49] gingerbread and and tinsel but to come
[1:18:52] down to just a simple life live before
[1:18:54] God believeing in The
[1:18:57] Invisible do you have the kind of Faith
[1:18:59] to say I believe no matter how dark it
[1:19:01] gets there's a man here who could turn
[1:19:03] on the light no matter how stagnant see
[1:19:05] things may seem to be there's a God who
[1:19:07] has spoken to me and made himself known
[1:19:09] to me and he speaks to my faith and he
[1:19:12] speaks to my soul and I cannot resist it
[1:19:15] and I know that I ought not resist it
[1:19:17] and I must follow him wherever he leads
[1:19:20] me and I don't need the the bells and
[1:19:23] whistles of this world I don't need need
[1:19:24] the the clamoring of this world and the
[1:19:27] GL the
[1:19:29] glow and and all the glitter of this
[1:19:32] world to keep me going I just need faith
[1:19:36] in him our gracious Heavenly Father the
[1:19:39] faith of Abraham is inspiring to
[1:19:43] us this thought today to see him as an
[1:19:45] ordinary man living an ordinary
[1:19:48] life but yet you make a revelation to
[1:19:51] him and that Revelation becomes the
[1:19:55] seed of the next
[1:19:59] Masterpiece and he becomes the
[1:20:01] foundation of another Masterpiece which
[1:20:03] culminates and climaxes in Jesus Christ
[1:20:06] the son of David the son of
[1:20:09] Abraham Lord as we've expressed from our
[1:20:12] hearts today there's times when it seems
[1:20:14] so difficult to be an heir with
[1:20:18] Christ the sinless son of God who died
[1:20:21] for our sins
[1:20:25] but may we
[1:20:26] lord through that
[1:20:29] [Music]
[1:20:32] sacrifice and the same faith that
[1:20:34] Abraham had come into that
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:40] fellowship and help us Lord to even
[1:20:42] begin to rightly position our faith in
[1:20:44] the end time for a
[1:20:46] Rapture by coming back to the foundation
[1:20:49] of our
[1:20:51] faith Lord there's a a phrase that we
[1:20:53] use amongst ourselves
[1:20:56] quite
[1:20:57] often will say are they a
[1:21:01] Believer it means something to us it's a
[1:21:04] it's a phrase that has its etymology
[1:21:06] within the message and message Believers
[1:21:09] and we're we're using it to
[1:21:12] express whether or not a particular
[1:21:15] individual
[1:21:16] believes that brother brandham it was a
[1:21:20] prophet that fulfilled Malachi 4:5 in
[1:21:23] the spirit of Elijah
[1:21:25] [Music]
[1:21:28] and Lord we use that phrase to express
[1:21:31] are they a
[1:21:33] Believer and I'm I poured out My Heart
[1:21:37] Lord before you
[1:21:38] I there there is nothing wrong in
[1:21:45] that but Lord it means nothing it means
[1:21:51] nothing if that is merely an
[1:21:53] acknowledgement for an Ascent that you
[1:21:56] to to a work that you've done a
[1:21:58] fulfillment of Prophecy and we
[1:21:59] acknowledge and believe that God has
[1:22:01] fulfilled his promised word it's it
[1:22:04] seems empty Lord if we cannot through
[1:22:07] that come to this
[1:22:09] place of the faith of
[1:22:11] Abraham to believe
[1:22:14] you to recognize all along it was
[1:22:20] you I pray for the people that are here
[1:22:23] today that they could walk in the steps
[1:22:25] of the
[1:22:26] Patriarchs they could walk in the steps
[1:22:28] of Abraham walk in the step steps of
[1:22:31] Isaac walk in the steps of Jacob walk in
[1:22:33] the steps of Moses walk in the steps of
[1:22:35] brother Bram walk in the steps that they
[1:22:38] walked
[1:22:40] in and those steps being that you reveal
[1:22:43] yourself and make yourself known to
[1:22:46] us and upon that conviction and that
[1:22:50] basis there's a sense way down in our
[1:22:52] souls that we cannot disregard
[1:22:55] yay Lord we must
[1:22:57] follow and follow your word encourage
[1:23:00] your people today we've been encouraged
[1:23:03] by our visitors that are with us our
[1:23:05] fellow Believers and friends that are
[1:23:07] here I pray that they would likewise be
[1:23:11] encouraged bless our fellowship may it
[1:23:13] be sweet
[1:23:15] Lord may we exhibit a Grace and kindness
[1:23:18] to one another that cultivates real
[1:23:20] peace in our
[1:23:22] hearts Lord we never know
[1:23:25] what kind of Brokenness finds itself in
[1:23:27] our
[1:23:29] midst and on the outside someone can
[1:23:32] seem so well put together and happy and
[1:23:35] jovial and willing and ready to assist
[1:23:39] and always seems to have the right thing
[1:23:41] to say and we admire
[1:23:44] them but they come with a deep heaviness
[1:23:47] in their
[1:23:49] hearts come with longings and heartaches
[1:23:52] and sorrow
[1:23:55] and we can be the Bears of
[1:23:57] healing we can be the ones that Minister
[1:24:00] words of encouragement and our our
[1:24:03] approach and our Grace can
[1:24:05] wash the Unseen fears and anxieties
[1:24:09] away may that be our testimony today
[1:24:12] Lord may we be sensitized to these
[1:24:14] things because that's the ordinary life
[1:24:15] that we need to
[1:24:18] live I pray your blessing upon your
[1:24:20] people as to commit them to you in the
[1:24:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask
[1:24:25] these things amen
