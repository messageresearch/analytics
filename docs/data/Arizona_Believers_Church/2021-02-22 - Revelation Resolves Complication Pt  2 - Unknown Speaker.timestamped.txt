[0:03] proverbs chapter 24
[0:07] verses 3 and 4. welcome everyone to the
[0:11] house the lord today we're very
[0:12] very glad that you could be here we'll
[0:15] begin reading again
[0:16] proverbs chapter 24 verses 3 and 4.
[0:19] through wisdom is a house builded and by
[0:22] understanding it is established
[0:25] and by knowledge shall the chambers be
[0:27] filled with all precious
[0:29] and pleasant riches you may be seated
[0:33] i really love these verses it's a
[0:36] wonderful promise just to kind of
[0:38] put your finger on and say this is this
[0:41] i believe
[0:42] that through wisdom is a house built and
[0:44] by understanding it's established and
[0:46] made firm
[0:47] and by knowledge that's how you fill all
[0:50] the rooms
[0:51] with precious and pleasant riches by
[0:53] wisdom
[0:54] and knowledge and understanding we're
[0:57] continuing on the subject
[0:58] of revelation resolves complication
[1:01] and i want to remind you that kind of
[1:04] the trajectory of how we found ourselves
[1:06] even in this area to begin to talk about
[1:09] how now
[1:10] life is complicated we're looking at how
[1:12] uh at the end of the beginning
[1:14] now it's complicated because after the
[1:16] fall the simplicity of the life that
[1:18] existed in the garden has been lost
[1:21] and uh and we were using this kind of as
[1:24] a foundation or
[1:26] an entry an entrance into the subject of
[1:29] family and
[1:30] and relationships and just life so that
[1:33] we're not
[1:33] um filtering the word the wrong way or
[1:36] looking at things with the wrong
[1:37] perspective because we need to
[1:38] acknowledge number one
[1:40] the age that we live in the time that
[1:42] we're living in
[1:43] the circumstances that we all face and
[1:45] not make the mistake of kind of
[1:47] splicing things together in our minds
[1:49] and using certain filters to even create
[1:51] a picture that's not accurate about the
[1:53] world we're living in
[1:54] or merely just try to present our lives
[1:56] in a way that other people think
[1:58] everything's okay
[2:00] but be very honest about our lives the
[2:02] situations we're facing
[2:03] and taking that kind of honest approach
[2:05] to what we're going through
[2:07] no matter what we meet and what we face
[2:09] we believe the word is enough
[2:10] and we believe that this is the reality
[2:12] of what i'm going through my
[2:14] marriage or my my children or my
[2:16] financial situation or my health
[2:18] say this is the reality but the word is
[2:20] enough and just to anchor
[2:22] in that so we we haven't kind of uh
[2:25] we haven't moved on beh beyond that
[2:27] whole idea how that god is wanting to be
[2:29] manifested in family
[2:31] and how that our families are called to
[2:32] be a portrait of god but i
[2:34] i just was directed in this area to
[2:36] acknowledge
[2:37] and point out that we live in
[2:39] complicated times
[2:41] and if we try to use a complicated mind
[2:43] to make sense of it all it's only going
[2:44] to get worse
[2:46] and last sunday we were examining how
[2:48] all of humanity
[2:50] had lost focus of the one thing needful
[2:53] and how they had lost
[2:54] their faith in god they were no longer
[2:56] believing in his promise
[2:58] because man and the woman even as they
[2:59] were thrust out of the garden they would
[3:01] have been looking to the promise of
[3:02] genesis 3 15
[3:04] and believing that even though they were
[3:06] in sin and even though they had made a
[3:08] horrible mistake
[3:09] god told them before they left i'll take
[3:12] care of this
[3:12] i'll make a way i'll redeem you out of
[3:14] this so they still had a promise to live
[3:16] for
[3:17] and abel caught a revelation and offered
[3:19] his sacrifice
[3:21] through that revelation and by faith and
[3:23] that was acceptable to god and pleasing
[3:25] to god
[3:26] and we're bringing it to revelations
[3:28] chapter 3 verse 17
[3:30] to look at the time that we're living in
[3:32] and we explored the scripture
[3:34] in greater detail on wednesday and i
[3:36] realize these scriptures have been
[3:38] used quite a bit already even this year
[3:41] but in revelations chapter 3 verse 17
[3:44] this is the confession of
[3:46] the world today society at large that i
[3:49] am rich and
[3:50] increased with goods and have need of
[3:51] nothing this is the
[3:53] profession this is the even the thought
[3:55] process uh whether it's uh
[3:57] consciously uh expressed or meditated
[4:00] upon this is really what's at the heart
[4:02] of laodiceans
[4:04] is they say i'm rich increased with
[4:06] goods and have need of nothing
[4:08] but god says because you think that way
[4:10] and know us not that thou art wretched
[4:12] and miserable and poor
[4:14] and blind and naked because you think
[4:16] that way i have a prescription for you
[4:18] and we were brother brennan made a
[4:20] comment when he was writing the church
[4:22] age book that a great burden of this
[4:23] last age
[4:24] is the pressure of riches soft living
[4:27] and nervous
[4:28] tensions in a complex age that we seem
[4:30] unfitted to live in
[4:32] so we want to be aware that there's this
[4:34] burden that we're all facing this
[4:36] pressure
[4:36] of riches soft living and nervous
[4:39] tensions
[4:40] and and you say oh i don't i don't have
[4:42] a problem with the pressure of riches
[4:43] and i don't have a problem with soft
[4:45] living
[4:45] and i don't have a promise a problem
[4:47] with nervous tensions and
[4:49] uh you might find that all of a sudden
[4:51] you start getting a little bit too hot
[4:52] in church today or too cold
[4:53] you find the seats not exactly
[4:55] comfortable that's soft living
[4:57] right i mean let's just be honest about
[4:59] it you're like i just wish we could get
[5:01] different chairs can we bring our own
[5:02] lawn chairs to uh to church and that
[5:05] that's that's the whole idea of soft
[5:07] living
[5:08] is there certain things we've gotten
[5:09] accustomed to there's things that we
[5:11] can't live without
[5:12] and so these things exist and not just
[5:15] on them
[5:16] on their own but in a complex age in an
[5:19] age where god is doing a lot of
[5:20] a lot of supernatural powerful things
[5:22] and satan thinks he's finally hit his
[5:24] stride and figured everything out
[5:26] and so it's a very complex age that
[5:28] we're living in
[5:29] and what mankind lacks is they think
[5:32] they're rich increased with goods and
[5:33] have need of nothing
[5:34] but in reality they're poor wretched
[5:36] miserable and blind and naked
[5:38] and they lack the knowledge and i've
[5:40] been using this phrase because jesus
[5:42] told martha there's only one thing
[5:44] one thing necessary there's only one
[5:46] thing needful that good
[5:48] part and so they lack the knowledge of
[5:49] what is best in what is needful
[5:52] and lacking that knowledge and lacking
[5:54] an adherence to that
[5:55] they give themselves over to the flesh
[5:57] and to knowledge and science and sinning
[6:00] and we've been using the phrase that one
[6:02] of the philosophers used the cause of
[6:03] sinning
[6:04] is ignorance of what is better and so
[6:07] the very profound statement
[6:08] uh that they attribute to democrities he
[6:10] says the reason why man makes mistakes
[6:12] the reason why man sins the reason why
[6:14] man
[6:14] offends and does things that's
[6:16] displeasing to god and harmful to
[6:18] humanity
[6:18] is because they don't know what is
[6:20] better
[6:23] assuming that there should be some at
[6:25] least base nature within man that if
[6:27] they knew
[6:27] what the right thing was they would at
[6:29] least try to do it but with ignorance of
[6:31] what is better they give themselves over
[6:33] to even ultimately what is the worst and
[6:35] we're looking at this contrast of
[6:37] ignorance of what is better versus
[6:38] revelation
[6:40] because revelation conquers ignorance
[6:42] revelation is the answer to a lack of
[6:44] knowledge revelation
[6:45] is the answer to a lack of understanding
[6:48] and the bible even says my people have
[6:49] sinned they've fallen apart
[6:51] because of a lack of knowledge and so
[6:53] knowledge of the divine knowledge of the
[6:55] will of god is kind of the the
[6:56] protection
[6:57] and the power to overcome um the sin of
[7:00] ignorance and the sins
[7:01] and the weaknesses that come because
[7:02] you've forgotten what is needful
[7:05] and today we're gonna lord we'll
[7:07] inventure into it not venture but
[7:10] lead into an area that is very practical
[7:13] so if you could just even right now just
[7:16] be very
[7:16] focused and say lord i i've had prayers
[7:19] i've been very specific to you
[7:21] lately i've been asking god to deal with
[7:23] my heart and you have questions and
[7:24] you've been putting them before the lord
[7:26] if you can get very focused right now i
[7:27] believe god's going to answer a prayer
[7:29] and i believe it can be very very
[7:30] practical now
[7:32] in genesis chapter 4 verse 7
[7:36] god had approached cain after he had
[7:39] accepted abel's offering
[7:41] and he tells cain if thou doest well if
[7:43] you do that which is pleasing to me you
[7:44] will also be accepted
[7:46] if thou doest not well sin lieth at the
[7:49] door
[7:50] if you know there's a better way even if
[7:52] you don't know specifically what that is
[7:54] and you choose not to find it out and to
[7:56] walk in it
[7:57] sin will always be in your conscience
[8:00] because if you
[8:00] because knowing that you're not doing
[8:02] what is best and knowing that you're not
[8:04] doing
[8:05] what is right then you're condemned by
[8:06] your own sin your
[8:08] uh whatsoever is not of faith is sin is
[8:10] another scripture that we use that
[8:12] if you don't have absolute confidence
[8:14] that what you're doing is pleasing to
[8:15] the lord
[8:15] then you're going to have this part of
[8:17] your conscience that begins to condemn
[8:19] you
[8:19] that you may be wrong how do you know
[8:21] you're not how you know you're not
[8:22] making a mistake
[8:23] and this is this dynamic that god is
[8:25] identifying within the
[8:27] mindset of man here right in genesis
[8:28] chapter four god has already given
[8:31] us insight into how the human mind works
[8:33] he says if
[8:34] i'm telling you right now if you do well
[8:36] if you do what's pleasing to me
[8:38] i'll accept you just as i did abel but
[8:40] if you don't it's going to bother you
[8:42] it's going to eat at you it's going to
[8:44] really work you over and cain
[8:45] actually lives a life proving that sin
[8:49] was driving him and this consciousness
[8:51] of his guilt was driving
[8:52] because he leaves off from where they
[8:54] were and he runs from the presence of
[8:55] the lord and he begins to build
[8:56] civilization he builds a city a walled
[8:58] city to always be on watch why he was
[9:01] afraid his sin would come back to get
[9:02] him
[9:03] and this dominated mankind and here in
[9:06] the scripture god gives
[9:08] cain an opportunity to ask for what was
[9:10] better
[9:12] if you do what's pleasing will you not
[9:13] be accepted then cain could have said
[9:14] well then lord
[9:15] what's pleasing what is it about my
[9:17] brother's sacrifice that pleased you
[9:20] and so he would have given him an
[9:21] opportunity for that way that was most
[9:23] excellent or more excellent so this was
[9:25] god's counsel to cain
[9:27] even in the midst of his ignorance and
[9:29] this is such grace that he would
[9:31] approach him so that's grace that he
[9:33] would approach cain knowing cain
[9:34] the product of sin and cain the product
[9:36] of this great fall in this uh hybridian
[9:39] process god still goes to him says
[9:41] there's a better way and if you do the
[9:43] better way you'll be accepted
[9:44] and this was god's counsel so in
[9:47] revelations chapter 3 verse 18
[9:50] this is god's counsel because you say
[9:52] i'm rich increased with goods and have
[9:54] need of nothing
[9:55] and you don't realize that you're
[9:56] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[9:58] i counsel thee so this is god's counsel
[10:02] to the laodicean conscience and
[10:04] condition
[10:05] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[10:08] in the fire
[10:10] brother branham makes the statement in
[10:12] the church age book and this is a very
[10:13] beautiful teaching the gold of god is
[10:15] christ-like character
[10:17] produced in the fiery furnace of
[10:19] affliction
[10:20] so when god says i counsel thee to buy
[10:22] of me gold trying the fire
[10:25] he's actually presenting a different
[10:27] type of transaction
[10:29] to the church than what they're engaging
[10:31] in because they believe they're rich and
[10:33] increased with goods and have need of
[10:34] nothing they've gotten to that place
[10:36] through commerce they've gotten through
[10:37] to that place of of buying and acquiring
[10:40] in a certain exchange
[10:41] so now he's presenting to them a
[10:43] different type of exchange
[10:44] i counsel thee to buy of me buy from me
[10:47] gold
[10:47] tried in the fire in that gold is the
[10:50] christ-like
[10:51] character produced through affliction
[10:55] now we we don't even want that for free
[10:58] let alone buying it
[11:01] but it it it's introducing to us
[11:04] a different value system that we ought
[11:07] to value
[11:08] character more than we do the things
[11:09] that we possess
[11:11] that we ought to do we ought to value
[11:13] christ like character
[11:14] even if it can only be achieved through
[11:16] suffering that at the end of the day
[11:18] that's what i really desire to have is
[11:19] have christ-like character
[11:21] if i'm destitute of everything else but
[11:23] can stand in the character of christ or
[11:25] then i've gained it all
[11:27] and so it becomes a different value
[11:29] system and what we're touching on now
[11:31] i'll use it in this in this context just
[11:34] to so you kind of open up the door wider
[11:36] to what
[11:36] i'm looking at and pondering that as
[11:39] believers
[11:40] we have things that we assess greater
[11:42] value to than what the world does
[11:44] and so we could be evaluating an
[11:46] opportunity and we would have a balance
[11:48] sheet and we would have certain entries
[11:50] into that balance sheet
[11:51] and we would come up with a a weight at
[11:53] the end and say this is how much value
[11:55] this opportunity has
[11:57] and then you compare it to another
[11:58] opportunity and the world would say well
[12:00] what's the retirement what's the health
[12:02] insurance what's the opportunity for
[12:04] upward mobility and in in raises and
[12:06] you'd have all these different things
[12:07] that you'd be looking at and
[12:09] how much is my salary going to be and uh
[12:11] is there a bonus for signing on
[12:13] and all these things may add up towards
[12:15] like this this entire contract
[12:17] offered to me is worth a hundred and
[12:19] fifty thousand dollars
[12:20] uh in the first year and then you have
[12:23] this other opportunity over here and you
[12:24] line up
[12:25] all the same things but then you have
[12:27] another balance sheet that you begin to
[12:29] evaluate the rest of them of i
[12:31] and quality of life am i able to spend
[12:34] time with my family
[12:35] am i able to be of assistance to the
[12:38] body of christ am i able to attend
[12:39] church
[12:40] am i going to be able to put the lord
[12:42] first and all of a sudden you find that
[12:43] there's other entries that ought to be
[12:45] evaluated
[12:46] and many times it's the job that's tens
[12:48] of thousands of dollars
[12:49] less in terms of dollars that's a more
[12:52] valuable opportunity
[12:53] than the one that has a higher salary
[12:56] because you have a different
[12:57] uh you have a different value system you
[12:58] have a different way of evaluating a
[13:00] transaction or an exchange
[13:02] and so he says i counsel thee to buy me
[13:04] gold tried in the fire
[13:06] that thou mayest be rich in white
[13:08] raiment that thou
[13:09] mayest be clothed brother adam said
[13:11] there's a price to pay for those
[13:13] garments
[13:14] and that is the price of separation wow
[13:17] that's a
[13:17] that's a very heavy statement there's a
[13:20] price to pay for those garments
[13:22] and it's a price of separation he says
[13:24] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[13:26] appear so that's the reason why these
[13:28] garments are necessary
[13:29] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[13:31] appear you'll find that each one of
[13:32] these is answering the gold tried in the
[13:34] fire
[13:35] is answering to the richness the the
[13:37] clothing answers to the nakedness and
[13:39] and being increased with goods and each
[13:42] one of these things
[13:43] it answers to the confession and the
[13:45] reality god has given this beautiful
[13:47] prescription
[13:48] and he says and anoint that eyes with i
[13:51] said
[13:52] that thou mayest see and brother brahman
[13:55] said there's no
[13:56] he does not say that you have to buy the
[13:58] isaf
[13:59] he says buy me gold tried the fire so
[14:01] there is not anything necessary
[14:03] this affliction and this suffering where
[14:04] you're giving yourself to something
[14:06] and you're having to pay this price of
[14:08] separation and pay this price of
[14:10] affliction to achieve
[14:11] the gold or to achieve the white gold
[14:13] but he says there's no price for the i
[14:15] salve he says there's no price tag on
[14:17] the holy spirit
[14:19] now what is it directly connected to the
[14:20] spiritual revelation
[14:22] of the word that is something that is
[14:25] available that god wants to give you
[14:27] if something says just take and anoint
[14:29] thine eyes with isaf what does it take
[14:31] it takes a genuine experience of the new
[14:33] birth for someone to have
[14:34] this holy spirit that can open your eyes
[14:37] and
[14:37] we know it continually opens our eyes
[14:40] the new birth is a revelation of jesus
[14:42] christ personally to me
[14:44] but when i receive when you receive the
[14:46] baptism of the holy ghost and you're
[14:47] born again in christ
[14:49] then you you're as a newborn babe and
[14:51] you're beginning to develop
[14:52] spiritual characteristics and abilities
[14:55] and that can only be done through the
[14:56] nurture of the spirit
[14:58] and by taking the sincere milk of the
[15:00] word of god and growing to where you can
[15:02] handle meat
[15:03] and what happens your sense is the
[15:04] situation the only way she can get out
[15:06] of revelations 3 17
[15:07] he says is by obeying the lord to come
[15:10] back to his word
[15:12] this is what's expressed in verse 18 the
[15:14] only way you can get out
[15:15] of and not be entangled in in subject to
[15:18] and overwhelmed by
[15:20] the laodicean condition is to obey the
[15:22] lord and come back to his word
[15:25] it's by our knowledge of and our
[15:26] adherence to the pure word
[15:28] that is what is going to be our health
[15:30] and that's what's our that's going to be
[15:32] our wealth
[15:33] it's a very simple statement to realize
[15:35] this that no no believer
[15:37] is any more healthy any more spiritual
[15:39] and any more alive than his knowledge of
[15:41] and his obedience to the pure word of
[15:43] god
[15:44] so your health your spiritual health
[15:46] your your spiritual wealth and if we i
[15:48] would even want to express it this way
[15:50] true health and true wealth even as it
[15:52] would relate to the physical
[15:54] is not going to be any greater than your
[15:56] understanding of the word of god
[15:58] and then your obedience and adherence to
[16:00] the word of god
[16:01] because what would a perfect health be
[16:03] with no sickness at all if you're
[16:05] running further away from god and
[16:07] sinning and piling yourself
[16:09] up complexes and circumstances and poor
[16:12] decisions
[16:13] you say what is it all going to get you
[16:14] in the end nothing that lasts
[16:18] and so our knowledge of and obedience to
[16:20] the word of god is our health
[16:22] it is our wealth brother bennett makes
[16:25] this statement
[16:26] and if you want to if you wanted to kind
[16:28] of read all these things together this
[16:29] is just out of the church age book
[16:32] and even god's diagnosis in chapter 9
[16:34] there the
[16:35] the church age book and brother i'm
[16:38] referring to verse 18 the council of god
[16:40] is terse it's to the point
[16:43] and this is just as we're using this as
[16:46] god gave counsel in the garden as god
[16:48] gave counsel to cain
[16:49] as god has often given his counsel in
[16:51] the word of god now this is counsel to
[16:52] us
[16:53] it's terse it's to the point he directs
[16:55] this last day church to one hope
[16:57] the hope is himself
[17:01] his directness to one hope the hope is
[17:02] himself there's no other there's no
[17:04] other what can help
[17:05] christ what's my hope christ
[17:08] he says come to me and buy yes
[17:11] you're not going to find it in a man
[17:12] you're not going to find him in a
[17:13] particular church he's got to come to
[17:14] him
[17:15] he said well brother aaron do not want
[17:16] people to come to church absolutely i
[17:18] want you to come to church do you want
[17:19] them to come to your church if god would
[17:20] lead them
[17:21] come here but what i would hope that
[17:23] they would ultimately experience
[17:24] is not an interaction with me but an
[17:27] exchange with god something that takes
[17:29] place between man and god
[17:30] where they come to him and they bind
[17:33] that you're not coming here for an
[17:35] exchange of ideas and personalities and
[17:37] politics and pretense and
[17:39] and opportunities to hear certain gifts
[17:41] express themselves through music and
[17:43] through word
[17:43] and we're not just here for the
[17:45] fellowship that follows though we enjoy
[17:46] that
[17:47] but we come because this is a dynamic
[17:48] where i know i can come to god and i can
[17:50] get the things that i need
[17:52] and that are necessary and it's just an
[17:55] extension
[17:56] of that dynamic that should play out in
[17:58] our lives every day
[18:00] wouldn't it be awful the only time we
[18:01] prayed is when we came to church
[18:04] yeah i i i want to say this
[18:07] in a way if that was the case we would
[18:10] probably enjoy
[18:11] we would have a church experience that
[18:13] we would enjoy a lot in the flesh
[18:17] because it would just be one big huge
[18:18] guilt session
[18:20] right we all just want to feel better
[18:22] about ourselves i'm a really horrible
[18:24] christian six days a week but then i
[18:26] could come
[18:27] i could come to church and i just and
[18:29] the worship is great and the music is
[18:31] hyped and the pastor comes out
[18:33] and just gets us all really excited
[18:35] about what we believe
[18:36] and and being being being christ-like
[18:39] and jesus in the world today
[18:41] and then we can just kind of go back and
[18:42] live and forget all about
[18:44] uh really what life is all about so
[18:46] coming here is not just an opportunity
[18:48] to placate guilt
[18:50] but it's it's a further extension of
[18:52] what should be taking place in our lives
[18:53] every other day of the week so he says
[18:57] come to me and by it is evident from
[19:00] this phrase
[19:01] by of me that the laodicean church is
[19:04] not at all dealing with jesus
[19:06] for the spiritual products of the
[19:08] kingdom of god
[19:11] this is a a a a very telling statement
[19:14] he says that the very fact that jesus
[19:16] speaks and god is saying to i counsel it
[19:18] to
[19:19] buy of me the fact that he's having to
[19:21] tell them to come to him to get
[19:23] something
[19:24] exposes the fact that they are not
[19:25] dealing with him
[19:27] with all their spiritual attainments
[19:29] that they're not dealing with him to
[19:31] have their richness their increase to
[19:33] increase
[19:33] of goods and their lack of need of
[19:36] anything that they haven't actually
[19:37] exchanged with god to have these things
[19:39] but has been entirely carnal and of
[19:41] their own pursuits and their own living
[19:43] this phrase is evidence that they have
[19:45] not been going to christ
[19:47] for a transaction or exchange for the
[19:49] spiritual products of the kingdom of god
[19:51] they've actually left
[19:52] christ and the words out to build
[19:54] whatever kingdom they're building
[19:57] and they've built like you can build
[19:59] pretty awesome kingdoms
[20:01] and you can build a very uh you know
[20:04] thriving kingdoms and systems
[20:06] and that don't lack for membership and
[20:08] that don't lack for a good works and
[20:10] don't lack for resources and finances
[20:13] but this is exposing a particular
[20:15] mindset to where man
[20:17] judges his spirituality by materiality
[20:21] and p and we have this instinct and and
[20:23] i want to be very very blunt
[20:25] don't be quick to say not me
[20:28] because we'll we can judge a church very
[20:30] quickly and go oh
[20:31] oh that that that church and you're
[20:33] judging just by the appearance of the
[20:35] building
[20:37] ah it's kind of a ratty building it's in
[20:38] a bad side of town you know they meet in
[20:40] a strip shopping center and there's just
[20:41] a dollar general where the anchors there
[20:43] and
[20:44] and you start making assumptions about
[20:45] the church and you're just using it
[20:47] carnally
[20:49] and i know this is true there's been
[20:51] times that a minister is asked to preach
[20:53] and
[20:53] you know there's a busy minister you
[20:54] don't know who he is and he comes out to
[20:56] preach
[20:56] and he's kind of dressed in like that
[20:58] that suit that suit was popular in the
[21:00] 80s
[21:02] right the 80s just paged me on my beeper
[21:06] they want their suit back
[21:08] right and immediately you're like i
[21:10] don't know where this is going
[21:12] and you get uncomfortable why because
[21:14] you've used carnal metrics
[21:16] to judge something through the the
[21:19] materiality and you begin to judge right
[21:21] away whether or not you're gonna get
[21:22] anything out of the service
[21:23] all based upon material things you're
[21:25] judging a church's spirituality
[21:27] because of their zip code because they
[21:28] rent or or whatever it might be
[21:30] and you're using carnal things to to
[21:33] make a spiritual judgment and we've got
[21:35] to be very careful that we don't do that
[21:39] they've been using their carnality for
[21:44] the spiritual products and using
[21:45] the material wealth and their increase
[21:47] of goods to say hey we must be doing
[21:50] good
[21:50] i mean we can't be all bad if we've got
[21:53] this
[21:53] these things going for us but he says
[21:56] this
[21:57] their transactions cannot be
[22:00] spiritual their transactions cannot
[22:05] be spiritual this is a prophet taking
[22:08] the diagnosis from god in revelations 3
[22:11] 18
[22:11] and saying what god is saying here when
[22:14] he wrote out this prescription
[22:15] anybody here brother branham as a
[22:17] prophet as a pharmacist could look at
[22:19] this prescription and say
[22:20] oh if he's prescribing that then this
[22:23] must be what's wrong
[22:26] and that's what someone who brother
[22:28] branham is able to do say god would have
[22:29] never said come to me and buy
[22:31] if they had spiritual transactions and
[22:33] if they were already interacting with
[22:35] god
[22:35] but he's had to say hey hey over here
[22:38] come over here
[22:39] stop being so carnal you got to come
[22:41] over here
[22:42] to get what you need to be spiritual
[22:44] their transactions cannot be spiritual
[22:46] whatever they're carnal
[22:49] and so this is a challenge for us in
[22:52] light of this prescription i counsel
[22:53] thee to come
[22:54] to buy of me and it and this is god
[22:58] presenting this to the laodicean church
[23:00] we also
[23:01] challenge ourselves and i believe that
[23:03] we ought to right now
[23:05] begin to audit our transactions by the
[23:07] word
[23:09] go ahead and begin to do an audit i'm
[23:12] going to take inventory of my life i'm
[23:13] going to kind of run through my
[23:14] transactions my point
[23:16] my point of sales everything i'm
[23:17] exchanging what i'm giving what i'm
[23:18] receiving what i'm pursuing what i'm
[23:20] buying what i'm consuming
[23:22] and i want to go ahead and look at my
[23:24] life and ask myself
[23:26] and what i'm seeing take place in terms
[23:28] of spiritual products am i
[23:30] is the kingdom of god being established
[23:32] in my life
[23:34] through transactions that are spiritual
[23:36] or do i find that i'm actually building
[23:37] a pretty good natural kingdom that if i
[23:40] that maybe one day i'd be able to hand
[23:41] over to my children and and i would have
[23:43] my estate planned and i would have this
[23:45] trust set up and i would have this
[23:47] retirement account
[23:48] and had everything established to where
[23:49] if i ever if when i die
[23:51] the the state will be distributed this
[23:53] way and that my products of what i'm
[23:55] transacting in and the exchanges that
[23:57] i'm doing are merely building a
[23:58] natural kingdom that would be passed
[24:00] down to my children or do am i building
[24:02] a spiritual kingdom of god
[24:04] that the bible says this good man and a
[24:06] righteous man leaves an inheritance for
[24:08] his grandchildren
[24:10] now what kind of what kind of
[24:12] inheritance would that be it's it's not
[24:14] just merely pointing to a 401k or a
[24:16] retirement plan or an investment account
[24:18] or even real estate that's going to
[24:20] survive economies changing and falling
[24:23] that your grandchildren can benefit from
[24:26] it but actually a kind of character and
[24:28] an integrity
[24:29] and a life lived before the lord that
[24:31] not only impacts your son but will
[24:32] impact your grandson
[24:34] that these are things of value and these
[24:37] are things that you begin to think about
[24:38] and begin to ponder
[24:39] and so we want to kind of give think
[24:41] about our lives he says their
[24:42] transactions are not spiritual
[24:45] a transaction is a negotiated agreement
[24:47] it's a management or settlement
[24:49] or the settlement of an affair reaching
[24:51] to a conclusion or an exchange
[24:53] it comes from the the combination of a
[24:55] word across beyond or through
[24:57] and to set into motion or to drive
[24:59] forward transaction to come across
[25:01] and to drive forward so it means to
[25:03] accomplish it means to perform
[25:06] it means to drive or carry through to
[25:07] come to an agreement
[25:09] so brave says their transactions cannot
[25:11] be spiritual their drive and their
[25:13] motivation what's carrying them over
[25:15] what's bringing them through
[25:16] is not spiritual and as he said that the
[25:19] gift gold to god is christ-like
[25:21] character in the
[25:22] and the garments of separation uh is
[25:25] this white raiment and he
[25:26] uses those that language to get us to
[25:28] ponder what god is presenting
[25:30] they do not value character
[25:33] it's not tech integrity that they're
[25:34] valued it's not being pleasing to the
[25:36] lord
[25:37] it's not a satisfied conscience between
[25:39] the man and god that they want to pursue
[25:41] but rather they're pursuing consumption
[25:44] and and their own profession in god's
[25:47] diagnosis
[25:47] they kind of they harmonize and match
[25:49] because they've got a lot of stuff
[25:51] but god is saying you valued the wrong
[25:53] things they're not valuing character but
[25:55] rather they're seeking to consume
[25:58] and so the spirit of the age and this is
[26:00] as i look to
[26:01] a couple words that i want to define to
[26:04] you
[26:05] this is kind of where things begin to
[26:07] turn a little bit more focused and get a
[26:08] little bit more focused in the spirit of
[26:10] the age
[26:10] blinds us from true contentment
[26:14] it really blinds us from what really
[26:16] satisfies
[26:18] and i'll say this confidently about the
[26:20] elect that there's only ever going to be
[26:22] one thing that completely satisfies
[26:25] and that's christ and you can spend your
[26:28] entire life
[26:29] pursuing things and it's never going to
[26:32] scratch that itch
[26:34] until you come to christ wealth won't do
[26:36] it health won't do it
[26:38] jobs popularity money women all of it
[26:41] it'll never satisfy until you come to
[26:43] christ
[26:45] the bible says that as many as um
[26:47] believed
[26:49] as many as were ordained to eternal life
[26:52] believed
[26:53] and that word ordained is actually
[26:55] translated in one place and has the
[26:56] meaning in the greek as many as we're
[26:57] addicted
[26:59] to eternal life believed and with the
[27:02] elect it's just
[27:02] it's really the truth you were born with
[27:04] an addiction
[27:08] you were born as a word junkie and you
[27:09] just didn't know it
[27:11] it was put in there by your heavenly
[27:13] father
[27:14] and you were born needing the word to
[27:17] fix you
[27:19] just as a a a drug junkie needs a fix
[27:22] they need to get a fix so you needed to
[27:23] fix
[27:24] and there was only one person that could
[27:26] satisfy it and it was the word why
[27:28] because i was born
[27:29] addicted to the word and that's why
[27:32] nothing satisfies i mean
[27:34] even even as you begin to look back in
[27:36] your life in elementary school and
[27:37] middle school in high school
[27:39] when you're hanging out with all the
[27:40] skaters and they're all they're loving
[27:42] thrashing and you're liking it too but
[27:43] yet it doesn't do for you what it's
[27:45] doing for them and you're like
[27:46] this isn't working so i'm going to go
[27:47] hang out with the ropers and you start
[27:49] riding cows and wearing boots and like
[27:51] maybe this is where i'll find it
[27:52] and yeah you kind of enjoy riding bulls
[27:54] a little bit but it still doesn't really
[27:56] anchor deep inside your heart and you
[27:58] just pursue all this stuff but then one
[28:00] day you meet him you're like
[28:02] this is what i needed when i was 14.
[28:06] where was this my whole life you were
[28:07] addicted to it
[28:09] and so there's something there's a way
[28:11] that this world has been constructed to
[28:13] blind us to what truly will satisfy
[28:16] the believer and blind us from true
[28:18] contentment for the sake of consuming
[28:20] content
[28:23] consuming things and i want to present
[28:26] this contrast to you today
[28:28] of being content which is desiring no
[28:31] more than what one has
[28:32] to be satisfied to be content to have a
[28:35] peace of mind
[28:36] to be content willing to accept
[28:38] something that is granted something that
[28:39] you receive
[28:40] you're happy with it you're satisfied
[28:41] with it and so there's this it's an
[28:43] adverb to be content it's something
[28:45] that's modifying your state or
[28:47] content which is information or
[28:51] proportion of a substance
[28:53] something contained it's something uh
[28:55] it's certain items or something material
[28:58] are you content or do you want content
[29:02] there's a contentment that god wants to
[29:03] give you and there's a content that this
[29:06] world wants to give you
[29:07] are you content or do you want content
[29:09] you want possessions you want material
[29:11] wealth you want substance you want
[29:13] information
[29:13] and we should be content and not content
[29:16] consumers
[29:18] what defines us what motivates us what
[29:20] we begin we want to find is that peace
[29:23] and that satisfaction and we live in an
[29:25] age of content
[29:26] not a content age it's a complex age not
[29:29] an age that is satisfying we're not
[29:30] living in the age that is placated or
[29:32] status
[29:33] or satisfied rather but an age of
[29:34] content a content production content
[29:38] consumption even doing it now to where
[29:41] things are completely
[29:42] immeasurable in you can't take
[29:46] inventory of it with even some of the
[29:48] it's some
[29:49] unique accounting problems with public
[29:52] companies or companies that need to have
[29:53] their financials audited
[29:55] and i know i'm venturing into an area
[29:56] that i'm going to really make a fool out
[29:58] of myself by trying to talk about
[29:59] accounting and math i can only count by
[30:02] 500.
[30:05] it's very it can be very hard to figure
[30:08] out how do you
[30:09] how do you qualify quantify an asset
[30:11] when it's digital
[30:13] and you can just produce it without end
[30:18] and people are willing to pay for it so
[30:21] you can have a
[30:22] a particular purchase within an app
[30:25] and it'd say well you can buy this
[30:28] this gem within this app and you can buy
[30:31] it for ten thousand dollars
[30:33] and then we have a we have 10 million of
[30:36] them available in the app store
[30:37] and you want to put that on your balance
[30:39] sheet in your financials
[30:41] isn't that a crazy idea to think
[30:44] it's like enron's figured it out and
[30:48] worked its way into the digital world
[30:49] and you can create
[30:50] value where there isn't even anything
[30:52] there
[30:54] and it's it's all part of this wild
[30:56] world we're living in where there's it's
[30:57] an age of content content consumption
[30:59] content production
[31:01] and things that have value and things
[31:02] that are pursued and things that
[31:04] increase the wealth and the
[31:05] in the economy and things can be done
[31:07] that are completely without
[31:09] occupying any space physically but have
[31:12] more value than even real estate and
[31:18] it's all driven
[31:18] it's all driving the experience to
[31:21] experience things and that's how
[31:22] we look at this template of how satan
[31:24] attempted eve by knowledge
[31:26] in order to experience something and
[31:28] we're all being tempted to have these
[31:30] experiences
[31:31] and so this mindset of laodicea is this
[31:33] insatiable appetite
[31:35] this craving for goods for entertainment
[31:37] for pleasure
[31:39] for wealth i want to acquire one
[31:40] accumulate i want to have i want to have
[31:42] i want to have
[31:44] and when we ended sunday morning last
[31:46] week in ephesians chapter 4
[31:48] we very quickly went over this scripture
[31:50] and i want to read it again
[31:53] this i say therefore and testify in the
[31:55] lord that you henceforth
[31:57] walk not as other gentiles walk in the
[32:00] vanity
[32:00] of their mind so jesus identified in
[32:04] matthew chapter 6 that the gentiles seek
[32:06] after what they're going to eat what
[32:08] they'll drink and what they're going to
[32:09] wear
[32:10] that's all that a gentile is worried
[32:11] about is the roof over his head the bed
[32:14] he sleeps in the clothes he wears and
[32:15] the food he eats
[32:16] and what does that contrast to the
[32:18] gentiles were those who were not jews
[32:20] it's all other nations
[32:22] and them not being jews they're not
[32:24] looking to
[32:25] a real promise they can invent all sorts
[32:29] of gods and ideologies and belief
[32:31] systems
[32:32] but there's this distinction between
[32:34] jews and gentiles
[32:35] because jews were people of promise the
[32:37] god of abraham the god of isaac the god
[32:38] of jacob what made them who they were
[32:40] this god revealed himself to them and
[32:42] gave them a promise
[32:44] so the children of israel are people of
[32:45] promise he says you being a people of
[32:47] promise you live for the fulfillment of
[32:49] the promise
[32:50] not just what's going to be a roof over
[32:52] my head what am i going to eat what am i
[32:53] going to wear
[32:54] gentiles seek those things and paul
[32:56] picks up on the same
[32:58] idea and says the gentiles walk only in
[33:00] the vanity of their mind
[33:02] worried about what am i going to wear
[33:03] what are people going to think about
[33:04] what i wear where am i going to sleep
[33:05] what are people going to think about
[33:06] where i sleep what am i going to eat
[33:08] what are people going to think about the
[33:10] pictures i take of my food and share
[33:12] them with others
[33:12] what are they going to think and he's
[33:14] saying that's how gentiles think
[33:17] he says it's in the vanity of their mind
[33:19] and then notice
[33:20] how he gets really to the root of the
[33:22] problem having the understanding
[33:24] darkened
[33:25] it's an ignorance of what is better it's
[33:27] an ignorance of the divine their
[33:28] understanding is dark and being
[33:29] alienated from the life of god
[33:31] through the ignorance that is in them
[33:33] because of the blindness of their hearts
[33:35] if their hearts could see if their
[33:37] hearts were made open to be able to
[33:39] understand
[33:40] the things of god then they wouldn't be
[33:42] walking in the vanity of their mind
[33:44] would you still be doing all the things
[33:45] that a gentile does sleeping in a bed
[33:47] having a roof over your head
[33:49] eating and drinking and being clothed
[33:51] yes
[33:52] but it wouldn't be vanity because you
[33:55] would come to this conclusion
[33:56] that that what i must do is fear god and
[33:59] keep his commandments
[34:00] that this is my duty it's not just what
[34:02] can i eat what can i wear what can i
[34:04] have
[34:04] because my heavenly father knows that i
[34:06] have need of those things
[34:07] so my duty is to seek first the kingdom
[34:10] of god and then god has a way of making
[34:12] sure that those things are real
[34:13] blessings to me and not curses
[34:16] my heavenly father will add those things
[34:18] to me make them a part of my part of my
[34:20] life and be sure that i'm taken care of
[34:22] and there's so many promises that a
[34:23] believer could look to to have that
[34:25] confidence
[34:25] but their understanding is darkened
[34:27] because their hearts are blind
[34:29] and they're ignorant as a result who
[34:32] being past
[34:33] feeling and this is even a spiritual
[34:35] wisdom and discernment a real
[34:36] consciousness
[34:37] an integrity of heart the kind that seth
[34:40] would have had in his son enos toward
[34:41] then men begin to call upon the lord
[34:43] they had this feeling
[34:45] to seek god they had this feeling to
[34:47] avail themselves to the promises of god
[34:48] who being past feeling
[34:50] have given themselves over unto
[34:52] lasciviousness
[34:53] to work all uncleanness with greediness
[34:57] as we were reading in romans chapter one
[34:59] last time and i believe is romans
[35:01] chapter one
[35:02] with the the mindset that paul begins to
[35:04] describe humanity of
[35:06] we can go all the way back to genesis 4
[35:07] and genesis 6
[35:09] and even genesis 11 and see this is the
[35:11] depravity of
[35:12] man they've been their past feelings
[35:14] seeking god wanting
[35:16] to know his will wanting to know what's
[35:17] best and in doing so they've given
[35:19] themselves
[35:20] over to the flesh and that's how man has
[35:23] come to the astronaut age and beyond
[35:26] this is why we have um uh
[35:30] vehicles on mars right now drilling
[35:33] cores
[35:34] into mars and studying its rock samples
[35:36] and sending back high resolution
[35:38] pictures
[35:38] and doing these things because man has
[35:39] given himself over to science
[35:41] and they're more concerned about
[35:43] understanding the universe than the god
[35:45] who created it
[35:48] becomes students of the creation instead
[35:50] of the creator
[35:52] who in studying the creator you could
[35:54] resolve all the the
[35:55] the paradoxes that have arisen in
[35:58] studying the creation
[36:01] they've given themselves over to
[36:02] greediness this word greediness
[36:06] how did they come to a place of
[36:07] lasciviousness this appetite for the
[36:09] flesh this appetite for things that
[36:11] sensitize the flesh
[36:12] that produces this uncleanness with
[36:14] greediness now they're greedy it's not
[36:15] just yeah i'd enjoy it but it's a greed
[36:18] it's an inability to know what is
[36:20] necessary understanding dark and
[36:21] ignorance that is them they don't know
[36:23] what is necessary
[36:24] they don't find they're not finding what
[36:25] is sufficient
[36:27] there's this lack of contentment and
[36:28] simplicity
[36:30] if you're content you're not greedy
[36:34] if you're content you're satisfied you
[36:35] don't need any more
[36:37] but when you're greedy you want more
[36:39] give give me more i want more
[36:41] and brother branham says now these
[36:43] people
[36:44] have plenty of gold this is his
[36:46] assessment of revelations 3 17 the
[36:48] condition of laodicea
[36:50] this is part of god's diagnosis now
[36:52] these people have plenty of gold but it
[36:54] was the wrong kind
[36:56] now when you have the wrong kind of gold
[36:57] you can have a lot of it but it's still
[36:59] not enough
[37:01] right otherwise i mean really whenever
[37:04] people say you know tax the billionaires
[37:06] the billionaires would be like yeah i
[37:07] don't know what i'm going to do with all
[37:08] this go for it
[37:09] right but there's still something about
[37:11] men that's like well
[37:12] yeah i'm worth 100 billion dollars but
[37:16] what if i'm only worth 50 billion next
[37:18] year
[37:20] i mean i need to have some of this right
[37:22] it's because man is never
[37:24] satisfied even with wealth that
[37:26] accumulates he says he has plenty of
[37:28] gold but it's the wrong kind it was that
[37:29] gold that brought men's lives
[37:31] bought men's lives and destroyed them
[37:34] this is the natural condition of
[37:36] laodicea
[37:37] which has spiritual direct spiritual
[37:39] emotional
[37:40] psychological application to the
[37:41] condition of the age we live in
[37:43] they it was the kind of goal that buys
[37:45] men's lives and destroys their lives
[37:49] it was the gold that warped and twisted
[37:51] human character
[37:52] for its love was the root of all evil so
[37:55] they had a lot of
[37:56] material wealth they had a lot of
[37:57] possessions they had a lot of assets
[37:59] they had a lot of things that looked
[38:00] good on a balance sheet or we want to
[38:01] sit back and say well are we being
[38:03] blessed
[38:03] are we doing great things are things
[38:04] going well and yes they have a lot of
[38:06] gold they have a lot of possessions they
[38:07] have a lot of things they can brag about
[38:09] but it's not things that bring peace and
[38:12] contentment
[38:12] but things that whether by men's lives
[38:14] they get consumed by and people pursue
[38:16] and it warps and twists their human
[38:18] character to where they'll go to no
[38:20] end to see that they preserve
[38:24] this pretense or preserve these
[38:25] possessions so it warps their character
[38:28] which brotherhood says it's the love of
[38:29] that gold the love of those possessions
[38:31] the love of that wealth that's the root
[38:32] of all evil
[38:34] just as it cries the age cries of a
[38:35] great amplitude of all things
[38:37] but it keeps burning with desire like an
[38:39] unsatisfied fire
[38:40] it says i've got everything but it has a
[38:42] desire to get more
[38:43] to achieve more to find more not within
[38:46] a spiritual transaction
[38:47] and not through humility in a basement
[38:49] before god but to have
[38:51] power in what is its greed that corrupts
[38:54] man has become a perpetually wanting
[38:56] animal where
[38:58] nothing satisfies him completely he's
[39:00] never content what
[39:01] it's greediness
[39:04] and paul writes to timothy in 1st
[39:05] timothy chapter 6 verses 6 to 11.
[39:15] i have to remind myself sometimes to
[39:16] smile
[39:18] because i realize that i my resting face
[39:21] may not may look like i'm angry
[39:23] you're like man brother aaron brother
[39:24] aaron is mad no i'm just at rest
[39:27] you know i'm not in a bad mood i'm i'm
[39:29] actually
[39:30] i'm feeling so great right now i'm so
[39:33] happy
[39:34] i have a really good friend in texas
[39:36] where it's like it could be the best day
[39:37] of his life he'd be like
[39:38] man today is the best day of my life and
[39:42] then the next day the worst day of his
[39:43] life right so
[39:44] show some emotion man today is the worst
[39:46] day of my life it was just kind of
[39:47] always the same tone
[39:49] the same way and so i have to remind
[39:50] myself to smile so that you know i'm not
[39:52] angry with you when i'm reading to you
[39:53] from first timothy chapter six these are
[39:56] good things
[39:56] these are happy things first timothy
[39:59] chapter 6 verses 6 to 11
[40:02] but godliness with contentment is great
[40:04] gain anybody read that scripture before
[40:07] this is truth we'd all should be saying
[40:10] word to that
[40:11] like yes yes this is it this is this is
[40:14] so relevant to the time i'm living this
[40:15] is so relevant to me right now
[40:17] 33 years old a newly married man or
[40:20] something wherever you are in life i'm
[40:22] actually not 33 i've been married for
[40:23] many years
[40:24] i'm just saying whoever's here who wants
[40:25] to put themselves in the scripture can
[40:27] say yes
[40:27] this is so on target this is perfect
[40:32] godliness with contentment is great gain
[40:35] to have this god god likeness a
[40:36] christ-like character a desire to please
[40:39] god
[40:39] and to be happy satisfied that that's
[40:42] enough if i could just achieve godliness
[40:44] that's great gain that's of great value
[40:46] that's worth having
[40:48] since we brought nothing into this world
[40:49] and it's certain we carry nothing out of
[40:51] it
[40:53] you're not going to take that gold chain
[40:56] to that other dimension
[40:59] we take our character with us and our
[41:01] legacy is all that is left
[41:04] we take her character and we leave a
[41:05] legacy he says in having food and
[41:08] raiment let us be there with content if
[41:10] you have something to wear and something
[41:11] to eat be happy be content be satisfied
[41:14] i said that's a little extreme in the
[41:16] day and age we're living in but let's
[41:18] start there
[41:20] let's start there if i have something to
[41:21] eat and have clothes be content with
[41:23] them
[41:24] come on something to eat and clothes to
[41:26] wear
[41:27] be content be satisfied find contentment
[41:30] even in those provisions
[41:32] we can even challenge ourselves
[41:34] sometimes i want this i want this i want
[41:35] to do this i want to do that we can just
[41:36] remind ourselves
[41:37] am i eating am i feeding am i my kids
[41:39] being fed do we have shoes on our feet
[41:40] are we are we
[41:41] are we dressed in other words do we have
[41:44] the necessities of life
[41:46] and i don't believe that paul should say
[41:47] well i mean if you're homeless get over
[41:49] it
[41:50] i don't think that's what paul's saying
[41:51] the necessities of life if you have the
[41:53] necessities of life if you if you
[41:55] have the things that are necessary then
[41:57] be content with these necessary things
[41:59] he says but they that will be rich those
[42:01] that crave and desire to be rich
[42:04] those who aren't just satisfied with
[42:06] what they eat and what they wear
[42:07] but they want to eat a higher priced
[42:09] foods they want to wear
[42:11] nicer clothes and they're not just
[42:12] satisfied with the necessities of life
[42:14] but they want it to be conspicuous he
[42:16] says they will be they that will desire
[42:18] crave to be rich
[42:20] fall into temptation and a snare and in
[42:22] a many foolish and hurtful lust
[42:24] which drown men in destruction and
[42:28] perdition
[42:30] this is this is the word of god dealing
[42:32] with something that's within our human
[42:34] nature to
[42:35] to have and to consume and to get they
[42:38] say listen be very careful about wanting
[42:40] to be richer
[42:41] and not just have uh have bought bitcoin
[42:44] in 2011
[42:45] and still own a lot of it today it's not
[42:47] a currency
[42:49] that we're talking about possessions
[42:51] wealth
[42:52] material things he says for the love of
[42:56] money is the root of all evil
[42:58] is it the love of the dollar yes the
[43:00] dollar the assets the possessions the
[43:02] wealth the things that make life
[43:04] easier to live the things that would be
[43:05] attributable to riches the things that
[43:07] ultimately just cause the nervous
[43:08] tensions
[43:09] but it's all those things the love of
[43:11] money or the that's power to consume
[43:13] it's power to get
[43:15] its greed is the root of all evil
[43:18] this lush this desire to have the love
[43:21] of money is the root of all evil
[43:23] which while some coveted after
[43:26] this ability to acquire this greediness
[43:29] they have aired from the faith and
[43:30] pierced themselves through with many
[43:32] sorrows how did they air from the faith
[43:34] not by trying to figure things out and
[43:36] prove this and prove that but they
[43:38] air by pursuing the flesh
[43:41] but thou o man of god flee these things
[43:45] and follow after righteousness godliness
[43:47] faith
[43:48] love patience meekness total different
[43:51] entry in the balance sheet totally
[43:53] different value system
[43:55] not just fl uh pursuing food enragement
[43:58] not just pursuing
[43:59] uh riches and wealth and possessions and
[44:01] the latest and the greatest but
[44:02] i actually want to flee that mindset
[44:05] flee the lust
[44:06] flee the love of money flee the covenant
[44:08] after flee the will to be rich not
[44:10] fleeing raiment and food but the will to
[44:12] be rich the coveting after
[44:14] the love of money flee those things and
[44:16] pursue
[44:17] righteousness godliness faith love
[44:20] patience
[44:21] meekness
[44:24] john wesley summarized this verse 11
[44:26] this way in general they may all be
[44:28] summed up in one
[44:30] the desiring happiness out of god this
[44:33] is what john wesley concluded about this
[44:35] verse they can all be summed up
[44:36] the righteousness the godliness the
[44:38] faith the love the patience and meekness
[44:40] it can all be summed up in desiring
[44:42] contentment and happiness from god and
[44:43] god alone
[44:45] that's where you're going to find
[44:46] righteousness godliness faith love
[44:47] patience and meekness
[44:48] it is desiring happiness out of god god
[44:51] i want you to be my joy
[44:56] but the snare of laodicea is the lie of
[44:57] riches
[44:59] the deceitfulness of wealth and
[45:01] accumulation of assets and the
[45:02] possessions of certain things
[45:04] because the spirit of the age is to
[45:05] consume to acquire to to store up to
[45:08] have
[45:11] and paul is saying we should find this
[45:14] base level
[45:15] of contentment and knowing the
[45:16] necessities of life are taken care of
[45:20] that having having the basic needs
[45:24] and and think very uh personal about how
[45:28] these mechanisms work within your own
[45:30] heart
[45:32] because it works with different people
[45:34] some people can be completely satisfied
[45:36] with certain things but not with others
[45:38] so what you may pursue and find that you
[45:40] have to have
[45:42] in what is is actually problematic in
[45:44] your life
[45:45] may not be a problem for somebody else
[45:47] but they have the equal somewhere
[45:50] it's a pursuit they've got to have it
[45:53] and and i i by no means implying that
[45:55] this
[45:56] is indicative of a weakness or a problem
[45:58] but
[46:01] to it hypothetically there may be a
[46:04] person who could completely get
[46:06] by with a used car
[46:09] hey it gets you there it doesn't break
[46:12] down it's solid it gets good gas it's
[46:14] got
[46:14] really good air conditioning but yet it
[46:17] doesn't
[46:17] satisfy a particular desire within a
[46:20] person's heart they're kind of like
[46:22] yeah but that looks ugly right
[46:27] and like you know a minivan would really
[46:29] really be practical for a family of six
[46:32] right and you're just like man i
[46:35] promised the lord i made a vow i'd never
[46:37] drive a minivan
[46:39] and so i'm just just wanting to honor
[46:42] god
[46:44] and never drive a minivan i know it's a
[46:46] sacrifice because they're great i love
[46:48] them
[46:49] the new odysseys are amazing but it's a
[46:51] promise i made to god i fleeced the lord
[46:53] actually
[46:54] and he confirmed it many times
[46:57] you would you'd be just fine with the
[46:59] minivan that was used and you could pay
[47:00] cash for it but my goodness
[47:02] have you seen the new suburban right
[47:06] and and so there's a way that you could
[47:07] probably get by with something cheaper
[47:09] more economical more practical even
[47:11] maybe better gas mileage
[47:12] but there's some mechanism in you that
[47:14] just can't let it go and you've got to
[47:16] have
[47:17] something else like wouldn't just a
[47:20] cheap mid-level
[47:22] android phone really get the job done
[47:24] why do we need the i
[47:26] iphone pro max
[47:30] there's going to be another one it's
[47:31] going to be called the uber pro max
[47:33] plus and like 2 500 bucks let's do it
[47:37] i've been saving my stimulus checks what
[47:40] because you're not
[47:41] happy with something that gets the job
[47:45] done
[47:47] brother man makes this statement in
[47:48] several places and i believe it's so
[47:50] applicable he says i often tell young
[47:51] couples
[47:52] i always tell my young couples like this
[47:54] that happiness does not consist of how
[47:56] much of the world's goods you own
[47:58] but how content did you make yourself
[48:00] with the portion that's lauded to you
[48:03] happiness does not consist of how much
[48:06] you own and where you live and what you
[48:08] have and what you possess
[48:09] that's not what it consists of but a
[48:11] contentment how can you make
[48:13] yourself finding contentment in what's
[48:15] been given to you and what your lot is
[48:18] so this is it this is what we have let's
[48:21] find satisfaction with what we have
[48:23] if you can achieve today contentment
[48:25] with what god has given you today
[48:27] you will have contentment if he gives
[48:29] you more but if you're discontent now
[48:31] god could actually give you the more
[48:33] you've been begging for and guess what
[48:34] you won't be
[48:35] content and he just tested you say well
[48:39] i gave you that and you weren't happy
[48:40] with it you begged me for this and i
[48:42] wanted you to realize that even if i
[48:44] give you this you won't be happy
[48:46] because you never made yourself content
[48:48] with what i give you the first time
[48:51] you want true contentment find you want
[48:53] true happiness find contentment
[48:55] in what you have now and don't be
[48:58] don't be afraid to ask god for more lord
[49:00] i'm satisfied lord i'm happy but if you
[49:02] could if you would if it would be your
[49:03] will
[49:06] it's that pressure we put such a
[49:07] pressure on families and young families
[49:10] the pressures that are on young families
[49:12] these days especially in certain markets
[49:14] and i think
[49:14] phoenix may be getting to that place
[49:16] where a young family really can't afford
[49:17] to buy a house
[49:19] and they have the pressure of all the
[49:20] couples that got lucky enough to get
[49:22] married in 2007 when everything was
[49:24] worth a buck
[49:25] right you could go buy a 4 5 4 000
[49:28] square foot house for 150
[49:30] 000 and yeah they ripped all the mirrors
[49:32] out but you could replace them with ikea
[49:33] mirrors
[49:34] right yeah they they tore all the
[49:37] carpets out but just do stained concrete
[49:39] all the hipsters love it
[49:41] i paint all the walls white turn it in a
[49:44] real beautiful house
[49:45] and now it's worth not a buck it's worth
[49:47] a million bucks
[49:49] and you look at all the young couples
[49:50] getting married today well we had bought
[49:51] a house the first year we were married
[49:53] it's like well you know yeah i've got
[49:56] 300 000
[49:57] in the bank and i can't find a house i
[49:58] can afford
[50:00] right and it puts pressure on young
[50:02] families to
[50:03] buy to build to have this and to have
[50:05] that and stigmas placed upon families
[50:07] that
[50:08] uh even in certain zip codes where they
[50:10] have to live in basement suites i know
[50:11] we don't know what those are here
[50:12] but there's there's places you have to
[50:14] live why because the economy won't allow
[50:16] for it i don't make enough money
[50:17] to buy a house right pressure
[50:21] but if you could find contentment with
[50:23] the basement suite if you find
[50:24] contentment with a rental house you find
[50:25] contentment in the apartment complex
[50:27] then that there's true happiness in that
[50:30] and not feeling like you're a failure
[50:31] and you're less spiritual and you
[50:33] haven't been a good steward of your
[50:34] money
[50:34] because you weren't able to capitalize
[50:36] on market conditions that existed 13
[50:38] years ago
[50:41] there's inequalities that exist i know
[50:43] we get all tense up and we talk about
[50:44] injustice and inequalities but you know
[50:46] a lot of us need to relax on that
[50:48] because there's true inequality in the
[50:50] world
[50:51] there's inequity there's un injustice
[50:54] that exist hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 he
[50:59] says let your conversation be without
[51:01] covetousness
[51:03] don't be jealous don't don't desire
[51:05] don't be this
[51:07] this greed and be content with such
[51:10] things as you have
[51:12] for he hath said i will never leave thee
[51:13] nor forsake thee amen
[51:16] this lack of contentment soft living the
[51:17] pressure of riches
[51:19] drives us to consume more than we can
[51:21] actually enjoy
[51:23] the real danger i want to just maybe
[51:24] introduce introduce this
[51:26] thought it drives us to buy much more
[51:28] than we can afford
[51:33] paul says not that i speak in respect of
[51:35] want for i have learned in whatsoever
[51:37] state i am therewith to be content
[51:39] philippians 4 11.
[51:40] whatsoever state i am in i'm content
[51:44] there's a saying that says a contented
[51:45] mind is a continual feast
[51:48] if your mind is happy you can feed on
[51:50] that contented mind is spirit always
[51:54] a nourishment a contented mind is health
[51:57] to your bones it's satisfied it lifts
[51:58] you up
[51:59] finding self-sufficiency in the
[52:01] sufficiency of christ
[52:02] is real contentment that in him and
[52:05] christ i can do all things as he tells
[52:07] the philippians
[52:08] i can do all things through christ that
[52:09] strengthens me be content with such
[52:11] things as you have
[52:12] i speak not in the state of want but
[52:14] whatsoever state i am in be content
[52:17] paul through trial and through testing
[52:19] had found contentment despite poverty
[52:21] and persecution
[52:23] he found it despite poverty and even
[52:25] prosperity he had found
[52:27] true contentment notice he wasn't
[52:29] restless
[52:31] if he had prosperity he wasn't restless
[52:33] if he was poor
[52:34] he wasn't restless he managed to accept
[52:36] what he had
[52:37] and find contentment in it
[52:40] be content with such things as you have
[52:42] for i will
[52:44] listen to that for he hath said i will
[52:46] never leave thee nor forsake thee
[52:49] now that's kind of an odd statement but
[52:52] it's it's expressed in this context for
[52:54] us to realize
[52:55] this is what discontent draws us away
[52:58] from
[52:59] that there's a way of finding
[53:00] satisfaction in i will never leave thee
[53:03] nor forsake thee that if i have him i'm
[53:05] wealthy if i have him i have health if i
[53:07] have him
[53:08] i have what satisfies this i actually
[53:10] have the one who can provide
[53:12] that if i have him that i have then i
[53:14] truly do not have need of anything other
[53:16] than a greater
[53:17] yielding to him so if i'm not satisfied
[53:20] if i have covetousness if i have greed
[53:22] if i have a lust for more and i'm not
[53:24] con content with what i have
[53:25] then i've somehow been pulled away from
[53:27] the fact that he says i'm right here
[53:30] i'm with you i got this i will never
[53:33] leave thee nor forsake thee to be
[53:34] discontent to have this
[53:36] insatiable appetite to be driven by
[53:38] greed draws us away from
[53:40] his presence benjamin franklin said
[53:43] money never made a man happy yet nor
[53:45] will it
[53:46] there's nothing in its nature to produce
[53:49] happiness
[53:50] the more a man has the more he wants
[53:53] instead of it's feeling a vacuum it
[53:54] makes one
[53:58] this that whole this whole analogy that
[54:01] brother franklin is expressing to us
[54:07] instead of filling a vacuum it creates a
[54:09] new one
[54:12] it satisfies one watt want it doubles
[54:15] and travels
[54:15] that want another way
[54:19] think of that money has never made a man
[54:21] happy yet
[54:24] there's actually nothing in the nature
[54:26] of money
[54:27] to produce happiness because the more
[54:30] you have the more you want
[54:32] instead of avoid being filled it's
[54:34] created another void
[54:36] if it does satisfy one thing it triples
[54:39] the want
[54:40] in another way it'll actually triple the
[54:42] need in that
[54:43] in some other sense it's exactly with
[54:46] the scripture ecclesiastes chapter 5
[54:48] verses 10 to 14 he that loveth silver
[54:50] shall not be satisfied with silver nor
[54:52] he that loveth abundance with increase
[54:54] this is also vanity
[54:55] if you love silver silver is never going
[54:57] to satisfy you
[54:58] if you love money if you love abundance
[55:00] if you love increase you're never
[55:01] actually going to be satisfied with
[55:03] increase why
[55:03] because you're going to want more
[55:05] increase this is how lust is never
[55:07] satisfied it's a switch that's never
[55:09] turned off
[55:10] it's only it only loses its emphasis in
[55:13] the moment but it's always gonna be
[55:14] there driving you when goods increase
[55:16] they are increased that eat them listen
[55:18] this is bible this is the word letting
[55:21] us know these are the dangers to giving
[55:23] ourselves over to the flesh
[55:24] and not being driven and guided by
[55:26] revelation and spiritual discernment
[55:28] that when goods increase you only
[55:30] increase the taking
[55:31] of them and partaking of them what good
[55:33] is there to the owners thereof saving
[55:35] the beholding of them with their eyes
[55:38] oh look at what all i have because
[55:40] that's all it's good for
[55:41] the sleep of a laboring man is sweet
[55:44] whether he eat little or much
[55:46] if it's gotten by honestly if you're
[55:49] satisfied with what your labor produces
[55:51] when you the sleep of that man he rests
[55:53] easy why he's content
[55:55] but the abundance of the rich will make
[55:57] not will not suffer him to sleep he
[56:00] won't rest there's no contentment
[56:02] there's always this drive in him
[56:05] there is a sore evil which i have seen
[56:07] under the sun namely riches
[56:08] kept for the owners thereof to their
[56:10] hurt but those riches perished by evil
[56:13] travail by misfortune by bad things
[56:15] happening and he began at the sun and
[56:16] there's nothing in his hand
[56:18] knows there's nothing to pass down
[56:20] there's nothing to leave
[56:22] spend your whole life trying to
[56:23] accumulate wealth and then the moment
[56:25] it's all taken away and then you have
[56:26] nothing to leave your children
[56:28] but had you spent time in having
[56:32] christ-like character
[56:34] produced in your life that's something
[56:36] your children can benefit from
[56:38] through misfortune it's saying wealth
[56:40] can be lost but character and integrity
[56:42] cannot be lost through misfortune only
[56:44] increased
[56:47] saying if you love silver silver won't
[56:49] satisfy if you love abundance with
[56:51] increase
[56:52] it it's not going to be satisfied
[56:56] when your abundance is increased goods
[56:58] increase you just increase the
[56:59] consumption of it
[57:02] just gets right down into the psychology
[57:04] of man the way his mind thinks the way
[57:06] that he acts
[57:09] these are the transactions that man
[57:11] thinks he's going to give him pleasure
[57:14] so i ask you what kind of transactions
[57:17] are we engaging in
[57:20] which ones have the greater preeminence
[57:22] brother braham says the city of laodicea
[57:24] was a wealthy city
[57:26] it minted gold coins with inscriptions
[57:28] on both sides
[57:29] gold coins characterized the age so a
[57:32] gold coin which represents the ability
[57:34] to acquire
[57:35] or to consume the gold representing
[57:38] wealth or some sort of asset where
[57:40] there's a barter there's an exchange
[57:41] some sort of commerce
[57:42] where me having some asset a gold coin
[57:44] and scripted on two sides and it
[57:46] represents this gold which represents
[57:48] purchasing power
[57:49] in the ability then present to achieve
[57:51] to acquire something you have
[57:53] the ability to consume whether it be
[57:54] food or raiment or clothing material
[57:56] possessions
[57:57] he's this is representative and
[57:58] indicative of that city laodicea
[58:00] that is now representative in a type of
[58:03] the condition of the age that we live in
[58:04] he says
[58:05] a flourishing commerce existed because
[58:07] of it
[58:09] because of the ability to acquire
[58:11] because man's appetite for it that
[58:13] knowing that you had gold and you wanted
[58:15] something else
[58:16] i could produce something that you would
[58:18] use exchange
[58:19] for what i have and i would get your
[58:21] gold and then i could use your gold to
[58:23] get something else i wanted
[58:26] nobody was satisfied alone in their own
[58:27] production and they weren't
[58:28] self-sufficient and just living off the
[58:30] land
[58:31] and having food and clothing being happy
[58:33] they had to devise
[58:34] ways that man wanted this so i could
[58:36] capitalize upon man's greed and
[58:38] man is always seeking after this so it's
[58:40] not just a matter of meeting a need
[58:41] but capitalizing on the wants and needs
[58:43] of others to my own
[58:45] gain and greedy gain
[58:48] not just so that i could have food and
[58:49] clothing but so that i could acquire
[58:51] wealth and accumulate
[58:53] more buying power since the flourishing
[58:56] commerce existed because of it today
[58:58] now notice how it brings right down to
[59:00] what we're living today the two-headed
[59:02] gold coin is with us
[59:03] we buy ourselves out and we buy
[59:05] ourselves in
[59:07] this applies on a spiritual level
[59:10] absolutely this is where brother branham
[59:12] brings it to its ultimate
[59:14] uh application but i'm speaking to those
[59:17] that i believe god
[59:18] they have escaped according to
[59:20] revelations 18 4.
[59:22] they've left that spiritual climate in
[59:25] dogmas and creeds and personality and
[59:28] politics and false doctrine
[59:29] and all this religion and you've come to
[59:31] seek christ and just worship at his feet
[59:33] and
[59:35] abandoning systems and ideologies and
[59:37] you're worshiping
[59:39] god and truth and now we can begin to
[59:41] look at ourselves
[59:42] with me in this economy of god's word
[59:45] and wanting to serve him in light of
[59:47] truth
[59:47] there's still these things that try to
[59:49] press in on us
[59:50] still living in the age that's
[59:52] characterized by a flourishing commerce
[59:54] the two-headed gold coin is still with
[59:56] us we buy ourselves out and we buy
[59:58] ourselves in
[59:59] what are the thorns and thistles that
[1:00:01] are wanting to choke out the word seed
[1:00:02] that's sewn into your life
[1:00:04] and it may not be a false doctrine
[1:00:06] related to the godhead it may not be a
[1:00:08] false doctrine related to the church
[1:00:09] going through the tribulation it may not
[1:00:10] be a false doctrine related to a false
[1:00:12] prophet
[1:00:12] it may not be those things but it may be
[1:00:14] the lust of other things entering in
[1:00:18] listen to some of these statistics
[1:00:20] americans spend more than 1.2 trillion
[1:00:23] dollars a year on non-essential things
[1:00:26] it's just americans if you're not
[1:00:28] american you can say a man even louder
[1:00:30] spend over 1.2 trillion dollars a year
[1:00:34] on things that are not needed
[1:00:35] unnecessary items the average u.s person
[1:00:39] now consumes twice as much as they did
[1:00:41] 50 years ago
[1:00:42] this was in the year 2000 i haven't been
[1:00:44] able to find a calculation
[1:00:45] that quantifies it now
[1:00:49] so 70 years ago we probably consumed
[1:00:54] three times as much as they did before
[1:00:57] why
[1:00:57] why do we do that why is this so
[1:01:03] it's that commerce it's greed
[1:01:08] each one of us in the united states are
[1:01:10] targeted with more than 6
[1:01:11] 000 advertisements a day
[1:01:15] you say that's impossible start counting
[1:01:19] and within an hour you'll get so tired
[1:01:20] you'll be like you know what yeah i'm
[1:01:22] willing to think that that's probably
[1:01:23] right
[1:01:24] you'll count hundreds before you get out
[1:01:26] the door
[1:01:29] marketing logos slogans phrases even
[1:01:32] from the cereal box to your coffee
[1:01:34] we are bombarded with over six thousand
[1:01:36] i see up to ten thousand
[1:01:38] advertisements a day
[1:01:41] we see more advertisements in one year
[1:01:43] now
[1:01:44] than people 50 years ago saw in their
[1:01:46] entire lifetime
[1:01:48] in one year we will be bombarded with
[1:01:50] more advertisements saying hey buy this
[1:01:52] hey experience that hey you should have
[1:01:54] this hey you still own that that's lousy
[1:01:56] you should own this
[1:01:57] we're bombarded with more of that in one
[1:01:59] year than people who live
[1:02:01] 50 years ago would their entire lives
[1:02:04] live the 81 years that man was expected
[1:02:06] to live then and they would see
[1:02:08] so many advertisements in one year you
[1:02:10] see more than they ever saw in their
[1:02:12] lives
[1:02:15] could you imagine what would happen if
[1:02:17] you gave them a phone and they sat in
[1:02:18] front of a tv with infomercials all day
[1:02:23] oh my goodness never heard of such
[1:02:25] amazing things
[1:02:30] and a book by annie leonard nobody that
[1:02:32] i think you need to pursue or follow on
[1:02:34] twitter i don't know she just wrote a
[1:02:35] book called the story of stuff
[1:02:38] it says what is the point of an
[1:02:39] advertisement or an ad
[1:02:41] except to make us unhappy with what we
[1:02:43] have
[1:02:47] so three thou three thousand times a day
[1:02:50] or we could even say six thousand ten
[1:02:51] thousand times a day
[1:02:52] we're told that our hair is wrong our
[1:02:54] skin is wrong our clothes are wrong our
[1:02:56] furniture's wrong our cars are wrong and
[1:02:58] we are wrong
[1:03:00] right we're told and bombarded that
[1:03:04] advertisement's doing that everybody the
[1:03:06] world's doing everyone's doing it so
[1:03:07] let's not
[1:03:07] do that to each other
[1:03:13] he says in verse 11 that if you will
[1:03:15] come back to the word i will rebuke
[1:03:17] the devourer for your sakes you shall
[1:03:20] not destroy the fruits of your ground
[1:03:21] either shall your vine cast a fruit
[1:03:23] before the time in the field
[1:03:24] saying that in other words your labor
[1:03:25] will be fruitful it will be sufficient
[1:03:28] you'll be able to enjoy it and i will
[1:03:29] rebuke the devourer the devourer there
[1:03:31] the word that
[1:03:32] literally means consumer i will rebuke
[1:03:35] the consumer i will destroy god will
[1:03:37] destroy the consumer
[1:03:38] and i will bless the fruits of your
[1:03:40] labor you will find greater happiness
[1:03:41] when you obey my word the rebuke
[1:03:44] there's a rebuke to the consumer there's
[1:03:45] a restriction of the consumer there's a
[1:03:47] restricting of the devour
[1:03:48] i will take this spiritual consumption
[1:03:51] that is fed by my discontentment
[1:03:52] i will take that and i will destroy and
[1:03:54] i'll rebuke it so that you can find true
[1:03:56] happiness
[1:03:58] i will rebuke the consumer the consumer
[1:04:00] out there the consumer in me
[1:04:02] the things that swallow up our income
[1:04:04] the things that devour our assets
[1:04:06] there's a principle in the word of god
[1:04:08] that says if you put me first and you
[1:04:09] give me
[1:04:10] the the the the discipline or the
[1:04:13] obedience is the word i'm looking for
[1:04:14] give me obedience and serve me then even
[1:04:17] the desire within yourself will be
[1:04:19] reviewed
[1:04:19] and even the things that eat away at
[1:04:21] your health and the things that
[1:04:23] eat away at your assets they'll also be
[1:04:24] rebuked
[1:04:27] our economy is built upon constant
[1:04:28] consumption
[1:04:30] continuous continuous unending upgrade
[1:04:33] cycles
[1:04:36] there's a phrase called conspicuous
[1:04:37] consumption
[1:04:39] it's the uh
[1:04:43] the extravagant lavish spending on goods
[1:04:46] and services
[1:04:48] that you do solely for the purpose of
[1:04:50] displaying that you've got the
[1:04:52] money to do it conspicuous consumption
[1:04:55] is buying things so that people know
[1:04:58] why is it that uh that a lot of brands
[1:05:01] at a particular price point
[1:05:03] put their logo all over it
[1:05:06] right because you're willing to spend
[1:05:09] that much money on that
[1:05:11] so that people know you spent that much
[1:05:14] money on that
[1:05:16] when sometimes the things that are most
[1:05:18] expensive
[1:05:20] and have the greatest quality to them
[1:05:22] you would never even know it
[1:05:23] because it's not geared towards the
[1:05:25] people who could never afford it but
[1:05:26] still pay for it pay for it because they
[1:05:28] want you to know they did
[1:05:30] think about it there's a lot of things
[1:05:32] we spend a lot of money for that
[1:05:34] tells everybody that we bought it when
[1:05:36] there's things that if you really have
[1:05:37] the money to afford it you'd be fine
[1:05:39] buying it and everyone no one would need
[1:05:41] to know
[1:05:42] that those shoes are fifteen hundred
[1:05:44] dollars
[1:05:45] right or that purse is seven hundred
[1:05:48] dollars
[1:05:50] like it's called conspicuous consumption
[1:05:52] things that you buy for the purpose of
[1:05:54] displaying how much wealth you have
[1:05:56] it's the condition of the age planned
[1:05:58] obsolescence
[1:06:03] where things are you buy something and
[1:06:05] they've already programmed
[1:06:07] or are placed built within the
[1:06:11] technology itself that it's going to
[1:06:12] become obsolete
[1:06:14] it's a policy of developing a product
[1:06:16] with an artificially limited life
[1:06:18] in order to generate long-term sales
[1:06:20] volume
[1:06:22] so you shorten the replacement cycle
[1:06:25] they plan the obsolescence in other
[1:06:27] words like you're going to buy this
[1:06:28] phone
[1:06:29] and in a year we're going to have a new
[1:06:30] one and you might be on the fence i
[1:06:32] don't know if i want to buy a new one
[1:06:33] but in two years
[1:06:34] it's already built within itself to
[1:06:36] where you're going to have a degraded
[1:06:37] experience with the product
[1:06:38] and you're going to want to shorten the
[1:06:40] replacement cycle and go out and get
[1:06:41] something else
[1:06:42] i'm using phones because they're an easy
[1:06:43] target but it's like this with a lot of
[1:06:45] things
[1:06:46] it's planned that way so that you're
[1:06:48] constantly in the cycle
[1:06:50] the constant upgrade cycle the constant
[1:06:52] cycle of buying and replacing buying and
[1:06:54] replacing
[1:06:55] and the worst is not just the planned
[1:06:57] obsolescence but the perceived
[1:06:58] obsolescence
[1:06:59] where we are caused to believe that it's
[1:07:01] obsolete so we've got to replace it
[1:07:04] when in reality that nokia flip phone
[1:07:08] that motorola that you're you still have
[1:07:09] in the drawer will make phone calls just
[1:07:12] as good as the one you've got if not
[1:07:13] better
[1:07:21] we're in the habit and practice of
[1:07:22] consumerism
[1:07:25] and since it's such a habit i want you
[1:07:27] to ponder this it draws us
[1:07:29] into following certain social norms
[1:07:32] that are driven by consumerism
[1:07:35] and i i i want to i want to say this in
[1:07:37] a way of just provoking thought
[1:07:40] if god can awaken you to habits
[1:07:44] and dis you know uh the practices
[1:07:47] of doing certain things that have been
[1:07:50] achieved in your life by merely drawing
[1:07:52] you into
[1:07:52] the social norms and you could realize
[1:07:56] i am only doing this because kind of
[1:07:59] just the weight of the world the
[1:08:00] movement of everybody else this is what
[1:08:02] everyone else was doing
[1:08:03] and i didn't see anything wrong with it
[1:08:04] in its place but do i really need to be
[1:08:07] doing this
[1:08:09] what where what dominoes are falling
[1:08:11] when this is happening
[1:08:14] and maybe in another way i wish i would
[1:08:15] have probably uh maybe prepared this
[1:08:17] thought a little bit more
[1:08:18] uh diligently but we've heard of a siren
[1:08:20] song
[1:08:22] and we're hearing the siren song and it
[1:08:24] it's drawn it's all this seems so
[1:08:27] wonderful but what does it end up in
[1:08:29] death
[1:08:30] it's horrible it's really ugly it's
[1:08:32] awful but it's it's a siren song of oh
[1:08:34] this is going to be so good and this is
[1:08:36] everyone else is do it and this is going
[1:08:37] to be
[1:08:38] this is going to solve all your problems
[1:08:39] it's a siren song that leads to
[1:08:41] destruction so we read a statement from
[1:08:45] the journal of retelling
[1:08:47] that's not retelling as in you know
[1:08:49] spreading a rumor but retailing like
[1:08:51] retail
[1:08:52] shopping the journal of retelling that
[1:08:54] was in 1955 listen to what brother
[1:08:56] branham says in 1958
[1:08:58] will the church go before the
[1:08:59] tribulation the answer is yes the bride
[1:09:01] will in the days of lot they were eating
[1:09:03] drinking mary and given in marriage
[1:09:05] planting building
[1:09:06] selling buying remember how we're using
[1:09:09] this
[1:09:09] luke 17 30 even as our basis for this
[1:09:12] this thought on revelation resolves
[1:09:13] complication
[1:09:14] oh there never was a day that so much
[1:09:17] commercial
[1:09:17] as today just use car lots and
[1:09:20] everything so much to you can buy a
[1:09:22] refrigerator this year and pay about
[1:09:23] four or five hundred dollars for it
[1:09:25] and next year nobody wants it it's out
[1:09:27] of style
[1:09:29] brother branham would be amazed to know
[1:09:31] that that price is cheap for cell phones
[1:09:33] now
[1:09:35] that this is applicable to the phones we
[1:09:37] carry in our pockets not these gigantic
[1:09:39] refrigerators
[1:09:40] that would sit in our kitchens now it's
[1:09:43] true of a device that you slide into
[1:09:45] your pocket or into your purse
[1:09:48] oh my goodness
[1:09:52] he says it's out of style don't you see
[1:09:54] where the commercial world has your nose
[1:09:56] to the grind will
[1:09:58] don't you see it this is your
[1:09:59] opportunity to take a step back and say
[1:10:01] lord give wake me up give me some wisdom
[1:10:03] to understand give me some spiritual
[1:10:04] discernment
[1:10:05] where is it in my life that yes i thank
[1:10:07] god i'm not out in the world sinning i'm
[1:10:09] not pursuing drugs and alcohol and women
[1:10:11] and
[1:10:11] i'm not i'm not in the this air in my
[1:10:14] the
[1:10:14] my i'm not into all this mixed up stuff
[1:10:16] but lord i'm trying to serve you
[1:10:18] but lord am i getting my face pressed
[1:10:20] into the grindstone
[1:10:21] is there a place where i'm getting away
[1:10:23] from i'll never leave thee nor forsake
[1:10:25] thee
[1:10:25] if i got into a place where i'm more
[1:10:27] dependent upon the economies
[1:10:29] and the social things and the
[1:10:30] entertainments of this world instead of
[1:10:31] finding rest in you
[1:10:34] don't you see where the commercial world
[1:10:35] has your nose to the grind wheel you can
[1:10:37] buy a car
[1:10:38] this year and next year it's probably as
[1:10:39] good as the one you could buy then
[1:10:41] it'll depreciate a thousand dollars
[1:10:42] because they changed the radiator cap
[1:10:46] come on somebody hello what is it all to
[1:10:50] think preachers do to get amens
[1:10:52] maybe i need to start coming up with
[1:10:56] them
[1:10:59] change the radiator cap or they've done
[1:11:01] some little silly something to it
[1:11:10] i'm going to wait till everybody says
[1:11:11] amen it's so
[1:11:13] true so true everybody instinctively hey
[1:11:16] man get keep going
[1:11:20] it's only a sales talk to fulfill the
[1:11:22] bible as it was in the days of no one in
[1:11:24] the days of love
[1:11:26] this consumerist world the sales talk
[1:11:30] the planned obsolescence the perceived
[1:11:33] obsolescence the conspicuous consumption
[1:11:36] this leisure spending all these things
[1:11:39] it's fulfillment of prophecy luke 17.
[1:11:43] you're looking at the fulfillment of
[1:11:44] prophecy over there what about the
[1:11:46] homosexual agenda what about this
[1:11:47] okay fine you want to talk about that
[1:11:50] because you don't fight with that
[1:11:54] is that why you want to talk about it
[1:11:55] because we can look it down on them
[1:11:58] right and we can say whatever we want
[1:12:00] about them we can cast them as evil and
[1:12:02] we can
[1:12:02] we can try to make them feel inferior
[1:12:05] because there's nothing wrong with us
[1:12:06] right
[1:12:09] as you drink your eight dollar latte
[1:12:13] right think about it there's a lot of
[1:12:15] things that's really easy to harp on and
[1:12:17] talk about
[1:12:18] when our our goal is to not feel better
[1:12:20] about ourselves because we make
[1:12:22] everybody else look bad
[1:12:24] but i want contentment in christ i want
[1:12:26] to cause i'm still holding my latte
[1:12:28] we want to come to the place where we're
[1:12:29] just accepting his grace for us we're
[1:12:31] falling in love with his word
[1:12:32] he means more to us than these other
[1:12:34] things and then we look at somebody who
[1:12:35] is insane we're like you know what
[1:12:36] there's a place of rest
[1:12:39] i found a joy i'm not i i haven't found
[1:12:41] an axe to grind i haven't found
[1:12:43] a platform and a political ideology that
[1:12:45] allows me to hate everybody else so i
[1:12:47] can feel good about myself but i found a
[1:12:48] love that you too can
[1:12:50] participate in and find freedom and
[1:12:52] liberty and satisfaction
[1:12:54] i found a joy that delivered me from
[1:12:57] suicidal thoughts i found a joy that
[1:12:58] delivered me from
[1:13:00] anxiety and depression i found a joy
[1:13:02] that delivered me from feeling
[1:13:04] absolutely devastated in crowds i found
[1:13:06] something that
[1:13:07] i where i belonged and i wasn't confused
[1:13:09] anymore about who i was
[1:13:12] it's a love and a joy that you could
[1:13:13] share
[1:13:15] and what does brother branham say it's
[1:13:16] only a sales talk to fulfill the bible
[1:13:18] what this consumerism the commercial
[1:13:20] world
[1:13:21] a commercial day the mindset and
[1:13:24] attitude
[1:13:26] of this age to lust
[1:13:29] for the wrong things because they have
[1:13:31] the wrong knowledge
[1:13:33] this desire for wealth a desire for
[1:13:35] wealthy goods
[1:13:36] in proverbs chapter 15 verse 27.
[1:13:47] brother ellie mentioned today he goes
[1:13:50] brother aaron the
[1:13:51] the stream used to have the stream to
[1:13:52] where you could see the quotes and
[1:13:54] scriptures when you were preaching
[1:13:56] i said we're wanting to make it harder
[1:13:57] to stream so you just come here
[1:14:01] so you feel like you're missing out we
[1:14:02] just need to come because
[1:14:04] streaming is no replacement for this
[1:14:13] what i was going to have brother john do
[1:14:14] is just go cycle through all the way to
[1:14:15] the end just
[1:14:16] real quick so you can see there's just
[1:14:17] there's a limited number of slides today
[1:14:19] this is what we have left just
[1:14:21] bounce through it real quick get all the
[1:14:22] way to james one say look he's got a few
[1:14:24] more slides left
[1:14:25] we're almost there look at that that's
[1:14:27] the end see
[1:14:29] so let's just go back to proverbs 15.
[1:14:30] we're almost at the end
[1:14:32] you're like yeah brother aaron but you
[1:14:33] used that number of slides in the first
[1:14:34] hour and i'm like fine you're right
[1:14:37] i get it but i really feel like i'm
[1:14:38] coming to an end here
[1:14:40] proverbs chapter 15 verse 27 he that is
[1:14:43] greedy of gain troubleth his own house
[1:14:48] there's areas that our house becomes
[1:14:49] troubled our children become afflicted
[1:14:51] our marriages suffer and things become
[1:14:53] weak
[1:14:53] because we're greedy of great gain and
[1:14:55] if you're greedy of gain it troubles
[1:14:56] your own house
[1:14:59] it was seneca the younger the
[1:15:01] philosopher who said it is not the man
[1:15:03] who has too little but the man who
[1:15:04] craves more that is poor
[1:15:07] the poor man isn't the one that has
[1:15:08] little it's the man who wants more
[1:15:10] the man who craves more he's the poor
[1:15:12] man the man who has a little and he's
[1:15:14] happy
[1:15:15] it's better to have a little and and
[1:15:17] have righteousness you're content with
[1:15:19] what you have that's not a poor man
[1:15:20] you find somebody oh he drives an old
[1:15:22] model car and he doesn't have a new cell
[1:15:24] phone and
[1:15:25] he he makes this much an hour and this
[1:15:26] that cast i say all you want about those
[1:15:28] people say all you want about what they
[1:15:29] wear
[1:15:30] and what they do well they're not you
[1:15:31] know they don't go on vacations right
[1:15:34] say oh what you want about them but if
[1:15:35] they're happy they're not the poor one
[1:15:38] you are because you're not happy with
[1:15:40] what you have the poor man is not the
[1:15:42] one who has a little but it's the man
[1:15:43] who craves more that's the poor man
[1:15:45] why that troubles the house it robs it
[1:15:47] of its peace it removes the strength and
[1:15:49] the stability of a home
[1:15:50] if you're greedy for gain if you have
[1:15:52] this lust if you want to acquire
[1:15:53] it troubles a house not just the
[1:15:55] physical address and the walls are
[1:15:57] shaking
[1:15:58] but what could be a home is merely just
[1:16:00] a place to sleep
[1:16:02] what could be a real marriage is just a
[1:16:04] contractual relationship
[1:16:08] jesus says in matthew chapter 6 verses
[1:16:09] 19 to 21
[1:16:12] he's saying lay up your treasures in
[1:16:13] heaven verse 20.
[1:16:15] for where you're verse 21 where your
[1:16:17] treasure is there will your heart be
[1:16:19] also
[1:16:20] lay up your treasures in heaven seek ye
[1:16:23] first the kingdom of god in his
[1:16:25] righteousness
[1:16:26] don't just accumulate treasures upon
[1:16:28] earth that can be destroyed and corrupt
[1:16:30] and
[1:16:31] can be stolen
[1:16:36] but there's something spiritual as
[1:16:38] laodicea had come to the place where
[1:16:40] their transactions were no longer
[1:16:41] spiritual
[1:16:42] i'm wanting to encourage you to have
[1:16:45] more spiritual transactions
[1:16:49] the saying is home is where the heart is
[1:16:52] the bible says where your treasure is
[1:16:53] there will your heart be also
[1:16:59] home they actually say of home it's the
[1:17:01] place where you have your deepest
[1:17:02] affection and emotional pull and it's
[1:17:05] sad to say that some of us have found
[1:17:07] quote unquote home in the wrong things
[1:17:12] where your treasure is it's that place
[1:17:16] where good and precious things are
[1:17:18] collected you take these treasures
[1:17:19] precious things collected stored where
[1:17:21] your treasure is
[1:17:23] that's where your hearts gonna be
[1:17:25] wherever you're storing up things
[1:17:28] that's where your heart's gonna be your
[1:17:30] ambition your mind
[1:17:31] your protection mechanisms your
[1:17:33] instincts if you treasure
[1:17:35] social relationships if god's ever
[1:17:37] calling you to a decision that you know
[1:17:39] you're going to lose them
[1:17:40] you'll not obey you'll snot too when you
[1:17:43] cry over it you'll not
[1:17:44] obey because you want to protect these
[1:17:47] social relationships
[1:17:50] because you value it more than serving
[1:17:52] god
[1:17:54] i know i can't do it i'll lose too much
[1:17:55] i can't no no i'm afraid to do it why
[1:17:57] where your heart is where your treasure
[1:17:58] is that's where your heart is what you
[1:18:00] value
[1:18:00] in your about what you think is most
[1:18:02] important what you think is what you
[1:18:03] should have and the the pretense and the
[1:18:05] personality whatever it might be even
[1:18:07] the money and the possessions well if i
[1:18:09] do that i'll have to get rid of this or
[1:18:10] this
[1:18:10] that happens that's why your heir
[1:18:12] discipline your protection
[1:18:14] your instincts will be to preserve this
[1:18:16] wealth
[1:18:19] to preserve this prestige and be instead
[1:18:21] of being willing to lose it all to serve
[1:18:23] him
[1:18:24] because i find greater value in christ
[1:18:26] it's a greater treasure than all the
[1:18:28] riches of egypt and laodicea
[1:18:32] the bible says in proverbs chapter 24
[1:18:34] verses 3 to 4
[1:18:36] now that i've laid my foundation let me
[1:18:39] get my notes out
[1:18:42] with that as a foundation ponder our
[1:18:44] text through wisdom as a house building
[1:18:47] and by understanding it is established
[1:18:49] if you're greedy of gain you trouble
[1:18:51] your house
[1:18:52] so what's the answer for greedy for gain
[1:18:54] if we have all these emotional
[1:18:55] mechanisms these heuristics and biases
[1:18:57] and
[1:18:58] emotional pulls and consumers and my
[1:18:59] noses to the grindstone
[1:19:01] i'm addicted to technology or i have
[1:19:02] this wand i have this desire
[1:19:04] i have even these physiological things
[1:19:06] that society has imposed upon me where i
[1:19:08] have to have this and i have to have
[1:19:09] that
[1:19:11] they've watched grown men cry years ago
[1:19:13] i don't know if anybody remembers
[1:19:14] blackberries
[1:19:16] they're not talking about a cobbler or a
[1:19:17] smoothie at nectar we're talking about
[1:19:19] the phone blackberry they actually did
[1:19:22] did studies where they took the
[1:19:23] blackberry away from these businessmen
[1:19:25] and they cried and they shook and they
[1:19:28] couldn't imagine
[1:19:29] life without the trackball
[1:19:33] they couldn't imagine well how am i
[1:19:34] going to live without that device you
[1:19:36] know what we've gotten way beyond that
[1:19:37] now
[1:19:40] it says through wisdom as a house
[1:19:41] builder by understanding it is
[1:19:43] established and by knowledge shall the
[1:19:44] chambers be filled with all precious
[1:19:47] and pleasant riches you want to make
[1:19:49] your house a home
[1:19:50] start here
[1:19:54] you want to make your marriage a real
[1:19:55] relationship start here
[1:19:58] you want to you want to build a church
[1:20:00] the right way let's start here
[1:20:04] let's not put all our energy and effort
[1:20:05] in just finding a better building where
[1:20:06] we can meet
[1:20:08] but let's make the most of our meetings
[1:20:10] let's make the most of our relationships
[1:20:13] let's make the most of what god is
[1:20:14] wanting calling us to do that's way
[1:20:16] beyond where we meet
[1:20:18] it's about a meeting but one in the air
[1:20:22] and that's what we give ourselves over
[1:20:23] to that's what has the preeminence that
[1:20:24] we can take
[1:20:25] through wisdom build a house to
[1:20:26] understand and establish it and make it
[1:20:28] sure and strong
[1:20:29] and by knowledge fill it up with the
[1:20:30] right things
[1:20:33] talk about a different buying power
[1:20:36] a totally different economy
[1:20:39] commerce and consumerism and all these
[1:20:41] other things and spending god says come
[1:20:43] by of me your transactions are totally
[1:20:45] carnal but come
[1:20:46] by of me and through that kind of
[1:20:48] transaction through that kind of
[1:20:50] exchange
[1:20:50] we can fill our lives up with real
[1:20:52] riches
[1:20:53] pleasant riches not deceitful riches
[1:20:57] things that really add value spiritually
[1:21:00] not just materially
[1:21:02] really takes the edge off when there's
[1:21:04] certain natural transactions that don't
[1:21:06] quite work out the way that you want
[1:21:08] them to and you realize you know what
[1:21:09] god did that for a reason
[1:21:14] the fear of the lord is the beginning of
[1:21:15] wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is
[1:21:18] understanding
[1:21:20] if the fear of the lord is the beginning
[1:21:21] of wisdom then we must first respect
[1:21:23] reverence fear god and keep his
[1:21:26] commandments in order for the house to
[1:21:27] be built
[1:21:29] by wisdom is a house built by
[1:21:30] understanding knowledge of the holy
[1:21:32] knowledge of the divine is understanding
[1:21:34] there's only through revelation of god
[1:21:36] and understanding of his word can we
[1:21:37] really establish and make our house
[1:21:40] strong
[1:21:43] and by knowledge shall the chambers be
[1:21:44] filled
[1:21:46] don't you want your house to be filled
[1:21:49] not with clutter
[1:21:50] not with things but with precious things
[1:21:55] precious and pleasant riches
[1:21:59] it's by revelation that we want to fill
[1:22:01] our house with enjoyable riches
[1:22:04] to know christ to know christ to pursue
[1:22:08] him
[1:22:08] that's what revelation it puts you in
[1:22:11] the mode of
[1:22:12] pursuing him
[1:22:15] but my brother loyal if you could come
[1:22:18] we have these two scriptures that remain
[1:22:20] ephesians 1 17.
[1:22:24] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[1:22:30] the father of glory may give unto you
[1:22:32] the spirit of wisdom
[1:22:34] in revelation in the knowledge
[1:22:37] of him the spirit of wisdom and
[1:22:39] revelation that gives you this deep
[1:22:41] personal insight into christ
[1:22:45] this mind of christ to know what he
[1:22:46] wants done with the word
[1:22:48] the humility of christ to take a step
[1:22:50] back from things that at the end of the
[1:22:52] day increase
[1:22:52] vanity and only serve to satisfy the
[1:22:56] flesh at the detriment of your
[1:22:57] relationship to christ
[1:22:59] not everything that our flesh enjoys is
[1:23:01] a detriment
[1:23:02] but we ought we have to have discernment
[1:23:04] to know that there's things that have
[1:23:07] our nose to the grindstone
[1:23:09] there's consumerism that has actually
[1:23:11] consumed us and he makes the promise
[1:23:14] and it does bring it back to simplicity
[1:23:16] do as my word commands
[1:23:17] obey me call upon me i thought i'd have
[1:23:20] the scripture in here
[1:23:22] well there it is it's james chapter one
[1:23:23] i i forgot that this was in here we got
[1:23:25] to come to this place
[1:23:27] where in our hearts we begin to say god
[1:23:29] i need you
[1:23:32] and i need to have the right kind of
[1:23:34] wisdom and revelation i need the right
[1:23:36] kind of insight into what's beneficial
[1:23:39] i must have spiritual discernment
[1:23:43] i i i will say this with honesty
[1:23:50] that i know how overwhelming it can be
[1:23:54] to look at everything that is out there
[1:23:57] and like
[1:23:58] how are you going to do it how are you
[1:24:00] going to get through this
[1:24:02] all the different ideas and influences
[1:24:04] and opinions of people even about what
[1:24:06] we believe
[1:24:10] and why you should do this and why you
[1:24:12] shouldn't do that and why this matters
[1:24:13] and why that doesn't matter
[1:24:14] and you can just take one little thing
[1:24:16] and begin to look at like this is how
[1:24:18] are you ever going to figure this out do
[1:24:19] i have to take his word for it his word
[1:24:20] for it
[1:24:21] i thank god for the inside teacher
[1:24:24] i thank god for revelation thank god for
[1:24:27] faith
[1:24:29] i thank god for grace to look at another
[1:24:31] man who may see things just a little bit
[1:24:32] differently say well and have this
[1:24:34] liberty in my heart to say
[1:24:35] well this is what i'm living by faith i
[1:24:37] see where you're coming from i see where
[1:24:39] you base that on
[1:24:40] brother let's pray together because we
[1:24:41] know we both want to be right
[1:24:44] but the platitudes and the politics that
[1:24:46] complicate things and make people
[1:24:49] come to a place where they just want to
[1:24:50] run away from it all
[1:24:53] that's man that does that
[1:24:59] and that's just in one little tiny area
[1:25:01] that my mind is drifting to
[1:25:04] look at all of it whether it be how you
[1:25:07] should eat
[1:25:10] what kind of uh whether or not your
[1:25:12] pillow has
[1:25:13] copper lining
[1:25:17] and everything we use you know that
[1:25:18] causes cancer don't you
[1:25:20] everything you're like what do i do i
[1:25:23] can't wait till i can levitate
[1:25:25] you know walking causes cancer everyone
[1:25:27] who's ever got cancer
[1:25:29] you know most of them have walked and so
[1:25:31] there's this correlation
[1:25:33] we're trying to work out scientifically
[1:25:36] they think breathing has something to do
[1:25:38] with dying they're just looking into it
[1:25:42] so what how are we gonna how are we
[1:25:44] gonna navigate i need you lord
[1:25:47] i i need you to be able to navigate all
[1:25:50] this
[1:25:50] and it says in james chapter one verse
[1:25:52] five as you look at this scripture
[1:25:54] through wisdom as a house builded by
[1:25:55] understand it is established and by
[1:25:57] knowledge shall the chambers be filled
[1:25:58] with precious and pleasant riches
[1:26:00] the fear of the lord is the beginning of
[1:26:01] wisdom knowledge of the holy knowledge
[1:26:02] of the divine is understanding
[1:26:04] and paul prayed that god would give you
[1:26:05] the spirit of wisdom and revelation and
[1:26:07] the knowledge of him
[1:26:08] paul prayed that that's a prayer that i
[1:26:10] would have for you it's a prayer that we
[1:26:11] should have for ourselves
[1:26:12] and he says james says if any man lack
[1:26:15] wisdom
[1:26:16] brother aaron i feel like i lack wisdom
[1:26:18] to navigate laodicea i feel like i lack
[1:26:20] wisdom to raise children i feel like i
[1:26:21] lack wisdom to
[1:26:22] work things out in my marriage i feel
[1:26:24] like i lack wisdom to make the right
[1:26:25] kind of financial decisions i feel like
[1:26:26] i lack wisdom and all these different
[1:26:28] things
[1:26:29] let them ask god okay i'll ask the lord
[1:26:34] that giveth to all men liberally
[1:26:37] and won't chide you or degrade you
[1:26:39] because you asked and abradeth not

[1:26:58] because he's going to give liberally you
[1:27:00] want wisdom i'll give you wisdom
[1:27:02] if we lack wisdom let's ask god for
[1:27:04] wisdom he gives liberally and he will
[1:27:06] not obey us
[1:27:06] and it shall be given him is there
[1:27:09] something within your heart within your

[1:27:27] right now i'm going to believe
[1:27:28] that i can ask god for wisdom and the
[1:27:30] bible says it shall
[1:27:32] be given him not if you're in a doubt
[1:27:35] not even try to work through the
[1:27:37] the iterations of this that well have i
[1:27:38] done this and have i done that and
[1:27:40] haven't done this i haven't done that no

[1:28:09] to do with this
[1:28:12] that's the wisdom you can ask for it's
[1:28:15] not this general idea where you could be
[1:28:16] like a solomon who could
[1:28:18] figure out at any moment who's lying but
[1:28:21] wisdom that's relevant
[1:28:23] wisdom that's pertinent it says let them
[1:28:25] ask god let's stand
[1:28:30] let's pray together and let's ask god
[1:28:37] ask god as a family you can ask god as a
[1:28:41] wife i will ask as a husband

[1:28:45] a mother

[1:28:48] brother we can ask together as a church

[1:28:55] i'd like you to make that a personal
[1:28:57] request today
[1:28:59] and you would do it even by lifting a
[1:29:01] hand high to the lord and saying lord
[1:29:04] i'm asking today for wisdom
[1:29:08] if wisdom is how a house is built and
[1:29:10] being greedy of gain is what troubles my
[1:29:12] house
[1:29:12] then lord i need wisdom
[1:29:16] doesn't matter to me if you're the
[1:29:17] smartest man in the room if you're the
[1:29:19] wisest man in the room you'd be wise
[1:29:21] enough to ask god
[1:29:22] for wisdom with hands held high some
[1:29:25] with two hands hearts raised hearts open
[1:29:28] before the lord
[1:29:29] let us ask god for wisdom right now
[1:29:31] knowing and i

[1:29:35] lie any instinct any feeling that it's
[1:29:38] not true
[1:29:39] let us ask together unified in believing
[1:29:42] if we ask god for wisdom he will give it
[1:29:44] liberally

[1:30:10] realize that every decision we want to
[1:30:12] make

[1:30:14] or not it's the right one
[1:30:16] or which one is right and lord you've
[1:30:20] led us to this scripture today at the
[1:30:22] close of a lengthy sermon
[1:30:24] that says if we lack wisdom to ask and
[1:30:26] it shall be given to us
[1:30:29] so lord for the moment for the decision
