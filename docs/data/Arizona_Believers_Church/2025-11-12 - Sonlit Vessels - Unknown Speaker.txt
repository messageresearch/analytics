TRANSCRIPT
========================================
2 Corinthians chapter 3:18. If you don't mind, brother John, I want to give my title slide. Sometimes when I give my title, I I jump into my first verse very quick. So, we'll give you the title here real quick, but it's sunlit vessels. Spelled sun correctly because I'm just doing a play on sunlight, but this is sunlit as if in Christ, the son of God, has lit us, but sunlit vessels. 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 18. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. What a beautiful picture that's painted through these words. We with clear clear face nothing in the way looking into a mirror. We see God's glory and we're changed into that same glory glory by glory by the spirit of the Lord. You can be seated again. We'll give you the title sunlit vessels. And in this, we're wanting to look at some of these things that uh Paul is using to express this beautiful type of uh looking into a mirror and being uh turning into Christ's glory. So, there's a lot of things we can explore in this. If you could look at Matthew chapter 17, I'd like to read a couple verses there. This is so we could kind of gather the momentum from the last few services. And Jesus in verse one after six days he takes Peter, James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them. And his face did shine as the sun. This is that uh brilliant beauty of Christ. His face shines as the sun. His face didn't turn into an orb of lava. Um but it's just describes this brightness that his countenance had that would have distinguished him from just uh carnal flesh or you know unearly uh things. He still retained that image but it was this beauty and his reignment was white as the light. So his face shining as the sun. You'll find it even in other places where this is described. It's this it's a brilliance or radiance. And we mentioned on Sunday that it's kind of like this unveiled glory. It's not concealed. They looked at Jesus said, "Oh, you're a man of sorrows and you're uh you're weak and you're stooped and you're older or you you look you look uh fleshly and tired or haggarded." But now uh it's not hidden anymore. It's this unconcealed glory, this unrivaled beauty. And it was meant to set him apart, to distinguish him. And so the scriptures speak of the light of one's countenance. We use some of those scriptures on Sunday. And it's a symbol of one's identity, who they are. Someone told me uh mentioned how that one is not identified by their sneakers and they said but some people are identified by their sneakers and if you are identified solely by your sneakers then somebody can very easily impersonate you and and so there's something about facial recognition. It's not sneaker recognition but they can distinguish uh between twins and even among triplets and different things by facial features. Uh and it's wonderful how that we are participating in gathering these extensive databases of our facial features and even the maps of our homes, you know, because you get that smart vacuum and everyone they know every nook and cranny and your face and everything. They're mapping us out. It's the mark of the beast. No. Um but there's a a person's face. It's their it's their identity. It's their presence. It's their character. There's so much that's meant here. So it says his face did shine as the sun. This is a tremendous shining forth. And in verse 5, as Peter says, "Oh, this is wonderful. Let's build three tabernacles equally. One for Elijah, one for Moses, one for Jesus." God speaks from a bright cloud. It says, "A bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice out of the cloud." This is the light of a cloud. This is the brilliant shining light from this bright cloud which says, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." I love how Brother Brandham opens up this meaning. Not that I'm pleased in you, but I'm pleased to dwell in hear ye him. So this bright cloud is a symbol of God's presence. It identifies his grace or his favor. There's a lot of symbolism represented here. But now God gives his opinion because when they looked up, they saw Jesus only. So it's not it's not Moses and Elijah on equal footing with Jesus Christ, but the law and the prophet spoke of Christ. He's fulfilling uh uh their hope and he's that satisfaction of everything the Old Testament pointed to. So now God gives his opinion. This is my beloved son. Hear ye him. And this scene is representative of the beauty of Christ that's revealed in the gospels. This bright cloud overshadows them and speaks out. So there's something being represented in this to tell us that the Christ that's revealed in the gospel, he is brilliantly beautiful. He he is the only one by which man can be saved. And so this is an unfolding beauty of Christ that is if you want to look at 2 Corinthians chapter 3 that is transformative uh to our own character. This is where I'm getting this thought of sunlit vessels. There's something transformative about this unfolding beauty of Christ that we're not just witnessing something brilliant or something bright. We're kind of shielding our eyes and we can't see when we look up, but it changes us on the inside. In 2 Corinthians 3:18, it says, "But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord." And it's it's not that we're looking at him in a bottle, right? It's the mirror. It's something reflective with open face. Nothing uh uh nothing that's covering us or nothing filtered keeping it from us seeing him. Are changed when we receive him openly. were changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. So by beholding God's glory, the Holy Spirit changes our character into Christ's image. And I know I I I was thinking a lot about this today that the things I have in front of me, I have the scriptures in front of me. I have the teaching of the message in my heart. I have the quotes that I've read and everything. And so what I'm reading may sound like just reading scripture, uh, Bible studying these things, but we really got to start making pra practical application for yourself to say, "All right, well then how is it that I see God in a mirror?" And brother Brandham said that when we he was quoting Jesus or God saying, "Child of mine, when you look into this Bible, you're looking at me face to face." Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the dynamic of reading the Bible is the process of looking into the character of God, the identity of God, and how that God's presence isn't uh merely physical worship, but it's seeking his it's seeking his will, his presence, his word to know his will and then submit to it. &gt;&gt; And so there's this uh transformative experience where you're looking into the word of God and it's being revealed to you. And as it's being revealed to you, it's changing something inside of you. It's actually changing your character. Now, if you'll look at verse three of this same chapter, I'd like to give a background of what he says with open face, beholding the L glory of the Lord. We're changed. And this is what it's built upon. And he says, he says, I don't need letters of recommendation. He says, because you are my letters of recommendation. For he says, "For as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God." So now you can see how we're kind of backfilling what he says. As by the spirit of the Lord, we're changed into the glory of God. You are declared, you are the manifested declaration of Christ, &gt;&gt; not written word, but living word, ministered by the prophet. And he says, which is written by the spirit of God, not in tables of stones. We get these ideas of the tablets or the law, but in the fleshly tables of your heart. The word is written in your heart. &gt;&gt; And such trust have we through Christ to God word. Not that we are sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God. &gt;&gt; We also who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit. For the letter kleth, but the spirit giveth life. Now catch this. But if the ministration of death written and engraved in stones was glorious, what is hearkening back to? The tablets, &gt;&gt; the stone tablets wherein the law was given. If that was glorious, &gt;&gt; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away. We're going to stop because he's saying he's kind of this presupposition. If that was glorious. So he's leading to something. And what is he referring to? He's talking about the word engraved in your heart, not stone, but in your heart. So if the word is now uh written in your heart and the way that you're living is declaring that word because you're manifestally declared to be the gospel of Christ &gt;&gt; written uh by the spirit of living God on the tables of your heart. He says if the ministry which is results in death engraved in tablets was glorious so glorious that the children of Israel couldn't look on the face of Moses and that glory was done away and we're stopping and let's look at Exodus chapter 34 to see this example verses 29 to35 now we're going to take a look at this example uh of Moses that Paul is referring to and it came to pass when Moses came down from Mount Si with the two tables of testimony in Moses's hand when he came down from the mount that Moses wised not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. There's he there's even an unknown glory that he doesn't realize just how transformative this has been this this time in God's presence. And when Aaron and all the children children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh him. Now that is quite a skin care routine. Whatever he did on the mountain that day. I wonder if it was charcoal. I wonder what he was able to do and what kind of essential oils he used there. Start an essential oil company. Mount Sinai oils. And he his face is just glowing and radiant so much that they couldn't look. They felt this is I I this is it's unworldly. This is something different. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Moses called unto them, and Aaron, and all the rulers in the congregation returned unto him. Moses talked with them. And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh and gave and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in Mount Si until Moses had done speaking with them. He put a veil on his face. So what he's been doing this whole time is his face is shining so much from this audience with God that in order to be able to communicate with the people, he had to veil his face. Notice this. But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he took the veil off &gt;&gt; until he came out. &gt;&gt; Isn't this beautiful? He when he goes in before the Lord, he's unveiled. &gt;&gt; There's nothing hid, nothing between my Lord and my Savior. And so he's un he has a no veil between. So the IMPACT OF GOD'S presence I it may be I I want to say in type but this is a literal uh influence upon Moses that as he talks TO GOD HIS FACE now is absorbing this glory &gt;&gt; and so he takes the veil off when he talks to God but when Moses went in before the Lord he takes the veil off and when he came out to speak to the children of Israel that which he was commanded verse 35 and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of Moses's face shone and Moses put the veil upon his face again until he in to speak with him. &gt;&gt; This is this brilliant effect of communing with God. &gt;&gt; This is the effect of God's presence, the visible evidence of God's presence which was renewed each time Moses talked to God. He would come out of it being in the presence of God and his face would just radiate. It would just shine. It would be glowing. So he'd have to hide. He'd have to cover veil his face. But then when he would uh through this process of time, maybe that glory fades and maybe there's a uh some days go by just hypothesizing here. BUT WHEN HE WOULD GO TO GO BACK INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD, that veil would come off and it would renew that glory. &gt;&gt; And so this is the this is what Paul is referring to that whenever Moses went into the presence of God unveiled, it changed his face. But when Moses the lawgiver came out, he veiled his face so that the glory was not seen externally. So he says that if this ministration of death verse 7 2 Corinthians 3:7 is uh written in stones was glorious the children of Israel could not even look at the face of Moses for his the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away verse 8 how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious &gt;&gt; IF IF THIS if it had this kind of effect under the law which was the ministry of death &gt;&gt; I don't know if we have that department in our government but which was the ministry of death then There IS HE SAYS, "WHAT ABOUT THIS MINISTRY OF THE SPIRIT? IF THAT was glorious, if it had this effect on A NATURAL PROPHET IN HIS NATURAL FACE, WHAT ABOUT THE GLORY OF this ministry? &gt;&gt; For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. &gt;&gt; For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelth. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remainth is glorious." Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech. Now, this is important because Paul is saying, "I'm not going to hide anything. I'm not twisting anything. I'm not being cute with this. I'm going to tell it like it is." He says, "And not as Moses which put a veil over his face." That the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which was abolished. So Paul is saying, "I'm not veiling anything. I'm not speaking through a muffler. I'm not trying to deaden my words." But Moses spoke with the veil over his face to the children of Israel. And that was the ministry of condemnation and the ministration of death. And he says, "But their minds were blinded for until this day remainth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament." SO THIS VEIL THAT PAUL that Paul refers to over Moses, he's now using it as a type of veil that Christ remains veiled to Israel to this day. When they read the law of Moses, they don't see Christ fulfilling that. The veil is upon their heart. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Verse 16. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. &gt;&gt; The the the dynamics of this veil, it's kind of bleeds through from the thought on a filter and those obstructions and things that get in the way. The veil keeps Israel from seeing God's glory in Christ. &gt;&gt; Why can't they see him? There's a veil &gt;&gt; that if the veil could be taken away, if God could remove that veil, they would see the glory. So as Moses veiled himself to speak to Israel when he came off Mount Si in type there's still this veil over the eyes of Israel when they read the law they CAN'T SEE CHRIST IN THE word &gt;&gt; and he's saying if Moses communing with God would produce this vis visible effect on him to where even naturally his face would shine and it would have to be veiled for the sake of the children of Israel that he spoke to. He's saying, "What about the glory of the gospel of Christ?" That's what I pose to you tonight. What about the glory of the word of God? What kind of impact does this word have upon us? Verse 17, the veil shall be taken away. It's going to turn to the Lord. You'll be able to see him. Now, the Lord is that spirit. And where the spirit of the Lord, there is liberty. One of the things that we've ministered on over the past year, last year a little bit on in the dealing with the house of the Lord and when the younganss don't grow up and and true liberty and imperfect liberty, a lot of those themes that we visited last year, there is a definition of liberty that is no more than come as you are, stay as you are, do as you want, be what you want. There's liberty. &gt;&gt; We're free. and that this liberty it has more to do with how one conducts themselves in church than it does with the reality of what the scriptur is pointing to. Because think of what he just said. He's talking about the glory of the gospel &gt;&gt; and how it cannot the glory of the law cannot even be compared which the law pertain to the flesh and all these elements of physical things and physical worship cannot be compared to the glory of Christ's gospel. So he says now the lord is that spirit when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away. The Lord is that spirit where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. You catch what he's what he's outlining here. He's saying the veil is gone &gt;&gt; that we all with open face &gt;&gt; an unveiled glory. Liberty then is the removal of the veil. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there was there's nothing obstructing. Liberty is the removal of the veil. Allowing the light OF THE GOSPEL TO SHINE INTO OUR HEARTS in order to bring forth life &gt;&gt; as and we there I think it's IMPORTANT FOR US TO CATCH THIS. I'm not saying this at all to put handcuffs on those who want to have more liberty in their worship or want to have more liberty in certain things in life. No, THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL. HAVE THAT liberty as long as the ultimate liberty of the veil being removed and allowing Christ to SHINE INTO YOUR HEARTS HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; People take democracy too far to where it starts to uh erode others rights and they brother Brandham even tying back to some of the the early writers on liberty say well democracy is like a ship without an anchor. Uh uh all wind, all sails, no anchor. What's what's going to stop? It's people's rights and people's choice and people's vote and individual liberties. At what point DO YOU STOP? BUT THAT'S NOT THE THE prism through which we're viewing these scriptures. The liberty is the veil has been taken off the word to be able to look into the word and be deeply impacted by it, to be changed by it. &gt;&gt; Not by church and not by uh uh denominations and organizations, not by order of man or traditions, but by Christ the word. Liberty is the removal of the veil. &gt;&gt; In second Peter chapter 1 19, we have also a more sure word of prophecy. Peter's actually referring to this experience on Mount Transfiguration that spoke from the cloud and identified Jesus Christ as the son of God. We have a fulfilled word, a more sure word of prophecy. Whereinto ye do well that you take heed. &gt;&gt; Take heed to what? This word, this living word, this vindicated word, as a light, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star rise in your hearts. The word is a light shining into darkness. &gt;&gt; That this word now that we can behold, we now beholding him as in a glass. He says we're changed. We behold the glory, the beauty, the radiance of God. We're changed. Peter uses the language here as a light shining in a dark place. This is why we don't want veils in our heart. We don't want curtains. We don't want doors that shut them out. We want that light to examine us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. That liberty is to be able to behold him in his word and be changed. Verse 18, and be changed to the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. Paul continues to write in the next chapter, chapter 4, verse one. He didn't stop, put his pen down. Well, I don't know what he did necessarily. I'm not going to say he didn't, but I just suspect he didn't say chapter 4, right? This is just a convenient way of dividing it up. So he's saying, "Therefore, seeing we have this ministry." Now we all with open face, this ministration that is glorious, this turning to the Lord, seeing that we have this ministry as we have received, we faint not, but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceit deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. Paul preached Christ without guile &gt;&gt; or selfish motives. Kept the word of God pure. He didn't alter it. Didn't add to it. Did not uh plate the listener such as says, "Well, I know this is I know this crowd wants to hear it this way." So, he changed it for them. He didn't water down the word to satisfy the hearer's taste. He didn't give in to the itchy ears. &gt;&gt; Didn't corrupt the gospel with human doctrines. Didn't mix or blend it with philosophy. He didn't twist the scriptures as did others to serve some carnal purpose or his his pride or prestige. He's saying, "I I've renounced all those things. I'm not dealing with it craftly. I'm not handling the word dishonestly, but by manifesting the truth, I can stand clear before God is keeping the word pure." So he says, "I preach the gospel unmixed pure and I'm preaching Christ." But he says, "But verse three, if our gospel be hid, it's hid to them that are lost. I think this is an important scripture for everyone to know because often times as Christians and as believers when we say, "Well, if you don't believe this, you're lost." And people get all worked up as if they've never read their Bibles. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, YOU DO KNOW THAT there is a gospel that can be hid. And if it's hid, it's hid to them that are lost." &gt;&gt; And it's just biblical that if you don't see truth, if you don't see Christ, then you are scripturally lost. And how is this so? Oh, that the gospel be hid. It's hid to the lost. In whom the god of this world, in the lost, the god of this world, the god of this evil age, Satan, that dragon, that serpent, hath blinded the minds of them which believe not. The ultimate is to believe. &gt;&gt; They don't believe lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is in the image of God should shine unto them. Paul is keeping with that narrative of light shining upon something. &gt;&gt; They've veiled their own eyes as it were. They having the veil upon their face. They can stand in the presence of God, but they've got a veil. &gt;&gt; So it's it's not effective upon them. &gt;&gt; It doesn't it they can't it can't be impacted the way that one can when the veil is removed. So the gospel's hid. Their minds are blinded. If their minds weren't blinded, if it if if the veil could be taken away, then the light of the glorious gospel who is the image of God could shine into them. &gt;&gt; As Paul said, as Peter said, as a light that shineth in a dark place that causes the the sunlight to arise in your hearts. This isn't working on them. In John 1:es 1 to 11, something in the beginning was the word. The word is God. In him was life. Verse four, and the life was the light of men, and the light shineth in darkness. And catch this. And the darkness comprehended it not. &gt;&gt; The darkness could not consume it, could not destroy it, could not cast it down. But darkness stands opposed to light. &gt;&gt; If the light that is in thee is darkness, then your light, your understanding, your conviction, your belief will flee from light. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WHEREAS WHAT WE OUGHT TO do is if there be any anything in us that's not pure, we want it to be examined by the light. &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS. WHAT IS THIS NOT GOOD? GET rid of it. &gt;&gt; Brother Eleaser, when you when you said it a few Sundays ago or whatever it was that you were ministering about, the reason why people uh don't like the truth because it exposes what that what they love is evil. This is exactly what the Bible's talking about. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, I have it here in John 3 to read here in a moment. So it says the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent from God whose name was John. The same came for witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe. He was not that light. John Elijah, he's not the light but was sent to bear witness of that light. That was the true light which lightth every man that cometh into the world. Remember these distinction of light as we were trying to emphasize that over and over again. But now this one who is light, he was in the world and the WORLD WAS MADE BY HIM. This is God revealed in his son and the world knew HIM NOT. &gt;&gt; HOW COULD THAT BE? HE'S IN HE'S MAKING HIMSELF KNOWN. THE SON IS DECLARING THE FATHER AND LIGHT IS IN THE world but the world doesn't know him. &gt;&gt; Over the next couple months, people are going to be singing about the light of the world. going to be singing songs and hanging lights and there's going to be a theme on on the light of the world and the light of Jesus Christ and that light that came and even the star and all these different things but really did they really see him? Says he came unto his own and his own received him not. So the true light was rejected. &gt;&gt; Paul says Israel's heart was blinded for our sakes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So Jesus is this true light. The light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is in the image of God shines in his word. John 3:16-21. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God sent not his son in the world to condemn the world but have everlasting life. &gt;&gt; For God sent I think I conflated a few things there. Verse 17. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned. But he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. But what is the condemnation? If they don't believe, they're condemned. This is the condemnation that light is coming in the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. Why is it one would love darkness more than light? Because the light calls their deeds evil. &gt;&gt; This is the condemnation that light has come and instead of man being examined by the light and accepting what it reproves and what it corrects, they love they they want to remain in the darkness because their deeds are evil. For everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to light, lest his deeds should be reproved. You ever been in a situation where you thought you might be wrong or something's not right and you just don't want to ask the question because you'd rather just kind of think something's wrong instead of proving it and verifying it. I find myself that way sometimes. I'd rather just pretend everything's okay than actually begin to investigate and find out in fact it's not. &gt;&gt; Do I have any money in the bank? Well, surely they'll let me know if I don't, right? Just something. I'D JUST RATHER NOT KNOW. DON'T TELL ME. I GOT BAD NEWS. Don't tell me. Hey, and this is kind of how they're they're acting is like they don't come to the light lest their deeds be reproved. Can I can I say this to the Christians here tonight? Don't be afraid to be in the light. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE AFRAID OF FINDING OUT YOU'RE WRONG. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You say, "I DON'T WANT TO BE WRONG. I DON'T WANT TO BE WRONG." IT IT'S OKAY TO FIND OUT YOU'RE WRONG. WHAT YOU don't want to be is is stay wrong. &gt;&gt; It's not that you come in the light and and the lights can say, "You're evil. You're wrong. this is horrible and you're lost and you can never be saved. And it's not going to say stay the way you are. You're okay. Just thanks FOR BEING CHECKED OUT. NO, IT'S GONNA GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO be changed. &gt;&gt; But then it says everyone that in verse 21, but he that doeth truth cometh to the light &gt;&gt; that his deeds may be made manifest that they were wrought in God. He that's come to the light, he's the one that is has truth revealed to him that his deeds may be manifest. So the light is what's going to produce not evil works, but good works. &gt;&gt; And in order to produce good works, you got to come into the light. In order to assue and put away evil works, you've got to come into the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "So if our gospel's hid, it's hid to them that are lost, whose eyes and minds are blinded, lest the light of the gospel could shine into them and reprove them of their evil deeds and lead them to good deeds." Paul in verse 5 now 2 Corinthians 4:5, as we're wanting just to continue to amplify what he means when we with open face behold him as in a glass, says, "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus's sake. For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts. Talk about it. This this is a phrase I believe that is uh I I'm not trying to just be poetic and I don't want to try to give weight to different things, but in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and God said let there be light. John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Then to me it's like this verse just joins together with this as one of those substantial offerings. FOR GOD WHO COMMANDED THE LIGHT TO SHINE ON DARKNESS HATH SHINED IN OUR HEARTS &gt;&gt; JUST AS GOD SPOKE THERE IN CREATION and said let there BE LIGHT AND LIGHT CAME. HE'S SAYING THIS SAME GOD WHO SPOKE OUT AND COMMANDED THE LIGHT TO SHINE HATH SHINED. THE SAME CREATOR &gt;&gt; ELOHIM HE SHINED INTO OUR HEARTS. WHAT HAS SHINED INTO OUR HEARTS? THE LIGHT OF THE GLORIOUS GOSPEL OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY DID HE SHINE INTO OUR HEARTS? HE SAYS TO GIVE THE LIGHT of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; TO GIVE THE LIGHT OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GLORY OF GOD IN THE FACE of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God has beamed forth light to do what? Why? Why does the light shine? To illuminate his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the face of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; The face of Jesus Christ reveals God's glory. He shined into our hearts to give us knowledge of his glory. &gt;&gt; And what was that light? The glorious gospel of Christ. &gt;&gt; In John 8:12, then spake Jesus again unto [snorts] them, saying, I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 1 John 2:es 8-1 then spake Jesus again unto them saying sorry again a new commandment I write unto you which thing is true in him and in you and in you because the darkness is passed and the true light now shineth praise the Lord &gt;&gt; the darkness is passed &gt;&gt; the age of the veil is passed &gt;&gt; the day of probing and guessing and well we wonder what the Messiah will look like and could he be this and could he be that this age of groping under the darkness of the law and the blindness of the prophets. THAT DAY IS PASSED, BUT TRUE LIGHT NOW SHINES. He that saith he's in the light, this is where it gets real practical, and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now. Now, why did John have to go ruin a good thing? WE WERE ALL HAVING fun here, WALKING IN THE LIGHT, SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIGHT, RIGHT? THE LIGHT IS NOW SHINING. THE DARKNESS HAS PASSED. AND IF YOU HATE YOUR BROTHER, YOU'RE STILL IN DARKNESS. WHAT? WELL, who is my brother? Right. You ain't my brother. That's how sometimes we do it. I don't have to call him brother because he don't believe like I do. Oh, okay. All right. Careful. Now, &gt;&gt; but if anything, you kind of begin to express maybe some uncertainty about where you stand. &gt;&gt; So, in order to make yourself feel like you're on better footing, you got to put somebody else down &gt;&gt; and say, "Hey, we shouldn't have a problem calling somebody brother." Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Trump, brother Musk, &gt;&gt; brother Biden. See there, I said it, &gt;&gt; brother Obama. Sister Camala. Right. Just say it. I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY IT. THEY WANT TO SAY THEY BELIEVE IN CHRIST. THEY WANT TO SAY THEY'RE CHRISTIANS. I can say brother with the hope and prayer that THEY COME TO KNOW CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I don't need to rob them of some sort of appellation. But instead of get and I'm not talking about the mountains, but if YOU THERE'S A POINT HERE where [snorts] if we hate somebody, we say WE WE HAVE AUGHT or hatred. He's saying, man, are you really walking in the light? Because that's not what the light produces. &gt;&gt; He says in verse 10, he that loveth his brother abideth in the light. The true light is now shining. Therefore, we should abide in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. When we abide in the light, we remove obstacles are being removed. &gt;&gt; And he repeats it again in verse 11. But he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness. Who here has brothers? Oh boy, look at this front row. If you hate your brother, says you're in darkness, walks in darkness and knoweth not where you go because the darkness hath blinded his eyes. This is quite a challenge to me. This is where it gets practical where it's like, well, there's this practical impact of the gospel shining that in the presence of God, I couldn't stand there in the pre with a brother in the presence of God and condemn him. &gt;&gt; There's something about when we get into the shadows and the gray areas and the murky areas, that's when we can be suspicious. That's when we can begin to question. THAT'S WHEN WE CAN have the wrong kind of attitude towards one another. truly in THE PRESENCE OF GOD, WE COULDN'T POINT OUR FINGER AT ANYBODY. &gt;&gt; SO, he's highlighting something here in the midst OF ALL THIS THAT THE DARKNESS HAS PASSED. THE TRUE LIGHT IS SHINING. And if YOU'RE IN THAT LIGHT, IT HAS THIS EFFECT OF KEEPING US HUMBLE. &gt;&gt; Has this effect of maybe seeing enough of our own flaws and what God needs to do on us to where we don't have to be nitpicky ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE. I'M NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT THAT little sliver in your eye cuz I'm working on this 2x4 over here and I need to TAKE CARE OF THIS FIRST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE PRACTICAL IMPACT OF THE GOSPEL THAT THE more that you read it, the more you're in God's presence, it'll change your opinion of other people. &gt;&gt; Not that you can pray enough to WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW WHAT WAS ONCE WRONG IS RIGHT AND WHAT SOMEONE ELSE was doing was evil BEFORE IS NOW OKAY. NO, BUT IT CHANGES YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE PERSON. You cannot get close to God and love evil. You cannot GET CLOSE TO GOD AND LOVE SIN. YOU CANNOT FALL IN LOVE WITH THE TRUTH AND BEGIN TO SPEAK LIES AND TELL LIES AND LOVE LIES. BUT YOU CAN HAVE A HEART FOR THOSE WHO DON'T know truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those who are also blinded. &gt;&gt; And so now just come to the the this verse that we've been trying to lead up to here. We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. Therefore, seeing we have this ministry and he's he he be begins to go on this ministry that we have that the gospel it's preached in its clarity. The gospel is preached. If it's hid to anybody, it's hid to those that are lost. But to those who receive the light of the glorious gospel, they receive this image of God shining unto them. This is that uh the the beholding him as in a glass. God commanding the light to shine out of darkness has shined Christ into our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. And he says in verse 7, "But we have this treasure and earth and vessels." The I think him saying, "But we have this sounds as if it's uh uh you know an opposition to verse six, but really it's clarification that the gospel's hid to them that are lost." So the light of God's gospel hasn't shined into them, &gt;&gt; but we but we have this treasure in earthn vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Treasure here refers to things laid up in a treasury. So think of that. We have this treasure in earthn vessels. So if the treasure is the thing that's laid up in a treasury, there is a treasure in treasures. This treasure. So we are the treasures. You are a treasure filled with this treasure. The divine light of the gospel in what? Ordinary common vessels of clay. So that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. So that the greatness of his power may be shown to be God and not ourselves. &gt;&gt; This is God, not flesh. THIS IS GOD, NOT TRADITION. THIS IS GOD, NOT MAN. &gt;&gt; And you are I want you to I want you to really think about this and I I know that sounds like a Bible study where maybe it has like Sunday school principles, but you can make this applicable. You are a treasure in that you are a treasury holding this treasure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A treasure is a place where goods are stored, where precious things are collective and l collected and laid up. &gt;&gt; You may look like an ordinary human being. YOU MAY LOOK UH MUCH LIKE THOSE THAT ARE LOST &gt;&gt; to whom the gospel is hid. You might look like just a regular vessel of clay, but inside is the sunlight. &gt;&gt; AMEN. INSIDE OF THAT IS THIS GLORIOUS TREASURE BECAUSE GOD WHO CA COMMANDED THE LIGHT TO SHINE HAS NOW SHINED INTO YOUR HEART. SO WHAT IS HE LIT up you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's not a there's not a pillar of fire following us that everybody says like we some uh first person shooter game where there's just this thing hovering above us that shows that WE'RE ACTIVATED. IT'S INSIDE of us. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S THERE DEEP INSIDE OF US. YOU ARE A TREASURE FILLED WITH THE SUNLIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We'll invite the musicians to come. But we'll read verse Romans. Let's look at Romans chapter 9 18 uh to 23. We'll just stop at verse 23. To those who've been born again, you have a treasure in your flesh. &gt;&gt; Continue to read there in chapter four because he says, "We made we're we're we're these earthn vessels. We live just like clay pots." Brother Victor, Lord willing, over the next five service or four services. So, I'm going to be preaching about pottery. It's an art. It's an art form. It's a beautiful uh work of art. You talk about somebody who's going to take the clay of the earth and form something that's in the image of God. &gt;&gt; And as I've been studying these principles and looking at them, I felt this would just be a great place to blend this in that you are clay that God is molding that God is making. And not to be a vessel that's just full up of a lot of worldly things or inside this house of clay is uh is um organs and blood cells and nerve endings and those things. But no, in you is light &gt;&gt; cuz he has shined in you to light you up. &gt;&gt; You may look like just some sort of ordinary vessel, but you carry the light of God's word. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 9 verse 18, therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he whom he will hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto me, why do he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? Nay, but oh man, who art thou that repliest against God? And he's going to pull from Isaiah here. Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? And he says, "Hath not the potter power over the clay? Of the same lump to make one vessel under honor, and another under dishonor?" What if God, willing to show his wrath to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction? and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had before prepared unto [music] glory. You're a merc you're a vessel upon which he's had mercy. You're vessels of mercy. You're characterized. God has put his stamp on you, his mark. You're a vessel of mercy. And he hasn't just made you a vessel to set you on a shelf, but he's made you a vessel prepared unto glory to be a vessel full of glory. It empowers us then as just regular ordinary human beings who are born like ANYBODY ELSE, RAISED MUCH LIKE ANYBODY ELSE, eat food, require clothing, all the other natural amenities. BUT REALIZE INSIDE OF YOU IS AN UNRIVALED GLORY TRULY INSIDE OF THE BELIEVER'S POWER TO CREATE A WORLD AND GO LIVE ON IT. &gt;&gt; AND THAT THE way that this is going to be activated, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT PRAYING AND READING YOUR BIBLE, HEARING THE WORD OF GOD, SEEKING HIS FACE, COMING TO KNOW HIM BETTER. IT'S WHAT ACTIVATES THIS glory &gt;&gt; so that it can be seen on you. &gt;&gt; We don't want to hide it under a bushel. &gt;&gt; We don't want to keep covering up. We say, "Lord, I believe that you have quickened inside of me life. The light is shining to produce the life that Lord, LET ME SHINE AS did Moses shine. LET IT NOT BE VEILED. May your glory be revealed. And may your LIGHT JUST RE SHINE INTO ME, BREAKING UP ANYTHING THAT'S HARD, LORD. UNCOVERING ANYTHING THAT'S NOT pure &gt;&gt; that I could be a vessel of mercy, an honorable vessel. And then recognizing that if you are clay, he's the one forming you. He's the one making you so that you could be sunlit vessels. Not just the the light of life that pertains to humanity, but the light of Jesus Christ living in you. Embrace the calling to be a luminary. embrace the calling to be a light bear. There's nobody else that has it in this age. Brother Benham talked about seeing u uh the darkness of Leodysa and he SAYS IT'S BLACKED OUT. THE SPIRITUAL REALM IS BLACKED OUT. BUT HE SAID EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THERE'S LITTLE FLASHES of light. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, who's that?" It's the believer. &gt;&gt; And I think he uses the phrase at your table today. IN OTHER WORDS, THAT'S YOUR CALLING TODAY. YOU ARE CALLED TO BE LIGHT BEARS. WELL, HOW HOW IS IT I COULD BE LIGHT? IT'S THE WAY THAT YOU LIVE. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the way you respond to situations. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH YOU HAVE TO DO LIKE MOSES DID. MOSES WENT AND COMMUNED WITH GOD AND BEING IN HIS PRESENCE TRANSFORMED HIS COUNTENANCE. And therefore, WE MUST WALK CLOSE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; We must be walking CLOSE TO GOD. WE MUST FIND WAYS TO BE FEEDING OUR OUR SPIRITS AS CHRISTIANS SO THAT HIS GLORY CAN BE SEEN ON US. &gt;&gt; Now granted, there might be a lot of them THAT DON'T WANT TO SEE IT. &gt;&gt; COVER UP THAT HOLINESS. you Bible thumper, right? There may be a LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE IT, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE A WITNESS. &gt;&gt; We must give light. And you're called to express Christ. You're It's your duty to be the light in darkness. &gt;&gt; So, oh, it's dark. It's dark. It's dark. IT'S DARK. IT'S DARK. Be the light. &gt;&gt; I want to be the light. I've noticed this um I didn't notice it maybe to this last year or two, maybe just maybe last year that uh I'll get an email from one of those companies that um I signed up and gave them my whole life's history in order to get 2% off on orders between $8 and $12 and and [music] then they email you for the rest of your life. I've noticed recently that I'm getting these emails. It's like, "Mother's Day is coming up. If this email will trigger you, opt out of Mother's Day's emails." And I'm like, "Too late." Right? And there and there's all sorts of these things that this this is triggering. This is going to be triggering. It's family. They recognize it's family time. So you can start getting all these emails right now saying with Thanksgiving and Christmas, if any of these things create bad memories for you, opt out. I'm opting in this year. &gt;&gt; I'm opting in. In other words, if you're worried about the darkness of fa FAMILY GATHERINGS, BE THE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; Be the change. Just as a family, we're having discussions lately and maybe things can tend to get uh uh go a different direction because you have you're comfortable with one another AND IT'S A SAFE PLACE AND there might be CERTAIN DYNAMICS YOU HAVE. YOU'RE WELL THAT MAY not be healthy in the long run to always argue over certain POINTS AND SO YOU WANT TO ADAPT. YOU WANT TO CHANGE AND WE CAN BE THE LIGHT &gt;&gt; IN SO MANY different situations and so many different outcomes we can change. We can be difference makers. So, I know it's not a not a pep talk. I've just buried my soul tonight that you are a vessel of mercy. [music] So, you can show it, you can live it, you can express it, and it can be very, very applicable tonight. It may not seem like it's applicable in terms of me giving you real nuts and bolts, but let me just say this. This is practical. Don't hate your brother. And in order to have our hearts changed [music] to love one another, it's going to take that communion with the God's presence like Moses did. And if [music] the ministration of that ministry, if that was glorious, how much more this word being revealed to your heart, how much more glory should it have? [music] Let's stand together. Let's pray for one another tonight. Knowing that without him, we're nothing. I cannot make myself. I cannot just dedicate thought to it. I'm I'm going to increase my stature. I've got to surrender to him, to his perfect will. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. And gracious heavenly father, Lord, tonight as we ponder your greatness, we [music] realize that we feel very small in light of it. But there's something about truly seeing your face in the light of Christ. It's not hatred. It's not judgment. [music] It's love. It's forgiveness. It's compassion. It's favor. Lord, under the law, no man saw you and lived. But now, Lord, to see you as life. And I know we use language of face and presence and identity and veils and and and [music] it takes maybe a very a theological sentiment or has some scriptural significance. But Lord, these are very real principles that you're real, that you're living, you're pure, you're holy, and you make yourself known by the spirit. This new birth which is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to the individual is the light of the gospel shining into one soul and they recognize I'm a sinner. Forgive me in believing on you. They pass condemnation quickened to new life. They be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. They're sealed with the Holy Ghost. And Lord, it sure would have been nice if on that day I was just made summed up completely perfect and a finished vessel. And so you just kind of put me over on the finished shelf. And I've just been kind of waiting now these 30 some odd years just waiting for the next one to come in and the last one to come in so that we can all go home. But then Lord, I realize I was filled with your goodness to [music] be a light to express you. Lord, there's a lot of things that get in the way. There's still a lot of veils, denominational veils, a lot of filters. Lord, I pray that you would just uproot them all. Lord, the complexes of our past, the fears we have concerning our future. Lord, may we not let those get in the way of your light. Lord, if there be any darkness in us, we come to the light. We come to the light that it may may be reproved. How else can we be the light that Paul talked about that would approve the works of God, that they're pure and that they're holy? How can we be the light in our homes if we don't have light inside of us? If we don't come to the light. Lord, I hope that I haven't complicated a simple subject. So I pray that the people's hearts are soft to your word, Lord, can receive this in a practical [music] way, in a way that challenges them personally where they can make application right now. Say, God, this is an answer to prayer. This is very specific because you could turn it around to address these needy things in our lives just in that right fit, that right application. Lord, I pray that you take control of it for your glory. [music] for each one who prays tonight. Speak to them, bless them, strengthen them. I ask in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. [music] Amen.
