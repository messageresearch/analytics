TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'd like to read um very quickly through a few statements that we referred to on Wednesday night we might have even referenced it last Sunday but I've been personally studying um the shreport series that brother Brandon preached in November of 1965 beginning with Thanksgiving day I believe on Thursday then a Friday night service a Saturday morning a Full Gospel businessman's breakfast uh Saturday evening then services on Sunday and very remarkable um statements and uh very remarkable Series where I feel that if you're going to draw from the first service which was the invisible Union it would be good to listen to the whole thing because brother Ram's just connecting them all together and presenting a very beautiful thought to his audience which was brother Jack Moore one that had helped him quite a bit in his ministry had worked together as his campaign manager was with him in Finland when God had did many wonderful works and was a uh worked with brother Gordon Lindsay started voice of healing or part of that in Herald of his coming and he was a very large figure within the Pentecostal movement and brother brandham beginning in the late 50s and especially in the early 60s as I've gone back and started noticing that some of the most outstanding sermons to me as I was growing up in the Lord uh were the way back and just once more and some of these real Cornerstone sermons that he's preaching to Le oysa that he's preaching to a Pentecostal church that represents what Pentecost had become in an unfortunate way a and how that there was a need for another move of God to break this cycle of Revival and death and it's in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ that he is talking about the Modern Woman not wanting children and brother Branham later on that weekend says the modern church is the Pentecostal church so he's not he's not just calling out Catholics and the formal side he's calling out the whole thing and he says neither does the modern Church want any of these screaming shouting tongue speaking Acts 238 youngans around her doesn't just say it one time but he says that whooping crying and screaming she doesn't want any of that he says it again later she doesn't want screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 uh babies is what I'll say but he says that that church says they're miserable creatures and he says that she doesn't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth say well what kind can the word bring forth the word brings forth screaming shouting tongue talking uh acts 238 which we should have a problem with that at all uh and so there's these things that may accompany it and they don't want that and he says you'll find an old-fashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born of the spirit of God screaming hollering shouting praising God and he says the church can't bring that forth they don't want to bring them forth they don't want screaming children shouting and speaking in tongues and all them things this is what brother BR saying on the opening night of the meeting and let me just say that Life Tabernacle loved it and agreed with every every bit of that this is what they wanted to hear they they wanted to hear that this is what God produces because they were easily producing that they had the shouting they had the tongue talking they had the dancing and they had all these things that would be a a a response a correct response to the stimulus of the Holy Ghost on an individual's flesh you do not just need the book of Acts to know that when God moves people cry when God moves people dance and and these different things that are indicative of a person who is alive their emotional response to the fire of God and the move of God but in this series if you're taking your time to look at it you'll see that brother brandom is not just leaving the church in that state but there's a focus on maturity there is a focus on recognizing the word for your day there is a word test that comes and and challenges your experience that do you hold to those things as your security blanket or are you willing to walk with the word all the way all the way to where it's leading in this end time to full maturity and to full stature and so a theme that I'd like to introduce and probably hopefully uh in the next two services or so look more on from Frolic to fullness how there is a process of the youngans growing up and not that they ever stop crying not that they ever stop shouting and not that the gifts can't operate in their lives as they mature but the emphasis and the focus and the trajectory trory is growth in the word and there's emotional spiritual maturity and its fullness it's full stature now to mature if we were to use that as a verb it's to grow up to an advanced stage of mental development emotional development uh though we could say it's in the physical aspect since I'm trying to focus more on the spiritual aspect when we say somebody is mature you're looking at their emotional stability their mental uh development and to mature something's to bring to maturity full development a perfection condition when a seed is mature it's as good as it can get and so this is something that is ripe we could say ready for Harvest terms that brother Brenham used about green being green and in Mark 4: 29 it says but when the fruit is brought forth that means it gives itself up when the fruit presents itself who he really is when the fruit shows this is what I've been all along immediately he putteth in the sickle because the Harvest is come so ripness that determines the the the taken away it's maturity that determines the time in which the fruit the seed is harvested and it's when this fruit presents itself as to who it is so in the spiritual sense we are born of Incorruptible seed which is the word of God being born again we are babes in Christ and Peter says in 1 Peter 2:2 as newborn bab babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby termin ology used here in newborn babes is someone just born newborn phrase is actually an infant or a child so he says new born babes not that you would think two years old or three or five but even as uh recently born as an infant just born babes you are to desire the word but the milk appropriate for that time of life and the capacity to to digest and to not being able to not having teeth to chew and not maybe having fully developed reflexes to swallow he's saying that in a spiritual sense we are to to grow by the milk of the word and in growing it's becoming greater or increasing and then Paul touches on this very same process as he's speaking about desire that there's many gifts that God uses and there's Gifts of knowledge and tongues and prophecy a and there's gifts that work within the church and there's gifts of the Spirit there's also fruit of the spirit and and there's different ways that the spirit operates itself and Paul says but let me show you a better way a more excellent way let me show you a greater way and he's saying the greatest is charity and he's speaking of those things and that there's going to be something Perfect come that doesn't nullify do away with or render incorrect any of the other gifts but it just perfects it all and he says uses this when he's speaking about when that which is perfect has come which we do have today by Divine Vindication says when I was a child which is that napos uh that's unable to speak yet he says I spake fake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things this word napos could be used of one just born cannot speak one that's learning to speak one that's still an adolescent and so it covers these stages of life where one is growing from birth even into teenagehood but then there's a time he says when I became a man and those things which were expected of a child or a teenageer or an adolescent things that you would justify and not think twice of that someone would do of a particular age when I became a man I put away childish things and I was I I was an adult and so there is a process of becoming a man by maturing in growing a process of becoming adults in Christ and then Matthew 11:25 it says at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent they're already mature physically they're already grown up and have knowledge in their head and they think they've got it all figured out and you hid these things from the intellectual and have revealed them unto babes again that napio not able to speak they're still learning they're still acquiring understanding and knowledge it's important to catch that it's not just babes or infants but it's babes in Christ therefore they can learn they have the capacity they have the ability they have the the mechanics and the Dynamics now within them having been born again to have the revelation of the word come to them and then properly grow them into full maturity so though you may be a babe in Christ there is you can if you will submit if you'll listen if you'll obey you can you can grow in Christ and I believe that brother bradam when he's speaking to Life Tabernacle to the Pentecostal Church to leod DEA in those closing uh weeks of his ministry he's there at the end of November speaking these things I believe that he's showing that there is an acts 238 experience that we all must have where one is Born Again by the spirit of God and that if the church looks at tongues and says it's no such thing that church is wrong if the church looks at crying and says we won't have none of that here that church is wrong he's saying this is a genuine experience and there's a definite experience that every seed of God must have and that begins in this young these youngans that that that will have certain characteristics and the these babes then are in this condition I'm saying that this is where they grow from and brother Bam's pointing that out through those several services that weekend now if you could turn to Isaiah chapter 28 and we'll just read verses 8 to 11 but I the the first uh seven verses on this uh or actually as we just read the first few uh of this there's a crowning moment this crowning achievement and there's this bride that's going to have the mind of Christ she's going to exercise discernment she's going to judge amongst the wicked she's going to judge in the congregation she's going to be able to discern um among them that which is good and that which is evil all these definite end time characteristics of the Bride but at the same time there's those that have aired and they're and they have stumbled in judgment and so there's tables that are full of vomit and like a dog they're returning back to the vomit returning back to traditions and so it's right after this that let's just read verse 8 for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there's no place clean and then he says in this kind of a transition but yet now with this in mind since this is what it's going to be at that day this is what God's going to begin and he says Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast how are we going to have these these people who are the the Lord of hosts is a Crown of Glory to a dim of Beauty and the spirit of judgment will be upon them and they'll turn the battle at the gate how are we going to get there it's those that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and other tongue will he speak to his people the stammering lip in the scripture creates the image and it's used of this infancy uh the stammering lips would be in the sense that sounds are being made but yet it's not uh discern able you're not not able to use not that you're not able to use speech but yet how you're speaking it's stammering it's a stuttering it's not maybe clear and so as the babe in the New Testament would be one napos is no word they're not able to speak clearly articulately this Stam lips another tongue is a prophecy of the day of Pentecost when that day of Pentecost was fully come God begins to pour out his spirit and what happens is in the stammering the stammering is an known tongue it's not clear or discernable or the speech itself you cannot understand except God would give you the Revelation or Quicken you to understand it and so I I'll say this at this moment I'm just trusting the Lord to help me to uh point out these different things as we go along that the Pentecostal age in leod deia this uh last uh the pouring out of his spirit in the 1900s the Pentecostal age represented the restoration of the gifts and brother brandham the most standing part of that was the tongues and he even gets into how there's a debate about it but these tongues how these tongue came in at the end of the Gentile dispensation and there's this pouring out of the Holy Spirit and the Pentecostal age the leodan church age is an age of the restoration of the gifts and tongues brother Braham says in the Rapture which is just a week after he preaches these things uh in the shreport series in the days of the Pentecostals the restoring back of the gifts the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues casting out devils and the gifts and so the Leo deene age is the Pentecostal age and it is an age that brother brandham clearly identifies and says that within that age there's a distinct departure where in Christ is put out of the church and God is now revealing himself individually to bride members and so he calls it a bride age and in Acts chap 10: 44 to 46 I I was going to read in Acts where and I'm realizing now Shuffle some things up but in Acts chapter 2 when the Holy Spirit fell they begin to speak with unknown tongues the Bible says they spake with um tongues other tongues uh as the spirit gave them utterance so with stammering lips and another tongue so this aspect of this other tongue that begins to manifest on the day of Pentecost then as the gospel's turning to the Gentiles I want you to catch this part in Acts chap 10: 44- 46 while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God so there is and this might stumble some people but just about every single instance so many different instan in the book of Acts when the Holy Spirit was poured out tongues follows and that's why there are those that believe the evidence of being sealed with the Holy Ghost or filled with the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues they've turned it into an Evidence and seeing people who spoke with tongues turn out to be rank heathens and reject Christ and die in sin they done did away with predestination and so that was maybe the Fallout of choosing uh you know cabbag down on one particular Doctrine and putting a period so the birth of the Gentile Church comes in with tongues signs and wonders the power of God moving in the book of Acts and this is how and I say this to catch this there was Jews that were there on the day of Pentecost in the up room and they are those to whom they were ordained to be there and this was the promise that God gave them in the Old Testament of the Messiah that was to come who was to be a sacrifice and who was to baptize them with fire so they've received their Messiah and this is the Capstone of their messiah's message go and you'll tar there and you'll receive this baptism of the Holy Ghost now to the Gentiles they weren't expecting a prophet they weren't expecting a messiah and so the m of God in the Old Testament is that this climax of the Messiah to the Jews hid the the Revelation that his body was going to be a gentile bride the gospel and the light would turn to the Gentiles and so at when the Holy Spirit now is being poured out of the Gentiles this is the birth of the Gentile church and brother bradam says in in the sermon there is a man here that can turn on the light on the day of Pentecost that was the light that showed when the Holy Ghost had come Isaiah said in the 20th chapter chapter of Isaiah precept must be upon precept line must be upon a line here a little and there a little hold fast to that what's good for with stamy lips and with other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest this is the Sabbath that I'll give and all this they would not hear they walked away and wagged their heads so the rest was given but as a whole as a group they rejected it and they turned away from it then there's those of the circumcision during that time of the birth of the church that are coming to Christ from the circumcision and then but there's this uh instance in that day where they rejected this as a nation and when on the day of Pentecost brother brand is speaking when the Holy Ghost fell upon those people they acted like drunk men and women staggering under the impact of the Holy Spirit and they walked away and wagged their heads and said this people's drunk full of new wine and so forth this is the response of those Nations gathered many of those Nations that are gathered there in witness this they say ah they're drunk they're full of new wine they've done a little bit too much but the says absolutely was the light the word that had been prophesied made manifest so on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit is poured out Peter under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost points back to it it's pointing back to Isaiah 25 that was light on Isaiah 28 with stamy lips and other tongues it was light on Joel chapter 2 and brother R saying there's a man that can turn on the light he's showing how God has always shown light on the prophecy for that day and then what does he say in in that sermon there's a man here who can turn on the light he tells a story how that little girl was in a dark cave screaming and crying and hollering and her her brother said don't worry honey there's a man here who could turn on the light and Rapture the church and I believe brother brandham was that brother to the church seeing the the the the anxiety the screaming and the hollering say look there's a man here who could turn on the light and Rapture that church now in Acts 11: 15 he says Peter says and as I begin to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them this is the recounting of Acts chapter 10 there's this Marvel how could the Holy Ghost go to the Gentiles they're dogs or heathens they're not of the circumcision but as the word was being preached the Holy Ghost just poured out on them and it says they spoke with tongues and magnified God and there's even meaning behind that magnifying God this vocalization this praise this shouting that would go up and he says as I begin to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning in other words the Holy Ghost fell on us and tongues of fire fell on us and we begin to speak with tongues and we begin to shout and praise the Lord this this thing happened and the same thing happened to Gentiles so this is the the birth of the church this is the beginning the stammering lips and the sermon trying to do God a service without being its will has anybody listened to that one here recently Saturday morning of the streetport series Good Wonderful brother says the day of Pentecost the spirit directed it right into that to Joel 238 the day of Luther directed it right into that Wesley in this last Pentecostal move if I could just say this the Holy Spirit directed right it into the word for that time but he says but this is another age this is the calling out of the Bride now catch this this is another age in other words this isn't the the church age cycle of Revival and death this is the calling out of a bride out of what Leo deia that when the church had gone lukewarm and kicked Christ out of the church there's an entrance that's open and the bride is called up higher now does the leot dean Church age end uh well let's just look outside it's coming to full maturity we see by Vision them descending in the chaos but at the same time that Leia is descending deeper into darkness there's a bride out of Leo DEA living right here on Earth who's ascending up right now ascending up by the word of God this is another age he says not 2,000 years ago at Pentecost or the repeat or the return and who is he speaking to Pentecostals not 2,000 years ago Pentecost the calling out of the Bride is not exactly what it was then in terms of Prophecy the Holy Spirit was in Luther the Holy Spirit was in Wesley it's God's word being anointed and the Holy Spirit returned to the people of the age and they begin to have the restoration of the gifts same Holy Ghost says they found out by yielding himsel to God the Holy Ghost spoke in tongues through them who did the Holy Ghost did they laid their hands on the sick and they recovered they danced in the spirit this is this is a genuine Bonafide move of God and some of the people that were in Life Tabernacle their parents and Grandparents were there in the beginning brother man preaches return and Jubilee and how that 50 years before that when the spirit of God was pouring out at the birth of that age they were the real genuine Pentecostals the real spirit of God moving upon them restoring the gifts they yielded to God brother says they laid their hands on the sick and they recover they dance in the spirit that was the age of reformation bringing the church back into order you catching this this is the last order of the Reformation this is the last stage to bring back what justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost so that you have a birth you have babes he says and the last order the church was placing the gifts into the church so this is the the the last stage of that that Reformation or we could say a restoration and as it is a restoration but it's not a full restoration he said the Lutheran placed justification Wesley placed sanctification Pentecost placed the gifts but what did they do the same mistake as Nature has patterned to the wheat stock they denominated on what the very things God had restored they denominate what made it so bad to denominate the seed must come back to seed the worst word must come back to fullness and so what they do is they stop oh we justification we've gone far enough sanctification we've gone far enough baptism the ghost we're Justified Sanctified baptized with the Holy Ghost we're doing these same signs and wonders in the book of Acts and they say we've arrived but God says well no I've just got you back the way you were before and the way that was was a full bride tree but it had never been with the bridegroom tree and before I could come to her she fell and so no you're just back this is the Reformation this is redemption this is the pattern I've showed from the very beginning I want to come now and invisibly Unite with that church to bring for the true fruit of the Union so you're just now coming to that place where you can receive me but they fell away and he says which is against God contrary to God they denominated on those gifts they emphasized those gifts they lift th lifted those things up as the evidence as the penultimate as the ultimate Revival we've gone far enough and we know from these things that brother bam taught the work the specific work of the Holy Ghost today is to not repeat the day of pentec cost because that experience never leaves the church you cannot preach the word of God and say that there is no experience of the Holy Ghost cannot preach the word of God and be a dispensationalist to say oh there's no signs and wonders and there's a lot of there's a lot of scholarship on this there's not e there haven't been evil men in rooms for hundreds of years you know just trying to find a way to defile the church but they've wrestled with these things and said well did the God pour out his Spirit to establish the church and give vindication to the apostles and then once the church was established and the gospel was being preached people could receive it by faith and so God no longer uses those things to establish the gospel and they arrive at that sincerely but sincerely wrong and I'm glad that we had a prophet in this day to be able to just give us the Vindication that no that God did not cease these things these things still exist in the church and so this day of Pentecost experience this baptism of the Holy Ghost this new birth experience as it fell on the day of Pentecost it's the Holy Ghost in Luther holy ghost in Wesley holy ghost in Pentecost it's still the Holy Ghost today in the church but this is a different age and time we've got to consider God's age and time not that that if this is a different age and time that means other things are wrong but what do it led to what's the trajectory what's the accumulation and this is Harvest Time maturing time this is ripening time this is Rapture so in Isaiah 28:9 is it says that there is going to be stand lips and other tongues that I'll speak to this people and that is the day of Pentecost and that is the birth and the beginning he asked this question Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine you catching that phrase who is going to be taught knowledge who is he going to make to understand teaching so he wants to teach knowledge but he wants there to be understanding he wants there to be wisdom he wants it to be practical and applied who's he going to to do it to them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast can you make your connections to First Corinthians and second Peter 1 Peter in Mark chapter 4 can you begin to make your connections to Matthew 11 the babes now who would grow by suckling and grow from that milk he says who am I going to teach knowledge and make to understand that teaching them that are weaned they're yielded they're rewarded the milk but then they're weaned which comes from the word to deal fully with so it's not just partial in part to it means to recompense the word means to ripen they're weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast they're removed and taken away from the milk only they who is he going to teach knowledge not not people who stay babies who is he going to make to understand the doctrine who is going to make to understand the teaching who's going to give wisdom to be able to use and apply in work and function and be skillful with what they're being taught those that are not just suckling those who are not just babes Amen in Genesis 21:8 the child grew and was weaned speaking of Isaac it's this time wherein he was taken away from the breast he's no longer milk it's a distinct time in the development of a child and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned why it's indicating proper development it's indicating growth and maturity that he's not going to have to just drink milk all the time and he's he needs to have a proper diet to physically and emotionally mentally develop and it's one that's growing up appropriately is one that can be taught Abraham sees his son now advancing to a new stage where he's not entirely dependent upon the mom anymore now as the father I can begin to lead him and guide him and now my I become more of an active participant he goes from milk to meat brother brandham says in the sermon what is the Holy Ghost all tables are full of vomit there's no clean place what is he quoting Isaiah 28 verse 8 who shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he make known understand Doctrine you listening them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast not little babies Presbyterian babies Methodist babies Pentecostal babies Lutheran babies Nazarene babies could we say message babies he wants somebody that's willing to get away from the breast and eat some strong meat Hallelujah this is what God wants what is the Holy Ghost what is it given for all these things that brother Bam's teaching he is pointed out in that series even though he might say it's 1959 he's already showing us the time and dispensation that we're living in is where the purpose of the Holy Ghost is filled what is the Holy Ghost given for so he can work so perfectly through us to bring us to a place of adoption wherein this rapturing Grace functions in US fully and completely and it draws the rest of them from the grave and we go in the Rapture and who who are who's going to do that well not little babies somebody willing to be taken away from the milk and eat strong meat Hebrews 5: 11-14 Paul is dealing with his very situation with the Jews and in the Hebrew church he says of whom we have many things to say who is he talking about mezic he's wanting to preach who is this mezic and I do find it interesting that he just goes ahead and does it anyways he says a lot of things about him makes you wonder how much more he wanted to say and brother brandham preaching the same gospel Paul preached brings us this mystery this revelation of who this SM it is says I have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing they didn't have their airpods on too high it's not that they worked in on mechanics or they were uh uh and they had heavy machinery around all the time and they lost their hearing it's like you're not really quick to understand you're not catching these things for for when for the time you ought to be teachers now can you catch the image of scripture who am I going to uh teach knowledge and who will I make to understand that teaching that knowledge them that grow up and so Paul is saying I got a lot of things I want to still teach you but you're still he says because you ought to be teachers why would they be teachers now because the taught shall be as the teacher they should be in a place of maturity to be do the teaching now he says but you have need one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk babes youngans and not of strong meat they haven't been weaned from the milk they're not drawn from the breast they find too much comfort in that for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe it's the image of those that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast to be able to teach knowledge and then being taught knowledge they come to a place where they can make use of that they have wisdom and understanding of the word of God so that they become skillful but if you're not skillful in the word of righteousness you're still a babe I don't say that necessar that's not said as condemnation thank God you're a babe right babe thank God this is wonderful this is great that you're babes in Christ and your newborns and You' have the spirit of God working in you but grow up he's a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age mature strong he's speaking speaking spiritually uh I for as young as I can remember my children mean they love steak and they still weren't full age but he's talking about spiritual strong meat even those who have by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil for the Lord shall be a Crown of Glory a diadem of beauty a spirit of judgment as we grow up into the Capstone the head which is Christ we're Discerning the truth how by growing up Sister Rogers I meant to say welcome back sister L it's so good to see you today she feeling good she's in the house of the Lord I meant to say that earlier and I forgotten she's just there listening to the word of the Lord we're glad that she's here I hope you can enjoy the picnic today and so he's in this very image of those that grow and as they begin to grow they use as they use they understand how it works right this is how God wants to grow us you understand you know what laying hands on the sick does work you know what confessing does work this is how God works this is how the word works this is how we do things and you're growing now into full stature because you're understanding the word of God and how it works and you are coming to a place that one who is able to use and by using you get greater discernment by having greater discernment you can distinguish between right and wrong and begin to walk a more perfect way am and so in Isaiah 28 God before the spirit is being poured out in order to have those who can learn think about it the wise and prudent th those that whack their heads those that had it all figured out ah they're just drunk forget about it they were the ones that God was turning away from so what did he do he made babes Quicken them to New Life God was not just wanting to have a daycare he's wanting to teach knowledge and make to understand Doctrine so they were to grow it's the same thing that Paul was pointing to they're not growing up you ought to be growing up this is actually the function of the holy spirit that if you've been born again and you have the inside teacher then there ought to be some maturing there ought to be some growing the Holy Ghost can never grow to a point where it denies its own word but you can't be going back you can't be put in a period you can't be going no no no no I spoke with tongues no no no no I spoke with tongues you've got to grow up and mature that's right so he says who can I teach and who can I make to understand the teaching and brother Brown when he preaches the adoption series one of the things he points out that's very critical he says preaching catches The Sinner and brings them under condemnation by the word the ISM the preaching catches The Sinner in his conviction catches him in his sin and the preaching this evangelizing brings him to a place of repentance and he's converted he's born again he's a child of God and then brother bam says but teaching places a man positionally what he is preaching can bring him to a birth to manifest his election but teaching positionally places that son and we can never we can never rightly be able to have faith into positionally we know what we are yes with stamy lips another another tongue he pours out his Spirit upon the Flesh of the people their birth into the word and the word Bible's prophesying it's those young ons that I'm going to teach it's those youngans I'm going to cause to grow up it's those youngans who are cut by the preaching of the Gospel who teaching will place them in the body of Christ who they are and one day the full body of Christ will present itself as a mature woman as a mature Church in Joel chapter 2: 28 and 29 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh this is what the Holy Spirit directed Peter to on the day of Pentecost he's pouring out his Spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit we know what this is right this is the day of Pentecost this is the inauguration of the body of Christ this is the gospel Capstone to the Jews and then in this age after a short period of time it begins to turn to the Gentiles and the Gentile Church age actually begins basically with a falling away and you have the church ages and it's a gradual leaving of the word of God is a work of the Antichrist Spirit against the church and it's the age of the Holy Ghost it is the Son of God the Holy Ghost in his church that's a dispensation of the church ages but brother bham says between the Millennium where he's son of David and Le de in church age he reveals himself as the son of man that's bridegroom that's a man about to be married so what he needs is a woman not a babe not a little girl he needs a woman so God pours out his Spirit upon All Flesh this is the inauguration of the church this is the Holy Ghost within human beings as it operates on human flesh we've got enough word to know that's how the Holy Ghost can work but we want to have enough word to know what he's trying to do so Joel 3:13 I've just got to be very quick now he says put put ye in the sickle for the Harvest is ripe get you down for the Press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness is great there Comes A Time in the prophecy of Joel that there is going to be the Holy Spirit poured out upon All Flesh but there's got to come a maturity to follow it is the process of life it is the seed coming to mat whether you be those that are of the seed of God who are going to be harvested in a Rapture or for those whose wickedness is great and you're bundled together by the messenger of this hour into your denominational tears to be burned because he gathers them all in this end time there's a gathering brother brandom even and I I'm realizing I should have maybe put all these down it might even be in the streetport series where he says I'm bundling them all together for judgment so there is an outpouring of this Spirit but there is a harvest that's to be ripe right I might be using right too much right in Hebrews chapter 1 uh the sermon brother BR preached when he does the Hebrew series notice how brother BR deals with this because Paul is writing man you're dull of hearing this this idea of being dull of hearing and needing to be taught again and that's kind of hard to teach somebody who's dull of hearing he wrote one to the Pentecostal Church he's talking about all his letters he wrote one to the Pentecostal church had a lot of troubles with him the Pentecostal church he had more trouble with than anybody else still has it but he was thankful for them the only thing he could teach them when they come in one had a tongue one had a song one had a sensation one had a feeling he couldn't talk or speak to them eternal security he couldn't speak to them predestination he couldn't talk to them they were babies they had to feel something or see something or have funny feelings or something around them some evidence is and don't be upset that's how babies are babies want a they want a security blanket they want their Binky right is that what you had brother Joshua a little Binky right you have a pacifier and you need something that can soothe and you teach a baby and one of the tips we could pass along as parents who didn't always do it right is find something that your child Your Baby Can self sooth self soothe with right something that is svy to them something comfortable something that is a a blanket and we're not to be align us and carried around with this the rest of our comic lives but you come to a point where you get rid of the binky you get rid of the blanket and that's what brother BR saying it's like they still wanted to hold to the things that God gave them in the beginning to help them out and get them moving and and show his presence with them they never grew out of it they were babies they wanted to feel something see something have funny feelings something around them but I believe when he spoke to the Ephesians remember Ephesians is the placing it's the adoption it's the Exodus not just the Exodus but the entrance he could speak on God has predestined us unto sons and daughters and adopted us as children in Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world watch him come over into the book of Romans and so forth they were grown up oh they spoke with tongu sure and they had other signs of the Holy Spirit among them but they didn't make doctrines and Sensations and little Quivers and funny feelings yeah they spoke with tongues they didn't make a big deal out of it yeah they the Holy Ghost moved in signs and wonders and shouting and dancing and screaming and crying you know if anything we should be yeah the Holy Ghost does that right duh you it should be this is what it does it shouldn't be like oh my goodness this is amazing this is so Supernatural let's do this let's build three Tabernacles right they were grown up Paul said you've got extremes with that so he calls it extremes with what Sensations emotions dancing shouting speaking of Tong those are my words you got extremes with that when you ought to be teaching you're still babies and have to have milk this is Brother brandom's words not mine this is him that's what I've always tried to contend this Tabernacle to be not a bunch of babies let's be grown up stand on the road oh my there you are right why because they still always they're always misusing the gift trying to put the gifts forward they're trying to be something they're not or they're trying to emphasize these things I've always tried to contend at this Tabernacle right here in Jeffersonville to not be a bunch bunch of babies but grow up so when Paul said you are dull of hearing brother B said he's always had a problem with the Pentecostal Church he's always had problems with the babies who want to see something feel something have some evidence too much separation anxiety right maybe too much Church abuse that have created these negative Dynamics within Believers lives where they need the pastor to make them feel good they need the altar call to make them feel good they need some sort of visible evidence and some Sensations and funny feelings and to feel like we're good right we're good we're okay we're a good church I'm saved I've got the Holy Ghost everything's going good away with the eighth Messengers away with the Kingdom Builders away with Pastor worship come back as an individual to the word and grow up and stand on your feet as Sons and Daughters of God that know who you [Applause] are but the young ones were dull of hearing in other words they were not growing up and because they were not growing up they're not placeable I had a brother ask me he said i' I've been following what you've been preaching and this when the youngans don't grow up and you've been showing a lot about the maturity and about growing up and what it means to grow up but you I want to know the answer to your title when they don't grow up if they don't grow up they're not placeable when he says they're dull of hearing if you read in the context of the other chapters in Hebrews it implies that they were once first enlightened and they came to know the gospel truth that they were enthused and they were excited and they were growing there was a initial beginning as he says to the Galatians you did start good but what happened now you think you're going to perfect yourself but they had become do and notice what the Bible says in Isaiah 28:13 with stary lips in other tongues I will speak to these people then verse 13 but the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line hear a little and there a little now it's word word word but you have to catch this it's not the full right and because it's not and because God is meeting it out this way that there's going to be a word a word a word here and there and it's going to be a word and because it doesn't come back to fullness or if it's not embraced fully if it's not put together and understood they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken and other words they become hard to move they're dull of hearing it means they're hard to move it's exactly Paul is saying that exactly what the Holy Spirit spoke and Isaiah it's happened because now you're dull of hearing you're hard to move you're failing to go forward you're holding to Traditions you're holding to the flesh yeah line here line there precept here precept there there's all great embrace them but because it's partial it's incomplete it's intermittent it causes them to fall back and not go forward he says they go fall back they're broken they're snared they're taken so God must do something to break this cycle to break the cycle of tradition and man made Creeds and putting periods on the word of God and the religion and there's got to be a Breaking of the cycle of the church Ages which is Revival than death remember how we were reading in Isaiah how that there is at this very time that there's going to be those who are coming to sharp razor sharp discernment with this Crown of Glory upon him it speaks of the Bride in this end time when this man becomes this hiding place at the very same time there's those that had air through wine inspiration sensation feeling intoxification Isaiah 29: 9-14 he says stay yourselves turn here if you could or please take note of this stay yourselves and wonder cry out and cry they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink remarkable parallel to the very thing that Peter says at the inauguration of the church on the day of Pentecost these men are not drunk as you suppose but now instead of spiritual discernment they're senses are dled becomes a parallel to the L de an outpouring wherein God moves amongst them and in 15 years they denominate they got zero discernment anymore God called them out of organization then they begin to organize around sensation organize around uh evidences and because this church does this then we don't agree with them and because they do that we're going to do this and it's just a bunch of fighting they're drunk but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink and at the outpouring of the Holy Holy Spirit in this age and in the restoration of the gifts in this hour the church was dull for the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers hath he covered there's this dullness this this lack of teaching understanding nobody has the TR full truth the spirit of Deep Sleep comes over the whole church the spirit of deep sleep is upon those and in Matthew chapter 25 when he gives the the parable of the wise and foolish virgin when the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept Spirit of deep sleep this drunkenness and wine and these things and even after the return of the gifts to the church the church is sleeping as it approaches midnight the sleeping church has not fulfilled the promise of the Reformation words they've been reformed but the promise of the Reformation is perfection it's not a full restoration of the word Christ because they actually put Christ out of the church brother BR said the Pentecostal age did not restore when he says it did not restore it doesn't mean they didn't restore the gifts the language is too plain that it did but he's talking about the full promised restoration but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word the Pentecostal age did not perfect it did not mature they they were it brought it back to the birth but they need to be weaned from the milk they need to be drawn from the breast they need to be taught the word this is why even brother brownman his own Ministry has to come back and bring them back to the beginning of these things New Birth experience and these fundamental doctrines he had to even restore what the L Dean age was losing in order to be a son of man to reveal the son of man in order to be Revelations 10:7 he had to be the angel of the seventh Church age to get them back to even where they were to know that an entrance has been opened up to have an audience with Christ the Pentecostal age not fully restore and think about it in terms of the life Messengers those four death Messengers Whittle it down to nothing there's got to be four that bring it back Christ is the fourth in that valley of dry bones they all come up and it looks like an army but what are they they're sleeping the prophecy has to go forth again and animate them and come to a standing on their feet mature Army so at the Pentecostal age in Leo DEA this is the promise of Leo DEA you have a church that looks like it's almost there only thing is is they're missing seen something this is what some of you look like they've got to have that word come the final piece so it says in verse 11 about this church the Pentecostal church and the vision of all of all things is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed a sealed book Revelations 5 which men delivered to one that has learned saying read this I pray and he saith I cannot for it is sealed even the learned it's sealed to them and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this I pray that he say I'm not learned the book is sealed and no man can elose it no man can read it they're not even worthy to look upon it here is this sealed book the vision of all the vision of all what is it Redemption restoration fullness and it's a sealed book and at the Pentecostal age of Le desent age there's no Revelation in Revelations 5 the book is sealed no one can open it this is the picture of the Leo Dean Church the Gentile bride brother Bram said in God's provided place of worship he says neither does the Pentecostal know what's going on today they don't know what's going on today the vision is sealed brother Bram right or preaches when he's preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ in 19160 he's preaching on the th trean Church age what happened when Pentecost came along speaking in tongues and bringing the restoration of the gifts they couldn't move called them Devils who's he saying the weslan the methodists couldn't move they called them Devils don't make the same mistake the methodists did which they were a little bit more charismatic sometimes we think you know screaming and shouting his original Pentecost and we're thinking bride age stuff and well the methodists were doing it too and he says uh the that that group couldn't move called them Devils now what's the Pentecost done they did the same thing and where are they at just as dead as a doornail the church is dead brother B the third seal says they're sleeping there's been no manifestation of God to stir up it's going to take the open of that book and the revelation of the seven Thunders to Quicken her to life not a restoration of the gifts not a going back to isusa Street not going back to some other age but recognizing the promise for your age and the prophet stands there and says there does not need to be a restoration of these things God has restored them those Messengers has come the branches the leaves the shouting the tongues and those things it's already here but wck ize your day and its message can you grow up just as dead as a doornail verse 13 wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips right but have removed their heart from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men these are the hearts of the children that need to be restored by Malachi 4 notice he restores the hearts of the children why does he have to restore hearts of children so they can grow that you'd be no more children as long as your heart hasn't turned you can't grow up so the prophet's first order of business is restore you back to Pentecostal youngans but he didn't want you to stay a Pentecostal young he wants you to grow up and from a heart from the heart a man speaketh and here they're speaking but they don't have the right heart but then he says therefore remember we're looking at the situation say well what's going to stop it therefore behold I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people even a marvelous work and a Wonder for the wisdom of their wise men Shall Perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid they're wise they're prudent they're strong they're bold they're courageous all their religion tradition and all their their workups and whatever they got he says I'm going to do a marvelous work and theirs will perish theirs will be hid God prophesies a Wonder a marvelous work but remember not great in Man's eyes great in God's eyes oh brother bam shouldn't this be in some great big Cathedral shouldn't this be this shouldn't we shouldn't we be doing this shouldn't we do it just live simple people are looking for some great fantastic we right over the top of it let's skip to verse 16 I'm going to do something great I'm going to do something wonderful the vision of all has become as a sealed book but I'm going to do something marvelous I'm going to do something great and this is going to be this going to be how we go from stamy lips and other tongues and this is how we go back to those that can be taught and those that can be trained and those that can grow surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as The Potter's clay for shall the work of him say that made it he made me not or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it he had no understanding my goodness is it not yet a very little while and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest growing up and in that day shall the death hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of Darkness there's going to be a day when that sealed book the vision of alls becomes a sealed book and no man is worthy to open it and there's a lack of understanding there's a lack of teaching and there's a famine for the word of God I will do something wonderful and when this thing is wonderfully done in that day ears will hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind will now begin to see in Isaiah 32:3 I got to go quickly now just to tie these things together all the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of them that she hear shall be shall hearken what are you going to see the book what are you going to hear the word you're going to hear the words of the sealed book God is going to teach you knowledge and make you to understand the teaching the deaf hearers will hear the words of the sealed book The Eyes Of The Blind will see out of the darkness and we see through a glass Darkly and this is that befuddlement but then face to face and the veil is taken away it's turned to the Lord the book is open sent back down to earth it's revealing whose names are in there in verse 4 Isaiah 32:4 now notice this the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge who is he going to teach knowledge here we are this is what's happening the open of the word now who am I going to teach knowledge these people who am i g to make understand that teaching these people the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly oh he pours out his Spirit they're stammering lips and it's wonderful Paul said he did it more than anybody else brother B said he wish everyone in the church could do it shouting dancing screaming crying all wonderful Holy Ghost does it but there Comes A Time when you got to speak plainly the restoration of the gifts was the stammering lips it was the unknown tongues but the heart is turned to understand knowledge the heart of the rash that's speaking of the expectant those that are looking for waiting Zephaniah 389 therefore wait ye upon the Lord sayith the Lord until the day that I Rise up to the prey for my determination is to gather the Nations that I may assemble the kingdoms to pour out upon them my indignation even all my Fierce anger for all the Earth shall be devoured with fire of my jealousy here we are in the end time the bundling of the tears the Judgment of the Bride out of the church here he is it's revealed himself as the wig one the Supreme judge in this hour saying denominations are done they're over they've crucified the word of fresh now he begins to separate now he begins to call you out and he says for then will I turn the people to a pure language that they may call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent that's one back One Vision one word amen the tongue of the stammer shall be ready to speak plainly amen Isaiah 30: 20 to 22 and though the Lord give you the bread of Avers and the water of Affliction here's the prophecy to those while there's people are intoxicated and running after false doctrines and building kingdoms and all their platitudes and the Pentecostal church is going into chaos he says yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner anymore remember they're seers and their prophets they're all do but now you're going to have teachers Thine Eyes shall see thy teachers thy ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way walk ye in it when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left remember when brother Bram had a vision of the preview of the bride and she came through beautiful beautiful church then the succession of church ages and then the leot deyan church age came through dancing the rock and roll music a big whoop them up shouting and and dancing to rock and roll music and brother man says oh my goodness is this what my message has produced I wonder what he saw to make him think that was associated with his message and then they begin to descend down into darkness he says but then the bride must come into preview again and they go marching and what was it sweetly Onward Christian Soldiers and as they pass by him and he looks some of them who are looking at that L desan Church saying sure looks like they're having fun begin to get out of step and they heard a word behind them saying this is the way walk you in it get back in Step get back in line this is the way walk you in it these scriptures are being fulfilled the ears are hearing the words of the book the eyes are seen out of darkness and in obscurity the eyes of the dim shall see the ears shall hear and the tongue of the stammers shall be ready to speak plainly with understanding clear and bright not unknown no longer children but mature because the bride must according to Revelations 10 prophesy again when do they prophesy again after taking the book to prophesy is to declare things that can only be known by revelation we are told in spiritual way but yet very literal to go to him who has the book to take it and he says take it and eat it up and in eating the book it says Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings it's after eating the book your ears hear or eyes see and we to prophesy the bride is going to declare things that can only be known by Revelation the tongues of leoda it's the work of the Holy Ghost was Stam your lips and other tongues will I speak but they were not plain the word had not been restored the right teaching had not come they're not speaking with a full understanding but to speak plainly is to speak with new tongues but brother R said that's spiritual Revelation this is why brother brandham says in the invisible Union the word that fell in the day of Pentecost will not work for this day that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride we've got something different the Pentecostals UPC Life Tabernacle leod DEA they represented that day that aspect of the day of Pentecost the restoration of the gifts again we're in the bride age it's the age of speaking plainly right the it's from Frolic to fullness from green to mature this is what we're this is the emphasis of the holy spirit in this hour do we do we still speak in tongues some of you have done it right here do we still cry do we still shout do we still dance God move upon us let your Holy Spirit pour out and let each person individually have the Liberty within themselves to enjoy the presence of God but let us not make a church or Tabernacle on any of it let us continue to say this is my beloved Son hear ye him the time and the hour that we're living in now is not an age of Frolic it's an age of maturity it's an age of growing up this third poll is not a public show and we'll enjoy the public shows while we have them but the real work the real meat is happening by revelation of the word of God in Mark 7:35 excuse me 32 to 35 I might have that wrong on there and they bring speaking of Jesus I'm at the very end brother John I'm skipping a whole bunch you'll have the luxury of being able to read all these scriptures and quotes I'm skipping and they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech dull of hearing being dull of hearing you're not able to speak clearly he has an impediment in his speech his tongue is tied and they beseech him to put his hand upon him and he took him aside from the multitude your master has come go you out to meet him called away from the MERS called away from the audience called away from the show has this personal private audience in this third pole example and he took him aside from the multitude put his fingers in his ears and spit and touched his tongue mouth to mouth and looking up to heaven he sighed and said unto him that is be opened that book was sealed and you were sealed the book was opened you're opened in straight way his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain this is the hour this is the time this is the day with stamy lips and other tongues will I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and they will speak with unknown tongues and they'll speak with another tongue and on the day of Pentecost they begin to speak in another tongue and what happened others heard it in their own language and it said that men from all over the world were gathered together out of every nation under heaven and when the Holy Ghost fell they began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and they were all confounded because every man heard them speak in his own language brother bradam said that the leod dean Pentecostal tongues was back to the Tower of Babel because all it was was tongues and Paul taught the church except you utter by tongue's words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken if you know not the meaning of the voice you're nothing more than a barbarian crude and rude speech speaking a foreign language that can't be understood he says you should seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church if I speak with tongues pray with tongues sing with tongues he says my understanding is unfruitful but if I'm going to do anything I want it with understanding if I'm going to sing let me sing with understanding if I'm going to pray let me pray with understanding if I'm going to enjoy the fruit of the spirit if I'm going to enjoy the gifts of the Spirit let me still with El my getting get understanding I'd rather speak five words with understanding he said that my voice with that by my voice I might teach others also what is the emphasis what is greater what is what has its worth the greatest worth the word of God taught than 10,000 words in an unknown tongue I'd rather have five words five words to teach than a 10,000 words that can't be understood he says Brethren this is 1 Corinthians chapter 14:20 Brethren be not children in understanding how be it in Malice be children be innocent don't be experienced with it but in understanding be men he said tongues verse 22 brother John wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe brother brandom said they shall speak with new tongues I don't mean the uncertain sound they speak with knowledge with Revelation they had a real gift of speaking in tongues there's something takes place when they do that's not uncertain that's no sound of unbelief not at all if it's a lot of carrying on like we see a lot of times that's unbelief but when you speak with words with interpretation with Revelation Hallelujah that's the gospel Bell tolling it's no uncertain sound amen what is it bringing you to that Royal diadem that clear speech the tongue of the stammers the babes who've been birthed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost who shouted who danced who cried who rejoiced to frolic they grow up to fullness and they are able to speak clearly and plainly what's beautiful about the mark of maturity is that the more mature we become the better we're able to articulate and speak to those who don't understand humble ourselves to get down on their level take someone who's matured a little bit to be a mom matured a little bit to be a dad to have the patience to work with the young on so that they could grow up my goodness with the spiritual nonsense today preachers are changing the congregation's diaper and the congregation is changing the preachers diaper but Isaiah 32: 5 and 6 the vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the turl said to be bountiful now notice this is discernment there's full understanding the vile which is foolish is not going to be called liberal which is Noble you're going to know the vile are foolish they're not Noble you're going to know the churl the one that's a scoundrel he's not rich what is it you come to discern between good and evil you're growing up you can catch the spirit of things you going to say well yeah that's that's all good that's good yeah Holy Spirit does that but that's not the oh that's that's good that's wonderful but there there's more because notice the vile person will speak villainy because why his heart will work iniquity to practice hypocrisy heart's not turned language doesn't change and to utter err against the Lord and to make empty the soul of the hungry and he'll cause the drink of the Thirsty to fail this is Pentecost diagnosed it works his faith and I can say this there was a word test in there brother B touches on that quite a bit in that Series in Shor works as Faith expressed it's a wonderful one to go through to look at it's beautiful the heart of the chur is H hypocritical they speak and they utter things that are empty that deprive the people of their substance but there's going to be a bride that begins to speak plainly that grows up and works as Faith expressed he says they could not follow Israel out why they were denominational Egyptian babies they could not follow that word if they did they had to leave Egypt n was good to them and they couldn't do it although they could impersonate The Works do what Moses did but their Folly was made manifest when it come time to leave then God really poured it out out on them same now they might do all kinds of false impersonations and things that don't do nothing but magnify the right thing and any believing child knows that's the truth here you see in plain view then the works of their Folly of their impersonation brother Bram is speaking very hard very plain to the Le Dean Church age brother Bram says in the sermon musicians please come and trying to do a god of service without it being its will the tongues of the stammers shall be ready to speak plainly our ears will be opened and our tongue will be loosed and we I'll speak plainly the bride will prophesy again declare things that are only known by Revelation he says now is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals have been opened now when the complete things that the reformers left has to be opened and only Malachi 4 can do that because it takes the Revelation straight from God to an individual to do so listen the ministry of Malachi 4 is to restore the hearts of the children back to their Pentecostal fathers is it back to Pentecost yes you got to go got to go back to Pentecost but what is unique to the Pentecostal experience the Seal of God that's the most important thing but notice those p hostile fathers are now what fathers they grew up and so we too in pattern enter into Hearts being restored back as children to the Faith of Our Fathers it's a faith that begins and it's a faith that's finished and that's the work of the Holy Ghost in This Hour this is what the message of the hour is doing now brother brandham said in the invisible Union we're at the end so what does it have to do now lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened the word to be ripened in your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about maybe Lord willing on Wednesday night we'll get into that that greenness a little bit but I I I just felt I I thought I was going to go a little bit different direction today because I wanted to get into when they don't grow up and and hopefully conclude this series this sub series here pretty soon if you're green it means you got life in you and you don't want to fail to grow up so that the life leaves and you're dead and so there's there's a difference there's there's a one median medium there's one middle between starchy and and and fleshly and it's right in the middle with God's word and there's a pattern for this and where it is today is laying in the presence of the sun to be ripened to bring forth and live the message that brother Brandon was preaching and we're living in a time there has been a great outpour to the Holy Spirit the bride is enjoying all that the Holy Ghost has for her and we allow God to do and move as he would see fit but we know where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and what does that mean there's liberty to become men Liberty to become women the Liberty that it's been turned into is not the Liberty that the Bible speaks of and so the most important thing is for the word to be ripened in our heart to bake out all the greenness so we could come into the First full stature in this Union with Christ for it's through this invisible Union that's going to bring forth the full word to be born into manifestation again God bless you I'd like to pray with you amen let's stand
