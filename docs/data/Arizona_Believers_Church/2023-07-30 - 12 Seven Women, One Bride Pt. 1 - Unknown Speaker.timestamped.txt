[0:00] I want to jump into a subject today and
[0:03] probably be a couple parts on this but
[0:05] if the title is seven women one bride
[0:07] and taking it from Isaiah chapter four
[0:10] there are seven women one bride just to
[0:13] give some foundation for where we are in
[0:15] this series right now we looked at and
[0:17] have been looking at mystery Babylon as
[0:19] we see it in the scripture kind of been
[0:21] tracking it through scripture from its
[0:22] Origins and then we see New Jerusalem
[0:25] brought right up next to it there in the
[0:27] scripture and this mystery Babylon in
[0:31] the New Jerusalem we could use as
[0:33] representations of the culmination of
[0:35] two kingdoms one is Satan's kingdom and
[0:37] mystery Babylon but then also New
[0:39] Jerusalem is the climax and culmination
[0:41] of the kingdom and as the Bible gives us
[0:45] the symbols and the description we see
[0:47] that Satan's kingdom is symbolized as a
[0:49] harlot yet God's kingdom is represented
[0:52] as a bride and Wednesday night for those
[0:55] of you who are able to catch it we spoke
[0:58] on the devil's lie versus the truth of
[1:01] God has taken a statement that brother
[1:02] Branham uses how the devil's lies and
[1:04] the devil's Devils lie the lie and the
[1:07] devil's Mysteries rose up against the
[1:09] truth of God and the mysteries of God in
[1:12] Babylon or in Babel in those very
[1:14] origins of organized religion and it's
[1:17] the devil's lie that tries to
[1:19] impersonate the truth of God
[1:21] Satan doesn't want to be 180 degrees
[1:24] from God overtly in in image and
[1:27] pretense he wants to be confused as God
[1:30] and the devil's life can be so close
[1:33] and so like it and it contains so much
[1:36] of the other the elements of truth that
[1:39] it could deceive the elect if God made
[1:41] it possible
[1:42] just as the woman was deceived in the
[1:44] beginning because it was possible God
[1:47] just flips the script in the end and
[1:49] makes it impossible for his bride to be
[1:51] deceived
[1:52] and some context for
[1:55] uh continuing on this I want to bring
[1:58] back a lot of the things we ministered
[1:59] on the tares and the wheat and the
[2:02] parable of the sower we realize that in
[2:04] the end of the world the tares are
[2:07] separated from the wheat so as we
[2:09] mentioned that there is a similarity
[2:12] between the two Vines and their Twins
[2:14] and they look a lot alike and they have
[2:16] the the tares that are growing up
[2:18] alongside the wheat and as they rep are
[2:20] represented in plant they look very much
[2:23] alike but there is a separation or
[2:25] distinction that ultimately comes or
[2:27] something that's going to separate out
[2:29] who the elect are from everyone else and
[2:32] in Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 30 it says
[2:34] let both grow together until the Harvest
[2:37] this is speaking of the good seed and
[2:39] The Bad Seed
[2:41] and in the time of harvest Harvest I
[2:44] will say to The reefers Gather ye
[2:46] together first the tares and bind them
[2:48] in bundles to burn them but gather the
[2:51] wheat into my barn and as he's given a
[2:54] parable we recognize that there's some
[2:55] symbolic order that's taking place and a
[2:57] symbolic process of The Good Seed which
[3:00] is the word of God that has been sown
[3:02] and the Bad Seed which is sown by the
[3:04] wicked one and how ultimately there
[3:07] comes a time when they there's no
[3:08] further expression or manifestation of
[3:11] these seeds and it's at that time that
[3:13] there's going to be a separation so
[3:15] Jesus picks it up in verse 39 he says
[3:17] the enemy that sowed them is the devil
[3:19] so he's telling us who it is that sowed
[3:21] these tares the Harvest is the end of
[3:24] the world and the reapers are the Angels
[3:27] so he lets the two plants grow up
[3:29] together what's the reason he says
[3:31] because they look so much alike that if
[3:33] you're going to go in and try to uproot
[3:34] the tears you're going to uproot the
[3:36] wheat also so wait until the very last
[3:39] when there can be a separation Nation
[3:42] because God's going to allow it to
[3:44] happen God's going to do the things that
[3:45] are necessary to see that the Harvest
[3:47] happens so he says the Harvest is the
[3:49] end of the world the reapers are the
[3:50] Angels there's different ways that we
[3:52] could bring that in the word of God to
[3:53] see what those are those are ministers
[3:56] and Messengers that are going to
[3:57] separate out the tares from the wheat
[4:00] and if I could say it this way there
[4:01] will be Ministries that are going to
[4:03] gather the tares together and there'll
[4:04] be a word of God that gathers the wheat
[4:06] together and the end of the world
[4:08] brother Adam says it's the end of an age
[4:11] where he says this day
[4:13] so this time of the separation of the
[4:16] tares from the wheat and the Gathering
[4:18] Together one's bundled to be burned the
[4:20] other one is Gathering of the weed into
[4:21] my barn this time of the Harvest it is
[4:25] the rapture
[4:26] we could just spend so much more time on
[4:29] that particular aspect of the timing of
[4:31] this but that is the rapture and brother
[4:33] Bram says there is a difference between
[4:34] the church and the bride now catch this
[4:36] part because to the bride the Rapture is
[4:38] a revelation
[4:39] there is a difference between the church
[4:41] and the bride the bride goes in the
[4:44] rapture
[4:45] so God will separate out the righteous
[4:47] from the wicked God will distinguish his
[4:50] elect from the rest and that's done at
[4:53] the time of the Rapture at the time of
[4:55] harvest
[4:56] and there's a lot of elements that go
[4:58] into this I just feel to represent this
[5:00] now at this stage that there is going to
[5:04] be an elect that are drawn out and
[5:06] separated out from everything else
[5:08] in the Rapture in Exodus chapter or in
[5:11] The Exodus which is a type of the
[5:13] Rapture in Exodus chapter 11 verses 4 to
[5:15] 7. I want you to see the nature of God
[5:16] and hell at the end uh they grow up
[5:19] together and they're indestinguishable
[5:21] until God sets the difference
[5:23] and if the difference is the rapture
[5:25] notice it's going to be revelation
[5:27] it's going to be a revelation that's the
[5:29] difference and Moses said thus saith the
[5:31] Lord about midnight now you can see
[5:32] these parallels to the coming of the son
[5:34] of man and the cry at midnight about
[5:37] midnight will I go under the midst of
[5:38] Egypt this is that last plague and all
[5:41] the first born in the land of Egypt
[5:42] shall die from the firstborn of pharaoh
[5:44] that sitteth upon his throne even under
[5:46] the firstborn of the maid servants that
[5:48] is behind the mill and all the firstborn
[5:50] of beasts and there shall be a great cry
[5:53] throughout all the land of Egypt such as
[5:55] there was none like it nor shall be like
[5:57] it anymore
[5:58] but against any of the children of
[6:00] Israel now notice the difference in
[6:01] verses four to six now God is going to
[6:04] say as this plague hits all the land but
[6:09] against any of the children of Israel
[6:10] shall not a dog move his tongue
[6:13] this is quite a statement that there
[6:15] there's to be no menacing there's to be
[6:17] no harassing there's to be no
[6:19] tribulation that this plague is not
[6:20] going to
[6:22] hurt the children of Israel at all and
[6:24] against man or beast and this is why
[6:26] that you may know how that the Lord doth
[6:28] put a difference between the Egyptians
[6:30] and Israel
[6:32] how the Lord is going to bring a
[6:34] distinction between the two to mark them
[6:36] out to separate them that's what to put
[6:38] a difference is to be distinguished or
[6:40] set apart it means to be made wonderful
[6:42] so God is going to make just as he did
[6:46] in the Exodus he separated out Israel
[6:48] and show them to be wonderful as they
[6:50] were not partaking in all the plagues
[6:51] that Came Upon Egypt there's going to be
[6:54] a separation and a distinction in the
[6:56] end time and God is going to allow it
[6:58] represented symbolically in The Binding
[7:00] of tears to be burned in the separation
[7:02] of wheat into his barn that there's
[7:04] going to be separating out between the
[7:06] good seed and all the rest
[7:08] but the Branham says on the fourth seal
[7:10] like you give Egypt he give Egypt place
[7:12] to repent what was the last plague was
[7:15] death
[7:16] that's the last plague that hits the
[7:18] Pentecostal church it's spiritual death
[7:21] she's dead
[7:22] so it's a spiritual death that comes
[7:24] upon this Pentecostal church and this is
[7:27] in type of The Exodus this is what the
[7:31] bride is spared from
[7:33] because death is what is writing out
[7:34] that's in the name of the Lord she's
[7:36] spiritually dead he gave her place to
[7:38] repent and she's rejected it now she's
[7:41] dead she'll never rise again
[7:43] quite a statement to see that even upon
[7:45] the Pentecostal church was that last
[7:47] turn and that last restoration of the
[7:49] gifts in the church ages and then in
[7:52] just a short period of time uh they've
[7:54] organized and they've denominated
[7:55] they've come right under the Same Spirit
[7:57] of Babylon and they were given us space
[8:00] to repent an opportunity to repent even
[8:03] brother random being a messenger to that
[8:05] church uh called him to repentance and
[8:07] when they reject it they partake of the
[8:09] plague of spiritual death which is upon
[8:11] the entire plant
[8:14] that entire false Vine and even as that
[8:17] if you typed it out through the wheat
[8:18] plant itself it begins to die as the
[8:20] life moves on it dies from The Roots up
[8:22] and then in Revelations chapter 18 verse
[8:24] 4 I know we're just pulling from a lot
[8:26] of different places over the last few
[8:27] weeks and another heard another voice
[8:30] from Heaven saying come out of her which
[8:32] is Babylon my people that you be not
[8:35] partakers of her sins and that you
[8:37] receive not of her plagues so there is
[8:40] going to be a separating out of the
[8:42] wheat from Babylon that there's going to
[8:45] be a distinction made there's going to
[8:46] be a voice that calls the bride out I
[8:48] know you all know this and this is um
[8:50] easy to be understood with your history
[8:52] and the word of God this voice calls the
[8:54] bride out of Babylon so that she is not
[8:57] judged or burned or partakes of her
[9:00] plagues
[9:02] if if anyone refuses The Voice they're
[9:04] going to they're going to have a strong
[9:05] delusion they're going to believe V LIE
[9:07] there's going to be a spiritual death
[9:09] that comes upon them there's going to be
[9:10] a lot of ramifications for that so
[9:12] there's a voice that gets the attention
[9:14] of the leg to draw them out so that they
[9:16] do not partake in the plague
[9:19] brother Branham says in Discerning the
[9:21] body of the Lord he says we need
[9:22] discernment we need the Discerning by
[9:24] the word the words right take the word
[9:26] God's words always right
[9:28] we can't discern by what people think
[9:30] what intellectuals tell us what
[9:33] psychiatrists tell us we got to go by
[9:35] What God Says
[9:36] that's more important now than ever got
[9:38] to bring it back to the word of God
[9:40] we've got to go back to what God has
[9:42] said about it in the beginning when the
[9:44] devil preached a sermon in Genesis 3
[9:45] that contained all these truths that
[9:47] even subsequently appear to be
[9:49] Vindicated you won't surely die but the
[9:51] day you eat your eyes will be opened you
[9:53] shall become as good as God's knowing
[9:55] good and evil and the subsequent events
[9:57] and even What God Says proves what he
[9:59] said was true and he can even say see
[10:02] you didn't die
[10:04] but yet you go back to what God Said and
[10:07] even if it doesn't matter if they didn't
[10:08] die within that 24-hour period or even
[10:10] die 400 years later God said the day you
[10:13] eat that day you die you go back to what
[10:15] God Said in the original and that's true
[10:18] no matter what intellectuals tell us
[10:19] what psychiatrists tell us no matter how
[10:21] much truth it may seem that the devil
[10:23] has you always have to go back to the
[10:25] word of God to line up the inspiration
[10:28] brother bam continues in that sermon the
[10:30] last plague that hit Egypt was death the
[10:33] last plague that hits the church is
[10:34] spiritual death
[10:35] what we need today is a spiritual
[10:37] awakening the spiritual awakening to
[10:39] discernment
[10:40] this is part of the bride's Revival the
[10:43] church can recognize pulls and signs and
[10:46] wonders and uh and they can sense that
[10:48] there's a great move of God but what
[10:49] they can't do is recognize the Awakening
[10:52] of the Bride
[10:54] and the sermon Christianity versus
[10:55] idolatry
[10:59] brother Brown I'm pulling from all those
[11:01] symbolisms of how that babylonianism is
[11:04] mixed in with Christianity and through
[11:06] the uh through the Roman Catholic Church
[11:08] it's there's paganism mixed in with
[11:10] religion he says you've got to know the
[11:12] word stay on the word the great battle
[11:14] is at hand we've played church for years
[11:17] and years but the Hours come now that
[11:19] when Janice and jambres and Janice will
[11:21] withstand Moses as the Bible said they
[11:23] would now how did they withstand Moses
[11:25] by doing what he did
[11:27] so it's an impersonation it's to say oh
[11:30] you want Miracles we've got miracles you
[11:31] want signs we've got signs uh you've got
[11:34] interpretation we've got an
[11:35] interpretation so this is coming to the
[11:38] battlefield where it's not uh
[11:41] this overt rejection but uh well even as
[11:45] balaam's messages aren't we all the same
[11:47] you know why split hairs and why try to
[11:49] be so different and why why why why why
[11:51] why separate or why why do this so
[11:54] there's a there's a withstanding of the
[11:56] Bible and with standard of the word of
[11:58] God through those types of
[11:59] impersonations and he says it's going to
[12:01] be be spiritual battle conflict
[12:05] there'll be some just continue on
[12:07] denominational church will just move
[12:09] right on into denomination and go on the
[12:12] way it goes but I mean and that that's
[12:14] quite a statement that they're not
[12:16] actually battling it out they're just
[12:17] continuing on it's kind of going with
[12:19] the flow but the real True Believer is
[12:21] coming to that Battlefield
[12:23] that battlefield of being withstood that
[12:25] battlefield of being challenged that
[12:26] battle of having to make the choice and
[12:28] recognize the distinction and you better
[12:30] be Versed and know what you're doing or
[12:31] you could take an evil spirit so easy
[12:33] and not know
[12:35] so there's that influence and maybe even
[12:38] inspiration how you have to be so
[12:40] careful because the evil spirit is going
[12:42] to be so close that twin of Matthew 24
[12:45] 24 is so close he says you could take an
[12:47] evil spirit so easy and not know if it's
[12:49] contrary to this word don't believe it
[12:51] stay with that word
[12:53] they've got to stay with the word of God
[12:55] so that we can
[12:57] be inoculated against the deception that
[13:00] the devil uses to accomplish his agenda
[13:03] there will be a separation there's going
[13:05] to be there are twins that come from
[13:07] every Revival there's a spirit that is
[13:09] so close it can deceive the elective
[13:11] possible there's signs Miracles and
[13:12] wonders there's the devil's lie which is
[13:15] 99 true
[13:17] but not the truth and then you have
[13:18] God's truth which is a hundred percent
[13:20] true but the lies so close to it that
[13:23] things can get flip-flopped and which
[13:24] one is it but God will give his elect
[13:26] discernment and what we ought to be
[13:28] praying for is revelation more than
[13:30] anything because there is a time where
[13:32] God will be revealed himself so that we
[13:35] can know
[13:36] the difference between the two and
[13:38] recognize the difference between the two
[13:41] in Revelations chapter 17 I'm going to
[13:44] read verses one to five this is our now
[13:46] we're going I believe we're going
[13:47] forward at this point
[13:54] it says and there came one of the Seven
[13:55] Angels which had the seven vials and
[13:58] talked with me saying unto me come
[14:00] hither
[14:01] I will show unto thee the Judgment of
[14:03] the great that sitteth upon many
[14:05] Waters now I have not changed
[14:08] my flow I'm still in that distinction
[14:11] and that's separating out because the
[14:13] tears are bound to be bound together to
[14:15] be burned and that's judgment that comes
[14:17] upon the tares and here he's saying come
[14:19] hither I will show Thee the Judgment of
[14:21] the great that sitteth upon many
[14:23] Waters uh judgment there that Crema
[14:25] which comes from cream acrino it's a
[14:28] determination so we say let me look come
[14:30] let me tell you the Judgment of the
[14:32] great it means to to pronounce an
[14:34] opinion of
[14:36] so there's going to be a determination
[14:37] about this great and what we read
[14:40] in 17 and also 18 is the the
[14:43] determination of it what's really true
[14:45] about it but there's different clues
[14:47] that are given in the midst of it to
[14:49] suggest that one could look at it and be
[14:51] in awe or amazement of it in not know
[14:54] that it's the great
[14:56] so it says let me show you the Judgment
[14:58] or the determination or to pronounce the
[15:01] opinion of the great and that word
[15:03] also carries with it the meaning to
[15:05] approve to esteem or to prefer
[15:08] so if there's going to be a judgment or
[15:10] determination
[15:11] there there has to be it would be like
[15:14] taking a test and it's called a you have
[15:17] a it's called a single choice test or a
[15:19] true test
[15:20] and there's only there's a question with
[15:22] only one choice hey
[15:24] are a bunch of questions true or true
[15:27] it's just single option but where
[15:30] there's two to distinguish from and as
[15:33] you have but maybe an adversarial
[15:34] process and you have one that would sue
[15:36] and one that would defend and as you
[15:38] have the mystery Babylon versus the New
[15:39] Jerusalem you have the devil's lie
[15:41] against the truth of God if there's
[15:43] going to be a judgment of the one it
[15:46] also declares the opinion of the other
[15:49] that if you find or if you if you find
[15:52] judgment against somebody so I've been
[15:54] judged guilty it shows that the victim
[15:57] is declared to have been offended or
[16:00] wronged there's there has to be the
[16:02] other side of the other case to it other
[16:04] side of the case so the Judgment of the
[16:07] Great Horror the opinion of the great
[16:08] this determination of the is
[16:10] not complete unless we take from it or
[16:14] unless we have God's opinion of the
[16:16] Bride
[16:18] the Judgment of the great Harlot okay
[16:20] well I mean if that's all there is we
[16:22] maybe we could all agree that's not a
[16:24] good thing but you don't fully
[16:26] understand his opinion of the the city
[16:28] until you see his opinion of his bride
[16:32] so this one the seven of the seven
[16:34] angels with the seven vials says come
[16:36] I'll show you the Judgment the opinion
[16:39] of the great and then in
[16:40] Revelations 21 9 and there came unto me
[16:42] one of the Seven Angels which had the
[16:44] seven vials full of the seven last
[16:45] plagues notice it's the same and talked
[16:48] with me saying come hither I will show
[16:50] Thee the bride the Lamb's wife
[16:53] the same one that's binding that's
[16:56] showing us The Binding of the Babylon is
[16:58] now showing us the glory of New
[17:00] Jerusalem
[17:01] and it's Revelation 17 that opposes
[17:04] Revelations 21 so he could there could
[17:06] not be an exposing of Babylon by that
[17:09] light without declaring the True Light
[17:14] this that we see in Revelation 17 is the
[17:16] devil's creation
[17:18] to the mimic to God's bride if I could
[17:22] say this way Revelations 21 is what the
[17:24] devil wanted
[17:25] but Revelation 17 and 18 is what he
[17:27] produced
[17:29] and God's opinion of the great Horrors
[17:31] we could read the Judgment of it is
[17:34] countered immediately by the glory of
[17:36] his bride his glory in his bride his
[17:38] opinion of his bride
[17:40] and this is I would say the key
[17:44] I I'd like you to hold in your mind as
[17:46] we go forward
[17:48] it's it really is I don't mean this to
[17:50] be any slight but it's it's really
[17:52] Elementary
[17:53] well Elementary may not be the right
[17:55] word
[17:56] but there is a pro there's an academic
[17:59] process or just an intellectual process
[18:00] a fundamental process to be able to read
[18:03] the scripture and see the symbolic
[18:05] representation of both
[18:07] even to the point to where symbols are
[18:09] given and even within the chapter itself
[18:11] it says this is what it means
[18:13] it's not just I even realized for myself
[18:16] that as you grow up you hear Revelation
[18:18] book of symbols and symbolism and
[18:20] everything and we just we almost make it
[18:22] more mysterious than it needs to be in
[18:24] our in our heads if you're if reading it
[18:27] and just kind of
[18:30] even if there has to be some intensity
[18:31] or perseverance to do this you could
[18:34] just take away from the scripture these
[18:36] symbols relate to Babylon these symbols
[18:38] relate to New Jerusalem and all you've
[18:40] done is just been able to read it
[18:43] and even historians and theologians can
[18:47] play scripture
[18:49] it's like oh well this relates to this
[18:50] and this relates to that and this goes
[18:52] back to the Book of Daniel all you're
[18:54] doing is just being able to read it and
[18:56] recognize Symmetry and connections and
[18:59] as the the chapters unfold in the Book
[19:01] of Revelation there's things that are
[19:02] said that these things can be pieced
[19:04] together or anyone could read the Bible
[19:06] and piece together the symbols but it
[19:09] takes God to open your eyes to see the
[19:11] Fulfillment
[19:13] because God interprets his word by
[19:14] bringing it to pass
[19:16] and the Vindication is the manifestation
[19:18] and a lot could be said about mystery
[19:20] Babylon a lot can be said about New
[19:22] Jerusalem and historians theologians and
[19:24] even all of us as message Believers can
[19:26] agree that these symbols all point to
[19:28] these things but what happens when it ha
[19:30] when it's happening
[19:32] what then
[19:34] now let's continue with verse 1 of
[19:35] Revelation 17 there came one of the
[19:38] Seven Angels had the seven vials and
[19:39] talked with me saying unto me come
[19:41] hither I'll show unto thee the Judgment
[19:42] of the great that sitteth upon
[19:44] many Waters
[19:45] with whom and just recognize some of
[19:47] these words with whom the kings of the
[19:49] Earth have committed fornication
[19:51] and the inhabitants of the Earth have
[19:53] been made drunk with the wine of her
[19:54] fornication
[19:57] now the effect is upon the whole Earth
[20:02] and the verse three so he carried me
[20:05] away in the spirit Into the Wilderness
[20:08] quite a statement letter the spirit Into
[20:10] the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit
[20:13] upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[20:15] full of names of blasphemy or
[20:17] Blasphemous names having seven heads and
[20:20] ten horns now these there's greater uh
[20:23] there's interpretation given to this
[20:24] within this chapter what the seven heads
[20:26] mean and these different uh elements
[20:28] that we're reading here but I just want
[20:29] to pull out the
[20:31] the the the high parts here
[20:35] the Scarlet colored Beast is full of
[20:36] names of blasphemy it has seven heads
[20:38] and ten horns and the woman which sat
[20:41] upon this Scarlet colored Beast was
[20:42] arrayed in purple which is a symbol of
[20:44] royalty in scarlet color and decked with
[20:47] gold and precious stones and Pearls
[20:49] having a golden cup in her hand we
[20:53] mentioned even on Wednesday night just
[20:55] this this the symbolism between the
[20:57] things of God and now this mystery
[20:59] Babylon and this cup in her hand is full
[21:01] of the Abomination and filthiness of her
[21:03] fornication and her upon her forehead
[21:05] was a name written mystery
[21:07] Babylon the Great
[21:09] the mother of harlots
[21:11] and I like to say mother of Abominations
[21:15] of the earth she's the source and the
[21:18] reason
[21:19] for all these things foul and sinful and
[21:21] loathsome all these these things that
[21:23] exist in the world today have been
[21:25] propagated and spread by this this
[21:28] mystery Babylon the great the mother of
[21:30] harlots and Abominations of the Earth
[21:32] and we're just reading we're just
[21:34] reading this
[21:35] and we could take away from this by
[21:38] reading this and say this is the word of
[21:39] God that this woman is the great
[21:42] and she's very being carried by a beast
[21:45] with seven heads and ten horns
[21:48] right okay I think sometimes I joke and
[21:52] you guys think wait a minute is there a
[21:54] pun in there what did we just miss and I
[21:56] could be Mis just miss speaking and
[21:58] you're doing good not to say Amen but
[22:00] this Beast had seven heads and ten horns
[22:03] and the Beast represents ungodly power
[22:06] that's what a beast represents
[22:08] represents a power it doesn't mean that
[22:09] it has that we're all looking around for
[22:11] dragons with seven heads and ten horns
[22:13] and it's gonna Express itself this way
[22:15] it's symbolic representation of a power
[22:18] spiritual Powers Brother Band calls it
[22:19] an ungodly power and all would agree
[22:22] this Beast represents an ungodly power a
[22:25] woman now in Revelation 17 being carried
[22:28] by being upon this Beast let's just look
[22:33] at Revelations chapter 12 verses 3 and 9
[22:35] we'll look at Revelations chapter 13. I
[22:37] want you to recognize
[22:39] what this Beast is and there appeared
[22:41] another Wonder in heaven and behold a
[22:43] great red dragon having seven heads and
[22:45] ten horns and seven crowns upon his
[22:47] heads notice the same language that we
[22:49] read about revelation 17. so the Bible
[22:52] is it describes in Revelations 12 this
[22:54] great red dragon now it's described in
[22:55] Revelation 17 as a Scarlet colored Beast
[22:58] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[23:01] heads and ten horns here it's described
[23:04] as a red dragon seven heads ten hordes
[23:06] seven crowns upon his heads verse nine
[23:09] in the Great Dragon was cast out now
[23:13] watch how it goes all the way back
[23:15] and it tells us this who who were seen
[23:19] even be dealt with in this moment that
[23:21] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[23:23] who deceiveth the whole world and the
[23:25] deception isn't necessarily beginning at
[23:28] the time of the lie in laodicea or when
[23:31] the bride is taken away and there's he
[23:33] has full power and dominion over the
[23:34] Earth it began in heaven and in the
[23:37] garden and continued on Earth in the
[23:39] Garden of Eden and has been continuing
[23:40] ever since so it says he deceives the
[23:42] whole world we could even say the
[23:45] present world when it's uh in in a
[23:47] future time but as from the beginning of
[23:49] time he has been there as a Deceiver
[23:52] and he was cast out into the Earth and
[23:54] his angels were cast out with him that
[23:57] great dragon that Satan in his satanic
[23:59] religion
[24:00] all false religion all organized
[24:02] religion is represented in there I know
[24:04] that we want to think oh Catholic church
[24:06] it's it's it's it's a it's the Roman
[24:09] Catholic Church
[24:10] the the emphasis that brother Branham
[24:12] put on it wasn't just the Catholic
[24:14] Church
[24:15] and this is where it changes because
[24:17] brother Madam wasn't brother Adam didn't
[24:19] just get this inspiration that the
[24:21] Catholic church was bad and he starts
[24:22] preaching that and everybody's like what
[24:24] in the world is he talking about you had
[24:25] a lot of evangelicals and Pentecostals
[24:27] and Protestants saying you better
[24:28] believe it it's the great Harlan it's
[24:31] the there she is Mystery Babylon
[24:32] it's the Roman Catholic church and
[24:34] theologians historians and Messengers uh
[24:36] had agreed on that Roman Catholic church
[24:39] but now the messenger comes and as it
[24:41] begins to that Razor's Edge he's saying
[24:43] organized religion
[24:45] whether it be atheism agnostic science
[24:50] Protestant
[24:52] interdenominational you name it he's an
[24:54] organized religion is the mark of the
[24:57] beast which we could read about in these
[24:59] scriptures so the Scarlet
[25:02] Beast this red dragon at Satan's kingdom
[25:04] it's Babylon
[25:05] Revelations 13 1-4 and I stood upon the
[25:08] sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up
[25:10] out of the sea having seven heads and
[25:12] ten horns recognize again this uh
[25:16] these scriptures and I'm reading these
[25:18] so that you can see what what the woman
[25:19] is writing in Revelation 17.
[25:22] that old serpent called the devil Satan
[25:25] and now as we see that he has seven
[25:27] heads and ten horns and upon his horns
[25:29] ten crowns and upon his head the name of
[25:31] blasphemy and that's what ties it back
[25:33] into Revelation 17 and we see that this
[25:36] is also a characteristic of Revelations
[25:37] 12.
[25:39] and the Beast which I saw was like unto
[25:41] a leopard and his feet were as a feet of
[25:43] a bear and his mouth is the mouth of a
[25:45] lion
[25:46] and the dragon gave him his power and
[25:49] his seat in great Authority where does
[25:53] it derive its power where does it get
[25:55] its unction and it's inspiration saying
[25:58] the devil has done it the dragon gave
[26:00] him power and I saw one of his heads as
[26:02] it were wounded to death and his deadly
[26:03] wound was healed and all the world
[26:04] wandered at the Beast and they worshiped
[26:07] the dragon which gave power unto the
[26:09] Beast this is what they're worshiping
[26:11] the dragon they gave power to the Beast
[26:13] do you see Satan do you see Lucifer
[26:16] then they worship the dragon which gave
[26:18] power to the Beast and they worshiped
[26:19] the Beast saying who is like unto the
[26:20] Beast who is able to make war with him
[26:23] so you can see the Antichrist false
[26:25] prophet the Beast these are the this is
[26:27] the same spirit
[26:29] even brother bam talks about the three
[26:31] stages of Satan a lot of people
[26:32] recognize these three stages of Satan
[26:34] it's if I could say this three satanic
[26:37] pulls or draws or influences or
[26:39] attractions
[26:41] and I've read that so that we could
[26:43] identify that Satan is giving power to
[26:46] the Beast that is carrying the woman
[26:50] this woman that we see and she's
[26:51] foreshadowed into Revelation 16 and but
[26:54] here in 17 and 18 more specifically
[26:56] spoken of we see that this woman is
[26:59] being carried by this red the Scarlet
[27:01] colored Beast This Woman's power is from
[27:04] Satan
[27:07] brother Branham in the church age book
[27:08] writes remember this is the false Vine
[27:11] let it name the name of the Lord
[27:15] it does so only in a lie
[27:18] its headship is not of the Lord but of
[27:21] Satan let it name the name of the Lord
[27:24] but it does so only in a lie
[27:27] it may name the name of the Lord but it
[27:29] does so lying
[27:31] because the headship is not of the Lord
[27:33] the headship is of Satan
[27:35] it finally ends up completely identified
[27:37] with the Beast and here he says it in
[27:40] plain English the riding on the
[27:41] Scarlet Beast distinctly shows her power
[27:43] is the god of force
[27:46] now that's that should be alarming
[27:49] we want to recognize any time in our
[27:51] lives where the lower G God of force
[27:56] is driving us to do something not a god
[27:58] of faith
[28:00] but a god of force these are the shadows
[28:01] of Catholicism that still exist within
[28:04] undenominational
[28:05] non-denominational churches independent
[28:08] uh message churches even where they
[28:11] exercise the power of the Beast and say
[28:13] oh well we're not Roman Catholic we
[28:15] don't believe in the Trinity we're not
[28:16] forcing this but they use Force to
[28:18] achieve their agenda they use Force to
[28:20] achieve the Optics because Satan is only
[28:22] concerned about Optics and how things
[28:24] look not how things really are that's
[28:25] why when something bad happens or
[28:27] there's a scandal there's a quick
[28:28] separation from it right there's no
[28:31] owning it rolling up the sleeves and
[28:32] getting down to the nitty-gritty to find
[28:34] out what's wrong this is the spirit of
[28:36] Catholicism that exists it's all about
[28:38] the pretense and we need to recognize
[28:40] Even in our own lives when we're being
[28:42] driven by organized religion by the
[28:45] headship of Satan and not Revelation
[28:48] which is God's Force
[28:52] it shows that the god of force Satan and
[28:54] not our God the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:57] what's moving this is what it shows
[29:01] and we realize that in Revelations
[29:03] chapter 17 you can take this from this
[29:06] it's important for us to recognize that
[29:08] this Beast
[29:11] is Incarnate in the people
[29:14] it's going to be in in the people that
[29:17] and it's represented by this woman and
[29:19] her power upon the waters even in
[29:21] Revelation 17.
[29:23] and it's this
[29:25] I don't think this is uh too much of a
[29:27] step here
[29:28] but I realize
[29:31] maybe there's a a lot more that we could
[29:33] be saying on that I just wanted to catch
[29:35] those images
[29:37] but as he was carried away in the spirit
[29:39] Into the Wilderness and saw a woman
[29:41] sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[29:44] and we and brother Branham is showing us
[29:48] that he
[29:49] all these kingdoms of this world all
[29:51] organize religion all denominations are
[29:53] represented in this
[29:55] we know that Satan offered these
[29:58] kingdoms of Babylon and of all the world
[30:01] and his power to Jesus in the wilderness
[30:04] temptation
[30:05] that when he tempted Jesus and the
[30:07] Temptations in the wilderness correspond
[30:08] to The Temptations in the Garden of Eden
[30:10] and the bride is going to be tempted in
[30:11] the same thing and all that is in the
[30:13] world or relate to those three these
[30:15] three Temptations so as Christ is being
[30:17] tempted in the wilderness Satan offers
[30:19] him catches he offers him all the
[30:22] kingdoms of the world and this power
[30:25] when it's offered to him he says you can
[30:27] have this if you worship me
[30:31] Satan doesn't want to be a prince he
[30:34] wants to be the god
[30:35] he doesn't even want to be the the king
[30:38] ruling and reigning over the kingdom he
[30:40] wants to be the God above the king given
[30:43] his light and power to the king just as
[30:46] this was reflected even in a monarchy
[30:47] even reflected in Israel he wants to be
[30:49] the one invisible and the Unseen power
[30:52] that's animating everything else so he
[30:54] wants Christ to assume the authority and
[30:56] the power as long as Christ worshiped
[30:58] Satan
[31:01] it says in Matthew Chapter 4 verses 8
[31:03] and 9 again the devil taking them up
[31:06] into an exceeding high mountain
[31:10] and showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[31:13] world and the glory of them
[31:16] you recognize how that he is showing not
[31:20] just in that moment but future
[31:23] to an exceeding high mountain and
[31:25] showing him all the kingdom of the world
[31:28] and the glory of them
[31:30] and Jesus saith on him or Satan says and
[31:33] saith unto him all these things will I
[31:35] give thee
[31:37] if thou will fall down and worship me
[31:39] these were kingdoms that Satan had power
[31:42] over that he could give
[31:44] and he offers them to Jesus
[31:47] hear all the kingdoms and the glory of
[31:49] them the power of them
[31:52] if you'll worship me if you give me your
[31:56] Allegiance I will let you have all these
[31:58] kingdoms
[32:00] all of these kingdoms are represented in
[32:03] Revelation 17 and 18.
[32:05] the Bible calls her
[32:07] the mother of harlots
[32:10] every political and religious Kingdom
[32:13] outside of the kingdom is represented in
[32:16] the mother of harlots
[32:17] every single one
[32:19] there's a kingdom on Earth today that
[32:21] says we're agnostic we're neutral we
[32:23] don't take sides we don't have an
[32:25] official religion we don't have a
[32:26] official declaration no matter how
[32:29] neutral they would try to be I don't
[32:31] mean to offend any of our Swiss fans
[32:33] here but no matter how neutral a fair a
[32:36] person wants to be Satan is the prince
[32:39] of the power of the air he he's the we
[32:41] see the Hidden Springs of agendas in
[32:42] Nations and kingdoms and who sets them
[32:44] up and who takes them down God has
[32:46] allowed Satan to occupy that place in
[32:49] every political and every religious
[32:51] Kingdom outside of the Kingdom
[32:55] think about this outside of the kingdom
[32:58] is a product of Babylon
[33:03] I don't think that's too much of a
[33:04] mouthful to say
[33:07] even if you look at it in the paradigm
[33:10] of believer make believe or an
[33:12] unbeliever
[33:13] we could put a lot of people in the
[33:14] unbelieving category
[33:18] and then we'd put the elect in the
[33:19] believing category what's the
[33:21] make-believer it's the hybrid
[33:23] make belief unbelief mixed with faith
[33:27] and everything that is make believe for
[33:29] unbelief is of the same Kingdom
[33:32] everything outside of the Kingdom every
[33:34] political organizational religious
[33:37] organization denomination structure
[33:39] system is a word that I'd like to
[33:40] probably use a system man-made system
[33:44] is out is a product of Satan's agenda in
[33:48] the beginning
[33:50] the mother of harlots then speaks of
[33:52] daughters and that's how we would refer
[33:53] to them from the message of the hours
[33:54] how it's referred to in a lot of
[33:56] different uh interpretations the mother
[33:59] of harlots I mean she had daughters
[34:01] these are organizational systems
[34:03] denominational systems these are the
[34:05] product of organized religion in Babylon
[34:08] from Babylon whether it be religious or
[34:11] political
[34:14] oh it's not I hope I'm not ruining it
[34:17] for anybody here I don't I think brother
[34:20] Tucker stopped listening years ago right
[34:23] to think Oh you mean even the the
[34:26] Republican Party
[34:27] and Libertarians please don't tell me
[34:30] that the Tea Party is of the devil
[34:33] there's no God in it
[34:36] to even think that we've already been
[34:37] told America's lost
[34:39] all right
[34:40] that the the message of the hour some of
[34:43] those sermons could have been subtitled
[34:44] I think we mentioned this a few years
[34:45] ago could have been subtitled America
[34:47] will never be great again
[34:49] that's exactly what we've already been
[34:51] forewarned so these daughters are
[34:53] organizational systems denominational
[34:55] systems belief systems man-made systems
[34:57] all designed with the intent of binding
[35:00] God's people from the truth
[35:04] this woman who brings forth daughters
[35:07] now
[35:08] and as she's being written she's writing
[35:10] on this Beast the woman brings forth
[35:11] daughters by the power of the Beast
[35:14] this is by Satan's Design This Is by
[35:17] Satan's will this is through if I want
[35:18] to say Satan's programming Satan's
[35:20] manipulation by him sowing the hybrid
[35:22] seed in the beginning
[35:24] I want to pick up on that that Satan has
[35:26] designed the systems
[35:29] Satan has uh has designed all these
[35:33] organizations all these belief systems
[35:34] all these thought systems and what it
[35:36] produces in the end and the women in the
[35:38] politics and the religions it's all
[35:41] Satan's doing or his deforming
[35:43] so we have the beast at the beginning
[35:45] and the Beast at the end
[35:47] part of those parallels just a little
[35:49] bit from Eve to Satan's Eden
[35:51] how that Satan was in the Garden of Eden
[35:54] and there he was trying to gain access
[35:57] to life and as he the beast in the
[35:59] beginning brought forth a hybrid a a a
[36:02] mixture in Cain and that's what has
[36:05] allowed to be spread out over the Earth
[36:07] is that just that little bit of Leaven
[36:08] that's been sown into it that's the
[36:10] beast at the beginning that produces a
[36:12] sun that's a hybrid now when we get to
[36:14] the end the beast at the end has
[36:15] produced daughters
[36:17] that are called harlots through a mother
[36:20] that is called a and that's what
[36:23] Satan's achievement is in the end the
[36:24] beast at the end is in that woman
[36:29] the woman in Genesis 3 we know turned
[36:31] down the word
[36:33] that's what the woman turned down in
[36:34] Genesis 3. that's this is what the woman
[36:37] does at the end it's that spiritual Eve
[36:39] the church that turns down the word you
[36:42] know I'm just summarizing a lot in
[36:43] saying that
[36:45] in the sermon what shall I do with Jesus
[36:47] called Christ brotherbraham said
[36:48] Revelation 17 they saw Rome raise up
[36:51] itself in an ecclesiastical system of a
[36:53] woman a woman the church is always
[36:56] represented by a woman
[36:59] has this
[37:01] this distinction
[37:04] now
[37:07] Lord willing on Wednesday night
[37:09] we'll talk about
[37:12] how that God can use the word church but
[37:14] actually be speaking to two different
[37:15] groups of people
[37:17] and I'll just say that there so you kind
[37:19] of recognize that just because you see
[37:20] the one woman it's not all of it
[37:22] because the church is represented by a
[37:24] woman in Revelation 17 and 18 and
[37:26] there's a voice to a bride in the church
[37:28] calling her out
[37:30] which would be the true church
[37:32] and so there's a woman is always always
[37:34] represents the church
[37:36] the woman in the beginning if we go to
[37:38] Genesis 3 receive the LIE
[37:40] if I receive an Elijah's given power she
[37:42] brings forth the son
[37:43] and when she does this she's it's after
[37:47] she has conceived
[37:49] and is bringing forth life that she's
[37:51] called the mother
[37:53] of all living
[37:55] from Eve comes to sons from those two
[37:59] sons we can say however you want to
[38:01] combine it the whole world now can go
[38:03] trace it back its origin and we realize
[38:06] that Eve then is the mother
[38:09] of all living
[38:11] and when we come to Revelation 17 we
[38:13] have the mother of harlots of the earth
[38:16] and Abominations of the earth and the
[38:19] system which deceived has all the
[38:22] Abominations and filthiness of
[38:24] fornication and the kings of the earth
[38:25] and the inhabitants of the Earth have
[38:27] all been influenced by this mother by
[38:30] this woman
[38:33] just as
[38:35] the woman in Genesis 3 became Eve
[38:38] there's a spiritual Eve in the end
[38:42] where she could claim to be the power
[38:45] over all that is left on the Earth
[38:48] in Revelations 18 7 this is what it said
[38:51] of her how much she hath glorified
[38:52] herself
[38:56] this next phrase is
[38:58] interesting and live deliciously
[39:01] she hath glorified herself and lived
[39:03] deliciously think of how that ties back
[39:05] to a woman when she eateth she wipeth
[39:08] her mouth we think delicious would
[39:10] Inspire images of fruit and these
[39:13] connections that go back she had
[39:14] glorified herself and lived deliciously
[39:16] so much torment and sorrow give her so
[39:18] now because of this is going to be
[39:19] torment and sorrow for she saith in her
[39:21] heart I sit a queen
[39:24] and am no Widow and shall see no sorrow
[39:28] this is her own estimation of herself
[39:31] cast parallels here in Revelations 18.
[39:34] it's a it's the judgments as we're
[39:36] continuing from Revelation 17. and I
[39:39] think we'll read some things here in a
[39:40] moment so you tie these things together
[39:41] though in Revelations 18 it's talking
[39:43] about this woman
[39:45] he said well talk about the city or is
[39:46] it talking about the woman well the the
[39:48] both both are represented together
[39:51] she glorifies herself she lives
[39:53] deliciously and she said in her heart I
[39:56] sit a queen
[39:57] and am no Widow and shall see no sorrow
[40:01] remember Revelations 3 17 how the woman
[40:04] says that she is Rich increase with
[40:07] goods and have need of nothing
[40:09] there's a direct parallel between This
[40:12] Woman's estimation herself in
[40:13] Revelations 18 and the laodicean church
[40:16] because these These are these are these
[40:19] are united together
[40:21] she says that she's a queen sitting over
[40:23] many kings I sent a queen I am no widow
[40:28] she claims to be Christ's bride
[40:31] I haven't been widowed I haven't been
[40:33] divorced I haven't been put away I'm
[40:35] married and there won't be no sorrow so
[40:37] there is no death
[40:39] these are her both these are her
[40:41] Proclamation she flatters herself as
[40:43] Christ's spouse and she's flattened
[40:45] herself as I will see no sorrow I sit as
[40:48] a queen I am no Widow but she's the
[40:50] of the kings of the Earth
[40:52] what she says in Revelations 18 in verse
[40:55] 7 is contradicted by the judgment and
[40:57] the opinion that God has of her so if
[40:59] you only listen to her and how she
[41:01] presents herself boy she seems glorious
[41:03] boy she seems powerful she senses the
[41:06] queen she is no we ain't a widow she'll
[41:08] see no death she has the same voice it
[41:11] seems in the same echoing as even the
[41:14] bride would have
[41:17] and that's where it does get interesting
[41:20] because if you reject all the tenets of
[41:23] Catholicism because how much it lifts up
[41:25] and glorifies the church
[41:27] then you could turn right around
[41:31] and be tearing down the bride
[41:34] because the Catholic church and
[41:35] organized religion it's just the False
[41:37] Image
[41:38] because there is going to be a woman who
[41:40] is the glory and image of God
[41:43] who is all-powerful and who is in his
[41:46] Splendor and in his glory she is there
[41:48] is going to be a woman a true woman like
[41:50] that
[41:53] this woman in Revelations 18
[41:57] she has this symmetry
[41:59] with Revelations 3 17 I'm rich increased
[42:02] with goods and have need of nothing
[42:04] brother Adam repeatedly connects those
[42:06] two together
[42:07] I said a queen I'm no Widow Rich have
[42:09] needed nothing it takes Revelations 3 17
[42:11] and ties it to Revelations 18 7.
[42:14] and if you take the theme from
[42:16] Revelations 3 the great
[42:19] is the church who's rejected Christ
[42:22] it's in this laodicean church age that
[42:24] he's put out of the camp
[42:26] she's turned down the word she's given
[42:28] her opportunity the word is opening up
[42:30] to her she's she's rejected it she's
[42:31] walked away from it so the great
[42:34] she is a great but yes says I'm no
[42:36] Widow I I I have I said a queen
[42:41] I shall see no death
[42:43] trying to position herself and she's a
[42:47] mother with daughters
[42:49] so turn with me to Isaiah chapter 4
[42:51] verse 1.
[42:52] I'll read this we'll come to verse two
[42:54] here in a moment
[43:03] in Isaiah chapter 4 verse 1.
[43:05] I want to I want to get I'm glad I got
[43:08] to this part because then this will give
[43:10] us some some things to handle grab a
[43:12] hold of as we go further and in that day
[43:16] brother Brahm said that's the end of
[43:18] time where we're living now
[43:20] marriage divorce and prostitution or
[43:22] what more what brother Brown says in the
[43:24] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[43:25] Earthly bride that's the end time where
[43:27] we're living now and he says marriage
[43:28] divorce and prostitution and what more
[43:29] parallels to the days of lot and the
[43:31] days of
[43:33] um uh Noah and in that day seven women
[43:37] shall take hold of one man saying we
[43:40] will eat our own bread
[43:42] and wear our own apparel
[43:44] only let us be called by thy name to
[43:47] take away our reproach
[43:50] now we know that it's from the Old
[43:52] Testament this is very very quickly I
[43:53] don't mean to get into this too much
[43:55] there's two distinct reproaches in the
[43:57] Old Testament to be unmarried
[43:59] three even to be unmarried or to have a
[44:02] child or to have a child outside of
[44:03] wedlock
[44:04] so to not have a child so to be
[44:06] unmarried to be Barren or to be
[44:08] unmarried and fruitful
[44:10] and so this what this woman is
[44:12] expressing is an image that we see
[44:13] repeated quite often in the Old
[44:15] Testament seven women say we'll eat our
[44:17] own bread and wear her own apparel but
[44:19] we want to take on your name so that the
[44:21] reproach is taken away
[44:24] if we found out there was a woman that
[44:26] had seven daughters or had many
[44:28] daughters and was the mother of harlots
[44:31] and said well does she have a husband no
[44:33] she doesn't have a husband
[44:35] this is a reproach
[44:37] so we see the image of a woman and her
[44:38] daughters and all these systems I want
[44:40] to see the image this is in time all
[44:42] these systems that are against Christ
[44:45] because we have seven women that have
[44:46] their own food and clothing but they
[44:49] want to have the man's name
[44:51] these seven women now represented in
[44:54] that day so it's this very specific time
[44:56] it's the end time where we're living now
[44:57] and it gathers up through these seven
[45:00] Church ages is it the type of the
[45:01] churches that have come forth through
[45:02] seven Church ages that have rejected
[45:04] Christ
[45:05] that have all organized and what
[45:07] continued on organized religion has
[45:10] continued on the life moves on in the
[45:11] true it moves on but the organized
[45:14] religion has continued on and so at that
[45:17] day there's seven women
[45:19] who have rejected Christ it's
[45:21] represented these seven churches who
[45:22] rejected Christ but they still want his
[45:24] name
[45:27] they eat their own bread and wear their
[45:28] own Peril and notice the challenge to
[45:30] laodicean church age in Revelations 3 18
[45:32] I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[45:34] in the fire
[45:35] that thou mayest be rich when they
[45:38] thought they were
[45:39] in white reignment that thou mayest be
[45:41] clothed we'll wear on a pair we'll eat
[45:43] our own bread but he's saying you need
[45:45] to buy uh gold try it in the fire you
[45:48] need white reignment in the shame of thy
[45:49] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[45:51] eyes with eyes and that thou mayest see
[45:55] there is a parallel now
[45:57] of the woman who glorifies herself who
[46:00] sits as the queen am no Widow and shall
[46:02] see no sorrow with the laodice in church
[46:04] age that's rich increase with goods and
[46:05] have need of nothing and these seven one
[46:08] women that want to take the name of
[46:10] Christ
[46:11] but have their own bread and wear their
[46:13] own apparel they're only worried about
[46:15] the pretense
[46:16] and want to have a story for their
[46:18] daughters
[46:21] this is a gentile age that's been
[46:23] represented
[46:24] in Matthew chapter 6 verses 31 and 32 it
[46:26] says therefore take no thought saying
[46:28] what shall we eat what shall we drink or
[46:30] wherewithal shall we be clothed
[46:32] for after all these things do the
[46:34] Gentiles seek
[46:36] notice he's saying do not ask what are
[46:39] we going to eat or what shall we drink
[46:40] what shall be clothed with in that day
[46:42] seven women say we know what we have to
[46:44] eat we have our own bread we'll wear our
[46:47] own apparel and Christ is saying don't
[46:49] seek your own
[46:51] don't be consumed with that that's what
[46:53] the Gentiles will seek that's what they
[46:55] seek after they're without a promise all
[46:57] they're concerned about is what they eat
[46:58] in what they wear and now with this
[47:01] blending of paganism and Christianity
[47:03] they want to have their own bread and
[47:05] wear their own apparel but be called by
[47:06] a name so the reproach is removed he
[47:08] says for all these things to the
[47:10] Gentiles seek for your heavenly father
[47:12] knoweth that you have need of all these
[47:14] things he knows your need
[47:17] and we'll Supply it
[47:19] we don't need to try to fabricate our
[47:21] own clothing fig Leaf religion we don't
[47:23] have to come up with our own bread
[47:25] it'll only gets stagnated and rotten
[47:27] over he knows what we have need of we
[47:30] ought to be those unlike the Gentiles of
[47:32] the Heathen ways and be like those whose
[47:35] eyes have been opened to see that
[47:36] there's a promise of God for his elect
[47:38] in the end time that at that day in a
[47:41] day where seven women are taking hold of
[47:42] one man let us be called Christians let
[47:45] us have your name but we want to wear
[47:47] our own clothes we want to eat our own
[47:48] bread
[47:49] that there ought to be one that is
[47:51] dependent upon him
[47:54] the Gentile churches these harlots they
[47:56] seek their own bread and clothing what
[47:59] is it it's a spirit of independence from
[48:01] God
[48:02] son whether you want to say an iron
[48:04] disposition or this uh this uh this
[48:08] nature of this woman
[48:09] where she's dependent upon herself
[48:12] and she's getting away from absolute
[48:14] dependency upon God in his word they
[48:16] want the name but not the headship of
[48:19] the word
[48:21] is that not the seat of discrepancy
[48:24] Cain wanted to worship
[48:26] he wanted he wanted to worship God
[48:28] but he wanted to do it his way
[48:30] because when shown the right way he said
[48:32] no thanks
[48:33] I'll just murder the one that had the
[48:35] revelation of the right way
[48:37] hoping there's the devil's template
[48:39] hoping that his survives
[48:42] is to the victors go the spoils and it's
[48:44] the it's the conquers that write the
[48:46] history he's hoping that in the end it
[48:48] would the record we'd be so confusing
[48:50] and cloudy
[48:51] that he would alone would be the only
[48:53] one that could be worshiped because of
[48:55] so much confusion
[48:57] notice the seven women
[48:59] want the name
[49:02] brother Bradham says in the sermon the
[49:03] Harvest time if that seed hasn't been
[49:04] germatized it'll never raise again it
[49:08] can't raise there's nothing in it to
[49:09] raise it
[49:12] so if the seed hasn't been dramatized it
[49:14] can't raised
[49:15] it's German it's the germanizing that
[49:18] raises so if there's no seed there same
[49:19] result
[49:21] and if we just become a nominal
[49:23] Christian that means a name only
[49:26] if we just become a nominal Christian
[49:28] and he pauses there are two churches in
[49:31] the world
[49:32] Church natural Church spiritual they're
[49:35] all called Christians
[49:38] now when he says Church natural that
[49:40] doesn't mean tangible I said well
[49:42] brother just show me where the church
[49:43] natural is and we could just go put our
[49:44] put our hands about right we could drive
[49:47] by it and we could plan protest or
[49:49] whatever
[49:50] it's a it's a it's still
[49:53] it's a carnal Church a natural Church
[49:56] born of a man's inclinations it's that
[49:59] Babylonian religion organized religion
[50:01] denominationalism that's the church
[50:02] natural but the church spiritual they're
[50:04] both called Christians but the church
[50:06] natural cannot raise
[50:09] can can raise the correct way it's doing
[50:12] its raising now in the world Council
[50:13] Council of churches that's all organized
[50:16] religion
[50:18] that we have to resist the notion that
[50:19] it's going to head itself up in ways
[50:21] that we think it will or has to head up
[50:23] in ways uh that are very obvious to
[50:25] everyone else and we're all going to be
[50:27] having to we pay for gas by going dirt
[50:29] right we're gonna have the barcodes on
[50:31] our forehead and and people are going to
[50:34] get up there and like trying to look at
[50:35] me and shine a black light on my
[50:37] forehead and see if I've got got the
[50:39] mark because there's all sorts of ways
[50:40] people think it's going to happen and
[50:42] how this power is going to be exercised
[50:45] and maybe don't get so caught up in
[50:48] trying to figure out what that looks
[50:49] like and just realize that a prophet's
[50:51] already said it's here
[50:54] and the only shelter is in the word
[50:58] that's the only shelter
[51:00] the shelter isn't standing out there in
[51:02] the middle of the battlefield the
[51:04] battlefield said I
[51:06] I figured you out I got you you're a
[51:08] champ you're NFC you're AI your chat bot
[51:12] 666.
[51:14] right and we figured it all out and we
[51:16] know what it is hey that could be 100
[51:18] the truth but without Christ you're
[51:20] nothing
[51:22] doesn't matter how much you've got it
[51:23] figured out if that's one thing this
[51:25] message has done so clearly is in a lot
[51:27] of ways it's Vindicated a lot of
[51:29] people's probing that they were right
[51:31] about certain things but listen what
[51:33] good does it do to tell you there's a
[51:35] tsunami coming of sin there's a power
[51:38] coming it's Antichrist and it's going to
[51:40] swallow us all up and there's going to
[51:42] be a force that takes us and everyone's
[51:44] gonna wonder and that man is incapable
[51:46] against it
[51:47] if you don't know
[51:49] if you don't have the power to take you
[51:51] out of here
[51:53] if you haven't recognized the very thing
[51:55] that gives you power against that
[51:58] what does it mean to overcome to him
[52:00] that overcometh what does it mean
[52:04] s but the Christian Rises
[52:07] the nominal Christian in name only that
[52:11] the natural church and the spiritual
[52:13] church what these are different seeds
[52:14] different life different Natures he says
[52:16] the Christian the true Christian Rises
[52:19] to meet Christ because it's a bride to
[52:21] go meet him
[52:22] there is a difference in them
[52:25] nature holds these secrets to us
[52:29] and we can see them as we watch them
[52:33] he takes us right back to the principle
[52:34] of the seed
[52:36] that's where we can see mystery Babylon
[52:39] and that's how we can see New Jerusalem
[52:41] is when we go back to the seeds
[52:44] so we have a mystery of two women at the
[52:46] end time
[52:47] one of Satan in this form of the Beast
[52:49] one of Christ you could say two Edens
[52:51] Two Cities
[52:55] and just as Satan took Jesus up to an
[52:57] exceeding high mountain
[52:59] and offered him many kingdoms
[53:03] those kingdoms are represented in women
[53:07] catch that
[53:09] Satan has offered Christ
[53:12] and I want you to think about this in a
[53:15] spiritual way he didn't just offer him
[53:19] the the mechanics
[53:22] of Kingdoms
[53:24] he said like someone offering you a
[53:26] house
[53:27] do you want this house or coming
[53:30] give me more details right
[53:32] but you remember how that when
[53:34] the near Kinsmen in the Book of Ruth
[53:37] this is so good why am I doing this at
[53:39] 11 30.
[53:41] and in the Book of Ruth the nearer
[53:44] Kinsmen was given an opportunity to have
[53:46] land
[53:48] and the Revelation was he goes yeah I'll
[53:50] take it land give it to me
[53:52] in the revelation of a woman comes with
[53:54] it
[53:55] and he goes oh no I don't want to Mar my
[53:57] inheritance
[53:58] notice that that attitude the woman came
[54:00] with it
[54:02] now when Satan offers Christ all these
[54:05] kingdoms this way
[54:07] if I could say this and if you're giving
[54:09] me some latitude and you feel that you
[54:11] need to forgive me if I'm overstepping a
[54:13] little bit but the women came with it
[54:16] and he's offered all these kingdoms
[54:18] through this way and he realizes if I
[54:20] take the kingdoms this way then I become
[54:23] the husband
[54:24] to the daughters of Satan
[54:27] if I take the kingdoms his way then the
[54:30] wives come with it and Satan's like yeah
[54:33] baby right he doesn't mind but Christ
[54:36] won't receive it that way
[54:38] because notice what he says in Matthew 4
[54:40] 10 after Satan has taken him up to this
[54:43] exceeding high mountain and shows them
[54:45] the kingdoms says I'll give you these
[54:48] and I want to say women
[54:50] I'll give you I'll let you to be I'll
[54:52] let you have these women they're yours
[54:54] if you worship me and notice what Jesus
[54:57] says get the hint Satan for it is
[55:00] written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy
[55:02] God and him only shalt thou serve
[55:05] Jesus brings it to worship now we we I
[55:07] think we rightly focus on the fact that
[55:09] he's asked him to worship Satan in order
[55:12] to receive the kingdoms but in receiving
[55:14] the kingdoms he has to worship the woman
[55:19] it's about worship it's about service
[55:21] and there's and we can even see how
[55:23] there would be a a have a taken on the
[55:25] mark of the beast
[55:27] and as we see the climax allowed to see
[55:30] what is it it's a woman's world
[55:32] it ends with the worship of a woman
[55:36] so when he asked him when he's asking
[55:38] him and I hope you can make this
[55:39] connection when he's asking Christ to
[55:41] worship Him and receive the kingdoms
[55:43] he's asking him to take these harlots
[55:46] as wife
[55:48] and he's wanting Christ to marry these
[55:50] women
[55:52] and he and he's going to if he took the
[55:54] kingdoms that way the women came with it
[55:56] so it wasn't just a response to
[55:58] worshiping Satan but it's his Judgment
[56:00] of the kingdoms
[56:02] it says Judgment of the women he says I
[56:05] can't take these kingdoms that way these
[56:07] women are filth these women are are
[56:09] putrid these women are Unfaithful he did
[56:12] not he did maybe he wanted a bride but
[56:14] he didn't want it that way
[56:18] in Revelation 17 18 and the woman which
[56:21] is revelation 17.
[56:24] which thou sawest is that great City
[56:26] Revelations 18 which reigneth over the
[56:29] kings of the Earth
[56:31] was he I just catch this in symbolic
[56:34] form this is purely you don't have to
[56:36] adopt uh this way of seeing it but this
[56:38] is this is what I see that if this woman
[56:41] now is the one that Reigns of the kings
[56:42] of the earth and he asks Christ he's
[56:45] going to give it to what's he going to
[56:46] do
[56:47] there's your husband and wife
[56:49] just to type
[56:51] we could debate about it over barbecue
[56:52] or something this afternoon and I'll be
[56:54] fine with that I love it when I get
[56:55] feedback from you
[56:57] do you see them the offer came with
[57:00] women
[57:01] and this woman is the one that Reigns
[57:03] over all the kings of the world
[57:05] and Satan is how is Satan worshiped he's
[57:07] worshiped through the and the
[57:09] harlots
[57:11] that's how he's worshiped how does he
[57:13] receive worship through organized
[57:15] religion he's receiving it through the
[57:17] mother Harlot he's receiving it through
[57:19] the heartless so how was Christ going to
[57:21] worship Him
[57:23] so when Christ says get thee behind me
[57:26] Satan
[57:28] for it is written Thou shalt Worship the
[57:31] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[57:33] serve Jesus Christ was rejecting and
[57:37] judging these women
[57:41] and it was upon that great high mountain
[57:44] says and the devil took him up into
[57:46] exceeding high mountain and showed him
[57:48] the kingdoms of this world now hopefully
[57:49] this helps you see the parallel I'm
[57:51] seeing in Revelations 21 verses 9 and 10
[57:54] and there came unto me one of the Seven
[57:56] Angels which had the seven vials full of
[57:58] the seven last pledge and talked with me
[58:00] saying come hither
[58:01] I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's
[58:04] wife
[58:05] remember Christ has taken to the
[58:07] exceeding high mountain driven of the
[58:08] spirit Into the Wilderness in Revelation
[58:10] 17 this Angel is brought into the
[58:12] Wilderness by the spirit Into the
[58:14] Wilderness and he saw a woman
[58:16] sin upon these mountains and here it
[58:17] says come hither I'll show you the bride
[58:19] the Lamb's life and he carried me away
[58:21] in the spirit to a great and high
[58:23] mountain
[58:24] and showed me that great City the holy
[58:28] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from
[58:30] God
[58:32] do you recognize the different mountain
[58:34] peaks
[58:35] that Lucifer takes him up to a very high
[58:38] mountain and from there he can see an
[58:41] imitation Kingdom from there he can see
[58:43] women and maybe a great woman there he
[58:45] sees a false Jerusalem and there given
[58:48] an opportunity to receive it he says no
[58:50] I won't take it and what's the joy that
[58:53] is set before him there on another high
[58:55] mountain they're at another great
[58:57] mountain peak he sees the great City the
[58:59] holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven
[59:01] from God
[59:03] one is worried she says I have my own
[59:05] bread I have my own clothing I know what
[59:07] I'm going to eat I know what I'm going
[59:09] to wear I just want I just need a
[59:11] husband
[59:13] I just I just need that one from Heaven
[59:16] I need that peace I need to be
[59:19] inappropriately married to the match
[59:21] piece so the the Conquering the coup can
[59:24] be complete there will be no secession
[59:27] there will be no abdication if I could
[59:30] just get him and here she's lusting
[59:32] after him and trying to entice him and
[59:34] he refuses it in the there in the
[59:36] wilderness do you not see what it is the
[59:38] bride turns down in this end time
[59:42] and hear this woman seven women taking a
[59:45] hold of one man give us your name to
[59:47] take away our reproach but we don't want
[59:48] your headship
[59:50] we'll feed ourselves and clothe
[59:52] ourselves
[59:53] and Jesus says this is what the Gentiles
[59:55] seek after
[59:56] and then he says in verse 33 but seek ye
[59:58] first the kingdom of God
[1:00:01] and his righteousness what must our eyes
[1:00:03] behind
[1:00:05] the two different kingdoms the carnal
[1:00:07] Kingdom of the Gentiles and then the
[1:00:09] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:00:12] all these things shall be added unto you
[1:00:15] and to her was granted to her was given
[1:00:19] to be to be dressed in this
[1:00:21] righteousness you see what the parallel
[1:00:23] there is then seek ye first the kingdom
[1:00:25] of God this ought to be our ambition
[1:00:27] this ought to be what we're looking for
[1:00:28] because God promised the word would be
[1:00:30] restored to his elect in this last days
[1:00:32] and we know that what Eve turned down
[1:00:35] the nominal Church turns down but we are
[1:00:38] raised up to accept
[1:00:40] what the woman turned down what the
[1:00:42] church rejects there will be a bride in
[1:00:44] the land that will receive him for in
[1:00:47] that day seven women shall take a hold
[1:00:49] of one man saying we'll eat our own
[1:00:51] bread and wear our own apparel only let
[1:00:53] us be called by thy name to take away
[1:00:54] our reproach and then it says in that
[1:00:57] day shall the branch of the Lord be
[1:01:00] beautiful and glorious
[1:01:02] then that same day there will be a
[1:01:05] branch of the Lord that's beautiful and
[1:01:06] glorious and the fruit of the Earth
[1:01:08] shall be excellent and comely for them
[1:01:10] that are escaped of Israel
[1:01:12] there you are
[1:01:14] there you are
[1:01:16] seven women trying to take a hold of one
[1:01:18] man in that day but there's a day
[1:01:21] another day that dawns
[1:01:23] and they'll be the branch the Lord will
[1:01:25] be beautiful
[1:01:26] and the fruit of the Earth
[1:01:28] the bride is answering the bride is
[1:01:31] answering to the fruit of the ground
[1:01:32] because it says the fruit of the Earth
[1:01:33] shall be excellent and comely for them
[1:01:34] that are escaped
[1:01:36] those that escape they're answering to
[1:01:38] the fruit of the ground they too are
[1:01:40] excellent and comely
[1:01:42] what is that a nod back to the garden
[1:01:45] the fruit of the ground will be
[1:01:46] excellent in Conley
[1:01:48] the fruit is God originally ordained it
[1:01:49] not the LIE
[1:01:51] but the fruit
[1:01:53] of the ground
[1:01:55] says in the
[1:01:57] flashing red light are the signs of his
[1:01:58] coming
[1:02:02] he says Brothers if you could come to
[1:02:04] your instruments Eve got from behind the
[1:02:06] word of God and that caused every
[1:02:08] heartache every graveyard
[1:02:12] every sin that was ever committed
[1:02:14] started right there
[1:02:15] here it is again
[1:02:18] women were the cause of the first fall
[1:02:20] or woman was the cause of the first fall
[1:02:22] and women end up in the end up ends up
[1:02:25] the time
[1:02:27] she started it
[1:02:29] she ends it
[1:02:31] and then he says go listen to this
[1:02:33] sermon it's just chock full of stuff
[1:02:34] that I want to read no wonder the Bible
[1:02:36] said
[1:02:37] those that escape notice how he says out
[1:02:39] of Zion not just Israel out of Zion
[1:02:41] shall be glorious in this side of the
[1:02:43] Lord
[1:02:44] there's your parallel
[1:02:46] a woman started it and a woman ends it
[1:02:49] and it would seem that the beast at the
[1:02:51] beginning
[1:02:52] has achieved his Beauty at the end
[1:02:55] and you have the Beauty and the Beast at
[1:02:57] the end
[1:02:57] and hear what Satan designed to do from
[1:02:59] the start he's accomplished in
[1:03:01] Revelations
[1:03:03] she started it she ends it
[1:03:06] but there's another voice
[1:03:09] calls elect out of Babylon and then we
[1:03:12] see her described in the preceding
[1:03:13] chapters
[1:03:15] come to another high mountain
[1:03:17] not the false Mountain
[1:03:19] but come to Mount Zion
[1:03:22] not not the natural Mountain from which
[1:03:24] we see all the kingdoms of this world
[1:03:26] but let's come to another Mountain where
[1:03:28] the marriage
[1:03:29] transpires between Christ and his bride
[1:03:32] where he turns down the seven women to
[1:03:34] be married to the one for an invisible
[1:03:36] Union
[1:03:39] no wonder the Bible said those that
[1:03:42] escape out of Zion shall be glorious in
[1:03:45] the sight of the Lord
[1:03:47] for the next few days or for however
[1:03:49] long it might be before we pick this
[1:03:50] back up
[1:03:52] who ends it
[1:03:54] what those different ends might be
[1:03:56] [Music]
[1:03:58] could you stand with me today
