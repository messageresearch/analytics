[0:00] by the grace of God tonight I want to
[0:03] encourage encourage you
[0:05] Amen to look at life as a Christian a
[0:08] little bit different
[0:10] you know that that uh you know there's a
[0:13] song We Sing he's the god of the hills
[0:15] in the valleys
[0:17] amen but you know a lot of times when
[0:20] we're in the valley you know those are
[0:23] the times when we don't feel like we're
[0:25] Christians those are sometimes those are
[0:28] the times we don't even feel like God is
[0:30] on our side
[0:31] and my subject tonight I I just want to
[0:35] use it you know in a in a in a plain
[0:38] context
[0:39] and I want to title this tonight the bet
[0:44] the BET amen you know right now we're
[0:47] we're in a in a in a season of sports
[0:50] and football and baseball and all these
[0:54] things and their bets going all over the
[0:56] place you know what everybody's betting
[0:58] on their team man and and most most most
[1:01] likely if you place down a bet you're
[1:05] putting that bet on who you think the
[1:07] winner is
[1:08] in church uh what I want us to look at
[1:11] right here in the Book of Job
[1:13] that this whole thing job with you was
[1:17] simply a bet
[1:20] between God and the devil
[1:23] the greatest trial of his life
[1:26] was just God telling the devil okay I
[1:28] bet you
[1:31] oh my
[1:32] God church but what I want us to
[1:34] understand is that God doesn't change
[1:38] and God is not afraid to put you to the
[1:41] Forefront because he's confident in the
[1:44] seed he placed inside of you he's
[1:47] confident in what you're going to turn
[1:49] out to be so what God will do God will
[1:52] allow you to be tested God will allow
[1:55] you to go through things that there's no
[1:57] explanation for just to prove to the
[2:01] devil that you will stand
[2:02] [Music]
[2:04] Hallelujah at church most of the time
[2:06] when we're going through stuff we're
[2:08] looking for explanations we're crying I
[2:10] don't know about you guys but I do
[2:12] Hallelujah I get down on my knees I cry
[2:14] to God sometimes I fast and pray and
[2:17] I'll be like Lord what's going on and
[2:19] God stays silent Hallelujah sometimes he
[2:22] answers most of the time he answered but
[2:24] Church there's been times in my life
[2:26] where God don't give me nothing I just
[2:29] have to keep pressing holy I just have
[2:31] to keep serving them and not only
[2:33] pressing and serving but with a good
[2:35] attitude because we know what a bad
[2:38] attitude can do a bad attitude can take
[2:41] a five days journey and turn it into 40
[2:43] years
[2:46] oh my that's what that's what a bad
[2:49] attitude did for the children of Israel
[2:52] God gave him a promise of a land that
[2:56] was flown with milk and honey now he
[2:58] said go possess it he was saying that
[3:01] the land is already yours what hindered
[3:04] up that possession of the land what
[3:06] hindered the people it was their
[3:08] attitudes
[3:09] they Mama they complaining we had food
[3:13] and we had drink and everything was all
[3:15] right did they realize they were slaves
[3:21] Oh my he blows me away people mommy
[3:25] complain about the church and the
[3:27] message too strict and all these things
[3:29] who are you without this message
[3:32] no more than a slave to sin no more than
[3:36] a slave in the devil's camp but God came
[3:39] Hallelujah to set us free
[3:41] oh my
[3:43] God oh I can see what kind of service
[3:44] it's gonna be let me get my watch set
[3:48] hallelujah praise the Lord
[3:51] bear with me for a second
[3:54] Hallelujah but God is so rich in Mercy
[3:59] you know he'll even
[4:01] God will even show up
[4:03] when our attitudes are not right
[4:06] the children of Israel moment and
[4:08] complaining and they say oh we had
[4:10] melons and we had good old uh fruit and
[4:14] avocado and we can make guacamole and
[4:17] all this stuff in Egypt and God
[4:19] hallelujah and God and His gracefulness
[4:23] God hallelujah brought down Manna From
[4:26] Heaven
[4:28] Hallelujah Church understand this God
[4:31] gave them food Hallelujah that nobody
[4:34] had ever tasted before
[4:37] and that's what he's done for us he's
[4:39] given us food Hallelujah other
[4:41] Generations other Church ages have never
[4:44] tasted before
[4:46] Hallelujah Baptists have never tasted
[4:48] this food we're eating upon holy
[4:50] methodists and Pentecostals they never
[4:53] tasted this food that we're eating upon
[4:55] and people are still complaining
[4:57] [Music]
[5:01] and you know but one thing about God
[5:04] will never make himself look like he's
[5:07] not able to do something Hallelujah so
[5:11] you complain you complain God knows how
[5:13] to shut our mouth
[5:15] and Time After Time God came to set the
[5:19] children of Israel's mouth they
[5:21] complained about the fool God brought
[5:23] food they complained about uh the the
[5:26] the the the manner they say our soul
[5:29] loafed this light bread
[5:32] such ungrateful people
[5:34] then God brings down Hallelujah fresh
[5:37] cooked Quail meat
[5:41] God got others in heaven
[5:43] Hallelujah Supernatural Grill hunt you
[5:47] to my rotisserie
[5:51] this was a season that they never tasted
[5:53] before
[5:55] my church
[5:56] but you look in the midst of all the
[5:59] adversity God remains faithful and I
[6:03] believe just in my own my own uh trials
[6:06] and tribulation God just wants me to go
[6:08] through things with a smile on my face
[6:13] on that one
[6:15] some people just want to be mad for no
[6:17] reason
[6:18] look man come to church look look at the
[6:21] song leader why he's bursting
[6:24] just mad don't you realize we're singing
[6:27] unto God
[6:28] we'll sing it until the most high
[6:30] Hallelujah and we can't get nothing out
[6:32] of you oh my oh my let me leave that
[6:34] alone let me leave that alone but church
[6:36] as we look right here in the Book of Job
[6:39] that's some key elements in here I want
[6:41] us to grasp no no no now the Bible says
[6:45] that the children uh the sons of God
[6:48] came to present themselves before the
[6:51] Lord and the Bible says the devil came
[6:54] also
[6:55] holy I want you to understand the only
[6:58] thing that can hinder the move of God in
[7:01] the service is somebody receiving a
[7:04] thought of unbelief in their mind
[7:07] that's the only thing that can hinder
[7:09] the supernatural in your life tonight is
[7:13] the way you think Hallelujah because
[7:15] before it manifests as a spirit you have
[7:18] to receive it first as a thought
[7:21] Hallelujah yeah we say the greatest
[7:24] battle ever fought is in the mind yes
[7:26] that is true but realize it is a battle
[7:34] Hallelujah it doesn't automatically
[7:37] belong I said praise God it ain't good
[7:40] to see hey man we're going way back
[7:42] Hallelujah she's trying to keep me
[7:44] healthy when I come to Canada amen
[7:47] but praise God Church y'all forgive me
[7:50] amen it's good to see people amen but
[7:52] Church praise God God wants us to go
[7:55] through things and appreciate his grace
[7:58] Hallelujah but a lot of times we go
[8:00] through things and we're like Lord why
[8:02] me Lord why is this I said I preached a
[8:05] message years ago why not me why not now
[8:09] Hallelujah because our goal is to be
[8:11] perfected by God but church when we look
[8:14] right here in the scripture the Bible
[8:17] says that the sons of God with the
[8:19] church and the devil came also but what
[8:22] I want you to understand is that God
[8:25] always sees the devil in the midst of
[8:27] his people
[8:28] Hallelujah he never catches God by
[8:32] surprise
[8:33] amen wherever he shows himself God knows
[8:37] where his footsteps will go before he
[8:39] does
[8:40] I know that's hard for you to believe
[8:42] but let's make something real clear God
[8:45] created the devil
[8:48] hallelujah it's like oh my I'm about to
[8:51] say something gonna shake your boots his
[8:53] life does not belong to him
[9:00] oh my
[9:01] God Satan is a tool in God's hand and
[9:04] what is that tool doing that tool is
[9:07] perfecting the bride of Christ
[9:09] [Applause]
[9:10] amen
[9:12] God created his own arch enemy he says
[9:16] you know what Lucifer Dragon Satan you I
[9:19] want you to bring the best out of me
[9:24] so the devil has a purpose and his
[9:27] purpose is to make God look great
[9:30] and dumb devil don't even realize it
[9:34] he don't even realize the church but
[9:35] look right here amen I want to show you
[9:38] Church things you go through is not a
[9:40] coincidence it's not a mistake it's not
[9:43] a perhaps they're ordained before the
[9:46] foundation of the world
[9:47] Hallelujah and church look here uh God
[9:51] says unto the devil Satan whisk comes
[9:54] down basically what are you doing here
[9:57] and Satan says you know I'm walking to
[9:59] and fro up and down the Earth trying to
[10:01] mess up somebody's life
[10:03] and look at look at God's position God
[10:07] is going to order the devil's footsteps
[10:09] now God says unto the devil have you
[10:13] considered my servant job uh oh the bed
[10:16] is on the table
[10:27] but
[10:28] Satan says of course I have
[10:32] I've been wanting him for a long time
[10:35] but you know what you're protecting him
[10:38] you got a hedge around them I can't get
[10:40] nowhere near him I can't get to his
[10:42] possessions I can't get to his family I
[10:45] can't mess up his job I can't do nothing
[10:48] even his car running right
[10:51] cause you got a hedge around them church
[10:54] I want you to know that that's just not
[10:56] for job that's for everybody in this
[10:58] room
[11:00] Hallelujah God always protects his
[11:03] children and Satan can't do nothing in
[11:06] your life except God gives him what
[11:08] permission
[11:10] Satan has to sign a permission slip
[11:14] before he take any of us on any kind of
[11:16] trip in our life he has to get a
[11:19] permission slip from God
[11:22] oh my that you know what that makes me
[11:25] want to shout hallelujah because it lets
[11:28] me know that whatever I'm going through
[11:30] God has already signed off on
[11:33] and if God has signed off on it there's
[11:35] other scripture that comes into play are
[11:37] you with me Andrew there's other
[11:39] scripture that comes into play if God
[11:41] signs up on it he's basically saying
[11:43] everything has to work out for his good
[11:49] whoa Hallelujah
[11:52] but you know what we do we look at what
[11:54] we go oh Lord why me why I'm going
[11:56] through this why don't you want to be
[11:58] perfected
[12:00] churching now
[12:02] Satan responds back to responds back to
[12:05] God and he says hey I've been wanting
[12:07] them for a while y'all know I'm
[12:08] paraphrasing he says I've been wanting
[12:10] them for a while he said but you
[12:11] protecting them you got a hands around
[12:13] them I can't get close to him he said
[12:15] but Satan said but I guarantee he says
[12:18] you think he's serving you for nothing
[12:20] you think he's serving you just to be
[12:23] serving you he's serving you because you
[12:25] protecting him and you blessing them in
[12:27] everything he does
[12:28] God said
[12:30] okay
[12:32] that's what you think
[12:34] he said well let's get something clear
[12:37] let's get something clear
[12:39] Joe my servant
[12:41] well I want you to understand about him
[12:44] see before he let the devil have him God
[12:48] had a testimony about job

[12:57] says oh Amen in uh in in verse 8 he said
[13:01] verse one and eight if you can't bro
[13:03] John put that up real quick I want the
[13:04] people to see what how God testifies

[13:10] Lord said unto Satan has thou considered
[13:13] my servant job that there is none like
[13:15] him in all the Earth
[13:18] what if God is saying that about you
[13:21] Church before you go through anything
[13:23] before any dices rolled before any
[13:26] Hammer is come down before any card is
[13:29] ever dealt God has told the devil
[13:31] Hallelujah that there is none like him
[13:34] or her in the Earth
[13:39] but he didn't stop there God put
[13:42] adjectives to job's life he said he's

[13:55] begin to look up these words these
[13:57] adjectives God was using that word

[14:02] complete
[14:04] look at what God said about job before
[14:07] he even went through the battle

[14:12] saying he's giving Satan subliminal
[14:14] messages and he can't even catch it
[14:18] Satan is Satan is in God's Walmart and

[14:57] listen what God is saying about Job look
[15:00] at God's testimony

[15:45] complete morally innocent Hallelujah
[15:48] having Integrity one who was morally and
[15:51] ethically pure that's what this word
[15:53] perfect means
[15:55] God has really pouring it on thinking I
[15:58] don't know if I was joking I would have
[15:59] been reading that smile I'd be like
[16:02] God that what you think about me
[16:05] I've been blushing all over the place
[16:07] Brothers you think about if you talk to

[16:29] that word upright means correct oh my
[16:32] right straight level Hallelujah please
[16:36] and correct straight forward amen just
[16:42] listen what God is saying about job
[16:44] before he even go through the trial now
[16:47] as we go through this trial job gonna be
[16:49] like oh my you know uh why am I even
[16:52] born I wish I would die
[16:55] when this is how God looks at him
[16:58] God looks at him as perfect in the
[17:01] upright and we go through trials and
[17:03] we're like oh God why me what did I do
[17:11] oh my God didn't see what job saw
[17:15] amen
[17:16] oh my church
[17:18] but then he says unto the devil
[17:21] nevertheless the Lord said verse 12 he
[17:24] says and the Lord said unto Satan behold
[17:27] all that he hath is in thy hands only
[17:31] upon himself put forth not thy hand so
[17:35] Satan went forth from the presence of
[17:37] the Lord and y'all know Satan probably
[17:39] was skipping to My Lou
[17:42] he probably was like oh boy I got him oh
[17:45] oh boy I've been a mess I've been a
[17:47] stripping law he probably think I've
[17:49] been a struggle I'm gonna take
[17:50] everything and God's sitting back
[17:52] laughing he like dummy didn't I tell you
[17:54] he was perfect and upright
[17:57] see Satan don't be catching it church I
[18:00] want you to understand something you are
[18:02] bride
[18:03] you are the apple of God's eye and
[18:06] there's nothing that you can go through
[18:08] Hallelujah that will take you away from
[18:11] God
[18:12] if you're God's child
[18:15] all they can do is make you stronger
[18:18] Hallelujah and I hope in this climate
[18:21] that most of us are getting stronger I
[18:24] don't know about you but I go through
[18:25] trials I have no explanation for
[18:28] but it's the goodness of God
[18:31] I've learned to smile about it now
[18:33] Hallelujah
[18:35] but church as we see
[18:38] look at what he was doing let's think
[18:39] about what the prophet of God says
[18:41] the prophet of God
[18:43] when he looked at this
[18:45] this is what he said about the whole
[18:47] situation
[18:49] he said
[18:50] oh my
[18:52] he said job
[18:55] was was taking his children through
[18:58] every the only providing approach that
[19:00] was the burnt offerings and now here's a
[19:03] little thing I want you to notice after
[19:06] all the turmoil and everything was over
[19:08] and then God had taken all his sheep and
[19:12] all his cattle and all the horses he
[19:14] said God had taken
[19:16] not the devil
[19:20] God allowed this to happen Oh my he said
[19:24] and then at the end of his chastisement
[19:28] um
[19:29] why does God what what does chastisement
[19:33] show when it comes to God
[19:35] it shows his love
[19:37] the Bible says whom God loves he
[19:39] rebuking what Jason

[19:45] tonight maybe it's the love of God
[19:47] amen maybe you didn't even do anything
[19:49] wrong God's just showing you how much he
[19:52] love you
[19:53] oh my indeed he says at the end of the
[19:55] Test match all purging God doubled to
[19:59] him amen
[20:00] after he went through what the key word
[20:02] purging amen
[20:04] he says even when you're bringing for a
[20:06] fruit I'll Purge you that you bring
[20:08] forth more fruit
[20:10] oh praise God he says now
[20:13] this is the thing I want us to catch
[20:16] this is this is this is just this next
[20:19] part I'm about to read it's kind of the
[20:21] meat of my thought tonight listen he
[20:23] says now if you ever notice how that

[21:01] Hallelujah the end of something
[21:04] a lot of times when you look through the
[21:07] courses of God and how God does things
[21:09] he uses disaster Hallelujah to bring
[21:12] forth New Life
[21:14] amen remember the story of Ruth her
[21:16] husband dies her father-in-law dies her

[21:48] can be begin to come forward out of her
[21:51] amen being born Hallelujah through an
[21:54] illegitimate Hallelujah bloodline it
[21:56] looked like it was such a disaster but
[21:58] God was going to use all of that to make
[22:01] the Lord Jesus Christ come out of that
[22:03] lineage

[22:43] behind it amen but her she did she she
[22:46] was she was doing what she had to do in
[22:48] that moment earlier but then in her
[22:51] heart see that's the thing you got to
[22:52] realize Satan doesn't know what's in
[22:54] your heart
[22:55] that's why he studies your life
[22:57] Hallelujah that's why Google as soon as
[23:00] you talk about something it'll pick it
[23:02] up and Flash it on your computer
[23:04] it'll pick it up and Flash it on your
[23:06] phone they make me sick with that

[23:26] find you out but then church when you
[23:29] think about it amen you think about this
[23:31] hardly This Disaster this disastrous
[23:33] life Rahab was living Hallelujah but one
[23:36] day the desire in her heart came right
[23:38] in front of her face
[23:40] Hallelujah in the form of some spies
[23:43] Hallelujah coming down to take over the
[23:45] land Rahab got inspired and she said you
[23:48] know what hey look at here I take this
[23:50] bet y'all come on in my house
[23:53] y'all come on in my house I'll protect
[23:56] y'all y'all come on in here I'll take
[23:58] this bet hallelujah amen and she didn't
[24:01] know them from Adam she didn't know them
[24:03] for anybody but she bet her whole life
[24:05] that these men were men of God
[24:08] Hallelujah I hope you're betting
[24:10] hallelujah oh Jesus Christ tonight
[24:13] churches she said amen so they talking
[24:15] they did all the stuff Rahab said hey I
[24:18] want you guys to give me a token what
[24:20] does a prostitute know about a token
[24:24] see adversity begins to bring out the
[24:27] real you
[24:30] same thing with the woman at the well
[24:31] she's talking to Jesus and the more
[24:34] Jesus talked the more Revelation came
[24:36] out of her
[24:38] when everybody else thought she was just
[24:39] a prostitute
[24:44] oh my
[24:45] but George as we can see
[24:48] listen man he said when disaster struck
[24:50] Jones house and the children was all
[24:52] killed and and everything and John and
[24:56] all job had was destroyed God wasn't
[25:00] rebuking job he was only purging job and
[25:04] then the prophet of God says amen
[25:07] he wasn't rebuking job he was only
[25:10] purging job
[25:12] oh my he was only purging job amen I
[25:16] like that word Purge and then he goes on
[25:19] to say he says the branch that bears
[25:21] fruit then God purges it that it will
[25:24] bring forth more fruit okay well let's
[25:26] look at that there's nothing wrong with
[25:28] the with the with the life of the tree
[25:30] God just want more fruit
[25:33] holy so what does he do he purges it
[25:35] amen and the scripture says if we're not
[25:38] bringing for fruit Hallelujah he cut it
[25:41] away amen but even when you're bringing
[25:43] for fruit even when you're praying even
[25:45] when you're playing you're paying your
[25:47] tithes you're coming to church faithful
[25:49] you got to pray a life God's saying I'm
[25:51] gonna Purge you that you breathe for
[25:53] more fruit
[25:54] [Applause]
[25:58] oh
[26:00] he was like oh God what did I do nothing
[26:04] he doesn't want more from you because he
[26:06] knows there's more fruit in that tree
[26:08] and then the scripture says you shall
[26:11] know them by what their fruit
[26:16] so until we get out of here you're going
[26:19] to have to produce fruit and for those
[26:21] of you who are just laid back saying I'm
[26:23] in the message I mean I'm out here where
[26:26] the Prophet this was the last place he
[26:27] was I in Arizona praise God
[26:32] no God want more than that
[26:35] there's more fruit to be given of God
[26:37] and when you speak of fruit you speak of
[26:40] life
[26:41] Hallelujah God wants more substance out
[26:43] of all of us he said but look how's he
[26:46] going to get it he said he'll Purge you
[26:49] when you purging something that means
[26:52] that there's things down in it that's no
[26:55] good
[26:57] oh
[26:59] oh boy we into it now
[27:04] please don't turn the Bloodhound loose
[27:06] up in here tonight
[27:08] but church he says even when you say he
[27:10] was a rebuking job he was only purging
[27:13] job
[27:13] and you know Hallelujah a tree can live
[27:16] Hallelujah but it has to come to a point
[27:19] where that tree has to be pruned
[27:23] there's nothing wrong with the life of
[27:25] the tree
[27:26] it's just certain situations have
[27:28] happened within the growth of that tree
[27:29] to where that tree certain Bridges have
[27:32] gotten stagnated or maybe there's a
[27:34] branch that's blocking other branches
[27:36] from getting sunlight so now Hallelujah
[27:39] something has to be cut off
[27:41] and you know Hallelujah normally when
[27:44] the tree holy has to be purged it has to
[27:47] be somebody that comes in and knows how
[27:49] to prune
[27:50] I want to show you a video about pruning
[27:53] let's go bro John
[27:55] praise God
[27:57] now it's the thing about pruning soon
[28:00] it's called a three-step message
[28:04] you don't just go ahead and start
[28:06] cutting the tree in the wrong way
[28:08] there's some steps to it keep going
[28:18] [Music]
[28:20] just the wrong way if you make a single
[28:23] cut from the top of the branch Watch
[28:25] What Happens okay stop stop it most of
[28:28] us we think with things gone in a church
[28:32] or things happen in our life let's go
[28:34] right to the source why don't the
[28:36] passengers pre-sold it and cut it all
[28:38] out
[28:42] I know he know what's going on why he
[28:45] just won't stop it
[28:47] no that's a correct method
[28:50] Hallelujah you can't all the time just
[28:53] go straight to it in a congregation and
[28:56] wipe it out
[28:57] now that's the way I love to do it
[29:00] and that's why I'm not a pastor
[29:04] Hallelujah but you know what church
[29:06] Hallelujah there's a correct method the
[29:09] thing about this method is if you go
[29:11] straight to the Hallelujah the branch
[29:13] where the branch is splitting in in the
[29:16] weight of the tree if you cut it right
[29:18] there the weight of that bridge is going
[29:21] to rip the tree keep going
[29:23] stop
[29:25] [Music]
[29:31] now the weight
[29:33] of that Branch being cut right there
[29:35] actually wounds the tree
[29:39] and those are those reasons why when you
[29:42] see things happen in the church the
[29:44] pastor take his time
[29:48] and we'd be like oh my God Pastor please
[29:51] just come on rebuke him
[29:53] oh
[29:55] you know it ain't nothing but the devil
[29:57] rebuke him straight we all can see it
[29:59] rebuke them
[30:05] he's a shepherd
[30:08] see his whole job is to take care of the
[30:10] sickness
[30:11] without killing the tree
[30:15] me on the other end
[30:19] I'd be like well I just do all that
[30:21] let's just chop the whole tree down
[30:23] chop it down get one of those salt
[30:25] eating things and push all
[30:27] all of them be sawdust by the time I'm
[30:30] finished you wouldn't even know a tree
[30:32] was there
[30:34] again that's why I'm not a pastor
[30:39] Hallelujah let's go
[30:41] very difficult for this tree to heal
[30:43] properly okay stop
[30:46] he said that way of cutting the tree
[30:48] makes it very difficult to heal you just
[30:51] hold that religion let's understand the
[30:54] purpose of pruning pruning what is it
[30:56] for pruning can remove any portion that
[31:00] have a disease or fungi or other types
[31:03] of Decay stopping it from spreading
[31:06] Hallelujah till healthier branches
[31:09] so that's why you prune a tree that's
[31:12] why you prune a church because these can
[31:15] happen in the church that it'll cause
[31:17] the spread that's why the pastor come on
[31:20] a five-fold Ministry of come and hit
[31:22] things directly in your life trying to
[31:24] clean you up and get you healthy
[31:29] but what we do normally when your
[31:30] clothes are getting stepped on you're
[31:31] like I wonder who that's for
[31:34] eign
[31:38] I hear it but I want to do that for
[31:42] Toad's getting all stepped on
[31:47] but pruning is there
[31:50] so that the tree can continue to live
[31:54] but the way to get it healthy is to cut
[31:56] on it
[31:57] Hallelujah but there has to be it has to
[32:00] be done in the correct manner earlier
[32:02] rebukes and chastisements can't always
[32:05] come from the Deacons
[32:09] you know how you do get upset first
[32:11] thing you do you turn into a snitch
[32:14] y'all know what a snitch is right
[32:16] go run further run to the D man sit
[32:19] there was so her kids be the nurse
[32:21] should be doing this doing that they be
[32:23] messing with everything
[32:25] oh snitch
[32:29] what about what your kids be doing
[32:32] they probably be locking the Stalls in
[32:33] the bathroom then call up under and
[32:35] leave the door lock
[32:46] oh my let's go right way to prune a tree
[32:49] is called the three cut methods simple
[32:52] as one two three three is what one about
[32:55] a foot away okay trunk I'll make an
[32:58] undercut on the bottom of the limb okay
[33:00] stop right there only go about a third
[33:03] the first cut
[33:04] is not a cut on top it's the cut
[33:06] underneath
[33:08] and usually when the word comes and and
[33:10] he's dealing with people's hearts and
[33:12] things like that it's cause that nobody
[33:15] else can see
[33:17] there are things that God will address
[33:19] in your life that nobody else knows
[33:21] about there's things that the pastor
[33:24] will come and preach on that nobody else
[33:26] knows about you're going through why
[33:28] because he's trying to get the tree
[33:30] healthy
[33:31] amen everything doesn't have to be done
[33:34] in front of everybody that's why we
[33:36] thank God for a Divine interpretation
[33:39] through a Vindicated Prophet Hallelujah
[33:41] when we would not Hallelujah
[33:43] denomination take scriptures where
[33:45] people come and say confess your faults
[33:48] before everybody
[33:51] what good is it gonna do you if I come
[33:53] up and tell the whole church oh man I
[33:56] got a problem with eating too much
[33:57] chocolate cake
[34:02] they ain't gonna help you none that's
[34:03] just gonna make you know not to invite
[34:04] me when you cook chocolate cake
[34:10] see sometimes we look for things to
[34:12] happen and it's not the right way it's
[34:13] supposed to be done in secret
[34:15] Hallelujah and God deals with hearts in
[34:19] secret however you may see somebody look
[34:22] like they struggling look like they're
[34:23] doing things wrong but God is cutting it
[34:26] secretly holy God is dealing with that
[34:29] heart secretly I know a sister in Canada
[34:31] Hallelujah see I came out of
[34:33] denomination she started going to a
[34:35] message church and she loved it
[34:37] Hallelujah which which she didn't know
[34:39] uh uh the precepts of Holiness and all
[34:42] these things so she came with what she
[34:44] got on and everything was tight
[34:46] I mean skin tight
[34:48] you know type but she was coming and
[34:50] enjoying the word and one day his
[34:53] brother got a brother got uh anointed he
[34:56] went up to the sister he told he said
[34:58] hey look here I can't I can't get none
[35:00] of the word because your clothes are too
[35:02] tight
[35:04] black huh
[35:08] that affected her so much
[35:11] did she quit Church went back to her
[35:14] denomination
[35:17] but while she was in the denomination
[35:19] she just realized it wasn't the same
[35:23] see God had made a contact Hallelujah
[35:26] God was dealing with a heart Hallelujah
[35:28] inside out but this brother Hallelujah
[35:31] who rebuked her she wasn't the problem
[35:34] it wasn't her clothes or clothes wasn't
[35:36] the problem the problem was he had a
[35:39] lost demon on him
[35:44] so the next time you think about
[35:46] rebuking Somebody by how they dress make
[35:49] sure it ain't you the problem
[35:52] Hallelujah
[35:56] did that be the first thing Steph
[35:57] righteous people do
[35:59] they see somebody else Falls and they
[36:01] just want to blast it
[36:02] I'm spiritual I got the Holy Ghost you
[36:05] know them kind of people always talking
[36:06] about I got the Holy Ghost I got perfect
[36:08] love normally they don't have it
[36:12] because when you got something you ain't
[36:14] got to tell everybody about it
[36:15] how many times don't we believe that the
[36:18] prophet was operating in perfect faith
[36:20] and in perfect love how many times you
[36:23] hear him preach I got it
[36:26] oh my how many times you heard Jesus say
[36:30] I got it
[36:31] no it just was demonstrated
[36:34] Hallelujah and you know this sister she
[36:37] she left and she came back and you know
[36:39] the pastor wondered what happened so she
[36:41] came into office and started confessing
[36:43] to the Past she said look Pastor you
[36:44] know this is all I got I just come to
[36:46] church with whatever I got you know I
[36:48] ain't got much money she said I love the
[36:50] word here but brother so-and-so say I'm
[36:52] a distraction and the Pastor said he did
[36:54] what
[36:57] and I thank God for pastors like this
[37:00] amen he went and got that brother he
[37:02] laid into him so good I mean laid into
[37:05] him like he was a a linebacker chasing a
[37:08] quarterback
[37:10] I mean he laid into him real good and
[37:12] told him don't you ever mess with
[37:14] somebody in this church again when they
[37:17] trying to serve God with all with the
[37:19] best of their heart with the right
[37:20] intentions
[37:22] and then the pastor Hallelujah gave his
[37:24] wife some money and told us hey you're
[37:26] going to take the sister shopping and
[37:28] that's the last time they ever had to
[37:30] deal with that
[37:32] Hallelujah and now she's Hallelujah
[37:34] redeemed of the Lord serving God Married
[37:37] with Children in this message and living
[37:39] her life
[37:42] the bus cover it could just be God
[37:45] pruning the tree Hallelujah sometimes
[37:48] God has showed me amen I remember amen
[37:51] as my daughter uh began to court my
[37:54] son-in-law and I didn't know anything
[37:55] about him I was gonna act the fool
[38:00] not finto I was
[38:03] oh
[38:04] my son-in-law told me years later he
[38:07] said look I always wanted to meet you he
[38:09] said but your daughter wouldn't let me
[38:11] I was like jazz why not she say Daddy
[38:13] cause you was acting crazy
[38:18] and my craziness was I know what this
[38:21] message is what it's supposed to produce
[38:23] and this young man ain't it and I ain't
[38:25] standing for it
[38:27] we don't know who bride is
[38:30] Hallelujah and the greatest the greatest
[38:33] thing God taught me when you dedicate
[38:35] your child to the Lord the rest of it
[38:38] belongs to God
[38:39] Hallelujah normally we mess things up as
[38:43] parents cause we get in the way
[38:47] so what God did my daughter's about 20
[38:49] 20 about 20 then guard gamer started
[38:52] talking to me he said look here
[38:55] and I'm and I'm giving I'm giving some
[38:57] of you food for thought
[39:00] Hallelujah because some of us message
[39:03] Believers We've ran our children away
[39:06] because of our standards in the message
[39:09] much of nonsense
[39:12] your standard is your life
[39:15] not your law
[39:17] Hallelujah look and you know God begins
[39:20] to come to me he says look here look
[39:22] here let me tell you something
[39:24] he said there was only one John the
[39:25] Baptist
[39:26] and it wasn't you
[39:31] because you know when you get saved you
[39:33] see everything that's wrong nobody can
[39:35] match up nobody's good enough for your
[39:37] daughter another means she would have
[39:38] never got married she'll still be single
[39:42] but then church God comes to me he says
[39:44] look here let me tell you something he
[39:45] said she's above age she don't need your
[39:48] permission
[39:49] she can go get married have children and
[39:52] you not be a part of none of it because
[39:54] of your standing
[39:58] now you can say what you want but if you
[40:01] love your children you want to be a part
[40:03] of their life
[40:05] no matter what lifestyle they may have
[40:08] and you know when God told me that he
[40:10] was like you gonna mess up everything
[40:12] he's like look here I'm gonna give you a
[40:14] Ministry Hallelujah a Ministry
[40:17] Hallelujah that can shake the world a
[40:20] new ministry that can shake the world
[40:22] Hallelujah and this ministry is powerful
[40:25] and I was like yes Lord give it to me
[40:27] yes Lord I say Lord I want it please
[40:30] give it to me and God said okay this new
[40:33] ministry I'm giving you is called the
[40:35] shut your mouth Ministry
[40:41] and that's the hardest thing for a daddy
[40:44] to do
[40:46] just shut your mouth and let it play out
[40:49] cause God began to recite to me all the
[40:52] truths she's grown she don't need your
[40:54] permission and she can do whatever she
[40:56] wants
[40:57] and I was like Lord you're right he said
[40:59] now would you rather her do that or you
[41:03] befriend the situation and then you can
[41:05] guide her through it
[41:07] I say the second part Lord
[41:10] I think I want to do the second part so
[41:12] you know what I begin to say okay you
[41:14] know Jazz this and that and everything
[41:16] blah blah you know I I was acting more
[41:18] of a friend than a dad
[41:20] and as I acted as a friend she put me in
[41:23] position as a dad
[41:26] then she started to ask me what do I
[41:28] think about my son-in-law now
[41:31] ask me what I begin to think about then
[41:33] I could give my input and nobody would
[41:35] be hurt
[41:36] Hallelujah and as I begin my input you
[41:40] know different things start to fall in
[41:41] place and they begin to get closer and
[41:43] closer and I shut my mouth and then it
[41:45] got to the place where my son-in-law
[41:47] comes to me Church what I'm saying is I
[41:50] was being purged
[41:54] Hallelujah I was being purged because I
[41:58] didn't want to let go I wanted to force
[42:00] my opinion I'm the head of this house
[42:02] and you gonna do what we gonna stand for
[42:04] this message
[42:06] and God said shut your mouth be quiet
[42:10] and let me take care
[42:12] my son-in-law comes to me he says Hey I
[42:14] want to meet with you let's get together
[42:16] let's talk
[42:17] that's what we got together and we sat
[42:18] in the car we talking he said hey you
[42:20] know what I want to marry your daughter
[42:21] I like man please
[42:24] like man please ain't gonna happen
[42:26] I don't say now how long y'all about
[42:29] three years I said in three years this
[42:31] person you want to spend the rest of
[42:32] your life with he looked me in my face
[42:33] and say yes sir
[42:36] oh like whoa
[42:39] no experience with the message
[42:42] no experience with the prophet any of
[42:45] that he grew up a Baptist
[42:47] so y'all know I got my gun cocked
[42:50] you ain't getting my daughter
[42:52] now you talking and then he said this to
[42:54] me he said look I want to marry her he
[42:57] said but
[42:58] I ain't gonna do nothing unless I got
[43:00] your blessing
[43:02] I was like putting it was all like oh
[43:06] right
[43:16] what was it was God showing me I got it
[43:20] under control
[43:21] so me and him had a talking then I began
[43:24] to tell him what I see and I said he
[43:26] said we always we always hear about
[43:28] wanting the father's blessing he said
[43:30] but we don't even know what it is can

[43:33] so then I begin to tell him what I
[43:35] expect out of a son-in-law in church
[43:38] holy God is my witness that boy has
[43:40] stepped up to the plate and become
[43:42] everything that I could have wanted for
[43:44] my daughter

[43:52] after I preached at church he called me
[43:55] and he said hey uh can you do me a favor
[43:57] I say what how can I get a hold of all
[43:59] brother random messages I said
[44:03] I said we got him we got what oh god
[44:07] you're good
[44:10] greatest Ministry
[44:13] shut your mouth Ministry
[44:16] so that was God pruning my tree
[44:21] helping me to take my hands off of it
[44:24] say God say I got it
[44:27] that's what maybe somebody in here need
[44:28] to do tonight
[44:30] you're worried about your children are
[44:31] you worried about certain things just
[44:33] take your hands off of it
[44:35] Jesus the prophet God say the greatest
[44:37] weapon we got Holier is a confession and
[44:39] a communal Hallelujah you confess to God
[44:42] what you want what you expect of him
[44:44] what you need of him Hallelujah and then
[44:46] you commit it to the Lord take your
[44:48] hands off of it and it's over
[44:50] go on serving God believing he's going
[44:53] to take care of it Hallelujah now it may
[44:56] not happen Church look at here
[44:57] hallelujah
[44:59] the only right you got to complain I'm
[45:01] going to tell you I'm gonna tell you
[45:02] when you can complain
[45:03] according to the scripture you can only
[45:06] complain when it's 26 years later
[45:11] I guess that did you
[45:14] because it took Abraham 25.
[45:19] it was after the year 26 and God ain't
[45:22] answered the prayer again whatever then
[45:25] you can complain
[45:27] but if it's 20 years you just got to
[45:31] just be quiet
[45:32] you got to still go to God say Lord help
[45:34] me Father God I know I'm being pruned
[45:37] how do you get the sickness out my tree
[45:39] okay let's go keep going
[45:41] this is the undercut this is the first
[45:43] cut this is the second cut an inch or
[45:46] two further out than the first cup okay
[45:48] stop did you hear what he said he said
[45:51] now that cut was a little bit closer now
[45:54] he's going to go further out Hallelujah
[45:56] and see you think about the church why
[45:58] would God go through all these things
[46:00] Hallelujah to make sure when he deal
[46:03] with the problem it never reoccurs again
[46:07] hallelujah what we will say oh God just
[46:11] chop the whole thing off he said no
[46:13] if I hear you it's going to be
[46:15] Hallelujah until you make it to the
[46:18] other side
[46:19] it ain't gonna be no wrestling with real
[46:22] current Spirits or remissions of cancer
[46:25] and all that remission hey please
[46:28] how many times did Jesus die on the
[46:30] cross
[46:34] cancer don't have a right to come back
[46:38] he dealt with every sickness every
[46:40] disease every attribute of sin once and
[46:44] one time only
[46:46] Hallelujah and it wasn't a a remission
[46:49] of calvary
[46:51] where he had to go back through it all
[46:53] over again no once he did it it was done
[46:57] Hallelujah so that cut right there
[47:00] Hallelujah that cut goes out a little
[47:03] bit further but let's watch it
[47:05] that is made from the top down
[47:08] I'll keep sorry until that Branch breaks
[47:11] free oh it broke free perfect but look
[47:16] you see the undercut Hallelujah stop the
[47:20] whole tree from being damaged
[47:22] it's the thing that happened that nobody
[47:25] else saw stopped the tree from being
[47:27] damaged Hallelujah and it's the things
[47:30] that God do for you in your own private
[47:33] time Hallelujah that strength is your
[47:36] tree
[47:38] amen that makes your tree grow and
[47:41] produce Hallelujah and let it shed light
[47:44] in other areas of your life
[47:47] let's keep going
[47:49] without ripping the back
[47:51] three the last cut the branch removed I
[47:55] can make my final cut the Final Cut
[47:58] you see what he's doing this area of the
[48:01] branch is a little thicker than the rest
[48:02] it's called the branch column it's very
[48:05] important that I don't cut into that so
[48:07] that the tree will heal properly okay
[48:09] stop
[48:11] now he can deal with the total branch
[48:14] but it's being cut in a way
[48:17] to when he's finished dealing with that
[48:19] whole Branch pulling that whole Branch
[48:22] the whole tree will heal back easily
[48:26] because the steps of it were done
[48:28] according to God's will
[48:31] so when God pruning Hallelujah pruning
[48:33] the tree and doing what he does all he's
[48:36] trying to do amen is show us that we're
[48:39] more than conquerors
[48:41] Hallelujah through Christ that
[48:43] strengthens me amen you can take that
[48:45] down brother John amen but your church
[48:49] when the pruning is complete why does it
[48:52] pruning happens he says amen that when a
[48:56] tree is pruning you have to cut certain
[48:58] things off now that bridge had to be cut
[49:00] why because that Branch Hallelujah was
[49:04] taken from another branch that needed
[49:06] what it had
[49:10] and a lot of times
[49:12] God will bring up things in your life
[49:15] just to clean you off
[49:17] because there's another place he's
[49:19] trying to take you
[49:22] and there are things within us
[49:24] that you don't even know is there until
[49:26] God begins to prune the tree
[49:29] and I'm going to shock you
[49:31] with the Holy Ghost
[49:34] while you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:37] he'll go through a pruning
[49:41] everybody the Holy Ghost take care of
[49:43] all that
[49:46] how many believe the prophet has the
[49:47] Holy Ghost
[49:49] you know he also had a lion spirit
[49:51] inside
[49:54] Hallelujah he had to be pruned how did
[49:58] God prune him through his tax situation
[50:03] look he had no explanation why it was
[50:05] happening he did everything right he put
[50:07] the money in the right places he sent it
[50:10] to the right places he put it all back
[50:12] in the church and all these things but
[50:13] he still had a tax debt and the tax
[50:16] people coming after him when he was
[50:18] doing everything right there was no
[50:20] explanation and you know what God
[50:22] wouldn't take it away
[50:25] God let the pressure come and the
[50:27] pressure come and the pressure come what
[50:29] was he doing he was raising up that lie
[50:34] he was raising up that lie he knew that
[50:36] the prophet was going to tell so he let
[50:38] the pressure come and the pressure come
[50:40] and the pressure come to that day and
[50:42] you know the prophet had different
[50:43] phones
[50:45] but the tax collectors had them all
[50:52] me to say oh bill it's that tax
[50:55] collector
[50:56] tell them I'm not in here
[51:00] what was he doing he was pruning our
[51:02] prophet
[51:06] pruning him in such a way till he could
[51:08] self-reflect
[51:10] Hallelujah and now he's self-reflecting
[51:13] Hallelujah and he walks outside and he
[51:16] goes to do what we've always done he's a
[51:18] man filled with the Holy Ghost
[51:20] amen having meetings and healing people
[51:22] and all these things amen you can be
[51:24] pruned Hallelujah and be used of God
[51:28] but look what God did to him he goes to
[51:31] pray and then hey God said get your
[51:33] hands off that child you're not fit to
[51:35] pray for you just told a lie
[51:40] now a real man of God real woman of God
[51:43] when God exposes your sickness
[51:47] your disease and your tree
[51:50] he's trying to prune you
[51:52] you don't point it off on somebody else
[51:56] amen they bother
[52:00] you ain't blame me that he ain't blame
[52:02] nobody
[52:03] he went back
[52:05] went to the very man he lied to
[52:09] he said look when you called the last
[52:10] time
[52:11] he said I was in the house and I'm sorry
[52:13] I lied to y'all know how the story but
[52:15] I'm paraphrasing he said I'm sorry I
[52:17] lied to you
[52:18] he said you know what Mr Brandon I've
[52:21] always had respect for you
[52:23] but now I have even more respect
[52:26] Hallelujah and if you do things right
[52:29] you will call somebody else tree to grow
[52:34] now this lawyer he always had respect
[52:37] for brother Branham Hallelujah but when
[52:39] he came back Hurley and told the truth
[52:41] even when this loyalist tax man didn't
[52:43] even know that he lied when he came back
[52:45] and told him that amen that gave him
[52:48] even more confidence in his ministry
[52:53] sure
[52:54] God will rise it up Hallelujah in church
[52:58] as we see he did the same thing you look
[53:01] at job's life I'm gonna be on this
[53:02] longer y'all know I'm about to close
[53:05] you look at Joe's life as job went
[53:07] through the trial what came out more and
[53:10] more revelation
[53:14] what I love about it from the beginning
[53:16] job goes through it and he's being
[53:18] pruned job doesn't complain job says
[53:21] blessed be the name of the Lord
[53:24] when was the last time something
[53:26] happened to your car something happened
[53:28] in your family and you had no answer for
[53:30] it but you lift your hands and you said
[53:32] blessed be the name of the Lord
[53:36] that's what he wants
[53:38] and I must admit it took me a while to
[53:40] get there
[53:42] but by God's grace now I don't even try
[53:44] to look for new explanation I just say
[53:46] Lord thank you I don't know what you're
[53:47] doing but help me to look at it right
[53:50] and it's so crazy church because the way
[53:53] that I if if you can look into my life
[53:55] for a second let me be transparent you
[53:57] know God Amen this is a walk of faith
[54:00] for me and you know uh uh uh uh I live
[54:03] by the gospel everything is by the
[54:05] gospel and you know the enemy always
[54:07] fights me with my finances I have
[54:09] everything together get things paid off
[54:11] the next thing you know a bill comes out
[54:13] of nowhere
[54:14] I'm like what where did this come from
[54:18] oh I pay my tots
[54:22] like what
[54:24] you know I know and I just don't have no
[54:27] explanation for
[54:29] but what I can't rely on I said God I
[54:31] didn't pay my time that's your problem
[54:35] and then uh God anoint somebody or
[54:38] anoint a situation next thing you know
[54:40] something comes my way in and it's all
[54:42] taken care of and I'm like praise God
[54:45] hallelujah and you know Satan is such a
[54:47] liar and God was showing me this today
[54:49] normally the areas you're fighting in
[54:53] God is showing you that the accusations
[54:55] the devil is bringing against you you're
[54:58] really the opposite of
[55:01] because he can create so what he does is
[55:03] present a lie to you
[55:06] Hallelujah so what God was saying to me
[55:09] today while I was thinking over this
[55:10] amen that he fights me in my finances
[55:13] because he don't want me to really
[55:14] believe that I'm rich
[55:17] whoa
[55:19] hallelujah oh hey Hallelujah
[55:24] Hallelujah
[55:29] now you can believe what you want
[55:31] holy but the opposite of broke is rich
[55:37] and Satan come say you're broke you're
[55:39] broke you broke you're broke
[55:40] and we're like
[55:42] yeah that what you think
[55:45] you ain't gonna get me to get that to
[55:46] come out my mouth
[55:48] like no I'm blessed in the Lord
[55:50] and if I ain't got it God I'll send it
[55:52] to me God will create it if he can
[55:55] create Rams Hallelujah if he can create
[55:58] all these others I'm sure he can create
[56:00] a Benjamin Franklin
[56:04] Hallelujah 10 of them
[56:09] Hallelujah Church before I go forward
[56:12] let's narrow this down real quick
[56:14] everybody all right
[56:15] now we know Hallelujah Satan cannot
[56:18] create
[56:19] amen God is the only creator
[56:22] now I'm going to challenge you so is sin
[56:26] really real
[56:31] if he can't create where it come from
[56:36] because from the acceptance of your mind
[56:40] because sin is only what unbelief
[56:43] Castle's not real
[56:45] [Music]
[56:47] because it's not a creation it's a
[56:49] perversion of your health
[56:51] depression is not real
[56:53] because it's not a creation amen it's a
[56:57] perversion of your joy
[56:59] Hallelujah church that's how we got to
[57:02] look at these things amen doubt is not
[57:04] real it's a perversion of your faith
[57:07] hate is not real it's a perversion of
[57:10] Your Love
[57:11] amen the attributes of sin are not a
[57:14] creation they're only a perversion so
[57:17] they don't exist in a god-feel mind
[57:23] so you guys what the Bible says listen
[57:25] good the Bible says casting down
[57:28] imagination
[57:31] now that but I was strong we're there
[57:33] now I hope you all got your gloves out
[57:36] I'm strong because Satan but he'll come
[57:38] and say all right brother you know the
[57:40] last time you went to the doctor you got

[1:03:42] different things and that and he said
[1:03:43] well Mr D how about next time before you
[1:03:46] go to the doctor whatever don't take no
[1:03:48] pre-workout whatever tomato tomato
[1:03:50] potato potato
[1:03:54] yeah
[1:03:56] I had to go through all that let me read
[1:03:58] you something
[1:04:06] listen
[1:04:08] this is what the prophet of God said
[1:04:10] this is powerful
[1:04:12] oh my
[1:04:14] he said
[1:04:15] if he had ten thousand cattle
[1:04:18] he give him twenty thousand cattle see
[1:04:21] oh
[1:04:22] isn't that marvelous
[1:04:26] God purged job for the purpose to bless
[1:04:30] him
[1:04:33] that'll make everybody smile
[1:04:36] God pershes you allows you to go through
[1:04:39] Temptations and trials and all these
[1:04:41] things just for the purpose of blessing
[1:04:46] so for those of you who drive trucks and
[1:04:48] you know about the D.O.T physical the
[1:04:49] physical physical is supposed to go
[1:04:51] every two years if you're driving
[1:04:53] so I've come I was coming back and me
[1:04:56] and the doctor talking he's sounding my
[1:04:57] purple work supposed to be two years all
[1:04:59] these things so he feels everything out
[1:05:01] he said well Mr D we certainly
[1:05:03] appreciate you you have a good time that
[1:05:05] was February 2022.
[1:05:08] of this year February 2022
[1:05:11] so two years from now I have to go back
[1:05:13] and do it again because my paperwork
[1:05:16] should say February 20
[1:05:20] 24.
[1:05:22] that's two years right
[1:05:24] so I look at my expiration date on my
[1:05:27] paperwork
[1:05:28] it didn't say February 2024.
[1:05:33] it said February 2032.
[1:05:41] I'll never be able to get tested again
[1:05:44] to the Rapture comes
[1:05:48] um what is the little adversity
[1:05:50] Hallelujah when God already has a
[1:05:52] blessing on the back end
[1:05:54] God just wants to go through it and be
[1:05:56] happy and smiling giving him thanks and
[1:05:59] giving him praise and not receiving the
[1:06:01] lies of the devil while you're being
[1:06:03] purged
[1:06:05] because he has a blessing in the end of
[1:06:07] it
[1:06:08] God has sent you through the purging
[1:06:10] only for the reason to bless you
[1:06:14] and at the end of it job was blessed
[1:06:18] beyond measure as musicians come
[1:06:25] Church in so many different ways
[1:06:29] we've seen God do a purging
[1:06:32] through the scriptures
[1:06:34] and you may not have an answer for it
[1:06:37] to the end of it
[1:06:40] things can arise and you'll be like Lord
[1:06:41] why am I going through this
[1:06:43] if we just take uh Joseph
[1:06:46] went through hatred and envy and
[1:06:49] jealousy in his own family
[1:06:51] they sold them into a sold them into
[1:06:54] slavery
[1:06:56] all because he was loved of his father
[1:06:58] all because he had gifts in his life and
[1:07:01] he loved his brothers he never did
[1:07:03] anything wrong to him but God was doing
[1:07:05] all that just to get him in position
[1:07:08] Hallelujah but one thing about his life
[1:07:10] Joseph it kept working
[1:07:13] because he was going through he didn't
[1:07:14] become a cold starchy stale Christian no
[1:07:17] he was still interpreting dreams his
[1:07:20] life was still shining wherever he went
[1:07:22] he gets in part of his house part of his
[1:07:24] wife lies on him now he's thrown in jail
[1:07:27] he meets the butler the baker they
[1:07:29] forget all about him
[1:07:31] but all of that was a process
[1:07:35] because what was God doing God was
[1:07:37] making like I said the other night God
[1:07:39] was making him fit to rule
[1:07:41] Hallelujah
[1:07:43] so Church days are purging there's a
[1:07:45] pruning of our trees oh God wanted more
[1:07:48] fruit
[1:07:50] now if you examine your life examine
[1:07:52] where you are are you just a person
[1:07:55] who's just faithful enough to come to
[1:07:57] church
[1:07:58] you think that's all God wants out of
[1:08:00] you
[1:08:03] just a good church member
[1:08:05] if that's the case I don't know about
[1:08:07] you but I've met denominational people
[1:08:09] who've made me get on my knees
[1:08:14] because they have such a humility upon
[1:08:16] themselves
[1:08:17] made me feel like I wasn't even a
[1:08:19] Christian at times I used to work with a
[1:08:21] guy you know they they go ask him to do
[1:08:24] stuff and he'd be like okay
[1:08:26] they go ask me I'll be like I I got
[1:08:28] Authority
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:32] I'm the bride you know all this
[1:08:34] foolishness
[1:08:38] and I look at that man Elmo Johnson me
[1:08:40] and him still friends in this day I look
[1:08:42] at him and just Elm was a pentacle he
[1:08:43] just gonna do it no complaining no
[1:08:46] hugging no nothing
[1:08:48] he made me I'll be like
[1:08:50] kill my knees and pray cause all this
[1:08:53] Revelation I got what good is
[1:08:55] it it's not showing
[1:09:00] and that's what God wants God wants the
[1:09:03] life
[1:09:05] are you bearing fruit
[1:09:08] you shall know them by their fruit are
[1:09:11] you bearing fruit or are you just
[1:09:13] satisfied with coming to church
[1:09:15] amen sitting under a good Ministry and I
[1:09:18] ain't saying go make something happen
[1:09:19] but what am I saying are you yielded
[1:09:22] enough to know that God is directing you
[1:09:24] where he wants you to go
[1:09:27] what he needs for me
[1:09:29] amen are you in a place where you're
[1:09:32] self-reflecting where you're looking at
[1:09:34] your life as you go through things and
[1:09:35] you're like okay God
[1:09:39] and sometimes that's all God wants is a
[1:09:42] deeper concentration
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:44] because there are things that's supposed
[1:09:46] to be working in the church but it
[1:09:48] doesn't happen because we're not
[1:09:49] consecrated enough
[1:09:51] because we got our own lives we got our
[1:09:53] own jobs we got our own families and all
[1:09:55] these other things what about what God
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:00] let's think about that church
[1:10:04] because there's a bet
[1:10:07] that's going on right now
[1:10:09] between God and the devil but I want you
[1:10:13] to understand
[1:10:14] God's already confident about you
[1:10:18] are you confident about him
[1:10:21] because what God began to do with job we
[1:10:24] begin to show job that
[1:10:26] God is on his side
[1:10:28] and the more he went through the more
[1:10:30] praise Joe gave God
[1:10:33] Hallelujah
[1:10:35] all the way to the place that God had to
[1:10:37] restore him even with his message
[1:10:40] believing friends criticizing him with
[1:10:43] no evidence
[1:10:47] they were judging what they saw
[1:10:50] they had no evidence
[1:10:52] and I'll say this in closing if you see
[1:10:55] somebody going through something that
[1:10:57] don't mean sins in their life
[1:11:00] that just mean God want more fruit
[1:11:03] remember he was not rebuking Joe
[1:11:07] he was only Persian Joe
[1:11:09] [Music]
