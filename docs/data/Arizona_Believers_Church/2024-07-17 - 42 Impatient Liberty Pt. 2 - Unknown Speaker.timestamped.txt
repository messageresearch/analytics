[0:00] everybody if not every single person
[0:02] here this evening was with us on Sunday
[0:04] so we'll be able to just jump right into
[0:06] the subject this is part two on
[0:08] impatient Liberty and on this subject
[0:11] and use in this title what we're wanting
[0:13] to look at and examine is how that we
[0:16] can use Liberty as an excuse to act out
[0:20] of order to act out of the nature and
[0:22] the character of the word of God and we
[0:24] say that we're we're free and we're
[0:26] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[0:28] liberty so we kind of take that as a
[0:30] that we can do whatever we want since we
[0:31] have the Holy Spirit whatever we say
[0:33] whatever we do however we act the steps
[0:36] of the good man are ordered of the Lord
[0:38] and uh it must have been God's will
[0:39] because he allowed it to happen so
[0:41] there's a lot of things that we use to
[0:42] justify it and namely we are looking at
[0:45] the Simplicity that is in Christ we're
[0:48] looking at how that God wants to make us
[0:50] a home how we want our families to be
[0:52] homes we want our church to be a home
[0:55] and some of those dynamics that keep it
[0:56] from being so so Simplicity has been
[0:58] what I've been studying on and it's
[1:00] opened up these different channels I
[1:02] think we can make uh make some time to
[1:04] be very deliberate about applying this
[1:06] in a practical way to our home lives but
[1:09] using this Liberty that we have in
[1:11] Christ as a justification or the reason
[1:14] why we do certain things or manifest
[1:17] certain things and we saw when we went
[1:19] through the scriptures of the Temptation
[1:21] in the garden the Temptation in the
[1:22] wilderness and just in different various
[1:24] places how Satan wants us to act out of
[1:27] order or out of season we realize that
[1:30] God's word has to be in season and there
[1:32] can be things that we could um emphasize
[1:35] or stress or things that we could try to
[1:36] make very very important or this is what
[1:39] the word is this is what the message is
[1:40] and it'd be out of season if we were
[1:43] trying to manifest the Millennium now on
[1:46] Earth and we were wanting to uh make
[1:48] certain things come to pass or Express
[1:50] certain things uh it that God is going
[1:52] to rule and reign in a bodily form in
[1:54] his son and in his bride on Earth for a
[1:56] thousand years but to try to enforce
[1:59] that now to act that out now in in a
[2:02] literal fulfillment of those things
[2:03] would be out of season though it's
[2:04] according to his word and in the same
[2:07] way we can try to manifest and express
[2:10] things that are of another age manifest
[2:12] certain things that were given in other
[2:14] ages as this is the age and this is the
[2:17] ultimate and it's with the word of God
[2:19] but it's not what it's not what Christ
[2:21] is stressing now it's not what the
[2:23] emphasis or the rhythm is
[2:26] now and there's uh a lot that we could
[2:29] say in that but he wants us to act out
[2:31] of season through impatience we get
[2:33] anxious we want things to be a certain
[2:35] way and so we we try to make it happen
[2:37] if we're impatient we have this feeling
[2:39] that we want something to happen or we
[2:41] want to possess something now want to
[2:43] happen as soon as possible and a lot of
[2:46] people if you're in if you work or
[2:48] you're in the service industry or you
[2:50] have an employer whenever they give us a
[2:53] job or a task that we need to do and we
[2:54] say when do you want it and they always
[2:56] say
[2:57] yesterday and that indicates some
[3:00] measure of impatience I want it I want
[3:01] it yesterday get it done as soon as
[3:03] possible and that's a a good way of
[3:06] looking at uh that restlessness that
[3:09] comes or this feeling I've got to have
[3:10] something now but that it's that
[3:11] Restless desire that's what's at the
[3:13] heart of impatience it's a Restless
[3:16] desire for excitement a Restless desire
[3:18] for Change and that lack of rest is
[3:22] maybe the most significant application
[3:25] or uh characteristic of this impatience
[3:28] you've you're not at peace you're not at
[3:30] rest things aren't quiet and since you
[3:32] lack patience and you're Restless you
[3:34] are you have this energy this desire to
[3:38] change your state and oh if this could
[3:40] just happen I'll feel plated if this is
[3:42] just happens I'll I I I'll be at rest
[3:45] and so there is this element of doubt
[3:47] that exists whenever we're impatient we
[3:49] don't trust God that he's going to do it
[3:51] so we we feel like oh oh oh I need to
[3:53] get I need this to happen and maybe what
[3:56] we do is we make the mistake of
[3:57] conflating desperation with impatience
[4:00] and and we cannot take this principle of
[4:03] desperation a and use it that W I'm just
[4:07] desperate I'm just desperate when in
[4:08] fact you're just
[4:09] impatient so Satan schemes to produce a
[4:12] Restless longing or that anxious desire
[4:15] we saw it in the woman he even was
[4:16] trying to provoke this in Jesus Christ
[4:18] we were walking through spoken word is
[4:20] the original seed I'd like to touch on a
[4:22] few more things in that sermon maybe
[4:24] tonight but just from a little bit
[4:25] different
[4:26] perspective but this is a a statement
[4:28] where he said what she what is she
[4:30] trying to do and he's really talking
[4:32] about the church Pentecostal Church the
[4:34] L Dey and church age those of Le Dey are
[4:37] characterized with this oh she
[4:38] manufactures a little jumping on the
[4:40] platform not making fun of it it's all
[4:43] right now there's manifestations of the
[4:46] spirit that are given to profit uh all
[4:48] there are gifts of the Spirit that God
[4:50] gives in measures and it works it's the
[4:52] same Spirit working in different
[4:53] individuals in different ways and
[4:55] there's ways that humans react to the
[4:58] stimulus of the spirit that's different
[5:00] some people weep some people silently
[5:02] bow their heads and cry others can be a
[5:04] little bit more um charismatic and I do
[5:07] think it's amazing sometimes if you just
[5:09] look at how the spirit manifest itself
[5:12] among certain people that it's just
[5:14] weird how sometimes it's almost
[5:17] geographical don't know how that works
[5:19] but so there but and there's nothing
[5:22] wrong with it brother Ram says it's all
[5:23] right but the issue is she's
[5:26] manufactures she manufactures something
[5:28] else why to to get members in the church
[5:30] so pride is at the heart of this I want
[5:33] to say this money women and popularity
[5:34] is at the heart of this lust of the
[5:36] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[5:38] of life are at the heart of this what's
[5:40] the matter she just can't wait so I'm
[5:42] just using this to summarize many things
[5:44] we read from the message of the hour and
[5:46] from the sermon about this impatience
[5:48] that was in the woman and this
[5:50] impatience to get things done she just
[5:52] can't wait she can't wait for God to do
[5:54] it they got to get members in there
[5:56] somewhere so they tell them you have to
[5:58] do that W in other words I mean what a
[6:01] ripe field for the Pentecostal church
[6:03] when the Methodist and the Baptists and
[6:05] everyone uh they're not manifesting
[6:07] these things so in order to get members
[6:09] in their Church they say well if your
[6:10] church isn't do doing this you need to
[6:12] leave your church it says you have to do
[6:15] that and away they go he said there's
[6:17] the seed coming right up you have to do
[6:20] it this isn't the Original Seed coming
[6:23] right up but this is that seed of
[6:24] impatience this is that seed of
[6:26] discrepancy it's even the seed of the
[6:28] false Vine which impersonating the True
[6:30] Vine and they turned something that
[6:32] would be um an expression of Faith or
[6:36] expression of Joy expression of
[6:38] enthusiasm from the heart of a Believer
[6:40] when the presence of God moves upon them
[6:42] they've turned it into a Hal to as a
[6:43] litus test as to whether or not God is
[6:45] moving and now it's become an Evidence
[6:47] of the Holy Ghost or an evidence that
[6:49] you're in the bride the evidence that
[6:50] you're right and then they say you have
[6:53] to do that and he said that's the wrong
[6:56] kind of
[6:58] seeden and in she can't wait that's what
[7:00] motivates people to do this I do believe
[7:03] that there is a Vindication that God is
[7:06] going to uh put upon the bride he will
[7:09] vindicate her he will avenge her
[7:11] speedily a and all we can do is call
[7:13] upon God for it and live the word of God
[7:16] and he will do the rest but when we try
[7:18] to vindicate ourselves or avenge
[7:20] ourselves or prove ourselves we we get
[7:22] into dangerous territory now in
[7:25] Revelation 3:1 on Sunday uh one of the
[7:28] brothers was actually quot quoting uh
[7:30] this to me or began to quote it and I
[7:32] finished it because it had been in my
[7:33] notes to use uh uh but in Revelations
[7:36] 3:1 he says because thou Hast kept the
[7:38] word of my patience I also will keep
[7:41] thee from the hour of
[7:43] Temptation which shall come upon all the
[7:45] world to try them that dwell upon the
[7:48] earth now remember how that the
[7:51] Temptation at the end brother B says
[7:53] watch when you get to the end where this
[7:55] temptation come and we know that he says
[7:58] that the bride will be Tried by the word
[8:01] and that this age is evil it is wicked
[8:03] it is Satan's Eden to prove that you are
[8:05] not like that woman and so you will have
[8:07] to be tested and tried or tempted with
[8:09] the whole word doesn't that seeming odd
[8:11] tempted with the word of God and so the
[8:14] word is going to be offered to us uh the
[8:17] word says to do this and in doing so we
[8:20] act and and we're tempting God and so
[8:23] there's a temptation to us and there's a
[8:25] temptation to God and so the Temptation
[8:27] in the end will be like it was in the
[8:29] garden with the woman and it'll be like
[8:31] it was in the wilderness with Christ and
[8:34] so there's going to be a Temptation that
[8:35] comes upon the whole world to try them
[8:38] and it says keeping the word of my
[8:40] patience causes us it gives us power in
[8:44] the hour of Temptation to be kept so
[8:48] what is it that keeps us kept in the
[8:49] hour of Temptation keeping the word of
[8:52] his patience now brother bradam writes
[8:55] this in the Philadelphian Church age he
[8:57] says what does he mean by the word of of
[8:59] his patience Hebrews 613 to15 for when
[9:03] God made promise to Abraham because he
[9:05] could swear by no greater he swear by
[9:07] himself saying surely blessing I Will
[9:09] Bless thee and multiplying I'll multiply
[9:11] thee and so after he had patiently
[9:14] endured he obtained the promise you see
[9:17] the spirit is speaking about the word of
[9:18] God which is given to us so the word of
[9:21] my patience is the word of God if Satan
[9:25] can make us impatient we can't be in the
[9:28] word of God right if he can make us
[9:30] impatient this Restless longing if we
[9:32] can see that the tree is to be desired
[9:34] to make one wise if he can just get our
[9:36] perceptions a little off get us acting
[9:37] in the flesh getting us wanting to do
[9:39] God a service without it being his will
[9:41] acting out of season not being the right
[9:43] man for the job he said then we cannot
[9:46] be in the spirit fulfilling the word of
[9:48] God the spirit is speaking about the
[9:50] word of God which is given to us to wait
[9:52] for the Fulfillment of that word
[9:54] required patience even as it did in the
[9:56] case of Abraham so there's where we
[9:59] mentioned it Sunday that the word it
[10:01] requires patience for the word of God to
[10:02] be fulfilled he endured is seen him who
[10:05] is invisible been studied on the the
[10:08] union of the visible and the invisible
[10:11] he was patient and then the word finally
[10:13] was fulfilled this is the way God
[10:15] teaches his PE people patience now uh
[10:18] really zero in on this and think as we
[10:21] talk about being impatient you think
[10:22] well what's wrong with a little
[10:23] impatience maybe they get the job done
[10:25] squeak squeaky will gets the grease and
[10:27] so there's this uh thought that maybe if
[10:29] if I can just get a little ansy and push
[10:31] the envelope a little bit maybe we'll
[10:32] make things happen but he says if he why
[10:36] this is the way God teaches his people
[10:39] patience why if he fulfilled his word in
[10:42] physical manifestations the very instant
[10:45] you prayed you would never learn
[10:47] patience but would become even more
[10:49] impatient with
[10:52] life I want to do the uh shocked face
[10:56] emoji the blow
[10:59] we should just maybe have a a keypad up
[11:02] here I could just punch it and just and
[11:04] emoticon just pops up the Unicorn the
[11:06] shock
[11:08] unicorn this is that's amazing that when
[11:12] we want to see something manifest if it
[11:15] happens what does it do it just creates
[11:17] more
[11:18] impatience because you see this law of
[11:20] diminishing returns this nasty cycle we
[11:23] get in if church services were always
[11:25] this particular way and then after a
[11:27] while you begin to get impatient if it
[11:28] doesn't happen or if this doesn't happen
[11:30] if that doesn't happen one of the
[11:31] greatest thing God wants to teach us is
[11:33] patience and that's why we can't get in
[11:36] the mind that we always need to be
[11:37] satisfied with some feeling or sensation
[11:40] or have God move immediately when we ask
[11:42] him to because that's not God's
[11:47] nature if he fulfilled his word and
[11:49] physical manifestations every time you
[11:52] ask for it you would get
[11:55] impatient and we we can say that is
[11:58] nothing but but the
[12:00] truth brother brandom even talked about
[12:02] how in certain circles where certain
[12:04] things are emphasized there's more
[12:06] backbiting and jealousy and there's more
[12:08] emotion and intensity and it all relates
[12:10] to that edge that gets on somebody when
[12:13] they need to see physical manifestations
[12:15] they begin to have a little bit of an
[12:16] impatient nature and therefore they lack
[12:19] grace and patience for other people let
[12:21] alone
[12:22] God or God let alone other people
[12:25] however you want to say that but
[12:27] patience is such an incredible virtue in
[12:29] James 1: 2 3 and 4 my brethren count it
[12:32] all joy when you fall into diverse
[12:34] Temptations how are we going to overcome
[12:37] Temptation by keeping the word of his
[12:40] patience so he says count it all joy
[12:42] when you fall into these many different
[12:44] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[12:46] of your faith worketh patience the
[12:49] woman's Faith was being tried Christ's
[12:51] Faith was being tried he was being
[12:53] tempted with the word to tempt god with
[12:56] the word but he had to keep the word of
[12:58] patience the angels of the Lord
[13:00] eventually came and ministered to him
[13:03] just as they would have if he left off
[13:04] the temple just as he was trying to
[13:06] accomplish by turning the stones into
[13:07] bread and the Lord is G going to give
[13:10] him all kingdoms and dominions he just
[13:12] had to wait to do it God's way the Trine
[13:16] of your faith worketh patience and he
[13:17] says but let patience have her perfect
[13:20] work the word of my patience the word of
[13:23] my patience is the the the word of my
[13:25] patience is the word that God has given
[13:28] to us so let the word of patience let
[13:31] patience have her perfect work that you
[13:34] may be perfect and entire wanting
[13:36] nothing amen through impatience we we
[13:39] get more
[13:40] impatient and it gets worse and worse
[13:42] and worse and it creates this negative
[13:44] feedback loop where it just has to
[13:46] become an echo chamber that Cycles
[13:47] around and there's a lot of cognitive
[13:49] dissonance and there's a lot of emotion
[13:51] and a lot of rallying in order to keep
[13:52] things afloat but let patience have her
[13:55] perfect work and that's how the bride is
[13:58] perfected
[14:01] Abraham's testimony demonstrates
[14:04] patience demonstrates that patience is
[14:06] required to fulfill the word he waited
[14:08] for the Fulfillment of the word now just
[14:11] to give us a little bit of Grace let's
[14:13] look at Abraham and see we see that in
[14:16] Abraham it Beed out that ultimately
[14:18] patience brought forth the promise and
[14:20] it required patience he didn't tell
[14:22] Abraham I'm going to give you seed and
[14:26] and he God speaks to him he says I'm
[14:27] going to give you children and Seed and
[14:29] he wakes up in the morning stretches and
[14:31] walks outside of his tent and every goes
[14:33] ABA ABA father father and he's like whoa
[14:35] what is this where are your
[14:37] sons that would have been really
[14:39] creepy uh but that's that's not the way
[14:42] that it happened it took time and God
[14:44] had to unfold in that process and I'm so
[14:46] glad that Abraham's life reveals Supreme
[14:50] faith in Genesis 15:4 it says behold the
[14:53] word of the Lord came unto him saying
[14:55] this shall not be thine Heir this is the
[14:57] one born of his own house he said lo and
[15:00] behold there is a son born to a servant
[15:02] in my household a slave in my household
[15:05] maybe he's the one but he says no this
[15:08] is not your Heir but he shall be but he
[15:10] that shall come forth out of thine own
[15:12] bows shall be thine Heir so God is just
[15:15] bringing it to more Precision Abraham
[15:17] didn't doubt the promise but he thought
[15:20] well since I'm not able to have kids
[15:22] maybe he could be the heir and it's not
[15:25] that Abraham doubted but yet you notice
[15:27] even Abraham in a sincere doesn't
[15:30] understand the promise that God had
[15:31] given him and he's saying oh you told me
[15:33] I would have an heir in my house maybe
[15:36] he's it that's Faith speaking in a way
[15:38] right saying oh well I'm not going to
[15:40] think it has to come any particular way
[15:42] maybe this is the one that it is and God
[15:44] says no it's going to be from
[15:46] yourself and then in chapter
[15:48] 16 and Sarah said unto Abraham behold
[15:51] now the Lord hath restrained me from
[15:53] bearing I pray that go in unto my maid
[15:57] it may be that I may obtain children by
[16:00] her and Abraham hearkened to the voice
[16:02] of Sarah what has happened Abraham
[16:05] thought maybe it was the son of his
[16:06] servant now Sarah with the understanding
[16:09] that it's going to be Abraham she offers
[16:11] her handmade her servant as a wife to
[16:14] Abraham and says maybe if she brings
[16:17] forth this child that I will obtain
[16:20] children by her and we know that Abraham
[16:23] did go unto her and that she conceived
[16:25] and brought forth the son I want you to
[16:27] see how brother brand identified what
[16:30] factors were working in the heart of
[16:32] Sarah to do this brother bam said Sarah
[16:34] tried to give God a little bit of help
[16:37] by herself right
[16:40] wow a little bit of help by herself it
[16:43] was that promise just being slightly
[16:46] doubted she thought she could give God a
[16:49] little help oh he said you're going to
[16:51] have a son well let's just make this
[16:54] work he said in the seed is not air with
[16:56] a shuck and Sarah thinking that God
[16:58] would not be able to keep all of his
[17:00] promises true she told Abraham to take
[17:03] Hagar what she thought is that God would
[17:06] not be able to keep all of his promise
[17:09] true
[17:10] wow the reproach for the cause of the
[17:12] word now you say how do you how do you
[17:14] gather that well her own actions showed
[17:17] that there was some uncertainty where
[17:19] she's now thinking well Abraham's not
[17:22] able to have children by me maybe he can
[17:24] have children by somebody else we'll see
[17:25] if this isn't going to work and he says
[17:27] it was the doubt thinking God wouldn't
[17:30] be able to keep his
[17:31] promises in the reproach for the cause
[17:33] of the word he said they were trying to
[17:34] manufacture something hegar and Sarah to
[17:38] help Abraham Abraham helped God to make
[17:41] his promise come true they were trying
[17:43] to help God do it now again it's this
[17:46] Paradox of well you believe it you think
[17:48] God can do it you want him to do it so
[17:50] why don't I just help you why don't I
[17:52] just help you do it you can't do that
[17:54] there's no way at all of doing it it's
[17:57] against everything
[17:59] God's word is going to happen anyhow
[18:02] you've just got to stand right on the
[18:04] word and say it's this way and keep the
[18:06] word now watch to manufacture something
[18:09] to take the place of his
[18:14] word we think we're fulfilling the word
[18:17] but it's actually
[18:19] impatience it's actually thinking that
[18:21] we can make it come true and you
[18:23] manufacture something that you would say
[18:26] God said you'd have a son he had a son
[18:28] but manufactured something to take the
[18:30] place of his word he said we could hold
[18:33] snakes and they wouldn't harm us but
[18:35] you've manufactured something to take
[18:38] the place of his word you drink poison
[18:40] because he says you shall drink a deadly
[18:41] thing and it won't harm you but you've
[18:43] manufactured something to take the place
[18:45] of his word it's an impostor it's a
[18:49] twin now in the example
[18:52] of Abraham with
[18:55] Hagar this impatience produced the wrong
[18:59] results the Bible says that the child
[19:02] shall come from thine own vows so it did
[19:04] come from Abraham it was the right seed
[19:07] but the wrong
[19:08] womb and though it was the right seed it
[19:11] being in the wrong room womb at the
[19:13] wrong season and it was born out of this
[19:16] idea of trying to manufacture something
[19:19] it could not produce the right results
[19:21] it did not produce the promised son we
[19:23] see the same thing with the woman e
[19:25] whether it be with the serpent or with
[19:26] Adam in Genesis chapter 6 16:2 and this
[19:29] is the ishmail that was born to Hagar
[19:32] and he will be a wild man his hand shall
[19:35] be against every man and every man's
[19:37] hand against him and he shall dwell in
[19:39] the presence of all his Brethren I want
[19:42] you to consider the results that happen
[19:44] when we manufacture something when it's
[19:46] a put on when it's a replacement for
[19:48] God's promised word when we begin to
[19:50] have some sort of uh we want to help God
[19:54] fulfill his word we lean into this idea
[19:57] of you have to do it and the Liberty is
[19:59] lost because you ought to do it and it's
[20:01] not doing what is right it's not doing
[20:03] what is correct it's not fulfilling the
[20:05] word of God it's a certain
[20:07] Optics to make us feel like we're doing
[20:10] something and accomplishing something
[20:11] saying yep word of God is being
[20:13] fulfilled notice the nature it begins to
[20:15] produce within people he will be a wild
[20:18] man his hand will get be be against man
[20:20] and every man's hand against
[20:22] him brother Brenham says in Hebrews
[20:25] chapter 6 part 3 now anytime you
[20:26] disbelieve the naked word of God and
[20:28] adopt some other way it'll be a thorn in
[20:31] your flesh from there on wow so anytime
[20:34] you swap out the naked word of God for
[20:37] some other way it is a thorn in your
[20:41] flesh so it will make you uncomfortable
[20:44] right it'll make you act in ways that
[20:46] you don't need to be acting it'll make
[20:48] you anxious and agitated it'll make you
[20:50] walk in pain it'll change the way you
[20:52] walk it'll change the way you think
[20:54] it'll change your desires you'll get
[20:55] desperate to lose it you'll think that
[20:57] you could just lean into it more and get
[20:59] used to it but anytime you swap out the
[21:01] naked word of God for a manufactured
[21:04] something it will be a thorn in your
[21:08] flesh he said you just take what God
[21:10] said if he said it that's just the way
[21:13] he means he says oh bless be his name
[21:15] just take the
[21:17] word that's what ishmail was when the
[21:19] right seed went to the wrong womb what
[21:23] happened when the woman received the
[21:24] wrong seed evees impatience birthed an
[21:27] ill-tempered selfish sensu sensual
[21:31] murderer that's the kind of son he was
[21:34] in Jude 11 it says wo unto them for they
[21:36] have gone in the way of Cain the way of
[21:39] Cain is also put in line in the greedy
[21:41] they ran greedily after the heir of
[21:43] balum for reward and perish in the gains
[21:45] of Kora this isn't good company if God's
[21:48] word has a Hall of Fame this is a hall
[21:50] of
[21:51] Shame they've gone in the way of Cain
[21:54] motivated by jealousy motivated by
[21:56] hatred motivated by popularity motivated
[21:58] by
[21:59] gain motivated by feelings and
[22:02] emotions they have gone in the way of
[22:04] Cain ishmail was a Wild Man Cain was a
[22:08] murderer he was sensual he was uh uh Ang
[22:11] easily
[22:12] agitated brother bandam says in the
[22:14] sermon
[22:16] identification and the word is the place
[22:18] to defeat the enemy that's what you give
[22:21] Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to
[22:22] defeat the enemy and when Eve reasoned
[22:25] with it and projected reasons with the
[22:28] word it fell apart and sin entered truly
[22:32] Lord that's been the downfall of men
[22:33] Through the Ages to try to inject
[22:36] something with the word remember we read
[22:38] the statement twice in the last couple
[22:39] Services how you try to inject something
[22:41] in the word to make yourself
[22:44] something Sarah tried the same thing to
[22:47] inject something to take in Hagar to
[22:50] bring the child but it fell
[22:52] through this is what Sarah was doing
[22:54] this is what the woman was doing they
[22:56] injected something in there she just
[22:58] couldn't wait she thought maybe God
[22:59] needed help there's this manufacturing
[23:02] of something now you realize the
[23:04] continuity with a lot of the statements
[23:06] we've been reading about manufacturing
[23:07] something so that's kind of a constant
[23:08] them that I hope is uh connecting these
[23:11] things together he said it's always been
[23:13] that way father you can gather from this
[23:15] that he's praying we just want your word
[23:16] and that alone nothing added to it or
[23:19] taken from it just the way it is and you
[23:22] are this
[23:24] word we don't want to project reasons we
[23:27] don't want to reason with it we don't to
[23:28] inject something in it to make ourselves
[23:30] something we just want your word and
[23:32] that alone we want the word only we want
[23:34] the word alone nothing added to it or
[23:36] taken from it we want the
[23:37] word it's your safety
[23:40] zone and when we get impatience we
[23:42] always want to add an addition we want
[23:44] to remodel the
[23:46] house we oh if we can just do this might
[23:49] improve the value the curb appe pill
[23:52] just do this doesn't say it's wrong just
[23:55] do this but just stay with the word
[23:59] now turn to Galatians 4:
[24:03] 21-31 read through this uh there's a lot
[24:06] of stopping we could do there's a lot of
[24:08] emphasizing that we could
[24:10] do but I think that just reading this
[24:13] read it it's in the seed is not air with
[24:15] the shook or the seed shall not be air
[24:17] with the shook I think those few times
[24:18] that brother brand preaches on this I
[24:19] know two in particular right now off
[24:21] hand this theme of the Bond woman
[24:25] ishmail and Isaac and Isaac being a type
[24:28] of Christ
[24:29] and we're talking about the subject of
[24:30] Liberty impatient Liberty I'm free I'm a
[24:33] Christian I'm a Believer but we begin to
[24:34] get impatient and that becomes bondage
[24:36] we lose our
[24:37] Liberty and we use our freedom to choose
[24:40] to be in bondage because you're
[24:43] free I I can do whatever I want in other
[24:45] words I can join myself to this Harlot I
[24:47] can join myself to this idea I can join
[24:49] myself to this theology this ideology I
[24:51] can continue to support something that
[24:53] is contrary to the word you're free to
[24:54] do
[24:55] that so Paul when we read in Galatians
[24:58] we find and I'm realizing now I just I
[25:00] think I left out some um critical
[25:02] scriptures here Paul is telling them
[25:04] that in this entire book how they've
[25:06] gone back into bondage again that they
[25:08] had been made free and now you've gone
[25:10] back into bondage and it all had to do
[25:12] with outward works of the Flesh and and
[25:14] circumcision and all these traditions of
[25:16] men that Christ had made them free and
[25:18] they're going right back into bondage
[25:20] again and he says this in verse 21 tell
[25:23] me ye that desire to be under the law do
[25:26] you not hear the law for it is written
[25:28] written that Abraham had two sons the
[25:30] one by a bondade and the other by a free
[25:33] woman and he who was of the Bond woman
[25:35] was born after the flesh now that's a
[25:38] key characteristic fleshly sensual uh uh
[25:41] you know the the the feeling of things
[25:44] but he of the free woman was by promise
[25:47] which things are an allegory for these
[25:49] are the two covenants the one from Mount
[25:51] sini which G which gendereth to bondage
[25:54] which is Hagar so this Hagar the inject
[25:58] something to manufacture something this
[26:01] work of impatience genders bondage it's
[26:04] under the law it's you have to do it you
[26:06] ought to do it it's not where the spirit
[26:08] of the Lord actually is for this AAR is
[26:11] Mount Si in Arabia and answer to
[26:14] Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage
[26:16] with her children but Jerusalem which is
[26:18] above is free which is the mother of us
[26:21] all for it is re written Rejoice thou
[26:24] bear and that beest not break forth and
[26:26] cry thou that travail us not for the
[26:28] despite for the desolate hath many more
[26:30] children than she which hath a husband
[26:32] now we Brethren as Isaac was are the
[26:35] children of
[26:37] promise now think about the ishmail
[26:40] think about the canes think about that
[26:42] seed that brother bam said you don't you
[26:44] have to do that there's the seed you
[26:47] have to do it there's the seed the the
[26:50] the injecting of something produces a
[26:52] nature notice what it does but as he
[26:54] that was born after the flesh persecuted
[26:56] him that was born after the spirit even
[26:58] so it is
[27:00] now are you listening you making
[27:03] application it's the impatient that
[27:05] begin to persecute the
[27:07] patient it's those that manufacture it's
[27:10] those that are sensual it's those that
[27:11] are getting worked up it's those that
[27:13] have gone in the way of Cain that begin
[27:15] to persecute those that are
[27:18] patient because he that is born after
[27:20] the flesh persecutes him that's born
[27:22] after the spirit even so it is now
[27:24] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[27:26] cast out the Bond woman and her son for
[27:29] the son of the Bond woman shall not be
[27:30] air with the son of the free woman so
[27:33] then brethren we are not children of the
[27:34] Bond woman but of the free Stand Fast
[27:37] therefore in the Liberty this is the
[27:39] opening of chapter 5 but we understand
[27:41] it because of the close of chapter four
[27:43] Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[27:44] wherewith Christ hath made us free and
[27:46] be not entangled again with the Yoke of
[27:48] bondage he will persecute he will
[27:51] squeeze he will Bluff he will intimidate
[27:54] he will bully he will do all sorts of
[27:56] things to try to move you from your
[27:57] Liberty but stand fast in the Liberty
[28:00] where Christ has made you free and be
[28:02] not entangled again with the Yoke of
[28:06] bondage there's this idea that gendereth
[28:08] bondage if it gendereth bondage there's
[28:10] a seed there's a covenant that has a
[28:12] seed of discrepancy there's a covenant
[28:15] that has a seed of you have to do this
[28:17] there's a covenant of trying to
[28:18] manufacture something there's a covenant
[28:20] of a false impersonation there's a
[28:22] covenant of a false Vine there's a
[28:24] covenant of death
[28:26] [Music]
[28:28] but then there's a covenant of life
[28:30] which is Liberty Stand Fast in the
[28:33] Liberty where with Christ hath made us
[28:34] free
[28:35] amen that's what I
[28:39] want in Luke chap 1:
[28:43] 31-35 now we realize that under the
[28:45] third pole there's going to be a squeeze
[28:47] there's going to be a persecution it's
[28:50] going to come from pretty close within
[28:52] and we see this example in Scripture
[28:54] that it's the twin that persecutes the
[28:57] real
[28:59] wow it's the so close it's the make
[29:02] believer it's it's it's that that one
[29:05] that falls for the supernatural offer
[29:07] it's the one who here is born after the
[29:09] flesh born after Hagar born after Mount
[29:12] siai born after the the builds his house
[29:14] upon the sand all the different images
[29:16] we could come in with that that idea
[29:18] that begins to be perpetuated they are
[29:20] the ones that will persecute the True
[29:24] Believer Luke chapter 1 vers we just do
[29:27] 30 3 I think it is to
[29:30] 35 I want start with did I not give Luke
[29:33] Chapter
[29:34] the yeah let's just go back to Galatians
[29:37] if that if it's not there let's just
[29:38] we'll come back to that here in a
[29:40] moment says in Luke chapter 1: 33 and
[29:44] behold Thou shalt conceive now this is
[29:46] this I want to give this example as I
[29:48] close I'll be closing here in just a
[29:49] minute or or
[29:52] several I mean I I'll be able to do it
[29:54] it'll be some minute or some second that
[29:56] I do it I guess I'm not one that usually
[29:57] tres to justify the uh I'm closing
[30:02] phrase um it's just a Trope that I just
[30:04] fell for I
[30:06] apologize but I want to use with uh the
[30:10] example of Mary as a contrast to the
[30:13] woman in the garden and Hagar or Sarah
[30:17] and even the church that brother B talks
[30:19] about on the day of Pentecost eventually
[30:20] the Antichrist Spirit was able to move
[30:22] her away from the truth so Christ would
[30:24] have come to that church but before he
[30:26] could come to her he found that she had
[30:28] left left her first love so now Mary
[30:31] let's look at Mary cuz brother rown uses
[30:32] her as this example in spoken word is
[30:34] the Original Seed uh my son Elliot is
[30:37] listening to that sermon and I was like
[30:39] well you better better pack a
[30:42] lunch he's like man that's a that's a
[30:44] long one says and behold Thou shalt
[30:47] conceive in thy womb and bring forth a
[30:48] son and shall call his name Jesus and he
[30:51] shall be great and shall be called the
[30:52] son of the highest and the Lord shall
[30:53] give unto him the Throne of his father
[30:55] and he shall reign over the house of
[30:57] Jacob forever and his kingdom shall be
[30:59] no end and and then Mary said okay now
[31:02] Mary it knows this is something
[31:04] Supernatural she's she's kind of taken
[31:06] back by wow this is amazing and then
[31:10] notice her initial response how shall
[31:13] this be seeing I know not a
[31:15] man the instinct is to be very natural
[31:19] the instinct is to think that oh this is
[31:22] what's going to happen then it has to
[31:23] happen maybe as it did with Abraham
[31:25] after the flesh maybe it has to happen
[31:27] this way because this is the way that
[31:28] it's always happened so she's thinking
[31:30] well in order for this to happen maybe I
[31:32] need to do
[31:34] something and the angel answered and
[31:36] said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come
[31:39] upon thee and the power of the highest
[31:42] shall overshadow thee therefore also
[31:45] that Holy thing which shall be born of
[31:47] thee shall be called The Son of
[31:51] God God is saying in this declaration of
[31:54] the angel that it will be the holy ghost
[31:57] that does it
[31:58] you will not need to inject something
[32:01] into your womb you will not need a man
[32:03] to help you bring this to pass but I
[32:05] have made the promise I have chosen you
[32:07] and according to the time of life I will
[32:10] make this
[32:11] happen of my
[32:14] own brother bam says it this way if you
[32:18] could just think about this Instinct of
[32:21] hers knowing how that seed would have to
[32:24] comes forth in the natural brother
[32:26] Braham says in the spoken word is the
[32:27] original received the womb Eve received
[32:30] the wrong seed word now listen real
[32:33] close now we're going to drive this
[32:36] right down if the Lord willing she
[32:38] received the wrong word what did it do
[32:40] it was Satan's lie said she would be
[32:43] wise well she could belong to the big
[32:46] church well she be well thought of in
[32:47] the city why she'd be like the rest of
[32:49] the people sure that's exactly what
[32:52] Jehovah's bride believed that's exactly
[32:55] what Satan would have tried to said when
[32:57] the word come to
[33:00] Mary Now Eve Sarah the church all these
[33:05] women that doubted that got impatient
[33:07] got emotional tried to move things
[33:10] along he said but he try and said when
[33:13] the word come to Mary but she shook him
[33:16] away she said how can this be the angel
[33:20] said the Holy Ghost will overshadow you
[33:22] it's the word of God she said be it unto
[33:24] me according to Thy
[33:26] word that br brought the
[33:29] life there you are well do you know
[33:31] Satan said they'll all laugh at
[33:33] you that little Rosy cheek girl didn't
[33:36] pay any attention to that right up in
[33:38] Judea she went you know I'm going to
[33:40] have a baby are you listening before she
[33:44] felt anything because the word had
[33:47] already been set there that was all she
[33:49] didn't have to go through the prayer
[33:51] line the second time you know no no no
[33:54] sir no sir she believed it she didn't
[33:58] have any sign of life she never had no
[34:01] sign of pregnancy at all she never felt
[34:04] nothing everything had been just like it
[34:07] was but she went telling everybody I'm
[34:10] going to have a baby why God said so
[34:14] what is that the Royal Seed of
[34:17] Abraham Hallelujah that's where we've
[34:19] got to be as the Bride of Jesus
[34:22] Christ before we feel anything we don't
[34:25] have to go through a prayer line you
[34:27] don't have to go through it a second
[34:29] time you don't have to have a sign you
[34:30] don't have to have any sign of
[34:33] pregnancy just believe God Amen take him
[34:37] at his word amen verse 37 for with God
[34:41] nothing shall be
[34:43] impossible and that brings that brings
[34:45] her to attention with god with
[34:48] man it is impossible but with God
[34:52] nothing shall be
[34:53] impossible behold the handmade of the
[34:56] Lord beat unto me according to Thy word
[35:00] and that was enough I believe that the
[35:02] angel perhaps just speculated maybe he
[35:04] would have stayed with her until she
[35:06] could accept it according to his
[35:09] word so well let's just spit ball on
[35:11] this a little bit let's huddle let's
[35:14] talk about this because I'm I'm not sure
[35:16] how this is going to work but she just
[35:19] said you know what before I feel
[35:21] anything I don't need a sign I don't
[35:23] need anything to happen I'm going to
[35:24] take you at your
[35:26] word and the angel departed from
[35:30] her could you just put yourself in her
[35:33] shoes in a a culture where Society is
[35:39] religion itself the people are built
[35:41] around promises they're their life their
[35:44] discipline their their very cultural
[35:47] identity is is their religion it's their
[35:49] their church is their home their church
[35:51] is their this is the Jews and they have
[35:53] this promise that a messiah is going to
[35:55] come and there's some obscure prophecies
[35:56] in the Old Testament that the Jews
[35:58] didn't necessarily zero in on that a
[36:00] virgin would conceive and that this
[36:01] would apply to the Future Messiah but
[36:03] could you imagine her saying the angel
[36:05] Lord came to me and said I'm going to
[36:08] have a baby without being preg
[36:11] impregnated by a man and how wild and
[36:14] crazy that would
[36:15] be
[36:20] like you sorry that just doesn't work
[36:23] that way and that's what Satan is saying
[36:25] they'll they'll laugh at you they're
[36:28] going to laugh at
[36:29] you but she said be it unto me according
[36:32] to Thy
[36:33] word and someone could have said well
[36:35] the Bible said this would happen and the
[36:37] theologians said well that's not what
[36:38] that means she said but I know what my
[36:40] faith tells me I know what God's
[36:42] revealed to
[36:43] me and I know where I'm standing and
[36:47] instead of being trying to make it
[36:49] happen and sneak around and inject
[36:51] something to it and ruining the word of
[36:54] God she just said be it unto me
[36:56] according to thy
[36:59] word and the seed shall not be air with
[37:02] the Shu I'm going to use this statement
[37:04] to kind of just bring that clein that
[37:05] home and then I have one more quotation
[37:07] to read before we close he said the true
[37:10] seed come forth from Mary but it was not
[37:13] her seed it was the promise of God that
[37:16] she said behold the handmade of the Lord
[37:18] the carriers of Life were the women but
[37:19] now Mary the seed so much
[37:22] closer Hagar had to receive it in a
[37:25] perverted way Sarah doubting the thing
[37:29] brought it to just a natural seed sexual
[37:33] desire but Mary without any sex at all
[37:37] believed the word and the Word was made
[37:41] flesh remember how brother Bram said one
[37:43] of the Mysteries is to receive the Holy
[37:45] Ghost without
[37:47] sensation and the next part is the word
[37:49] doing what it said it would
[37:51] do and so it's the word doing what it
[37:54] ought to do the word that he's promised
[37:56] for the season that you're in the
[37:58] promise coming for the hour that you're
[38:00] living not the Pentecostal idea of
[38:03] injecting something and Performing
[38:05] something and doing something and trying
[38:07] to make it look a particular way but the
[38:10] Holy Ghost in This Hour you can receive
[38:11] the Holy Ghost without sensation and
[38:14] brother bam use that to connect it with
[38:16] the desires and the lust and the
[38:18] longings of the
[38:20] flesh there's the without sensation
[38:23] without the impatience without the
[38:24] Restless longing and desire in order you
[38:26] can have an experience that satisfies
[38:28] you don't have to have a litmus test did
[38:30] you shout did you cry did you make it a
[38:32] mess on your
[38:33] own listen if we just say well a bir's a
[38:36] mess you know what we can just make it
[38:37] real
[38:39] messy I remember oh some of you Ohio
[38:42] winds helped me out that guy in
[38:44] Cincinnati that preacher who not a
[38:48] message Preacher Man I wish I could
[38:50] remember his name he had a pretty big
[38:51] voice I he may I never mind I but I
[38:55] remember one time he was preaching and
[38:56] he said that that Legion that demon he
[39:00] was all messed up he was all messed up
[39:04] and he got all messed up he was just
[39:05] talking about being messed up so you
[39:07] know about 15 minutes later he was
[39:09] everybody's getting really excited
[39:10] dancing around he's like come on
[39:11] everybody get messed up in here I was
[39:14] like okay well they know exactly what
[39:15] they're talking
[39:20] about that that it is that
[39:23] sensation has to be tongues or it has to
[39:26] be shouting it has to be dancing and it
[39:27] has to be this it has to be that has to
[39:29] be the word that's what it has to be a a
[39:33] and if if someone right now uh the Holy
[39:35] Ghost struck them and they were
[39:37] paralyzed and they couldn't move and
[39:38] they just stood there in the presence of
[39:39] God who are we to say that's not God but
[39:42] if we say well the word of God says that
[39:44] they all fell down and if you're not
[39:46] falling down you're not in the word well
[39:50] okay well just show me show me in the
[39:52] word where it's you have to cuz I know
[39:55] you have to be born in the uh bornn
[39:57] again
[39:57] you must be baptized in the name of
[40:00] Jesus Christ there are certain things in
[40:01] there that you must do things that you
[40:03] ought do it's correct but we add to the
[40:05] word when we say you have
[40:08] to and we take away when we say you
[40:11] shouldn't because brother say there's
[40:13] nothing wrong with
[40:15] it Brothers come to your instruments
[40:18] please brother bandam writes this in the
[40:20] church age book there're the
[40:21] Philadelphian age after he made the
[40:23] statement about Abraham's patience he
[40:25] said God gives us exceeding great and
[40:28] precious
[40:29] promises he has promised to fulfill them
[40:32] he
[40:33] will but from the time we pray until the
[40:36] time we get the answer we must learn to
[40:39] receive patience into our souls for only
[40:41] in patience do we possess
[40:45] life may God help us to learn this
[40:47] lesson even as we know the people of
[40:49] this sixth age learned
[40:51] patience we read the history of the
[40:53] lives of these great Christians what a
[40:56] contrast we see between their lives and
[40:58] ours for they were so patient and
[41:02] quiet and today we are all but overcome
[41:07] in over
[41:09] impatience and
[41:12] haste brother B said time and time again
[41:14] we're the ones in a hurry God's not in a
[41:17] hurry be still and know that I am God
[41:21] they that wait upon the
[41:22] Lord we we're the ones that get in a
[41:24] hurry oh oh no this hasn't happened this
[41:26] hasn't happened I it's to even you know
[41:28] sometimes say well look at the where the
[41:29] message is it's going to be 2025 and
[41:31] it's been so many years since the
[41:33] messenger went off the scene and are we
[41:34] any better off and we've never taken a
[41:36] Rapture and this hasn't happened we've
[41:38] tried to do this and we've tried to do
[41:39] that and then so what do we try to do we
[41:41] try to do something
[41:42] else thinking that if we just shut the
[41:45] church doors and stay home maybe that'll
[41:47] do it or if we just start making church
[41:48] a little bit more excitable maybe
[41:50] that'll do it when whatever what we have
[41:52] to do is just stay with the
[41:53] word stay with the word I believe that
[41:58] God has promised us the supernatural I
[42:00] believe that God has set things in his
[42:02] church that we should be at liberty for
[42:03] the Holy Ghost to exercise and to use I
[42:05] believe that God is confirming himself
[42:08] amongst us with signs and wonders but
[42:10] our emphasis has to be right and our our
[42:12] our ought to ought it should must be
[42:14] correct yes amen that's right otherwise
[42:17] we'll make the mistake of being tempted
[42:20] to tempt God we'll get
[42:22] impatient then we'll get jealous then
[42:25] we'll get murderous we'll get thorns in
[42:27] our flesh we'll be unwilling uh to just
[42:31] follow the will of God for our lives
[42:32] we'll be unwilling to get along and
[42:34] it'll be one unhappy
[42:40] mess I wish I could remember that
[42:41] preacher's name don't get messed up
