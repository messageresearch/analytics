TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just like to say to each of you god bless you thank you for coming to the house of the lord this morning and i pray that together we'll just have such a wonderful time in the lord i believe brother chris said all i have to do is beat the previous speaker as concerning time and uh so i'm hoping that this sunday everybody will get out early y'all just pray for me um i do want to say that i really did enjoy wednesday night service brother chris i've been chewing on it since wednesday night and i didn't know if anybody else was and so when i came down yesterday the rubik's were kind enough to open their home to me and i uh immediately as soon as brother lucas said how much he enjoyed wednesday night my eyes lit up because i thought man praise the lord let's let's fellowship about this because i enjoyed it so much um i really i the x factor and and and the representation and i'd like to mention some of that here this morning i believe it was just uh the providence of the lord really uh was really wonderful so i hope that you take courage brother chris in in that knowing that i was feeding upon it so this morning for a title i would like to title this service a message for daughters and um now i i know that might make the men a little bit nervous and it might make families that don't have daughters a little bit nervous as well brother travis don't don't fret don't worry because i can i can virtually guarantee that everybody here either came from a daughter is a daughter is married to a daughter has sons who one day lord willing will marry a daughter and no doubt there's some young men here that are seeking a daughter somewhere and so if you feel like i don't know if this is going to be applicable to me i assure you it will and i took the same font i know those that would be streaming can't see this but i took the same font that brother aaron took a week ago from his service and his sermon motherhood back to the office and i took uh the same font for a reason i i as brother aaron was ministering about motherhood knowing that i had this thought on my mind already when he began going through his sermon and speaking beginning in genesis and talking about the man and the woman being created i thought oh no he's gonna he's just gonna run with my notes he's just gonna take it i'll have nothing to preach next week uh but thank the lord i believe that it ties together nicely so last week we were celebrating mothers this week we will celebrate daughters and uh so um as we look at the scripture oh we good i'm glad you took this up uh this actually came from brother brother aaron's sermon the hood part coming from motherhood and brother travis and i were speaking after the service last week and as brother aaron pulled this slide up and we thought interesting hood where is he going to go with this and it says a particular state or condition or a specific period in someone's life i thought oh my i'm glad he went that direction because in my mind if you're from the streets of compton or the streets of queens or flagstaff hood means something entirely different and so this being pastor the end of pastor depreciation week uh i thought well i might as well take his slide and uh and we're just gonna go ahead and re-preach brother aaron's sermon we're not gonna do that so i'd like to look back at zechariah chapter 9 and verse 9. the scripture says rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon the cult the fall of an ass and as i as we look at this scripture and and hold in mind the the title a message for daughters i as i as this uh sermon was building in my mind i thought i i want to i want to present this as a father who has daughters um like it would be a message to my own daughters and the things that i would desire for my own daughters and i've got two beautiful young daughters um they're growing up so fast on me but i would i as i titled it a message for daughters i want you to know that this is not the message for daughters i am merely blowing the dust off of the top of this scratching the surface if you will this is not the the all-encompassing message for our daughters i believe uh i wish i had the gift that that uh or at least a part of the gift that brother aaron has where he does such a nice job of of taking us a thought and creating a series from that thought and i i i've never been able to do that i typically i just i just let it all out and uh and then and then you just let it all fall where it lays and and you pick up what you can but i think that you could uh i think throughout the scripture and through all the examples in the bible we could take service after service preaching a message for our for daughters and so just bear with me as we're only going to scratch the surface here and i pray that our daughters will thoroughly enjoy this and that the young men will also grab what i believe is your portion and i think there will be a lot more there for you than you think amen i'd like to visit the scripture in genesis chapter 1 and it's in chapter 1 and verse 27 i believe brother aaron did a such a nice job of covering this but this time with a thought of daughters instead of motherhood in mind genesis chapter 1 verse 21 27 excuse me says so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and what we're seeing here is a picture of when god created man adam as as his brother aaron brought out i think so nicely it was creating mankind and that mankind encompassed both male and female and so when god created mankind what he created for himself was a son and a daughter he got both in a package and i think that that's such a a lovely picture because our sisters should not feel left out here you were a part of that creation and when we look in genesis chapter one and as you as as the scripture unfolds god uh god's creation he goes through each day and and through each day at the end of the first day in the second day and the third day in the fourth day all the way up to the sixth day you find the scripture declaring it was good and it was good and i believe that after he created uh man and and he saw that it was in his his image we find that god said it was very good he looked upon all of his creation now and he said it's very good and i believe we could say amen to that i i thoroughly enjoy what god has created for us here uh you know i love that brother branham says he's a god of variety he created the mountains and he created the deserts and he created the oceans and i'm so thankful for that i i'm so glad that we're not just uh all the same type of people some enjoy the mountains and some enjoy the deserts and some enjoy the the the beaches and the ocean uh i heard somebody say one time christians don't go to the beach they visit the ocean so if that makes you feel better right just tell people you're visiting the ocean but i'm so glad that there's such a variety in the body of christ but when we get to genesis chapter 2 and verse 18 the scripture says and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him and help me for him and then we know that god puts asleep upon adam and from adam's rib he creates a woman and adam declares this is a woman for she's flesh of my flesh and she's born of my bone and this is now where we can see a distinction uh it's not the same being we now have two beings but remember that when god created a wife for adam he was creating a daughter for himself and so now we're going to look through the scripture and we're going to see that it is replete with examples for our daughters it speaks of daughters in so many different ways and and i just want to say this that uh when you have sons which i have sons as well and you ask your sons as parents son who's your favorite bible character uh just who's your favorite your your typical answers are going to be david sampson moses jesus these are your typical answers for sons anybody that's killing philistines the boys like that guy shamgar may be another one but when you have daughters and you say who's your favorite character in the bible typically your answers are going to be esther ruth mary sarah rebecca rachel and we feel so sorry for leah and these are your typical answers this is what you're going through in your home when you're speaking with your daughters and and you're teaching them in uh their sunday school lessons you ask them who's your favorite characters those are your typical answers and so i think if we i don't i think they were put in the bible for a reason for an example and i think we all believe that we could all say sure amen to that and i want to take some time and i i want to uh i want to go through some of these examples but before we do uh i'm as i'm going back and i'm looking at these scriptures in genesis chapter one and genesis chapter two there's a a quote that's from the smyrnian church age i believe and i don't know brothers you if you have that brother branham says this the heart purpose and i would encourage you go and get your church age book and open this up because it's there's we only grabbed a snippet of this quote such a fantastic quote brother branham says the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world and so this thought of of having a daughter god in his in the mind of god eons back before the foundation of the world god desired to have daughters and we know that that daughter that he created being a bride for adam then we can we can recognize when we look through scripture that the daughters that we read about in scripture are a type of a bride for jesus christ that when we are talking about a message for daughters we're not simply speaking only to the the females that would go to church but we recognize that a woman in the bible always is a type of the church good or bad a woman always types a church and so uh i really appreciated brother chris on wednesday night uh going into this the the story of those uh those uh not non-astronauts uh normal civilians who were able to take a ride on that rocket ship and one of those people being that young woman that had no shot ever before of being able to go into space because of the circumstances in her life but because she had representation she was able to do something that that most civilians would never be able to do and it was because of that representation and and so we're now seeing by looking into this quote that there was representation for you before the foundation of the world there was representation of all the daughters that that that are hearing the word of god there's representation of you and that representation was there before the foundation of the world oh my now being a father of daughters i'll i'm going to relay to you a personal story um when i was hunting for a wife and i i discovered sister grace um thank the lord i didn't they were from the east coast and i was from the west coast and we didn't know each other that well and it was a good thing because they'd have probably never allowed me to come into their home um her being the daughter of a of a pastor uh and and and quite a character um i'm glad that that that god ordained the circumstances the way he did but when i was looking to marry this young lady this daughter of a pastor the lord sister grayson i love when we have people in our home especially couples we want to know their story we want to know how they were married how they how they met each other and and how that everything transpired for them to end up married to each other how did it take place we want to know the story and usually when we draw the story out from everybody then the response is well what's your story and sister grace and i feel that that that the hand of the lord was in our entire relationship and i'm sure all you husbands and wives feel that way and and just to see the hand of god working every circumstance to where uh the two of us could could not only uh be in union together but serve the lord together and have the same desire to serve uh the lord together but i remember we would be praying and asking the lord uh you know are we meant to be are we meant to be married together uh can you lord show us a sign if you would do that and perhaps we were like the greeks uh searching for signs and things maybe it's just young love i don't know but it was everything we could do was we just need to know are we meant to be together or not and when we felt that the lord had confirmed that to us over and over and over i remember thinking now why why doesn't her dad catch it uh i i'm so confused why would this man not just hand his daughter right over to me and and and and the thought process i believe for every young man who who has grown up listening to the message of the hour is that you're gonna walk up to her dad and he's gonna say you can have her bill and i was really i was really anticipating that's how it was going to go and uh it was so contrary to that but i couldn't understand that i thought now why would any man not want his daughter to marry me i'm such a fine young upstanding i guess 22 years old 23 you don't have it all together really and i just uh especially being long distance you have to understand we were we were only allowed to to speak to each other for 30 minutes once a week um which everybody's like wow but we wrote a lot of letters and and and we were just pecking at email at that time but i i thought you know i don't understand how how he can't why he wouldn't just hand his daughter over and then our daughter was born our first daughter and the moment that i held her in my hands i understood perfectly how he felt and i i remember several years ago we were in town doing some shopping and i i thought you know i don't know if i thoroughly thanked her parents for handing their daughter over to me eventually and so i just had to call them and say hey thank you um because now that i have daughters i understand what that means to have a daughter and i have a scripture it's it's in ruth chapter 4 verse 15 it's the second half but it says uh it's speaking these are the the women speaking to naomi for thy daughter-in-law speaking of ruth which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons have borne him and i'll be honest with you when uh sister grace and i were expecting our first child i knew it was a son i knew that was the only thing that you could have was sons and so i uh it came that that that that time i think it was uh about 20 weeks of pregnancy where you get to find out what you're going to have and they said it was a human being which was a good thing but when when the doctor announced to us congratulations you're going to have a daughter i think sister grace was a little disappointed in my reaction which wasn't a bad reaction it just wasn't a reaction at all because i didn't i didn't i i just couldn't i never in my mind put what how what what do you do with it i can't have a daughter what do you do with daughters i can't play catch with a daughter can i and i couldn't understand that and i was taken back but i tell you that first moment that i held her after she was born this is exactly how i felt she that a daughter when she is born they have this this amazing invisible lasso that wraps around the heart of a father and you feel like i wouldn't take 12 sons for one of these and they become daddy's girls and you're just proud as a peacock and i'm so glad that before the foundation of the world god had in his mind daughters along with sons and that when he made man he made him male and female he had his son and his daughter and when he separated them he still had him a daughter and not only was that a daughter but that daughter was going to be the bride for his son and the representation of of creating a woman in in in the mind of god being a type of a pure and spotless virtuous bride for jesus christ it's so precious it's so clean and so as i as we now take a little bit of a journey through some of the examples that are in the bible we we i'd like to start with ruth and rebecca and there's so many things that happen in in ruth's life and brother branham has a whole sermon the kinsmen redeemer and it's just it it just takes you all the way through the book of ruth and you can see perfectly uh the bride represented in ruth and and boaz being being christ but something that um that comes from the kinsmen redeemer uh that i that represented and i'm so glad i saw this because i was gonna grab it another one for rebecca because brother branham he he uses this more than one time but he says here well lord and he's he's quoting as if this is what we would say to him well lord if you'll just bless me and do this for me i'll do so and so brother branham says that's not a decision god i don't care what you do with me i'll go anyhow if i die all right live or die whatever if they laugh at me make fun of me don't make any difference i'll go anyhow that's clean-cut decision like rebecca made for she even seen isaac her parents said let her let the girl answer the girl she's of age let her answer she said i'll go clean cut decision quickly made she claimed to it that's what ruth did orpah went back they journeyed on ruth in her heart not knowing where she was going but a type of the church we sojourn like abraham pilgrims in a strange land among strange people and i would say this i i grabbed this for an example when we look at the story of ruth when we look at the story of rebecca and we see this clean cut decision and and and that clean cut decision for rebecca was will you marry this man isaac that you've heard so much about but you've never seen him she was so confident in what the messenger had told her about isaac that she was willing to make a clean-cut decision i'll go and and that being a representation of the church of each and every individual that comes to the decision to live for jesus christ to say i desire to know the love of god i desire to have uh his spirit residing in me because i can't do this by myself and that is a decision that every believer has got to come up against will you go will you serve will you love will you for him and our decision uh and brother branham just gives so much uh uh uh a commendation to to rebecca and to ruth for making a decision so clean cut not just wishy-washy well i'll go ah you know i'm uncomfortable let's go back well okay no i think i'll go nah not this week i don't feel good no it was a final decision made i'll go and when we look at the story of ruth and how that she told uh uh her mother-in-law naomi let your people be my people let your god be my god where you live i'll live where you die i'll die there but please don't separate us let death come before i'm separated from a decision like this and oh my believers listen when we were were were granted the grace of god to hear the word of god and and discover that this great god who is he this jehovah god this spirit that i cannot see when we discovered who he was his name is jesus that god came and he made himself flesh he made himself visible so that we could have an idea of who god is something in our heart said i'll go i want that brother chris wednesday night brought out that woman at the well and i think brother branham uses the example of the woman at the well probably more than any other example throughout the bible because because of the circumstance that she was in for one for two the gift that was demonstrated there at the well was now made evident again in our day which caused us to say that comes from the bible i can see that in the bible and it gives us confidence and it gives us faith that the same god that would meet a woman at the well who was in a terrible situation that same god is still here today and that he can speak to our hearts as he did that woman's heart but also i think again as was so aptly spoken wednesday night the representation that was in that woman to be able to say this is the messiah this is this man who told me all things is not this the very messiah and she ran and told all the people i have seen the sign of the messiah in our day he's here he's come and see him and her by her testimony it brought the men from the city and all of these men had to come and see for themselves to believe that this this too they could believe was the messiah that god was on earth and that representation i think is is so wonderful and i i think of the woman at the well i think of of mary magdalene another uh beautiful example of a woman who seemed like her life was tarnished her life was finished there was as far as uh having um as as job said is there not a god is there not a days man who can who can span a holy god and a sinful man where is this man and then job caught the revelation and he saw my redeemer liveth and and and for a woman like mary magdalene for a woman like this woman at the well this samaritan when they could discover that there was a daze man there was somebody who could touch a holy god and and wrap their arm around a sinful person and and and bring them together and and take all of the uncleanness away and invite them to the highest place to become a daughter of god to become a the bride of jesus christ there's nothing greater in this world had jesus said look the best i can give you is money it's it wouldn't have been what she wanted it wouldn't have filled the spot brother lucas and i as we were going through this and creating these slides and looking through these notes there was something that we we agreed was the central theme of this sermon and that was if we can we as the church we as the bride we as daughters of god uh the daughters of zion if you will if that makes you men feel better so that i'm not calling you daughters of god but daughters of zion if we can properly identify the bride groom excuse me if we can properly identify the bridegroom throughout the scripture and we can properly put him in the place that he that he so deserves and that he he just holds then we can then properly identify the bride and see her in her place and i told this to brother lucas this is a feeling that i would have for my daughters like this woman at the well or mary magdalene shame filled their lives and that's evident in their conversation and it's evident in like that woman who had to come to the well at a separate time of day that other women would not come with her because of who she was this feeling of shame and as we were looking back in at the genesis account of the woman and when adam and eve when their eyes were opened their eyes were opened to a realization that brought them to shame that brought shame in their life and again if i was thinking of expressing this to my daughters i want i would want them to know make no mistake about it when you read in hebrews chapter 11 about moses and it says that moses esteemed the reproach for christ greater riches than that of egypt there is a reproach for christ as as we read in that quote that the thought behind uh ruth or rebecca was god i don't care what you do with me live or die whatever if they laugh at me or make fun of me it doesn't make any difference i'll go anyhow and history has demonstrated how that the believer that would follow christ there's a reproach that comes along with that decision but that reproach should never be mistaken for shame that is certainly two separate things and there's a huge chasm between both of those a reproach for christ is as i believe one place brother branham speaks about a woman's long hair is her cr is a crown of thorns is likened unto a crown of thorns and it's a reproach it's it's identifying yourself with christ in his suffering it's being identified with christ where shame comes in is a separation between you and christ it's a devil's attempt at driving a wedge between our lives and christ and and and god doesn't desire that we would have shame in our life and not to equate that with the reproach for christ and i would never want my daughters to ever feel that living for christ is a shameful thing because it's the most glorious thing that there is is to live for god to be called a daughter of god and as we look at these characters in the bible i wanted to not only just have in mind the esther's and the ruths and the rebeccas and and mary's but there's also there's also examples in the bible of of daughters that we would want our children to and our daughters to never be like and the examples that i could off the top of my head come come up with was immediately jezebel and her daughter athaliah we know that when jezebel married ahab who was king of israel it was a political move it was an attempt to to unite uh uh nations together it certainly was not based upon religious belief or or uh uh to to uh edify what israel knew to be the one true god and we realized that when ahab married jezebel it brought idolatry to those 10 tribes of israel but the two tribes of judah remained clean as they had jehoshaphat as king but jehoshaphat had a son as well and his son because of the way that kings would marry into each other's families to strengthen bonds and to strengthen nations we find that jehoshaphat's son jehoram married ahab and jezebel's daughter and that was ethelia and as soon as he married her we now see idolatry filling up even those two tribes of judah so now idolatry is throughout all israel and when we look at that example brother branham does such a nice job in the church age book of demonstrating who this woman is and who these daughters are we say god don't let my daughters be like that don't don't let me uh bring up my my daughters to uh to pattern after that i i thought of herodias and her daughter and how that it was her daughter that that danced for the king that caused john the baptist's head to be this is a a a girl who when we see her actions and how that she was merely feeding to a man's desires and to his carnal desires then within the evil that it brought we we it causes us to say oh daughters be careful what you do be careful how you act and and i think of my own daughters and and i and i it would be very easy for me to take them through the scripture and say let's take it let's take a look at how these how these daughters acted and see what the results it brought we see this in revelations chapter 17 mystery babylon the great and the bible says and her daughters were harlots she was the mother of harlots and so what we're seeing is a mother acting a certain way and the daughter falling right in line and doing the very same thing and these are such good examples for us to to keep as as believers in our homes in our arsenal uh in our script bag as david would have full of stones to be able to share with our daughters examples to say don't pattern your life like that don't do that and when the questions come up why mom why dad how come this girl can do this how come this one does this we can say let us look at history let us look at the example that's been set before us and show you what it leads to the flip side of those daughters in my mind is the story of esther and i think that esther demonstrates a word that i think we we use to mean something and that word is holiness and when when you hear the word holiness uh that could be you could use that word around uh other uh message believing churches you could use that word in some baptist churches you could use that in some pentecostal churches and the general idea that's going to come from that is dress is the way a man or a woman would dress but we as students of the word of god and and and and hearing the message of the hour realize that holiness is more than a dress holiness is a way of life that holiness the word itself comes from the word sanctification which is to be set aside and used for service and when we look at holiness i want to i want to look at a couple scriptures one in his is in isaiah chapter 3 and i'm hoping these brothers will have it good wonderful isaiah chapter 3 and verse 16 says moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet it gives us an image that is so contrary to holiness it it lets us know that their neck is stretched forth and they're haughty they're they're not walking in a humility there's no humility here that this is haughtiness that this is arrogance that that is walking forth and when we see this mincing immediately i if if you've again listened to the message of the hour long enough you find that brother branham speaking about a dream that i believe him or his mother had about a woman who was walking up a cliff and and as she walked up this pathway that the the path got narrower and narrower and narrower and she was wearing high heels and brother branham begins to talk about how that those high heels cause mincing and and that mincing caused her to lose her balance and fall off a cliff and fall into hell and so when you get imagery like that immediately as a father with daughters you're thinking oh god please keep my children on a path that god is safe caused them to walk not in haughtiness not with arrogance and not in a way that would be displeasing to the lord and and lord when you can put your humility as we read in in zechariah 9 9 that thy king cometh lowly meek writing upon the fall of an ass with humility and we see the contrast that our lord gives with this scripture of haughtiness it causes me as a father to say oh god let the humility that was in christ be in my daughters and god not only in my daughters but let it be represented in me first that god if if if if the if the daughters of zion is a representation of the bride of jesus christ god don't let me be haughty don't let me mince around in a way that would that would be displeasing to you or that would catch even the attraction of the enemy and i believe that if the humility of christ if the love of christ if the lowliness of of jesus christ would be in the heart of any man or any woman the clothing part will take care for itself it's not then it's not a difficult thing it's it's it's not a a a heavy burden to bear but it's it's a liberty it's a freedom in christ in second corinthians chapter 6 verses 16 through 18 the scripture says and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord that's speaking of holiness and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty once again we see god bringing in his daughters into this as paul is speaking that not only will you be my sons but i'll have sons and daughters and i'll live in them and i'll walk in them but come out that was the cry for our age come out from among them be ye separate from the things of the world be ye separate from the norm of religion be separate from just a mental uh theology or or or just a show um or or or or creeds and dogmas come out from that be separate from that let me live in you let me walk in you i am doing well i'm doing really well praise the lord i'm coming to a close believe it or not well we all know what that means that that's been abused so many times that and i've i'm guilty right here myself but i want to close with this idea that i want there to be a practical use a practical purpose for both my daughters and for the church for the bride of jesus christ when we when we talk about these things sometimes it comes out from the pulpit so nicely it it it sounds so wonderful and we think that's right brother that's right but then we've got to make that rubber meet the road and so many times we think man i felt so good about that on sunday but you know by thursday afternoon i don't know i my desire for my own children for for my daughters would be that there would be a practical purpose for the word of god in their life when i read my bible when we do when i'm alone and i'm having my devotions with the lord and you just get into the word of god and you begin to read and as you begin to study with a desire in your heart to know him in a greater way when his spirit comes by it's so sweet i think i just don't think there's anything that could take the place of of a family family devotions there's such an intimacy there's such a freedom to be able to just talk about the things of god to be able to get into a scripture and say does everybody understand what we just read there and you can take time and and you know usually my children i think they roll their eyes a lot if dad's going to take some time expounding on the scripture maybe because they get they hear me so much when i'm preaching but when they when when your children begin to open up when your children when you can see that the lord is dealing with their heart or you're listening to a you're listening to a tape you're listening to a message maybe the discernment line starts at the end of the service and you maybe have listened to that tape a dozen times but there's something about when your heart you being needy from god you needing the spirit of god to feed you when god begins when you can hear on tape god dealing with the lives of men and women who are in such dire straits they're in such a bad condition when you can hear somebody that's got a tumor when you can hear somebody who uh is is in a wheelchair and you hear them released from that and you hear them come you know the the the reaction from from the congregation when somebody gets up out of a wheelchair or off of a cart it stirs your heart in such a way as if it was you or as if it was your own family member that just got up out of that wheelchair or off that cart and you begin to rejoice in your heart that jesus christ is still touching lives that jesus christ still heals the sick and it's so pure and it's so clean that you just you want to you want to encapsulate that moment that you're listening to it and you want it to be that way all the time you want it to be that way in your life uh you want it to be that way i know for for for me for for us men we'd like to bring that atmosphere into the work we'd love for our our co-workers to feel just one time the presence of god move down and do something in their heart and you think oh god as men we think god let me do that well as fathers we feel that way too for our children and and and and you mothers for your babies you you you desire that when god stirred your heart with the message that your children are getting that same feedback that they're they're feeling that same relationship with jesus christ and when it becomes practical and thank the lord that it can become practical in a church service it can become real in a church service now i have to admit it's probably become more real to me in my truck it's become more real to me uh when i'm i'm you know at home when i'm pulling weeds out of my garden and i'm listening to the to a message and i'm hearing the moving of the spirit of god i just think oh my this is so wonderful we could just i feel like you know peter lord let us build three tabernacles right here why can't we just have church in my backyard and we all come pull my weeds out of my garden and you get to feel the same thing our desire is that everybody will feel that same thing it's our desire for that's my desire for my daughters is that when when brother chris you're preaching about representation that representation that was in that girl and you begin talking about that girl there was no way she was going to make it on a rocket she had metal legs and i should say metal in her legs but she had cancer and and she would had sickness and she had things in her body that she'd never been able to become an astronaut but because of the representation she was able to do something that that that even the fittest of athletes weren't invited to they just were not invited and and when you begin to hear that in a sermon your your as a parent my heart for my children for my daughters is oh daughter catch it catch that you've got representation if you can recognize that if you can take that in for yourself the things how that god will bless you and how the god can can give you a peace when when there's turmoil in the home and there's turmoil uh where wherever in school or or or wherever you would be there is a piece of god that you can experience and you can get confidence that i've got representation as a daughter of god amen i'd invite the musicians to come at this time while i read you this this is from questions and answers number three and we we did condense this a little bit but so that you have a little bit of a a foreshadow of what brother branham is going to be discussing here the question comes up would you please explain first corinthians chapter 7 verse 1 and 9. now what that next line is is verse 9. that is first corinthians chapter 7 verse 9. but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn brother branham says all right that's for just dirty living instead of a man a boy girl or something or another when they're going together and they know that they should be married go ahead and get married i think you'd understand what i mean don't you see don't just live a dirty little life there because it's not right you see that's your sister in one sense where if you're a christian now if it's the world it's the world dog eat dog but this girl that you're going with that's your sister too that'll be the mother of your children that will come don't live a dirty little life around her show that you're a real christian live like a christian gentleman ought to see and treat her like your sister and when you get married still treat her that way [Music] and you women live the right way to your husband and you husbands live the right way to your wives be real real nice and respect one another just with in your family relations and so forth like that let it be just as reverently and godly and agreed with among you and everything [Music] talk to your wife if one nature is to you and another nature to her talk it with her you try to do the same thing to him sister in the same way understand one another there's so much in just that word understand and be real christian gentlemen and real christian ladies brother and sister with one another always remember you're god's children and you're from royal family you're a royal blood there's no better blood in the world than yours and that's right and a royal blood shows itself that's what it is it's royal i'll believe that say amen yes sir show what you are i'm a son of a king i'm the son of the king my wife's a daughter of a king how would i treat that king's daughter how would she treat that king's son see what i mean be real genuine that's what i would want my daughters to be real genuine if you want to be a christian be a genuine christian you want to be a husband be a genuine husband you want to be a wife that's practical to me that's something that god has placed now as we look back at zechariah 9 9 it says rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout out daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee oh it's a little bit different you're not just a bystander who's watching a king coming but you're the son of the king you're a daughter of the king that makes the relationship a little bit different when we say thy king cometh he's your dad he's your daddy that's your father he's coming now in the message what is the attraction on the mountain this is the only message i can find where brother branham really elaborates on these scriptures what he points out is that the same prophet that speaks of the first coming of jesus christ and this is a prophecy of his coming that thy king cometh riding upon an ass upon the fall of an s and we see it come to pass when jesus is riding into jerusalem and they're laying down palms in their coats and they're saying hosanna hosanna to the highest those that were looking for him those that were attracted to something that was taking place those that were attracted to the word of god and knew that there was a coming messiah they were looking for him and when they recognized he was coming they began to shout hosanna hosanna to the highest but that same prophet that brought to us the recognition and a prophecy of the first coming of christ in zechariah chapter 14 and i'm just going to read the last part of verse 5 down to verse 7 and the lord my god shall come and all the saints with thee and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that evening it shall be light brothers and sisters i believe we're living in the evening time and if we're living in the evening time we've been we've been uh put on uh on alert that you're living in the day of the second coming of the lord that we can look for him that those that are attracted to the things that god is doing in this day we can rejoice greatly o daughters of zion we can rejoice for our king who is our daddy he's coming for us he's coming again and he's let us know now in the message in time evangelism i just want to read this last portion brother branham says now we're going to end right here by saying [Music] end time this is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture this is a message this message of the hour is a message for daughters it's a message for you daughters of zion there is a rejoicing and knowing who your king is and when you can properly place him you'll be able to properly identify who you are and see your place as the bride of jesus christ isn't that wonderful isn't it beautiful let's stand together
