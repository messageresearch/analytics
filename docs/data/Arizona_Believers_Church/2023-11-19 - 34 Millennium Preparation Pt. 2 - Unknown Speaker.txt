TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I want to continue on the thought of Millennium preparation and in doing so I put just pause just for a few uh just for this service on this subject of Kingdom Builders that we've been on for a couple services we' ministered on Millennium preparation on Wednesday night a couple weeks ago and I wanted to kind of wrap up a thought on this it still ties into the overall theme that we've been ministering on on the kingdom and in the in the very beginning we were looking at how there was a mystery of Heaven that is actually going to be manifested in the earth and that manifestation of the mystery is the earth glory and the Earth had a purpose and over the last several Services we've been using uh brother bram's thought in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride and how that there was a this emphasis on the Plan of Redemption said if there's I could just get one thing over to you if you could just catch one thing in this service I want it to be the Plan of Redemption and he was identifying this three three-stage process of redemption of our souls and how that that God did a similar process to the earth the earth having not a soul but still Redemption for it there was a three-stage process of redemption for the Earth and we've been building off of that looking at how that though this uh stages of redemption are in threes and we have a three-stage process of redemption for our souls that it manifests in such great ways you don't say well I'm saved a and and that's it you don't just say well I'm I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I'm a son or daughter of God and we say well that's just kind of it we have a nomination or we're we're new creatures and there's nothing that goes with it no it's just the beginning when you're filled with the Holy Ghost that's really the beginning because you've secured your Eternal salvation and you and you're now walking in the grace of God and so it's we've been looking at how that if this is what God does to the individual and this is what God does to the Earth think about all the things that layer on top of that and we've been identifying how that the whole Earth shall be full of the knowledge of God God and that's because of this process of redemption and so for ourselves too when we should desire to be full the fullness of God be in us and that we desire to be fully possessed by God and those are been some of the things that we've been using and using the Redemption of the earth to show a type of the work of the holy spirit in us now so if you just look at verse six with me where we just read I hope you have the right slideshow there I thought I'd um change the title slide that's a good sign that we have that scripture I could have just accidentally sent the long slideshow but it looks like we've got it right so here in Revelations chap 20: 6 we're looking at the Millennium so I want to do some summary very quickly on this Thousand Years blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years this is the millennial reign of Christ and his bride the king and queen we call it the Millennium and we call things Millennial because it's a Thousand-Year Reign and there's a difference in this rign and the Eternal Reign so in eternity if we want to put it that way the eighth day that's the future home brother Brandman ministers about that's the perfect Eden it's a perfect Kingdom it's a perfect age yet the millennial Reign is not the eighth day but still the seventh day it is a restored Eden it is the honeymoon as brother B calls it of the of the Bride In Christ it's a rest but it's still in time it's not eternity yet it still has time and we know that there's still sin that exist um to be dealt with after the Millennium and so it's not eternity we've been looking at that this Millennial Reign this seventh day is not eternity and brother BR makes this statement about it there you are there's the paradise of God the light of the world the perfect Kingdom he's talking about the future home not the seventh day the Eternal one not the Millennium he says the new Earth right while it's going through the Millennium it's going through its sanctifying process but still must be burned that's quite a statement he's saying it still must be completely all sin annihilated and there must become this melting and this bringing forth of new Heaven and new earth and he identifies that very particularly uh right before we see in Revelations 21 the new heaven uh the New Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven from God and even this new city being established upon Earth brother bram's just showing you that what we're looking at in the future hes The Eighth Day not the Millennium and he calls the Millennium a sanctifying process it's still going through its sanctifying process but there's still another uh transition that needs to take place so this reign of righteousness and peace that we look at in the Millennium is not eternity it's not after that final renovation of Heaven and Earth for the last time it's not after the all the atmospheres are burnt up and the brother said the whole surface has changed it's still uh it's still before that right and when we look been looking at that we've been looking at how that there's uh the whole Earth shall be full of the knowledge of God it shall be full of the light of God this takes place before the Earth's final stage of redemption and the Earth not having a soul we wanting you to think of it this way that in the three-stage process of redemption that renovation of the earth is a type of our body change because it's going to receive a new body everything's completely change the surface is going to be changed so we're wanting you to think about how once your soul is redeemed there's still this process of redemption taking place in our lives where we can see the reign of righteousness in our lives we can see a reign of peace in our lives and we can enter into rest as Believers because it takes place before uh the change of our body even and we so we're wanting to identify this parallel of the reign of Christ even in the Millennium and his reain in Us in the bride before the change of our bodies now as brother B says that the Earth is going through a sanctifying process and it still must be burned I want to uh turn to Malachi chapter 4 and I want to read uh a few places with some lengthy script scripture readings today not that we'll break it down uh in great detail but so we can enter it into the record record and you can see uh some principles that we believe and kind of hopefully place them chronologically in a way that makes uh sense and use to us in Malachi chapter 4 we'll go ahead and read the whole thing for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven it's the day that comes that shall burn the day shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble so they're going to be reduced down they're going to be burnt up as you would think of a field uh something being burned up and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch so there's something being eradicated through this but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the star what a contrast in those that are being burnt down to nothing but then there's a son of righteousness that's going to be revealed and he has healing in his wings and you're going to grow up he says and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts that's quite an image the th those who have received this son of righteousness are going to walk out and the wicked's ashes are going to be under their feet says remember ye the law of Moses my servant this is very connected these first few verses now rest upon these next few verses remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in horb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments it's Commandment that he would send a Prophet behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and this Dreadful day it's speaking of is this day that cometh that shall burn as an oven and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse and we covered this on a little bit it may have actually been in different series early this year on how the Earth had a purpose and the Earth's purpose brother man said was to get a bride out of it and so God creation was for the purpose of God expressing his attributes to his bride so the very purpose of the earth is for God to be expressed and to bring forth the bride and it says the very last words of the Old Testament is the Spectre of the Earth being condemned and laid waste and destroyed because says I I I I'm going to come and smite the Earth with the curse and as we use the example of Jesus cursing the Fig Tree because it hadn't produced a fig so the Earth if it doesn't produce a bride it has not served God's purpose so he's going to curse it so Elijah comes and Elijah's Ministry introduces the living bread of life which brings forth the bride and the bride having come forth the Earth can say ah we did it we satisfied our purpose and the Earth having served its purpose there's a Plan of Redemption for it and so the bride raises up as the glory of the earth and the Mystery of Heaven revealed and God will not Smite the Earth with a curse because he sent Elijah the prophet that accelerates these things and brings forth the bride so that's the that's the end of that chapter but now that they've come forth and as they're coming forth and they're coming back to the earth when they come back to the Earth it says they're walking on the ashes of the wicked brother Bradman the sermon trying to do God a service without being the will of God he brings a couple scriptures together he says remember Sodom burned well this world is to burn Jesus said so and it'll be a time like Luke 17 chapter 30th verse in the days it'll be like Sodom and Gomorrah then the son of man would be revealed and in that day God reigned fire and brimstone out of heaven and destroyed them all and destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah so there was a judgment there was a burning that took place upon the wicked who had not escaped and he says and then and then what would happen according to Malachi he will burn the Earth again and the righteous in the Millennium will walk out upon the ashes of the wicked and see where brother bam is placed in this he's saying that after the bride is raptured and tribulation is set in that there's going before the bride returns back there's some burning that takes place and once that burning has is over the bride's going to return back and it's using it in symbolic ways and I don't know that we need to be very very literal uh that you're going to be going oh you know that we you know I've got all these ashes but it's it's showing that they're going to be reduced there's going to be a reduction there's going to be a burning up and the bride's going to return after that time for the millennium now now we have all these different burnings right and say well I know the E day and but we're just going to try to place these in an order so you can see that when God does something uh God will do something in one place and he'll do it in another place and it's very important that we not conflate the two there is a first coming a second coming and a third coming we want to make sure that we got those in the right order right some are still looking for his first coming right the Jews would be but we know that one's already happening some people are looking for his third coming coming uh thinking it's going to be the second and we know brother cors that order and so we're looking at different instances where the Earth is even renovated and we're and we're even seeing in the scripture that it can be a new Earth but yet it doesn't mean it's totally annihilated and yet there could be another season where it's changed again and here we see in the scripture that the righteous are going to walk out on the ashes of the wicked is the way we kind of summarize that and brother says that's in the Millennium after their Earth has been burned now if you'll turn to Revelations chap 6 let's read verses 12 12 to 17 and I'm hoping that I could just bring this straight through the message of the hour so you'll know what brother brand I'm taught on this I think that's what's important is you that you know what he taught I it's and I I mean it's not important that you know what I think about it or my opinion on it it's most important that you know what brother Bram taught about it and that the Holy Spirit would Quicken that to you I I take a lot of comfort in just teaching to you what the messenger says and I don't feel like this burden to try to clear it up for you and try to make perfect sense of it I think when people do that they end up uh they end up leaning too far to one side and causing more confusion and so if I could just show you what brother bradam said we'll be in a good place so now in Revelations 6: 12-1 17 and beheld be I and I beheld when he had opened the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great earthquake just notice kind of these symbolic descriptions Revelation the book of symbols is now showing us these different events that have um some interpretation to them they have some ual coming to pass there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell under the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind so notice it's using these elements of nature in the earth and the heavens and the Earth and uh creation showing uh this Interruption of Nature and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is when it's rolled together and the Heaven and the the and every mountain and Island were moved out of their place say this is quite a a renovation quite a change a shaking and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the Lamb so this is a this is a judgment being poured out this is a this is uh like a burning of Sodom and gomorah this is like it was in the days of Noah when the floods covered the Earth this is Judgment upon those upon the Earth for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand that's quite quite a scripture uh that tells us of the events that transpire these things that we see once that Sixth Seal is opened now in the seventh seal brother brandham says this he says notice there's a the whole earth is to be purged there'll be such a thing that the Moons and stars and all nature will be purged and this l anguage he's using to be is important you see what it is the Earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium the millennium's coming up and see everything that's got any filth in it to be purged during The Sixth Seal now do you notice on the open of the seventh seal it's also in a three-fold mystery this is brother I'm identify that when The Sixth Seal is opened he said there's this purging as the Bible says that a great earthquake and the Sun is black as sackcloth and the moon becomes as blood and the Fig as a fig tree uh casts its untimely figs because of the wind the stars of the heaven are going to fall uh the heavens depart the mountain and Island are moved and all these descriptions men trying to hide himself this day of Wrath brother calls it a purging time something he says here that I think is very important he says the Earth is renewing herself getting ready for the Millennium there's this time before the Millennium sets in there's this renewal that's taking place in the earth and and he's saying this is uh this is tied to these this description in The Sixth Seal in the Third Exodus he says now I want you to notice and I'm reading from several places again because I think it's important to see that it's not just one place where he says it but he says it enough times and there's a little bit there's enough material there that we can work with where the Lord can Quicken something to you or you can have some idea of what brother bram's saying in the third exod he says I want you to notice this same pillar fire is leading the people again to a promised land in the Millennium where we found under the inspiration of this six sucal it's never been taught before how the Earth has to be purified for the Millennium the pillar of fires leading them to lead leading them to a millennium now that this is quite a a a statement that the Earth has to be purified for the Millennium I say it's quite a statement it just it's showing that makes sense right that must be some purification that takes place uh could you just imagine uh coming back to Earth and having to uh and knowing that there's still a a Sin City in in Nevada Nevada Nevada however you say it we know that these things are going to be completely changed Going to there's going to be something that is going to be cleaned up and purified this Millennial cleansing this cleansing for the Millennium the Earth has to be purified for the Millennium so the pillar fire is leading the people to the promised land and God before we would come to this promised land and before we'd come back to the Earth there's a purging he's using this term purging a purifying of the Earth for us to to come back to in the Millennium this isn't the eighth day this is before that time because there's still going to be things that transpire for the Thousand Years things that take place even before that 8 day uh that 8 days that's the totality finality there will never be anything anymore uh to interrupt in the sermon conferences you'll notice that these dates are all very close together here in 63 says there is no more hopes we can't build nothing all the nations have Atomic hydrant poison bombs astronauts and everything Lord the whole world is quivering and shaking it's going to be purified pretty soon and get ready for a great Millennium talk about the Earth she's going to shake to pieces she's tottering now like a drunk man staggering home at midnight in the darkness she don't know where she's going the Earth is quivering shaking there's going to be things that are going to take place and transform says she's going to be purified pretty soon to get ready for that thousand years and the sermon Victory Day says when she comes to the battle of armag eddon that'll settle the whole thing just before the great Millennium Armageddon is to clean off the earth now that's gives maybe a little bit more detail to it just before the great Millennium Armageddon to clean off the Earth she rep purifies herself with this Atomic blowing and the volcanic ash and things s things sinks this soaked blood of men and upon the Earth and sin and crime she sinks beneath the earth and the volcanic braids out again and renews and cleans the Earth for the great Millennium why what a what a what a description there's going to be a millennium and she re the Earth rep purifies herself and and I think that there's there's a description here we just can get this concept that well it's going to happen some way and he says this Atomic blowing and then he says volcanic ash and and so there could be these atomic bombs could break up things and Vol volcanoes could explode and and things take place upon the Earth Earth and all these seismic conditions and circumstances to where the earth now through this these atomic bombs and these fracturing of things and these bursting forth of geysers and volcanoes and things exploding uh that things completely turn over and change and he calls it a rep purifying and then the world has fallen apart he takes his text from Revelations chapter 6 when he preaches the world is falling apart and he says how many sins were committed in this city last night wasn't it better when the coyote howed down through the desert here and God looked upon it when the old hop and Navajo went through here on his trellis then look at this filth and just gum and traditions and politics so we think we've improved it he say no we've made it worse he said it's bleeding nasty mess that stinks in God's nose corrupted before him he'll blow it to Pieces some of these days and he'll burst forth the Earth and she'll she will renew herself with volcanic eruption and they'll come a millennium then are you catching kind of the order because I can even remember that um there was a question uh asked uh when we were ministering on the future home and how this total Annihilation brother Brandman the future home makes it very very clear that there's going to be some renovation of the earth and the new Heaven and new earth is not a doing away of the old word that just explodes into Oblivion and it's not there and then God creates again he said no it's a transformation or regeneration of the earth that was and the heavens that were and how that there's going to be a burning in a melting Pro in Prophecy and the question was well I thought that took place before the Millennium and it's because there is a process that takes place before the Millennium and we're looking at here another another change that takes place and he says and they come there'll come a millennium where the righteous will walk out upon the ashes of the wicked according now Malachi so brother Brandon when he's talking about that day that when the scripture says a day will come that shall burn as an oven there's going to be Volcan canic Ash and explosions and a burning and something take place here upon the Earth to rep purify it to purge it to cleanse it to renew it for the Millennium he's placing this the time of Malachi 4 and the sermon look he says Noah had an experience of this he's looking at that renewing of the earth he says he by faith saw the coming of the flood a great rain that was going to cover the Earth and wash off the Earth the rededication again to God quite a statement the filth of the world that the people had got in in that conglomeration that they were in in that day had to all be washed off to start again so again we can use the days of Noah as an example of how that God wiped off the Earth and the Earth came forth as new and that was because the the things that had been added to it and all the sin and all the unrighteous had been wiped off so it emerged A New Earth as the Bible even suggest and he says and so now it's going to be washed off again is what he's pointing to and I just finished the series of services on the last Seven Seals and find in The Sixth Seal that there's a great interruption in nature the moon the stars the Earth belches forth the church is purged Israel is purged and everything is purged is under that seventh seal so that the Millennium can start in we know as we read it in the Sixth Seal he says it's purged under that seventh seal there's certainly a type to that as we see as he's identifying here he says so that the Millennium can start in there has to be a cleansing first are you keeping some of these thoughts in mind rep purifying renewing cleansing purging these things he says there has to be a cleansing first and that's what the church today and what I want to point to you that we need a cleansing before anything can begin from God we got to have a purging and we look and see things that is now under the present conditions exist in the way they are we can see that we've got to have something to happen before God can continue his program and a purging quite a statement and the quieter statements becoming the statement for today I guess we could see that we've got to have something to happen before God can continue his program and a purging hopefully you've been writing all these quite a statements down to see this pattern as he showing the Earth is to be purged uh it's going to uh the filth is going to be purged out of it there's going to be purified he says it's renewing herself and and and there's a rep purifying washing off a rededication and then he says the church needs it the Earth is going to experience it then he says we've got to have something we need we need to have something happen and as you're reading this we know that God is going to do it but the according to the scriptures that we've been reading it's the wrath of God upon the the the Earth and wickedness and there's a purifying but notice how it's coming from within the Earth and there's these volcanic eruptions and God is using these things within the Earth and within things that have already been created and brother man keeps saying she will rep purify herself she'll renew herself saying it's about the Earth so in Revelations chap 19: 7 and 8 I you'll know where I'm going with this I'm sure let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and the marriage takes place here and his wife hath made herself ready let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready what did she make herself ready with and to her was granted that she should be array in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of his Saints brother I said his word or his righteousness but it's granted to her we don't come up with it our own we don't we don't find it on our own but we receive Revelation that we then dress ourselves in and we have been given the word of God that we have a responsibility over you have the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word therefore the bride has been granted has been given the privilege and opportunity and the power to make herself ready the bride is granted she's furnished the Necessities she's been appointed she's been anointed she's been commissioned amen she has the Revelation to prepare herself amen even as we saw it in the Garden of Eden that that God must have given the first instinct of man was to dress himself and he doesn't fig leaves but then God gives them the Revelation to dress themselves in the the the bloody lamb and they dress themselves in the bleeding bloody lamb and so we are then brother says you as a member of this bride you've got to make yourself [Music] ready and then if the earth now if we see this en Ty the Earth purifies herself the Earth renews herself before the Millennium she's doing this now before the Millennium then the bride under her seventh seal is being purified and Washed by the word of God we're looking at this in type how that that these things happen in the Redemption of the Earth in these stages of the Earth if we can catch this Plan of Redemption and see this great deep truth from God then we see that there is a Plan of Redemption for my soul and having been redeemed there's this process that begins to work itself out as it will for the Earth so will it be for me and the Earth purifies yourself under that six seal for that Millennial reign of righteousness therefore I believe with the king of righteousness reigning in my soul that I can be purged purged and purified by the word of God cuz the bride hath made herself ready in Revelations CH 21 verse two and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared when it says the bride hath made herself ready that is prepared say saying prepared as a bride adorned or made ready for her husband when John sees this city prepared as the bride adorned for her husband we ought to come back to this other verse to see that the bride makes herself ready with the thing she's been provided with that as we read this this holy city this New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven if we could continue to read Revelations 21 this Perfection this perfect Kingdom This Day Without End the city where the lamb is the light no evil no wickedness shall ever enter there it's Perfection Beyond Perfection brother Braham says in things that are to be it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God yes sir which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins sir this perfect word of God which is the Waters of separations the blood of Jesus Christ think of it dripping bloody word the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride inen amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated how through the word which washes us through the word that separates us the thing that separates out wickedness separates out unrighteousness separates out anything that's not pure how are we going to get there through the word of God he calls it the bleeding word the blood the word of God the bleeding blood to wash the bride in we are being dressed in the bleeding word what ises it doing it's purifying it's purging it's cleansing it's sanctifying prepare as a bride Adorn for her husband how does a bride Adorn herself for her husband she makes herself ready the Earth renews itself the Earth purifies itself for the Millennium here we are than as the bride renewing oursel purging ourselves with the word of God in first John chapter 3: 2 and 3 says beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now when you see him as he is that has an impact on you he says we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is so whatever you see him as you become see him as a Healer when you see it you're healed when you see him as a savior you're saved there there's something to seeing him as he is that has this reverberation impact on us so I want to see him I want to see him in his glory I want to see him his love I want to see him in his forgiveness amen so he says this that and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure now there's your there's your image Christ in you and you're going to be like him so he saying any man that hath his hope purifies himself he sanctifies himself he submits himself he sacrifices himself he prepares himself as a Living Sacrifice he's committed I want to purify myself I want to wash myself I want to be clean if I'm going to be like him I want to purify myself I want to bring this body under subjection I want to make sacrifices I want to make the right decisions every man that have this hope purifies himself we don't want to just trudge along say oh one day I'm going to be changed and we never make a decision to serve God greater we never make a decision to apply the token to our home we're just waiting for some day of redemption well one day brother bram's going to come back and everything's going to be fixed and so it doesn't matter how we live now how we raise our children now how we apply the token to our home how Sanctified we want to live how faithful we can be to church we just think one day a man's going to come back and fix it all and that's a lie of the devil because God has given his bride the tools she needs now to purify herself for meeting in the air in the sermon this sudden secret going away of the church now I love how he just brings all these elements together and this is going to get real practical here for a little bit he says because brother bram's going to make the specific points and I'm using this as a type to where we are now before the change of our body before the Millennium what we can be looking for God to do in our lives right now God does work through the pastor to get his church ready he works through the songs to get his church ready and he works through you to get his church ready now I I this is good stuff if your pastor would fail and continually to fail you'd hunt you another Pastor quickly you would do that if your choir didn't sing right or your solo wasn't right you'd say to the director the one who has the music don't let them sing no more they just make me nervous to sing now now think about it it's true right at least we have those thoughts I mean if your pastor fails continually and you think man we just need to get a new pastor and quick kind of identif the choir don't sing right this is kind of human act if things aren't right we just replace them fix it don't ever let them do that again right I mean this is this is the way now he says but what about you as an individual how do you fail in your daily living how do you tally up with God what God says for you to be a shining light that sits on a hill no one could pass around your way without knowing about Jesus what type of Life do you live I do not believe in any way this should excuse uh accountability to the pastor accountability to this leading of songs accountability in the church I don't think he's just trying to say well it doesn't matter what happens at church but he's saying you know what how about asking yourself the same standard you're holding for the choir leader the same standard you're holding for the teacher the same standard you're holding for everybody else what about you and your responsibility the pastor has a responsibility to bring the word and he's failing constantly and you judgeing for that you have a responsibility and your individual life to apply the token to your home and you have the responsibility to guide your family in truth to love your wives to respect your husbands that we have a responsibility in daily living do you hold the same standard in your daily life that you would to somebody in their Church Life what type of Life do you live one of those types that's mean and insulting and aggravating indifferent or I'd love to ask him so really tell me who are you thinking about I know it's 1958 I probably didn't know him but was it the neighbor in the apartment next door you know who was it you were going after there one of those types that's mean and insulting and aggravating indifferent or can you speak of the peace and the love that you found in Christ am she has made herself ready amen that's the scripture he's amplifying the scripture he's amplifying this does God work through the pastor does he work through the song leader does he work through the church yeah but he works through youen and how is he working through you to get the church ready the bride hath made herself ready to where now I begin to identify any meanness anything insulting aggravating indifferent I'm looking at my own individual life I'm saying I've got things that I need to be addressed in my own life and I need to be addressing these things I should not be excusing them I should not be rationalizing with them I do not want to be condemned or defeated by them but I want to look at them saying Oh God by your grace may I overcome this oh God May by your grace may I change from this man that I've been may I change from this woman I've been oh I've got this family history I've got this relationship history I've got this way our family's been for years but oh God I don't want it to stay this way forever I don't want to be a mean husband I don't want to be an impatient absent father God I want to change I know you can change me that's Gooden she ha made herself ready in the sermon the marriage of the Lamb he says if you know notice it said she has made herself ready so many says I know you couldn't guess this but this is quite a statement if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you you got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome this is something we've really want been wanting to impress upon you you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready there's things maybe we're holding there's things that we're committing there's things that we're thinking about there's things we're doing and maybe we we we just say oh well Lord if if you don't want me to do you see take it away from me Lord if it's not right for me to be doing this then you just need to take the desire way and and and and maybe there may be some things where the Lord knows your heart and says that's the most hypocritical thing you've ever said to me because you know you're holding on to it you know you can lay it down you just got a lying Spirit on you that's trying to convince you that well if God doesn't want me to do this then and what is it we usually do right somebody's holding their their their Run DMC compilation CDs right and they're over here saying well you know what all these other people listen to their Christmas music so what's wrong with Run DMC and I'm thinking in equivocation there's a point there but let's be honest with ourselves right what is it that we hold on to and he says you got you got you must be willing to lay it down she's made herself ready I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through catch this but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to God through the decisions we make the sacrifices we make the choices we make the things that we abstain from the things that we commit to do the burdens we pick up the things that we lay down it shows our faith and respect to God and what is it it's not you saving yourself it's you purifying yourself you as the Bride of Jesus Christ makinging yourself ready somebody want to attach a label of closed line religion or legal legalism or Works to Salvation no that's a scarecrow trying to keep you from stepping into your God ordained promises and it's a scarecrow keeping you from walking in the full joy and peace and satisfaction you can't as a Believer cuz you're holding on to a bunch of baggage and justifying it because you think it's legalism or some oldfashioned gospel but it's nothing but the truth and the plan of God to bring you to righteousness hallelujah it's a plan of God a program of God brother BR makes the statement do I have the statement there in Satan's Eden didn't know if I was going to put that I just this is what I was coming to are you sick and tired of Satan's kingdom well are you do you believe it's coming to the Millennium under his Millennium his to his Eden am are you looking forward to that are you sick of this one are you sick of Satan in his kingdom this Kingdom out there that bombards us daily this Kingdom that just seems to be accelerated and grow are you sick of it think of that this Earth is going to bounch forth and pure Purge and purify and burn up all these elements of Satan's kingdom one day for the Millennium and and that and that this Earth then is going to have some sort of Revenge upon it and it's going to purify itself and renew itself I want you to start having a little bit of a pep rally in your soul today to think if the Earth is going to have it within itself to one day exact revenge on this Kingdom that Satan's been building on earth the Lord I want you to start doing it in me right now the sermon he that is in you that phrase ought to have some substance here he that is in you so when the lion was first created he was a friend of man it's the devil that makes him do that that's right in the M the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat straw like the bulock and shall lay down with the bulock they'll not hurt or destroy in the Millennium the devil will be gone it's the devil that makes wild beasts tear and rip and eat and things like that the way they do it's the devil that's done this the reason why we find ourselves in this Satan's Eden is because the devil came we find him in the Bible telling us he's there in the Garden of Eden and it's what's produced his Eden it's what's produced this Satan's kingdom but now brother says the devil will be gone during that Millennial time right and because the devil's gone it's one of the elements the devil being gone the Lion's not trying to eat the man they'll not hurt or destroy in that Millennium so as we read in Revelations chap 20 and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the kid of the bottomless pit and a great in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years so now he's bound this Angel comes down out of heaven with a key Satan is bound this symbolic binding and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him so this is how he is going to be restrained and held back that he should receive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled so it tells us that there is a binding of Satan and he's held away as it were at a bottomless pit that's been sealed and he's been shut up and he's bound chained up and he is and the seal that's set upon him through this circumstance he can't deceive anymore says he can't deceive the Nations now this is a a great statement so it's because of this binding and because of these circumstances he's not allowed and not able to deceive Nations anymore that that's different and distinct from the reason why he can't deceive you and I'll just let you think about that and after that he must be loosed a little season that's why you have again uh uh this more Warfare and more deceiving after the Millennium and they still sin after the Millennium because guess what the devil's loosed now he begins to work through these subjects and begins to have this influence and it's this great climactic destruction and judgment and we go into the eighth day now brother brandom I'll try to do this man I thought I was going to be like two hours long I haven't I'm not going to be an hour today we can go feed this other bottomless pit now if I could I just want to identify some things that brother banam says about this about this binding of Satan in question and answers he says Jesus the church the bride was raptured went up to glory and was up there and was married returned back to the Earth and lived a thousand years at the end of the thousand years and just want you to catch the language that brother B using to describe you you can see these order of events too Satan was loosed out of his prison that is Bound By An Angel with a chain not a log chain but a chain of circumstance he says all of his subjects were in hell all that was resurrected on the earth were redeemed in Jesus with them he couldn't work on nothing but at the end of the Thousand Years second Resurrection blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection over which the second death has no power now notice in the second Resurrection when they come up then Satan's loed out of his prison for a little season then the judgment is set when he says Jesus with the bride as king and queens set on the throne white Throne judgment the books were open the books of Sinners of the Sinners so we can see that brother said he's Bound by a chain he calls of circumstances and he says he doesn't have anyone to work through says it again in a couple other questions and answers later we later he says and so it's that Sabbath day when the church will no more labor against sin and Satan is Bound for a little season a thousand years because his subjects are all in Hell the church that on Earth is redeemed right in the presence of Christ so he has nothing he can work on so it's not a chain as I said a long chain it's a chain of circumstance he has nothing he can do he's helpless and hopeless just waiting for the resurrection of the subjects then they separated is the sheep from goats so there's this this Millennial condition in part has something to do with the fact that there's a chain on Satan and he can't work through anybody he wants to but he just can't that he says there's no subjects to work through so this if he's just going around he's tempting if you could just even use the language that brother Bam's using to kind of describe he saying he doesn't have anyone that he can work through so it he says it's not like a log chain where the devil's just over there with the straight jacket just trying to get out of a bottomless pit but you could even go so far as to say Satan's still around in some way but he just can't get into anybody he's still tries to tempt babbe and this is just me H H uh embellishing it it's it's not that he's wrapped up with the L chain he has no one to work through how many times I keep saying this before it Dawns on you wait a minute hold on there's a type that in the Millennium there's no sin in the Millennium and there's no labor against sin because he has no one to work through and then we realize that Paul says let not sin re therefore in your mortal body and there's a language in the word of God that's tell us that it has no more dominion over me the sin the World the Flesh the devil has no more power over me no more dominion over me then I don't want to give it anything to work through good and the sermon we preach the futur is now what was that uh place that brother bam came to when he gets there cuz Satan's bound here he is he's saying he's bound the scripture says he's bound a thousand years and then he's loosed from his prison after that thousand years you have been given power to bind him the worst or any you have been given power to bind him the worst or any whatever it is that binds him for a thousand years and keeps him away that you do not labor to sin that power is in the church now that power to bind him is in you now you've been given power to bind him the worst are any so he said to Peter I give unto you the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on the Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven remember how we read in second Peter how that word loose whatever you loose on Earth and loose in heaven it's the same word for passing away the Heaven and Earth shall pass away it's a releasing it's a setting free the whole earth is going to be loosed to the Glorious Liberty of the sons of God right the Bible's teaching us there's the loosing then where's The Binding there's going to be a renewal there's going to be a setting free there's going to be a purging as it were as brother says the bride hath made herself ready it's this purging for the Millennium it's this purifying for the Millennium and I just want you to see those two thoughts together now that there's going to be a Purge and a renewal the bride is going to make herself ready she's laying down things she's separated herself the bleeding bloody word she's dressing herself in it's the Waters of Separation this is the transformation this is the rededication this is the renewing yes the soul is saved but now having been saved and loosed now I have the materials I have the Revelation I have the resources to dress my spirit to dress my mind this renewing of my mind that's taking place in my body taking place in my life and as that's happening I'm also going to bind that Wicked one I'm going to bind unrighteousness I'm going to bind wickedness I'm going to bind I'm going to bind I'm going to bind I'm going to say no to the devil I'm going to say yes to the word I'm going to say no to the world I'm going to say no to the flesh I'm going to say no to sin there's a binding because you've got power to bind him amen and brother brandham says in the sermon the marriage of the Lamb or guess getting very very close to closing here he says so I think that's the way with preaching the gospel he says if it don't stir you up a little bit he says get your fill your spiritual gastronomics started right you got so many GI problems he says let's get your spiritual gastronomics started right and make you a little sick to examine yourself at the Bible this is what the preaching of the Gospel should do should make you it shouldn't plate you on and make you go well I guess it's okay that you know I fornicate because at least I've got the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit in the church service I mean I guess it's okay that I I I don't don't honor the word of God and how I keep my hair and how I dress and the jokes I tell and the things I watch because at least I feel good when I go to church he said no the preach of the word should make you sick to your stomach if you're not lining up with the word of God your spiritual gastronomics started right make you a little sick to examine yourself with the Bible see if that old temper and selfish selfishness ungodliness love of the world television you're like whatever that is love of the world television things that might leave this is what ought to do the preach of the word is still yet today to drive away things and we have to get sick to our stomach say oh I don't want to do that anymore I don't want to justify that anymore I don't want to be that way anymore this is what it ought to do this is the sermon the marriage of the Lamb notice what he's coming to what he's preaching on he says and the church sit empty and the pews sit empty see when you ought to be out there like Jesus you got his spirit in you trying to get everybody in the country to come to your church to receive Christ everybody in the country all right the door's open it's wide open everybody in the country he says this is what you ought to be doing and we call ourselves then the bride of Christ Oh What A pity friends the hour has come his bride has made herself ready oh made herself self ready she laid aside all of these things do you see what he's identifying that and he says you've got his spirit in you with his spirit in you then you're laying aside these things of temper selfishness ungodliness love of the world television and things you're laying aside those things you've got power to do it we're not sitting back say Lord if you don't want me to do it you're just going to have to take it away from me kind of like Lord if you if you don't want me to have this you just need to take it away from me you're going to have to do it go ahead take it that's then he said he's saying I'm not going to fight with you I'm not going to fight with you he's asked for it already he's waiting for you to give it to him is that the mark of maturity I opened up a men's meeting one year and I found two of the strongest guys I possibly could looking out these young men I said I want you boy you guys come in come up here two big guys and uh I'm not I'm not sure sure if maybe one of them was your brother brother ly and I said here take this ball and I gave it to him I said now and I told this other big strong Burly guy said now get this ball away from him just get it from him they they started fighting we're in the middle of a search start there're fighting fighting fighting one couldn't get away from the other and and have they're done fighting with it I said all right all hold on I'll show you how to get it I said mant please have the ball gu just handed it to me and and I think it was brother Jason W was like my like just shut it down we got what we need for the men's men I said that's what it means to be a real man didn't have to wrestle it away didn't have to fight over it you just ask for it and that's exactly what God's going to treat you like like mature Believers at some point he's not going to go in your life and rip this away and rip that away and rip that away and rip that away and completely upturn your life he's just going to say through the preach of the word give it to me he's going to find out how mature you are with the word of God when you say yes sir and you hand it over to him and you're willing to to give it to him cuz he's asked for it he's not going to baby you and rip it away from you and slap you on your head We've Come to an hour of maturity where God's word has been preached and he's saiding give me everything you are give me everything you are give me everything you are and we've got to come to a place I say Lord here I am here I am every part of me here I am Ren made herself ready she laid aside all of these things she laid it aside and then he made makes this statement my goodness maybe I could preach two hours remember Esther was chosen and the other was rejected now quite a statement and only those that's born again that's got the spirit of God will be the chosen that day that has the Crown of Glory will be set upon her head that the Crown of Glory will be set upon her head and the others will be rejected Esther Esther means star her original name was hadessa myrtle tree Earthbound rooted to the Earth changed from the Earth to the heavens from the dust to the Stars elevated from an orphan girl to a queen what a beautiful picture and he says that the bride hath made herself ready and when he says Esther was chosen others were rejected he's identifying something about Esther where she made herself ready and in Esther chapter 2 it says the turn of as each one of these uh maidens were being brought before the king they were to present themselves and it says when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abel the uncle of morai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what Hagi the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed she didn't say plus it wasn't the message plus it wasn't the word only and everything else she took the word that was given to her by the one the king appointed to dress her there had been a message given there had been a word given there was something that was given for her to dress herself in here dress in this and she required nothing but what had been given her she required nothing but would been her and she dressed herself in that which the king's servants had appointed her she added nothing else to it and the Bible says and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all of them that looked upon her so Esther was taken to King axis in the house Royal in the 10th month which is the month of Toth in the seventh year of his Reign and the King loved Esther above all the women and she obtain grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins why she made herself ready he said here's the message dress yourself in it yeah I I like that that that's that's really good brother bandam I like that now if we could just marry this to Pentecostalism if we could just marry this to Catholicism oh we got to be a good bapticostal let's just start bringing it all back in here and start adding all the other jewelry and adornments and everything else that all these other women thought oh here just dress yourself in the Simplicity of Christ I go well if I could I can I can wear that and if I just add a nice belt to it I just add a nice Tiara and they wanted to start adding all bunch of stuff to it but when the one walked in with what was appointed good who made herself ready he said he loved her above all the women obtained grace and favor so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of vashy here is this woman brother bam says there a type of the Bride making herself ready and she required nothing but what she was given amen you've been given so much you don't need anything more this message is perfect this word of God's perfect you don't need anything more just dress yourselves in it listen to it heed it I don't mind if you roll up your sleeves and get Dusty with it and wrestle with it if you got to wrestle it out well what does this mean and what does that mean what does it mean to apply the token what does it mean to stify myself what does it mean to do do do don't mind if you get Dusty with it but at least get concerned about it Bible says in Ephesians chapter 4 musicians you could come here Ephesians chapter 4: 22 to2 think about what Paul is saying here that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lust take it off you put it off quite a statement if you've been born again into new creatures already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and now he's saying put that off he's not he's not going to rip it off of you he's say youd put it off put off the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful us and be renewed in the spirit of your mind there is a renewing there is a rededication there's a purging there's a purifying right now just as the Earth is going to purify itself for the Millennium I want to purify myself I want to purge myself I want to rededicate myself I want to be renewed in the spirit of my mind my soul is sealed it couldn't be any more perfect but the spirit of my mind Wars it fights it struggles it doubts it gets nervous it gets worried it gets depressed it gets anxious I want to be renewed in the spirit of my mind I want to put off the old life I want to put off the old thoughts oh my and that you put on the new man do you see the image that's just been created the old Trinidad song I'm taking off the old man I'm putting on the new man I'm changing robes for another dimension I'm taking off the old man it's my responsibility I'm taking out the old man that's the part I got to do and I'm putting on because he says that you put off concerning the former conversation and that you put on the new man which after God has created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore put into away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for members of One Of Another You could continue to read all the other things that he says to do but there's a putting away and there's a putting on that's what we're doing right now as the Bride of Jesus Christ we're making ourselves ready we're renewing ourselves rededicating ourselves we're purging ourselves we're becoming more mature there was a time in your life that God just came and snatched that right out of your hand didn't he do it for you did it for for us that's why we're here today and now we've come to places in our lives where now he's just saying give it to me Hallelujah and we're over there just going well you're going to have to come and take it he's said no I'm not going to fight with you and he wants us to lay things down wants to take things up yes it's Millennial preparation yes amen it's purging I trust that there's something in your heart that makes you want to do that if we could bow our heads in [Music] prayer brother brandom at the end of this service of the marriage of the Lamb it's a really good one uh to take in on this [Music] subject as you just examine your heart I know there's things there's decision that some people need to make here in terms of a decision to serve Christ and there's things that hang on to us doubt and unbelief and we need just to surrender to the Lord and we need to ask for forgiveness we need to be baptized there's a repentance there's a Salvation that needs to come to us and that's that's on the table for any who have not been bornn again I want you to search your hearts find whether you be in the faith whether or not you've received Christ whether or not you've been born again because truly that's what matters and so I I I I speak that I want that to be in our hearts but then there's this other place that we're wanting to think of now we those of us who have his spirit inside of us what are we doing with it now are we letting it to continue are we are using the power that he's given us to root out things to purge to heue Down Bam says now the marriage of the Lamb has come and the Bride made herself ready he says father they are yours they're trophies of your word they're here to be Washed by the Water of the word because it's the Full Gospel he says it's not sparing anything it's cut down to get down to the kindergarten place it's grubbing out the Roots the Roots of bitterness the roots of indifference the roots of the world he says grub them out Lord by the Holy Spirit cast them away away from the people I don't know what it is that the Holy Spirit may need to do in your life today but I say grub it out root it out whatever it is that it might be maybe we do need the Holy Spirit to come in and root some things out but maybe there's some things you can give to him today some things he's asked for you can say Lord here it is I give it to you Lord whatever you've asked for I give is that in anyone's Hearts today would there be one that would want stand and say Lord here I am I just give myself to you today it's what you've asked for anyways
