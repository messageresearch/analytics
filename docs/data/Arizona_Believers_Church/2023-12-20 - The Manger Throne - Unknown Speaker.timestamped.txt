[0:00] you may recall that this was a scripture
[0:02] that we took when we began the series on
[0:03] hate and we we're taking a thought um on
[0:07] the peace of God and those different
[0:09] characteristics of the kingdom and how
[0:11] he would be the prince of peace and in
[0:14] his government there would be no end to
[0:16] the peace because he'd order it and
[0:17] establish it there'd be righteousness
[0:19] and judgment so I'm revisiting this now
[0:21] just before Christmas comes and and with
[0:24] all the celebrations and all the things
[0:26] that we're meditating on and things that
[0:28] we're celebrating I want this to
[0:30] resonate in your hearts a little bit
[0:31] just to bring something before us to
[0:33] orient us to just the significance of
[0:36] the birth of Christ which I don't think
[0:37] is lost on us but I wanted to start with
[0:40] this statement from the sermon what
[0:41] think ye of Christ and brother Bram is
[0:44] asking the question what do you think
[0:46] and what are your thoughts about Christ
[0:48] and what is it that uh comes to mind
[0:50] when you consider certain things and he
[0:52] makes this statement today if the people
[0:54] would only regard the name of Jesus that
[0:56] was left in the church he said what
[0:59] whatever ever you ask the father in my
[1:01] name that will I do he gave the church
[1:04] his name to marry bury baptize
[1:06] everything in the world that we do
[1:08] whatever you do in word and deed do it
[1:10] all in the name of Jesus Christ so
[1:12] there's something about that name
[1:13] there's a significance to it though we
[1:15] could constantly sound it out and say it
[1:17] and we hear it all the time and we even
[1:19] know the name is given in such a ways to
[1:21] where we it's just not maybe as
[1:23] significant as we might think it is or
[1:26] it's just lost its significance he says
[1:28] but we lost the sacred
[1:30] of that name now he says we says we lost
[1:34] the sacredness of that name we use it in
[1:36] vain in jokes you can't put bitter and
[1:38] sweet water out of the same Fountain
[1:40] friend now this is a challenge as he
[1:42] says this we've lost the sacredness of
[1:45] the name Jesus we was this name was
[1:48] given to to Mary to baptize even to bury
[1:51] and everything we would do in word and
[1:52] deed do it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:54] Christ he says we've lost the sacredness
[1:56] of it he says you've got to get to a
[1:58] place to you reverent that name and
[2:00] believe it and know it and use it just
[2:03] exactly right so to those who've lost
[2:06] the sacredness of the name of Jesus
[2:08] Christ you've got to get to a place
[2:10] where you reverence that name you
[2:12] believe it you know it and you use it
[2:15] use it the way that we ought to use it
[2:17] so this is a challenge About the Name of
[2:19] Jesus Christ and how that the sacredness
[2:21] of that name has been lost and how we've
[2:23] got to come back to a place of reverence
[2:26] and the question I pose is he says what
[2:29] think ye of Christ Christ I'm posing the
[2:31] question that has the birth of Christ
[2:34] lost its sacredness and I I know this is
[2:37] maybe a subject matter that we'd say
[2:39] well that's worthy of debate that's
[2:40] worthy of discussing and there's a lot
[2:42] that we could explore on this subject
[2:45] but it struck me and even this past week
[2:47] I was fellowshipping with a brother and
[2:48] we were talking about certain traditions
[2:50] and things and what they did as a family
[2:53] and in the midst of everything that
[2:54] takes place just what he does with his
[2:56] children uh uh to kind of bring uh
[2:59] Christ to to the center of everything
[3:01] and it struck me that as message
[3:03] Believers we all know that Christ Jesus
[3:06] Christ was not born on December 25th and
[3:09] to us it's not even a matter of it
[3:11] wasn't the 25th it was the 26th but we
[3:14] realize that it it was in a different
[3:16] time of year it was a different season
[3:18] under a different sign and it's
[3:19] something that we believe adamantly and
[3:21] something that uh has its place in
[3:23] scripture and has a significance and
[3:25] meaning to it and that he wasn't born
[3:27] around this time of year we recognize
[3:30] that Christians long ago begin to
[3:31] celebrate the birth of Christ around
[3:33] this time and it was after this date
[3:35] became sacred to Christians that they
[3:37] try to blend it with uh paganism and
[3:40] idolatry and to try to take away the
[3:42] sacredness of it and what I begin to
[3:44] recognize is that since we don't believe
[3:47] he was born at this time of year I
[3:49] wonder if it has diminished the value of
[3:52] what this time of year is supposed to be
[3:54] recognizing H we don't we don't believe
[3:56] that he was laying in a Manger this time
[3:58] of year we don't believe he was born on
[3:59] December 25th and because we don't
[4:01] believe that there's actually any kind
[4:03] of symmetry at all to the time of year
[4:05] to the actual birth of Christ that it's
[4:07] kind of we've lost sensitivity to the
[4:09] birth of Christ we don't have a time
[4:11] that we do celebrate it we don't have a
[4:13] time that we really do think about it
[4:14] like we do Easter people come to church
[4:16] on Easter they believe that this so many
[4:18] years ago around this time of year
[4:20] Christ resurrected but is it that
[4:22] because we know the truth it's
[4:25] diminished the value of the birth of
[4:27] Christ that many are acknowledging at
[4:29] this time it's just easy for us to go
[4:31] into the commercialism of of it and go
[4:34] into the stories and the other things
[4:35] and traditions built around it like well
[4:37] we know Christ wasn't born to where the
[4:39] only thing that does have our attention
[4:41] this time of year is the candy canes and
[4:44] the tinsil and the Christmas trees and
[4:45] the giftgiving and it it's lost the
[4:48] sacredness to where we could take some
[4:50] time to think about the fact that Christ
[4:52] was born and think about the fact that
[4:55] God sent him the way that he did in the
[4:57] time that he did in the place that he
[4:58] did in the things that he did and all
[5:00] the symbolism and all the everything
[5:02] that took place around it I believe it's
[5:03] important for us to consider it and so
[5:06] tonight with that in mind and hoping to
[5:08] bring uh some sacredness back to it and
[5:11] and reverence it a little bit I want to
[5:12] talk about the birth of Christ and I
[5:15] want to use this title the manger
[5:18] throne and and I at towards the end
[5:20] there and I think I have I towards the
[5:21] end I'll share with you a little bit of
[5:23] what inspired this H uh to use this
[5:26] title but we're looking at the birth of
[5:28] Christ
[5:30] and I want to ask you what do you see
[5:32] the picture that we have used here to
[5:34] represent this was painted by rimand and
[5:37] it's the Adoration of the Shepherds and
[5:39] it's it's depicting the scene of the
[5:41] Shepherds as they arrive to view the
[5:43] birth of Christ and I would ask what do
[5:45] you see and I'm inspired uh by Isaiah
[5:49] chapter 9:6 it's something I've just
[5:50] been thinking about over the last few
[5:52] weeks unto us a child and that was the
[5:54] phrase that just kept kind to me un us
[5:56] and it says a
[5:57] child and and and so just meditating on
[6:00] the child and this baby born and this
[6:02] infant that's coming and then all the
[6:03] other things that are quickly added to
[6:05] that event and what takes place I'm I'm
[6:07] inspired by that scripture in Isaiah 9
[6:10] unto us a child is born and then also by
[6:13] the poem What Child Is This the question
[6:17] that is asked in that what we know to be
[6:19] a song What Child Is This and we know
[6:21] the melody and the song I want to just
[6:22] bring some things out of that tonight in
[6:24] a way to BR to cause us to think more
[6:27] about what we see in the birth of Christ
[6:30] and what we're seeing even in this time
[6:31] of
[6:32] year now bringing up that uh poem in
[6:35] mind I bring to your attention a
[6:38] Christmas song I'm sure that we're all
[6:40] familiar with it's Do You Hear What I
[6:41] Hear and one of my favorite memes of all
[6:44] time was shared with me my by my good
[6:45] friend and brother-in-law Jonathan
[6:46] Martin he sent it to me and it showed
[6:48] two Cowboys around a campfire and it
[6:50] looked like they're cooking coffee or
[6:51] making dinner and the one Cowboy's
[6:52] looking up and he says do You Hear What
[6:54] I Hear the other Cowboy said no I Hear
[6:56] What I
[6:58] Hear and I think that's a really good
[7:01] point and maybe that's a good thing but
[7:05] the question is do do You Hear What I
[7:07] Hear It Was Written In N in October of
[7:10] 1962 so it's maybe not one of our old
[7:12] traditional hymns but this this this
[7:15] song opens with questions uh to the Lamb
[7:18] by the night wind so that's kind of the
[7:20] Poetry of it I said the night wind to
[7:22] the little lamb it's asking the question
[7:24] and the question it asks is do you see
[7:27] what I see the night wind is seeing
[7:30] something and and as it sees it it's
[7:31] Awakening the attention of the Lamb do
[7:33] you see what I see and as it begins to
[7:36] describe to the lamb what it sees it
[7:38] says a star with a tail as big as a kite
[7:41] and the Knight is waking up the lamb to
[7:43] say do you see what I see and then
[7:45] there's a Do You Hear What I Hear From
[7:47] The Lamb a voice so big a voice as big
[7:51] as the sea and it goes all the way down
[7:53] to where now as those signs kind of
[7:56] cascade together and piece together it's
[7:58] what do they see a child a child
[8:01] shivering in the night that's that's
[8:04] what ultimately it's from what do do you
[8:06] see what I see Do You Hear What I Hear
[8:08] to now they they recognize it's a child
[8:11] shivering in the night and it's this is
[8:14] a a a a song that is written about kind
[8:17] of including different scenes and it
[8:18] brings in the Shepherds of Luke Chapter
[8:21] 2 so if we could turn there I'm going to
[8:23] read from verse 8 to verse 35 this is
[8:26] going to form the backbone of the
[8:27] service tonight and and again we even
[8:30] read this at the start of this past
[8:31] series we were doing on on the subject
[8:33] of hate it said and there were in the
[8:35] same country shepherds abiding in the
[8:37] field now there's significance to that
[8:39] keeping watch over their flock by night
[8:42] there's just brother Brandon preaching
[8:43] this Su why had to be Shepherd and he's
[8:45] getting us to think why little Bethlehem
[8:47] he's asking us these questions around
[8:49] this time what think ye of Christ he
[8:52] speaks that in December of 1953 he asked
[8:55] us a lot of questions around the
[8:56] Christmas season and as I speak on the
[8:59] manger Throne again I'm asking you what
[9:01] do you
[9:02] see it says and lo the angel of the Lord
[9:05] Came Upon them now it's just a it would
[9:08] seem to be an ordinary night and doing
[9:10] ordinary things and they're uh watching
[9:13] there at the night time their flock and
[9:15] the angel of the Lord comes upon them
[9:17] and this would be kind of a as I just
[9:19] imagined a very startling occurrence
[9:21] because it says in the glory of the Lord
[9:22] sh R shown right about them now this
[9:24] would be something that would sensitize
[9:26] them to something Beyond themselves this
[9:28] would not be a normal Cur and it would
[9:30] kind of break up the monotony of the
[9:32] night and maybe around them there's a
[9:34] glory that's shining as the glory of the
[9:36] Lord shines around them there's
[9:37] something they see physically and their
[9:39] eyes their brains are processing these
[9:41] images and there's something glowing and
[9:43] lighting up the the the the atmosphere
[9:45] around them and they were soore afraid
[9:47] so it begins to strike them emotionally
[9:49] and the angel said un them fear not for
[9:52] behold I bring you good tidings of great
[9:54] joy this is that intense enthusiasm this
[9:57] excitement at the good news which shall
[9:58] be be to all people and now it says this
[10:02] for unto you and now this is kind of a
[10:06] promise to the Shepherds it's not just
[10:08] an announcement that something has
[10:09] happened but for unto you is Born This
[10:12] Day in the city of David that would
[10:14] pointed them to Bethlehem and it gives
[10:17] it that Royal ring to it if you just say
[10:19] Bethlehem we're not thinking of a Royal
[10:21] City but for him to say for the angel to
[10:23] say the city of David it's to cause him
[10:25] to think about the king and it says a
[10:27] savior unto you is born a savior in
[10:31] Bethlehem which is Christ the lord now
[10:34] this is a you can't even wave this
[10:36] sentence it's off the charts because
[10:38] unto you is born in the city of David a
[10:40] savior which is Christ the Lord that
[10:42] that statement and that phrasing to
[10:44] think and I'm just getting the
[10:45] Goosebumps now and thinking about it
[10:47] that these angels say this to this
[10:49] Shepherd and this is the announcement at
[10:51] his birth and it's the all the hopes of
[10:54] Israel was to hear that phrase the the
[10:56] thousands and thousands of people and
[10:58] years and hundreds hundreds of
[10:59] generations have been looking forward to
[11:00] hear unto you in the city of David a
[11:03] savior is born Christ the lord the
[11:06] Messiah the one that David wrote about
[11:08] the Lord sent unto my Lord this is the
[11:10] Lord the Messiah coming the anointed one
[11:12] unto you this day the Messiah is born
[11:14] what an
[11:17] announcement and it's you we can't put
[11:20] ourselves necessarily in the mind of
[11:21] these Shepherds not being Shepherds
[11:23] ourself not being a Jews not being that
[11:25] time and so maybe it's very difficult
[11:27] but if there's some way just to imagine
[11:29] just how much of a paradigm shift that
[11:30] would have been and what that might have
[11:32] begin to do and someone's heart to
[11:35] think I know this is the Lord this is
[11:37] Supernatural this is beyond myself and
[11:39] he's saying unto you I'm sending the
[11:41] Messiah to you today the Messiah is
[11:44] born it says and this shall be a sign
[11:46] which is a Wonder or token to unto you
[11:49] you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[11:52] swaddling clothes lying in the
[11:55] manger and the trajectory of this that
[11:57] goes from the ordinary
[11:59] of shepherds abiding in the field
[12:01] keeping that watch over the flock by
[12:03] night to this sudden fracture in the
[12:06] atmosphere to the angel Lord standing
[12:08] there and His glory shining round about
[12:10] them and their attention is captivated
[12:12] their emotions are stirred and they're
[12:14] afraid and they're told not to fear
[12:16] because you unto you is given the
[12:18] Messiah and this day in the seat of
[12:20] David a king has been bored and then
[12:23] with that with that image I'm hoping it
[12:25] can just strike you this way as it
[12:26] struck me I'm just so desirous that I'm
[12:29] able to deliver this burden adequately
[12:31] tonight says ye shall find a babe and
[12:33] it's almost as if the Grandeur has
[12:35] returned back to the normal yeah good
[12:39] and this announcement of a messiah and a
[12:41] king the city of David and the glory of
[12:42] the Lord and now as it has built itself
[12:44] to this climax it says and you're going
[12:46] to go and you're going to find a babe an
[12:48] infant a newborn wrapped in swaddling
[12:51] clothes which is something torn the word
[12:53] swaddle something rented and torn lying
[12:55] in a crib a
[12:57] Manger not in a
[13:00] Palace brother bam describes it in many
[13:02] different places and it's it's the only
[13:05] place I've really ever read this and
[13:06] haven't really gone gone searching for
[13:08] it but I think we've all kind of had
[13:09] this in our minds what that swaddling
[13:11] clothes is and brother bam says it quite
[13:12] often I've been told I've been told that
[13:14] I believe the tradition is he says a
[13:16] swaddling cloth we're told was off the
[13:18] Yol of an ox that they wrapped him in in
[13:21] the manger and he would describe it that
[13:23] this the the Yoke would rub upon the ox
[13:25] and it would cause it to bleed and to
[13:27] get blistered and cause very so they' R
[13:29] rip this cloth and they'd wrap it around
[13:31] the yolk and set it upon the ox so that
[13:33] would be what would be rubbing up
[13:34] against the O Ox it was the barrier
[13:36] between the burden and the the wound and
[13:39] so he takes something that may have been
[13:40] worn by an ox that was ripped apart
[13:42] maybe they took a part that didn't look
[13:43] as bad and say they wrapped the baby in
[13:47] that sometimes we get all scared and
[13:49] nervous about germs hey we're here think
[13:51] about everything that's existed
[13:53] throughout all centuries and all times
[13:55] and we've made it and that's so that's
[13:56] the reason why a lot of people are sick
[13:57] now is there's not enough germ terms our
[13:59] kids aren't eating enough
[14:01] dirt who sells Diet Tom matous Earth
[14:04] here it says he's wrapped in this
[14:06] swaddling cloth which was taken off an
[14:08] ox and brother B uses this language in
[14:11] this statement we're reading it he said
[14:12] we're told it was from the Yol of an ox
[14:14] in a stinking stable over the wastage in
[14:18] the
[14:18] stable can I admit something to you I
[14:21] don't know if we should stop the stream
[14:22] but when I read that I was like what's
[14:24] wage I need to Google what wage is I
[14:27] just wasn't reading it as
[14:29] wastage but he says in the stinking
[14:31] stable over the wastage in the stable
[14:34] stable I mean that's that should cause
[14:36] you to think oh that's that's foul and
[14:38] that the smells and those things he
[14:40] describes in quite a remarkable way in
[14:42] several different places and the stable
[14:43] is not even a correct stable because
[14:46] even the historians and many agree says
[14:48] it's a little cave in the side of a hill
[14:51] I just found just found some kind of
[14:53] Nook back in the cliff and enough room
[14:55] to put up enough barriers to call it a
[14:58] stable and use used it as some sort of
[14:59] ancillary Outpost it was even a
[15:01] correctly built stable it was maybe not
[15:04] an afterthought but it was the last
[15:05] resort and it's there in this place in
[15:08] the dead of the night that Christ the in
[15:11] the is born a savior Christ the lord and
[15:14] it's a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes
[15:17] lying in the
[15:19] manger and this and I I chose to insert
[15:23] that description there because he says
[15:25] you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[15:27] swaden clothes lining in a main
[15:29] the angel Lord's describing this scene
[15:31] of a stinking stable with the wastage
[15:34] and the stable everywhere and the
[15:36] swaddling clothes and what it ought to
[15:37] have uh what it actually was it's
[15:40] describing it that's what it looked like
[15:41] but then in verse 13 it says and
[15:43] suddenly there was with the angel a
[15:46] multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising
[15:48] God and saying glory to God in the
[15:51] highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[15:54] toward men now think of that uh that
[15:57] sudden shift once CE again from the
[15:59] monotony of the night keeping the Sheep
[16:01] to now the angel Lord the angel of the
[16:04] Lord standing there and you'll notice in
[16:05] a moment just what it meant to the
[16:06] Shepherds as they declare it and the
[16:08] glory of the Lord shine shining round
[16:10] about them and they hear this
[16:11] pronouncement unto you the savior is
[16:14] born in the city of David Christ the
[16:17] Messiah the Messiah Lord has been born
[16:19] unto you a babe wrapped in swaddling
[16:22] clothes lying in the manger and then
[16:24] suddenly again the sky is filled with
[16:27] the multitude of the Heavenly Host
[16:29] and we know we describe it as they were
[16:31] singing These anthems and it describes
[16:34] it as maybe a song but it just says
[16:36] they're saying and they're declaring
[16:37] glory to God in the highest and on Earth
[16:39] peace Good Will toward men and this is
[16:42] the announcement at the image of a
[16:45] newborn infant wrapped in swaddling
[16:48] clothes lying in a Manger in a little
[16:51] cave in the side of the hill in a
[16:52] stinking
[16:54] stable what a sight for them to behold
[16:58] the Angel Lord now surrounded by a
[17:00] multitude of a Heavenly Host what a
[17:02] sound what a sight and what a sound to
[17:04] hear in that moment and the how
[17:06] overwhelming it would have been to their
[17:08] senses the Angels announcing the Messiah
[17:10] in the contrast to verse 12 a babe
[17:13] wrapped in swaddling clothes lining in
[17:15] the manger think of all the heavens
[17:18] being full of angels to where as we
[17:20] would see the stars and the thickness of
[17:21] the stars that now the sky is just full
[17:23] of a heavenly host and all their voices
[17:26] and they and the Shepherds can hear it
[17:28] can feel it what A Sight and Sound and
[17:30] it's contrasted by this little baby
[17:34] wrapped in Oxen rags in a stinking
[17:37] stable what a
[17:39] contrast and it says in verse 15 and it
[17:42] came to pass as the Angels were gone
[17:43] away from them into the heaven however
[17:46] it was that they disappeared out of
[17:47] their sight the shepherd said one to
[17:49] another let us now go even un
[17:53] Bethlehem they they had heard the
[17:55] message they had received this
[17:56] announcement from the angel of Lord and
[17:58] it's quite a a Grandeur quite a scene
[18:01] and a lot to bask in a lot for me maybe
[18:04] just to settle down like woo wow this
[18:07] was amazing but they are they catch that
[18:11] the this was an invitation unto you is
[18:13] born this day and it shall be a sign
[18:16] unto you ye shall find the babe and it
[18:18] wasn't necessarily told to go but the
[18:20] way that was being announced is you need
[18:22] to go and so something stirs inside of
[18:25] them and it says they said let us now go
[18:27] even to Bethlehem that's that city of
[18:30] David and see that's what part has just
[18:33] been so exciting to me and see this
[18:36] thing which is to come to pass which has
[18:38] come to pass they were told by the angel
[18:41] of Lord so they could they could have
[18:42] had it on good word that it had come to
[18:44] pass and they wouldn't have been wrong
[18:45] to say that it came to pass but there
[18:47] was something inside of these Shepherds
[18:49] that say let us go and see the thing
[18:51] that has come to pass I don't want to
[18:53] just talk about it I don't want to just
[18:54] be told about it I want to see what has
[18:57] come to pass
[18:59] he says that let's see this thing which
[19:01] has come to pass which the Lord hath
[19:03] made known unto us that strikes me to
[19:07] say that there's a lot of things that
[19:09] God has revealed to us there's a lot of
[19:10] things that maybe we see by Revelation
[19:13] but we ought to have a hunger to see the
[19:15] things that the Lord has made known unto
[19:17] us I want to see it by his stripes I'm
[19:19] Healed I believe it now I want to see it
[19:21] there's certain things that have been
[19:22] made known to us by Revelation I believe
[19:24] it it's been told to me it's on good
[19:26] word I don't doubt it but I still want
[19:28] to see it yes see the thing which has
[19:32] come to pass which the Lord hath made
[19:33] known unto us and they came with haste
[19:37] they just weren't kind of walking they
[19:38] weren't taking their time they didn't
[19:40] take the long way there was an urgency
[19:42] let us now go to Bethlehem and they came
[19:44] with haste and found Mary and Joseph and
[19:49] the Babe lying in a
[19:53] Manger they saw what the Lord had made
[19:56] known he told them that you'll find a
[19:59] babe wrapped in swadd and clothes lying
[20:00] in the manger they said well let's go
[20:02] see what we already
[20:03] know let's take steps let's Advance
[20:06] let's go forward to that which we know
[20:08] we're not doubting it we're not claiming
[20:10] that we need to prove the veracity of it
[20:11] no we know it therefore I can have
[20:13] confidence to go see
[20:15] it and they saw exactly what the Lord
[20:17] had made know to them I believe it could
[20:20] be noted that based upon what they were
[20:22] told there's no uh nothing in the
[20:25] scripture that implies that they saw a
[20:27] star although the night wind had told
[20:29] the little lamb uh there's nothing in
[20:31] the scripture to tell us that that's
[20:33] what they had seen but yet somehow they
[20:34] find their way to this place and they
[20:37] see the very thing that they had
[20:40] known and in this scene brother brandham
[20:43] touches on it a little bit and God
[20:44] hiding himself in Simplicity then
[20:46] revealing himself in the same it'd be a
[20:48] good Christmas message to listen to he's
[20:51] talking about Joseph he says the man
[20:52] Joseph with such connection with God
[20:54] till God could speak to him then he
[20:57] makes the statement he you can tell
[20:58] there's a lot there that he wants to get
[20:59] into he says but today we get our
[21:01] ecclesiastical jacket so draw up around
[21:04] us till nothing can speak to us outside
[21:06] of the ecclesiastical group that we
[21:08] belong to we have our ideas and our
[21:11] interpretations and we have a way that
[21:13] we want it to be we have our Traditions
[21:15] he said we get so caught up drawned up
[21:17] so tight in our ecclesiastical jacket
[21:20] that anything outside of that we won't
[21:22] listen to H if the angel Lord appeared
[21:25] and begin to tell us what we would go
[21:26] see we would we wouldn't desire to go
[21:28] see it we wouldn't advance to go see it
[21:30] he says anything outside of that group
[21:32] we that we belong to nothing can speak
[21:34] to us he says I don't want to get harsh
[21:36] or radical so I'll leave that alone
[21:37] right there and so I'm kind of wishing
[21:39] he would have got a little radical and I
[21:41] would have invited a little bit of
[21:42] harshness to know what he was hitting at
[21:44] there he says notice but you understand
[21:46] what I mean notice a stable was
[21:48] ridiculous for them that means it's it
[21:51] deserves mockery to be ridiculous it
[21:54] deserves ridicule
[21:57] derision
[21:58] stable if you had to announce this to go
[22:01] and and if good it it brings to mind
[22:04] perhaps if this announcement had been to
[22:06] any other class of people besides
[22:07] Shepherds it would have been like that's
[22:09] where he went then maybe we've been
[22:11] wasting our time waiting for him oh
[22:13] that's what he is right now as a baby
[22:15] well let's see if he makes it to 30
[22:17] years old and then we'll follow him he
[22:19] says it was ridiculous a stable I
[22:22] believe it suggests that had the angel
[22:24] Lord appeared and said the Messiah was
[22:26] born in a stable that said be the
[22:28] Messiah no uh-uh we just don't believe
[22:30] it that's good cuz it's ridiculous he
[22:32] says the polished we don't even have a
[22:34] record where he ever attended one day of
[22:36] school and yet at the age of 12 years
[22:37] old a simple boy confounded the priest
[22:39] in the temple by his teaching he says oh
[22:41] my what was it God hiding
[22:45] himself ever heard of hide and
[22:47] seek so God's hiding himself and you
[22:50] have to find him to see him and here God
[22:52] was hidden this picture of a babe lying
[22:54] in a Manger but the angel of the Lord
[22:56] told him go and you'll see go and you'll
[22:58] find cuz he's hiding there in this cave
[23:01] in the side of a hill he's hiding there
[23:02] in this stinking stable he's hiding
[23:04] wrapped in Oxen Rags he's hiding there
[23:06] but the Lord said this is where you'll
[23:08] see the Messiah this is where you'll
[23:10] find him it's God hiding himself he says
[23:13] I feel pretty religious right now God
[23:15] hiding himself in a barn oh Hallelujah
[23:18] God hiding himself in a barn what do you
[23:20] see I just see a shack I just see a barn
[23:22] I just see something very simple he says
[23:24] God hiding himself in a little child
[23:27] amen am it's God there in the barn it's
[23:30] God there in this little
[23:32] child watch he said it's going to
[23:34] display after a while though it's hid in
[23:37] the barn it's hidden the child but
[23:39] eventually it's going to display
[23:41] itself and the the secret is is to see
[23:43] it where he's hiding right because once
[23:45] it displays itself it could be too late
[23:48] yes
[23:49] amen when he went on the streets the
[23:52] parents no doubt would talk and say
[23:54] these are the Whispers about this child
[23:56] who's now growing don't play with that
[23:59] kid don't have nothing to do with him
[24:02] his M mother's nothing but a common
[24:04] prostitute these are the Whispers about
[24:07] Christ you hear the stories you know the
[24:09] rumors about his birth you know what
[24:12] Joseph did you know what the Romans did
[24:14] you know what she did says the father
[24:17] and the mother the baby was born before
[24:19] they were actually
[24:20] married maybe nitpicking on the dates
[24:23] right they they felt they they found
[24:25] that I got you right the moment where
[24:27] they could add it all up and put all the
[24:29] times and figures together and say wow I
[24:31] mean the baby couldn't even been they
[24:32] weren't even married yet when it was
[24:33] born it could had to be conceived before
[24:35] then so this is a big
[24:38] stain birth certificates were an issue
[24:40] even way back then he says the baby was
[24:43] born before they were actually married
[24:45] she was be she was to be mother have
[24:47] nothing to do with
[24:49] it that's what they have to say about
[24:51] this
[24:52] child you say What Child Is This it's a
[24:55] it's the results of adultery
[24:58] What Child Is This is born out of
[25:00] wedlock What Child Is This the child of
[25:02] a common prostitute's the
[25:04] rumor but it's God hiding
[25:07] himself hiding himself behind the rumors
[25:10] hiding himself behind the the the the
[25:13] lies hiding himself behind all the facts
[25:15] and figures that they would have come up
[25:16] to try to tear it down right and so it
[25:19] brings me to one of the things that was
[25:21] a great inspiration to me in preparing
[25:23] this sermon is the poem by William
[25:26] Chatterton dicks so you have to say all
[25:28] three if he's writing a
[25:29] poem but this this poet wrote What Child
[25:32] Is This in
[25:35] 1865 and this poem poses three questions
[25:38] about the manger scene and when it was
[25:41] written in 1865 it was just that it was
[25:43] just a poem by William Chatterton dicks
[25:45] but in
[25:46] 1871 it was set to the tune of green
[25:49] sleeves and here's the I believe this is
[25:50] the original music that was published in
[25:52] in
[25:54] 1871 and it is this the the tun
[25:57] Greensleeves was a traditional English
[26:00] folk song that was hundreds of years old
[26:03] some speculate that it was written by
[26:04] Henry VII but it wasn't it was even
[26:06] referenced long before Henry 8 and
[26:08] there's a lot of Shakespeare refers to
[26:10] it and it was a traditional English folk
[26:12] song that many have tried to interpret
[26:14] through the years but one of the
[26:16] traditional interpretations of the song
[26:18] remember this is the tune that the the
[26:21] poem What Child Is This is set to What
[26:24] Child Is This which lays to res that
[26:28] Melody and that tune is this green
[26:30] sleeves this English folk song and one
[26:32] of the traditional interpretations about
[26:34] that song is it's about a promiscuous
[26:36] young
[26:37] woman or about a
[26:40] prostitute there's this speculation oh
[26:42] the tune is about a a common prostitute
[26:45] this tune is about a this woman about a
[26:47] mistress and about that and I thought it
[26:49] was remarkable that a tune that these
[26:52] labels had been attached to and the
[26:54] speculation is that was bu just about
[26:56] some promiscuous woman or some common
[26:58] prostitute that they would choose that
[27:00] tune to go to the words What Child Is
[27:03] This because that was the very song they
[27:06] were singing about Mary it was the very
[27:08] song they were singing about Christ What
[27:10] Child Is This the child of a common
[27:12] prostitute What Child Is This the child
[27:15] of a mistress the child of a lover and
[27:18] that may be all that some see is the
[27:21] rumors and the
[27:22] falsehoods but the questions asked in
[27:24] this poem that one day was played six
[27:27] years later to this tune of green
[27:28] sleeves to where now it's most
[27:30] recognized as The Melody of What Child
[27:32] Is This the questions posed in that poem
[27:35] were What Child Is This who laid to rest
[27:38] on Mary's lap is sleeping there's your
[27:41] first question this child that's laying
[27:44] on Mary's lap this child that is
[27:45] sleeping there What Child Is This whom
[27:49] Angels greet cuz now we realize the baby
[27:52] having been born the announcement coming
[27:54] afterwards now to the public a and to
[27:57] the shepher and they're going to be soon
[27:58] invited to see this scene the question
[28:00] is whom Angels greet with Anthem sweet
[28:04] taking those very words glory to God in
[28:06] the highest and turn it into an Anthem
[28:07] turn into a song and and we don't take
[28:09] issue with that as maybe the uh the bans
[28:12] would but we would say no this is this
[28:14] is the Declaration this is the
[28:15] proclamation says whom Angels greet with
[28:17] Anthem sweet while Shepherds watch are
[28:19] keeping this is the next question What
[28:22] Child Is This that lays to rest What
[28:25] Child Is This that the angels have
[28:28] announced to these Shepherds with this
[28:30] Anthem and then the the
[28:33] second the next question in the what
[28:36] would be called maybe the second verse
[28:38] is why lies he in such mean a state he
[28:43] may not be able to see it here on the
[28:44] slide but that's the question why lies
[28:47] he in such mean a state where ox and
[28:50] asss are
[28:51] feeding what is he doing here notice I I
[28:54] think it kind of it moves in and out as
[28:56] we see this babe in a Manger wrapped in
[28:59] swaddling clothes on the lap of this
[29:01] teenage girl and a side of the St
[29:04] stinking stable on the side of a hill
[29:06] but then we hear the angels greet with
[29:07] Anthem sweet while Shepherds watch are
[29:09] keeping we hear these angels declared
[29:11] and it comes right back after hearing
[29:13] what the angel said well why does he lay
[29:15] here in such a mean a state surrounded
[29:18] by oxen and
[29:19] sheep and it says good Christian fear
[29:22] for Sinners here the silent word is
[29:25] pleading what a phrase
[29:28] as immediately grabs our attention a
[29:31] babe lying in the manger Angels saying
[29:34] this is the Messiah but her eyes turned
[29:36] back to the stable a stinking stable
[29:39] amongst uh animals and beasts of Burden
[29:42] that are eating and straw and the
[29:43] smile's a mean State and it says good
[29:46] Christian fear be in awe reverence don't
[29:48] lose the sacredness for Sinners here the
[29:51] silent word is
[29:53] pleading the silent word he could not
[29:56] yet form words he could not speak out
[29:58] the kingdom of God is at hand but
[30:00] somehow in this scene what do you see do
[30:03] you see what I see Do You Hear What I
[30:05] Hear The Poet is saying the silent word
[30:08] is
[30:10] pleading and these Shepherds it says in
[30:12] Luke 27 and when they had seen it this
[30:15] is what they
[30:17] saw say what did they see they saw a
[30:19] baby in a stinking stable on the side of
[30:22] a hill that's what they saw would you
[30:24] agree with me I know maybe that's a
[30:27] sounds like a trick question I'm trying
[30:28] to box you in and impeach you but uh
[30:32] this is he says what what what did they
[30:34] see it says when they had seen it they
[30:37] made known abroad the
[30:39] Sayan the Sayan what Sayan which was
[30:42] told them concerning this
[30:44] child this is the way and and I
[30:46] apologize if maybe I'm adding my thought
[30:50] on
[30:50] this but they saw it and they made known
[30:55] what they were told amen that's good
[30:59] they what they saw they could have said
[31:01] well let's just kind of stick to what we
[31:03] call the facts here we saw a teenage
[31:05] girl with an older man with his baby
[31:07] born in the side of a hill around oxen
[31:10] and sheep and kind of described it we'll
[31:11] just kind of leave it to you but they
[31:13] told what they knew God had told them
[31:16] they made known abroad the saying which
[31:18] was told them concerning the child they
[31:19] made known the truth of it what they
[31:21] actually saw so it wasn't just to
[31:23] describe the circumstances but to know
[31:26] what they saw all and they said this is
[31:28] what we've seen we've seen Christ the
[31:31] lord we've seen a savior born this day
[31:33] in Bethlehem CU isn't all that heard it
[31:36] wondered at those things which are told
[31:38] them by the
[31:39] Shepherds I could have believed it they
[31:41] would have went back and told everybody
[31:43] oh man this lady had a baby on the side
[31:46] of a hill she had a baby in a stable and
[31:48] there's no room in the end and she had a
[31:49] baby nobody would be in Wonder and awe
[31:52] they say oh well that's unfortunate yeah
[31:53] there's a lot of people in town there's
[31:54] not a lot of end with beds tonight
[31:56] that's it's unfortunate she had to be
[31:58] that baby had to be born but it was to
[32:00] this day this day to you is born a
[32:03] savior Christ the
[32:06] Lord but it says but Mary kept all these
[32:08] things and pondered them in her
[32:10] heart two different reactions two
[32:13] different
[32:14] responsibilities brother Brandon picks
[32:16] up on it and God hiding himself in
[32:17] Simplicity then revealing himself in the
[32:19] same but altogether no matter what the
[32:21] outside thought she pondered all these
[32:23] things they hid it in their
[32:25] heart they knew knew they couldn't say
[32:28] anything against it God speaks to his
[32:30] men sometimes and say hold your peace
[32:32] don't say nothing about it brother BR
[32:34] kind of then gives a little bit of a
[32:36] description of circumstances where he's
[32:38] been under that situation he returns
[32:40] back and says and Joseph knew different
[32:43] he knew who that baby belonged to Mary
[32:45] knew who it belonged to Jesus knew who
[32:48] his father was what did he say I must be
[32:50] about my father's business it's speaking
[32:52] to what they knew what they saw what
[32:54] they understood there's one way we could
[32:57] describe it there's one way we could try
[32:58] to say well we were engaged and then
[33:00] this happened that happened just kind
[33:01] try to describe the facts and make the
[33:02] chronology work but said they kept these
[33:04] things in the art because they knew what
[33:06] it was she pondered these things Joseph
[33:08] knew these things they knew who the baby
[33:10] belonged to Jesus said I must be about
[33:12] my father's business not sawing wood and
[33:14] making a door but about his father's
[33:15] business he said that to his mother
[33:18] can't you understand that it's time for
[33:19] me to be about my father's business
[33:21] you'll find this as you read Luke
[33:23] Chapter 2 and read it to the end this
[33:24] very instance here is at the end of that
[33:26] chapter
[33:28] he says now they thought this little
[33:30] cracked up child he says any
[33:32] illegitimate child is kind of an odd
[33:34] Curious Thing anyhow and there you are
[33:37] but God hiding himself listen God hiding
[33:41] himself in what was thought of the world
[33:43] as filth corruption
[33:47] illegitimate look at all those labels
[33:50] that could be put on it all the warning
[33:52] signs all the red flags filth corruption
[33:55] illegitimate
[33:57] even as we would take all those things
[33:59] into view and bring it down to that one
[34:02] simple slice or segment there's
[34:05] Joseph there's
[34:07] Mary this man who was a spouse and had
[34:11] not yet taken her to be wife when she
[34:12] was found pregnant and now it has run
[34:15] its course they find themselves out of
[34:17] town and he's there in Bethlehem and
[34:19] there's no room at the end and they've
[34:21] been forced into the side of a hill into
[34:23] a little cave to have a baby born and
[34:25] now as the baby's born it's wrapped in
[34:27] swaddling clothes and is placed into a
[34:29] manger and the rumor is that Joseph is
[34:31] covering something up some adultery some
[34:34] fornication some sin and this baby is
[34:36] really an illegitimate child and this
[34:39] filth and Corruption everything right
[34:41] and somebody could add it all up
[34:43] together and say that's a fitting
[34:44] picture for what we actually think this
[34:47] is and what they would see is a common
[34:51] prostitute what they would see is
[34:53] unfaithfulness what they would see is
[34:55] filth and Corruption and illegit
[34:58] legitimate but in verse 20 it says and
[35:01] the Shepherds returned glorifying and
[35:03] praising God for all the things that
[35:05] they had heard and seen as it was told
[35:09] unto
[35:10] them the angel Lord appears and says
[35:13] unto you this day a savior has been born
[35:17] in the city of David Christ the lord
[35:21] what an announcement they heard that and
[35:23] they saw it and now they return
[35:25] glorifying and praising ing God for all
[35:27] the things that they had heard what the
[35:29] Lord said and seen what they were told
[35:33] is it was a savior it was Christ the
[35:34] lord what they saw was a infant baby a
[35:37] newborn a child wrapped in swaddling
[35:41] clothes in a stinking stable among the
[35:44] wastage and The Oxen and the Sheep the
[35:47] filth and corruption with the label
[35:51] illegitimate but they were praising him
[35:53] for what they had heard and
[35:55] seen and as the poem goes What Child Is
[35:58] This who laid the rest on Mary's lap is
[36:01] sleeping whom Angels greet with Anthem
[36:03] sweep while Shepherds watch are keeping
[36:06] why lies he in such mean a state well
[36:09] where ox and ass are feeding good
[36:10] Christian fear for Sinners here the
[36:12] silent word is pleading and the chorus
[36:15] rings out when it's put to music to that
[36:17] tune of green sleeves that itself
[36:19] carries the mark and the stain of rumors
[36:21] and illegitimacy it rings out this
[36:23] chorus of the Shepherds this this is
[36:26] Christ the king whom Shepherds guard and
[36:29] Angels Sing haste haste to bring him
[36:32] Lord the babe the son of Mary what is it
[36:35] telling us that this is not just some
[36:37] common child this isn't just some birth
[36:40] and unfortunate circumstances but this
[36:42] is the Messiah
[36:44] King this is the
[36:47] king whom the Shepherds Race To Whom the
[36:50] Angels sang their anthem of this this
[36:53] baby that is born to this Mary this is
[36:56] the king amen right Christ the
[36:59] King that's what they
[37:02] saw and it says in verse 21 and when
[37:05] eight days were accomplished from the
[37:06] circumcision of for the circumcision of
[37:08] the
[37:11] child his name was called
[37:14] Jesus which was so named of the Angel
[37:16] before he was conceived in the womb when
[37:19] the days of her purification according
[37:21] to the law of Moses were accomplished
[37:22] they brought him to Jerusalem to present
[37:24] him to the Lord and there's a lot of
[37:25] steps that they're going going through a
[37:26] lot of scriptural things a lot of things
[37:28] hearkening back to the law say as it is
[37:30] written in the law of the Lord every
[37:31] male that openeth the womb Shall be
[37:33] Called holy to the Lord and to offer
[37:35] sacrifice according to that which is
[37:36] said in the law of the Lord a pair of
[37:38] turtle doves or two young pigeons and
[37:41] behold that sets the scene now just
[37:43] these eight days after this birth and
[37:46] behold there's a man in Jerusalem whose
[37:47] name was
[37:49] Simeon and the
[37:51] man the same man was just and devout
[37:55] waiting for the consolation of Israel
[37:58] what was he waiting for the very things
[38:00] the angel
[38:01] said unto you is Born This Day in the
[38:03] city of David a savior which is Christ
[38:05] the Lord that's what he was waiting for
[38:06] the consolation the peace the comfort
[38:09] and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it
[38:11] was revealed unto him by the holy ghost
[38:13] that he should not see death before he
[38:15] had seen the Lord's Christ this is
[38:18] exactly what was announced which is the
[38:20] Lord's Christ which is Born This Day in
[38:23] the city of David and he came by the
[38:26] Spirit under the temple now he's going
[38:28] to see something he's been told that
[38:29] you're going to see the Lord's Christ
[38:31] now hopefully you can get yourself in
[38:32] this uh uh in this scene here I I don't
[38:36] this is this is a very simple
[38:38] straightforward thought tonight so just
[38:39] stay with me he says when the he had
[38:42] seen he when he came by the spirit into
[38:44] the temple when the parents brought in
[38:46] the Child Jesus to do for him after the
[38:48] custom of the law now they've come they
[38:51] brought the child to do those things
[38:52] which we read about in verse 23 and 24
[38:55] now the holy they're coming according to
[38:56] the law he's coming according to the
[38:58] spirit beautiful how these things are
[39:00] going to intersect and those these
[39:02] obediences and the promise given here
[39:04] and The Obedience here and as they come
[39:06] together they're going to bring the
[39:07] child this baby to do according to the
[39:10] custom of La it says then took he him up
[39:12] in his arms now all he's doing is taking
[39:16] a baby which he has done many times
[39:18] before into his arms he's holding a
[39:20] child he's holding an infant he's
[39:21] holding a newborn and brother brandom
[39:24] even goes so far as to say that he's
[39:26] still wrapped in swaddling clothes wow
[39:29] there was nothing about the garments he
[39:31] was wrapped in there was nothing about
[39:32] the presentation there was nothing to
[39:34] signal with this great Entourage and
[39:36] words of of announcement it was nothing
[39:38] about the scene that would have signaled
[39:40] we've got
[39:41] royalty Simon be Simeon be on your best
[39:44] behavior there was nothing about it
[39:46] nothing about the garments he had on uh
[39:49] it wasn't
[39:50] Gucci LV all over the all over the
[39:53] blanket it wasn't anything to signal to
[39:55] him this is something very very
[39:56] important but as he takes it into his
[39:58] arms and blessed God and said now what
[40:00] did he see swaddling clothes a baby of
[40:04] eight days what would distinguish this
[40:06] but what does he see he says Lord now
[40:09] let us thou thy servant depart in peace
[40:11] according to Thy word for mine eyes have
[40:14] seen thy salvation oh it's beautiful the
[40:18] confirmation as the angel of the Lord
[40:20] appeared to the Shepherds and say unto
[40:21] you this day in the city of David a
[40:24] savior is born the salvation of Israel
[40:26] and he could say mine eyes have seen thy
[40:30] salvation the very thing the angel lord
[40:32] said it was he knew what he saw was that
[40:36] thing says which thou prepared before
[40:38] the face of the people all people a
[40:41] light to lighten the Gentiles what was
[40:42] he holding an eighty old baby a light
[40:46] amen a
[40:47] savior and the glory of thy People
[40:50] Israel what was the glory the light the
[40:53] salvation and Joseph and his mother mark
[40:56] mared means they admired at those things
[40:58] which are spoken of him he was holding a
[41:01] baby of eight days wrapped in common
[41:05] garments maybe even wrapped in things
[41:07] that were uncommon if we took it from
[41:09] the the the swaddling clothes survived
[41:11] Bethlehem and made it there to be
[41:14] presented before Simeon in the
[41:16] temple he said I had was told that
[41:18] before I die I would see the Lord's
[41:20] Christ and now as he held the baby what
[41:23] does he see thy salvation yeah the
[41:27] Lord's Christ thy
[41:30] salvation brother brandham in the sermon
[41:32] why little Bethlehem as he asked this
[41:34] question in December of 63 says in this
[41:36] little town little stable City stable
[41:38] down on the side of the bluff was a cave
[41:40] back in the bluff and out of there came
[41:42] forth through its little doors the
[41:44] Prince of Peace born in a stable and a
[41:48] little box of straw sitting somewhere
[41:50] manure P manure piled up in the Barns
[41:52] and so forth but out there came that
[41:55] great Prince
[41:57] the seed of the woman there's Genesis
[41:58] 3:15 out there came the savior of the
[42:01] world out there came Jehovah himself and
[42:04] the form of a man came out of that
[42:06] little humble stable in
[42:09] Bethlehem not in some King's Palace born
[42:11] in royalty but let me say but yet a king
[42:15] not in some King's Palace born in
[42:17] royalty but yet born
[42:20] royally oh Hallelujah but there he came
[42:23] from that humble place to a manure stack
[42:26] down in there and was wrapped in
[42:27] swaddling cloth as tradition says it was
[42:29] taken from the Yoke of an ox where they
[42:31] had been plowing with
[42:33] it what is it that Simeon saw he saw the
[42:37] Prince of Peace he saw Jehovah as a
[42:39] little
[42:41] baby and this is the part that just I
[42:45] want to bring it to here in Luke chap 2:
[42:47] 34 and 35 CU Simon is not done because
[42:50] now he says and Simeon bless them when
[42:54] he held the child he took him up in his
[42:56] arms and blessed God and he spoke of
[42:58] what this child was hopefully that scene
[43:00] is still reverberating in your ears but
[43:02] now as it were is he still holding the
[43:05] salvation of the Lord the Messiah the
[43:08] Lord's Christ he blessed them and said
[43:11] unto Mary his mother behold this
[43:14] child is set for the fall and Rising
[43:18] again of many in
[43:21] Israel the fall of many and the rising
[43:23] of many the curse of some and the
[43:26] blessing of
[43:27] some even spoken as it was the fall of
[43:30] Israel but yet it would be the
[43:31] Redemption of Israel and for a sign
[43:34] which shall be spoken against this this
[43:37] prophecy is so important he's holding
[43:39] the baby ow you'd have to be a real ugly
[43:42] baby to be spoken against right maybe
[43:45] what the the least we all would say or
[43:47] the most we'd ever say is that's a face
[43:48] only a mother could love but as he holds
[43:51] this infant this newborn this baby and I
[43:54] don't keep using those phrases cuz you
[43:55] might not know which one of them means
[43:57] but just for the emphasis to remind
[44:00] ourselves of the Innocence and the
[44:03] reality that unto us a child was
[44:06] born this child is set for the fall and
[44:09] Rising again of many in Israel and for a
[44:11] sign which shall be spoken against and
[44:12] then he inserts this parenthetical
[44:14] phrase kind of steps back a little bit
[44:16] and says something directly to Mary yay
[44:18] a sword shall pierce through thine own
[44:21] soul
[44:23] also sword shall pierce to thy own soul
[44:26] he's speaking to
[44:28] Mary as he speaks to Mary he's saying
[44:30] you're going to
[44:31] suffer and she did what was her
[44:33] suffering he's crucified her son is
[44:36] crucified and so as the poem is written
[44:38] What Child Is This that's laid to rest
[44:40] on Mary's lap is sleeping whom Angels
[44:42] greet with Anthem sweet why Shepherds
[44:44] watch are keeping the poem does not just
[44:47] describe that scene as to why he's left
[44:50] in such mean a
[44:51] state and where ox and ass are feeding
[44:54] good Christians fear for Sinners here
[44:56] the silent word is pleading the poem
[44:57] continues Nails spear shall pierce him
[45:01] through the cross be born for me for you
[45:05] hell hell the word made flesh the babe
[45:07] the son of Mary as it is even in
[45:10] simeon's own declaration to Mary behold
[45:13] this child is set for the fall and
[45:14] riseing again of many in Israel but it
[45:16] shall be a sword that pierces through
[45:18] thine own soul why because nail and
[45:20] spear shall pierce him through and it'll
[45:22] pierce your soul as a grieving mother
[45:26] then notice this phrase in Luke 2:35
[45:29] that the thoughts of many hearts may be
[45:31] revealed
[45:32] yes the sign will reveal the hearts of
[45:36] many what does a person see when they
[45:39] see
[45:41] him as it said You shall find a babe
[45:44] wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in
[45:45] the manger it said this shall be a sign
[45:50] unto
[45:51] you and as he is holding this baby he
[45:55] says
[45:56] that it shall be for a
[45:58] sign which shall be spoken
[46:02] against and let's remove the
[46:03] parenthetical phrase about Mary that the
[46:06] thoughts of many hearts may be revealed
[46:08] because what a Man speaketh reveals
[46:09] what's in his
[46:11] heart a person's response and an opinion
[46:13] of Christ discloses the thoughts of his
[46:16] Hearts amen a person's opinion about his
[46:20] birth a PO person's opinion about this
[46:22] babe this infant the way one might
[46:25] ration
[46:26] about his deity one that may rationalize
[46:28] about his birth one that may reject him
[46:30] just wholesale outright May accept that
[46:32] perhaps he was a great man that he lived
[46:34] this is what Christ is the Bible says
[46:36] he's going to be a sign and he's going
[46:39] to be a sign in such a way he's going to
[46:40] be a Wonder in such a way it'll cause
[46:42] many to speak against him and in doing
[46:44] so the thoughts of many hearts will be
[46:45] revealed when you see him what do you
[46:49] see what does a person see when they see
[46:51] him because our response to the sign
[46:55] discloses the thoughts in our hearts
[46:57] about
[46:58] Christ and brother brandham said God
[47:01] hiding himself in Simplicity what was it
[47:04] God in
[47:06] Simplicity that's what made him so
[47:08] great the ethics of Education cannot
[47:11] belittle itself like that see it cannot
[47:15] stand it but God is so great that he
[47:17] brought himself down to that not even of
[47:19] clothes to put on his own child think of
[47:22] it and the world there was no room in
[47:24] the end and he went into a cow stable a
[47:27] little ledge a little cave like back in
[47:29] the side of the hill and there upon a
[47:31] straw bed came the Son of
[47:34] God as we consider that scene what do
[47:37] you
[47:38] see what is it that we could take away
[47:41] from
[47:42] this and all the elements and all the
[47:44] imagery and how we're walk through the
[47:45] story all we have is the Angel of the
[47:47] Lord's word on it the rest of what we
[47:49] see is a baby yeah born of a woman in a
[47:52] little ledge on the side of a hill in a
[47:54] stinking stable yeah it survived it made
[47:56] it there was ox and there was sheep Okay
[47:57] Shepherd showed
[47:59] up all we have is the word of the Angel
[48:01] Lord all we have what is said but what
[48:03] is it we're seeing what is it that
[48:04] strikes the eye how is it we're
[48:06] processing what do we see could we by
[48:08] the Holy Spirit say what Simeon said
[48:10] I've seen thy salvation right what is it
[48:14] we see when we see him laying there on a
[48:16] straw
[48:17] bed because what we see is not just a
[48:21] Manger but a
[48:22] throne the manger throne it's also a
[48:26] poem by William Chatterton dicks written
[48:28] in 1865 it was published in the joyful
[48:31] hymns of Christian TI Christmas tide
[48:33] four joyful hymns of Christmas
[48:35] tide written it in
[48:38] 1865 they say it's this
[48:41] poem that What Child Is This was taken
[48:44] from this one that we've been reading to

[50:37] crowding the air and Heaven and Earth
[50:39] through the Spotless birth are at peace
[50:42] on this night so

[50:48] slipped into a deep depression and was
[50:50] despairing for life and in there he come
[50:52] to know
[50:53] Christ and he wrote this poem the manger

[51:24] the stable floor the pavement of

[51:29] Manger I see a throne I don't see oxen I
[51:32] don't see hay I see royalty there for
[51:36] the Bible says in Isaiah 9:6 and 7 For
[51:38] unto us a child I kept thinking unto us
[51:43] a child you're you're dead in sins
[51:45] you're lost you're broken you're
[51:47] depressed you're diseased you're
[51:48] Afflicted you're under bondage you're
[51:50] being slain you're treated as Lambs for
[51:52] the slaughter unto us a child unto us us
[51:55] a child is born
[51:58] amen that's what was given a child unto
[52:00] us a son is given but what do you see I
[52:03] do not see a child I do not just see a
[52:06] son but a government a kingdom of power
[52:10] because the government shall be upon his
[52:13] shoulder what is he he's the king and
[52:16] his name Shall be Called wonderful
[52:18] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[52:21] father not just a child not just the son
[52:24] the princip peace and of the increase of
[52:27] his government of his kingdom it shall
[52:29] be a kingdom of Peace there shall be no
[52:31] end and upon the throne of David and
[52:34] upon his kingdom to order it and to
[52:36] establish it with judgment and with
[52:38] Justice from henceforth even
[52:40] forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts
[52:42] will perform this and on that night as
[52:45] shepherds are keeping watch over their
[52:47] sheep the angel of the Lord comes and
[52:49] the glory of the Lord shines round about
[52:51] them and it says unto you is born this
[52:55] day it is said For unto you a child is
[52:58] born upon the throne of David as it were
[53:01] in Bethlehem in a Manger
[53:05] Throne What Child Is
[53:07] This who's laid to rest on Mary's lap is
[53:12] sleeping this
[53:14] child which lies in Mina state where ox

[53:18] feeding which Nails spear shall pierce
[53:21] him through the cross be born for me for
[53:23] you this
[53:26] this is Christ the
[53:28] King whom Shepherds seemingly seem to
[53:31] guard as they would Lambs as they would
[53:33] sheep why does he take the license to
[53:35] say whom Shepherds guard because that's
[53:37] what the Shepherds were doing is keeping
[53:39] guard over the sheep and there laid the
[53:41] Lamb of God In A Manger the Lamb of God
[53:44] the king of glory in a Manger
[53:47] Throne heast H to bring him Lord the

[55:12] himself in the corruption of a dead seed
[55:14] to bring forth
[55:20] life see do you get it God hides in
[55:25] himself
[55:27] now in a simple little wash woman or an
[55:31] ordinary man with his dinner under his
[55:33] arms kiss his wife and children goodbye
[55:36] and go out there and maybe hide himself
[55:38] in that man to do something that an Arch
[55:41] Bishop would know nothing
[55:43] about where do we where do we set him
[55:48] now come peasant come King to own him
[55:52] the king the king salvation brings let
[55:55] loving hearts enthrone him where does he
[55:59] hide
[56:00] himself and love still turns where the
[56:03] godhead Burns hidden flesh your flesh
[56:07] from fleshly
[56:09] sight why because people want to see the
[56:12] Archbishop they want to see him in great
[56:14] big
[56:15] things they want to see him in a palace
[56:17] they want to see him clothed in royalty
[56:20] they want him to come even today in a
[56:22] way that they expected him to then right
[56:25] yet he comes in Simplicity of
[56:27] Flesh and it's
[56:29] love where the godhead
[56:32] Burns hid in
[56:34] flesh seemingly from fleshly
[56:37] sight where does God hide himself and
[56:41] little washwoman an ordinary
[56:45] man see you don't hear him blow no horns
[56:49] and send it out God just gets Glory
[56:52] that's all the simple hear it and
[56:55] they're
[56:56] glad I hope you can hear
[57:00] him I hope you could hear his at where
[57:02] bells
[57:03] ringing I hope you can
[57:07] see what the what the poets write
[57:12] about is the night wind said to the
[57:14] little lamb do you see what I
[57:17] see and maybe we're not a little lamb
[57:19] and we don't hear the night wind but we
[57:21] could say I am to be another throne
[57:25] [Music]
[57:27] to the world
[57:29] nothing to the world the message is
[57:31] still nothing but a stinking
[57:34] stable it invites
[57:37] mockery it's still
[57:39] ridiculous and if we could step
[57:41] ourselves out of the glory of the Lord
[57:44] if we could step ourselves out of the
[57:46] Angel of the Lord if we could somehow
[57:48] separate ourselves out then we can see
[57:51] maybe what the world
[57:53] sees we can see just a a something
[57:56] wedged to a side of a hill we see the
[57:58] manure we see the straw we see the
[58:00] manger we see an older man we see a
[58:02] young teenage girl we see the dates not
[58:05] lining up we see a stinking stable it
[58:07] all makes sense from this perspective
[58:10] but do You Hear What I Hear do you see
[58:13] what I see I don't see the manure I
[58:16] don't even see the straw and if I see a
[58:18] Manger I still yet see a throne the
[58:22] manger Throne Christ inth throne
[58:26] yet again hidden flesh from fleshly
[58:30] sight I trust the simple hear it and are
[58:33] glad yet still
[58:34] today and I speak this to you today that
[58:38] if it be that because of Truth and
[58:40] because we know that Christ was not born
[58:42] on December 25th or even around there if
[58:45] it is to us a day of giving gifts that's
[58:48] fine if it is a time for us to make
[58:49] cookies if it's a time for gingerbread
[58:52] houses and Christmas songs that's fine
[58:54] it's wonderful but could we for a moment
[58:57] stop not just tonight but sometime
[59:00] together and stop and look and see the
[59:04] manger Throne that one day a child unto
[59:07] us a child a baby a newborn an infant
[59:11] was sent to us and it was a Manger
[59:16] throne and if I could see that doesn't
[59:19] matter if I could see
[59:21] that whatever I whatever else I see I
[59:24] could still speak of what I saw
[59:27] am and may we
[59:30] be God hidden flesh May the godhe head
[59:34] still burn hidden flesh from F fleshly
[59:38] sight May our faith no longer see the
[59:41] stable
[59:42] floor but royalty is
[59:46] here God bless you could we bow our
[59:49] heads in prayer
