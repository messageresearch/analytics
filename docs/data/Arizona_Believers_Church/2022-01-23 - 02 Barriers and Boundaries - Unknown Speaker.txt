TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen let's turn to genesis chapter 2. we like to read verses 16 and 17 genesis chapter 2 16-17 we begin a a series called barriers and boundaries on wednesday night and it is in a lot of ways just a continuation of a number of different themes that we've been ministering on over the last few months and just see a lot of continuity with some what some of the busy ministers have ministered on over the last month or so as well so i think there's just be a lot for us to grab ahold of and piece together genesis chapter 2 verse 16 and lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die let's bow our heads in prayer our gracious heavenly father it's a grand privilege to be together this morning and to do so with believers that have a a unique faith and a precious faith and lord we pray that as we have gathered together and brought our faith our expectation our licks of fire as it were to hear from you and to receive from you may it just create a wonderful atmosphere to receive whatever it is we have need of and lord as we have things that have not been expressed by lips and desires that we have not shared with others we know that you know our hearts and in knowing our heart you can discern and you can meet those needs and even you today lord could speak a word that addresses it in such a way to lift our faith to encourage us and to help us so lord i pray that you'd come now take the word of god bless it may it be amplified to our hearts by revelation be with your people to comfort them and strengthen them and have preeminence we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you can be seated i would uh mention that we started this on wednesday night and i almost would like to make it recommended listening as we continue in this subject if you if you didn't weren't here wednesday night and you'd like to hear it i would recommend you going back and listening to it maybe even after this just not right now everyone leaves puts their headphones on uh but no i just would recommend that you listen to it uh and just to kind of add to and kind of help understand where we're coming from today because i really just want to pick up where we were wednesday night without much um the without much background in where we were and we are focusing on genesis chapter one and god is establishing order in creation and having boundaries and setting bounds and putting the moon uh keep boundaries and tell them to see it could only go so far but on barriers and boundaries what we touched on at the very very end is how important it is to recognize the differences between the two uh barrier is one thing a boundary is another we'll get to some of those definitions here in a moment but this is gonna sound like a paradox but in order to experience an unlimited god you're gonna have to understand his boundaries and there's a way we think about his love his love is boundless his word was without end he's a god that fills all time and space and we think about eternity and all those different factors but in order to experience that god you're going to have to understand his boundaries and in order to truly express his nature if you we likewise are going to be those that express the character and nature of christ we're gonna have to understand the difference between barriers and boundaries and if i could put it this way that's just terminology uh that i'm using to understand concepts within the word of god and something there's uh different ways that we could be pulled even this morning as we minister there's maybe different ways that we could start to veer into some things but when we talk about barriers and boundaries we're looking at relationship and responsibility uh if you think about the concept of boundaries even the concepts of barriers you'll find that they have application in terms of what would give one responsibility has application with respect to relationships and as we were talking about practice this kind of veers into or kind of continue to lead into the concept of us doing our part in doing what we are called to do and there's uh there's just so many different examples that come to mind but we talked about it wednesday night how every day we're navigating barriers every day we're navigating boundaries uh it's both in the natural and the spiritual uh some of us bump into boundaries when we're driving some of us are navigating them or bump into barriers there's things that we fight against or things that we wrestle with and it's both natural and spiritual the concept of berries and boundaries shouldn't be real foreign to us and before i really get into this and and i i sense that you already are i really would desire that you focus very intently because i i feel like there's things i'm just kind of brushing over but if you could focus and concentrate very intently you can just kind of get the depth to it and so some things may not seem to connect but if you're really focusing and very intent i think you'll just see something very rich be amplified this morning now where we were wednesday night when we stopped is we identified how that god uses boundaries something that god does he uses boundaries and a boundary is that which indicates a border or a limit you say well what would that example be a wall a wall is a boundary a fence is a boundary something that's set up or put up indicate the limit of something or the border of something a boundary is something that indicates the limits of something therefore it is a dividing line or boundary is the furthest point of something so this is this is what we want you to think in terms of boundaries it's the limits of something it's the border it's the dividing line when you have a boundary it's the dividing line your property has a dividing line it's a boundary line it's a border and so it's what divides your property from someone else's property and in our in our country uh we put up fences uh to mark our boundaries to mark the borders of our property and that becomes a boundary indicating this part's my responsibility what's on the other side is your responsibility and so it marks the furthest point of a property line the furthest point of and god is the one that uses boundaries he's a god of boundaries but barriers are something that man uses barriers are something that satan uses and i'd like to look at it more in that context that satan uses barriers and it barriers anything that obstructs an entrance so you want to get into some place you put up a bear if there's a barrier there it's keeping you from entering in other words it's it's made for an entrance it's made for you to have access it's there there's something there for you to take or to have or to enjoy and you put up a barrier to keep others from coming in or to keep someone out so barrier is an obstacle a barrier something that impedes a barrier is something that hinders and so god uses boundaries he sets boundaries he has the limits of things but satan's the one that uses barriers we're all on the same page now good now that we're on the same page you can you can unleash your amens now if you'll turn to matthew chapter 13 this is uh maybe a unique place to start but god uses boundaries satan uses barriers matthew chapter 13 verses 53-58 it says and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these parables he'd departed things and when he was coming to his own country so now he's coming to nazareth he taught them in their synagogues in so much that they were astonished and said here's christ present amongst them teaching he's the messiah he's just expressed these different parables he's not uh this isn't his first sermon so we have several chapters into the story of jesus and different works that he's done so now he's teaching he has a reputation he's there amongst him it says winst this is their response when's hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works where is this coming from how is it he has these profound things to say and and why do how is it he's able to perform these mighty works and this is how they begin to wrestle within themselves and speculate is not this the carpenter's son is not his mother called mary and his brethren james and joseph and simon and judas and his sisters are they not all with us they're given the whole family tree you know his mom we know his dad we know his brothers we know his sisters are they're not with us so they're not all not human and mortal creatures wins then hath this man all these things perhaps there's some speculation that they're saying well we know joseph we know mary we know his brothers we know his sisters and none of them have any of these gifts none of them have this kind of wisdom have these kind of talents there's there's no way for us to deduce that this is a family of stature and skill or acumen and there's no real reason for us to see these things being expressed in jesus but this is the process they're going through as they wrestle with the words that jesus is teaching and that he's doing and he says and it says verse 57 and they were offended in him defended in him and but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor saving his own country and in his own house it was i'm honored everywhere else i'm honored in every other country i'm other honored in other places that i go but the one place that i'm without honor is in nazareth the one place i'm without honor is within within my own family those that know me those that are around me a prophet is not without honor save in his own country and his own house and then notice this is the verse i wanted to zero in on and we're just giving that background in and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief now pondered this story here's jesus christ he's the son of god in him dwells all the fullness of the godhead bodily he's one that teaches things that are astonishing he's one that's performed mighty works and he's standing there in their presence and they start to rationalize with who he is and what his history is and what his background is and maybe they're surmising a little bit about his family and his family's attitude towards them or whatever it might be he says but they are offended and jesus now picks up on this offense and says the prophet has honor everywhere else except in his own country and in his own house and then the bible declares this jesus doesn't say it but the bible says he doesn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief now i want to ask you this question was that a boundary or a barrier all right we got i guess i should have polled everybody we should do write your answers down there'll be a prize at the end so we look at this and you say is this a barrier or a boundary i think i heard a lot of barriers but it depends on the vantage point because to be to god if i could put it and this is just to help us understand barriers and boundaries how sometimes it can be different depending on where you're standing to god it was a boundary in other words he did not do many wonderful works because this is a boundary for god this is something that god would not cross and so god has said god is setting a marker and god has set in a parameter and he's saying i'm able i can do whatever i want but this is something i'm going to respect this is something i'm not going to cross but to those in nazareth their unbelief was a barrier so they did not experience the miracles they did not see the miracles they were not partakers in the miracle so from them their unbelief and what they're looking at there were barriers in the way of them enjoying and seeing more mighty works and so their unbelief and their attitudes and the questions they had and their offense becomes a hindrance for them it's an impediment here's the christ who can heal him here's the christ that can save him here's a christ that can do many mighty works and declare himself to be the messiah but there's something that withheld them and kept them from appreciating that because let's just think about it it's not that christ didn't have the power to do the miracles it's not that he did not have the power to do many many mighty works and it's not that unbelief is greater than god and it's not that their unbelief was just so great that he couldn't overcome it but it wouldn't have been right for christ to do it it wouldn't have been appropriate for him to operate god's power under those conditions if i could just give a quick contrast an example as christ is passing through the crowd and through this press there's one that kind of touches just the hem of his garment and his attention is caught and he and and jesus uh when he's looking at this woman he begins to have a conversation with her and she's like oh i i need this heal and he says well i'm not sent but to the lost sheep of israel and she's saying well even the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table jesus was kind of throwing things out there that would have been a barrier to her he's saying things to suggest i'm just wanting to reference it very quickly this might be something that to her could just signal oh well i'll just go ahead and leave but what was it she declared a faith and she expressed something that went past anything that might seem to be hindering anything that might have been telling her to go the other way and it expanded the borders of faith and god says that's where i operate i operate within faith i operate within one that believes and so it's it wasn't it would have been right for christ to operate god's power in the presence of their offense in the presence of their unbelief that interesting to think that at any moment god could just come in our lives and completely change everything but he's a gentleman he's he's respectful of certain things he's mindful of certain things he he uses wisdom that it's not just all about accomplishing it but it's how you accomplish it there's things that god could do right now in our lives as god who can just do things and he and he could do it and since he's god and he does it in a way that only god can without us knowing us without us realizing in a supernatural way you realize if we if he did it the way we want him to we would never know he was god things would just happen things would just take place and you'd never see the fingerprints of god in it and so the bible says that they were offended in him the word means to put a stumbling block in someone's way to put an impediment in the way means to cause to stumble or to fall what was it that was a barrier they there was a barrier to them something they tripped over something they stumbled over now this is where it kind of gets you say well brother aaron which was it a boundary or a barrier where there was a boundary but it became a barrier if you think about it there are barriers to those in nazareth were the natural flesh of christ you see they just see a man i look in this guy and they say well we know your dad we know your mom we know your brothers we know your sisters and so it was his natural flesh it was his family history it was things they knew about him and their processes we know when you were born we know what the rumors were about your birth we know about this we know about that there's all these things that they begin to ponder and contemplate and it's those things that became the offense and it hindered them from seeing god and flesh here's the father standing amongst them and they're unable to see them because of all these things that are in the way and that to them was a barrier now to that i want you to just keep that in mind the barrier of the flesh the barrier of the way it's being presented the way the buried in a sense it's being manifested but god's boundary because to god this is the boundary god's boundary is his word and he operates on the principle of faith so that's where god works if you're going to find god working you're going to find god moving it's going to be within the framework of his word according to faith you can have the word there's your boundaries but it takes faith to ignite it there's something that quickens it so anything out of bounds won't work so here's christ he has the power he's present he's there he's teaching wonderful things it says in the bible that when he was teaching there was power there to heal them all and so what does it take to operate it then it takes faith so there's a boundary of god's word and if there's anything out of bounds god won't work there so this is where we we could take from this even though it says they they he did not do many mighty works because of their unbelief we have to recognize unbelief does not hinder god it hinders the unbeliever jesus didn't need the mighty works for himself he didn't need it to prove who he was as a matter of fact he's tempted many times to prove who you are if thou be the son of god and and show out for us and who hit you and who did this and they're always wanting him to clown around but god doesn't clown around for the devil and so unbelief doesn't hinder god it only stops the unbelievers so unbelief was a barrier to the unbeliever because god only works within the boundaries of faith in his word brother brown makes the statement in presume and he said sin lays beyond the boundaries of god's word to disbelieve one iota of it god will let you set there so you have the boundaries of god's word if you disbelieve you find yourself out of bounds and as long as you're in unbelief god will just let you stay there so your unbelief becomes the barrier unbelief becomes the hindrance but faith is what will bring remove the obstacle for entrance into the word of god to experience whatever it is god is promising for you so this is ponder this think about this focus very intent on this there is a dividing line this has been very helpful for me in pondering the difference between barriers and boundaries because there's a lot of times brother brown talks about denominational barriers and barriers that hinder fellowship and so we see one side well there's things that man has created that keeps people from being together but then you find another hand there's boundaries that god establishes to keep people apart and so the you say well how do we navigate that identify what are barriers and identify what are boundaries in second corinthians chapter 6 verse 17 says wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you it's an if then statement if you will come out from among them and be separate and touch not the unclean thing then i will receive you separate means to mark off by boundaries it means to limit if you will be limited if you'll be separated if you'll be marked off by boundaries it means to be set apart for a purpose then i will receive you so think of the boundaries that we're trying to establish god's boundaries what he relates to what he identifies in and how he makes himself known he makes himself known within the word of god brother brahm says in the message perseverance and i would actually recommend perseverant perseverance this this sermon as a as one to listen to as we've been drawn a lot from perseverance and humble thyself it says examine your revelation with the word if it's contrary to the word leave it alone if it's with the word god is bound duty bound to keep his word now so what is god bound to he's bound to his word he's not bound to your whims he's not bound to oh show me a sign he's not bound to do this and do that god is duty bound to his word that's the those are the borders and the boundaries that he's responsible over he is he he loves to be held to his word he loves to prove his word he he is obligated to his word god is bound to his word anything outside of his word he's not responsible for so in matthew 13 the prophet is he says a prophet is not without honor and except in his own country and in his own house and the people were offended it says he's not able to perform miracles because of their unbelief unbelief was a barrier to them but faith in the word of god is the boundary that god works within now if you turn to john chapter 1 verses 43 to 50 i appreciate your attention this morning in john chapter 1 verses 43 to 50 it says the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me now philip was a bethsaida the city of andrew and peter philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did right now this is remarkable speaking of the messiah prophet liken unto me jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth so those in nazareth didn't think any good thing could come from that family those outside of nazareth didn't think any good thing could come from nazareth and says philip sayeth unto him wonderful words perfect words come and see we should make that part of our vocabulary not always try to make people see tell them to come and sing come and see the mighty works of god that's what it says on psalm come and see what god has done just come and see what he is doing come and see jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith to him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile this that instance did more than all the explaining philip could have done just that moment in his presence the word of god affecting in his heart discerning his needs in that opportunity there that he said just come and see and and he comes says behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile nathanael said unto him when's knowest thou me and jesus answered and said to him before that philip called thee when thou was under the fig tree i saw thee now that had significance to nathaniel that got his attention he's saying now this is something before i was called by philip this whatever it was whatever this uh instance was it got his attention and now just in this simple exchange behold an israelite in whom there's no guile and he says well how do you know me before philip called thee i saw you when you were under the fig tree just this simple instance nathanael answers and says unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel when you go later into matthew chapter 13 later in jesus ministry he's doing a lot more profound things than this he is expounding more he's doing more a lot more is being expressed and declared but yet nathanael's just able to say thou art the son of god. this is a remarkable statement thou art the king of israel and jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee unto the fig tree believeth thou because you believe this sign because you believe you truly believe that uh this this manifestation this expression he says just because i saw thee and i said i saw you under the fig tree you believe he says thou shalt see greater things than these but nathanael's already a believer he didn't need the greater things to believe but because his was quickened and faith was already quick and he's now within the boundaries of god's word he's now operating with the framework of the prophecy his eyes have already been opened and now that his eyes are open he's going to see greater things now christ can do greater things but other people not see greater things what was happening in matthew 18 ah well he's a he's a nazarene and he's of joseph and he's of mary and we know his brothers we know his children or we know his sisters we know what's going on here and they weren't impressed they were offended just one little miracle to nathanael and he's so impressed by that that he's quick and to to faith he's quickened to believe he and if i could put it this way because you truly believe you'll see greater things and if i could put it in this context nathanael could see greater things because he recognized god and simplicity because he could just recognize a simple manifestation of scripture because he could recognize god operating in the flesh of christ he he was he was a candidate he was in the position he was in the place to see greater things because if you're a skeptic no amount of proof is going to convince you hey someone was explaining something to me the other day and i think they kind of misrepresented they referenced the kafka effect and i don't think that's the effect they're actually thinking about and i don't know exact effect it's supposed to be but you know when someone believes something and you try to convince them it's not true your efforts to convince them it's not true is like they think that's the proof that it is true right well if this wasn't if this wasn't true you wouldn't be trying to convince me it's not right like how come none of us know where the illuminati is right because they want it that way and and so there's just a way where it's like circular reason and there's no way you can convince them and walk them out of it if somebody is is against something someone's offended then no matter what you do you don't see it for what it is and so on one hand you have people that could christ could be doing greater things and there's the skeptics there's the critics there there's the scoffers and the mockers but yeah here's a nathaniel that's going to see the greater things because he has faith the nazarenes couldn't see the mighty works because they stumbled at the simplicity of god's glory here was god in simplicity and they stumbled at it they couldn't enjoy it they couldn't appreciate it now there maybe this is a lot of scripture reading a lot of commentary to make this point but in order to understand god's greatness they needed to see how small he could become people want to worship a god that's huge and expansive and great and all-knowing and all-powerful but yet they don't they don't want to recognize him and how he manifest himself in order to begin to understand god's greatness as nathanael was going to see the greater things his ability to see the greater things started in just a very small thing and to begin to understand god's greatness you have to first be able to recognize how small he can become the omnipotent omniscient omnipresent god who fills all time in space but is bound in his word and binds himself to his word now if you could just continue to concentrate your spirit and just focus very intently i'm wanting you to ponder in your own life the barriers that keep you from seeing the supernatural now in first kings chapter 19 and i had to veer i had to kind of divide my sermon in half and maybe next sunday we'll get to the part that i thought i would get to today but it's on humility actually it was the original title was perfect pride chew on that for a little bit perfect pride now we think recognizing barriers and boundaries is still at the focus here in first kings chapter 19. can you give me a loud amen all right okay good first kings chapter 19 verses 9 to 13. elijah has escaped from jezebel he's very discouraged he's uh he's under a juniper tree and he's uh even expresses his desire to die and he's very honest about this something they've been pondering quite a bit that uh we we have to be very i'm just just going to say we have to be very careful that we don't create the kind of climate where people can't be honest because they're afraid that if they're honest it's going to cause us to think oh they don't believe anymore they don't have faith and really it's a barrier that we got to overcome and it's a barrier that we don't want to create and elijah is honest he says it's enough i don't want to live i know better than my father's he's he's he's very uh weakened the journey's too great for me and the bible says that god sent the angel with the softest hands to minister to him now verse nine it says and he came elijah now has arisen and he goes under the of the mount of god and he comes thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou hear elijah so god's now speaking to elijah now elijah in his honesty he's honest before god he says he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of host for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword now that's a elijah's recognizing how they've abandoned god they've violated his precepts and they've broken the covenant of god and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said now god speaks go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord so now this is god's response to his anxiety and his fear his assessment of the situation we recognize later that he didn't have it exactly right he wasn't the only one that was still standing for god but god tells him to go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord i hope that you're focusing and concentrating it says and behold the lord passed by now god told him to go stand upon the mount before the lord so he told him go to this place and as you're standing there you're going to be in the presence of god you're going to stand before god and behold the lord does indeed pass by now recognize that he elijah is in a place where he needs something from god he needs encouragement he needs strength he's been very jealous for god he recognizes the forsaken of god's covenant he's come through this escaping from jezebel he's been very discouraged and and a broken man with the broken spirit and god is going to come he's going to present himself and says and the lord passed by and i know you know the story so just if you could just uh ponder this and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break and pieces the rocks before the lord so god it says the lord passed by the lord's there and at his presence a strong wind runs the mountain and it breaks it into pieces and elijah's witnessing this and it says but the lord was not in the wind after the wind an earthquake now it doesn't describe what is actually happening when the earthquakes but we could imagine that if the wind was breaking rocks from their places that the earthquake was registering something that was felt but it says and the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire so you've had wind earthquake and you've had a fire and it says but the lord was not in the fire now we could put ourselves in elijah's shoes if we were there we would have had a revival at the wind we we had another one at the earthquake we had another one at the fire and we would have set up a church of the earth wind and fire church and we would have had something to to recognize this and to give honor to this and we would have been caught up in all the natural things happening around us great things significant things things of depth and magnitude and shakings and and rattlings but it says the lord is not in the wind the earthquake or fire and after the fire after the wind after the earthquake after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it when elijah heard the still small voice that he wrapped his face in his mantle and he went out and stood in the entering in of the cave it's then that elijah's moved it's then that elijah reacts and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou hear elijah that was god's hello we say what's up god's with elijah says what does thou hear elijah that was his greeting for elijah that's how he knew who it was what doest thou hear elijah and now we'll we'll just stop at that point because i've set the the picture hopefully the scriptures have painted this picture of how god declares that he's going to make himself known elijah come and present yourself before the lord in the mount and then a wind comes an earthquake comes and the fire comes and god's presence is there but what those are are the effects of his presence they're clearly an effect of his presence and there was a way to measure it you could measure the wind speed you could measure the magnitude of the earthquake you could have certain uh movements you could measure speed and movements and and the magnitude and the scales and all the different things that you could try to come with the categories of the wind there was a way that man could quantify and somehow measure what god was doing on that mountain well the wind was at so many knots or it was at this speed or the wind was a direct wind of 80 miles per hour it was an earthquake of a 7.6 on the rick six on the richter scale it was a 12 alarm fire however it was they would try to find some way to describe what god was doing why because men like to measure one of the funniest single panel cartoons i ever saw as it said the problem with all male juries and what was depicted is these men in the jury box building the gallows they had their saws out in the hammers and they were already getting ready to hang the hang the defendant because that's what men like to like to measure they like to build they like to see the progress they like things to be great but in all these great things god wasn't in them and what's if you could i'm sure you've heard this before but it says we know that he was in the still small voice because he's not moved by the wind not moved by the earthquake he doesn't cover himself with the earthquake he doesn't cover himself at the fire he hears a still small voice and when elijah heard that something he was in tune to it's then that he grabs his self and he covers himself the words that are used for still it's whisper calm a calm voice a whisper and then small it means fine like thin or gaunt this isn't something very robust what was it that stumbled about jesus he was he was a weak man he was an uncomely man he was a man in his 30s and they thought he was around 50. a still small fine thin gaunt voice that's what moved elijah elijah was not moved by the other things regardless of how moving they would be regardless of how fearful they would be surely god's going to make himself known in an earthquake surely this is the way god moves in a wind but those none of those things enticed him he was told to go to a particular place and stand before the presence of the lord and god is moving he's exciting things and things are happening but none of those enticed him to cover himself and present himself at the face of the cave because we could we could say this for sure the lord caused the wind he caused the quake he caused the fire but he was only found in the voice a lot of things that were the effect of his presence but he was only found in his word he was only found in the voice why because that's where god hides himself i want to show something to you in this slide here and what you're looking at is on th to the left is the cover this is what brother george and sister rebecca smith i published for many years called the only believe magazine and it was from the june 1993 issue volume six number two i know some of you probably were reading it yesterday but uh it's on the very back of this volume is what i have it's it was printed on the very back is what's on the right here i don't know if you could read it but i'm going to read it to you but these were taken this was printed here from brother branham's handwritten notes for a sermon entitled the glory of the lord and brother branham took you know he wrote out his sermons in some instances very specific precise things that he wants to wanted to share and i was amazed to find out that very few of his sermon notes preserved or they've been able to find but this was a sermon he never preached but he had this handwritten notes that they had had kept i think the on display at the den there in tucson for many years but notice what brother bannon wrote he says notice him elijah in the cave the oneness storm billy graham earth shaking campaigns oral roberts the pentecostal rushing wind never moved the prophet as i did to find great moves great manifestations it's the effects of his presence it's god doing these things but what's going to move the prophet catch what he says they were only a facts of his passing by but what attracted the prophet elijah it was the glory of his voice word revealing his glory plans now if we read we read still small voice still whisper calm gaunt thin voice and yet it's described as the glory of his voice word on one hand it doesn't seem profound on one hand it doesn't seem remarkable on one hand it's a quiet whisper it's finn it's gaunt it's frail it seems weak but yet from another perspective it is the glory of his voice word elijah recognized the glory of something very small it's the glory of his voice word revealing his glory plans he says the prophet waited on his office we could take that to ourselves there's something there's a place that we're called there's something that we're to do and we're to be active in it and faithful in it and not to vary from it in other words the prophet wasn't moved by winds he wasn't moved by earthquakes he wasn't moved by fires he knew that for him he had to hear the voice of god in order to move the prophet waited on his office and then notice as a type not long then to the rapture this is instructive to us he said he was only nearing the wind earthquake fire etc the man of god waited for manifested reality vindicated word abiding glory our remarkable words what remarkable words to ponder that what attracted elijah was something still small but yet it was the voice of god no matter how much of a whisper no matter how thin or gaunt since it was the word it got his attention this i hope that you're pondering and i've been using that word a lot today pondering i hope you're thinking about the barriers to seeing the supernatural because what are we somehow programmed something great and and we can all blame uh apple for this right is it john ives is he was he the designer there for many years that produced things that are so highly polished and well made and and it's just it's eye candy right it's like iphone i want eye candy yes because it looks good and it's pleasing to the eye and it's presented in a certain certain way and i'm not presenting it as the forbidden fruit even though it is an apple with a bite out of it but there's something that we're wired to want to mention it before and this is kind of where we're hopefully getting into we're wired to compare and we're measuring ourselves by what other things appear to be to us and in each one of these instances if you think about it there's certain mechanisms that people are judging things by in measuring things by and looking for god wanting to see god but yet in the framework of it god is only known a particular way and in in the example in first kings 19 we have to be honest with ourselves what would get our attention something big something flashy something engaging something very inviting maybe something that satisfies and checks the box socially or checks the bosch the box emotionally things that that would be pleasing to the flesh but elijah recognized god in his word now this may seem to be a paradox the way i'm going to describe this and i'm just turning my corner here to to get to my clothes we'll have power over barriers by recognizing and respecting the boundaries of god's word the only way we're truly going to have power over barriers we'll have power over barriers when we recognize and respect the boundaries of god's word just as elijah he waited on his office he stayed in his place the only way that we're going to overcome berries is know where our place is now let me just put it this way if you know you're not in your place but you're called to it and if there's something keeping you from it then you know that's something you have to get over to get there but once you're in your place you want to keep your place and if there's things trying to call you out of your place then you recognize no there's a boundary this is where i belong this is what i'm called to i can't i can't i can't be pulled out from this place elijah was going there on that mountain in order to have an audience with god and if he would have ran after the wind and chased the wind trying to find the source of the wind where are these rocks leading me if he tried to divine something in the tea leaves as it were as the earth was quake was shaking if he tried to figure something out and if i stare long enough at the fire maybe i'll recognize the word he would have been he would have been out of place and if i could put it in this context or if i hope that this makes sense to you because i like to say it this way the devil wants the word of god to appear to us very differently than what it really is he wants the word of god to look like bondage so here we are we're we're free we can make choices we can live as we want we live in a society where we have rights we can exercise those rights and so what he wants what's the word to become is we want he wants us to look at the word as something that's limiting something that restrains us and i recognize that the bible christianity even the words of christ or we can say the word of god has been used to abuse people it's been used to marginalize certain sections of society whether it be races or ethnicities or gender it's been used to justify evil it's been used to bind people come on somebody all you got to do is be take an honest look at church history and honest look at history and people have bible thumped to commit many many atrocities and so the the word of god and christianity in that sense carries a scarlet letter and for a lot of people maybe it's triggering because christ has been used for um for ungodly things and i recognize that the word of god has been used to abuse and to hinder and restrain and to control but god's word is liberating and it's truth it's liberating it's truth it's freedom you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free we use the example quite a bit here that israel wanted freedom from the romans but what was greater than freedom from the romans was freedom from sin freedom from self and the word of god provides that a man free from sin can live in just about any condition but man wants to remedy just about any condition and not worry about sin but the word of god is so liberating the word of god is so liberating that once you get into the word of god and the word starts unfolding and the word starts breaking upon your heart and you start taking responsibility for the things that god has given you responsibility over and you start living according to the precepts of the word of god and it gets richer and richer to you the less politics means to you the less you're worried about controlling everybody else and we're voting for this and uh being an activist for that and campaigning for this and campaigning for that why because you're free from it but satan paints a false image there's a phrase i think that's used quite often these days is people being uncomfortable in their own skin you don't think the devil wants to make you feel uncomfortable he wants you to feel uncomfortable so that he could present to you a remedy for it i've got something for that you don't you don't feel like that's the real you you don't feel like you feel uncomfortable he's like he's got a way to try to make you fit and find your place but the only place you're going to find liberty is in the word of god and when god has boundaries those boundaries are not for the purpose of being controlled boundaries are not for the purpose of being constrained but for the purpose of operating true power god had a boundary in matthew 13 that when he he's standing there with power to heal them all he does not cross the boundary of faith into unbelief if you don't believe he's not going to operate he's going gonna let you stay there in unbelief if i could say it this way it means it may seem odd to put it this way but out of respect for your unbelief well if you don't believe i'm not gonna force myself on you i'm not gonna force this issue so it hinders the unbeliever it's a barrier to the unbeliever and so god's word it's with it has boundaries so that true power can operate now in genesis chapter two some of you probably thinking how in the world is he gonna get to genesis chapter two well you just go there right you don't have to try to make it fit you just go there and people like oh yeah that's his text genesis chapter 2 verses 16 and 17 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it from the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die i know we're very familiar with the scripture reading it's not something that is strange to us when we read it if you read in the creation uh in the very precise words that moses uses if it grew out of the ground it was good for food it's what the bible says and god reiterates of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat if it grows out of the ground it's good for food but there's a tree of the knowledge of good and evil that they're not to eat of and so we could take it scripturally and recognize that this is not your typical tree or your literal tree that grew from the ground and god declares we recognize it's in symbolism and it's used in ways to convey to us uh certain things and certain truths it says but in that day that you eat of that tree you're going to die and so god's not playing a trick on us if it grows from the ground it's good for food you can eat it but then if you eat it and you die it must not be growing from the ground that's just taking it directly from the bible now we know that man was made in the image of god we find these things just being expressed very near to this scripture and he was given power to subdue and have dominion over the earth genesis 1 26 let them have dominion over all the earth and as you read it over every living thing this is god now creating man in the image of god and they're to have dominion over all the earth and over every living thing so in one way we're reading about adam wow adam's being placed on earth and everything is his he can he's to subdue the earth he's to multiply he's to fill it up he's to subdue it he's had the dominion over it he's to control everything he has power over all the other kingdoms he is at the highest order and he can control all nature he's given power and he's given wisdom to name all creatures and all creation he can take of any herb any fruit he even has a power over the animals the whole world was his you heard the phrase the world your oyster the world was adam's oyster the entire thing every bit of it it was his he can live in it he could control it but then this is an odd scripture genesis 2 16 and 17. you're just you have power to subdue you you could take anything you can have anything you want but then god's boundary line is set in genesis chapter 2 verses 16 and 17 this is god's boundary line for man and the woman and if you read everything god has said to this point and even some of the things you read afterwards you'd think well this seems to limit adam's power adam you can have everything you want except adam you have power to subdue everything but this and you have unlimited power except it is limited that's not how when we read it it might seem to limit his power might just seem to kind of restrict his life or or to reduce his dominion but it's not doing it in any way i want you to i i hope that you can think about this again i keep saying it over focus ponder concentrate think about these things that what might seem to take adam's domain and his jurisdiction and shrink it up it had nothing to do with limiting his power this was not a boundary intending to limit man's ability this was not a boundary he intended to handcuff adam and it wasn't meant to limit his ability to subdue and have dominion but it was meant it was placed there in order to keep man in his place the boundary was set there god's boundary line was put there in order that man would stay in his place in order to fulfill all his potential he's given a command multiply and replenisher be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth subdue it have dominion over it do all this but he had to stay who he was and he had to he had to remain with his wife under the word of god and the woman in order to fulfill the word of god he couldn't step outside of the framework that god had established and fulfill his purpose remember god is the god of order and when god is creating and the world is without form and it's it's void i'm glad i brought the notes from wednesday night let's stand let's read from genesis chapter one we'll just re-preach wednesday night god is a god of order and he he he's gonna bring uh structure and formation out of chaos and he moves the seas to one side and he brings up the dry land and he hangs the moon in the sky and it's gonna stand there's the watchdog and it's going to have a power and exert a force to control tides in order to keep ecosystems working and the bible tells us that god told the ocean stop you can only go so far he's a god of boundaries he told each seed to bring forth of its kind he he described things in a particular way he says you're herb yielding seed you're a fruit-bearing seed you're this animal you're this plant everybody stay in your lane stay in your place bring forth of your kind and everything will operate perfectly and so man had to do the same thing in order for god's kingdom to flourish this was god's wisdom it wasn't like god just dumped a bunch of materials out there and said yeah adam hey whatever you want to do man whatever you want to do and think about all the different places where god asks men to build something to do something and how precise god gets have you ever read the construction of the temple the tabernacle in the wilderness i mean the rings and the colors and and the everything it's like this is this is home interiors before there was home interiors i mean this is detailed this is precise it's like god didn't say hey just build me a box man make it seven by seven by seven just give me a place to hang uh and and it'll all be good he's so detailed i want it's measured so much i want it made with this kind of wood he didn't say hey no build me a boat make it big he gave him all the details here's the blueprints here are the materials pitch it with this build it this wide build it this one because god is a god of precision it got a details well why did it have to be that way he knew what it would take to float he knew what it would take to house the animals that he would ordain to be on that ark this is god's wisdom so when god told noah how to build the ark no good you're just ruining my fun i want to build a speedboat it's the wisdom of god and when he told adam adam whatever you do don't eat of that tree it wasn't i'm going why can't i have it why can't i have it i want to have that tree no there's a wisdom of god saying if you want to be who you are you want to fulfill my word you want to live happy you never want to die don't do it that's what we start telling our kids you wanna live huh you wanna you don't wanna die then don't do it son are you threatening to kill me well implications it's intended to keep a man in that spot where god could bless him to keep him from that place in matthew 13 of offense mighty works unable to be done so in genesis chapter 3 verses 1 to 6 it says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made is such a jerking the needle off the record like what like we're just reading creation it's wonderful man and the women are both naked and not ashamed was now the serpent was because this is where it gets real more subtle than any of the filled with the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent now i want you to consider boundaries and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden she even knows there's a difference right god said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die a lot of commentators note the curious edition of neither shall you touch it because it's not mentioned before and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die there's your lie but then notice how he frames it for god doth know that in the day he eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened he shall be as gods knowing good and and this is all it took in that moment she believed the devil's lie over god's word and in that moment what does she do she steps across a boundary immediately she stepped across a boundary and the woman saw that the tree was good for food it wasn't you eat it you die it's not good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes when it speaks of the trees of the garden being pleasant to the sight it means it looks like it's good to eat but here the very phrase pleasant to the eyes means she lusted has nothing to do with oh that's that pie looks good has something to do with inner spirits she was lusting and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave all so under a husband with her and he did eat i'd like to spend more time on this but this is not the focus of our sermon but this is the description of the original sin put uh in just very simplistic terms it's a disturbance of god's original plan god had an order he had a program he had everything in its place and this was a disturbance of god's original order and in do and what happened is there was a transgression of boundaries look as seen in the allegory of here's a fruit you can't eat it god's saying you can eat everything you want but this now just in that simple allegory god had placed a boundary that you're not to eat of this fruit now there's a lot of people that sincerely believe that god just put this really good looking piece of fruit in the middle of the garden just said you can eat everything you want except that really nice looking apple right there like does that not look good don't you want to eat that but don't right if you don't want someone to look at something don't say don't look now but because what's the first thing you're gonna do what and so god's not tempting them that's not how god works god's not trying to abate them into transgression he's not like now don't touch it but you want to touch it don't you but don't you you want to don't you don't do it that's not how god is he's expressing something about his order he's expressing something about his character he's expressing something about the seeds he's expressing something about his his characteristics and so he's he's showing them that this is your bounds this is what you're made to do this is how you're made to bring forth you're to create and and to bring forth according to my word in my time in my season and you're not to do it in any other way it's god defining the parameters of the expression of the word of god and what happened is the man and the woman transgressed god's boundary there was a transgression there was a mixing and think of it this way now one thing to kind of uh maybe help to think about this discourse the woman is talking to the serpent and talking to the serpent it might not have been a strange thing for them to have a conversation with the serpent so it's not like the devil you know he he wore a red suit with a fork towel and a pitchfork and started speaking in a very you know evil voice to her and she should have been shocked and pearl clutching and ran away this is this is the conversation with the serpent but who's animating him who's inspiring the serpent doesn't respect boundaries what was satan trying to do he was trying to tear down a boundary and this enticement to the woman if you think about it versus what elijah did on the in mount horeb this enticement beyond beyond a boundary was death go beyond this border is not life it's death one thing i find that when it comes to god's word the only thing for you on the other side of god's word is judgment once you've crossed the bounds of god's word once you've crossed the borders of god's word once you've crossed the boundary of god's word it's judgment consequence this is what we need to be learning as christians why is it i'm suffering why is there a consequence well when you cross god's word there's a consequence if you're in god's word and you're suffering there's a purpose right if you're outside of god's word there's a consequence we're recognizing that one there's a boundary of god's word there's a boundary of god's blessing there's a way that god's saying you can all there's you can't go past that my blessings won't extend beyond that now if i could just uh try to summarize this by just making this story even uh amplifying it more to you as the serpent is speaking to the woman satan is making the case to the woman and the serpent presents to the woman god presents god's word to the woman as a barrier can you catch that think about how he described him he's saying that that oh no you're not going to die in other words you can eat this and live so what became a barrier to her eating that was this thought that she was gonna die so if he could just somehow remove this thought oh you're not gonna die no he just said that to you to keep you from eating it but you're not really gonna die so he took the word of god that said you would die which would have formed a boundary and he makes the woman see it as a barrier he said he now she's looking at as an obstacle like wait a minute i i should eat this i have no reason not to because if i eat it i'm not gonna die i'm actually become more wise and i'm a no good from evil and he's and it's presented to her like god knows that too so he's trying to keep you from it he's trying to borrow you from he's put up an obstacle so now what god put as a boundary for the woman to stay in her place and become the means by which the earth would be multiplied she that adam's seed would multiply bring forth another son of god in the image of adam and to to fill up the earth and fulfill god's purpose in the earth she's now that was a boundary of the promise satan's got her to view it as a barrier and god hiding himself in simplicity brother bam says and he fortified the church by the word his own word he just asked them to believe his word that's all there was and satan by his own wisdom caused eve to break down that barrier just in one place now in a moment i'll express it in this way i'll kind of expound upon it but now god brother branham says that eve broke down a barrier in just one place you mean what does it matter if just one thing just one thing well it's there for a purpose the woman now he caused the woman to break down that barrier the woman was made to see the word as a barrier so then what do you do if it's a barrier you get past it if it's a barrier you want to break through it if it's a barrier you want to turn it tear it down i'll just use it in the next service hopefully or next couple services i can run through a troop and leap over a wall by my god in the image of god i'm made to overcome barriers i'm made to overcome obstacles i can i can run through it i can leap over it i can i can fly over it tunnel through it whatever it takes i can get beyond it why because with the spirit of god in me i'm made to conquer i'm made to overcome but the boundaries of god's word are what you exist within that's your reality those are your bounds that's that's that's where life is but the woman is made to see the word not as a boundary that she exists within but now she's her understanding is perverted so now she sees it as a barrier so she broke past the boundary thinking it's a barrier and what does she tumble into sin she's deceived into thinking that the word was a limit it was restricting it was something holding her back in the message the seventh seal brother bam says satan and his angels were kicked out and then they come to the earth and the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier for where she was isolated behind the word of god something that was protecting or something keeping her and from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the god subject the weaker let down the bar so i think the language he's using is beautiful because it's painted the picture that god's word or if i say this god's boundary was a protection for the woman and a barrier to satan the word was there as a boundary for the for the creation to live within in safety and harmony and everything perfect and so that was a boundary for the woman but what did satan view it as a barrier what was a boundary for the woman was a barrier to satan it was barring him it was keeping him out and she let down the bar to her it's a boundary but once she goes beyond the boundary saying like that was the only thing keeping me away that was the only thing keeping me from you remember this for next time boundaries marks your marked jurisdictions whether it be a city whether it be a a piece of property or a government uh jurisdiction is what is the extent of one's power a boundary says my power comes to this far when you when you pas when some of you if you told me your stories you pass a cop on the freeway and you know you're just coming up to buckeye and you're just leaving phoenix like if i could just get to the boundary line he can't follow me here well i don't even know if you really know the law on that so don't drive too fast they might have just caused to follow you but there's because we have in this mind well the cops his authority is only good to this line and your authority is only good to this and what department are you in oh you're in marketing well i'm in sales you don't have any control over me right and i'm marketing rc glow and you can't stop me there's a there's a there's these boundaries that people want to cross and pass and say oh i can't i can't i don't have authority that's not in my jurisdiction that's not in my department that's not under my purview some people said i i don't i don't i'm not paid enough that's not that's not in my salary that's not what i'm asked to do just think of it in those terms that someone the extent of one's power and authority and responsibility satan is whispering to her trying to get her to step out of sight of her authority oh my as i see the picture in my mind he can only have access to the woman if she crossed god's boundary line he can only walk up and down the boundary he could only look in and he i can't get there and and the and the serpent may be being inspired by devil hey you should go do some dirty work he's like how in the world am i going to do it there's nothing i can do i've been made a particular way this is who i am i can't do anything about it and he knew the only way he could ever get access is to get hurt across god's boundary line it's in the masterpiece brother man says by deceit he crawls under the garden walls and then he marred this beautiful masterpiece why is that image used because for satan the boundary was a barrier keeping him out it was an obstacle saying you can't do this you can't go that far in the message the seat of discrepancy now this harvest time at the beginning because it's it's orienting us the harvest time we're in now comparison to the beginning when god sowed his seed upon the earth and gave it in the hearts of his children his family to keep the word that was their only defense keep that word here come the enemy in and broke that barrier by sowing the seeded discrepancy contrary to the word of god if that was discrepancy in the beginning it's still anything that will add to it that'll add anything to the word of god is still the seed of discrepancy i don't care where it comes from let this sink in if it's from organization if it's from military sources if it's from political powers this is my commentary your favorite blog or your homeschool form or whatever it is think about it it doesn't matter if it's from military sources political powers especially if it's from facebook anything that's contrary to the word of god is the seat of discrepancy why is it as believers were so quickly drawn sides by things that have nothing to do with the word of god the devil's just over there trying to get us offside trying to get us to jump trying to get us to move guys god's given us something perfect to enjoy god's given us perfect peace perfect understanding perfect love he's given us everything in perfection he's given us the word of god to enjoy and we're always like huh what and we're drawing all sides to other things and we're led astray why because if the devil can just get us outside the boundaries of the word of god he can wreak havoc in our minds and in our thoughts doesn't matter if it's organization military political anything that's contra the word of god is the seed of discrepancy why god bro the the the devil uses the seeds of discrepancy to tear down the boundaries and satan wants us go ahead brother micah brother mike if you could come satan wants us he wants us if he can accomplish one thing he wants us to perceive god's word boundary as a barrier to entice us to break it down the boundary defined adam's responsibility and it it just it defined the limits of god's protective covenant god's covenant with them wasn't wow hey you're my son do whatever you want have at it hey yeah that's not what i wanted that wasn't my original plan but just do whatever you want god had a covenant he had made with them and free moral agency gave the woman an opportunity to go outside of god's boundary it's amazing to think that god put everything in its place and gave them a power and really for most most of creation and if i could say all of creation there was only one way they could act by the life that was inside of them you look at plant life and it still exists today that there's a life in that seed and it's going to follow the the the circuits of nature to to manifest fruit and to go back into the ground and grow again germinate pollinate express fruit and it's in a cycle that god has set in course and the only way that that could be interrupted if something comes along and interrupts it it's amazing to think that god places everything in this fine tuned creation but then the man and the woman are given a choice if anything that's what's expressed in genesis chapter 2 is you can if you want right [Music] right i mean genesis chapter two he's basically saying you can but you shouldn't i that we i think it's a little uh pedant in our home but whenever the kids say can i we don't we're very strict i don't know if we're borrowing from the oxford style or what i i support the oxford comma in our home school and rub some feathers with those who don't agree with the oxford comma but we can be sticklers about you don't say can i when you want permission it's may i but we understand that can is used i'm not establishing any kind of order you can say can all you want but what what's the distinction saying can speaks of ability but may speaks of permission god wasn't giving them permission god was saying don't do it you must not do it because if you do there's a consequence but in telling him not to he's indicating to us they can isn't that amazing have you ever thought about it and you really began to think wow god didn't just keep them from it let's be honest if we were god like we would hid the tree it would have been a 900-foot tree the fruit would have been the very top and adam couldn't fly couldn't build a ladder like you know what you shouldn't eat that and i just put some where you couldn't even get to it and god just doesn't work that way and we know he did it so that the plan of redemption could unfold but he put the man and the woman in a position to where they had to respect the boundary and they had a choice to cross it and as soon as they crossed it there was a consequence see god's a god of boundaries just chapter one and two god establishes boundaries establishes relationships give gives them responsibility in genesis chapter three it's trespassed god's boundary is brother man says in marriage and divorce she broke the covenant because she stepped across the borders of god's word she was able she was able to step across the borders of god's word god didn't put her in a straight jacket and chain her in binder and she's in a chain well i can't i can't really go beyond this point he didn't do it she had she was a free-more agent who can make a decision that could have consequences and she stepped across the borders of god's word now if you go to the new testament you find paul says i'm afraid that as the serpent beguiled eve he tells the corinthians your minds might be beguiled from the simplicity that is in christ the same devil that deceived then is the same devil that's working now trying to corrupt us from the simplicity that is in christ and peter writes in second peter 3 17 ye therefore beloved seeing you know these things before beware lest he also be led away with the air of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness fall from your place lose your footing being led away with the air of the wicked wandering led astray you have a path you have a lane you're to stay and you have something here to do he says i i beware be diligent be circumspect that you don't get led away and fall from your own steadfastness the things i'm speaking about are not to imply that you could ever lose your salvation but we're not just living to be saved right it's the fullness of salvation we're hungry for the fullness of redemption is the time that we're living in my final statement in the message oneness billy graham says today it's too bad to think this but the churches try to lean upon their own understanding just exactly like eve did she thought because it was presented to her it looked so real my goodness we're living the day and age where anything can be made to look real and authentic he says oh don't fail to get this it looked so real something that could be added to what god said this is the phrase that's so remarkable it looked like she had she have something that god hadn't told her just how far she could go it looked like she could go further it looked like god hadn't told her all the things that she could enjoy all the things that she could do it looked like there was something that god hadn't told her about that she could go further in he says god hadn't given her the boundary line like he had set the sea and it cannot pass because the moon watches it it looked like to her that the boundary wasn't exactly where she thought it was so what she originally perceived as a boundary she now sees as a barrier i that's those are the terminologies i'm using if you'd use a different one that's certainly fine with me but just catch the truth and the concept things changed her mind and now she's thinking oh god told me to stay in this place but there's more oh maybe there's more or maybe that doesn't matter maybe i can venture into this she thought that satan had something on the ball as we'd say he knew more that she could still be in union with god and yet be smarter she would have a better education but god had lauded her just exactly what she had need of can you believe that for yourself if you find yourself sometimes in your life looking around and seeing what everybody else has and you think oh my i really wish i could have that and you think of all the things that keep you from having it and you see them as barriers because that's what the devil wants you to see instead of it being god's protection god's keeping you from it god has a boundary there's a place he has a calling something he's called you too he says for the woman he had something he allotted her just exactly what she had needed everything the woman needed was at her disposal she didn't need anything else the grass wasn't greener on the other side and so for her she was in a position where she needed to recognize that what satan was trying to entice her into was to step across a boundary into unbelief and to suffer the consequences for it why because god had given her the bounds of the word of god satan wants us to perceive the boundary of the word as a barrier and just kind of bullhead right through it and stumble into unbelief and we don't want to make that mistake tate you ask god to give you discernment to recognize those things that god has placed there as boundaries as protections as limiters so that you can be blessed not that he can withhold things from you but so that you can be blessed oh and just take the reverse of it there are things that the devil wants you to think is a boundary but in reality it's a barrier to you experiencing what god has for you and you've got to recognize the barrier that satan has put in your way [Music] because it's his way of isolating you he's just put up all these barriers so he can kind of keep you isolated from the word of god because as soon as you as you could exist within that framework satan has you right where he wants you and wear you out in your mind anybody want to testify about a battle in the mind by show of hands yeah it's the greatest battle and it's getting worse why because that's the battleground that's why the battle's so hard in your mind if i could say anything to give you comfort this morning because to this point [Music] i don't know say anything to comfort you battles are fought in land that wants to be possessed and if there's not an opponent there's no fight and you're having a battle in your mind because that's the ground that satan chose and god's glad to take it and you're having a battle in your mind because the word is there doing battle and he's fighting and the battle is getting heavier and heavier but god's equipping you to win it and this concept of barriers and boundaries will help you because there's things that satan's trying to keep you barred from that god wants you to tear down and there's things that god never wants you to cross and if you feel like you're just going to hold your breath saying well i'm afraid to make a move don't be afraid god's with you let's stand
