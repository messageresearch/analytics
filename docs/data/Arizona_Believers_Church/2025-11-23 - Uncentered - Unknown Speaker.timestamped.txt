[0:00] the word which came to Jeremiah from the
[0:02] Lord, saying, "Arise, and go down to the
[0:04] potter's house, and there I will cause
[0:06] thee to hear my words." Then I went down
[0:09] to the potter's house, and behold, he
[0:11] wrought a work on the wheels. And the
[0:14] vessel that he made of clay was marred
[0:15] in the hand of the potter. So he made it
[0:17] again another vessel, as seemed good to
[0:19] the potter to make it. Then the word of
[0:21] the Lord came to me, saying, "Oh house
[0:23] of Israel, can I not do with you as this
[0:25] potter, sayeth the Lord? Behold, as the
[0:27] clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye
[0:29] in my hand, oh house of Israel. At what
[0:32] instant I shall speak concerning a
[0:34] nation, and concerning a kingdom, to
[0:36] pluck up, and to pull down, and to
[0:38] destroy it, if that nation against whom
[0:40] I have pronounced, turn from their evil,
[0:42] I will repent of the evil that I thought
[0:44] to do unto them. and at what instant I
[0:46] shall speak concerning a nation and
[0:48] concerning the kingdom to build and to
[0:50] plant it. If it do evil in my sight that
[0:52] it obey not my voice, then I will repent
[0:54] of the good wherewith I said I would
[0:57] benefit them. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:03] We ready?
[1:06] Okay. All right. Look at this. I'm going
[1:07] to be able to use my right arm tomorrow.
[1:10] Good thing I'm left-handed.
[1:13] uh if we need to switch it up just let
[1:14] me know. Uh my title today is uncentered
[1:18] and in using this phrase unentered
[1:20] you'll be able to just immediately begin
[1:22] to think along the lines as we have been
[1:25] uh speaking on using the example of
[1:28] ceramics and the use of clay and the
[1:30] molding of clay and doing it to
[1:32] understand what we are in God's process
[1:34] how God works on us even to some extent
[1:37] how that we are also potters and that we
[1:39] have responsibility over the things that
[1:40] we work on and the works of our hands we
[1:43] use the subject of unwaxed Next, we were
[1:46] thinking about um pottery as an example
[1:48] and how something must be sincere. The
[1:50] Bible says be sincere and and without
[1:54] blame or without offense. It's sincere
[1:56] and smooth is the idea that was
[1:58] represented there and use some types
[2:00] with respect to pottery. Then we used uh
[2:02] Wednesday night unglazed. And that had
[2:04] something to do with looking at this the
[2:06] man-made coverings that we use. Uh and
[2:09] not only that, but also don't be
[2:10] man-made glazed, but have God seal you
[2:14] in for his purpose. Now, with
[2:15] uncentered, there's a lot that we could
[2:18] explore here. I don't want to be lengthy
[2:20] and but there's just a lot that we can
[2:23] use on this subject. Jeremiah 18:6
[2:26] is God pronounced. We read this um here
[2:29] recently. Oh house of Israel, cannot I
[2:31] do with you as this potter saith the
[2:34] Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the
[2:36] potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand,
[2:39] oh house of Israel. So we can look at it
[2:41] this way that Israel was on God's will.
[2:44] God likens himself to a ceramicist who's
[2:46] working with clay from the earth and
[2:48] he's molding it. But the thing that is
[2:51] conveyed here and it's also conveyed in
[2:52] Isaiah. Paul picks it up in Romans is
[2:54] that the clay is subject to the potter's
[2:57] power. And so Israel being on the will
[3:00] is saying that you're subject to my
[3:02] power. I can mold you and make you. I
[3:04] can do with you whatever I want. That's
[3:06] the power that I have over the clay. So
[3:08] he says as uh the clay cannot respond to
[3:12] the potter. Uh uh and what can the clay
[3:14] say to the potter? So are you in my
[3:16] hands. And I would say we are all as
[3:19] believers God's clay. All of humanity is
[3:22] God's clay. Creation was made by God. So
[3:25] God has power of the clay to make it
[3:27] what he wants it to be. The verses that
[3:30] follow and proceed in verses 8 to 10, it
[3:34] does uh speak to the clay's response and
[3:37] the responsibility of the clay in that
[3:39] process. So God has power over the clay.
[3:42] What he wants it to be. Our job is to
[3:44] surrender to his design. that if God
[3:46] wants to do good, we we repent of our
[3:49] evil. If God is wanting to make us into
[3:52] something, we just simply yield to what
[3:54] he wants to make us. I want to um I want
[3:57] us to catch this image as I believe
[3:59] there's such a beautiful example in the
[4:02] art of uh making pottery to understand
[4:05] God and his relationship to us as
[4:07] vessels. In Jeremiah chapter 18, we're
[4:09] starting with verse one. We'll read to
[4:11] verse three. I want you to catch this
[4:12] image that God uses. The word which came
[4:14] to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
[4:16] "Arise and go down to the potter's
[4:19] house." That's not TD Jake's church.
[4:22] This is an actual potter's house. Go
[4:24] down to the potter's house, and there I
[4:26] will cause thee to hear my words. Then I
[4:29] went down to the potter's house. And
[4:31] behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.
[4:35] This isn't a DJ. This is he was writing
[4:38] a work on a a ceramic wheel, a pottery
[4:42] wheel. And at that time I was doing some
[4:45] reading and just trying to look at what
[4:46] this would uh what would an ancient
[4:48] pottery wheel look like and they would
[4:50] use a pair of circular stones and there
[4:52] would be one that would be fixed uh that
[4:55] would not be movable and then there
[4:56] would be another one placed on top of
[4:58] that. Uh you could think of even like a
[5:00] mill stone but this is what a potter's
[5:02] wheel would be. And the the the smaller
[5:04] stone placed upon that thick stone would
[5:06] be would move on an axis and sometimes
[5:09] with the the foot of the potter and they
[5:11] would cause it to turn. It wouldn't have
[5:12] a motor or maybe some mechanism. There's
[5:14] some uh physics that would go into it,
[5:17] but they would actually turn this wheel
[5:20] and that's what they come and they see.
[5:22] And we've used modern pottery wheels.
[5:23] Some of you, we have a a teacher, a
[5:26] doctor and a professor of clay amongst
[5:28] us. Brother Victor teaches uh um pottery
[5:31] at the Phoenix Art Institute. Did I get
[5:33] that right? Art Center. Phoenix Art
[5:34] Center. The University of Arts in
[5:38] Phoenix. And uh so and a lot of us have
[5:41] taken pottery classes with him and we've
[5:43] worked with clay and we've learned these
[5:44] different things and I things started
[5:46] clicking for me just as I've been
[5:47] studying this over the last few weeks a
[5:49] couple months. And so there's a in
[5:52] ancient times it would have been much
[5:53] like what we know now to be a pottery
[5:55] wheel is there would be a spinning
[5:57] wheel.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; And this type of pottery that God tells
[6:00] Jeremiah to go and witness is called
[6:02] throwing.
[6:04] And it's a process of shaping clay
[6:06] that's rotating on a pottery wheel. It's
[6:08] one of these ancient fundamental
[6:10] techniques of making pottery and it's
[6:13] physical something that requires you
[6:15] know touching and it's something that
[6:17] requires effort and it requires control
[6:19] and balance and you have to place the
[6:21] clay and then you have to pull on that
[6:23] clay to create a cylinder and the use of
[6:26] the will the reason why he's not just
[6:28] showing up and this guy has a lump of
[6:30] clay on a table. The use of the will is
[6:32] necessary uh to create symmetrical
[6:35] forms, uniform shapes.
[6:38] And we were looking at sacred symmetry
[6:40] earlier this year when God led us to
[6:42] deal with holiness and God's requirement
[6:44] in the scripture of how one ought to
[6:45] dress. And we saw very plainly what the
[6:48] Bible has to say about how a woman
[6:50] dresses and how a man dresses and how
[6:52] there's this sacred symmetry. There's
[6:54] something that God wants sees a beauty
[6:56] in the woman, sees a beauty in the man,
[6:57] and it needs to be expressed in that
[6:59] way. and any kind of human glaze or
[7:01] cover up to that changes God's image. We
[7:04] looked at how symmetry speaks of that uh
[7:07] that harmonious arrangement where
[7:08] there's this balanced proportion, this
[7:10] beautiful form, the golden ratio or the
[7:13] the the divine proportion. Those things
[7:15] are things that are in the scripture.
[7:18] And so for the symmetry of the vessel
[7:20] that's being created, it depends on that
[7:22] clay being uniformly shaped,
[7:25] &gt;&gt; proportionally influenced. It's like if
[7:27] there's kind of one of those things if
[7:29] you even apply it to cooking and say,
[7:32] "Well, I just want to cook this over
[7:33] high heat and and how long does it take
[7:35] to cook?" Well, if you only cook on one
[7:37] side, then you may not get that unless
[7:40] you really want to ruin your steak. I
[7:41] guess you could just cook it for an hour
[7:43] on one side and it's going to be uh it's
[7:46] not really well done. It's kind of the
[7:48] wrong phrase to use for a steak that's
[7:50] cooked to 180 degrees internal temp.
[7:52] That's done bad. How would you like your
[7:54] steak? I want it badly done. Okay, sure
[7:57] enough, no red there. But there's a
[7:59] wait, if you don't flip it, then you're
[8:01] not it's not going to be cooked evenly.
[8:03] There's something about that uh uniform
[8:06] influence, proportional influence where
[8:08] it's being shaped uh the same pressure
[8:10] from every side, not just from one side.
[8:13] So, this is what God is wanting him to
[8:15] see. Is he wanting him to see a potter
[8:17] that's working on a wheel? And in verse
[8:20] 14, and the vessel that he made of clay
[8:22] was marred in the hand of the potter. So
[8:25] I love how it's just still he witnesses
[8:28] that in the hand of the potter the clay
[8:30] is marred. So he made it again another
[8:33] vessel seemed good to the potter to make
[8:35] it. Looking at this word marred and even
[8:39] what some of the uh and the septuagent
[8:41] says and some of the traditional uh
[8:43] interpretations of this even to the Jews
[8:46] and but they they a lot of them say it
[8:48] fell. It may have fallen on the wheel or
[8:50] fallen onto a beam or something where it
[8:52] fell off this this uh the wheels and we
[8:55] could say that it fell or in otherwise
[8:57] in some way got out of the shape that
[8:59] the potter was intending
[9:02] and I want to I want to suggest this
[9:05] because to me this is how it really
[9:06] struck me. I felt the Lord had led me to
[9:08] this. It had possibly become unentered
[9:13] &gt;&gt; as a potter is working with this clay
[9:15] and it falls and something happens to
[9:17] it. He he it says that he had to make it
[9:19] again another vessel as it seemed good
[9:21] in the potter's sight. I said this
[9:23] vessel of clay that was being made on
[9:25] the wheels was marred. It's for somehow
[9:28] it was got out of shape.
[9:31] And if when I say it was unentered
[9:34] let me just give some uh there's a lot
[9:36] of background we could give to this. A
[9:38] lot of maybe just the academic uh aspect
[9:41] of this but centering is probably the
[9:44] most fundamental pottery skill. When I
[9:47] was taking classes, uh, pottery classes,
[9:50] that was the thing you did is you
[9:52] centered,
[9:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[9:54] &gt;&gt; That's all you did. That's what you did
[9:55] initially. You didn't have to go get
[9:56] clay, make clay. You didn't have to
[9:58] wedge clay. There wasn't a lot of work
[10:00] that I was doing uh when I was just
[10:02] doing it uh with my family. But we were
[10:05] there is that's the one thing you learn
[10:07] to do because you if you don't know how
[10:10] to center, if the clay's not centered,
[10:13] then you're not going to have success
[10:14] with what you're molding.
[10:16] Centering determines the success or the
[10:19] marring of that vessel. Determines
[10:21] whether or not there's disappointment or
[10:23] frustration
[10:25] or happiness because the centering of
[10:28] the clay on the wheel. As the potter
[10:30] came as the prophet came to the potter
[10:33] and saw the clay on the wheels and the
[10:35] potter working with the clay. Centering
[10:37] brings balance to the work, stability.
[10:41] And in order to work on that clay, it
[10:44] requires control in order to have
[10:46] symmetry.
[10:49] And so when centered, the potter's hands
[10:50] will evenly apply pressure.
[10:53] And and you're not having to push on
[10:55] this side and then go to this say,
[10:56] "Well, how much do I push here? And how
[10:58] how can I get this to work?" But it just
[11:00] by applying this pressure, it it allows
[11:02] it to be done smoothly and consistently.
[11:05] And when centered, it's easier for that
[11:07] for that potter to begin to pull that
[11:09] clay upwards a and to refine its shape
[11:13] and make it to what he wants it to be.
[11:16] So it's the centering that guarantees
[11:19] the symmetry.
[11:21] It's the centering that guarantees the
[11:23] balance that it'll be even and
[11:24] proportional. They call it rotational
[11:26] symmetry. But if the clay is uncentered,
[11:31] you're not going to be able to
[11:32] accomplish that. or if you tried to
[11:34] accomplish it. The phrase that I came
[11:36] across among ceramicists is that if it's
[11:39] not centered, it's called wrestling, not
[11:41] throwing
[11:43] &gt;&gt; because you're having to fight against
[11:44] the clay because it it's not even. It's
[11:47] it's moving this way. It's moving just a
[11:49] little bit out and just the slightest
[11:51] uncentering. YOU'RE REALLY HAVING TO
[11:53] FIGHT WITH IT YET. IT'S NOT THROWING AT
[11:55] THAT POINT. It's wrestling with it.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; And so when a clay is uncentered, it'll
[12:00] wobble. And as it shakes or wobbles, uh,
[12:03] then it and it spins, it's nearly
[12:05] impossible to form those straight lines
[12:07] and and the walls are even the
[12:09] appropriate shapes. Not only that, you
[12:11] get these un this uneven thickness where
[12:13] it's thicker on one side, thinner on the
[12:15] other. That's how cracks will form and
[12:17] and dry when it's drying and firing.
[12:22] When it's not centered, it's un it's
[12:25] more difficult to control. It's almost
[12:27] uncontrollable.
[12:29] Now, I know you're thinking, "Well, we
[12:31] showed up for church and we're getting
[12:32] clay classes." No, that's not it. We're
[12:34] not going to break out into the
[12:35] fellowship hall a and start working on
[12:38] clay. Think of how this spiritual
[12:41] principle of being centered.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; And when maybe if if it's our own
[12:46] children, they seem to be a little bit
[12:48] out of control and they're things are
[12:50] uneven and things are out of balance.
[12:52] It's because there's you haven't come
[12:53] back to center. There's got to be a
[12:55] baseline. There's got to be something
[12:56] that you say, "We're grounded and we're
[12:58] rooted in this." And that's what's going
[13:00] to bring the stability.
[13:02] When it's not centered, your hands are
[13:05] constantly fighting the clay's uneven
[13:07] motion. That's what increases
[13:08] frustration. That's what gives rise to
[13:10] mistakes. If it's not centered, there'll
[13:12] be structural weakness with the clay
[13:14] because it produces these unstable forms
[13:17] that warp and it'll collapse. It breaks
[13:19] more easily.
[13:21] It's how you get lopsided clay.
[13:25] where it's distorted, it's out of shape,
[13:28] which undermines the very reason why
[13:30] you're using the wheel to begin with. If
[13:34] you didn't mind if it was lopsided, if
[13:35] you didn't mind if it was even, if you
[13:37] didn't mind about the structural
[13:39] integrity, if it didn't need to be
[13:40] beautiful and proportional, then just do
[13:42] some hand building. Get it close enough.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; It'll hold water. But the point to using
[13:48] the will is so that things can be
[13:49] balanced.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; It can be the best that it can be.
[13:52] That's the that's the reason for using
[13:54] it. And so if it's not centered, the
[13:57] very process is undermined.
[14:02] So in the centering process,
[14:05] there's a there's a a wedging that takes
[14:07] place. We're in forming that clay.
[14:09] You're you're removing the air. You're
[14:11] aligning the particles. I didn't get
[14:13] into the science of that. I thought
[14:14] maybe that might have been a little
[14:15] hippie talk. I'm not sure. But um and
[14:18] then you put in a shape, a smooth ball,
[14:20] and then you're going to place it on the
[14:21] wheel.
[14:22] and you attach it to the wheel. You I
[14:24] think you you just kind of slam it down
[14:26] there. You plop it on there as the wheel
[14:29] spins and or you before the wheel spins
[14:32] and you press it down on that bat or the
[14:33] wheel head so it sticks and now you've
[14:35] got your clay in that beginning stages.
[14:40] And it wasn't until recently I almost
[14:41] feel like I need to apologize to my
[14:43] professor because it he's like we do
[14:45] this every time. And this is all we're
[14:46] doing is we're just putting it on the
[14:48] wheel and we're spinning it and we're
[14:51] bracing ourselves. We want to get firm
[14:53] control over the clay. We want to have
[14:54] the right kind of posture. And then what
[14:57] you would do and how many don't cringe
[14:59] husbands if you were dragged to a
[15:01] pottery class. Uh uh it it but you
[15:04] coned, right? There's certain kind of
[15:06] cones we like. You might find them at a
[15:08] salt and straw or something. But this
[15:10] kind of coning, that's all you were
[15:12] doing is coning. And I remember to me I
[15:14] was thinking what? Why? Why are we just
[15:16] going up and down and up and down and up
[15:18] and down? The coning was part of
[15:20] centering.
[15:22] There's no there's no point to trying to
[15:24] make a mug or a cup or a bass boat on
[15:27] the wheel. Uh you can't do that. Uh but
[15:30] I imagined it. But there's no way to
[15:32] make those things unless it's centered.
[15:35] Right.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; And so that final centering ONCE YOU'VE
[15:38] GOTTEN ON THERE AND this coning of
[15:40] pulling up and down, you apply this
[15:42] downward pressure with the top hand,
[15:44] this inward pressure with the side, and
[15:45] you're making sure your lump that's
[15:47] going to make this vessel is finally
[15:50] centered.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; You're not going to do anything else.
[15:54] You don't JUST GET ON IT IN FIVE
[15:55] MINUTES, YOU'VE got a coffee mug.
[15:56] There's this process of making sure this
[15:58] clay is perfectly centered, right?
[16:02] And once properly centered,
[16:05] if clay is properly centered, this is
[16:07] the part where I want to quickly
[16:08] transition into the spiritual
[16:10] application. If the clay is perfectly
[16:12] improperly centered, the wheel could be
[16:16] spinning as fast as it can possibly spin
[16:19] and the clay will look as if it's
[16:20] standing still.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; I want you to think of that. That no
[16:24] matter how much everything is spinning
[16:26] around, if centered, the clay appears as
[16:29] if it's standing still. That's right.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; In 2 Corinthians 4 7 to10, we looked
[16:34] through these first seven verses already
[16:36] recently, but we have this treasure in
[16:39] earth and vessels. Go back to chapter 3.
[16:41] He's talking about us being vessels of
[16:44] clay. We have this treasure in earth and
[16:47] vessels that the excellency of the power
[16:49] may be of God and not of us. So, we have
[16:52] God's power inside of us. We are vessels
[16:54] of clay. We are made to honor. And then
[16:58] once he has established in chapter 3 and
[17:00] and us being these vessels of light and
[17:03] there's a lot that he's amplifying
[17:05] through this once he's established this
[17:07] and we see ourselves as this clay that
[17:09] has this great treasure on the inside of
[17:11] us. He says we're troubled on every side
[17:13] yet not distressed. We are perplexed but
[17:16] not in despair. We are persecuted but
[17:19] not forsaken, cast down but not
[17:21] destroyed.
[17:22] Think of this lump of clay on the wheel
[17:25] and maybe it's pressed and it's pulled
[17:27] and it's misshapen AND IT'S GOING
[17:29] THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WE COULD SAY WE'RE
[17:30] TROUBLED ON EVERY SIDE yet not
[17:32] distressed. We are perplexed. We are
[17:34] persecuted. We're cast down but not
[17:35] distressed. Despared. WE'RE NOT
[17:37] DESTROYED OR FORSAKEN. EVERYTHING AROUND
[17:40] US IS SPINNING, BUT WE'RE JUST STAYING
[17:43] SILENTLY CENTERED, seemingly unmovable,
[17:46] &gt;&gt; cuz we're always bearing about in the
[17:47] body, the dying of the Lord Jesus, that
[17:49] the life also of Jesus might be made
[17:51] manifest in our body.
[17:54] If I could say it this way, when we're
[17:55] unentered or when we feel as if we're
[17:57] unentered, if we're unsure and we have
[17:59] this uh the the clay literally does not
[18:02] have its own mind, even though it may
[18:04] feel like it sometimes, and what you're
[18:07] wanting is just cooperate, please.
[18:11] We We have this human element to where
[18:13] if we're not properly centered or IF WE
[18:15] JUST FEEL UNCENTERED,
[18:18] &gt;&gt; this is why we This is when we
[18:19] experience despair.
[18:21] We could say for a fact that we're
[18:23] troubled. We're perplexed. We're we're
[18:26] uh we're persecuted.
[18:28] But we should not be distressed.
[18:31] We should not be in despair. We should
[18:33] not feel forsaken or destroyed.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; When we experience those things, it's
[18:39] because we're not centered.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm experiencing I'M
[18:44] EXPERIENCING TROUBLE." OKAY, that's
[18:47] that'll happen when you're centered. I
[18:49] I'M EXPERIENCING PERPLEXION. YEAH, IT'S
[18:51] YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPINNING AROUND. I'm
[18:54] persecuted. But it's when you're not
[18:56] centered that you begin to experience
[18:58] these other disappointments.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; In the sermon, Victory Day, Brother
[19:02] Brandham said, "It seems like the
[19:03] Christian life, if the fellow's not
[19:06] absolutely centered on Christ, the
[19:09] Christian life seems like it holds so
[19:11] many disappointments." Yeah,
[19:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to use a number of statements
[19:14] of brother Brandham because I want you
[19:16] to recognize that in the message what
[19:18] his themes were, what his emphasis was.
[19:20] Now, he's constantly bringing us back to
[19:22] Christ. IF YOU'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY
[19:24] CENTERED ON CHRIST, A Christian life
[19:26] seems to hold so many disappointments.
[19:28] And we said, yes, that's true that my I
[19:31] I experience A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS,
[19:32] BUT EVEN THOSE disappointments
[19:36] are we have to put them and view them in
[19:38] the proper light. HE SAYS, "BUT THESE
[19:39] DISAPPOINTMENTS ARE GOD'S DIVINE will
[19:41] happening for us."
[19:43] &gt;&gt; It don't seem like it would be that, BUT
[19:45] IT'S GOD'S WAY OF DOING THINGS. He lets
[19:47] us hit the river to see what we'll do.
[19:49] God will let you come to a place where
[19:51] it looks like you HAVE NO WAY ACROSS
[19:53] JUST SO THAT HE CAN SEE WHAT YOUR
[19:54] RESPONSE will be.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And so even in those
[19:59] disappointments, even with those times
[20:01] of distress and despair, God will use it
[20:03] because he uses all things to work
[20:05] together for your good,
[20:07] &gt;&gt; for your shaping, for your benefit, for
[20:09] your perfection. But if we're not
[20:11] absolutely centered on Christ, life
[20:13] holds so many disappointments.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; I would go on to say this that those
[20:17] things that what the event that would
[20:20] cause a disappointment. So let's just
[20:21] say circumstance and then our response
[20:24] to the circumstance is disappointment.
[20:27] And so the the circumstance may be unavo
[20:29] unavoidable. And so if you're not ab
[20:32] when you're absolutely centered on
[20:33] Christ, you may still go through the
[20:35] circumstance. But when you're not
[20:38] centered, that that circumstance causes
[20:41] the disappointment.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; So just because you're centered doesn't
[20:45] mean you're not going to feel pressure.
[20:47] Doesn't mean you're not going to feel a
[20:48] shaping, a pulling up and down, a
[20:50] mashing, and all those things that takes
[20:52] place when God is allowing a vessel to
[20:54] be formed. But it's being unentered that
[20:58] brings the disappointments,
[21:00] the wrong kind of internal response.
[21:03] In Matthew chap 22 34 to 40,
[21:08] want to focus now on this idea of being
[21:10] absolutely centered. But when the
[21:11] Pharisees had heard that he had put the
[21:13] Sadducees to silence, they were gathered
[21:16] together. And you now you'd think that
[21:18] if your rival got shut out that you'd be
[21:21] like, [laughter]
[21:22] "You're the the enemy of your enemy,
[21:24] your friend." But they hated Christ so
[21:26] much that they were disappointed to see
[21:29] the Sadducees sad, you see. And so he
[21:32] says, "Then one of them which was a
[21:33] lawyer, oh my, asked him a question,
[21:36] tempting him and saying, Master, which
[21:38] is the great commandment in the law?"
[21:42] Jesus said unto him, my friend and
[21:45] brother-in-law, Brother Jonathan, said,
[21:46] "It took him two decades to figure this
[21:48] out, but not only am I his
[21:49] brother-in-law, but I'm his
[21:50] brother-in-law." I thought, well, that's
[21:52] true for for you, too. Your
[21:56] friend-in-law, too. But he says, 'What's
[21:58] the great commandment in the law? Jesus
[22:01] said unto him, "Thou shalt love the Lord
[22:03] thy God with all thy heart, with all thy
[22:05] soul, and with all thy mind."
[22:07] This is the first and great commandment.
[22:10] The first and great commandment is about
[22:12] centering on God.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[22:16] all heart, soul, and mind.
[22:20] This is if you want to look at in the
[22:22] sense of h the different meanings that
[22:24] could be implied by the use of heart,
[22:26] soul, and mind. You're saying that the
[22:27] entire person is now centered on God on
[22:30] his will.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; The first and great commandment is to
[22:34] love the Lord thy God with all thy
[22:35] heart. This is a centering soul and
[22:38] mind.
[22:40] This is the first and great commandment.
[22:43] The first and greatest commandment is a
[22:44] measurement
[22:46] of whatever what our lives are centered
[22:48] on.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; What what what must I come back to?
[22:52] What's the center? Loving the Lord thy
[22:55] God with all thy heart, soul, and mind.
[22:57] And the second is like unto it thou
[22:59] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On
[23:01] these two commandments hang all the law
[23:03] and the prophets.
[23:05] That this is the center.
[23:08] This is what everything hangs on. This
[23:10] is the stabilizer. This is the balancing
[23:11] force. These two commandments are on all
[23:15] hang on all the law and the prophets.
[23:17] WHAT DO ALL THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS
[23:18] point to? Jesus Christ. What is it
[23:22] revealing? The nature of God.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; So this this two commandments are so
[23:28] outstanding.
[23:29] Love the Lord thy God with all thy
[23:31] heart, soul, and mind and thy neighbor
[23:33] as thyself. This is centering the
[23:35] believer. This is what matters.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. In John 14 19 to 21, yet a little
[23:41] while and the world seeth me no more,
[23:43] but ye see me. Because I live, ye shall
[23:45] live also. At that day ye shall know
[23:48] that I am in the father and ye in me and
[23:51] I in you.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; If we were to try to draw a vin diagram
[23:55] of that, I think it would be nearly
[23:56] impossible.
[23:58] This is, you know, I can't remember what
[24:00] they're called, but those Russian dolls
[24:01] where you open one up and the side is
[24:03] another one. You open another one,
[24:04] inside is another one, and open. and and
[24:06] we know which was inside which this is
[24:08] saying at that day you shall know that I
[24:10] am in the father
[24:12] and you are in me and and you're
[24:15] thinking oh let's unpack these Russian
[24:17] dolls and then he says and I in you and
[24:19] at that point you're like wait a minute
[24:21] the big guy can't fit in the little guy
[24:24] but this is what he's expressing at that
[24:26] day you will know that I am in you and
[24:28] you are in me he that hath my
[24:30] commandments and keepeth him he is that
[24:32] loveth me and he that loveth me shall be
[24:35] loved of my father and I will love him
[24:37] and will manifest myself to him. What
[24:40] beautiful promises
[24:43] &gt;&gt; when he says at that day you'll know
[24:45] that you are in me. The believer is uh
[24:49] you are in me. The believer is centered
[24:51] in Christ.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; You are in me. We're centered on Christ.
[24:55] This is the centering of the believer.
[24:57] But then he says and I in you. This is
[24:59] Christ being centered in the believer.
[25:02] Amen.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; Just recognize kind of that that that
[25:05] symmetry to it that our faith and we
[25:07] must be centered in Christ. So we have
[25:11] this PERSPECTIVE THAT I AM CENTERED IN
[25:13] CHRIST BY ONE SPIRIT. I'VE BEEN BAPTIZED
[25:15] INTO THE BODY of Christ. I'M IN THE
[25:16] heart of God. I'm I was I'm in the mind
[25:18] OF CHRIST. BUT THEN NOT JUST THIS VIEW
[25:21] to me being in him, but now he must be
[25:24] centered in me.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; That I must have the mind of Christ.
[25:27] THAT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WHERE IN
[25:29] CHRIST IS HAVING COMPLETE control and
[25:31] preeminence in me.
[25:34] Brother Bradom said Christ is the center
[25:36] of our worship, the center of our
[25:37] attraction, the center of our life and
[25:40] all that we have, want and are and will
[25:42] be is based upon him.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Now that's centering. That's loving the
[25:46] Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul,
[25:48] and mind. When he is the center of our
[25:49] worship, the center of our attraction,
[25:50] the center of our life, and then all we
[25:52] have, want, are, and will be is based on
[25:55] him.
[25:56] THIS IS THE RIGHT KIND OF CENTERING. In
[25:59] the day and age that we live in now
[26:01] where lives are so fragmented and we
[26:03] have so many different pursuits and
[26:04] ambitions and hobbies and so many
[26:06] different ways that our attentions can
[26:07] be fragmented, WE MUST BE COMING BACK to
[26:10] this solid foundation where I know I'm
[26:12] on the wheel. I'm on his back. I'm
[26:14] placed positionally in this in his word
[26:17] to know that this is what matters the
[26:20] most.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; This is what I'm centered on. Amen.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; We all we we all have different callings
[26:26] in our lives. We have different
[26:27] experiences. We have different past. We
[26:29] have uh places that God will call us to
[26:32] live, jobs he'll call us to do. Uh there
[26:35] may be something God will ask you to do
[26:37] and in obeying it and you do it. A lot
[26:39] of people may not understand why you're
[26:40] doing it. might why you're doing it.
[26:42] There might be a lot of things that we
[26:44] have these uh strict constructs of how
[26:46] things need to be and this is what it
[26:48] should how it should feel and this is
[26:50] how it should look and when it doesn't
[26:52] happen that way we're real quick to
[26:53] judge. But the most important thing is
[26:55] for the clay itself to know I'm centered
[26:58] in God's will
[27:00] &gt;&gt; with the confidence of knowing that if I
[27:02] if I have gotten a little bit off center
[27:04] and I begin to wobble and things get a
[27:06] little bit misshapen and I pursued
[27:08] something I shouldn't that God has a way
[27:09] of getting us back into the center of
[27:11] his will.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; That life down there is just driving me
[27:18] crazy. You spend a whole afternoon
[27:20] making sure everything's just perfectly
[27:22] centered and then you get life.
[27:25] You start thinking about cereal and you
[27:27] get hungry.
[27:31] Notice he said that thou shalt love the
[27:33] Lord thy God with all thy heart, with
[27:34] all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
[27:35] That is the first and greatest
[27:37] commandment.
[27:40] And he says, "Thou shalt love thy
[27:41] neighbor as thyself."
[27:44] It's uh maybe I should have asked you
[27:46] this, Brother Victor. He was my
[27:48] consultant.
[27:49] But I looked at this as a like a chuck
[27:54] to keep the clay centered. Some call it
[27:57] a lug.
[27:59] I might argue as a amateur ceramicist
[28:02] myself that maybe the proper term is a
[28:05] chuck. But you're going to use a piece
[28:06] of clay to keep it centered when you're
[28:08] maybe in the trimming process. You
[28:10] you're going to kind of harness it a
[28:12] little bit. You're going to keep it uh
[28:13] stable.
[28:15] When he says, "Thou shalt love thy
[28:17] neighbor as thyself."
[28:19] This is we have we're centered. I love
[28:21] the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
[28:23] soul, and all thy mind. But now, there's
[28:24] something that keeps us that's going to
[28:26] make sure you're centered.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Love your neighbor as yourself.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Because if your heart's not completely
[28:33] centered on Christ,
[28:35] you're not going to love your neighbor
[28:36] as yourself.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; And this is the good part. If your heart
[28:42] is not absolutely centered on Christ,
[28:45] you ain't going to be loving yourself
[28:46] correctly.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; And therefore, you can't love your
[28:50] neighbor correctly.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; If I could put it this way, being
[28:53] self-centered keeps us uncentered to
[28:55] Christ.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Being self-centered is is a red flag
[28:58] that I'm not centered. If I could put it
[29:01] this way, in the concept of the wheel,
[29:02] the world does not revolve around you.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; May feel like it, but it doesn't.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 3:7, we used this recently.
[29:10] We use Genesis quite a bit here. And the
[29:13] eyes of them both were opened. The man
[29:16] and the woman at the time of the fall
[29:17] after Satan had convinced them. He used
[29:19] glazed over death. Says, "And they knew
[29:22] that they were naked and they sewed fig
[29:24] leaves together and made themselves
[29:26] aprons. Everything is centered around
[29:28] them. Their eyes were open. They knew.
[29:31] They sewed. They made themselves
[29:34] aprons."
[29:36] The shame that came with the sense of
[29:38] self-awareness provoked this self-p
[29:40] protection.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; I want to protect myself.
[29:44] I think the way we described it earlier
[29:46] this year is Eden shifted from being
[29:48] God- centered. It was centered around
[29:50] his word. These were his commandments.
[29:52] Be fruitful, multiply, replenish the
[29:54] earth, uh subdue it, have dominion over
[29:57] it. This was a god centered
[30:00] a a a word centered Eden. And but now it
[30:02] become self-centered,
[30:04] &gt;&gt; right? And once it becomes
[30:05] self-centered, his his eyes are open. He
[30:08] knows he's naked. HE MAKES APRONS FOR
[30:11] HIMSELF. AND WHAT DOES ADAM DO?
[30:12] SELFISHLY RUNS AWAY FROM GOD.
[30:16] And this is what happens when we don't
[30:18] love the Lord thy God with all your
[30:20] heart, soul, and mind. Things shift to
[30:22] becoming more self-centered.
[30:24] What does this mean for me? How does
[30:26] this impact me? And you're not loving
[30:29] your neighbor as yourself. You don't
[30:31] have the heart of God that looks looks
[30:33] outward.
[30:35] The phrase that we would use maybe today
[30:37] is a narcissist
[30:39] which is it's it's a modern phrase but
[30:42] it comes from Greek mythology but it's a
[30:44] psych psychological a term in psychology
[30:45] to describe this preoccupation with self
[30:50] &gt;&gt; and I know there's a lot that we're
[30:51] looking at in the word of God and we say
[30:53] well in the word of God what we're
[30:54] trying to do is we want God to work on
[30:56] us and I want to see I want to center
[30:58] myself on Christ I want Christ to be
[31:00] centered in me and there may seem to be
[31:02] a lot of eye that goes into this
[31:05] and there's a lot of uh you a lot of
[31:08] maybe selfexamination
[31:10] and thoughts about ourselves and I I I
[31:12] want to work out my own salvation. I
[31:14] want God to perfect me.
[31:17] But it does it's not to cause us to
[31:18] become very insular and selfish and
[31:22] self-centered.
[31:24] in Greek mythology, uh, narcissist,
[31:28] he was
[31:32] he constantly, if I I'm just trying to
[31:34] remember that he so preoccupied with his
[31:37] own image, looking at himself in a
[31:39] mirror
[31:41] and so preoccupied with seeing his what
[31:44] he thought to be his beauty that it
[31:46] ended up being his ruin because he
[31:48] couldn't get him he couldn't stop from
[31:49] looking.
[31:51] And so it SAYS WE ALL WITH OPEN FACE
[31:53] BEHOLDING as a the Lord the glory of the
[31:55] Lord as in a glass or changing the same
[31:57] image. If you're looking into the carnal
[32:00] mirror
[32:02] &gt;&gt; and you're seeing your worldly
[32:04] reflection and you're like mirror mirror
[32:06] on the wall
[32:08] &gt;&gt; who is the freshest of them all. Right?
[32:11] You're like that then you're a man who
[32:13] is beholding himself in the glass and
[32:16] forgets what kind of sinner he was.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; So there's the wrong kind of mirror.
[32:20] There's the mirror of narcissists where
[32:22] you're seeing yourself. Oh, I'm such a
[32:23] good person. You're good. You're going
[32:24] to make it. I think that's the
[32:26] incredible part about, you know,
[32:27] front-facing cameras and this selfie
[32:29] generation is you're beholding yourself.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; And and and what's THE WORLD'S RESPONSE
[32:36] TO A SELFIE? WE NEED FILTERS,
[32:40] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[32:41] &gt;&gt; WE NEED A WAY TO CHANGE THIS.
[32:46] AND SO THERE'S A PREOCCUPATION WITH self
[32:50] which that's your only perspective is
[32:52] self-centered.
[32:54] How does this affect me? What does that
[32:56] call? Selfishness, vanity, pride.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; It says you should love the Lord thy God
[33:01] with all your heart, soul, and mind. But
[33:03] now this chuck, this this lug, this
[33:06] thing that's now making sure you're
[33:08] staying center on the wheel is love thy
[33:10] neighbor as thyself.
[33:16] In the sermon, does God ever change his
[33:17] mind about his word? Brother says,
[33:18] "God's little group is his bride
[33:20] centered on that word."
[33:24] May the dear heavenly father ever keep
[33:26] you stabilized right there. Don't you
[33:28] ever move from that word.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; It's a stabilizing force.
[33:32] Ezekiel 1:16 as this prophet sees this
[33:35] appearance of the wheels and their work
[33:37] was like under the color of a burl and
[33:39] they had four and they for had one
[33:41] likeness and their appearance and their
[33:43] work was as it were a will in the middle
[33:45] of a will.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; It's an image of Christ.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Christ is the will in the middle of the
[33:52] will. Christ stabilizes every move.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; But you've got to let him.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; You've got to be CENTERED ON CHRIST. HE
[33:59] MUST BE CENTERED in you. AND IT'LL
[34:01] STABILIZE EVERY MOTION you make. If you
[34:03] get a LITTLE BIT OFF CENTER, you're
[34:04] going to wobble. You're going to get
[34:05] uneven. You're going to get
[34:06] disproportionate.
[34:08] Gonna get out of balance. When an
[34:11] individual's not completely and totally
[34:13] centered ON CHRIST, LIFE HOLDS SO MANY
[34:15] DISAPPOINTMENTS. WHAT DO DISAPPOINTMENTS
[34:17] CAUSE? DOUBT, CONFUSION, WORRY, CHAOS.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; You've got to be centered.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. 2 Timothy chapter 1:7, "For
[34:25] God hath not given us the spirit of
[34:26] fear, but of power and of love, and of a
[34:30] sound mind."
[34:31] &gt;&gt; A sound mind is that moderation or
[34:33] self-control.
[34:35] It speaks of a soberness to restore one
[34:37] to his senses.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Things are clear.
[34:41] And fear
[34:43] puts you in a disjointed state of mind.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Fear, you're you're off center.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; May even call it unhinged.
[34:52] it. Fear intoxicates us. It puts us
[34:54] under the wrong kind of influence. It
[34:55] impairs our our thinking
[34:58] because we're now if you're perfectly
[35:00] centered on God's word, then that
[35:02] produces faith.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; When you get a little bit off-centered,
[35:06] it produces doubt, which gives rise to
[35:07] fear.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; What was it that man did in Genesis
[35:10] 3:10? Whenever he sinned, I heard the
[35:13] voice, thy voice in the garden, and I
[35:14] was afraid because I was naked and I hid
[35:16] myself.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Fear is born from being unentered. Yeah.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; When we find ourselves anxious, when we
[35:23] find ourselves fearful, then then what
[35:25] we can do is we can begin to think,
[35:26] "Wow, uh why why am I fearful?" Well, I
[35:30] I know that can be very difficult to
[35:32] diagnose sometimes. I I I know what it's
[35:34] like to experience fear and anxiety and
[35:36] melancholy and depression, and you're
[35:38] still you're trying TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
[35:39] IN THE WORLD IS MAKING ME FEEL SO
[35:40] ANXIOUS. And and you want to find some
[35:43] identifiable, YOU KNOW, OH, IT'S BECAUSE
[35:46] SOMEBODY FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST ME FOR
[35:48] $1 BILLION. THAT'S WHY I'M ANXIOUS. NO,
[35:49] NO SUCH LAWSUIT EXISTS. OH, IT'S BECAUSE
[35:52] THAT YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING. AND WHAT
[35:53] YOU REALIZE IS YOU'VE ALLOWED YOURSELF
[35:56] TO GET A LITTLE BIT LEFT OF CENTER, JUST
[35:59] YOUR EMOTIONS.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD MAY CALL IT A HORMONAL
[36:02] IMBALANCE. It's you just need to take
[36:04] some medicine to GET EVERYTHING LINED
[36:05] BACK UP CHEMICALLY. AND THAT'S EXACTLY
[36:07] YOU GOT TO GET THINGS CENTERED BACK
[36:09] AGAIN. AMEN.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; I know with all this talk of centering,
[36:13] you're going to expect me to pass out,
[36:15] you know, copper line shoe inserts and
[36:17] we're going to do yoga later. But this
[36:19] is a different kind of centering that
[36:20] I'm talking about.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Fear comes from a heart that's not
[36:27] perfectly centered
[36:29] &gt;&gt; or a mind that doesn't think it is.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Because born again believers, your soul
[36:35] is sealed and centered. It's been
[36:36] glazed. It's impervious to to sin and
[36:39] doubt and unbelief. But it's when our
[36:41] minds and our spirits get agitated a and
[36:43] we begin to think, "Oh no, I'm not
[36:45] centered." What do we have to come back
[36:46] to? That which is certain.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; In the sermon, the voice of God in the
[36:50] last days, Brother says, "One reason the
[36:52] church is in condition that it's in is
[36:54] because there's so many voices."
[36:58] &gt;&gt; In 1963, Tucson Tabernacle this weekend
[37:00] is celebrating their 60th anniversary
[37:03] and they did a remodel. They're doing a
[37:05] church dedication. And so our our
[37:07] prayers are with them to this weekend.
[37:10] Think of how long it's been.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; The condition of the world in the 60s,
[37:15] the condition of the church in the 60s.
[37:16] And the condition is because the voices
[37:19] and now all those voices are amplified
[37:22] by everybody who has a Twitter account.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, X account. I read here
[37:28] recently that Malcolm X changed his name
[37:30] to Malcolm Twitter just to keep
[37:32] everything balanced out.
[37:36] But there's so MANY VOICES AND NOW THOSE
[37:38] VOICES, we have voices about the voices,
[37:42] &gt;&gt; right? Somebody, some news event is
[37:44] happening and Nancy in Tennessee wants
[37:46] to tweet. Well, this is what I think
[37:48] about Sleepy Joe, right? We got all
[37:49] THESE COMMENTARY ON COMMENTARY. HOW MANY
[37:52] OF YOU don't read the article, you read
[37:53] the comments?
[37:56] [laughter]
[37:59] I think America's greatness is the
[38:00] comment section.
[38:04] THERE'S SO MANY VOICES, SO MANY OTHER
[38:06] VOICES TO ATTRACT THE CHURCH FROM THE
[38:07] VOICE OF GOD TILL IT'S VERY DOUBTFUL
[38:10] THAT MANY WOULD HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD,
[38:12] THOUGH IT SPOKE RIGHT IN THEIR MIDST. IF
[38:14] THERE'S EVER BEEN A time that this IS
[38:16] MORE IMPERFECT BUT PERFECTLY TRUE IS
[38:20] RIGHT NOW THERE'S SO many voices. The
[38:23] voice of God is just another opinion in
[38:27] the voice of so many voices
[38:29] &gt;&gt; because now you can raise up a voice in
[38:31] opposition against the voice. Now you
[38:33] can have a platform that its sole
[38:35] purpose is to exist to attack Christ.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; He says they perhaps wouldn't even
[38:44] understand it because it would be a
[38:45] foreign thing to them.
[38:48] They got themselves so much centered on
[38:51] the voices of the day. Yes,
[38:54] &gt;&gt; if you think about it, our lives revolve
[38:56] around certain habits.
[38:58] And our tendencies with our cell phones
[39:00] and our tablets and our smart devices
[39:03] are centered around voices
[39:06] of the world,
[39:08] &gt;&gt; their opinions, their input, their
[39:10] actions, their promotions, their
[39:11] influence. It's centered on those
[39:14] voices. And we've heard and seen and
[39:17] felt so much in our soul and our heart
[39:19] and our mind all these things bombarding
[39:21] it that we can't be centered because
[39:22] these voices just have a gravitational
[39:25] pull and influence. I've been studying
[39:28] on a uh for some I've been asked to
[39:30] speak at a youth camp next year and so
[39:34] I've been studying on one thing that I
[39:35] think is very critical to our young
[39:37] people is the algorithm,
[39:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:40] And in this one book that I came across,
[39:43] we it turns this turns it upside down
[39:46] because we think, "Oh, the algorithm
[39:48] knows us."
[39:50] Yes. But that's not the bad part.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; The algor algorithm got to know you so
[39:57] it could change you.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that amazing? It knows I'm
[40:02] looking for a Navajo print cardigan. It
[40:05] knows me. But what it wants TO DO IS
[40:08] START WITH THAT, RIGHT? CREATE some sort
[40:10] of trust.
[40:12] Brother Algo just knows me, right? Knows
[40:15] me so well. AND THEN WITH THAT TRUST, it
[40:19] can shape you, can form you, can lead
[40:20] you where it wants you to go.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; And we have so many voices that just
[40:25] ever so slightly cause us to lean a bit
[40:28] little bit. If I could say it this way,
[40:29] Satan's long-term battle plan is to
[40:32] cause us to leave God's word.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Cause us to remove Christ, the word,
[40:37] from being the center of OUR LIVES.
[40:39] WELL, HOW IS HE EVER GOING TO GET CHRIST
[40:40] A OUT? HOW IS HE EVER GOING TO KICK HIM
[40:42] OUT OF THE CHURCH? HE DOESN'T START BY
[40:44] SHOWING UP AND SAYING, "YOU SHOULD EVICT
[40:47] CHRIST." JUST LITTLE BY little moves
[40:49] them out of certain places.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Moves them out. Moves them out. Just
[40:53] leave. Just ever so slightly lean away
[40:55] from your first love. And before you
[40:57] know it, Christ is completely kicked out
[40:58] of the church in Revelations 3.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; He's on the outside and say, "Well, how
[41:02] did that ever happen?" Voices.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; We got centered on the wrong voices.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Too much time was given to these other
[41:10] voices. And Christ gets nudged out. And
[41:12] Christ gets nudged out. Christ gets
[41:13] nudged out. And then all of a sudden,
[41:15] trouble hits your home. Like, "What
[41:16] happened? What happened? What happened?
[41:18] &gt;&gt; You got unentered."
[41:21] &gt;&gt; But a sound mind is centered on Christ.
[41:24] A mind that is centered on Christ acts
[41:26] according to wisdom. It acts in
[41:28] moderation. The thought that brought me
[41:30] to these very scriptures was the balance
[41:33] &gt;&gt; that when when the clay is centered on
[41:36] the will, there's not these extreme
[41:38] motions
[41:40] that the the force
[41:44] of that spinning is balanced out
[41:47] proportionally. But if it gets
[41:49] uncentered, the force will cause it to
[41:51] to jerk to move.
[41:54] If you've ever seen something spinning
[41:55] and it gets just a little bit off, you
[41:57] you notice right away it creates that
[42:00] uneven motion.
[42:04] Sound mind
[42:07] is trusting. It has faith. But then it
[42:08] says a sound mind. Notice this balancing
[42:11] here. Giving us a spirit of power and of
[42:15] a sound mind. I want to take those two
[42:16] things. It's power and a sound mind.
[42:19] Power it chases away fear and the power.
[42:22] So, we have power and we might think
[42:25] that's really dynamic that that's the
[42:27] part that we see. But then you have a
[42:29] sound mind. Power and a sound mind. But
[42:31] then notice it's not just power and a
[42:33] sound mind. Love is right in the middle.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Love is that balancing factor between
[42:39] extremes.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT A SOUND MIND. OKAY. WELL, I'VE
[42:43] GOT POWER. I'D RATHER HAVE POWER THAN A
[42:46] SOUND MIND. SO, I'D RATHER have a sound
[42:47] mind than power. And he said, 'Well, now
[42:49] now we got powers fighting against a
[42:51] sound mind. Which side are you? Huh?
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Which team are you? I'm team power,
[42:56] right? I said, you know, I'm team sound
[42:59] mind, right? And we have all these teams
[43:02] that we're on. No, there's no team
[43:04] because when you have love, it's what
[43:07] it's what brings it together.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; It balances it together. If you don't
[43:11] have love, love the Lord thy God with
[43:13] all the heart, soul, and mind. There's a
[43:15] way to break that down. Even if though
[43:17] the the Greek words may not match up,
[43:19] but if you have the love of God in your
[43:20] soul,
[43:22] it's going to balance out the mind and
[43:24] the power. It's going to balance out the
[43:26] the the mind and the heart. It's going
[43:28] to take that and it's going to say, "Now
[43:29] with the word of God in my heart, I can
[43:31] stay balanced. I don't need to create
[43:33] sides
[43:35] because I'm centered. I'm centered on
[43:37] Christ."
[43:40] So the love keeps us balanced. When
[43:42] you're centered, you're balanced. In
[43:45] Hosea 7:es 8 and N we were preaching on
[43:48] mixed media said Ephraim he hath mixed
[43:50] himself among the people.
[43:53] You're going to great lengths are just
[43:55] showing the power of these things being
[43:56] mixed together and the damaging effect.
[43:58] Ephraim is a cake not turned. What did
[44:02] that mean? It's literally like a pancake
[44:06] on the griddle that's only being cooked
[44:08] on one side.
[44:10] It It's an egg that's only fried on one
[44:13] side. It's a steak that's only cooked on
[44:15] one side. He's saying it's not even.
[44:17] It's a cake not turned. Not only did it
[44:19] become burned and inedible, but it it's
[44:22] not balanced. IT'S ONLY IT'S PRONE TO
[44:24] EXTREMES. SO, it strength has been
[44:26] devoured. Strangers have devoured his
[44:27] strength and he knoweth it not.
[44:30] The mixing that is the imitation, the
[44:32] joining with other nations is how we
[44:34] used it. But there's this imbalance that
[44:37] comes. So if our hearts ARE NOT
[44:39] COMPLETELY CENTERED ON CHRIST, WE ARE
[44:41] SUSCEPTIBLE TO FORCES,
[44:44] RIGHT? Is that is EPHESIANS TALKING
[44:45] ABOUT TOSSED TO AND FRO?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; If you're IF YOU'RE CENTERED, LISTEN,
[44:50] GOD ALLOWS THINGS TO COME. GOD ALLOWS
[44:52] WAVES. GOD ALLOWS PRESSURES. If you're
[44:55] centered on Christ, then that pressure
[44:58] is going to cause you to become more
[45:00] even. Going to be stable. You're going
[45:02] to be able to weather it, right? Because
[45:03] you're going to you're GOING TO BE
[45:04] SPINNING AROUND BECAUSE THE PRESSURE.
[45:06] BUT WHAT HAPPENS? It's applied evenly
[45:08] and it looks as if you're not even
[45:10] moving because you stand therefore.
[45:13] [snorts]
[45:13] &gt;&gt; But if you get A LITTLE BIT UNCENTERED,
[45:14] WHAT HAPPENS? IT THAT spinning is going
[45:16] to cause you to move move and the the
[45:18] force in the weight of that
[45:21] &gt;&gt; cause you to shift and that's when the
[45:23] vessel is marred.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; So we got we have to stay balanced
[45:27] because then the pressures come. I've
[45:29] experienced this myself. This is just a
[45:31] little bit of uh uh pulling back the
[45:34] curtain on my for myself that
[45:38] there's a lot of things that happen in
[45:39] life for me personally that something
[45:41] happens and you feel it's some extreme
[45:44] or it's some air and it's some lie and
[45:46] if you are just responding to the
[45:49] extreme
[45:51] &gt;&gt; in order to balance the extreme out
[45:54] you've got to go to the other extreme
[45:57] &gt;&gt; and you you yourself you've tried to
[45:59] bring some sort of balance. So, you had
[46:01] to go you had to leave the middle and go
[46:04] into the other SIDE TO TRY TO GET them
[46:06] in the middle. Well, if you're
[46:07] successful, they're going to look at you
[46:08] like, "Well, why are you so extreme,
[46:09] brother Aaron?" LIKE, "WELL, I WAS ONLY
[46:11] extreme because you're extreme.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; I only got here because of where you
[46:16] were. CAN YOU HELP ME OUT OF THIS
[46:17] DITCH?"
[46:19] &gt;&gt; And so, then they go to help you out of
[46:20] the ditch and they just pull you out of
[46:21] that ditch right into another one.
[46:24] And so there's something about being
[46:25] centered that when things happen, if
[46:27] you're centered, you can say, "Well, I
[46:29] know that's not right." But this is this
[46:32] is the word of God.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to pull from the
[46:35] other side,
[46:36] &gt;&gt; the other extreme to mix and blend the
[46:40] extremes to come up with some sort of
[46:42] harmony. You say, "No, I see where
[46:44] Christ is in his word.
[46:47] I don't need to be extreme
[46:49] &gt;&gt; and I don't need to go to the other
[46:51] extreme
[46:52] &gt;&gt; to be balanced,
[46:55] &gt;&gt; which is I think what we're going to be
[46:56] doing over the next several months is
[46:58] we're going to have a fire in the
[46:59] fireplace and the doors open, right? All
[47:02] the doors and windows open so we can
[47:04] just create the perfect room
[47:05] temperature.
[47:09] And God hiding himself in simplicity
[47:11] then revealing himself in the same. He
[47:13] said, "There's one side that's highly
[47:14] intellectual, cold, and indifferent.
[47:16] They deny everything there, and the
[47:18] other's got the other side, and the
[47:19] other side's a radical bunch of emotion
[47:21] and deny the word." And in reality, you
[47:24] know what made them that way?
[47:27] Polarization.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; What made them that way is like, "Well,
[47:31] I believe this way. Well, I believe this
[47:33] way. Well, I think you're wrong."
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Right? And all it does is it creates
[47:39] these A POLARIZATION THAT THE RESPONSE
[47:42] and the AND THE SIDES GET FURTHER and
[47:44] further APART AS A RESPONSE TO the other
[47:46] extreme.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; But he says, "But the real true church
[47:50] stays right in the middle of the road."
[47:54] &gt;&gt; The true believer is centered on the
[47:55] word of God.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Therefore, it's the true believer that's
[47:58] taking shots from both sides.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; These people get in their trench on one
[48:03] side, the other people get in their
[48:04] trench on the other, and they're taking
[48:06] shots at each other. But who's taking
[48:07] all the bullets?
[48:08] &gt;&gt; The believer that stands right in the
[48:10] middle.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Because you're not an you're not
[48:13] extreme.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Those who are in the perfect liberty of
[48:16] Christ. Because where the spirit of the
[48:17] Lord, there's liberty to become like
[48:18] Christ. But if you don't buy into the
[48:20] fact that where there's liberty, there's
[48:22] emotionalism and there's fanaticism and
[48:24] there's a wildfire and that's the way
[48:25] you ought to be, right? Then and but
[48:28] you're right in the middle with the word
[48:29] of God, they're going to look at you as
[48:30] being cold, formal, and intellectual.
[48:32] Right?
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Because to those who are in the
[48:35] extremes, the person in the middle is
[48:37] extreme.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Daniel chapter 5 verse 27 it says, "Thou
[48:45] art weighed in the balances and found
[48:47] art found wanting." That would make a
[48:49] good art title. Art found wanting
[48:53] judged by the word and found to be
[48:55] deficient
[48:56] &gt;&gt; or lacking.
[48:59] weighed in the balance.
[49:03] So, how is it that you find how do you
[49:05] find balance? There's a
[49:09] one weight on one side, a weight on the
[49:11] other, and it becomes it's centered.
[49:13] It's balanced. It's stabilized.
[49:18] And the more the church has shifted from
[49:20] Christ being the center, the more it's
[49:24] I can't remember if it was this year. I
[49:26] think it was this year we talked about
[49:26] how the more that we shifted away from
[49:28] Christ being the center of the church,
[49:29] it's become more social centered
[49:32] &gt;&gt; where things were all revolve around
[49:33] relationships with each other
[49:36] and it re it got there because we
[49:37] centered more on the emotionalism or the
[49:39] intellectualism.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; You center on the mind, the person, it
[49:43] becomes more self-centered. It becomes
[49:45] the individual improvement.
[49:48] It becomes more how to win friends and
[49:50] influence people. And it becomes more
[49:51] psychology. And it becomes more
[49:53] emotionalism or Pentecostalism. And
[49:55] that's how Christ gets kicked out of the
[49:57] church. And when you shift away from a
[49:59] Christ centered church, it becomes and
[50:01] you shift you focus more on the mind.
[50:03] That's how you get social centered
[50:05] churches.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; But Christ, brother said, go Christ is
[50:08] God's center spot of worship.
[50:11] Christ is
[50:14] &gt;&gt; brother Bram said there's more to this
[50:15] ministry than divine healing AND SOME
[50:18] WOULD ARGUE THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S MORE TO
[50:19] THIS MINISTRY THAN DIVINE HEALING
[50:20] THERE'S TONGUES AND THERE'S SHOUTING
[50:21] THERE'S DANCING THERE'S EMOTION THERE'S
[50:22] POWER THERE'S TEACHING AND TRY TO TRY TO
[50:25] BRING THE BALANCE BY BRINGING EVERYTHING
[50:26] IN NO IT'S Christ
[50:29] &gt;&gt; listen WELL THERE'S EMOTION AND THERE'S
[50:31] NOT EMOTION NO THAT TO TO SOME POINT
[50:34] YOU'RE CREATING UNNECESSARY PARADOXES
[50:36] THERE'S CHRIST
[50:38] &gt;&gt; IN CHRIST ALONE
[50:40] &gt;&gt; LET him be in THE PERSON WHAT HE WANTS
[50:42] TO BE. LET HIM MOLD. IF THERE'S A PERSON
[50:45] WHO'S PRONE TO FANATICISM, A PERSON
[50:47] WHO'S REALLY EMOTIONAL AND A PERSON
[50:49] WHO'S REALLY REALLY EXPRESSIVE AND
[50:50] ALWAYS GIVES THEMSELVES OVER TO SOME
[50:52] SORT OF PHYSICAL WORKUP, IF CHRIST WANTS
[50:54] TO WORK IN THEM TO MAKE THEM MORE SOBER
[50:57] and clear-minded, let him do it. IF
[51:00] THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S STARCHY AND COLD
[51:02] AND FORMAL AND THEY'VE NEVER HAD A CRY
[51:04] IN THEIR LIFE AND NEVER HAD A SHOUT AND
[51:06] GOD WANTS THEM TO EXPERIENCE MORE
[51:07] EMOTION SO THEY CAN HAVE DEEPER EMPATHY,
[51:09] THEN LET GOD DO THAT IN THEM. LET CHRIST
[51:12] BEING THE PERSON WHAT THE POTTER WANTS
[51:15] THEM TO BE.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Because in the sermon absolute
[51:22] man, for those of you who are
[51:23] grammatically pettent, a absolute is a
[51:25] title that'll really get you.
[51:30] If in your life you have an absolute,
[51:33] you do things ordinarily you would not
[51:35] do,
[51:37] especially if you have a God centered
[51:41] life.
[51:44] The God- centered life makes a person do
[51:46] things that ordinarily they would not
[51:47] do. So he's repeating that very odd,
[51:50] peculiar. Why is a Christian life so odd
[51:52] and peculiar? It's because they're
[51:55] looking to God's word which is almost
[51:57] foreign to the world today.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; That's why you're odd. That's why you're
[52:01] peculiar. You're centered on something
[52:03] else.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; There's so much in this in terms of the
[52:07] pottery process,
[52:09] but then there's so many other
[52:10] experiences that you can have in terms
[52:12] of vantage point and the way things move
[52:16] and the and the physics and science and
[52:18] all and aliens. There's all these
[52:20] different things that you can look at
[52:21] and say, "Wow, there's so many different
[52:23] ways to see this principle that when
[52:26] somebody is centered on something, to
[52:29] those who don't have the same point of
[52:31] reference to those who AREN'T CENTERED,
[52:34] IT IT OPERATES COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; They're looking to God's word. You're
[52:42] looking to God's word." And be having a
[52:43] God- centered life makes you peculiar
[52:46] and odd. There's your excuse. There's
[52:48] your out
[52:52] spiritual diversity.
[52:55] It's a superpower.
[52:58] Ephesians chapter 3 14 to1 19.
[53:02] For this cause I bow my knees. We're
[53:04] coming to our closing thoughts here. Uh
[53:07] well, we're making good time so maybe I
[53:08] can venture into some other areas. But
[53:10] for this cause I bow my knees unto the
[53:12] Lord uh the father of our Lord Jesus
[53:14] Christ of whom the whole fam family in
[53:17] heaven and earth is named
[53:20] that he would grant you according to the
[53:22] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[53:25] with might by his spirit in the inner
[53:28] man.
[53:30] This is the prayer. This is what I want
[53:32] day by day that God would grant that I
[53:33] would be strengthened with might with
[53:35] power by his spirit in the inner man. So
[53:40] the inner man being Christ the word that
[53:45] that that's inner person of me this man
[53:47] within the man Christ in me the hope of
[53:49] glory his spirit being in me would
[53:53] strengthen me
[53:55] &gt;&gt; strengthen me
[53:57] &gt;&gt; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[53:59] faith I want to use that to say this is
[54:02] Christ being centered in our hearts that
[54:04] ye being rooted and grounded in love now
[54:07] we're centered in Christ
[54:10] charity Christ the capstone he's now
[54:12] centered himself
[54:15] Christ may dwell in our hearts our faith
[54:18] must be centered on the word and the
[54:21] word must be the center of our faith
[54:22] Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith
[54:24] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[54:26] love I think that's just come comes back
[54:28] to being grounded
[54:31] that there's there's something even you
[54:33] know there's a lot of of theory on a
[54:35] person's connection to the earth and
[54:37] being grounded grounded and walking in
[54:39] grass and I hope rocks work just as well
[54:41] for those of us Phoenicians that walking
[54:44] on gravel and quarter minus and dust is
[54:47] part of grounding but there's something
[54:49] about this centering this grounding
[54:53] we may dwell in your hearts by faith
[54:55] being rooted in ground love may be able
[54:56] to comprehend with all saints what is
[54:57] the breadth the length the depth and
[54:58] height and to know the love of Christ
[55:01] which passeth knowledge that you might
[55:02] be filled with all the fullness of God
[55:07] &gt;&gt; when you are centered centered on the
[55:08] word and the word is centered in you.
[55:09] It's access to fullness.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; If you get a little bit off-centered,
[55:14] there's going to be something in the
[55:15] way. Something misshapen, something uh
[55:19] uh not quite working right.
[55:23] And the sermon Jehovah Gyra part one,
[55:25] when the Holy Spirit came upon that
[55:27] vine, it produced from its vine to the
[55:29] first branch. They wrote a book of Acts
[55:31] behind it. This is the inauguration of
[55:32] the Christian church. The Holy Ghost
[55:33] poured out on the day of Pentecost. this
[55:36] true genuine Pentecostal experience.
[55:38] When the Holy Spirit was poured out on
[55:40] the day of Pentecost, it was according
[55:41] to a promise. When the day of Pentecost
[55:43] was fully come, then God inaugurated his
[55:45] church by sending the baptism of the
[55:47] Holy Ghost.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; And from that moment on, the Holy Ghost
[55:50] is available to the believer who
[55:51] repents.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; There's no tearing. There's no waiting.
[55:55] There's no calendar. There's no workup.
[55:59] And it wrote a book of Acts behind it.
[56:01] If that tree ever puts forth an original
[56:04] another original limb, she'll grow the
[56:05] same thing. What is she going to grow?
[56:07] What is she going to grow? What is she?
[56:09] Is she going to grow? Tongues. Yeah.
[56:11] Right. Tongues. Is that going to be it?
[56:14] Is it going to be Is it is going to grow
[56:16] hippie skirts? Right. All the way to
[56:18] What? What? What is she going to grow?
[56:20] It'll be Jesus Christ.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; It's not organization. It's not
[56:25] nominations. He says, "Now we've got
[56:27] Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist,
[56:29] Lutheran, everything else grafted into
[56:30] it, bearing denominational fruit."
[56:33] Because what do they get centered on?
[56:34] Their creed, the church name, their
[56:37] image, their work, their mission. He
[56:38] says, "But if it ever puts forth another
[56:40] branch, she will be a genuine
[56:43] Christfilled Christ centered word of
[56:46] God."
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Another book of Acts is Christc
[56:49] centered. Yeah,
[56:52] &gt;&gt; that's what another book of Acts is, is
[56:53] Christ having preeminence in his church.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; And Jeremiah chapter 18,
[57:03] we'll try to we'll read just a little
[57:05] bit more here.
[57:07] Let's read verses 4 to9
[57:11] because I want to I want to bring it to
[57:13] a close. But just see this beautiful
[57:15] picture here.
[57:17] and the vessel that he made of clay was
[57:19] marred in the hand of the potter.
[57:22] The prophet showed up that day at the
[57:24] potter's house. And when he walks in, he
[57:27] sees a potter at the will working on
[57:30] clay.
[57:32] And as that wheel was spinning around
[57:34] and as he began to work on that clay,
[57:36] all of a sudden the clay fell or it
[57:38] wobbled. It it it otherwise fell apart
[57:41] in what he was trying to do.
[57:44] Jeremiah is just observing.
[57:47] The clay is marred in the hand of the
[57:48] potter. It says, "So he made it."
[57:51] Again,
[57:53] another vessel as seemed good to the
[57:55] potter to make it.
[57:58] Then the word of the Lord came to me,
[57:59] saying, "Oh house of Israel, can I not
[58:00] do with you as this potter?" Sayaith the
[58:02] Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the
[58:03] potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, oh
[58:05] house of Israel.
[58:08] at what instance I shall speak
[58:09] concerning a nation and concerning the
[58:11] kingdom to pluck up and pull down and to
[58:13] destroy it.
[58:15] So in my mind, I try to put myself in
[58:17] the image of what Jeremiah was seeing
[58:19] and he saw I if he if he saw the the
[58:23] work upon the will, maybe he just didn't
[58:24] walk in and all this happens in an
[58:26] instance, but maybe he comes to the
[58:28] potter's house because he knows God's
[58:29] going to speak to him. And maybe he
[58:31] tries for some time watching the potter
[58:34] to uh take a wedge, take some clay and
[58:38] begin to wedge it and begins to work on
[58:40] it. He takes it and he begins to create
[58:42] make it a little smooth. He sees him
[58:44] throw it down on that bat and he sees
[58:46] him kind of press it down and then he
[58:48] starts to spin the wheel, maybe putting
[58:49] a little bit of water there, just making
[58:51] sure it's going to stick. And then as he
[58:52] takes it, he begins to pull it up and
[58:54] pull it down, pull it up and pull it
[58:57] down and begins to work on it a little
[59:00] bit. He start seems like he's getting
[59:01] something going, but then all of a
[59:02] sudden something begins to happen and
[59:05] and it gets it and he takes it and just
[59:07] takes it tears it down. He pulls it off
[59:10] and he takes this in this particular
[59:13] image. Now, from what I've seen is if
[59:15] pottery doesn't even properly dry, you
[59:17] can take all those fragments. You can
[59:18] put it in a bucket and you can go back
[59:19] and take the very things that didn't
[59:21] work out the first time because the very
[59:23] same clay goes through a process
[59:26] &gt;&gt; to be able to made back into a smooth
[59:27] lump that goes right back on the wheel.
[59:29] The clay doesn't get thrown away,
[59:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:31] &gt;&gt; It just has to go through a longer
[59:32] process. Listen, if your God's clay is
[59:35] never going to throw you away,
[59:36] &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, I just feel like I'm in
[59:38] a discard bucket. You're not going to be
[59:39] made a second. You're going to be made a
[59:41] new."
[59:42] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be sold as scraps.
[59:44] You're not going to be turned into uh
[59:45] fragments. You're not going to be used
[59:47] in some sort of art project of broken
[59:49] pottery. God's going to take that. It's
[59:51] may hurt. May take some time. May take
[59:53] some forming, some breaking down, some
[59:55] watering. You might have to get put
[59:56] through the h a press.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Might have to get folded in and in and
[1:00:01] over and over again.
[1:00:05] I'm forgetting what's the apparatus you
[1:00:08] use to flatten out your clay. Slab
[1:00:11] puller. Yeah, that's that's the kind of
[1:00:13] ministry I want. [laughter]
[1:00:15] Slab the puller. Hey, I that's what I
[1:00:19] want. Just I just want to flatten you
[1:00:21] out.
[1:00:24] Just joking.
[1:00:26] [laughter]
[1:00:26] But that's WHAT GOD DOES TO US
[1:00:28] SOMETIMES.
[1:00:30] What is it called a slab? What? roller.
[1:00:32] That doesn't sound as fun.
[1:00:35] Just roll with it. A slab roller.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know why guy has like a Russian
[1:00:42] sound to it. Slav roller. There's a
[1:00:47] process you'll have to go through if you
[1:00:48] don't do it right.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Something that may happen.
[1:00:54] And what what started to do in my heart
[1:00:57] when it when he comes to this point
[1:00:59] because I want you to think of how he
[1:01:00] takes that clay. God doesn't throw it
[1:01:02] away but he makes it takes that marred
[1:01:04] clay and he says and he made it again
[1:01:08] another vessel.
[1:01:11] Maybe it got off centered
[1:01:13] may and because it wasn't centered it it
[1:01:16] started to wobble and it got uneven and
[1:01:19] he takes that mashes it down. He picks
[1:01:23] it up and maybe he goes over to the the
[1:01:25] roller. He starts rolling it out again.
[1:01:28] Adds some water. Starts working on it.
[1:01:29] Works back through. Gets all the air
[1:01:31] bubbles out. Gets that smooth ball and
[1:01:33] he places it right back on. Same lump
[1:01:36] right back on it.
[1:01:38] And he says, "Behold, as the clay in the
[1:01:40] potter's hand, aren't you mine?" So the
[1:01:43] clay is not discarded. He says, "At what
[1:01:44] instance I shall speak concerning a
[1:01:46] nation to pluck up and pull down and
[1:01:48] destroy it?" I just saw this pulling and
[1:01:50] the coning and then it not working and
[1:01:52] he destroys it. But he says, "If that
[1:01:54] nation upon whom I pronounce judgment
[1:01:57] will repent, turn from the evil that I
[1:01:59] thought to do."
[1:02:01] He says, "What instance I shall speak
[1:02:04] concerning a nation and a kingdom to
[1:02:06] build and to plant it." I'm going to
[1:02:09] stop at that verse because notice how
[1:02:11] he's saying somehow someway the clay
[1:02:16] has something to do with it.
[1:02:19] He's saying as the clay is in the
[1:02:21] potter's hand and this is I think this
[1:02:23] is the reason why the amplification was
[1:02:25] given to it because you say well what
[1:02:27] power does the clay have what what can
[1:02:30] the clay do and yes the clay in the
[1:02:33] example literal example cannot say to
[1:02:35] the POTTER'S HAND I THINK I WOULD JUST
[1:02:37] RATHER BE A lump right throw me back in
[1:02:41] the ground there it it that doesn't have
[1:02:45] but what are you doing I don't know if
[1:02:47] this is True. And and brother Victor,
[1:02:51] I just imagine there's times when you're
[1:02:53] that clay is being formed and you say,
[1:02:55] "Why won't it just cooperate?
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Why isn't it why isn't it cooperate? It
[1:03:01] just seems like it has a mind of its
[1:03:02] own."
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; And here's God saying, "I can pluck it
[1:03:05] up, pull it down, and destroy it. But if
[1:03:07] this nation that is being destroyed will
[1:03:09] just repent,
[1:03:11] then I can build and plant it
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; again.
[1:03:17] In other words, brother Brandham is in
[1:03:19] one place was talking about how these
[1:03:21] the Calvinists got out on one limb. He
[1:03:23] said, "Then the Armenians came." He
[1:03:24] said, "What did God do?" He balanced it
[1:03:25] up. God will always balance it up. But
[1:03:28] the balance wasn't in the one side. It
[1:03:31] was taking the two sides together. Paul
[1:03:33] who said you're justified by faith,
[1:03:34] James who said you're justified by works
[1:03:36] showed us from two different
[1:03:37] perspectives, but both are in Christ
[1:03:40] rooted in the word of God. Amen.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; So we've we've we we must for our own
[1:03:49] selves then say, "Lord, I want to come
[1:03:52] back to center
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; as the clay. I I'm not going to try to
[1:03:57] force my own image. I I'm not going to
[1:03:59] just stand on my ring and just like, no.
[1:04:02] Uh-uh. This is where you're going to
[1:04:03] have to work on me." And he said, "Well,
[1:04:04] that's you're you're outside the center.
[1:04:08] I can't make you into what I want you to
[1:04:10] be. You've got to be centered. And so
[1:04:13] don't resist the potter's hands.
[1:04:16] You have this uniqueness of clay to
[1:04:18] where you can just yield and not lean
[1:04:20] and not push and not refuse, but just
[1:04:22] say, "Lord, I surrender.
[1:04:25] I surrender to your design. I surrender
[1:04:28] to your will."
[1:04:30] The great statement, I think it was by
[1:04:32] awtoer said, "There's nothing outside of
[1:04:35] the will of God I want, and there's
[1:04:37] nothing inside his will I fear.
[1:04:41] and using that maybe play on words. I'm
[1:04:44] in his will. I'm on his will. I'm in the
[1:04:47] center of his will. Therefore, there's
[1:04:49] nothing in his will I'm afraid of. And
[1:04:51] there's nothing outside of that will I
[1:04:53] want.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go back to the lump. I
[1:04:55] don't want to go back to THE DISCARD. I
[1:04:57] DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE Leodysian
[1:04:58] will. They have a grindstoneone. They
[1:05:00] have the nose to the will. They have the
[1:05:02] will that that Samson was turning in his
[1:05:05] imprisonment. But we want to be on the
[1:05:07] will of God
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; in spiritual food in due season. Brother
[1:05:10] B says if Jesus is the center of all
[1:05:12] things to the Christian then I think we
[1:05:14] ought to let loose of everything else
[1:05:15] and cleave to him.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Remember he is the center. HE IS THE
[1:05:19] NORTHSTAR. HE IS THE ULTIMATE. HE IS THE
[1:05:22] ABSOLUTE.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; This is the way that we ought to think
[1:05:25] about it.
[1:05:26] And and I know it may this may seem to
[1:05:28] be in poetical terms or in terms that
[1:05:31] hold phrases of of great worth and and
[1:05:36] you know there's a beauty to it when you
[1:05:39] say that oh Jesus is the center
[1:05:41] therefore I want to let loose of
[1:05:42] everything and cleave TO HIM. HE'S THE
[1:05:44] CENTER. HE'S THE NORTHSTAR. HE'S THE
[1:05:46] ULTIMATE. HE'S THE ABSOLUTE. THAT MUST
[1:05:49] BE TRUE.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY BY FAITH AND SUPERNATURALLY AND
[1:05:53] INTERNALLY, BUT IT MUST BECOME
[1:05:55] PRACTICAL.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, I say, Lord, if you're
[1:05:58] working on me, I want to CENTER ON YOU
[1:06:00] SO I CAN SEE THIS PRACTICAL OUTWORKING
[1:06:02] OF CHRIST. IF CHRIST IS THE CENTER, and
[1:06:05] I just put it here. He says, let loose
[1:06:07] of everything. He said, then you're the
[1:06:08] one that has to finish that phrase.
[1:06:11] How is it that I can be centered?
[1:06:15] How is it I become unentered? Musicians,
[1:06:17] as you come to your instruments, you
[1:06:19] find your place
[1:06:21] here at the front of the church as you
[1:06:23] yield your gifts to him.
[1:06:26] If Christ is the center, then you've got
[1:06:27] to let loose and cleave to him
[1:06:31] because he is the center.
[1:06:37] Christ, that little will in the middle
[1:06:38] of the will stabilize every move, every
[1:06:40] motion, every thought
[1:06:43] because he he's in the control tower.
[1:06:47] God setting that word right there from
[1:06:51] there in this earthn vessels. He's
[1:06:53] shedding forth light. This is how you
[1:06:56] become sunlit vessels, unwaxed, unglazed
[1:06:59] by the world, centered on Christ.
[1:07:03] Lord, I don't want my heart to be
[1:07:04] unentered.
[1:07:05] Use it as a litmus test for the next
[1:07:08] time things are not uh you're feeling
[1:07:10] agitated, you're feeling buffeted, it
[1:07:12] feels too extreme, it feels hurtful,
[1:07:13] just say, "Well, am I centered?" And
[1:07:16] then [music] you step back to center.
[1:07:19] But then now all of a sudden the
[1:07:20] pressure becomes proportional,
[1:07:23] right? And you're like, "Okay, all
[1:07:25] right. I'm in this pocket now." And
[1:07:27] yeah, I'm it still hurts, but I know
[1:07:30] it's making something beautiful.
[1:07:33] You have the quality
[1:07:36] of taking external pressure
[1:07:39] and internalizing [music]
[1:07:41] it into glory.
[1:07:44] External suffering being internalized
[1:07:46] [music] into character.
[1:07:49] Then every lump of coal is turned into a
[1:07:51] diamond.
[1:07:53] But you have been placed at the right
[1:07:56] depth, at the right temperature that
[1:07:58] through the right pressure, you're being
[1:08:00] [music] turned into because you're
[1:08:02] centered right where turned into a
[1:08:04] diamond.
[1:08:06] That's what God can do to you is he can
[1:08:07] turn you into that radiant diamond.
[1:08:14] I want there to be some soberness to
[1:08:15] your thoughts now before we go to
[1:08:16] prayer. I'd like for you to be praying
[1:08:18] for yourself. Brother Brandham, in the
[1:08:20] sermon, trying to do God a service
[1:08:21] without being the will of God. This is
[1:08:23] where he talks about sincerity a lot. He
[1:08:25] says he's in prayer. He says, "May our
[1:08:27] hearts continually be set on thee." And
[1:08:30] we know, Lord, that money, property,
[1:08:31] things of the world have no meaning,
[1:08:33] just so temporal.
[1:08:36] I I I developed a phrase just [music] to
[1:08:38] keep the devil from really trying to get
[1:08:40] at us when we have unexpected expenses
[1:08:42] and things happen. Is honey, it's just
[1:08:45] money.
[1:08:47] And some people like
[1:08:49] that's the only thing. But really,
[1:08:52] that's that's all it is. If I could keep
[1:08:55] my faith in [music] Christ, if if
[1:08:56] something comes up and I spend money, if
[1:08:58] I don't make as much as I thought it
[1:08:59] would, if there things get difficult,
[1:09:01] it's just money. He has us [music] in
[1:09:03] the palm of his hand.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Things of this world, money, property,
[1:09:08] have no meaning. It's just temporal. All
[1:09:09] of them must go. Our jobs, our places,
[1:09:11] our friends, everything must go. No
[1:09:14] matter how rich, how poor, how popular,
[1:09:16] unpopular we are, it all must go. But
[1:09:19] there's only one thing that our being
[1:09:21] here is centered around and that's Jesus
[1:09:23] [music] Christ.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; So yes, centered on him. We have jobs,
[1:09:29] we have places, we have friends, we have
[1:09:31] money, we have property,
[1:09:34] rich, poor, popular, unpopular, doesn't
[1:09:35] matter, but we're just centered on him.
[1:09:38] And we know that's what matters. That's
[1:09:39] what counts. That's what will last. He
[1:09:41] says, and that's Jesus Christ. So let us
[1:09:43] lay aside everything as secondarily
[1:09:46] and hold to him. and he is the [music]
[1:09:48] word. He says, "Grant it, Lord."
[1:09:51] So, you can have your secondary
[1:09:53] possessions.
[1:09:55] You can have your secondary things, but
[1:09:57] as it comes to him, I'm centered on him.
[1:10:00] Says, "Look, friend, there may be a
[1:10:02] little something. Maybe we just bow our
[1:10:04] heads. I want you now just to let these
[1:10:06] words deal with your heart." If you're
[1:10:08] not that, then there's something you've
[1:10:09] centered around besides that. In other
[1:10:12] words, if you can't lay aside everything
[1:10:13] else is secondary. If there's if you're
[1:10:15] not centered around him, if there's
[1:10:16] something in you that feels misshapen
[1:10:18] and uh uncomfortable, he says, then you
[1:10:21] aren't center you're centered on
[1:10:23] something. He says you're as close to
[1:10:24] it. You're looking at you see it. You've
[1:10:25] seen it for years. You see it coming
[1:10:27] matured now. Maybe you've been a
[1:10:29] Christian. You've seen these things.
[1:10:30] You've been associated with Christ. He
[1:10:32] says, but now you see it's not the
[1:10:35] center. If that means everything to us
[1:10:37] and nothing else is going to last but
[1:10:38] that, why not just turn your head from
[1:10:40] that thing you've been looking at and
[1:10:42] center yourself on him, which the center
[1:10:45] of all life and all hereafter is him? I
[1:10:49] say that to you right now with heads
[1:10:50] bowed. If if it's if he's not the center
[1:10:53] and you feel that he's not the center,
[1:10:54] but you you've been close to it and you
[1:10:57] see that it it should mean everything to
[1:10:59] us and nothing else is going to last but
[1:11:01] Christ, WHY NOT JUST TURN your head from
[1:11:03] that thing you've been looking at? Well,
[1:11:05] what is that thing you've been looking
[1:11:06] at? For a young person, it could be
[1:11:07] different things. For an uh for the
[1:11:10] young families, it could be something
[1:11:11] else from the just anyone who whom
[1:11:14] Christ is not the center. He says,
[1:11:16] "Whatever it is you've been looking at,"
[1:11:17] he says, [music] "Christ is the center."
[1:11:20] And as he's imploring them, it's just
[1:11:22] such a beautiful thought. He says, he's
[1:11:23] imploring them, and I know it's 11:42
[1:11:25] right here in Phoenix, Arizona today.
[1:11:27] [music] And he says, when he's
[1:11:29] preaching, he says, "Have you forgotten
[1:11:30] about dinner?" What's he say? Right now,
[1:11:32] in this moment, you should be thinking
[1:11:33] about Christ. But now we start thinking
[1:11:35] about where are we going to lunch? What
[1:11:36] about that meal in the crock pot? He
[1:11:38] says, "Have you forgotten whether the
[1:11:39] kids are all right?" He says, "Out in
[1:11:41] the car or not? Have you forgotten all
[1:11:44] about the past and realize what that is
[1:11:47] you're feeling right now?
[1:11:50] What is it you're feeling right now?
[1:11:51] What is it you have been feeling? What
[1:11:54] is it God has been speaking to your
[1:11:55] heart?" He says, "It's materializing
[1:11:57] before you day by day. Let that be the
[1:12:00] center of whatever.
[1:12:03] Let the rest of the things go away.
[1:12:04] They're going to perish anyhow. [music]
[1:12:07] Oh, just keep following after him.
[1:12:11] What is it THAT HAPPENS WHEN GOD STARTS
[1:12:13] DEALING WITH OUR HEARTS? OH, NO. I DON'T
[1:12:14] KNOW IF I CAN GIVE THAT UP. OH, NO. I
[1:12:16] DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO LOOK LIKE THIS.
[1:12:17] OH, NO. I DON'T KNOW. OH, I DON'T KNOW
[1:12:18] ABOUT THIS. I don't know about that. AND
[1:12:20] THERE'S A PART OF US THAT BEGINS TO LONG
[1:12:22] FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE SAY, "OH,
[1:12:24] BUT BUT I'M AFRAID OF WHAT THIS MIGHT
[1:12:26] MEAN. I'M AFRAID OF WHAT THIS MAY turn
[1:12:27] into." You said, "Well, don't don't
[1:12:30] worry about all of that.
[1:12:32] Don't worry about all these things that
[1:12:34] bring fearful sights and and anxiety.
[1:12:37] [music]
[1:12:39] Let Christ, the one that's been dealing
[1:12:41] with your heart, let that be the center
[1:12:42] and yield to it. He said, "Let
[1:12:44] everything else go away. I'm worried
[1:12:46] about my job. I'm worried about my car.
[1:12:47] I'm worried about my family. I'm worried
[1:12:49] about this. I'm worried about
[1:12:49] popularity. I'm worried about this. I'm
[1:12:51] worried about Let it all fade away.
[1:12:52] They're all going to perish anyhow.
[1:12:56] If you took it all to the grave, you'd
[1:12:57] be no different than the dead pharaohs
[1:12:59] that were buried with servants.
[1:13:01] riches and wealth and it just rotted
[1:13:03] alongside [music] them. Just keep
[1:13:06] following him.
[1:13:09] If you need prayer this [music] morning,
[1:13:11] I would ask that with every head bowed,
[1:13:15] if you'd like, if you want Christ to be
[1:13:16] the center, if you want to receive him
[1:13:18] even today for your brokenness, for your
[1:13:21] sins, like [music] to repent,
[1:13:25] you'd want to stand.
[1:13:27] So, Lord, here I'm coming to you. the
[1:13:29] song being played. Jesus [music] at the
[1:13:31] center of it all.
[1:13:33] Nothing else matters.
[1:13:36] What is it? He's dealing with you in
[1:13:37] your heart over
[1:13:39] say this is I don't know [music] what it
[1:13:41] means, brother Heron. I don't know what
[1:13:42] it means for my social life. I don't
[1:13:43] know what it means for my fashion. I
[1:13:45] don't know what it means for my friends.
[1:13:46] I don't know what it means for my
[1:13:47] future. But all I know right now, I want
[1:13:49] my life to be in his hands.
[1:13:52] That's what resolves depression and
[1:13:54] ideiations of harmful [music] sorts.
[1:13:56] It's what's going to cause you to be
[1:13:57] able to lay ever so awake at night and
[1:14:01] say, "I know it is well with my soul."
[1:14:04] And maybe we can say, "Lord, make it
[1:14:06] well [music] today. I come to you. I'm
[1:14:08] uncertain. I'm unsure. But Lord, I feel
[1:14:10] that you're telling me to rest. Just
[1:14:12] rest in not in the future, but in you
[1:14:15] now, the one who holds all things, the
[1:14:18] center of all life and the [music]
[1:14:20] hereafter. I come to you, Lord, with my
[1:14:22] brokenness, with my need for salvation,
[1:14:25] whatever it might be. If we could just
[1:14:28] stand together, joining those who've
[1:14:29] stood. I believe you've stood in the
[1:14:31] presence of God. I believe he sees your
[1:14:32] heart. He knows what you're going
[1:14:33] through. Our gracious heavenly father,
[1:14:35] today as we pray, I pray for these that
[1:14:37] stood.
[1:14:39] And Lord, covers quite a range of ages,
[1:14:43] circumstances, and situations. But
[1:14:45] truly, Lord, we could say
[1:14:49] that they stood in response to a
[1:14:50] singular Christ.
[1:14:54] And that each one in [music] their own
[1:14:55] particular way want to find themselves
[1:14:57] in the center of your will upon your
[1:15:00] potter's wheel.
[1:15:03] And not just on the will, but Lord, I
[1:15:05] want to be centered.
[1:15:08] Maybe we've been too happy with playing
[1:15:10] on the fringes.
[1:15:13] But Lord, I pray that you could just get
[1:15:15] me so solidly rooted on that spot.
[1:15:20] The pulling, the coning, the up and
[1:15:21] down, the mashing, the forming, the
[1:15:23] shaping. It may seem
[1:15:27] gratuitous over and over and all the
[1:15:30] thousands of revolutions [music]
[1:15:32] that that will makes,
[1:15:35] but yet it's all for the purpose of
[1:15:36] centering us. And Lord, I think of a
[1:15:39] church. We've had 500 some odd services,
[1:15:44] more than 500. Myself having preached
[1:15:46] around
[1:15:50] over 450 or something sermons in this
[1:15:52] church. Lord, you think, "Oh, man,
[1:15:53] that's a lot of revolutions. That's a
[1:15:55] lot [music] of spinning. Maybe a lot of
[1:15:57] the same things, but it's all for the
[1:16:00] purpose of making sure we're centered."
[1:16:04] Because if there is a new body that's
[1:16:05] being [music] materialized,
[1:16:08] if there is a new body that's being
[1:16:09] formed,
[1:16:11] it's going to be [music] perfect. It's
[1:16:13] going to be like your son's glorified
[1:16:15] body. Then Lord, I know that as you've
[1:16:18] gone to prepare a place for me that
[1:16:20] you're still working on me. Therefore,
[1:16:23] Lord, I pray for each one of these young
[1:16:24] people and the parents that stood and
[1:16:26] each believer that stood and said,
[1:16:28] "Lord, I I want to come back to the
[1:16:29] center,
[1:16:31] the center of it all." Lord, I I know
[1:16:34] I'm using platitudes and phrases,
[1:16:38] but what else can we do except now we
[1:16:39] just accept [music] you according to
[1:16:41] your promise and in your word and say,
[1:16:43] "Lord, I believe in you. I believe that
[1:16:44] you died for my sins. I believe there's
[1:16:47] no other way to be saved except through
[1:16:48] Jesus Christ. I believe he said to
[1:16:50] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:16:51] Jesus Christ. I believe in the promise
[1:16:54] of the Holy Ghost and I believe in the
[1:16:56] image of Christ that speaks through the
[1:16:58] word and I want to become that this
[1:17:01] Bible is your absolute
[1:17:03] and then I want to center my life on
[1:17:05] scriptural principles.
[1:17:08] Help us Lord to by that spirit which is
[1:17:10] in the inter inner man. May we be rooted
[1:17:14] and grounded in you. That Christ can
[1:17:16] dwell in [music] our hearts by faith
[1:17:18] that we may grow up into you in all
[1:17:19] things and that we might be filled with
[1:17:22] all the fullness of God.
[1:17:24] Bless us I pray as we commit the [music]
[1:17:26] these to you in Jesus name. Amen.
