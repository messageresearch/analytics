TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but um today we're wanting to continue on the subject of our family tree my subtitle is God's Grove and I trust that this would mean something to you as we continue the first service we took on this we called a vision of home and we took Drew a lot from uh certain elements in the scripture of in the book of uh Genesis and also kind of forward looking to the Book of Revelation just a lot of things that were kind of coming together and piecing together to see where we began and where the tree of life was and where it's going to be and we did it to kind of um rearticulate the vision that we have for our church and what I believe God desires to accomplish in a local church which kind of fed into last week's service on this church serves the true church kind of making sure that we recognize that as much pride that we may take in church and as much as we feel this is an important place of God and we have rules and we have certain responsibilities and obligations and we recognize that even a church is sovereign the local church is not sovereign or Master over the true church but the local church serves the true church and so today just want to take the subject of God's Grove and I felt that the Lord had Del just put it in my heart so strictly and so so particularly that I've uh taken a been very purposeful and made a deliberate effort to try to take a step higher myself personally and then desire to see the church take a step higher in the vision that God has has for us that we ought to be Visionary we ought to be thinking about what God wants us to do and we've been using the image of the tree as representative of Christ Christ is the tree of life and so you have Christ as the tree Christ is our family tree he is the vine we are the branches and then we even see that uh that tree then is represented of us as his body or the bride tree and then from that we can uh bring it to the tree is representative of our families and how we have our family identity and family respons responsibilities and then kind of taking that and looking at it in terms of this church and as you look at Genesis chap 21 verse 33 this is I'm just going to do a a deep dive into the scripture today and just um buckle up and follow with me on in this journey if this is a road trip you put your seat belts on if we're walking just keep Pace with me we're going to go on a journey in this scripture and we know that God deliberately uses symbols and certain actions in the Bible or certain actions in the Bible as symbols even uh to hold a mystery of his will like he acts he does something and when he does it he's kind of foreshadowing or he's expressing something about his character and so we just we don't just take any Scripture lightly and think oh well that's just filler or or that's just put in there to give us some backstory all of it has meaning and it stands for something and here in verse 33 it says and Abraham planted a Grove in berseba and called there on the name of the Lord the Everlasting ing God I'd like to take time in just going through almost every single element of this verse and we don't need to spend much time on Abraham and who he is but when he plants this Grove in berseba and calls there in the name of the Lord uh this is a symbol of our family tree it's a symbol of Christ it's a symbol of the body of Christ it's a it's even symbolic of our local church so there's a lot that we can gain by looking at this and this first action that I want to look at it says Abraham we know who Abra is it says he planted Nat in the Hebrew it's the act of fixing something or establishing something and so it's used of sewing seed and planting something you're fixing the seed in the ground and it's going to establish its root system and grow up so Abraham is I want you to catch kind of this thought that Abraham when he plants he's establishing something and in Genesis CH 2:8 it says and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden so when Abraham plants a Grove he's performing an act that is was previously associated with God and the first time we see an act of planting it's God that's establishing a garden first service in a vision of home we took a lot of time to look at how that that was a paradise this was God's paradise and in Genesis 2:8 if this is God's Eden and as God it being his possession it was his right it was his power to establish whatever he wanted in that Garden so he planted a garden as the only owner of that garden and then the next time that we see this act of planting It's associated with Noah in Genesis chapter 9 verses 18 to 20 and I want you to kind of catch who's there who's acting and who all is in the Earth and it says and the sons of Noah that went forth of the Ark were sham and ham and japeth and ham is the father of Canaan these are the three sons of Noah and of them was the whole earth overspread so when they come off the ark these are the owners of the earth these are the only inhabitant of the earth and it says and Noah began to be a husbandman which is speaking of cultivating fields and Vines and it says and he planted a Vineyard so now even Noah as the as the head of the earth under a promise even in Genesis chapter 9 uh uh God 91 God has telling to be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth so he's there H as one who's been given uh Dominion he's been given to power in a sense he's the owner of the earth and so now he plants just as God planted Genesis 2 God plants a garden now Noah coming as the owner of the earth he's he's planting just as God did and so when Abraham plants it's in the image of God when Abraham's planting again here he's planting in the same image of Noah Noah under a covenant Noah under a promise Noah acting according to God's will Abraham's doing the same thing so i' want you to recognize even this that Abraham's Act was uh moved by Revelation there was something behind behind what he was doing and it was an act of ownership just as God planted a garden in Eden and that was an act of ownership Noah planting a garden uh planting this Vineyard is an act of ownership this is Abraham planting this this Grove and it's an act of ownership taking ownership of the land that God had promised to him says in Romans 4:13 for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law so it was to Abraham and it was to his seed that he would be the heir of the world but it was not through the law but through the righteousness of Faith so Abraham is an heir of the world this he's doing something again that previously in scripture now we could always assume that people seed seeds and and planted things but the Bible is only referring to God is planting Noah is planting and now Abraham who's the heir of the world who plants a Grove as one who is heir of the world this is an act of one who owns the world though he may not possess it presently and though he may be as a stranger in this land it's an act of ownership to to plant this seed knowing that this has been given to me and my seed after me and so I'm really wanting you to C catch just in this I'm the reason why I'm going to these lengths uh and starting at this point is I really want you to catch the significance of Abraham's Act of planting and what he does there because it's connected with God's promise to it's it's God's promise to Abraham and the seed of God to come through Abraham in doing so in planting we we even mentioned this last time it's something that hearkens back to uh the Garden of Eden but then also forward looking to Christ he plants a tree this tree is going to point back to the Tree of Life in the beginning it's going to point back to the Garden of God the paradise of God but it's also pointing to the tree of life that's going to be in the new heavens and new earth it's pointing forward to Christ that one that would hang on a tree as it says in Galatians 3:16 now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ now that had to have aggravated a lot of the Jews I'm sure because they believe themselves to be you know Isaac is the seed and then them coming from the seed but yet the prophecy of God was to his seed singular Paul catches this Revelation that that seed that was to come was Christ and then through him retroactively families of the Earth would be blessed and then going forward families of the Earth would be blessed and that seed was Christ so when even when Abraham is planting this Grove there's even an image of Christ being the seed that swn into the ground because that Grove could only come by seed or by cutting taking taking taking a cutting or Branch off of a tree and planting it in the soil and so we know that the Bible calls Christ the seed and he's also the branch brother say he's the branch that was cut down he's the seed that had to go into the ground so Abraham is acting in such a way towards expressing the very nature of Christ as the seed that's sewed into the ground that's got to come forth as a brid tree it's the cutting of the Lord the branch that's cut down but is going to Blossom and Bloom again I appreciate you you all being very uh attentive this morning so it says Abraham planted a Grove in the Hebrew it's a shell this word is found two other times in the Bible it's translated to tree uh the most of Scholars agree and it's most often associated with a particular tree called the tamask tree and it is a this is a great symbol this tree is a great symbol so I want to begin to look at this AEL and the meaning of this word is it says he planted a Grove when the Hebrew Old Testament was translated into the Greek and the sep agent it says Abraham plowed fields and planted so it says Abraham planted a Grove in berseba the Hebrew into the Greek it gives this image of Abraham planting planting but plowing Fields And even says a shell is a field under tillage now this act of Abraham now being tilling the ground and cultivating things it brings us to Genesis 2:5 when God looks upon the Earth and said there was not a man to till the ground so when he made man in verse 15 and he's going to put him in the earth into the garden it says and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden this paradise it says to dress it and to keep it that means to till it so Abraham again here he is Abraham the one who's going to bring forth the seed of Genesis 3:15 through his lineage is acting in the image of what God envisioned for the man in the beginning to till the ground so now he's not only in the image of God in planting in the image of Noah in planting he's in the image of Adam who Adam was placed there in the Garden of Eden to dress and to keep the vineyard to keep the garden for the benefit of future generations for the benefit of those seeds that would come forth for the benefit of creation and his wife so he placed God placed them in the garden with the ministry for the benefit of others and so this is shell in different translations a number of different translations it's translated as Grove and some places it's translated as a plantation or an orchard or Abraham cultivated a field even in some places they render an oak but in all these different ways of looking at it and taking that AEL and translating that word Abraham is creating a paradise Abraham is creating a garden it's a pleasure ground as it's referred to in the paradise of God it's a even a park is how some people view it it is a Grove the Bible says Abraham planted a Grove and it was God's Grove and Abraham's planting had meaning and purpose uh Beyond himself self when he planted this it was it was not just for his reputation it was not just an expression of his personality uh this was not a flex by Abraham where he said well I'm going to show these Philistines I'm going to plant a tree in their backyard and that's enough there on Genesis 2 uh 15 there's when he did this it was not uh it was not an act of rebellion it was not an act to send up signals it was not it was not just for pretense it was not for popularity I think even you could say that if you plant a tree you wouldn't do it in your neighbor's yard right if you're going to plant something you do it in something that was yours something that was uh that was uh had some meaning to it but it we shouldn't look at it as Abraham doing something to cause attention and bring it to himself but a Grove and I want to take time to do this a Grove is synonymous with worship and sacrifice and in this act as you would see that um God in the beginning would plant a garden and then Place Adam in it to till it and to dress it and to cultivate it and now Abraham in this Fallen Earth and even in the same general area perhaps that Adam would have been is now planting and cultivating a Vineyard or planting a Grove it evokes and it brings up the true image of worshiping the true God this image of offering of planting a Grove and it says in there called calling on the name of the Lord the Everlasting God we ought to recognize this Grove was a symbol of worshiping God in spirit and in truth it's not foreign for Abraham to build an altar and to Worship in Genesis 12:8 and it said he removed from th unto a mountain on the east of bethl and pitched his tent having bethl on the west and ha on the East and there he builded an altar unto the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord this was something that Abraham did by practice this something he was not ashamed to do and we might have different images of what an altar would look like there's a lot of uh historians that suggest that Abraham even in his root out of Heron and coming down into uh into the promised land would have seen these oblisk and these spires and these places of worship and these tall altars to false gods but an altar could have been just a simple single Stone didn't have to be something great or didn't have to be something High it didn't have to be something beautiful it could have been a collection of several Stones uh that's all it took for an altar even just a flat ground it was a place that was consecrated to offer worship to God so it wasn't a cathedral didn't have to be a temple it even was open air it was not something that would have a sign and a parking lot it was a place where to magnify God and in Abraham's case he's the only one who has a revelation of the true God so he's the only one that's wor worshiping in this manner so he wouldn't need a big house he wouldn't necessarily need a lot of chairs he wouldn't need a parking lot he wouldn't need a big Temple he could just have a place where he could begin to worship but as the as the as it evolved and the worshippers increased as the Revelation would increase that altar would change and evolve with it but when Abraham plants a Grove he's establishing a place as the Bible says to call on called there on the name of the Lord it means to invoke the name of the Lord it was a place to worship God to declare his name something is being lifted up so it was a place of prayer it's a place of meditation it was a place of exaltation and it was open air it was visible it was a place of public worship and I want to catch this because this is the theme I want to come to in the end it was a place of service not just church service but a place of ministry and service and through time though when we say Grove now a lot of us associate a Grove with a place of false worship or idolatry because in this image Abraham planted a Grove others may have been planting Groves and worshiping false gods but in this case it was something to the true God there's no idolatry in Abraham's act but in time even this act of Abraham is co-opted by his seed and done in the worship of false deities in Exodus 34:13 it says but ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down their Groves now it's important to make this connection ction The Grove that Abraham planted is that aell it's it's a tree it's translated to tree but here Grove is actually a translation of aser the Babylonian goddess not even the same word not even really that close there's some that try to make some connection with aelle and Asher but this whenever God is using in this context and this word Grove is a translation of Asher it's it's a Prohibition against idol worship this Grove was not it's not a Prohibition against worship it's not a Prohibition against altars it's a Prohibition against idol worship it's not a Prohibition against trees all the arborist are condemned and but this is a Prohibition to worshiping false gods in Deuteronomy 16:21 Thou shalt not plant thee a Grove of any trees that word Grove there is a translation of Ashera Babylonian goddess not PL plant a Grove of any trees near unto the altar the Lord thy God which Thou shalt make thee it's not saying that it's wrong to plant trees but it was a worship don't plant a a a a place of worship to a false god near the altar of the Lord don't combine them don't join them together in Isaiah 1:29 it says for they shall be ashamed of the Oaks which you have desired now why would it say they to be ashamed of just an oak tree and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen what is it referencing false worship right a tree a a a the trees that establish the The Grove to a false deity the the things that they fashion and form to be some sort of offering and worship to a false god The Oaks and the gardens that they've desired and chosen these are all expressive of false worship but the Grove that Abraham planted though perverted by others in its true form was an offering was a a worship to the one true God am Bible says he planted a Grove it was a tree that he planted as I mentioned before it's believed to be the tamarisk tree this word is used in two other places in 1st Samuel 22:6 when Saul heard that David was discovered and the men that were with him now Saul Abode in giba under a tree in Rama having a spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him this word when it says he he Abode and giya under a tree that's the same word when it says Abraham planted a Grove saw abat and give you under a Grove is what one could say but it's actually referring to a tree Abraham planted a tree a tamus tree and and aell is what he planted now I want you just to kind of catch the scene here Saul is the king of Israel he's abiding in giba and where is he he's under this tree it's a place where King held Court this is where he was with his advisers this is where he's finding rest and respite this is where he's finding tree uh shade so it's a noble tree it's a place where King could come and sit under and then advise his counselors and and take leave from the elements the harsh elements of the of the day so this is the only the second time this word is mentioned and it's a king abiding under in the shade then in chapter 31 of the same book it says all the men valent Ro men Rose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of bethan and came to jabish and burnt them there and they took their bones and buried them under AE tree at jabes and fasted seven days this is only the third time and the last time that this word aelle and this particular word that's used for Abraham planted a tree this is the third third time it's used and it's a tree under which King Saul is buried it's a place of resting it's a a place of Memorial it's the same tree the same word in Genesis 21 now the tree that many think it is is the Tams Aila this is a picture of that tree a a a rendering of it this is the tree that they believe it would be I I chose this picture cuz I like the fact that it just seems to be thriving in a Barren desert nothing else around it no grass underneath it no other vegetation and what a what a welcome relief that would be if you were in that sun we'll we'll experience it later on today when we all go stand under this tree over here uh uh which will be our family tree probably a place to get out of the out of the Sun but the I want to ponder what this tree represents and even in its natural form and natural purpose uh because its purpose speaks of the reality and symbolism of Abraham's act when Abraham planted this tree it had meaning behind it it held a mystery of God and on this tree you can't see it here but it has small needles not really leaves but small needles like pine needles on small branches so it kind of has like a pine like look and the tree itself is adapted for desert conditions and those of us in Phoenix say amen and one particular aspect about this tree is I think it's called the salt Cedar and and ethline in Australia it's it's considered an evasive species and everywhere else uh even in Arizona and Australia but yet this tree uh has very unique characteristics there's a lot maybe 90 different U species of a Tams but this particular one the saila one is the one I'm talking about and it has this characteristic that during hot days it it uh secrete salt and and you are the salt of the earth and as the salt dries it secret salt which dries but then during the night that salt actually absorbs water from the air wow and then the next day as the the heat begins to come on that water begins to evaporate cooling the air under the tree and so it actually has these natural elements to where it's suitable for shade to provide shade from the Sun almost natural air conditioning just through the way that it secretes salt and then absorbs moisture from the air and then as that heat comes on it it begins to uh evaporate that's what sweating does that that evaporation is to cool the body off and so it was it's a source of shade a source of cooling a source of rest and it's even planted very often it was in the in many different places as a break from the wind because of its leaves and its fullness it would be a shield from the wind this type of tree is long lived I found one one particular place that suggested that it could grow for 400 years it's a hardwood tree can grow very tall up to 50 feet and it's considered an evergreen and it this particular tree is resistant to Drought it can thrive in a desert it's resistance to heat it can actually uh be even resistant to Fire and this one tree Grove that Abraham plants it says Abraham planted a Grove in the translation strict translation Abraham planted a Tamaris tree it's significant considering the events that transpired in this chapter I believe God arranges these things and this story unfolds in a particular way just to give indication of the significance of this event Genesis chter 17:5 he says neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee it says in chap verse 6 and and you will be exceedingly fruitful Abram was exalted father but now it is Abraham which means a father of a multitude so Abraham is not just acting as the father of one Ishmael or even just a father of one Isaac later but he's acting as a father of many to come a father of many nations a father of a multitude so when he plants this tree this may be the kind of the what really inspired this whole thought to me on or this is where it began just to unfold to me that when Abraham plants this this isn't a tree for himself this isn't even a necessary tree just for his enjoyment but this was a tree for Generations this was a tree for his seed it was a family tree especially considering the events that take place at the beginning of this chapter in verse one it says and the Lord this is Yahweh Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah CED conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom Sarah buried to him Isaac this very chapter begins with Jehovah visiting Sarah and Sarah conceiving in bringing forth the promised son so this chapter really opens up and God finally fulfilling his promise to Abraham that he would have a son not after the Bond woman but he would have a son after Sarah in verse eight and the child grew and was weaned and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned they believe they'd be around two years old probably no later than three that he had he had made it through maybe this uh careful time and he' made it out of no longer a toddler now coming into this young childhood and say he survived this treacherous time he's growing up he's healthy so they have a big celebration but then notice what happens what what comes into view at this time and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had had born unto Abraham mocking so ishmail is mocking why because he's still the first born wherefore she said unto Abraham now this is Sarah about this other son cast out this Bond woman Hagar and ishmail cast out this Bond woman and her son for the son of this Bond woman shall not be air with my son even with Isaac now it may sound as if there's just a little bit of jealousy Sarah regretting her suggestion that Abraham have a son by her her servant and now she's saying get rid of the woman won't even call him by name get rid of his son won't even call him by name and it says this thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son so Abraham has his wife pressing him on one side and now he's trying what what should I do now notice What God Says verse 12 and God said unto Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy Bond woman don't let it grieve you don't be troubled in all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be called in other words it just wasn't merely Sarah's wishes but it was actually God's will when she said get rid of the Bond woman and get rid of his son and God says do as she said and also of the son of the Bond woman will I make a nation because he is thy seed so God still has a promise and a blessing and a benefit to ishmail and then Abraham acts and Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered Into the Wilderness of Sheba and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs it's a striking contrast as ishmail this son of bondage the son of the Bond woman sits under a shrub under a bush and you have this image of the one who is not Heir under a shrub but the one who is going to be the heir is left with his mom and dad separate and and separated out it's even unique that it would bring this image of a child under a shrub before Abraham plants this tree now notice how Paul touches on this in Galatians chapter 4 in verses 22 to 23 for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a free woman but he who is of the Bond woman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise am so here in Genesis chap 21 you have the family coming to be Abraham and his wife have no children but God has made a promise to them and then Abraham at Sarah's suggestion has a child by her servant and God tells them no he's not going to be there oh let ishmail live before you let him be the heir and he says no it's not going to be through Hagar but your wife Sarah that visitation of Elohim there H before his tent door your wife Sarah is going to conceive it next year according to the time of life I will visit Sarah and she will conceive and she will bring forth a son and he will be the one who is the heir he will be the one who is the seed that I promised you and now the very language of the word of God is that ishmail is that child of the Bond woman Isaac is the child of the free woman he who is of the Bond woman is after the flesh but he of the free woman is After the Promise after God so now these two sons though they have the same father in in the scripture they have two different promises two different inheritances and they have two different designations CU you can say well Abraham and his two sons but God doesn't want the picture to look like that so in verse 28 it says and now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of Promise so now you see how beautiful this is for us we are the children of promise just as Isaac was the child of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son this is the Commandment of God this is what the Bible says this is what God wanted cast out the Bond woman her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be air with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free what is being expressed here when it says and Abraham planted a tree it was a family tree he plants a tree Jehovah visits Sarah at the beginning of this chapter it ends with uh Abraham calling on the name of the Lord having planted a tree there in berseba and begin to call upon the name of the Lord he plants a tree and it's symbolic of this family tree that is now put forth another Chute Abraham and Sarah now the fruit of this tree the fruit of this Union a branch has shot off that vine this is the seed of this of this Union this is the one through whom the promises going to come but at the same time another shute's been pruned off so this family tree comes into view it's not through Ishmael it's not through all these other seeds but the True Vine is identified when Abraham plants this tree in berseba it's the image of a family tree in its physical manifestation and what it would have meant literally to them but also in its practical application and its symbolism Abraham planted a family tree and notice what it says in verse 34 Genesis 21 1: 34 3 34 and Abraham sojourned in the Philistines land many days this tree became a place that Abraham worshiped God in the presence of the Philistines if I gave you the impression that I was going to be lengthy this morning I don't think I'm going to be lengthy I'll leave that up to you but I I I say this because I feel that I'm I'm going to be able to uh wrap this up even maybe very soon because it's just a very simple thought I'm trying to convey and I'm I've arrived at it if you followed me this far in this that this planting of a tree the way that Abraham's acting what it's connected to what it stands for it represent something to us today this was not a selfish act when he planted this tree right as I mentioned before it was for the fut it was for future Generations his son now being born and celebrating his weaning he sees now that his seed is going to continue after him he sees the Bond woman cast out he sees uh ishmail go and they're going to be blessed God says I'm going to take care of them even God speaking to Hagar says he's going to grow he'll be fine and now Abraham realizes here's him and his wife and his son and so when he plants this tree he's actually planting it for his family because when you plant a tree you don't plant for immediate fulfillment any anybody ever said you you want to build a house you want to plant a tree and you just have this idea of a tree you can build a tree housee in a and you can get oranges and everything and so you go you go by the tree and you're like uh how long till I can get oranges off of this like well if it even does it we're talking years right and it takes years and years for these things to be able to fruit and it takes years and years for them to be able to grow so when Abraham planted a tree he didn't it just wasn't like one of these magic sponges you know it just it's this small and then you throw it put it in the ground and the next morning like wow what a beautiful Oak it wasn't a Jack in the beanstock it's not something for temporary fulfillment when you plant a tree you're not looking to get something out of it the next day you're not looking to get something even out of it that year it's something when you plant you're forward looking when you plant a tree you Planet knowing I'm putting a lot of work into this ground and I'm sewing seed and I've got expenses and I'm doing a lot of stuff uh in this moment and I'm not I may not even be able to enjoy it for a very very long time but if I care for it I plant it right I care for it I water it I keep it protected and and the life in that seed does its job one day others will be able to benefit even if it's not myself others will be able to benefit from it so it was proactive he planted this tree with a vision of a future shade you plant a tree with the vision of future fruit not something in the morning or even the next year you plant it as protection you plant it as a place of enjoyment but it's always for the benefit of others who come after you Genesis CH 1: 29 it says and God said behold I've given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the Earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for me me why did God plant trees it wasn't a mistake he wasn't trying to make a man and actually made accidentally made a tree it wasn't just like what I what my artwork was always when I was growing up was just you know just do something and try to make sense of it God planted them deliberately and purposefully he planted trees he planted a paradise for his family to enjoy it isn't that what brother bam talked about when he when he preaches on future your home and things that are to be and he talks about God creating and doing things he said God knew you'd like this and God knew you'd like that and he did certain things with you in mind and with certain things in View and none of it was by chance and none of it was a mistake but God was very deliberate and purposeful and he created a paradise that was our emphasis in a vision of home is this is God's paradise and as an extreme parent he created a paradise and he thought of all the amenities and all the opportunities and everything he put in it he was thinking how can my son and his family my son and my daughter enjoy this Eden enjoy this Garden I'll put trees in there for shade I'll put them in there for fruit and I'll let them have these trees so that they can enjoy and in this tamask the roots go deep and the desert the water table the water stores aren't shallow they've got to go very very deep right and because they have to go very very deep to get the water they can grow really really tall they grow equally as high providing shade this tree is so can be so large that it produces beams and wood that are suitable for carpentry I thought about that just imagine if perhaps Abraham in his journeys had taken a cutting of a Tamarisk and planted it there in Hein planted it there in berseba and it gets propagated throughout the land and years later it's the tamis tree that Christ is a carpenter with these beams are suitable for construction suitable for building a house and this picture I have for you is the one on the right is the rendering of a Tamarisk in Israel but the one on the left does anybody recognize the one on the left it's in Gilbert Arizona does that help is there a clue there it's at Joe's Farm Grill I'm not getting paid for this I'm not guti I'm just telling you this is there's it at Joe's Farm Grill excuse me my clip is clipping here back here but there's two tamas trees two large tamas trees they say they're over a hundred years old and this is a picture go back to the other one if you could John the one there on the left that's how tall this tree can be look how how much shade it would be in the beams in the next picture this is not you could sit under this and eat it it kind of maybe were features of the of the Landscaping there there's even a Road in Gilbert called Tamers uh Avenue a road this is a tree that's suitable for the desert this is a tree that when it grows it looks like this it's a tree that could provide wood it could provide shelter provide shade and now moving on in Genesis chapter 21 veres 30 and 31 Abraham planted this tree in a place he called he named berseba now this is coming to I I I just love how the the the rhythm of this is going I just feel like it's moving well this is identifying when we come to this this place be Sheba we're identifying the purpose of our family tree says in Genesis 21: 30 and 31 and he said for these seven you Lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that I have dig this well it's a conflict between Abraham after he'd been given back Sarah by AMC the conflict between Abraham and AMC's people where there was a fight over the well and they claimed that there was AMC's servants claimed it was their well Abraham said it was his so he gives these seven UL Lambs uh to be a witness that this was Abraham's well and they had this treaty they had this agreement and they lived in peace he says wherefore he called that place so it's Abraham that calls the place berseba even to where when it says that Hagar went out it's kind of using what would future future be named berse B went out into the same Wilderness Abraham called this place berseba because there they swear both of them there was an oath there was a Tre there was peace that came berse is The Well of seven or The Well of the oath it's at root it has a root of seven and even the root to swear they have the same letters the bees siba and it means The Well of seven or The Well of a Sevenfold oath and in other places it's The Well of the lion it's remarkable because here's Abraham's standing there and he gives this oath The Well of The Lion The Well of the Sevenfold oath and it marked the southernmost border of the promised land which then later belong to the tribe of Judah the lion nine times in the Old Testament you'll find the phrase from Dan to berseba and it's used to describe the entire promised land that went nine times from Dan to berseba from Dan to bers why indicating that when Abraham planted this it was it be in the southernmost border it's almost as if it this was the beginning a locking point a stopping point that now from here in the sense that this is where I've established and fixed a border and it's going to fill up and the rest is going to be the promised land and thean and this is a a significant Place Beba this land of oath The Well of the lion this is where Abraham planted a tree it held meaning it held significance he planted a Grove it was to be a Grove of worship because there he called on the name of the Lord so we find it coming up in other places in the story of Israel even in the next chapter after Abraham offers Isaac upon the Altar and God sees that he will not spare his son his only son it says in Genesis 22: 18 and 19 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice so now this is Abraham on the top of that mountain at this climax of this mountain he takes this he takes Isaac and he's going to sacrific him upon an altar God stays his hand and remember he carried wood up that hill he took the wood up that hill to offer the offering the one thing they lacked was the lamb or the ram God provided the ram Abraham bore the wood I wonder where he got the wood took it from trees he took it planted he cut these things down he he had he had wood that he gathered from where he began and it says in verse 19 so Abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to berseba and Abraham dwelt at beers Sheba the Bible says he sojourned in the Philistines land many days he dwelt this was not just a temporary Gathering he was not just there for just a few days but he dwelt there a long time many days and after even going Upon This Mountain he comes back to berseba in Genesis chapter 26 it's the place that Isaac comes back to and he went up then to berseba and the Lord appeared unto him the same night and said I am the god of Abraham thy father fear not for I am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent there and there Isaac's servants digged a well it's the place that Isaac returns to right there in berseba the same place where Abraham built an altar he had dug a well he he planted a Grove and Worship the Lord now his own son coming back to the same place it says and the Lord appeared unto him so it's the place that God appeared it's a place that he builds an altar it's a place that he worships Genesis chter 46 Jacob now comes right back to Israel he says and Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to berseba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father Isaac noce it was a place that they would return it was a particular place that had meaning had significance it was the place where Abraham the only place in Scripture that Abraham plants anything he plants a Grove he plants a tree he returns to worship there he stays there and lives Isaac comes and worships there God Appears to him and speaks to him there and then Israel comes back to that very place and offer sacrifices unto God in all the different places we could speak of berseba there's many but one in particular that we've been studying the Lord will and we'll touch on it here in the future but in First Kings chapter 19 after the conflict with Jezebel it's in berseba where Elijah flees and sits under a juniper tree and it's there under the that juniper tree that he begins to rest and in his weariness he says it is enough and what does God do he begins to touch him he begins to feed him begins to minister to him in these places in these instances we've just mentioned it's a place where they worshiped was a place where God appeared to them it was a place where they were rest they rested it's where they were fed it's a place God spoke this is what's significant about planting a tree in beers Sheba and with my closing thoughts I'd like to just read the verse again Genesis 21:33 and Abraham planted a Grove in Bersa and called there on the name of the Lord the Everlasting God this is God's Grove this Grove I think just in these few simple things I wanted to share with you this morning it holds a beautiful mystery Abraham planting in the image of God the image of an own owner Abraham tilling in the image of Adam Abraham in this Grove becoming a place of worship planting a tree which was a a sign of nobility a place of shade a place of rest a tree that he plants after his son after Sarah is born it's a family tree it's a tree that he plants for future Generations a tree that he plants once he's made peace with the bimc it's a tree that he plants in in in recognition that his son has been weaned it's a tree that he plants with a forward-looking vision as he sojourns in the land of the Philistines many days something proactive something to be done to set forth to hold a beautiful mystery as I mentioned this before I want to close on this thought it was not a shrine to Abraham this was not a legacy to his personality this was not a boast of his wealth or the his particular skill as a husbandman but it was a place to declare God it was a place to worship God and Abraham planted a Grove in berseba and called there on the name of the Lord in the Grove in that place where he planted this tree in this place where he tilled the ground in this place that he uh provided this paradise this Grove this park there he called on the name of the Lord the Everlasting God as I mentioned before Abraham planted a Grove of the Hebrews a shell and in the Hebrew uh studies and the Hebrew academic and the talud and all the rabic literature all interpretations agree that the intention of this tree this is what it means to a Hebrew so I want to emphasize this this is what it meant to a Hebrew all interpretations agree that it was int the intention was Hospitality he didn't plant the tree for himself and it wasn't that's my tree and you can't touch it and this is mine and this is I put my swing in it I put this is my shade this is my air conditioning different interpretations that say he planted a Grove and they interpret it as an orchard for food and that food would provide the fruit of that tree would provide food to Travelers who had passed by in the rinic uh tradition the very letters that form a shell or an acronym and the ALF and the and the words that are used it's feeding drinking and accompaniment even lodin is the other one that some use there it's an acronym to feed to drink and to supply said that in this a shell in this planting a Grove in this word what it means to them and what was intended and what Abraham did it was to provide Hospitality not for himself but for others and that in feeding and drinking and providing lodging or accompaniment or amenities and supplies it's all the proper elements to be a good host that your guest would arrive safely and depart safely that they would arrive though needy they would leave taken care of and they would have everything that they need and and please just if you focus here I know maybe H H uh uh you're bracing for a long day we're going to have a second service and it's all the weather's starting to get hot and we've just come out of a long week and a holiday weekend uh but I think some of the kids are already out so it's it's it's summertime B stay with me for a few more moments but this the Hebrew teaching say this blessed me so much this is what they teach that Abraham's in invoking so it's just not it says and Abraham called there on the name of Lord it wasn't going lord lord lord lord that's not what he was doing just wasn't barking out a name but he was invoking something that his that they say that Abraham's invoking of Elam comes by the means of Asel in other words he didn't just say Lord Lord Lord Jesus Jesus Jesus but the asell is how he invoked the name he planted this Grove this Orchard this place of lot drinking feeding accompaniment this place of Hosting he he planted it and it was from that that he invoked the name of Jehovah he invoked the name of Elam in other words by the means of his Hospitality to all whom he would encounter it would be through that that the Everlasting God was exalted and the so in the tal listen to what they write I just want to read read it to you because you you'd know I couldn't come up with this says Our Father Abraham caused the name of the Blessed Holy One to be uttered by the mouth of every pass every passer by how was this because now I want you to think of our family tree amen I want you to think of what this church represents how how how we're supposed to what the vision would be for this family tree for this church what the vision should be for our families how we view ourselves and our calling and our service to one another we don't re a big beautiful building so that everybody Drives By and laughs at the Marquee they're not looking at wealth they're not looking at amenities they're not looking at all the things that we might have but notice what it says that it his name would be uttered the name of the Blessed Holy One would be uttered by the mouth of every passer by how was this after Travelers had eaten and drank they stood up to bless Abraham but he said to them did you eat of mine you ate of that which belongs to the god of the the universe instead you should thank praise and bless the one who spoke and the world came into being Hallelujah think of that he provided an opportunity for those who could come and partake in the hand of God's creation and the the things that God has provided the benefits and blessings that the exalted father can could bring God himself and they would be blessed by it and they would hear it and they would feed on it and they'd be enriched by it and then if they went to thank Abraham he said says you didn't receive it from me this came from God and that you should bless the one who spoke and the world came into existence this is how Abraham invoked Elam how he invoked the name of the Everlasting father it came by the means of the tree it came by the means of the Grove it came by the means of the place that he provided that he would not just serve himself but he would serve others John Wesley even concluded that the same and he says and called there on the name of the Lord probably in the Grove he planted which was his oratory or House of Prayer he kept up for public worship to which probably his neighbors resorted and joined with him so Wesley says men should not only retain their goodness wherever they go but do all they can to propagate it and make others good that's the image of the Grove that's the image of God's Grove there wasn't a selfish Vision a plantet unto a Hebrew Abraham planted a Grove it was a place of hospitality it was a place of service and God would be known through the service God would be known through the labor God would be known through the giving God would be known through what Abraham was doing to the stranger do not thank me but instead you should thank and praise and bless as the one who spoke and the world came into being in berseba Abraham planted a Grove to declare the Everlasting God it was God's Grove amen it was a planting it was a tree to honor God and it says and it was to the Everlasting God says call they call on the name of the Lord in Genesis 12 it said he called on the name of the Lord but now for the first time this attribute of the everlasting God has introduced not yet mentioned not yet written and even though Abraham would not have known him in his fullness as Everlasting God it's in this moment something in this planting something in this labor in this service in this image the Bible God wants Moses to write that there he called on the name of the Lord and it's invoked the Everlasting God the strong one the self-existing one amen it was God's Grove and there's still treat Tre today that exist in the same area that Abraham planted this tree and there's trees in that area that exist and they see these outcroppings and they see these areas of these tamis trees and they know that this indicated past Dwelling Places that somebody lived here before to think that all those years ago around 2000 BC here is a planting of a tree and thousands of years later those trees still exist today right who would have thought they would be lasting till today Abraham because he called upon the god of him who would be his God forever forever the Everlasting God there's a legend that says that it takes 400 years for a tamas tree to grow fully and completely and interesting enough I say it's a legend because I I wasn't able to confirm it because some of these can actually grow quite rapidly and they do last they live over 100 years and they're easily propagated so really no matter how you look at it this this thought when I saw that it could take 400 years to grow in this one Legend it's remarkable when you do the math about 400 years later his seed would be returning out of bondage in Egypt and come into a promised land that would have shade trees the very seeds that Abraham planted one day his seed would return to who knew they would still be there Abraham did who knew they would be needed Abraham did amen so it was an act of Revelation it was an act of service and sacrifice Abraham planted a tree this is a type of our family tree should be a type of Our Family Vision should be a type of our church Vision I thought a lot about of course it's easy when talking about trees you could just start just just thinking about trees and trees and trees and you'll feel super spiritual as you drive around because everywhere you see trees but what's been standing out to me as we mentioned in Prior Services is here the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and it's from The Taking of the wrong tree that caused death but Christ is the tree and The Taking of the wrong tree was a mixing mixing of trees mixing of seed and it's Christ the Tree of Life That's hung on another tree and it's through his death hanging there on Calvary the carpenter the Tree of Life hanging on a tree that that the blood is shed forever consecrated in a way that we could be the vines the branches of that vine and in my my closing quote here at least that I have for the slide and brother Bram writes in the church age book chapter 3 says for here was one who lived by it is written and that Masterpiece of God overcame by reflecting God's word are we not also the Masterpiece again amen and we overcome by reflecting God's word he says then was this manifested perfect one given to the Cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life and then that life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the word of God and now to these sons of God who by him overcome are given the privilege of the paradise of God and the constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ that's what this church ought to represent Sons and Daughters of God who have eaten of the tree of life it's freely been given and it's enabled us to overcome and now reflect the God's word partaking of this tree of life and that we then now being given the privilege of the paradise of God we then want others to come as Abraham planted a tree that others could come to know the Everlasting God that is our vision that is our mission it's part of our Christian experience that this is not just for me alone but this blessed peace that I have I'm a partaker of this Paradise of God oh that others would come to know him as I have known him I went through and was just reading I've been studying so much in this subject matter it astounded me that in every single service that brother brandham preached on the Seven Seals All Seven Seals he's saying I love him and purchase my salvation on calvary's tree every single service I love him for he purchased my salvation he first loved me and purchased my salvation on calvary's tree calvary's tree on calvary's tree that we might partake of the tree of life and we're given the privilege of the paradise of God can invite the musicians to come in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed there is uh I I I I this just kind of a side comment you know when anybody ever ask you says you need to read a word to the church church you know something's going on right but I'm not going to read the word of the church just after he gives that word to the church we here you bind closer together and the things that he expresses in that but I want to read where he begins to pray before he preaches Christ as the mystery of God revealed I'm closing with this I don't have the slides I just want you to ponder this it's prayerful so if you could just open your hearts to hear what he has to say he says Lord Jesus speaking to this body of church the church that they should hold together with God's unchanging hand their absolute the word warning them as Paul warned his flock that there would be wolves entered in he's praying now you're the same God God today as you were then and the enemies the same may this fellowship and bonds of love always exist amongst the people these people in Christ Jesus help this morning Lord as we read the word May the Holy Spirit reveal it to us that the church might be fully established in the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to hold them and may as you gave the vision some two years ago to store up food fine healthy looking vegetables that I saw in the vision being stored up here in this Tabernacle may we today receive a whole bar barrel full of that that beautiful what an image of even what brother bam was doing storing up these things on T this is forward looking this is him having a vision there'd be future Generations we're here feeding on this benefiting from this he says or a tap load that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we live he wasn't just planting it for 63 it was for 2022 amen that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we live to give us sustaining strength the spiritual strength for the task that lays ahead Grant it father then a little bit of a detail bless these thy children there in here this morning from many different parts of the nation a hot sticky morning but yet we feel the presence of the holy spirit in all this we think of John Wesley and Calvin and sanki Knox finny and many of those even without electric fan where people sat in Halls perspiration running down their faces the women well covered and dressed sat in the audience and perspired to their clothing with soaking wet listening to the word of God feeding their souls I didn't plan it to be this warm but it's worked out just perfect he says now we feel Lord that they are at rest somewhere Yonder waiting for the coming of the Lord Keep Us Together father let the holy spirit guide us and direct us give us long life of service for you and this state Christ is a mystery God revealed is what he's preaching give us this great message this morning that we're expecting out of Thy word that it might go to each heart make lips that speak Lord speak truth make the heart that hears be fertile to receive truth and may it grow into great trees of eternal life to be shining lights and R Epistles of all men that they might know that Jesus Christ has raised from the dead and lives Among Us that's what was in God's Grove when Abraham planted a Grove it was a place where in this planting others would come and the ground received a cutting it received a seed and it began to grow as he cultivated this place was where in the aell he invoked Elam and people came and were fed and met needs met and they would want to give thanks to Abraham he'd say this is the word of God this is the Everlasting God to him be the glory and he says let our hearts be fertile to receive the truth that we may grow to Great trees of eternal life shining lights read Epistles of all men through us as trees they might know Jesus Christ is raised from the dead and he says make us so full of love and the fruit of the spirit until our men and women boys and girls can see the results of the Life of Christ still living in us after 2,000 years from the great event Grant it father to honor thee we ask in Jesus Christ's name could we make that our prayer today make us so full of love and the fruit of the spirit until other men and women boys and girls can see the results of the Life of Christ still living in US you can still see the results of Abraham's Grove in Israel today tamis trees declaring this is where people dwelt the tree that Abraham planted still propagating today all that it made be so that we as tree great trees of eternal life could declare that he's alive 2,000 years after he went into the ground and came up again a brid tree living again that's my desire make a heart soul full of love and the fruit of the spirit until others see the results of the Life of Christ Living in US isn't that what you want not just a confession I'm a Believer not just a confession I'm a Christian but the reality of it the name has been co-opted to where any anyone can call themselves a Christian anybody who wants to there's no law against it but we ought to be ones that have the Seal of it and the fruits of it he's alive but that be your desire make our hearts fertile to receive the truth to be trees great trees of eternal life this is what I want us to ponder in our family tree let's stand today
