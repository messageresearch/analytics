[0:00] ruth chapter 1 just like to read verse
[0:02] 22
[0:03] and then just jump right into it and i'm
[0:05] excited about the things that we have to
[0:07] share this evening
[0:08] and trust they'll continue to be a
[0:10] blessing to you in this subject
[0:12] verse ruth chapter 1 verse 22 said naomi
[0:15] returned
[0:16] and ruth the moabitess her
[0:17] daughter-in-law with her so naomi's
[0:19] returning
[0:20] ruth is being brought in through this
[0:22] which returned out of the country of
[0:24] moab
[0:25] it's interesting that they use the
[0:26] phrase return so there's some image
[0:29] of a returning here as it relates to the
[0:32] type of roof
[0:33] and they came to bethlehem in the
[0:35] beginning
[0:36] of barley harvest and that's just the
[0:38] phrase there that i think that stands
[0:39] out to me so much
[0:41] they came to bethlehem in the beginning
[0:43] of the barley harvest
[0:45] and we'll just stop there i'm anxious to
[0:46] read into chapter two but we'll just
[0:48] stop there
[0:49] you can be seated
[0:55] i always feel pulled a little bit to
[0:56] start backgrounding more on just how we
[0:59] arrived at the service that we're in
[1:00] right now
[1:02] but we've had um i think maybe a dozen
[1:04] or so services on this particular
[1:06] subject of being
[1:07] the hunger and thirsting for
[1:08] righteousness and really the inspiration
[1:11] behind it is brother
[1:12] branham saying the living bread of life
[1:14] bringing forth the bride
[1:15] and that's the message of the hour you
[1:17] have the messenger a prophet
[1:18] bringing a word revealing a word
[1:20] bringing a restoration of certain things
[1:22] opening up certain things that is the
[1:24] living bread of life which we know is
[1:25] jesus
[1:26] christ the revelation of jesus christ
[1:28] and this revelation of christ
[1:30] actually brings forth the bride and god
[1:32] just directed us into the book of ruth
[1:35] uh very supernaturally from my vantage
[1:37] point
[1:38] and i believe in a way that has edified
[1:40] us as a church uh from your vantage
[1:42] point
[1:42] to this book of ruth and we've been
[1:44] going through uh this verse
[1:46] verse by verse and i really hope that
[1:49] once we get into chapter two we might
[1:50] just go a little bit quickly
[1:52] um through them because they're just
[1:53] real simple things i'd like to bring out
[1:55] in chapter two
[1:57] and chapter three um that just kind of
[2:00] kind of we've been building to this
[2:01] point and i think we might be able to
[2:02] hit him
[2:03] uh very quickly but we'll just trust the
[2:05] lord how he'd like to proceed
[2:07] but in tonight on bringing forth the
[2:09] bride we looked at how that bringing
[2:10] forth means to produce
[2:12] even in one sense to give birth to or to
[2:14] give rise and it has it speaks of an
[2:17] introduction or something coming forth
[2:18] and
[2:19] being manifested and so the living bread
[2:21] of life
[2:22] brings forth the bride the living bread
[2:24] of life
[2:25] introduces the bride and we even find in
[2:29] the message of the hour that
[2:30] brother branham teaches us that though
[2:32] john introduced jesus christ
[2:34] it was jesus christ that introduced the
[2:36] faith to the jewish church to the
[2:39] to the believers and to the disciples so
[2:40] there's a christ
[2:42] is going to bring us forth and bring us
[2:43] this faith that we need in this end time
[2:46] and i'm wanting to kind of uh just focus
[2:49] on these phrases
[2:50] here in verse 22 naomi returned and ruth
[2:53] the moabitess
[2:54] we recognized her as being the gentile
[2:56] type her daughter-in-law with her which
[2:58] returned out of the country of moab so
[3:00] naomi is returning ruth is also uses
[3:03] this phrase returning out of the country
[3:05] moab
[3:05] it says and they came to bethlehem in
[3:08] the beginning of barley harvest
[3:10] and we ended last wednesday night how
[3:12] that this is harvest time it's
[3:14] coming in harvest time we've been seeing
[3:15] this consistent parallel brother
[3:17] branham's
[3:18] teaching about how ruth represents the
[3:19] bribe and
[3:21] this barley harvest i think where we
[3:23] specifically ended is reading how that
[3:24] brother bram says this
[3:26] capstone is the vindication that the
[3:27] rapture is at hand
[3:29] christ is the mystery of god being
[3:30] revealed to the bride and these
[3:32] secrets that are being revealed to her
[3:33] and this revelation that was in the back
[3:35] part of god's
[3:36] mind being made known to the bride is
[3:38] the vindication that the
[3:39] the rapture is at hand and so when
[3:43] naomi is returning and she shows up in
[3:45] bethlehem judah
[3:46] and they're harvesting the barley and
[3:48] they're actually returning
[3:49] from these different festivals and these
[3:51] feasts that they would have been
[3:52] offering at this time
[3:53] it was the proof that the lord had
[3:55] visited his people it was proof of the
[3:57] presence of god it was proof of this
[3:58] restoration and it was proof that the
[4:00] lord had visited his people in giving
[4:02] them bread because that's how
[4:04] naomi's return is introduced that when
[4:06] she had heard that the lord had visited
[4:08] his people and giving them bread
[4:09] she said i'm going to return back to
[4:11] bethlehem judah
[4:12] and so it's this visitation of the lord
[4:15] this harvest time
[4:16] it's the living bread of life that's
[4:17] actually brought you forth
[4:19] had there not been a message we wouldn't
[4:20] be gathered in this these conference
[4:22] rooms of the hilton garden inn
[4:24] uh where we are right now as a group of
[4:25] people can we just all admit that
[4:28] that all our different backgrounds and
[4:29] who we are and and where we were born
[4:32] and the path of life that we've
[4:33] come from it's the word that's gathered
[4:35] us it's the word that's brought us
[4:36] together this is not just family
[4:38] relationships
[4:39] as to why we're here and brother branham
[4:42] makes the statement and this day this
[4:43] scripture is fulfilled he says there's
[4:45] to be a spiritual bride raise up
[4:47] it's the phrase he's using there's a
[4:49] spiritual bride that's going to raise up
[4:51] which will be the royal seed
[4:52] of the royal faith of abraham's royal
[4:54] son he says she is to come on the scene
[4:57] in the last days and the time and the
[5:00] place is the promise
[5:01] that's given to her so that's uh
[5:04] i want you to see that she's to come on
[5:06] the scene she's to rise
[5:08] to rise up she's to be made manifest in
[5:11] christ is a mystery god revealed i
[5:12] believe
[5:12] he's saying she is risen by the power of
[5:15] this revealed word
[5:16] she has risen she's beginning to raise
[5:18] and this is a a truth that we see today
[5:20] that it's
[5:21] this raising up of the bride and he says
[5:24] she's to come on the scene in the last
[5:25] days
[5:26] and he says the time and the place is a
[5:28] promise and
[5:30] in verse 22 we see the time and place
[5:32] ruth is coming to bethlehem
[5:34] at the harvest time and coming to
[5:36] bethlehem at the harvest time is the
[5:38] type of the bride's time
[5:40] and place just doesn't tell us that oh
[5:42] and naomi and ruth went back to
[5:43] bethlehem judah
[5:44] now remember this story has these
[5:46] different names these different times
[5:48] and seasons and events
[5:49] because they hold a type and a
[5:51] revelation of what god is
[5:53] what he is to you and how you can
[5:54] receive them and so there's these
[5:56] beautiful types and revelations
[5:57] contained in
[5:58] here and so as ruth and naomi are coming
[6:01] to bethlehem
[6:02] all right we just say as they're coming
[6:04] back to bethlehem judah the time was the
[6:06] barley harvest the place is bethlehem
[6:09] as they come back the scripture is
[6:10] telling she has come she's come
[6:12] they came to bethlehem the place at the
[6:14] beginning of the barley harvest the time
[6:17] and i was pondering these things today
[6:18] and maybe this is just kind of my way of
[6:21] opening up something for you to ponder
[6:23] in the lord to speak to your heart in
[6:24] other ways
[6:25] but redemption is what brought naomi
[6:27] back to bethlehem
[6:29] whether known or unknown whether naomi
[6:31] actually
[6:32] met in her mind well the lord has
[6:34] visited my people and giving them bread
[6:36] and i disobeyed by leaving so i want to
[6:38] be restored and going back and it's
[6:40] restoration that brings her back and she
[6:42] says oh well the
[6:43] lord has visited my people and given
[6:45] them bread so i know their substance and
[6:46] i know there's a law that there's
[6:48] the kinsmen would could redeem me and
[6:50] there could be a redemption
[6:52] of everything that elimelech lost and so
[6:54] there might be with her husband so there
[6:56] could have been a very conscious effort
[6:57] on her part to know the law
[7:00] and say that if i go back to this place
[7:02] there's redemption there
[7:04] because there's no promise for naomi in
[7:06] moab and so
[7:07] for her it's redemption whether known or
[7:09] unknown that brings her back it's
[7:11] restoration
[7:12] that brings her back now we can look at
[7:14] the end of the book and we've read the
[7:15] whole book
[7:16] and the whole story and we know that
[7:17] it's redemption that works through this
[7:19] story
[7:20] we know there's a reconciliation we know
[7:21] that there's a restoration
[7:23] but remember that if even if it's
[7:25] unknown or
[7:26] hidden that's the force that brings
[7:29] naomi back
[7:30] that's the force that's drawing her back
[7:32] to bethlehem judah
[7:34] and so ruth she's a widowed gentile
[7:38] and her type now for her she makes a
[7:41] choice to leave moab and i know some of
[7:43] this
[7:44] is just review for you but i wanted to
[7:45] touch on these things so they could be
[7:47] part of the picture
[7:48] that we're painting this evening she's a
[7:49] widowed uh gentile which
[7:51] makes me think about the the gentile
[7:53] bride whose first husband is dead
[7:55] thank god and so she's a widowed gentile
[7:58] and she makes a choice
[8:00] to leave moab and so we can begin to see
[8:03] just in these different elements there's
[8:04] many different ways that ruth types the
[8:06] gentile bride and types us as a
[8:07] christian
[8:08] and in making her choice to leave moab
[8:10] it's the type of hour
[8:12] leaving sodom or turn it leaving the
[8:14] world and and leaving laodicea and
[8:16] rejecting the things of the world
[8:17] rejecting sodom
[8:18] and being in the place where the son of
[8:20] man is revealed abraham and his group
[8:22] called out were identified with that and
[8:25] so then
[8:26] ruth and coming out she comes to canaan
[8:29] she comes to the promised land but
[8:30] just not at any time of the year she
[8:32] comes to the promised land
[8:33] at harvest time and think about how that
[8:37] type is for us
[8:38] we've come to the new birth not during a
[8:40] reformation
[8:41] not e not during a deterioration not
[8:43] during a time of an eating away
[8:45] not during the time of reformation not
[8:47] in the in the age of
[8:48] of the reformers uh but we have come
[8:51] to the new birth which is a prom part
[8:53] the believer's promised land the baptism
[8:55] of the holy ghost
[8:56] during the harvest time like we have we
[8:58] haven't come to the new birth in just an
[9:00] age of restoration of the gifts we
[9:02] didn't come to the
[9:03] uh the new birth in the age of uh of
[9:05] sanctification or justification we came
[9:07] to
[9:08] the new birth and we've been sealed into
[9:10] the body of christ in a time when the
[9:12] promise
[9:13] and the climax is a change of our bodies
[9:16] so
[9:16] the bible just doesn't say that ruth
[9:18] went back to israel and she found
[9:19] herself a husband
[9:20] and it redeemed the land of elimelech
[9:22] but it says she comes back to barley
[9:23] harvest
[9:24] to signify she holds a type for those of
[9:27] us today
[9:28] who've come out of the world into christ
[9:30] during this season and during this time
[9:34] now just to continue to look at the time
[9:36] and the place
[9:38] and i realize you guys are kind of
[9:39] really pulling on me in a way where i'm
[9:41] getting all
[9:41] enthusiastic and and excited and i
[9:44] really want to just point out some
[9:45] things more on a teaching point here in
[9:47] a moment
[9:48] but we'll work through it we'll do some
[9:49] treating as it is
[9:51] and uh and we'll make it but the time
[9:54] was
[9:55] uh we last last wednesday we used nissan
[9:57] which would be the modern
[9:58] modern month but the time was aviv and
[10:01] that would correspond
[10:02] to the first it's the first month of
[10:04] what was the ancient hebrew calendar
[10:06] would be the time
[10:07] the timepiece they would be going by at
[10:09] the time the calendar that they were
[10:10] going to at the time it would correspond
[10:12] to the month of nissan
[10:13] we're looking at those particular dates
[10:15] on how the feast of the passover is on
[10:16] the 14th
[10:18] the next day the feast of unleavened
[10:20] bread began
[10:21] on the 15th lasted for seven days and
[10:23] then the there was this uh
[10:25] the feast of weeks that would begin the
[10:27] feast of pentecost and those things so
[10:28] there's a lot of different things that
[10:29] were
[10:30] uh mentioned in that and the word of eve
[10:33] literally means barley ripening
[10:37] and that's how they named that's how
[10:38] they named their month they named their
[10:39] month barley ripening
[10:41] and so by extension because this is the
[10:42] time when there's a ripening by
[10:44] extension
[10:44] it means the spring season in hebrew so
[10:47] they had a month a spring
[10:48] think of what spring represents life
[10:50] coming forth and
[10:52] a cycle uh renewed and and and
[10:55] so it speaks of life coming and things
[10:57] being fertile and
[10:59] things sprouting and so aviv to the to
[11:01] the
[11:02] in the season it's literally the spring
[11:04] season or the barley ripening that's the
[11:06] time now because
[11:07] we might seem to kind of leave this
[11:08] subject but as we did last time we're
[11:10] just showing
[11:11] all these different things that are
[11:14] symbolized in this phrase that they came
[11:16] to bethlehem
[11:17] in the barley season and all the things
[11:19] that this is meant to signify to us
[11:22] like this is the time that ruth comes
[11:24] this is the time that we've come
[11:26] and so we begin to realize the
[11:27] importance in recognizing our day and
[11:29] its message and all the things related
[11:30] to it
[11:31] now there's a number of things that we
[11:32] could express here but i wanted to use
[11:34] just two scriptures to
[11:36] identify just how important of eve was
[11:38] to
[11:39] israel and in exodus chapter 13
[11:42] when god is telling them to uh that
[11:45] they're going to have the feast of what
[11:46] the passover lamb and we have the feast
[11:48] of the passover that's instituted
[11:50] and he's given them their instructions
[11:51] they're going to apply the token they're
[11:53] going to get all the leaven out
[11:54] that whole time and season when god
[11:56] gives it to him he says this is going to
[11:57] be the beginning of days for you
[11:59] this is going to be the beginning of
[12:00] months and it's in that time in exodus
[12:02] chapter 3
[12:03] that he completely does away with her
[12:05] old time piece their old calendar says
[12:06] we're starting all over
[12:08] and it becomes a whole new time a whole
[12:10] new season
[12:11] he says now beginning now is your first
[12:13] month
[12:14] and so this is when their calendar
[12:16] begins is at this time this eve so it's
[12:17] a
[12:18] new beginning it's a fresh start things
[12:20] are starting all over for them
[12:21] and moses said unto the people in verses
[12:23] three and four remember
[12:25] this day in which which ye came out from
[12:28] egypt
[12:28] out of the house of bondage for by the
[12:30] strength of the hand
[12:32] by strength of hand the lord brought you
[12:34] out from
[12:35] this place so it's a leaving of egypt
[12:37] from one place from moab for ruth into
[12:39] bethlehem judah for israel out of egypt
[12:42] on their way to the promised land and he
[12:44] says there shall be no
[12:45] leavened bread be eaten and so this goes
[12:47] into the feast
[12:49] of unleavened bread that they celebrated
[12:51] in festivals he says this day
[12:53] came you out in the month of eve so
[12:56] notice the timing now he says this is
[12:58] remember this day
[12:59] this time that you came out god even
[13:01] himself is saying it's this month this
[13:03] is when you came out
[13:04] and it was the time of just look at it
[13:06] it's the time of the exodus
[13:09] and and it's awesome to think that naomi
[13:11] is leaving moab
[13:12] and coming back and traversing across
[13:15] the very same
[13:16] place that her forefathers would have
[13:18] crossed when they came into
[13:19] israel and how that they would have come
[13:21] out of egypt and now she's coming out of
[13:23] moab
[13:24] and it coincides with the very time that
[13:26] god had originally called them out of
[13:27] egypt
[13:28] according to what a promise of i'm going
[13:30] to give you back the land of your
[13:31] father's restoration
[13:33] in a bringing back and restoring these
[13:35] things so it was the time of the exodus
[13:37] which because the time of
[13:38] the passover and all these things and so
[13:41] it's a time of redemption it's a time of
[13:42] restoration
[13:43] it's the time of the first fruits it's a
[13:46] time
[13:47] it's a time of resurrection these are
[13:48] all the things that we're wanting you to
[13:49] ponder and to think about
[13:51] in these images of this type of this
[13:53] season
[13:54] that they're returning to bethlehem
[13:55] judah in deuteronomy chapter 16
[13:58] verses 1 and 2 it says observe the month
[14:00] of abiv
[14:01] so this month was a special month to
[14:03] them this time which habib meanings
[14:05] barley ripening barley harvest
[14:07] spring season this is the time that that
[14:10] the season the time and the place that
[14:12] we're focusing on
[14:13] and it says observe the month of abe and
[14:16] keep the passover until the lord thy god
[14:19] for in the month of eve the lord thy god
[14:21] brought thee forth out of egypt by night
[14:23] thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
[14:25] passover unto the lord thy god
[14:27] of the flocks and the herd in the place
[14:29] which the lord shall choose
[14:31] to place his name there now originally
[14:35] when i was going to get into some
[14:37] specifics out of god's provided place of
[14:39] worship
[14:40] and this chosen place and the scripture
[14:43] just fits so
[14:44] perfectly with it because that place
[14:45] exists today there's a place there's a
[14:47] place that this word brings us to
[14:49] there's a place where this restoration
[14:51] is transpiring there's a place that we
[14:52] have to be led so you can see
[14:54] that now it brings the time which is the
[14:57] barley season
[14:58] it brings the time which is the exodus
[15:00] and the and these different elements and
[15:01] it brings the place together now
[15:03] he's actually prophetically speaking
[15:05] there's going to be a place where i put
[15:06] my name and he
[15:07] chooses that place in jerusalem and
[15:08] chooses that place in the temple and
[15:10] he's bringing the time and the place
[15:12] together and just i i didn't include it
[15:14] in this slide but i wanted to mention it
[15:16] this way
[15:17] i mentioned another place just so you
[15:18] can see how perfectly the symmetry is
[15:21] and how beautiful these parallels are
[15:23] so you see that this month this barley
[15:25] ripening month is the time of the exodus
[15:27] it's when all these important feasts
[15:29] that are going to form these
[15:29] cornerstones of the springtime feasts
[15:31] for israel
[15:32] transpire and it's this time now
[15:34] remember that naomi and ruth are
[15:36] returning to bethlehem judah
[15:38] and then even though israel in this
[15:40] great exodus when they leave they get
[15:41] kind of
[15:42] circling this mountain they spend all
[15:44] these decades roaming into the
[15:45] wilderness but when they finally come to
[15:47] cross over
[15:48] in joshua chapter 3 verse 13 it says and
[15:51] it shall come to pass as soon as the
[15:53] souls of the feet of the priest that
[15:55] bear the ark
[15:56] of the lord and the lord of all the
[15:58] earth shall rest in the waters of jordan
[16:01] that the waters of jordan shall be cut
[16:03] off from the waters that come down from
[16:04] above
[16:05] and they shall stand up on upon a heap
[16:07] so he's describing prophetically now
[16:09] because they're getting ready to cross
[16:10] over
[16:11] to finally do what moses said they were
[16:14] going to do fulfill the messenger's
[16:15] promise
[16:16] they're going to cross over into jordan
[16:18] and he's describing how the priests
[16:20] who are bearing the ark of the lord that
[16:22] when they come to the waters as soon as
[16:24] their feet touch it
[16:26] the waters are going to roll back and it
[16:27] says and it came to pass when the people
[16:29] removed from their tents
[16:31] to pass over over jordan and the priests
[16:34] bearing the ark of the covenant before
[16:35] the people and i'm realizing i might
[16:37] have wrote down the wrong verse here but
[16:38] we'll find it
[16:38] here it is it's in verse 15. all the way
[16:41] the priests bearing the ark of the
[16:42] company for the people
[16:43] and as they bear the ark were come unto
[16:45] jordan and the feet of the priests that
[16:47] bear the ark were dipped in the brim of
[16:49] the water i wish i would have put it on
[16:50] this slide for dramatic effect
[16:52] for jordan overflowed all his banks
[16:55] all the time of harvest
[16:59] and it's actually speaking to the barley
[17:00] harvest again like the very time when
[17:02] the priests are now
[17:03] putting the ark over their shoulder
[17:04] fulfilling moses's message and they're
[17:06] fulfilling the promise that he gave the
[17:08] people at the time that he called them
[17:10] out of egypt but it's not just calling
[17:12] out of
[17:12] it's entering into it's those two parts
[17:14] of redemption
[17:15] so now we see that after all these years
[17:17] our prophet moses
[17:18] message is being fulfilled at the very
[17:20] time that they left
[17:22] in the exodus it was the beginning of
[17:24] the barley harvest it was aviv it was
[17:26] the springtime
[17:27] now as they're finally entering in it's
[17:30] almost as if
[17:30] it sinks back up and they're now
[17:33] entering in at the very same time
[17:35] and the bible points it out because at
[17:36] this time the banks begin to overflow
[17:38] because it was harvest time
[17:40] this early spring harvest isn't this
[17:43] wonderful to see these things and so as
[17:46] much as i would love to it kind of in my
[17:47] nature is just
[17:48] kind of you know and maybe even you feel
[17:50] this way sometimes okay you made the
[17:52] point and then i just keep drilling
[17:53] deeper and deeper and deeper it's like
[17:54] you're still making the same point
[17:56] you're still making the same point and
[17:57] now i know i'm doing that even tonight
[18:00] but i want to move from that now and
[18:01] just point out how christ
[18:03] even comes and points to the same time
[18:06] and season
[18:07] prophetically in this hour so when he
[18:09] says this is going to be the beginning
[18:11] of months for you the
[18:12] the avid the barley ripening and it kind
[18:14] of establishes this memorial in this new
[18:16] season this new time
[18:17] and it's the exodus and its redemption
[18:19] and it's bringing back to abraham the
[18:20] faith of abraham
[18:21] and all these things transpiring and
[18:23] bringing them back and then we see that
[18:25] it lines back up when they finally cross
[18:27] over jordan it's
[18:28] lining back up in the book of ruth when
[18:30] naomi and ruth come back in what an
[18:32] exodus out of moab
[18:34] coming right back in at the very same
[18:36] time so you see this symmetry
[18:37] now christ comes who was born in
[18:39] bethlehem
[18:41] who is this bread of bethlehem who is
[18:43] typed of boaz we're in the very next
[18:44] verse it says
[18:46] and it begins to talk about how they
[18:48] came into bethlehem and
[18:50] even if i knew i wouldn't be able to get
[18:52] away from it and it says as they come
[18:54] into it begins to speak how boaz
[18:56] comes from bethlehem into the field
[18:58] where where where ruth is so these
[19:00] things are
[19:01] typed in the book of ruth but now here
[19:03] christ is the fulfillment of it
[19:05] what this foreshadowed he's the
[19:07] substance of
[19:08] and he comes and he prophesies very
[19:10] specifically
[19:11] about events that are going to be
[19:12] relating to the gentiles and to
[19:14] the jewish nation that's being even
[19:17] symbolized in these actions of elimelech
[19:19] symbolized in these actions and in
[19:21] exodus
[19:21] and in the old testament and i'm just
[19:24] going to read from one place though it's
[19:25] mark
[19:25] remarked in a few other places but in
[19:28] mark chapter 13 verse 28
[19:31] jesus says now learn a parable of the
[19:32] fig tree
[19:34] when her branch is yet tender and
[19:36] putteth forth leaves you know that
[19:39] summer is nigh
[19:40] the phrase in some translation it says
[19:43] you know the harvest time
[19:44] is nigh and it's speaking of this this
[19:47] this harvest time
[19:48] but this specific reference
[19:52] is learn the parable of the fig tree
[19:55] winter branch is yet tinder
[19:58] and putteth forth leaves it's this it's
[20:00] not necessarily coming to fruit
[20:02] it's of the fig tree and you're looking
[20:04] at the fig tree
[20:06] and the fig tree is growing at a
[20:07] particular pace why other things are
[20:08] growing at a different place
[20:10] a pace but it says look at the fig tree
[20:12] and what are we taught consistently this
[20:14] represents israel
[20:16] and even the that we understand that we
[20:18] identified this fig tree
[20:20] putting forth its branch and this and
[20:21] these leaves and this bud
[20:23] is is represented in israel becoming a
[20:25] nation
[20:27] we understand that right and so this is
[20:29] prophecy when jesus says learn the
[20:31] parable of the fig tree
[20:32] and we read this in matthew and mark and
[20:33] we read this in luke we see this parable
[20:35] being referenced
[20:36] we see it being fulfilled in the time
[20:38] that we're living in
[20:39] maybe many of us weren't born there in
[20:42] the time in the 40s when this was
[20:43] transpired and coming to head
[20:45] but yet it happened it's happened now
[20:47] for us this is the season this is the
[20:49] time
[20:50] and it says jesus says when this happens
[20:52] you know you've entered this season
[20:55] and now what's remarkable when you begin
[20:57] to look at the fig tree the sprouting of
[20:58] the fig tree
[20:59] where it says it it's tender and it's
[21:02] putting forth its leaves and so this
[21:03] it's the sprouting it's not like the
[21:05] figs we're gonna take the figs and eat
[21:07] them
[21:07] but the sprouting of the fig tree
[21:09] coincides with
[21:10] the barley harvest it's at that very
[21:13] time in the spring
[21:15] when the fig tree is putting forth this
[21:17] branch that you find that the
[21:19] the uh the barley harvest begins
[21:23] and so it's saying when the barley
[21:24] harvest is night when this omer
[21:26] this first sheep is going to be offered
[21:28] the day after the passover
[21:30] and you're going to begin your feast of
[21:31] weeks when your feast of weeks begins or
[21:33] it's called the feast of pentecost
[21:34] there's going to be these weeks that
[21:35] enter into may into june
[21:38] and i'm referencing this time frame for
[21:40] israel because in a little bit i want to
[21:42] come back to when israel became
[21:44] a nation and see how these things
[21:45] transpired even in the month of may and
[21:47] these things are happening at this
[21:48] particular time
[21:50] and it's no coincidence that very
[21:51] significant things are happening in
[21:53] april and may
[21:54] when israel is becoming a nation and
[21:56] jesus says that it's going to be when
[21:57] the fig tree
[21:59] begins and is tender begins to sprout
[22:00] forth and begins to come forth and so
[22:02] for israel
[22:03] it's the branch beginning to bring forth
[22:06] its uh it's the tree beginning to bring
[22:08] forth a new branch it's beginning to bud
[22:10] but at that time it's the harvest for
[22:12] the gentile bride
[22:14] it's harvest time so for israel they're
[22:16] just reforming
[22:17] but for the bride she's entering another
[22:19] season and so jesus points to this
[22:22] a sign of the end times where certain
[22:25] things are
[22:26] happening right at the time of the
[22:28] harvest this relates to israel the fig
[22:30] tree but he's orienting us to
[22:32] this barley harvest he's orienting us to
[22:34] this harvest time which is for the bride
[22:37] and this parable as you begin to read it
[22:39] in the in the passages that it's
[22:40] mentioned it relates to even the siege
[22:42] of jerusalem
[22:43] there's this compound type that jesus is
[22:45] utilizing here
[22:46] and in the siege of jerusalem it became
[22:49] the destruction of the jewish nation
[22:52] so i want you to point to this of all
[22:53] the cycles of israel
[22:56] where god establishes the kingdom of
[22:58] israel and he gives the throne to dave
[23:00] and he says i don't ever want it to
[23:01] depart from your house
[23:02] you find it over and over and over again
[23:03] god said because my promise to david
[23:05] because my promise to david and they
[23:07] went through these cycles swinging back
[23:08] and forth
[23:09] but when you go to this time when titus
[23:12] comes and besieges the siege of titus in
[23:14] 70 a.d
[23:16] when he comes that that ends it for
[23:20] centuries
[23:22] the jewish nation is destroyed and the
[23:24] siege began on
[23:25] april 14th three days before the
[23:28] passover that year
[23:29] the siege of siege comes coinciding
[23:32] perfectly with what jesus is saying
[23:34] about about the destruction
[23:37] of jerusalem and in the siege he
[23:40] captured the city of jerusalem
[23:41] he destroyed both the city and the
[23:43] temple so what happens when he destroys
[23:45] the temple there's the worship
[23:47] there's the place that god had put his
[23:48] name this is what identified the city of
[23:51] david the city of israel the city of
[23:53] jerusalem
[23:54] and and this begins it marks the great
[23:56] tribulation of israel
[23:57] the dissolving of the jewish nation just
[24:00] as they had gone away into egypt and
[24:02] they were there and soldiering there for
[24:04] hundreds of years now after there had
[24:05] finally been what they thought was the
[24:07] restoration and they have their kingdoms
[24:08] and they have their kings
[24:09] now through this oppression and this
[24:11] constant disobedience on their part
[24:12] it dissolves a nation they're no longer
[24:15] a nation and it destroys the center of
[24:17] their worship
[24:18] their city of jerusalem it destroys
[24:20] their their temple
[24:21] and now the jews are just scattered they
[24:23] have no homeland they have no nation
[24:24] they have no government
[24:25] they have no flag they have no king
[24:28] and that's why jesus says in matthew 24
[24:30] 21 for then shall be great tribulation
[24:33] such as was not since the beginning of
[24:34] the world to this time
[24:36] no nor ever shall be and we we can view
[24:39] this through the lens of as it relates
[24:41] to israel
[24:42] this was the worst that had ever
[24:44] happened to them
[24:46] and jesus is portraying now he's
[24:48] prophesying when he says
[24:50] learn the parable of the fig tree he's
[24:52] prophesying this
[24:53] as what the actual restoration or the
[24:57] revival of the nation of israel
[25:00] so it includes this siege of titus and
[25:03] flee for the hills and don't be caught
[25:05] in the city so he's prophesying of the
[25:06] demise and the tearing down of the
[25:08] jewish nation
[25:09] the destruction of the temple but he
[25:10] doesn't leave him without hope he's
[25:12] basically saying
[25:12] this is going to be the longest period
[25:14] that you've ever experienced since you
[25:16] became a nation
[25:17] but some thousands of years later
[25:20] even the phrase i think that's used that
[25:21] brother bram says 2 500 years since that
[25:23] flag had even been flown
[25:25] over israel but now it's going to be uh
[25:27] 1700 years later 1900 years later
[25:30] that you're going to have this this
[25:31] event transpire and take place
[25:33] but jesus is saying that's when the fig
[25:35] tree's putting forth its bud
[25:37] so jesus is prophesying of the nation
[25:40] israel's revival
[25:42] is that am i making sense i realize
[25:44] sometimes i i can really fail to
[25:46] communicate something that seems
[25:47] crystal clear on the chalkboard in my
[25:49] mind but just
[25:51] i stumble and trying to express it now
[25:55] if i've been able to at least somehow
[25:57] bring that image up in your mind and you
[25:59] can see scripturally now
[26:00] with the background that you have in the
[26:02] message because this is this is not just
[26:04] kind of me over here
[26:05] you know kind of scatter shooting on a
[26:07] wednesday afternoon trying to come up
[26:08] with something to preach
[26:09] this comes from knowing what the message
[26:10] teaches studying the message
[26:12] and without having to belabor some of
[26:14] these points we know what brother
[26:15] branham said about the fig tree we know
[26:16] what he said about
[26:17] israel becoming a nation and then we've
[26:19] gone through painstakingly in a way
[26:21] over the type of naomi and the type of
[26:24] orpah
[26:25] and the type of ruth so now catch this
[26:27] parallel naomi
[26:29] brother ram types to israel we see naomi
[26:31] representing israel
[26:32] ruth is a type of the bride orpah is a
[26:34] type of the laodicean church
[26:36] and so she has this representation in
[26:38] the formal church the lukewarm church
[26:39] and we saw that how she begins she
[26:41] starts out just like
[26:42] lots uh lot does and lot's wife did and
[26:45] we see that even moab
[26:46] uh comes forth from lot's daughters and
[26:48] we see all this symmetry
[26:50] so now when laodicea begins and and i
[26:53] get just trying to give some quick
[26:54] history here and i'm
[26:55] wanting to do it maybe more just in an
[26:57] informational way just so you can see
[26:59] how beautifully this
[27:00] these things line up for us 1906 it
[27:03] ushers in the laodicean
[27:04] church age and what was there a there
[27:06] was a birth of the pentecostal revival
[27:09] it's pentecostal movement they're in
[27:10] california and god comes and he stirs
[27:12] this
[27:13] azusa street revival up and we know it
[27:15] was genuine
[27:17] we know it was real it was the last
[27:18] order of the reformation it was the
[27:20] restoration of the gifts
[27:21] back to the church the church is
[27:23] experiencing its revival
[27:25] and and without maybe belaboring that
[27:27] that identifies the move
[27:29] of the in the pentecostal age which is
[27:31] the laodicean church age
[27:32] which brother branham types to orpah now
[27:35] why did he type it to orpah
[27:37] because she went so far but then turns
[27:40] back
[27:41] they thought this is the long-awaited
[27:43] restoration but no that wasn't it there
[27:45] was still yet another promise to the
[27:47] church
[27:49] and so before even world war one was
[27:51] over and and for
[27:52] those of you who like to stay on top of
[27:54] your history it was called the great war
[27:56] before it was world war one because they
[27:59] hadn't quite anticipated that it would
[28:00] be one of at least two
[28:03] and so if anyone time travels and comes
[28:05] back and says um
[28:07] uh which you know where that they say we
[28:09] just escaped world war three then you
[28:11] know there's going to be at least maybe
[28:12] another
[28:12] a third one but before world war two one
[28:15] was even
[28:16] over pentecost was our uh um organizing
[28:20] right so think of this this revival
[28:22] breaks out for
[28:23] these few years and it and it kind of
[28:25] has this momentum and goes forward for
[28:26] several years but even i try trying to
[28:29] find some
[28:29] specific statements today and i just
[28:31] don't have the time where brembo talks
[28:32] about 15 years and not even 20 years and
[28:34] 10 years and these organizing these
[28:36] revivals that didn't even very
[28:37] last very long in the assemblies of god
[28:39] organizes and denominates
[28:41] then the pentecostal church of god
[28:43] organizes and denominates and you find
[28:44] this because it happened in 1914
[28:46] 1916 1919 these major denominational
[28:50] organizations begin to form
[28:52] that were birthed in this real genuine
[28:54] pentecostal move but now it's a move of
[28:56] god that's transpiring
[28:58] a genuine unorganized move of god the
[29:01] messengers the holy ghost
[29:02] but then the devil starts to work within
[29:04] them and what do they do like every
[29:05] other church age they organize they
[29:07] denominate
[29:08] and this is happening this is what the
[29:09] sp where the spirit of orpah gets a hold
[29:11] of it and they put a period on they
[29:13] organize they build their walls and they
[29:14] put they'll build their fences
[29:16] and all these things are kind of put
[29:17] together and i just really had this
[29:19] real fresh inspiration fellowshipping
[29:21] with brother daniel evans
[29:22] this past week and how that he said that
[29:25] they built
[29:26] fences to keep the ducks from
[29:27] fellowshipping but all you got to do is
[29:29] let the water rise
[29:31] and i said just lift up the word just
[29:33] keep lifting up the word whatever fences
[29:34] man has built
[29:35] we can just let the water rise and the
[29:37] ducks will be able to fellowship
[29:39] and and so these things begin to
[29:41] organize in
[29:42] in 14 1914 1916 1919
[29:45] and this kind of caught me when nine by
[29:47] 1945 is when the upc
[29:49] organizes and they they experience this
[29:53] split there's a
[29:54] split between the oneness and the
[29:55] trinitarians and the pentecostal
[29:57] 1945 upc organizes and what it does it
[29:59] really marks the death of the laodicean
[30:01] church
[30:02] this great pentecostal move dies when it
[30:05] organizes
[30:06] and what does that what does that
[30:07] represent orpah now i'm going to read a
[30:09] couple statements
[30:10] that uh are you familiar how brother bam
[30:13] talks about how it organized and it died
[30:15] like the life life is going to move on
[30:16] he even talks about how
[30:18] he mentions it many many many times but
[30:20] now just to pull back from something
[30:22] we'd read
[30:22] a passage in the church age book that
[30:24] we'd read before
[30:26] he says that poor smyrnian age was dying
[30:28] when it died it never come back
[30:30] no age ever comes back no revival ever
[30:33] comes back
[30:34] it can't have the life of god in it by
[30:37] natural generation
[30:38] it takes a regeneration from above
[30:41] this last age started with the fires of
[30:43] a pentecostal revival and they organized
[30:45] right back what does that mean
[30:47] it died and they can't regenerate
[30:50] themselves
[30:51] that's it's only going to be natural
[30:53] generation from then on that's why he
[30:54] teaches us
[30:55] that they cannot give birth because
[30:57] they're sterile
[30:59] and i know i'm drawing a lot of real
[31:01] heavy teachings from the message but
[31:03] this is just this is the prognosis
[31:06] uh that that the prophet is giving of
[31:09] the age and of organizations now
[31:11] don't think that you can organize around
[31:12] that prophet not be subject to the same
[31:14] curse
[31:16] because it has to be organized has to be
[31:18] done from above a regeneration from
[31:19] above and god dealing with individuals
[31:21] and not
[31:22] names of churches and different
[31:23] doctrines so he says instead of taking
[31:25] the word they took their own ideas and
[31:26] did just what every age has done
[31:28] substituted the manual for the word
[31:31] and so now you can see how he's bringing
[31:33] that parallel now they organized
[31:35] pentecost organized that means the
[31:36] revival fires have died
[31:37] they can't bring themselves to life
[31:39] again it's going to take god to do it
[31:41] and and just a few places spots later it
[31:44] might even be kind of on the same page
[31:45] in the church age but god poured out his
[31:46] spirit upon baptist methodist
[31:48] nazarenes adventists presbyterians
[31:50] brethren church of god several so named
[31:52] etc
[31:53] all these brethren were brought up on
[31:55] different doctrines bylaws church
[31:56] mammals etc
[31:58] god swept it all to one side he
[31:59] destroyed their dispensational theories
[32:01] and restored the gifts of the spirit
[32:03] proving he's the same yesterday today
[32:05] and forever wow
[32:07] look what god did for all these
[32:08] organizations
[32:10] what does he what is he establishing
[32:11] it's not your denominational brand it's
[32:13] not
[32:14] your theology it's not your church god's
[32:16] destroying all of it this should have
[32:17] been like the
[32:18] climax of the of god's gentile bribe
[32:21] he says god swept it all to one side and
[32:23] he says
[32:24] he says but did those pentecostals learn
[32:26] their lesson about organization
[32:28] no sir they're organized right back and
[32:30] have written their own textbooks bylaws
[32:32] and church manual fellowship book etc
[32:34] he's using that quite a lot in formal
[32:35] writing
[32:36] with one idea in mind which is to prove
[32:38] that they now have all the truth know
[32:40] all the answers and are therefore
[32:42] the elite of god who know the way and
[32:44] can show it unto others as god's
[32:45] appointed guides
[32:49] and i i mean i wouldn't be surprised if
[32:51] we're not careful that's not exactly
[32:52] what some people's mission statement is
[32:54] on their website
[32:56] but they haven't got it they have
[32:58] hybridized
[33:00] themselves like the very groups they
[33:02] came out of
[33:03] which is what death as soon as you do
[33:05] that it's death
[33:06] if they want to be in the bride they're
[33:08] going to have to come out exactly as
[33:10] their forefathers
[33:12] so all of a sudden again after this
[33:14] genuine move
[33:15] they're right back almost as it was in a
[33:18] moabite condition
[33:20] they're dead they've gone right back in
[33:22] it no wonder elijah
[33:24] had to come first and restore all things
[33:27] not just because there was going to be a
[33:28] fallen away in the time of paul
[33:30] but that even in the end after a great
[33:32] genuine move of pentecost the devil's
[33:34] going to say whoa this is this looks
[33:36] like it did on the day of pentecost
[33:38] everything's been brought back to even
[33:39] the restoration of the gifts
[33:41] and then he is able to get back into it
[33:43] and tear it down he thinks god's last
[33:45] final great move
[33:46] this great climax i've destroyed it i've
[33:48] succeeded
[33:49] but god had been hiding all along that
[33:50] there still is yet another last step
[33:54] and what i'd like to identify this
[33:56] falling away and going right back to
[33:57] what they came out of and if they're
[33:58] going to be in the bride
[34:00] there has to be another exodus they're
[34:02] going to be there has to be another
[34:03] return
[34:05] notice that and so what is it an orpah
[34:08] anointing
[34:09] that brings the death the fallen away
[34:13] and what is brother branham showing it
[34:15] repeating
[34:18] so when it says ruth returned
[34:21] out of moab it even gives this image of
[34:25] someone who had once been there left and
[34:27] has to come back again
[34:29] why did it say ruth was returning
[34:33] and so now and i feel like i'm doing
[34:36] great on time so i
[34:37] i don't feel rushed are you with me
[34:40] individual i'm asking you all
[34:41] individually
[34:42] if you follow me so far i love it when
[34:44] we're just family together
[34:46] now at the very same time that pentecost
[34:48] is dying
[34:50] the very same time that it's going in an
[34:52] organization very same time orpah is
[34:54] turning back
[34:55] israel's returning right
[34:59] at the very same time that we described
[35:01] these events in smyrna and we could take
[35:03] these times from 1906 and all these
[35:05] dates and
[35:05] and 14 and 16 and 19 of 1900s
[35:08] and 1945 they organized and this is them
[35:11] organizing this is them dying them
[35:12] leaving the revival
[35:14] and they're gonna have think about that
[35:15] they've gone back into organizations and
[35:17] in order to be in the bride they're
[35:19] going to have to return
[35:20] to the faith of their forefathers they
[35:21] have to return to faith
[35:23] what are they going to need they're
[35:24] going to need a message of returning
[35:25] they're returning the hearts
[35:26] message of restoration they're going to
[35:28] need this ministry and what what's
[35:30] coming on the scene at that time
[35:33] and so i know this might may seem to be
[35:36] super academic but it just
[35:37] startled me when i began to see these
[35:39] things because because i'll say this
[35:42] and though i if i recall it is maybe a
[35:44] subject of some criticism
[35:46] where brother branham is using dates in
[35:48] 40 may may 46 may 47
[35:50] and and i think there's a lot at least
[35:53] there has been for several years and
[35:54] many many years none of these things are
[35:56] new
[35:56] i mean except some of the vicious lies
[35:58] that people try to tell now since they
[35:59] realize
[36:00] all these things have never worked
[36:01] before uh
[36:04] that there's this maybe these
[36:05] discrepancies and the dates that he's
[36:06] trying to use
[36:07] but he's like he's making this
[36:09] connection between what god's doing to
[36:10] israel
[36:11] and what god's doing to the gentile
[36:13] bride and it's personal to him because
[36:15] god's commissioning him and calling him
[36:18] and as he's referring to these dates and
[36:19] maybe they don't seem to line up to us
[36:22] or to others he's saying at the very
[36:24] same time if we could just look at it in
[36:25] general what he's trying to point to
[36:26] at the very same time that god is
[36:28] commissioning me to go out into the
[36:29] gentile church
[36:30] and to do these miracles and have this
[36:32] ministry it's at that very time that
[36:33] israel is returning to its homeland
[36:35] and becoming a nation again and that's
[36:37] kind of the parallel that
[36:38] that he's identifying when he makes
[36:40] those statements so remember at the very
[36:42] time after this
[36:43] genuine move of god and the laodicean
[36:44] church age takes place and they begin to
[36:46] organize in 1914 1960 1919 these are
[36:49] just dates that i could find
[36:50] when these significant denominations
[36:52] organized in the pentecostal move
[36:54] it's in 1917 that you have what's called
[36:56] the balfour declaration
[36:58] and in it it's it's this public
[37:00] pronouncement by the united kingdom
[37:03] that favors the establishment of the
[37:05] jewish home in palestine
[37:07] this was remarkable now to come out and
[37:10] say that we believe
[37:11] this pronouncement by this major country
[37:13] and it's called the balfour declaration
[37:15] where we believe that the jews should
[37:17] have a home in their their land
[37:19] that's in 1917 right about the time that
[37:22] the laodicean age is organizing and
[37:24] denominating
[37:25] there's this move now this zionist
[37:27] movement begins to get some traction
[37:29] to get israel back in its homeland and
[37:31] after world war one the united kingdom
[37:33] is kind of given this it's called the
[37:34] palestinian mandate
[37:36] and they're given this oversight over
[37:38] how what should be done to is
[37:40] to palestine in the role of the jews in
[37:42] israel
[37:43] in that land and by 1937
[37:47] the a jewish state to have a jewish
[37:50] state with borders and government and a
[37:52] place
[37:53] for these jews to be a nation is
[37:54] explicitly suggested
[37:56] like we believe that there should be a
[37:58] jewish state that there should be a
[37:59] homeland
[38:00] restored to israel and then after world
[38:02] war ii the united kingdom kind of turns
[38:04] over this mandate
[38:05] of what to do with israel what to do in
[38:07] palestine to the the united nations
[38:09] which had just been established
[38:11] and then when the united nations
[38:16] makes this proclamation and this
[38:18] decision they make this decision in 1946
[38:21] this was a significant decision it's
[38:23] made in 1946 they they make this
[38:26] decision for the immediate admission of
[38:28] a hundred thousand jewish
[38:30] refugees from europe from the holocaust
[38:31] and things into palestine
[38:34] in 1946 they said these jews
[38:38] who've been scattered and persecuted in
[38:40] their possessions torn away from him
[38:41] and this been ravaged by hitler
[38:44] mussolini and eichmann in this
[38:46] great holocaust and this genocide we
[38:48] believe that they ought to be given a
[38:49] place
[38:50] in their original home a hundred
[38:52] thousand of them in 1946 and guess what
[38:54] month it was
[38:55] it was april when it's explicitly
[38:59] declared and they say
[39:00] immediately these jews should be
[39:02] relocated back in this promised land
[39:04] and it was in may 1946 now think of this
[39:07] may 1946
[39:08] that the american president president
[39:10] truman announced his approval of that
[39:12] recommendation
[39:14] when is it happening aviv when is it
[39:17] happening during that time of the feast
[39:18] of the weeks it's happened in the time
[39:19] of the restoration the reconciliat
[39:21] the the very time that god prophesied
[39:24] this is going to be an exodus for you
[39:27] and you're going to return to the
[39:28] promised land these things are happening
[39:30] in a political realm
[39:31] but look at the symmetry in 1947 the u.n
[39:36] formed the united nations special
[39:38] committee on palestine you want to guess
[39:39] what month that was
[39:40] it was in the month of may and it was
[39:44] the efforts of that committee this u.n
[39:46] special committee on palestine that
[39:48] resulted in the adoption of what they
[39:50] call
[39:50] resolution 181 and it was on november 29
[39:54] 1947 it was the partition resolution
[39:57] that said we believe that you ought to
[39:58] carve out specific borders and have a
[40:00] specific place that the jews can call
[40:02] their own
[40:04] and actually partition out a jewish
[40:06] state for the jewish nation
[40:08] now why okay thanks for the history
[40:10] lesson brother ann we thought we had
[40:11] graduated or
[40:12] picked a profession that all i needed
[40:14] was certifications and i wouldn't have
[40:16] to sit through a world history class
[40:17] well
[40:17] surprise but it's not just world history
[40:22] think of now what's transpiring when
[40:23] jesus said when the fig tree begins to
[40:25] put forth its branch
[40:27] in its tender time it's going to be
[40:28] during this time it's going to be in
[40:29] this season in this time
[40:31] where we can look in a bigger picture
[40:33] and say that these things transpire over
[40:35] these few years
[40:36] or over these several years is taking
[40:38] place at the very time that orpas
[40:40] turning around and going back
[40:42] but it but what's happening is israel's
[40:44] being brought back to their promised
[40:46] land
[40:46] that means there's got to be a ruth
[40:48] coming on the scene there has to be a
[40:50] time and a place for a gentile
[40:52] bride if orpah is doing her thing and
[40:54] israel's coming to her place
[40:55] and they're establishing in 1947 this
[40:58] partition resolution
[41:00] that this fig tree which was destroyed
[41:03] three days before the siege began three
[41:05] days before their passover
[41:07] lost all their inheritance and the
[41:09] jewish nation is destroyed
[41:10] and they're scattered throughout the
[41:12] world that god's going to now bring them
[41:13] back home
[41:15] and it's happened at this very time
[41:18] that's in 46 47 april may of 46
[41:22] may of 47 then in may may 14 1948
[41:27] the declaration of the establishment of
[41:28] the state of israel
[41:31] the fig tree puts forth
[41:35] it's big israel becomes a nation and how
[41:38] does brother branham identify that
[41:39] that that's a signal that's assigned to
[41:41] us that there are certain prophecies
[41:43] that re
[41:44] that are to the bride there's certain
[41:45] things that relate to the gentile church
[41:46] that means god has got to be finishing
[41:48] his work
[41:50] of redemption of the gentile bride that
[41:52] god has got this has got to be coming to
[41:53] a climax
[41:54] because now he's going to get ready to
[41:55] turn to this fig tree because eventually
[41:57] the figs are going to come forth
[41:59] and they're going to have to have their
[42:00] reconciliation they're going to have to
[42:01] have their restoration
[42:02] things are going to have to be turned
[42:03] over back to the to israel
[42:06] and how is that typed at the end of the
[42:07] book of ruth
[42:10] when ruth takes the child that was
[42:11] brought forth by boaz and hands it over
[42:13] to naomi
[42:16] and it's the christ that the the bride
[42:19] brings forth that's going to introduce
[42:21] himself
[42:21] back to israel as naomi takes this child
[42:24] again to
[42:25] to to nourish it and this is what we see
[42:27] in the book of ruth well this is
[42:28] literally literally fulfilling the types
[42:31] and shadows of ruth when we begin to
[42:32] look at these events
[42:33] in the pentecostal church age these
[42:35] things happening to the nation of israel
[42:39] i i accept that i might get more excited
[42:41] about this than others
[42:43] and i don't expect you to share the same
[42:44] enthusiasm i don't even necessarily
[42:46] expect you to
[42:46] see it the way i do but i'm going to
[42:48] read you what brother branham said and i
[42:49] hope you see it the way he says it
[42:52] because in the book i say the book of
[42:54] job no this is the sermon of job
[42:57] and uh i remember one time a brother was
[42:59] very very adamant that brother bradham
[43:01] said that
[43:02] when your job is on the ash heap right
[43:04] no aren't you sure they mean
[43:05] job no he said it was the job was on the
[43:09] ashee
[43:10] and so he whipped out the quote and was
[43:12] going to just prove it right he says
[43:13] right here
[43:14] j-o-b never mind you know he kind of
[43:17] realized at that moment
[43:18] that it was the sermon called job not
[43:20] the sermon of job
[43:24] and maybe when you understand that you
[43:25] know the book of job has new meaning and
[43:27] you don't dislike it as much
[43:29] as you did before he says and notice
[43:32] what brother baby says in the beginning
[43:33] when pentecost fell it fell on the jews
[43:36] and the jewish church died out and the
[43:38] gentile church come in
[43:40] this is this is exactly the events that
[43:43] allowed
[43:44] roof because elimelech
[43:47] represents israel and we could used all
[43:49] these scriptures in romans where
[43:50] paul is teaching hey this happened to
[43:52] the house of israel that the gentiles
[43:54] might be brought in
[43:55] and i've just avoided using those
[43:56] scriptures because i feel like they're
[43:57] just very evident to us but this is
[43:59] what's typed out in ruth chapter one
[44:01] broadband is looking at these things
[44:02] here and he says that the gentile church
[44:04] come in and then all the signs and
[44:05] wonders cease now notice
[44:07] that was the former reign then the
[44:08] church notice what he says
[44:10] the jewish church is returning just in
[44:13] the latter ring
[44:14] when the holy spirit is just being
[44:16] poured out again this is in 1955
[44:18] so he's looking at historical events
[44:20] that are transpiring within the church
[44:23] and politically with israel and he says
[44:25] and the jews now returning by
[44:27] thousands back to palestine he says oh i
[44:31] wish we that's a sermon in itself
[44:33] time won't permit much longer i've got a
[44:35] hurry notice a sermon in itself so he
[44:37] realizes
[44:38] there's a lot here of the return of the
[44:41] jews now
[44:42] bringing with them the gentile
[44:45] so there's something as he's looking at
[44:47] this there's something about this return
[44:49] of israel to their homeland
[44:51] that's going to bring in these great
[44:53] promises to the gentile
[44:54] and when they got there it was barley
[44:56] season oh he's talking about ruth
[44:59] he's talking about ruth chapter one the
[45:01] great thrashing was on and they had a
[45:03] near
[45:04] kinsman named boaz and ruth went out to
[45:05] glean in the field and was directed to
[45:07] boaz's field which was a kinsmen
[45:09] when she went out to glean a type of the
[45:11] gentile church
[45:12] taking up the bible the old testament to
[45:14] learn of god being heathen now
[45:16] comes to learn of god now if you notice
[45:19] this
[45:20] it's very very uh thought provoking to
[45:24] me
[45:24] how that is clearly looking at end time
[45:26] events
[45:28] in israel returning to the promised land
[45:30] and how this
[45:31] has some impact upon the bride but now
[45:35] he's showing that in type
[45:36] it happened already and that there's a
[45:40] type of the gentile bride being brought
[45:41] into the promise
[45:42] at the beginning of the christian church
[45:45] which think of if we if we focused even
[45:47] on that aspect
[45:48] it made sense for naomi to return
[45:52] but the mystery of god is hid in ruth
[45:56] that it wasn't always just a promise to
[45:58] israel after the flesh
[46:00] but it was a spiritual promise and there
[46:01] was a royal seed of abraham
[46:03] and the mystery of god was that his
[46:05] bride would actually be a gentile bride
[46:07] and would not be the literal seed of
[46:09] abraham
[46:10] so when ruth is coming back she holds
[46:13] the mystery in her heart
[46:14] of a gentile bride oh naomi it's so good
[46:16] to see you well don't call me
[46:17] homie call me bitterness and here's the
[46:19] mystery standing right next to her
[46:21] the mystery that no god's not going to
[46:23] take to himself israel to be his wife
[46:25] she'll be his servants but he's going to
[46:28] take a gentile woman
[46:30] a gentile church made up through seven
[46:32] church ages and
[46:33] she will be his wife she will be the one
[46:36] that comes on the scene in the last days
[46:40] and so because it's represented in the
[46:43] church
[46:44] ruth also foreshadows being brought in
[46:47] by a naomi being given the old testament
[46:50] and learning of the one true god but it
[46:53] says that naomi
[46:54] is returning but ruth is also returning
[46:59] so there's also another type for the at
[47:00] the end of time
[47:02] for the bride's climax the bride's
[47:04] redemption
[47:05] when she's brought back when she's
[47:07] restored
[47:08] so notice how brother branham when he's
[47:10] referring to the book of ruth he's
[47:12] identifying the jewish church returning
[47:14] to their nation then a message god has a
[47:17] provided way
[47:18] and notice just as naomi who had lost
[47:20] everything she had
[47:22] and was returning back just in barley
[47:24] season
[47:25] and now he looks at today and palestine
[47:27] today is becoming the blossom like a
[47:29] rose
[47:29] some of the greatest things are found
[47:31] riches of the lands and the world
[47:32] chemicals found in the dead sea
[47:34] that's priceless to mention there's
[47:37] there's so much you can amplify in that
[47:38] way
[47:39] of the advancements technology and
[47:42] science and
[47:43] the tremendous things that have been
[47:44] done in palestine since the time of this
[47:46] restoration
[47:47] palestine the greatest citrus country
[47:49] lemons that that weigh five pounds of
[47:51] peace nearly raised there
[47:52] think of it all fulfilling god's divine
[47:56] word
[47:56] going home the jews returning in barley
[47:59] season
[48:00] so here's our prophet standing here we
[48:02] read from 1955 in 1954 now
[48:05] where he's saying do you see the jews
[48:06] now returning
[48:08] to their homeland the fig tree now
[48:10] putting forth this bud
[48:11] and these events that took place in 46
[48:13] and 47 and 48 with this declaration of
[48:15] the state of israel
[48:16] and israel gives this declaration of
[48:18] independence identifies itself as a
[48:20] jewish nation
[48:21] raises up the star of david and is
[48:23] signifying
[48:25] the the the end of this great
[48:26] tribulation to israel that jesus
[48:28] prophesied in the book of matthew
[48:30] in the book of mark and now brother
[48:31] branham stands there as the prophet says
[48:33] now if
[48:34] the jews are coming back to their
[48:35] homeland it must be
[48:37] harvest time but not for the fig tree
[48:40] but for the bride this weak plant
[48:42] this wife of jesus christ is coming on
[48:45] the scene
[48:47] so if the jews are returning in barley
[48:48] season there has to be a restoration
[48:50] a redemption of the gentile bride
[48:54] so in the sermon redeeming redeemer
[48:56] redemption
[48:57] we're going to close on this we'll give
[48:59] our musicians our brothers
[49:01] just at times they'd feel led as i read
[49:03] this statement
[49:04] to come to the instruments notice
[49:08] and and i wanted just to read this whole
[49:10] thing even though we really just come to
[49:11] the very end where he makes these real
[49:13] impactful statements
[49:14] but what he says in here so beautiful
[49:16] and instructive to us notice ruth was
[49:18] willing to forsake her idols
[49:20] forsake her past life forsake her people
[49:23] forsake everything
[49:24] in return with naomi
[49:27] as israel is brought by the tender hand
[49:29] of jehovah
[49:30] through a genocide and a holocaust and
[49:33] these events transpire that will give
[49:34] her
[49:35] nationhood and bring forth this fig
[49:37] tree's tender root branch
[49:39] that at the very time where it says
[49:41] where the sap from the root comes into
[49:43] the plant and begins to express
[49:45] the life that is still in the tree it's
[49:48] at that very time that ruth
[49:50] is making these decisions no matter what
[49:54] the circumstances were she was willing
[49:56] to go on
[49:57] that's the way every man that comes to
[49:59] christ must first
[50:00] be willing regardless he goes i don't
[50:02] like to tell the people oh you're going
[50:04] to prosper and be a rich man now
[50:05] and god's going to bless you you're you
[50:08] ain't going to have no sickness
[50:10] because isn't that what sometimes people
[50:11] want to pat you on the back and say look
[50:12] if you give your heart to god you'll get
[50:14] that ladder house have you ever heard
[50:15] that
[50:15] claim atlanta house blessing right i
[50:17] mean you're going to i'm going to get a
[50:18] new car
[50:19] tesla's for everyone and that's kind of
[50:21] like the reason why we want to serve god
[50:23] he says i'm not going to make those kind
[50:25] of promises i don't promise them that
[50:27] because god doesn't promise them that
[50:29] here's this beautiful statement i say if
[50:32] you're really born again in your heart
[50:34] i don't care how rough the road gets
[50:36] you'll still hold on to god's unchanging
[50:38] hand
[50:39] in that right brother ernie eventually
[50:40] you realize something's holding you
[50:42] doesn't matter how rough it gets what
[50:44] you go through physically mentally
[50:45] emotionally
[50:47] in relationships with family you're
[50:49] holding to god's unchanging hand no
[50:51] matter what lays before me
[50:52] if jesus goes with me i'll go hallelujah
[50:56] he says
[50:57] as long as he goes that's all that's
[50:59] necessary
[51:01] and he says and she returned
[51:04] now she wasn't coming back to bethlehem
[51:06] where there wasn't a boaz
[51:09] and oh the picture now ruth the gentile
[51:12] church
[51:13] just coming in now what is this what
[51:16] does this look like
[51:19] ruth the gentile church it's the bride
[51:21] coming on the scene
[51:23] because there had been gentile church
[51:24] ages for centuries
[51:27] the church had come in through the
[51:29] ministry of paul and peter
[51:31] paul saying how he brought this church
[51:33] and peter the gospel going to the
[51:34] gentiles
[51:35] they had had their season and their time
[51:38] so what is he talking about
[51:39] your time bride time seed time
[51:42] harvest time climax restoration
[51:46] redemption not just an exodus out of
[51:51] but now an entrance into
[51:54] that you can see it was that time that
[51:56] there was an exodus but redemption has
[51:58] two parts
[51:58] so it's not just when the gentile church
[52:00] was brought in it's got a cycle back to
[52:02] the same season again
[52:04] for the bride to enter into
[52:06] [Music]
[52:08] man this is so good i'm not talking
[52:11] about me i'm talking about this what
[52:12] program's teaching here ruth the gentile
[52:14] church just coming in
[52:15] and naomi the jewish church coming back
[52:18] this time and notice when they returned
[52:21] they turned and went
[52:23] got back to the homeland they came in
[52:25] just in barley season
[52:27] now anyone knows what barley season was
[52:30] thank you for the benefit of the doubt
[52:32] brother branham because it was pentecost
[52:34] the firstfruits how the gentile church
[52:37] was brought in under the wings of
[52:38] almighty god at pentecost the gentile
[52:41] church the bride he says and when she
[52:44] returned
[52:45] it was barley season there's the
[52:48] parallel again
[52:50] this is how that the bible could be
[52:52] written and if it feels like brother and
[52:53] that's just semantics and
[52:54] but even when you get into the original
[52:56] language that's being used it's still a
[52:58] paradox
[52:59] yeah naomi's returning but ruth returns
[53:03] out of the land of moab why because she
[53:06] has to be the type
[53:07] of this great glorious church that god
[53:09] had raised up
[53:10] that had fallen away from its position
[53:12] but god has a fourth life messenger
[53:16] god has an elijah the prophet he's going
[53:18] to turn her
[53:19] back to the faith of the original
[53:21] apostles to the faith of the original
[53:23] fathers
[53:25] and when she returns she returns in a
[53:28] season
[53:30] barley season where this time there's
[53:33] going to be a rapture
[53:35] there's going to be a manifestation of
[53:36] jesus christ coming to its fullness
[53:38] and then that's going to be be delivered
[53:41] to naomi
[53:46] and ruth will have her boaz
[53:48] [Music]
[53:50] when i look at this god's brought it
[53:52] full circle
[53:53] [Music]
[53:55] he said the gentile church was brought
[53:56] into the wings of the almighty god at
[53:58] pentecost what did he do he brought a
[53:59] restoration of pentecost
[54:01] naomi returning to the palestine
[54:06] [Music]
[54:07] that times the fig time our time is
[54:10] harvest time
[54:12] just these events lining up so perfectly
[54:17] i thank god that he's put us in this
[54:19] season could we stand together tonight
[54:24] [Music]
[54:25] what a beautiful season
[54:39] [Music]
[54:50] if you need a touch from the lord
[54:51] tonight just lift your hand as we pray
[54:53] the lord i receive you your heads are
[54:56] bowed i want you to think about this
[54:57] if god would orchestrate history
[55:01] if god in the beginning would establish
[55:04] seasons
[55:06] and the war the earth revolving around
[55:09] the sun
[55:11] in order these things in such a way to
[55:13] where these seasons in time would fall
[55:15] at particular moments
[55:17] and then establish the israeli hebrew
[55:19] nation their calendar around
[55:21] and a lot synchronized these events to
[55:23] it
[55:24] and then when he begins to deal with the
[55:26] gentile church it synchronizes perfectly
[55:28] in a spiritual way with these things
[55:30] and then when he begins to politically
[55:31] bring back the fig tree it synchronizes
[55:34] perfectly with these things
[55:35] if god could do that
[55:38] over seasons and rotations and
[55:42] planets and all the factors that work in
[55:44] nations and governments and politics
[55:46] don't you think he has he can do
[55:48] something for you tonight
[55:51] that the timing in your body the
[55:52] synchronizing of your of your heart to
[55:54] things of god any disconcordance
[55:56] anything that seems
[55:57] un it seems broken and unfixable can't
[56:00] you just
[56:00] trust him tonight and maybe you could
[56:04] just say his brother bran
[56:05] admonished us to say i'm really born
[56:07] again and i don't care how rough the
[56:09] road gets if jesus goes with me i'll go
[56:13] knowing that he's got it all in control
[56:16] he's working all these things out
[56:18] so perfectly so beautifully i'm not
[56:20] looking for affirmation right now for
[56:21] you to pat me on the back but
[56:23] it can you express it maybe with an amen
[56:25] or a hand raised do you see
[56:27] do you see how these things synchronize
[56:29] and line up you see the time and place
[56:32] that ruth comes and naomi come to
[56:34] bethlehem
[56:35] at a time barley harvest in a place
[56:38] bethlehem
[56:39] and there's a time and a place that it
[56:40] signifies for us as the bride can you
[56:42] see this
[56:44] then can't you believe tonight that god
[56:46] will meet your need
[56:48] a gracious heavenly father lord i bring
[56:50] it to that point tonight
[56:52] that as we stand here as your children
[56:54] then we must believe that whatever the
[56:57] ups and downs and the revolvings and the
[56:59] turns and the disappointments and the
[57:00] persecutions
[57:02] and the financial pressure and the loss
[57:04] of friendships and whatever it might be
[57:06] that somehow you're still working all
[57:08] these cycles for
[57:09] our good and that this time that we're
[57:13] in
[57:14] is a season of restoration a season of
[57:18] resurrection and redemption fullness of
[57:20] redemption
[57:22] that father we can believe that you are
[57:24] mindful of what we're going through
[57:27] you're mindful of the difficulties and
[57:29] the challenges that we face
[57:31] and lord if ruth felt hopeless and
[57:34] scared that day
[57:35] [Music]
[57:37] she walked into bethlehem judah a
[57:39] stranger
[57:42] and felt like an outcast felt like she
[57:45] didn't belong and began to miss her
[57:47] sister orp and she felt all alone
[57:51] lord as we dramatized before we would
[57:53] want to tell her
[57:54] honey don't worry don't worry
[57:58] one day soon you're going to go out and
[58:00] glean

[58:12] going to be your redemption
[58:15] and your name is going to be forever
[58:18] tied with the messiah

[58:23] could give that message to ruth

[58:27] your holy spirit is telling us
[58:30] that you've got it in control that all
