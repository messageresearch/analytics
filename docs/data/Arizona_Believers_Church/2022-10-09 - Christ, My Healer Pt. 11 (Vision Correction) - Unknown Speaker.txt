TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is part 11 of Christ My Healer and again Christ my healer just continuing this series part 11 and my subtitle today is vision correction and uh this is uh a lot on my heart I think it's going to be a very simple subject but what we want to preface this by is in this approach with these we're addressing the barriers to Healing looking at our mental approach to Christ Our State of Mind as we approach Christ for our healing and as this is part 11 in a series on Divine Healing and I spent a lot of time laying the foundation so some of you may be waiting when is he going to be getting to it I'm in the heart of it now but the real heart of Divine Healing The Heart of the subject and so vision correction is our title today and it's a very broad subject but I trust we can zero in on some things that really help last week we spoke on or the week prior to that a couple Sundays ago we spoke on chronic conditions of the heart and in this subject and we're kind of continuing on the same theme chronic conditions of the heart we were looking at how that heart problems maybe not in the physical part of the heart but in our minds or our Spirits how there's heart problems that can actually cause sickness and I think we understand that worry anxiety I want to get into it Lord willing just even how a lack of forgiveness inhibits prohibits us from being healed there's a lot of things that relate to our minds that cause sickness but then it's our mental state that can keep us from being healed and that was the thought behind The Chronic conditions of the heart because we may be seeking Divine Healing we need healing in our body we need a healing of this cancer we need a healing of this ailment and we're desperate in to see physical healing but it's actually something in our state of mind that's going to keep us from it so God needs to First address a chronic condition of the heart before he can address a chronic condition in our bodies and that we break that up by looking at we're soul spirit and body and I think that image has been before us quite a bit lately so we can relate to it that way now James chapter 5 this is where I want to start it's a little bit of a review but I'm hoping that we're just jumping right in this James chapter 5 verse 13 and we know in reading this in verses 14 and 15 is where he says if there's any sick among you call to the elders and have them pray anointing you with oil and the Bible says and the prayer of faith shall deliver you so he said if there's any sick call the Elders have them anoint you pray over you and the the scripture is and this is what we believe that if we're sick and the prayer and it's the prayer of faith that'll heal us that Faith healing us and that prayer over us and that's one of the most outstanding scriptures on Divine Healing and laying hands on the sick and they shall recover James enforcing that that we if we're sick we can call for the elders they can anoint us with prayer known as with oil pray over us and will be healed but verse 13 as we've looked at it this way it's an often overlooked conditioned precedent or something that James addresses first before we call to the elders and it's it and the the point of this I see is that it's putting us in the state of mind to benefit from that act of the prayer faith for physical healing and so this is what it says in verse 13. it says is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms so if there's any Afflicted let them pray is any Mary let them sing songs do I need to go up or down on this down am I good here little up good all right don't be afraid to tell me what to do back there brother Mitch we know you run the show uh without you he would it would be a nightmare be a train wreck of the sound so thank you but uh so is any Afflicted among you let them pray is any Merit let him sing songs this is this is Paul James addressing what we're thinking before we ask for the elders to come and pray for us if we're physically sick we look to how this word Afflicted means suffering of mind or emotion and so is your mind suffering are your emotions Disturbed are you are you a burdened with uh with complexes do you have scars that you're wrestling with internally have you suffered from disappointments do you need to if you have a lot of things working through your mind he's saying if you're Afflicted then pray about your state of mind if you're disturbed if you're emotionally upset if you're worrying if you're doubting he doesn't say in that state call for the elders to pray for your sick body he says you need to pray first because that's going to align your spirits and your emotions and help wash you and make you more sensitive and then he says is any Mary and it's kind of the the question that assumes the answer is anyone marry in other words are you in good spirits are you happy are you glad are you cheerful if not sing Psalms and so there's a it's a direct addressing of the believer's State of Mind before they would call and have the elders pray over their physical sickness because if I could put this it's the mental state it's the emotional state that we need to be in before healing can come and so that was that's again maybe just a synopsis of what we were looking at in terms of The Chronic conditions of the heart now Vision Correction in looking at this is we're continuing to look at the function of the state of mind or the human emotions and we touched on this a little bit so we'll bring it back in it's it's looking at our attitude towards the promise of God so if you're sick the Bible says uh that you're gonna you want to be prayed for to believe for your healing to prayer of faith will save you and that if you're not in the right frame of mind when you go to pray that's going to keep you from getting the healing you want because it's gonna it's gonna pervert or maybe Cloud your attitude towards the promise well I'm going to have hands laid on me but I'm not sure and well I'm sick and I believe God's A Healer but I don't know maybe I deserve this or maybe it's not for me and so it has a lot to do with our attitude towards the promise of God so in looking at vision correction I was originally originally going to title it vision problem problems I thought that might be too negative but Envision correction we're dealing with vision problems problems with our vision and a sermon show us the father we read this last time brother Brown says I go on record I say this about the word of God being a seed if you can take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God he will bring it to pass this is one of those absolute sayings that I think he says the right mental attitude so many different times to us the right attitude the right mental attitude says it so many times that this is a principle that's pretty firm in the word of God the right attitude towards any Divine promise will bring it to pass and he says if you will get if you can get yourself in position to believe that that promise was to you so the right mental attitude has something to do with where you're standing so if you can get yourself in position so maybe you hear about a promise you're kind of seeing part of the promise but you got to move yourself around a little bit and get yourself into position to where you can believe or see that that promise is to you a similar statement in the sermon the Queen of Sheba God's words are true I believe the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass he says if you can look at it in the right way so that statement the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass any Divine promise will bring it to pass and he uses the phrase of getting yourself in position or in this way he says if you can look at it the right way and that's exactly what attitude relates to an attitude is as we look at in terms of its uh your behavior how you feel towards something your opinion but attitude is your way of viewing something attitude is literally your perspective your Vantage Point our perspective is a particular attitude toward or a way of regarding something it is a point of view so your attitude is your point of view what's your opinion of this what's your attitude towards this what's your Vantage Point what's your view what's your way of considering it or regarding it if you uh if you have a view of something you're regarding it in a particular light or with a particular attitude and so when brother Branham says the right mental attitude will bring any Divine promise of God to pass he's telling us that one of the most important factors in receiving a blessing from God or receiving the promise is the way you view it I know this seems very very simplistic but it's just a cheap trick to get a lot of amens right when it's real simple and you know it you amen a lot but it there's a it's just a very simple principle of saying the way you view it your position towards it the way you're looking at it and so if this is such a uh a clear thing in the word of God that there's a promise of God that says I am your healer and you can be healed or whatever the Divine promise may be and program says the right view of it will bring it to pass then that tells us the most important part in terms of me receiving that Divine promise is how I view it and that's where we get this idea of vision correction God may he may need to heal or correct our vision before we can receive healing in our body now I'm not talking about the physical part but I'm talking about that mental perception that mental part the State of Mind are you Afflicted in mind or are you not seeing things the right way are you not settled are you not sure then pray because God may need to align and correct your vision before he can heal that part of your body now if you'll turn to Mark chapter 8 foreign tells us in verse 13. that he had I left the Pharisees and they're questioning entered into the ship and they begin to uh pass to the other side verse 14. now the disciples had forgotten to take bread neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf and Jesus then makes the statement in verse 15. and remember that part's important because they're sitting there with one loaf of bread and have all this is a boat full of people and he says take heed Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod and they reason among themselves saying it is because we have no bread and so they're thinking he's either passive aggressive or this is just Jesus's way of digging at him a little bit you know why didn't you guys bring more bread there's 12 13 of us what are you thinking uh and this shows just how shallow their thinking is because Jesus is not talking about the literal bread but the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod is a spiritual warning something that will uh eat up and pervade and something that'll corrupt and they immediately begin to think very Carly very surfaced Jesus is talking about matters of the Soul matters of the spirit they're thinking in terms of their stomach and their digestive system and Jesus when Jesus knew it verse 17 he saith unto them this is where we're starting to look at this vision correction and so we're looking at it the first part we're looking as even this direct spiritual application the way we see things and perceive things and what our discernment is and when Jesus knew it he saith in him why reason ye because you have no bread I say this and the first thing you think of is someone only brought one loaf of Sarah Lee and he says perceive ye not yet neither understand are you thinking about this at all are is there any depth of understanding with the things that are taking place and he makes this statement I think this very um very uh significant heavy your heart yet hardened now not by sin but something's been dulled or something something's not getting through there's some some barrier there that he's addressing maybe ground that's hard so there's no deepness of Earth what's taking place isn't penetrating like it ought to haven't I see you not having ears hear you not so they had the physical ability of eyesight they had the physical ability of hearing but yet the seeing and the hearing here speaks of kind of picking up the thought or catching what was being said and then he says and do you not remember can you not does your memory not even serve you well in this instance when I break the Five Loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of fragments took you up so now he's probing their their memory they send him 12. and when you and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of fragments took you up and they said seven and maybe at this point he's hoping that light bulbs start going off right like ah and he said to them how is it that ye do not understand and so when you read this these different questions that he's asking he asked these several different questions all probing at their mental state is he says why are you reasoning do you not perceive do you not understand do you not remember is your heart hardened how many baskets did I take of that time how many this time do you not understand he's saying how is it that when I make this statement that you ought to be looking at one way you immediately take it and apply it in the physical and even apply it in the physical you still miss it hey you're saying that's not really what I meant but even then if I was kind of alluding to the fact that she only brought one loaf one of you should object and say well Jesus you can take this and divide it to where it's We'll have leftovers by the time we get to where we're going and so he was asking he was asking them to consider how they were viewing the situation and when he uses the phrase have you yet hardened your heart have ye your heart yet hardened it literally means blinded because he's talking about understanding and perception and how you see things and how you view things he says are you blind is your heart yet blinded because there was still a need for greater perception and understanding of what Jesus was accomplishing remember a lot of the emphasis and the things that we took in the foundation is that Jesus could do Miracles but then there's a way that we view that tour we're only letting that get very shallow and very surfaced where we're there for the loaves we're there for the fish but we're not really there for the spiritual need that we have or the soul need that we have and that's the tendency of the flesh to look for things that satisfy the flesh the bodily exercise and excitement and all sorts of things that thrill us but never getting to real the real heart of the matter the soul of the matter and so there was still a need for greater awareness to see what was actually happening in Mark chapter 6 verses 51 to 52 . this is an another instance where Jesus uses this phrase and it's in chapter six where he feeds the five thousand and then in this instance where he's walking upon the sea and so there's a very significant events that take place in chapter six he feeds five thousand they take up all those uh the the seven basket fools or excuse me the 12 basketfuls and now Jesus comes walking on the water there's a lot there that we could unpack unpack in terms of their fear and they begin to worry and they begin to be afraid but after it's over he says and when he went up in up the he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were so amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered so there is in this particular instance they are so shocked and in amazement at what he has done and there and the question of how they are amazing themselves beyond measure and wondered it suggests that they're wondering isn't just in pure amazement like we could say about the things of God at this point as Believers that whenever God does something we're always amazed but we're never surprised right because that's amazing but it doesn't surprise me because that's just exactly what God would do if you were drowning in a lake and all of a sudden you saw a Christ walking on the water to pick you up out of the water you would be amazed but it wouldn't surprise you because we believe that God can do those things but to them their amazement beyond measure and their wonderment was now causing them in their minds to be like what what is going on here this is getting weird right there's something about it because it says in verse 52 for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their heart was hardened in other words they're they're understanding ought to have grown at this point their faith should have been increasing through each Miracle to where whenever Jesus does what he did to feed the five thousand then he comes walking on the water like see I mean what do you expect this is our go this is the Messiah this is what he can do and their faith get even bigger at that point but now because the Bible's saying that they were not they had not considered they had not reflected upon the Miracles they had not fully considered what the implications were well if this is this then this is that and this is what it must be they hadn't really thought about it in a deep way we talked Wednesday night about critical thinking it's not me doesn't mean we're being critical it means you're actually thinking about what's happening means you're actually considering what's happened and since they had not considered the Bible says or reflected deeply upon the Miracles they were wondering because had they done it they would not have wondered at this miracle they would have said well add that to the list of powers and we know we can multiply things now we know he can walk upon the waves we can he can calm the Seas it ought to uh it ought to deepened their faith but the Bible and telling the story when Jesus walks on the sea they were still holding the feelings of doubt there was still a sense of anxiety maybe even a hesitation uh if I could even say and I don't want to put too much emphasis on it but maybe some unbelief right man it's hard for them to accept this it's hard for them to believe this and he's using the phrase that your heart is hardened it's not they didn't have eyes that they didn't have ears Jesus is talking about their mind they weren't rubbing their eyes and doubting what they saw but they're doubting what it meant they're not they're not trying to unplug their ears and they're questioning what they heard in terms of did I hear that did I see that but it's the process by which they are perceiving and Discerning what was happening and so it is this heart being yet hardened is the blindness of the Mind and this is what's transpired in Mark chapter eight it calls back to Mark chapter six and it's addressing the attitude of the of the belief of the disciples in the boat towards the Christ that's with them think about that the attitude of the disciples Christ is there the Wonder working Miracle God is there the power to multiply the loaves the power to calm the seas in every instance Christ is present right there with them in the boat but the problem is they're added to towards the divine presence it's their attitude towards the present Jesus Christ the one that is here fulfilling his promised word he's here he's doing many wonderful things and he has power to walk on water he has power to calm the waves there's power to multiply those his power to heal our bodies but the only thing that will keep it from happening is our attitude towards it and the sermon and knoweth it not brother Graham's talking about the doctor giving medicine and actually the phrase brother Brandon uses he says I feel like a doctor I feel like I'm giving medicine to the woman and having to hold her mouth shut to get her to swallow it and he's alluding to the preaching of the word he's trying to give us some medicine but we're not swollen so he feels like he's got to hold our mouths and cover up our our nose and choke us to where we have to swallow in order to breathe and that's just maybe me putting in my own words but that's the way it reads but he mentions the doctor giving medicine he says spit it out between your fingers pour some more down then finally shake their head and Revolt back and go back and won't do it in other words the medicine's there but they're spitting it out they're pouring their head out they're refusing it's in the mouth it's right there it's really all they need to do is swallow it just needs to drop a little bit deeper he says yet you come back again and pour it in again that medicine coming right back in again then who is to blame not the doctor not the medicine but the attitude of the person is that I think that's that maybe our listen let's just all mistakes were made but not by me right now we always feel yeah that's a big problem but I'm not part of it and we always think yeah that's not right something was done wrong no that's not good and and we don't think it's we're no we're the reason so we do have this sense in a lot of ways that we can recognize when something's wrong but our instinct is to not think that we are it and so in a lot of ways we could blame the doctor right well it's a doctor's falter we could blame the medicine the prescription well it's the prescription's fault it's Western medicine they're the problem well it's the acupuncturist if that's that's a problem it's the you're using the wrong brand of oil whatever it is we start we want to blame a lot of other people but even in this context he's saying it's not the preacher and it's not what he's preaching it's your attitude and I think that's sometimes what we're in just be honest with ourselves that are Instinct sometimes is to put the problem on somebody else well he's not preaching it right or this isn't right that's not right but what about us who are taking the medicine are we taking the medicine what's my attitude towards it maybe not to use a a kind of an aggravating statement I don't know if this is politically correct but it's a mental problem it's an issue of perception it's an issue of our vision and so as he abrides them why did you reason do you not perceive do you not understand is your heart blinded do you have eyes to see do you have ears but don't hear do you even remember that'd be the easiest one right calling out all those elements of the spirit imagination memory reason and affection it's all he's identified all this suspects how is it that you do not understand and then verse 22 immediately it comes into a miracle and I believe it's here for a reason and he comes to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him now he just upgraded them he says is your heart yet hardened are you blind I mean if we just put it in modern parlance right you blind right that's maybe what we would say to one another and he says they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him and he took the Blind Men by the hand and let him out of town and when he'd spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked if he saw ought maybe put another way do you see anything now this is this is a unique statement when he comes when he answers he looked up and said I see so now this man was blind but now he can see and Jesus is asking him again now this is a probing question uh what is it you see do you see what do you see ask him if he saw anything he's he's wanting him to say what what do you see and so he says I see men and what I'm and if I could put it in my own words I see what I assume to be men but they look to me no different in trees than trees but I know them to be men because they're walking and trees don't walk that's kind of what's meant by the phrase I see men as trees but yet they're walking I can't disturb discern among uh physical shapes I can't tell whether it be a man or a tree but it's a man it's as if it's a tree walking but yet I know it's a man and we can absolutely assume from this I think it's very very clear I don't know if there'd be much arguments no matter how many commentaries you pulled up or what preachers you talked to I'm pretty sure that they would all agree that this indicates that the physical eye was healed there were some obstruction there was some something cloudy in his vision there was something detached there was something wrong physically that breach was minted there was a healing to the physical part of the eye and some obstruction removed something taken away or something added to to mend the physical part and so now Jesus says what do you see and he says I can see what looked like to be men is trees walking now and I I know that I'm maybe going a little bit slower today than I had hoped but and you're thinking wow how fast can you go then but the vision involves uh the function of the eye that'd be the physical part that's detecting light but then also the brain which is essentially interpreting the light and and that's where the vision is I know if you really start thinking about this it gets a little weird but what you're seeing right now is in your head right I mean it's like what it I know it makes a lot of sense what you're seeing but it's all in your head and I'm not wrong for saying that listen you see me up here in a gray suit and you see me preaching but it's all in your head and you're like yeah duh right it is it's that's where Vision comes to its picture and so there's Optical parts and that's why when people say they refer to things as optical illusions uh it's technically not correct right it's a visual illusion because the optic part is the physical part and there's the physical part and the neural part that transmits uh information and then there's a whole mental part that takes place and so Vision in terms of physical parts involves the cornea and the pupil and the iris and the lens and the retina and an optic nerve and then even our tear ducts are part of our vision because the tears keep the eyes from being irritated and help keep our vision clean and so there's a lot of different physical parts to the eye and then even the optic nerve is a physical part that's going to help send signals to the brain to produce an image if we even and I had some slides to uh share this but I realize now we just kind of had left those off but maybe just try to describe it but the vision begins at the cornea that that initial layer in the eye kind of a curved layer and it's going to bend the light and that's going to enter into that's the very process it's going to enter in that way and then it comes into the pupil which is kind of the Gateway of the light which is then uh controlled by the iris which is a muscle that it's dilating that pupil and Contracting it and making it larger it's controlling it's a muscle that's controlling the size of the people what is it determining how much light comes in how much you're receiving it's in this way that the eye works a lot like your camera and then there's a lens that focuses that light sharpens the detail and then the retina transforms that light into electrical signals the eye is a fascinating organ all these different parts and then those signals are sent to the brain by the optic nerve and then the brain creates the image that we see this is amazing right no man invented this God did this and so what we're seeing is a reproduction of the light now just get you can get real spiritual here we just start really preaching of the light that's being reflected and absorbed and sharpened and focused and the Brain reproduces this image and so when Jesus lays his hands it doesn't actually take some away from the crowd this is not going to be a public show he takes away from the crowd he spits and he anoints his eyes he puts his hands on him and then says do you see he says I see Ministries walking Jesus healed something we could say maybe from the cornea to the optic nerve there was a physical healing of the eye toward that process is obviously working because now he he's the the light being reflected from the men that it's being it's being brought into his mind where he can make this decision but he needed further healing I can say it that way he needed a further healing of his visual system because there there's there's a part of that part of this process of vision that relates more to our visual perception not just our Acuity where well I can see 2020 or I can say whatever it is how we measure that that's related a lot to the shape of the eyeball and whether there be any anything physically that's obstructing it but there's a part also of our visual perception where we're thinking and considering and putting the pieces together of this pixelated image that's been sent to our minds because that's part of the brain the visual cortex is the largest system in the brain and what the information sent to your brain is in 2D did you realize that the light as it's sent to your brain is two-dimensional and your brain makes it three-dimensional it's your brain that does that you guys are smart right I'm not Flat Stanley up here today you see it 3D three-dimensionally it's the mind that does that it's the mind that creates the depth perception it's the mind that's interpreting Shadows it's the mind that's interpreting relational shapes to recognize he's further away they're closer there's light here there's a the mind is doing it's the biggest part of the vision to where the mind gets a pixelated image and then the brain says I know how to fill this in sharpen the details and make this look complete that's what uh Google The Almighty Google has just recently rolled out with their latest pixel 7 I believe it is to where now they can take your old blurry photos and make them clear because that's what your brain does your brain is able to take something that's blurry and fill in the gaps and colorize it and and makes things sharp and make things work and focus it you have a blind spot a physical blind spot in your eyes and your periphery it's absolutely there you there's different ways that you can experiment with it and see it but what does your brain do it knows there's something there and it fills it in it's the it's the original healing tool right Photoshop figured it out that our brains have a healing tool we'll take what's next to it and use that to click alt click click right and it's going to fill in the blank with what's around it and that's how Photoshop works with the healing tool or brush sometimes it's just taking what's nearby and and making the assumption that hey this is what ought to be there and so if you try this I don't know how I'm just guessing I don't know if this would really work if you tried to do that with baldness or something then you've got to be sure you're getting the hair not the bald part of the baldness just keeps getting bigger and bigger I'm assuming that's how it works so now Jesus has healed something in the physical part and he clearly can see now better than he had before and this is where the story is fascinating because he says and after that as if healing his blind eyes wasn't fascinating enough after that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and this if you read this there's I don't know what the initial knee-jerk reaction might be I can't remember how I begin to process this years ago before the Lord quickened this to me that there's it's as if he prayed and he kind of healed him so he needs to pray again because that doesn't make sense he sees men as trees walking maybe Jesus was needed to pray for him again or sometimes it just takes a couple times to get it right but he does this to demonstrate something to us very important especially in light of the fact that the disciples were there watching all these Miracles Mark chapter 6 12 loaves of baskets of bread taking up the leftovers out of those love that love and then they come later he walks on the water he comes later he feeds four thousand again and they're witnessing all sorts of Miracles and then Jesus makes one comment like great we did bring enough bread there's a reason why this story takes place immediately afterwards because now the blind man could see in a lot of the same ways that the disciples could see they could see things he could see shapes he could see the image of things he could see things walking and moving he could even say what they were but something more was missing and so this is a call back to what the disciples were going through and this is addressing the struggle the disciples so these first several chapters to recognize that there's something greater and maybe more important first that we need or that we're ultimately needing than just saying whoa Miracles awesome wonderful this is great he put his hands on him again and put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and notice the phrase and he was restored and saw every man clearly now if I could just kind of jump a little bit Christ healed the physical part the first time the second time he healed the mental part and the second touch was not to fix kind of get a further healing like ah I prayed I prayed I thought you'd get 20 20 the first time I prayed for you but I don't know maybe like maybe I don't know 120 20. I don't your vision isn't quite right let's try this again right crack the knuckles you know I don't know what just happened there let's try this again no he knows exactly what he's doing he's demonstrating something this is for us for our learning for our benefit in the scripture and so the second touch wasn't to heal the physical part was to heal the emotional part just to heal the mental part the part of the mind that makes sense of what's being sent into the body now we could make this we can make this very very simple that our and the the visual Acuity of a an infant is at a young age they're not seeing very far images aren't very sharp very clear but by the time they're two years old I think they begin to it begins to get to what's 20 20. and so a lot of the things that they say and do in the way they interact in those first couple years is due to the fact that they don't see like they ought to but then once they're two years old their vision is 20 20. and then they begin to build a database of what things ought to feel and look like in depth perception in softness and all sorts of things to wear now that's how they begin to learn to walk and to reach and to run and all sorts of things because it's the Mind as a muscle is learning to interpret data and interpret the signals that are being sent to the mind so if you take someone who's been blind especially from birth someone who's been blind and all of a sudden they're able to see the information doesn't make sense that's why when they've recorded this of people who have received their sight by the miracle of Science in adult life who've been blind all or if not most of their lives they can't tell that the Moon is not right there they don't know what a curb is they'll trip right over it they could see they could see something very large in one particular instance I read about this man was at Costco and he sees this great huge pile of pallets or what he thought were pallets he's like oh my goodness why did they put this big huge large mass in the middle of the aisle and he says it to his wife and she was like you know what are you doing and it was it was a lady on a on an electric scooter hey because he can't discern among the blobs and the shapes he didn't know male from female he didn't know smile from frown because we learn all that growing up the next person who has a baby whenever you talk to your baby go you're so cute and and always use the frown to demonstrate happiness and it's going to grow up thinking why are you mad at me right because it's visual cues it's learning and that's what's taking place I'd love to spend much more time on it maybe we can in the future but it was the God gave them in the second touch the database and the mental acuity the visual Acuity and the visual perception of an adult in One Touch he had the mind of an adult who could now tell and see every man clearly and not wonder is he happy is he sad is he close is he far away is it male or female which is becoming a bigger problem I guess these days ma'am sir is the my go-to these days and there's a way that now he could see with full understanding he saw every man clearly now if I could say this so I can try to move on in this just as the total healing of the Blind Man's eyes or the Blind Man's Vision the total healing of his vision relied upon the healing of his mind our physical healing depends upon the condition of our mind his total visual healing the healing of his visual cortex visual Acuity visual perception his whole eyesight relied upon not just the healing of the physical part but the healing of the mental part and now in another way using this as a type our physical healing May first Rely Upon Our Minds being healed before the physical part is healed it's demonstrating these very verses that there's a physical part that takes place but total healing relies upon a mental part now we want to apply that to the fact that oh I need healing of this problem my body's broken this is not fixed I have this disease I have this chronic illness whatever it may be God May needs to get your mind healed right and your vision healed right so you can receive the healing of your body brother random says we read these statements last time if you do not approach Divine Healing right you'll fail to receive your healing he says in many times many many times people want to be so tranquilized they want this that or the other what does it mean by tranquilized they want their mind numbed they want their mind tranquilized white you're anxious you're nervous you're fearful you're doubting you're suspicious you wonder if you deserve this you wonder if it's for you you're wondering if it's because of this or because of that there's all sorts of things going through your mind right all sorts of fears lumped into your mind everybody says people want to be tranquilized we'll pick up on this Wednesday night Lord willing you know they want their mind to go blank or be numbed that's what they'd rather happen is just get tranquilized instead of come to an understanding listen let's just say and I hope I'm not venturing here but if you were sick because you did something wrong and you just want your nine mine numb then you're never going to get the sense that what needs to be made right in order for your healing you're never going to get the sense of it and so don't even fear that if God says well you're sick because this happened all right let's make it right that's it that's how simple it is and so people he says that you gotta if you do not approach Divine Healing right you'll fail to receive your healing the other statement we used in conjunction with this last time this is just a statement you must know how to approach God for healing like you do with salvation I know it's a familiar Maybe if you know how you must know how to approach God for healing the same way you do for salvation so we've emphasized this a lot for several services and so I don't feel like I'm out on a limb here to try to touch on this very quickly but in your approach to Salvation there's a certain process God follows in order for you to be saved listen you don't go to bed and wake up saved right you don't go to bed I'm an awful sinner I hate my life and then you wake up in the morning like bless God right I feel like a Christian today I know that happens right we go to bed feeling awful and wake up maybe feeling good or maybe it's vice versa I don't know uh but it doesn't happen while you're asleep and so I I need to go through this very very quickly because we've been taking a lot of time just to this first first part this first third or quarter of the service do the math so I'll try to go quickly this is a familiar concept so I think I can Breeze through this very fast but let's examine it let's let's not Overlook what's happening but in Acts chapter 2 Peter's preaching and let all the house of Israel know assuredly that you've crucified the Lord Of Glory he's really just hammered in his sermon he got to that clinching point and then verse 37 when they'd heard the sermon that was preached it says they were pricked in their heart and asked what do we do and so the heart was provoked by what Peter was preaching you say this way the word stirred up their emotions the word stood up their thought process because now they had put themselves in the place of the guilty hands that crucified the Messiah instead of saying well that's a weird story and walking away they're like they're in the story now like they're there and they're on in the guilty chair they're being indicted and they're like what do I do like they felt it what happened the word had kind of stirred up their hearts or stirred their emotions because the Bible says they were pricked in their heart that means to pain the mind to agitate it it's used to the emotion of Sorrow so there had been some sorrow some guilt some conviction stirred up within them and now that they're experiencing this disconcerting emotion they take it the step first Peter what do we do about this and he tells them to repent when they said they were pricked in their heart it's the seed of thought passion desire appetite affection purpose and Endeavors they had found that it was right there in their mind they felt that that was what pricked and they asked what they would do and so if you recognize Peter preached the word the first thing it did is it stirred up their heart and G and that's what brought him to repent he says repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so we got our text in for the baptism down and and he's and he says that and then he says they did they called upon the Lord they were they were baptized and it added souls to the to the kingdom that day through this process and so their soul was healed and recognized the healing of the Soul began with an attitude adjustment in the person's heart at one moment did they just hear about this Jesus right may have been the very ones or she's yelling crucify him and they had a particular way of seeing it at a particular way of viewing the Messiah had a particular way of using the viewing the disciples but now through the preacher of the word their mind is changed and their hearts and emotions and their Spirits are being stirred up all by the preaching of the word and it put them in the condition to therefore repent and receive the Holy Ghost that's how the soul is healed in second Corinthians chapter 7 verse 10 it says for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death what is it Sorrow by God's word brings repentance that you need not regret that there's no regret associated with that you don't have to regret being sorry there's no regret Godly sorrow Works repentance not to be repented of but then there's this worldly sorrow that works death why because Godly sorrow is not just mere remorse or regret it's a star which is not selfish it's not woe it's me it the motive and objective is not selfish Godly sorrow is something that's more than just remorse because the worldly sorrow arises from the selfish motives worldly considerations like oh I shouldn't have done that it's a different level remember Judas sorrowed but found no place of repentance so there's a worldly saw worldly emotion worldly crying worldly regret worldly oh I shouldn't have done that but then there's a Godly sorrow that the word of God creates that the word of God brings and it's a change of heart or you can say a change of mind and this is why it's so critical because that repentance is coming to your right mind that's what repentance you come to your right mind you own it you acknowledge it you realize that there's this horror it's not regret just an uneasy feeling I wonder if I should repent or I maybe there is something to this you can't just try it but this Godly sorrow is a change of mind it's coming to your right mind because sorrow Judas sorrow but sorrow in itself is not repentance but if it's Godly sorrow it contributes to that repentance and so it's in that state of repentance which is being in your right mind that you bypass all other emotional states remember how brother Brown talks about you know he's receiving God while you're in your mind because people later in life can lose their minds and they're not held accountable but it's in that moment or that time when they're in the right mind and so being in your right minded it cuts off it goes past all these other emotional states that might oppose salvation all the barriers to receive in Salvation in that moment all questions are gone in that moment all doubt is gone in that moment all fear is gone and you receive the Lord and you receive Christ and it changes your nature so let's catch that dynamic in Salvation the word preach in Acts chapter to the word preached brought them to the proper mindset or the proper mental state to receive the word of God to repent and to receive salvation and if you can recall now and I'm not going to try to repreach the last 10 services but remember all the different foundational services to Christ my healer the original the first initial and original way to receive any blessing from God is at the word by the word remember we we you say it so often we believe it so often that we don't really stop and think okay then what's happening if it's by the word then what literally is happening if I'm receiving it by the word because if not we're taking it like what we need to do is we just need to have like you know tile our ceilings in The Bible Pages of the Bible or have you know the Bible printed out on their sheets or our comforter get a weighted blanket that's stuffed with the King James version Bible right and I'm just going to sleep under this in the word by osmosis is going to Bear upon my sickness what is it that's happening when the word does it what's taking place when the first an initial way to receive any blessing from God is at the word what does the word actually doing whereas it's having its impact how is it taking place this isn't self-serving I think this is the obvious the word is first penetrating to your emotions and your mind and it's dealing with the condition of your heart it's dealing with your emotions it's dealing with your attitude and the first initial way for something to happen is for the word to take your mind and your attitude in your heart and to adjust it and get it right and it puts you in the channel to receive a benefit from God the Bible says in Hebrews 4 12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints and Marrow what does it do at Pierce's Body Spirit Soul the word is applicable to Soul Spirit body the scripture is very very rich and deep it divides among Soul spirit and body and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart we know that the word of God is light light is what makes manifest what light is what discloses light is what gives us the capacity to see that's what colors are that's what vision is it's the taking in of light and focusing the light and letting so much in and so much out and then the brain interpreted it all begins with light the word is a light it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the thoughts at your considerations it's what you're pondering what you're deliberating your thoughts of the heart and the intents it's speaking again to your meditation your manner of feeling what your will is it's your act of thinking so now I I know that we've been we've been in this subject now this morning for quite a while but stay with me because you're looking at this we're wanting to understand what the barriers are to Healing maybe the boundaries within healing within which healing works because you'll find that the way God does it even though he might do it many different ways take a man out from around the crowd spit clay put Clay on his eyes he might do different things to loose the tongue there's a lot of different ways but you'll find that he creates these boundaries he's always working within the framework of his word and so if the word is a discerner of our thinking of our emotions of our feelings it discerns it to address it yeah that if you could just change your attitude towards church I don't like going to church because brother Aaron always makes me feel like I I'm doubting and I apologize that's certainly not my goal but if you if it's making you feel that way it's there to address it hey it's like okay God wouldn't be uncovering it he's kind of like see this see this see that let's deal with it right but some of us get embarrassed right and as soon as we start feeling oh no and we run away from it because God is not like our parents he's not like our best friends he's not like our Social Circle he's maybe he's not like maybe some preachers we've experienced God is not the one that exposes something to go hey right this is not a playground God's not trying to make fun of you he's not trying to be a little he's not trying to make you go viral and and cancel you if the spirit discerns it and brings it out he does it to address it he if he uncovers anything broken he does it because he wants to fix it he doesn't bring it up in your heart and also you feel I'm broke and I've got this complex I got this car so that God can say yeah see I told you you're scarred I told you you're broken I told you you have all these breaches he's saying no I'm only doing it so I can fix it you've covered it up you've denied it you've filled it up with this you've done that he says no no I'm washing all this away and I'm bringing it to the surface and I know it makes you really really uncomfortable but I would never do this if I wasn't wanting to fix it before I finally fix it I'm not trying to make you feel bad I'm not trying to make you feel broken that's one thing I say personally but I say it with some restraint it has agonized me to experience situations where you're told that you're broken just so that person can make you feel that they are the ones that can fix you and they do it in a humanistic way and we've experienced it so often where we're treated that way in a way to be manipulated and to be abused and taken advantage of that when God begins to do it we get a little bit fearful because that's the way the world has treated us but listen God does it because he wants you not himself to receive the glory necessarily but he wants you to receive your healing he'll if he uncovers anything broken he does it to fix it not just to expose it have you noticed this a lot of times in the gift of discernment brother Bynum is in the prayer lines he's Discerning issues but what is he doing he discerns them he's not just telling them some anecdote from the past you'll find that most often there's times when it's not a problem or issue but the discernment is the name or the address right and we say that's benign but that's Supernatural so you can realize that's a miracle that could only come from God and that lifts their faith to be healed but what about all the times where he says this happened in your life and he's not the the doctor standing before you and he's identified these tumors on your toe or the doctor's doing this it's all relative to the sickness or better yet they're healing there's things that discernment would uncover in order to address the issues whether what was causing the sickness or the barrier to them being healed something in their mind they keep going back to in the sermon the Inside Man and I'm just going to have to keep preaching here he says you think the heart trouble left you while you were sitting there and this is a man coming in the prayer line he says he's Discerning that it was heart trouble this is really interesting to the man I'm sure he's like oh yes do you think you left you while you're sitting there do you believe that God's going to make you well you do come here praise almighty God May the blessing rest upon this man knowing that Satan would send him to a premature grave if he could now I curse this horrible Affliction and as you the Creator standing here can create may he be healed in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you brother God bless you your attitude is enough to bring the healing what was the purpose of the discernment what was the purpose of the prayer what was the purpose of all of it to get that attitude because your attitude is enough to bring the healing brother Brian said the attitude is what brings the results the sermon proven his word but before now this is where I think we're getting right into the thick of it this is probably the that uh real turn here I think this is where we're taking our turn we're getting into the meat of where I want to be today but before we pray for the sick we've got to get the people in that attitude it's the attitude that always brings the results it's the attitude that you take towards God here's the woman touched His Garment she was healed with the blood issue soldiers spit in his face and put a crown on his Thorns ahead and felt no virtue it's your approach right talking about different touches different attitudes different approaches it's your Repro approach the attitude is what it takes and that's what it is tonight dear friend it takes the attitude we are and believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ but it's your attitude that brings the results we've learned that in scripture already that Christ could be there in the boat and a loaf of bread nearby but with the wrong attitude it'll never benefit them the mechanics are here and so is the Dynamics I love this if you can just get started God will do the rest I love that if you can just get started oh how to get started get the right attitude attitude adjustment I think we've been you're saying remember there and this has been a few Services you've really been hitting this yes it's just an attitude adjustment and I I've thought about this recently in Christ saying well what's harder to forgive sins or to heal the body listen how many of you have witnessed a miracle in the in the flesh and you've seen it you know God's here on the flesh right okay we got hands on so we've seen God do things that we can verify physically if he can do that can he also heal the mind and the body can he also do that which we cannot see is he not able if you can just get started God will do the rest how do I get started get the right attitude is your mind Afflicted yes how do I get started to pray are you sad sing hymns get if you just get started what does it take to get started just have the right approach just have the right attitude because then God does the rest you don't have to get yourself in the frame of mind to heal yourself you don't have to get yourself in the frame of mind to diagnose what your sickness is you don't have to get yourself in the right frame of mind to get started isn't to figure out the remedy to get started isn't to figure out how to do it to get started is just to believe and to have the right attitude towards the word of God God says I'll take it from here in Acts chapter 14 verses 8 to 10 this to be very very important to catch this and they're sad their side of certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a from his mother's womb who never had walked now remember too also how that when people have been uh suffered traumatic injury and they can actually repair the spinal cord a lot of things they can do to fix the injury but then the brain has to learn to walk all over again the atrophy the certain things in the muscle and it takes sometimes years of physical therapy to get back to walking and they do it because it's just the it's the the remarkable all healing is Divine Healing it's the way that God made the body it's the way he made the mind it's all part of God's program and this man was impotent from birth had never walked the man the same heard Paul speaks so now the man this impotent man this uh crippled man is sitting hearing the word of God preached who Paul Behold steadfastly beholding Him so now as Paul's preaching he sees the man there being crippled they're listening to the word being preached and perceiving that he had failed to be healed Paul said with the loud voice stand upright on the thy feet and he leaped and walked even though he had never walked before he didn't get up all wobbly right he didn't need Physical Therapy Jesus said here's a card jeroboam down the street he's got a physical therapy Studio he'll stretch you out a little bit he'll get you on the bars he'll get you walking no it was all there mentally physically he left he walked he was agile he was quick he had the the coordination and the fluidity he had all that there God had touched him and healed him and noticed the order Paul is preaching the word and what did it do it built Faith because the man steadfastly believed he had Faith to be healed now whether or not the scripture is silent on this but Paul is preaching and the man had Faith now whether or not he had faith in his mind I believe I can be healed I believe I can be healed the word of God had raised his attitude and his faith and elevated his faith and so now with just faith it was faith that to be healed so then the climax comes the punch line comes the the flip the switch is flipped be rise up and in that moment without thinking about it without considering without worry there was this faith that could respond to the situation and he laughed and began to walk so the word preached Faith was built for the healing because it's remember the word the word the word the word the word that God's original way to receive a blessing is by the word and well I think we start doing is we start thinking oh it's got to be in that declaration right wake up be healed right it wasn't stand it was the word being preached and the faith was there it was being built it wasn't Thy word stand the faith was already there that was just the impetus that was what put it in motion for the round of the sermon identified Christ of all ages he says now just be reverent okay so um I I'm getting anxious about I just need to get my attitude right I'm starting to get nervous Lord help me I don't wanna I wanna get I I hope to just I want to just drive this now home today so now he's telling people at the end of this service and I want you to catch the principal not just get so zeroed in on all the mechanics and dynamics of this but this principle brother Ram's using be reverent look while they're getting the prayer line lined up you all give me your undivided attention now you must listen to what I'm telling you I mean think about that this is important one time there was a woman Jesus was passing through the country and he crossed over the sea and he went into a place where there was a woman with a blood issue and all the priests and them come out and they were making fun of him and there's a bunch out there that believed him and he was going through the crowd and the woman said within her heart and I listen close are you listening say Amen right now the woman see and he says and he's told him give me your undivided attention listen and I watch what he says with this the everyone the prayer lines being made up he says on anything distracts from what you're doing I know it's a fragment it says now the woman see on anything distracts from what you're doing you see every person is a he stops says I'm not dealing with you as a body I'm not just dealing with the physical part someone comes out there and they got cancer well I'm not just dealing with the cancer I'm not just dealing with the physical part I'm not dealing with you as a body I'm dealing with you as a spirit a soul and that moving if I could amplify this based upon as I read this in different parts of it in other places where premises be still and he deals with this very issue something happens it distracts he says I'm dealing with you as a spirit and that movie you got your mind doing somewhere else and I'm trying to get a hold of that so here someone needs to be healed so what's he doing listen pay attention right Focus no I'm saying that's brother Brandon but if you could do the same that'd be great follow my finger I hope you're listening Under the Influence today hey he says he's saying listen Focus right here watch me pay attention and he's saying he says because if you let your mind wander you get your mind going somewhere else and this phrase that's what I'm trying to get a hold of did you catch that right we think we can just sit here and doodle right or write out all the professional sports teams we could think about try to figure out what we're gonna do with our fantasy salary cap or we could plan our week out we could plan our days we can do it and we can draw and that what's happened as long as we're here our soul is over there going moon this is good yeah loving this right and maybe that's not their proper Soul voice maybe it should be more this is wonderful my soul loves this bread I did our uh Garrison Keeler cigarette demon voice I think but that's what we're thinking in our minds is yeah you know what I'm here and my soul's gonna get it right because there's a way we use the scripture well I don't even know what to pray for but my spirit does and I and and we think somehow it's getting it but listen the word he says that's what I'm trying to get a hold of and if you think I'm just asserting this and reading it out of place I'm going to use some more things or just know I got something else lined up right he's trying to get a hold of your mind that's what he's trying to get a hold no pay attention listen he doesn't say think about whatever you want make him get tranquilize make your mind go blank I'm going to talk to your soul for a moment he's got to do with your mind first that's what I'm trying to get a hold of but all these things that distract so what is it I think I have the scripture here Psalms 107 verse 20. he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions where's the word where is it first penetrating what does the word first come up against if you're deaf you'll never hear it if we just put it that way but then what wrestles with the vocalization what wrestles with the stand to your feet what wrestles with the information the signals that's being sent it's your spirit that is first confronted with the word it is your mind it is your emotion it is your memory Jesus do you not understand is your heart hardened do you not remember the word is trying to get a hold of that mind first the church age book chapter two brother Branham writes and Paul said that that word come in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself I love how he phrases this like a flaming cutting sword it went to the consciences of men and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and said captives free I know listen I'm saying this very very respectful because I'm not I'm not trying to allude to anything but it's more if in my mind as I've tried to construct what is a weakness in our perception or how we actually perceive Divine Healing and prayer lines and the casting out of demons there's a way that we're purely looking at it from a physical standpoint that the minister speaking or laying on of hands or calling things out and we've seen the physical manifestation of healings or things taking place and we're looking at it in this sense of that's power over the cancer but brother Branham relays it this way like a flaming cutting sword the word went into the heart and the thinking and the mind of the man in there like a surgeon cut out diseases and broke chains and set the captive free and once they were free in their heart they could be free in their body that's how the word he sent his word and healed them if he sends his word and he heals you of cancer let me say this it first healed your mind healed your heart and got you in a position to believe I don't care if this is hereditary I don't care if my family members died from this it doesn't matter to me if I'm only given two months to live I believe that I can be healed and the word first sets the conscience of man right what is the conscience of man described here it's the heart the Inner Man the spirit it's that place that influences every part of our life I I want to reference it very quickly because I may need to skip some things here Brothers just look closely if I skip around but our attitude and our feeling our emotion it colors what we experience have you ever been sick and in pain and you go to do something that's supposed to be nice and you don't enjoy it at all why because you're the mood you're in the pain you're feeling there's things that you ate you smelt you witnessed you heard that because of your anxiety or depression or whatever you're going through that time maybe a loss of a loved one or whatever it is maybe years later you come across the same thing months later whatever it is and that whole experience has been colored by your mood your feeling your emotions it's because that that mind the conscience of man colors our lives is any Afflicted among you he says let them pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms in the sermon Christ knocking at the door I'm skipping a few things here so it's I don't know if it's just a couple slides a couple scriptures the sermon Christ knocking at the door in the discernment again Rochester he says I'm a stranger to you lady you're standing here for someone else and the lady is in a hospital been very sick cancer so the woman is standing here and she's there for somebody else now I realized I skipped over some very important principles but whatever's happened to you in your life is in there somewhere whatever you've been through whatever experienced your brain has logged it memories reason affection experience because Jesus actually wanted to go back in their minds and kind of bring it up let's go back to this what happened think about it right because it's in there somewhere do you not remember is your heart hardened or now there's some sort of numbness what's going on now Jesus brother Brandon is he's Discerning this he says you're standing here for someone who's sick they're in the hospital doctors can do no more he says in your need of prayer too because you got a heavy heart now we know that that's just a phrase right right I mean it's not that we wait someone heart if we put it on a scale and go oh they've been through some stuff I mean their heart weighs 40 pounds right maybe they've been through some buffets I don't know but there's a way that you can look at it where someone who has it's it's the heaviness of spirit that if we could think literally now there's something being stored away something being deposited into our emotions our experience these things can be scars complexes Shadows why the Bible is I I skipped over the Bible says Every Man Has a chamber in his imagery chambers of his imagery and Ezekiel so there's actually Chambers they're not just channels that things pass through but they're storage places they're databases it's a place that things uh literal Chambers as the scripture says it and it's there that things get piled in and cause our vision problems because it becomes a heaviness it becomes a cloud it muddles our minds it confuses us why because all the input all the data all the Analytics that's why the analytics sometimes got to be careful with it because it's just going by what it knows what's been put in there the data it has available to it it doesn't actually know the outcome it's only speaking about probabilities and so in our minds we've got all sorts of things that's causing vision problems and here this woman has a heavy heart but God knows the secrets of the heart do you believe he can tell me what your heaviness is about it's because you want to have a baby he says because you want a baby and I see two Dark Shadows you've had two miscarriages in your life like in your time that's correct I know this that's a pretty maybe a heavy subject but do you realize what just took place there here's a woman who comes up in the prayer line for somebody else who has cancer and the spirit of God uncovers two Shadows that's in her heart she has a heavy heart there's a there's a heaviness in there do you want me God can tell you what the heaven says it's two Dark Shadows one for each miscarriage so what she had been through found a chamber in her spirit that brother Branham identifies as a dark shadow or two Dark Shadows and he relates it to two miscarriages now if we could take that and maybe make it applicable to all of us there's things we go through things we experience things we hear things we see things we do things that we have suffered and it becomes painful memories or Shadows within the chambers of our heart that hinder our faith and in doing so we'll hinder our expectation and this is done listen this is done not so that we would long for profit to be able to tell us how many Shadows we have but for us to be aware that God knows the deposits in your Chambers and God needs to and wants to address them he may not necessarily make sense of it he may not necessarily take a scar away or a complex away but he wants to address it to put it in its place or to heal it so that you can receive what you have need of there's so many things we go through that we can't seem to get over whether it be a mistake we've made in this instance there's a shadow that follows her of two miscarriages there's people that live under the condemnation because they've been taught that abortion is an unpardonable sin or they've been taught that this is an unpardonable sin that's an unpardonable sin and the devil builds them into a place of such a complex where that resides so deeply and so Heavenly in their religious mind and God may be identified in your own heart and your own Spirit today that that shadow is keeping you from accepting the love and forgiveness of God that Shadow's keeping you from your healing and he doesn't expose it to laugh at you and make fun of you he brings it up to liberate you he brings it up to say I know what you're going through I know the Shadow and if the light comes to expose the shadow it wants to shine in a way to chase it away I hope this is hitting home and the sermon the absolute again I wanted you to catch how brother Branham is talking about the word if I haven't framed this correctly God help me how the word deals with our vision first and our minds first last night we had a great prayer service and that's good that's fine laying hands upon the sick that's a good thing that's all it takes some time and there's some that there's something back there that they can't catch and you've got to get that person and find out what it that is now this is again the miracle of discernment there's something that's hindering them something laying in the way is this plain enough to where I could have just read this at the beginning we had already baptized and been at Rito's I apologize but this is as plain as it gets something laying in the way sometimes laying hands on the sick is enough but sometimes something lays in your way and he says in one little Shadow will vibrate it away now the library right away the healing one little Shadow we'll fight right away now the little lady in there a few moments ago she was so nervous so upset poor little fella she could even get her breath she was just in brother Brown's like he kind of begins to demonstrate gasping for breath and just carry it on now the thing you have to do here's just a little inside right but man's pulling back the curtain a little bit it's catching her spirit and then this is now again this is the dynamic on the prayer line but this is God's boundary of what the word is doing every time you sit and hear it he says and then you're he says you're catch it's catching your spirit and then you're projecting to her your very thought again I'm reading this to recognize that this is what the word wants to do change your thinking he says and you change your thinking then what does that then you could center her on Christ and from there she can go on but you've got to change her way of thinking in the way that he described it we're not going to try to figure out just exactly how he described it as he says at the end of this I think I have he says don't try to study it don't try to figure it out just believe it the goal is by some way to take whatever's missing in the person's Spirit or whatever is wrong he says to change her way of thinking she can't change it herself she's just running a whirl you've got to pick that up I literally saying you ought to change your way of thinking he says now there's a little something that gives you some he says don't try to study it don't do it just believe it and go on in other words let's recognize what the word is trying to do in that moment now I'm I'm very very close to closing I've got a couple more statements here but I'm and I'm going to be done let me try to summarize this though I think it's way too easy for us to discount how crucial the condition of our heart is to our healing it's way too easy to get so focused on the physical part that we're not realizing the damage that's being done in the mental part because we can get so focused on well I've had this problem I have that problem and we're worried about how bad the physical condition is getting and we're so worried about the physical part that's broken that we're actually inadvertently making it worse by the worry and the anxiety and the fear that the physical parts not being taken care of and meanwhile our spirit begins to starve I don't know if I'll preach it right here in this moment without give you the subtitle but one of the subjects we're going to be want to be talking about maybe it's going to want a Wednesday night is what's the saying is it uh feed the cold star of the flu which one is it starve the fever Okay Okay Google rewrite my notes no there's a saying out there that's like starve one feed the other but let me just put the starve your fear feed your faith whatever it is you're going through whatever it is you've got to starve the sickness starve the fear feed your faith there's something there that we begin to focus so much on the physical part oh I believe I can be healed I believe I can be healed I believe I can be healed oh I know this and we get chasing after the healing so much of the physical part we haven't stopped and said am I Afflicted am I happy am I a good place emotionally am I where I need to be spiritually is everything right in my spirit in my heart it is okay wonderful then I'm not going to panic about the physical part the word needs to build up your heart build up your emotions build up your mind it needs to give you courage and faith brother remember the sermon what hears thou Elijah brother Brown says if our heart condemn us not but if there's something in that life that condemns you again if you're thinking about this think about how he says somebody you they have something that's in the way a little vibration in your Shadow a little shattering Spirit can drive your healing away now he's using it this way he says there's something in your life that condemns you you better make that right I don't care what in the world you you just can't operate right make this in a much broader apply this more broadly than maybe a secret Center here today probably this more broadly than someone who's made a mistake or done something wrong that's sinful apply this in a much broader way you just can't operate right the Holy Spirit can't deal with you when you've got Prejudice come on somebody in selfishness and all those little things in you the Holy Spirit can never bless you you might get some intellectual emotions some work up let me just explain something to you now can you recognize I've run out of time to amplify this do you recognize what he just said how he just said that something Prejudice selfish or something in your spirit and the Holy Spirit can't bless you you might get emotional or get worked up but you're not getting the healing you need right it's not coming so he says let me explain it for instance when a woman gets married and she she's afraid she's not going to have a baby she won't have it but let her go and adopt a baby then she'll have one he said the books claim that that's nine out of ten will do that why it sets her body into the right emotion ask a doctor that doctor if that's not right why it puts her in the right attitude you're so worried and nervous about something happen what job feared It Came Upon him your fear actually in that sense has the ability to create or bring something your way or to manifest something and if you're all nervous and apprehensive about not being healed guess what somebody right you're probably not going to get healed because of your apprehension but if we could just relax ourselves and that's exactly what he's saying with respect to a woman who's wanting to have a baby her body gets set in the right emotion he says it puts her in the right attitude where did it take place not physically but emotionally in her mind it's shown us that our minds if you say our Spirits our emotions our eyesight our vision our hearts whatever you want to call it it's what rejects the word or filters out the word it's like that mind is that lens it's the corneus the very beginning layer of how that we view the word of God it's that the way that we look at the word he said if the heart's not right the emotions aren't right that we cannot receive the word properly that's what he told us about receiving the Holy Ghost to be born again that's what it's going to be to grow and mature in the word of God the condition of the Mind the mind your emotions your heart what he's showing us in this it must be said on the word by the word or it hinders the effect of the word the right attitude is looking at the word the right way and so the first thing the word wants to do is catch your mind and focus it now this is a lengthy statement in the sermon in life I I went I was upon I was gonna maybe at one point not have this in there but I think it's just too important um to have this whole this whole statement in the sermon life you all still here I'm glad we're having a baptism you're all sticking around for the baptism you're loved Chase they've all they're all staying for you in the sermon life brother bear says and and this there's a lot here but just kind of follow the theme what we call life now is only a shadow or a negative we all like to Rejoice but we can Rejoice over the right thing that shows that we've hooked up with the real thing when we Rejoice over the right thing though we Rejoice over the wrong thing then it shows we're hooked up with the wrong thing and that's maybe principle number one so our live can tell right now what we are which way our emotions are running you are who you are by your emotions we can tell right now what we are in life by how your emotions are running that's why when we are sad how are you doing we're saying I'm sad when we're frustrated we say we're frustrated it doesn't mean your name is frustrated it means you are frustrated and it's all because your emotions he says if we're rejoicing over the world and evil things our minds and our souls are inspired by below Boogie Woogie dances heartaches drinking all these other things that we run after it's from below but notice what we are is our emotions are running this is a generalization for one to examine themselves what do I tend to be in the aggregate am I doing all these other things that tells you what you are not the moments of clarity when you finally make it to church and you're feeling good about yourself but what are you he's saying it's your emotions now Nick slotty says but if we rejoice in the spirit that we have eternal life and we raise our emotions to God and praise him then we have joy then we have joy Jesus said that your Joys might be fooled but not full of the perverted life but full of the eternal life above and that's so that's a those first few slides to me present to you a thought on two kinds of life and then brings he starts taking our emotions and he's carving out the emotional part so in the next slide says so you can see it depends on what you look at now just for instance for the psychology part of it psychiatric are we all getting nervous now now let's notice just a moment this psychic View here's the picture of Christ and here's an electric fan now we're just going to have to imagine it right a picture of Christ and I guess I could have demonstrated this but a picture of Christ and an electric fan it depends on which one I look at are you catching the visual Christ something else and he's talking about your emotions but now you want to get into the psychiatric view of it he says if my emotion is moved this way or emotions is moved that way if I look at that and long for that and desire that my motion is set towards the fan but if I look this way my motion my desire is set that way so what you're looking at has some impact upon your perception and what you're seeing what you're indicted what you're considering what you're thinking about so your emotions are moved by what you're looking at that's the reason Jesus said whosoever look upon a woman to lust after half committed adultery with her already in his heart it's where your emotions are set where your thoughts are that's where where your emotions are set where your thoughts are that's what you're looking at as he says it's where your emotions are set where your thoughts are it's all based upon what you're looking at now the next slice is then we can Rejoice on because that we are the children of the promise on the great Eternal Church of God whose Christ's own promise I can't feel that's right the world thinks we're crazy oh this is life we'll be right in their way I am this day to see a lady now he's changed but this is to deal with the emotional part of The View I am this day to deal with the lady who went to a psychiatrist she's 35 years old never smoked never drank in all her life very fine girl her people were Christians are Christians her father is a doctor and she gave her life to Christ in early stage and what did she do she goes out and finally gets to a place to a college where she was teaching and a psychiatrist there he sat down to talk to her and he said you mean to tell me you've never kissed a boy she said not one time in all my life and he said you mean you've never had a little drink and been in a party never he said girl you don't know what you're missing catch this now him being a psychiatrist he swung the girl's mind until now she's become so evil and so bad because she don't even want to hear the name of Jesus spoke in her presence what did that nasty psychiatrist do he was messing with her mind he swung her mind right and we say that's what the psychiatrist does that's what the world does is it manipulates your mind and swings your mind and that's how the world achieves its results he says and even her father mother can't even see her no more and she's lost her mind and this next week will go to an institution for shock treatment it's because that she turned her thoughts from Christ under what that psychiatrist was moving was a move in her mind now leave it there now take it all in the aggregate two kinds of Life emotion and the whoopee and the Boogie Woogie and all that and what your emotions are set on he says now let's take the psychiatric view of this we can have the emotions that are hooked into the right thing emotions hooked on the wrong thing he says what's determining that what you look at is what derives your emotions from and you start getting your emotions built up and he says you can have your emotions on the wrong thing you can have your emotions on the right thing I can look at a fan and my emotions can be projected towards that or my eyesight to that he says or I could look on this other side of things and begin to look at Christ and he's trying to draw this comparison and he says now I had a scenario where I'm going to see a young lady whose mind has been swung from the things of Christ to the things of the world and she's gotten so evil and he says it's all because she turned her thoughts from Christ to the things of the world and the psychiatrist swung her mind now pay attention to the next statement and that is what we are here for this morning is to move your mind and your thinking from the things of the world until the things of God which are eternal which is eternally did we read that right I'm here this morning to move your mind and to move your thinking listen when I'm preaching the word I can't do anything to your soul the the preaching of the word in this this Dynamic of preaching the word of God I'm not up here with this thought process that man if I can just get past their bullheadedness and their stubbornness and their tiredness and I even though they're sleeping if I could just say it the right way it'll get in there some way and and it's all going to make a difference somehow no listen the reason why I agonize Time After Time and pray and study and strive to be sure that I'm finding the mind of God is because it's so important that I don't get in the way and it's so important that the word is preached and it's Clarity and it's faithful to the message of the hour and it engages you as a person to hear the word of God to change your thinking and to swing your mind from all the things that this world has because listen I realize the world has got your attention I'm not saying it's your attraction I know it's your distraction the world has got your attention and there's so much Tick Tock in so much movies and programs and sensationalisms and there's so many ways that we're sensitized it's it's impossible in a carnal way for church to compete with what the world can give you but if I can get myself out of the way and God by his grace can get you within the sound of my voice if I can yield maybe I could say something that gets your attention like whoa wait a minute where did that come from I preached a youth camp recently and there's a dozen guys or so who rented an Airbnb they showed up at the youth camp and after I think it was the first or second service they went home they said guys brother Aaron's on to us he he knows what's going on he knows what's up he's in our Snapchats whatever's going on this just got serious I said well how did that happen well guess what I'm not 21 years old just to correct the any air there and and I'm not in my mind I I don't experience certain things but there's a discernment that comes when you get serious before God and there's a way that the word can go forth where there's times you say things you don't even know what you're talking about like well I just read that for this I didn't realize that part was in it why because God didn't get your attention and we might think well it's just if you're a luck seed it's going to get in there somehow yeah absolutely but how is it going to happen you may have an ordained Lexi down in your soul and I can't be so stubborn and legalistic and bullheaded and think I could just as long as I'm just yelling something that brother Adam said it's gonna happen no you've got to swing their mind you've got to change their thinking they're looking at this they're looking at this oh God let the word today if it doesn't happen today may you at least be aware that what God is wanting to do is correct your vision [Applause] swing your mind to the things of God that's what we're here for this morning to move your thinking to move your mind next slide that's what preaching is for he says pervert but maybe we can say it's to revert to pervert to pervert the thinking to a higher and better into a place where Christ is until you become converted then your mind reaches for those things which are above how could we ever be in the place we're just going to beat people up who are in the wrong state of mind you're not reaching for the right things you're not reaching for the right things you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong without telling them what's right and tell me what the word's been trying to do is swing your mind to the things of God so you can get to the place to where you're converted and then you can reach for the things which are above there's a way if I can say it doesn't matter how you're raised what religion what denomination what organization especially if you've been raising the message there's a lot of memory you have here of the way you think things should be done and if we're not careful what we do is we just grab a hold of what's being preached in that Realm and we stay in that frame of mind instead of opening up to be converted let me say this as I close if we could just at least do this on this subject of vision correction just establish in your heart right now that the word first and primarily first and foremost wants to heal your take your heart and get it right it doesn't say that if you heard the word just be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and call yourself saved it has to be a change of heart a change of mind if I could say it this way if our soul is right then primarily we just want our Spirits right that you I know you may take exception of this and I'm not discounting physical pain I'm not discounting sickness I'm not discounting cancers whether it be actual eye problems or heart problems or back problems or digestive problems I'm not discounting it at all but right now if I could be a spiritual chiropractor for a second if I could be what's the head and what are the Sinners where they focus everything back here they can just get that part of line they say everything else will fix itself whatever Meridian you're on today however you want to look at this listen to me this will help you right here if your soul is Right primarily what you want is your heart to be right okay if your soul is right what matters the most is that your heart is right because the new body will come it's coming don't have to worry about that if your soul is right what you want is your character to be right your heart to be right your spirit to be right you want your attitude to be right you want to be positive you want to be critical you want to be crabby you want to be expected you want to be kind you want to be a servant you want to be humble if your heart soul is right you want your heart to be right because listen the new body's coming the healing's coming the pain will go away the back will straighten up the pounds will be shed the hair will come back whatever it is one day the body will be right but why I'm here I want my attitude to be right I want my heart to be right I guarantee you after Vision Correction the healing will come if we could focus on the part that matters and get your right attitude the healing will come praise the Lord amen musicians please come we'll transition out to our baptismal service I know that may kind of leave you hanging a little bit I know we often worship but I think we just came right to a head today right to a spot we could just take God at his word and believe him that all things are possible
