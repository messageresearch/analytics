[0:00] this is part two of The Labyrinth and if
[0:04] you have any questions about where we're
[0:06] drawing this from you could go back uh
[0:08] to Wednesday night's service and we gave
[0:11] a lot of background to the concept of
[0:13] the labyrinth we are drawing it from uh
[0:17] the reference that brother Brandon makes
[0:19] and um the source of that when he refers
[0:21] to the labyrinth in the church age book
[0:23] which in the kind of the source and the
[0:26] mythology that it was brought from is
[0:28] this lath was a confusing structure it
[0:31] was made intentionally to be confusing
[0:34] and in the mythology it was cunningly
[0:36] made it was made to deceive and it was
[0:39] made in such a way that once one was in
[0:41] it they would be caused to wander around
[0:44] and ultimately it would be punishment on
[0:46] death for one to be cast into this
[0:47] Labyrinth so it was a prison a prison
[0:49] house and it was intentionally meant to
[0:52] be confusing and so we're using this
[0:54] concept of the labyrinth as brother
[0:55] brandham did and so if you have some
[0:58] things that you want more background on
[1:00] or you try to wonder wondering where it
[1:01] came from feel free to ask me questions
[1:03] but Wednesday night service covered it
[1:05] quite a bit especially the source
[1:07] material that brother brandham used and
[1:09] we're taking it from chapter 7 of the
[1:11] church age book where brother brandham
[1:12] beginning in page 254 at that last
[1:15] paragraph he refers to John uh cominius
[1:18] and the one thing needful as he says it
[1:20] or Unum necessarium was published in
[1:23] 1668 right at the end of comenius his
[1:26] life and so we're going to that's where
[1:28] we we're drawing it from and studying
[1:30] from and so this is the larger statement
[1:33] that brother Brandon makes and this is
[1:36] really where I'm beginning I'm drawing
[1:38] so much from this paragraph here that
[1:40] I'd like just to expand and then come
[1:41] right back to this place of the church
[1:42] age book and So speaking of the sardy
[1:45] and age he said if there ever was a a
[1:47] time of denominational Zeal it was at
[1:50] this tragic time when he says
[1:52] denominational Zeal he's not just
[1:54] referring to one denomination but the
[1:56] the multiple denominations and thoughts
[1:58] that would have existed and how each one
[2:01] uh had a great Zeal and he calls it a
[2:03] tragic time the words of commius
[2:06] describe much of this era cominius wrote
[2:08] the one thing needful and so this would
[2:11] be a writing which has given us great
[2:14] insight into the thought at the time he
[2:17] compares the world to the Labyrinth and
[2:19] when he says the Labyrinth it's
[2:20] referring specifically to that one in
[2:23] the Greek mythology that minus the king
[2:25] had made to cast that Minotaur into uh
[2:28] for that punishment he compares the
[2:30] world to the Labyrinth and shows that
[2:32] the way out is by leaving what is
[2:34] needless and choosing the one thing
[2:37] needful Christ so when he says that one
[2:40] uh one thing needful and then it says he
[2:43] compares the world to the Labyrinth and
[2:45] shows the way out is by leaving what is
[2:48] needless and choosing the one thing
[2:50] needful Christ the needless versus the
[2:55] necessary the needless versus the
[2:57] needful the unnecessary that's quite a
[2:59] statement when you think about uh all
[3:01] the things in our lives that are really
[3:03] unnecessary
[3:05] and there there's reading a book about
[3:08] um someone who did a hike through in the
[3:09] Grand Canyon and one of the experts at
[3:12] the time or very knowledgeable told
[3:14] these these guys were going to sat on
[3:15] this uh complete hike through said this
[3:18] is what you're going to find out are
[3:19] you're going to find out the things you
[3:20] need and the things you want and uh and
[3:23] he thought maybe he was just referring
[3:24] to how heavy their packs were but when
[3:26] he came to the place where he thought he
[3:27] was going to die he said he realized the
[3:30] difference between the things you need
[3:31] and the things you want you may want to
[3:34] finish this hike but you need to stop or
[3:36] you're going to die and there's really
[3:38] so much in that thought of what things
[3:40] are necessary what things do we want
[3:41] what things do we desire he says you got
[3:43] to leave what is needless and choose the
[3:46] one thing needful Christ that's quite a
[3:48] statement then brother brandom drawing
[3:51] from that says the great number of
[3:52] teachers he says is the reason of the
[3:54] multitude of sex for which we should
[3:57] soon have no names left now there's
[3:59] going to run out of names for all these
[4:00] religions and all these denominations
[4:02] each church so now it's a church and
[4:04] we're talking about Christianity says
[4:06] each Church reckons itself as the true
[4:08] one or at least as the purest truest
[4:10] part of it while among themselves they
[4:13] persecute each other with the bitterest
[4:16] hatred no reconciliation is to be hoped
[4:18] for between them they meet enmity with
[4:21] ir irreconcilable
[4:24] enity out of the Bible they forg their
[4:27] different Creeds these are their
[4:28] fortresses and bullworks behind which
[4:31] they entrench themselves and resist all
[4:33] attacks what's amazing is the way that
[4:35] it's described here about their Fortress
[4:37] and bull works it actually what they
[4:40] think to be a a safe place has become a
[4:43] labyrinth through the bullworks and the
[4:45] Fortress and he says they from there
[4:47] they entrench themselves and resist all
[4:49] attacks he says I will not say that
[4:51] these confessions of faith for we can't
[4:54] admit in most cases that they are so are
[4:56] bad in themselves so he's he's not
[5:00] wanting just to say that the confession
[5:02] of faith is bad in itself but then he
[5:04] says they become so however in that they
[5:07] feed the fire of
[5:09] enmity think about how that we could
[5:11] have these peculiar confessions of Faith
[5:14] these certain platitudes or platforms or
[5:16] ideology or uh convictions that we might
[5:19] have and they wouldn't necessarily be
[5:22] bad but they feed the fire of enmity
[5:24] against those who don't share the same
[5:26] one and it causes us to entrench
[5:28] ourselves in these things and we
[5:30] persecute those with the bitterest
[5:32] hatred that don't agree with us and so
[5:35] it becomes uh irreversible
[5:38] irreconcilable he says only by putting
[5:40] them away alt together would it be
[5:42] possible to set to work on healing the
[5:45] wounds of the
[5:47] church it's quite a quite a statement
[5:50] that we could really Ponder on for quite
[5:52] some time but what I would like to say
[5:54] just to open it up to where we are today
[5:56] if this is
[5:58] true of Christ Christianity if this is
[6:01] what the church had become then what of
[6:04] the individual what of the home life
[6:06] what of
[6:07] society that if this is where the the
[6:10] there there should be the purest and
[6:12] truest uh uh form of religion if this is
[6:14] where Christ is supposed to be and it's
[6:17] become this fortresses and bull works
[6:19] and persecution and hatred then what
[6:22] what about those uh the family what
[6:25] about the the
[6:27] world I was fellowshipping with brother
[6:29] Jonathan larga he's a pastor in Croatia
[6:31] a good friend of mine and I just was
[6:34] fellowshipping yes with him yesterday
[6:36] and asked him what he was ministering on
[6:37] today and he said the three
[6:40] delinquencies and and his thought was
[6:42] being brought out of the message where
[6:43] brother B talked about child delinquency
[6:45] and parental delinquency and then how
[6:47] brother bradam says it's Pulpit
[6:49] delinquency and he shared it it just was
[6:52] beautiful the way he shared it with me
[6:53] how that once you have church
[6:55] delinquency it leads to parental
[6:57] delinquency which then leads to child
[6:59] Del quency and then we put it all in the
[7:01] child and we want to punish the child
[7:02] but really brother Brandon was showing
[7:04] us that you kind of back work backwards
[7:06] and go back to the weak pulpits and if
[7:08] you think of that if the church is
[7:10] delinquent and therefore then the home
[7:12] is delinquent and then the children are
[7:14] delinquent family church and then
[7:16] Society becomes full of
[7:19] delinquents and we're in this time of
[7:21] Satan's Eden and the and this evil age
[7:24] wherein the world is full of delinquents
[7:27] and a delinquent is one who fails to
[7:29] perform a Duty or to discharge an
[7:32] obligation so as soon as the church
[7:34] failed to discharge of its Duty it made
[7:36] it harder for the family to discharge
[7:38] its Duty and it made it harder for the
[7:40] children to discharge their Duty and so
[7:42] there is a failure on all parts and it
[7:44] causes Society to break
[7:47] down and and what I'm the reason why I
[7:51] mentioned this is in those three
[7:54] delinquencies as he was putting it it
[7:56] really resonated with me to see how that
[7:59] were we're looking at one thing
[8:01] necessary one thing needful going all
[8:03] the way back to the beginning where man
[8:05] failed to keep his duty and in failing
[8:07] to keep his duty it brought all the sin
[8:09] and death that is in the world today and
[8:12] that if there is as the Bible would tell
[8:14] us one thing that is necessary one thing
[8:16] that is needful then there is this
[8:19] singleness of Duty there are a lot of
[8:21] unnecessary things and one thing that is
[8:24] necessary and if you put it in that
[8:26] light you might say well don't we need
[8:27] to sleep and don't we need to eat and
[8:28] don't need we need to wear clothes but
[8:30] it's what's the one thing you cannot do
[8:33] without what's the one thing that you
[8:35] must have and we would say above all I
[8:38] must have Christ so there is a a
[8:40] singleness of devotion and Duty that we
[8:43] can observe in order to escape this
[8:46] Labyrinth as brother bram's pointing us
[8:48] to we're drawing it from 2 Corinthians
[8:51] Chap
[8:55] 11:3 and Paul says but I fear less by
[8:57] any means as a serpent beg galed eeve
[8:59] through his subtlety so your mind should
[9:01] be corrupted from the Simplicity that is
[9:04] in
[9:05] Christ as brother bradam says the one
[9:08] thing needful Christ as he's bringing
[9:09] that out of camus's work Christ is the
[9:12] one thing needful so Paul is saying I I
[9:16] I fear that by some means by any means
[9:19] the as the serpent beguiled Eve so
[9:21] there's this uh thinking back to the
[9:24] temptation of the woman and then the
[9:27] present condition of the church at that
[9:29] time
[9:29] that in the same manner in which the Eve
[9:31] was deceived I I fear that your minds
[9:34] would be corrupted from the Simplicity
[9:37] that is in Christ so let's grapple with
[9:40] this
[9:41] scripture and in doing so it understand
[9:44] its clear meaning and maybe even a
[9:45] deeper meaning for ourselves
[9:47] personally as the serpent beguiled e
[9:50] through his subtlety now also remember
[9:53] that The Temptations in the garden uh
[9:55] correspond to The Temptations of Christ
[9:57] in the wilderness what we see is the
[9:59] singular temptation of the woman becomes
[10:01] a three-fold temptation to Christ and in
[10:04] God's Paradise man and woman we know
[10:07] they had eternal life and some of this
[10:10] just kind of review some of the things
[10:11] we said on Sunday or excuse me Wednesday
[10:13] night uh but they had eternal life it
[10:15] was real living it's not life as we know
[10:18] it now and say oh this is life and this
[10:20] is living and oh this is the good life
[10:22] and there's a lot of ways that we talk
[10:23] about life uh but then David says thy
[10:26] love and kindness is better than life
[10:28] and we realize that this life is not the
[10:30] purest life or the greatest life but
[10:33] they had real life and they had a there
[10:36] was a fruitful labor that every day had
[10:39] purpose and meaning there was a great
[10:41] satisfaction uh uh at the end of the day
[10:44] and so their labor their work was
[10:46] satisfying the their their pleasure that
[10:49] they engaged in was satisfying in other
[10:51] words it was always
[10:52] enough that when they labored they were
[10:55] happy with whatever their work product
[10:57] was when they sought pleasures they were
[10:59] that satisfied it didn't leave them
[11:02] wanting uh their minds were clear they
[11:04] had a clear understanding they had pure
[11:07] enjoyment they all they had was good so
[11:10] if they ate it was good how did you like
[11:13] that it was good how was the walk it was
[11:16] good everything was good and it was uhh
[11:19] it was perfect and through the fall It
[11:22] produced that three-fold unhappiness
[11:25] where's that there's that frustration of
[11:28] thought of the frustration of action
[11:30] where there's no joy when you get out of
[11:32] your actions frustration of thought is
[11:33] where you don't think correctly the CL
[11:35] the channels have become clogged so
[11:37] men's thought process has become
[11:39] frustrated and then when he acts there's
[11:42] a frustration of Labor and action where
[11:44] he doesn't get the joy out of it that he
[11:46] would like to get so he convinces
[11:48] himself he got it anyways and then
[11:50] there's the frustration of Desire where
[11:53] there's no satiety where I'm never being
[11:56] satisfied that I I I have desire and it
[11:59] can never be quenched I want to I want
[12:02] to do this in order to say I've done it
[12:05] and put it to rest but but there has
[12:07] been this frustration of thinking acting
[12:11] and Desiring that man has existed in
[12:14] ever since the
[12:15] fall as we're putting it this way
[12:17] mankind was thrust into this Labyrinth
[12:20] alienated from God and then we come to
[12:23] the Bible in Ecclesiastes where Solomon
[12:25] begins to observe that life is confusing
[12:27] life is full of Labor and all you get
[12:29] out of life I is is Strife a a and it's
[12:32] full of grief and trouble he writes in
[12:35] the beginning in Ecclesiastes 1:8 All
[12:37] Things Are full of Labor man cannot
[12:39] utter it the eye is not satisfied with
[12:41] seeing nor the ear filled with hearing
[12:44] that's the nature of man's frustration
[12:46] of Desire then he says all the labor of
[12:48] man is for his mouth and yet the
[12:50] appetite is not filled Ecclesiastes 67
[12:53] labor does not satisfy man's thoughts
[12:56] are wrong man's actions don't produce
[12:58] the fruits they'd want it to and then
[12:59] man's desire is always wanting it's the
[13:03] complete
[13:04] opposite of what man found in the
[13:07] beginning comenius at the very beginning
[13:09] of his work Unum necessarium includes a
[13:12] qu a quote from Plato all kinds of
[13:14] knowledge if knowledge of the best is
[13:17] lacking hinder rather than help him who
[13:20] has them that man having left the
[13:23] paradise of God having lost his
[13:25] connection with God could have all sorts
[13:27] of knowledge but with without the
[13:29] knowledge of what is best without the
[13:32] knowledge of God it has hindered him
[13:34] rather than helped him with all his
[13:37] accomplishments and how scientific he's
[13:39] become and how much he's been able to do
[13:41] he's only gotten further away from God
[13:44] trying to remedy The Human Condition
[13:46] he's only heaped upon himself even more
[13:48] problems and we could say oh man they're
[13:51] finding out today that this is a big
[13:52] huge issue and in our minds we might
[13:54] think oh they've missed it all these
[13:56] years but really A lot of them are
[13:58] modern issues
[13:59] brought upon by modern
[14:03] inventions in Psalms
[14:05] 107: 10 11 and 12 such as sit in
[14:08] darkness and in the shadow of death
[14:10] being bound in Affliction and
[14:13] iron this describes
[14:16] Humanity because they rebelled against
[14:19] the words of God and contemned the
[14:20] counsel of the most high this phrase is
[14:24] appropriate of even the man and the
[14:26] woman in the beginning therefore he
[14:28] brought down their heart with labor they
[14:30] fell down and there was none to
[14:32] help man is in this Darkness under the
[14:36] shadow of death Bound in Affliction and
[14:38] iron it's not literal iron necessarily
[14:40] but it is Affliction through a rebellion
[14:43] against God's word we've been brought
[14:45] down with labor there we cannot escape
[14:49] this as we read Proverbs 21:16 on
[14:53] Wednesday the man that Werth out of the
[14:55] way of understanding shall remain in the
[14:57] congregation of the the
[14:59] dead as soon as mankind left the way of
[15:02] God and rebelled against his clear uh
[15:05] commandment and clear prohibition man
[15:08] wandered out of the way of understanding
[15:10] supposing that he would gain more
[15:12] understanding and entered into the
[15:14] congregation of the dead man having
[15:16] lived entered into death by sin cannot
[15:19] escape death through sin and having
[15:21] entered into it through misunder
[15:23] understanding cannot Escape it without
[15:25] coming back to the way of understanding
[15:28] righten it was democrates that said the
[15:30] cause of sinning is ignorance of what is
[15:32] better what a statement that we only sin
[15:35] when we are ignorant of what is better
[15:38] if it's presented as a good or evil if
[15:39] it's an either or if it's should I or
[15:41] shouldn't I we only sin when we are
[15:43] truly ignorant or choose to be ignorant
[15:45] of that which is better that's right and
[15:49] we know that the woman as we're taught
[15:50] in the message that veil of lust blinded
[15:52] the woman to God's clear Commandment
[15:54] that thou shalt not it blinded her to
[15:57] the the Commandment of thou shall and
[15:59] thou shalt not the prohibition of Thou
[16:01] shalt not God said don't he meant don't
[16:06] but the serpent confused the woman on
[16:08] God's
[16:10] promise he he he brings it up hasn't God
[16:13] said and she's right and saying God said
[16:16] that we shall not eat
[16:18] it and and he said but because if we eat
[16:22] it the day we eat that day we die and
[16:25] and
[16:26] Satan doesn't say he did say to eat it
[16:30] he just says God knows the day you eat
[16:34] that day you'll become as God's knowing
[16:36] good and
[16:37] evil that you you're you're you're not
[16:40] actually going to die you will not die
[16:42] but you'll actually have more life
[16:44] you'll have more
[16:46] understanding and the Bible does not
[16:48] contradict Satan's proposition because
[16:51] when they ate their eyes were
[16:53] open and in that way they became more
[16:56] like
[16:57] God but they also became more like Satan
[17:00] or became like Satan in Disobedience and
[17:03] there's that hybrid nature that hybrid
[17:05] mixture that even comes up in the man
[17:07] and the woman and we can see that this
[17:09] woman being blinded by
[17:12] lust wanders away from life into death
[17:17] because of the promise of
[17:20] knowledge and Paul is saying I
[17:23] fear lest by any means as the serpent
[17:26] beguiled Eve through his subtlety so
[17:29] your mind should be corrupted from the
[17:32] Simplicity that is in
[17:34] Christ this is an appropriate
[17:37] fear he knew how subtle Satan was he
[17:42] knew how he worked he knew his scheming
[17:44] and his plans and as the serpent
[17:46] beguiled Eve through his subtlety we
[17:49] ought to take that to heart and think
[17:50] about the weight of that what he means a
[17:53] as he has beguiled the woman I fear that
[17:56] your minds could be or should be
[17:58] corrupted for the Simplicity that is in
[18:01] Christ now man was given a duty in the
[18:04] beginning he was given a labor he was
[18:05] given a commandment he was told not to
[18:06] do things he wasn't asked to reason it
[18:09] out and figure out why he shouldn't do
[18:10] it but he was just told to stick to what
[18:12] he should do and believe God is to what
[18:14] he should not do and so when man's minds
[18:17] are when Paul brings man's Minds into
[18:19] this or our minds he's speaking of our
[18:22] thought or mental perception it's our
[18:25] understanding it's even our deliberation
[18:27] it's our thought process that your
[18:29] thinking your understanding your
[18:31] perception would be corrupted from the
[18:33] Simplicity that is in Christ what you
[18:35] perceive what you understand or what you
[18:37] think about the word comes from to think
[18:40] upon to heed to ponder or to consider
[18:43] Paul is saying that I fear that your
[18:45] minds or your contemplation your
[18:48] deliberation your ponderings what you
[18:51] heed what you think upon will be
[18:53] corrupted from
[18:55] Christ in Ecclesiastes 7:29 it says look
[18:58] this only have I found that God hath
[19:00] made man upright he made him originally
[19:03] to be upright to be simple but they have
[19:05] sought out many inventions they've mixed
[19:08] themselves with so many things they've
[19:09] sought out many other devices they've
[19:11] come up with ways to try to figure
[19:13] things out and so man was made to be
[19:16] simple but he has sought out many
[19:18] devices contemplations
[19:21] deliberations that our contemplation
[19:23] would be corrupted to be corrupted is to
[19:26] destroy by
[19:27] defiling and to a Jew it could be
[19:29] defiled or it could be destroyed if it's
[19:31] defiled in the slightest
[19:34] degree it wasn't necessary that the
[19:36] whole thing be torn down it wasn't
[19:37] necessary that it needed to be torched
[19:39] it just needed to be stained so Paul
[19:41] said I fear lest your thought process
[19:44] your contemplation your desires the
[19:46] things you Ponder would be defiled in
[19:48] the slightest degree that you'd be led
[19:50] away from knowledge that you'd be led
[19:51] away from the things that are pure and
[19:54] that you would
[19:56] perish so the simple here and I hope to
[19:59] expand on it more maybe in the future
[20:01] the simple implies this unmixed
[20:05] devotion where you don't have your
[20:07] loyalties to the world you don't have
[20:08] your loyalties to this you don't have
[20:10] your loyalties to that but you do have
[20:11] ultimate loyalty in undivided and
[20:14] unmixed Devotion to Christ it speaks of
[20:17] single-mindedness not double-mindedness
[20:19] single-mindedness to where you have
[20:21] clear thought and it's directed solely
[20:23] to
[20:25] Christ it's interesting to note too that
[20:28] this word Simplicity and the scriptures
[20:30] also translated to
[20:32] bountifulness liberality and
[20:35] Liberty in
[20:38] Christ the Simplicity the bountifulness
[20:41] the liberality the Liberty that we have
[20:43] in Christ this is what Paul is
[20:46] saying that he was examining and seeing
[20:49] this Antichrist Spirit work that Satan
[20:52] would try to corrupt your thoughts and
[20:54] your mind where the greatest battle is
[20:57] fought the place he chosen the the
[20:58] beginning that he would uh uh wage a war
[21:02] against us in the church and in the
[21:03] bride to cause our thoughts and our
[21:06] contemplation to be defiled in the
[21:08] slightest degree and thereby leading us
[21:11] into stray thought patterns and actions
[21:13] which do not satisfy or
[21:15] fulfill the Simplicity it's a very rich
[21:19] word in
[21:22] Christ so let me say this and my sermon
[21:24] today is uh I'm I'm having to use a lot
[21:27] of Runway to get to it but it's very
[21:29] simple I guess it should be if you're
[21:31] using Simplicity as part of your
[21:33] foundation but what we need is in
[21:37] Christ what Satan is trying to keep us
[21:40] from is in
[21:41] Christ what we need is in Christ I I
[21:45] wouldn't be I don't mean this to be
[21:47] dismissive uh or overs simplistic but in
[21:50] reality I could say this was absolute
[21:52] Assurance no matter what you're going
[21:53] through in life right now What You Need
[21:55] Is
[21:56] Christ that there there's some thing
[21:59] about Christ that is gives us
[22:02] self-sufficiency that in him we are
[22:04] self-sufficient that all we have need of
[22:07] is in him and say well what if I need my
[22:08] boss to give me a raise well I would
[22:10] think that Christ is the good place to
[22:12] start with that what if I need uh what
[22:14] if I've got this sickness what if I need
[22:15] to lose weight what if I need this
[22:17] Christ Christ is the answer Christ can
[22:20] harmonize thought Christ can harmonized
[22:23] body Christ can give you wisdom on the
[22:25] right ways to approach things Christ is
[22:28] the the answer it's only when man left
[22:31] Christ that we begin to undo
[22:34] ourselves what's amazing is man is
[22:36] accomplish more having let go of his
[22:38] faith in Christ than he has in centuries
[22:40] prior all because he's put Faith in
[22:42] himself and he's been able to cause
[22:44] himself to think oh my aren't we great
[22:46] aren't we Grand look we can produce look
[22:48] we can manufacture whether you want to
[22:50] look at it in a a church sense or in a
[22:52] scientific sense man let loose of his
[22:54] faith in God and went from a horse and
[22:56] buggy to a rocket ship to the Moon in
[22:58] less than a hundred
[23:01] years because what we need is Christ and
[23:04] if we leave the one thing needful all we
[23:07] have left is everything that's truly
[23:10] unnecessary like going to the
[23:14] moon and some may say well we're just
[23:16] doing this because mankind is going to
[23:18] have to have a place to live in a
[23:20] thousand years only because
[23:23] man right is going to do that to the
[23:26] Earth
[23:29] and I would maybe argue that the oceans
[23:31] might be a better place to go so you
[23:32] might want to start buying real estate
[23:34] at the bottom of the ocean I'll sell
[23:36] some to you I got
[23:39] certificates what we need isn't Christ
[23:42] what Satan wants to keep us from is
[23:45] Christ and I don't I don't mind if I run
[23:48] the risk of sounding Baptist or nominal
[23:50] or denominational I I will not be
[23:52] ashamed to say that Christ is all we
[23:54] need no shame in it our Salvation is
[23:58] through Jesus Christ and him alone that
[24:01] Christ is truly all we need in John
[24:04] 10:10 Jesus says the thief cometh not
[24:07] but for to steal and to kill and to
[24:09] destroy that's what the thief comes to
[24:12] do steal kill and
[24:14] destroy I am come that they might have
[24:17] life and that they might have it more
[24:21] abundantly to say that we might have
[24:23] life certainly contrast
[24:26] death that we might have life but then
[24:28] he says and they might have it more
[24:30] abundantly how can I have more life if I
[24:33] have life how can I have more life but
[24:35] he's saying that we might have life and
[24:37] that life is more abundant and
[24:39] fulfilling than the life that we now
[24:41] live in the flesh the life that we have
[24:43] received from our parents that uh uh and
[24:45] that we walk through life in trying to
[24:47] explore boundaries and we're trying to
[24:49] figure out who we are and come under our
[24:51] identity and and making use of resources
[24:54] and opportunities whatever it might be
[24:56] no matter how satisfied we could be in
[24:58] this life by merely living from natural
[25:01] life and making use of Natural Things in
[25:04] Christ we can have a more Abundant Life
[25:07] we can have true life in something more
[25:09] abundant and fulfilling am and never
[25:12] even leave this
[25:14] earth even continuing to do the things
[25:17] you did before it's not that when you
[25:19] come to Christ you immediately stop
[25:20] eating and drinking and sleeping and you
[25:22] just stay awake all the time blessing
[25:24] people but you will continue to do many
[25:27] of the same things you have always done
[25:29] but life has deeper meaning there's a
[25:30] connection to something Beyond yourself
[25:32] it's real living and it doesn't mean
[25:35] it's not without its difficulties and
[25:37] Sorrows but Christ said that in him we
[25:41] could have life more
[25:44] abundantly the Bible says in 1 Timothy
[25:46] 5: 5 and 6 now she that is a widow
[25:49] indeed and desolate trusteth in God and
[25:52] continueth in supplications and prayers
[25:54] night and
[25:55] day it could be said this is what I
[25:58] Widow ought to be this is why Paul
[26:01] commands the single and the widowed in a
[26:05] certain way because of what their their
[26:06] proclivity might be or what they might
[26:08] be tempted to do so a widow ought to
[26:10] trust in God and continue in prayer and
[26:13] supplication night and day and it's
[26:16] immediately contrasted but she that
[26:18] liveth in pleasure is dead while she
[26:22] liveth one that does not live trusting
[26:25] in God one that lives according to the
[26:27] flesh we can say that this does describe
[26:30] what brought Humanity into the the sin
[26:32] and darkness that it knows now that the
[26:34] woman when she eateth she wiped her
[26:36] mouth and said I've done no wrong she is
[26:38] dead living in
[26:40] pleasure she that lives in pleasure is
[26:43] dead while she liveth so those that live
[26:45] in sin are dead we being dead in our
[26:49] sins and trespasses so Christ says that
[26:51] he's come that we might have life that
[26:54] we might be quickened from the dead that
[26:56] life where we don't immediately exit the
[26:58] Earth upon our new birth but rather we
[27:00] we enter into the body of Christ and we
[27:02] now are no longer dead but alive and we
[27:05] can have life more
[27:07] abundantly so he admonishes Us in
[27:09] Matthew 11: 28 29 and 30 come unto me
[27:13] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[27:16] this speaks to all mankind he could have
[27:19] just said come unto me all
[27:21] ye because all mankind labors and is
[27:25] heavy laden we're heavy laden with sins
[27:27] we labor under the chain of carnality
[27:30] and the chains of human thought we are
[27:32] thrust into the labyrinth in this prison
[27:34] of Darkness because we rebelled against
[27:36] the word of God we've we've our heart
[27:38] has been brought down with labor we're
[27:40] Bound in Affliction and iron as it were
[27:43] so he says come you that labor and are
[27:45] heavy laden and I will give you
[27:48] rest I'll cause you to cease from that
[27:51] labor I'll cause you to cease from that
[27:52] heavy
[27:53] burden I'll relieve you of the strain of
[27:57] Desire come under me all you that labor
[27:59] and are heavy laden and I will give you
[28:01] rest I will relieve you of the
[28:02] frustration of thought I'll relieve you
[28:06] from the frustration of action I will
[28:08] relieve you from the frustration of
[28:09] desire it is only when Christ is not the
[28:12] center when we find that our desires
[28:14] become that Dynamo and that dopamine
[28:16] cycle we enter into and we find
[28:18] ourselves unable to resist because we
[28:20] are no longer finding Rest In Christ the
[28:24] end of the day when we want to have our
[28:26] Escape or get our rest we don't come to
[28:28] Christ or the things that God has given
[28:29] us we find that the world has provided
[28:32] us an escape to just kind of relax and
[28:36] just letting off the steam I've had a
[28:38] long day of work honey just let me relax
[28:40] and let off the
[28:42] Steam
[28:44] and I guess I could get real specific
[28:47] right
[28:47] now but I think maybe it'd be good for
[28:50] us just to think in ourselves the things
[28:52] that we do for recreation and
[28:55] rest and it never quite satisfied
[28:59] because you're you're a Son of God
[29:01] you're a
[29:02] sheep and Christ is your rest so he'll
[29:06] give you rest to a point he'll give you
[29:08] Recreation to a point but if you ever
[29:10] leave the one thing needful there's a
[29:12] law of diminishing returns we say you
[29:13] got to come back to me I'm not saying
[29:15] you can't go fishing I'm not saying you
[29:16] can't do this but if you leave me you'll
[29:19] never get out of that what I can intend
[29:21] it
[29:22] for because you've got to come to me for
[29:24] your
[29:25] rest and we cannot find this rest
[29:28] without first taking his yoke upon us
[29:31] and learning of his example take my yoke
[29:32] upon you if we become unyoked from him
[29:36] to rest we find no rest if we become
[29:38] unyoked from his will to to get our
[29:41] relief or to find pleasure or to um
[29:44] explore to have fun or to uh acquire
[29:47] whatever it might be then we cannot find
[29:50] rest we only enter further into the
[29:53] Labyrinth take my yoke upon you and
[29:54] learn of me this is that chord this is
[29:56] that way out of the the Maze and I am
[29:59] meek and lowly in heart and ye shall
[30:01] find rest unto your souls you will find
[30:03] rest from the frustration of thought
[30:05] desire and action for my yoke is easy
[30:08] and my burden is
[30:10] light Christ though we be yoke to him
[30:14] though we submit ourselves to him though
[30:17] this uh we are subject to Christ being
[30:20] Yol to Christ is where we find
[30:23] Simplicity being yolked to Christ is
[30:25] where we find bountifulness and
[30:27] liberality Liberty being yolked to
[30:30] Christ is where you're going to find
[30:31] your greatest
[30:33] Liberty you could say well prove that
[30:37] and I would say are you a
[30:39] Christian and if you say yes then we've
[30:41] proved it already by scripture if you
[30:45] reject scripture just go to your own
[30:48] teachers go to your own scientists that
[30:51] tells you that I'll tell you that man
[30:53] does not create his own desires he's a
[30:56] prisoner
[30:58] to to things Beyond his control even to
[31:01] the point where many scientists conclude
[31:03] that man does not have his own
[31:04] will they're the ones that take it to
[31:06] the extreme man doesn't even have a
[31:08] choice you think I could even say this
[31:11] to my kids you think you like Dr Pepper
[31:13] but you only like it because I like
[31:16] it and I don't like it because I liked
[31:19] it I liked it because somebody else
[31:21] liked it and you just follow the
[31:22] breadcrumbs all the way back to the
[31:24] serpent in the beginning right that
[31:26] there's these things that man is not his
[31:28] own master so then we must we must be
[31:32] yolked to Christ to find our greatest
[31:35] Liberty this is what Christ is now let's
[31:39] follow in the scripture as the scripture
[31:41] prophesies Christ to
[31:43] us again don't forget that we're talking
[31:46] about that feeding the fire of
[31:49] enmity and this Labyrinth that the
[31:52] church has
[31:54] become and how Through the Bible people
[31:56] have forged their bull workk and
[31:58] fortresses entrench themselves in it and
[32:01] nothing makes it out of the trench
[32:03] except for hatred and
[32:05] persecution but Christ came that's
[32:08] because man was thrust in this Labyrinth
[32:09] of sin All Things Are full of Labor the
[32:11] labor of man never leaves him satisfied
[32:14] man's knowledge of the Divine had been
[32:17] lost therefore all mankind can do is
[32:19] Wonder in the way of darkness and the
[32:21] congregation of the dead man has mixed
[32:22] himself with so many things and Paul is
[32:25] now saying this is the condition of man
[32:27] and Paul saying I fear that you'd beg be
[32:30] beguiled away from the Simplicity that
[32:32] is in Christ and Christ has come that we
[32:35] might have life and have life more
[32:36] abundantly he's come that he could give
[32:38] us
[32:39] rest so this is that Christ now that
[32:42] Paul says that he does not want our
[32:44] minds to be corrupted from and notice
[32:47] how the Bible prophesies in Isaiah 42:
[32:49] 1-7 behold my servant whom I uphold some
[32:52] of the translations say behold my
[32:55] Messiah my elect in whom my soul Delight
[32:58] I have put my spirit upon him this is
[33:01] the Messiah this is Christ he shall
[33:02] bring forth judgment to the Gentiles and
[33:05] to the Jew that meant
[33:07] punishment to the Gentiles it means
[33:09] righteousness he shall not cry nor lift
[33:12] up nor cause his voice to be heard in
[33:13] the
[33:14] street a bruised Reed shall he not break
[33:17] and the smoking flag shall he not quench
[33:19] he shall bring forth judgment unto truth
[33:23] he shall not fail nor be discouraged
[33:25] till Heath set judgment in the Earth the
[33:27] aisle shall wait for his law thus saith
[33:30] God the Lord he that created the heavens
[33:32] and stretched them out he that Spread
[33:34] spread forth the Earth and that which
[33:35] cometh out of it he that giveth breath
[33:37] unto the people upon it and spirit to
[33:39] them that walk therein what a leadup
[33:42] what an entrance what an introduction I
[33:46] the Lord have called thee in
[33:49] righteousness and will uphold thine hand
[33:52] and will keep thee and give thee for a
[33:54] covenant of the people for a light of
[33:57] the Gentiles I love how the prophecy
[34:00] brings us back to the creation of
[34:02] heavens and earth to the purpose of God
[34:04] in the beginning the very that mankind
[34:06] fell from thei Messiah is going to come
[34:09] in righteousness and he has given as a
[34:12] covenant for the light of the
[34:14] Gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring
[34:17] out the prisoners from the prison and
[34:19] them that sit in darkness out of the
[34:21] prison house this prison in that Hebrew
[34:25] is this dark enclosure it's a dungeon
[34:28] the labyrith was an underground
[34:31] prison that lath is that is a type of
[34:34] this Dark World which we have become a
[34:36] prisoner
[34:37] too L groping in darkness Bound by sin
[34:42] in Chains of death but Christ the
[34:45] Messiah is going to be a light to the
[34:47] Gentiles to open eyes that cannot see to
[34:51] bring out prisoners who are in the
[34:52] prison and to them that sit in darkness
[34:55] out of the prison house this is a
[34:58] prophecy of Christ so Luke chapter 1
[35:01] starting with verse 76 and thou child
[35:03] shall be called the prophet of the
[35:04] highest this is John the Baptist for
[35:06] Thou shalt go before the face of the
[35:07] Lord to prepare his ways this is what
[35:10] the Messiah is going to do to give
[35:11] knowledge of Salvation unto his people
[35:13] by the remission of their sins through
[35:15] the tender mercy of our God whereby the
[35:18] day spring from on high hath visited us
[35:20] to give light to them that sit in
[35:22] darkness and in the shadow of death to
[35:24] guide our feet in the way of PE
[35:28] peace I'd like for you to think about
[35:31] Christ as how he has been placed as the
[35:34] one that lets the prisoner out of prison
[35:38] that lets the one who's in the darkness
[35:39] of the prison house out into light that
[35:42] Christ is the gospel that calls us out
[35:45] of Darkness that Christ is the one that
[35:47] looses the shackles of sin and death and
[35:49] a lack of understanding that he's to
[35:51] give the knowledge of Salvation to give
[35:53] light to those that sit in darkness and
[35:55] in the shadow to guide our feet in the
[35:57] way of
[35:58] Peace Christ then becomes the Escape
[36:02] From The
[36:03] Labyrinth from the darkness from the
[36:07] dungeon we read already in Psalms 107 we
[36:10] read verses 10 to 12 such a sit in
[36:12] darkness and in the shadow of death
[36:14] being bound in Affliction and iron you
[36:15] see the Symmetry to these verses in
[36:17] Isaiah and Luke chapter 1 because they
[36:20] rebelled against the word of God and
[36:21] contemned the counsel of the most high
[36:24] therefore he brought down their heart
[36:26] with labor they fell down and there was
[36:28] none to help then they Cried unto the
[36:30] Lord of their trouble and he saved them
[36:32] out of their distresses he brought them
[36:35] out of darkness and the shadow of death
[36:37] and break their bands aunder this is
[36:40] Luke 179 to give light to them that sit
[36:43] in darkness and the shadow of death to
[36:45] give our guide our feet in the way of
[36:47] Peace he brought them out of darkness
[36:49] and the shadow of death and break their
[36:50] bands in a sun all that men would praise
[36:53] the Lord for his goodness and for his
[36:55] wonderful Works to the Children of Men
[36:57] oh that we ought to praise God for Jesus
[37:00] Christ who came to Deliver Us from the
[37:03] prison house to set us free and to give
[37:05] a light unto our feet that we may walk
[37:08] in the way of
[37:10] peace I hope that you're able to begin
[37:13] to peace together at least this part or
[37:14] focus on it not that you need to piece
[37:16] it together but just refocus that when
[37:18] Paul says I fear that Satan would try to
[37:21] beguile you and deceive you away from
[37:23] the Simplicity that is in Christ that
[37:25] your contemplations your thoughts and
[37:27] and your thinkings would be defiled ever
[37:30] so slightly from the singleness of mind
[37:32] and Devotion to Christ that you would
[37:34] think a lot of other things were more
[37:36] needful than Christ the one thing
[37:39] needful the one who came to give us rest
[37:42] to give us life and have it more
[37:44] abundantly a light to lighten the
[37:47] Gentiles as it says in Luke 2:32 that's
[37:49] what he was a light to lighten the
[37:50] Gentiles and the glory of thy People
[37:53] Israel Christ is to be revealed to the
[37:55] Gentiles to bring understanding and
[37:58] knowledge to open up blind eyes to show
[38:01] them the
[38:02] way we know the Gentiles scripturally
[38:05] were lost they were blind they had no
[38:06] Pro prophets and Promises they were
[38:09] wandering they were Godless what was
[38:11] Christ to be the one to give them
[38:13] purpose the one to give them meaning the
[38:15] one to rescue them from their
[38:18] sins it's upon this
[38:22] truth that I want you to look at what
[38:24] brother bradam is saying in the sardan
[38:26] church age
[38:28] how that denominational
[38:29] Zeal was causing people to build
[38:33] churches as
[38:34] fortresses and use the Bible to forge
[38:37] Creeds and use them for attacks and for
[38:42] defense and their confessions of faith
[38:45] and their confessions of Christ only fed
[38:47] the fire of
[38:49] hatred and only by putting them away
[38:53] could you start to heal the wounds of
[38:54] the
[38:56] church only only by putting away your
[38:59] confessions that you use as a sword your
[39:01] confessions that you use as a shield
[39:03] only by getting out of the bullworks and
[39:05] fortresses could you begin to
[39:07] heal the wounds of the church I would
[39:11] argue that some of us who've been
[39:12] wounded by the church will only begin to
[39:15] heal when we lay down the sword that
[39:17] church gave us and the shield that
[39:19] church gave us and Trust
[39:22] Christ I take this from the one thing
[39:26] needful is brother Bram called it by
[39:29] comenius listen to how he says this now
[39:32] I want you I'm reading this with the
[39:33] idea of Christ what Christ
[39:37] is what Paul was concerned we would be
[39:40] beguiled and defiled
[39:43] by and then what it had become as
[39:45] brother bradam identified religion as
[39:48] comenius writes the chain of
[39:50] communication between the created mind
[39:52] and the
[39:54] uncreated interesting way of describing
[39:56] it religion ought to bring soulless in
[39:59] all worldly perplexities and not not
[40:01] only to show a secure Port from the
[40:04] stormy hurricanes of worldly Affairs but
[40:06] also ought to lead into
[40:09] it religion should be a soulless from
[40:13] the lath religion should be safety and a
[40:17] secure Port during a time of
[40:19] perplexities but then religion also
[40:21] ought to lead us into the perplexities
[40:25] lead us into the hurricane as it were
[40:27] lead us into the
[40:28] Tempest that's what it ought to be but
[40:32] how does religion fulfill this we ask
[40:34] ourselves this question religious ought
[40:37] to give us comfort in world of
[40:38] perplexities it ought to give us safety
[40:41] in the worldly hurricanes it ought to
[40:43] lead us through these devastating storms
[40:45] but how does religion fulfill this
[40:47] already she herself has become a more
[40:50] perplexing lab than any other in the
[40:52] whole world for first instead of one
[40:56] there are innumerable religions and
[40:58] these have split again among them s into
[41:01] many others nothing but a labyrinth this
[41:05] is so evident especially to subtle
[41:08] political Minds that many now having
[41:11] come to suspect that no religion is true
[41:13] but all false are throwing aside
[41:16] Divinity himself in fear of the Divine
[41:18] and are slipping into atheism by seeking
[41:21] light in darkness itself security and
[41:24] sluggishness of the conscience life in
[41:28] death what has
[41:30] given such momentum to science that
[41:33] denies God the failure of
[41:37] religion presuming that no religion is
[41:39] true they throw aside Christ himself in
[41:43] the fear of God and slip into atheism
[41:46] trying to get light out of
[41:48] Darkness Security in a sluggish mind and
[41:51] conscience life out of death alas in
[41:56] truth he eism was a fable insane with
[41:59] the multitude of gods and Idols but
[42:02] neither can Judaism be considered much
[42:05] better for although it took its Origins
[42:07] from the true God himself creator of us
[42:09] all it degenerated however through
[42:11] undermining Corruptions into fism that
[42:14] is a chaos of superstitions muhammadans
[42:17] is no better
[42:27] he's saying religion Judaism doesn't
[42:29] have the answer
[42:57] people which sat in darkness saw great
[42:59] light and to them which sat in the
[43:00] region the shadow of death light is
[43:03] sprung
[43:03] up this is what Christ is to the people
[43:07] which sat in darkness they saw great
[43:10] light those in the region and Shadow
[43:13] death light is sprung
[43:14] up Jesus Christ Our Only
[43:18] Hope and he begins to preach and say
[43:21] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[43:24] hand not the kingdom of man not the
[43:26] kingdom of of Satan not this a labyrinth
[43:29] not this menur not any kind of Mythology
[43:31] but the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand it
[43:34] is Jesus who declares in John 14:6 I am
[43:37] the way the truth and the life no man
[43:40] cometh under the father but by
[43:43] me there is no access to God there is no
[43:46] salvation besides Jesus Christ he says I
[43:49] am the way the truth and the
[43:53] life this is what Christ is
[43:57] when Paul says I would that you would
[43:59] not be defiled from the Simplicity that
[44:01] is in Christ it is the Simplicity that
[44:03] he is the way the truth and the life
[44:06] that without the way there is no going
[44:08] without the truth there is no knowing
[44:09] without the life there is no living that
[44:11] you must have
[44:13] Christ Christ is the way and Isaiah 358
[44:17] and a highway shall be there and a way
[44:19] and it shall be called the way of
[44:22] Holiness the unclean shall not pass over
[44:24] it but it shall be for those the
[44:27] wayfaring men though fools shall not a
[44:32] therein the way is going to be so direct
[44:35] and straight that not even the ignorant
[44:38] could air on it that you don't have to
[44:41] be learned you don't have to be smart
[44:42] you don't have to be a scientist the way
[44:45] so clear so direct so true that not even
[44:48] a fool should
[44:51] Heir
[44:54] well that's what Christ should be
[44:58] so commenius continues only the
[45:00] Christian
[45:03] religion having for a leader him who is
[45:05] the way truth and life is believed to be
[45:09] certainly ought to be the holy way of
[45:11] Zion promised by the prophet so direct
[45:14] that not even the stupid are able to
[45:15] wander along the
[45:17] way but is
[45:20] it alas alas in the whole world scarcely
[45:23] a more intricate Labyrinth can be found
[45:26] than the Christian religion such it is
[45:28] now has become this is what brother Bram
[45:30] is saying in this time of the sardian
[45:32] age the 17th century as it's being
[45:37] written it's a Christian religion is so
[45:39] Multiplex I say and varied and divided
[45:42] into so many sects and cut up into so
[45:44] many thousand questions about faith and
[45:46] opinions about individual questions and
[45:48] battles over opinions that the whole
[45:50] world has nothing similarly
[45:55] intricate that's
[45:58] amazing there's no more branches of
[46:02] thought more disciplines more schools
[46:04] he's saying in the Christian religion
[46:06] than in
[46:08] science the Christian religion has so
[46:11] varied and multiplexed and divided in so
[46:13] many questions about faith and opinions
[46:15] and individual questions and battles
[46:17] over
[46:20] opinions that one has a
[46:22] confession and then there's a question
[46:24] about the uh uh or an opinion about uh
[46:28] this stance so one has to have an
[46:31] opinion on the opinion well he thinks
[46:33] that great what what's your opinion
[46:36] about what about whether or not it's
[46:38] great no about your what do you think
[46:39] about him thinking that it's
[46:43] great so you're not even weighing in on
[46:46] whether or not it actually is great no
[46:47] you're just weighing on the fact that he
[46:49] thinks it
[46:50] is and then if I weigh in on the fact
[46:53] that he thinks it's great then someone's
[46:55] got to weigh in
[46:57] on what I think about what he
[47:00] thinks and this has been the game that
[47:03] has unfolded ever since he says there's
[47:04] nothing in the world more intricate than
[47:08] Christianity and Paul said he feared
[47:11] that as a serpent beguiled Eve through
[47:12] his solty our minds our contemplation
[47:15] our our thoughts and our understanding
[47:17] would be
[47:20] defiled in the slightest degree for the
[47:22] Simplicity that is in
[47:24] Christ did Paul view it in the sense
[47:27] that as a Jew the slightest impurity
[47:30] destroyed it all or could it be that he
[47:32] saw that just given a a small inch how
[47:35] far it could go that if we left in the
[47:37] slightest degree we were more
[47:39] susceptible to leave in
[47:41] entirety that if we weren't true in
[47:43] devotion and singleness of mind to
[47:45] Christ that it left open multiple
[47:47] avenues for us to be led astray and for
[47:49] us to do our Dianes and to give in to
[47:51] fleshly whims was he concerned that the
[47:53] devil would find just the slightest room
[47:55] to work
[47:57] and thereby take full
[48:00] advantage our minds would be corrupted
[48:03] from the Simplicity that is in Christ
[48:04] and verse four for he that cometh
[48:06] preacheth another Jesus whom we have not
[48:09] preached or if you receive another
[48:10] Spirit which you have not received or
[48:12] another gospel which you have not
[48:13] accepted you might well bear with him
[48:17] another Jesus another Spirit another
[48:20] gospel if we looked at it this way
[48:24] Christ is the way the truth the life
[48:29] Christ there is is that is Jesus then
[48:32] the
[48:34] spirit the way the truth of Life the the
[48:38] gospel the way the truth of Life the
[48:40] multiplicity now with which it's broken
[48:42] up that there's Jesus there's another
[48:45] Jesus there's another spirit and another
[48:48] gospel Paul is not saying all is one but
[48:51] the breaking up of
[48:53] it to it could even be suggested even in
[48:56] the times with the word of God that
[48:59] there's a difference between the Holy
[49:00] Spirit and the Holy Ghost and the
[49:02] technicalities and the splitting of
[49:03] hairs put people in this state of even
[49:06] thinking wow that's super deep or oh my
[49:08] goodness did I get the ghost or the
[49:10] spirit which one do I really
[49:15] want all these other
[49:18] ways remember we read about uh on Sir
[49:23] Francis Bacon how he was talking about
[49:25] the cause of atheism and he said
[49:27] divisions in
[49:28] religion and he said that if religion
[49:30] was just divided in two if there was
[49:32] just one uh main division it would add
[49:34] Zeal to both sides so if Christianity
[49:37] was just split between the Catholic
[49:38] church and the Lutheran Church then the
[49:40] Catholics become more Catholic the
[49:41] Lutheran more Luther and it would just
[49:43] add Zeal to both sides but it would just
[49:45] be binary that's all there would be but
[49:48] Satan not being interested in being
[49:49] binary that there was this cause to
[49:52] split everything up
[49:54] innumerable and so with the multiplicity
[49:57] with many divisions he said it
[49:58] introduced
[50:01] atheism that if there was only if there
[50:04] was only Christianity and
[50:06] paganism it would add Zeal to both sides
[50:10] but the more that you split up
[50:12] Christianity the more it introduced
[50:14] paganism the more it introduces
[50:18] atheism and so Paul was
[50:20] concerned that another Jesus would be
[50:23] preached and that if another Jesus was
[50:25] preached then another Spirit would be
[50:28] introduced with another Spirit to be
[50:30] another gospel another gospel apart from
[50:31] the spirit in Jesus another uh spirit
[50:34] apart from the gospel in Christ all
[50:35] these different ways that it could be
[50:37] chopped up and divided
[50:38] up I know that there's times when the
[50:41] message is criticized because of the the
[50:43] the many different
[50:45] views that one could have in the message
[50:47] and some believe this and some believe
[50:49] that and some are two souls and some are
[50:50] no souls and some are polygamist and
[50:52] some are this and there's all sorts of
[50:54] ideas and they'll use that as a stain
[50:56] against the message but I would argue
[50:58] that if the message restored to us the
[51:00] Bible it's understandable that the Bible
[51:02] which is spawn a billion thoughts and
[51:04] opinions and divisions that it would be
[51:06] the devil would be near to cause the
[51:08] same with the restoration of
[51:10] Truth and I know that's not an
[51:12] indefensible argument and that doesn't
[51:13] shut up the
[51:15] critics but it's the truth that the
[51:18] Bible Christianity itself is
[51:21] plagued with
[51:23] divisions and Zeal even being added to
[51:25] those divisions
[51:27] that have become bull Works
[51:30] fortresses Paul said in Galatians 1: 6-9
[51:34] I Marvel now this is think about this in
[51:37] terms of him writing to the Corinthians
[51:38] say man I I I'm concerned that a one
[51:41] would come preaching another Jesus or
[51:43] you would receive another Spirit or
[51:44] accept another gospel that uh is not
[51:47] Christ or that is not the holy spirit
[51:49] that is not the word of God I I I'm
[51:51] concerned that this is what would happen
[51:53] by you being led astray ever so slightly
[51:55] through the son IES of Satan and your
[51:58] contemplation and your singleness of
[51:59] Devotion to Christ that just ever slow
[52:02] so slightly would be compromised that
[52:04] you would fall for these other things or
[52:05] that you'd support it sustain it agree
[52:08] with it but now notice what he says to
[52:09] the Galatians I Marvel that you are so
[52:12] soon removed from him that called you
[52:13] into the grace of Christ unto another
[52:17] gospel he's saying that they have
[52:20] stepped that it be ever so slightly they
[52:22] have stepped to another gospel they've
[52:25] been removed from another GOP to another
[52:28] gospel he says which is not another to
[52:30] make it clear there cannot be another
[52:32] good news there cannot be another Christ
[52:34] there cannot be another Jesus so anyone
[52:37] supposing a Jesus that is not Jesus is a
[52:39] false
[52:40] Christ you're removed from the grace of
[52:43] Christ unto another gospel he says but
[52:45] there cannot be another gospel there
[52:46] cannot be another Jesus but there be
[52:48] some that trouble you and would pervert
[52:51] the gospel of Christ and this is how
[52:54] adamant Paul is but though we are an
[52:55] angel from Heaven preach any other
[52:57] gospel unto you than that which we have
[52:59] preached unto you let him be a
[53:02] cursed the gospel is Christ If any man
[53:06] preach un you any other gospel than what
[53:07] Paul preached let him be a curse and we
[53:09] said therefore say I now again if any
[53:13] man preach any other gospel to you then
[53:15] you have received let him be a
[53:20] cursed it's quite a
[53:23] statement No Doubt anyone can use it
[53:27] to remain where they
[53:29] are oh I Reed Methodist teaching I'm a
[53:32] Methodist I receive this teaching I
[53:33] receive that teaching that's the one I
[53:35] received I will not be moved from it
[53:37] because Paul said I should not be
[53:39] removed from the gospel unto something
[53:41] else and anyone that tries to remove me
[53:44] from it let them be a curse be sure that
[53:46] what you're standing on is Christ be
[53:50] sure it lines up with the word and all
[53:51] the word make sure that at its heart and
[53:53] its core it is the Simplicity of Christ
[53:56] and not a man-made bull workk or
[54:00] Fortress comia says and what is more
[54:03] astonishing nowhere in the world on
[54:05] account of religious dentations
[54:08] dissensions are there such harsh hatreds
[54:12] such enduring quarrels such bloody
[54:15] persecutions such cruel punishments and
[54:18] such atrocious
[54:20] battles I get the feeling that he even
[54:22] had more and his editor said ah cut it
[54:24] stop it's enough
[54:27] harsh hatreds enduring quarrels bloody
[54:30] persecutions cruel punishments atrocious
[54:33] battles isn't it amazing that in the
[54:35] context of religion it's often that one
[54:38] would rather you deny Faith
[54:42] altogether to deny Christ altogether to
[54:45] become Godless then to serve a Christ
[54:48] that doesn't align with their version of
[54:52] Christ listen there's a DNA of carnal
[54:55] Christianity that Harbors within us
[54:57] resentments and bitterness and judgments
[55:00] of other people and their differences of
[55:01] opinions or doctrines or convictions
[55:03] that is not of Christ but is from the
[55:08] Labyrinth it is the enduring
[55:12] quarrels that still
[55:15] abide in man-made
[55:18] religion he says indeed one party of the
[55:20] Christians believes that it is outside
[55:23] the Labyrinth and says that if all are
[55:25] subordinate to subordinated one to the
[55:28] other under one head then Discord seen
[55:31] everywhere in the other sect cannot
[55:33] easily
[55:35] arise this is the truth if we could all
[55:37] just come under the banner of this truth
[55:40] then all confusion would be
[55:43] eradicated this is what he's saying that
[55:45] there's some Christians that believe
[55:47] that we are not the Labyrinth we are not
[55:48] the Fortress we are not the bullwark
[55:50] and if everybody would just come under
[55:53] the banner of our religion then all the
[55:56] cha that exists in these other thoughts
[55:57] and ideas will
[55:59] subside but he he he says but if someone
[56:03] looks near at the laws of their Concord
[56:06] their bylaws their Doctrine their
[56:07] theology he will see a labyrinth cly
[56:10] constructed to be sure more skillfully
[56:13] made than all but still a labyrinth and
[56:16] certainly larger than any elsewhere
[56:20] ever this could be said of the Catholic
[56:22] church this could be said of all the
[56:24] denominations that were coming up with
[56:25] their zeal
[56:27] with centuries of
[56:30] study with with power and
[56:33] Prestige with Legacy with so much to
[56:35] hold on to they wanted to bind the
[56:39] people wealth was an incredible
[56:43] motivator incredible motivator to the
[56:45] church and to denominations organized
[56:47] religion in this time they preached a
[56:49] gospel that kept the people poor they
[56:52] preached the gospel that kept them Bound
[56:54] in a prison and in a a labyrinth
[56:56] and the only way out was to walk the
[56:59] this is what's amazing is the Labyrinth
[57:01] became a symbol of pilgrimage in
[57:03] cathedrals and Catholic churches and and
[57:05] and cathedrals of other Christian
[57:08] religions all over Europe and around the
[57:09] world that ones would walk as a sign of
[57:13] devotion not realizing that it was a
[57:15] symbol of what they had
[57:19] become and the way
[57:21] that
[57:22] mankind I read a book within the last
[57:25] couple years
[57:27] about a man who who took this pilgrimage
[57:29] all the way from England to
[57:31] Rome and walked it and traveled it as
[57:35] other as they would have done in the
[57:36] days gone by and he was just visiting
[57:39] the different uh Catholic
[57:43] Cathedrals and the history of it and the
[57:46] monasteries and to see just how much how
[57:51] dark it
[57:52] was how much it served man and not the
[57:55] cause of Christ
[57:57] Christ this is what's being described
[58:03] here Babylon and all her
[58:06] daughters the Labyrinth of oh what if
[58:09] you just accepted the universal if you
[58:11] just accepted this everything would go
[58:14] away but Paul said there's some among
[58:16] you who will pervert the gospel of
[58:19] Christ Jude Jude said it this way
[58:22] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[58:23] write un you of the common salvation
[58:27] there's only one that's what he means by
[58:29] all common salvation it was needful for
[58:31] me to Rite on you and exhort you that
[58:32] you should earnestly contend for the
[58:34] faith which was once delivered under the
[58:37] Saints not just once in the sense that
[58:39] it was previously but it's one gospel
[58:43] the faith the common salvation which
[58:46] there's not another there's one Jesus
[58:47] and one Christ he said for there certain
[58:50] there are certain men crept in unawares
[58:52] who were before of old ordained to this
[58:54] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[58:57] grace of our God into lasciviousness and
[58:59] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[59:02] Jesus
[59:04] Christ the Galatians were soon removed
[59:06] from the grace of Christ into another
[59:08] gospel the Corinthians were warned that
[59:10] they would not be corrupted for the
[59:11] Simplicity that is in Christ and not
[59:13] bear with another Jesus another Spirit
[59:15] or another gospel Judah is saying that
[59:17] the Antichrist spirit is already at work
[59:19] amongst you men who've crept in turning
[59:21] you from the grace of God into
[59:23] lasciviousness and denying God and his
[59:26] son Jesus
[59:28] Christ this is at work before the Bible
[59:30] is even
[59:32] finished so commenius concludes in short
[59:35] and you'll find this in the church age
[59:36] book in short all things of Christians
[59:38] brother R says christiandom all the
[59:40] things of Christians have become a
[59:43] labyrinth you'll recognize this faith
[59:45] has been cut up into thousands of minute
[59:47] articles and If you deny one of these
[59:50] you are a
[59:51] heretic life has been divided into a
[59:54] thousand matters of conscience and if
[59:56] you don't keep all of these your
[59:57] Scruples are
[59:59] questioned now I'm talk we're talking
[1:00:02] we're talking about the
[1:00:04] Labyrinth that's what we're talking
[1:00:06] about life and living and how that
[1:00:10] Christianity the message can get flipped
[1:00:13] around where Christ is not the head but
[1:00:17] the head is all the minute details and
[1:00:20] articles and all the whether or not
[1:00:21] you're keeping this and whether or not
[1:00:22] you're keeping
[1:00:24] that and then if you don't do it your
[1:00:26] Scruples are questioned your your your
[1:00:28] conscience is called into question and
[1:00:31] then it says in the case of desire and
[1:00:32] hope oh this just was so powerful in the
[1:00:36] case in the matter of desire and hope
[1:00:38] here are very many who are ignorant of
[1:00:40] what they may pray for or hope for and
[1:00:43] from whom through whom and with what
[1:00:45] faith and therefore they are they either
[1:00:47] supported by blind hope or cast down by
[1:00:50] certain
[1:00:53] desperation this is organized religion
[1:00:56] entering into the 18th
[1:00:59] century this is organized
[1:01:03] religion and it was only going to get
[1:01:07] worse until God would
[1:01:09] come and restore
[1:01:14] it there are others who turn the whole
[1:01:18] worship I'm I'm going be I'm not going
[1:01:21] to finish I I took some quotes
[1:01:23] quotations out and some things I wanted
[1:01:24] to get into Harvest Time
[1:01:26] but I want to I want you to think about
[1:01:28] this in context of the message where we
[1:01:29] are
[1:01:30] today on how we take the word of God and
[1:01:34] we we make it really topheavy where
[1:01:37] all all the signs and all the Wonders
[1:01:40] and all the details and all the Articles
[1:01:42] have the preeminence and not
[1:01:44] Christ it's been turned into a
[1:01:48] labyrinth so there's some who don't know
[1:01:50] who to pray
[1:01:52] to and in not knowing who to pray to
[1:01:55] they either have blind hope which is not
[1:01:57] Faith or they just lose hope
[1:02:00] altogether and he said there are others
[1:02:02] who turn the whole ownership of the
[1:02:05] Divinity into
[1:02:07] ceremonies and others either cast aside
[1:02:09] or neglect worship itself along with
[1:02:12] ceremonies and to be sure all this has
[1:02:15] such diversity that if anyone could look
[1:02:17] at everything at the same time now he's
[1:02:19] descri described a lot of
[1:02:22] stuff now if we could look at
[1:02:23] Christianity today or even those forms
[1:02:26] of religion that are very near ours if
[1:02:29] one could look at all of it at one
[1:02:32] moment he would see no other spectacle
[1:02:35] than as if he should see an innumerable
[1:02:38] mass of men claiming to proceed on the
[1:02:41] same road but some of them go to the
[1:02:43] right others go to the left these go up
[1:02:47] those down others go forward and others
[1:02:50] backwards and what is more strange is
[1:02:52] some go on their feet and others on
[1:02:54] their heads
[1:02:56] do you get the
[1:02:58] picture do we need to have one of the
[1:03:00] kids these artists that we have amongst
[1:03:01] us draw it out they're all saying we
[1:03:04] believe in Christ we're all Christians
[1:03:07] we believe the message of the hour they
[1:03:10] all claim to believe they all claim to
[1:03:13] be of the one religion as as com says
[1:03:15] the one that ought to bring hope the one
[1:03:18] that ought to be the singular way the
[1:03:20] truth the life the one that ought to
[1:03:21] lead us out of Labyrinth Christianity
[1:03:23] itself has become a labyrinth and if we
[1:03:26] were able to view Christianity all at
[1:03:29] one time they would all say we're all
[1:03:32] Christians we're all going to heaven and
[1:03:34] this is a way and all their voices
[1:03:37] harmonizing to that one platitude but
[1:03:39] all their directions and actions not in
[1:03:43] SN up down left right and then others on
[1:03:46] their feet and others on their
[1:03:49] heads Paul said in Colossians chapter 2
[1:03:52] the musicians could come verses 6 7 and
[1:03:55] 8 as you have therefore received Christ
[1:03:57] Jesus the Lord so ye walk in
[1:04:04] him I leave this to you to think about
[1:04:08] in terms of the Simplicity that is in
[1:04:12] Christ as you have therefore received
[1:04:14] Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in
[1:04:17] him rooted and built up in him and
[1:04:21] established in the faith as you have
[1:04:23] been taught abounding therein with
[1:04:27] Thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil
[1:04:31] you through philosopy philosophy and
[1:04:34] vain
[1:04:35] deceit after the tradition of
[1:04:38] men after the rudiments of the
[1:04:41] world and not after
[1:04:45] Christ the way he says it beware lest
[1:04:48] you be spoiled through philosophy
[1:04:50] spoiled through vain deceit spoiled
[1:04:51] after tradition or spoiled after the r
[1:04:54] rudiments of the world and not spoiled
[1:04:56] after
[1:04:58] [Music]
[1:05:01] Christ beware this is the challenge and
[1:05:04] light of these things this Labyrinth
[1:05:05] we're living in it's maybe put in what
[1:05:09] you might consider anxious or classic
[1:05:11] thought but it's very real where we're
[1:05:13] living
[1:05:18] today as you've received Christ walk in
[1:05:20] him be rooted in him built up in him
[1:05:24] established in
[1:05:27] him and don't let any man spoil you
[1:05:30] through philosophy vain deceit tradition
[1:05:33] or rudiments of the
[1:05:35] world but only be after
[1:05:43] Christ as I was thinking about it last
[1:05:46] week maybe I'm just looking at this
[1:05:47] picture in my mind and wondering if I've
[1:05:50] been able to adequately convey the
[1:05:52] burden that was in my heart
[1:05:56] [Music]
[1:06:01] Christ it is all about Christ all of it
[1:06:05] every single bit of it it's Jesus Christ
[1:06:07] this message is Jesus Christ even if we
[1:06:10] get into the seals and the Thunders it's
[1:06:11] all Christ take Christ out of it you're
[1:06:14] you're your what are you left some other
[1:06:17] ISM so it's
[1:06:19] Christ and then we think okay the
[1:06:21] Simplicity that is in Christ and then
[1:06:24] you say well I mean even if we just took
[1:06:27] the New
[1:06:28] Testament there's a lot
[1:06:30] here we say well the message reveals
[1:06:32] Christ well we got 47 to 65 and what's
[1:06:35] this Continuum of of what is important
[1:06:37] and what's necessary in church order and
[1:06:39] and Doctrine and question and answers
[1:06:40] and you try to figure all this stuff out
[1:06:42] and and for me there's a way that we
[1:06:46] we're working we're undoing
[1:06:50] Christ like we're untangling him and
[1:06:53] we're chopping him up into a thousand
[1:06:55] pieces
[1:06:56] to see if we have them to see if we find
[1:07:00] them and and then trying to put it
[1:07:02] together
[1:07:03] again or trying to piece it together as
[1:07:06] if that was our job when I could I could
[1:07:07] say this there is a Jesus Christ who can
[1:07:12] be personally revealed to you and in
[1:07:14] there it
[1:07:16] satisfies that that is the most
[1:07:18] important and if I was to meet somebody
[1:07:20] who who absolutely and adamantly de
[1:07:23] denied the message and said it was say
[1:07:25] satanic but yet stood upon this
[1:07:27] proposition that they believe they had
[1:07:29] met Jesus Christ face to face then I
[1:07:32] could say Well it it what your theology
[1:07:34] or belief or your experience may not
[1:07:36] comport or line up with my Bible but I
[1:07:38] can say that my Bible says that what
[1:07:40] your confessing to be your ultimate is
[1:07:43] what your ultimate ought to be and only
[1:07:45] you can answer for yourself and your
[1:07:47] conscience whether you not you have
[1:07:48] found the Prince of Peace NE whether or
[1:07:50] not you have found life life more
[1:07:54] abundantly in other words instead of
[1:07:56] trying to
[1:07:58] take the message of the hour and put
[1:08:01] together a puzzle to find Christ in it
[1:08:05] say h well I wonder if this fits and I
[1:08:07] wonder if that fits we come to Christ
[1:08:09] the one thing
[1:08:11] needful and in him is everything that we
[1:08:13] have need
[1:08:14] of and then anything that we come across
[1:08:18] in our life that we come up against that
[1:08:20] we don't know how to fit that we don't
[1:08:22] know where it fits with Christ then we
[1:08:24] just wait until he can show us
[1:08:26] we trust him that he's leading
[1:08:30] us because when I this is the way I
[1:08:32] looked at it and maybe I'm just trying
[1:08:34] to pour these things out of my heart
[1:08:36] that I read that there are so many
[1:08:38] things that we're to do as
[1:08:40] Christians but I find that the gospel is
[1:08:43] Christ first the rest will take care of
[1:08:45] itself and the the the rest is not just
[1:08:48] left to our imagination or our own
[1:08:50] interpretation but the word says that
[1:08:53] this is what a Christian ought to do so
[1:08:55] I don't do these things to become a
[1:08:57] Christian or find Christ but having
[1:08:58] found Christ and him being the center of
[1:09:01] my life and what I pursue and what I
[1:09:03] desire and I have the Simplicity of
[1:09:05] Christ then what I expect and what I
[1:09:07] hope for is that the words that I read
[1:09:09] in the Bible would become true in my
[1:09:11] life and where I see that it doesn't
[1:09:13] line up I do not redefine the Christ I
[1:09:16] have received and I do not lament that I
[1:09:18] have not found him but rather I trust
[1:09:20] and pray that that which has promised
[1:09:23] will come true in my life
[1:09:25] so that if I believe that I am born
[1:09:27] again that I am a Son of God and the
[1:09:28] Bible says Thou shalt not Thou shalt not
[1:09:31] or Thou shalt and I find that I have not
[1:09:33] then I rather say this has formed for me
[1:09:36] the path that I must take and the word
[1:09:38] has enlightened me that I must love my
[1:09:41] wife as Christ loves the church that I
[1:09:43] should not frustrate my children that I
[1:09:45] should do these things that the Bible
[1:09:47] says a Christian should do and I know
[1:09:50] that all things are possible through
[1:09:51] Christ who gives me
[1:09:54] strength and that I have not defined
[1:09:56] Christ by the multitude of Commandments
[1:09:58] that are in the word but rather I find
[1:10:00] that Christ is a person who is the word
[1:10:02] that has found that I have found favor
[1:10:04] with who I love and who I'm devoted to
[1:10:07] and I trust in him that these details in
[1:10:10] the word of God would be made flesh in
[1:10:12] my
[1:10:13] [Music]
[1:10:20] life I think this the the concept of the
[1:10:24] labyrinth
[1:10:25] was important for brother brandham to
[1:10:27] introduce us to
[1:10:30] it and he says this brother brandham
[1:10:33] writes this what can
[1:10:36] help what can
[1:10:39] [Music]
[1:10:40] help only the one thing
[1:10:44] needful return to Christ looking to
[1:10:47] Christ as the only leader and walking in
[1:10:50] his footsteps setting aside all other
[1:10:53] ways until we all reach the goal and
[1:10:55] have come to the unity of the
[1:10:58] faith do you realize that there's a way
[1:11:01] that we can try to honor the message
[1:11:03] that in fact dishonors
[1:11:04] [Music]
[1:11:06] it it doesn't stumble anybody does it
[1:11:09] that we could and maybe maybe I
[1:11:10] shouldn't have done this at
[1:11:12] 11:45 but there's a way that we think
[1:11:14] we're being really we're honoring the
[1:11:15] message we're being real strict we're
[1:11:17] going to obey every word but if you
[1:11:19] leave Christ out of it or if it becomes
[1:11:21] another gospel or another Spirit or
[1:11:23] another Jesus it's in plain
[1:11:26] contradiction to the messenger who said
[1:11:28] one thing is needful return to Christ
[1:11:31] look into Christ as your only leader
[1:11:33] walking in his footsteps setting aside
[1:11:36] all other ways until we all reach the
[1:11:37] goal and have come to the unity of the
[1:11:40] faith I love this as the Heavenly Master
[1:11:44] Built everything on the ground of the
[1:11:47] scriptures so should we leave all
[1:11:49] particularities of our special
[1:11:52] confessions and be satisfied with the
[1:11:54] revealed word of of God which belongs to
[1:11:56] us all listen in the message of the hour
[1:11:59] there there's always seasons and and
[1:12:02] turnovers and things that come and go
[1:12:04] and waves and different movements where
[1:12:06] people have the particularities of their
[1:12:08] special confessions and there's a season
[1:12:10] of this and there's a season of that and
[1:12:12] listen if God wants to move a particular
[1:12:14] way in a particular place in a
[1:12:16] particular fashion for a particular time
[1:12:18] then let God have his way but as for me
[1:12:21] and my basis and my Foundation I want to
[1:12:24] leave all the particular arities of our
[1:12:26] special confessions and have one
[1:12:28] Foundation the revealed word which
[1:12:30] belongs to us all and not use our
[1:12:33] special confessions in our individual
[1:12:35] experiences as swords or Shields and as
[1:12:38] ways of entrenching ourselves in the
[1:12:42] Labyrinth and truly there is no need for
[1:12:45] us to lift up a banner and say no our
[1:12:47] our church our take on this is the one
[1:12:50] that is not amazed and is not
[1:12:53] confusing but to just lift the Banner of
[1:12:55] Christ
[1:12:58] hi I have great confidence in knowing
[1:13:02] that the message of the hour revealed
[1:13:04] Jesus Christ that it's
[1:13:06] truth there's times that people say oh
[1:13:08] well that so and so introducing the
[1:13:11] message or they want to be baptized and
[1:13:13] live in such and such place where should
[1:13:14] they go to church and and you're
[1:13:16] immediately you begin to think wow what
[1:13:18] what kind of church is it what do they
[1:13:19] teach and who's the pastor and things
[1:13:21] like that and I think those questions
[1:13:23] are valid
[1:13:25] and you realize well how presumptuous
[1:13:28] would it be to
[1:13:30] think that any one church has all the
[1:13:33] truth and nothing but the truth and is
[1:13:35] perfect and and this is what the message
[1:13:38] is apart from trusting in
[1:13:42] God that he's the one that's looking out
[1:13:45] over all of
[1:13:48] it and that at the end of the day
[1:13:51] Christ we he's the one that must have
[1:13:53] preeminence
[1:13:57] I I'll say this
[1:13:59] closing I believe that we should look at
[1:14:02] the message of the hour
[1:14:04] through look at this this emphasis of
[1:14:08] the message of the hour of this
[1:14:10] correction against the labyrinth in
[1:14:13] organized
[1:14:14] religion and not with the lens or view
[1:14:17] to make the message another
[1:14:19] one but that it was wanting to introduce
[1:14:22] us to Christ the way out of them
[1:14:26] all yet man ourselves and our own
[1:14:29] Humanity we can make a labyrinth out of
[1:14:31] it but remember Christ is the answer the
[1:14:34] way out of them
[1:14:35] all let's stand together this
