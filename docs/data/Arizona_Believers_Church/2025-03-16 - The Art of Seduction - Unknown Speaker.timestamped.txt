[0:00] Mark Chapter 13 Verse 22 for false
[0:04] Christ and false prophet shall rise and
[0:08] show signs and wonders to seduce if it
[0:11] were possible even the elect and I
[0:13] really think about this in this end time
[0:17] the time that we're living in now false
[0:19] Christ and false prophets they're going
[0:21] to come on the scene and show signs
[0:24] Great Signs and and wonders and works
[0:26] and their purpose and their goal is to
[0:29] seduce
[0:30] if it were possible even the elect amen
[0:34] we just trust God will bless this word
[0:36] you can be
[0:39] seated my title is The Art of
[0:43] Seduction and I know that might be a
[0:45] catchy title my son Elliot told me that
[0:48] it was um clickbaity and I thought that
[0:51] was a good sign from a 17-year-old and
[0:53] then brother Michael told me it looked
[0:55] like Kirkland's signature brand from
[0:57] Costco so uh I'm somewhere between
[1:00] clickbait and uh bulk uh value pricing
[1:04] but on the uh and I think just as
[1:06] brother Michael admitted he's just
[1:07] seduced by good prices but uh The Art of
[1:12] Seduction I want to just use a
[1:14] definition a scriptural definition of
[1:15] Seduction so you can understand where
[1:17] I'm coming from at the outset is to
[1:18] cause to go astray to be seduced
[1:22] specifically means to be led away from
[1:25] truth into error so you have to be
[1:28] enticed or seded seduced away from
[1:31] something real something true into air
[1:34] that's what seduction is or if you're
[1:35] seduced you're caused drawn to go astray
[1:39] from the right path or a correct way or
[1:42] drawn away from truth into air the
[1:45] Lord's been dealing with me on uh maybe
[1:48] the question of what is sin and the
[1:50] examination of sin and really what
[1:52] encompasses sin because I believe that
[1:55] understanding the nature of sin is
[1:56] actually necessary to completely
[1:58] overcome as because we know that we're
[2:01] taught that overcoming is to recognize
[2:03] the devil in all of his tricks and at
[2:05] the same time to recognize that greater
[2:08] is he that is in you that he than he
[2:10] that is in the world the Seducer and he
[2:12] has already overcome him so there is
[2:14] this component if for to overcome we
[2:16] have to have some understanding of what
[2:18] it is we are
[2:20] overcoming and it is the
[2:22] misunderstanding of sin that often leads
[2:24] to a false Pride um and some arrogance
[2:26] because people believe that they're
[2:27] beyond sin and they're above sin and
[2:29] therefore for uh they've relegated sin
[2:32] to a particular definition where they
[2:33] feel safe or for others since they don't
[2:35] know what sin is they live in constant
[2:37] defeat and then never ever walking in
[2:40] the promise of God to be free from sin
[2:43] so if you'll look in your Bibles to
[2:45] Romans chapter 6 verse
[2:47] 23 the Bible says and we're just going
[2:49] to use the scripture today and I have a
[2:52] number of scriptures here I'm not trying
[2:54] to break my personal uh record on the
[2:56] number of scriptures but those who are
[2:58] counting let me know where we're at by
[2:59] the end
[3:00] but in Romans chap 6: 23 it says for the
[3:03] wages of sin is death but the gift of
[3:06] God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
[3:08] Our Lord we're wanting to understand the
[3:10] nature of sin what is sin and the Bible
[3:13] tells us here that the wages of sin is
[3:16] death but the gift of God is eternal
[3:18] life and so the consequences of
[3:21] misunderstanding sin is not ah I got
[3:24] that wrong the consequences of
[3:26] misunderstanding sin is permanent
[3:28] separation from God the wages of sin is
[3:31] death this death is not just a physical
[3:33] death though because of sin there is
[3:36] physical death but it's actually a
[3:38] second death it's permanent
[3:39] separation and here Paul has taken sin's
[3:43] wages and he's contrasted it by God's
[3:46] gift and I think this is an important
[3:48] place to start because sin is only
[3:50] understood in contrast to God and we can
[3:53] really only understand what sin is in
[3:55] relationship to God what that sin then
[3:58] only exists because God has a particular
[4:01] value or God has a particular nature and
[4:03] character in sin is contrary to that so
[4:06] in writing the wages of sin is death but
[4:09] the gift of God is eternal life that's
[4:11] putting this contrast between God's gift
[4:14] and the Wage of
[4:16] Sin now if you look at Psalms 51:5 I
[4:19] want us to see for a moment we're just
[4:21] going to run through a number of
[4:22] scriptures here that uh substantiating
[4:25] this and all of this should be very
[4:26] familiar to us because we this sinful
[4:28] condition is real we are all born in a
[4:31] sinful condition and if we misconstrue
[4:35] what sin is it would lead us
[4:38] into uh or we could cause this confusion
[4:41] about our sinful State well sin is this
[4:43] this is what remedies it this is what it
[4:45] is if we don't have the right
[4:47] understanding of what sin is then
[4:48] there's going to be confusion about what
[4:50] we're born in in Psalm 51:5 David says
[4:54] behold I was shapen in iniquity and in
[4:57] sin did my mother cons me I will say now
[5:01] if you have your Bibles today we're just
[5:02] going to be providing the reference and
[5:04] maybe some key words underneath that
[5:06] reference so if you want to turn in the
[5:07] scripture to read the full thing the
[5:10] full scripture just feel free to use
[5:11] your Bibles behold I was shapen in
[5:13] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[5:16] conceived me there was this native
[5:18] sinfulness by being born by the fact
[5:21] that he was born he was born of the
[5:23] original sin and being born of the
[5:25] original sin there's this native
[5:26] sinfulness sin was in him and he's
[5:28] saying he was in sin when we read this
[5:31] here in Psalm 51 he had known that he
[5:33] had uh done wrong and that sin was in
[5:35] him he was shaped in iniquity and and
[5:38] conceived in sin Isaiah 64:6 says but we
[5:41] are all as an unclean thing and all our
[5:45] righteousnesses are as filthy rags and
[5:47] we all do Fade as a leaf and our
[5:49] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[5:52] away a man born of a woman is of a few
[5:54] days and full of trouble he's conceived
[5:57] in sin he's shaped by iniquity he's
[6:00] unclean his iniquities drive him as
[6:03] Romans 7:5 says for when we were in the
[6:05] flesh the Motions of sins which were by
[6:08] the law did work in our members to bring
[6:10] forth fruit unto death the Bible is
[6:13] telling us that we are naturally
[6:15] inclined to sin that it's not in our
[6:18] first nature uh uh to be righteous that
[6:20] we do not even have the power of
[6:22] righteousness working within us in
[6:24] Jeremiah chapter 13 or Romans chapter
[6:28] well that was the Motions of sins that
[6:30] that desire that movement that activity
[6:33] of sin is already working in us we're
[6:34] inclined to sin Jeremiah 13:23 says can
[6:38] the Ethiopian change his skin or the
[6:40] leopard his
[6:42] spots those are rhetorical questions say
[6:44] no we can't do it then may ye also do
[6:47] good that are accustomed to do evil it's
[6:49] in you sin is in you you are born in sin
[6:53] you're are shaped in sin you are you
[6:55] come into the world with a sinful nature
[6:57] you're inclined to do this as Paul says
[7:00] in Romans 7:18 for I know that in me
[7:03] that is my flesh dwelleth no good thing
[7:07] for to will is present with me but how
[7:08] to perform that which is good I find not
[7:11] this is a consistent theme throughout
[7:13] scripture and you start you might be
[7:15] getting nervous right now knowing just
[7:17] how many scriptures could fit here and
[7:18] you're like just how long is this part
[7:20] of the sermon going to be well we got a
[7:22] few more to go but scripture after
[7:25] scripture details how by a natural birth
[7:27] being born of a man and a woman we come
[7:29] into the world with a fallen nature that
[7:31] is inclined to sin just part part of our
[7:35] part of our makeup as it were there's no
[7:37] good thing in Us by this natural birth
[7:39] in Psalm 58:3 the wicked are estranged
[7:42] from the womb they go astray as soon as
[7:45] there be they be born speaking lies and
[7:48] we might want to think that that's true
[7:49] of the wicked but it's true of all of us
[7:53] that we are not born into relationship
[7:55] with God by our first birth we do not
[7:57] have this Clear Channel to heaven we are
[7:59] not indued with all wisdom and
[8:02] understanding and and righteousness and
[8:04] as soon as we're born we are LED as
[8:07] straight just by Nature just by Nature
[8:10] inside of us this motions of sin are
[8:13] already working having been conceived in
[8:15] sin then shaped in iniquity we come
[8:17] forth with the Motions of sin already
[8:20] working within us and therefore that's
[8:22] how we are inclined to speak lies I
[8:25] think it's often said and pointed out
[8:27] that you don't have to teach a child how
[8:28] to lie there's this Instinct that's kind
[8:31] of it's inate within them for
[8:33] self-preservation and for certain
[8:35] reasons to not necessarily speak truth
[8:37] as the Bible says in Romans 3:23 for all
[8:41] have sinned and come short of the glory
[8:43] of God
[8:45] all all have sinned that puts us all in
[8:48] the same category Ecclesiastes 7:20 for
[8:51] there is not a just man upon Earth that
[8:53] doeth good and sinth not I love how it
[8:56] just Nails it down none of us can take
[8:59] inventory of our lives and say I was
[9:00] born of a good man I was born of a good
[9:02] woman I've lived a good life uh I heard
[9:05] a minister say one time and it was
[9:07] shameful that it was a message Minister
[9:09] it was overseas so you don't have to get
[9:10] nervous about how close they lived to us
[9:12] but they said that they were born in the
[9:14] message they were taught the message the
[9:15] open Word was preached to them and they
[9:17] said what do I have to repent of what is
[9:20] it that I need to make right and I was
[9:21] kind of thinking man this guy's getting
[9:23] ready to really get him and that was his
[9:26] point and I was like well that's really
[9:28] interesting
[9:30] uh so it's a really unique theology but
[9:33] uh there's some verses that would
[9:34] Enlighten us to say it doesn't matter if
[9:36] you were born in the message and under
[9:39] word teaching and everything was just
[9:41] laid out just perfectly right you were
[9:43] born in
[9:45] sin and there's not a man upon Earth who
[9:48] has only been born once that can say he
[9:50] does good and doesn't sin 1 John 18 now
[9:54] realize in using this scripture there's
[9:55] some paradoxes in first John but we'll
[9:57] maybe explore them uh later at another
[10:00] time if we say that we have no sin we
[10:02] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[10:05] in us if we say that we have no sin we
[10:08] are deceived and we're deceiving
[10:09] ourselves can't put the blame on the
[10:11] devil it's one of these unique things as
[10:14] I begin to look at the scripture that
[10:15] ultimately there's some accountability
[10:17] that we all have to take where we're not
[10:19] just blaming the devil for our condition
[10:21] though there is some shared
[10:23] responsibility as we go back to the
[10:25] beginning but we have it in
[10:28] us if if we're just going to play the
[10:30] blame game then right we're just going
[10:31] to go all the way back to the beginning
[10:33] and all of us are absolved but we have
[10:35] to take accountability I was born this
[10:36] way this is in me I have to take
[10:38] responsibility for this if we say that
[10:41] we have no sin we cannot have the truth
[10:43] in us and we deceive
[10:45] ourselves as Ephesians chapter 2 puts it
[10:48] and you hath the quickened and says who
[10:50] were dead in trespasses and sins so we
[10:53] can all be described as being dead in
[10:57] sin these transgressions these trespass
[11:00] having been born of a woman just born in
[11:02] a human condition born of the original
[11:05] sin there's this native sinfulness
[11:07] that's inside of us and so we are
[11:09] considered dead in sins and the
[11:12] condition that we come forth in in
[11:14] Romans chapter 8:7 is that because the
[11:16] carnal mind is enity against God for it
[11:19] is not subject to the law of God neither
[11:22] indeed can be that's first nature first
[11:25] birth we are and I know I'm maybe drawn
[11:28] heavily on our uh our already well
[11:32] established understanding of what the
[11:33] original sin is or was but this result
[11:38] of that original sin is all have come in
[11:40] this hybrid nature Fallen nature with
[11:43] the carnal mind as we want to say that's
[11:45] evolved and uh uh been uh through
[11:49] genetics and the world history and the
[11:51] forming of our cultures and Society we
[11:54] we arrive at a time when we can
[11:55] absolutely say the mind is against the
[11:58] things of God God naturally we're not
[12:01] naturally inclined to spiritual
[12:04] things the Bible says in Romans chapter
[12:07] 5:12 wherefore as by one man sin entered
[12:10] into the world is placing this
[12:13] responsibility upon Adam and death by
[12:17] sin so there's our real key that death
[12:20] is the result of sin so if you
[12:23] misunderstand what sin is and you say
[12:25] well sin is something if you believe
[12:28] that sin was something that it's not
[12:29] then you're not actually going to have
[12:30] the right understanding of what death is
[12:33] or be fully aware of what can cause
[12:35] death we have to understand what sin is
[12:38] and if it if it feels like man brother
[12:39] eron's going down this path today where
[12:42] sin must be something very Elusive and
[12:43] mysterious no I think it's just going to
[12:45] be something very simple that you
[12:47] already know and is very clear to us but
[12:49] I believe it's important to establish by
[12:51] scripture what sin is so that we can
[12:53] properly overcome completely and
[12:56] overcome everything in the time and hour
[12:58] that we're living in now death entered
[13:00] by sin and so death passed upon all men
[13:03] why for that all have
[13:06] sinned notice how it's by one man that
[13:10] it enters but then we are all sinners
[13:12] and we all have sinned therefore sin has
[13:14] passed on all men now I want to take
[13:18] this sinful condition that we've looked
[13:19] at and I say that's our current state we
[13:21] currently live in with this native
[13:23] sinfulness this is how we're all born
[13:25] and I'm not speaking to your nature as
[13:27] born again but Humanity is born in sin I
[13:30] want to take our original condition or
[13:32] take our sinful current condition and
[13:35] contrast it by the original condition
[13:38] and just take this for a few moments and
[13:40] look at how we recognize through a
[13:42] number of scriptures and maybe eight or
[13:45] nine however it was that born in sin all
[13:48] have sinned that there is by natural
[13:51] process by sexual birth we come forth
[13:54] with the DNA of our parents and we have
[13:56] the nature of our ancestors and then we
[13:58] have the nurture of those that rear us
[14:00] and we have the environment that we're
[14:02] raised in and all of this is not
[14:04] inclined upward but it declines
[14:07] downward but in the beginning there was
[14:10] this original condition of man that was
[14:12] completely perfect we looked at the
[14:15] scripture a number of times as of late
[14:16] in Genesis 2:25 it says of Adam and the
[14:19] woman and they were both naked the man
[14:21] and his wife and were not ashamed it's a
[14:24] poetic language to describe them in a
[14:26] perfect condition there was no sin there
[14:29] was no evil there was no fear there was
[14:31] no perversion only innocence there was
[14:34] nothing in their makeup or their
[14:35] character or their existence that was
[14:37] stained or marked by sin nothing in
[14:40] their existence at all there wasn't
[14:42] anything that they would walk by and
[14:43] blush to as a matter of fact there was
[14:45] no blush they were they were pure they
[14:47] were innocent everything was
[14:49] holy the Bible says in Genesis 1: 31 and
[14:53] God saw everything that he had made and
[14:55] behold it was very
[14:57] good this is is uh this speaks to the
[15:00] sinlessness of creation God the only
[15:03] thing that he remarked was not good was
[15:05] not sinful but rather it was that man
[15:08] had a further purpose and there was a
[15:09] further reflection of God but at this
[15:11] point at which he says I will make uh
[15:14] man in my image and there was going to
[15:15] be a woman that would come forth and she
[15:18] would be this companion to man God looks
[15:21] at all creation he says this is very
[15:24] good this is this is how uh this is
[15:28] perect per everything is
[15:32] sinless but then the great turn is in
[15:35] Genesis chter
[15:37] 3 we find this moment where God says in
[15:40] verse 13 the Lord God said unto the
[15:41] woman what is this that thou Hast
[15:44] done so now the sinless condition has
[15:48] been breached something's changed and
[15:52] God is asking what have you done
[15:54] something has been done and the woman
[15:57] gives a very insight ful
[16:00] accurate I would even say descriptive
[16:02] response the woman said in her honesty
[16:05] the serpent beguiled me and I did
[16:09] eat she could have said I ate she could
[16:12] have said I ate of the tree of knowledge
[16:14] of Good and Evil I could have done this
[16:15] she could have just jumped to the end
[16:17] and answered it very specifically what I
[16:19] have done is I have eaten but she says
[16:22] the serpent beguiled me she was led
[16:25] astray means to lead astray or to
[16:27] deceive the word means is
[16:31] seduce the serpent seduced
[16:34] me and I did eat now to the subject of
[16:37] the original sin it would seem really
[16:39] really odd for her to use such
[16:41] aggravating language to say that she was
[16:44] morally seduced into eating of
[16:47] fruit oh well that was the forbidden
[16:50] fruit you got to think uh you it's
[16:52] important even to think in terms of what
[16:54] we're using as far as human language
[16:55] today to describe something and if it
[16:57] was merely uh uh Disobedience to eat
[17:00] this forbidden uh broccoli or whatever
[17:02] we might want to say that it was or it
[17:04] could have been a a kiwi it could have
[17:05] been an avocado could have been a tomato
[17:07] if we're going with fruit but there's
[17:09] something that said this is what I was
[17:11] told not to eat and I ate it seduction
[17:15] isn't the word that we would use but
[17:18] this was a moral deceiving she was led
[17:21] astray morally and she was seduced to
[17:27] sin now if we can look at the beginning
[17:29] of the chapter I want to take the origin
[17:31] of original sin and essentially in doing
[17:34] this this examination uncovers how Satan
[17:37] uses seduction and what his seduction is
[17:39] to cause sin now God asked the woman
[17:44] what have you done now what she did is
[17:46] this overt act it's something in her
[17:48] actions but we realize there's more that
[17:51] takes place before she ate because her
[17:53] answer discloses that she doesn't just
[17:56] say what I did was eat she says I was
[17:58] first seduced and having been first
[18:00] seduced I acted and it's important to
[18:04] recognize that what she had done is she
[18:06] had sinned first by being seduced and
[18:10] then the ACT followed without the
[18:12] seduction there is no eating so are we
[18:14] on the kind of the same page as we build
[18:16] to this as we've established that we're
[18:18] all born in a sinful condition and we
[18:21] took a quick glance at how there was
[18:23] originally a sinless condition now we
[18:25] see the woman having been seduced into a
[18:28] sin sin ful condition and it begins with
[18:31] Genesis 3:1 now the serpent was more
[18:33] subtle than any beast of the field he
[18:36] was skillful this is where I get the the
[18:39] the term art the skill of Seduction he
[18:42] was crafty he was subtle he was skilled
[18:44] in a particular manner he was more
[18:46] subtle than any beast of the field which
[18:48] the Lord God had made and he said unto
[18:50] the woman some look at this scripture
[18:53] and say that this would have been a
[18:55] supernatural uh feat it would have been
[18:58] something that would have caught the
[18:59] woman off guard but we understand that
[19:01] the serpent was a beast that could talk
[19:04] there was one that talking would not
[19:06] have been uncommon for him to have said
[19:08] something or there to be some
[19:09] communication between he and Adam would
[19:11] not have been foreign this isn't akin to
[19:14] uh Bam's donkey speaking to him and
[19:17] getting his attention and should have
[19:19] known at the very moment that the
[19:21] serpent is now speaking that something
[19:22] is happening to be on guard he was
[19:25] crafty he was subtle and he used this
[19:27] shrewdness to Satan or Satan used his
[19:29] shrewdness to Satan's own Advantage so
[19:31] catch this he is very crafty he's very
[19:34] subtle he's
[19:36] Artful and he said unto the woman ye
[19:39] hath God said ye shall not eat of every
[19:42] tree in the garden this seems to be a
[19:44] reasonable question but notice this
[19:46] supposition this question is with
[19:49] intent he he he he's not gardening that
[19:52] day and said I'm trying to get your uh
[19:53] I'm I'm your instacart today I'm your
[19:55] personal shopper I want to know what I
[19:57] can gather and Forge for for you this
[19:59] afternoon for dinner he's asking this
[20:01] question probing and it's for a reason
[20:05] and I want you to look at it this way so
[20:06] I provided it to you with this way the
[20:08] serpent speaks and that's one thing that
[20:11] we can see serpent speaks and it's not
[20:13] just the serpent speaking but it's who
[20:15] he speaks to the serpent speaks to the
[20:19] woman doesn't say it to the man he says
[20:21] it to the woman this is not necessarily
[20:24] in the presence of Adam he's not
[20:26] addressing them together but there has
[20:28] been some effort to single her out and
[20:31] to address her so the serpent speaks
[20:33] then the serpent is speaking to the
[20:35] woman and the serpent speaks to the
[20:37] woman what God
[20:39] spoke now this is to me an important
[20:42] thing that he doesn't just come right
[20:44] out and say hey hey woman you're looking
[20:46] good today but he begins with this
[20:48] question of God has not God spoke to you
[20:53] already and he's saying if I could say
[20:55] what the tapes already
[20:57] said but what does here if we could look
[20:59] at this is he said un the woman ye yeah
[21:02] hath God said If you're looking at your
[21:04] scripture you'll see that he uses the
[21:07] term God this is
[21:09] Elohim and in saying yeath God said he's
[21:12] using an impersonal term of God though
[21:14] this is the Transcendent Elohim he is
[21:17] beyond he is superior he uses the word
[21:20] God who God in the beginning
[21:22] created so he's using a term for God
[21:25] Elohim but there's something elusive to
[21:27] that term this is the great one this is
[21:30] the superior one yeah hath not Elohim
[21:33] said that you shall not eat of every
[21:34] tree of the garden but the nature of God
[21:37] had changed once creation had been fully
[21:39] brought forth as it says in Genesis CH 2
[21:42] ver verse4 these are the generations of
[21:45] the heavens and of the earth when they
[21:46] were created in the day that the Lord
[21:50] God made the Heaven and the
[21:53] earth the earth and the heavens this is
[21:56] not merely God or Elohim but the this is
[21:59] lord god Jehovah Elohim Yahweh and this
[22:02] term that is used expresses this
[22:05] Covenant God in relationship to his
[22:08] creation uh anyone could say that
[22:10] there's an Elohim in the sense that they
[22:13] recognize uh there is one greater they
[22:15] could use it even in the sense that
[22:16] there's one Beyond us and there's one
[22:18] greater I believe even Elohim is used in
[22:21] the scripture to refer to uh Gods of the
[22:24] people or what people that they supposed
[22:26] to be Gods but to say Yahweh or Jehovah
[22:29] this is the
[22:31] Unspeakable to say Jehovah God takes God
[22:35] out of this realm of just merely Elohim
[22:37] and he brings them in relationship to
[22:39] the
[22:40] creation and Satan and I'm not trying to
[22:42] get bogged down in semantics here but he
[22:44] asked the question uh did God say you
[22:47] can't eat and what did God say about
[22:48] what you can't eat in the tree of the
[22:50] garden and since we know the rest of the
[22:53] story we're not just all suspicious we
[22:55] know what happened we can recognize that
[22:58] even in the way that he's talking he
[22:59] cleverly creates this separation between
[23:02] God and the
[23:03] woman by just referring to him as Elohim
[23:06] or God he kind he's able to already get
[23:10] her thinking in God as something dist of
[23:12] God as something distant and it shows up
[23:15] in the way that she answers the question
[23:17] because in answering the question she
[23:18] refers to him merely as
[23:21] Elohim and when you think about it this
[23:23] is the first conversation about
[23:26] God first time that we see God is being
[23:29] spoken of and when it starts and it's
[23:32] not that there hadn't been prior
[23:33] conversations about the Lord and not
[23:35] that Adam and the woman would not have
[23:36] discussed him and fellowship with him
[23:38] but this first recording of a
[23:40] conversation the serpent is speaking to
[23:42] the woman what Elohim had said and in
[23:46] doing so in this first conversation we
[23:48] read about God they've objectified God
[23:51] in other words they've just made them an
[23:54] object they're not speaking to God or
[23:57] with God
[23:59] he's speaking of him in third person and
[24:01] as I thought about it last week I like
[24:03] is this he as if he wouldn't even know
[24:04] what they're
[24:05] saying as if he wasn't present he got
[24:08] the woman to immediately and this is how
[24:10] the Lord's dealt with my heart that
[24:12] there was a way that he caught her
[24:13] attention to where when she answered it
[24:16] wasn't like well he's right here why
[24:18] don't you just ask
[24:20] him there was it was almost as if he was
[24:23] able to create a a distance between her
[24:26] and God to get her so singly focused in
[24:28] on one question that God became
[24:32] distant listen we we we could just be
[24:34] honest if you really felt the presence
[24:36] of God and if in the moment you weren't
[24:38] deceived into thinking that he's some
[24:40] far off and he doesn't see what you do
[24:42] we will do anything when we're
[24:44] unconscious of
[24:48] God and so they're not speaking to God
[24:50] not speaking about God they're using him
[24:52] in the third person and really what this
[24:54] would be is I would say this in the
[24:56] most negative term it was just mere
[25:00] theology they were just merely talking
[25:02] about
[25:03] God it was a study of God without any
[25:06] inference of intimacy or relationship
[25:08] with God it wasn't Yahweh it was God and
[25:12] in doing so objectified God who would
[25:14] have maybe a list of rules so what did
[25:17] this great Supreme Being say you can't
[25:19] do was it he said you're not supposed to
[25:23] do and there was no
[25:25] relationship indicated by the language
[25:28] that being used and even an effort by
[25:30] the devil to separate the woman from her
[25:32] intimacy and her relationship to God an
[25:35] example of this I think would be a very
[25:37] good example to see is in Matthew
[25:39] chapter 26: 69 to 70 I want to go to
[25:43] 75 it says now Peter sat without in the
[25:47] palace and we recognize this at the time
[25:49] when Jesus is being tried Jesus is
[25:51] already prophesied Peter the won
[25:54] Crow uh till you've denied me three
[25:56] times and as he sat in the Palace of
[25:59] damsel came unto him and saying thou
[26:00] also was with Jesus of Galilee so
[26:03] there's no confusion as to who he's
[26:06] being associated with so he can't be
[26:09] clever and and think he was referred to
[26:11] somebody else he says and he denied
[26:12] before them all saying I know not what
[26:15] thou sayest so maybe that's a little bit
[26:18] more clever his lawyer told him answer
[26:20] Ambiguously I don't understand I don't
[26:23] know if I've told you this before but my
[26:24] dad one time was work working on a
[26:26] military base in San Diego
[26:29] and he was there without a he was a
[26:30] young teenager working for my grandpa
[26:33] who had a contract to work on the base
[26:34] and everyone had to have credentials or
[26:36] clearance or licensing to be there and a
[26:39] military the uh military police showed
[26:41] up and asked him if he had any
[26:43] documentation he said
[26:45] no and then the guy just began to speak
[26:47] Spanish perfectly and my dad
[26:50] said and the guy just chuckled and
[26:52] walked away and so Peter might have
[26:55] initially said no
[26:58] and when he was gone out into the porch
[27:00] another maid saw him and said unto them
[27:02] that were there this fellow was also
[27:04] with Jesus of Nazar I love how they're
[27:07] just going to make sure that we know who
[27:09] this guy is and again he denied with an
[27:12] oath right I do not know the
[27:16] man so now he's being a little bit more
[27:19] articulate and after a while came unto
[27:21] him they that stood by and said to Peter
[27:25] surely thou also art one of of them
[27:28] here's how our art series comes into
[27:30] view thou also art one of them for thy
[27:33] speech berth thee it betrays you we know
[27:35] by the way you talk we recognize you you
[27:38] were with him you know Jesus of Galilee
[27:40] it's the same Jesus of Nazareth you have
[27:42] been with him and that with him and he
[27:44] says the Bible says in verse 24 then he
[27:46] began to curse and to
[27:49] swear it's no longer a promise I promise
[27:51] I wasn't now he's cursing and swearing
[27:53] saying I know not the
[27:56] man notice how quickly even in his
[27:58] language he's taken the deity of Christ
[28:00] away he's not Lord he's not master
[28:02] there's no respect being paid anymore I
[28:05] don't know the dude I don't know the guy
[28:08] from I don't know what you mean to I do
[28:10] not know the man to cursing and swearing
[28:11] saying I know not the man and
[28:15] immediately the crew and Peter
[28:17] remembered the words of Jesus which said
[28:19] unto him before the Crow Thou shalt
[28:21] deny me Thrice and he went out and wept
[28:24] bitterly to deny the word means to
[28:26] affirm no relationship ship
[28:29] with it's to deny to deny it means to
[28:33] disavow any connection
[28:36] with to deny is not to say the guy
[28:40] doesn't exist but it's to change your
[28:42] relationship with him to deny he distan
[28:46] himself from Christ and he did it in the
[28:49] moment I could just put it as plainly as
[28:51] we read it he did it because he didn't
[28:53] trust
[28:54] him in this moment in the circumstances
[28:57] when he saw what was transpiring he was
[28:59] no longer proud he was no longer happy
[29:02] to be identified if this had been the
[29:03] very moment where all the Miracles were
[29:05] being performed and all a sudden the
[29:06] soldier showed up he's like it's time to
[29:08] draw my sword buddy and I'm going to
[29:10] stand for you now it looked like the
[29:11] tide had turned and everyone was walking
[29:14] away and everybody had all this evidence
[29:15] and everything was going uh uh working
[29:18] sideways against him it was in this
[29:19] moment of doubt that he began to deny
[29:22] who Jesus Christ was because he didn't
[29:24] trust who he said he was he didn't trust
[29:28] the source of all the Miracles and in
[29:31] that moment he he distanced himself from
[29:34] Christ this is exactly what happened in
[29:36] the garden through the woman's initial
[29:38] response and what the devil was trying
[29:39] to do he wanted to create enough
[29:41] distance some wiggle room a space to
[29:45] work I titled this The Art of Seduction
[29:48] the seduction to cause one to Desert an
[29:50] allegiance to to be seduced you desert
[29:53] your service to something I use the term
[29:56] art because Satan's skill in painting a
[29:59] false picture of
[30:01] God that's what he did in the beginning
[30:03] he painted a picture to
[30:06] Eve and he in painting this picture by
[30:10] conversation he skillfully he artfully
[30:13] cleverly impregnated the woman's mind
[30:15] with the wrong conception of God she
[30:18] entertained a picture of God he painted
[30:20] the picture through his language hey
[30:22] this God this impersonal God has told
[30:26] you what you can't do
[30:29] now you know the reason why is because
[30:32] he's
[30:33] selfish because he's a
[30:36] narcissist because he's because he's
[30:39] trying to hold something back we've used
[30:40] this a number of times even very
[30:41] recently maybe in one of our last
[30:43] Services how that he caused the woman to
[30:45] question God's motive question his
[30:48] character let's look at the the
[30:51] beginning when God gave the Commandment
[30:52] in Genesis 2: 16 and
[30:56] 17 I realized that my my tone may be uh
[31:00] my my volume may be a little high maybe
[31:02] a little strained a lot of emphasis but
[31:04] I realize the matter is really strictly
[31:06] speaking teaching but these are things
[31:09] that are necessary it's necessary for us
[31:11] to slow down and and walk through the
[31:15] scripture with a heart full of Faith to
[31:17] believing that these are the words of
[31:19] God and asking ourselves God today right
[31:21] now where I'm living today I need your
[31:23] word to help me so here's God's original
[31:26] commandment in the beginning are we
[31:28] learning that what Satan did in the
[31:31] beginning uh God is undoing completely
[31:34] in the end God's restoring us back and
[31:37] there's such a critical turn of this
[31:39] revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour
[31:42] to bring us back to the original
[31:44] condition and so in Genesis CH 2: 16- 17
[31:48] and the Lord God it's not God the Lord
[31:52] God Yahweh
[31:55] yahovah Jehovah Elohim commanded the man
[31:58] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[32:02] mayest freely eat God is commanding
[32:06] Freedom you may freely
[32:09] eat in other words you are free moreal
[32:12] agents to enjoy this Liberty to be
[32:15] fruitful to have dominion and partake of
[32:17] all these things that I've given you
[32:19] this is
[32:21] freedom now I want you to narrow in on
[32:23] this especially as we did several
[32:25] services on modesty and we saw that God
[32:27] does have a standard that God does have
[32:29] a dress code that God has some
[32:31] expectations as to how we might present
[32:33] ourselves externally and it's not just
[32:35] oh it's what's on the inside that
[32:37] matters to the point that God doesn't
[32:39] care how you look at all we recognize
[32:41] scripturally that's
[32:43] error and there there's voices that
[32:45] would want to uh emphasize Liberty and
[32:49] freedom to the extent that you should be
[32:51] allowed to do whatever you want in
[32:54] anything that would inhibit you from
[32:56] pursuing certain things I is
[33:03] controlling we've done our
[33:07] own Deeds to make that so by mishandling
[33:12] the word of God and we have become
[33:14] cultish and we have imposed standards
[33:17] without uh without
[33:20] love it's not speaking the truth as love
[33:24] speaking the truth with love because if
[33:27] you don't have the character of Christ
[33:29] behind it it tends to bind and abuse and
[33:32] bruise and
[33:34] control so Jehovah commanded
[33:37] Freedom you're you're
[33:39] free verse 17 begins with but of the
[33:44] tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil
[33:46] Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[33:48] that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt
[33:50] surely die God has not immediately given
[33:53] them Liberty to only take it away but
[33:56] their freedom was secured by this
[34:00] restriction he preserved their freedom
[34:02] he says you're free but there's this
[34:04] there has to be this understanding when
[34:06] he says Thou shalt not eat Freedom
[34:08] necessitated a restrictive
[34:10] commandment it's not really Freedom if
[34:13] anything goes right I mean let's just be
[34:16] honest when we tell someone to come we
[34:19] say make yourself at home and you're
[34:21] like wow this is awesome I'm free to
[34:23] make myself at home and then all of a
[34:26] sudden it's like cuz we're going to
[34:27] treat you like family next thing you
[34:28] know we're beating you up and we're
[34:30] calling you names and we're taking your
[34:32] taking what you we're you know rifling
[34:33] through your purse or whatever like and
[34:35] start treating you actually as family
[34:37] what kind of Liberty what we're taking
[34:38] our liberties we're free where the
[34:41] spirit of the Lord is there's liberty to
[34:44] gossip to do whatever we want to justify
[34:45] ourselves right and so there's this way
[34:47] that we can just approach it from the
[34:49] standpoint that liberty liberty liberty
[34:51] but you could not have freedom unless
[34:53] there was some
[34:54] restriction to truly have freedom there
[34:57] must be boundaries
[34:59] to truly have freedom there must be
[35:00] limits it's freedom to operate operate
[35:02] within certain parameters but if there's
[35:04] no restrictions then your freedoms and
[35:06] your Liberties will eventually infringe
[35:08] upon my
[35:09] own that's why it's not just merely uh
[35:12] positive Liberties but positive
[35:14] Liberties require negative Liberties and
[35:16] that's just a nod to our Economist and
[35:19] our uh
[35:21] revolutionary writers and even the
[35:23] writers in in in England who wrestled
[35:26] with these topics and in order to have
[35:28] true Liberty there has to be some
[35:29] restrictive Liberty so only in accepting
[35:32] and honoring God's boundaries was there
[35:34] actual
[35:36] freedom but it's those boundaries that
[35:39] mankind VI
[35:40] violated and when they violated that
[35:43] restrictive Liberty that restrictive
[35:46] commandment that's when they lost their
[35:49] freedom in Romans chapter
[35:52] 7:14 for we know that the law is
[35:54] spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin
[35:59] this is an interesting way to think
[36:00] about it their freedom Adam and the
[36:03] woman their freedom was in a natural
[36:05] ability to not
[36:07] sin that's what Liberty was their
[36:10] freedom was in a natural Liberty to not
[36:12] sin but after the fall through the fall
[36:15] we all lost that freedom we're not free
[36:17] to not sin anymore Paul says I'm I'm in
[36:20] bondage to sin I'm born of a woman and
[36:22] in doing so I am now sold and I'm a
[36:25] servant to sin Liberty is being free now
[36:27] think about the Liberty that God wants
[36:28] to give us with the Liberty to not sin
[36:33] that's the freedom that creation
[36:36] had what was Satan's goal then he could
[36:41] kind of put that out he had a goal he
[36:43] had an objective but by
[36:44] mischaracterizing God what is he able to
[36:47] do he's able to break trust in God which
[36:50] allows this doubt to rise in the
[36:54] woman what he allowed the woman to do is
[36:56] to separate herself from God
[36:58] God and once this impregnation in her
[37:02] mind took place once she was able to he
[37:04] was able to get distance from God and
[37:06] create distance as Elohim and then
[37:10] question his character if you're up if
[37:12] you know somebody if you're up close and
[37:14] you know somebody then there's just a
[37:15] way that you know like I know them I
[37:17] know what they're thinking but if
[37:18] anybody could ever get you to step back
[37:20] from them say oh I just want you to take
[37:23] an objective view of what they've been
[37:25] doing and they get you far enough way to
[37:28] where they want you to begin to examine
[37:29] something in this other light so to
[37:32] speak and you start thinking oh wow I
[37:35] never thought of it that way oh my
[37:37] goodness this is really this is dark you
[37:40] know why they've taken you out of the
[37:42] light they've taken you into the Shadows
[37:44] they're manipulating your perception
[37:46] when you know somebody and you're
[37:47] familiar with somebody you trust
[37:48] somebody you're like oh I know that even
[37:50] if they did that that's not what they
[37:52] were intending to do I know that even if
[37:53] they did that they would make it right
[37:55] but like well on let me show you
[37:56] something take a step back
[37:58] look at this guy he's just a dog just a
[38:01] snake in the grass look at this and his
[38:02] life look at that and they start telling
[38:04] the story and before you know it you're
[38:05] like you know what from here in the
[38:08] shadows this guy looks like a really bad
[38:11] character he caused the woman to take a
[38:13] step back stop for a moment and do it so
[38:15] when she separated herself from God it
[38:17] gave the moment for doubt to arise and
[38:19] the act of the original sin was a
[38:22] deliberate an act of deliberate
[38:24] disassociation from
[38:26] God it was it was an act in that moment
[38:29] she could
[38:30] defy
[38:33] God so the the real the seduction takes
[38:37] place in her
[38:39] mind and then she acts because the dist
[38:42] the space to act has been granted to
[38:47] her
[38:50] now I feel like we're doing we're doing
[38:53] just fine with
[38:54] time but we're we're not going to go
[38:56] much further in this cuz I I know that
[38:57] there's a lot of substance to this a lot
[38:59] of heft and I think it's important for
[39:02] us to be able to ponder it uh afterwards
[39:05] without too much to chew on generally we
[39:07] could say sin can be defined as a
[39:11] violation of God's word some sort of a
[39:15] transgression of God's will generally
[39:18] sin would be a violation by action or
[39:21] omission of God's word 1 John 3:4 said
[39:25] whosoever committeth sin transgresses
[39:28] also the law for sin is the
[39:31] transgression of the
[39:33] law that Greek word that's used here for
[39:36] sin means simply to miss the mark he
[39:39] that misses the mark transgresses for to
[39:42] miss the Mark is the transgression of
[39:44] the law Noti this is what is required if
[39:46] you don't meet the requirements that's
[39:48] sin it's a rebellion or rejection of
[39:51] God's commandment it's a rejection of
[39:53] Truth you miss the mark sin in the New
[39:56] Testament the word is to miss the
[39:59] mark Genesis 3:1 going back to this
[40:02] original sin and he said who told thee
[40:05] that thou was naked Adam having already
[40:07] clothed himself still felt nakedness
[40:10] because he wasn't clothed in the manner
[40:11] that God chose to clothe him still FS
[40:14] nakedness and God says well who told you
[40:16] you were naked and God immediately
[40:18] Associates it with the ACT have you
[40:20] eaten of the tree that I commanded you
[40:23] not to eat
[40:25] of the the naked winess was only felt
[40:28] this this uh exposure this perversion
[40:32] this loss of innocence was only felt
[40:34] because he violated God's commandment so
[40:37] the eating was the fruit of a blatant
[40:40] disregard for God's
[40:42] commandment for the word I commanded you
[40:45] that's my word you transgressed that
[40:48] that's sin 1 Samuel chapter 15: 22- 24
[40:53] and Samuel said hath the Lord as great
[40:56] delight and burnt off offerings and
[40:57] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[40:59] the
[41:00] Lord in studying Saul last year when we
[41:03] went through it in great detail it's
[41:04] become more and more apparent to me the
[41:07] spirit of Saul is still alive and well
[41:10] today that instead of
[41:13] repenting what people want is uh
[41:17] pretense I don't know if you can respell
[41:20] repentance to s spell pretense you can
[41:22] misspell pretense with the same letters
[41:25] of repentance I like I think you
[41:28] your scrabble's not real your Scrabble
[41:29] game is not real strong here I think
[41:31] what you mean instead of this pretense
[41:33] is
[41:35] repentance and instead of saying they're
[41:37] sorry they just want to go to lunch with
[41:39] you right and go to lunch and you you go
[41:43] you're like thinking who did he go to
[41:44] lunch with who do you go to lunch
[41:45] with I thank God that I have not gone to
[41:48] lunch with any of you I baptized none of
[41:49] you except brother Edward there's this
[41:52] idea where it's just like let's just
[41:54] pretend nothing ever happened so it
[41:56] looked look s like everything's
[41:59] cool come let's let's Fellowship
[42:02] together let's offer sacri this is what
[42:04] he did with Samuel he said Samuel why
[42:06] don't you come preach for me so that
[42:08] everybody can see I'm still the legit
[42:11] King I'm Still A Guy I'm still in the
[42:13] circle everything's okay because since
[42:16] you're preaching for me since you're
[42:17] worshiping together with me everything's
[42:19] fine and all the bad things I did must
[42:22] be
[42:24] okay that's why it's only a false
[42:26] prophet that would have fallen for the
[42:29] invitation of the pretense that
[42:31] everything's
[42:33] cool this this example in this Cara
[42:35] character study of Saul is very
[42:37] important for us to not fall to the same
[42:39] things to where if you need to make
[42:40] something right on it and say I'm sorry
[42:42] for what I did make it right with the
[42:44] people you need to make it right with
[42:46] and not try to Garner some sort of uh uh
[42:49] clout by the way that you interact
[42:51] socially to say Well they're following
[42:53] me
[42:54] back see they follow that's how we know
[42:56] when something's gone wrong is when
[42:57] somebody unfollows somebody like oo so
[43:01] and so is in trouble so and so sto
[43:02] following them and then as soon as they
[43:04] fall in the back everything's okay no
[43:07] need no need for repentance no need for
[43:09] owning it no need for apologizing to
[43:11] people that have been hurt by it it's
[43:12] just let's just restore the status quo
[43:15] so that everything looks
[43:18] good I feel like I want to preach on
[43:20] Saul right
[43:24] now Sam that's the spirit Samuel's deal
[43:27] dealing
[43:28] with you think God loves your sacrifices
[43:31] of praise and your offerings of this and
[43:34] everything and not obeying the word
[43:37] behold to obey is better than
[43:40] sacrifice you living according to the
[43:42] word of God is better than you shouting
[43:44] his
[43:45] name you honoring the word of God by
[43:48] doing what the messenger taught us to do
[43:50] is far better than shouting and praising
[43:53] and dancing
[43:58] for Rebellion is as the sin behold to
[44:01] obey is better than sacrifice and to
[44:03] hearken than the fat for Rebellion is as
[44:05] the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness
[44:08] is as iniquity and idolatry this is the
[44:10] part I really wanted to get to because
[44:11] thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord
[44:13] he hath also rejected thee from being
[44:15] King and Saul said unto the Samuel I
[44:17] have sinned really this false humility
[44:19] but humility but he's right I've
[44:20] transgressed the Commandment of the Lord
[44:23] and thy words then because I feared the
[44:26] people and OB oby their
[44:28] voice so humble Saul
[44:33] is but sin is to reject the word of God
[44:37] the Hebrew word here is that Catal in
[44:39] the sense of it same as in the Hebrew or
[44:41] the Greek missing the target to deviate
[44:43] from the right way to miss the goal I
[44:45] missed the mark you said to do this I
[44:48] Didn't Do
[44:49] It sin is rebellion it's Defiance
[44:53] against
[44:55] God sin is is not necessary in
[44:57] relationship to you and I because we
[45:00] could do things one to another and that
[45:01] may offend you and you might do
[45:03] something that offends me and we could
[45:04] work that out between ourselves and it's
[45:06] offense we could say it's a sin and it's
[45:08] to miss the Mark it's a transgression or
[45:10] it's an offense but here sin
[45:12] specifically is in relationship to
[45:14] God the words that are used of sin or
[45:17] trespass or Rebellion a pesot to revolt
[45:21] a transgression something that's twisted
[45:22] or crooked these are Avon and pesha
[45:25] these are words that describe the harara
[45:27] these words describe sin it's missing
[45:29] the mark but it's against God God's Mark
[45:32] I can't create some arbitrary standard
[45:34] and say well if you didn't wear blue
[45:35] suede shoes today you've sinned and
[45:37] everybody's like what do you mean we
[45:40] don't even know where to get Blue Suede
[45:41] Shoes
[45:43] anymore and and that but that's not what
[45:46] sin would be sin is to miss the mark its
[45:49] Defiance against God in Genesis 399
[45:52] Joseph is being seduced the attempt to
[45:54] seduce there's none greater in this
[45:56] house and I speaking of potier neither
[45:58] hath he kept anything back from me but
[46:01] thee because Thou Art his
[46:04] wife and Joseph doesn't rationalize to
[46:06] say I don't want to do this to him but
[46:08] he says how then can I do this great
[46:10] wickedness and sin against
[46:14] God he knew that this would be a sin
[46:16] against God that's what sin is
[46:18] wickedness is sin against God David and
[46:22] his repentance as we already read verse
[46:24] 5 51 Psalm 51:4 against thee thee only
[46:28] have I
[46:29] sinned there may be offenses and there
[46:31] may be hurts but when it comes to
[46:33] atonement when it comes to sin when it
[46:35] comes to transgression the sin that
[46:36] we're talking about I only against you
[46:39] have I done this evil in thy sight
[46:42] against thee and the only have I
[46:45] sinned when we act in Rebellion against
[46:49] God's word we sin against God not that
[46:51] others can't be hurt and not that we
[46:53] wouldn't owe others an apology but we
[46:55] must recognize that our sin is against
[47:00] God sins of action just as the woman was
[47:04] seduced and then acted these are ways in
[47:07] which we are caused to act in a way that
[47:10] rejects the word of
[47:12] God James chapter 4:1 17 puts it even in
[47:16] a different category therefore to him
[47:18] that knoweth to do good and doeth it not
[47:20] to him it is sin often we quote this
[47:23] scripture saying iniquity but it's to
[47:25] him it is sin
[47:28] what does it show a lack of
[47:30] respect to know to do good and not do it
[47:33] to know to do righteousness to know to
[47:34] do well is that not what God Said to
[47:37] Cain in the beginning if thou doest well
[47:38] you'll be accepted but if not sin right
[47:41] if you don't act sin lies at the door
[47:43] what is this sin the refusal to do good
[47:47] to know to do good and not do it is
[47:51] sin at at the very least it's an
[47:53] attitude of indifference doesn't matter
[47:57] some sort of apathy or as the Bible puts
[47:58] it in Revelations 3:15 and 16
[48:04] lukewarmness because Thou Art lukewarm
[48:07] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[48:08] out of my
[48:09] mouth I'm hoping to in the next couple
[48:13] Services uh
[48:16] uh expose the make believer as it
[48:22] were because and again I never desired
[48:25] to preach to the make believer
[48:29] but it's important for us to recognize
[48:31] that the make
[48:33] believer and I'm giv the whole sermon
[48:35] away so maybe this is it right here got
[48:38] five seconds the make believer is the
[48:41] unbeliever with makeup
[48:44] on does that work should we just break
[48:46] that out put part 18 or whatever it is
[48:49] on a 5 Second let's do a YouTube short
[48:53] there it is and we could do one on
[48:54] shorts
[48:58] because Thou Art
[49:01] lukewarm I'll spew thee out of my
[49:04] mouth to know to do good and not do it
[49:06] that is sin through acts of commission
[49:09] or
[49:11] Omission we can do something that
[49:13] is born of
[49:18] sin now this is my this is my
[49:22] conclusion sin at its roots you want to
[49:25] say what is Sin Sin at its roots root is
[49:30] unbelief what is sin sin is UN belief
[49:36] correct now I believe that scripturally
[49:38] it's obvious I believe as message
[49:41] Believers it's very familiar to
[49:45] know what sin is we would all say sin is
[49:48] unbelief and these things of adultery
[49:50] and fornication and smoking and drinking
[49:52] all those are attributes of sin but do
[49:55] you realize the devil hates the idea
[49:58] that sin would be exposed as and its NE
[50:01] in its naked form is just merely
[50:05] unbelief it's actually uh an assailed
[50:09] truth something that should be
[50:11] established in our faith and in our in
[50:13] our convictions in this end time that to
[50:16] sin is to
[50:18] disbelieve sin at its root is a miscar
[50:20] isation or Corruption of our faith in
[50:23] God and his character if faith is a
[50:26] deliberate confidence in the character
[50:28] of God when you don't understand it and
[50:30] you're not sure what the outcome would
[50:32] be if faith is some sort of trust and
[50:34] Fidelity to God who whose ways you don't
[50:37] always understand then sin would be a
[50:40] mistrust in that God Amen a Corruption
[50:44] of our Fidelity and our faith in God 1
[50:47] John 5: 16-1 17 If any man see his
[50:51] brother sin a sin which is not unto
[50:53] death wow that's uh that's interesting
[50:56] he shall ask and he shall give him life
[50:58] for them that sin not unto
[51:01] death there is a sin unto
[51:06] death what a language I I'm not trying
[51:09] to unpack this and give us more
[51:10] understanding of what Sins Not unto
[51:12] death may be he says I do not say that
[51:14] he shall pray for
[51:16] it all unrighteousness is sin and there
[51:19] is a sin not unto death I love how he's
[51:23] showing that there's all in
[51:24] righteousness is sin and there's things
[51:27] that we realize we work on we pray for
[51:29] these these are things that we're
[51:30] working through we have Grace for one
[51:32] another but unbelief if I could just say
[51:34] it outright unbelief is the sin of unto
[51:39] death it is the original
[51:43] sin from which the Disobedience was
[51:46] born
[51:48] unbelief she Eve had def first the woman
[51:51] had to first
[51:52] disbelieve before she could ever act now
[51:56] can can there be forgiveness for the ACT
[51:57] can there be forgiveness for this can
[51:58] there be forgiveness for that well
[52:00] there's sins that are onto death but how
[52:03] can you be forgiven of
[52:07] unbelief in
[52:10] unbelief when somebody asks for
[52:12] forgiveness it's like will you forgive
[52:13] me for punching you right like yes yes
[52:17] yes yes yes right some point it just
[52:19] doesn't make sense like I don't believe
[52:21] you at all forgive me forgive me but I
[52:24] don't believe you man it's like well
[52:25] there you can't forgive unbelief notice
[52:27] this in John 16:17 and9 nevertheless I
[52:30] tell you the truth it is expedient for
[52:32] you that I go away for if I go not away
[52:34] the comforter will not come unto you but
[52:36] if I depart I will send him unto you and
[52:38] when he has come he will reprove the
[52:41] world of sin he says he will reprove the
[52:43] world of righteousness and of judgment
[52:45] SEC the next verses and 10 uh he gets
[52:48] into what the righteousness and judgment
[52:49] is but he will reprove the world of sin
[52:52] because they believe not on me
[52:57] it could easily be said he will reprove
[52:59] the world because they did not believe
[53:01] on me unbelief is called sin by
[53:05] Christ why because unbelief is the root
[53:08] it is the sap it is the power of all
[53:13] sin unbelief we could say is the head of
[53:16] the serpent that Christ was to
[53:18] crush in John
[53:20] 3:36 he that believeth on the son hath
[53:23] everlasting life and he that believeth
[53:24] not the son shall not see life
[53:27] but the wrath of God abideth on him
[53:29] simply put the unbelieving will not see
[53:33] life he that does not believe unbelief
[53:36] keeps us from Life unbelief Keeps Us
[53:39] under the wrath of God John 8:24 I said
[53:43] therefore unto you that you shall die in
[53:44] your sins what does that mean for if you
[53:46] believe not that I am he you shall die
[53:49] in your sins in other words the sin is
[53:51] not believing who he
[53:54] is how can we work the mighty works of
[53:57] God believe in him whom he hath sent
[53:58] this is the work this is the primary do
[54:01] you realize that many people at that day
[54:03] will come with a lot of other good
[54:04] things to show for themselves but they
[54:06] still hold in their hearts an evil heart
[54:08] of
[54:10] unbelief they still have a shortcoming
[54:13] of not believing the word of
[54:17] God I was thinking of it I was going to
[54:20] actually make the comment looking at the
[54:22] song Falling In Love With Jesus and it
[54:24] just been preparing my heart to minister
[54:26] on on what it means to fall in love with
[54:28] Jesus and loving Jesus and you know the
[54:30] question sometimes is what is love but
[54:33] really the question anymore is who's
[54:36] that Jesus you're in love
[54:38] with because it's not the one of the
[54:45] word if you do not
[54:48] believe you cannot be you cannot
[54:50] disbelieve and be
[54:52] delivered Hebrews 3: 12 and 13 take heed
[54:56] brethren unless there be any of any of
[54:58] you in any of you an evil heart of
[55:01] unbelief in departing from the Living
[55:03] God so unbelief gives cause to
[55:06] distancing leaving God there's your
[55:08] seduction through unbelief you depart
[55:10] from the Living God but exhort one
[55:12] another daily why is called today lest
[55:14] any of you be hardened through the
[55:16] deceitfulness of sin that is the
[55:18] delusion of
[55:21] unbelief that's the beautiful one say
[55:23] Lord I believe help thou my unbelief
[55:27] there's the there's the real
[55:30] understanding because there's this
[55:32] delusion of unbelief that's completely
[55:34] solidly fine in that state of unbelief
[55:38] it's the evil heart of unbelief what is
[55:40] it sin so he calls it the deceitfulness
[55:42] of sin because unbelief is sin verses 17
[55:46] and 19 but with whom was he grieved for
[55:48] 40 years was it not them that had sinned
[55:50] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[55:52] so at issue and the question is sin and
[55:54] to whom swear he that they should not
[55:56] enter into his rest but to them that
[55:58] believe not it's the same thing so we
[56:01] see that they could not enter in because
[56:03] of sin the Bible says they could not
[56:05] enter in because of
[56:07] unbelief sin is
[56:12] unbelief it's a mistrust in
[56:18] God sin
[56:20] is
[56:24] unbelief that's what it is
[56:28] amen I hope it kind of gets real in a
[56:31] positive
[56:32] way that when you find yourself quote
[56:35] unquote
[56:37] sinning if it's to those in in
[56:41] fornication those in
[56:44] lust those in activities or thought
[56:47] processes indulgences whatever it might
[56:50] be find yourself in
[56:52] sin what a what an opening to find that
[56:57] my problem is is I don't trust God who's
[57:00] absolutely
[57:02] trustworthy it's not trusting yourself
[57:05] not trusting the church or the preacher
[57:06] it's not trusting in a man and I believe
[57:08] this is one of the reasons why the word
[57:10] in our day is so direct and so explicit
[57:13] I can trust the word of
[57:16] God that's why the devil wants to change
[57:19] the conversation and to get you to step
[57:21] back a little bit and begin to question
[57:23] other things and in doing so you're not
[57:25] actually questioning your humanity and
[57:27] you're not questioning your sanity he's
[57:28] wanting you to question
[57:31] God God whose word is true and
[57:34] real in Mark chap 13:22 for false
[57:38] christs and false prophets shall arise
[57:40] and show signs and wonders we read it in
[57:43] Matthew it says to deceive but here it
[57:44] says to to seduce if it were possible
[57:47] even the
[57:48] elect seduction is Satan's goal but what
[57:52] is he what is the ultimate goal what is
[57:54] he trying to do he's trying to bring us
[57:55] to place of
[57:57] unbelief his purpose for seduction is to
[58:00] bring us to a place of a lack of
[58:02] trust whether we begin to act in
[58:05] lukewarmness or apathetic or whether we
[58:07] begin to do those things which are the
[58:09] fruits of unrighteousness at the heart
[58:11] of it is I want to create distance
[58:13] between you and God I want to change
[58:15] your perception of God I either want you
[58:17] to mischaracterize his character as
[58:19] being a god who's too restrictive or the
[58:21] god of the word the god of the Bible is
[58:24] a is a false picture of a a deity that
[58:26] ought to be the Sovereign over all who
[58:29] is just kind of a aqi or something in
[58:31] The Ether and and paint a different
[58:34] picture of God if he could just do that
[58:36] that's the unbelief that's the Seduction
[58:38] That Satan wants to
[58:41] achieve he's a Seducer and he is
[58:44] seducing
[58:46] Society on Sensational levels that we've
[58:49] never
[58:54] seen and the sedu
[59:01] is
[59:03] ineffective on those that
[59:07] believe it's not that he's able to
[59:10] work but ultimately the elect are secure
[59:14] why because having been born
[59:16] again they've given access to the
[59:19] freedom to not commit
[59:23] sin just going to point to it real quick
[59:26] that's why the Paradox of if you say you
[59:28] have not sinned then the truth is not in
[59:30] you to I have I I do not sin I have no
[59:35] sin to
[59:37] seduce Satan's goal is to seduce us to a
[59:40] place of
[59:47] unbelief Satan's entire
[59:49] system his entire system is set
[59:52] up to cause us to disbelieve God's word
[59:56] right that's been his system from the
[59:58] very
[59:59] beginning is he trying to get you to uh
[1:00:02] uh to do bad things well that
[1:00:06] happens if he can get us to
[1:00:08] disbelief because notice how he's just
[1:00:10] as effective in getting keeping people
[1:00:12] from doing quote unquote bad things but
[1:00:14] still in unbelief because his goal is
[1:00:17] sin and sin is
[1:00:20] unbelief Satan's always using the same
[1:00:22] tactic his system is to fight against
[1:00:25] the word of God and so what is God's
[1:00:27] power what is God's uh safety the
[1:00:32] word God help
[1:00:34] us to not fall for Satan's tricks and
[1:00:37] his devices be seduced keep this close
[1:00:40] to your heart always remembering this
[1:00:43] how that
[1:00:44] Satan his Art of Seduction is to cause
[1:00:47] you to view God
[1:00:49] differently and in viewing God
[1:00:51] differently it creates distance and that
[1:00:53] gives the space that we need to act on
[1:00:56] our own
[1:00:58] that's and this unbelief that's at the
[1:01:01] heart of it and it's a truth that God
[1:01:02] brought to us at this hour Brother Brad
[1:01:03] and preached that unbelief is sin sin is
[1:01:07] unbelief because it's the
[1:01:09] truth it's a truth that we must
[1:01:12] hold and it's a truth that's necessary
[1:01:14] to understand if we're going to
[1:01:15] completely overcome in this age Satan's
[1:01:18] seduction let's stand together today
[1:01:21] we'll just pray with
[1:01:23] you enjoy some time of worship
[1:01:31] worship there's a song that was sung at
[1:01:33] youth camps I know in Days Gone By The
[1:01:35] Devil Is A sly old Fox if I could catch
[1:01:38] him I'd put him in a box lock the box
[1:01:41] and throw away the key for all the
[1:01:43] tricks he played on
[1:01:44] me and if it was just that easy as
[1:01:47] catching a fox boy that would
[1:01:49] be I I'd become a fox
[1:01:52] Hunter I'd use whatever bait I could I
[1:01:55] would use whatever means
[1:02:00] possible but part of the seduction is
[1:02:03] making us think that well I'm going to I
[1:02:06] can catch the devil but God is saying do
[1:02:08] you realize why the phrase only
[1:02:11] believe anymore has become a bad word
[1:02:15] predestination became a a curse word to
[1:02:18] Pentecostals why because it it exposed
[1:02:21] the erors of their
[1:02:24] Theology and anymore to just believe the
[1:02:27] word has become like a cuss word I want
[1:02:30] to believe God's word I want to believe
[1:02:32] God's word well that's all he's asked
[1:02:33] you to
[1:02:35] do he'll take care of the rest if you
[1:02:38] want to be real if you don't want to
[1:02:39] just be a an unbeliever with makeup on
[1:02:42] take God at his word amen let's bow our
[1:02:46] heads and
[1:02:47] pray if anyone here finds himself in a
[1:02:51] place where they can be honest they
[1:02:54] haven't trusted the Lord
[1:02:57] and that the source of their problems
[1:02:58] the origin of the fruits of sin or
[1:03:00] unrighteousness in their lives is a lack
[1:03:03] of
[1:03:04] trust listen I get it if you don't trust
[1:03:08] me get it within my own family with my
[1:03:10] children if I've done anything to offend
[1:03:12] them where they don't completely fully
[1:03:13] trust me but you you've got to come to a
[1:03:16] place where you trust
[1:03:19] God that's the space the devil wants to
[1:03:22] create is just a little bit of mistrust
[1:03:24] paint a different picture he's an artist
[1:03:26] who can paint a picture so
[1:03:29] convincing so
[1:03:31] seducing that you'll believe a
[1:03:35] lie and it's become that's the source
[1:03:38] that's at the root of
[1:03:40] problems God help us to not fall victim
[1:03:42] to his seduction if there's any of us
[1:03:44] today who've been seduced Lord get our
[1:03:47] attention rescue us Lord we come to you
[1:03:51] with our hearts just being open I just
[1:03:54] encourage you to pray respond to him in
[1:03:55] whatever way that you know how Lord
[1:03:58] forgive me for my unfaithfulness Lord
[1:04:00] forgive me for my stubbornness forgive
[1:04:02] me for being seduced whatever it might
[1:04:04] be that you could do today with our
[1:04:05] heads bowed our gracious Heavenly
[1:04:08] Father we love you we thank you for your
[1:04:12] word Lord we know that the Bible
[1:04:15] contains many difficult passages we know
[1:04:17] that the word is often
[1:04:19] preached and it feels as if it is a
[1:04:21] sword that's
[1:04:23] cutting we feel the sternness and the
[1:04:25] hardness of
[1:04:27] it there so many examples of your your
[1:04:30] passion
[1:04:32] Lord so many examples of your your
[1:04:35] righteous indignation your Justice and
[1:04:38] your
[1:04:40] Fury but truly
[1:04:43] Lord that's just another side of your
[1:04:46] love for your compassion and your
[1:04:50] mercy your forgiveness and your
[1:04:53] patience the tenderness with which you
[1:04:56] lead us and guide us the way that you
[1:04:58] chose to spoke to us
[1:05:00] today Lord it it comforts
[1:05:03] me and father I pray that I can only
[1:05:07] speak for myself Lord as I utter
[1:05:11] this Lord I don't want unbelief to
[1:05:13] hinder
[1:05:15] me and I know unbelief will certainly
[1:05:18] hinder
[1:05:20] you father at what time I am tempted at
[1:05:23] what time I am being led astray and I'm
[1:05:25] being seduced may I recall that at its
[1:05:28] naked in its naked form I'm not trusting
[1:05:31] you in the
[1:05:33] moment and let me put praise upon my
[1:05:35] lips let me turn my eyes to you let me
[1:05:37] do all those things that could be
[1:05:39] indicative of one who recognizes the
[1:05:42] situation and is turning their trust
[1:05:44] towards
[1:05:45] you Lord I don't want the pretense of
[1:05:48] Praise I don't want
[1:05:50] the the popularity of partnership with
[1:05:53] other preachers Lord I I want I want to
[1:05:56] have this sincerity of
[1:05:59] heart for I believe you Lord I trust in
[1:06:03] you and I'm not looking
[1:06:05] for uh uh support Lord I'm not looking
[1:06:08] to external things to try to
[1:06:11] rally people around me so that I can
[1:06:13] feel secure in my relationship with you
[1:06:15] and my position but Lord I want to trust
[1:06:16] you even if I Stand Alone Lord even if
[1:06:20] it seems your promises are delayed Lord
[1:06:23] why why should I question you why should
[1:06:25] I without
[1:06:26] you lord I don't want to be like Peter
[1:06:29] that
[1:06:29] day in the dead of the night as the
[1:06:32] morning was
[1:06:33] Dawning in my fear and my lack of
[1:06:37] trust denying your supreme
[1:06:39] authority questioning your
[1:06:42] promise disassociating myself from
[1:06:46] you Lord I want to prove I'm not like
[1:06:48] that woman in the garden who allowed
[1:06:50] just in a moment to
[1:06:51] stop and through seduction create enough
[1:06:54] space for me to act act on my own to do
[1:06:58] things that are not
[1:07:00] right I guess it's enough to blame the
[1:07:02] devil all we want but truly I must take
[1:07:04] accountability for myself and not point
[1:07:06] at the Devil but say Lord forgive me
[1:07:08] I've been seduced forgive me Father in
[1:07:10] my weakness I've done something
[1:07:13] wrong Lord I want to prove I'm not like
[1:07:15] that woman I can stand the
[1:07:21] test we come to you today Lord with an
[1:07:24] open heart with a desire to be be washed
[1:07:25] to be purged to truly walk in that
[1:07:28] Liberty that you've given us this
[1:07:29] Freedom which is freedom not to sin by
[1:07:33] nature and by this new birth Lord as we
[1:07:36] have many scriptures that maybe get to
[1:07:38] another time lord if how by faith in you
[1:07:41] or we are made free by Faith by
[1:07:44] believing because unbelief is dead we
[1:07:48] have faith that
[1:07:50] liberates bless us I pray today as we
[1:07:53] are dismissed our visitors each one that
[1:07:55] was with us our youth meeting
[1:07:57] upcoming bless our fellowship Lord
[1:07:59] outside these walls may it be sweet Lord
[1:08:03] that we Fellowship in a manner that
[1:08:04] brings you glory we ask all this in the
[1:08:07] name of Lord Jesus Christ amen
