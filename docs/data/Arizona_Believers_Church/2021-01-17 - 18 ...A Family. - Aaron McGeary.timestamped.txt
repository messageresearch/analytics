[0:00] matthew chapter 19 i'm going to begin
[0:01] with verse 4
[0:04] and it is a difficult subject i'll say
[0:07] this
[0:07] um you know don't premeditate where i'm
[0:10] going with this subject matter even
[0:11] once i'm an hour into it don't assume
[0:14] assume the point i'm trying to make just
[0:15] let the lord speak to your heart
[0:17] matthew chapter 19 and we'll
[0:21] we'll just start with verse three the
[0:22] pharisees also came unto him tempting
[0:24] him and saying unto him
[0:25] is it lawful for a man to put away his
[0:27] wife for every cause
[0:30] and he answered and said unto them have
[0:32] you not read
[0:33] that he which made them at the beginning
[0:35] made them
[0:36] male and female and said for this cause
[0:39] shall a man leave
[0:40] father and mother and shall cleave to
[0:42] his wife that they twain shall be one
[0:44] flesh
[0:46] wherefore they are no more twain but one
[0:48] flesh
[0:49] therefore god hath joined together let
[0:51] no man put asunder
[0:53] and so he hasn't exactly answered their
[0:56] question
[0:57] but he's provoked them to ask another
[0:59] one and they said unto him why did moses
[1:01] then command to give a writing of
[1:03] divorcement to put her away
[1:06] he saith unto them moses because of the
[1:07] hardness of your hearts
[1:09] suffered you to put away your wives but
[1:11] from the beginning it was not so
[1:14] amen what a powerful statement from the
[1:16] beginning it was not so
[1:18] daniel chapter 4 and
[1:22] i was
[1:27] going to read more than what uh what i
[1:30] ultimately put on that slide so i just
[1:32] need to kind of check where i'm at here
[1:34] sorry
[1:35] so let's just read verses 33 and 34
[1:38] daniel had already prophesied
[1:40] and interpreted the dream and
[1:44] of even nebuchadnezzar being a tree and
[1:46] being likened unto a tree
[1:48] and then it says and that this madness
[1:51] would come upon him daniel chapter
[1:52] 4 verse 33 the same hour was the thing
[1:55] fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar
[1:57] and he was driven from men and did eat
[1:59] grass his oxen and his body was wet
[2:02] with the dew of heaven that means he
[2:03] slept out in the open
[2:05] and his body was wet with the dew of
[2:07] heaven until his hairs were grown like
[2:08] eagle's
[2:09] feathers so he had not cut his hair and
[2:11] it began to get so long it looked
[2:13] animal-like and his nails like bird's
[2:15] claws
[2:16] and at the end of the days of nebuch
[2:18] days i
[2:19] nebuchadnezzar now this is his testimony
[2:21] lifted up mine eyes into heaven
[2:23] and my understanding returned unto me
[2:26] and i blessed the most high and i
[2:27] praised and
[2:28] honored him that liveth forever whose
[2:30] dominion is an everlasting dominion
[2:32] and his kingdom is from generation to
[2:35] generation
[2:36] amen you may be seated
[2:42] if you could remember we have a youth
[2:44] meeting scheduled for the end of the
[2:46] month january 31st on sunday afternoon
[2:49] you're welcome to come and be a part of
[2:51] that especially the young people and
[2:52] we're looking forward to that time of
[2:54] fellowship together
[2:55] i'm continuing on the subject of a
[2:57] family
[2:59] and the lord just really in a very very
[3:02] direct way kind of focused me in on
[3:05] some particular things that are very
[3:07] fundamental and foundational
[3:09] for the understanding of family and even
[3:11] who we are
[3:13] and i have a very uh specific burden in
[3:17] my heart
[3:18] and i trust that as we just stay to what
[3:20] god has placed upon
[3:22] uh uh me to deliver that just that
[3:25] burden will be released
[3:26] and that he'll speak very particularly
[3:28] to your hearts and i want to just jump
[3:30] in
[3:30] uh to the subject matter but say this at
[3:32] the outset
[3:34] there's going to be different subject
[3:35] matters that we might
[3:37] that could be triggers to us that as
[3:38] soon as it comes up we start thinking
[3:40] in our minds well it's going to go this
[3:42] way or it's going to go that way but
[3:44] let's just try to
[3:44] withhold any any assumptions or any
[3:47] presumptions about where the subject
[3:49] matter may be going you say oh well he's
[3:51] read the scripture on marriage and
[3:52] divorce or he's read the
[3:53] he's talking about this he's talking
[3:54] about that let's just look at it as
[3:56] foundational
[3:57] because it's very simple very
[3:58] foundational in some ways i've
[4:01] pondered that it could come off as just
[4:03] being
[4:04] so elementary that the point could be
[4:07] missed but i trust god will speak to
[4:08] your heart through this and i just want
[4:09] to jump right in at genesis chapter 1
[4:12] verse 27 and look at this principle
[4:15] of god when he began to create in the
[4:18] beginning
[4:19] and we know that in the beginning god
[4:20] created and we're using this
[4:22] a family verse 27
[4:26] so god created man in his own image in
[4:29] the image of god
[4:30] created he him male and female
[4:34] created he them now this is a very
[4:36] unique
[4:37] description of man as he has been
[4:39] created man here
[4:40] is the hebrew word adam that became the
[4:43] proper name
[4:44] um for adam he is known as adam but the
[4:47] word
[4:48] adam it means mankind so speaking god
[4:50] created amen
[4:51] but this was representative of humanity
[4:54] and then this statement he says
[4:56] he creates them in the image of god in
[4:58] the likeness of god
[4:59] and it says male and female created he
[5:02] them so male and female
[5:04] are now raised up as a designation but
[5:07] it's
[5:07] tied to and connected to the image of
[5:10] god so male and female are going to
[5:11] manifest the image
[5:13] and the purpose of god and the word male
[5:16] in the hebrew comes from the root to
[5:18] remember to call to mind
[5:20] so there's something about this
[5:21] designation that is important the word
[5:23] for
[5:24] female as comes from the root to pierce
[5:26] or to a point or to bore through
[5:28] and so these are these are words that
[5:30] are given to the
[5:31] to mankind to humanity which is now in
[5:34] one
[5:35] uh one spiritual supernatural being
[5:38] it wasn't a fleshly being that would
[5:40] have male and female characteristics but
[5:42] it was a spirit being
[5:44] that uh was representative of humanity
[5:46] and within humanity there's going to be
[5:48] male and female and we know how
[5:50] brilliant deals with this very
[5:51] specifically about a masculine spirit a
[5:53] feminine spirit
[5:54] the spirit of adam and the spirit of the
[5:56] woman and so
[5:58] this designation that god gives the man
[6:01] or humanity
[6:02] this distinction is not made with
[6:04] respect to animal life
[6:06] there's no place where he says god
[6:08] created a male deer and he created a
[6:09] female deer this this is not made
[6:12] this is a distinction that's not made or
[6:13] not verbalized or written or pointed out
[6:16] and it signifies that god has a higher
[6:18] purpose for the creation of man
[6:20] these things can be assumed about animal
[6:22] life but when god creates
[6:23] man he actually mentions the distinction
[6:26] and he shows this division because it's
[6:28] significant
[6:29] about humankind and so god
[6:32] wanted to highlight these differences
[6:34] because the difference between male and
[6:35] female
[6:36] would have a greater utility and a
[6:38] greater expression in
[6:39] mankind than it did in animal life
[6:43] and this is the statement that i was
[6:45] that had inspired me
[6:47] to go into family relationships and the
[6:50] family
[6:51] the relationships among members of a
[6:52] family
[6:54] and what those roles and
[6:55] responsibilities are but god just kind
[6:57] of backed me up to say let's start
[6:59] with the foundation of where we derive
[7:02] our roles and responsibilities and and
[7:04] what comes first what precedes
[7:06] the assumption of certain offices and
[7:08] certain responsibilities as men or women
[7:10] or brother or sister
[7:12] and it's he says this in the right
[7:14] system the laodicean church age herein
[7:16] is now set forth the love of god he
[7:19] desired in love
[7:20] a family of his own this is what god
[7:23] wanted in the beginning
[7:24] he wanted a family of his own he says a
[7:26] family of sons
[7:28] sons like himself so this is something
[7:31] that god desired god did not just want
[7:33] to have
[7:33] a sandbox that he could play in uh he
[7:36] didn't view the world
[7:37] as as his own lego set uh or or
[7:40] playmobil he
[7:41] he looked at this as something that he
[7:43] wanted to have fellowship with to have
[7:45] union with
[7:46] he wanted to have a family god's desire
[7:49] in love
[7:50] love was his unction to have a family of
[7:52] his own
[7:53] sons like himself a family of sons and
[7:56] so
[7:56] when it comes to mankind he designates
[7:59] them
[8:00] male and female and so this is answering
[8:02] to god's desire
[8:04] to have a family like himself or that he
[8:07] could dwell in and be identified in
[8:10] and it's likely that there was male and
[8:12] female within
[8:13] a multiple let me say that way it's
[8:16] likely that there were multiple couples
[8:18] amongst animal life that there wasn't
[8:20] just one male deer
[8:21] and one female there it's likely that
[8:23] god created many males and many females
[8:25] when he created
[8:26] animal life because they were created
[8:28] and they were to fill up and replenish
[8:30] the seas and spread all over the earth
[8:32] but when it comes to mankind he doesn't
[8:34] create multiple males and multiple
[8:36] female
[8:37] it's one spiritual being that we see
[8:39] later becomes
[8:40] male and female in flesh and and this is
[8:43] significant there's only one couple one
[8:45] pair
[8:46] in genesis chapter five verse two it
[8:48] says male and female created he them
[8:50] and blessed them and called their name
[8:53] adam
[8:54] in the day when they were created so now
[8:57] in the day that they're created
[8:58] initially they're one spirit
[9:00] as we've been looking at in genesis
[9:02] chapter two god takes that one spirit
[9:04] and puts it in a body a fleshly body
[9:06] then from that body god separates from
[9:10] that
[9:10] that physical unit and that fleshly unit
[9:12] god separates
[9:14] out the the other part the female part
[9:17] so that you have this representation of
[9:18] male and female
[9:20] and when god does this and he and he
[9:22] emphasizes it again in genesis chapter 5
[9:24] verse 2 as we read
[9:26] all of humanity now is designed to come
[9:29] from a single couple
[9:31] this is how god established it in the
[9:33] beginning there would be one male and
[9:34] one female
[9:35] so if all come from the one male and the
[9:38] one female then
[9:39] every human that would have been upon
[9:41] the face of the earth
[9:42] would have all been part of one family
[9:46] and so you would have one family you
[9:47] would have one head of the family they
[9:49] would all descend from a common
[9:51] ancestor and that's what makes a family
[9:54] all the descendants of a common ancestor
[9:56] so if you only had one pair you only
[9:58] have one family there's no other species
[10:00] there's no other genus
[10:01] it's just a family and there's no
[10:03] variation among the rep
[10:05] of the expression there's no variance in
[10:07] the seed and if there's no variance in
[10:09] the seed
[10:09] there's no there's no differing dna this
[10:12] is just all the expression
[10:13] of one life one seed coming from one
[10:16] couple
[10:17] and it was god's desire then in
[10:18] establishing it this way that it was to
[10:20] be the seed of god
[10:22] as a family that you wouldn't have adam
[10:25] and the woman and they have a family and
[10:26] then you have somebody else and they
[10:28] become a family
[10:28] and that god is somehow divided and it
[10:31] creates rivalry and it
[10:32] creates distinctions and differences
[10:34] amongst all the the children of god in
[10:36] the garden of eden he envisioned
[10:38] man and woman and in the way that he
[10:40] laid it out and the orders and the
[10:41] commands he gave
[10:42] any child that would have come forth
[10:44] would have all been of the same family
[10:46] of the same dna
[10:49] and in genesis chapter 7 verse 3
[10:52] speaking of animal life
[10:54] in the days when they were to be taken
[10:56] upon the ark
[10:57] it says the fowls and also of the air by
[10:59] sevens
[11:00] the male and the female and it mentions
[11:02] it prior uh
[11:04] about the beast it creatures upon the
[11:05] earth but this phrasing is what i wanted
[11:07] to identify
[11:08] to keep seed alive upon the face of all
[11:10] the earth
[11:11] so this is the purpose of the male and
[11:13] the female to keep the seed alive
[11:16] upon the face of all the earth god
[11:18] wanted them to have fowl of the air by
[11:20] sevens male and female so you'd have the
[11:22] male and female
[11:23] couples and he says because we need male
[11:25] and female in order for that
[11:27] seed for that specie to be maintained
[11:30] and preserved in all the earth
[11:32] so that's the role of male and female it
[11:34] was to to replicate to pass on i even
[11:37] look at that in the sense the male
[11:39] is to remember or to call to mind that
[11:41] when a when a sun would come forth you
[11:43] would
[11:43] remember call to mind the very seed the
[11:46] dna the progenitor
[11:47] the ancestor from which it descended so
[11:50] male and females to keep seed alive
[11:53] now notice what it says in malachi
[11:55] chapter 2 verses 14 to 16.
[12:02] it says yet say ye wherefore because the
[12:05] lord hath been witness between thee and
[12:07] the wife of thy youth
[12:09] against whom thou hast dealt
[12:10] treacherously
[12:12] yet is she thy companion and the wife of
[12:14] thy covenant
[12:15] so again this is malachi dealing with
[12:17] the issue of divorce
[12:19] and in these men's hearts and these
[12:21] israelites hearts the fact that divorce
[12:24] was made attractive to them because they
[12:26] could put away one and marry another
[12:29] if they had to put it away and then they
[12:31] wouldn't have anyone to look out after
[12:32] them then they probably would just put
[12:33] up with the one that they had
[12:35] but it's because of the promise and what
[12:37] they felt was the exemption that they
[12:39] could have another
[12:40] that they dealt treacherously with their
[12:41] wife the wife of their youth the wife of
[12:43] the covenant
[12:44] and so they would put away one and marry
[12:45] another now he says this now catch how
[12:48] malachi now in teaching on rebuking
[12:51] israel
[12:52] and their the men for these practices he
[12:54] says did not he
[12:55] make one yet had he the residue
[12:59] of the spirit and wherefore one or why
[13:02] one
[13:02] that he might seek a godly seed
[13:06] therefore take heed to your spirit and
[13:07] let none deal treacherously against the
[13:09] white
[13:10] wife of his youth he wants to use the
[13:12] image that god established in the
[13:13] beginning
[13:14] how that god created one man and one
[13:16] woman and the reason why he did it
[13:18] as instruction rebuke correction and
[13:20] instruction
[13:21] to men to say this is what god showed in
[13:23] the beginning
[13:24] this is why god did it so don't deal
[13:27] treacherously with the wife of thy youth
[13:29] and be harsh and bitter towards her for
[13:31] the lord god
[13:33] for the lord the god of israel saith
[13:35] that he
[13:36] hateth putting away for one covert
[13:39] violence with his garment and you
[13:41] deal harshly with your wife and you and
[13:43] you treat her wrong and you
[13:45] and you cover up uh the way that you
[13:48] treat your wife
[13:48] with this garment of justification i
[13:50] could put her away and take another one
[13:52] saith the lord of hosts therefore take
[13:53] heed your spirit that you deal not
[13:55] treacherously
[13:57] this this is a very uh a very direct and
[14:00] very specific challenge
[14:03] to the the corrupt heart of a man who
[14:05] would deal harshly
[14:07] and deal incorrectly with his wife and
[14:10] he's using again
[14:11] don't make any assumptions like some of
[14:13] you may be already there i know exactly
[14:14] where he's going with this
[14:17] well if it makes you uncomfortable i
[14:20] apologize but
[14:21] i'm not exactly sure where we'll end up
[14:24] so how can you know
[14:28] so and again if i'll say this now too
[14:31] there's there's no harshness in my heart
[14:34] there's no axe to grind
[14:36] there's nobody here i i that i'm
[14:38] conscious that needs correction so if it
[14:39] happens god's gonna do it with tender
[14:41] hands
[14:42] god's gonna do it the way that he
[14:43] intends to and the way he desires too
[14:45] the subject matter i'm facing is often
[14:47] preached with teeth clenched
[14:50] and with an anger and a and a sarcasm
[14:54] somehow suggesting uh that you know that
[14:56] the one
[14:57] you know they're throwing stones and
[14:59] they don't and they have a right to
[15:01] but this is not in my heart i'm not
[15:03] throwing stones i'm not judging
[15:04] i'm not trying to make a political point
[15:06] i'm not trying to uh make anybody feel
[15:08] uncomfortable i just want us to see
[15:10] these principles in the scripture
[15:12] and so god made this is how malachi's
[15:15] justifying what he's saying this is the
[15:16] inspiration
[15:17] god made one man and then one woman from
[15:20] that man and he says
[15:22] though he had the residue of the spirit
[15:24] you can see it there in verse 15 though
[15:26] he had the residue of the spirit
[15:28] even though he had the power because
[15:30] he's god to make many men
[15:32] and even though he had the power maybe
[15:34] to make one man and many women
[15:36] he didn't do that amen god could have
[15:38] done it
[15:39] but he didn't he made one man and then
[15:41] one woman from that man
[15:43] so he made one couple and one family
[15:46] and then he says this is why he did it
[15:48] why did he only have one man and one
[15:50] woman
[15:51] he ordained one male and one female so
[15:53] that he could have he says
[15:55] a godly seed
[15:58] so in this he said the purpose is that
[16:00] there would be some
[16:02] a holy offspring or a representation of
[16:06] god
[16:06] who is one who has all sorts of
[16:08] characteristics and attributes
[16:11] and manners of expression and he says if
[16:13] you vary that you don't get god
[16:16] that's what paul taught about christ
[16:17] there's many people preaching christ but
[16:19] there's not another
[16:20] so you can't have many christ you can
[16:22] only have one christ and so god wants to
[16:24] establish in the beginning that in order
[16:26] to have an
[16:27] image and likeness of him there has to
[16:29] be continuity of seed there has to be
[16:31] this harmony with the one who gives the
[16:33] life and so god says i want to show that
[16:36] this is how you produce the original
[16:38] this is how you replicate godliness and
[16:40] righteousness you stay in your channel
[16:43] and you and you stay behind the word of
[16:45] god he says he ordained only one male
[16:47] and one female
[16:48] so that it would have a righteous
[16:50] representation and he would have a
[16:52] godly seed that's how you produce a
[16:54] godly seed
[16:55] this is how that you have sons likened
[16:57] to god
[16:59] this is what the scripture is
[17:00] specifically saying it was one man and
[17:02] one woman so that the seed would be
[17:03] godly
[17:04] you know you didn't have adam and then
[17:06] have many women and then he could have
[17:07] children by all the different women
[17:09] that would not produce a godly family
[17:13] now that could happen in animal life and
[17:15] that can happen is we're taught in
[17:17] marriage and divorce you could have
[17:18] one buck and many does and you can have
[17:20] one uh one male
[17:22] and many females through time that that
[17:24] bring forth
[17:25] different children that's okay in animal
[17:27] life that's okay
[17:28] amongst those living creatures but when
[17:30] it came to man god says you're different
[17:33] i'm going to establish this pattern i'm
[17:35] going to bring it forth so that there
[17:36] can be holy offspring that the image of
[17:38] god could be
[17:39] properly replicated so this is
[17:42] an eternal principle of god this does
[17:45] not change
[17:46] this is a divine attribute of god to be
[17:48] expressed in the original family
[17:49] structure
[17:50] one man one woman one family
[17:53] so this takes us now to where we were
[17:55] reading in matthew chapter 19.
[17:58] he's asked a question can a man put away
[18:00] his wife for any cause
[18:04] jesus doesn't say yes or no to that we
[18:06] know that he continues
[18:08] but in his initial and he deals with it
[18:11] in terms of
[18:12] what cause one could put away a woman
[18:14] for
[18:16] but he establishes this in the beginning
[18:18] before answering the question
[18:20] let's not look at the exception to the
[18:22] rule
[18:23] let's not look at how god had to
[18:25] establish something else
[18:27] to deal with the condition of man
[18:30] because just by way of analogy it could
[18:33] be a poor one but we can talk about it
[18:34] later
[18:35] that there's some that say we want to
[18:36] have a garden of eden diet and let's
[18:38] just go back to the garden of eden well
[18:39] i don't have a garden of eden body
[18:42] right so a garden of eden bought a body
[18:46] uh probably do well on a garden of
[18:47] eating diet but this post
[18:49] garden of eden body i would probably do
[18:52] better on a kosher diet because i can at
[18:54] least say this
[18:55] is a diet that god gave fallen man right
[18:58] i'm not
[18:58] doctrinally pushing any kind of way to
[19:00] eat
[19:01] does anybody know burritos is kosher
[19:05] and um and so there's this is something
[19:07] that god gave
[19:09] men his children a way of living
[19:12] that dealt with the consequences of the
[19:14] fall and so you find that god gives laws
[19:17] and he gives commands and he makes
[19:18] exceptions and he does things
[19:20] that pattern and that help and they want
[19:22] to bring men to the place of
[19:23] regeneration and new birth and
[19:24] redemption
[19:25] but once that happens all things become
[19:27] new and then there's certain things that
[19:29] you're not bound under because the
[19:31] remedy is there
[19:32] or or the the the breach that caused
[19:35] that has been dealt with
[19:36] does that mean am i making sense in that
[19:38] regards
[19:39] so when when this these commandments
[19:41] were given and these things are given
[19:43] and jesus deals with exceptions
[19:44] says before we get so narrowed in on the
[19:47] exception let's go back to god's
[19:49] original general rule and why there was
[19:52] even an
[19:53] exception granted because of it and it
[19:56] says in matthew chapter 19 verses 4
[19:58] to verse 6 and he answered and said unto
[20:00] them have you not read
[20:02] that he which made them at the beginning
[20:05] made them male and female
[20:07] this is almost exactly like what malachi
[20:09] says in chapter 2.
[20:11] have you not read did he not make one
[20:14] and he says and said once the woman
[20:17] comes forth in genesis 2
[20:18] he attributes this to god for this cause
[20:22] shall a man leave
[20:23] father and mother and shall cleave to
[20:25] his wife
[20:26] and they twain shall be one flesh he's
[20:29] using this image and raises this image
[20:31] up before them because now they're
[20:32] saying
[20:33] well can we do this and we have a right
[20:34] to do this and moses allowed us to do
[20:36] this he says
[20:37] all right before we deal with that let's
[20:38] go back to god's original representation
[20:41] and how did god set it forth in the
[20:43] beginning and to the jews
[20:44] they would have accepted yes that's
[20:46] exactly how we are taught in the word of
[20:48] god as moses did right
[20:49] that the man that there was male and
[20:51] female and he says wherefore they are no
[20:53] more twain but one flesh
[20:55] what therefore god hath joined together
[20:57] let no man put asunder
[20:59] now just by doing that this strikes them
[21:02] in such a way to where it's like
[21:04] whoa okay now how do we deal with this
[21:07] because now he's saying that god made
[21:09] one man one woman one male one female
[21:12] they he made them a couple and that they
[21:14] were to be one flesh
[21:15] and that this is god's joining this is
[21:17] god's design this is god's desire
[21:19] and he says what god's joined let no man
[21:21] put asunder because now they're
[21:22] realizing okay
[21:24] this is something that god has blessed
[21:25] this is something that's in the image of
[21:27] god
[21:28] and then they say then we're not allowed
[21:30] to break that image
[21:31] i'm just just maybe dramatizing their
[21:33] thought process i'm not
[21:34] teaching that this is this is absolutely
[21:37] you know i'm not trying to make that
[21:38] point to you that that's the way that it
[21:39] is
[21:40] this is how it strikes them so they're
[21:41] saying well then why did moses tell us
[21:44] we could
[21:45] because they're picking up what jesus is
[21:47] laying down
[21:49] that this is what god wants then he's
[21:52] then how come we were permitted
[21:54] and so this is what jesus presents adam
[21:57] was joined
[21:58] to one wife and when he was joined to
[22:01] one wife this is the very thing that
[22:02] jesus is bringing up before them he says
[22:04] in the beginning were they not one was
[22:07] there not one man and one woman
[22:08] and what are you showing there was no
[22:10] one else for adam to marry
[22:12] if he put her away so i i don't
[22:15] there was no there was no other option
[22:17] for adam this is the picture malachi's
[22:20] painting
[22:20] this is a picture that jesus is painting
[22:22] in the beginning
[22:23] he made there was one couple in the
[22:25] beginning male and female not one male
[22:27] and many females
[22:28] so that he could just put her away if
[22:29] adam had put her away then he couldn't
[22:32] do what god wanted him to do
[22:35] we're just just speaking about the facts
[22:38] and the reality of it not trying to read
[22:41] into it or make a point by it but
[22:42] adam in the beginning only had one wife
[22:45] so if he put her away there was no one
[22:47] else he could join himself to
[22:50] and this is because god desired one
[22:51] family in agreement in harmony
[22:54] of one flesh one spirit and so that was
[22:58] that was what god's desire was
[23:00] now the message satan's eden brother
[23:02] banham says and so god knew
[23:03] that we would be here but then he put us
[23:06] in flesh
[23:08] so he would be contacted
[23:11] in order he could contact he became one
[23:13] of us
[23:14] when he become jesus christ the son of
[23:16] god
[23:18] the fullness of the manifestation of god
[23:20] that's a beautiful picture he's just
[23:22] painted in a few sentences
[23:24] just a couple sentences just how
[23:25] beautifully he has painted how that god
[23:28] put us in flesh so he could fellowship
[23:30] with us
[23:32] and it's in the flesh that all of his
[23:34] attributes can be made manifest
[23:37] if you only were a perfect spirit
[23:40] god would always be thinking man i'm a
[23:43] healer i just wish there was some way to
[23:45] show them i could heal
[23:47] if you never had a spirit that could be
[23:49] broken like a broken heart he's like i'm
[23:50] a comforter
[23:52] i really wish they knew this about me
[23:54] but i guess they'll never know
[23:56] but god wanted all that he was to be
[23:58] expressed so this is part of his divine
[24:00] plan
[24:01] so he says therefore that was god's
[24:02] purpose to display his attributes in
[24:05] fellowship
[24:07] and this is really this is kind of
[24:08] setting kind of laying out some of the
[24:10] pieces of what i was
[24:12] indicting in the beginning of last week
[24:14] when i began to
[24:15] come to this place of a family in their
[24:18] and the relationships among themselves
[24:20] express god and express his character
[24:22] he desired and love a family of his own
[24:24] so that was god's purpose to display his
[24:26] attributes and fellowship
[24:27] then he says when i was in my father i
[24:29] knew nothing about it
[24:30] but when i became his son and was born
[24:32] of him i was an attribute a part of my
[24:35] father
[24:36] so now he's looking at this someone who
[24:39] begets and someone who genders a child
[24:41] and you're a part of your father and as
[24:43] children of god we are part of god's
[24:45] attribute that was in him
[24:46] made flesh like he was made flesh so we
[24:49] can have fellowship one with
[24:50] the other with each other and with god
[24:53] as a
[24:53] family of god upon the earth that's what
[24:56] we are
[24:57] and that was god's purpose at the
[24:59] beginning
[25:00] all born by one incorruptible seed all
[25:03] born by the word of god by the will of
[25:05] god and become a family of god upon the
[25:07] earth
[25:08] that was god's purpose at the beginning
[25:10] so why did he make one couple
[25:12] what was the reason that he might seek a
[25:14] godly seed or a godly family that he
[25:16] could have a family of god upon the
[25:17] earth
[25:18] that was god's purpose at the beginning
[25:19] yes sir that's what god wanted at the
[25:22] beginning
[25:23] and since that's what god wanted at the
[25:25] beginning he establishes and foreshadows
[25:28] how that is accomplished in the
[25:30] beginning
[25:32] so now we're looking at this expression
[25:34] that he made
[25:35] man male and female
[25:39] and so these are designations that were
[25:41] essential to the image of god
[25:44] so what god does is he takes mankind and
[25:46] he divides it
[25:47] and he makes a division and so this is a
[25:50] divine division
[25:52] if you hate math we can at least accept
[25:54] this divine division
[25:57] and so in genesis chapter 2 verses 22 to
[26:00] 24
[26:01] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[26:03] from man he chose the rib for a reason
[26:06] or he expresses that it was the rib so
[26:08] that we could understand
[26:10] he took a building material of a for a
[26:11] dwelling place he took
[26:13] a part of man that was likened to
[26:15] certain things in the in the temple in
[26:17] the tabernacle
[26:18] and he made a woman he took the rib from
[26:20] man
[26:21] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[26:24] man
[26:24] and adam said this is now born of my
[26:26] bones and flesh of my flesh the essence
[26:28] of my essence
[26:29] she shall be called woman the capital w
[26:32] because she was taken
[26:33] out of man now what god has done is he's
[26:38] brought this
[26:39] division he separates male and female
[26:42] so now each hold very specific fleshly
[26:45] characteristics
[26:46] and so god establishes a difference
[26:49] between not among
[26:50] between the sexes god establishes this
[26:55] and this and so we'll just use maybe our
[26:58] our english words that are derived from
[27:00] latin to describe this when we fill out
[27:02] an application or someone ask you
[27:04] what is your sex and that refers to are
[27:07] you
[27:07] male or female that's because god in the
[27:10] beginning
[27:11] divided humanity between
[27:15] male and female there was one male one
[27:18] female there wasn't another division
[27:20] to create a another expression in this
[27:23] we use the term
[27:24] the to denote the the sex of the
[27:27] individual
[27:28] this is something that god did so just
[27:31] in our latin to
[27:32] the noun sex it speaks of a male or
[27:34] female or collectively male and females
[27:36] and so the this comes from the latin
[27:38] word sexist
[27:40] not sexist but sexist which means a
[27:43] state of being either male or female
[27:46] so that's your choice or maybe not your
[27:50] choice that
[27:50] that's the reality
[27:53] just walking right in thank you that's
[27:56] exactly what we wanted
[28:00] and that comes from and it's associated
[28:03] with and comes from the latin
[28:05] secco or seques which literally this is
[28:08] what it means
[28:08] in the very language that we use
[28:11] division
[28:12] or cut in half
[28:15] so the very word sec comes sex comes
[28:17] from the root to cut in
[28:19] half not into turds half
[28:22] right so what he's done is he's a
[28:24] division it's half of the race or two
[28:26] parts binary two parts
[28:28] and it's related to the word sikar which
[28:30] means to divide or cut or sectio which
[28:32] is division so this is something
[28:34] that that sex refers to in terms of male
[28:37] or female it's a division of humanity
[28:39] he divides them into two because it's a
[28:41] cut in half you had one male one female
[28:44] there's now a half of what humanity was
[28:47] originally
[28:48] and so this is by divine design
[28:53] this is uh this is according to a divine
[28:56] desire
[28:57] in order to fulfill the purpose of man
[28:59] that's laid out in genesis 1 28
[29:01] be fruitful multiply and replenish the
[29:03] earth so once god has brought forth an
[29:05] expression
[29:06] that is embodied in a creation of male
[29:08] and female
[29:09] he now begins to speak to those
[29:11] characteristics and attributes that are
[29:13] in there
[29:13] and he begins to say be fruitful
[29:15] multiply and replenish the earth
[29:17] because man could not be fruitful and
[29:19] multiply and replenish the earth unless
[29:21] there had been a division
[29:23] between male and female and then they
[29:25] step into their calling
[29:29] genesis chapter 2 verse 24 as we
[29:31] continue to read verse 24
[29:34] is anybody nervous everybody comfortable
[29:39] therefore god has taken us through this
[29:42] process woman
[29:43] man therefore shall a man leave his
[29:46] father
[29:46] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[29:50] wife and they shall be
[29:52] one flesh this is one family still
[29:56] it's not the way that we understand
[29:57] families today
[29:59] there's there's no way in this original
[30:01] plan that you would have a german
[30:03] irishman
[30:04] right it wouldn't happen
[30:08] you'd have a godman that's what you
[30:11] would have
[30:12] a godly seed and so in this
[30:17] the culmination now as we come to verse
[30:19] 24
[30:20] he has now taken man or he's taken
[30:23] man which was adam the male and female
[30:27] and adam who was uh who becomes
[30:30] at this time of this division the man
[30:32] adam
[30:33] becomes the ish so the male becomes a
[30:36] man
[30:38] and i want to phrase it that way the
[30:39] male becomes a man and the female
[30:41] is expressed as woman isha
[30:44] so now there's a greater expression that
[30:46] the male and female have
[30:48] god calls them in the beginning god
[30:49] created a man
[30:51] and he made them male and female but now
[30:53] the male and female
[30:55] have become something else not just the
[30:58] sex but now it relates to a role it
[31:00] relates to a purpose
[31:01] there's a greater expression of husband
[31:03] and now in
[31:04] husband and wife the male has become a
[31:07] husband
[31:09] the woman is now expressed as the female
[31:12] is now expressed his wife so it's not
[31:14] just being male and being female
[31:16] but now there's an identity that comes
[31:18] the male becomes a man the man becomes a
[31:20] husband the female
[31:21] becomes a woman the woman becomes a wife
[31:23] this is all being expressed
[31:25] in the beginning now
[31:28] the animal life whatever it was
[31:32] there was still a division be in the in
[31:34] each each specie
[31:36] each family of animal where you'd have
[31:38] the male and female
[31:40] and so they could be uh you could have
[31:42] either sex
[31:43] of a particular living creature or beast
[31:46] but no beast ever carried the
[31:48] designation or the
[31:49] or stepped into the office of husband or
[31:51] wife
[31:53] so they had male and female and that's
[31:55] an important distinction
[31:57] but now because god made the difference
[31:59] in mankind
[32:00] that he would say there's male and
[32:02] female he wants to further develop what
[32:04] those roles and responsibilities would
[32:06] be
[32:06] or what the image that male holds and
[32:08] what the image of female holds and as we
[32:10] see it in its genesis or its seed form
[32:12] there's something that it can become he
[32:14] brings it out in genesis chapter two
[32:15] male becomes man female becomes woman
[32:19] and that's not so with animal life
[32:21] there's not a husband buck there's not a
[32:23] wife doe they're just they're just
[32:25] ordered by their sex
[32:29] so the male and female
[32:32] they had some they had some retained
[32:35] some attribute or characteristic
[32:37] you could call it genetic attribute
[32:39] something there in them physically that
[32:40] god had attributed to them
[32:42] that develop into certain
[32:44] characteristics that are suited for
[32:45] their calling
[32:47] in the beginning god made a male and
[32:48] female male and female be fruitful
[32:50] multiply and replenish the earth god has
[32:52] to have
[32:53] order in a way a division in order to
[32:55] bring that forth to fulfill scripture
[32:58] and so as we might say it in very simple
[33:00] terms
[33:01] that the male had a genetic chromosome
[33:03] the female had a genetic chromosome that
[33:05] their dna was structured a certain way
[33:07] to where you could tell in their base
[33:09] cells and in their cellular structure
[33:11] one's a male one's a female and the male
[33:13] is the xy chromosome
[33:15] and the female being the x chromosome
[33:17] and these are distinct
[33:19] biological differences between the male
[33:21] and the female
[33:24] and the male get comes into
[33:28] um becomes the man the female becomes
[33:31] the woman
[33:32] and the word each male it means it
[33:34] literally means to show
[33:36] masculinity the male becomes a man to
[33:39] show the worth of a man to have
[33:41] the the appropriate qualities of a man
[33:45] and so this is what this is what the
[33:47] this is what was in the original this is
[33:48] the original expression
[33:50] and that's why they use the phrase when
[33:52] you emasculate some a man what you do is
[33:54] you take away his ability
[33:55] his virility his ability to create or
[33:58] procreate and that strips him of what he
[34:00] is as a man
[34:01] it takes away his masculinity right
[34:06] and and just even scientifically as they
[34:08] as they look at how these very real
[34:11] literal factual in some ways i could say
[34:14] tangible
[34:15] differences or characteristics of a man
[34:17] on the molecular level the cellular
[34:18] level would make something what it is
[34:21] they say this man is an xy that y is a
[34:24] dominant chromosome
[34:26] and it carries the gene that's going to
[34:28] signal
[34:29] to the embryo as it's being formed to
[34:31] grow to become a male
[34:34] and it's that it's that very uh
[34:37] programming that dna that chromosome
[34:39] that signals that embryo to grow
[34:42] physical characteristics that relate to
[34:46] masculinity
[34:49] we're able to understand just exactly
[34:51] what's taking place this is how god has
[34:52] structured
[34:53] it and so the most significant physical
[34:56] differences
[34:57] between male and female
[35:00] and and i i guess i say i'm not trying
[35:02] to be careful i just it's easy to do
[35:04] this
[35:05] but the the main the most significant
[35:07] physical differences relates to the
[35:09] purpose
[35:10] of the male or the female in
[35:12] reproduction of seed
[35:15] so you could have you could have you
[35:17] could have men that are short
[35:18] you could have women that are tall and
[35:20] there's different characteristics that
[35:21] you might say
[35:22] not all women um have blonde hair and
[35:24] not all men have uh no hair
[35:26] that's not how it works but there's
[35:29] certain physical characteristics
[35:32] immutable to to the the to the male and
[35:35] to the female
[35:36] in those most significant and
[35:38] outstanding differences and really what
[35:40] makes them different is the role of
[35:42] those differences in reproduction of the
[35:45] seed
[35:46] or to have a family and so you can be
[35:50] so there's and let me say it this way
[35:53] maybe i might just need to read the
[35:54] statement but i want to kind of set it
[35:55] up
[35:56] so you can be male and that gives you
[35:59] the
[35:59] the ability the potential of expressing
[36:04] the attributes that are appropriate for
[36:06] of a man
[36:08] you're female that means you possess
[36:11] certain potentials
[36:12] that have properly developed give you
[36:14] the ability to be
[36:16] a woman to express a woman
[36:19] and there's certain things that are
[36:22] apparent
[36:23] and so from the from the very birth or
[36:25] even before they're born
[36:26] right nowadays they just do a blood test
[36:28] and they can tell you
[36:30] they do a blood test and they tell you
[36:32] before they're ever born well
[36:33] they're not ready to declare yet
[36:38] so the most the significant difference
[36:41] is now you still have
[36:42] these differences but now there's
[36:44] something that they need to become and
[36:45] notice what brother bam says
[36:46] in the message if god be with us you
[36:48] can't expect a baby to be born
[36:50] a man
[36:54] what is what does it go what is it going
[36:56] to be a boy or
[36:57] a girl and i used to have kind of maybe
[37:01] it was a dad joke before i actually
[37:02] became a dad but it just showed my great
[37:03] potential
[37:04] they said do you know if you're having a
[37:06] boy or a girl and i'd say oh yeah
[37:07] absolutely
[37:08] yeah is there another that we could have
[37:12] i was really showing that i was dad
[37:15] material
[37:16] because it's going to be a boy or a girl
[37:18] and i believe the rule is you can't lose
[37:21] you can't lose having children boy or
[37:23] girl you can't lose
[37:25] they're a gift of god you can't expect a
[37:27] baby to be born a man it's got to grow
[37:29] to it
[37:29] and he says from this image that we see
[37:31] in nature
[37:32] we grow into christ a full statue not
[37:35] somebody get converted overnight and
[37:36] tomorrow go preach the gospel
[37:38] this is the spiritual principle we grow
[37:40] up into manhood into the statue of
[37:42] christ
[37:43] so you're not born again in a fully
[37:44] placed fully uh
[37:46] endued empowered son of god who can just
[37:48] start preaching
[37:50] you're born a child of god and then you
[37:53] mature and grow into
[37:54] manhood an office a maturing so you
[37:58] could be
[37:58] you're born a male and then you mature
[38:00] to a man
[38:01] you're born a female you mature to a
[38:02] woman he says and you must be born again
[38:04] tonight you're a sinner and this is what
[38:06] he says in the morning of the
[38:08] before he makes this other statement so
[38:09] you see this is emphasis in his mind on
[38:11] that particular
[38:12] day tonight you're sinner tomorrow
[38:13] you're the manifested sons of god
[38:15] so the manifested sons of god speaks of
[38:17] adoption so today you're a sinner
[38:19] you get born again and tomorrow you're a
[38:20] manifested son of god wherever i'm
[38:22] specifically identifying
[38:24] that there's leaven in that
[38:25] understanding without qualification
[38:27] without proper teaching
[38:28] you take this idea that you're a sinner
[38:30] then you're converted and then you're
[38:32] everything an expression that a son of
[38:34] god ought to be he says
[38:35] he says this babies are not born men
[38:38] they're born babies and grow
[38:39] to men a baby is born male or female and
[38:43] then grows to be a
[38:44] man or woman so there's a spiritual
[38:46] application to this
[38:47] development but what is it that's
[38:50] controlling what is it that rules
[38:51] there's a dna blueprint
[38:53] within that seed that produces a male
[38:56] there's a dna blueprint within that
[38:58] within that
[38:59] that that combination embryo if i can
[39:02] say it that way that produces a female
[39:04] and from the very beginning that it
[39:05] begins to form and even through
[39:07] childhood
[39:08] and through adolescence there's in the
[39:09] physical development of the male there's
[39:11] increased testosterone that matures the
[39:13] body
[39:14] to produce the characteristics of a man
[39:18] and the abilities of a man it's this
[39:20] very specific
[39:21] uh uh you know a specific amount but
[39:23] this testosterone at the levels the
[39:25] greater levels
[39:25] that work upon the the cellular
[39:28] structure the dna the program
[39:30] that cause it to mature and grow from a
[39:32] male a boy or a baby
[39:33] into a man same for a female increased
[39:36] estrogen matures her into a
[39:38] woman and that's what they call sexual
[39:41] maturity
[39:43] that as it matures it comes to a place
[39:45] and what is sexual maturity the ability
[39:47] to have children to produce children
[39:50] and so this is these this is the order
[39:54] that god established that every single
[39:56] human being has operated on for
[39:57] thousands of years
[39:59] it's the language that we even use it's
[40:00] the ideas that were that were passed out
[40:03] and handed down
[40:04] in all cultures because this is
[40:06] expressed literally this is how it's
[40:08] happened
[40:10] so now brother branham in the message
[40:12] accepting god's provided way at the end
[40:14] and
[40:14] he makes this statement after he's in
[40:16] the context of him telling the story of
[40:17] going up beyond the curtain of time
[40:19] and are you familiar with that so this
[40:21] is a translation vision that brother
[40:23] branham had of
[40:24] of those souls just beyond that veil who
[40:26] are waiting
[40:27] uh for the climax the culprit
[40:29] culmination and the meeting in the air
[40:30] and as he described he says there
[40:31] couldn't be sin
[40:33] in that dimension the men and women so
[40:36] they're they're men and women he says
[40:37] those women
[40:38] were hugging me and they were women but
[40:39] there was no possibility
[40:41] of ever being sin again see the glands
[40:44] of our bodies will be changed there
[40:46] we're different we're different sex now
[40:48] because that's for reproducing the world
[40:50] and our marriage to bring children so
[40:53] here's brother branham he's describing
[40:55] something
[40:56] but he gives us principles that are
[40:57] relevant today
[40:59] to understand why we are the way we are
[41:01] now but there'll be no more need of that
[41:04] there'll be no more children born and
[41:06] i'll come to a scripture lord willing in
[41:08] a little bit to
[41:08] back that up we won't have sex glands in
[41:11] the new world see
[41:12] not at all and it's in the way
[41:16] that we have them now the use the
[41:19] utility the function those things he's
[41:20] saying
[41:21] that that's not going to be needed there
[41:24] so he says but yet the woman will be a
[41:25] woman in stature
[41:26] she'll look like a woman she'll act like
[41:29] a woman she'll be a woman
[41:30] so will men be men but they'll be no
[41:33] more male and female among them he says
[41:35] in that way so it helps us understand
[41:39] the very
[41:40] the very reason for male and female the
[41:41] very thing that god is setting forth the
[41:43] very
[41:44] uh uh way the way god made him is i'm
[41:46] making him
[41:47] that male and female because i want to
[41:49] have a family
[41:51] i desire to have a family so i've got to
[41:53] have these characteristics to have a
[41:54] family
[41:55] and then once he has that family once
[41:57] they've matured once they've cut his
[41:58] place and he gives us these new bodies
[42:00] we don't need those distinctions
[42:02] in that way
[42:06] and this is powerful and them glands
[42:08] won't be in
[42:09] so there'll be no way at all for satan
[42:11] to ever play another trick on them
[42:14] wow man i i i can't even
[42:18] begin to describe what this image
[42:22] creates when you begin to think about
[42:24] god
[42:24] and his program and his plan and how he
[42:26] led satan just walked right into the
[42:28] trap and that god had everything laid
[42:31] out that no matter what
[42:32] satan tries to do it's checkmate
[42:35] and he said let's start all over let's
[42:37] play again
[42:40] and satan starts a game and and and
[42:43] god makes a move and then satan logs
[42:45] into a different account plays expert
[42:46] level and plays
[42:47] god's move to see what the computer is
[42:49] going to do
[42:50] that's what some of y'all do when you
[42:51] play chess online right
[42:54] you just play the other guy's move and
[42:55] then the computer tells you how to
[42:56] respond
[42:57] the devil's doing everything he can to
[42:58] trick and to cheat and he always loses
[43:04] so this just this one statement alone
[43:09] establishes how the in the beginning god
[43:12] has set forth two sexes
[43:14] just two and then clearly defines the
[43:17] general roles that each hold
[43:19] but specifically identifies the ultimate
[43:22] purpose what he wanted to do have a
[43:24] family to bring forth
[43:27] and so their genetic origins determined
[43:29] whether they would become a man or a
[43:31] woman
[43:32] this is a very specific gender construct
[43:35] that god sets forth
[43:38] and so the very use of the word so we've
[43:40] been using sex to describe
[43:41] male sex female sex and that
[43:44] gave clearly defined purpose man and
[43:47] woman
[43:49] and so the word gender because god has
[43:52] set this forth the word gender
[43:54] scripturally means kinder species or
[43:56] character
[43:57] a race or stock the the gender of
[44:00] something would speak of
[44:01] the order the family the species
[44:04] and it comes from the root word gene
[44:08] so i began to think about what this what
[44:10] god is setting forth in
[44:12] having a gender gene means to give birth
[44:15] or to beget
[44:17] so the idea of gender was originally
[44:20] constructed in terms of
[44:21] reproduction that that's the purpose of
[44:25] the whole idea of a
[44:26] gender what are you able to gender
[44:31] you know you're a male okay if you're a
[44:34] male
[44:35] then you're a a a human because there
[44:37] was no
[44:38] homo sapien necessarily in terms of the
[44:41] way that they had it it was just
[44:43] a man in the image of god right
[44:47] that's what god had and so if you had a
[44:49] man a male in the image of god
[44:50] then you had to have a female in the
[44:52] image of the of god that would produce
[44:55] gender another child of god
[44:59] so that that's what gender relates to it
[45:01] relates to
[45:02] your role in reproduction
[45:06] gender's not you know i feel like a
[45:08] burrito
[45:10] let's go get a burrito right it's it's
[45:13] not some kind of
[45:14] feeling or phenomena that you experience
[45:18] in the beginning it's it's connected
[45:20] with giving birth or begetting in
[45:22] leviticus chapter 19 verse 19 he says ye
[45:24] shall keep my statutes
[45:26] and notice he says thou shalt not let
[45:28] thy cattle gender with the diverse kind
[45:30] thou shalt not sow thy field with mingle
[45:32] seed neither shall a garment mingled of
[45:34] linen and wool and come
[45:36] upon thee what does this reflect
[45:39] it reflects god's desire
[45:42] this is god's nature god says this is my
[45:45] law and this is
[45:46] expressing my original intent and design
[45:48] in the beginning
[45:49] you should not let your cattle gender
[45:51] that means to breed or reproduce
[45:53] that's what gender relates to breeding
[45:55] reproducing he says you shall not gender
[45:57] with a diverse kind
[45:59] do not soul filled with mingle seed
[46:00] that's a forbidden hybrid mixture
[46:04] to take different seeds and combine them
[46:05] and join them together don't take this
[46:07] animal and breed it with another animal
[46:09] of another kind
[46:10] that makes good and evil
[46:13] something that's proper pleasing that'll
[46:15] produce the proper image
[46:16] but then when you mix it with something
[46:17] else what do you get you get evil
[46:20] you get a different reflection and
[46:21] that's when you have this hybrid
[46:23] of knowledge of good and evil something
[46:25] is produced that's not like the original
[46:27] it's not like either of the originals
[46:31] and i would love to emphasize this to a
[46:33] greater degree
[46:34] but it has been a theme through all
[46:36] these different parts on how
[46:38] and if it resonates with you you feel
[46:40] free to say a hearty amen
[46:42] with each view of these scriptures the
[46:45] original sin
[46:46] becomes more and more understandable and
[46:48] becomes more and more clear to the point
[46:51] you're almost like why has there ever
[46:53] been a controversy
[46:57] and with an understanding what the
[46:58] original sin is just based upon this
[47:00] scripture what we've been trying to
[47:01] express to this point in this morning
[47:03] service
[47:04] the original sin shattered god's design
[47:08] because the woman gendered with a
[47:10] diverse kind
[47:12] it shattered god's desire he's he's to
[47:14] have a family a family of sons like
[47:16] himself
[47:16] and the female that was to take the role
[47:19] of producing another son of god has done
[47:21] what
[47:21] has gendered with a different with a
[47:24] different
[47:24] creature and that cannot produce an adam
[47:29] that cannot produce the mankind that
[47:31] adam was
[47:32] though it may have been in part what
[47:34] adam was originally
[47:36] but now it's a combination of other dnas
[47:39] so from that moment on that souls a
[47:41] weakness
[47:42] into what we call today humanity that
[47:44] allows for a lot of different things
[47:46] that were not originally contemplated
[47:49] in the beginning
[47:52] can you follow that the the injection of
[47:56] another dna
[47:57] and then the thousands of years of a
[47:59] nurture upon that
[48:00] can produce expressions that god never
[48:03] intended in the original
[48:06] it's a weakening it's a it's a it's a
[48:08] it's a changing of things
[48:11] and so again let me emphasize this
[48:13] gender
[48:14] as we would use that phrase sex would be
[48:16] male and female but as they come to man
[48:18] and woman
[48:19] and they're identified with masculinity
[48:20] and feminism
[48:23] in the good way femininity is that
[48:25] better
[48:28] i need to do some exercises uh
[48:31] before i find myself i have a lisp when
[48:32] i preach
[48:35] i get my words all mixed up there's
[48:37] things i've said years ago that still
[48:39] haunt me
[48:40] i lay in bed going is that still on the
[48:43] archives
[48:45] should i write the brother and say you
[48:46] know i kind of slipped up there and
[48:48] i did come out right could you just put
[48:50] blank spot on tape
[48:53] so forgive me
[48:56] so gender denoted the role and
[48:59] responsibility of each sex
[49:02] considering god's purpose for creation
[49:05] so you see how these things are
[49:06] connected in god's eye scripturally
[49:09] now if if someone wants to debate
[49:11] whether or not that's fair
[49:13] or equitable we can do that as it
[49:15] relates to
[49:16] society or or
[49:19] laws or governments but we're just
[49:21] looking at it
[49:22] how god sees it how god established it
[49:26] and and and that may create a moral
[49:28] paradigm for us as believers who believe
[49:30] the bible is infallible in the true
[49:32] the word of god and that may create a
[49:33] value system for those of us who believe
[49:35] this to be god's word
[49:36] but we we need to be careful just how
[49:38] arrogant and bitter and degrading we can
[49:40] be with truth
[49:42] we're just simply pointing out what what
[49:44] god has established and what we believe
[49:46] to be the ultimate
[49:49] i mean let's just be honest guys did god
[49:51] ordain you to smoke a crack
[49:54] to do marijuana to drop acid you did it
[49:58] was that in the original design so let's
[50:01] not get too self-righteous
[50:03] with our past and and things and just
[50:05] realize sin is sin
[50:06] right the the defiling of the human
[50:09] conscience
[50:10] and the morality of human nature is the
[50:13] design of satan has expressed itself in
[50:15] multitudes of ways
[50:16] but god is the only redeemer
[50:19] and and we're going back to the
[50:21] beginning to see a promise that god in
[50:23] the beginning did not intend for a body
[50:24] to have cancer well then i believe this
[50:26] body can be delivered of cancer
[50:28] god in the beginning did not make a man
[50:30] to fear so therefore i believe fear can
[50:32] be cast out
[50:33] and then i take every promise of god to
[50:35] say no matter what satan wants to
[50:36] produce
[50:37] in this end time i believe that we have
[50:39] a covenant that has restored us
[50:41] back to the beginning
[50:45] even beyond pentecost whatever sin
[50:47] whatever misunderstanding whatever
[50:49] vileness whatever
[50:50] existed then exists now but god just
[50:52] does not want to take me
[50:54] back to 33 a.d he wants to take me back
[50:56] to the beginning
[51:01] and so these gender roles relate to
[51:04] god's purpose
[51:05] now the modern construction the modern
[51:07] definition is it continues to change
[51:09] tries to make gender a personal sense
[51:12] like this is how i feel or a personal
[51:14] identity of being a man or a woman isn't
[51:17] that right
[51:18] this is what is kind of being debated
[51:20] and discussed and kind of evolving
[51:22] is that gender is not something that's
[51:25] defined
[51:27] listen it's an incoherent argument with
[51:29] a lot of contradictions but i'll try to
[51:31] summarize it
[51:32] that gender is now something that on one
[51:36] hand
[51:37] is a social construct
[51:40] so but then it's an internal
[51:43] feeling that someone has
[51:50] okay it's how someone feels inside
[51:54] and it's immutable and it's it's what
[51:56] they want to be
[51:58] but they you want to be a man
[52:02] but there's really no such thing
[52:06] as a man never mind
[52:09] basically i'm just kind of doing it to
[52:12] to make a point
[52:14] it's a sense of something it's something
[52:15] fluid can't quite put her finger on it
[52:16] in one sense you know there's
[52:18] it's a gender is not related
[52:20] biologically it's not
[52:21] it's not something programmed in you
[52:24] it's not
[52:24] it's not an immutable truth and written
[52:27] in stone
[52:28] but if that's how you feel in your heart
[52:29] then it is immutable and it is written
[52:31] in stone
[52:35] and so this is this is how one can feel
[52:38] i i
[52:39] i may i may genetically be a man i may
[52:42] uh i may by appearance be and
[52:44] biologically be a female
[52:46] i may have an x only x x chromosome but
[52:48] i feel
[52:49] like a man there's just this is what
[52:51] gender has become
[52:52] but in the beginning god established a
[52:54] gender order
[52:57] it was a perfect eden and that eden
[52:59] itself and all the laws that god gave it
[53:01] in the word that god gave it
[53:02] denoted the role of male and denoted the
[53:04] role of female the role the identity of
[53:06] gender and the gender of construct in
[53:08] the beginning was very clear there was
[53:09] no ambiguity
[53:11] and so if gender is a social construct
[53:13] if gender is
[53:14] the result of environment and culture
[53:17] and all these different things
[53:18] then god in the beginning created an
[53:20] environment created a culture gave a
[53:22] word
[53:22] and established a god society to have a
[53:25] godly seed
[53:26] and that determined what gender roles
[53:29] were
[53:32] and i think even the the staunchest
[53:36] advocate or atheist or advocate for
[53:39] certain rights would have to agree that
[53:40] biblically that's the way that god laid
[53:42] it out
[53:45] so brother branham says this and a
[53:47] greater than solomon is here put
[53:48] everything in its place and then operate
[53:50] in decency and in order
[53:52] you'll find god is the god of order and
[53:54] he'll bring the thing right up then
[53:57] saying it's about gifts operating in the
[53:58] church and different measures of
[53:59] different gifts but this is god's this
[54:01] is a principle of god
[54:02] put everything in its place then operate
[54:04] in decency and in order this is what god
[54:06] wanted in the beginning
[54:07] you'll find god is a god of order not a
[54:10] god of disorder
[54:11] god is a god of order one one flesh one
[54:14] spirit
[54:15] one couple one son and then and this
[54:18] this way of replication to where you're
[54:20] not trying to figure out who's who and
[54:21] who's what
[54:24] god is a god of order determination
[54:26] division he knows what it is
[54:28] because god in the beginning in the
[54:30] beginning god created a family
[54:32] and this family was to manifest his
[54:34] image
[54:36] in the initial introduction it's male
[54:38] and female male becomes man
[54:40] female becomes woman this is god's
[54:44] gender order this is god's original
[54:46] image
[54:49] that was in the beginning but now in the
[54:50] end
[54:52] think of where this is going because
[54:54] that was god's perfect eden now what do
[54:56] you have
[54:57] satan's eating so in the end satan is
[55:00] trying to perfect his eden
[55:02] god wanted to have a family a family of
[55:04] sons likened to himself
[55:06] so if that's the ambition of god satan
[55:08] said i will be like the
[55:10] most high so satan then does not want to
[55:13] have a family in the image of god he
[55:15] wants to have a family in the image of
[55:17] what
[55:18] dog i mean satan he wants to have a
[55:22] family in the image his own image so in
[55:24] isaiah 14
[55:25] 12 how art thou fallen from heaven oh
[55:27] lucifer son of the morning it likens him
[55:29] to being an angel that was once in
[55:31] heaven
[55:31] how about cut down to the ground so he's
[55:33] this angelic being that's been cast down
[55:35] to earth
[55:36] and notice his description which did us
[55:38] weaken the nations
[55:40] how did satan weaken the nations there
[55:42] speaks of humanity
[55:43] how did he weaken humanity one couple
[55:48] and he weakens it by taking a serpent
[55:51] which is of a different kind hybrid and
[55:54] it's by that hybriding that completely
[55:56] blends
[55:57] in with all humanity today the whole
[56:00] earth is populated by
[56:01] one blood there's nobody that's going to
[56:04] take a 23 and me and say
[56:05] get this there's not one ounce of cane
[56:07] in my family history
[56:11] may not be an ounce but i'll tell you
[56:12] there's a skosh of it somewhere
[56:14] it's got to be there because that's how
[56:16] the whole earth was probably
[56:17] that's how humanity was weakened you
[56:19] read the bible and you begin to read
[56:20] this man lived 900 years this man lived
[56:22] 800 years this man lived 700 years
[56:24] and you find that this true stock from
[56:26] adam had a body
[56:28] that was under a law that they couldn't
[56:29] live a whole day
[56:32] but as that serpent blood mixed with the
[56:35] blood of adam
[56:36] it weakened it to where finally they're
[56:38] dying
[56:40] in their hundreds and where is it today
[56:43] they just reduced the life expectancy
[56:45] to it's around 70 even the united states
[56:47] would it weaken blood weaken nations
[56:51] man man was under a law he'd have to die
[56:53] no man ever lived out those
[56:55] those thousand years but you don't see
[56:57] men living
[56:58] past 120 a week in the nations brother
[57:02] bennett called in the church age book
[57:03] the degradation of humanity
[57:05] by intermingling the seed
[57:09] so now that this has been introduced
[57:10] into humanity satan is wanting now by
[57:13] getting control over the design
[57:16] and entering into this getting access to
[57:18] flesh
[57:22] this is he wants to produce his image
[57:24] now if you could just stay with me
[57:26] it's not late right we're good okay
[57:29] the lamb's book of life god put satan up
[57:31] there one time as an angel so keep that
[57:33] in mind
[57:34] which he was the son of the morning and
[57:36] he took the good
[57:37] things of god and perverted them into
[57:39] evil
[57:40] there's the good and evil this is where
[57:43] satan has come in
[57:44] and so i want to point this out and i
[57:46] feel like i am losing time but let me
[57:48] just take this statement
[57:49] maybe another one to emphasize this
[57:51] brother branham identifies in the
[57:52] scripture places satan as an
[57:54] angel and him being an angel he is a
[57:58] being
[57:59] that is spiritual he is a spirit
[58:02] and being a spirit being the angels are
[58:05] not made with the sex or gender
[58:09] they the angels have neither
[58:12] now though they can manifest in a form
[58:16] that is masculine or male to to
[58:19] embody their uh their uh their authority
[58:24] we know and we are taught that angels
[58:26] are neither male nor female
[58:28] in in the sense of god created man and
[58:31] woman
[58:32] and created had male and female man and
[58:33] woman so the
[58:35] beca and also let's just say this way
[58:38] satan
[58:39] being a spirit being an angel there
[58:41] there's no
[58:42] use or utility to sex and gender because
[58:45] angels are spiritual beings there's no
[58:46] uh there's no uh sex and gender relate
[58:49] to biological origin
[58:50] angels are not biological it relates to
[58:54] biological purpose and function
[58:56] so angels don't have either of those
[58:58] characteristics he's not biological he's
[59:00] not physical
[59:00] therefore he doesn't identify with the
[59:02] sex or gender
[59:05] i was just wondering if i could just
[59:06] close right there because that's
[59:10] question and answer is part 1 1964 satan
[59:13] was the most beautiful angel so now
[59:14] i'm i i should slow down a little bit
[59:17] satan now is wanting to produce
[59:19] something in his image
[59:21] he's gained access to the original
[59:24] humanity that's now fallen and being
[59:25] degraded
[59:27] so satan has control over and notice
[59:29] what happens
[59:30] satan was the most beautiful angel he
[59:33] was a cherubim that overshadowed him
[59:35] so that was his characteristic he says
[59:37] look how different
[59:38] women are getting now to what they used
[59:41] to be
[59:42] how many remembers reading of pearl
[59:43] bryant now he says pearl brian
[59:46] and i've looked her up and she's a very
[59:49] homely person
[59:51] and it was i think a 22-year-old girl
[59:52] that was murdered in missouri
[59:54] and then brother batman in certain
[59:55] places refers to pearl bryan but he also
[59:57] refers to
[59:58] uh pearl white and clara beau or bao
[1:00:01] claire beau
[1:00:02] uh and and how they're the most
[1:00:04] beautiful women and he uses them as
[1:00:06] examples
[1:00:06] of beautiful women then and what they
[1:00:08] are now
[1:00:10] and i think sometimes he he kind of got
[1:00:12] some stories mixed up songs that were
[1:00:14] written in books that were written
[1:00:15] of different ones but his point is this
[1:00:18] let's not get hung up on the fact that
[1:00:20] there was some kind of conflation there
[1:00:22] with names of people and their and their
[1:00:24] stories
[1:00:25] he's trying to make a point let's see
[1:00:27] your hands from your
[1:00:28] older people see supposed to be the most
[1:00:30] beautiful woman in america i don't think
[1:00:32] there's anyone here
[1:00:33] who's going to say they remember pearl
[1:00:35] white
[1:00:36] or clara beau i thought eliza raised her
[1:00:39] hand
[1:00:41] silent film buff now
[1:00:44] they're supposed to be the most
[1:00:45] beautiful women in the world if you
[1:00:46] could maybe just put up the next slide
[1:00:48] i'll finish i'll finish reading here
[1:00:51] any little teenage snickel fritz on the
[1:00:53] street would be twice as pretty as she
[1:00:55] is now twice as she now he says
[1:00:59] so there's pearl white and clara beau
[1:01:00] he's saying that you could just find
[1:01:02] some
[1:01:03] rando on the street now right
[1:01:06] and he'd say they'd be pretty to these
[1:01:08] two and i'd say i think he's right
[1:01:12] and he's attributing this to the fact
[1:01:14] that satan has taken a hold of the woman
[1:01:18] and he's designed her and now she is the
[1:01:21] most beautiful
[1:01:22] specie she is the most beautiful sex of
[1:01:25] men and women he says you look in nature
[1:01:26] it's not like that
[1:01:28] which cardinal is the really beautiful
[1:01:30] red one
[1:01:31] male and it's virtually like that in all
[1:01:33] in all classifications though there's
[1:01:35] some
[1:01:35] variances and exceptions to that rule
[1:01:37] but it's the male that is the most
[1:01:39] beautiful the most attractive and that's
[1:01:41] why
[1:01:44] it causes a question when a man wants to
[1:01:46] be the most beautiful in the room
[1:01:54] so
[1:01:57] just using that that image there
[1:02:08] let me read this and we can we can uh
[1:02:11] take that off
[1:02:13] you think about this then it shows i
[1:02:16] want just using this
[1:02:17] slight example and i may have been
[1:02:19] better for me to use more examples
[1:02:21] and more statements satan is influencing
[1:02:25] the design the expression of the woman
[1:02:29] she's more beautiful now than she was
[1:02:30] before
[1:02:32] and i'm and brother bram attributes that
[1:02:34] to satan
[1:02:37] because satan's trying to achieve his
[1:02:39] eden but he's not just going to stop at
[1:02:42] this
[1:02:42] acceleration of beauty think about they
[1:02:46] and you've been doing it since this
[1:02:47] whole thing started
[1:02:48] the gender politics that captivate so
[1:02:51] many people
[1:02:53] and the gender controversies
[1:02:57] that become uh very prominent in
[1:02:59] election cycles
[1:03:01] and that mean a lot to very near and
[1:03:02] dear to certain people's hearts
[1:03:04] and it's remarkable in how much it
[1:03:07] dominates
[1:03:08] air time and can dominate even believers
[1:03:11] minds and hearts they get all wrapped up
[1:03:12] into it they're rolling up their sleeves
[1:03:14] and they want to march on washington
[1:03:15] we're on a list now and uh
[1:03:18] all because of the rights of 0.5
[1:03:22] of the population we need to take a step
[1:03:25] back and remember
[1:03:26] satan's probably behind that too
[1:03:30] create a controversy and get you riled
[1:03:32] up about it
[1:03:34] i'm just gonna i took this out of my
[1:03:35] notes but i'm just gonna say it
[1:03:39] trump ran on the platform of make
[1:03:41] america great again
[1:03:43] were we not taught by brother branham
[1:03:45] that she will never be
[1:03:47] great again just throwing that out there
[1:03:54] but this is uh this was in the this was
[1:03:56] in an article called gender revolution
[1:03:58] the many ways society
[1:03:59] makes a man so there's a gender
[1:04:01] revolution this was in the 2019
[1:04:03] january 2019 national geographic
[1:04:06] so i just didn't pull this off
[1:04:08] somebody's blog
[1:04:09] america culture is lurching toward a
[1:04:12] gender-neutral society
[1:04:15] so this is where america is headed no
[1:04:17] wonder he said
[1:04:18] she's basic she's condemned she's lost
[1:04:21] she'll never rise again
[1:04:22] she rejected god in 1956. you can go
[1:04:24] back and find in the beginning of 1956
[1:04:26] here i took it out of my notes and i'm
[1:04:27] going to give it to you anyways
[1:04:28] he says she's blessed america is
[1:04:32] he says he says i'm american he says you
[1:04:33] know what it's good to be american he
[1:04:35] says you're proud of me and said you
[1:04:36] know what that's true because she's
[1:04:37] blessed
[1:04:37] he doesn't say that again like as
[1:04:40] america rejects god in 1956 she's lost
[1:04:42] she's condemned shall never raise again
[1:04:43] he says that's thus saith
[1:04:47] the lord but what does satan want to do
[1:04:49] create a controversy
[1:04:50] and we jump into it and we wade into it
[1:04:52] and we get all riled up and
[1:04:54] we get motivated by it we become
[1:04:55] identified by it and it's all part of
[1:04:57] satan's plan
[1:04:59] satan's the kind of guy that that pokes
[1:05:02] you and pokes the other guy and then
[1:05:03] backs up and watches the other turn i
[1:05:04] say did you punch me did you poke me
[1:05:05] and he just sits back and laughs because
[1:05:07] everybody's fighting and they forgot the
[1:05:08] real cause
[1:05:11] so the gender neutral society
[1:05:14] one that has moved so far from
[1:05:16] anatomy-based definitions of men and
[1:05:18] women that the u.s department of justice
[1:05:20] education and defense
[1:05:21] in 2016 affirmed anti-discrimination
[1:05:24] policies policies
[1:05:25] that recognize a person's self-assigned
[1:05:27] gender identity
[1:05:28] regardless of the sex ticked on a birth
[1:05:30] certificate
[1:05:32] so listen that's just the facts
[1:05:36] and this is government this is justice
[1:05:39] education and defense
[1:05:40] allowing certain people who choose to
[1:05:42] identify on paper
[1:05:43] something other than what they were
[1:05:44] admit originally presenting at birth and
[1:05:47] saying we're going to let you do that
[1:05:48] now
[1:05:49] i'm not getting all angry about that
[1:05:51] even though i don't see
[1:05:52] i i see that there's something
[1:05:54] fundamentally uh
[1:05:55] a myth there something anti-scripture
[1:05:59] but if the department of defense wants
[1:06:01] to allow someone who
[1:06:02] uh who enlists in the army to be able to
[1:06:04] say that they're neither male or female
[1:06:06] the army can do that if they want
[1:06:07] doesn't mean it's right
[1:06:09] it doesn't change truth and doesn't mean
[1:06:12] i have to hate the army the armed
[1:06:13] service or the person who enlisted
[1:06:15] because it's contrary to truth so then
[1:06:18] it says this because it's exploring this
[1:06:20] gender revolution and the impact on
[1:06:21] young men
[1:06:22] it says a boy cannot rely on the
[1:06:24] traditional roles of men and women for
[1:06:26] an idea of what it means to be a man
[1:06:28] in the name of equality gender
[1:06:30] stereotypes have been turned
[1:06:32] inside out or repudiated
[1:06:35] so what are they then called stereotypes
[1:06:38] uh you know
[1:06:42] norms or modalities or certain prisons
[1:06:44] and things well this was a constructive
[1:06:46] man and
[1:06:46] this is society and this is
[1:06:48] judeo-christian values and they try to
[1:06:50] put them in the sense they
[1:06:51] let's tear all those things down let's
[1:06:53] let people be what they want to be
[1:06:56] now this is remember satan moved his
[1:06:58] seat from paris in the invasion of the
[1:07:00] united states and moved it to hollywood
[1:07:03] so satan is satan is the one that is bri
[1:07:05] these policies are coming to existence
[1:07:08] under his watch so to speak and it was
[1:07:11] brother martin jones i appreciate him
[1:07:12] sharing this with me because i don't
[1:07:13] even know if i would have seen it had
[1:07:15] you not shared it so thank you brother
[1:07:16] martin
[1:07:16] i'll blame you for going into the after
[1:07:18] hour
[1:07:20] the house of representatives approved
[1:07:21] new rules for the 117th congress
[1:07:24] and these new rules require gender
[1:07:26] neutral terms
[1:07:28] i might have put the phrase up there um
[1:07:31] it says in the interest of so
[1:07:34] in the interest of inclusion and
[1:07:36] diversity the changes
[1:07:38] honor all gender identities by changing
[1:07:40] pronouns and familial relationships and
[1:07:42] the house rules
[1:07:43] to be gender-neutral
[1:07:47] and so it in in the implementation
[1:07:51] and doing this for the purposes of
[1:07:52] inclusion and diversity
[1:07:55] and so we're trying to be sensitive we
[1:07:57] want to be tolerant we want to be we
[1:07:58] want to
[1:07:58] be welcoming so we don't want to use
[1:08:02] gender term terms that are
[1:08:04] distinguishing we don't use gender
[1:08:05] neutral terms
[1:08:06] so that we don't offend one percent of
[1:08:09] the population
[1:08:11] less than one percent i'm so this
[1:08:14] this principle and i'm just stating the
[1:08:17] facts i i'm not trying to agitate it or
[1:08:20] aggravate this argument at all by
[1:08:21] stating that
[1:08:22] it requires the removal and bans the use
[1:08:26] of male or female pronouns
[1:08:28] in any reference to man or woman
[1:08:33] so notice just how far it goes it
[1:08:35] prohibits and i'll read legal references
[1:08:37] in federal cold
[1:08:38] code to family roles and genders such as
[1:08:40] father mother
[1:08:41] son daughter brother sister husband
[1:08:45] wife so what's just been eradicated
[1:08:50] the family's gone it's it's
[1:08:54] gender neutral person they
[1:08:57] them and so there's there's no way to
[1:09:00] designate within the family what role
[1:09:02] one would have as a father as a mother
[1:09:04] as a son a daughter a brother sister
[1:09:06] husband wife
[1:09:09] now everybody doing all right
[1:09:12] anybody doing all right are you doing
[1:09:14] good yes
[1:09:16] a kind of a slow process here i
[1:09:17] recognize that
[1:09:19] now follow me because this is this is
[1:09:21] probably where we start
[1:09:24] uh looking at this in a different light
[1:09:28] this can be very very offensive to a
[1:09:31] a conservative christian because this
[1:09:34] does not conform to ideals of a
[1:09:36] traditional family
[1:09:37] and and male and female and just the
[1:09:40] reality scientific reality biological
[1:09:42] reality
[1:09:43] our christian reality our revelation all
[1:09:45] these things and there's a lot of
[1:09:46] reasons why we could be offended at this
[1:09:48] but let me say this
[1:09:49] it's not wrong just because
[1:09:52] as a body of a a congress body
[1:09:55] they want to acknowledge that a man may
[1:09:58] feel
[1:09:58] like he's a woman that's not what makes
[1:10:02] it wrong they want to acknowledge and be
[1:10:04] inclusive
[1:10:05] and acknowledge that someone may not uh
[1:10:07] a woman may feel like or identify as a
[1:10:10] man they want to be sensitive to an
[1:10:12] individual's personal
[1:10:13] gender identity they said the best way
[1:10:15] that we can make someone feel
[1:10:17] comfortable
[1:10:17] is we'll write laws that do not refer to
[1:10:19] a husband in the criminal code we'll
[1:10:21] write laws that do not refer to mother
[1:10:22] of a child will not really refer to
[1:10:24] brother sister aunt uncle cousin all
[1:10:26] those different things all the things
[1:10:28] that
[1:10:28] identify who one is in a family in
[1:10:31] relation to another ancestor
[1:10:33] and in that bloodline going to remove
[1:10:34] labels of husband labels of wife
[1:10:36] pronouns that relate to father and
[1:10:38] mother it strips it of that identity but
[1:10:40] we want to do it because
[1:10:42] we want to be sensitive to others who
[1:10:43] don't identify according to those
[1:10:46] that construct and so i i don't know if
[1:10:51] if that means if a man identifies as a
[1:10:54] woman and wants to be called a mother if
[1:10:55] we're sorry we can't do that
[1:10:58] but essentially they're wanting to honor
[1:11:00] at least on some rudimentary level
[1:11:02] that there can be in somebody's mind a
[1:11:05] difference
[1:11:06] that they can elect and choose to be now
[1:11:08] that's not wrong
[1:11:10] just because someone feels that way like
[1:11:13] the fact that they feel that way that's
[1:11:14] why it's wrong
[1:11:16] and and it's wrong for them to cater to
[1:11:19] that and make these changes that's not
[1:11:20] why it's wrong i'll get to why it's
[1:11:22] wrong here in a moment
[1:11:23] but i want to look at what we read in
[1:11:24] daniel chapter 4 verse 33
[1:11:26] and i'm glad we read it in the beginning
[1:11:28] because the bible says that he was
[1:11:29] driven
[1:11:30] from men this means he lost
[1:11:34] all thought of a man he's not thinking
[1:11:37] like a man anymore
[1:11:38] he's been driven from it he's lost
[1:11:40] rational thought and his mind now being
[1:11:42] driven from a man
[1:11:44] he's not identifying as a man anymore he
[1:11:46] identifies as an animal
[1:11:49] and he lives like an animal he eats
[1:11:50] grass like an oxen
[1:11:52] his hair grows out like a beast his
[1:11:54] claws grow out like a bird he's no
[1:11:56] longer identifying and behaving and
[1:11:58] acting and dressing and living and
[1:11:59] eating
[1:12:00] and sleeping as would a man he's been
[1:12:02] driven from men so he's no longer in his
[1:12:04] right mind
[1:12:05] he's thinking and feeling like an animal
[1:12:07] so he acts like an animal
[1:12:09] this is a condition that scientifically
[1:12:11] is known as insania zoanthropica
[1:12:14] it's an insane it's a mental condition
[1:12:16] where one is identifying as an animal
[1:12:19] it's a pro it's when a person thinks
[1:12:21] they're an animal so they act like an
[1:12:22] animal they feel like an animal they
[1:12:24] identify as an animal so they act like
[1:12:26] an animal
[1:12:27] maybe we're more familiar with
[1:12:28] lycanthropia right
[1:12:30] right werewolves somebody who identifies
[1:12:34] thinks and acts like they're a wolf
[1:12:37] so this is a condition that's known to
[1:12:39] man we can even look in the bible and
[1:12:41] see
[1:12:42] an instance where even according to
[1:12:44] prophecy a man would no longer act and
[1:12:47] behave like a man
[1:12:49] but he would identify with a as an
[1:12:52] animal and begin to live and eat and act
[1:12:54] and
[1:12:54] and allow himself to come into the image
[1:12:56] and look like an animal where he lost
[1:12:58] all connection with rational thought and
[1:12:59] what a man is supposed to be
[1:13:02] so it's not wrong for congress to say in
[1:13:04] the event that one might identify
[1:13:07] as a bird we are not going to require
[1:13:09] that nails need to be cut
[1:13:10] in congress grow them out as long as you
[1:13:13] want
[1:13:14] we're going to allow we're not going to
[1:13:15] require that men have short hair we're
[1:13:18] not going to require like they're not
[1:13:19] going to impose these restrictions
[1:13:21] within their congress they're going to
[1:13:22] let anybody act and live how
[1:13:23] identify however they want and we'll go
[1:13:25] ahead and adopt some inclusive language
[1:13:27] so that nobody feels out and since we
[1:13:29] won't we don't want to leave you out
[1:13:30] we'll leave
[1:13:31] everybody out and we'll all be out right
[1:13:34] so it's not so much inclusion as is
[1:13:36] everyone is excluded
[1:13:39] i don't want to be called a mother and
[1:13:41] neither should you be able to be called
[1:13:42] a mother
[1:13:43] so i won't be called anything will be
[1:13:45] they in them and we'll all be they and
[1:13:46] them in person
[1:13:48] there's no chairman anymore it's
[1:13:50] chairperson
[1:13:53] i'm trying there was one that was really
[1:13:55] really funny and i just forgot it
[1:13:58] probably could've used it right now so
[1:14:01] it's not wrong because of that reality
[1:14:05] it's wrong because it diminishes godly
[1:14:07] roles that were originally established
[1:14:09] for a man and a woman
[1:14:11] it's wrong because it flies in the face
[1:14:13] of what god originally ordained for a
[1:14:15] man of war
[1:14:15] it's wrong because it doesn't accord to
[1:14:17] scripture
[1:14:18] it's wrong because it repudiates that
[1:14:20] god has established a man a male to be a
[1:14:23] man
[1:14:23] he's established that a female become a
[1:14:25] woman he's given them the roles and
[1:14:27] identities that relate to womanhood
[1:14:30] so then think about this if you have
[1:14:33] stripped
[1:14:34] in our language now in our code in our
[1:14:36] laws we're going to a general neutral
[1:14:38] society
[1:14:38] and now the role of man the role of
[1:14:41] woman
[1:14:42] and sexes has become an abolish and now
[1:14:44] you have just a gender neutrality
[1:14:46] that's to be in our language and in our
[1:14:47] images and in our laws in the way that
[1:14:49] we establish things
[1:14:50] what image is this in
[1:14:53] it's in the image of satan that is
[1:14:56] neither male nor female
[1:14:58] it is the image of an angel that's not
[1:15:01] made to reproduce
[1:15:02] and has no gender so satan's agenda
[1:15:06] no wonder it would climax in this
[1:15:08] confusion
[1:15:09] and in this kind of representation satan
[1:15:11] wants a family like himself so he wants
[1:15:14] everyone to then leave the image of god
[1:15:17] and to clearly define roles that god
[1:15:18] established for his family
[1:15:20] and have everybody shut their mouths and
[1:15:22] change their image
[1:15:23] so that they can they can come under his
[1:15:25] image that we're all
[1:15:27] angelic-like without gender without
[1:15:29] roles in reproduction
[1:15:35] where's brother hughes when you need him
[1:15:39] matthew 22 29 30 just to emphasize this
[1:15:42] jesus answered and sent him
[1:15:43] ye do air not knowing the scriptures nor
[1:15:45] the power of god for in the resurrection
[1:15:47] they neither marry nor given in marriage
[1:15:49] but are as the angels of god in heaven
[1:15:52] in other words in the resurrection man
[1:15:54] and woman will not enter into a carnal
[1:15:55] relationship they will not have natural
[1:15:57] affections
[1:15:57] they will not procreate they will be as
[1:15:59] angels they are neither male nor female
[1:16:01] they are neither man or woman because
[1:16:03] they do not need to gender
[1:16:06] they do not need to procreate and so
[1:16:09] this is a scripture showing us
[1:16:11] that satan and other angels and angelic
[1:16:13] beings are not
[1:16:14] male or female they are not men or women
[1:16:16] they are not
[1:16:17] tasked with the roles of reproducing so
[1:16:20] satan's agenda is to make
[1:16:21] all mankind be as himself
[1:16:26] think about that
[1:16:30] and to be gender neutral have no
[1:16:34] clearly established roles that a male
[1:16:36] should enter into
[1:16:37] no clearly established roles that a
[1:16:39] female should enter to enter into
[1:16:41] however you want
[1:16:41] but that's not what the truth is that's
[1:16:43] not what the rea the subject
[1:16:44] objective reality is each can do
[1:16:47] whatever they want and then creates on
[1:16:48] the
[1:16:49] on the whole level we are all just
[1:16:51] moving within some spectrum
[1:16:54] and we can we can identify as a man we
[1:16:57] can identify as a woman
[1:17:02] very interesting and satan's design
[1:17:05] cannot produce a true man
[1:17:08] satan's design cannot produce a true
[1:17:10] woman cannot produce a true family
[1:17:14] he's tearing down the divine design that
[1:17:16] pleases god
[1:17:18] it's doing this to keep man back from
[1:17:20] the true image that god intended
[1:17:22] there's there's places in the bible you
[1:17:24] can see the importance of language
[1:17:26] when they took the hebrew children they
[1:17:28] wanted to teach them the tongue of the
[1:17:29] chaldeans
[1:17:30] why did they teach them the tongue of
[1:17:31] the cow dance so they would assimilate
[1:17:33] into the culture of the chaldeans
[1:17:36] you changed the language you changed the
[1:17:38] names you changed the identity
[1:17:39] you're stripping away the very power and
[1:17:41] purpose that god has
[1:17:44] and my point is this what happened in
[1:17:47] the 117th congress
[1:17:48] is not satanic and this is the
[1:17:51] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:17:52] no it just expresses what satan is
[1:17:55] trying to achieve
[1:17:56] spiritually it's the climax of his eden
[1:18:00] and it shows
[1:18:01] what he's trying to oppose spiritually
[1:18:03] and what all the distractions and all
[1:18:04] the side tracks and all the things that
[1:18:06] are taking place
[1:18:07] is to try to keep us from assuming
[1:18:10] the proper roles that god called us to
[1:18:12] as man and as woman
[1:18:15] and being if you want to look at in a
[1:18:17] spiritual sense and a collective body
[1:18:18] says
[1:18:19] keep us from being the bride of christ
[1:18:21] by distracting us
[1:18:22] with the wrong kind of ideals that are
[1:18:24] being lifted up in normative
[1:18:25] christianity
[1:18:26] it's not that it's being lifted up in
[1:18:28] the church of satan but even the image
[1:18:30] that's projected over pulpits and over
[1:18:32] in teachings that relay in books and
[1:18:34] different things paints the wrong
[1:18:35] picture of a man
[1:18:36] the word paints the correct picture of a
[1:18:39] man
[1:18:42] and a woman
[1:18:46] a type satan's agenda the creation of
[1:18:48] male and female
[1:18:50] when god established in the beginning
[1:18:51] was for the fulfillment
[1:18:53] of mankind's purpose they were to
[1:18:55] complement each other
[1:18:58] god's eden
[1:19:02] begins with clearly established sexes
[1:19:06] clearly established genders clearly
[1:19:08] establish roles and identities
[1:19:09] for the purpose of family amen
[1:19:13] satan's eating ends with man and woman
[1:19:15] being abolished
[1:19:17] the phrases confused or even in some
[1:19:21] cases completely rejected
[1:19:24] god's eden began one way we see satan's
[1:19:27] eating ending another way
[1:19:30] so when we look out at what's in the
[1:19:31] world today
[1:19:33] we can look what brother branham said in
[1:19:34] matthew chapter 19 verses 7 and 8.
[1:19:38] why did moses then give us the right
[1:19:40] give us a writing of divorcement
[1:19:41] to put her away he saith unto them
[1:19:45] moses because of the hardness of your
[1:19:47] hearts
[1:19:48] suffered you to put away your wives
[1:19:52] why did god grant
[1:19:55] men the right to divorce their wives
[1:19:58] because they
[1:19:59] left off thinking like adam
[1:20:05] they left off it was the hardness it's
[1:20:08] the harshness this is why malachi says
[1:20:10] you deal treacherously
[1:20:12] you brew you cover up your your hardness
[1:20:14] and your bitterness and your meanness
[1:20:15] with the garment
[1:20:16] and jesus is going right back to that
[1:20:19] all right back to the beginning
[1:20:20] i'm just pointing out what it was in the
[1:20:21] beginning and what jesus is saying in
[1:20:23] the beginning it was one man one woman
[1:20:25] adam didn't put her way and could choose
[1:20:27] from another well then why did god
[1:20:29] why did moses allow us to divorce you
[1:20:30] want to know why god allowed you to
[1:20:32] divorce
[1:20:32] because men aren't men anymore
[1:20:36] they said well that's really harsh
[1:20:37] brother aaron i i know a really good
[1:20:39] brother that had to divorce his wife i'm
[1:20:40] not commenting on where things are today
[1:20:42] i'm commenting on what happened
[1:20:44] thousands of years ago
[1:20:46] conditions have changed that's why
[1:20:50] brother brahm says and the bible says
[1:20:51] that god allowed it and god recognized
[1:20:53] it as righteous
[1:20:55] that's why god granted the exemption so
[1:20:58] to speak
[1:20:59] but from the beginning it was not so
[1:21:03] from the beginning in the beginning one
[1:21:05] man one woman this is what god lifted up
[1:21:07] and i just want to i'm not going to
[1:21:09] finish where i was i want to come to
[1:21:10] this
[1:21:11] i'm just going to interrupt we'll come
[1:21:12] back to these other things as i close
[1:21:14] here
[1:21:15] when brother branham preaches marriage
[1:21:17] and divorce
[1:21:18] anybody heard that before just a few
[1:21:23] um it is so it's heavy
[1:21:27] why is it heavy and it's so direct and
[1:21:30] it's so cutting
[1:21:32] and he sews little things in there
[1:21:33] throughout i'm i'm not get to the real
[1:21:35] woman's place of true sisters and he's
[1:21:37] pointed out but really brother bam is
[1:21:38] just identifying satan's created a
[1:21:40] really bad mess
[1:21:42] really really nasty mess and that's why
[1:21:44] things are mixed up and that's why
[1:21:45] things are the way they are
[1:21:48] and he comes down to it he says you know
[1:21:50] paul in the new testament
[1:21:52] said because of the divorce condition
[1:21:54] and he says it wasn't so from the
[1:21:56] beginning how paul
[1:21:57] was able to give a grace to the church
[1:21:59] it wasn't so from the beginning but
[1:22:00] moses was permitted and god recognized
[1:22:02] it righteous and paul had a right when
[1:22:04] he found his church in that condition
[1:22:05] he says now you believe this to be true
[1:22:08] and believe it to come from god
[1:22:10] and by the vindication of his cloud and
[1:22:12] his message that's brought me this far
[1:22:14] should not god upon that mountain to
[1:22:16] permit me to do the same thing
[1:22:19] to suffer you to go on the way you are
[1:22:21] and do it no more now this is
[1:22:24] specifically relating to
[1:22:27] man becoming husband woman becoming wife
[1:22:31] and how that satan has allowed those
[1:22:33] things to be confused and messed up and
[1:22:36] torn apart
[1:22:37] so as he relates to that part he's
[1:22:39] saying would not god give me
[1:22:41] the grace to suffer you to go on the way
[1:22:43] you are and he says go
[1:22:45] to your wives and live in peace for the
[1:22:47] hours late
[1:22:49] now what i want to emphasize is god has
[1:22:51] a grace in terms of the marital
[1:22:53] relationship
[1:22:55] but he and and the complications that
[1:22:57] have taken place in that
[1:22:58] but he's not going to back off being a
[1:23:01] man
[1:23:02] he's not going to back off you being a
[1:23:04] woman
[1:23:06] these things are immutable these things
[1:23:07] cannot change
[1:23:10] had god wanted to allow for man to
[1:23:12] identify as a woman and for a woman to
[1:23:13] identify as a man
[1:23:14] and have it be turned on its head and
[1:23:16] say it's okay then it would have been
[1:23:17] written in the scripture god would have
[1:23:19] given us prophets the ability to do so
[1:23:21] so when god is dealing with the
[1:23:23] conditions of the world as they exist
[1:23:24] today in satan's evening
[1:23:25] he gives the grace to liberate a man
[1:23:28] from a situation
[1:23:29] that breaks the image that god has but
[1:23:32] you can be as a man still
[1:23:34] in the image of god though you may not
[1:23:36] be able to be the husband though you may
[1:23:38] not be able to be the father
[1:23:39] you can still be a man in the image of
[1:23:41] god though you may not be able to be a
[1:23:43] wife though you may not be able to be a
[1:23:44] mother you can still be a woman in the
[1:23:45] image of god
[1:23:47] so god says don't leave those roles that
[1:23:49] you're in don't break them they still
[1:23:50] represent something very pure
[1:23:51] it's something that god can bless and
[1:23:53] something that can be righteous he says
[1:23:54] live in peace in this late hour the
[1:23:56] coming of the lord is at hand we haven't
[1:23:57] got time to break these things up
[1:23:59] don't you dare try to do it again
[1:24:03] i'm only speaking to my congregation i
[1:24:05] say amen i'm part of that one
[1:24:07] but if you're married and god bore me
[1:24:09] witness on that mountain that i could
[1:24:10] say this
[1:24:11] a supernatural revelation because of the
[1:24:14] open of the seven seals
[1:24:15] and this is the question in god's word
[1:24:17] let them go on
[1:24:18] in as they are in sin no more
[1:24:22] it wasn't so from the beginning that's
[1:24:25] right it wasn't so and it will not be at
[1:24:27] the end
[1:24:28] but under modern conditions
[1:24:32] listen god knows the modern conditions
[1:24:34] we are under
[1:24:35] he's acknowledging them he's saying i
[1:24:37] can give a grace there's a word for you
[1:24:40] under modern conditions as god's servant
[1:24:42] i won't call myself as prophet but i
[1:24:44] believe
[1:24:44] i maybe i would be sent for that i'm
[1:24:47] laying a ground for him that when he
[1:24:48] does come
[1:24:49] but if he wasn't simply so under the
[1:24:52] modern conditions
[1:24:54] listen to what he says i command you to
[1:24:56] go to your home
[1:24:57] with your wife now he's telling the men
[1:25:00] to still be men
[1:25:01] he's telling the women to still be women
[1:25:03] if you're happy with her live with the
[1:25:05] raise your children the admonition of
[1:25:06] god
[1:25:07] but god be merciful though it does not
[1:25:09] conform to the image that god had in the
[1:25:11] beginning he gives a grace
[1:25:14] why because in that office in that place
[1:25:17] a man as a man a woman as a woman god
[1:25:20] will recognize that
[1:25:22] god gives a grace for that he says if
[1:25:24] you're happy stay
[1:25:25] but god be merciful if you ever do that
[1:25:28] again
[1:25:29] you teach your children to never do a
[1:25:31] thing like that bring them up in the
[1:25:33] admonition of god
[1:25:34] and now that you are as you are men
[1:25:37] being men
[1:25:38] women being women husbands being
[1:25:40] husbands wives being wives parents being
[1:25:43] parents
[1:25:43] at the late evening hour that we're
[1:25:45] living in and press towards the mark of
[1:25:47] the high colony in christ jesus
[1:25:49] where all things will be possible
[1:25:54] what a grace but what is he saying
[1:25:59] i cannot make excuses
[1:26:04] and say that under modern conditions a
[1:26:06] man can't be a man
[1:26:08] and under modern conditions a woman
[1:26:10] can't be a woman
[1:26:12] regardless of your modern condition
[1:26:16] god has made you male or has made you
[1:26:18] female
[1:26:19] and god has established a purpose in a
[1:26:22] role
[1:26:23] even in your modern condition god has
[1:26:26] established a purpose for that
[1:26:30] and god spoke so strongly to my heart
[1:26:34] i wasn't i wanted to use this scripture
[1:26:37] last sunday and i was
[1:26:38] you're going to use it another time but
[1:26:41] under modern conditions let me say this
[1:26:42] psalm 68 5-6 some of you may want to
[1:26:45] write this down
[1:26:47] psalm 68 verses 5 and 6 just to confirm
[1:26:49] the promise of god
[1:26:51] he says i will be a father
[1:26:54] of the fatherless and that beautiful
[1:26:58] you may not have a father so i'll be
[1:27:00] your father why
[1:27:02] because i want a family and i want you
[1:27:04] to know what it feels like to be in a
[1:27:05] family
[1:27:06] and a judge of the widows it's a real
[1:27:09] unique way of saying
[1:27:10] i'll be a husband to those who don't
[1:27:12] have a husband
[1:27:15] under modern conditions don't fret don't
[1:27:17] despair
[1:27:18] don't be brokenhearted in the absence of
[1:27:21] a spouse in the absence of a father and
[1:27:23] the absence of a parent in the absence
[1:27:24] of children
[1:27:25] a father the father the judge of the
[1:27:27] widows is god
[1:27:28] in his holy habitation in verse six if
[1:27:31] you're looking at it
[1:27:33] god setteth the solitary
[1:27:36] in families he takes the one man
[1:27:40] who may not have a wife he takes the one
[1:27:43] woman that may not have a husband
[1:27:45] he takes the one person who may not have
[1:27:48] children
[1:27:49] and he sets them in a family
[1:27:53] that's what god's purpose is it will not
[1:27:56] be defeated
[1:27:58] he bringeth out those which are bound
[1:28:00] with chains
[1:28:01] but the rebellious dwell in dry land
[1:28:06] musicians if you would come
[1:28:10] under modern conditions
[1:28:17] under modern conditions
[1:28:22] god does not water down the word god
[1:28:25] does not make excuses
[1:28:27] nor does he condemn
[1:28:31] he gives grace
[1:28:35] he gives grace though the works of satan
[1:28:38] have tainted
[1:28:39] family structure broken up families
[1:28:44] created situations that could maybe
[1:28:47] never in the flesh be remedied
[1:28:49] he says i'll still be a father to you
[1:28:52] you who don't have a father
[1:28:54] i'll still be a husband to you that
[1:28:55] don't have a husband
[1:28:58] you men who aren't fulfilled in a family
[1:29:01] role
[1:29:02] i'll set you in a family
[1:29:07] you know there's something that god will
[1:29:08] redeem
[1:29:11] and nebuchadnezzar was driven from men
[1:29:15] the bible says he left off being a man
[1:29:19] didn't identify as a man anymore and for
[1:29:22] a season he lived contrary
[1:29:24] to what the qualities and the nature and
[1:29:26] the character
[1:29:27] of what a man would be but it was only
[1:29:31] for a season
[1:29:34] i think it might have been seven years
[1:29:37] and daniel chapter 4 verse 34 says at
[1:29:39] the end of the days
[1:29:41] i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes
[1:29:43] into heaven
[1:29:45] in my understanding returned unto me
[1:29:48] [Music]
[1:29:50] god can bring someone back to their
[1:29:53] right mind
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:56] if you haven't been the husband you were
[1:29:58] supposed to be god let this
[1:30:00] mind be in me that was in the bridegroom
[1:30:06] haven't been the wife in the image of a
[1:30:08] wife
[1:30:09] if my if i've been set before the wrong
[1:30:12] image if i've
[1:30:13] my nature's become too hardened and
[1:30:14] callous if i was identifying the wrong
[1:30:16] way oh
[1:30:17] lift up my eyes into heaven and let my
[1:30:19] understanding return unto me
[1:30:24] that i may bless the most high
[1:30:27] and praise and honor him that liveth
[1:30:29] forever
[1:30:31] whose dominion is ever an everlasting
[1:30:33] dominion his kingdom is from generation
[1:30:35] to generation
[1:30:37] here's a man who is driven from the
[1:30:38] qualities of man
[1:30:41] but then his understanding returned i
[1:30:44] could use that as a
[1:30:45] a an example of how the god could take
[1:30:49] some of the worst modern conditions and
[1:30:51] make them whole
[1:30:53] but let it stand for this regardless of
[1:30:56] your marital condition
[1:30:58] regardless of your marital rights
[1:31:00] regardless of family estrangement
[1:31:02] inability to have children
[1:31:05] no prospect of marriage take all that
[1:31:09] away
[1:31:09] god still has a role for the solitary
[1:31:13] god still has a purpose for you as a
[1:31:15] woman
[1:31:16] god still has a purpose for you as a man
[1:31:19] and what you want to be is the man he
[1:31:21] wants you to be what you want to be as
[1:31:23] the woman he wants you to be
[1:31:25] to step into that to show yourself to be
[1:31:28] a man to show yourself to be a woman
[1:31:30] and individually apart from whatever the
[1:31:33] the the social constructs may be
[1:31:35] regardless of whatever my marital
[1:31:36] conditions may be regardless of whatever
[1:31:38] my
[1:31:39] my physical abilities may be whatever
[1:31:41] the modern conditions are
[1:31:43] the conditions of today i can as an
[1:31:46] individual
[1:31:47] take my place in the body of christ to
[1:31:49] be a man
[1:31:51] and you can take your place in the body
[1:31:53] of christ to be a woman
[1:31:55] in the image of god so you're not left
[1:31:59] without a call and you're not left
[1:32:00] without a purpose you're not left
[1:32:01] without family
[1:32:03] this is how to me it just seems to be
[1:32:05] such a grace that's continuing to be
[1:32:06] extended
[1:32:07] the devil has been able to use think
[1:32:09] about it the devil
[1:32:10] takes the very picture of a perfect
[1:32:12] family and uses it to beat you over the
[1:32:14] head with it
[1:32:16] and uses it to cause complexes and
[1:32:18] condemnation
[1:32:19] and takes the wrong image of a man to
[1:32:21] bring people under bondage
[1:32:22] takes the wrong image of a leader the
[1:32:24] wrong image of a pastor to abuse the
[1:32:26] sheep of god but listen
[1:32:27] god wants to take that picture out of
[1:32:29] the hand of man
[1:32:30] and take it and turn it right and then
[1:32:33] you see yourself
[1:32:35] maybe it's not so much important that
[1:32:36] you see where's this man where's that
[1:32:38] woman where's the brother where's the
[1:32:39] mother where's the sister where's the
[1:32:41] dad
[1:32:41] just see yourself and when you see
[1:32:44] yourself you see him
[1:32:45] as a father to the fathers you see him
[1:32:47] as a husband to the wife who has no
[1:32:49] husband
[1:32:51] and you see that he set you the solitary
[1:32:54] in a family
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:33:01] let's bow our heads just remain seated
[1:33:03] for a moment
[1:33:10] [Music]
[1:33:24] [Music]
[1:33:29] says nebuchadnezzar lifted up his eyes
[1:33:31] into heaven
[1:33:34] if there be anyone streaming anyone
[1:33:37] present with heads bowed there's no
[1:33:38] camera in the congregation
[1:33:42] i would just
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:45] spiritually identify
[1:33:49] with who god wants you to be
[1:33:54] and by way and to acknowledge
[1:34:00] that you need a change
[1:34:03] and that you want to align your faith
[1:34:07] and your conviction and your identity
[1:34:10] with what god made you to be
[1:34:13] and you would want to receive this
[1:34:16] understanding as nebuchadnezzar received
[1:34:19] it
[1:34:20] would you raise your hand before the
[1:34:22] lord
[1:34:23] [Music]
[1:34:26] here i am lord i've been influenced by
[1:34:32] the worldly image of a woman i've been
[1:34:34] influenced by the worldly engine of an
[1:34:35] image of a man i've even been influenced
[1:34:37] to think that
[1:34:39] that these things don't matter anymore
[1:34:44] and i and i've maybe i even given up
[1:34:46] hope for those who've come under bondage
[1:34:47] of it and right now you could even
[1:34:49] believe for someone else you'd want to
[1:34:50] raise your hand maybe for somebody else
[1:34:51] who's in a difficult situation say lord
[1:34:53] i believe
[1:34:55] i believe that you could take a man
[1:34:59] who's out there and sin
[1:35:02] and bring him back home to be who he's
[1:35:03] supposed to be
[1:35:05] take a woman bound up with identity
[1:35:09] problems
[1:35:13] and help them come to themselves so many
[1:35:16] hands are raised
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:20] hey i'll say this and let's just be
[1:35:23] brutally honest
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:27] any image that falls short of christ is
[1:35:30] a perverted image
[1:35:32] and i want to be christ-like
[1:35:36] that's what i want to be could we
[1:35:39] i want to say this to create a momentum
[1:35:42] if you would say
[1:35:43] that's your objective as a solitary
[1:35:46] person as male female boy girl
[1:35:51] man or woman you'd want to stand and say
[1:35:54] my objective is christ
[1:35:57] that's my ambition that's my
[1:36:00] longing i can't make excuses anymore
[1:36:04] well i don't have this and i don't have
[1:36:06] that but i have you lord
[1:36:08] and i have a colony as a solitary
[1:36:11] even more so if you have taken this
[1:36:13] solitary and just extended a tremendous
[1:36:15] grace to allow
[1:36:16] this man to be a husband lord let me be
[1:36:18] a christ-like husband if you've extended
[1:36:20] the grace to let this husband be father
[1:36:21] lord let me be a
[1:36:22] godlike father but none of those are
[1:36:26] possible if i'm not the man i ought to
[1:36:28] be
[1:36:30] same for our sisters god bless you let's
[1:36:33] pray our heavenly father
[1:36:36] we receive your grace today lord we
[1:36:39] accept it
[1:36:41] we accept that there's a grace that's
[1:36:43] ministered to us in the light of
[1:36:45] scriptures in
[1:36:46] matthew and malachi and genesis that
[1:36:48] seem to paint
[1:36:50] maybe a condemning and harsh picture of
[1:36:52] marital conditions
[1:36:56] but lord those are
[1:37:00] those are relating to a grace that you
[1:37:03] even extend to those who because of
[1:37:05] fallen conditions because of modern
[1:37:06] conditions
[1:37:08] because of a fallen flesh have seen
[1:37:12] their role of a man compromised they've
[1:37:14] seen their
[1:37:15] opportunity as a wife restricted
[1:37:20] but we realize that by a new birth
[1:37:23] we have become spiritual sons and
[1:37:25] spiritual daughters
[1:37:28] and that identity cannot be stripped
[1:37:30] away from us
[1:37:33] and that though we may have
[1:37:34] circumstances in our development that
[1:37:36] have kept us from
[1:37:37] walking into certain relationships that
[1:37:40] does not
[1:37:41] change the fact that you have made us a
[1:37:44] man or you have made us
[1:37:45] a woman does not
[1:37:48] change the fact that you watched out
[1:37:50] over the seed and allowed me
[1:37:52] to express to present as a male
[1:37:56] and lord under modern conditions with
[1:37:58] biology and
[1:38:00] the backsliding of dna there's
[1:38:02] circumstances that take place and though
[1:38:04] they may not be frequent lord there's
[1:38:06] people that are born
[1:38:08] with a variance with the very horrible
[1:38:13] choices to be made by parents and
[1:38:14] doctors and lord
[1:38:16] we pray for anyone that might be in that
[1:38:18] situation
[1:38:20] that you could align body and spirit
[1:38:24] you could give wisdom under these modern
[1:38:26] conditions when that circumstance would
[1:38:28] allow but lord
[1:38:30] we take our place as what you've made us
[1:38:32] to be
[1:38:34] and i pray lord that as we experience
[1:38:36] this divine love and
[1:38:38] a hope for those that we love and a
[1:38:40] renewal of our own purpose despite our
[1:38:42] situations lord may we have a grace for
[1:38:44] others
[1:38:47] not that we would tell everyone i'll
[1:38:48] remain as you are but that we could show
[1:38:50] them
[1:38:52] a life changed by the word
[1:38:55] we could show them a power of god
[1:38:58] jesus rebuked them in their
[1:39:00] understanding of marriage and
[1:39:01] relationships you don't even understand
[1:39:03] the power of god
[1:39:04] we believe in a god who designed it in
[1:39:06] the beginning he's the one that can take
[1:39:08] it
[1:39:09] back to the original today and i pray
[1:39:12] that you help us to have the right
[1:39:13] disposition of christ
[1:39:15] as christians lord that would not only
[1:39:18] please you
[1:39:20] but that would be a light to others we
[1:39:22] commit ourselves to you now father
[1:39:25] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:39:27] pray amen
