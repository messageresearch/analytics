[0:00] Hebrews
[0:01] 3:16-19. For some, when they had heard,
[0:04] did provoke, how be it not all that came
[0:07] out of Egypt by Moses. But with whom was
[0:10] he grieved 40 years? Was it not with
[0:13] them that had sinned, whose carcasses
[0:15] fell in the wilderness? And to whom
[0:18] swear he that they should not enter into
[0:20] his rest, but to them that believed not.
[0:24] So we see that they could not enter in
[0:26] because of unbelief. What a important
[0:30] principle. They could not enter because
[0:33] of
[0:34] unbelief. You could take your
[0:40] seats. I'm going to take the title today
[0:42] of cosmetic Christians. And um there's a
[0:46] lot that's meant and to be conveyed in
[0:48] the use of the phrase cosmetic
[0:52] Christians. Uh we had ministered on
[0:54] pseudo Christrist and now cosmetic
[0:56] Christians. We could say that pseudorist
[0:58] produce cosmetic Christians. And I want
[1:01] to give this definition at the outset so
[1:03] you understand where I'm coming from
[1:05] with the use of the term cosmetic. Uh it
[1:07] would be superficial, something that's
[1:09] surface only. If something is cosmetic,
[1:11] it's really only worried about the
[1:13] outward appearance. And cosmetics or
[1:16] cosmetic is referring to the art of
[1:18] beautifying the body. So it's things
[1:20] that are external. not the heart, not
[1:22] the inward things, not the spirit, but
[1:24] something that is applied or some sort
[1:26] of technique or process that beautifies
[1:29] the outside and isn't worried about
[1:31] maybe the inside structure or the inner
[1:33] part. So you could see just from saying
[1:36] this, what we may be referring to, what
[1:38] we may be thinking about is something
[1:40] that is only a Christian externally or
[1:42] by appearance or only the effort is made
[1:44] to the external things and not the
[1:47] internal eternal things. When we
[1:49] ministered last Sunday on pseudo
[1:51] Christrist, we were looking at the
[1:53] principle of the unbeliever pretending
[1:55] to be a believer and that that person is
[2:00] used by the devil to deceive and to
[2:03] discourage to dissuade the believer from
[2:06] going forward in the word of God. So
[2:08] teaching on three kinds of believers
[2:10] isn't meant to categorize everybody, but
[2:13] it's really to enlighten the believer to
[2:15] the fact that there's going to be those
[2:16] that disagree completely and disbelieve
[2:20] and reject outright what you believe.
[2:22] But then there's also going to be those
[2:23] that pretend to believe. And in
[2:26] pretending to believe, it may signal to
[2:29] you certain things that if you accept
[2:30] them as a believer, it would discourage
[2:33] you or dissuade you or deceive you or
[2:35] cause a struggle. So, it's not that we
[2:37] would put other people in categories,
[2:39] but that we would just recognize for
[2:41] ourselves that there's other ways that
[2:43] people present and there's other ways
[2:45] that people believe that become a
[2:47] challenge to the believer. And if
[2:50] thinking outside of yourself uh makes
[2:52] you a little bit nervous because of how
[2:54] these things could be used, uh if we
[2:56] believe that there's an elect of God and
[2:57] a non-elect, we believe there's a seed
[2:58] of God and serpent seed. uh serpent
[3:01] seed, non-elect, uh foolish virgin can
[3:03] all be put into a three-sided billy club
[3:06] that can be used to beat people up. And
[3:07] if that makes you nervous, then just
[3:09] look within yourself and recognize that
[3:11] being born of a woman, I have a
[3:13] makeeliever in me. I have an unbeliever
[3:15] in me. I have these attitudes and this
[3:17] hybrid nature because in uh
[3:20] makebelieving is a believer. An
[3:22] unbeliever impersonates a believer
[3:25] creating a hybrid called a makebeliever.
[3:28] So it's a hybrid of the belief maybe
[3:30] externally or cosmetically uh but yet uh
[3:33] unbelief in the inside pretending to be
[3:36] a believer on the outside. That's what
[3:38] pseudo means. Something that purports to
[3:40] be something that it is not as a way of
[3:43] seducing uh seducing someone. We were
[3:45] using it in the concept of seducing
[3:47] someone else into unbelief or make
[3:50] believe. Now if we could read our text
[3:52] again I think this would be helpful to
[3:54] me. I appreciate your alertness this
[3:56] morning. That's just feels such a
[3:58] welcoming uh uh spirit and just a real
[4:01] pull on the word of God. So it excites
[4:03] me. Hebrews 3 16-19 again. For some when
[4:08] they had heard did provoke. This is the
[4:11] day of the provocation when the children
[4:12] of Israel provoked God. It's a very
[4:15] specific instance in the scripture. This
[4:17] critical point where God is provoked
[4:20] because they did not believe. How be it
[4:23] not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
[4:26] Not all did provoke is one way you could
[4:28] say that. But with whom was he grieved
[4:30] 40
[4:32] years. Was it not them that had sinned?
[4:35] So those that sinned grieved the Lord
[4:38] and they died. Their carcasses fell in
[4:41] the wilderness. He's asking a question
[4:42] to make the point. We can conclude from
[4:44] the question that God was grieved with
[4:46] those that had sinned and because of
[4:48] God's grief, they died in the
[4:50] wilderness. And then he states it this
[4:52] way. And to whom swear he that they
[4:54] could not should not enter into his
[4:56] rest. What was the rest? Crossing that
[4:58] Jordan, entering into the promised land
[5:00] to dwell in the promised land. So who
[5:03] was it that he swore swore would not
[5:05] enter into rest? Them that believed not.
[5:08] And he's asking the question, but to
[5:09] them that believed not. So we could say
[5:11] them that believed not, he swore would
[5:13] not enter into rest. Those that believed
[5:16] not were those that sinned and therefore
[5:18] they died in the wilderness. And then he
[5:20] summarizes it. So we see that they could
[5:23] not enter in because of unbelief. That's
[5:27] our that's really the enemy. We sin is
[5:30] unbelief. And when we see homosexuality
[5:32] or we see drug use or we see struggling
[5:35] with uh uh certain perversions or we see
[5:37] something happen that that in itself is
[5:39] an attribute of a place that the we have
[5:42] allowed ourselves to be compromised in
[5:44] faith. Compromised in terms of belief.
[5:47] And so there's a lot of things we can
[5:49] say are the attributes and
[5:50] characteristics of sin, but ultimately
[5:52] comes down to losing that battle of
[5:55] faith and belief. I think that should be
[5:57] encouraging to realize that my faith is
[6:00] the victory that I have to get o
[6:01] overcome the attributes of sin. I just
[6:05] need to overcome unbelief. And what
[6:06] else? How else can we do that but by
[6:09] believing? Just believing saying this is
[6:11] what I believe. This is where I'm going
[6:13] to stake uh uh my faith. And verse five
[6:16] of the book of Judah, it says, "I will
[6:18] therefore put you in remembrance, though
[6:19] you once knew this. How that the Lord
[6:22] having saved the people out of the land
[6:24] of Egypt afterward destroyed them that
[6:26] believed not." Where were they
[6:28] destroyed? It says their carcasses fell
[6:30] in the wilderness that fell, laid low.
[6:32] They were overthrown in the wilderness.
[6:35] So this is and what caused them to be
[6:37] overthrown in the wilderness? Unbelief.
[6:40] And this is where we made the point on
[6:43] God led them out of Egypt and they're in
[6:46] the wilderness. And we'll see this as we
[6:49] read
[6:51] uh in in numbers. We'll get to numbers
[6:53] here in a moment. But what we were
[6:54] trying to show you is that that make
[6:56] belief, how that it's more dangerous
[6:58] than unbelief to the believer because
[7:01] it's subtle. It's fake. It pretends. And
[7:06] so if something purports to be genuine
[7:09] faith and you have genuine faith and
[7:12] then it alters or varies or points to or
[7:16] suggests or says something, you're more
[7:18] likely to be influenced,
[7:21] right? I mean, if the pope all of a
[7:23] sudden came today and uh and his
[7:25] weakened form now came and started
[7:27] telling you this is what you need to do
[7:29] and started teaching things, we'd all
[7:30] look at each other, I ain't kissing that
[7:32] ring. Right? But then let something
[7:36] raise up within the message and quotes
[7:38] brother Bradom and preaches very
[7:39] dynamically and does certain things.
[7:41] There's a lot of people that'll kiss the
[7:43] ring and join the cult
[7:45] because it purports to be the same.
[7:49] And that's just that I'm just using that
[7:52] as an example. Not that I have anyone in
[7:54] particular in mind, but that those are
[7:56] ways that this has happened through
[7:58] years and through decades. It's that
[8:00] which is the closest to what we believe.
[8:02] It through its make believe or through
[8:04] its impersonation that poses the
[8:06] greatest danger to the believer. In 1
[8:09] Corinthians 10:es 1 to6, moreover,
[8:13] brethren, I would not that ye should be
[8:15] ignorant. How that all our fathers were
[8:16] under the cloud. Now, this is where
[8:19] really want you to zero in on this
[8:21] because those that grieved God, those
[8:23] that sinned, and those that believed not
[8:26] were not
[8:28] without vindication or the presence of
[8:31] God or miracles or blessing. All our
[8:34] fathers were under the cloud. All the
[8:36] children of Israel passed through the
[8:37] sea, were all baptized unto Moses in the
[8:40] cloud and in the sea, and did all eat
[8:41] the same spiritual meat, and did all
[8:44] drink the same spiritual drink? for they
[8:46] drank of that spiritual rock that
[8:48] followed them. And that rock was Christ.
[8:52] So they all had participated in this
[8:54] very this supernatural exodus. But with
[8:56] many of them, God was not well
[8:59] pleased. And why was God not pleased?
[9:01] Well, without faith, it's impossible to
[9:03] please him. So the word that they heard
[9:05] not being mixed with faith ultimately
[9:07] displeased the Lord or grieved him. It
[9:09] says, "For they were overthrown in the
[9:11] wilderness." You see, in the New
[9:13] Testament, that's faith that is
[9:14] overthrown. They were laid low and they
[9:17] died in the desert because of unbelief.
[9:21] And he says this verse six, this is huge
[9:23] here for us or huge maybe if that's how
[9:26] you say it. Now these things were our
[9:29] examples
[9:31] to the intent we should not lust after
[9:34] evil things as they also lusted. God has
[9:37] set these things forth. The Exodus
[9:40] portrayed very real things. It had very
[9:42] practical implications, very real
[9:44] promises to the Jews, very literal
[9:46] physical things. It's a God's promise to
[9:48] them, God moving supernaturally. But
[9:50] now, as the spiritual body of Christ, it
[9:53] is an example to us that we should not
[9:56] lust after evil things. So there there's
[10:00] our Exodus example. This is what we
[10:02] learn from the Exodus is that there was
[10:05] unbelief in the Exodus. There was
[10:07] unbelief in their hearts and that
[10:09] unbelief caused them to lust.
[10:12] It moved them. It persuaded them. It
[10:14] caused them uh to do things that were
[10:17] displeasing to God. So we want to use
[10:19] this example of the Exodus how that sin
[10:23] unbelief is what caused them to fall and
[10:26] to die in the wilderness. So if I could
[10:28] say this, Satan's goal is to cause you
[10:32] to disbelieve.
[10:33] His goal is to cause you to doubt. Now,
[10:35] we could say, "Well, what Satan wants me
[10:36] to do is lust as a young man and do
[10:39] something I shouldn't and and look at
[10:42] something or or or it's cause me to
[10:44] think about something or cause me to uh
[10:46] go and do something that that's what the
[10:47] devil wants you to do." No, what the
[10:49] devil wants you to do is doubt and
[10:51] disbelieve God. So, if he causes you to
[10:53] make a mistake and you wonder, you get
[10:55] cold, you get into a tail spin, you
[10:56] backslide a little little bit, Satan's
[10:59] not satisfied. He wants to work that and
[11:01] utilize that as a way of causing you to
[11:04] doubt God, doubt your election, doubt
[11:07] God's love for you, doubt his
[11:08] forgiveness, whatever it might be. But
[11:10] he wants to create enough space for you
[11:12] to begin to move within this question
[11:14] of, "Well, maybe I can't get it. Maybe
[11:16] I'm not saved. Maybe God doesn't love
[11:18] me. Or maybe God's promise isn't true.
[11:21] Maybe this isn't what's right." That's
[11:23] his goal. If he can get you there, he'll
[11:25] let you do whatever you want within that
[11:26] space. Amen.
[11:29] If it's dressing up as a drag queen and
[11:31] reading little kids stories in
[11:32] libraries, he'll let you do that. If
[11:34] it's going to church and living a clean
[11:36] life, as long as there's faith,
[11:39] unbelief, and doubt, as long as that's
[11:41] you're in that space, he'll let you do
[11:43] whatever you want. Brother Ram talked
[11:44] about going out on this end in the world
[11:46] or going out on this religious end in
[11:48] impersonations. He said he'll let you do
[11:50] either one.
[11:52] Now, if we could look at Numbers 11:es
[11:55] 4, 5, and 6. I know this is maybe at my
[11:58] last overlap
[12:00] scripture. And the mixed multitude that
[12:04] was among them fell a lusting. We just
[12:06] read how that God in the New Testament,
[12:10] Paul says that the Exodus is an example
[12:12] to us to teach us and to show us that we
[12:14] should not lust after evil things as
[12:18] they lusted and that through unbelief we
[12:20] die and perish, fall short of the
[12:21] promise. So here it says there was a
[12:23] mixed multitude that was among them that
[12:25] started to lust. This mixed multitude
[12:27] suggests or tells us and identifies how
[12:30] that there was Israelites, Jews who were
[12:33] born as Israelites, the c uh that came
[12:36] out and they
[12:39] themselves were of the circumcision. A
[12:41] lot of ways we could describe it. They
[12:42] were Jews. That's Israel. But then there
[12:44] was also non-Israel that left with them.
[12:47] They were non-Jews. So there was Jews
[12:49] and Gentiles that left together. When we
[12:53] say that there's Jews, in other words,
[12:54] by birth, they had a promise uh to them
[12:57] that God would send them a deliverer.
[12:59] They had this inheritance in the
[13:01] promised land by right, by birth, by and
[13:03] and even land that had been promised to
[13:05] Abraham and his seed or the children of
[13:07] Israel. And even we could say even by
[13:10] purchase or by possession and right,
[13:12] they they had this right to go back to
[13:14] that land. But then there was others who
[13:15] had never been there, maybe weren't born
[13:17] of that family. And so they're kind of
[13:18] interlopers. They're tagging along and
[13:21] there the crowd and the Bible says
[13:23] immediately and the children of Israel
[13:25] also wept again. We're told that the
[13:29] non-Israelites begin to lust and
[13:32] immediately the children of Israel, not
[13:35] the non-Israelites, but the children of
[13:36] Israel began to cry and weep and said,
[13:39] "Who shall give us flesh to eat?" meat.
[13:43] I don't want a vegan diet. Give me meat.
[13:45] We remember the fish we did eat. maybe
[13:47] pescatarian. We did eat in Egypt freely
[13:50] the cucumbers and the melons and the
[13:51] leaks and the onions and the garlic.
[13:53] There goes the carnivore diet. But our
[13:55] soul is dried away. There's nothing at
[13:58] all besides this mana before our
[14:01] eyes. The crowd or the makebeliever
[14:04] caused the Israelites to complain.
[14:09] It caused them to lust and to begin to
[14:11] question. So as Israel traveled, there
[14:14] was unbelievers that traveled with them.
[14:16] And it was those unbelievers or the
[14:18] crowd that actually begins to cause
[14:20] Israel to stumble. Now they say there's
[14:23] nothing at all but this mana we
[14:25] remember. Think of these things. They
[14:26] remember the fish, the cucumbers, the
[14:28] melons, the leaks, the onions, and the
[14:30] garlic. And our stomachs said right
[14:34] start thinking, man, this is this is
[14:36] sounding really
[14:37] good. I want you to recognize in Exodus
[14:41] 3
[14:42] 7-9 what they remember. And really more
[14:46] importantly, what they forgot, the Lord
[14:48] said, now when he comes down and he
[14:49] appears unto Moses, he says, "I have
[14:51] surely seen the affliction of my people
[14:54] which are in Egypt." Notice he does not
[14:55] mention the fish, the melons, the
[14:57] cucumbers, the garlics, and the leaks,
[14:59] and have heard the cry by reason of
[15:01] their task masters, not their heartburn
[15:02] or indigestion. For I know their
[15:05] sorrows, and I am come down to deliver
[15:08] them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
[15:10] I'm going to take you from your
[15:12] affliction, your taskmasters, and take
[15:14] you to verse eight. And to bring them up
[15:17] out of that land of oppression,
[15:20] affliction, slavery, bondage unto a good
[15:23] land, and a large unto a land flowing
[15:26] with milk and honey. So God is mindful
[15:30] of their diet. He's mindful of the food
[15:32] that they eat under the place of the
[15:34] Canaanites and the Hittites and the
[15:35] Amorites and the Perizzites and the
[15:37] Hivites and the Jebusites. So he
[15:39] recognizes that there will be enemies in
[15:41] that land. He says, "Now therefore,
[15:43] behold, the cry of the children of
[15:46] Israel has come unto me and I have also
[15:48] seen the oppression wherewith the
[15:51] Egyptians oppress them."
[15:55] This is God's promise to them when he
[15:57] comes down and he meets with
[15:59] Moses. And now as they begin to
[16:01] complain, let's compare where they say,
[16:04] "Who is going to give us meat to eat? We
[16:06] remember fish and cucumbers, melons,
[16:08] leaks, and onions. Our souls are
[16:10] depressed and we're anxious and we're d
[16:13] we have no ambition. We have no hope.
[16:15] There's nothing at all but this
[16:18] mana. What were they doing? They were
[16:21] complaining against God. Their lust were
[16:25] contrary to God's word. This is fruits
[16:28] of unbelief. The these are I want you to
[16:30] recognize that what it is is God said,
[16:31] "I'll bring you into a land flowing with
[16:33] milk and honey." And instead of them
[16:35] looking at the man and say, "Man, I
[16:36] can't wait till I don't have this
[16:38] anymore. I can't wait till I can get to
[16:40] that place that is flowing with milk and
[16:42] honey. It's flown with milk. That means
[16:44] there's meat to eat as well. Flowing
[16:45] with milk and honey. I can't wait till I
[16:47] can get there." A and used what God
[16:50] promised as motivation to get out of
[16:52] their present condition. They looked
[16:53] backwards. And what would that indicate?
[16:56] They thought more about their ability to
[16:58] get back where they were and go back to
[17:00] they what they had before than to have
[17:02] faith in the promise that God could lead
[17:04] them to that place of a land, a blessed
[17:07] land flown with milk and honey.
[17:10] It was that mixed multitude that fell a
[17:12] lusting and the co the complainer or the
[17:15] makeeliever caused them to forget God's
[17:17] promise of milk and honey. That's right.
[17:21] But more importantly, it made them
[17:23] forget the pain they were suffering
[17:27] because they didn't the scripture
[17:29] doesn't suggest that they go, "Man, we
[17:30] used to eat fish or maybe at least
[17:32] caught fish, right? Used to go fishing.
[17:35] We used to eat garlic and melons and
[17:36] cucumbers and we could make pickles out
[17:38] of that and we could do this and we
[17:39] could do that and everything was really
[17:41] really good and and and life was great
[17:43] and and it doesn't enter into the
[17:45] conversation." I said, "But man, do you
[17:46] really remember how bad we actually had
[17:48] it?
[17:50] Do you remember how bad it was in
[17:52] Pentecost? Do you remember how bad it
[17:54] was in denominations? Do you remember
[17:55] how bad it was in false doctrine? Do you
[17:57] remember how bad it was in unbelief? Do
[17:59] you remember bad it was in the world?
[18:03] And for them, they had forgot the
[18:06] affliction, their sorrows, their task
[18:08] masters, the oppression.
[18:12] So, not only did they forget the promise
[18:13] that God would bring them to a place
[18:15] where they could eat as well as they
[18:16] wanted to, they forgot the pain of the
[18:18] bondage and all they thought about is
[18:20] maybe how good they had it in a very
[18:22] carnal shallow
[18:25] aspect. Now, God having made the promise
[18:27] that he would bring them into a good
[18:29] land or a land that was promised, we
[18:31] could call it the promised land or
[18:33] promised land in Numbers 13:es 1:3. I
[18:37] think I'm on a roll here of just using
[18:38] three uh each time.
[18:42] Glory. Uh well, I guess I use six in
[18:45] first Corinthians. So, but if you add
[18:47] Jude, that's seven.
[18:49] Glory. Numbers chapter 13. And the Lord
[18:52] spake unto Moses, saying, "Send thou
[18:54] men." This is God making this request.
[18:56] God is saying, "Send spies. Send thou
[18:58] men that they may search the land of
[19:00] Canaan, which I give unto the children
[19:02] of Israel. Of every tribe of the fathers
[19:05] shall you send a man, every one of a
[19:07] ruler among them. Why would God ask him
[19:09] to do this? Did God need spies?
[19:13] Did God need the intelligence? Did God
[19:15] need the intel? Like, go figure this
[19:18] out, come back to me, let me know. I I'm
[19:19] in a blind spot here, right? I need my
[19:22] calvary to go uh cavalry to go before
[19:24] me, get out there, see what's there,
[19:26] report back, and let me know what the
[19:27] enemy is doing. God didn't need the
[19:29] spies. What Israel needed was the
[19:31] testimonial.
[19:33] And Moses by the commandment of the Lord
[19:35] sent them from the wilderness of Piron.
[19:37] All those men were heads. Now they're
[19:38] heads. They're leaders of the children
[19:41] of Israel. God wants them to see for
[19:44] themselves what he promised. Now God had
[19:48] made the promise and they had already
[19:50] began to fail on just taking him at his
[19:52] word. So God says, "Well, let me go
[19:55] ahead and show you the evidence. If the
[19:56] fact that I can cause mana to come out
[19:58] of the sky supernaturally isn't enough,
[20:00] why don't we go ahead and have somebody
[20:02] go and report back with physical
[20:04] evidence of the promised land so that
[20:07] you could see for your eyes that what I
[20:09] have said is true. So God had the spies
[20:12] go, the leaders, the men, the elders. We
[20:14] can maybe say ministry of those that
[20:16] could go in and spy it out, find it, and
[20:18] bring back the evidence that what God
[20:21] said was true.
[20:22] So he wants them to
[20:24] see the promise not that they could try
[20:27] to replicate an Eden in the wilderness
[20:29] but to motivate them to get there. So in
[20:32] verse 25 to 28 it says and they
[20:36] returned from searching of the
[20:39] land 40 after 40
[20:43] days and they went and came to Moses and
[20:46] to
[20:47] Aaron and to all the congregation of the
[20:50] children of Israel under the wilderness
[20:51] of Piran to Kades. So Kadesh is this
[20:53] place where this happens. So they went
[20:55] they searched out. You could read in the
[20:56] intervening verses how they went out and
[20:58] they looked, the grapes, the things that
[20:59] they brought back, the places there that
[21:01] they sought out, the rivers and the
[21:03] fields, and they brought back word unto
[21:06] them, unto and unto all the
[21:08] congregation, and showed them the fruit
[21:10] of the land, beautiful types that we
[21:13] could see here. They brought back word,
[21:14] witness, testimony, fruit, evidence that
[21:16] they could see. And they told him and
[21:18] said, "We came into the land
[21:20] whetherither thou sentest us, and surely
[21:23] it flowth milk and honey, and this is
[21:26] the fruit of it." By their own
[21:28] experience, they could testify that what
[21:30] God promised Moses and the message he
[21:32] had been giving them was absolutely
[21:34] true.
[21:37] Now, notice this other side to it.
[21:38] Nevertheless, the people be strong that
[21:40] dwell in the land, and the cities are
[21:42] walled and very great. And moreover, we
[21:44] saw the children of Anoch. Anoch
[21:48] there, their witness is God, what God
[21:52] said is true. That their what they spied
[21:55] out, the intel that they brought back
[21:57] confirm God's promise. It is a land
[21:59] flown with milk and honey. They had the
[22:01] fruits of it. And so, not only did it
[22:03] tell them that God was right about the
[22:05] land, but it was right about what was
[22:07] dwelling there. Because he said to
[22:09] Moses, and they certainly would have
[22:10] been taught, it's not empty. You're
[22:13] going to have an enemy. And I won't just
[22:14] drive them all out at once, but little
[22:15] by little by little and little, you will
[22:17] drive them out from before he. Amen.
[22:21] So, Numbers chapter
[22:23] 13:30. We'll continue with uh
[22:27] 31-33. Just focus on verse 30 now for a
[22:30] moment. And Caleb,
[22:33] uh we we could I guess we could have
[22:35] just as easily read verse 29. That shows
[22:37] that they're talking about these
[22:40] uh these inhabitants that live there.
[22:42] And so Caleb sees that there's maybe
[22:44] some unrest, maybe too much focus on the
[22:46] children of Anch and the inhabitants.
[22:48] And Ca Caleb steilled the people before
[22:51] Moses and said, "Happy birthday, brother
[22:55] Caleb. How neat that he's going to be a
[22:56] central figure to my sermon this
[22:58] morning." And I got him right
[23:00] here. Caleb calmed everybody down in the
[23:03] midst of all the clamor. He said, "Let
[23:05] us go up at once and possess it, for we
[23:09] are able to overcome it." Amen. This is
[23:12] the true nature of Caleb here. No matter
[23:14] what he had seen, he says, no matter
[23:16] what he had experienced, he speaks
[23:18] according to the word. He speaks
[23:21] according to the promise. This is his
[23:23] confidence in God's promise, his faith.
[23:25] He confesses what he believes.
[23:29] Now, that doesn't mean that Caleb never
[23:31] saw the tall enemies. Doesn't mean he
[23:34] didn't see the walled cities. Didn't
[23:36] mean that he didn't see them and say,
[23:37] "There's no way we could ever beat these
[23:39] guys in ourselves. These guys are
[23:41] warriors. They've defend built up wall.
[23:42] We're nothing but
[23:44] uh travelers right now. We're a bunch of
[23:47] a band of gypsies wandering through the
[23:49] wilderness living in tents eating only
[23:51] bread and we're going to somehow defeat
[23:53] all these
[23:54] enemies. But he spoke. Let's go now and
[23:58] possess it. We are able to overcome it
[24:01] based upon
[24:03] what did he run the analytics?
[24:08] He say that um nine times out of 10 a
[24:10] group this of this size if we can do
[24:12] this we can beat these people and he
[24:14] figured it out. No, he just looked at
[24:15] God said I will give you the land. I
[24:18] will drive them out from before you. And
[24:19] so he said I don't I'm not I don't know
[24:22] the logistics. I don't know exactly how
[24:24] he's going to do it but we're able to do
[24:27] it. Amen.
[24:29] But the men that went up with him, verse
[24:31] 31, said, "We be not able to go up
[24:34] against the people, for they are
[24:37] stronger than
[24:38] we." And they brought up an evil report
[24:41] of the land. I want you to look at this
[24:43] as a lie. An evil report. They slandered
[24:46] it. They lied about the land and God,
[24:48] which they had searched out unto the
[24:50] searched unto the children of Israel,
[24:51] saying, "The land through which we've
[24:53] gone to search it, it is a land." Now
[24:56] they don't say flowing with milk and
[24:57] honey and they don't say that it has
[24:59] these inhabitants but they say that
[25:01] eateth up the inhabitants thereof and
[25:03] all the people that we saw in it are men
[25:05] of great stature and we and there we saw
[25:08] the giants the son of sons of Anoch
[25:10] which come of the giants and we were in
[25:13] our own sight as grasshoppers
[25:18] and so we were in their sight.
[25:21] Their words were an insult to God.
[25:25] And what are the rabbitical teachings
[25:27] and the uh they phrase it this way. They
[25:29] hurled invective toward on
[25:32] high. This
[25:35] insult and they say about the land that
[25:38] we cannot take it. The men of great
[25:40] stature are bigger than us and we are
[25:42] giant. We are grasshoppers in our own
[25:45] sight. But Philip, I remember brother
[25:46] Eric Reek preaching uh grasshopper
[25:49] mentality decades ago. uh giant killer
[25:54] faith or giant faith and grasshopper
[25:55] mentality. It was a uh I remember the
[25:58] title for sure. I remember much of the
[25:59] sermon, but maybe I'm getting a little
[26:01] bit wrong. Please reach out to your
[26:02] family network and get the correct title
[26:04] for me. I've often said that between
[26:06] Sister Carol, Brother Phillip, they're
[26:07] related to everybody in the message. And
[26:10] so there's your network right
[26:12] there. We are in our own side as
[26:15] grasshoppers. And now they could speak
[26:18] about themselves individually. Those 10
[26:20] could at least say, "Well, I felt like a
[26:21] grasshopper in their own sight." But he
[26:23] said, "So were so we were in their
[26:25] sight." You catch that? They did not
[26:29] consider what God had made them in their
[26:34] sight.
[26:36] They just assumed because they felt
[26:38] little, because they felt worthless,
[26:39] because they felt small. and compared to
[26:42] Anoch and these giants that they felt
[26:44] like grasshoppers. They never considered
[26:46] what God could make them look like to
[26:48] the giants.
[26:50] He never they never considered God's
[26:52] promise. They never considered God's
[26:54] word and what God could do. So, they
[26:56] insulted God by their commentary.
[27:00] Caleb believed the word of God. But it
[27:02] was these
[27:04] unbelievers, these unbelieving spies
[27:06] that lied and hurled insults towards
[27:10] God.
[27:11] Now the very next verse is chapter 14
[27:13] verse one. So there's not a break in the
[27:15] scripture but by our divisions of
[27:17] chapters immediately after they talk
[27:20] about grasshopper with this grasshopper
[27:22] mentality.
[27:25] uh they impact and it goes
[27:31] viral and all the congregation lifted up
[27:34] their voice and cried and the people
[27:36] wept that
[27:38] night and all the children of Israel
[27:41] murmured against Moses and against Aaron
[27:43] on the word of 10 spies who brought back
[27:46] all the evidence they would ever need
[27:47] that God's word was true and in the face
[27:50] of a witness who went and said we can do
[27:53] it that caused all the congregation to
[27:57] weep. And they said, "Would God that we
[28:01] had died in the land of Egypt or would
[28:04] God we had died in this wilderness?"
[28:08] This is this is loser mentality.
[28:11] This is give up.
[28:14] This is a deliberate choice to not to
[28:18] not even fight against a visceral
[28:20] reaction. Man, I'm scared to death. I
[28:22] I'm worried that that they they give
[28:25] into the fear, the loathing, the doubt.
[28:27] They give into the thoughts of
[28:28] fragility. They give in the thoughts of
[28:30] weakness. And it's saying, "I'm weak,
[28:31] but God in you, I'm strong. I'm unable.
[28:33] I'm a grasshopper, but Lord, you're
[28:35] greater than that. You can use a
[28:37] grasshopper."
[28:38] I've seen how what they can do in the
[28:40] plagues. Send us as grasshoppers. Lord,
[28:43] let us eat the land itself. Let it not
[28:45] eat us up. But no, they gave into those
[28:48] feelings of doubt and fear. Said, "We
[28:50] wish we would have died in Egypt. We
[28:52] wish we'd die in the wilderness. And
[28:54] wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto
[28:55] this land to fall by the sword that our
[28:58] wives and our children should be a prey.
[29:01] Were it not better for us to return into
[29:03] Egypt? Rather rather be slaves than to
[29:06] fight for freedom.
[29:08] Rather go back to bondage to the leaks
[29:11] and the onions and the garlic and the
[29:12] fish and the melons and the cucumbers
[29:14] and be
[29:16] slaves. Notice what the things they they
[29:19] don't mind if they can be tickled in
[29:20] this area. They don't mind the
[29:22] bondage versus just abandoning
[29:24] themselves to God's promise.
[29:28] Just taking God at his word. They said
[29:30] one to another, "Let us make a
[29:33] captain. Let us return into Egypt." The
[29:36] makeeliever will always find their false
[29:39] prophet.
[29:40] They will find their pseudo Christ who
[29:42] will tickle their fancy and lead them to
[29:44] the place where they can eat what they
[29:46] want and and suggest that they're better
[29:49] now.
[29:50] Because the God- called ministries
[29:52] failed or this has failed or that has
[29:53] failed and now we've been led to where
[29:56] we can be taken care of. We can be fed,
[29:58] but it's a reverse back to bondage. Make
[30:01] a captain over us that we can be led
[30:03] back into Egypt. Then Moses and Aaron
[30:06] fell on their faces before all the
[30:07] assembly of the congregation of the
[30:08] children of Israel. And Joshua, is
[30:10] Joshua here? Nope. Okay. and Joshua the
[30:13] son of Nun, and Caleb
[30:16] the son of Martin and Pearla, which were
[30:18] of them that searched the land, rent
[30:20] their
[30:21] clothes. And they spoke unto all the
[30:24] company of the children of Israel,
[30:25] saying, "The land which we pass through
[30:27] to search." I want you to notice how two
[30:29] stand up in the face of two million.
[30:32] They don't care what's going viral. They
[30:34] don't care what the bully pulpit says.
[30:35] They don't care uh uh what the what the
[30:38] wave is and what the crowd is doing.
[30:39] They don't care about the climate.
[30:43] They don't care about the cancel
[30:44] culture. You name it. They say, "Wait a
[30:46] minute. The land which we pass through
[30:48] to search it is an exceeding good land.
[30:50] They want to bring it back to the truth,
[30:52] not the spin, not the lies. If the Lord
[30:56] delight in us, then he will bring us
[30:58] into this land and give it us a land
[31:01] which flowth with milk and honey." They
[31:02] stayed true to God's promise. They
[31:05] didn't embellish. They didn't lie.
[31:06] Notice they didn't say, "Oh, there's
[31:08] really no enemies there. There's no
[31:09] giants there."
[31:11] Look, it's already set up our age. I
[31:13] actually went into a culde-sac that had
[31:15] your name on it. And I went to a place
[31:17] that had this market there and that
[31:19] market there. Everything was No, there
[31:20] was no lies. Spoke honestly,
[31:24] didn't deny the reality. Yes, there's
[31:26] battles. Yes, there's hardships. Yes,
[31:27] there's wars and there's fighting.
[31:30] So, the only answer is to stay true to
[31:32] God's word. Verse 9, only rebel not ye
[31:34] against the
[31:35] Lord. Neither fear ye the people of the
[31:38] land. They're there, but just don't be
[31:39] afraid of them. For they are bred for
[31:41] us.
[31:43] Hallelujah.
[31:45] Their defense is departed from them. And
[31:47] the Lord is with us. Fear them not.
[31:54] Take God at his word. Believe the word.
[31:56] Word only. Only believe.
[31:58] But all the congregation bade stone them
[32:00] with stones. That's the
[32:02] response. Don't rebel against the Lord.
[32:04] Don't fear the people of land. They're
[32:06] bread dust. their defenses departed from
[32:07] them. The Lord is with us. God is for
[32:10] us. Right? Notice that this is a this is
[32:13] speaking of faith. This is one that can
[32:15] look back and see what God had done in
[32:16] Egypt. Look what God had been doing
[32:18] through the wilderness. This is one that
[32:19] had confidence in the message of their
[32:20] hour. It's a good
[32:23] land. God will bring us to this place.
[32:26] Don't rebel against the Lord.
[32:29] The devil allowed a picture to be
[32:31] painted of the promised
[32:34] land that caused the people to rebel
[32:37] against God.
[32:40] That's what it is at its basic level is
[32:43] they no longer trusted
[32:44] God. That's why the word is the Lord is
[32:47] with us. Don't fear them. But the
[32:50] congregation's response instead of
[32:52] calling out to the Lord, crying prayer
[32:54] and Lord we believe, help thou our
[32:55] unbelief, they want to stone the
[32:57] messengers. They want to stone Joshua
[32:59] and Caleb. Why? Because they would
[33:01] rather have another
[33:03] pseudorist to lead them back to their
[33:05] vomit, to lead them back to Egypt.
[33:08] And the glory of the Lord appeared in
[33:10] the tabernacle of the congregation
[33:11] before all the children of
[33:15] Israel. In verses 36 to 38, this is more
[33:19] particular to
[33:20] God's response or to this what's
[33:23] happening. We'll back up to a couple
[33:25] other verses here in a moment. and the
[33:27] men which Moses sent to search the land
[33:29] who
[33:30] returned. And notice this, I know that
[33:32] I'm just giving you the summary here,
[33:34] but if you'll look into the Bible, if
[33:36] you're reading in your own scripture
[33:37] now, Numbers 14:es 36, 30, 37, and 38,
[33:42] these men made all the congregation to
[33:45] murmur against him by bringing up a
[33:48] slander upon the land. There's Satan's
[33:50] tactic. Lie, slander, spin, put it cast
[33:54] into a different light. And these men
[33:58] made the congregation to murmur against
[34:01] Moses by lying about the message, by
[34:06] lying about the promise, by changing it.
[34:10] Even those men that did bring up the
[34:11] evil report upon the land died by the
[34:15] plague before the Lord. But Joshua, the
[34:18] son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jeff,
[34:20] which were of the men that went to
[34:22] search the land, lived still.
[34:25] Unbelief caused them to die. Faith
[34:29] preserved them.
[34:31] The enemy still lived. The promised land
[34:34] still looked just like it was when they
[34:36] went into it, full of giants and great
[34:39] inhabitants. But those that doubted,
[34:41] their faith died. They laid low in the
[34:43] wilderness.
[34:44] From what we have read and what we
[34:46] already know, many who ate the mana,
[34:48] many who saw the quail, many who
[34:50] witnessed the supernatural, heard the
[34:51] promised land promises, witnessed the
[34:54] vindication, never fully possessed the
[34:57] promise or entered into what the
[35:00] messenger had promised
[35:04] them. All participated in this big
[35:08] supernatural move. But what God was
[35:10] doing and confirming and vindicating
[35:11] allowed them to enjoy never fulfilled
[35:13] its purpose by bringing them into their
[35:15] possession. Spies entered in the land,
[35:18] witnessed, tasted, saw, brought back the
[35:20] evidence. Yet through unbelief, they
[35:22] deny the promise and died in their
[35:25] unbelief. Verse 22 to 24 says, "Because
[35:29] all those men which have seen my glory
[35:31] in my miracles, which I did in Egypt, in
[35:33] the wilderness have tempted me now these
[35:35] 10 times and have not hearkened to my
[35:37] voice.
[35:40] Witness after witness, these 10
[35:42] witnesses
[35:43] lie. If they just would have said, "As
[35:46] for me, spy number one, I don't think I
[35:50] can make it." If they had only spoke for
[35:53] themselves,
[35:55] I don't I don't know that God would have
[35:58] been as grieved. I don't know if their
[35:59] transgression would have been complete
[36:01] because it was true of them. They didn't
[36:03] believe they could possess it
[36:04] themselves. But they lied about Caleb.
[36:09] That's the danger. That's the biggest
[36:10] danger of the makebeliever, the pseudo
[36:11] Christrist, the spy, or the cosmetic
[36:13] Christian is not what they think about
[36:15] themselves, but what they want you to
[36:17] start to think about you.
[36:22] Joshua and Caleb believe that they could
[36:23] do it. Now, it's being suggested not
[36:27] that the other 10 can't, but they can't
[36:30] either. They've tempted me. So, he says
[36:33] in verse 23, "Surely they shall not see
[36:35] the land which I swear unto their
[36:36] fathers. Neither shall any of them that
[36:38] provoke me say this is the
[36:41] provocation. But my servant Caleb,
[36:44] because he had another spirit with him,
[36:46] and followed me fully, him will I bring
[36:49] into the land wherein to where to he
[36:51] went, and his seed shall possess it.
[36:56] I really feel to say this, Brother
[36:58] Caleb. It's no coincidence you sit here
[37:00] right now on your birthday with the
[37:03] things that the devil's been trying to
[37:04] do to him to get him to doubt.
[37:07] But there's another spirit with him.
[37:10] Despite despite all the voices and all
[37:11] the lies, I believe that God given up
[37:13] has given him and us given us this
[37:15] promise that we will make it.
[37:18] We will possess it.
[37:23] He says these have seen the land.
[37:26] they've seen my glories and my
[37:30] miracles. I know that this is maybe
[37:33] opening up something that would be a
[37:34] little bit
[37:36] uh a very large room to explore. There's
[37:39] a lot of things in these scriptures and
[37:40] maybe this teaching that is worth
[37:42] pondering and and and hard sometimes to
[37:45] understand and the paradox of it. Let me
[37:47] just kind of give a surface view of
[37:48] Hebrews 6:es 4,5 and 6. For it is
[37:51] impossible for those who were once
[37:53] enlightened and have tasted of the
[37:55] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[37:58] the Holy Ghost. There's somewhat of a
[38:00] limiting language here that is
[38:02] intentionally used and have tasted the
[38:04] good word of God and the powers of the
[38:06] world to come if they shall fall away to
[38:10] renew them again unto repentance. We
[38:12] know that there is a partaker of divine
[38:16] promises. There are those that become
[38:18] recipients of God's glory and are sealed
[38:20] in the kingdom of God who to whom it is
[38:23] impossible for them to fall away. But we
[38:26] can gather from this that there is this
[38:28] image of those who if they were to fall
[38:32] away, it's impossible for them to be
[38:34] renewed again unto repentance because
[38:35] they would crucify to themselves the son
[38:37] of God aresh and put him into open
[38:39] shame. Brother Random uses these
[38:42] scriptures to highlight and I believe he
[38:44] uses the terminology borderline
[38:47] Christians.
[38:49] They taste the word. They receive the
[38:51] benefits of it, but they fall short of
[38:53] the promises. He writes in the church
[38:55] age book, "These having failed to obey
[38:57] God and being void of the spirit, though
[39:00] even the signs and wonders were amongst
[39:02] them, void of the spirit, but yet in
[39:05] this external way, an atmospheric way,
[39:09] there's things that re uh revolve around
[39:11] them or in their orbit, but they're void
[39:13] of the spirit." He says among this group
[39:15] will be the ones like
[39:17] Judas who though entirely void of the
[39:20] spirit are religious and will have
[39:22] manifestation in their
[39:27] lives. These things are
[39:29] tough. These are the cosmetic Christians
[39:35] who fail to obey God and never fully
[39:39] enter into full possession of his
[39:41] promise.
[39:43] never enter God's rest, never come into
[39:45] the promised
[39:47] land. There are those who
[39:50] will fall away
[39:54] eternally separated from
[39:56] God and then there's those that will
[39:58] fall short of a promise. They'll still
[40:00] could still be deemed uh they still
[40:02] could receive certain inheritance. I
[40:04] just feel to mention that let's be
[40:05] careful with our absolutes in terms of
[40:07] what the promise of the hour is and
[40:08] those that may perish or die before the
[40:13] change. The borderline
[40:16] Christian and what I'm wanting to say
[40:19] about the cosmetic Christian, this
[40:21] external superficial experience or
[40:26] existence in what we're reading and and
[40:28] we're going to we're going to push on
[40:30] and go
[40:31] further. My goodness, I haven't gone
[40:33] anywhere
[40:35] yet. I thought for a second something's
[40:37] wrong here, but man, we uh we may not
[40:44] finish these cosmetic Christians.
[40:47] They become a stop
[40:50] sign, a stopping
[40:53] point, not and I don't want to say a
[40:55] rest area, but they become a destination
[40:58] in themselves because they settle down
[41:01] and they kind of they put up the signs
[41:03] and the welcome mat and it's kind of
[41:05] gather here. This is where it's
[41:07] at. So they form a false boundary. Use
[41:12] the term false boundary that would be a
[41:13] barrier. So it becomes a barrier to
[41:16] those who desire to enter into the
[41:19] promise.
[41:20] Those who want to possess, those that
[41:23] wanted to go all the way into the
[41:25] promised land, they're going to be met
[41:27] with the makebeliever who says either go
[41:29] back or let's stop short.
[41:33] And they don't do it in the name of
[41:37] unbelief. And they they they'll do it
[41:39] maybe in what might seem to be some
[41:41] humility. Well, we're not strong enough,
[41:42] we're not good enough, or whatever it
[41:43] might be. They in themselves professing
[41:46] to have taken God at his word, choose to
[41:48] stop short of the promise. And as a lot
[41:51] of people begin to gather short of the
[41:52] promise, it can create enough momentum
[41:54] where you could be
[41:56] like, "What's going on over? Oh, oh,
[41:59] look, there a bunch of people in the
[42:01] Exodus. These are guys who left Egypt
[42:02] with us. Oh, yeah. This is this is where
[42:05] it's at."
[42:07] But it's short of the full word of God.
[42:13] Numbers 21:es 4 and
[42:16] 5. This is following this moment at
[42:21] Kadesh where they rejected God's word.
[42:24] Only Joshua and
[42:26] Caleb said that we're able to do it. And
[42:30] God swore that that generation would
[42:33] pass and they would die in the
[42:34] wilderness because they didn't take him
[42:35] at his word. They died because of
[42:37] unbelief. And so now they're still
[42:40] journeying. They journey from Mount
[42:41] by way of the Red Sea to compass
[42:43] the land of Edom. And the soul of the
[42:45] people was much discouraged because of
[42:47] the way the journey, the trials, the
[42:50] monotony. It caused this loss of focus.
[42:52] Even those that begin to raise up and
[42:54] get older. Supernatural is not no longer
[42:57] impacting their belief. And the people
[43:00] spake against God and against Moses.
[43:02] Wherefore have you brought us up out of
[43:04] Egypt to die in the wilderness? Notice
[43:06] how cyclical they are. For there is no
[43:08] bread, neither is there any water. And
[43:10] our soul loaith this light
[43:13] bread. Our soul loathst this mana. This
[43:17] bread from heaven. Light bread. Like
[43:20] they had they come up with caloriefree
[43:23] then. No. Light means
[43:26] worthless. Worthless from heaven.
[43:30] Notice how quickly your attitude when
[43:32] God sends his word, his bread, his mana,
[43:36] the bread of life, the living word of
[43:38] God, the living bread of life. How
[43:40] quickly people aren't interested in the
[43:42] word. They want the miracles of the
[43:44] word. They want the loaves and fishes,
[43:46] the garlics and the leaks, and they call
[43:48] it
[43:49] light,
[43:51] worthless. Lo that they they're sickened
[43:53] by it. They abhore it.
[43:56] Their love for the word had become
[43:58] disdain.
[43:59] They begin to loathe the word they
[44:01] tasted. They needed people to season it
[44:03] a little bit
[44:04] differently and they begin to crave the
[44:06] world they
[44:10] left. It's those that just
[44:14] tasted, experienced
[44:18] it. In Hebrews chapter 6 7 8 and 9, for
[44:21] the earth which drinkketh in the rain
[44:22] that cometh off upon it, and bringeth
[44:24] forth herbs, meat for them by whom it is
[44:26] dressed receiveth blessing from God.
[44:29] Notice this now. God sends his word.
[44:31] It's as rain that falls. It's as dew.
[44:33] God sends it as as bread. This is what
[44:35] God does. And the one that receives it
[44:38] and it produces what God desires, God
[44:40] blesses it. But that which beareth the
[44:42] wrong fruit responds the wrong way.
[44:44] Beareth bri thorns and briers is
[44:46] rejected and is nigh to cursing whose
[44:48] end is to be burned. But beloved, we are
[44:50] persuaded better things of you of things
[44:53] that accompany salvation. Though we thus
[44:56] speak,
[44:57] there are those that just taste the
[45:00] word. Then there are those that drink it
[45:03] in.
[45:05] There are those that taste as it's as as
[45:07] if it's some sort of supplement. Just
[45:09] kind of pepper the convention with a
[45:11] little bit of word. But let's get to the
[45:13] good stuff. Just season it. Just give it
[45:15] enough maybe a taste of the message of
[45:17] the hour, but we want all this other
[45:18] stuff lumped into it. They'll taste of
[45:21] the heavenly word. They'll partake of
[45:22] these things. They'll taste it. But then
[45:24] there's the believer that wants to drink
[45:27] it.
[45:29] The true believer doesn't just taste,
[45:31] they eat it up.
[45:34] John chapter 6 verse
[45:37] 58. They're the believer. They're the
[45:39] ones that fully process it. They're not
[45:42] just tasting. They're not just getting
[45:43] wet. They take it in and it produces
[45:45] what it's supposed to. It's processed.
[45:47] It's effective. John 6:58. That is this
[45:50] is that bread which came down from
[45:51] heaven. Not as your fathers did eat mana
[45:53] and are dead. They ate a light bread.
[45:55] They ate a supernatural mana, but he
[45:57] that eateth of this
[45:59] bread shall live forever.
[46:06] Taste and fall away. Eat and live
[46:09] forever.
[46:11] What's happening in John chapter
[46:12] 6? Taste miracles and die. Eat the word
[46:16] and live. Amen.
[46:21] Revelations
[46:24] 10:9.
[46:27] Now, you can't you can't eat the word
[46:31] and reject miracles.
[46:33] I'm not creating a dichotomy between
[46:35] miracles and the word. I I I'm
[46:37] identifying how the makebeliever gets
[46:39] hung up on the one side,
[46:42] the superficial external side, and
[46:44] misses the real deep work that God is
[46:46] doing by his word.
[46:48] Revelation chapter 10:9. I think this is
[46:50] really, really, really at the heart of
[46:52] what's driving me in this is that we're
[46:54] living in an hour when the full word has
[46:56] been unveiled.
[46:58] That God has opened up to us a seven
[47:00] course meal. That all things are
[47:02] fulfilled. That the seven seals are open
[47:04] to them that can receive it. And that
[47:06] we're living in a rapture time where
[47:08] God's focus and our everything he's
[47:10] doing is to bring us to that place of
[47:11] perfection and a rapturing grace. that
[47:13] when John is told to take the book, he
[47:15] goes unto him and says, "Give me the
[47:16] little book." And the angel says, "Take
[47:19] it and eat it up.
[47:23] Take it and eat it up." Taste. If you
[47:25] just taste it, you can fall away. But if
[47:27] you eat it, you live forever. Take it
[47:30] and eat it up. Brother Venom writes in
[47:32] chapter four of the church age book,
[47:34] "They are like the children of Israel
[47:36] who came up out of Egypt and stopped
[47:38] short of the promised land." I'm talking
[47:39] about that cosmetic Christian, that uh
[47:42] that make believer, the borderline
[47:44] Christian. Now, those children of Israel
[47:46] left Egypt about 2 million strong. They
[47:49] all journeyed together, all saw the same
[47:50] miracles of God, all parttook of the
[47:52] same mana and water from the smitten
[47:53] rock. All followed the same cloud by day
[47:55] and the pillar of fire by night, but
[47:57] only two reached the promised land. Only
[48:00] two were true or real believers. That is
[48:04] correct because the word tells us that
[48:05] the rest died because of unbelief. And
[48:07] because of unbelief they could not enter
[48:09] in. Then since that is so and only two
[48:12] entered then the rest were not true
[48:14] believers. What made the
[48:17] difference? Two stayed with the
[48:21] word. When the hearts of the 10 spies
[48:24] failed at Kadis Barnea, Joshua and Caleb
[48:26] did not stagger for they believed the
[48:28] word and said, "We are more than able to
[48:29] take the land." They knew they could
[48:32] could because God had said, "I have
[48:35] given you the land." After all those
[48:38] Israelites saw the power and goodness
[48:40] and deliverance of God, they did not
[48:42] enter into rest, which is a type of the
[48:44] Holy Ghost.
[48:46] They could not enter the promise of
[48:47] their hour. They could not go all the
[48:50] way through. What Satan will use to keep
[48:51] you from going all the way into the
[48:53] promises of God into fully taking God to
[48:55] his word, all he needs is unbelief.
[49:01] Their faith followed the word.
[49:07] Now, I want to use Numbers chapter 32 as
[49:11] my
[49:13] final section
[49:16] here because now
[49:19] after 40some years from the time that
[49:23] they rejected God's word and his
[49:27] promise, we're not back at Kadesh
[49:30] Barnea. We're now in Numbers 32. We're
[49:33] getting close to the Exodus.
[49:39] Sorry, the the entrance. We're getting
[49:42] close
[49:43] to crossing over and to possess the land
[49:46] and come in. They're now ready to come
[49:49] into this last stage to enter into the
[49:51] promised land. And it says in verse one,
[49:54] we'll read completely to verse 15
[49:56] ultimately. I think we can get there
[49:57] today. Now the children of Reuben and
[50:00] the children of Gad had a very great
[50:02] multitude of cattle. It's important for
[50:05] us to recognize that what they possessed
[50:07] in their earthly living was very
[50:10] important to them. And when they saw the
[50:12] land of Jazer and the land of Gilead,
[50:14] that behold, the place was a place for
[50:17] cattle, the children of Gad, and the
[50:19] children of Reuben came and spake unto
[50:21] Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and
[50:23] under the princes of the congregation,
[50:24] saying, Adaroth, and Dibbon, and Jazer,
[50:27] and Nimra, and Heshbon, and Eleah, and
[50:30] Shabban, and Nebo, and Bon, even the
[50:32] country which the Lord smoked before the
[50:34] congregation of Israel, is a land for
[50:36] cattle, and thy servants have cattle.
[50:42] Wherefore they said, if we found grace
[50:44] in thy sight, I don't if you're catching
[50:47] I don't know if you're picking this up,
[50:49] but now they just come right out and say
[50:50] it. Let this land be given unto thy
[50:52] servants for
[50:53] possession and don't lead us into the
[50:56] promised
[50:58] land and bring us not over
[51:03] Jordan. Reuben and Gad and ultimately a
[51:06] halftribe of
[51:07] Manasseh. But here, Reuben and Gad ask
[51:10] to settle, if I could say, on the wrong
[51:13] side of the
[51:14] promise. On the wrong side of the
[51:16] Jordan, on the east of the Jordan River,
[51:18] outside of the boundary, outside of the
[51:21] promised land.
[51:23] after 400 years from the promise, after
[51:26] 40 years of
[51:29] journeying brought them to the very
[51:32] point at which God's word is going to be
[51:35] fully fulfilled on the very border of
[51:37] the promised land. They say, "No, we
[51:39] don't want
[51:40] it." Why? Uh because you got a lot of
[51:43] cattle and this land is good for cattle.
[51:50] I read one time and I've just saved this
[51:53] statement. I think it it may have been a
[51:56] Jewish historian or even a rabbi that
[51:57] any Israelite tribe should consider
[51:59] settling outside the land promised to
[52:01] Abraham showed a disturbing indifference
[52:03] to the divine word. The word on which
[52:06] Israel existence entirely depended.
[52:11] Could you imagine being indifferent
[52:12] towards the message of the hour and we
[52:14] call ourselves message
[52:16] believers? Our entire existence is
[52:19] resting upon a word, a message. We call
[52:21] ourselves Christians and then we deny
[52:22] the Christ who is the word. The fact
[52:25] that any believer, any Israelite tribe
[52:28] would consider living outside of what
[52:30] God had promised them through his word
[52:32] showed a very disturbing indifference to
[52:35] the very word that gave rise to their
[52:37] existence. The very word that brought
[52:39] them to a place. So right before they
[52:40] enter, they're like, "Oh my goodness, we
[52:42] got a lot of cattle. This would be great
[52:43] for cattle.
[52:47] They came up to the borderline and
[52:49] decided to become borderline
[52:52] Christians. To be
[52:54] borderline, it's of questionable or
[52:57] minimal
[52:58] quality. It's the boundary between two
[53:02] states. And here I'm talking about a
[53:04] state of belief and a state of faith.
[53:09] I mean, they're right there, right?
[53:12] we if we found grace and God's brought
[53:14] us this far and they'll use if we
[53:16] continue to read here there's even a
[53:17] real convincing argument that they make
[53:19] and they seem to be really really
[53:21] sincere but something in their actions
[53:23] is very
[53:25] disturbing and it's that
[53:28] line between faith and
[53:31] unbelief they thought more of their land
[53:34] and their cattle and what they could do
[53:35] to sustain themselves and taking God and
[53:38] trusting him and the promised
[53:40] word. They're caught between fully
[53:43] believing and fully
[53:45] denying, kind of stuck in the middle.
[53:48] They're not asking to go back to Egypt,
[53:49] but they're certainly not asking to have
[53:50] their possession in the promised land.
[53:53] In James 1:8 says, "A double-minded man
[53:56] is unstable in all his ways." Why?
[53:59] There's divided
[54:01] loyalty. You can maintain a Christian
[54:04] facade, but inwardly prefer wilderness.
[54:08] uh wilderness worldliness,
[54:11] too. It's a cosmetic
[54:13] Christian. The unc the the double-minded
[54:16] man here who's unstable is the
[54:18] unconverted soul, but a convinced
[54:22] mind. Now, I know that we can become
[54:24] unstable when with a converted soul we
[54:27] have the doubting mind. And that's a
[54:28] that's a different battle and that's one
[54:30] you're overcoming. But here is an
[54:32] existence of one who maintains a
[54:34] message, confession or a Christian
[54:36] facade, but inwardly they do not prefer
[54:39] the full word of God. They're cosmetic
[54:42] Christians. Brother Brandham in the
[54:44] sermon proving his word said JRU was a
[54:46] priest, a borderline
[54:49] believer. May say Gyrus Jru borderline
[54:53] believer. He wanted to believe Jesus,
[54:55] but he hated to turn loose his church.
[54:59] There's your borderline
[55:01] believer. He wants to believe, but he's
[55:03] afraid to turn
[55:04] loose. Church, religion, certain things,
[55:07] certain possessions, certain
[55:09] opportunities. That double-minded, that
[55:12] intellectual, emotional faith of a
[55:14] convinced
[55:15] mind, but a soul that isn't satisfied
[55:18] with the word alone.
[55:28] Is this
[55:31] tight? My band-aid coming off? What's
[55:34] happening? So
[55:37] quiet. The borderline believer, the
[55:39] cosmetic, as I call it, cosmetic
[55:41] Christian.
[55:44] Superficial. Only worried about it's
[55:46] Isn't it in the image of Lot?
[55:49] Wow. Moses, these are well-watered
[55:51] plains.
[55:53] This would do really good for the cattle
[55:55] industry and we could export from here.
[55:58] We could supply all the beef you
[56:00] need and after all it'll give you more
[56:02] land to divide among everybody else.
[56:04] Very economical argument that they make.
[56:08] And Moses said to the children of Gad
[56:09] and the children of Reuben, Moses
[56:11] doesn't respond favorably to this. Shall
[56:14] your brethren go to war and shall you
[56:15] say that here? Because the inference was
[56:18] they're going to stop and they're not
[56:19] going to go and help them possess the
[56:20] land. And wherefore discourage ye the
[56:22] heart of the children of Israel from
[56:24] going over into the land which the Lord
[56:25] hath given them? Thus did your fathers
[56:29] when I sent them from Kadis Barnea to
[56:31] see the land. Now remember what we read
[56:32] about earlier went to great lengths to
[56:33] talk about the spies that went out. For
[56:35] when they went up unto the valley of
[56:37] Escoll and saw the land, they
[56:39] discouraged the heart of the children of
[56:41] Israel that they should not go into the
[56:42] land which the Lord had given them. And
[56:44] the Lord's anger was kindled the same
[56:45] time. And he swears, saying, "Surely
[56:47] none of the men that came up out of
[56:48] Egypt from 20 years old upward shall see
[56:50] the land which I swear unto Abraham,
[56:52] unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, because they
[56:54] have not wholly followed me."
[56:57] Total obedience, save Caleb, the Joshua,
[57:00] the son of Jeffa, the Ken Kenzite, and
[57:02] Joshua, the son of Nun. For they have
[57:04] wholly followed the Lord. How do they
[57:06] wholly follow the Lord? By taking him at
[57:07] his word. And the Lord's anger was
[57:09] kindled against Israel, and he made them
[57:11] wonder in the wilderness 40 years. until
[57:13] all the generation that had done evil in
[57:15] the sight of the Lord was consumed. 40
[57:17] years later, the same spirit rises up.
[57:21] And behold, ye are risen up in your
[57:25] father'sstead, an increase of sinful
[57:28] men.
[57:31] Woo! You are the resurrection of an evil
[57:35] spirit.
[57:37] You have now replaced those make
[57:39] believers of day go days gone by. You
[57:42] have now risen up in the same image of
[57:44] those that wanted to return back to
[57:46] Pentecost. You've risen up in the same
[57:48] image of those that wanted to stay in
[57:49] their organizations. You've risen up in
[57:51] the same spirit of those that refuse to
[57:54] go further than the word of God. Amen.
[57:56] You've risen up in your father'sstead an
[57:58] increase of sinful men to augment yet
[58:00] the fierce anger of the Lord towards
[58:02] Israel. For if you turn away from after
[58:04] him, he will yet again leave them in the
[58:06] wilderness and you shall destroy all
[58:08] this people.
[58:10] Moses very quickly identifies the danger
[58:12] of the makebeliever, the borderline
[58:14] Christian, the cosmetic Christian, the
[58:16] borderline
[58:17] believer. This indifferent or maybe
[58:19] casual attitude towards God's
[58:21] promise.
[58:23] Well, we see these other factors. If
[58:25] it's indifference, if it's outright
[58:27] rejection, complacency, whatever it was,
[58:30] Moses is concerned that this
[58:31] lukewarmness, this borderline believer
[58:34] would discourage the rest of Israel.
[58:37] Revelations 3:es 15 and 16. I know thy
[58:40] works that thou art neither cold nor
[58:42] hot. I would that thou w this is the day
[58:46] we're living in. Borderline
[58:49] lukewarm pale horse mixture. So then
[58:52] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[58:54] cold or hot nor hot, I will spew thee
[58:57] out of my mouth. Lukewarm is tepid,
[58:59] mildly mildly
[59:01] warm. We could say it's one that lacks
[59:04] conviction or one that lacks enthusiasm.
[59:06] It's some little zeal or just uh uh
[59:09] indifferent. But to be lukewarm is the
[59:12] condition of that soul, that mind, that
[59:14] the individual that is fluctuating
[59:17] between apathy and fervent
[59:20] love. I think that's I think it's more
[59:22] important for us to realize what this
[59:23] word is tending to is not so much this
[59:27] state where one is
[59:30] just we've all known people before like
[59:32] they all look the same whether it's the
[59:34] greatest day of their life or the worst
[59:35] day of their life. They all look the
[59:36] same. Just kind of even kill. How you
[59:38] doing? Best day ever. Right. Next day,
[59:41] how you doing? Worst day ever. They just
[59:44] That's just the way they can be. But
[59:45] here, the lukewarm is vacasillating. Oh,
[59:52] yeah. Right. And average it out. What
[59:54] are they? Lukewarm.
[59:59] It's in the
[1:00:00] image of the one that birthed the
[1:00:02] hybrid, the one that was the first
[1:00:04] prototype, the the
[1:00:06] alpha
[1:00:08] of that may be taken as a compliment in
[1:00:11] certain circles, the
[1:00:12] beta of the hybrids,
[1:00:16] Cain. He worships.
[1:00:19] Next moment he's
[1:00:21] mad. The next moment he's
[1:00:24] uh
[1:00:26] hearing the
[1:00:29] word. The next moment he's
[1:00:34] murdering. Couldn't humble himself to
[1:00:36] the word of God. But he could worship.
[1:00:39] Hebrewsap 11:4. By faith Abel Abel
[1:00:41] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:00:43] sacrifice than Cain, by which he
[1:00:45] obtained witness that he was righteous.
[1:00:46] By what? Faith? By revelation.
[1:00:51] Not by miracles, vindication, signs and
[1:00:53] wonders. That's God's part. That's what
[1:00:55] God does.
[1:00:58] What Abel did is he offered by
[1:00:59] revelation a more excellent sacrifice
[1:01:02] than Cain. So we could read it that Cain
[1:01:04] offered an excellent worship, an
[1:01:06] excellent sacrifice. But revelation is
[1:01:08] what it took to be more excellent. God
[1:01:11] testifying of his gifts, and by it he
[1:01:13] being dead yet speaketh. Cain built an
[1:01:16] altar.
[1:01:18] that that example of that hybrid
[1:01:20] believer built an altar and worship but
[1:01:22] could leave the meeting and murder his
[1:01:24] brother.
[1:01:26] Think about
[1:01:28] it. Can worship, can speak in tongue,
[1:01:30] could dance and shout, can work all
[1:01:32] kinds of signs and wonders and whether
[1:01:34] but brother talk about a temper that
[1:01:35] could like a buzzsaw a tongue that could
[1:01:38] murder,
[1:01:39] slander, hatchet jobs on other people.
[1:01:45] The examples as we used last time, and I
[1:01:47] know I'm trying to pack a lot here to
[1:01:49] finish this, but Cain, Judas, the
[1:01:51] makebeliever, they demonstrate just how
[1:01:54] closely the gates of hell come to the
[1:01:56] believer.
[1:01:58] Just how closely the gates of hell
[1:02:02] come. Where was this this gate of hell
[1:02:06] in the Exodus? Right there at the
[1:02:08] borderline. Right there at the Jordan
[1:02:09] River. And Moses is quick to say, "This
[1:02:12] is a this is a test. If you guys do
[1:02:15] this, you could discourage and it'll die
[1:02:17] again another generation dying in the
[1:02:19] wilderness." But by faith, which is
[1:02:22] what? A revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:24] That's the difference between the
[1:02:26] believer and the unbeliever.
[1:02:29] Abel by faith, brother Ram says, "By
[1:02:32] revelation, Abel offered unto God a more
[1:02:33] excellent sacrifice because it was
[1:02:35] revealed to him that it wasn't fruits of
[1:02:37] the field, it was blood." Then he makes
[1:02:39] this statement. Think of this. That's
[1:02:41] why some people can believe it and some
[1:02:44] can't believe it. And some try to make
[1:02:48] believe it.
[1:02:52] That's why some believe it, some are not
[1:02:56] able to believe it, and some try to make
[1:02:58] believe it.
[1:03:06] In Acts chap 20
[1:03:10] 27-32, you're a
[1:03:13] believer. All that you can do is
[1:03:16] believe.
[1:03:18] And believe that God will do what he
[1:03:20] promised he would do. If seeing signs
[1:03:24] and wonders and miracles and gifts
[1:03:25] operating and manifesting in your life
[1:03:27] for your church is important, then
[1:03:28] believe that God can do it. But let
[1:03:31] faith be at the heart of it. So that
[1:03:33] whenever God does it, you you loop back
[1:03:36] into believing God's word, not into
[1:03:39] worshiping and making an idol out of the
[1:03:41] signs, wonders, and miracles.
[1:03:43] There's a cosmetic Christianity that we
[1:03:46] can begin to engage and there's a
[1:03:47] culture that we can create that is
[1:03:49] external. And as we we can live in that
[1:03:52] kind of atmosphere and it can create
[1:03:54] this feedback loop where we constantly
[1:03:56] feel like we're being reinforced. It's
[1:03:58] just an echo chamber that just keeps
[1:04:00] telling us we're good, we're good, we're
[1:04:01] good. But what we need is the word of
[1:04:03] God that reminds us of what the full
[1:04:05] promise is and to take all the momentum
[1:04:07] that God creates through moving in
[1:04:10] meetings. We have family right now
[1:04:11] that's at a at a youth meeting. I'm
[1:04:13] trusting that God is moving in a very
[1:04:14] supernatural powerful way, confirming
[1:04:17] his presence amongst them with signs and
[1:04:19] wonders and miracles. And may there be
[1:04:20] gifts and shouting and dancing, but also
[1:04:23] may there be not just deliverance from
[1:04:25] evil, but the birth of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:27] inside of the soul of those young people
[1:04:31] that they can have faith that they can
[1:04:33] always resolve back to faith. It's a
[1:04:36] shame when we hear grown up adults in
[1:04:39] nearly 40 years old and I can't wait
[1:04:41] till I get back to youth camp
[1:04:45] so I can get back on track with my
[1:04:47] experience
[1:04:52] in Acts 20
[1:04:54] 27-32. Hope that this can
[1:04:57] be a a a conclusion for us. For I have
[1:05:01] not shunned to declare unto you all the
[1:05:03] counsel of God. This is Paul. The same
[1:05:05] gospel brother Brandham preached. Take
[1:05:08] heed therefore unto yourselves and to
[1:05:09] all the flock over the which the Holy
[1:05:11] Ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[1:05:13] the church of God which he had purchased
[1:05:14] with his own blood. So much beauty in
[1:05:18] that. For I know this that after my
[1:05:20] departing shall grievous
[1:05:22] wolves. My dad used to always say
[1:05:25] previous wolves.
[1:05:28] So they're
[1:05:30] back. After my departing, shall grievous
[1:05:33] wolves enter in among you, not sparing
[1:05:36] the flock. Among
[1:05:39] you, wolves in sheep's clothing, or
[1:05:41] maybe better put, wolves in shepherd's
[1:05:44] clothing, brother, what big nose you
[1:05:47] have.
[1:05:53] and they are among you
[1:05:55] and they don't they don't spare the
[1:05:58] flock. They abuse it for their own means
[1:05:59] and their own benefit. For I know this
[1:06:02] that thou my departing. Shall grievous
[1:06:04] wolves enter in among you, not sparing
[1:06:05] the flock. Also of your own selves,
[1:06:07] please draw from what we taught on this
[1:06:08] last week. Shall men arise from
[1:06:10] yourselves, from your own belief, from
[1:06:12] your own uh circle of fellowship, your
[1:06:14] own self? Shall men arise speaking
[1:06:16] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:06:19] after them, captains to lead them back
[1:06:22] to Egypt, to bondage, to Leodysia,
[1:06:25] to settle down on the wrong side of the
[1:06:28] message, to take up shop on the wrong
[1:06:31] side of Jordan.
[1:06:33] Therefore, watch and remember that by
[1:06:34] the space of three years, I have not
[1:06:36] ceased to warn everyone night and day
[1:06:38] with tears. This has been a burden to
[1:06:40] me. I've warned you. I've told you. I've
[1:06:41] told you. And now, brethren, I commend
[1:06:43] you to God and to the word of his
[1:06:45] grace, which is able to build you up.
[1:06:48] What is the word of his grace and to
[1:06:51] give you an inheritance among all them
[1:06:55] which are sanctified.
[1:06:57] Notice that at the very
[1:07:00] end, I I I want to say this in maybe
[1:07:03] just a dramatic way. The tribe of Reuben
[1:07:08] and
[1:07:09] Gad began to search the
[1:07:13] message to find an
[1:07:16] excuse to stay on the wrong side of
[1:07:19] Jordan
[1:07:21] because they asked Moses to give it to
[1:07:23] him. They asked Moses to give it to him.
[1:07:25] As if Moses had that right.
[1:07:29] Moses wasn't a king. He wasn't He wasn't
[1:07:32] the owner of that. So, they were looking
[1:07:35] for the blessing of the
[1:07:37] messenger to in order to continue to
[1:07:40] function short of the
[1:07:42] promise. Come on. I want you to really
[1:07:44] think about this. They wanted to use the
[1:07:46] word of Moses as a reason to say they
[1:07:50] were okay to not follow the word only to
[1:07:52] not go all the way into the promise.
[1:07:58] But it's God that Paul says it's God and
[1:08:02] his word of grace that's able to build
[1:08:05] you up to positionally place you. And
[1:08:07] he's the one that gives you the
[1:08:08] inheritance among them which are
[1:08:10] sanctified. They wanted to settle
[1:08:12] outside the promise. I'll go into this,
[1:08:14] Lord willing, in greater detail in a
[1:08:15] future service. They wanted to settle
[1:08:17] outside of the
[1:08:24] promise, but God had given them the
[1:08:27] promised land.
[1:08:30] And even because of their example,
[1:08:32] there's a raging debate theologically as
[1:08:34] to whether or not the land that they
[1:08:35] ultimately possessed is actually part of
[1:08:37] the promised land.
[1:08:40] Notice how it causes people to
[1:08:44] stumble. Brothers, if you could come to
[1:08:46] your instruments
[1:08:47] now, brother Benham says in the church
[1:08:49] age book, this is the chapter 3 of the
[1:08:51] Ephesians age. He says, "One of these
[1:08:52] days there's going to come a prophet to
[1:08:54] the Elio to see in church age, and you
[1:08:56] will know if he's the real one sent from
[1:08:58] God or
[1:08:59] not." Yes, you will. For if he is of
[1:09:03] God, he will be in that word. I love it.
[1:09:08] He's not saying you'll find his name.
[1:09:10] He's saying he will be in it.
[1:09:13] What about you?
[1:09:15] Right? Are you here for it? Are you in
[1:09:18] it?
[1:09:20] He will be in that word exactly as God
[1:09:23] gave it to
[1:09:24] Paul. He won't deviate from that word
[1:09:26] for a moment. Not by one iota.
[1:09:29] There's our example. Be in the word
[1:09:33] in that last age. this contrast. Now,
[1:09:37] when there will be many false prophets
[1:09:40] appearing, watch and see how they keep
[1:09:43] telling you that if you don't believe
[1:09:45] them in what they say, you will be
[1:09:48] lost. Right? It's not like
[1:09:52] this. creating
[1:09:55] that cultish
[1:09:58] mentality, drawing away
[1:10:01] disciples, demanding that you as the
[1:10:03] bride of Christ kneel and kiss the
[1:10:07] ring. They say, "You're lost. You're
[1:10:09] outside of the promise. Your church is
[1:10:13] dead." But when that last day prophet
[1:10:15] comes on the scene, if he trul is truly
[1:10:17] that prophet, he will be crying, "Get
[1:10:19] back to the word or you are lost." Amen.
[1:10:23] He won't build on a private interpret
[1:10:25] revelation or interpretation, but on the
[1:10:29] word.
[1:10:30] That's what you're built on. That's what
[1:10:32] faith is built on.
[1:10:34] That's what Satan wants you to do. We
[1:10:36] have this wonderful, beautiful promised
[1:10:37] land of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:39] in this last day. We have the word of
[1:10:42] God. Therein is your foundation and all
[1:10:45] the materials you need to be
[1:10:46] positionally
[1:10:48] placed. And the devil just uses somebody
[1:10:51] who falls short of the promise. And here
[1:10:53] they are on the other side of the seals,
[1:10:55] on the other side of the word of God, on
[1:10:57] the other side of the revealing of the
[1:10:58] son of man, trying to drag you back to
[1:11:00] Pentecostalism, trying to drag you back
[1:11:03] to the world, drag you back to bondage,
[1:11:04] drag you back to men's ideas and
[1:11:06] interpretations, drag you back. And
[1:11:07] they're kind of like saying, "No, this
[1:11:09] is this is this is part of the message.
[1:11:11] This is where it's at. This is the
[1:11:13] bride's revival right here where they
[1:11:16] see how green it is. See all the cattle?
[1:11:18] See how much God is blessing us. See See
[1:11:21] how wonderful this
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:25] is. We got to go all the way into the
[1:11:27] word. Say, take God at his word. Amen. I
[1:11:30] I I I wouldn't be so concerned with the
[1:11:33] pretense of being superficially
[1:11:36] supernatural. I wouldn't be too
[1:11:38] concerned about on the outside and the
[1:11:40] exterior being a cosmetic Christian. I
[1:11:43] think I heard a little chuckle or a
[1:11:45] giggle when I put my title slide up
[1:11:47] there because I used uh the the symbol
[1:11:50] the logo of a very popular brother. Go
[1:11:52] ahead and put it up there real quick. A
[1:11:54] a a global brand of
[1:11:56] cosmetics and I even used as a
[1:12:00] background a a makeup
[1:12:04] uh sisters. I know you don't know what
[1:12:06] it is. I how would I expect to know what
[1:12:08] it is? Just forgetting the name of blush
[1:12:11] or compact or something. That's that's a
[1:12:14] that's the
[1:12:16] makeup and they want to put on the
[1:12:19] cosplay of a
[1:12:20] Christian. I guess that could have been
[1:12:22] another CC, a cosplay Christian.
[1:12:28] I am
[1:12:30] not I am not
[1:12:34] desirous to
[1:12:37] impress the world or other message
[1:12:41] believers with
[1:12:44] how excited I could
[1:12:47] be about the
[1:12:49] message or how technically correct I can
[1:12:52] be about the teaching of the message. I
[1:12:55] want to please God in my embracing the
[1:12:59] message, in my appetite for his word,
[1:13:02] knowing that the life that will flow
[1:13:04] from that will impress somebody else
[1:13:07] who's thirsty.
[1:13:09] That in doing so, I will be that right
[1:13:12] image of a 21st century Christ.
[1:13:15] That Jesus didn't try to appear as a
[1:13:18] Messiah that they were expecting. A
[1:13:21] cosmetic messiah in that day would have
[1:13:23] looked very, very different. A pseudo
[1:13:25] Christrist in that day would have been
[1:13:26] very very different. But he was that
[1:13:28] Messiah. And I know there's a lot of
[1:13:30] pseudo Christ trying to make a lot of
[1:13:32] cosmetic Christians. But we have got to
[1:13:34] bear down on the word of God. Hold fast
[1:13:37] to the word of God and believe that God
[1:13:39] is able to do supernatural things in our
[1:13:41] midst. But I wanted to be by the word
[1:13:44] and the word of promise because that
[1:13:46] word of grace is what is what is able to
[1:13:47] build me up to a change. Amen.
[1:13:51] We saw the example that God in brother
[1:13:53] Brandon's ministry brought us back to
[1:13:55] the word. Signs and wonders following.
[1:13:57] Absolutely. God wanting us to take him
[1:13:59] at his word. But if we can't take him at
[1:14:01] his word, he sends back the
[1:14:03] evidence shows us signs and wonders and
[1:14:08] miracles. But oh, let's not make the
[1:14:12] mistake. I've been studying for the
[1:14:14] meetings in uh
[1:14:16] Missouri and what's in my heart to to
[1:14:18] minister on is just right in this. I
[1:14:20] don't know if channels are getting
[1:14:21] crossed
[1:14:23] but 40 years later now we can look at it
[1:14:25] 60ome years later. Let's not make the
[1:14:29] mistake. Let's not make the mistake on
[1:14:32] the border of a
[1:14:34] change on the border of changing
[1:14:38] dimensions. Settle for Leodysia.
[1:14:41] [Music]
[1:14:43] The very moment when God is expecting
[1:14:46] the bride to receive that full
[1:14:49] revelation of the rapture, we start
[1:14:51] thinking, "Well, I don't know. I'm not
[1:14:53] so sure. And could it have gone this
[1:14:54] long and maybe this hasn't worked and
[1:14:56] we've tried the word and we've tried
[1:14:58] this and we've tried that. Maybe we need
[1:15:00] to figure something else out. Maybe it's
[1:15:02] going to take this and it's going to
[1:15:03] take that. Maybe we've been wrong about
[1:15:04] what Brother Brandham said the bride's
[1:15:06] revival was. Maybe we can search in the
[1:15:08] message and find some tacit approval
[1:15:11] from the message to tell us we're
[1:15:14] okay to stop
[1:15:17] short. God, help us. Let's stand
[1:15:20] together. Let's
[1:15:22] pray. I thank you for your patience and
[1:15:24] my length
[1:15:26] today. I don't normally preach over an
[1:15:29] hour, but when I do, it's a holiday.
[1:15:32] It's a
[1:15:34] blessing. Let's pray.
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:40] Lord Jesus, we're so
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:46] thankful. Thankful for your word. Thank
[1:15:48] you for a messenger that stayed true to
[1:15:52] it. Lord, there's times when in when I'm
[1:15:54] ministering, I recognize just being open
[1:15:56] and bare partly before the people. But
[1:15:59] with you, Lord, you do with my heart to
[1:16:02] use scripture to bring things out of the
[1:16:04] Bible. It's a lot of repetition maybe in
[1:16:07] the themes that I use from the
[1:16:10] scripture, but Lord, it's this message
[1:16:12] of the hour and the many, many quotes
[1:16:15] that we could read on makeelievers and
[1:16:16] borderline believers and the token
[1:16:19] and so many things that we could share.
[1:16:21] Those things have inspired us. It's
[1:16:23] what's informed this thought on
[1:16:26] impersonations.
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:30] And Lord, your prophet said in broken
[1:16:32] sistns that there's uprisings and things
[1:16:34] that
[1:16:35] come and it's a duty of a pastor to
[1:16:39] block that thing so far from the
[1:16:40] people's
[1:16:42] minds. And Lord, I know as I see in the
[1:16:45] trail of the
[1:16:46] serpent throughout history in the Bible
[1:16:49] and in the church ages and then through
[1:16:50] the message of the hour, Brother
[1:16:51] Brandham so clearly identified that
[1:16:53] trail of the serpent. I know at this
[1:16:55] moment he's trying to get the bride to
[1:16:58] stop short to question to doubt to
[1:17:02] change to accept a
[1:17:04] [Music]
[1:17:06] pseudo and Lord it can get really
[1:17:11] really difficult to take you at your
[1:17:14] word is a specialist song it's not hard
[1:17:17] to believe when things are going
[1:17:20] well not hard to believe when you live
[1:17:22] in well-watered plains and a lot of
[1:17:24] grass with a lot of cattle, a lot of
[1:17:27] milk, a lot of
[1:17:31] beef, a lot of things to put your finger
[1:17:33] on and say, "Yep, we'll make
[1:17:35] it." But when you're trusting to the
[1:17:38] invisible fingerprints of
[1:17:41] God, and somehow by faith, you
[1:17:44] believe that he'll take care of you if
[1:17:46] you take him at his word.
[1:17:50] that you don't have the contingency or
[1:17:51] the backup plan of the land of Gilead,
[1:17:54] but you'll step into that icy Jordan and
[1:17:55] you'll cross over and you'll do battle
[1:17:59] at Jericho and
[1:18:02] AI. You'll do battle against all the
[1:18:05] inhabitants of the land because you will
[1:18:08] go before us and drive them out.
[1:18:11] We believe you, Lord. We trust you and
[1:18:12] we'll take you at your
[1:18:14] word. And Lord, in what such moment I am
[1:18:17] afraid, I'll trust in
[1:18:19] you. When I begin to reach back and I
[1:18:22] want to make a captain, to go back to a
[1:18:23] comfort zone or go back to some belief
[1:18:25] or lifestyle, go back to the world or go
[1:18:27] back to religion, I want to take you at
[1:18:30] your word and say, "Lord, I have to
[1:18:31] believe you no matter what my mistakes
[1:18:32] are, whatever my failures are, my
[1:18:34] repeated mistakes." Lord, I will not
[1:18:37] make excuse for sin. I will not make
[1:18:39] excuse for relapse. I will not make
[1:18:40] excuse for wondering thoughts. I will
[1:18:42] not make excuse for doubt and jealousy
[1:18:44] and lies and hypocrisy and gossip and
[1:18:46] lust. I will not make excuses for any of
[1:18:48] it. Amen. And I will not blame your
[1:18:51] word. I will not blame the truth. I will
[1:18:53] not blame the Bible. I will not blame uh
[1:18:56] your lack of promises. Lord, I will take
[1:18:59] you at your word. And I will believe now
[1:19:00] that I am free. I will believe now that
[1:19:02] I'm healed. I'll believe now that I am
[1:19:03] delivered.
[1:19:05] Lord, I make mistakes. I fall. I don't
[1:19:07] do the things that I know I should do.
[1:19:10] Lord, I do the things I hate to do. But
[1:19:12] Lord, your word is true and I love you.
[1:19:14] And I believe your word is enough to
[1:19:16] deliver me, to heal me, to make me
[1:19:18] whole. And I recognize there's a nasty,
[1:19:20] filthy enemy using all sorts of dirty
[1:19:23] tactics and tricks to plague my mind.
[1:19:26] And I say, Lord, I believe you right
[1:19:28] now. I believe you. I take you at your
[1:19:30] word. I'm free. I'm delivered. I'm
[1:19:32] healed. I'm well. I'll not go back to
[1:19:35] that again. If they drag me, if I fall,
[1:19:39] I'll get up again and say, "No, I'm
[1:19:40] free. I'm going back to my father. I'm
[1:19:42] going back across the Jordan. I'm going
[1:19:45] back to meet my enemy with the word of
[1:19:47] God." And Lord, may we never stop
[1:19:50] fighting. May we fight for every inch of
[1:19:52] ground. Lord, I believe in you. And I
[1:19:55] believe that our young men can live free
[1:19:56] from lust. I believe that our young
[1:19:58] ladies can live free from lust. Lord, I
[1:20:00] believe that we can live free from the
[1:20:02] temptations and passions of this world.
[1:20:05] I can live free from discouragement. I
[1:20:07] can live free from pride. I can live
[1:20:08] free from condemnation and doubt and
[1:20:13] comparison. I'm going to come back to
[1:20:15] you in your word, Lord Jesus.
[1:20:18] Lord, I got to preach it plain. We got
[1:20:20] to call it out for what it is.
[1:20:22] The gates of hell have camped right
[1:20:25] here. The final step into
[1:20:28] perfection. We draw our swords with you.
[1:20:30] We are with you.
[1:20:33] We stand with the Lord of hosts who is
[1:20:36] amongst us. Amen. And we'll do battle
[1:20:39] for loved ones. We'll do battle against
[1:20:40] sin and sickness. We'll lay hands on the
[1:20:43] sick as it's required. We will cast out
[1:20:45] devils in your
[1:20:47] name. Lord, we'll shout. We'll praise.
[1:20:49] We'll worship as you lead us to. But we
[1:20:52] will stand silently on the rock of
[1:20:55] ages. Stand firm upon your promise and
[1:20:58] upon the word. and we will not be
[1:21:00] intimidated into settling on the wrong
[1:21:02] side of this message.
[1:21:04] Bless us Lord I pray as we go forward in
[1:21:07] your word. Heal us today Lord. Place us
[1:21:10] Father in your promises. In the name of
[1:21:12] Lord Jesus Christ we pray.
[1:21:15] Amen. Thank you Jesus. God is so good to
[1:21:18] us.
