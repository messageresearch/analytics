[0:00] Yeah, we'll just read this one. Says
[0:02] this, "Hold fast the form of sound."
[0:05] We're in 2 Timothy, sorry, uh 1 and
[0:08] 13:14 says, "Hold fast the form of sound
[0:11] words which thou hast heard of me in
[0:14] faith and love which is in Christ Jesus,
[0:17] that good thing which was committed unto
[0:20] thee, keep by the Holy Ghost which
[0:23] dwelleth in us." And if we would just
[0:25] bow our heads for a word of prayer.
[0:28] Heavenly Father, we're a privileged
[0:30] people to gather in your name, Lord. And
[0:32] though we've been a bit hurried today,
[0:34] Father, we just want to settle in now to
[0:36] take your word under, Lord, our our our
[0:40] minds and under our hearts, Lord, that
[0:42] it would just come out, Father, in a way
[0:44] that would change us to make us better.
[0:46] Lord, we appreciate the music this
[0:48] evening and the saints that have
[0:50] gathered come faithfully, Lord. And we
[0:52] just pray that you'd bless them and
[0:53] reward them for their efforts, Lord.
[0:55] Bless the speaker and the hearers. And
[0:57] father, as always, we commit all things
[0:59] to you, understanding that you have
[1:01] everything in your power. It's under
[1:03] your will, and all things work together
[1:05] for the good of those that love the
[1:06] Lord. And Father, we certainly count
[1:08] ourselves a part of that group, Lord,
[1:11] those that love the Lord and are just
[1:13] appreciative of your grace and mercy in
[1:15] our lives. And so, we just ask now for
[1:16] your blessings upon this service. God
[1:18] bless you. You can be seated.
[1:27] So, um, first off, welcome everyone. And
[1:32] this is kind of a a family night
[1:34] apparently for me, uh, because I've got
[1:37] some of the Johnson family and some of
[1:39] the Johnson family. Um, and we've got,
[1:42] uh, Inbball, who Azelai, who is all the
[1:45] way from Israel. So, uh, my niece, uh,
[1:49] visiting Arizona, headed to Ohio this
[1:51] evening with me. So, she gets to be my
[1:53] travel partner. I get to carry her bags.
[1:56] So, somebody has to do that. You know,
[1:58] sometimes that's kind of how it goes.
[2:01] Um, so this evening, uh, as we're just
[2:06] committing the service into the Lord's
[2:07] hands now, I wanted to, um, just kind of
[2:12] look at Timothy here. And he's making a
[2:15] a fairly or Paul is making a fairly
[2:17] sound statement to Timothy um in this
[2:20] second chapter, the the 13th verse. And
[2:22] he says, "Hold fast the form of sound
[2:24] words which thou has heard of me in
[2:26] faith and love which is in Christ
[2:28] Jesus." So he's Paul is always
[2:30] encouraging Timothy. He's talking about
[2:32] him about his family and hey your
[2:34] family, you know, they're really serving
[2:35] the Lord. Your your grandmother and your
[2:37] mom, they were awesome. uh they did
[2:39] great things and he realizes that you
[2:41] know but there's still struggles for
[2:43] anybody right and so we know Timothy's a
[2:45] minister he's going to have things that
[2:46] he's going to face there's a lot of
[2:48] different factions or different groups
[2:50] that are kind of dealing with something
[2:52] and so he's he's telling them listen
[2:54] I've given you a form I've given you
[2:57] something here sound words I've given
[3:00] and those things I want to make sure
[3:01] that you hang on to that you hold those
[3:04] things and make sure that you actually
[3:07] have a mind towards them and in faith
[3:09] and love bring those things out. So it's
[3:14] not out of anger, it's not out of some
[3:16] other emotion, it's in faith and in
[3:17] love. So those two things he's wanting
[3:19] to bring it out. So we want to take
[3:21] actually from that um uh 13th verse
[3:25] there uh for a title this evening. We
[3:27] just want to talk about the form.
[3:30] And so when I'm thinking about this just
[3:33] on the form of things and we understand
[3:36] that there's a lot of forms to different
[3:38] things that we do. So whether it's in
[3:40] life you have forms that you get to fill
[3:42] out like government forms. Everybody
[3:43] loves those. Uh in work you get to do
[3:45] things oftentimes not in just like a
[3:47] single format but you get to do it you
[3:49] know sometimes two or three times the
[3:51] same thing over and over. Um we got a
[3:53] lot of forms to do but in the world
[3:56] around us there's all kinds of different
[3:58] forms. So each of us is formed, right?
[4:01] Each of us has a certain look, a certain
[4:03] way that we do things. We've been formed
[4:05] from the womb to be a certain thing. You
[4:08] have certain gifts that are established
[4:09] in your lives. All kinds of things are
[4:11] actually in that particular place in
[4:13] those forms. And with regard to that, uh
[4:18] the um actually I should just just as
[4:22] we're going to get going here. So just
[4:24] for those that are visiting this
[4:25] evening, um normally what I do is on a
[4:28] Wednesday night I kind of try and make
[4:30] things really towards the kids or at
[4:32] least part of it towards the kids so
[4:34] they can kind of grasp um some deeper
[4:36] concepts but by simple things uh because
[4:39] I feel it's really important. I know
[4:41] that when I was a young man, one of the
[4:43] ministers that really played a a big
[4:45] role in my life um and he preached a
[4:48] very interesting things, but he always
[4:50] could bring it to a level that I
[4:51] understood and I was fairly young and to
[4:54] catch on. Now, some of the people I
[4:55] would be sitting there and by the time I
[4:57] walked out of service, I didn't know
[4:58] what happened, but for the most part
[5:01] when this brother would preach, it was
[5:02] something really, really good for me.
[5:04] So, normally we talk about vintage
[5:06] youth. Um and that's kind of um where
[5:09] that we are. So, if you want to go to
[5:11] the next slide. And so, for those of you
[5:13] that don't know what vintage youth is,
[5:15] it's pretty much if you look in a mirror
[5:18] and recognize yourself as not young and
[5:22] if somebody looks at you and they see
[5:24] you the same way, you probably fall into
[5:26] the vintage youth category because youth
[5:29] are actually going to have some
[5:31] youngness to them. And it's easily
[5:33] identifiable not only in the mirror but
[5:35] by those around them. So uh vintage
[5:37] youth was actually a term that brother
[5:39] Bryant had coined uh in one of the
[5:42] services I was with him and in another
[5:44] brother had told him about that. So uh
[5:47] the little humorous thing is here is
[5:49] normally I would say vintage youth eat
[5:50] free but the reality is is like my dad
[5:53] used to tell me when I was a kid there
[5:54] is technically no free lunch. So uh
[5:57] you're going to have to go along with me
[5:59] tonight. And just so that you're aware,
[6:01] in order to kind of get this sermon
[6:02] together, in order to get it under three
[6:04] hours, I had to cut a lot out. So, um,
[6:08] so we're going to kind of just delve in
[6:10] and get as far as we can. So, anyways,
[6:12] there's always a price to pay, right?
[6:14] So, we think sometimes that things are
[6:16] free, but there's always a price with
[6:18] things that that come along. Um, and
[6:21] even in church, there's a price. You've
[6:23] got to sit through a service, you got to
[6:25] wait for the late preacher, you know,
[6:27] sometimes the air conditioning isn't
[6:28] great. there's always a price, right?
[6:31] That there's always something going on.
[6:32] So there's something in the background
[6:34] in that. And um so we understand that we
[6:37] we we don't get anything for free. Um
[6:40] except for salvation, which was a free
[6:43] gift. But in the realms of humanity, if
[6:46] anybody tells you it's free, you either
[6:48] had to watch an ad, you had to give them
[6:52] some information. Like everybody loves
[6:54] to get you to sign up on an app because
[6:55] they want you to, you know, give them
[6:57] information. data is king right now and
[6:59] they sell it like crazy and if you
[7:01] didn't know they know a lot about a lot
[7:03] more about us than actually we would
[7:05] care to admit or actually care to know.
[7:08] So anyways um next slide if you would
[7:11] and so brother Brandham is in the legacy
[7:13] and church age church age book he says
[7:16] this in the dark ages the word was
[7:17] almost entirely lost to the people but
[7:19] God sent Luther with the word the
[7:20] Lutheran spoke for God at that time but
[7:22] they organized and again the pure word
[7:24] was lost for organization tends toward
[7:26] dogma and creeds and not simple word.
[7:29] They could no longer speak for God. Then
[7:31] God sent Wesley and he was the voice of
[7:32] the word in his day. And the people who
[7:34] took his revelation from God became the
[7:36] living epistles read and known of all
[7:38] men for their generation. When the
[7:39] Methodists failed, God raised up others.
[7:41] And so it has gone on through the years
[7:43] until in this last day there is again
[7:45] another people in the land who under
[7:46] their messenger will be the final voice
[7:48] to the final age. So I think for most of
[7:52] us the the particular statement that
[7:54] brother Bannon makes is fairly simple.
[7:56] But actually there's a number of people
[7:57] that don't like the church age book. Uh
[8:00] I know a number of people that their
[8:02] lives were completely changed by it. Uh
[8:04] but there are others that say, "Well, it
[8:06] wasn't really inspired because brother
[8:07] Brandham didn't preach it. He didn't
[8:09] actually write it himself. It was
[8:10] written by someone else." So in
[8:12] Revelations 22:17, it says, "And the
[8:14] spirit and the bride say, "Come, and let
[8:16] him heareth say, "Come, and let him that
[8:18] is a thirst come. And whoever whosoever
[8:20] will, let him take the water of life
[8:22] freely." So pretty much Revelations
[8:24] 22:17 is saying what the church age book
[8:27] said. Now, we know we're in the last
[8:28] church age, right? Leodysian age. Not
[8:31] only do message churches know this, but
[8:33] pretty much every church kind of has an
[8:35] idea. Maybe the Catholics don't quite
[8:37] understand it, but pretty much all the
[8:38] Protestant churches have a good idea.
[8:40] This is the end of time. And not only
[8:41] that, people that are pretty much not
[8:43] even going to church. No, there's
[8:45] something up. Like, we're there's
[8:48] something happening here. Like, there's
[8:49] a you know, I don't know what it is, but
[8:51] it's not good. And they're getting
[8:53] nervous. and and obviously we've gotten
[8:55] to a point where things have uh taken on
[8:58] a new form. But when I was thinking
[9:00] about this um particular thing with
[9:02] voices and we know that voices also uh
[9:04] represent waters or in the scripture it
[9:06] talks about water. And so I was thinking
[9:08] about that and if we have a final voice
[9:12] and we are like the voice of water many
[9:14] waters um which is what the Bible says
[9:17] then there's something in there. There's
[9:19] something that we need to think about.
[9:21] But just before we dive into this um you
[9:24] know that I like to talk about space I'm
[9:26] not talking about space so much tonight.
[9:28] However, I did want to bring up
[9:30] something called the Big Bang theory.
[9:33] People know what I'm talking about.
[9:35] Okay. So, the only reason I'm bringing
[9:38] this up is because we know that the the
[9:41] you know the things were without form
[9:43] and void, right? And then darkness was
[9:45] on the pace face of the deep. That
[9:46] that's scripture that we can read. I'm
[9:48] not going to go through Genesis. We
[9:49] don't have time. But we understand from
[9:51] Genesis that there was an order to
[9:53] things and things began to take form. So
[9:56] God spoke something, something happened
[9:58] and then we have what they call the big
[10:01] bang theory. Now in looking it into the
[10:04] big bang theory, the interesting thing
[10:05] is that I'm finding is that they can't
[10:07] go back all the way. So what they say is
[10:10] that there was infinite matter and
[10:12] infinite energy and from that infinite
[10:15] matter and infinite energy boom
[10:17] something happened. And it started out,
[10:19] they used to say a pin head, now some
[10:20] say it's size of a football. But the
[10:23] interesting thing is is from that
[10:24] football once everything started to
[10:26] expand out, bunch of gas and a lot of
[10:28] stuff going on in the universe, it
[10:30] things started to take form. And
[10:33] initially, like what that form was,
[10:35] maybe you didn't see. And even as it
[10:37] began to come into realization, what you
[10:41] were actually seeing or what you could
[10:43] see if you were on Earth at the time, of
[10:45] course, nobody was here. um you know for
[10:48] quite a long time. But uh and by the
[10:51] way, just so that we know, brother
[10:52] Brandham did teach us that that the the
[10:56] world began in the beginning. God
[10:58] created the heavens and the earth.
[10:59] Period. We don't have to worry about
[11:01] 6,000 years and get tied up in that. We
[11:03] know that it was however long it was.
[11:05] God's an infinite God. But the
[11:07] interesting thing I I found was that
[11:09] they're trying to right now connect the
[11:10] football back to the beginning of time.
[11:12] And they as they try and look back what
[11:15] they're having problems is with is that
[11:17] time they say is well one one guy put it
[11:21] it's wibbidity wibbidity wobbly. I think
[11:24] that's how he put it. But basically what
[11:26] happens is when you go back from there
[11:27] they don't time doesn't have any
[11:29] relevance.
[11:31] So there's no relevance there. And also
[11:33] what they're finding is that they're
[11:35] trying to combine well trying to prove
[11:37] Einstein's theory of relativity along
[11:39] with some laws of physics and also the
[11:41] theory of relativity and the laws of
[11:43] physics don't apply there. They apply
[11:45] once they get past a certain point but
[11:48] back there it doesn't apply. So it's
[11:50] kind of interesting. You've got an
[11:52] infinite energy and infinite matter.
[11:54] Kind of sounds like God. You got a place
[11:56] that there isn't time. I don't know.
[11:59] Kind of sounds like eternity to me. And
[12:01] and you also have something you know
[12:04] back in the beginning where there isn't
[12:07] uh that well there isn't anything uh
[12:09] quite frankly but you have infinite
[12:12] everything beginning this whole thing
[12:14] coming out and it steps out into a place
[12:17] where all of a sudden you can start to
[12:18] to register a theory of relativity. You
[12:21] can start to register time. You can
[12:23] start to do all those things. So I just
[12:25] just for the kids this evening I wanted
[12:27] to do something. So, and this this
[12:28] number is going to be for you adults
[12:30] because I've never even heard these
[12:31] numbers before. But somebody went back
[12:34] and said they they went back into
[12:36] Genesis and they've looked at these
[12:38] things and tried to figure out like,
[12:40] well, what are the chances that the
[12:41] Bible could possibly be right? And so,
[12:45] one of the the things that they came up
[12:46] with is a particular number. And so, get
[12:50] ready for this one. I'm glad you're
[12:51] sitting down.
[12:53] There is a one out of 403 septilian, 291
[12:58] sectillion, 461 quintilion,
[13:01] 126 quadrillion, 605 trillion, 7 billion
[13:05] chance that what Moses wrote in Genesis
[13:09] was
[13:11] the right thing like that he could write
[13:14] how the universe began and all the
[13:17] different things in in step by step in
[13:20] the order that it took place and then
[13:21] science went back and looked at all
[13:23] these things and sure enough, oddly
[13:24] enough, science sometimes in its effort
[13:27] to disprove the word proves it, but they
[13:31] think they've actually disproved it.
[13:34] Because to me, it's kind of like
[13:36] seriously, that's where your brain was.
[13:38] Like, you thought that it I don't even
[13:41] know what a septilian looks like aside
[13:43] from on the piece of paper here. But
[13:46] it's just a shocking number to me when
[13:48] you when you see that that you would
[13:50] have such a great number. So I thought
[13:52] well let's put it into a little bit
[13:53] simpler terms. So most of us are
[13:54] familiar with the dollar bill right now.
[13:57] They have 605 trillion. So one out of 65
[14:00] trillion but the US debt is what 37
[14:02] trillion now. But again those are
[14:05] numbers that we can't you know maybe
[14:07] Elon Musk can fathom them. I can't. Uh
[14:10] so even a billion is difficult to
[14:12] fathom. But let's say I had a dollar
[14:14] bill and I marked it with a special
[14:17] marking and I took that dollar bill and
[14:19] I went to the Glendale stadium and I
[14:21] mixed it with a billion other dollar
[14:22] bills and then I blindfolded you. Now I
[14:25] might let you see like there's some
[14:27] green out there, but you're not going to
[14:29] know what the number is that I've
[14:30] chosen. None of those things. I'm going
[14:32] to blindfold you and put you in that
[14:34] building. It's actually probably going
[14:36] to overflow the building, but you're
[14:38] going to be in there and then I want you
[14:39] to go in and find that dollar bill and
[14:40] come out and you get one chance to do
[14:42] it. That's it. Because that's what Moses
[14:45] had when he wrote the word that that was
[14:48] he he was completely blindfolded. He
[14:50] couldn't see it. He could see now the
[14:51] evidence of it. So I could show you the
[14:53] billion dollars from a distance, right?
[14:55] He's standing on Earth looking at the
[14:57] things around. But anyways, so science
[15:00] has a way sometimes of doing things that
[15:03] were that actually is anti-science,
[15:06] oddly enough, and more proof of the
[15:08] Lord.
[15:11] So again, that's not our sermon, but I
[15:14] wanted to throw it in there because it's
[15:15] important to understand that the things
[15:17] that we see sometimes, the things that
[15:19] we, you know, acknowledge, the things
[15:21] that we know even as young people, um,
[15:23] those things, you know, may have a
[15:25] different explanation than what we think
[15:27] in our mind that it is. And that's kind
[15:29] of what science tends to prove, it seems
[15:32] like, to me, often enough.
[15:35] So, what I'm actually going to talk
[15:37] about is the form of water tonight. uh
[15:40] and also the form of us in a way but I I
[15:42] want to go with the form of water. Now,
[15:44] most of us are used to uh things like uh
[15:48] what water does, right? So, if I were to
[15:52] tell you in your house that you had a
[15:53] solid, a liquid, and a gas, commonly,
[15:56] how many would know that that's water?
[15:59] In in every home, pretty much in America
[16:02] at, you know, depending on if you're
[16:03] cooking or not, uh you're going to have
[16:06] ice in the freezer, you know, water
[16:08] coming out of a tap or possibly in the
[16:10] fridge or bottled water somewhere. In
[16:12] Arizona, it's bottled water everywhere.
[16:14] Uh, and and you're also going to have
[16:15] that steam coming off of, you know,
[16:17] whatever your, you know, whoever's the
[16:19] cook. I don't know who the cook in the
[16:20] house is, but whoever that cook is,
[16:22] that's going to be there. But how many
[16:25] of us even pay any attention to it
[16:27] because it's common, right? You ice
[16:30] cubes, they're awesome, but you really
[16:33] think about, man, I I really wish I had
[16:36] ice cube because pretty much you just
[16:37] walk to the fridge and you push a button
[16:38] and ice pops out. or you go in and, you
[16:41] know, some of us still do the bag and
[16:43] you pull it out of the bag, whatever.
[16:44] However you're getting your ice, somehow
[16:46] you're getting it. And water, um, oddly
[16:49] enough, is something that pretty much
[16:51] even in the desert, people take for
[16:52] granted. Um, Josh still being a a
[16:55] firefighter on a truck, he gets to go
[16:57] and, uh, rescue people in the desert
[16:59] because, oddly enough, they decide to
[17:01] hike during the heat of the day and take
[17:03] either no food or maybe a few bites and
[17:06] not enough water to make the hike. and
[17:09] and they're shocked like that they need
[17:12] rescued. Some of them don't even make it
[17:14] out rescued. Some of them actually
[17:15] perish just because they took for
[17:17] granted the fact that they needed more
[17:18] water than they thought they did. And
[17:20] then all life depends on it. Right? Life
[17:23] as we know it on Earth. We have to have
[17:25] water. No matter what you do, you've got
[17:27] to have it. No matter where you go, it
[17:28] has to be something that you have. So in
[17:32] Arizona, if you've lived here, so I'm
[17:33] just going to ask how many have been to
[17:35] the Grand Canyon?
[17:37] Okay, that keep your hands up. Keep your
[17:39] hands up. Okay, that's awesome because
[17:41] you know what happens for most folks
[17:42] that live in a particular place. So this
[17:44] is the effect science says of water. So
[17:46] we're used to that, right? Erosion water
[17:48] happens, right? Very common. We're used
[17:51] to seeing it all over the place. But
[17:53] funny thing is is that a lot of times if
[17:55] you're in Arizona and you're really
[17:57] close to the Grand Canyon, if you really
[17:58] want to see it, you got to move
[17:59] somewhere else because then you're going
[18:01] to come back and see it because pretty
[18:02] much everybody that comes from out of
[18:03] state goes there. And a lot of times the
[18:05] in-state people just don't seem to make
[18:07] it to the Grand Canyon for some reason.
[18:10] So, uh, here's one that'll be to Josh's
[18:12] liking.
[18:15] Uh, when if you go to the next slide,
[18:18] brother.
[18:21] And I'm going to give a shout out to
[18:22] Shutter Stock or Shutter Stack. I don't
[18:25] know what that is, A or an O. Looks like
[18:27] an O. Shutter stock because uh, oddly
[18:30] enough, there's not a lot of stuff now
[18:31] that you can take off the internet
[18:32] without getting in trouble. So there
[18:35] they are. They got their uh 10-centent
[18:38] plug, I guess. But one of the other
[18:41] things that's really common for us to
[18:42] think about with water is fire, right?
[18:44] That's what we do all the time is uh you
[18:49] know, Josh especially is going to be out
[18:50] there fighting fires, whether it's
[18:51] wildland fire, building fires, whatever.
[18:53] So we're used to water going onto
[18:56] things like that. So I'm sure that most
[18:59] of you can think of all kinds of uses of
[19:01] water in your mind. like there's a lot
[19:03] of things that um you know that it's
[19:06] used for. It's used in industry. It's
[19:08] used in our homes. It's used all over
[19:10] the world. We get to go out on a boat
[19:12] and enjoy it. You get to go sailing or
[19:14] fishing or whatever it is that you do
[19:16] around water. Um some people like it
[19:18] frozen so they can skate on it. Probably
[19:21] skating on thin ice tonight. So, I like
[19:22] it frozen. I wish it was a little bit
[19:24] more frozen, but we're going to just
[19:27] keep going where we're going. So, we
[19:28] understand it's necessary for life. It's
[19:30] all those things. But if you could just
[19:32] go to the next slide, brother.
[19:35] So, anybody familiar with this? Ruben,
[19:37] don't raise your hand.
[19:39] Reuben's always familiar with auto
[19:41] stuff. So,
[19:43] okay. So, this is actually a water car.
[19:48] This is a prototype for a
[19:51] hydrogen-powered car.
[19:54] Actually drives, runs. And the reason
[19:57] that I'm putting it out there is because
[19:58] we don't think of this as a form that
[20:00] water is going to have anything to do
[20:01] with aside from maybe cooling the
[20:03] engine. But in this case, it's actually
[20:06] something that is a part of the power of
[20:08] the engine. Because one of the things
[20:10] that that science has told us, I I
[20:12] wouldn't have known this myself if they
[20:14] hadn't shown me in science class or no
[20:16] chemistry class, I guess, is what they
[20:17] called it. uh and we did a little
[20:20] experiment where they took uh two
[20:22] electrodes and put some water and some
[20:25] salt with it and I really wanted to show
[20:28] this but again copyrights I couldn't
[20:30] copy anything um but anyways they take
[20:34] that and they by using a charge
[20:38] so-called electrolysis they they
[20:40] actually can take that water and break
[20:42] it down from its three well three
[20:45] molecules which are two hydrogen and
[20:47] oxygen and And it becomes two gases
[20:50] becomes oxygen and hydrogen. Now a lot
[20:53] of us I think are familiar with hydrogen
[20:55] without maybe knowing it so much simply
[20:57] because every day in Arizona guess what
[20:59] we get to see the sun. Except for about
[21:01] 30 days out of the year when we might
[21:03] have clouds. Other than that we see it
[21:05] every day. And according to science
[21:07] that's what is is fueling or fueling
[21:10] that plant uh the that sun is hydrogen.
[21:14] So what they've taken to is is actually
[21:18] coming up with a way to take hydrogen um
[21:21] and oxygen and fuel a car and make it
[21:24] run. So, this car is actually uh it's a
[21:27] prototype like I said, but it's actually
[21:30] being used now and one of these days
[21:32] it's going to be coming to a market near
[21:34] you. So, uh, on this next slide,
[21:39] I threw this in because,
[21:41] uh, I wanted to give a shout out to the
[21:43] folks that have electric cars because we
[21:45] know that they're doing everything
[21:46] greener for the planet. But electric
[21:48] car, this is, uh, they called this for
[21:50] the vintage youth here. Uh, the younger
[21:52] ones aren't going to even know what I'm
[21:54] talking about, but this was like the
[21:55] Nater mobile. Uh, if you remember Ralph
[21:59] Nater, and he was a guy that was really
[22:01] for the planet back in even before my
[22:03] day really. So this is from the 1960s.
[22:06] Um and he wanted to show that electric
[22:10] cars were a thing. Well, they didn't
[22:12] really have the technology then, but
[22:14] they have the technology now where Tesla
[22:16] um has made it really uh you know a
[22:20] viable thing along with other car
[22:21] manufacturers.
[22:23] But just going back to the the other um
[22:26] vehicle, there's another picture if you
[22:28] want to bring it up, brother.
[22:30] So, I know it looks really cool on the
[22:32] back there, but when the vehicle runs,
[22:34] they put some really cool blue lights
[22:35] back there. Uh, and unfortunately, like
[22:38] I said, there would be a video of this,
[22:39] but I can't show it to you. Uh, but when
[22:42] you see this actually running, what
[22:44] you're going to see is coming out of it
[22:45] is is vapor and and sometimes it
[22:49] actually just spits out water.
[22:51] So the interesting thing about um water
[22:55] is that water is actually something
[22:58] that's in a form that well water has a
[23:00] lot of characteristics. Let's put it
[23:01] that way. Uh some 72 or something like
[23:04] that I believe that they say. We're only
[23:06] going to deal with with one or two
[23:07] tonight. So one of the amazing things
[23:11] about water is that if you freeze it or
[23:13] if you heat it, either way it expands.
[23:16] There's not many things that do that. In
[23:18] fact, I think water's about it. I didn't
[23:20] really research that. But if you make
[23:23] something colder, it gets bigger. And if
[23:25] you make it hotter, it gets bigger. So
[23:27] that's kind of a weird thing, right?
[23:29] Because usually if we get colder or
[23:31] hotter that, you know, like your fingers
[23:33] will shrink up or swell depending on
[23:35] what the temperature is, those kind of
[23:36] things. So it's kind of a an interesting
[23:39] thing that has uh you know, meaning to
[23:41] us or meaning for us.
[23:44] But when this car runs, so it's taking
[23:46] hydrogen, taking oxygen, and mixing the
[23:49] two together and putting out water
[23:50] vapor. And so the lesson that I want to
[23:53] bring to you here is that with regard to
[23:57] this um
[24:00] is that when you have so sorry, let me
[24:04] back up just a little bit.
[24:07] We know that the word is water, right?
[24:10] It's it's referred to as water in in
[24:13] other ways. Um but it's referred to as
[24:15] water specifically in many areas. And so
[24:18] it's water of the word, right? And you
[24:20] have, you know, the water of life and
[24:23] you're going to have springs of living
[24:24] water and all those other things. So
[24:28] we're used to those kind of things and
[24:30] we understand that in the word it's that
[24:32] way. But one of the things that
[24:34] sometimes that we don't realize is that
[24:37] um well, let's put it this way. We know
[24:38] that in the in the scripture it talks
[24:40] about putting out the fiery darts of the
[24:42] wicked one, right? So if you have fire,
[24:45] what are you going to do? Spray water on
[24:46] it. If you um you know, if you have the
[24:50] fiery trials, what are you going to do?
[24:52] You're going to spray water on it,
[24:54] right? But what happens is what happens
[24:56] when you come up against something where
[24:58] actually you need a power that's not
[25:00] going to wet something down, but it's
[25:03] going to take it out of, you know, the
[25:06] take it out of the equation altogether.
[25:08] like you need something to burn this
[25:09] thing out. So, and that's kind of the
[25:12] way sin is, right? Because we we
[25:14] understand from the message that brother
[25:15] Brandham told us that um with regard to
[25:19] uh you know our lives and that when
[25:21] you're a sinner that comes to God, you
[25:23] have some sin that's got to get out of
[25:25] your life and you need a power that's
[25:27] going to take it out. Now, what happens
[25:29] is the water of the word is applied but
[25:33] there's a power that actually splits
[25:35] that word. So, in other words, what we
[25:37] were talking about just from that first
[25:39] reading, it actually takes that power
[25:41] and changes that power into something
[25:43] that can burn with a fervent heat.
[25:45] Brother, if you could pull up the video
[25:47] for me, that would be awesome.
[25:55] So, I cheated on this video. Um, and I
[25:58] apologize for the poor quality.
[26:11] Is there any volume to it?
[26:16] I wouldn't turn up too loud, but
[26:21] So, it seemed like a nice balloon,
[26:22] right? It's awesome balloon. I'm sorry
[26:25] if the the the
[26:28] it won't play. Okay. So what happened
[26:31] here was um and if you go back to it and
[26:34] just go to the end of it where kind of
[26:35] the people are holding their ears th
[26:38] this is a school function uh happened
[26:41] about 20 years ago I believe if I
[26:43] understand the um the stuff that's
[26:46] embedded in the video but um
[26:51] what they've done is they put hydrogen
[26:52] and oxygen in a fairly big balloon and
[26:55] then they have a a cable up to it with
[26:58] an electrical charge.
[27:00] And when it goes off, if you'll watch
[27:02] the people here,
[27:06] just watch their ears.
[27:08] Uh sometimes we don't realize what kind
[27:10] of power is actually within the thing
[27:13] that we're messing with. And so what
[27:16] they have is they're thinking, "Hey,
[27:17] this is awesome. I've got something that
[27:19] I can, you know, have a real good time
[27:21] with." and they about blow their ears
[27:23] out um because they don't realize that
[27:26] that hydrogen oxygen is a lot more
[27:28] powerful than what it appears to be. And
[27:32] that's kind of the the place that I'm
[27:34] thinking about this is in this last day
[27:37] a lot of times people don't realize what
[27:39] kind of power that the word has. So,
[27:42] it's it's not just a power to put out
[27:46] fiery darts or to, you know, to water
[27:51] things down or to make things live. It's
[27:53] a power that that actually can be
[27:56] destructive.
[27:57] And the so the let's go back just a
[28:00] little bit. In in science, there's a
[28:02] couple ways that that hydrogen and
[28:04] oxygen are split. So, now you could take
[28:06] a knife and try and split water all day
[28:08] long. All it's going to do is kind of
[28:10] push to either side. And we know in the
[28:12] scripture water was split all the time,
[28:13] right? So Red Sea, Moses comes up to it,
[28:16] water splits. Well, it all it did was
[28:18] separate from one side to the other. It
[28:20] didn't actually split like Adam's, but
[28:23] it did split. So crossing over Jordan,
[28:25] water splits. So we're kind of used to
[28:27] that. But in the word when uh Paul is
[28:31] talking to Timothy now, you're going to
[28:33] actually be rightly dividing that word
[28:35] of truth. So there has to be a power
[28:39] that does that. So in nature plants have
[28:42] something called photosynthesis. I'm
[28:44] sorry this is not a science uh class but
[28:46] it does uh mean something I wanted to
[28:49] tell you about it. So photosynthesis is
[28:51] where um the plants use the power of the
[28:54] sun and something called chlorophyll.
[28:56] And they do this every day. We're used
[28:57] to seeing it. And what they do is they
[28:59] actually split water molecules into
[29:01] oxygen and hydrogen. And we all benefit
[29:04] from this because in the daytime when
[29:06] the sun is shining, they release oxygen
[29:09] from the plants. So it's a really good
[29:11] thing because we kind of breed that
[29:13] stuff, right? So it's kind of necessary.
[29:15] We kind of want it. Um and plants do
[29:18] that for us. But the also the
[29:20] interesting thing about plants is during
[29:21] the day when the sun is shining, they
[29:23] have power to separate those molecules.
[29:27] So they need the hydrogen to grow and
[29:30] they release the oxygen into the
[29:31] atmosphere. But at night they produce
[29:34] the same thing that we do when we
[29:35] breathe out. Because at night they don't
[29:37] have the power of the sun. And without
[29:40] the power of the sun they need they need
[29:42] that energy. They have to have it. And
[29:44] without the power of the sun they can't
[29:46] produce that for for us so to speak. But
[29:50] the thing is is that plants have done
[29:52] this for a long long time every day
[29:56] safely
[29:58] because God has built into them the
[30:00] ability to do it safely. So then comes
[30:02] along man and we found out that we have
[30:06] the power to separate water molecules
[30:09] into hydrogen and oxygen which guess
[30:12] what happens when we do that something
[30:15] like the video that we just watched
[30:17] because there's a power there now it's
[30:19] in a different form right but it's still
[30:21] the same thing because that car that we
[30:23] showed you um that prototype car when
[30:27] oxygen and hydrogen are burnt together
[30:29] and it's just them what they're going to
[30:31] produce and the only thing that they can
[30:33] produce is water that they'll do it
[30:37] every time. So the lesson from that that
[30:40] we learn is that with the word when it's
[30:42] rightly divided and then when that holy
[30:46] spirit comes upon the word so we add
[30:49] fire to a rightly divided word it has to
[30:52] produce the word after it again no
[30:54] matter what if that word is just the
[30:59] split that was rightly done it will
[31:02] always produce water every time. Nature
[31:05] teaches us that. So the form that it is
[31:08] when that form is it's taken and a
[31:10] greater power splits it which is what
[31:12] the Holy Ghost requires. So remember
[31:13] what does the scripture say? It's the
[31:15] Holy Ghost and fire right? Holy Ghost
[31:18] and fire because you have that spirit
[31:21] but you need the fire of that spirit to
[31:23] make the word more powerful. Now water's
[31:26] powerful. I mean look at the Grand
[31:27] Canyon. Pretty amazing place. You got
[31:30] Hoover Dam. I don't know if you ever
[31:31] been there but that's also a pretty
[31:33] amazing place. the power that it
[31:34] generates. Pretty awesome. Pretty cool.
[31:37] Water does a lot of things. It, you
[31:39] know, oddly enough, when you're up in
[31:41] the north country, water kind of ruins
[31:43] roads because it'll get into the cracks
[31:45] and it freezes and thaws and freezes and
[31:47] thaws and eventually it breaks that
[31:49] stuff down. My dad was a person that
[31:51] worked for the Department of Agriculture
[31:53] and he dealt with soil conservation. So,
[31:56] water was a big deal to him. And it, you
[31:59] know, water's everywhere. In fact, uh if
[32:02] you have one of the things that he
[32:04] always told me and someday I hope to
[32:05] preach a sermon on it was that if you
[32:08] have um weeds, weeds are actually nature
[32:12] nature's answer to erosion because you
[32:15] have to have something to hold the soil.
[32:18] So water does a lot of amazing things
[32:21] and in the form that we see every day it
[32:23] can do a lot of powerful things but
[32:26] sometimes you come up against something
[32:29] where you need a greater power than just
[32:31] that water you need it to be split by
[32:34] something and to change into a different
[32:36] form and in that form it can overcome
[32:39] some great things. So, when Christ was
[32:43] uh uh in his moment of temptation with
[32:46] Satan, when he was there, you know, I
[32:49] don't know if you ever thought about it,
[32:50] but I I've been thinking about it. And
[32:53] when the scripture talks about, you
[32:54] know, Satan took him up unto a pinnacle
[32:56] of a temple, like this is the Lord Jesus
[32:59] Christ, and now you have his his enemy
[33:03] taking him and carrying up high. So what
[33:06] kind of power is that that could
[33:08] actually carry the son of God to a place
[33:12] and then you also have him not only
[33:14] taking him somewhere but then showing
[33:16] him all the kingdoms of the world in a
[33:19] moment of time. What kind of power is
[33:21] that? I mean this is this is really
[33:24] powerful stuff. Now Christ could rightly
[33:27] divide the word and he had all the power
[33:29] behind him anyways.
[33:31] So when Satan comes and he comes with
[33:33] the word, right? Absolutely. Said, "Hey,
[33:36] look at you can, you know, I can throw
[33:39] you down from here because your angels,
[33:41] they'll catch you." And what did the
[33:45] Lord do? He responded back with a
[33:46] rightly divided word. So the problem
[33:49] with Satan's word was that it was not
[33:51] rightly divided. It was definitely
[33:53] absolutely the word. It was true. if the
[33:57] you know the angels were uh given to to
[34:00] watch charge the kingdoms were given to
[34:02] Satan he had the you know he had those
[34:04] kingdoms in his hand the Lord had to
[34:07] wait obviously right because that's not
[34:08] how he could bring those kingdoms in but
[34:10] he had to wait for something else to
[34:12] occur so kind of the crux I want to get
[34:15] to for some of us older folks here and
[34:17] the reason I started off with that that
[34:19] church ages book quote is because in
[34:23] well let me put it this way I was
[34:25] talking with someone recently in thing
[34:27] that I found really amazing about the
[34:29] message is, and I don't know how many of
[34:31] you have been through this in kids. I I
[34:33] Lord willing, in your whole lives, you
[34:34] never will, but church splits,
[34:37] uh you don't have to raise your hands,
[34:39] but uh if you've been through a church
[34:42] split, and I've watched several happen
[34:45] and been through several myself,
[34:48] uh it's a painful thing. Amen. Uh it's
[34:52] it's not something that should be. But
[34:54] you know what's really funny about it is
[34:55] you don't really find Catholics
[34:57] suffering from a church split.
[35:01] They just really don't. In fact, you can
[35:03] go to most denominations and you really
[35:05] don't until they got now they did get to
[35:07] some controversial things now with the
[35:09] whole alphabet thing that's happening.
[35:11] And so there are have been churches that
[35:13] have been doing that. But over the
[35:14] course of time, guess where the problem
[35:16] typically lies?
[35:19] in message churches that we're we're I
[35:22] I'm I'm imagining by the sheer number of
[35:25] people versus you know the volume of
[35:27] people in the other churches I bet
[35:30] percentage-wise most of us have
[35:31] experienced something like that
[35:35] I don't know percentage wise pretty high
[35:39] and the thing is is that we have a pure
[35:41] word
[35:44] and and we have a Holy Ghost that allows
[35:46] us to divide that word to rightly divide
[35:49] it. And not only does it do that, but it
[35:51] empowers the word to overcome your sin.
[35:54] It overcomes, you know, problems in your
[35:56] life. It overcomes trials and tests. It
[35:59] can heal you. It can, you know, it can
[36:02] change your life. It can set you on a
[36:03] different course. It can do all these
[36:05] different things. But yet,
[36:06] unfortunately, what's happening is that
[36:09] somebody gets a hold of it and they come
[36:12] out with an idea. And brother Aaron
[36:15] mentioned a brother and I even if I
[36:16] could remember his name I wouldn't quote
[36:18] it anyways but the brother has started
[36:21] to have people call him Elohim.
[36:24] Now a lot of people say the five-fold
[36:25] ministry you know ruined a lot of stuff
[36:27] and that's true but here's the flip side
[36:31] of that. Somebody had to follow him
[36:34] because if I'm a guy that I decide hey
[36:36] everybody in church today you need to
[36:38] call me Elohim. If nobody does that, if
[36:42] nobody follows, guess how much power I
[36:44] have over anybody?
[36:46] Zero. I don't have any power. So, we we
[36:51] point a finger all the time at the
[36:52] five-fold ministry, but s sometimes we
[36:54] got to point it back at ourselves. Like
[36:57] you can say, "Oh, that brother, he, you
[36:59] know, he shouldn't have never done that.
[37:00] He should have never said something like
[37:01] that. He shouldn't have been that kind
[37:02] of person to bring that out."
[37:07] And it's true. That's absolutely true.
[37:10] But if somebody follows him,
[37:14] where are we standing then?
[37:17] Because it's up to us individually
[37:20] to rightly divide the word of truth.
[37:22] That's where we live is it's us
[37:25] individually. So we understand that
[37:26] there's a five-fold ministry, there's a
[37:28] pulpit ministry, but individually your
[37:31] salvation is worked out.
[37:34] I if I got up here and said something
[37:36] that was absolutely 100% completely
[37:38] wrong, please be gracious enough to tell
[37:41] me that you know I said something wrong.
[37:44] But you still have to go through the
[37:46] word and say is this correct or not?
[37:49] Because if you take anyone's word for
[37:52] something blindly and bearing in mind
[37:54] the power that they have to bring out
[37:58] that word and the power that's behind
[37:59] that word and what can happen to it um
[38:05] all those things play into we still have
[38:08] to look at you know is it true. So one
[38:11] of the things that threw me I I had a a
[38:13] brother that had said something that I
[38:16] thought was just kind of odd. it was
[38:18] that we shouldn't question the message.
[38:20] And I'm like, well,
[38:22] how do you prove that the message is
[38:24] true unless you go back to the word and
[38:26] see? So, I've never worried about taking
[38:29] a message and going, does this follow
[38:32] scripture?
[38:33] I don't understand why you would worry
[38:35] about it. Now, people talk about visions
[38:38] and this vision didn't happen or that
[38:39] vision didn't happen. That has nothing
[38:41] to do with what does the word say and
[38:45] what was the message that was brought to
[38:47] us. Do they dovetail?
[38:50] And I don't know about you, but I've
[38:53] never had a problem saying, you know,
[38:56] let's let me look at this. How can I
[38:57] find this in the Bible? And really, it
[38:59] actually guides me to the place in the
[39:01] Bible to look for it. That's the amazing
[39:03] part. is like, well, this is awesome
[39:05] because not only, you know, can I check
[39:07] it out, but it's taking me right where I
[39:09] need to go. So, it's it's not something
[39:12] that's going to be confusing, but even
[39:14] the, you know, even the the scripture
[39:16] tells us that this is something that
[39:19] we're to do because we're we're to look
[39:21] at these things and then hold fast the
[39:23] things that are good. So, so far
[39:26] everything's good. Like, you know, I I
[39:30] know how the Big Bang worked. Uh, I
[39:32] don't need a scientist to tell me. I
[39:34] don't need, you know, the septilian,
[39:37] bazillion, whatever. Bazillion was a I
[39:39] thought that was a thing. They should
[39:40] have had bazillion be a thing. But we
[39:43] don't have to worry about those things
[39:45] at all simply because that the the word
[39:48] of God is always going to produce the
[39:51] word of God. If I don't mix anything
[39:53] with the word and I don't take anything
[39:56] away from the word, no matter what form
[39:59] the word is in, right? If it's water, if
[40:03] it's hydrogen and oxygen that's coming
[40:06] back to water, whatever form that that
[40:08] is in, it's always going to produce the
[40:10] same thing after it. Once I add
[40:13] something to it, if I have H2O and I
[40:17] I've split those atoms and I go to
[40:18] combine it and I throw something else in
[40:20] there, I'm going to have not pure water.
[40:23] No matter what I do, I'll still have
[40:24] water. There'll still be some truth to
[40:27] it. Just like Satan, he brought some
[40:29] truth, right? Even in the Garden of
[40:31] Eden, we we've heard that story many
[40:34] times here. Uh you know, there was some
[40:37] truth to what was being said, but what
[40:40] was in there wasn't pure anymore.
[40:43] And so that was when we when we talk
[40:46] about this stuff and we look at the form
[40:49] of things, we have a lot of different
[40:51] things where where form and function can
[40:54] really matter. And this is one of the
[40:56] places for all of us that it matters.
[40:59] Not just that that water is the source
[41:02] of life and water is the you know pretty
[41:05] much everything that drives everything
[41:08] in this world right now because without
[41:09] it you have no industry you don't have
[41:11] any life you've got nothing going on but
[41:14] the fact of the matter is is that you
[41:16] can't just drink any water. Um I've been
[41:19] to the Philippines enough times to know
[41:21] that their water I can't drink. Uh it
[41:24] it's a little bit scary actually because
[41:26] there's a lot of stuff floating around
[41:28] in it. Uh I can't see it, but I know
[41:30] it's there because of the effect it has
[41:31] on me after I've drank it accidentally.
[41:34] So if any of you have traveled to a
[41:35] third world country, now some people
[41:37] kind of build a tolerance to that and
[41:39] they're able to do it. But the reality
[41:41] is is if you're if you're born in a
[41:45] place that has water that's pure, guess
[41:49] what? You pretty much need to drink
[41:52] water that's pure.
[41:54] And saints of God, when you're born into
[41:56] the kingdom of God, that's exactly what
[41:59] you have is you have a place that you've
[42:01] been born into that is made for pure
[42:04] word. It is made for the word to be
[42:07] pure. No matter what form that you seal
[42:09] it in, no matter if it comes from a
[42:11] pulpit ministry or a mom and dad
[42:13] ministry or a farming ministry or a
[42:15] housekeeper ministry or whatever
[42:17] ministry that is that you have. If
[42:19] you're a pilot, if you're a airline
[42:21] person, whatever that ministry is, you
[42:23] know, wherever you work, whatever you
[42:25] do, you still have to have that same
[42:28] thing no matter where you go.
[42:33] Oh, get ahead of myself here.
[42:40] So
[42:42] when we're thinking of of the word in
[42:43] the form that it takes,
[42:49] sorry I flipped too many pages. um
[42:53] when we're thinking of the word in the
[42:54] form that it takes, one of the things is
[42:56] that, you know, we understand that the
[42:59] the word for us um is an important um
[43:05] I'm going to get to it eventually here.
[43:09] Yep.
[43:14] Maybe I'm going to get to it eventually
[43:16] here. I flipped too many pages. Give me
[43:18] just a second.
[43:21] because I want to bring actually just
[43:22] bring up the quote the next quote that's
[43:24] there I can just read it from there
[43:27] so we understand this this is brother
[43:28] Brandon um speaking he says so the Bible
[43:31] is the complete revelation of Jesus
[43:32] Christ was wrote by prophets God who in
[43:35] sunundry times spake to fathers by the
[43:37] prophets in the last days speaks to us
[43:39] through his son Jesus Christ which was
[43:41] the prophets of all of them put together
[43:43] Jesus was Malachi Jesus was Jeremiah
[43:45] Isaiah Elijah all that they were were in
[43:48] him and all that you are and All I am is
[43:50] in him. Words, witnesses of the word.
[43:55] So this is important because these are
[43:58] forms, right? It's not a book of
[44:01] systems. It's not a code of moral
[44:03] ethics. Neither it is a history book or
[44:07] a book of theology is not. But it's a
[44:10] revelation of Jesus Christ, God himself,
[44:14] revealed from word to flesh.
[44:18] So, what does this mean for us? Because
[44:19] we're we're reading about this and so
[44:22] that that is from Christ is revealed in
[44:24] his own word. By the way, um we're we're
[44:26] reading about this, but it's Christ
[44:31] um the revelation of Jesus Christ, God
[44:33] himself from word to flesh.
[44:36] So, well, where does that leave us? If
[44:39] you understand prophecy at all, do you
[44:41] know you're written in the Bible?
[44:44] You've heard it enough here. Everybody
[44:46] should know we're we have our place in
[44:48] the Bible. So you're a part of prophecy.
[44:52] And right now you living on the earth in
[44:54] this age is fulfilling prophecy because
[44:57] there has to be a people called out from
[44:59] the Leadyian age. There has to be a
[45:01] bride that's going to be without spot or
[45:03] wrinkle. There has to be all these
[45:05] different things. There's no way around
[45:06] it. So here comes we have the form of
[45:09] Jesus Christ. God himself revealed in
[45:12] Christ. So it was from word to flesh. So
[45:16] guess what happens? There's a bride that
[45:18] is talked about in the word and now here
[45:21] you are.
[45:23] You're in the form that I can see and
[45:25] relate to. But in reality what's
[45:27] happened is that you've come into a form
[45:30] from word which the Lord spoke into
[45:33] flesh which is sitting before us today
[45:36] or standing before you I guess in my
[45:38] case. So we understand that that's
[45:41] something that for all of us here's this
[45:43] form and it's not our form. Now we
[45:47] pamper it and we feed it and we you know
[45:50] we have our sweet tea and do whatever it
[45:52] is that we or wherever it is that we
[45:54] drink. We do all those things but the
[45:57] form that the Lord has placed here is
[46:00] something that's a hidden power
[46:04] and that form is actually on the inside.
[46:06] Right? So, we've got this fleshly thing
[46:08] that we have to deal with and it's a
[46:09] form that we have to deal with. But the
[46:11] reality is is there's a power that's
[46:12] hidden in there just like the power of
[46:15] water and the molecules that are inside
[46:16] it. And that power is is extreme. It's
[46:20] exponential actually far beyond anything
[46:23] that hydrogen and oxygen could possibly
[46:24] be. But it's an exponential power that's
[46:28] there. So, we have an exponential
[46:30] responsibility with the power that's
[46:32] given into us.
[46:35] Um, next slide please.
[46:39] Says the mechanics don't run the church.
[46:40] It's the dynamics, the Holy Ghost that
[46:42] gets into this word. It's not a seminary
[46:44] that teaches you all the theology and
[46:45] the Greek interpretations, but it's the
[46:47] dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to
[46:49] set that a fire and bring it to pass.
[46:52] So, this is where we're we're at. You
[46:54] need the Holy Ghost to set something a
[46:56] fire because like we already said, it's
[46:59] the Holy Ghost and fire. That's what the
[47:00] scripture says in multiple places. Holy
[47:02] Ghost and fire. You have to have both of
[47:04] those things to set something in order
[47:06] and to bring something to pass
[47:09] and to make it live just exactly what
[47:11] the promised word is for this hour. Not
[47:14] the mechanics, the dynamics. It takes
[47:15] mechanics and dynamics, the word and the
[47:17] spirit. They are the one that gives
[47:19] life.
[47:20] So for us when we realize that we have
[47:25] just like water, we have to have
[47:28] something beyond just a single molecule
[47:30] or even two molecules. We have to have
[47:33] that those things together in us to
[47:36] actually make us something that carries
[47:39] Christ the word and can rightly divide
[47:41] it and can rightly use it and will
[47:44] actually keep us on track through the
[47:45] course of our lives. It's something
[47:47] that'll hold you.
[47:53] We're almost there.
[47:58] Um if you want to go to the next slide,
[48:00] please.
[48:03] So from revelations it says this. And
[48:05] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[48:07] witness and the first begotten of the
[48:08] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[48:09] earth. Unto him that loved us and washed
[48:11] us from our sins in his own blood and
[48:13] hath made us kings and priests unto God
[48:16] and his father. To him be glory and
[48:18] dominion forever and ever. And then just
[48:20] go ahead to the the last one in
[48:21] Revelations there. And it says this in
[48:24] the fifth uh chapter. And they sung a
[48:27] new song, saying, Thou art worthy to
[48:28] take the book, and to open the seals
[48:30] thereof. For thou was slain, and hast
[48:32] redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of
[48:34] every kindred and tongue and people and
[48:36] nation, and hast made it unto our God
[48:38] kings and priests, and we shall reign on
[48:40] the earth.
[48:42] So
[48:44] if you're made a king and a priest, so
[48:47] for a pulpit minister, it's pretty easy
[48:49] to go priest, awesome, right? Um, but
[48:53] when you're part of maybe not the
[48:56] five-fold ministry, when you think of
[48:58] priests, that's a whole different kind
[49:01] of ball game because this is again a a
[49:05] form of something, right? The priests
[49:06] were the ones that broke the word. The
[49:08] priests were the ones that made the
[49:10] sacrifice. The priests were the ones
[49:12] that did all these different things. But
[49:14] now he's made you priests.
[49:18] So the the priests were the ones that
[49:20] led the worship. the priests were the
[49:21] ones that brought out different things.
[49:23] But the reality is all of us have a part
[49:26] in this very same thing. So many times,
[49:30] saints, we rely on the people that stand
[49:32] behind the pull pit to bring out
[49:34] something or to say something or to do
[49:36] something. And and and and that's fine
[49:39] in one sense because you do want them to
[49:42] bring out things that are going to
[49:43] change your life or make you different
[49:45] that's going to actually have an impact
[49:47] on what you do or what you say. So
[49:49] that's good. But at the same time, you
[49:52] can't just rely on them 100%.
[49:55] Because you're actually in the same
[49:58] place as they are when it comes to the
[50:00] relationship to the word. And I'm not
[50:03] talking about ministry as far as pulpit,
[50:05] but still, you're the you're the channel
[50:08] or the form that God is going to use
[50:11] wherever you are. No matter what you do,
[50:14] he's going to be able to use you. You're
[50:16] both king and priest. I guess for the
[50:19] the the sisters we'd say queen because
[50:20] we know that the bride is a queen,
[50:22] right? But he's made us something of
[50:25] royalty and he's made us something of
[50:28] authority and he's made us something of
[50:31] of word and all of us collectively, it
[50:35] doesn't matter who you are or where you
[50:36] are or whatever. Um, and just like I
[50:39] said on the brother that decided that he
[50:41] was Elohim, uh, we live in an age where
[50:44] people are very confused. uh and more so
[50:46] than probably they've ever been before
[50:48] in in time, at least as far as we know.
[50:50] Of course, the Bible says there's
[50:51] nothing new under the sun, so who knows
[50:53] what took place a long time ago, but um
[50:56] it's an interesting time that we're
[50:57] living in, right? And I just want to
[51:00] encourage you tonight to realize that
[51:03] within you, within you, Christ has in
[51:06] your form has put something in there to
[51:10] actually overcome everything that's in
[51:12] this age. No matter what it is, whether
[51:14] you have a trial that you're facing or a
[51:16] test that you're facing,
[51:19] that thing is in you. It's hidden in the
[51:21] form that you are. And I don't know
[51:23] about you all that are getting a little
[51:24] bit older, but myself, I look in the
[51:26] mirror and I'm like, what happened? It's
[51:28] like, uh, you know, sometimes you feel
[51:31] like a truck hit you and if if it did, I
[51:34] don't know when it did. But uh but it's
[51:37] amazing that you know you can look back
[51:39] and I don't know about any of you
[51:42] vintage youth this evening uh but for me
[51:44] personally you know in my mind a lot of
[51:46] times I'm still like 16 to 20 years old
[51:48] because I you know I think I can do a
[51:51] lot of stuff and then I realize not so
[51:53] much probably can't do that anymore. I
[51:56] would love to but it doesn't work out so
[51:59] well. So used to play football on a
[52:01] frozen field. Well, today if I landed on
[52:03] a frozen field, I'm probably not getting
[52:04] up. I'm gonna be there a while. I'm
[52:07] gonna need Josh and his and his buddies
[52:08] to come pick me up. Kind of the I've
[52:11] fallen and I can't get up thing.
[52:14] But, you know, when you when you have
[52:16] that uh when you have years that have
[52:19] passed and you see how your form has
[52:22] changed, you can understand that you've
[52:24] been through a lot of different things
[52:25] in life, right? You know, you go through
[52:28] childhood and we go through the
[52:30] different steps in childhood and you
[52:32] come into your teenage years when you
[52:33] think you know everything and then you
[52:35] hit your mid20s when you figure out
[52:36] maybe I didn't know as much as I thought
[52:38] I did. Hey dad, what about this? Um, you
[52:42] know, you call out and try and get help
[52:44] and then you, you know, come through
[52:45] with whether you're married or not.
[52:47] Sometimes there's children, sometimes
[52:48] there's not. It just depends. But you go
[52:50] through a lot of different stages and
[52:51] your form is changing all the time.
[52:56] But the reality is is that even though
[52:58] the form is changing, there's something
[53:00] on the inside that is always a
[53:02] reflection of Christ. Always. No matter
[53:06] how that form changes, there's always a
[53:08] reflection of Christ in there. Um,
[53:10] musicians, if you would come.
[53:14] So when we're we're thinking of those
[53:17] things, I I just want to kind of convey
[53:19] to you uh and I guess there was a
[53:22] brother actually that lives in um New
[53:24] Zealand and I was with him in the
[53:26] Philippines for some meetings and he he
[53:30] did something at the end of every sermon
[53:32] uh which was he did his takeaways. Now,
[53:34] I haven't adapted that uh particular
[53:37] adopted that particular policy so much,
[53:40] but what he found out was when people
[53:42] left and and this is not unusual because
[53:45] I'm I'm going to put my hand up first
[53:46] and say, "Yeah, that's me." People will
[53:48] leave and then a day later they say,
[53:50] "Hey, what did brother so and so
[53:51] preach?" And it's like, "Oh, it was a
[53:53] really good sermon. What was it?"
[53:55] It was really good. I'm telling you, you
[53:57] should have been there. It was awesome.
[53:58] Well, what did he preach? Well, I can
[54:01] tell you it was great. like it was right
[54:03] on the word, you know, he just laid it
[54:06] out there. It was awesome. So sometimes
[54:09] we kind of get to that particular place
[54:10] in life, right, to to where we don't
[54:13] have the memory. So what the brother did
[54:15] was he just he always laid out three
[54:17] different takeaways. Now I'm not doing
[54:18] three takeaways this evening, but just
[54:20] to kind of reiterate what we've already
[54:23] said. I I just want to convey to you as
[54:25] kings and priests, you have a role to
[54:28] play and you have a form that is a part
[54:31] of that role and regardless of where we
[54:34] find ourselves in the pulpit ministry or
[54:36] sitting uh you know digging ditches or
[54:39] whatever it is
[54:41] that form no what matter what it is it's
[54:43] still a part of Christ and as a part of
[54:46] Christ there's a power that lays in you
[54:49] and sometimes it's very unrealized power
[54:52] we look at the form of water and We
[54:54] don't realize the power a lot of times
[54:56] that water has. We just take it for
[54:57] granted. But there is a power that's
[55:01] there. And the Holy Ghost and fire,
[55:03] saints of God, will really unlock that
[55:06] really, really, really deep, strong
[55:09] overcoming power. And in fact, without
[55:12] it, there is no way to really unlock it.
[55:15] And there's no way really to catch a
[55:16] rapture. Because, you know, I like to
[55:19] talk about astronauts. You know, one of
[55:21] the things that they fuel those lovely
[55:23] spaceships that go up there with
[55:25] hydrogen and oxygen.
[55:28] Yeah. They put it now kind of risky to
[55:30] put it together because you know what
[55:31] happened with like the Challenger, those
[55:33] of you that are vintage youth. Um but
[55:37] that's in the natural. In the spiritual,
[55:40] it is not scary to put it together as
[55:43] long as you stay in the confines of the
[55:45] form that God sent it in. Once you leave
[55:48] those forms, it is scary because we can
[55:52] look in Revelation what happens to the
[55:54] church that left that form, right? They
[55:57] went off into to um conquering the leoty
[56:01] and overtaking those things. And that's
[56:03] one of the other things that I've
[56:04] noticed me personally in the message is
[56:06] a lot of people seem to feel like when
[56:09] they have a pulpit ministry that gives
[56:11] them the right to dictate to everyone
[56:12] else what should be happening like who
[56:15] you can marry. It's like, well, I'll
[56:18] consult the Lord. I'm sure the Lord now,
[56:20] the Lord could probably tell me if I'm
[56:22] gifted that way, but I can't rely on
[56:24] that. It's up to you to have a personal
[56:26] revelation of what to do. It's up to you
[56:30] to have a personal experience with the
[56:31] Lord. It's up to you to have a personal
[56:34] relationship with his word. It's up to
[56:36] you to be kings and priests in this day
[56:38] because that's what he's made you. We
[56:41] can't rely
[56:43] solely on the person standing behind the
[56:45] pullpit. You can't do that. If you do,
[56:49] you're always going to run into error
[56:51] because you're not doing what the word
[56:52] said. And if you do that, if you get
[56:56] yourself into that position or that way,
[57:00] um, and you know, you have that kind of
[57:04] mode in life, you know what's going to
[57:06] happen is you start following the pulpit
[57:07] minister who tries to control everything
[57:10] and you start telling people, hey, this
[57:12] is, you know, here's my opinion about
[57:13] this. I think this is how you should run
[57:15] things. I think your family should be
[57:17] operated this way. I think that, you
[57:19] know, when you're at work, you should do
[57:21] this. I don't think you should be saying
[57:23] this. And I you're always wanting to put
[57:25] in your opinion, which isn't based on
[57:27] the word. It's just your opinion. Now,
[57:30] if we're basing it on the word and we
[57:31] can say, "Hey, in the scripture it says
[57:33] this, but what you really need to do is
[57:36] say, hey, my experience has been X."
[57:38] Great. That's been your experience.
[57:40] Awesome. Can I match it back to the
[57:42] word? because that's where it matters
[57:45] because the form might change and that
[57:48] form may go through a lot of different
[57:54] um evolutions if I could say that word.
[57:56] I I don't really want to use it like
[57:57] science does but still there's a lot of
[58:00] different changes that happen. But the
[58:03] thing is is that you have to remember
[58:04] that the word is the word. No matter
[58:07] what form it goes to, it'll always come
[58:09] back to pure word. it can't help but do
[58:12] that. So, if our opinion gets mixed in
[58:15] with the word, guess what's going to
[58:16] happen? It causes confusion. And if our
[58:20] if our brainy ideas um and I, you know,
[58:23] I'd love to say I have lots of them. I
[58:25] don't have that many brainy ideas. Can't
[58:28] even sometimes get a a a PowerPoint put
[58:31] together. Well, um I know I have experts
[58:34] here, so I feel bad for them when I put
[58:36] a PowerPoint together because they have
[58:38] to look at it. Uh but anyways, the thing
[58:42] to I guess take away from this evening
[58:44] is that there's going to be a lot of
[58:46] flows in your life, saints, and there's
[58:48] a power within the flow, no matter what
[58:50] the flow is because you're a part of
[58:53] prophecy. Why don't you go ahead and
[58:56] stand? You're a part of the word. And
[58:59] being that,
[59:02] understand that we'll always come back
[59:03] to the same thing. We'll always come
[59:05] back to the word. the Holy Ghost. A lot
[59:08] of people say they have the Holy Ghost.
[59:09] I've I've been to churches where they
[59:11] they claim that it's the Holy Ghost
[59:13] doing stuff, and I'll tell you, it's
[59:15] very spiritfilled.
[59:17] Don't know always what spirit it is, but
[59:18] it's very spiritfilled.
[59:20] Um it not likely a lot of times the Holy
[59:24] Spirit because the Holy Spirit will do
[59:27] things, you know, in the form that the
[59:29] Holy Spirit is based on, which is the
[59:31] word. It'll always take it back to the
[59:34] word no matter what. Um, thank you by
[59:37] the way for listening this evening and
[59:39] for allowing me to be somewhat late from
[59:41] work. And again, I I won't fly uh the
[59:45] next time on a night that I preach. So,
[59:48] uh, just a little bit too much to do at
[59:49] work and then, you know, putting things
[59:51] together to come here this evening. So,
[59:54] but God's good to us. Um, can we sing
[59:57] goodness of God this evening?
[1:00:01] And then you singers help me. and
[1:00:04] brother Michael is he we're going to
[1:00:06] have him come up cuz I'm not a singer.
[1:00:08] So,
[1:00:11] but just to before we sign this, we're
[1:00:13] just going to pray
[1:00:15] and just um
[1:00:18] I just want to I just want to say, you
[1:00:21] know, when we showed that car and we're
[1:00:23] seeing uh how forms have changed just in
[1:00:26] the form of cars, the electric cars, and
[1:00:28] how much they've changed and things can
[1:00:31] look really slick and it can be really
[1:00:32] awesome. And uh if I showed that picture
[1:00:35] and put a cloud around it, you guys
[1:00:36] would probably be dreaming in church
[1:00:38] about that car and buying it and driving
[1:00:39] it or at least driving it. Uh buying it
[1:00:42] would be a pipe dream, at least for me,
[1:00:43] because you're going to have to have
[1:00:45] Elon Musk's money to afford something
[1:00:47] like that. But eventually, it's going to
[1:00:49] be a thing. Some of you kids, if the
[1:00:51] Lord carries,
[1:00:53] you know, mom and dad might be saying,
[1:00:55] "Hey, can I have a ride in your car?"
[1:00:58] Because it'd be something important. But
[1:01:01] this evening, just as we pray, I I just
[1:01:02] want to say that in those in those
[1:01:04] things, in the stages of life or in the
[1:01:06] forms that we see, that water of the
[1:01:09] word can be rightly divided. And it's
[1:01:12] powerful. It will always overcome Satan
[1:01:15] anytime, any place, anywhere. That's why
[1:01:18] it's given to us is for that enemy. And
[1:01:20] whether the enemy is us, and a lot of
[1:01:22] times it is, we're our own worst
[1:01:23] enemies. I I don't know about most of
[1:01:26] you, but often times the person that's
[1:01:29] the most critical uh of me is me. Um now
[1:01:34] there are other critics certainly, but a
[1:01:36] lot of times it's us that's the most
[1:01:38] critical. And we have to realize that
[1:01:40] grace is great and there's a goodness of
[1:01:44] God. And so let's just pray and then
[1:01:45] we're going to sing this song as brother
[1:01:47] Michael's prepared to come up. Heavenly
[1:01:49] Father, we thank you for your grace and
[1:01:50] mercy this evening, Lord, and for just
[1:01:53] everything that you mean to us, Father.
[1:01:55] And we understand this is a simple
[1:01:57] subject this evening, Lord. But Lord,
[1:02:00] your form is what matters to us. And so
[1:02:04] when we read in the scripture about the
[1:02:06] form, Father, we want to realize it's
[1:02:08] your form that we're coming into the
[1:02:10] image of. It's the image of Jesus
[1:02:11] Christ.
[1:02:13] And we understand from the prophet's
[1:02:15] word that in a seed everything that is
[1:02:18] necessary, everything that will ever
[1:02:20] produce is already laying in it. When
[1:02:22] it's in the form of a seed, when it's in
[1:02:24] the form of a stock, when it as it's
[1:02:26] growing, all the fruit that would be in
[1:02:28] it, if it's a fruitbearing seed, Lord is
[1:02:30] there. And so, Father, we realize within
[1:02:33] us, all those things are there. But we
[1:02:35] need a power to take water to unlock
[1:02:39] every stage of that growth, to lock
[1:02:42] every stage of our form, Father, so that
[1:02:44] our form will match your form. And
[1:02:47] Father, we realize that we file into
[1:02:49] that word to where everything, Lord, is
[1:02:51] to where we come in contact and in
[1:02:56] complete fellowship with Jesus Christ,
[1:02:58] the word. And so Lord, we thank you that
[1:03:01] it's not just a history book, but Lord,
[1:03:03] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[1:03:06] us. And Father, we thank you for that
[1:03:08] this evening. And Lord, we just ask that
[1:03:12] you'd be with the people, keep them as
[1:03:13] they would go home, wherever they would
[1:03:15] go, Lord. Father, we just thank you for
[1:03:18] all things. And we ask this in Jesus
[1:03:19] name. Amen.
