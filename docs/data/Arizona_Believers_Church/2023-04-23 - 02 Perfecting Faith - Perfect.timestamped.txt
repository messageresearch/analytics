[0:00] I'll give you my title for this morning
[0:02] at the outset it's perfecting faith
[0:05] and as we were on the subject of
[0:07] perfecting love last Sunday I want to
[0:09] look at it from the angle of perfecting
[0:11] faith today
[0:13] and before we get to the subject of
[0:15] perfecting Faith we're just going to
[0:16] revisit um the subject of perfect love
[0:18] for a little bit this is a series on uh
[0:21] perfect love and God's dealt with us on
[0:24] a number of different levels in terms of
[0:25] that subject and so instead of maybe
[0:27] building in a series as we would in
[0:30] different subjects I feel there are so
[0:32] many different principles related to
[0:33] perfect love that we'll just address
[0:35] them as the Lord leads and if it is in
[0:37] little Parts together with different
[0:39] subjects we'll do it and just have that
[0:41] Liberty to do it but perfect love I know
[0:43] it's a phrase that's familiar to all of
[0:45] us we've already read
[0:47] um that you hear in the scripture where
[0:49] it says perfect love casteth out fear
[0:51] it's the one place where that's put
[0:52] together in that way but as we read in
[0:55] First Corinthians chapter 12 and 13 and
[0:57] 14 we saw that love is the greatest and
[1:01] that charity as it's referred to even
[1:03] being the person of God and this
[1:05] essential attribute of God it is the sum
[1:07] of all Perfection it's greater than
[1:09] Faith greater than hope and that it is
[1:11] something that ought to be our chief
[1:13] suit so charity follow after charity
[1:15] make it your aim make it your goal and
[1:17] we even find that John is admonishing
[1:20] the Believers in his letter here in
[1:21] first John that not just love God but if
[1:24] you love God manifest and express that
[1:27] love to others and so there's just a lot
[1:29] of breadth and depth to the subject of
[1:32] perfect love now if you look at Verse 18
[1:34] where we just read it says there is no
[1:36] fear in love and I'm just going to
[1:37] review perfecting love for a few moments
[1:40] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:42] love cast out casteth out fear
[1:46] because fear hath torment he that
[1:48] feareth is not made perfect in love and
[1:51] remember how we looked at that and we
[1:53] said that our tendency is to try to do
[1:54] the math and say that if I have fear
[1:56] then I don't have perfect love and if I
[1:59] if I if I'm fearing then God's love
[2:01] hasn't cast out fear and if I'm fearing
[2:03] that I don't have perfect love to cast
[2:05] it out and I feel like something is
[2:06] wrong just by the way that we we look at
[2:09] this and we're wanting to look at it
[2:10] from a different angle to where we're
[2:12] not using it to judge ourselves but we
[2:13] use it to encourage ourselves
[2:15] and we took the phrase perfect love and
[2:19] we looked at how God's love is already
[2:21] perfect
[2:22] and that his love cannot be uh cannot
[2:25] decrease nor can it increase it cannot
[2:27] diminish or grow stronger God loves us
[2:30] with the perfect love and it is already
[2:32] perfect and cannot be made perfect so
[2:35] there's phrases we use of the love of
[2:37] God and it could refer to our love for
[2:38] him or it could be the love that God has
[2:40] for us and so because he loves us and
[2:43] his love is perfect we say his love is
[2:46] perfecting and we're making complete our
[2:49] love his love is a perfecting love it's
[2:52] accomplishing something it's a love of a
[2:53] higher intelligence it's a love that has
[2:55] a goal so when it says it's perfecting
[2:57] and even if we say love is made perfect
[3:00] means love did its job
[3:02] love accomplished something and so so
[3:04] instead of looking at it as maybe the
[3:06] finality of something or the litmus test
[3:08] of whether or not something exists we
[3:10] just say oh love is working love is
[3:12] accomplishing something love is doing
[3:14] something
[3:15] that's what it says he that feareth is
[3:17] not made perfect in love we I believe it
[3:19] was towards the end of the service we
[3:21] just said it just means there's more of
[3:22] him to know
[3:23] that if there's fear and perfect love
[3:25] casteth out fear then there's more that
[3:27] I can know about his perfect love that
[3:30] can address the fear that I have in my
[3:32] life that there's room for my love to
[3:34] grow if I believe that I love God and I
[3:37] love uh my brothers and sisters and I
[3:39] have the love of God in my heart but
[3:41] there's fear or there's doubt or there's
[3:43] some sort of uh emotional disharmony we
[3:46] don't just say oh never been there to
[3:47] begin with I got to start all over we
[3:49] just realized oh more of him to know
[3:51] more of him to experience more of him to
[3:53] grab a hold of and we realize that we
[3:55] can always fall deeper in love with him
[3:59] and First Corinthians chapter 8 and
[4:00] verse 3 it says but if any man love God
[4:03] the same is known of him
[4:06] and I think the takeaway from this as we
[4:09] read it says that he that loved God we
[4:11] believe oh that God knows the one that
[4:13] loves him
[4:15] but one way that we could say this based
[4:17] upon what we read in first John is you
[4:19] can't love God without knowing god
[4:21] and because you've known him you love
[4:24] him and we love God because he made
[4:27] himself known to us we don't love God
[4:29] because of what our mom told us as we
[4:31] were being raised you don't love God
[4:32] because what the preacher said we don't
[4:34] love God because of Sunday school we
[4:36] love him because he made himself known
[4:38] to us and in making himself known to us
[4:41] we fell in love with him whatever
[4:43] attribute that was whether it been
[4:44] forgiveness or whatever way that he
[4:46] began to make himself known to us we
[4:48] love him because he has made himself
[4:50] known so you can't I love him first
[4:54] it's because he knows you and you know
[4:56] him we looked at how that knowing the
[4:58] love of God
[5:00] necessarily has an influence upon the
[5:02] knower you cannot know the love of God
[5:04] without loving him back
[5:06] if you say well I know that he loves me
[5:08] but I don't love him then no you don't
[5:09] know that he loves you
[5:11] it's something that's true knowledge has
[5:13] an influence and as we read already in
[5:15] first John 4 19 we love him because he
[5:18] first loved us
[5:20] that's the reason the reason we love him
[5:22] is because he first loved us that's what
[5:24] begets our love that's what inspires our
[5:26] love
[5:27] and so when we look at how his love is
[5:30] being made perfect or his love being
[5:32] perfected in us his love is perfecting
[5:35] our love for him
[5:37] the love that we have in US is being
[5:39] perfected or do we do we live sinless
[5:41] lives do we never make a mistake do we
[5:43] never doubt we realize we do we make
[5:45] mistakes and we and we're sinning but
[5:47] his perfect love for us is perfecting
[5:49] our love for him that it could manifest
[5:52] itself in the ways that Christ spoke of
[5:54] if you love me you keep my Commandments
[5:56] Paul said if you love him you keep his
[5:58] Commandments and his Commandments are
[5:59] not Grievous John says if you love them
[6:01] you keep his commandment because here is
[6:03] the love of God that you keep his
[6:04] Commandments realize I'm not always
[6:06] doing what I should but you want to
[6:09] and it's his love that enables you it's
[6:11] his love that will help you to grow and
[6:13] so we have this love for him that's
[6:15] being perfected and then we see so much
[6:17] in the word of God as how it's not just
[6:19] our love to him
[6:21] but it's our love that's projected
[6:22] outward this love that we want to
[6:24] express and manifest outward uh we do
[6:27] not we're not cultists with this love
[6:28] and it's the secret love affair to where
[6:31] nobody knows but we want his love to be
[6:33] manifested through us and to others and
[6:35] that's the real thrust of what John is
[6:37] writing he's not trying to teach them
[6:39] about the love of God he's trying to
[6:40] teach them about the fact that if you do
[6:42] love God and God loves you then love
[6:44] your brethren
[6:46] and so that was the perfecting love his
[6:48] love is perfect love our love is being
[6:50] perfected growing maturing his love is
[6:54] accomplishing something our love is
[6:56] accomplishing something and it's this
[6:58] beautiful process
[6:59] and if I could sum up
[7:02] uh maybe what was that the core this
[7:05] might even be at the core of the whole
[7:06] series is that perfect love is
[7:09] obtainable because of his perfect love
[7:11] in other words I I can achieve this
[7:16] perfect love because of his perfect love
[7:19] I'm not going to sell myself short I'm
[7:21] not going to sell the promises of God
[7:22] short I I believe that Perfection is not
[7:25] Out Of Reach because of his perfect love
[7:27] from me and we want we want his love
[7:30] this perfect love to be something that
[7:31] we we're Desiring not begging for but
[7:34] Desiring to come into
[7:37] now as we go forward in and there's just
[7:39] a lot of things that even this morning I
[7:42] just felt too
[7:43] uh maybe a step away from and address uh
[7:47] at later a later time if God could just
[7:50] give me Grace maybe I'll just mention it
[7:51] right now it may be I don't want to be
[7:53] clumsy in saying it but it's a point
[7:55] that's trying I feel to make and and I
[7:58] want to be careful on how I say it
[8:00] because I guess there's just a way that
[8:02] it could be misunderstood
[8:03] and and if it is I'll take the blame
[8:06] because I'm the one saying it but
[8:08] there's times that we will that brother
[8:10] Brandon teaches something even the Bible
[8:12] is expressing different principles on a
[8:15] subject uh and it's in its truth and
[8:18] it's real we know it's revelation we
[8:19] know it's the word of God we know this
[8:21] Bible is an absolute
[8:23] and so we kind of gather statements as
[8:26] the truth and we kind of compile them as
[8:28] statements of fact about something
[8:31] and and I find I'm just going to say
[8:33] what I was wanting to maybe just leave
[8:35] off for another time
[8:36] but then that kind of becomes that
[8:39] becomes it like that's the truth when
[8:41] you say brother Brandon says faith is a
[8:43] revelation of God's will we're like if
[8:44] somebody said well faith is a confidence
[8:46] in God you're like no no no no faith is
[8:48] a revelation of God's Will and what we
[8:50] do is we take what we call these
[8:52] statements a fact about a subject and we
[8:54] make that the whole truth about the
[8:56] subject
[8:57] and we put a period on it and it's not
[9:01] that it's not truth but we have to
[9:03] recognize that God is truth
[9:06] and God is his word and so there's
[9:08] truths that are spoken in Revelations
[9:10] that are given not so that they could
[9:12] kind of be carved out as statements of
[9:14] fact or doctrines with the period on it
[9:16] but it's all for the purpose of making
[9:18] God known to us
[9:20] and so if brother Branham says something
[9:22] about uh perfect love and and maybe it's
[9:25] just very clear very succinctly no
[9:27] that's what perfect love is it's not
[9:30] said so that we could put a period on
[9:32] what perfect love is it's so that we can
[9:34] understand the truth the truth about
[9:37] perfect love which is God
[9:39] and so I I thank you for the grace and
[9:42] be able to express that and I hope it
[9:43] makes sense that we can hear truth
[9:45] believe truth and there can be
[9:46] statements of Truth or statements of
[9:48] fact but we have to be careful that
[9:50] we're not putting a period on it and
[9:53] just looking at the black and white
[9:54] looking at the quotation and saying well
[9:56] this is what it says and this is what I
[9:57] believe but recognize that that's meant
[10:00] to convey an understanding about Christ
[10:03] about the word so that we could know him
[10:06] and that's been one of the things God's
[10:09] been impressing upon me as I've studied
[10:10] the subject of perfect love is it's not
[10:12] about just getting all the definitions
[10:14] down but it's realizing in all the
[10:16] things that are said about it it should
[10:17] be adding to this beautiful full picture
[10:20] of who God is and what the word is to us
[10:24] and so I I think that was uh appropriate
[10:28] to say there because I want to use a
[10:30] statement
[10:31] and I believe I have a slide for this is
[10:33] there just a statement There Brother
[10:35] John
[10:35] this is perfect love nothing can enter
[10:38] here without it how many have heard that
[10:39] before
[10:41] and I believe that some of you probably
[10:42] already thought of this phrase over the
[10:44] last week or so maybe as we've been
[10:46] prefacing this subject coming up brother
[10:48] Banner makes this statement in the
[10:50] rejected King and he's talking about his
[10:52] experience of going beyond the curtain
[10:53] of time
[10:54] and I believe this is the Angel speaking
[10:59] in response to brother branham's
[11:01] awareness
[11:02] that there's very there's something very
[11:04] different about what he's experiencing
[11:06] and it describes the atmosphere it
[11:09] describes the feel and it describes just
[11:11] even that Dimension as this is perfect
[11:14] love
[11:15] nothing can enter here without it and so
[11:17] maybe your mind's kind of wondered there
[11:19] over the last week or so that you have
[11:21] to have perfect love to be there nothing
[11:22] can enter there without perfect love and
[11:25] when brother Brennan was describing this
[11:27] Dimension he calls it Perfection or
[11:28] actually what he says is perfection or
[11:31] Sublime cannot even adequately describe
[11:33] it so brother Ram's having a difficult
[11:36] time describing what it's like and he's
[11:38] saying well Perfection can't do it uh
[11:41] Sublime can't do it he says everything
[11:43] and kind of the thing that sounds like
[11:45] he's satisfied with is saying everything
[11:47] was perfect love
[11:48] so Perfection couldn't describe it
[11:50] Sublime couldn't describe it but when he
[11:52] would say when the angel said this is
[11:54] perfect love and brothers says
[11:55] everything was perfect love
[11:58] and for in the sermon from that time
[12:00] this is echoing the sentiment that
[12:02] without perfect love you cannot enter
[12:04] into this place of perfection you can't
[12:07] enter into this as that Dimension was a
[12:09] place of all these redeemed saints that
[12:12] they were gathered together in this
[12:14] dimension of perfection
[12:16] he says except that you have perfect
[12:18] love you'll never be there now brother
[12:20] bam is taking this a very direct
[12:23] statement because nothing could ever be
[12:25] there without it he said your spirit
[12:27] would be out of place there
[12:29] so without perfect love you wouldn't
[12:31] belong
[12:33] you'd be out of place whatever your
[12:34] wants and whatever your desires were you
[12:35] wouldn't you wouldn't uh
[12:37] you says you would be out of place
[12:40] and he says except you have that perfect
[12:42] love you will never be there so this is
[12:44] perfect love nothing can enter here
[12:46] without it unless you have that perfect
[12:47] love you'll never be there those are
[12:49] very uh obvious statements how many have
[12:52] heard those statements aware of those
[12:53] statements conscious other statements so
[12:55] what we're doing now is we're looking at
[12:56] the statements to gather something from
[12:58] it
[12:59] in the sermon or in beyond the curtain
[13:03] of time
[13:04] brother Neville is reading from the Full
[13:07] Gospel business since newsletter wherein
[13:09] it recites brother branham's story and
[13:11] so it's it's brother Neville reading
[13:13] what was written in this publication and
[13:16] it's and brother Branham is the first
[13:18] person he says I am more convinced than
[13:20] ever in my life that it'll take perfect
[13:22] love to enter that place so here's this
[13:25] is showing us just how important perfect
[13:27] love is if you want to be there you got
[13:29] to have perfect love
[13:31] and I believe what that does is it kind
[13:33] of heightens our sensitivity to whether
[13:35] or not we have perfect love
[13:37] and especially once we've read first
[13:38] John chapter four we're like well if I
[13:41] fear my love is not made perfect perfect
[13:43] love casteth not fear so there's a lot
[13:45] of things that are starting to enter
[13:46] into our our thought process to tell us
[13:50] about what perfect love is what it isn't
[13:52] and now we realize without it I can't
[13:54] even be there
[13:55] so it's a very a significant subject it
[13:59] says I'm more convinced than ever in my
[14:00] life that'll take perfect love to enter
[14:02] that place there was no jealousy no
[14:04] tiredness no sickness no old age no
[14:07] death only Supreme Beauty and joy
[14:11] whatever you do lay aside everything
[14:13] else until you get perfect love
[14:16] and pray this is important this is a
[14:19] tremendous emphasis get to where you can
[14:21] love everybody even every enemy
[14:24] this is Brother Neville right this this
[14:25] can't be brother Branham
[14:27] he says get to that where you love
[14:29] everybody and even every enemy no matter
[14:31] if the plane is rocking the
[14:33] sinner The Guns of the enemy are upon
[14:35] you these things do not matter get
[14:38] perfect love
[14:39] if you're not saved except Jesus Christ
[14:41] is your savior now if you've not been
[14:43] baptized in water be baptized now if
[14:44] you've not received the baptism of the
[14:46] Holy in the Holy Spirit receive it now
[14:48] he says press on in that perfect love
[14:51] which will take you to that beautiful
[14:53] and joyful place beyond the curtain of
[14:56] time
[14:58] these are statements I know that we're
[14:59] very familiar with true statements and
[15:02] and
[15:03] important statements to consider
[15:05] but this is where I would remind us to
[15:07] be careful
[15:09] because we could very easily create a
[15:11] litmus test again
[15:13] and ask ourselves well do I love
[15:15] everybody do I love my enemies am I
[15:17] laying aside everything to get perfect
[15:19] love and so what we do is we kind of
[15:20] invent a new level to attain to in order
[15:23] to get into heaven or to get into this
[15:25] dimension
[15:26] and we say well I know what salvation is
[15:29] and I know what it is to be born again
[15:30] and I know what it is to believe the
[15:32] message I know what it means to have the
[15:34] Holy Ghost but what I need to do is I
[15:36] need to get perfect love in order for
[15:38] myself to be there
[15:40] and I would say this these statements
[15:42] were never meant to carve out an another
[15:46] experience that we need to achieve in
[15:48] order to be in eternity
[15:50] it's not that the word has always been
[15:52] the same and brother Brandon preached
[15:53] something and then he has this
[15:54] experience beyond the curtain of time
[15:56] and he's like oh I've been wrong all
[15:57] this time about something uh we need to
[16:00] be saved we need the Holy Ghost but
[16:01] whatever you do is press into that
[16:03] perfect love and now somehow opened up a
[16:06] mystery to this other level that can be
[16:08] unlocked and we can attain to in order
[16:11] to be in that dimension
[16:13] brother bam says in the sermon from that
[16:15] time we've already read he says except
[16:16] you have that perfect love you'll never
[16:17] be there and now listen to how he says
[16:19] except you're born again and the spirit
[16:22] of God of love comes into your heart
[16:24] you'll certainly miss that place
[16:26] so notice how he says the same thing but
[16:29] maybe uses a language that we're a
[16:30] little bit more accustomed to except
[16:32] you're born again and the spirit of God
[16:34] of love comes into your heart you'll
[16:36] certainly miss that place so except you
[16:38] have perfect love you'll never be there
[16:40] and brother says unless you except
[16:41] you're born again you'll never be in
[16:43] that place unless you have the spirit of
[16:45] God of love that comes in your heart
[16:46] you'll certainly miss that place
[16:48] then he says it this way and Beyond the
[16:50] curtain of time brother says I don't
[16:52] understand this this is something
[16:54] entirely different from our human love I
[16:56] don't want to go back to that old body
[16:58] on the bed then a voice spoke to me this
[17:01] is what you preached that the Holy Ghost
[17:03] is
[17:04] this is perfect love nothing cannot
[17:07] enter here without it
[17:10] so it says uh this is showing us and I
[17:13] believe that we'll have opportunity at
[17:14] some point to address the evidence of
[17:16] the Holy Ghost on this subject since
[17:18] brother Branham brought love into view
[17:21] when he discussed that because this is
[17:23] what you preach the Holy Ghost is this
[17:26] is perfect love nothing can enter here
[17:28] without it so what's our takeaway
[17:30] perfect love is the baptism of the Holy
[17:32] Ghost
[17:33] perfect love it is a new birth
[17:35] it is it is God who is love dwelling
[17:38] inside of you permanently
[17:40] and so brother Branham has not taken us
[17:43] from into a new birth and and we we've
[17:46] been born again and we have the Holy
[17:48] Ghost and we're serving God and all of a
[17:49] sudden it's like and
[17:53] you need to get perfect love and we're
[17:55] all sudden like I didn't realize this I
[17:57] didn't know this
[17:59] I didn't realize that I could have the
[18:00] Holy Ghost and somehow show up in this
[18:03] Dimension and say yeah but do you love
[18:05] that guy who dented your car
[18:07] and you're like uh which guy
[18:11] you mean my car got dented right and you
[18:14] and you're realizing oh there's this
[18:16] conflict of emotions maybe I won't be
[18:17] entered in it's not it if you have the
[18:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is perfect
[18:21] love
[18:22] perfect love is the baptism of the Holy
[18:24] Ghost it is the new birth it's God who
[18:26] is love dwelling inside of you so he has
[18:29] not in going beyond the curtain of time
[18:31] he wasn't trying to these things weren't
[18:34] being expressed by the angel or brother
[18:35] Brahm and his response to what he was
[18:37] experiencing was not trying to come and
[18:40] then give us a language that we would
[18:42] restrict ourselves to to uh redefine
[18:46] what it means to be born again
[18:48] but it was meant to understand better
[18:51] what that experience is and what it
[18:53] ought to produce
[18:54] brother Brandon and I wish I would have
[18:56] written it down I just have the phrase
[18:57] here he says place within your heart
[18:59] he's praying for his sister
[19:01] he says place within her heart tonight
[19:03] that Divine love that holy spirit of God
[19:08] so the spirit of God is divine love God
[19:12] is love and God and there's ways that
[19:14] God is described he's a consuming fire
[19:16] these attributes and characteristics of
[19:18] God that Divine love place it within our
[19:20] heart what is that Divine love the holy
[19:22] spirit of God
[19:23] in the sermon why is it that so many
[19:25] Christians find it so hard to live the
[19:27] Christian Life One of the longest sermon
[19:29] titles he says may you thoroughly
[19:31] understand that it isn't Church it isn't
[19:33] intellectuals isn't knowing the Bible is
[19:36] it any of these things it's God's love
[19:39] the holy spirit in the middle of that
[19:41] spirit that you've quit drinking and
[19:43] quit smoking and quit lying what is it
[19:45] it's God's love
[19:47] the holy spirit in the middle of that
[19:49] spirit and God's love is a perfect love
[19:52] and without perfect love you will not be
[19:54] there
[19:55] and I'm not just simply doing math and
[19:58] I'm not just drawing logical conclusions
[19:59] these are the teachings of scripture
[20:01] this is the teaching of brother Branham
[20:03] that it's when he says nothing but
[20:04] perfect love will be there he's talking
[20:06] about the Holy Spirit as a seal upon his
[20:08] person's soul that should be there and
[20:11] then I believe we're admonished by
[20:13] brother Brandon and say make sure you
[20:15] have that
[20:17] lay aside everything else until you get
[20:19] that press into that whatever you do
[20:22] press on in that perfect love and I
[20:24] believe that it's also an admonishment
[20:26] to those of us who have this new birth
[20:28] experience to recognize what I possess
[20:31] is the love of God and remember one of
[20:33] those outstanding characteristics of the
[20:35] love of God
[20:36] I think was when we were preaching on
[20:37] this series of Christ my healer is that
[20:40] that for love to be projected and to
[20:43] have that kind of love the love of God
[20:45] is to love when it's difficult to do so
[20:48] or to love when we believe it's
[20:50] Justified not to or to love when we find
[20:54] that it's very very difficult if not
[20:55] impossible to do it that's the love of
[20:58] God could you not agree with that that
[21:00] the love of God loves when it's
[21:02] impossible for us to love his love can
[21:04] love
[21:06] and brother Branham and other places I
[21:07] believe this might be an adoption part
[21:09] four he says perfect redeeming
[21:10] unadulterated love of the Holy Ghost
[21:12] into a human soul that's passed from
[21:15] death into life
[21:16] notice how he's using these phrases and
[21:18] I just used some quick ones because
[21:19] we're wanting to go forward in this
[21:20] subject
[21:21] how that the perfect love is God
[21:26] perfect love is eternal life eternal
[21:28] life is the Holy Spirit dwelling in a
[21:31] person Soul by the baptism of the Holy
[21:33] Ghost and so he has not created another
[21:36] surprise level
[21:38] that we now that we have the Holy Ghost
[21:40] and we're sealed Sons and Daughters of
[21:41] God that if I'm ever going to be there I
[21:43] now have to press into perfect love and
[21:46] this is a new mystery about the message
[21:47] no I believe it is the same holy ghost
[21:50] that we've heard preached before but
[21:52] it's helping us to understand what that
[21:54] Holy Ghost is
[21:57] I believe that when we look at it this
[21:59] way and we take what brother Branham not
[22:01] when we look at it this way but when we
[22:02] understand what brother Branham is
[22:03] saying it removes the complication
[22:05] that if there was a part of us that felt
[22:07] well I know I got the Holy Ghost but I
[22:08] need that perfect love as some sort of
[22:10] Entry requirement then maybe we didn't
[22:12] quite understand it the Holy Ghost
[22:14] allows you to be there
[22:16] but if you recognize you don't have
[22:18] perfect love then that's what you want
[22:19] to do is press into that perfect love I
[22:21] believe it removes the complication
[22:23] I believe it takes us out of the place
[22:25] of I'm trying to make it I'm trying to
[22:27] make it I want to prove myself and make
[22:29] sure that I'm going to make it it takes
[22:31] it away from this realm to where haven't
[22:33] you noticed that sometimes whether it's
[22:35] our own doing or somebody else is just
[22:37] doing this to us they take the word and
[22:39] they always just put it just Out Of
[22:40] Reach
[22:42] you're like that rodent in Ice Age who's
[22:45] just always
[22:47] right just always so close right I don't
[22:50] know why it reminds me of Lucas because
[22:52] I remember he would always dramatize not
[22:54] this Lucas Lucas coffee would always
[22:56] dramatize and tell me the story of we're
[22:58] going back 20 years now though uh and
[23:00] and it's just always Out Of Reach and
[23:02] just as soon as you get there preacher
[23:04] says but and it just starts rolling
[23:06] further away from you
[23:08] and every time you get close it just
[23:10] gets moved just a little bit more and
[23:11] move just a little bit more it's almost
[23:12] as if the preacher's panicking that
[23:14] you'll get it
[23:21] right so perfect love is not Out Of
[23:23] Reach things
[23:25] and if you have the Holy Ghost you have
[23:27] perfect love
[23:30] so perfecting faith
[23:32] it was remarkable how the Lord dealt
[23:33] with me on this and I I realize that
[23:36] we'll just go it's going to go slowly
[23:37] through uh this without necessarily a
[23:40] real clear track but just knowing
[23:42] there's different things that the Lord
[23:43] may cause us to pick up as we go along
[23:44] but I realize that in that you cannot
[23:47] address perfect love
[23:49] without also addressing perfect faith
[23:52] just found out that I could not
[23:54] refer to the one
[23:56] and preaching on perfecting love and
[23:58] faith not be a part of the conversation
[24:00] in the sermon perfect Faith we're
[24:02] drawing a lot from this sermon he says
[24:04] in faith and love is relation because
[24:06] you can't have faith unless you've got
[24:08] love because your faith is in a God Who
[24:10] is the very essence of love Faith and
[24:12] love works together you know it's a very
[24:15] familiar statement to all of us but
[24:16] brother Branham has now related them and
[24:18] I would say he's putting them together
[24:19] in such a way to where he says well it's
[24:21] just obvious he says you can't have
[24:23] faith unless you have love
[24:24] and so they both work together so it's
[24:27] not in this it's not that we'd say oh
[24:29] well you should only have this or you
[24:31] should only have that but they're
[24:33] complementary to each other and they
[24:35] work together as we look before in First
[24:37] Corinthians 13 it says the greatest of
[24:39] faith hope and charity is charity
[24:41] and he says but now is faith hope and
[24:43] charity why because you need the faith
[24:45] and you need the hope but one day
[24:47] they're both going to be assumed into
[24:49] the summation of all perfect love and
[24:52] into
[24:53] into the sum of all Perfection which is
[24:55] charity and so they're complementary to
[24:57] each other they work together we don't
[24:59] cause them to fight each other and say
[25:01] well my charity can beat up your faith
[25:03] right and and maybe wouldn't surprise me
[25:06] if those words haven't been used given
[25:08] the names that are given sometimes to
[25:09] children
[25:10] but it is a
[25:12] it is not a competition
[25:15] but they work together in Galatians
[25:18] chapter 5 verses 5 6 and 7 for we
[25:21] through the spirit wait for the hope of
[25:22] righteousness by faith so there's that
[25:25] hope that we have because we believe and
[25:27] because we have faith it says for in
[25:28] Jesus Christ neither circumcision
[25:30] availeth anything nor uncircumcision
[25:32] it's not what you have done in the flesh
[25:36] or the condition of the flesh that's
[25:37] going to Merit you righteousness in
[25:39] Christ because it's through the spirit
[25:41] we wait for the hope of righteousness by
[25:43] faith not by circumcision not by
[25:45] legalism not by discipline or Not by
[25:48] avoiding legalism nor uncircumcision but
[25:51] he says but Faith which worketh by love
[25:55] I think this is good to recognize this
[25:56] Faith which worketh by love this phrase
[26:00] is to me it's a it's a really easy one
[26:04] to remember and to recall and it's it's
[26:06] Faith Faith Works by love
[26:09] it operates by love and then he says you
[26:11] did run well who did hinder you that you
[26:13] should not obey the truth so as he's as
[26:16] you follow this progression you have
[26:18] faith and you believe and you have this
[26:19] hope and expectation of righteousness by
[26:21] faith and he says and this is faith that
[26:23] works by love and we know that love
[26:25] manifests itself in doing the
[26:27] Commandments of God now believe it maybe
[26:28] chapter six where he says this is the
[26:30] love of God that you keep his
[26:31] Commandments and his Commandments are
[26:32] not Grievous and he's saying you did run
[26:34] well what's hindering you
[26:36] what's keeping you there was something
[26:38] in you that was good there was something
[26:39] in you doing well but what's keeping you
[26:41] from obeying the truth but what I want
[26:43] you to focus on is this Faith which
[26:45] works by love this is the principle of
[26:48] life
[26:49] that there is something inside of you
[26:51] there is there's a power inside of you
[26:53] and Faith expresses its power through
[26:56] love
[26:57] Faith expresses its power through
[26:59] obedience to the word of God you believe
[27:01] and you have faith well then it's love
[27:03] that's operational it's love that's
[27:05] acting I have faith but I also have love
[27:07] which is operational love is acting
[27:10] brother Berman the sermon desperations
[27:12] and I know we've tracked these exact
[27:14] things over the last couple years here
[27:17] he says and I don't believe we did it
[27:18] five years ago we've done it in the last
[27:20] two and a half years here and he says
[27:22] and the only way that you can have faith
[27:23] is have love first so now he's given us
[27:27] some sort of order
[27:28] to this and I would say it's important
[27:31] that we don't try to uh get completely
[27:33] dissect this and be able to become
[27:36] uh the Apologetics on this and say no
[27:39] you what you know what came first we
[27:40] know what came first the chicken not the
[27:42] egg but to rather just recognize that
[27:45] there's some there's some principles
[27:46] trying to highlight something's trying
[27:48] to emphasize the only way that you can
[27:49] have faith is have love first because
[27:51] after all faith is Love's incentive
[27:55] incentive that's exactly what faith is
[27:57] it's an incentive to love now if you
[28:00] don't have love you can't have faith
[28:02] so without love there is no faith and
[28:04] even when it comes to feel your love
[28:06] it's the feeling of love and affection
[28:08] that you might have for somebody that
[28:09] kind of gives you the confidence in them
[28:10] or trust in them and he's saying what
[28:13] about agape love what about the love of
[28:15] God and loving God and he says faith is
[28:17] Love's incentive it's the thing that
[28:19] motivates or encourages
[28:22] what motivates one to do something it's
[28:25] what encourages one to do something so I
[28:27] say it this way and I'm going to find
[28:29] myself inverting it but Faith motivates
[28:31] love
[28:32] Faith motivates action we looked at how
[28:35] that love is something that can be
[28:36] expressed and not just be a feeling and
[28:38] so Faith motivates love but then we also
[28:41] recognize that if you have love first it
[28:43] motivates and encourages faith
[28:45] so you have you have love for God and
[28:48] that love for God gives you confidence
[28:49] in God gives you trust in God I would
[28:52] say that this could very well be at the
[28:54] core of a lot of our a lot of people's
[28:56] issues when it comes to trusting God and
[28:58] believing God is it's as if we present
[29:00] to them confidence absent love oh you
[29:04] just need to believe them you just need
[29:05] to trust them you just need to put your
[29:07] faith and confidence in God and you're
[29:09] like I'm not even sure I know who you're
[29:10] talking about
[29:11] I'm not even sure I don't know this God
[29:14] you're speaking about I don't know what
[29:16] his nature is his characteristics are
[29:17] why should I trust him and listen that's
[29:20] a valid comment when you just try to get
[29:22] people to blindly trust in a deity
[29:25] because we're using the phrase God and
[29:27] we think we know exactly what we're
[29:28] talking about well you just need to
[29:29] believe the message you just need to
[29:30] believe the message you just need to
[29:31] believe the message and to them the
[29:33] message is a character that they don't
[29:34] love
[29:36] the message is is embodied in
[29:38] personalities that have misrepresented
[29:40] the nature and character of Christ and
[29:42] so you're asking them to trust something
[29:43] that they detest or they don't even know
[29:45] and so what we should desire more than
[29:48] anything is not that just people would
[29:49] come to trust the god that we trust but
[29:52] that they would know the God We Trust in
[29:54] whom we've learned that we loved first
[29:57] and learned to trust him
[30:00] and so love now because we love them it
[30:03] motivates and encourages our faith
[30:05] and you cannot have true trust and
[30:08] confidence Without Love
[30:09] so we have love and what does it produce
[30:11] it produces Trust
[30:13] which this is one thing as I've studied
[30:16] this this is maybe just a little bit of
[30:17] an aside
[30:19] as we say
[30:20] here's an example
[30:22] I hope you're paying careful attention
[30:24] to what I'm saying because I'm not
[30:25] trying to get in trouble
[30:27] but we say Zoe
[30:29] and we say that's god's own life
[30:31] but Zoe in the scripture is used of just
[30:34] a human's life not God's life
[30:37] so there's word Agape I always say well
[30:39] that's that's the love of God but you
[30:40] know the same word is used of love for
[30:42] things that aren't Godly
[30:44] or of God so we take these phrases and
[30:47] these words like oh no no this is all it
[30:48] can mean this is all it can mean this is
[30:49] all it could mean and then when it comes
[30:51] to Faith or like faith belief and we try
[30:54] to understand what faith is Faith is
[30:55] confidence
[30:57] the word faith or trust it's just trust
[30:59] or confidence in something and so and I
[31:02] say I'm not trying to narrow the
[31:04] definition it's just realizing wow
[31:05] there's a lot to Faith that I could
[31:07] never just distill down to a few sound
[31:09] bites
[31:11] but if you love it produces confidence
[31:13] and you have to have confidence it shows
[31:16] in love expressed
[31:20] and I couldn't think of the right word
[31:22] for it it wasn't kinetic energy I
[31:24] thought maybe it was Dynamo
[31:25] but it was it was
[31:28] it's a power where the other force is
[31:31] feeding off the other Force
[31:33] and kind of like the kinetic motion to
[31:35] where it's its own its own Mass
[31:39] is giving it energy
[31:41] and they're feeding off of one another
[31:43] perpetually and will never stop because
[31:46] the one you love and it gives you trust
[31:48] and Trust expresses love and then love
[31:50] trust and it just creates this powerful
[31:52] Dynamo these omnipotents tumbling
[31:54] together producing Divine energy and
[31:57] that's how faith and love are working
[31:58] together
[32:00] and that would be my
[32:04] uh expressing to you
[32:06] where God began to deal with me how that
[32:08] you can't deal with perfecting love
[32:10] without talking about perfecting faith
[32:13] and as we address perfect love
[32:15] last time I believe it establishes a
[32:17] parallel and we looked at perfect love I
[32:19] believe it establishes a parallel for
[32:21] looking at perfect Faith so I would say
[32:23] don't take this truth or misuse the
[32:27] truth to create some sort of false
[32:28] litmus test of whether or not you have
[32:30] perfect Faith but let's understand what
[32:32] perfect faith is
[32:34] brother Brown in the sermon perfect
[32:35] faith says perfect faith is pure just as
[32:38] pure as love is
[32:39] it's already said they they work
[32:40] together they are relation you can't
[32:42] have faith unless you've got love so
[32:44] they each require the other he says
[32:46] perfect faith is pure just as pure as
[32:48] love is remember when we looked at the
[32:50] love of God you could use the phrase the
[32:52] love of God to refer to three different
[32:54] things the love which God is which is an
[32:57] essential characteristic of God the love
[32:59] that God shows or the love that we have
[33:01] for God
[33:02] so he says well the love of God is pure
[33:05] and that could refer to the love that
[33:06] you have for God
[33:08] and it would be pure you say the love of
[33:10] God is pure and that's the love that he
[33:12] has shown you which it is pure
[33:14] or the love which God is is pure and so
[33:17] you could use the same phrase to
[33:18] describe different have different
[33:20] emphasis or different meanings
[33:22] the same is said of Faith you could
[33:25] speak of the faith which would be that
[33:28] which God has revealed through his word
[33:30] and the scripture speaks of the faith
[33:33] and it's so it's not necessarily
[33:34] attributed to any person but it stands
[33:36] at its own is that which God has
[33:38] revealed through his word is the faith
[33:39] or it could be the faith of God and it's
[33:42] actually referring to God's faith
[33:44] and then we also know that we have our
[33:46] own faith or if we could say our faith
[33:48] in God so you have the faith of God the
[33:51] faith
[33:52] of God or you could have the faith of
[33:55] God that we have in God
[33:57] and we know that when it comes to love
[33:59] God's love is perfect our love is
[34:01] perfecting so here's my thesis on faith
[34:05] God's faith perfect our faith being
[34:08] perfected
[34:11] in Galatians chapter 2 verse 20. we'll
[34:13] just walk through several scriptures
[34:14] here to bring out
[34:16] these different levels of Faith you have
[34:18] the faith of God which is his faith you
[34:21] have the faith of God which is that
[34:22] which he reveals and the faith of God
[34:24] which was the faith we would have in God
[34:26] or our faith in God
[34:28] in Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 Paul
[34:30] says I am crucified with Christ
[34:32] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[34:35] liveth in me and the life which I now
[34:37] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[34:41] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[34:43] himself for me
[34:45] remember this as we go forward it says
[34:48] in referencing the faith of the Son of
[34:50] God he says who loved me I remember this
[34:53] and he does not just end there with the
[34:56] period it's not just he loved me but he
[34:59] gave himself for me
[35:00] so he loved him and that would be a
[35:04] condition a state of feeling that now it
[35:07] is expressed through positive action in
[35:09] that he gave himself for me
[35:12] so he does not say well I live by the
[35:13] faith the Son of God who loved me and
[35:14] says well he loves you yeah I've been
[35:17] told that he loves me so I'm living by
[35:19] the faith of the Son of God in whom I've
[35:20] been told that he loves me says but he
[35:22] manifestly declared that love in that he
[35:24] gave his life for me
[35:27] and now he refers to the faith of the
[35:29] Son of God and he says I actually live
[35:31] by the faith of the Son of God so this
[35:35] faith is a living faith
[35:37] if I could look at it from this
[35:39] perspective and I apologize if I'm not
[35:41] very Dynamic today I I was just hoping
[35:43] my suit would be enough
[35:47] so all of you who just weren't impressed
[35:49] by it I'll try to preach a little bit
[35:50] more dynamically
[35:52] to keep you from looking at me like
[35:53] something's wrong
[35:55] but the faith of the son maybe it's my
[35:57] suit so I forgive you but the faith of
[36:00] the Son of God it is a living faith
[36:04] and it is if I can look at it from this
[36:06] perspective it is that is the faith
[36:09] which is revealed by Jesus Christ
[36:12] so it says I live by the faith of the
[36:14] Son of God I'm not living by any other
[36:17] faith I'm not living by religion I'm not
[36:18] living by Judaism I'm not living by the
[36:21] the statement of facts that we've
[36:22] compiled of the prophets but I'm living
[36:24] by the faith of the Son of God brother
[36:27] Branham says in earliest earnestly
[36:29] contending for the faith that was once
[36:30] delivered to the Saints is that more
[36:31] words than the other one but he says
[36:34] then the first one to introduce the
[36:35] faith for the Christian church was none
[36:37] other than Jesus himself
[36:39] this isn't a very important principle
[36:41] for us as message Believers to
[36:43] understand that Christ was the one that
[36:46] introduced the Christian faith to the
[36:48] Christian church and so if we see the
[36:50] pattern of John the Baptist and the
[36:52] pattern of Elijah it has to be Christ
[36:53] that introduces the faith to the
[36:56] Christian Church it says he was the
[36:58] introduction of the faith that was to be
[37:01] handed to the Christian church
[37:03] so this is the faith that is revealed by
[37:05] God this is the faith that is given to
[37:09] the elect there is a faith that we could
[37:10] say is that which stands on its own
[37:13] there's a faith that is revealed there's
[37:14] a faith that is given that is the gift
[37:16] of God and Paul is saying I live by the
[37:19] faith of the Son of God this is that
[37:20] Divine gift that God has given me that
[37:23] is not just human trust that is not just
[37:26] human Ascent that is not just
[37:27] intellectual but I'm living by a living
[37:30] faith that is on the inside of my soul
[37:32] and I'm living by the faith of the Son
[37:34] of God the the truth that has been
[37:36] revealed to me by Jesus Christ
[37:41] and then there's a another aspect to
[37:44] this faith in Revelations chapter 2
[37:46] verse 13 it says I Know Thy works now
[37:48] God's speaking I Know Thy works and
[37:50] where thou dwellest even where Satan's
[37:52] seat is
[37:53] and I'll hold as fast my name and Hast
[37:57] not denied my faith
[37:59] so now this is Christ speaking and we
[38:02] know that there is a faith of the Son of
[38:04] God which is revealed to the elect
[38:07] and so when he says my faith you have
[38:09] not denied my faith
[38:11] it's not just
[38:13] well I'll say this
[38:15] when it comes to his faith
[38:17] it is not just his faith as something
[38:20] that is revealed
[38:22] but when it and maybe if this scripture
[38:24] isn't just exactly the right one to use
[38:26] I'll use some other scriptures here in a
[38:28] moment but it's speaking of his own his
[38:31] own faith
[38:33] his own his own Trust
[38:36] they have not doubted him
[38:39] that you have not denied my faith that
[38:41] there's no doubting my trust or my
[38:43] confidence because faith is an attitude
[38:46] of trustworthiness when we speak of our
[38:48] faith it's your trust and confidence in
[38:50] God's word now there's a lot of
[38:52] different ways we could describe it but
[38:53] if you just take the Greek and the
[38:54] pistas and you want to look at it in a
[38:56] conjugation you say it just speaks of
[38:57] one's trust and confidence in something
[39:00] and so our faith is our own personal
[39:02] trust commitment to a belief in and
[39:05] confidence in God's word so when he says
[39:08] my faith it speaks of his own confidence
[39:12] it speaks of his own faith it's
[39:14] something that is now a Faith of Christ
[39:17] not just in something he reveals but
[39:18] even a trust in the confidence that God
[39:20] has
[39:21] in Romans chapter 3 verse 3 it says for
[39:23] what if some did not believe shall their
[39:26] unbelief and this is the negative of
[39:28] Faith the very word that's used is
[39:30] anti-faith or antithetical to trust or
[39:32] confidence what if they did not believe
[39:34] or shall their unbelief it's the uh
[39:37] apostola or something that speaking of
[39:39] it this is negative of Faith so shall it
[39:42] make their faith shall make thee Faith
[39:44] their unbelief their lack of faith make
[39:47] the faith of God without effect
[39:50] now some of you you might have already
[39:52] had this thought
[39:54] it does seem odd to attribute the
[39:57] characteristic of Faith to God
[40:00] and say well
[40:01] God has faith
[40:03] but there is a concept of God's faith
[40:07] and he said Can there unbelief
[40:11] cause God to disbelieve what he's
[40:14] promised
[40:16] can their lack of faith
[40:18] and confidence disinull God's
[40:22] faithfulness
[40:23] so it and it's like if you you say I
[40:26] promise I promise I'll do this for you I
[40:28] I I promise I promise I'll do it I'm
[40:31] gonna do it I promise I promise and the
[40:33] person says I don't think you will
[40:36] right nah I don't think you can do it I
[40:38] don't think you can afford it and that
[40:39] might do what to us oh really
[40:42] oh it discourages us takes away our
[40:45] confidence we no longer trust in our
[40:47] promise we we begin to doubt our ability
[40:49] and as the fact that people don't
[40:51] believe God will keep his word does it
[40:53] annul God's confidence in his own word
[40:56] he's like man there's billions and
[40:58] billions of people that think I'm a
[40:59] fraud there's billions and billions of
[41:00] people that don't even believe in me
[41:01] there's people who've rejected me they
[41:03] don't love me is God fretting no is God
[41:06] doubting
[41:07] the faith of the Son of God my faith as
[41:10] he says in Revelations 2 13 and now the
[41:13] faith of God actually speak of God's own
[41:15] faith
[41:17] brother makes this statement he says in
[41:19] several places but this to me was just a
[41:21] real beautiful way how he phrases a
[41:23] little bit broader than just uh one
[41:25] little phrase he says all things that
[41:27] you see were made by faith in the spoken
[41:29] word of God
[41:30] now who was listening and who was
[41:32] believing was it the Angels was
[41:34] everybody waiting and then brother and
[41:35] then God said let there be and the angel
[41:37] said I believe that I'm expecting that
[41:39] and it was their faith that did it he
[41:41] says no he says God said let there be
[41:44] and he believed his own word
[41:46] so God had confidence in what he spoke
[41:49] God had confidence in what he said God
[41:52] had trust God had faith now if I could
[41:55] just just vary just a little bit and
[41:57] hope to revisit this and maybe we'll
[41:58] just say it now and we'll keep repeating
[42:00] it God's faith speaks to where if we
[42:04] have trust and faith in him and we love
[42:06] him and therefore we trust him
[42:11] he loves you
[42:13] so when God has Faith he trusts you
[42:17] he's got I know it sounds crazy right
[42:20] and we can all talk about it at lunch
[42:22] and be like I don't know what he's
[42:23] thinking
[42:24] but he loves you and therefore there's
[42:27] an attitude of trust
[42:29] there's an attitude of confidence and we
[42:32] can keep saying well but this about this
[42:33] but this is no no I love you you got
[42:35] this
[42:37] yes and any and he believes in you
[42:40] and he has trust in you he has faith in
[42:42] you
[42:43] and so when God spoke it's the same
[42:46] characteristic of trustworthiness
[42:48] there's this attitude he said let there
[42:50] be and he believed his own word he
[42:52] trusted it would happen
[42:54] and so God is the the faith of God
[42:59] is the belief that God has or the trust
[43:02] or confidence that God has and here it
[43:04] says God he said let there be and he
[43:06] believed his own word and
[43:07] now if I could say this
[43:10] to add this kind of this other parallel
[43:13] that when the faith of God speaks of the
[43:17] faithfulness of God to his word
[43:20] so the faith we can say are his revealed
[43:23] promises
[43:25] but then his faithfulness
[43:27] is his commitment to what he has
[43:29] revealed
[43:30] because it says wow you know some don't
[43:33] believe
[43:34] and can their disbelief annul or negate
[43:37] God's faithfulness to what he's
[43:39] prophesied
[43:40] if we got enough people to sign what
[43:43] it's not GoFundMe but was it changed or
[43:45] what's the place that we go sign
[43:46] petitions brother Travis you're always
[43:48] on there signing petitions right no he
[43:49] doesn't know what I'm talking about
[43:51] but there's some place where everyone
[43:53] goes and signs up and they want to
[43:54] change the name you know they want to
[43:56] and everyone signs up God there's not a
[43:59] GoFundMe or a go petition me or whatever
[44:02] to to change God's mind
[44:06] and God's not up there just kind of
[44:07] running the metrics and going man I need
[44:09] a brother who's really good at data
[44:11] analytics and where are the thoughts of
[44:12] the people these days I said yeah you
[44:14] know what God a lot of people don't care
[44:15] if there is a Rapture things are getting
[44:16] so good on Earth and he'll be like all
[44:18] right fine no rapture no he's dedicated
[44:21] to it
[44:23] it's committed to it
[44:24] and so herein reveals another Peril as
[44:27] it may be revealed but this is where and
[44:30] when I say parallel we looked at a
[44:31] pattern of understanding perfect love
[44:33] and we're kind of taking the same
[44:35] template now looking at perfect faith
[44:37] and so when it came to perfect love we
[44:40] kind of looked at these different uses
[44:41] of noun and verb to understand what love
[44:44] is being used in the scripture to know
[44:47] the love that you must have but then the
[44:48] love that must be shown
[44:50] and so there's related Concepts when it
[44:52] comes to Faith you can have faith but
[44:54] then there's faithfulness which is this
[44:56] essentially the same word but it's
[44:57] conveying something different
[44:59] with perfect love you have Agape which
[45:01] is the noun it'd be something that you
[45:03] have then you'd have the agapa all which
[45:06] would be the verb the agapa O which is
[45:08] this it's something that you would use
[45:10] to oh I love that and it's and he was
[45:14] loving this and there was something that
[45:16] speaks of one is a feeling or possession
[45:18] or I have love for something and the
[45:20] other is a showing or an acting on that
[45:23] so one is felt the other scene
[45:26] like I feel the love that I have for you
[45:28] but then if I love you you feel it too
[45:32] and so when it comes to Faith and
[45:34] faithfulness faith is that which is our
[45:36] possession
[45:37] faith is that what we hold faith is
[45:39] something the condition of the Soul
[45:40] faith is a condition of believing but
[45:43] then faithfulness is the expression of
[45:45] that faith
[45:46] it says in Revelations 2 19 now God is
[45:49] speaking later to the next Church age I
[45:51] Know Thy works and charity and service
[45:54] and faith
[45:56] and so we could take this to say I Know
[45:58] Thy works and I Know Thy charity and I
[46:00] Know Thy service and I know thy faith
[46:02] and I Know Thy patience and I Know Thy
[46:04] works
[46:05] so when he says I know thy faith he's
[46:08] speaking about their faith the prior
[46:11] Church age they had not denied his faith
[46:13] and now he's not addressing his faith
[46:15] and their trust and confidence in his
[46:18] faith of the denial of his trust and
[46:20] confidence but now he's actually saying
[46:21] I know your faith
[46:24] so there's the faith of God which is
[46:26] that which he has revealed through his
[46:27] word there is the faith of God which is
[46:29] his own belief and conviction and there
[46:31] is your faith
[46:33] brother Branham in chapter six of the
[46:35] church age book says now he does not say
[46:37] here as he did to the church in pergamus
[46:39] you hold my faith and somebody's saying
[46:41] where did brother Aaron come up with
[46:42] this I just got it from the message
[46:44] isn't that an amazing concept that's why
[46:47] I encourage you to be reading the books
[46:49] listening to the tapes scrolling through
[46:50] the ebooks of this message whatever
[46:51] format you have feed on it and you'll be
[46:54] getting there before I get there because
[46:55] that's where I get my inspiration
[46:58] now he does not say here as he did to
[46:59] the church in Perkins you hold my faith
[47:01] he's not talking about his faith now but
[47:04] he's commending them for their
[47:05] faithfulness
[47:07] now could we look at it this way that we
[47:09] know God knew their faith but he's not
[47:11] commending them for Faith unseen but
[47:14] it's an outward expression of their
[47:16] faith that brother Brandon now refers to
[47:18] as a commending them for their
[47:20] faithfulness
[47:21] they have faith and they're faithful
[47:24] James chapter 2 verse 20 to see us thou
[47:27] how Faith wrought with his works now
[47:29] speaking about Abraham Abraham believed
[47:31] God and it was imputed to him for
[47:33] righteousness Paul in teaching on this
[47:34] says Abraham was justified by faith it
[47:37] was that which God knew he possessed
[47:39] within his soul that which Abraham
[47:41] possessed by conviction
[47:43] by trust and confidence but it wasn't
[47:45] that he had trust and confidence absent
[47:47] from any evidence
[47:49] one of the things I I
[47:52] I this uh
[47:55] faith cannot exist apart from knowledge
[47:59] right
[48:00] that Abraham and I say that that there's
[48:04] something known that causes us to love
[48:06] God that gives us this faith and it
[48:08] cannot exist apart from knowledge and
[48:10] then knowledge cannot exist separate
[48:13] from action
[48:14] love cannot accept exist separate
[48:17] separate from function faith cannot
[48:19] exist separate from actions so Abraham
[48:22] believed God and he was justified by his
[48:24] faith but true knowledge must impose
[48:27] itself or have an influence on the
[48:29] knower so the very proof in one sense
[48:31] that Abraham believed God is in what he
[48:34] did
[48:36] and there's if I could back up about
[48:38] faith cannot exist without knowledge but
[48:40] there is no amount of knowledge that it
[48:42] can ever make Faith unnecessary
[48:47] and now you have something to think
[48:48] about for lunch
[48:50] some of you just waiting to get there
[48:52] and you've already called ubereats
[48:54] or you don't call them you text them I
[48:56] think
[48:57] so now Abraham
[48:59] worked his faith wrought his manifested
[49:02] and brought it out and his faith reached
[49:03] its full and supreme expression when he
[49:05] offered Abraham excuse me he offered his
[49:06] son upon the altar says then how Faith
[49:09] wrought with his works and by works by
[49:12] his working
[49:13] Faith was made perfect
[49:17] it's another phrase
[49:18] that you have love made perfect now you
[49:21] have faith being made perfect and so if
[49:24] we back up again God sees our faith
[49:26] peers into our soul sees our faith which
[49:28] is a noun he sees that he knows it's
[49:31] there he knows that we trust him he
[49:33] knows that we love him but then
[49:34] faithfulness is demonstrated by our
[49:37] works and God can see our faith and
[49:39] justify us by faith but then if the
[49:41] outward working out of that faith that
[49:44] men see
[49:45] and we and James is looking at that
[49:47] whereby we're justified by works so his
[49:50] faith produced The Works and these Works
[49:53] expressed perfect faith
[49:57] his faith reaches full and supreme
[49:58] expression when you offer it up Isaac
[50:00] upon the altar so if we say there his
[50:03] faith was made perfect
[50:05] by works was Faith made perfect there's
[50:08] just different ways you could look at
[50:09] this
[50:10] his faith God's faith and confidence in
[50:14] Abraham
[50:15] accomplished its purpose
[50:17] he trusted Abraham he called Abraham he
[50:21] dealt with Abraham he met with Abraham
[50:23] he coached him about the promises he he
[50:25] told them what to do and his his faith
[50:28] paid off
[50:30] his faith accomplished its purpose but
[50:33] then also we could say that Abraham's
[50:36] Trust accomplished its purpose that his
[50:39] faith made was made perfect it
[50:41] accomplished something it did what it
[50:43] was supposed to do and so when he says
[50:46] that Faith was made perfect we could say
[50:48] that his faith is accomplishing what it
[50:51] set out to do and our faith is being
[50:54] perfected
[50:56] brother Branham says the sermon perfect
[50:58] Faith he says when you got Pure
[50:59] unadultered Faith Like Your Love Is to
[51:02] your companion then you prove it by the
[51:04] way you act
[51:09] if you have faith your actions will
[51:11] prove it
[51:13] and it's in the acting that faith is
[51:15] being made perfect
[51:16] faith is accomplishing something so we
[51:19] we then desire that the faith that we
[51:21] have would be perfect by doing what it's
[51:24] supposed to do
[51:26] not looking at the absence of things
[51:28] done and concluding that we don't have
[51:30] it we look at the fact that we have it
[51:32] and fill the void where it's not
[51:34] expressing it
[51:36] now some may look at that and say wow
[51:38] you're really you're treading on
[51:39] Dangerous Ground because what you really
[51:41] need to do is convict the people that
[51:43] they don't have it
[51:45] and that may be true for some
[51:47] but how awful would it be today if you
[51:50] had perfect faith and perfect love and I
[51:53] was able to manipulate the word of God
[51:55] clever enough to where you left thinking
[51:57] you didn't have it and which would be
[51:59] worse
[52:01] which would be worse
[52:03] to beat you up so bad till you leave
[52:05] doubting you have perfect love or at
[52:07] least provoking
[52:10] confidence in that which you believe you
[52:12] have
[52:16] because then once you could come to the
[52:19] place
[52:20] of Desiring to see the fruits of it in
[52:23] the absence you can always ask yourself
[52:24] Lord have I done something to where I've
[52:27] missed it
[52:28] and just get it right
[52:30] right that's the beauty of being bride
[52:32] you're never afraid to be found out
[52:33] you're wrong because that just means
[52:34] you're it's an opportunity to be right
[52:36] finally
[52:37] and if you've got Pure unadulterated
[52:39] Faith you prove it by the way you act
[52:40] and then he equivocates it to love like
[52:42] love to your companion if you love your
[52:45] companion you show it
[52:48] and so faith is believing faithfulness
[52:50] is expressing that belief
[52:53] and
[52:56] I I'll say this here and I I'll come
[52:58] back to it
[53:00] we
[53:02] God we learn of God's faith through his
[53:06] faithfulness
[53:08] right
[53:09] so God is unseen
[53:13] cannot see him no man hasn't seen God at
[53:15] any time he's unknown he's invisible
[53:17] and he is a God of all Faith the God of
[53:19] all love and that's an absolute truth
[53:22] and nothing we ever say or do can ever
[53:24] change that but then we would never know
[53:26] his faith if he wasn't faithful
[53:30] we would never know his love if he
[53:32] wasn't loving so just like God
[53:34] demonstrated his love by loving us and
[53:37] demonstrating his love by action we know
[53:39] God's faith and we know the faith of God
[53:42] through his faithfulness
[53:45] now there's a statement brother man
[53:47] makes in perfect Faith No we're just
[53:49] gonna
[53:50] use this use this phrase
[53:53] to transition towards our clothes here
[53:56] and maybe just get a little bit of
[53:57] momentum to swing Us swing us to a close
[53:59] he says we are to have perfect faith in
[54:02] this perfect word
[54:05] so as we recognize without perfect love
[54:08] we cannot be there and we realized the
[54:10] challenge in the mark of this age is
[54:12] perfection and we are to have perfect
[54:14] faith in his perfect word and that's a
[54:17] challenge to us and I would say if
[54:19] you're not challenged by it maybe you're
[54:20] just being dismissive of it because that
[54:21] is a challenge we're to have perfect
[54:23] faith in this perfect word not just
[54:25] faith in his word but a perfect faith in
[54:27] his perfect word now if God is requiring
[54:30] that which I believe he is because we're
[54:32] to have perfect faith in his perfect
[54:33] word I believe that God has a provided
[54:36] way to bring us to this place of perfect
[54:39] faith
[54:40] it's not something that we we leave
[54:42] church and we scramble and we go home
[54:44] and we start shifting through our house
[54:46] trying to find perfect Faith where did I
[54:48] put it where did I put I know I had it
[54:49] somewhere but God says you've got to
[54:51] have perfect faith and you say then
[54:52] you've got to give it to me
[54:55] if God ever requires something of you
[54:57] he's not shocked if he said by your
[54:59] grace
[55:00] if you'll help me get there
[55:02] right it says yielding to him if he says
[55:04] you've got to have it then you just say
[55:05] well then would you give it to me please
[55:08] and so we have to have perfect faith in
[55:10] this perfect word so then God has a way
[55:12] to bring you to perfect faith it says in
[55:15] Hebrews 12 2 looking unto Jesus the
[55:17] author
[55:18] the beginner
[55:19] the originator the Creator and the
[55:23] Perfecter The Finisher the completer of
[55:25] our faith
[55:28] not his faith not the faith but our
[55:31] faith
[55:32] and I would say no matter how you look
[55:34] at it there's a perfecting of our faith
[55:35] that is transpiring whether our faith is
[55:38] the faith or our faith is his faith or
[55:40] our faith is that Faith which we have in
[55:42] him it is being begun and it is being
[55:45] perfected
[55:48] and in John Chapter 14 verse 29 it says
[55:50] now I have told you before it come to
[55:53] pass I told you these things would
[55:54] happen before they happened that for the
[55:57] reason that when it is to come to pass
[55:59] you might believe
[56:02] so God prophesies his word beforehand
[56:04] fulfills it so that when he has
[56:07] demonstrated his word or he has
[56:09] demonstrated faithfulness it increases
[56:10] our faith
[56:11] this is a pattern I could prove
[56:13] scripture after scripture after
[56:14] scripture I told you beforehand so that
[56:16] when it happens it'll cause you to
[56:18] believe more
[56:20] I've spoken to you my word so that when
[56:22] I fulfill it it increases your faith
[56:24] he is the author and the finisher of our
[56:27] faith we know him and because we know
[56:29] him we love him and because we love him
[56:31] we trust him and this is what causes
[56:33] this love to begin with he says now that
[56:35] you love me I and now that you have
[56:38] faith in me I'm going to perfect that
[56:40] faith
[56:41] now that you love me I'm gonna perfect
[56:43] that love
[56:44] and the way that God does it is he does
[56:47] it through his word he does it through
[56:49] his faithfulness
[56:50] he does it by demonstrating his love
[56:52] towards us he does it by demonstrating
[56:54] his promised word to us in the sermon
[56:56] perfect Faith he says I know he wants to
[56:58] do something
[57:05] speaking of God I know he wants to do
[57:07] something he has been doing something
[57:09] to create this Perfection of faith in
[57:13] the people
[57:14] it's God that does it
[57:16] it's God that's creating the Perfection
[57:18] of your faith so maybe the most critical
[57:20] element of perfect love the most
[57:22] critical element of perfect faith is
[57:23] yielding to what God's doing
[57:26] he's got the blueprints
[57:28] he's got the engineering degree he's got
[57:30] the permit he's got all the materials
[57:32] and if you could just sit still long
[57:33] enough he's like listen I'll get you
[57:35] there if you'll just trust me I'll get
[57:38] you there if you just settle down long
[57:39] enough and quit running around and
[57:41] trying to do this and trying to do that
[57:42] I can do this because I am doing
[57:45] something to create this Perfection of
[57:48] faith in you
[57:50] and then brother Brandon comes to it
[57:52] about a paragraph later the word operate
[57:54] in the human flesh
[57:55] by physical science by Material Science
[57:57] by scriptural science perfectly
[58:00] to bring you a perfect faith for perfect
[58:04] rapture
[58:05] God has invested himself in the process
[58:09] of taking you from a faith to a perfect
[58:11] faith
[58:12] this is God's desire this is God's
[58:14] design this is something that is his
[58:16] faith
[58:17] that he believes your love for him he
[58:20] believes your faith for him and he's
[58:22] engaged to this process of taking Faith
[58:24] to a perfect faith and he wants to do
[58:26] something to create the Perfection of
[58:28] faith in you and the word is operating
[58:30] in you the word is operating in other
[58:32] people the word is operate in the
[58:33] message of the hour the word is
[58:34] fulfilling Prophecy in the day and age
[58:36] we're living in in order that it might
[58:38] be made known to you by Revelation in
[58:41] order to swell up a perfect faith for a
[58:43] perfect rapture
[58:45] I'll try to go quickly through these
[58:47] remaining scriptures
[58:49] first Thessalonians chapter 3 verses 9
[58:51] to 13 I believe that we could just read
[58:53] it and it'll express to you what he the
[58:55] uh the the principle of a perfecting
[58:58] Faith he says for what thanks can we
[59:00] render to God again for you for all the
[59:02] joy we're with we enjoy for your sakes
[59:04] before our God night and day praying
[59:07] exceedingly that we might see your face
[59:08] and might perfect
[59:12] that which is lacking in your faith
[59:15] this is this is the sincere desire of an
[59:17] apostle this is him saying through the
[59:18] ministering of the word of God through
[59:20] the gifts that have been placed in us I
[59:22] would like to come and Minister the word
[59:24] of God to perfect that which is lacking
[59:27] in your faith
[59:29] now God himself and our father and our
[59:30] Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto
[59:32] you and the Lord make you to increase
[59:35] and abound in love one to one another
[59:38] and toward all men even as we do toward
[59:41] you
[59:42] to the end he may establish your hearts
[59:44] unblameable in Holiness before God even
[59:47] our father at the coming of our Lord
[59:48] Jesus Christ with all his Saints
[59:51] we know that it is only
[59:53] it is only God's power that produces
[59:55] faith
[59:58] but it is also God's power to increase
[59:59] it
[1:00:01] amen they have faith and he's saying
[1:00:03] that God I like to come and Minister the
[1:00:05] word of God to you more perfectly that
[1:00:07] it might perfect that which is lacking
[1:00:09] in their faith they had received Christ
[1:00:11] they had faith yet the word of God
[1:00:14] needed to be taught
[1:00:15] that their faith could be perfected
[1:00:17] wherever it was lacking
[1:00:19] the preach of the word we know in
[1:00:20] Ephesians is for the perfecting of the
[1:00:22] Saints and and for the knowledge of
[1:00:24] Christ that we all could come into the
[1:00:26] unity of the faith and so Paul is saying
[1:00:28] I'd like to come to you in order to
[1:00:30] perfect that which is lacking in your
[1:00:32] faith the takeaway for me when I was
[1:00:34] reading this yesterday is he didn't say
[1:00:36] I'd like to come and expose all your
[1:00:39] weaknesses
[1:00:40] I'd like to come and prove to you that
[1:00:42] you guys aren't the Believers you
[1:00:44] thought they were you were preaching is
[1:00:46] never meant to take away from your faith
[1:00:48] it's always meant to perfect that which
[1:00:50] is lacking in your faith
[1:00:52] remember when we looked at the subject
[1:00:54] of who is my neighbor and how that we
[1:00:56] could all be Thieves by stealing from
[1:00:59] people and we could take things away
[1:01:01] from him and we could Rob them and leave
[1:01:02] them half naked and half Alive by the
[1:01:06] things that we robbed them of and if
[1:01:08] there's if you ever take away something
[1:01:09] from somebody be sure that you follow it
[1:01:12] up with something that's more necessary
[1:01:13] that they ought to have in its place
[1:01:15] and so the preach of the word is meant
[1:01:17] to perfect that which is lacking in our
[1:01:19] faith to renders he says that it might
[1:01:21] perfect that which is lacking to render
[1:01:23] your faith complete to fill up anything
[1:01:25] that's missing in your faith
[1:01:27] Paul is openly acknowledging that they
[1:01:30] believe and that belief is by the power
[1:01:32] of God but the same power of God desires
[1:01:35] to fill up your faith to make your faith
[1:01:37] effective and to render complete the
[1:01:39] faith that you have in him
[1:01:42] is in Mark chapter 9 verse 24 is the
[1:01:44] straight way the Father the child cried
[1:01:46] out and said with tears he said if
[1:01:47] you'll just believe your daughter will
[1:01:49] be made well he says Lord I believe I
[1:01:51] have faith help thou my unbelief
[1:01:54] what a declaration and I'm so glad that
[1:01:57] it's not met with rebuke I'm so glad
[1:01:59] that it's not like you believe help
[1:02:02] you're unbelief that's a paradox it
[1:02:04] cannot exist it cannot be true but
[1:02:06] rather it discloses how we feel
[1:02:07] sometimes we do believe we do have faith
[1:02:10] but yet maybe there's just something
[1:02:12] that's not effective something that's
[1:02:14] not working something that's not whole
[1:02:16] something that's not complete it says
[1:02:17] Lord please heal the defect that's in my
[1:02:20] faith Lord I do believe but right now
[1:02:22] I'm a little bit fearful Lord I do
[1:02:23] believe maybe I'm a little bit doubting
[1:02:25] but make that part of my faith which
[1:02:28] seems to be right now just a little bit
[1:02:29] restrained Lord Make It whole
[1:02:32] and help my unbelief
[1:02:34] he writes in second Corinthians chapter
[1:02:36] 10 verse 15 not boasting of things
[1:02:38] without our measure that is of other
[1:02:40] men's labors but having hope
[1:02:43] when your faith is increased that we
[1:02:45] shall be enlarged by you according to
[1:02:47] our rule abundantly
[1:02:51] Paul acknowledging once again
[1:02:53] that faith can be increased
[1:02:56] so when we think of perfect faith
[1:02:59] if our faith isn't perfect
[1:03:01] it's coming to it by perfect love
[1:03:05] amen that's the perfecting faith
[1:03:08] God's perfect love
[1:03:10] and God's perfect Faith are working in
[1:03:13] us to bring us to perfection
[1:03:16] God's perfect love and God's perfect
[1:03:18] Faith that's perfect that's the the
[1:03:20] perfect love the perfect faith and which
[1:03:23] we have we could say which we have in
[1:03:26] our souls
[1:03:27] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:29] but then there's our faith in our love
[1:03:32] and it's his love and his faith that's
[1:03:34] perfecting faith
[1:03:37] if my faith isn't where it needs to be
[1:03:40] God will get it there as you yield to
[1:03:42] him as you feed on his word as you
[1:03:43] believe for it as you trust him
[1:03:45] musicians feel free to come here I want
[1:03:48] to read this statement from perfect
[1:03:49] Faith he says brother Brown's talking
[1:03:50] about the end of servant I did this for
[1:03:51] a reason and I know this is a very
[1:03:53] pronounced statement to us not a faith
[1:03:55] but a perfect faith
[1:03:57] built up in here
[1:03:59] and this is notice what this faith is to
[1:04:01] watch a perfect god with the perfect
[1:04:04] heart keep a perfect Promise by his
[1:04:06] perfect word
[1:04:08] whose Perfection are you trusting in
[1:04:11] what's going to bring it to pass it's a
[1:04:14] perfect god with the perfect heart and a
[1:04:16] perfect Promise by his perfect word if
[1:04:19] there's any perfect Faith to be had it's
[1:04:21] his Perfection that is doing it
[1:04:24] what does he want to orient our eyes to
[1:04:27] he said oh God God's going to bring
[1:04:28] forth perfect faith and so you do is you
[1:04:30] just kind of look and say well do I have
[1:04:31] perfect Faith do I have perfect Faith No
[1:04:33] keep your eyes on the promise
[1:04:35] the perfect word which is sharper than a
[1:04:36] two-edged sword and a discern of the
[1:04:38] thoughts of the heart
[1:04:39] we're coming now to the Perfection we
[1:04:41] are now God's already perfect his heart
[1:04:44] is perfect his promise is perfect his
[1:04:46] love is perfect his word is perfect his
[1:04:48] faith is perfect but we're coming to the
[1:04:50] Perfection because the people have to
[1:04:53] come to this in order for the rapture
[1:04:55] so if I've got to come to it he's got to
[1:04:57] get me there so God's perfect love and
[1:04:59] God's perfect faith is going to bring me
[1:05:01] to a place of perfection
[1:05:03] he says that's what's holding it away
[1:05:05] right now
[1:05:06] waiting for that church to come into
[1:05:07] perfect raptured Faith he says looking
[1:05:10] for it if I could put it my own words
[1:05:12] I'm expecting it it's gonna happen why
[1:05:16] because this perfect level never fail
[1:05:19] God's faith is perfect
[1:05:22] and all unbelief and even our own
[1:05:25] failures and mistakes and our doubtings
[1:05:26] have never disenold God's confidence in
[1:05:28] his election in you
[1:05:30] he says it means a lot of Shaving down I
[1:05:32] think in some other translations it's a
[1:05:34] lot of shaking down for me because it
[1:05:36] means a lot for you but together we will
[1:05:40] make it by the grace of God
[1:05:43] but together
[1:05:45] together
[1:05:47] we will make it by the grace of God I
[1:05:51] believe if I could say this from the
[1:05:53] bottom of my heart this is why love is
[1:05:54] so important that it can be channeled
[1:05:56] and expressed the right way because I
[1:05:58] want the love of God shed abroad in my
[1:06:00] heart if I said that's been
[1:06:03] poured out into my spirit Lord let it be
[1:06:05] expressed to me through me
[1:06:07] that it might give others that I'm with
[1:06:09] together the confidence that will make
[1:06:12] it
[1:06:13] together we'll make it in other words I
[1:06:16] bind myself to say I'm not going to do
[1:06:19] this alone together we'll make it by the
[1:06:22] grace of God if I try to do it by myself
[1:06:24] I'll never make it if you try to do it
[1:06:26] without me you'll never make it we've
[1:06:28] got to do this together
[1:06:31] and I believe his word cries out to us
[1:06:33] that he's building up a perfect faith
[1:06:35] how am I going to get there let his
[1:06:37] perfect heart do it
[1:06:39] that is perfect word do it let his
[1:06:41] perfect promise do it
[1:06:43] if I have a faith that I believe is
[1:06:46] ineffective if I have a faith that's not
[1:06:48] being made whole I say I do have a faith
[1:06:51] but that's not just a faith it's a
[1:06:53] perfecting faith in other words it's
[1:06:55] this present state of coming into
[1:06:57] perfection
[1:06:59] brother Bradman statue of a perfect man
[1:07:01] he talks about that headstone which is
[1:07:03] love he says God is love
[1:07:05] and he's the one that controls and he
[1:07:08] says he's the strength of every one of
[1:07:10] these other virtues
[1:07:12] he which is God who is love is the
[1:07:17] strength
[1:07:19] I've been thinking about how his
[1:07:21] strength is perfect
[1:07:23] when my strength is not his love is a
[1:07:26] strength to you
[1:07:28] and it'll uphold you in your week it'll
[1:07:31] uphold you when your faith isn't strong
[1:07:32] it's there to remind you that that if I
[1:07:36] could put it in a way that it certainly
[1:07:38] seems like a paradox because our sins
[1:07:40] and iniquities he remembers no more
[1:07:42] against us but he knows your capacity to
[1:07:45] make mistakes he knows your limits he
[1:07:48] knows your weaknesses but his love
[1:07:51] there's a commitment to his love he
[1:07:53] loves you therefore he trusts you he's
[1:07:56] got confidence if I can say maybe it
[1:07:59] wasn't brother Brad I'm saying together
[1:08:00] we'll make it maybe it was God wanting
[1:08:02] to tell you that together we'll make it
[1:08:05] that I'm in this with you and in you to
[1:08:09] the end
[1:08:11] and his it's his strength this beautiful
[1:08:15] scripture in Philippians 2 13 for it is
[1:08:18] God
[1:08:20] that works in you
[1:08:22] Faith which worketh by love his faith
[1:08:24] working by his love in my soul it is him
[1:08:28] working in me both to Will
[1:08:31] and to do of his good pleasure
[1:08:38] the will is the love
[1:08:40] the will is the faith there's the noun
[1:08:43] the desire but to do
[1:08:47] is the agape
[1:08:49] the action the expression and the
[1:08:52] faithfulness it's him in you both to
[1:08:54] Will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:08:57] perfect love obtainable sayings
[1:09:01] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[1:09:03] becomes your possession
[1:09:04] and then we know and believe maybe we'll
[1:09:07] pick up on this in our future service we
[1:09:09] know that he will perfect that which
[1:09:12] concerneth me
[1:09:14] that if there's anything lacking in my
[1:09:16] faith the word will perfect it
[1:09:18] that is as my faith can grow he will
[1:09:22] increase it
[1:09:23] it's perfecting faith
[1:09:25] it's not a faith that well if you have
[1:09:27] faith it's a perfect faith if you don't
[1:09:29] have perfect Faith you need to go get
[1:09:30] Faith if you've got faith it's a
[1:09:31] perfecting Faith
[1:09:33] let's trust him for all trust him with
[1:09:36] everything that we have in us that this
[1:09:39] love that we have for him is a
[1:09:40] perfecting love
[1:09:41] that there's faith that we have in him
[1:09:43] is a perfecting Faith let's stand
