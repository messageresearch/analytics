TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I know you've heard these things before but just to bring back to our memories this morning I was thinking of a vision that brother Branham had and he related it in Paradox in December 1961 and he says this he says it was about three o'clock in the morning I had gotten up and I looked in front of me looked like I was standing on the map of Palestine he said I was coming down to the Jordan and as I drew near the river I looked back and seen which way I had come and I was two-thirds of the way there to the Jordan I want you to notice this was in 1961 when he when he relates this and he says I looked across Jordan and I said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the promised land now we know if I can just stop there for a moment and we'll continue on with the vision we know that there were three polls to brother branham's Ministry first second and third poll and so he finds himself two-thirds of the way to where he's going and he says across the Jordan on the other side is where the promises lay that that is where I'm going and I'm want to tell you today without going into it in depth but we're there we are there we are on the other side of the Jordan we're not looking for someone to come and lead us across we're not we are in the land where the promise is late he said my brother Ben this morning I'm still battling I I'm still struggling I've still got issues in my life that that need to be taken care of but the promised land was not a place of no struggle it was not a place in fact that's the place where the battle began in Heavenly places brother Branham calls it another Ephesians if you are familiar with that and also I believe it was in Paradox he deals with the with the idea of another Ephesians that there would be uh not not another Corinthians or another another Pentecostal move but there would be another uh Ephesians another another group of Believers a new group of Believers that would come up and they would actually have crossed over into the promised land and the Holy Spirit Joshua would be leading them and placing them in the word in that promise land that is where we are this morning and the great thing about that is if you're in that Promised Land This is where all the opportunities are this is where all the possibilities are this is where God has placed every door he's unlocked it and we'll talk about that some more this morning but every door that we go to is unlocked everything that we if you have a desire to overcome today you can overcome and if you have a strength in your life something that you need from God you can obtain it today if you in the promised land there's a battle there but there's Victory there that's where we're at I think sometimes we understand where we are and the message that's come to us in our day what it means to us you and some people it's like well we're just waiting I don't want to be critical this morning but people are waiting on well the next Pastor or or the next evangelist that's going to come by or some other Prophet or some other thing that's going to come we have the open book we have the word right here in front of us let's walk into it let's make Footsteps in it and and in there all things are possible so he said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay so keep that in your mind now as we go along so now he says then when I come into the vision again it seemed that I was lifted up and sitting on a narrow Highway with some brother he said I never knew who the brother was I looked around and seemed like everybody was afraid now we've known what that's like I didn't know what fear was until covet happened and everybody was afraid I'll be honest with you I was afraid what are we going to do we I began pastoring a church and but Aaron knows what that's like and just starting out and again pastoring a church and immediately coveted hit and so we had to close down and everybody had a different idea about what to do and it seemed like churches would just split in half and stuff we looked back at it now and the fear is mostly gone but the covet is still around but but a lot of a lot of the fear is gone but but what was everybody so afraid of and you begin to realize that was some people's worst fear was being caught in a group of people and and it was always my worst fear but you know but that's just that's just the way people were at being around people and and things like that and you never I never experienced such fear but now it seems like it's just getting worse and worse everybody's afraid of something it's not just covered but it seems like a nuclear war or Chinese balloons or whatever it is that's currently floating in the atmosphere they've probably been up there for years they just hadn't noticed them yet but but everybody's afraid what's going to happen nuclear war I'll tell you what's going to happen to the bride one of these days we're going to walk into our new body one of the hey man one of these days there's going to be a people who we will not all sleep but we will all be changed in the moment of twinkling of an eye so what's everybody so afraid of and we might ask ourselves that question and as we're going through this Vision now there's something that you are afraid of like would be the worst thing that you could face and that something is maybe different than what it would be for me right there's something that's the worst possibility that you begin to think about and you think well I I don't know that I could handle that maybe it's a it's a marriage problem maybe it's a a personal issue in your own in your own body in your own flesh in your own mind and you think what would I do if presented with that situation and so hold that in your mind now as we go in through this Vision he said a voice came and said there's such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you and I heard the weeds mashing down and I looked and here come A huge monster snake crawling through the woods excuse me for shouting at you I just have to preach the only way I know how you just have to deal with the backup this morning I'm sorry I apologize for brother Aaron and then he builds me up before I come up what a mess but he said I I thought knowing this is Vision I shall see what this animal or this Beast is and he crawled up on the highway and as soon as I got sight of him I knew it was a man Bob and he said Amanda is an African snake which is the most deadly bite of all things there is there's nothing as poison as a man but in the snake of course represents sin and death now I'll be honest with you all right we were in Sabino the other day we've been in Tucson and and just walking around I know the snakes aren't out yet but just walking around everything that rustles I look at it because I can't stand snakes and you can only run so fast when you're up on those trails and believe it or not I did get up there and and uh and made it down and it may be the only most exercise I've had in years and but we walked up up on top of the mountain there and as we were going along those Trails the uh the dead brush sometimes will rustle and and you look at and think my goodness what's in those what's in those holes what's in those rocks and I think it might be a snake and and yet the Mamba made one of those snakes maybe uh would be just minor compared to the bite of the African Mamba he said it's the most deadly bite of all things there is there's nothing as poison as a mom and the snake of course represents sin and death he said and here he was on the highway I thought well this is it so I looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he comes and that would be the moment there I went he said here he come he said and when he got right close to me he would run up fast and then he would get slower and slower and just quiver and stop and then something would hold him off he couldn't bite me you realize you can't leave here until until God allows it he said he has appointed bounds that we cannot pass quit living your life in fear and dread at the next moment or the the car wreck or something I know we go through traumatic things and sometimes we live in in fear that happening again but you can't live like that let God be God he can't take you till it's time and so now he said he looked angry I mean he got right up close to me but he gets slower and slower something would hold him off he couldn't bite me and he would turn around on the other side and try to approach from this side and he would get back and get a start and swish right towards me get slower and slower and slower then to a stop and then he would shake like that and move back he couldn't strike me then he turned and looked to my friend and away he went after my friend and I see my friend just jumping way in the air well that'd be me I tell you what I'm not trying to place myself in the vision but I'd have been jumping he said over him and over him and over him trying and the thing was striking at him I thought oh if it ever hits him it'll be instant death no wonder everybody is so scared and I threw my hands up and I said oh God have mercy on my brother and just then the serpent turned to me when I said that and looked at me again and a voice came from above me and said you've been given power to bind him I watch him the worst or any him the worst or any and I said well God what must I do he says there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere I said well God forgive me for my insincerity let me have sincerity if he wasn't sincere I I don't know I don't know if I even have a chance at being called sincere a prophet was a sincere worshiper a sincere preacher and yet the angel told him you must be more sincere more sincere so there must be something about this sincerity it's not just the way that we approach maybe our scripture the Bible or the way we treat people but there's a sincerity towards the word and a seriousness that comes with this now he said there was when I raised my hands up to him again there was a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like that my whole body was charged with something and I looked at the serpent he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent blew smoke flew out of me curled up and made the sign he said like a capital S made backwards I can't make a capital S backwards he said I am the fact he said and means buying this one I love it buying this one or anything below him because it's actually a very simple thought today May kind of entered in on the deep end but buying this one or anything below him because he was the worst now watch now remember you're scared of something or something in your life maybe that you struggle with or something I know people are people and I've found everywhere I go that people deal with it may be a different area different people about different backgrounds but you deal with certain things it's the culture of the world that we live in it's the nature of the flesh bodies that we're in and there's something that you'd have to deal with something that oh if that happens I don't know what I would do I don't know but I'm here to tell you there is nothing that can stand before you all the days of your life you've come you're across the Jordan you're living in that land you're living in the land of possibility you're living in the land of the open book and so there's something that has come to us this age we can realize that we can recognize this is who I am this is I'm not because that's the great fight it seems like that it's who are we going to be what are we going to be as a bride what well what are we supposed to be well we can be everything the word says we could be there could be people that go to church today and love one another and care about one another and just have a church why because the word says we could there will be ministers many may fall most might fall or get off the word but there will be somebody with Aaron somebody that'll stand for the truth somebody's going to make it that might as well be me somebody's going to make it and so we're living in that time so he said buying this one or anything below him because he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him his tail choked his own self to death around his head he said and the brother was free and just in a voice oh my so not just brother Branham but the brother was free and just then a voice came again and said you can unbind him also so I said then Satan that I might know I unbind you when it did he started coming to life again wiggling and I said I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ and when it did the smoke flew out of him again he choked himself right back again turned to Crystal and then when he did that that voice said now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this then it left me and I was standing in the room number the random continues to preach on a paradox and what it was incredible but true and then later in that message he ties the vision too our text that we read Matthew 16 19 he just says something to the effect of uh that reminds me of that vision so Jesus Jesus says that again in Matthew 18 18 he doesn't just limit that to the to Peter as the Catholic Church would have us believe but he said verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you bind on Earth whatever you loose on Earth should be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you that's powerful two of you way more than two here this morning two of you shall agree on Earth think about that in the context of a marriage as well if two of you can get come in agreement that's touching anything that they shall ask it should be done for them of My Father which is in heaven just two of you can come together and there's that power for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them and that means more than just feeling his presence although we do aren't you grateful we can feel his presence and we can we can sense that he's here brother said a man this born of God can feel the presence of God since the presence of God know that he's here but yet we we realize that that's not all there is to it where he is anything is possible huh you see why it's so important that the word would be open in our day and unveiled in our age so that it would be completely open not not just part of it because now anything is possible because this is the age where we have to take a rapture right so now we find that the scripture was was manifested quite literally in the upper room where they were in one Accord in one place if two of you agree on any one thing they become in one Accord in one place and the Holy Spirit fell and Peter took the keys from his side right he'd been given the keys remember and he took the keys from his side and he began to he began to uh man I didn't start my timer you all may be in trouble I'm not long-winded I I'm a Pruitt not a McGary foreign it's called irony I'm not good at picking up irony we have a long history with that so now this was manifesting the upper room he said Peter took the keys from his side opened the mystery of Salvation now it says when they heard this they were pricked in their heart said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do Peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now they said men and Brethren what can we do that's the question this is Brother Branham now how are we going to get to it get it who's got the keys come here Simon you got the keys now watch he's using this this this power to loose you've got the keys pull them off your side what are you going to say he said now remember Jesus Christ said if you bind it on Earth I'll bind it in heaven if you loosed it on Earth all Lucid in heaven and if he's God he has to keep his word oh I love this and he talks about the Catholic priests that Catholic priest come to him and said God is in his church but the random counters God is in his word and he goes on and he said then didn't Christ give his church the Catholic priest said didn't Christ give his church which we are his church the power to forgive sins on Earth he said he certainly did I said now if you'll forgive them the same way that they forgive them I'll go with you he said I said how'd they forgive them did they tell him go do a novena or something the way you do he said no sir Peter said repent there's the key so the key to unlock was in Peter speaking the word and when he spoke that word in due season right and the word for that hour the word of the hour it was the key that unlocked to them that what had been a mystery the mystery is the lock and the Revelation is the key and he said then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the key went click on Earth and went click in heaven and a dispensation was unlocked foreign just the power of the word if we recognize that we wouldn't want to ever miss church we wouldn't want to ever miss our prayer time our study time because you realize the power of that word that when the season comes the right time is there and you're standing there under the anointing of that word you you speak it and it unlocks now watch the key went click on earth when click in heaven he said I'll give unto you the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven whatever you bind on Earth shall be abound in heaven whatever you loose under shall be loosed in heaven notice he said Keys plural these keys were given to Peter and by extension to the church now watch God does nothing without man how many believe that today brother Brandon said he could have chose the Sun the moon the wind and I'm leaving out a lot of quotes here just to kind of move us along but brother Branham taught us that now he does nothing without a man and what that tells me is not only that they're still preachers today Ministry but that there's people right there's got to be people that speak the word of God there's got to be people that take responsibility for the word that they've been given in our day so now he says for Peter was given the key to the kingdom saying whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind it in heaven what does the key do it unlocks something the mystery and when Jesus said go baptize them in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost sitting there to Blind the unbelievers so now watch he actually spoke something in mystery form and said his father son of the Holy Ghost and then Peter takes the key and unlocks it and says that's the name or Jesus of Jesus Christ baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ it is the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost of the Lord Jesus Christ now there were mystery it was a mystery that was unlocked but we know there were some things that were left and just kind of catching us up to speed but you all know what I'm talking about some mystery is not yet unfolded in that time and so you can say well in Luther's day it was a key it was given to unlock justification and in Wesley and and Pentecost and in different ages they had a certain key to be able to unlock a certain portion but the Bible tells us in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished so now are you with me you're you're across Jordan you're in the land where all the promises are and you've walked into this say like a supermarket I don't know about you I I like your steak and I I like a Prime Steak I can't always afford a prime mistake but I like a prime mistake and when I can get one on sale I I'll buy one and and I like a Prime Steak if I'm going to eat steak I want something that's good and you can go into a grocery store and get all kinds of things and you know it seems like that some people you just bear with me this morning I feel relaxed and comfortable this morning but as we if you go into a supermarket and you just begin to pick things off the shelf it seems like that some people take the message and just begin to pick the lowest things off the lowest shelves it's not that it's not good or that you couldn't feed off of it but there's got to be some somebody going in there and getting some steak right that's the word of the hour plus and fight about a lot of things you can go in there and and pull some things off of the off of the fast food aisle or the dessert aisle and that's good but you can't live there there's got to be a point in which you go in and get something if you've got it all in front of you and we do why not go and get the good things right and there's some that go in and they tried to they tried to use it to shore up their position or build a kingdom but let me go into the room let me go in where all the promises lay let me go into the supermarket where where the prime beef is let me go in and take what what is really mine let me go in and take advantage of the good stuff that's there huh we could spend all of our again you you have a choice what you again we're in there we're there the prophet has brought us there we're there by the opening of the word by the new birth also sets us in the holy ghost sets us in Heavenly places in Christ so you can't be there you could understand God sent a prophet and not be there because you're not born again but when you come into the land when you're born again you're seated in Heavenly places in Christ now you're fighting a spiritual battle spiritual warfare Heavenly places is high places and and it's in that spiritual warfare that spiritual realm is where a battle is being fought and in that spiritual realm you have an opportunity you you can fight you can keep going you can be more sincere or you can be less right we might as well be more sincere if we're going to have church we might as well have church if we're going to live for God we might as well surrender all to him as brother Aaron already said we might as well give him everything why hold back a tenth why hold back a part why not give him everything I promised in my life let me give him all of my life let me live like a Christian should I'm in the word I'm in the land let me take advantage of that you say brother Ben I just can't do it you don't realize where you are and who you are okay so we find in the mystery of God would be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now so there was something that was unlocked in our day which was the hidden Mystery of the entire Bible right the whole book become a new book that's not just a part of certain things in the scriptures but it's all of it and we find within that is death itself right there has to be the mystery of the Rapture is in that so the Bible tells us in First Corinthians 15 25 that Christ must Reign until he put all enemies under his feet but The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death right there's going to be a people that walk into that oh my now again Jesus already he took the keys of death and hell away from away from the Satan right he kicked him back down into hell he he was the mighty conqueror but we find now it's got to come a finishing to that in our age when finally death itself is walked over right you've got to walk into that and so in verse 51 he said behold I show you a mystery here's a lock here's something here we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpets of sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed in a moment now I want to elevate our thoughts this morning you say brother Ben I'm going through something at home I'm struggling with my schoolwork I'm struggling at my job I'm struggling with some disease or something in the body but I want to elevate your thoughts for just a moment because if death is bound if death is destroyed then everything under death is also destroyed are you with me now seeing in the garden we don't have time to go into it this morning but it caused death and the only way to come out from that sin is to be born again you you can't work your way to the New Birth either you've got to be born again and it's the it's the grace of God The Sovereign Grace of God you couldn't compel yourself to be where you are you are compelled by grace to be who you are I think of the woman at the well and how brother Brandon said she had representation in heaven do you realize God moved centuries of time moved prophets to put her where she was I was preaching on Jonah here not long ago and just a little diversion and we'll get back into what we're talking about but I was preaching on Jonah here a while ago and I realized something Jonah had to go to Nineveh because if Nineveh had been destroyed then they would not have ever invaded Israel because later on they invaded Israel which didn't make sense to Jonah I'm sure why am I going to save a nation that's going to actually destroy us because there were prophecies about Nineveh that had been spoken that that they would come and destroy Israel so why go save a nation it's going to destroy you knowing they would do it so they repented they were not destroyed right away and they come back and they just they come in and and took over Israel and what they did when they come in is they actually settled parts of it they moved out some of the Israelites out of the area that was known as Samaria and they actually settled that part of Israel and it was those people that come in there you find it in First Kings where it talks about how they come in and they tried to live under the gods of their nation and it wasn't strong enough so they sent back and and the king of Assyria actually sent back in to that nation and sent made them cause teachers to come in and teach them the Jewish religion they ended up being the Samaritans now think about it for just a moment if Jonah had not done what he did read from God and ended up in a whale's belly and come out of the well so they would believe the Samaritans would have never been there because Nineveh would have been destroyed and hundreds of years later oh God you think God don't care about you because you've been through something you think God don't care he just look at my life it's messed up her life was messed up she'd had five husbands the one she was living with was not hers and she's there and she's wondering what am I doing in life what is the point maybe she thought about taking her own life and she's sitting there one day going through the daily routine she goes to the well not knowing that that was a moment that God had prepared for thousands of years because she was in his mind and he moved Kings and move profits so that she would be born you think you don't care less about you a woman who had messed up all of her life messed up everything and yet she comes to that point I don't even know why I'm dealing with this this morning it's not in my notes but she's done everything that she could do and she just messed up everything she gets to the well that morning and here's Christ he said I must I must needs go by Samaria and it was a supernatural moment and appointed time or you you know what that time is like you were there one day and he'd come by your way that wasn't in the effort that you did that was God come by your way and you don't know how many mountains he's moved so you could be here this morning so that you could sit here under the word and have a faithful pastor and live for God with all of your heart that's why he let you go through what you went through so that he could remake the clay the way he wanted it to be you don't care any less about you than he did about her what was it she had representation in heaven so do you and so he's moving mountains today a prophet didn't come for himself he said behold I send you Elijah huh let's go back to our our thought now and think about that he cares about you he puts you here for a reason and now he's destroying death for you he said we shall not all sleep we should all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead should be raised Incorruptible we shall be changed verse 53 for this corruptible must put on incorruption this Mortal must put on immortality so in this corruptable shall it put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory then if we believe the seventh Angels come and the Mysteries have been finished then the door to the Rapture was open to us and you go into the Rapture and it begins to bring it down he says the the shout was a message it wasn't what we thought but the door's been open and when the time is right we'll walk right into it you said what I'm worried I won't make it don't be afraid it's been destroyed get into the land get into the word believe the word with all of your heart huh Let It Be Your Life Death has been swallowed up in Victory right and we know the he said well my body starts death in and it will till that moment comes right but it's already it's already set in motion you're on if you went out here to a theme park somewhere and got on a roller coaster at some point you can't get off or you shouldn't right you've been strapped in and the warning lights have went off and you're already it's starting in that direction no it's not finished yet but you're on the ride listen Church we're not done yet there's still some there's still some ride left to go there may be some loops and turns and twists but we're on the ride this morning the route to The Rapture has been set in motion we can't get off don't let Satan beat you up and tell you I'm not going to make it I'm not good enough he called you here for a reason I have to settle down my Arkansas ways out here in Phoenix it just means so much to me because I know what I come out of right to be a believer I know what I've come through I know my family's trained and if death has been defeated everything under death all the family strains all the complexes all the worry all the anxiety it's all gone all I got to do is walk into that door brother Brandon said to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture he said no it is the Revelation for the Revelation is Faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so right now Faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God the church is built upon a revelation he said the whole entire body amen he said I believe that through those I was in the Rapture sermon he said I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it he said there is something we've got to step further now remember this is in the first seal he said we've got to step further we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we've got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment be swept out of this Earthly saying something's coming something's coming something's coming and then he goes back and I don't have time you all know the quotes that many of you do and and we can go back and and bring out how he said it was prophecy now it's history and it was a it was a prophecy of something coming now it's a history of something that has come and now he comes up and he says they asked him they said will there be some great Revelation that'll give us give us Faith that'll give us more faith to operate gifts and things he said no it's not like that he says it this way he said it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was that's what it was see he said it's still in the word those Thunders won't be something out here somewhere some esoteric idea that somebody has listen if somebody tells you oh I know what the seven Thunders are and I'm the only one that knows it listen God didn't give them the key alone right he gave it to the bride it's been revealed it's right there and and he says it'll be the word it won't leave the word and God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and Open the Eyes of others it'll always do that are you still with me this morning now so the Mysteries have been revealed now I know I'm keep backing up but we just we need to catch this I needed to catch this the Mysteries have been revealed the mystery is the lock the Revelation is the key and we have it all right so now again we come down to everything that we're going through everything under death and and this message will be is what is transporting us into the kingdom of life right into eternal life it's already within us then if that's the case if the Mamba has been spoken to and destroyed right if the promised land is all around us what about those little things that we're afraid of what about that you see but brother Ben I I still have that it's very real and it will be very real because you still live in a flesh body there's so many things about you don't ever forget that church the moment you get arrogant is the moment you fall and I've realized but Aaron we're not better than other men we're the same as other men Paul said this oh this wretched body that I have this flesh that I have we're no different it takes something to dominate that it takes the holy spirit in your life that can take charge of that but that's why we have to stay in church that's why we have to stay in the word that's why we have to read our Bible that's why we have to listen to our pastor why because we are flesh and so there's going to be things in that flesh that have to be you know sincerity is it speaks of of actually destroying something or killing something dying to something amen amen and this is something that that Paul said he said I died daily Jesus said If any man follow us to follow me let him take up his cross and follow me got to take up his cross he said if he doesn't do it he's not worthy of me and so there has to be a moment at which we've heard all these things we know that this is real that we're coming into it we've got a revelation of it we can walk in any door but to do that requires sincerity in our daily walk that will actually get to a point where we where we our body begins to believe that we're a Christian and our children begins to begin to believe that we're Christians our churches begin to believe that we're Christians were opening of the word is not just an idea to live life amen and it's how you treat one another and how has preachers treat one another that's right I told my church just get a little bit personal but Valentine's Day is coming up but I told my church I said don't tell me that you you love God and you hate your wife you can't do it because at some point if you hate your wife you love you don't love God can it take a little bit further if you hate anybody how can you have the love of God in your heart and hate people but you don't understand what people did but they did it in ignorance you understand what Jesus did he placed the whole world under ignorance he said father they don't know what they're doing forgive them they should have known of all the people on the Earth they should have known they should have known better well that person should have known better and that's true but Jesus Jesus had such a character about him this is the character of God that we're to have that he cried out father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and they should have known they falsely accused him he went through six trials in one day and they everywhere they found there was nothing wrong with him they had no reason to put him to death it was proved to them who he was he did Miracles and signs and wonders and they still did not believe and yet he concluded them in unbelief and Paul when he come around and persecuted Christians to come back later and he said I did it ignorantly and you remember if you go back to the Old Testament there was a there was a sacrifice for those who done it ignorantly if you did it on purpose there was no hope but if you did it ignorantly there was a sacrifice oh my do we live in we did it they did it in ignorance and so we reach a place where the opening of the word to us means we can forgive the opening of the word to us means we can love the opening of the word to us orders our families right the opening of the word for us makes us to us makes us different than the culture around us makes us love one another with brotherly love makes us different than Kingdom Builders we are not building kingdoms we're building God's Kingdom hmm my voice told brother Brandon you must be more sincere I hear that today speaking through the message to me you must be more sincere notice Joshua chapter 1. notice what the Lord tells Joshua we'll go to verse 2 Moses my servant is dead now therefore rise go over this Jordan thou and all these people into the land which had to give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness in this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage no watch what he's telling and be strong of a good courage Joshua I know you're strong but be stronger Joshua I know you have courage have good courage because you're going to need it because in the land where all the promises lay us where the battle will be fought so now he says as I was with Moses I'll be with thee be strong of encouragement unto this people shall not divide for an inheritance to lamb which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong now notice how he keeps coming back to this very courageous the dumbass observed to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left the domain is Prosper with us whoever thou goest now notice what he's telling him be sincere about it huh be sincere don't have two minds about it don't don't use it for your own purposes don't don't abuse it to abuse people with it we've seen too much of that but he said be strong with it be courageous because the land is yours now he said that must Prosper with us over thy ghost this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth Thou shalt meditate therein day and night I must observe to do all according to all that is written therein for then should thou shall make thy way prosperous then shalt thou have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou goest Joshua be sincere with what you've been given be strong be courageous and we finally when Joshua comes into the land now into the land where the promises slave he finds himself in the Battle of his life but he's a winner right he's a winner but he gets in this battle and he finds these Kings have come up against him and he's putting him putting them to the he's putting them to flight they're running away from that's the way we ought to live right now oh no what's the devil going to do to me today but every morning say what am I going to do to the devil today the devil gets nervous when I get up that's the way it ought to be it don't always feel that way but he does so Joshua gets in the Battle of his life and the enemy is running but it's almost out of time in the day and in Joshua chapter 10 and verse 12 Joshua's in there and he doesn't have time for a prayer meeting he don't have time to call Church this happened at work he's got a sword in his hand right he's slaying his enemy Joshua didn't lead from behind he was right there in the front that's the way Ministry is you're right there in front of the people and you lead it from the front you fight with them because the same battles that you fight it's the same ones we fight you think preachers don't get complexes think preachers don't get tired of course we do your pastor does too I know it seems like Superman but even Superman was a man he got in the Battle of his life the enemy's running away but the sun is going down this is a good reason he's not just wanting to part the water so we can go to Starbucks right he's not just praying Lord make life easier on me today although that might be a good thing to pray but that's not what he's praying said Lord I see enemies dying all around me I see the Enemy being defeated and I want to continue to defeat that enemy and the natural world is going to stop me the passage of time is going to stop me from doing what you promised me I could do so he just said Lord he didn't even say Lord he said Son stand still oh God now how could he do that he was in the land where the promises lay right the same place where you are you believe that this morning and he had a need of it and he said Son stand out still in that Moon Stood Still the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies and Son the son stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day there was no day like that before or after that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of the man of a man for the Lord fought for Israel foreign you had to be more sincere you can't stand there fumbling your mind and say it right you've got to be inspired to say it huh and this is where everybody is because to be honest with you there's a lot of carnality in our interpretations and and a way we would like this to work where I could just speak and everything would work right for me and I would speak and but look how it was used when the opening of this came it was a spoken word to brother Branham and the third poll how was it used squirrels a tumor the different things that were there and then what he had need of and then Hattie Wright which is the example where it was used a woman a prepared person and brother Brandon makes a statement that it was had he had to be the right kind of a person for that to take place are you still with that I'm almost closing almost closing you had to be the right kind of a person God came to her for a reason and so she was sitting there he said God come to God came to someone who would do it that way knowing that she wouldn't ask for wealth or riches but you would ask for her children and so he said you can't stumble there in your mind or fumble in your mind and say you've got to be inspired to say it notice Mark 11 23 verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith someone say he saith who is that that's us that thing that he's saying but you'll believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he's saith notice brother Brown said when you have a need when you have a need perhaps like Joshua he had a need he never thought of the circumstances and the word of God he never thought because he was he was doing what the what the angel told him be strong be courageous stay in the word and so he found himself in that position he never had another thought of the circumstances he spoke it and it was God he said Do you believe the sun Stood Still so do I how did it do it don't try to figure it out but it did it Joshua did it and raised his hands in that crucial moment he had access to God this is what I want you to understand that the opening of the word what was behind that door it was the revelation of Jesus Christ [Music] that's what the message the message is Christ it was Christ being revealed to us when you are with Christ when you are where he is anything is possible the woman with the blood issue said if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment foreign are you hearing me this morning this is where we live we have to press through but we have access we have to pray but we have access we struggle but we have access he said he raised his hands to that crucial moment he had access to God and that's what happened it was Timely who am I the spirit of the Living God has seen the need of it and pushed upon Joshua to say it yeah you can't just do it yourself but the spirit of the Living God had need of it and seen the need of it don't you see God sees your need he knows why you came here this morning he knows all about it you don't understand sometimes we're disappointed and who preached or what happened but listen I'd be disappointed too I was disappointed I had to preach this morning but listen to me God ordains these things on purpose and you don't know how many mountains he moved for us to have this service this morning you don't know how many years that's been in the war [Music] in the world oh God you don't understand we take it for granted the church that we're in the building we're standing in this beautiful building that you all have here wasn't here a few years ago you weren't here a few years ago you weren't together we take that for granted you don't know what mountains God moved take advantage of it brother said the spirit of the Living God has seen the need of it and pushed upon Joshua to say it the same God had seen the need of confirming seen the need of Abraham the same God seen the need of confirming this scripture to me that that scripture is true too he's speaking Amen to Mark 11 23 he confirmed this scripture to me that that scripture is true too the same God seen the need of those two predestinated boys you think you don't see today your children are out of the Ark of Safety maybe you're here this morning and you're bored by the service you and yet you're worried about what's going on and you wanted to get to lunch but God sees your need he's seen the need of those two predestinated boys and it was that moment he proved it and confirmed his word listen musicians go ahead and come I'm done if you made the sun stand still listen if he delivered you realize he's already delivered you from death I was dead in trespasses and sins I was all those things that Paul talked about that's what I was he said but you've been walked the water the washing of the water of the word and instead so you never did it in the first place you've been Washed by the Water of the bleeding word you stood under it you've heard it and you're standing here this morning if he saved you from spiritual death if he saved you from what you were if he saved you from yourself don't you think that the Rapture well you'll just walk into that one of these days don't be afraid of it don't worry about it if death has been destroyed everything under death is destroyed can you see that this morning the power to bind him the worst or any now think about it your head bow and your eye closed your eyes closed that has been bound [Music] if you want something from God you need to give him your whole your whole thoughts right now I need to focus on him for just a moment death has been destroyed think about the worst thing that you fear [Music] think about the cancer or the anxiety that you face every night you can't sleep maybe you thought of taking your own life because that's just the age we live in those thoughts are circulating through the air maybe you think your family doesn't love you the church doesn't love maybe this is your last service on the earth then I'll never go back to church again but God knew you would be here this morning foreign [Music] everything under death is unlocked so if I need joy in my life all I have to do is walk through that door he's given me a key how can brother Branham tell people he said go and go be happy sing a song don't worry about it don't think about it no more those people are going through real things but the door to Healing had been unlocked and he said you could you walk into it you see yourself in a new body you see yourself in a well body and you walk into it it's everything under death it's been destroyed this isn't my the prophet taught everything under death has been destroyed what about what you're dealing with right now why don't you put your feet on top of it why don't you walk through that door I'm just giving you a moment why don't you be more sincere maybe everybody there and it has a different kind of service why is he doing this something some some work day or something around the church you think well I don't know if I should be involved why don't why don't you just go the extra mile and I I thought of and just as during this moment I I preach Wednesday night in Tucson about Simon the man that was standing there just happened to be standing at an intersection when Jesus come by and the soldier looked up and said you carry his cross and that was with the moment when the body of Christ fell and all the promises that we have of a redeemer the one hanging on a cross said if I be lifted up all under all men unto me none of those promises could have been fulfilled had he remained there on the Via Dolorosa but Simon went and picked up his cross he was compelled she said to pick up his cross and carry it that changed his whole life the trajectory of his life and his family I wonder if that could be you this morning maybe this is that moment [Music] it just changed the whole tenor of your life I was standing here at an intersection and the body of Christ come by I realized there was a need Lord help me bury that cross help me to be more sincere help me to recognize how important what I do is even if I'm not a preacher or a Sunday school teacher that my place in the body let me be more sincere maybe there's someone here this morning you you see the promises of God you see they're there but you've never really walked in them like you should would you raise your hand this morning I want to pray with you God bless you God bless those hands you see it but it's just maybe you need to be born again maybe maybe you have had an experience with God but you you just haven't been able to grab a hold of it like you should you could do that this morning we're going to pray with you Heavenly Father oh God we love you today [Music] I want to tell you first how much we thank you how much we love you we realize that that's not just words but Lord it emanates from our lives we're here on a Sunday morning on what the world calls Super Bowl Sunday Lord we're here because we love you we want you to know that Lord there's some folks that maybe they've just not walked into those promises like they should I don't know what's facing them I don't know what's the struggle what mind battle today but in this land there's mind battles battles in Heavenly places but Lord would you just reach down to where they're at today Lord it may not be an emotion though it may be a sensation you can do that for us Lord but just in the in the Stillness of the moment Lord would you just speak to our hearts Lord we we surrender ourselves you can do whatever you want to do Lord we we won't hold you back from nothing Lord you can have all of our Lives all of our hearts all of our beings oh God we surrender to your will we surrender to the sovereignty that you hold over our lives we don't want to say no anymore Lord we want to say yes we want to walk in whatever it is that the word tells us to do that's what we want to do help us walk in it Lord help us Lord as Pastor so think about the Aaron here in this congregation Lord it blesses my heart so Much Heaven known him and ordered in the things and the ministry that you've given him Lord I pray you just open up the blessings from Heaven on this church or may there be so much sincerity Lord and strength we wouldn't look at what other people are doing that's not what we're here for we want to see somebody help somebody somebody encouraged so God would you encouraged brother Aaron today and his wife Lord and his children Lord I know what that's like to go to another part or another country and preach and go somewhere and pastor uproot everybody but Lord You've placed him here for a reason Lord would you just bless him Lord this church of deacons and the trustees and the people Lord Lord I may never stand in this Pulpit again I don't know but I know Lord that you appointed this moment Lord so we pray together Lord that if there's one that has not known you Lord never been baptized me but you put a desire in their heart Lord to go quickly to the water or if there's one then he's the baptism of the Holy Ghost may they receive it this morning may your will be done in every area of Our Lives we thank you for it we give you the praise and the glory and the honor for this service thank you for coming down and spending some time with us Lord we love you we thank you for it in Jesus name [Music] amen amen can we just worship him now for a moment oh God we love you just worship Him in your own way
