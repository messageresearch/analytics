[0:07] i feel happy tonight
[0:09] my family because my family is here
[0:12] misposa
[0:13] my my son and my wife
[0:18] and my mother-in-law
[0:22] also all one of my best friends are here
[0:25] emanuel pineda brother emmanuel pineda
[1:00] and speaking of behalf of my own
[1:02] experience
[1:04] of what i went through
[1:07] through my life
[1:10] of how the lord spoke to me
[1:16] many things
[1:24] i'd like you to please stand just to for
[1:26] the honor of the reading of the word
[1:32] let's open our bibles to exodus
[1:35] the third chapter verse 1.
[2:09] now moses kept the flock of jethro his
[2:12] father-in-law the priest of midian and
[2:13] he led the flock to the backside of the
[2:16] desert and came to the mount of god even
[2:18] to reb
[2:19] is
[2:30] and the angel of the lord appeared onto
[2:31] him in a flame of fire
[2:33] out of the midst of the bush and he
[2:35] looked and behold the bush burned and
[2:37] with fire and the bush was not consumed
[2:48] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[2:50] see this great site why the bush is not
[2:52] burned
[3:01] for the talk tonight
[3:30] we'll get to know each other a bit more
[3:36] how do we behave
[3:40] because each and every single one of us
[3:43] we are a result or a product
[3:47] of the environment which we were raised
[3:51] and many times we commit the error of
[3:53] the mistake
[4:22] [Music]
[4:25] i'm the youngest son of my parents
[4:30] now one of my traumas or complexes
[4:40] it really cost me a lot to speak in
[4:42] public
[4:52] one of the first traumas that i had to
[4:53] overcome
[5:08] how did he conquer you
[5:11] it's a mystery it's a mystery
[5:17] god gave me a work
[5:22] that he was helping me with my complex
[5:26] i'm a barber entonces
[5:30] so he put the people in my chair
[5:35] and i had to start learning an
[5:49] and god gave me that work and he helped
[5:51] me with that work
[6:01] i liken if you read the third second and
[6:04] third verses
[6:15] we know that god was preparing him for a
[6:17] work that was to be done but
[6:20] but moses did not know else
[6:25] that he was going to a path of a work
[6:27] that god was preparing him for
[6:37] and i believe all of us find ourselves
[6:38] in that similar situation
[6:49] i believe every single one of us can
[6:51] identify with several scriptures in the
[6:53] bible
[7:00] if you go back and read the third and
[7:01] fourth verse
[7:04] you're going to find
[7:06] moses
[7:11] started to take all of his complexes
[7:13] towards the calling of god
[7:15] no hablo bien i don't speak good
[7:18] no puedes
[7:19] for me you can't send someone else
[7:22] instead of me
[7:28] and many times as christians that
[7:30] happens
[7:31] as humans
[7:40] and many times we give that victory to
[7:42] the devil
[7:47] we're always claiming that we're
[7:48] children of the great god
[7:54] we always go with the banner of faith
[7:55] that we have a king
[8:06] then we start to take out our complexes
[8:17] we don't even give the devil an
[8:18] opportunity to come and tell us where
[8:20] we're wrong
[8:23] puerto
[8:26] because we already from the get-go we
[8:28] get rid of our we share our complexes
[8:31] just like moses
[8:37] he took out so many complexes
[8:41] that he got god mad
[8:48] and i identify myself with that
[9:03] we proclaim to have the light of this
[9:05] day
[9:18] but if we were to put the practice
[9:34] this message
[9:49] remember one occasion i went to mexico
[9:55] i was a company a minister of the church
[9:57] that i used to go to the penis
[9:59] tabernacle of the phoenix tabernacle yes
[10:05] this young lady asked advice for this
[10:07] brother
[10:08] [Music]
[10:11] like she didn't like the advice that she
[10:13] was given
[10:16] but i heard that she was asking advice
[10:17] from the brother yes
[10:27] this young lady was raised in the house
[10:29] of the message
[10:58] i don't think we should go
[11:11] you want me to answer you what you want
[11:13] to hear
[11:16] what the word of god says
[11:21] that's sometimes what the people are
[11:22] looking for
[11:25] they're looking for a minister
[11:55] applicable that i applied it to my own
[11:57] self
[11:59] what does the message say
[12:03] if you're doubting something
[12:06] get away from it
[12:22] get away from it it's that simple
[12:25] that's the powerful message that we
[12:27] believe
[12:29] that he's given us the simple things
[12:32] it's not complicated things
[12:50] i tried to make god a grandfather
[12:57] i don't know how many of you have tried
[12:58] to make god a grandfather
[13:01] we all know that god does not have
[13:03] grandchildren
[13:04] so musicos
[13:13] but how did i try to make god a
[13:14] grandfather
[13:17] through my mother
[13:57] i remember how she prayed for uh
[13:59] she raised the god through her raise up
[14:01] a dead kid that was just
[14:03] happened to pass away
[14:07] you know that that got me so damaged
[14:13] because i began to
[14:16] to depend on about the faith of my
[14:18] mother
[14:24] instead of me having a relationship with
[14:25] god
[14:26] yes
[14:29] i sort of depend more on the faith of my
[14:31] mom
[14:34] there was a time where i didn't even
[14:35] pray anymore
[14:38] i had so much confidence to do whatever
[14:40] i wanted to do purchase
[15:10] i had a sickness
[15:14] please pray for me
[15:17] we know that god does not like that
[15:22] he wants a relationship with every
[15:23] single one of us
[15:52] all of our defects
[16:00] now she already passed away 11 years ago
[16:04] hermann
[16:06] brothers
[16:13] i'm not sure what was the greatest
[16:15] impact when i heard that she passed away
[16:20] accidentally she passed away in a car
[16:23] accident
[16:31] when they told me two of the four
[16:33] passengers in the car accident passed
[16:50] it hurt me a lot
[16:52] and it keeps hurting me
[17:01] not that the pain has gone away but when
[17:02] i started to meditate said with me my
[17:05] mom my mom left
[17:07] myself for me not only did my mom leave
[17:14] my mediator between me and god has has
[17:17] left
[17:19] hermanos
[17:21] bro that was a great impact for me
[17:26] now i had to face god
[17:29] to draw an eye onto god
[17:32] render me adios to surrender to god
[17:37] to believe
[17:39] that he also hears me
[17:57] and that's the path that we've been
[17:59] following ever since
[18:04] possibly
[18:08] i don't have the faith that she once had
[18:10] or she has peros
[18:12] but i
[18:25] thanks be to god
[18:30] but i believe with all of my heart
[18:34] signs follow the believers
[18:40] we just only have to believe
[18:42] it
[18:50] you know when i was called to the
[18:51] ministry
[19:02] [Music]
[19:05] i was called to help a mission in mexico
[19:12] and my first reaction was
[19:16] i said i've never preached
[19:21] what am i going to do
[19:29] i told my pastor in that moment when he
[19:31] was sending me
[19:35] was that i've never preached nothing
[19:37] especially i have no experience
[19:41] how am i going to do this
[19:46] we're speaking on the phone
[19:51] remember he just kept a moment of
[19:52] silence
[19:54] and he said
[19:58] i'm not sending you to preach
[20:00] you know mr stoy mandando i'm only
[20:03] sending you
[20:06] to show love to the people
[20:11] and that's going to open any door
[20:15] later i understood
[20:18] more
[20:33] the complexes return
[20:39] and one of my mistakes
[20:43] are trying to be zealous to the word of
[20:44] god
[20:55] trying to get the people to do what the
[20:56] word of god says
[21:55] and the rest of it he takes care of it
[21:59] i i've noticed this
[22:02] because i had a family member
[22:05] in mexico that he's an alcoholic in
[22:07] mexico
[22:30] i'm going to tell you why it was a
[22:31] mistake
[22:34] the time went on
[22:36] when i saw
[22:43] that when he looked at me and when he
[22:44] saw me instead of approaching me he got
[22:46] away from me
[22:50] i noticed the mistake that i was doing
[22:55] because i wanted him i wanted to preach
[22:57] the word of god to him cinema without
[23:00] love
[23:03] when i understood kemi vida that my life
[23:07] habla mask
[23:08] speaks louder than words
[23:14] and i begin to accept him the way he was
[23:19] showing him my life
[23:25] the relationship changed
[23:31] and in that way
[23:34] i began to conquer him
[23:38] and then that's the way that and the
[23:39] path we're going
[23:41] son
[23:44] those are things that i've learned in
[23:45] the way
[23:48] otra kosa
[24:02] what attitude do we have
[24:08] you know i like to
[24:09] read the dictionary a lot
[24:14] [Music]
[24:18] i rejoice a lot when i when i read the
[24:20] dictionary
[24:23] because it gives me certain definitions
[24:26] it helps me understand
[24:30] the bible
[25:12] spiritual
[25:15] because that's what the prophet said
[25:22] attitude
[25:38] when i come to church
[26:08] every moment that we do says something
[26:09] about us
[26:12] in business
[26:13] and at times nosotros we commodienzia as
[26:18] an audience podemos
[26:20] we can assert
[26:22] make it more easier
[26:25] al predicador for the preacher
[26:29] el tiempo the time
[26:31] atmosphere the atmosphere or difficile
[26:34] or we can make it more difficult
[26:42] [Music]
[26:52] especially when expressing a state of
[26:54] mind
[26:58] that's something
[27:00] that i like that a lot
[27:04] of
[27:31] those are simple things
[27:36] i believe with all of my heart
[27:41] simple things
[27:45] it makes a difference in a true
[27:46] christian believer
[27:55] especially
[28:00] it says body posture especially when
[28:02] expressing a state of mind
[28:09] and that helped me to understand a lot
[28:11] of things
[28:13] that when i come to the house of the
[28:14] lord
[28:18] i even have to be careful how i sit
[28:22] because you're showing locust
[28:26] of what i'm expecting from god
[28:42] remember one thing
[28:49] remember god promised joshua
[28:53] that no one
[28:56] none of his soldiers
[29:02] but he began to lose soldiers
[29:09] now brother branham compares it to the
[29:11] church
[29:14] what is it if my attitude yes
[29:21] in the service there's no healing
[29:30] every single one of us depend on each
[29:32] other when we're here in the house of
[29:33] the lord
[29:38] because every single one of us make the
[29:40] atmosphere
[29:49] and even even thinking
[30:01] and one occasion i was in my car
[30:04] and i was thinking
[30:08] the hope and i was listening to the to
[30:10] the book of job
[30:13] and i began to laugh within myself
[30:16] cuando escuche
[30:17] when i heard
[30:21] that god
[30:22] impeso
[30:23] that he began
[30:26] diablo began to challenge the devil a
[30:29] cerca de la vida the hope concerning the
[30:32] life of job
[30:48] that you're making plans about my life
[30:50] without consulting me
[30:54] all diablo that you're sending me to the
[30:57] devil approval
[30:59] so you can try me
[31:02] si cuentos
[31:20] what would be your attitude about that
[31:28] how will we receive that
[31:35] that there were plans made about our
[31:36] life without consulting us
[31:50] even passing certain scriptures
[31:53] they say
[31:57] in segunda
[31:58] and it even says in second kings
[32:01] cinco uno five one a cerca
[32:04] general speaking of a certain general
[32:06] questini aleppra who had leprosy
[32:11] established
[32:25] with a certain attitude that they were
[32:26] going to treat him right
[32:30] to receive him correctly because of his
[32:32] post
[32:36] middleman look brothers
[32:39] i was one of those christians back then
[32:45] i was too good to be criticized
[32:50] to find all the defects in the service
[32:55] el menos but i was the least this puesto
[32:58] that was willing
[33:01] to help when it was required
[33:15] when you come seeking something here at
[33:17] church
[33:19] we're gonna find it
[33:31] what is our attitude coming
[33:47] the prophet didn't even come out to see
[33:49] him
[33:50] and
[33:53] he sent one of his servants to go tell
[33:55] him what he had to do
[33:57] he told us
[34:00] all of this it strikes me
[34:02] mismo i speak it for my own self
[34:18] what happens if one day i go see the
[34:19] pasture consider the problem with a
[34:22] certain issue
[34:24] and he has no time to come and see me
[34:28] what is my attitude
[35:32] it wasn't working out how he had it in
[35:34] his mind
[35:41] what if we apply that to every situation
[35:43] in our lives
[35:51] it doesn't go out to see the issue that
[35:52] we have
[35:54] or the deacons
[36:08] the bible says that one of his servants
[36:10] had to go out
[36:14] convince him to obey the word of god
[36:18] of what the prophet said
[36:23] and by obeying the word of the prophet
[36:26] to come to his healing
[36:31] what he wanted
[36:36] for him to come
[36:39] and the way he wanted it to come
[37:05] strike me a lot
[37:46] we know that this woman had faith
[37:53] and she wanted to touch the mantle the
[37:55] clothing of jesus christ
[37:58] and you know what's my problem um
[38:04] the offense that he gave on to her
[38:11] perro
[38:12] he called her dog
[38:16] yes
[39:12] towards the people
[39:20] you know not so long ago i found myself
[39:22] with a jehovah witness
[39:35] he wanted to argue with me with the word
[39:37] of god
[39:43] we don't want a person already arguing
[39:44] or arguing with arguing
[39:49] or with anger and arguing
[39:53] it's not worth it to speak
[39:55] no
[39:57] because no he's no longer in the
[39:59] attitude of wanting to learn you have
[40:00] plenty i've learned questions
[40:09] we can make that person sin against god
[40:15] so this person told me
[40:18] says do you believe in jesus
[40:23] i turned around as jehovah witness
[40:25] accident asking me that
[40:29] leo
[40:34] i said knowing you i didn't believe that
[40:35] you guys believed in the new testament
[40:38] no see my jose crema testament so yeah
[40:40] yeah yes we believe in the new testament
[40:49] he says and what name do you baptize
[40:54] i said
[40:57] christopher the name of jesus christ
[41:02] says you're a catholic
[41:30] [Music]
[41:34] what name do you baptize in the number
[41:37] of padres
[41:38] and holy ghosts
[41:43] don't matter we're catholic brethren
[41:56] it was a catholic church he started
[41:57] baptizing in the name of jesus christ
[42:02] i said no i said it even better if you
[42:04] find alien in la biblia someone in the
[42:06] bible
[42:08] but in the bible
[42:10] in la reina valera in the king james
[42:14] i
[42:26] i'll give you an opportunity to baptize
[42:28] me in that manner
[42:32] no he says no
[42:34] no
[42:36] no
[42:38] no no no no they say this is just saying
[42:41] no no no
[42:45] what do we say when paul says there's
[42:46] only one baptism
[42:48] unsolved
[42:49] one spirit yes
[42:53] and one body
[42:56] because
[43:08] and i'm sure he was already screaming
[43:22] if you think i'm here mistaken
[43:34] and if i believe that you're mistaken
[43:38] i'm going
[44:02] regardless you pray for me please
[44:19] i started to think senor gracias i said
[44:22] thank you lord you lost
[44:24] victoria i felt it as a victory
[44:27] because i didn't fell into the
[44:28] provocation
[44:32] maybe we would have fought in a
[44:33] theological battle
[44:45] for me my day wasn't that bad
[45:02] he's also
[45:17] but if you know how to deal with the
[45:18] client
[45:21] elba
[45:22] is going to feel que nostamando poder
[45:24] sobreus that he's not taking power over
[45:27] you
[45:29] yes
[45:31] the same thing in the spiritual
[45:34] in cada cosa que pasamos and everything
[45:37] that we go through
[45:40] remember one thing
[45:42] that anger is
[45:57] when we get angry
[46:04] because we're entering in a very
[46:05] delicate atmosphere
[46:10] remember one thing
[46:28] we can make more damage
[46:34] with any other weapon we have in our
[46:36] hands
[46:50] i'd like to thank our brother for
[46:51] allowing us to speak and to share
[46:53] this evening
[46:58] testimonial it's a bit of my testimony
[47:04] me truly
[47:07] las
[47:08] cosas i like to take things to the most
[47:11] simplest way i can
[47:15] use
[47:16] this is why the message came
[47:20] to bring it to the simple
[47:45] albert einstein
[47:50] the the
[47:52] atomic you can explain to the
[47:55] atomic theory
[47:59] but he couldn't write a phone number
[48:01] down
[48:15] maybe we can explain all the mysteries
[48:17] in the bible
[48:32] and that is
[48:35] the difference what makes the difference
[48:38] has el mundo towards the world
[48:41] to the outside
[48:44] and there we go and brother branham says
[48:54] [Music]
[48:59] this is very easy to come and testify
[49:00] here at church
[49:09] where there's no light
[49:27] the message be certain of god
[49:39] what we need today is not an abundance
[49:41] of material things
[49:45] we already have that no necesitamos
[49:47] iglesias grandes we don't need large
[49:49] churches
[49:51] congregations
[49:52] we don't need bigger congregations not
[49:56] television we don't necessarily more on
[49:58] the radio or on television no
[50:00] necesitamos tantas de estas cosas we
[50:02] don't need so many more of these things
[50:04] but
[50:05] necessitate but what we need today
[50:07] spiritualis to be spiritual
[50:10] persona is a person
[50:14] who will humble himself before god
[50:19] even if he's penniless
[50:25] and pray until that spirit within
[50:28] este
[50:30] is satisfied with the goodness of god
[50:36] and a revival takes place placed inside
[50:39] of your heart
[50:42] that changes your attitudes
[50:46] in the atmosphere in which that person
[50:48] lives
[50:50] [Music]
[51:04] to heavenly places
[51:06] yes
[51:20] [Music]
[51:47] weakest link
[51:49] [Music]
[52:11] [Music]
[52:31] [Music]
[52:41] [Music]
[52:43] you took them out of schools
[52:46] you took him out of the of congress
[52:49] [Music]
[52:51] you took him out of his own house
[52:54] you ran him out
[52:58] and now you want god to come and fix
[53:00] everything
[53:02] god is a gentleman
[53:03] [Music]
[53:05] he is where you allow him to be
[53:07] [Music]
[53:10] i believe that with all of my heart
