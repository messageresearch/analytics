[0:00] 2 Corinthians chapter 3:18. If you don't
[0:03] mind, brother John, I want to give my
[0:05] title slide. Sometimes when I give my
[0:06] title, I I jump into my first verse very
[0:09] quick. So, we'll give you the title here
[0:11] real quick, but it's sunlit vessels.
[0:14] Spelled sun correctly because I'm just
[0:16] doing a play on sunlight, but this is
[0:18] sunlit as if in Christ, the son of God,
[0:20] has lit us, but sunlit vessels. 2
[0:24] Corinthians chapter 3 verse 18. But we
[0:28] all with open face beholding as in a
[0:31] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[0:33] into the same image from glory to glory
[0:36] even as by the spirit of the Lord. What
[0:40] a beautiful picture that's painted
[0:42] through these words. We with clear clear
[0:44] face nothing in the way looking into a
[0:47] mirror. We see God's glory and we're
[0:50] changed into that same glory glory by
[0:52] glory by the spirit of the Lord. You can
[0:55] be seated
[0:57] again. We'll give you the title sunlit
[0:59] vessels. And in this, we're wanting to
[1:02] look at some of these things that uh
[1:04] Paul is using to express this beautiful
[1:07] type of uh looking into a mirror and
[1:10] being uh turning into Christ's glory.
[1:13] So, there's a lot of things we can
[1:14] explore in this. If you could look at
[1:16] Matthew chapter 17, I'd like to read a
[1:18] couple verses there. This is so we could
[1:20] kind of gather the momentum from the
[1:22] last few services. And Jesus in verse
[1:24] one after six days he takes Peter, James
[1:27] and John his brother and bringeth them
[1:28] up into a high mountain apart and was
[1:31] transfigured before them. And his face
[1:34] did shine as the sun. This is that uh
[1:37] brilliant beauty of Christ. His face
[1:39] shines as the sun. His face didn't turn
[1:41] into an orb of lava. Um but it's just
[1:44] describes this brightness that his
[1:46] countenance had that would have
[1:48] distinguished him from just uh carnal
[1:50] flesh or you know unearly uh things. He
[1:54] still retained that image but it was
[1:56] this beauty and his reignment was white
[1:57] as the light. So his face shining as the
[2:00] sun. You'll find it even in other places
[2:02] where this is described. It's this it's
[2:04] a brilliance or radiance. And we
[2:07] mentioned on Sunday that it's kind of
[2:10] like this unveiled glory. It's not
[2:13] concealed. They looked at Jesus said,
[2:14] "Oh, you're a man of sorrows and you're
[2:17] uh you're weak and you're stooped and
[2:18] you're older or you you look you look uh
[2:21] fleshly and tired or haggarded." But now
[2:23] uh it's not hidden anymore. It's this
[2:25] unconcealed glory, this unrivaled
[2:27] beauty. And it was meant to set him
[2:30] apart, to distinguish him. And so the
[2:33] scriptures speak of the light of one's
[2:35] countenance. We use some of those
[2:37] scriptures on Sunday. And it's a symbol
[2:39] of one's identity, who they are. Someone
[2:41] told me uh mentioned how that one is not
[2:44] identified by their sneakers and they
[2:46] said but some people are identified by
[2:48] their sneakers and if you are identified
[2:50] solely by your sneakers then somebody
[2:52] can very easily impersonate you
[2:56] and and so there's something about
[2:58] facial recognition. It's not sneaker
[3:00] recognition but they can distinguish uh
[3:03] between twins and even among triplets
[3:05] and different things by facial features.
[3:08] Uh and it's wonderful how that we are
[3:09] participating in gathering these
[3:11] extensive databases of our facial
[3:14] features and even the maps of our homes,
[3:17] you know, because you get that smart
[3:18] vacuum and everyone they know every nook
[3:20] and cranny and your face and everything.
[3:22] They're mapping us out. It's the mark of
[3:24] the beast. No. Um but there's a a
[3:28] person's face. It's their it's their
[3:30] identity. It's their presence. It's
[3:32] their character. There's so much that's
[3:33] meant here. So it says his face did
[3:35] shine as the sun. This is a tremendous
[3:37] shining forth. And in verse 5, as Peter
[3:41] says, "Oh, this is wonderful. Let's
[3:42] build three tabernacles equally. One for
[3:45] Elijah, one for Moses, one for Jesus."
[3:47] God speaks from a bright cloud. It says,
[3:49] "A bright cloud overshadowed them. And
[3:51] behold, a voice out of the cloud." This
[3:53] is the light of a cloud. This is the
[3:55] brilliant shining light from this bright
[3:57] cloud which says, "This is my beloved
[3:59] son in whom I'm well pleased." I love
[4:02] how Brother Brandham opens up this
[4:03] meaning. Not that I'm pleased in you,
[4:05] but I'm pleased to dwell in hear ye him.
[4:09] So this bright cloud is a symbol of
[4:11] God's presence. It identifies his grace
[4:13] or his favor. There's a lot of symbolism
[4:16] represented here. But now God gives his
[4:19] opinion because when they looked up,
[4:22] they saw Jesus only. So it's not it's
[4:25] not Moses and Elijah on equal footing
[4:27] with Jesus Christ, but the law and the
[4:29] prophet spoke of Christ. He's fulfilling
[4:32] uh uh their hope and he's that
[4:34] satisfaction of everything the Old
[4:36] Testament pointed to. So now God gives
[4:38] his opinion. This is my beloved son.
[4:41] Hear ye him. And this scene is
[4:44] representative of the beauty of Christ
[4:46] that's revealed in the gospels. This
[4:48] bright cloud overshadows them and speaks
[4:50] out. So there's something being
[4:52] represented in this to tell us that the
[4:54] Christ that's revealed in the gospel, he
[4:56] is brilliantly beautiful.
[4:59] He he is the only one by which man can
[5:01] be saved. And so this is an unfolding
[5:05] beauty of Christ that is if you want to
[5:07] look at 2 Corinthians chapter 3 that is
[5:09] transformative uh to our own character.
[5:12] This is where I'm getting this thought
[5:13] of sunlit vessels. There's something
[5:15] transformative about this unfolding
[5:18] beauty of Christ that we're not just
[5:20] witnessing something brilliant or
[5:21] something bright. We're kind of
[5:22] shielding our eyes and we can't see when
[5:24] we look up, but it changes us on the
[5:26] inside.
[5:28] In 2 Corinthians 3:18, it says, "But we
[5:31] all with open face, beholding as in a
[5:34] glass the glory of the Lord." And it's
[5:36] it's not that we're looking at him in a
[5:38] bottle, right? It's the mirror. It's
[5:40] something reflective with open face.
[5:42] Nothing uh uh nothing that's covering us
[5:45] or nothing filtered keeping it from us
[5:47] seeing him. Are changed when we receive
[5:50] him openly. were changed into the same
[5:53] image from glory to glory even as by the
[5:56] spirit of the Lord. So by beholding
[5:58] God's glory, the Holy Spirit changes our
[6:02] character into Christ's image.
[6:05] And I know I I I was thinking a lot
[6:07] about this today that the things I have
[6:09] in front of me, I have the scriptures in
[6:11] front of me. I have the teaching of the
[6:12] message in my heart. I have the quotes
[6:14] that I've read and everything. And so
[6:16] what I'm reading may sound like just
[6:18] reading scripture, uh, Bible studying
[6:20] these things, but we really got to start
[6:22] making pra practical application for
[6:24] yourself to say, "All right, well then
[6:26] how is it that I see God in a mirror?"
[6:30] And brother Brandham said that when we
[6:31] he was quoting Jesus or God saying,
[6:33] "Child of mine, when you look into this
[6:35] Bible, you're looking at me face to
[6:37] face." Amen.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; And so the dynamic of reading the Bible
[6:40] is the process of looking into the
[6:42] character of God, the identity of God,
[6:45] and how that God's presence isn't uh
[6:48] merely physical worship, but it's
[6:50] seeking his it's seeking his will, his
[6:53] presence, his word to know his will and
[6:55] then submit to it.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; And so there's this uh transformative
[7:00] experience where you're looking into the
[7:02] word of God and it's being revealed to
[7:04] you. And as it's being revealed to you,
[7:05] it's changing something inside of you.
[7:07] It's actually changing your character.
[7:10] Now, if you'll look at verse three of
[7:12] this same chapter, I'd like to give a
[7:14] background of what he says with open
[7:17] face, beholding the L glory of the Lord.
[7:19] We're changed. And this is what it's
[7:21] built upon. And he says, he says, I
[7:23] don't need letters of recommendation. He
[7:25] says, because you are my letters of
[7:27] recommendation. For he says, "For as
[7:28] much as ye are manifestly declared to be
[7:30] the epistle of Christ, ministered by us,
[7:33] written not with ink, but with the
[7:34] spirit of the living God." So now you
[7:36] can see how we're kind of backfilling
[7:38] what he says. As by the spirit of the
[7:40] Lord, we're changed into the glory of
[7:42] God. You are declared, you are the
[7:44] manifested declaration of Christ,
[7:48] &gt;&gt; not written word, but living word,
[7:50] ministered by the prophet. And he says,
[7:53] which is written by the spirit of God,
[7:54] not in tables of stones. We get these
[7:56] ideas of the tablets or the law, but in
[7:59] the fleshly tables of your heart. The
[8:00] word is written in your heart.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; And such trust have we through Christ to
[8:04] God word. Not that we are sufficient to
[8:06] think anything as of ourselves, but our
[8:09] sufficiency is of God.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; We also who also hath made us able
[8:13] ministers of the New Testament, not of
[8:16] the letter, but of the spirit. For the
[8:17] letter kleth, but the spirit giveth
[8:19] life. Now catch this. But if the
[8:21] ministration of death written and
[8:23] engraved in stones was glorious, what is
[8:25] hearkening back to? The tablets,
[8:28] &gt;&gt; the stone tablets wherein the law was
[8:30] given. If that was glorious,
[8:33] &gt;&gt; so that the children of Israel could not
[8:34] steadfastly behold the face of Moses for
[8:36] the glory of his countenance which glory
[8:38] was to be done away. We're going to stop
[8:40] because he's saying he's kind of this
[8:41] presupposition. If that was glorious. So
[8:44] he's leading to something. And what is
[8:47] he referring to? He's talking about the
[8:48] word engraved in your heart, not stone,
[8:50] but in your heart. So if the word is now
[8:53] uh written in your heart and the way
[8:56] that you're living is declaring that
[8:57] word because you're manifestally
[8:59] declared to be the gospel of Christ
[9:02] &gt;&gt; written uh by the spirit of living God
[9:04] on the tables of your heart. He says if
[9:07] the ministry which is results in death
[9:10] engraved in tablets was glorious so
[9:13] glorious that the children of Israel
[9:15] couldn't look on the face of Moses and
[9:17] that glory was done away and we're
[9:20] stopping and let's look at Exodus
[9:22] chapter 34 to see this example
[9:25] verses 29 to35
[9:28] now we're going to take a look at this
[9:29] example
[9:31] uh of Moses that Paul is referring to
[9:33] and it came to pass when Moses came down
[9:35] from Mount Si
[9:36] with the two tables of testimony in
[9:38] Moses's hand when he came down from the
[9:41] mount that Moses wised not that the skin
[9:44] of his face shone while he talked with
[9:46] him. There's he there's even an unknown
[9:50] glory that he doesn't realize just how
[9:52] transformative this has been this this
[9:55] time in God's presence. And when Aaron
[9:56] and all the children children of Israel
[9:58] saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face
[10:00] shone and they were afraid to come nigh
[10:03] him. Now that is quite a skin care
[10:06] routine.
[10:07] Whatever he did on the mountain that
[10:09] day. I wonder if it was charcoal. I
[10:10] wonder what he was able to do and what
[10:12] kind of essential oils he used there.
[10:15] Start an essential oil company. Mount
[10:16] Sinai oils. And he his face is just
[10:21] glowing and radiant so much that they
[10:23] couldn't look. They felt this is I I
[10:26] this is it's unworldly. This is
[10:29] something different.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Moses called unto them, and
[10:32] Aaron, and all the rulers in the
[10:33] congregation returned unto him. Moses
[10:35] talked with them. And afterward all the
[10:36] children of Israel came nigh and gave
[10:39] and he gave them in commandment all that
[10:41] the Lord had spoken with him in Mount Si
[10:44] until Moses had done speaking with them.
[10:46] He put a veil on his face. So what he's
[10:49] been doing this whole time is his face
[10:51] is shining so much from this audience
[10:54] with God that in order to be able to
[10:56] communicate with the people, he had to
[10:57] veil his face.
[10:59] Notice this. But when Moses went in
[11:01] before the Lord to speak with him, he
[11:03] took the veil off
[11:05] &gt;&gt; until he came out.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Isn't this beautiful? He when he goes in
[11:09] before the Lord, he's unveiled.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; There's nothing hid, nothing between my
[11:13] Lord and my Savior. And so he's un he
[11:15] has a no veil between. So the IMPACT OF
[11:18] GOD'S presence I it may be I I want to
[11:22] say in type but this is a literal uh
[11:25] influence upon Moses that as he talks TO
[11:27] GOD HIS FACE now is absorbing this glory
[11:31] &gt;&gt; and so he takes the veil off when he
[11:33] talks to God but when Moses went in
[11:35] before the Lord he takes the veil off
[11:36] and when he came out to speak to the
[11:37] children of Israel that which he was
[11:39] commanded verse 35 and the children of
[11:41] Israel saw the face of Moses that the
[11:43] skin of Moses's face shone and Moses put
[11:45] the veil upon his face again until he in
[11:47] to speak with him.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; This is this brilliant effect of
[11:52] communing with God.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; This is the effect of God's presence,
[11:58] the visible evidence of God's presence
[12:02] which was renewed each time Moses talked
[12:04] to God.
[12:06] He would come out of it being in the
[12:09] presence of God and his face would just
[12:10] radiate. It would just shine. It would
[12:12] be glowing. So he'd have to hide. He'd
[12:14] have to cover veil his face. But then
[12:16] when he would uh through this process of
[12:18] time, maybe that glory fades and maybe
[12:20] there's a uh some days go by just
[12:22] hypothesizing here. BUT WHEN HE WOULD GO
[12:25] TO GO BACK INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE
[12:26] LORD, that veil would come off and it
[12:27] would renew that glory.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; And so this is the this is what Paul is
[12:33] referring to that whenever Moses went
[12:35] into the presence of God unveiled, it
[12:37] changed his face. But when Moses the
[12:39] lawgiver came out, he veiled his face so
[12:42] that the glory was not seen externally.
[12:45] So he says that if this ministration of
[12:47] death verse 7 2 Corinthians 3:7 is uh
[12:50] written in stones was glorious the
[12:52] children of Israel could not even look
[12:53] at the face of Moses for his the glory
[12:55] of his countenance which glory was to be
[12:57] done away verse 8 how shall not the
[12:59] ministration of the spirit be rather
[13:01] glorious
[13:03] &gt;&gt; IF IF THIS if it had this kind of effect
[13:06] under the law which was the ministry of
[13:08] death
[13:09] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we have that department
[13:10] in our government but which was the
[13:13] ministry of death then There IS HE SAYS,
[13:15] "WHAT ABOUT THIS MINISTRY OF THE SPIRIT?
[13:18] IF THAT was glorious, if it had this
[13:20] effect on A NATURAL PROPHET IN HIS
[13:22] NATURAL FACE, WHAT ABOUT THE GLORY OF
[13:23] this ministry?
[13:24] &gt;&gt; For if the ministration of condemnation
[13:26] be glory, much more doth the
[13:29] ministration of righteousness exceed in
[13:31] glory.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; For even that which was made glorious
[13:35] had no glory in this respect, by reason
[13:37] of the glory that excelth. For if that
[13:39] which is done away was glorious, much
[13:41] more that which remainth is glorious."
[13:44] Seeing then that we have such hope, we
[13:46] use great plainness of speech. Now, this
[13:48] is important because Paul is saying,
[13:49] "I'm not going to hide anything. I'm not
[13:50] twisting anything. I'm not being cute
[13:52] with this. I'm going to tell it like it
[13:54] is." He says, "And not as Moses which
[13:56] put a veil over his face." That the
[13:58] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[14:00] look to the end of that which was
[14:02] abolished. So Paul is saying, "I'm not
[14:04] veiling anything. I'm not speaking
[14:06] through a muffler. I'm not trying to
[14:08] deaden my words." But Moses spoke with
[14:10] the veil over his face to the children
[14:12] of Israel. And that was the ministry of
[14:14] condemnation and the ministration of
[14:16] death. And he says, "But their minds
[14:18] were blinded for until this day remainth
[14:20] the same veil untaken away in the
[14:22] reading of the Old Testament." SO THIS
[14:24] VEIL THAT PAUL that Paul refers to over
[14:27] Moses, he's now using it as a type of
[14:29] veil that Christ remains veiled to
[14:32] Israel to this day. When they read the
[14:35] law of Moses, they don't see Christ
[14:36] fulfilling that. The veil is upon their
[14:38] heart. Yeah.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Verse 16. Nevertheless, when it shall
[14:41] turn to the Lord, the veil shall be
[14:43] taken away.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; The the the dynamics of this veil, it's
[14:47] kind of bleeds through from the thought
[14:49] on a filter and those obstructions and
[14:51] things that get in the way. The veil
[14:53] keeps Israel from seeing God's glory in
[14:55] Christ.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Why can't they see him? There's a veil
[14:59] &gt;&gt; that if the veil could be taken away, if
[15:01] God could remove that veil, they would
[15:03] see the glory. So as Moses veiled
[15:06] himself to speak to Israel when he came
[15:08] off Mount Si in type there's still this
[15:10] veil over the eyes of Israel when they
[15:12] read the law they CAN'T SEE CHRIST IN
[15:15] THE word
[15:18] &gt;&gt; and he's saying if Moses
[15:22] communing with God
[15:24] would produce this vis visible effect on
[15:27] him to where even naturally his face
[15:30] would shine and it would have to be
[15:31] veiled for the sake of the children of
[15:32] Israel that he spoke to. He's saying,
[15:34] "What about the glory of the gospel of
[15:36] Christ?" That's what I pose to you
[15:38] tonight. What about the glory of the
[15:40] word of God?
[15:42] What kind of impact does this word have
[15:44] upon us?
[15:46] Verse 17,
[15:48] the veil shall be taken away. It's going
[15:51] to turn to the Lord. You'll be able to
[15:53] see him. Now, the Lord is that spirit.
[15:56] And where the spirit of the Lord, there
[15:57] is liberty.
[15:58] One of the things that we've ministered
[16:00] on over the past year, last year a
[16:02] little bit on in the dealing with the
[16:04] house of the Lord and when the younganss
[16:05] don't grow up and and true liberty and
[16:07] imperfect liberty, a lot of those themes
[16:09] that we visited last year, there is a
[16:11] definition of liberty that is no more
[16:13] than come as you are, stay as you are,
[16:15] do as you want, be what you want.
[16:17] There's liberty.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; We're free. and that this liberty it has
[16:22] more to do with how one conducts
[16:23] themselves in church than it does with
[16:26] the reality of what the scriptur is
[16:27] pointing to. Because think of what he
[16:29] just said. He's talking about the glory
[16:31] of the gospel
[16:32] &gt;&gt; and how it cannot the glory of the law
[16:35] cannot even be compared which the law
[16:38] pertain to the flesh and all these
[16:39] elements of physical things and physical
[16:41] worship cannot be compared to the glory
[16:43] of Christ's gospel. So he says now the
[16:45] lord is that spirit when it shall turn
[16:47] to the lord the veil shall be taken
[16:49] away. The Lord is that spirit where the
[16:50] spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.
[16:53] But we all with open face beholding as
[16:56] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[16:58] changed into the same image from glory
[17:00] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[17:03] Lord.
[17:05] You catch what he's what he's outlining
[17:07] here. He's saying the veil is gone
[17:10] &gt;&gt; that we all with open face
[17:13] &gt;&gt; an unveiled glory. Liberty then is the
[17:16] removal of the veil. Yeah,
[17:18] &gt;&gt; there was there's nothing obstructing.
[17:20] Liberty is the removal of the veil.
[17:22] Allowing the light OF THE GOSPEL TO
[17:24] SHINE INTO OUR HEARTS in order to bring
[17:26] forth life
[17:28] &gt;&gt; as and we there I think it's IMPORTANT
[17:30] FOR US TO CATCH THIS. I'm not saying
[17:31] this at all to put handcuffs on those
[17:33] who want to have more liberty in their
[17:34] worship or want to have more liberty in
[17:36] certain things in life. No, THAT'S NOT
[17:37] IT AT ALL. HAVE THAT liberty as long as
[17:39] the ultimate liberty of the veil being
[17:42] removed and allowing Christ to SHINE
[17:44] INTO YOUR HEARTS HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.
[17:47] AMEN. AMEN.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; People take democracy too far to where
[17:50] it starts to uh erode others rights and
[17:53] they brother Brandham even tying back to
[17:55] some of the the early writers on liberty
[17:58] say well democracy is like a ship
[17:59] without an anchor. Uh uh all wind, all
[18:03] sails, no anchor. What's what's going to
[18:05] stop? It's people's rights and people's
[18:06] choice and people's vote and individual
[18:08] liberties. At what point DO YOU STOP?
[18:10] BUT THAT'S NOT THE THE prism through
[18:12] which we're viewing these scriptures.
[18:14] The liberty is the veil has been taken
[18:16] off the word to be able to look into the
[18:18] word and be deeply impacted by it, to be
[18:21] changed by it.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Not by church and not by uh uh
[18:26] denominations and organizations, not by
[18:28] order of man or traditions, but by
[18:30] Christ the word. Liberty is the removal
[18:33] of the veil.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; In second Peter chapter 1 19, we have
[18:37] also a more sure word of prophecy.
[18:39] Peter's actually referring to this
[18:41] experience on Mount Transfiguration that
[18:43] spoke from the cloud and identified
[18:45] Jesus Christ as the son of God. We have
[18:47] a fulfilled word, a more sure word of
[18:49] prophecy. Whereinto ye do well that you
[18:52] take heed.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Take heed to what? This word, this
[18:56] living word, this vindicated word, as a
[18:58] light, as unto a light that shineth in a
[19:01] dark place until the day dawn and the
[19:04] day star rise in your hearts.
[19:06] The word is a light shining into
[19:08] darkness.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; That this word now that we can behold,
[19:12] we now beholding him as in a glass. He
[19:14] says we're changed. We behold the glory,
[19:16] the beauty, the radiance of God. We're
[19:19] changed. Peter uses the language here as
[19:21] a light shining in a dark place. This is
[19:24] why we don't want veils in our heart. We
[19:26] don't want curtains. We don't want doors
[19:28] that shut them out. We want that light
[19:30] to examine us.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; So where the spirit of the Lord is,
[19:35] there is liberty. That liberty is to be
[19:37] able to behold him in his word and be
[19:39] changed. Verse 18, and be changed to the
[19:41] same image from glory to glory even as
[19:42] by the spirit of the Lord. Paul
[19:44] continues to write in the next chapter,
[19:46] chapter 4, verse one. He didn't stop,
[19:48] put his pen down. Well, I don't know
[19:50] what he did necessarily. I'm not going
[19:51] to say he didn't, but I just suspect he
[19:54] didn't say chapter 4, right? This is
[19:58] just a convenient way of dividing it up.
[20:00] So he's saying, "Therefore, seeing we
[20:02] have this ministry."
[20:05] Now we all with open face, this
[20:07] ministration that is glorious, this
[20:10] turning to the Lord, seeing that we have
[20:12] this ministry as we have received, we
[20:14] faint not, but have renounced the hidden
[20:16] things of dishonesty, not walking in
[20:18] craftiness, nor handling the word of God
[20:19] deceit deceitfully, but by manifestation
[20:22] of the truth, commending ourselves to
[20:24] every man's conscience in the sight of
[20:25] God. Paul preached Christ without guile
[20:29] &gt;&gt; or selfish motives. Kept the word of God
[20:32] pure. He didn't alter it. Didn't add to
[20:33] it. Did not uh plate the listener such
[20:37] as says, "Well, I know this is I know
[20:39] this crowd wants to hear it this way."
[20:40] So, he changed it for them. He didn't
[20:42] water down the word to satisfy the
[20:44] hearer's taste. He didn't give in to the
[20:46] itchy ears.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Didn't corrupt the gospel with human
[20:49] doctrines. Didn't mix or blend it with
[20:52] philosophy.
[20:53] He didn't twist the scriptures as did
[20:55] others to serve some carnal purpose or
[20:58] his his pride or prestige. He's saying,
[21:00] "I I've renounced all those things. I'm
[21:03] not dealing with it craftly. I'm not
[21:04] handling the word dishonestly, but by
[21:07] manifesting the truth, I can stand clear
[21:09] before God is keeping the word pure." So
[21:12] he says, "I preach the gospel unmixed
[21:15] pure and I'm preaching Christ." But he
[21:18] says, "But verse three, if our gospel be
[21:20] hid, it's hid to them that are lost. I
[21:23] think this is an important scripture for
[21:25] everyone to know because often times as
[21:27] Christians and as believers when we say,
[21:29] "Well, if you don't believe this, you're
[21:31] lost." And people get all worked up as
[21:33] if they've never read their Bibles.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, YOU DO KNOW THAT
[21:38] there is a gospel that can be hid. And
[21:41] if it's hid, it's hid to them that are
[21:43] lost."
[21:45] &gt;&gt; And it's just biblical that if you don't
[21:47] see truth, if you don't see Christ, then
[21:49] you are scripturally lost. And how is
[21:52] this so? Oh, that the gospel be hid.
[21:53] It's hid to the lost. In whom the god of
[21:56] this world, in the lost, the god of this
[21:58] world, the god of this evil age, Satan,
[22:01] that dragon, that serpent, hath blinded
[22:03] the minds of them which believe not. The
[22:06] ultimate is to believe.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; They don't believe lest the light of the
[22:11] glorious gospel of Christ who is in the
[22:13] image of God should shine unto them.
[22:15] Paul is keeping with that narrative of
[22:18] light shining upon something.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; They've veiled their own eyes as it
[22:23] were. They having the veil upon their
[22:26] face. They can stand in the presence of
[22:28] God, but they've got a veil.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; So it's it's not effective upon them.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; It doesn't it they can't it can't be
[22:37] impacted the way that one can when the
[22:39] veil is removed. So the gospel's hid.
[22:41] Their minds are blinded.
[22:44] If their minds weren't blinded, if it if
[22:46] if the veil could be taken away, then
[22:48] the light of the glorious gospel who is
[22:49] the image of God could shine into them.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; As Paul said, as Peter said, as a light
[22:57] that shineth in a dark place that causes
[22:59] the the sunlight to arise in your
[23:01] hearts. This isn't working on them. In
[23:05] John 1:es 1 to 11, something in the
[23:08] beginning was the word. The word is God.
[23:11] In him was life. Verse four, and the
[23:13] life was the light of men, and the light
[23:15] shineth in darkness. And catch this. And
[23:18] the darkness comprehended it not.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; The darkness could not
[23:22] consume it, could not destroy it, could
[23:24] not cast it down. But darkness stands
[23:27] opposed to light.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; If the light that is in thee is
[23:31] darkness, then your light, your
[23:33] understanding, your conviction, your
[23:34] belief will flee from light.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WHEREAS WHAT WE OUGHT TO do is if
[23:38] there be any anything in us that's not
[23:40] pure, we want it to be examined by the
[23:42] light.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS. WHAT IS
[23:45] THIS NOT GOOD? GET rid of it.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Eleaser, when you when you said
[23:50] it a few Sundays ago or whatever it was
[23:52] that you were ministering about, the
[23:54] reason why people uh don't like the
[23:56] truth because it exposes what that what
[23:58] they love is evil. This is exactly what
[23:59] the Bible's talking about.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, I have it here in
[24:03] John 3 to read here in a moment. So it
[24:05] says the darkness comprehended it not.
[24:07] There was a man sent from God whose name
[24:09] was John. The same came for witness to
[24:11] bear witness of the light that all men
[24:13] through him might believe.
[24:16] He was not that light. John Elijah, he's
[24:19] not the light but was sent to bear
[24:21] witness of that light. That was the true
[24:23] light which lightth every man that
[24:25] cometh into the world. Remember these
[24:28] distinction of light as we were trying
[24:29] to emphasize that over and over again.
[24:31] But now this one who is light, he was in
[24:35] the world and the WORLD WAS MADE BY HIM.
[24:38] This is God revealed in his son and the
[24:41] world knew HIM NOT.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; HOW COULD THAT BE? HE'S IN HE'S MAKING
[24:47] HIMSELF KNOWN. THE SON IS DECLARING THE
[24:49] FATHER AND LIGHT IS IN THE world but the
[24:51] world doesn't know him.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Over the next couple months, people are
[24:55] going to be singing about the light of
[24:57] the world. going to be singing songs and
[24:59] hanging lights and there's going to be a
[25:00] theme on on the light of the world and
[25:03] the light of Jesus Christ and that light
[25:04] that came and even the star and all
[25:06] these different things but really did
[25:08] they really see him?
[25:10] Says he came unto his own and his own
[25:12] received him not. So the true light was
[25:14] rejected.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Paul says Israel's heart was blinded for
[25:19] our sakes.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is this true light. The light
[25:24] of the glorious gospel of Christ who is
[25:25] in the image of God shines in his word.
[25:28] John 3:16-21. For God so loved the world
[25:31] that he gave his only begotten son that
[25:33] whosoever believeth in him should not
[25:34] perish but have everlasting life. For
[25:37] God sent not his son in the world to
[25:40] condemn the world but have everlasting
[25:42] life.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; For God sent
[25:49] I think I conflated a few things there.
[25:52] Verse 17. For God sent not his son into
[25:54] the world to condemn the world, but that
[25:55] the world through him might be saved. He
[25:58] that believeth on him is not condemned.
[26:00] But he that believeth not is condemned
[26:02] already because he hath not believed in
[26:04] the name of the only begotten son of
[26:07] God.
[26:08] But what is the condemnation? If they
[26:10] don't believe, they're condemned. This
[26:11] is the condemnation that light is coming
[26:14] in the world and men love darkness
[26:16] rather than light because their deeds
[26:18] were evil.
[26:20] Why is it one would love darkness more
[26:22] than light? Because the light calls
[26:25] their deeds evil.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; This is the condemnation that light has
[26:31] come and instead of man being examined
[26:33] by the light and accepting what it
[26:35] reproves and what it corrects, they love
[26:37] they they want to remain in the darkness
[26:39] because their deeds are evil. For
[26:41] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[26:42] light, neither cometh to light, lest his
[26:44] deeds should be reproved. You ever been
[26:47] in a situation where you thought you
[26:49] might be wrong or something's not right
[26:51] and you just don't want to ask the
[26:52] question because you'd rather just kind
[26:54] of think something's wrong instead of
[26:57] proving it and verifying it. I find
[26:59] myself that way sometimes. I'd rather
[27:01] just pretend everything's okay than
[27:03] actually begin to investigate and find
[27:04] out in fact it's not.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Do I have any money in the bank? Well,
[27:08] surely they'll let me know if I don't,
[27:11] right? Just something. I'D JUST RATHER
[27:13] NOT KNOW. DON'T TELL ME. I GOT BAD NEWS.
[27:15] Don't tell me. Hey, and this is kind of
[27:17] how they're they're acting is like they
[27:19] don't come to the light lest their deeds
[27:21] be reproved. Can I can I say this to the
[27:24] Christians here tonight? Don't be afraid
[27:26] to be in the light.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE AFRAID OF FINDING OUT YOU'RE
[27:30] WRONG.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "I DON'T WANT TO BE WRONG. I
[27:33] DON'T WANT TO BE WRONG." IT IT'S OKAY TO
[27:35] FIND OUT YOU'RE WRONG. WHAT YOU don't
[27:37] want to be is is stay wrong.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; It's not that you come in the light and
[27:41] and the lights can say, "You're evil.
[27:44] You're wrong. this is horrible and
[27:46] you're lost and you can never be saved.
[27:48] And it's not going to say stay the way
[27:49] you are. You're okay. Just thanks FOR
[27:51] BEING CHECKED OUT. NO, IT'S GONNA GIVE
[27:53] YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO be changed.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; But then it says everyone that in verse
[27:58] 21, but he that doeth truth cometh to
[28:01] the light
[28:02] &gt;&gt; that his deeds may be made manifest that
[28:04] they were wrought in God.
[28:07] He that's come to the light,
[28:09] he's the one that is has truth revealed
[28:11] to him that his deeds may be manifest.
[28:14] So the light is what's going to produce
[28:16] not evil works, but good works.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; And in order to produce good works, you
[28:20] got to come into the light. In order to
[28:22] assue and put away evil works, you've
[28:24] got to come into the light. Amen.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "So if our gospel's hid, it's
[28:28] hid to them that are lost, whose eyes
[28:30] and minds are blinded, lest the light of
[28:32] the gospel could shine into them and
[28:34] reprove them of their evil deeds and
[28:36] lead them to good deeds." Paul in verse
[28:39] 5 now 2 Corinthians 4:5, as we're
[28:41] wanting just to continue to amplify what
[28:43] he means when we with open face behold
[28:44] him as in a glass, says, "For we preach
[28:47] not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the
[28:50] Lord, and ourselves your servants for
[28:52] Jesus's sake. For God who commanded the
[28:55] light to shine out of darkness hath
[28:58] shined in our hearts.
[29:00] Talk about it. This this is a phrase I
[29:03] believe that is uh I I'm not trying to
[29:06] just be poetic and I don't want to try
[29:07] to give weight to different things, but
[29:09] in the beginning God created the heavens
[29:11] and the earth and God said let there be
[29:14] light. John 1:1 in the beginning was the
[29:17] word and the word was with God and the
[29:18] word was God. Then to me it's like this
[29:21] verse just joins together with this as
[29:23] one of those substantial offerings. FOR
[29:26] GOD WHO COMMANDED THE LIGHT TO SHINE ON
[29:28] DARKNESS HATH SHINED IN OUR HEARTS
[29:31] &gt;&gt; JUST AS GOD SPOKE THERE IN CREATION and
[29:33] said let there BE LIGHT AND LIGHT CAME.
[29:36] HE'S SAYING THIS SAME GOD WHO SPOKE OUT
[29:39] AND COMMANDED THE LIGHT TO SHINE HATH
[29:41] SHINED. THE SAME CREATOR
[29:44] &gt;&gt; ELOHIM HE SHINED INTO OUR HEARTS. WHAT
[29:46] HAS SHINED INTO OUR HEARTS? THE LIGHT OF
[29:48] THE GLORIOUS GOSPEL OF CHRIST.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; WHY DID HE SHINE INTO OUR HEARTS? HE
[29:52] SAYS TO GIVE THE LIGHT of the knowledge
[29:54] of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[29:56] Christ.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; TO GIVE THE LIGHT OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF
[30:00] THE GLORY OF GOD IN THE FACE of Jesus
[30:02] Christ.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; God has beamed forth light
[30:07] to do what? Why? Why does the light
[30:08] shine? To illuminate his presence.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; By the face of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; The face of Jesus Christ reveals God's
[30:17] glory. He shined into our hearts to give
[30:21] us knowledge of his glory.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; And what was that light? The glorious
[30:25] gospel of Christ.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; In John 8:12, then spake Jesus again
[30:30] unto [snorts] them, saying, I am the
[30:31] light of the world. He that followeth me
[30:34] shall not walk in darkness, but shall
[30:35] have the light of life.
[30:40] 1 John 2:es 8-1
[30:43] then spake Jesus again unto them saying
[30:45] sorry again a new commandment I write
[30:47] unto you which thing is true in him and
[30:49] in you and in you because the darkness
[30:52] is passed and the true light now shineth
[30:56] praise the Lord
[30:57] &gt;&gt; the darkness is passed
[30:59] &gt;&gt; the age of the veil is passed
[31:01] &gt;&gt; the day of probing and guessing and well
[31:04] we wonder what the Messiah will look
[31:05] like and could he be this and could he
[31:07] be that this age of groping under the
[31:09] darkness of the law and the blindness of
[31:10] the prophets. THAT DAY IS PASSED, BUT
[31:12] TRUE LIGHT NOW SHINES. He that saith
[31:15] he's in the light, this is where it gets
[31:16] real practical, and hateth his brother
[31:18] is in darkness even until now. Now, why
[31:21] did John have to go ruin a good thing?
[31:23] WE WERE ALL HAVING fun here, WALKING IN
[31:26] THE LIGHT, SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIGHT,
[31:27] RIGHT? THE LIGHT IS NOW SHINING. THE
[31:30] DARKNESS HAS PASSED. AND IF YOU HATE
[31:32] YOUR BROTHER, YOU'RE STILL IN DARKNESS.
[31:33] WHAT?
[31:35] WELL, who is my brother? Right. You
[31:38] ain't my brother. That's how sometimes
[31:41] we do it. I don't have to call him
[31:42] brother because he don't believe like I
[31:43] do. Oh, okay. All right. Careful. Now,
[31:48] &gt;&gt; but if anything, you kind of begin to
[31:52] express maybe some uncertainty about
[31:55] where you stand.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; So, in order to make yourself feel like
[31:59] you're on better footing, you got to put
[32:00] somebody else down
[32:02] &gt;&gt; and say, "Hey, we shouldn't have a
[32:04] problem calling somebody brother."
[32:06] Right.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Trump, brother Musk,
[32:11] &gt;&gt; brother Biden. See there, I said it,
[32:15] &gt;&gt; brother Obama. Sister Camala. Right.
[32:18] Just say it. I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY IT.
[32:21] THEY WANT TO SAY THEY BELIEVE IN CHRIST.
[32:22] THEY WANT TO SAY THEY'RE CHRISTIANS. I
[32:23] can say brother with the hope and prayer
[32:25] that THEY COME TO KNOW CHRIST.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; I don't need to rob them of some sort of
[32:30] appellation. But instead of get and I'm
[32:32] not talking about the mountains, but if
[32:33] YOU THERE'S A POINT HERE where [snorts]
[32:36] if we hate somebody, we say WE WE HAVE
[32:39] AUGHT or hatred. He's saying, man, are
[32:42] you really walking in the light? Because
[32:43] that's not what the light produces.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; He says in verse 10, he that loveth his
[32:49] brother abideth in the light.
[32:52] The true light is now shining.
[32:54] Therefore, we should abide in the light,
[32:57] and there is none occasion of stumbling
[32:59] in him.
[33:00] When we abide in the light, we remove
[33:03] obstacles are being removed.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; And he repeats it again in verse 11. But
[33:06] he that hateth his brother is in
[33:07] darkness and walketh in darkness. Who
[33:11] here has brothers?
[33:14] Oh boy, look at this front row.
[33:17] If you hate your brother,
[33:20] says you're in darkness, walks in
[33:22] darkness and knoweth not where you go
[33:24] because the darkness hath blinded his
[33:27] eyes.
[33:29] This is quite a challenge to me. This is
[33:32] where it gets practical where it's like,
[33:33] well, there's this practical impact of
[33:35] the gospel shining
[33:38] that in the presence of God, I couldn't
[33:40] stand there in the pre with a brother in
[33:41] the presence of God and condemn him.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; There's something about when we get into
[33:46] the shadows and the gray areas and the
[33:48] murky areas, that's when we can be
[33:49] suspicious. That's when we can begin to
[33:51] question. THAT'S WHEN WE CAN have the
[33:53] wrong kind of attitude towards one
[33:54] another. truly in THE PRESENCE OF GOD,
[33:57] WE COULDN'T POINT OUR FINGER AT ANYBODY.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; SO, he's highlighting something here in
[34:01] the midst OF ALL THIS THAT THE DARKNESS
[34:03] HAS PASSED. THE TRUE LIGHT IS SHINING.
[34:04] And if YOU'RE IN THAT LIGHT, IT HAS THIS
[34:06] EFFECT OF KEEPING US HUMBLE.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Has this effect of maybe seeing enough
[34:11] of our own flaws and what God needs to
[34:12] do on us to where we don't have to be
[34:14] nitpicky ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE. I'M NOT
[34:16] GOING TO WORRY ABOUT THAT little sliver
[34:18] in your eye cuz I'm working on this 2x4
[34:20] over here and I need to TAKE CARE OF
[34:21] THIS FIRST. AMEN.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE PRACTICAL IMPACT OF THE GOSPEL
[34:25] THAT THE more that you read it, the more
[34:27] you're in God's presence, it'll change
[34:29] your opinion of other people.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Not that you can pray enough to WHERE
[34:33] ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW WHAT WAS ONCE WRONG
[34:34] IS RIGHT AND WHAT SOMEONE ELSE was doing
[34:36] was evil BEFORE IS NOW OKAY. NO, BUT IT
[34:38] CHANGES YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE
[34:40] PERSON. You cannot get close to God and
[34:42] love evil. You cannot GET CLOSE TO GOD
[34:44] AND LOVE SIN. YOU CANNOT FALL IN LOVE
[34:46] WITH THE TRUTH AND BEGIN TO SPEAK LIES
[34:48] AND TELL LIES AND LOVE LIES. BUT YOU CAN
[34:51] HAVE A HEART FOR THOSE WHO DON'T know
[34:53] truth.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Those who are also blinded.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; And so now
[35:01] just come to the the this verse that
[35:04] we've been trying to lead up to here.
[35:08] We all with open face beholding as in a
[35:10] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[35:11] into the same image from glory to glory
[35:13] even as by the spirit of the Lord.
[35:16] Therefore, seeing we have this ministry
[35:18] and he's he he be begins to go on this
[35:21] ministry that we have that the gospel
[35:24] it's preached in its clarity. The gospel
[35:26] is preached. If it's hid to anybody,
[35:27] it's hid to those that are lost. But to
[35:30] those who receive the light of the
[35:31] glorious gospel, they receive this image
[35:34] of God shining unto them. This is that
[35:37] uh the the beholding him as in a glass.
[35:40] God commanding the light to shine out of
[35:43] darkness has shined Christ into our
[35:45] hearts to give the light of the
[35:47] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[35:48] face of Jesus Christ. And he says in
[35:51] verse 7, "But we have this treasure and
[35:53] earth and vessels."
[35:56] The I think him saying, "But we have
[35:58] this sounds as if it's
[36:02] uh uh you know an opposition to verse
[36:05] six, but really it's clarification that
[36:07] the gospel's hid to them that are lost."
[36:10] So the light of God's gospel hasn't
[36:11] shined into them,
[36:13] &gt;&gt; but we
[36:15] but we have this treasure in earthn
[36:18] vessels
[36:23] that the excellency of the power may be
[36:25] of God and not of us.
[36:28] [clears throat]
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Treasure here refers to things laid up
[36:31] in a treasury.
[36:34] So think of that. We have this treasure
[36:37] in earthn vessels. So if the treasure is
[36:41] the thing that's laid up in a treasury,
[36:44] there is a treasure
[36:46] in treasures.
[36:49] This treasure. So we are the treasures.
[36:52] You are a treasure filled with this
[36:54] treasure. The divine light of the gospel
[36:57] in what? Ordinary common vessels of
[37:00] clay.
[37:03] So that the excellency of the power may
[37:04] be of God and not of us. So that the
[37:06] greatness of his power may be shown to
[37:08] be God and not ourselves.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; This is God, not flesh. THIS IS GOD, NOT
[37:13] TRADITION. THIS IS GOD, NOT MAN.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; And you are I want you to I want you to
[37:18] really think about this and I I know
[37:20] that sounds like a Bible study where
[37:21] maybe it has like Sunday school
[37:22] principles, but you can make this
[37:25] applicable. You are a treasure in that
[37:27] you are a treasury holding this
[37:31] treasure.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; A treasure is a place where goods are
[37:36] stored, where precious things are
[37:38] collective and l collected and laid up.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; You may look like an ordinary human
[37:42] being. YOU MAY LOOK UH MUCH LIKE THOSE
[37:45] THAT ARE LOST
[37:46] &gt;&gt; to whom the gospel is hid. You might
[37:49] look like just a regular vessel of clay,
[37:51] but inside is the sunlight.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[37:56] INSIDE OF THAT IS THIS GLORIOUS TREASURE
[37:59] BECAUSE GOD WHO CA COMMANDED THE LIGHT
[38:01] TO SHINE
[38:03] HAS NOW SHINED INTO YOUR HEART. SO WHAT
[38:05] IS HE LIT up you?
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; There's not a there's not a pillar of
[38:11] fire following us that everybody says
[38:12] like we some uh first person shooter
[38:15] game where there's just this thing
[38:17] hovering above us that shows that WE'RE
[38:19] ACTIVATED.
[38:21] IT'S INSIDE of us. AMEN.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S THERE DEEP INSIDE OF US. YOU ARE A
[38:25] TREASURE FILLED WITH THE SUNLIGHT.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; We'll invite the musicians to come.
[38:36] But we'll read verse Romans. Let's look
[38:38] at Romans chapter 9 18
[38:42] uh to 23.
[38:44] We'll just stop at verse 23.
[38:50] To those who've been born again, you
[38:52] have a treasure in your flesh.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Continue to read there in chapter four
[38:59] because he says, "We made we're we're
[39:01] we're these earthn vessels. We live just
[39:03] like clay pots." Brother Victor, Lord
[39:05] willing, over the next five service or
[39:07] four services. So, I'm going to be
[39:08] preaching about pottery.
[39:10] It's an art. It's an art form. It's a
[39:12] beautiful uh work of art. You talk about
[39:16] somebody who's going to take the clay of
[39:17] the earth and form something that's in
[39:20] the image of God.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; And as I've been studying these
[39:23] principles and looking at them, I felt
[39:26] this would just be a great place to
[39:27] blend this in that you are clay that God
[39:30] is molding that God is making. And not
[39:33] to be a vessel that's just full up of a
[39:35] lot of worldly things or inside this
[39:38] house of clay is uh is um organs and
[39:42] blood cells and nerve endings and those
[39:43] things. But no, in you is light
[39:46] &gt;&gt; cuz he has shined in you to light you
[39:48] up.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; You may look like just some sort of
[39:51] ordinary vessel, but you carry the light
[39:52] of God's word.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 9 verse 18, therefore
[39:57] hath he mercy on whom he will have
[39:59] mercy, and whom he will he whom he will
[40:02] hardeneth.
[40:06] Thou wilt say then unto me, why do he
[40:08] yet find fault? For who hath resisted
[40:11] his will? Nay, but oh man, who art thou
[40:13] that repliest against God? And he's
[40:14] going to pull from Isaiah here. Shall
[40:17] the thing formed say to him that formed
[40:19] it, why hast thou made me thus?
[40:22] And he says, "Hath not the potter power
[40:24] over the clay? Of the same lump to make
[40:28] one vessel under honor, and another
[40:30] under dishonor?" What if God, willing to
[40:32] show his wrath to make his power known,
[40:35] endured with much longsuffering the
[40:36] vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?
[40:39] and that he might make known the riches
[40:42] of his glory on the vessels of mercy
[40:44] which he had before prepared unto
[40:47] [music] glory.
[40:50] You're a merc you're a vessel upon which
[40:52] he's had mercy. You're vessels of mercy.
[40:54] You're characterized. God has put his
[40:57] stamp on you, his mark. You're a vessel
[40:58] of mercy. And he hasn't just made you a
[41:01] vessel to set you on a shelf, but he's
[41:03] made you a vessel prepared unto glory to
[41:06] be a vessel full of glory.
[41:09] It empowers us then as just regular
[41:12] ordinary human beings who are born like
[41:15] ANYBODY ELSE, RAISED MUCH LIKE ANYBODY
[41:17] ELSE, eat food, require clothing, all
[41:19] the other natural amenities. BUT REALIZE
[41:21] INSIDE OF YOU IS AN UNRIVALED GLORY
[41:25] TRULY INSIDE OF THE BELIEVER'S POWER TO
[41:27] CREATE A WORLD AND GO LIVE ON IT.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; AND THAT THE way that this is going to
[41:31] be activated, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT PRAYING
[41:33] AND READING YOUR BIBLE, HEARING THE WORD
[41:35] OF GOD, SEEKING HIS FACE, COMING TO KNOW
[41:37] HIM BETTER. IT'S WHAT ACTIVATES THIS
[41:39] glory
[41:41] &gt;&gt; so that it can be seen on you.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; We don't want to hide it under a bushel.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; We don't want to keep covering up. We
[41:49] say, "Lord, I believe that you have
[41:51] quickened inside of me life. The light
[41:53] is shining to produce the life that
[41:55] Lord, LET ME SHINE AS did Moses shine.
[41:58] LET IT NOT BE VEILED. May your glory be
[42:00] revealed.
[42:02] And may your LIGHT JUST RE SHINE INTO
[42:04] ME, BREAKING UP ANYTHING THAT'S HARD,
[42:06] LORD. UNCOVERING ANYTHING THAT'S NOT
[42:08] pure
[42:09] &gt;&gt; that I could be a vessel of mercy, an
[42:11] honorable vessel.
[42:14] And then recognizing that if you are
[42:17] clay, he's the one forming you.
[42:21] He's the one making you so that you
[42:24] could be sunlit vessels.
[42:27] Not just the the light of life that
[42:29] pertains to humanity, but the light of
[42:32] Jesus Christ living in you. Embrace the
[42:34] calling to be a luminary. embrace the
[42:36] calling to be a light bear. There's
[42:37] nobody else that has it in this age.
[42:40] Brother Benham talked about seeing u uh
[42:42] the darkness of Leodysa and he SAYS IT'S
[42:44] BLACKED OUT. THE SPIRITUAL REALM IS
[42:47] BLACKED OUT. BUT HE SAID EVERY ONCE IN A
[42:48] WHILE THERE'S LITTLE FLASHES of light.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, who's that?" It's the
[42:53] believer.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; And I think he uses the phrase at your
[42:56] table today. IN OTHER WORDS, THAT'S YOUR
[42:57] CALLING TODAY. YOU ARE CALLED TO BE
[42:59] LIGHT BEARS. WELL, HOW HOW IS IT I COULD
[43:02] BE LIGHT? IT'S THE WAY THAT YOU LIVE.
[43:04] That's right.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; It's the way you respond to situations.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH YOU HAVE
[43:10] TO DO LIKE MOSES DID. MOSES WENT AND
[43:12] COMMUNED WITH GOD AND BEING IN HIS
[43:14] PRESENCE TRANSFORMED HIS COUNTENANCE.
[43:16] And therefore, WE MUST WALK CLOSE TO
[43:17] GOD.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; We must be walking CLOSE TO GOD. WE MUST
[43:20] FIND WAYS TO BE FEEDING OUR OUR SPIRITS
[43:22] AS CHRISTIANS SO THAT HIS GLORY CAN BE
[43:24] SEEN ON US.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Now granted, there might be a lot of
[43:28] them THAT DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; COVER UP THAT HOLINESS.
[43:32] you Bible thumper, right? There may be a
[43:34] LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE IT, BUT
[43:36] YOU'VE GOT TO BE A WITNESS.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; We must give light.
[43:42] And you're called to express Christ.
[43:43] You're It's your duty to be the light in
[43:45] darkness.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; So, oh, it's dark. It's dark. It's dark.
[43:49] IT'S DARK. IT'S DARK. Be the light.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; I want to be the light.
[43:53] I've noticed this um I didn't notice it
[43:55] maybe to this last year or two, maybe
[43:57] just maybe last year that uh I'll get an
[44:00] email from one of those companies that
[44:02] um I signed up and gave them my whole
[44:04] life's history in order to get 2% off
[44:07] on orders between $8 and $12
[44:10] and and [music] then they email you for
[44:12] the rest of your life. I've noticed
[44:13] recently that I'm getting these emails.
[44:14] It's like, "Mother's Day is coming up.
[44:16] If this email will trigger you, opt out
[44:18] of Mother's Day's emails." And I'm like,
[44:19] "Too late." Right? And there and there's
[44:23] all sorts of these things that this this
[44:25] is triggering. This is going to be
[44:26] triggering. It's family. They recognize
[44:28] it's family time. So you can start
[44:29] getting all these emails right now
[44:30] saying with Thanksgiving and Christmas,
[44:32] if any of these things create bad
[44:33] memories for you, opt out. I'm opting in
[44:36] this year.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; I'm opting in. In other words, if you're
[44:40] worried about the darkness of fa FAMILY
[44:43] GATHERINGS, BE THE LIGHT.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Be the change.
[44:48] Just as a family, we're having
[44:49] discussions lately and maybe things can
[44:51] tend to get uh uh go a different
[44:53] direction because you have you're
[44:55] comfortable with one another AND IT'S A
[44:56] SAFE PLACE AND there might be CERTAIN
[44:57] DYNAMICS YOU HAVE. YOU'RE WELL THAT MAY
[44:59] not be healthy in the long run to always
[45:01] argue over certain POINTS AND SO YOU
[45:03] WANT TO ADAPT. YOU WANT TO CHANGE AND WE
[45:06] CAN BE THE LIGHT
[45:08] &gt;&gt; IN SO MANY different situations and so
[45:10] many different outcomes we can change.
[45:13] We can be difference makers.
[45:16] So, I know it's not a not a pep talk.
[45:18] I've just buried my soul tonight that
[45:20] you are a vessel of mercy. [music] So,
[45:23] you can show it, you can live it, you
[45:25] can express it, and it can be very, very
[45:27] applicable tonight. It may not seem like
[45:29] it's applicable in terms of me giving
[45:31] you real nuts and bolts, but let me just
[45:33] say this. This is practical. Don't hate
[45:34] your brother.
[45:38] And in order to have our hearts changed
[45:40] [music] to love one another, it's going
[45:42] to take that communion with the God's
[45:44] presence like Moses did. And if [music]
[45:46] the ministration of that ministry, if
[45:48] that was glorious, how much more this
[45:50] word being revealed to your heart, how
[45:52] much more glory should it have? [music]
[45:54] Let's stand together.
[45:56] Let's pray for one another tonight.
[46:00] Knowing that without him, we're nothing.
[46:03] I cannot make myself.
[46:06] I cannot just dedicate thought to it.
[46:09] I'm I'm going to increase my stature.
[46:12] I've got to surrender to him, to his
[46:14] perfect will.
[46:16] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[46:19] And gracious heavenly father,
[46:24] Lord, tonight as we ponder your
[46:27] greatness, we [music] realize that we
[46:29] feel very small in light of it.
[46:33] But there's something about truly seeing
[46:36] your face
[46:38] in the light of Christ. It's not hatred.
[46:42] It's not judgment. [music] It's love.
[46:45] It's forgiveness. It's compassion.
[46:48] It's favor.
[46:51] Lord, under the law, no man saw you and
[46:54] lived.
[46:57] But now, Lord, to see you as life.
[47:01] And I know we use language of face and
[47:04] presence and identity and
[47:07] veils and
[47:09] and and [music] it takes maybe a very a
[47:11] theological sentiment or has some
[47:15] scriptural significance. But Lord, these
[47:17] are very real principles that you're
[47:20] real, that you're living, you're pure,
[47:23] you're holy, and you make yourself known
[47:26] by the spirit.
[47:30] This new birth which is the revelation
[47:31] of Jesus Christ personally to the
[47:33] individual
[47:35] is the light of the gospel shining into
[47:37] one soul
[47:40] and they recognize I'm a sinner.
[47:43] Forgive me in believing on you. They
[47:45] pass condemnation
[47:48] quickened to new life. They be baptized
[47:50] in the name of Jesus Christ. They're
[47:52] sealed with the Holy Ghost.
[47:55] And Lord, it
[47:57] sure would have been nice if on that day
[47:58] I was just made summed up completely
[48:01] perfect and a finished vessel. And so
[48:04] you just kind of put me over on the
[48:06] finished shelf. And I've just been kind
[48:08] of waiting now these 30 some odd years
[48:12] just waiting for the next one to come in
[48:14] and the last one to come in so that we
[48:15] can all go home. But then Lord, I
[48:17] realize
[48:19] I was filled with your goodness to
[48:21] [music] be a light
[48:23] to express you.
[48:26] Lord, there's a lot of things that get
[48:27] in the way. There's still a lot of
[48:28] veils,
[48:30] denominational veils, a lot of filters.
[48:34] Lord, I pray that you would just uproot
[48:36] them all. Lord, the complexes of our
[48:39] past, the fears we have concerning our
[48:42] future. Lord, may we not let those get
[48:45] in the way of your light.
[48:47] Lord, if there be any darkness in us, we
[48:50] come to the light.
[48:52] We come to the light that it may may be
[48:54] reproved. How else can we be the light
[48:57] that Paul talked about that would
[48:59] approve the works of God, that they're
[49:02] pure and that they're holy? How can we
[49:03] be the light in our homes if we don't
[49:06] have light inside of us? If we don't
[49:07] come to the light. Lord, I hope that I
[49:10] haven't complicated a simple subject. So
[49:13] I pray that the people's hearts are soft
[49:15] to your word, Lord, can receive this in
[49:18] a practical [music] way, in a way that
[49:20] challenges them personally where they
[49:23] can make application right now. Say,
[49:24] God, this is an answer to prayer. This
[49:26] is very specific because you could turn
[49:29] it around to address these needy things
[49:32] in our lives
[49:34] just in that right fit, that right
[49:36] application. Lord, I pray that you take
[49:37] control of it for your glory. [music]
[49:39] for each one who prays tonight. Speak to
[49:41] them, bless them, strengthen them. I ask
[49:43] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
[49:44] [music]
[49:45] Amen.
