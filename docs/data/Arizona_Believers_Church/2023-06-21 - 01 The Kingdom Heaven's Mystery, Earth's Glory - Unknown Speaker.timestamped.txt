[0:00] so if you grab your Bibles and turn to
[0:01] Matthew chapter 3 I'd like to start here
[0:04] and looking at the Kingdom so this would
[0:06] be the first the first half of the
[0:07] service looking at the Kingdom
[0:10] and there's a lot for you to chew on if
[0:12] you just Ponder the title of Heaven's
[0:14] mystery Earth's glory and I do it to be
[0:17] thought provoking hopefully even kind of
[0:19] steer you a little bit in the message to
[0:21] study some things and read different
[0:23] things it says in Matthew chapter 3
[0:26] verses one and two and those days Came
[0:28] John the Baptist so it's those days it's
[0:31] orienting us to a time it says preaching
[0:34] in the wilderness of Judea and saying
[0:36] this is his gospel repent ye for the
[0:38] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand that phrase
[0:42] at hand is it's not just imminent but
[0:45] essentially it's arrived that there it's
[0:47] got to be preparation for it because
[0:48] it's it's very if it's not here it's
[0:52] imminently close and he's preaching to
[0:54] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[0:57] hand and this phrase the Kingdom of
[0:58] Heaven is only used in The Book of
[1:00] Matthew it's not used anywhere else
[1:03] and uh they say that this particular
[1:05] gospel is really uh heavy towards it
[1:07] it's a Jewish gospel to the Jews it's
[1:10] used 35 31 different times in this
[1:12] gospel alone
[1:13] and this phrase the kingdom of heaven we
[1:15] could pull from other gospels and use
[1:17] the kingdom of God so we're not just
[1:19] trying to drill down on Kingdom of
[1:20] Heaven versus kingdom of God you'll find
[1:22] that they are related to each other
[1:24] Jesus even uses them interchangeably to
[1:26] the Rich Young Ruler I believe but to
[1:28] use this phrase to be preaching and then
[1:31] say the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[1:33] this would have significant meaning to a
[1:35] Jew and and if you just say it to a
[1:38] gentile and maybe if you said it to
[1:39] somebody who's not raised in church and
[1:41] you were said it to somebody who does is
[1:43] not familiar with the Bible and you just
[1:44] say the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[1:46] they might be thinking well what movie
[1:48] is that from and what book are you
[1:49] reading and is that is it a future
[1:51] kingdom is it sci-fi is it medieval and
[1:53] and they're thinking Kingdom and they'll
[1:55] be thinking something but uh they're
[1:57] trying to draw from some experience to
[2:00] figure out what you mean of the kingdom
[2:01] of heaven but to a Jew this would be
[2:04] significant to say the Kingdom of Heaven
[2:06] is at hand and this would be alerting
[2:07] them that the Messiah is near Messiah is
[2:10] here and so it being related to the
[2:12] Messiah they immediately start thinking
[2:14] about a lot of different scriptures and
[2:16] some of the most pronounced scriptures
[2:18] on this we can find in the Book of
[2:20] Daniel
[2:21] in Daniel chapter 2 and then also
[2:24] chapter seven but let's start in Daniel
[2:25] chapter Two and we can say that you'll
[2:27] find a lot of references to the kingdom
[2:29] as it relates to Israel or the kingdom
[2:31] of Judah so there's these natural
[2:32] kingdoms that had a natural king that's
[2:34] shown in the history of Judah the
[2:37] history of Israel or them combined as
[2:38] the Kingdom of Israel but that kind of
[2:41] just served as this placeholder for the
[2:43] time that the Messiah would come and so
[2:45] when Daniel prophesies here it's looking
[2:48] to this a permanent Kingdom to be
[2:51] established and it says in the in the
[2:53] days of these Kings and I know there's a
[2:55] lot that we're kind of skipping over but
[2:56] for brevity's sake the song service
[2:59] wasn't long enough for me to read all of
[3:00] the all of these verses here but says in
[3:03] the days of these Kings shall the god of
[3:05] Heaven set up a kingdom so the god of
[3:08] Heaven
[3:09] shall set up a kingdom which shall never
[3:12] be destroyed this would be very unique
[3:14] to the kingdoms of Judah and Israel that
[3:16] uh that had already had done were
[3:18] unfolding during this time ones that are
[3:20] set up ones that are destroyed ones that
[3:21] have an end runs whose Thrones are
[3:23] constantly changing this is going to be
[3:25] a kingdom that God Of Heaven sets up
[3:27] that will not be destroyed and the
[3:29] kingdom shall not be left to other
[3:30] people that kind of is suggesting that
[3:33] this this kingdom is going to be a
[3:34] restored Kingdom that we've always
[3:36] believed in and thought would come but
[3:38] it shall break in pieces and consume all
[3:41] these kingdoms and it shall stand
[3:43] forever so as these prophecies are going
[3:46] forth the kingdom of God or the the god
[3:49] of Heaven shall set up a kingdom that
[3:50] will never be destroyed it'll break into
[3:52] pieces all other kingdoms it shall stand
[3:55] forever so when John comes preaching
[3:58] repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[4:00] a Jew is going to think oh this is that
[4:03] permanent Kingdom this is the kingdom
[4:04] that'll break all other kingdoms and as
[4:06] we often say they might be thinking oh
[4:08] good those Romans are going to get it
[4:09] and these other kingdoms are going to
[4:11] get it but there's it's bringing up
[4:12] certain things in their mind now in
[4:15] Daniel chapter 7 read verses 13 and 14.
[4:18] he said I saw on the night visions and
[4:20] behold one like the son of man came with
[4:24] the Clouds Of Heaven now this is there's
[4:27] a lot there's a lot here that you could
[4:29] chew on one like uh the son of man came
[4:33] with clouds of Heaven there's this image
[4:35] certainly there's this image we could
[4:37] get there and then it says and came to
[4:39] the Ancient of Days so one like the son
[4:41] of man
[4:42] clothed with these clouds of heaven and
[4:44] it comes to the Ancient of Days so
[4:46] there's this image of these being
[4:48] together and it says and they brought
[4:49] him near before him
[4:51] and there was given him dominion and
[4:54] glory and a kingdom this is again this
[4:58] is identifying what the kingdom would
[5:00] mean when John comes preaching the
[5:02] Kingdom of Heaven here we see one light
[5:04] the son of man with the Clouds Of Heaven
[5:06] coming to the Ancient of Days and they
[5:09] bring him forward and they'll be given
[5:10] him dominion and glory and a kingdom
[5:13] that all people Nations and languages
[5:15] should serve him his Dominion is an
[5:18] everlasting Dominion which shall not
[5:21] pass away and his kingdom that shall not
[5:24] be destroyed this is a quite a kingdom
[5:27] this is quite a significant Reign and
[5:29] they these attributes and these
[5:31] characteristics of the one that would be
[5:33] given Dominion glory and be given the
[5:35] kingdom and whose Rule and Reign would
[5:39] reach all people Nations and languages
[5:41] it would serve all of that they would
[5:43] all serve him this is the Messiah this
[5:46] is the Messiah Kingdom this is the one
[5:47] that the Jews believe the Messiah will
[5:49] come he will fulfill chapter two he will
[5:51] fulfill chapter seven uh he will all the
[5:54] nations and Rule all the nations and
[5:56] they will allow father to this light
[5:57] into this Kingdom and it shall not be
[6:00] destroyed it shall never have an end and
[6:02] it says it shall they shall serve him
[6:04] and his Dominion is an everlasting
[6:06] dominion and then in verse 27 it
[6:09] revisits it it says the kingdom and
[6:10] Dominion
[6:11] and the kingdom and dominion and the
[6:14] greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole
[6:15] Heaven shall be given to the people of
[6:18] the Saints of the most high whose
[6:20] kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom an Old
[6:22] Dominion Shall Serve and Obey him now
[6:26] just a little bit of uh amplifying of
[6:28] this Messiah Kingdom our Messianic
[6:31] Kingdom however you'd like to say it but
[6:34] this Kingdom and dominion and the
[6:36] greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole
[6:37] heavens
[6:38] shall be given to the people of the
[6:40] Saints of the most high so this is the
[6:43] work of the Messiah to where the people
[6:44] the chosen ones the Jews those Sons and
[6:47] Daughters of Abraham they're believing
[6:48] this is our we are going to be brought
[6:51] into this Kingdom and this is going to
[6:52] be our kingdom and it's going to be
[6:53] given to us the Saints of the most high
[6:55] and it's an everlasting Kingdom and all
[6:58] other dominions and all other nations
[6:59] and this is a clear swipe at the
[7:01] Gentiles or the Heathen in their eyes
[7:03] like yeah all these reprobates and all
[7:05] these other ones that who do not know
[7:06] God and have not served God and God has
[7:09] not sent prophets to revealed himself to
[7:10] they are going to serve and Obey him in
[7:15] this Kingdom
[7:17] and so John comes preaching the Kingdom
[7:19] of Heaven is at hand these are these
[7:21] elements of the Kingdom and then in Luke
[7:24] chapter 16 verse 16 as Jesus says the
[7:27] law and the prophets were until John so
[7:30] you have the law and the prophets until
[7:32] John so John comes preaching the Kingdom
[7:35] of Heaven is at hand Jesus says the law
[7:38] and the prophets this is where until
[7:40] John and then since John comes it says
[7:44] since that time the kingdom of God is
[7:46] preached and every man presseth into it
[7:50] now this is this is maybe a I wouldn't
[7:53] say critical because I don't want you to
[7:55] get nervous if you don't know this but
[7:57] John brother I'm talking about how he
[7:59] comes and he stands there blending two
[8:01] dispensations together so John is coming
[8:04] at the end of the law and the prophets
[8:05] and he is he's he's not the Capstone to
[8:09] it he's not the summation and finality
[8:11] of it but he stands there to tie two
[8:13] dispensations together so you have the
[8:15] law and the prophets that are coming to
[8:17] an end that are going to be fulfilled in
[8:19] Christ and then you have uh so you can
[8:21] say the two dispensations are being
[8:22] blinned together of Law and Grace so he
[8:25] stands there at this Junction at the end
[8:27] of the law and Prophets and and Grace is
[8:30] going to be coming in so it says the law
[8:32] and the prophets that's ending Grace is
[8:34] beginning and at that time John is
[8:37] preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[8:38] hand
[8:39] and so the law and the prophets that's a
[8:42] specific dispensation in the Old
[8:44] Testament that's characterized by
[8:46] sending prophets it's characterized by
[8:48] the law and I would say it's
[8:49] characterized by this forward-looking
[8:52] prophecy to the Messiah coming
[8:55] and then it says since John now since
[8:57] John is preaching the Kingdom of Heaven
[9:00] is at hand and now there's a new
[9:02] covenant that's emerging if we say the
[9:04] Fulfillment of the law is at hand
[9:06] everything that the law and the prophet
[9:07] spoke to is going to be coming to pass
[9:09] and so when John so the law and the
[9:12] prophets of the Old Testament this Old
[9:16] Testament Kingdom we can say that he's
[9:18] now saying is it hand It's associated
[9:20] with this reign of the Messiah the
[9:21] coming of the Messiah so it's
[9:23] transitioning out of our hope is in the
[9:25] Messiah the hope of the Lord cometh the
[9:27] hope of heaven will come and all their
[9:29] sayings and all their songs and all
[9:31] their prophecies now John is saying
[9:32] ready yourselves because now it's coming
[9:35] and it's since John the Kingdom of
[9:38] Heaven kingdom of God is preached
[9:40] now the Bible touches on this in Hebrews
[9:42] chapter 1. verses 1 to 4 it says God who
[9:47] at sundry times and in diverse manners
[9:49] spake in time past unto the fathers by
[9:52] the prophet so the law and the prophets
[9:53] were until John even John being a
[9:56] prophet and here he's speaking to Israel
[9:58] and he's rehearsing in them of the
[10:00] Prophecies of the Messiah and there's
[10:01] one that is coming and God spoke in
[10:05] these pastimes and in different ways to
[10:08] Israel by the prophets but now notice
[10:10] this immediate change in verse 2 hath in
[10:13] these last days spoken unto us by his
[10:15] son
[10:16] so it's it's now it's not law in
[10:19] prophets now it's the prophecy that they
[10:22] pointed to now it's the son which was
[10:24] promised to come now it's not just a
[10:26] prophecy saying oh one day the Messiah
[10:28] is going to come now the son has
[10:29] revealed himself now the Messiah
[10:31] speaking so he says in these last days
[10:33] he spoke to us by his son whom he hath
[10:35] appointed arable things by whom also he
[10:38] made the worlds
[10:40] and it says who be in the brightness of
[10:42] his glory in the expressed image of his
[10:43] person and upholding All Things by the
[10:45] word of his power when he had by himself
[10:47] purged our sins set sat down on the
[10:50] right hand of the Majesty on high that
[10:54] brings in that royalty that brings in
[10:56] the image of a kingdom this is a king
[10:57] this is now a son of this this eternal
[11:01] God this one coming who is the express
[11:03] image of God and now he as he has
[11:06] conquered and he has fulfilled these
[11:07] prophecies he sets down on the right
[11:10] hand of the Majesty on high this is the
[11:13] Messiah being made so much better than
[11:15] the angels as he hath by an inheritance
[11:17] obtained a more excellent Name than they
[11:20] this is the law and the prophets are
[11:22] till John but now the kingdom of God is
[11:25] preached and God now in the kingdom of
[11:27] God is speaking by his son
[11:30] and he is and there's something that's
[11:31] being made manifest and declared
[11:34] if you look at Matthew chapter 4
[11:37] and I want you to see this because John
[11:39] is preaching for the Kingdom of Heaven
[11:41] is at hand he said well there's John
[11:43] blending these dispensations together
[11:45] John being this Forerunner this prophet
[11:48] and then it says now when Jesus had
[11:50] heard that John was cast into prison he
[11:52] departed into Galilee and that kind of
[11:54] gives us a little bit of an itinerary
[11:56] leaving Nazareth he comes to Capernaum
[11:58] which is upon the Sea Coast as he enters
[12:01] there he's fulfilling prophecy that in
[12:02] the land of Zebulon and by the coast
[12:05] about Galilee the people which sat in
[12:07] darkness saw great light and to them
[12:09] which sat in the region and the shadow
[12:10] of death light is sprung up so Jesus
[12:12] goes there not just kind of haphazardly
[12:14] or willy-nilly but this was prophesied
[12:16] so the word is govern his action he's
[12:19] coming to these regions and then it says
[12:20] in verse 17 from that time Jesus began
[12:24] to preach and to say repent
[12:26] for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[12:29] now is he just uh
[12:31] is he just repeating John at this point
[12:33] but he's saying the same thing John did
[12:35] when John says repent for the Kingdom of
[12:37] Heaven is at hand so now the Messiah is
[12:40] here so John's message is is kind of a
[12:42] forerunner of this of the message of the
[12:45] Messiah amen because he knows what's
[12:47] coming I say I I may just be building a
[12:50] platform but this is I I this is what I
[12:52] need to declare to you this is what I
[12:53] need to say he says repent for the king
[12:55] of Heaven is at hand and now as Christ
[12:57] the Messiah comes on the scene his
[13:00] message is mirrored already what had
[13:02] been foretold and he's saying repent for
[13:04] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[13:07] this is Christ now uh in fulfillment and
[13:11] satisfying John what he what John was to
[13:14] forerun he's preaching the Kingdom of
[13:17] Heaven is at hand
[13:19] so this is
[13:20] uh these are elements for you to
[13:22] consider
[13:23] when it comes to the kingdom of heaven
[13:26] now in Matthew chapter 4 verse 23 I
[13:29] guess maybe we're just skipping a little
[13:30] bit further in that
[13:31] uh in that chapter
[13:35] I think this is I I think I may just
[13:38] skip a little bit here but uh just make
[13:41] a quick emphasis it says and Jesus went
[13:43] about all Galilee teaching in their
[13:45] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[13:47] the Kingdom
[13:48] and healing all manner of sickness and
[13:51] all manner of disease among the people
[13:54] so what it's telling us he's preaching
[13:56] the gospel of the Kingdom it's not just
[13:58] about the kingdom uh the Kingdom of
[14:02] Heaven is at hand
[14:03] all right I think I hope that that means
[14:05] something to you other than just talking
[14:07] about something and being something it's
[14:10] not John's not just saying well you know
[14:12] let me tell you about this and let me
[14:13] describe this and all right let me get
[14:15] you paint a picture in your mind of
[14:17] something but it's not what it is is
[14:19] here uh what it represents what it
[14:21] stands for and what what's signified by
[14:24] scripture these things are here Jesus is
[14:26] repenting the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[14:28] hand it's here Lo the kingdom is here
[14:30] wake yourselves up and pay attention uh
[14:33] be beneficiaries of it receive it don't
[14:35] be caught in the stupid don't be caught
[14:37] in darkness light is sprung up the king
[14:39] of Heaven is at hand and it says he's
[14:41] preaching the gospel of the Kingdom
[14:43] and so it's the good news of the Kingdom
[14:46] it's the proclamation of the Kingdom so
[14:48] the kingdom is being preached there's
[14:51] something better there's something that
[14:53] should be thought of and conceptualized
[14:55] in the hearts of the Believers they hear
[14:56] that this is the kingdom Lord this is
[14:59] the kingdom the kingdom is being
[15:00] preached and it says healing all manner
[15:02] of sickness in all manner of diseases
[15:04] among the people
[15:06] brother Brown talks about the kingdom
[15:08] being ushered in the Gentile Kingdom
[15:09] being ushered out if we could use that
[15:11] as he's talking about the Gentile Church
[15:12] being I should end he talks about how
[15:14] the kingdom was ushered in by the
[15:15] supernatural he says it comes in by the
[15:17] supernatural it'll go out by the
[15:19] Supernatural and so here the kingdom
[15:22] has be is being ushered in by the
[15:25] supernatural
[15:26] and as he preaches and he declares these
[15:28] things the gospel of the Kingdom says
[15:30] he's healing all manner of sickness and
[15:31] all men are disease among the people
[15:34] and and I want to emphasize this and
[15:36] hopefully in doing so
[15:38] if I could say this hopefully it'll
[15:41] promote
[15:42] more miracles
[15:45] instead of maybe stifling it but when it
[15:47] says he's preaching the kingdom and he
[15:48] heals all manner of sickness and all
[15:50] manner of diseases these signs and
[15:51] wonders that are manifesting himself the
[15:53] kingdom is not just healing it's not
[15:56] just signs it's not just wonders but
[15:58] these were the consequences of the
[16:00] Gospel being preached and so if I could
[16:03] say and I'm careful this was evidence of
[16:06] the Kingdom this was an these were
[16:09] evidences of a greater power because
[16:11] sickness operates according to the law
[16:13] of sin and death and and there are
[16:15] certain things that doctors can diagnose
[16:17] and there's certain symptoms that one
[16:18] could see and say oh this person has
[16:20] this condition and this is a blood issue
[16:21] and this person has this disease and
[16:23] this person has leprosy and this person
[16:25] has the dropsy and all these different
[16:26] things that people could identify and
[16:28] they could treat symptoms and they may
[16:30] even know the cause and all you must
[16:31] have gotten this you must have drank
[16:32] that or been exposed to this and and
[16:35] science can start to operate in a realm
[16:37] of the law well this is what happens is
[16:39] you get this infection and this is how
[16:40] it progresses and you have to wait till
[16:42] it runs its course or this is how you
[16:43] treat it but then Jesus comes and he's
[16:46] interrupting that
[16:47] and that there's a though we see it in
[16:51] just quick glimpses in the Old Testament
[16:53] in raising the dead he's taking the Law
[16:56] of death
[16:57] and saying let me just I play the
[16:59] reverse card on that and let's raise
[17:01] them back up again and so it's not to
[17:04] say that oh that is the sum and
[17:06] substance of the Kingdom healings and
[17:08] miracles and signs and wonders but it's
[17:10] it's something that's done to show that
[17:13] the kingdom is a higher Kingdom than the
[17:15] order of men
[17:16] this this is a departure from this
[17:18] ordinary course that this is this is
[17:21] what happens to people when they get
[17:22] cancer but when Jesus comes preaching
[17:24] the kingdom is at hand and someone's
[17:26] healed of cancer is to signify that this
[17:29] is different
[17:30] than the kingdoms of this world
[17:32] if Jesus came as a great War General
[17:36] or as one who is a great debater but let
[17:40] me just or maybe lean into the thought
[17:41] of him being a warrior
[17:43] and he can learn how to he knew how to
[17:45] write a chariot he knew how to ride a
[17:46] horse and he knew how to wield a sword
[17:48] and it was just some sort of uh as we
[17:51] would see in modern day superhero where
[17:52] he could just do uh he could maybe not
[17:55] quite superhero but maybe just somebody
[17:57] that knew All the Right Moves right like
[18:00] a Kung Fu Master
[18:02] and he had this way where he could just
[18:04] uh defend himself against anything and
[18:07] he could he could just uh nobody could
[18:09] get the jump on him and so he could just
[18:12] uh he could bully the Romans
[18:14] and if Jesus had come in and by Charisma
[18:17] and by military might and training get
[18:21] together a band of soldiers and Chase
[18:23] out the Romans that Kingdom would be no
[18:25] different than the Romans who came in
[18:27] and took over that Kingdom would have
[18:29] been no different than any other kings
[18:31] and kingdoms that have toppled other
[18:32] governments is this would have been the
[18:35] ordinary course of history and Jesus
[18:37] would have been joining a long list of
[18:39] revolters and revolutions but Jesus
[18:42] comes doing something saying whoa the
[18:44] king of Heaven is at hand and diseases
[18:46] are being healed the dead are being
[18:47] raised and things are taking place to
[18:50] signify this is a different Dominion
[18:52] this is a different Power this is a
[18:55] different Authority
[18:56] brother random says this and God's power
[18:58] to transform
[19:00] and I would say in some of these sermons
[19:02] that we're reading from or really any
[19:03] one of these there's more more meat on
[19:06] these bones than I'm sharing
[19:08] and you can go back and listen to these
[19:09] he says there'll be no automobiles or
[19:11] nothing that science has ever done he's
[19:13] talking about the future in the future
[19:15] home in that Eternal Kingdom and I
[19:17] believe we read this maybe in the series
[19:19] on Divine Healing he said there'll be no
[19:21] such things in the world that is to come
[19:25] but it'll be God's Own type of
[19:27] civilization that he'll set up in the
[19:30] Glorious reign
[19:31] so God that we we look at this worldly
[19:33] civilization and what it's characterized
[19:35] Automobiles and Science and uh
[19:38] and construction and all these different
[19:41] things we had the opportunity to be in a
[19:43] high-rise that's under construction in
[19:45] downtown Vancouver and the technology
[19:47] and the science and the things they're
[19:49] able to do and and how that industry it
[19:52] works it's fascinating we are looking
[19:54] down into a four-story pit where they're
[19:57] tunneling in a subway system in downtown
[19:59] Vancouver and the roads that all these
[20:02] cars are driving on are just suspended
[20:04] in air
[20:05] I guess maybe it was a little concerned
[20:07] as the big huge sewage pipe was being
[20:09] held up by truck straps you're thinking
[20:11] this is very interesting I wouldn't want
[20:13] to be working in that pit but this is
[20:15] It's just amazing what man is
[20:17] accomplishing and what man can do but
[20:19] brother says it's not gonna be like that
[20:20] in God's civilization
[20:22] there's a lot of things we see in the
[20:24] Civil civilization we're like wow that's
[20:25] incredible but brother Branham says the
[20:28] reason why man has advanced as much as
[20:29] he has in the last hundred years is
[20:31] because he let loose his faith in God
[20:33] and has given himself over to his own
[20:34] inventions and his own wisdom and
[20:36] they've been able to accomplish
[20:38] extraordinary things that that can
[20:40] mesmerizes to this day so I try to get
[20:43] your head around modern technology I'm
[20:44] still trying to figure out how vinyl
[20:46] disc can play with music how can it do
[20:48] it how can it play it back how are
[20:51] grooves in a record disc Abel hardly
[20:54] able to put it on it and how can a
[20:55] needle play it back so I'm still stuck
[20:58] in the vinyl age
[20:59] let alone all this other stuff but
[21:01] there's the kingdom of God so far beyond
[21:04] that
[21:05] and and it's a greater power and a
[21:07] greater Authority a greater dominion and
[21:10] he's saying it in God's glorious Reign
[21:11] we won't have this he says for in this
[21:13] civilization there is sickness death
[21:15] sorrow Graves and want
[21:17] there's that neediness that lacking this
[21:20] want he says but in that Kingdom that is
[21:23] to come
[21:24] There Is No Death no sorrow no sickness
[21:27] no old age
[21:28] why does that tell us that when Christ
[21:30] comes preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is
[21:32] at hand and then we see the healing all
[21:36] manner of sicknesses and all manner of
[21:37] diseases it's signifying that God's
[21:40] kingdom doesn't have that
[21:42] that God's kingdom does not have sorrow
[21:44] does not have death does not have
[21:45] sickness does not have old age so it is
[21:48] the power of the Kingdom these things
[21:50] are related to uh the effect of the
[21:53] Kingdom that would drive away sickness
[21:54] that would drive away sorrow that would
[21:56] cause one to raise to death because
[21:58] that's the power and the law of that
[22:01] Kingdom that's being preached
[22:03] amen and so this Kingdom
[22:05] is of Heaven
[22:06] it's it's God's civilization the way he
[22:09] would want to arrange things
[22:11] it's from this Kingdom it's from the
[22:13] divine
[22:16] it's not it's not what man can do man
[22:18] can set a bone and it can heal man can
[22:20] topple kingdoms
[22:22] a men can build things and and think of
[22:25] what man could accomplish but now Jesus
[22:27] is doing something
[22:29] that even his critics would say now we
[22:30] know no man can do the things he you're
[22:32] doing except they come from God
[22:34] Jesus even arguing can Satan's kingdom
[22:37] be divided
[22:38] and showing that the signs and wonders
[22:40] that's not the end all but that's the
[22:43] evidence
[22:44] of the power of the Kingdom
[22:46] and so I'd like to read two statements I
[22:49] think I have these in the slideshow from
[22:51] this first one
[22:53] from Countdown the countdown
[22:55] and this is there's a whole lot here so
[22:58] this would be one you could just jot
[23:00] down quickly and meditate on this
[23:03] as science achieves something Looking
[23:05] Backward now he's using justification
[23:08] sanctification back to the Holy Ghost
[23:09] these countdown principles I Believe by
[23:11] the Chris you Minister on these very
[23:13] things last sometime last year I believe
[23:15] in these the principles you go to the
[23:17] countdown messages brother I'm trying to
[23:19] show the sync with sequencing and what
[23:21] we've unfolded to in this astronaut age
[23:23] trying to show a difference between the
[23:25] the ages that have unfolded previously
[23:27] and then demonstrating science has
[23:30] achieved this God achieves but now
[23:32] science achieves something looking
[23:33] backwards
[23:34] so even the civilization of automobiles
[23:37] and these things that's going backwards
[23:39] because brother Branham says God's power
[23:41] to transform him what do they get what
[23:42] is science doing leading to more death
[23:44] some of the greatest factors in death
[23:47] these days whether it be heart disease
[23:49] or car accidents you could trace it back
[23:51] not to the original but to man's own
[23:54] devices in man's own invention so
[23:56] they're just discovering more death
[23:57] they're just bringing upon themselves
[23:58] More Death because science achieves
[24:00] backwards but God achieves if we say a
[24:03] science achieves going backwards God
[24:05] achieves going this way going forward to
[24:09] the kingdom
[24:10] so this is how that God moves when God
[24:13] does something he's always moving and
[24:16] inching towards the Kingdom so let's
[24:19] just say we don't we have no idea if we
[24:20] just assume for a moment we have no idea
[24:22] what the kingdom is this is an important
[24:24] principle to grasp even it goes all the
[24:27] way back to the beginning in the
[24:28] beginning what God is doing is he moves
[24:30] he's always moving ever closer to
[24:34] whatever this principle is of the
[24:36] Kingdom
[24:37] that when God speaks when God creates
[24:39] when God unfolds things it just inches
[24:41] ever so closely towards the kingdom we
[24:44] say well we don't know what that is but
[24:45] God does
[24:46] and this is what he's trying to
[24:48] accomplish so I would say that in
[24:50] everything God has ever done God is
[24:53] always moving forward toward the kingdom
[24:58] and that God doesn't take the step back
[25:00] man does so when God builds this evening
[25:02] and he comes this perfect creation and
[25:04] then the serpent is beguiled first I
[25:07] guess the serpent is inhabited by Satan
[25:09] and beguiles the woman that's not God
[25:11] taking a step back that's Satan causing
[25:14] mankind to fall back but when God now is
[25:18] going to the next thing he does even in
[25:20] uh calling Noah even call neighbor he's
[25:22] just ever so closely with each step if
[25:25] you look hard enough he's unfolded a
[25:27] little bit more about the kingdom
[25:29] because this is what God does he's
[25:31] always moving forward to the kingdom
[25:34] now if we could take that as a principle
[25:36] then this kingdom is God's aim this
[25:39] kingdom is God's desire this Kingdom has
[25:42] something to do with God
[25:43] as Jesus comes preaching the kingdom of
[25:46] the preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[25:48] and healing all manner of sickness and
[25:50] all manner of disease and it's called
[25:51] the Kingdom of Heaven and the Bible says
[25:54] that God the god of Heaven shall set up
[25:55] a kingdom this is a Divine Kingdom
[26:01] now in the sermon the world is again
[26:03] falling apart
[26:06] I might I might hit a point where the
[26:09] filter you're gonna have to come up and
[26:10] finish your song list
[26:13] just to give me you might get me to go
[26:16] maybe 10 more minutes of a song sir so I
[26:19] can at least preach an hour tonight
[26:22] which brother Chris said that you're
[26:24] only remembered by how long you are
[26:26] compared to the last guy who preached
[26:29] you were over an hour but not by much
[26:34] the sermon the world is again falling
[26:36] apart
[26:38] this is just this countdown and these
[26:41] two are just I think principles that
[26:43] stand on their own that you can chew on
[26:45] that you can really get a lot of uh a
[26:47] lot of weight from he says in this word
[26:49] and he's the way that it's written or
[26:51] the way that he speaks it he's talking
[26:52] about this Bible he said this word is
[26:54] the kingdom
[26:56] this this word he says and if we want to
[26:59] kind of
[27:00] uh if we want to do
[27:02] embody that in the black and white or
[27:04] the the the the ink and the Indian paper
[27:06] this Bible represents the kingdom in
[27:09] written form and we know that this then
[27:11] in written form that there's a
[27:12] manifestation of this so we wouldn't
[27:14] just limit it to what's been published
[27:16] because in this word is the kingdom this
[27:18] is the king and the kingdom
[27:21] he says the system the life it's every
[27:25] bit right in here
[27:27] so if I could say this the kingdom of
[27:30] heaven or the kingdom of God is the word
[27:32] and as this is the word in written form
[27:36] the Bible holds the seeds or maybe I can
[27:40] say this way holds the revelation
[27:43] of the Kingdom
[27:44] because he says the word is the kingdom
[27:47] this is the king and the kingdom which
[27:50] and some of the future Services we could
[27:51] get more into just even what that phrase
[27:53] means Kingdom that word the etymology of
[27:55] it but he says the system and the life
[27:59] so the word the Bible
[28:02] if you look at it just as the Bible
[28:04] being the written word of God it's
[28:06] expressing to us a revelation of the
[28:08] Kingdom the revelation of the king and
[28:11] the kingdom that it re it reveals and it
[28:13] holds these seeds of the system
[28:17] and the system and it invites a thought
[28:19] of thinking that God has some order God
[28:22] has some construct
[28:23] there's something that the kingdom
[28:26] represents and and it has it it has an
[28:29] image and it has a uh transactions and
[28:32] it has a power and it has laws if I
[28:35] could use that and I I find that you try
[28:37] to describe this and you Resort you have
[28:39] to resort to human language to describe
[28:41] it but this is the Kingdom of Heaven is
[28:45] the word it is it has a system it is a
[28:48] life and he says it's every bit in the
[28:49] word of God
[28:51] and so as we touch on that in we kind of
[28:54] enter into this next part
[28:56] that's the kingdom
[28:58] of Heaven that's the kingdom of God
[29:00] those are the those are things that
[29:01] we're thinking about when we use that
[29:03] phrase in our title The Kingdom
[29:06] but now if I could take I want to grab
[29:09] a little bit more Foundation because
[29:11] that's certainly not exhaustive
[29:13] in terms of just even a foundation I
[29:15] wouldn't be satisfied in my heart if I
[29:17] was going to do a series on the kingdom
[29:18] just stopping there and calling that a
[29:20] foundation so I want to continue a
[29:22] little bit and grab a little bit more
[29:24] Foundation or lay a bit more Foundation
[29:25] but as I do this
[29:28] I want you to get an idea of what the
[29:31] foundation looks like and if you can get
[29:33] idea idea of the foundation that gives
[29:35] you some understanding of the footprint
[29:37] of what goes on top of it and so as I
[29:40] kind of grab some of these little a
[29:41] little bit more of the foundation I want
[29:43] to preach under the second half of this
[29:45] sermon in a way that would assume as if
[29:47] all the other parts have been preached
[29:49] that instead of for me this is where I
[29:52] feel it maybe it's a little bit
[29:52] different for me the way that God
[29:54] usually works with me is I see something
[29:57] and then I just start God just kind of
[29:59] works me back and works me back and then
[30:00] I just start building to that and I keep
[30:02] that image in mind and sometimes what
[30:04] God's doing is he's crystallizing that a
[30:06] little bit more or I'm realizing that we
[30:08] he wants to come at it from these
[30:09] different angles and then in my mind I'm
[30:11] always thinking I want to preach that
[30:12] last sermon that just kind of ties it
[30:13] all up in a really neat pretty bow and I
[30:15] say this is what we were tracking all
[30:17] along
[30:17] and so what I what I want to say tonight
[30:20] it's going to be very very simple so if
[30:21] the build up lets you down I apologize
[30:24] uh but there's it's and there's
[30:26] something to this
[30:28] that this is what's been burning inside
[30:30] my heart through all even all these
[30:32] sermons I've been preaching on perfect
[30:33] love this this has just been burning in
[30:35] my heart of this of this conclusive I
[30:39] can call this is the conclusion of the
[30:40] Kingdom Heaven's mystery and Earth glory
[30:43] and so if you could take Acts chapter
[30:45] one
[30:46] and the Beautiful part is is if you just
[30:48] keep it a secret everybody else who
[30:50] comes is gonna be like what is this
[30:52] about and you're like well I don't know
[30:55] I don't know you'll have to just go
[30:56] stick around for the rest and you'll
[30:58] know
[30:59] because you were here
[31:01] in Acts chapter one maybe we'll put this
[31:03] one behind a password
[31:05] this will be for the
[31:07] uh
[31:08] patreon subscribers
[31:10] and Acts chapter 1 verses 4 to 9 we read
[31:13] verse 6 in our
[31:15] a text he says and being assembled
[31:18] together with them commanded them that
[31:20] they should not depart from Jerusalem
[31:22] but wait for the promise of the Father
[31:24] which saith he ye have heard of me a lot
[31:27] that we could call you back to what
[31:28] she's referring to so for John truly
[31:31] baptized with water
[31:33] but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
[31:35] Ghost not many days hence so John is
[31:38] preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[31:40] hand and they're bringing forth fruit
[31:41] meat of repentance and John is baptizing
[31:44] but what John preached wasn't the
[31:47] Fulfillment of the promise John was
[31:50] pointing to the one because he said
[31:51] himself hey I baptize you with water but
[31:53] there's one coming after me
[31:56] he'd have a spiritual baptism a greater
[31:58] baptism so it's it's he Christ he's the
[32:01] one that ushers in these elements of the
[32:04] kingdom and so he says you're going to
[32:06] be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[32:08] days hence now that's according to a
[32:10] prophetic barrier or a boundary it was
[32:12] the day of Pentecost had to fully come
[32:14] they couldn't pray hard enough and fast
[32:16] hard enough earlier to get it
[32:19] God had to wait until that day so he
[32:21] says when they therefore were come
[32:23] together they asked of him saying Lord
[32:26] thou at this time restore again the
[32:29] Kingdom of Israel
[32:30] now we read in Daniel chapter 2 Daniel
[32:33] chapter seven these are the those
[32:35] scriptures would have been in the hearts
[32:37] of these disciples when they said now is
[32:39] this the moment
[32:40] in nowhere they're trivializing what
[32:42] he's done because they recognize the
[32:43] great signs and wonders the miracle of
[32:45] his death and Resurrection
[32:47] and so there's this Faith this
[32:49] confidence in him and he's confirming
[32:50] his presence with them and he's
[32:51] ministering to them and he's appearing
[32:53] and they realize this is different this
[32:56] is one that has been raised from the
[32:58] dead we knew that he was dead we saw him
[33:00] crucified now he's alive amongst us
[33:02] eating uh uh fish and he's walking and
[33:05] he's materializing himself before us and
[33:07] so now they're thinking now is this the
[33:10] moment that Daniel 2 is going to be
[33:12] fulfilled
[33:13] well will you now somehow present
[33:15] yourself as the Messiah and not just in
[33:19] a in a way of mocking him but declare
[33:22] himself the king of the Jews
[33:25] that this is the Messiah this is the
[33:27] long-awaited one will you restore the
[33:29] kingdom to Israel that's permanent
[33:31] Everlasting Kingdom
[33:34] and
[33:35] he says this and maybe bring in remember
[33:38] God's always moving forward
[33:41] to the kingdom
[33:43] so they're looking for the kingdom they
[33:45] want to see it restored and his answer
[33:48] we might take to mean uh well forget
[33:50] about that
[33:52] I I forget about that but pay attention
[33:55] that God has to be moving toward that
[33:56] that if if this is God speaking it has
[33:59] to be something that moves forward
[34:02] he can't take them back to something
[34:04] else he's not going to go back to the
[34:05] days of John he's not going to go back
[34:07] to the days of his Earthly Ministry
[34:08] there's got to be another advancement
[34:09] that takes place he says it's not for
[34:12] you to know the times or the seasons
[34:13] which the father have put in his own
[34:15] power no doubt Jesus in answering this
[34:18] is answering to their expectation and
[34:21] could say that no this is not the time
[34:22] for a millennial Reign this is not time
[34:24] for an eternal Kingdom as you would
[34:27] think it to be so it's not given to you
[34:30] to know these things in these times and
[34:31] seasons for these different
[34:32] manifestations but now notice what he
[34:35] says next but ye shall receive power
[34:38] now to them who were believing that it
[34:40] shall be given to the people the Saints
[34:42] of the most high an everlasting Kingdom
[34:44] and power and Dominion he's now telling
[34:47] him and telling them in a language that
[34:49] has something to do with Dominion but
[34:51] you will receive power
[34:53] but are you going to restore the kingdom
[34:55] he says wow as you are envisioning
[34:58] certain things to come to pass
[35:00] it's not given to you to know these
[35:02] different times or seasoned which are
[35:03] according to God's delegation and
[35:05] dispensation but you shall receive power
[35:09] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[35:11] you this is the promise which he shall
[35:12] be baptized with the Holy Ghost in verse
[35:14] 5. he says when the Holy Ghost comes
[35:16] upon you and ye shall be Witnesses Now
[35:18] watch how this language
[35:21] would hearken back to uh this the
[35:24] kingdoms who will be that all people
[35:27] Nations and languages will serve
[35:31] and it says and you shall receive power
[35:32] and you're going to be Witnesses unto me
[35:34] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[35:37] in Samaria and under the uttermost part
[35:40] of the Earth
[35:42] now there's no doubt and I guess maybe
[35:44] there is some conjecture on my part that
[35:47] if somebody had had the Scrolls open in
[35:50] the Old Testament and said will you
[35:52] restore the kingdom and All Nations and
[35:54] all tongues and all people be gathered
[35:56] to you and Jesus and this is what he's
[35:59] they're asking well this this Kingdom be
[36:01] restored now and then when Jesus says no
[36:03] well it's not given you to know these
[36:05] times but you're going to receive power
[36:07] and then begins to use the language that
[36:09] if someone was look looking at both they
[36:10] would say hmm
[36:14] right
[36:15] yeah all right who's with me I might
[36:18] just lock all right I just might lock my
[36:19] eyes on you
[36:22] can you see this
[36:24] that there's that there's this
[36:25] overlapping now the language that Jesus
[36:27] is using
[36:28] is not this sudden departure from what
[36:31] the Jewish Jewish Believers are looking
[36:32] for and what their expectations are but
[36:35] now he says this but you will receive
[36:36] power
[36:37] and when he had spoke these things why
[36:39] they beheld he was taken up now this
[36:42] part to me is this incredible inversion
[36:44] and a cloud received him out of their
[36:47] sight
[36:49] the Jews were expecting and believing
[36:51] that the kingdom was to be established
[36:54] on Earth
[36:56] so they ask is the kingdom now being
[36:58] established on Earth and they would have
[37:00] read of this time when the one like the
[37:02] son of man comes with the Clouds Of
[37:04] Heaven
[37:05] and now he says uh well let's not get
[37:08] ahead of yourselves but you will receive
[37:09] power
[37:10] and you will prophesy and you'll be a
[37:12] witness and you'll be a testimony to all
[37:13] tongues and Nations and people and
[37:15] around the whole world and verse 8 that
[37:17] is pointing them forward and saying now
[37:21] don't be looking back uh don't be just
[37:24] gazing up as the Angels begin to say but
[37:27] do what he said
[37:29] because he thou points them forward to
[37:31] the king the mystery of the Kingdom
[37:34] here you're looking for the kingdom well
[37:36] you will receive power
[37:38] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[37:40] you and then you're going to be
[37:41] Witnesses and Jesus had said in Luke 24
[37:44] 49 Tara ye in the city of Jerusalem
[37:46] until you be endued with power from on
[37:49] high
[37:50] what does that say power from 100 a
[37:53] power from heaven
[37:55] this is a power from the kingdom of
[37:57] heaven this is the kingdom coming
[38:00] so when he says that you shall receive
[38:02] power
[38:03] of being dude with power from on high
[38:05] and you're asking about the kingdom
[38:07] being restored you shall receive power
[38:09] and you're going to be Witnesses in
[38:11] Jerusalem which would have been the seat
[38:13] of the Messiah Kingdom to them and then
[38:15] and then witnesses to all Judea Samaria
[38:17] are the most parts of the earth he has a
[38:19] way of just in one sentence kind of
[38:21] summarizing all the hopes of Israel
[38:24] that the Messiah would Rule and reign
[38:26] with the rod of iron Over All Nations
[38:28] and the Gentiles would come to his life
[38:30] from around the whole world
[38:32] and they would Reign together with him
[38:35] he says you will receive power and then
[38:37] this
[38:38] I say this beautiful inversion because
[38:40] now as he says this
[38:43] a cloud
[38:44] receives him out of their sight
[38:47] which is a sign of the Kingdom
[38:50] which to them when the Messiahs to
[38:52] appear he's going to come in the Clouds
[38:55] of heaven with the clouds of heaven and
[38:57] now a cloud uh it takes and kind of
[39:00] envelops him and he leaves their sight
[39:02] at this sign of the cloud is what's
[39:04] given at the time that he has departed
[39:06] he has sent it up on high it's in the
[39:08] same way in which you have seen him
[39:09] disappear there will be a sign when he
[39:12] appears again
[39:14] and so this this Kingdom coming
[39:17] then we could continue to read how when
[39:20] the day of Pentecost is fully come
[39:22] they are baptized with the Holy Ghost
[39:25] and the Bible says they are filled
[39:28] with the Holy Ghost this is the power
[39:31] that they are now endued with
[39:32] and God is establishing the kingdom in
[39:37] man
[39:38] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:41] by the New Birth the new birth which is
[39:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost there now
[39:45] is a new kingdom
[39:48] that lives inside of them
[39:50] whereas by your natural birth you're
[39:52] subject to the laws of nature part of
[39:54] the you're part of Kingdom different
[39:56] kingdoms and phylums and genres and
[39:58] Geniuses and species these are all
[40:00] things that you find yourself in but now
[40:02] when you're born again this is a
[40:04] different Kingdom
[40:05] and brother Bram says in the sermon the
[40:07] falling part a part of the world
[40:09] he says Peter on the Pentecost opened
[40:12] the door to the kingdom he did the
[40:15] kingdom had just been set up at
[40:17] Jerusalem
[40:18] I want some man to tell me that the
[40:20] church began at Rome I want somebody to
[40:22] prove that to me the church never begin
[40:25] at Rome the church began in Jerusalem
[40:27] the kingdom was set up on the day of
[40:30] Pentecost
[40:32] now the day of Pentecost and now there's
[40:34] certain things you can hyper focus on oh
[40:35] they all spoke in tongues and and this
[40:37] happened and that's the sign and that's
[40:39] the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[40:40] but what you see is the Holy Ghost
[40:43] indwelling flesh
[40:45] brother I think it's a deity of Crisis
[40:47] he returned back on the day of Pentecost
[40:49] now now there's a there's a coming for
[40:51] you to think about he's ascended up into
[40:53] heaven and then he returns back into the
[40:57] Jews uh on the on in who they're in the
[40:59] upper room on the dead Pecos and the
[41:01] Holy Ghost indwells them this is the
[41:03] comforter this is giving them new life
[41:05] this is birthing them this is the birth
[41:07] of the church Barrett says the kingdom
[41:09] is set up for the day of Pentecost why
[41:11] because now deity is living in manner
[41:14] now they have a new life a new they're
[41:17] new creatures this is this changes the
[41:20] old order whereas before they would live
[41:23] a natural life and they would plunge
[41:24] into a natural grave but now for the
[41:26] events of the death burial and
[41:28] Resurrection now they are guaranteed
[41:30] eternity now they have their place in
[41:32] the great beyond and by the baptism of
[41:34] the Holy Ghost he says the kingdom is
[41:36] being set up on the day of Pentecost
[41:37] then is it any wonder that as the
[41:39] kingdom is being established on the day
[41:40] of Pentecost that those who are now are
[41:44] bearing the the kingdom go out amongst
[41:46] all those gathered in Jerusalem in the
[41:48] day of Pentecost and they begin to speak
[41:50] in what is seemed called unknown tongues
[41:53] but now all men hear it
[41:55] in their own language what this is this
[41:58] is why I call this the conclusion
[42:00] because you begin to recognize something
[42:02] that when they went out and they began
[42:04] to speak God God wants the Kingdom of
[42:08] Heaven to be translated in a way that we
[42:11] can understand it
[42:13] he wants it to be real
[42:16] it wasn't he wants it to be grasp he
[42:18] wants it to be understood
[42:20] Hallelujah the kingdom has been being
[42:23] established he says set up on the day of
[42:26] Pentecost and it's signified wherein
[42:28] every man is hearing hearing in his own
[42:30] language why because that's what the
[42:33] kingdom was to do
[42:36] All Nations and tongues and languages
[42:38] would serve him and it says and these
[42:40] thousands are added to the kingdom that
[42:42] day
[42:44] wow
[42:47] so then
[42:48] let me
[42:50] and again there may be something it may
[42:53] not satisfy me
[42:54] to say some of these things without more
[42:56] background so I'm preaching it assuming
[42:58] I've already preached all the other
[42:59] parts
[43:01] and so this is just a little trick I'm
[43:03] playing on myself
[43:04] a little psychology it's like you've
[43:06] already preached all the other parts go
[43:08] ahead and take a risk just say it
[43:10] without trying to prove it through 45
[43:12] Services because it's nothing but the
[43:14] truth
[43:16] and it's on Luke chapter 17 verses 20
[43:18] and 21.
[43:21] I guess I could say this the Lord had uh
[43:26] dealt very strongly with my heart to
[43:28] minister out of the series we preached
[43:29] on our family tree to minister on that
[43:32] and in Cloverdale and I was certainly
[43:34] happy to have such a broad Foundation
[43:37] when you go and just preach one sermon
[43:38] knowing that wow you've got all this
[43:41] foundation of the word of God you're
[43:42] standing upon to be able to present
[43:44] something in obedience to the Lord to
[43:46] his people
[43:48] so now it says here in Luke chapter 17
[43:50] and we're just assuming that Foundation
[43:52] is there tonight right
[43:53] and Luke chapter 17 verses to 20 to 21
[43:56] and when he was demanded of the
[43:58] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[44:00] come so the disciples had the question
[44:02] after the Resurrection the Pharisees
[44:05] have this question pre-resurrection when
[44:07] is the kingdom of God going to come if
[44:09] you're the Messiah then you you should
[44:11] know this if you're the Son of God you
[44:13] would know this
[44:14] he answered them and said now this is
[44:16] remarkable this is really a mouthful the
[44:18] kingdom of God cometh not with
[44:20] observation
[44:23] now this is of
[44:25] there's a lot in this and I know you'd
[44:27] be in Bible students and especially
[44:29] listening to the message of the hour you
[44:31] know how brother Branham addressed these
[44:33] things and talked about these things the
[44:35] king of God comes not with observation
[44:37] now certainly we could take just that
[44:40] phrase and we could unpack it in a lot
[44:42] of different ways
[44:43] but if one would come with military
[44:45] might in toppling governments you know
[44:48] all you have to do is see the one flag
[44:50] lowered and the other one raised you say
[44:51] that's a new kingdom we got them he
[44:53] planted the Messiah flag on Temple Mount
[44:56] where we've arrived this is we're here
[44:58] but he said it doesn't come with
[45:00] observation neither shall they say Lo
[45:02] here or Lo there
[45:04] all right oh behold the Messiah will
[45:06] come suddenly to this Temple and they're
[45:09] looking for these things to happen
[45:10] they're looking for these things to be
[45:11] fulfilled I said oh well he's here and
[45:13] oh he's there he says for behold the
[45:16] kingdom of God is within you
[45:19] now one could take this and say well the
[45:21] kingdom of God is among you no question
[45:23] the Messiah is there the kingdom is
[45:26] amongst them Christ now in just this
[45:28] microcosm embodies the kingdom
[45:32] he has a perfect reflection of it
[45:34] because now he's demonstrating he can
[45:36] walk on water not anybody the man
[45:38] Kingdom the animal kingdom can't can't
[45:39] demonstrate these things of multiplying
[45:42] creation and speaking out to creation
[45:43] and stopping the winds and walking on
[45:45] water and raising the dead Christ we can
[45:47] say the kingdom is with them but he
[45:50] doesn't use the language that just says
[45:52] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[45:54] and and I you just wonder
[45:56] just how much more Force this may have
[45:58] landed it may be one thing for John to
[46:00] say the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and
[46:02] one thing for Jesus to say repent the
[46:04] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for them to
[46:06] just kind of turn it into it and say the
[46:07] kingdom of God is within you
[46:13] question that uh
[46:16] uh that was had Nicodemus had
[46:21] of you know well we know that you must
[46:23] be come from God and Jesus says well hey
[46:25] you cannot because what's the what's
[46:27] this Rabbi what's this Pharisee what's a
[46:29] scribe what are they all looking for the
[46:30] Messiah the Messiah
[46:31] the Jewish religion is built on the
[46:34] coming of the Messiah this says all
[46:37] their hopes you say while the Jews they
[46:39] don't eat this and they wear this and
[46:40] they worship here and they do all these
[46:42] things but everything points to the
[46:44] kingdom
[46:46] and this is this is the this would the
[46:48] Fulfillment of their faith even today
[46:50] would be the Messiah to come
[46:53] in fulfillment of the law and the
[46:55] prophets
[46:56] and so as the question is asked even
[46:58] Nicodemus when he asked the question
[47:00] Jesus is very quick just to say hey uh
[47:02] you know except the man be born again he
[47:04] cannot see the kingdom of God
[47:08] brother ma'am tells us how that that's
[47:09] to understand and then he says well how
[47:12] can a man enter into his mother's womb
[47:14] and be born again he says I I say unto
[47:16] you except the man be born of water and
[47:17] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[47:19] of God that which is flesh is flesh that
[47:21] was Spirit of spirit so he says Marvel
[47:23] not when I send you you must be born
[47:25] again
[47:26] that's that's quite a statement
[47:29] and and it's addressing this
[47:32] misunderstanding or I maybe I shouldn't
[47:34] just say shouldn't say misunderstanding
[47:36] it's addressing what their what the
[47:40] materialization of their faith will look
[47:42] like
[47:44] you understand in other words if they
[47:46] have all these hopes Jesus is saying wow
[47:48] if you ever if you want to see it this
[47:49] is what it's going to take this is what
[47:51] it's going to look like so brother
[47:52] Berman the sermon sermon proving his
[47:54] word
[47:55] Jesus said except a man be born again he
[47:58] cannot see the kingdom in other words
[48:00] understand the kingdom because the
[48:03] kingdom is the Holy Spirit In You
[48:06] [Music]
[48:08] that's the kingdom
[48:10] the kingdom of God is within you so now
[48:12] Jesus I Repent the Kingdom of Heaven is
[48:14] at hand and Jesus is saying the Kingdom
[48:16] of Heaven is at hand and we we find this
[48:19] happening at a time when the heavens
[48:21] have opened up and the spirit descends
[48:23] Upon Jesus like a dove as his behold
[48:26] this is my son and the and and the
[48:29] Father the Lord God comes to dwell in
[48:31] Christ who had been born of the woman
[48:33] apart from sex but here is this the king
[48:36] of Heaven the king of Heaven being
[48:37] represented in Christ he's preaching
[48:40] he's displaying the power of the Kingdom
[48:42] he's preaching the gospel of the Kingdom
[48:44] oh I I can't preach to the whole
[48:46] Ministry of Jesus Christ but think of
[48:48] what was manifested in the days of his
[48:50] flesh culminating his death burial and
[48:52] resurrection and now he's saying that
[48:54] the kingdom of God is within you and he
[48:57] says the kingdom is the Holy Spirit In
[48:59] You
[49:02] I hope this gives not just color or
[49:04] context but just a much more deeper
[49:07] meaning to what it means to be born
[49:09] again a much deeper intimacy with God's
[49:13] promises when I realize I have the Holy
[49:16] Ghost
[49:17] I it has not just made me a religious
[49:19] person it has not just made me a
[49:21] Christian it has not just made me
[49:23] subject to the gifts but if I had the
[49:25] Holy Ghost dwelling on the inside of my
[49:28] soul then the kingdom of God is within
[49:31] me oh I hope that that could have more
[49:33] Force hope that it could have more
[49:35] weight to you tonight I thank God that
[49:37] you're here I thank God that you
[49:39] sacrificed I thank God that you you make
[49:42] it a matter of commitment to be in the
[49:44] service and I say Let It Be A payoff
[49:46] tonight to understand this baptism in a
[49:49] greater way than it is the kingdom
[49:51] inside of you
[49:55] and Paul if you want to get a head start
[49:58] on this maybe read Hebrews chapter 12.
[50:00] and even in Mount Zion
[50:05] he writes in this conclusion way
[50:07] wherefore we receive in a kingdom
[50:11] which cannot be moved
[50:13] is Paul not hearkening back to Daniel 2.
[50:17] is he not pointing him back to Daniel 7
[50:20] and I'm just taking those because you
[50:22] remember in all the other parts where we
[50:23] use many more scriptures on this
[50:26] the the assumed ones
[50:29] I see I had to finish the joke that time
[50:33] and so someone asked me I spoke at the
[50:35] graduation banquet um Saturday night and
[50:37] someone said how does it feel brother
[50:38] Aaron to tell a joke in 95 of the people
[50:42] don't get it
[50:44] and I said
[50:46] it's the most amazing feeling in the
[50:47] world
[50:50] seriously
[50:53] see what I did there
[50:55] he says we receive in a kingdom which
[50:57] cannot be moved
[50:59] this is the kingdom he says we've
[51:01] received it
[51:02] now I'll say this and this is a whole
[51:04] series in itself and I may have already
[51:07] said it to you I know I've said it in
[51:09] Fellowship maybe I've already said it in
[51:10] my preaching I and if I have if this is
[51:13] emphasis repetition for uh to make
[51:16] emphasis here
[51:17] that when Paul is preaching
[51:19] and he's preaching Christ and preaching
[51:22] Christ on him crucified we look at Paul
[51:25] and Peter and all these other Jews as
[51:28] their conversion out of Judaism into
[51:32] Christianity
[51:33] and so he said oh well we have the Old
[51:35] Testament in the old Covenant now we
[51:37] have the New Covenant and Paul is
[51:38] converted he's no longer a Pharisee of
[51:40] the Pharisees he's converted from his
[51:42] old Faith to a new faith and you miss a
[51:45] lot if you think of it that way Paul
[51:47] wasn't converted to a new faith
[51:51] hello
[51:53] come on somebody
[51:55] trying to think of all the phrases that
[51:56] work sometimes
[51:57] he wasn't converted to a New Faith he
[52:00] had found the Fulfillment of his faith
[52:04] so Paul's not preaching a new Faith
[52:06] Paul's not preaching a new gospel Paul's
[52:09] not trying to bring them into some
[52:10] newfangled idea he's trying to say
[52:12] that's what the book of Hebrews
[52:13] represents to us he's trying to say look
[52:15] everything you believed in everything
[52:17] you hoped for every type every shadow
[52:20] every Prophet this isn't a new religion
[52:22] this isn't a new cultish idea this is
[52:26] the satisfaction of the Jewish faith so
[52:29] his conversion but he says we've
[52:30] received the kingdom this isn't some new
[52:33] mystic thing that happens apart from
[52:35] what they believe you're saying this is
[52:37] everything a Jew ever longed for and
[52:39] looked for now if I could just say this
[52:42] this message is in the same pattern
[52:45] brother Brown's message doesn't come up
[52:47] with some cultist idea it's not a
[52:50] conversion from Christian faith it's a
[52:52] message to all Christians and to all
[52:55] believers to all ages that let me say
[52:58] this and let me declare it Jesus Christ
[53:00] is the son of God
[53:03] there is only one God there's only one
[53:06] Lord Jesus Christ and you'll deny him to
[53:08] your own Peril brother Branham does not
[53:10] come preach in another gospel he said
[53:12] this is everything you've ever believed
[53:14] in
[53:15] amen this is the Fulfillment of the
[53:17] Gentile faith
[53:19] it's not a conversion to some new idea
[53:22] it's a satisfaction of it
[53:25] he says we receive in a kingdom
[53:28] which cannot be moved
[53:30] let us have Grace
[53:33] oh and this is this is something you've
[53:35] received a kingdom that will never be
[53:36] destroyed Be Without End
[53:38] and if if you had said that maybe to the
[53:41] Pharisees who came to Jesus to win the
[53:43] kingdom of God uh be restored he says
[53:45] well the kingdom of God is within you
[53:47] and no doubt may be a zealot is going
[53:48] yeah let's do this
[53:51] right find that ax murder where's this
[53:53] where's the axon where's the Spears and
[53:55] the javelin you know let's go do this
[53:57] and right in their minds they're
[53:59] thinking one thing the Pharisees
[54:00] thinking yeah king of God's inside of me
[54:01] I need Zeal I need these I need to top
[54:02] all these Roman governments and and
[54:05] maybe even in saying this we receive a
[54:07] kingdom which cannot be moved oh well
[54:09] what would that do and motivate a Hebrew
[54:11] what would how would they then think oh
[54:13] I know this Kingdom this Kingdom will
[54:15] know no end
[54:17] this Kingdom has no no barriers around
[54:20] the Earth all kingdoms all governments
[54:23] all lands Everything Is Ours what ought
[54:27] that to do Paul how can I then how can I
[54:31] then be the the best for the kingdom he
[54:36] says let us have Grace
[54:39] let us have Grace whereby we may serve
[54:42] God acceptably with reverence and godly
[54:44] fear
[54:46] Kingdom
[54:48] a kingdom and its power can be manifest
[54:51] in Grace in reverence and godly fear let
[54:54] me it's not a weak Kingdom it's not a
[54:56] weak gospel it's a gospel of power but
[54:58] we can't wield it in arrogance we can't
[55:00] wield it in Pride we can't see it being
[55:02] effective through intimidation but if we
[55:04] have Grace
[55:08] and then Brethren Bradham says and the
[55:11] seed shall not be here with the shuck
[55:13] I I'll have just uh I just need to
[55:15] quickly gloss over this
[55:20] well let me ask
[55:22] I'm gonna take a poll
[55:24] who wants me to stop right now and we'll
[55:25] pick this up later raise your hand
[55:29] nope
[55:31] I'm just looking at the young people
[55:33] the kids here because there's maybe
[55:35] enough of you you guys don't realize how
[55:37] powerful you are
[55:38] not one person raise their hand so all
[55:41] right cut the stream this won't be
[55:42] archived we'll just make this for the
[55:44] local Folk
[55:46] again they don't do it
[55:48] matches the kingdom of God
[55:51] which is in the Earth today
[55:53] can never be set up justly on a
[55:55] permissive will
[55:57] he said it's got to come back to his
[55:59] perfect will
[56:01] the kingdom cannot be set up justly
[56:04] rightly correctly on permissive will
[56:06] remember how we explored uh the and in
[56:10] the beginning how that brother Bradham
[56:12] or we see that God allowed mankind to
[56:14] come to a first birth and that's
[56:16] permissive will
[56:18] but now he's saying You must be born
[56:19] again why the kingdom couldn't be
[56:22] established on permissive will Christ
[56:25] came as a spoken word Son of God apart
[56:27] from the original sin why the kingdom
[56:29] could never be made manifest on perfect
[56:32] will therefore we cannot relate to
[56:34] interact with and be beneficiaries of
[56:36] and find our place in the Kingdom on
[56:39] permissive will so the first birth leads
[56:42] us back to a second birth and we've got
[56:44] to come back to his perfect will and let
[56:46] me say this not just into the birth but
[56:48] in our lives the kingdom cannot be
[56:51] rightly justly righteously established
[56:54] by permissive will it's got to come back
[56:56] to his perfect will
[57:03] the kingdom which is on Earth today
[57:06] this is part of Heaven's mystery
[57:10] and
[57:15] I just take back anything I ever said
[57:17] about song service length and stuff like
[57:18] that it's just confusing for me
[57:21] I I don't I only count by my hourly rate
[57:23] so this is just getting too hard for me
[57:28] the kingdom he says
[57:31] which is on Earth today
[57:33] did you catch that part
[57:34] the kingdom which is on Earth today this
[57:37] is part of Heaven's mystery
[57:39] now let me I want to preach now
[57:43] I the LIE of Catholicism
[57:48] and start paying attention to this the
[57:51] shadows of Catholicism are strong
[57:54] in Christianity Today in a really strong
[57:56] even within the message and things are
[57:59] done in the name of apostleship and
[58:02] things are done in the name of church
[58:03] order and things are done in the name of
[58:05] reverence to the message which are not
[58:08] detached from the spirit of Catholicism
[58:11] and I'm not trying to put that on
[58:13] leadership I'm putting it on individuals
[58:15] who follow
[58:16] that there's a lot of things we do and
[58:18] it's no more than Catholicism rebranded
[58:20] and so with having said that mouthful
[58:23] listen to this mouthful the lies of
[58:24] Catholicism have watered down this life
[58:27] brother says the Kingdom of Heaven which
[58:29] is on Earth today catholicism's lie is
[58:32] that this life has now been watered down
[58:34] to a decision between hell and heaven
[58:39] that this is what our decision is and it
[58:43] divides this is that this is the
[58:44] conclusion this is a summation it has
[58:46] divided
[58:48] eternity between hell and heaven
[58:51] right this is this is what all
[58:54] Christianity points to virtually and I
[58:56] say nominal Christianity is you're here
[58:58] on Earth as a sinner to make your
[58:59] decision where you want to spend
[59:01] eternity do you want to accept Christ as
[59:02] your personal Savior and spend eternity
[59:04] in heaven or do you want to deny Christ
[59:06] and spend your eternity in hell and what
[59:08] they've done is they've turned Earth
[59:09] into this temporary uh hodgepodge of
[59:13] experiences and temptations to where
[59:15] we've got to make our decision whether
[59:16] or not we want to be saved and spend
[59:18] eternity in Hell or spend our eternity
[59:20] in heaven and part of that equation is
[59:23] and this is where it comes back to for
[59:24] God so loved the world part of that
[59:26] equation is that Earth then is destroyed
[59:28] and Heaven and Earth shall pass away and
[59:30] there'll be a new Heavens A New Earth
[59:31] and so then Earth is just this temporary
[59:33] Proving Grounds you're going to make
[59:35] your choice you'll be in Hell For
[59:37] Eternity in heaven for eternity and then
[59:39] all eternity is bookended by hell in
[59:41] heaven
[59:43] but Jesus says in Matthew chapter 13
[59:45] verses 10 and 11.
[59:47] the disciples come to him this is after
[59:49] he's given a parable he says why speak
[59:50] is thou unto them in parables
[59:53] foreign
[59:55] Chris brought in um what you identify as
[59:59] like well there's a we identify with
[1:00:01] them
[1:00:02] all right one of them
[1:00:05] and she is him
[1:00:08] I don't know what the confusion is
[1:00:11] he says this in verse 11 he answered and
[1:00:13] said to them because it is given unto
[1:00:15] you
[1:00:16] to know
[1:00:18] the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:00:21] but to them it is not given
[1:00:23] that's 8 30.
[1:00:26] I want you to just concentrate for just
[1:00:28] a few more moments here
[1:00:30] then if you just read this chapter alone
[1:00:32] and we're not taking any other thing
[1:00:33] into view except chapter 13. Jesus gives
[1:00:36] different Parables of the Kingdom of
[1:00:38] Heaven
[1:00:40] and as he gives these Parables I'm in no
[1:00:41] way trying to water them down I mean not
[1:00:43] trying to trivialize them or just try to
[1:00:44] oversimplify them but I want you just to
[1:00:46] catch this brother Branham says the
[1:00:49] kingdom of the whole kingdom is the Holy
[1:00:51] Spirit In You
[1:00:52] and Paul says we've received a kingdom
[1:00:54] so let us have Grace and serve God
[1:00:55] acceptably with reverence and fear
[1:00:57] Brethren says the kingdom was set up on
[1:00:59] the day of Pentecost Jesus said the
[1:01:00] kingdom of God is within you
[1:01:04] and then and then if we just could
[1:01:06] understand that the disciples went out
[1:01:08] and if they had some idea that the
[1:01:10] Messiah is going to materialize and
[1:01:11] governments are going to be changed and
[1:01:12] it's going to be this Millennial what
[1:01:14] we'd call me like a millennial type
[1:01:15] Reign it doesn't happen they go on
[1:01:16] Marion they go on having wives and and
[1:01:19] children and propagating churches and
[1:01:20] spreading the gospel
[1:01:22] and so Jesus gives different Parables of
[1:01:24] the kingdom and each one when he uses it
[1:01:26] and I do not believe it was just merely
[1:01:30] the construct he would use
[1:01:32] so that people could understand
[1:01:35] but it's always say this way in it each
[1:01:38] one he uses some aspect of just everyday
[1:01:40] life
[1:01:42] and it wasn't just this is the part I
[1:01:43] went emphasize it wasn't just so that we
[1:01:45] could be like oh okay yeah like this
[1:01:49] but if I could say this it has something
[1:01:51] to do with it
[1:01:53] it wasn't like well in heaven in heaven
[1:01:55] there won't be Fields per se or in
[1:01:58] heaven there won't be this per se in
[1:02:00] heaven I mean there's not like a literal
[1:02:02] net but it's like this right
[1:02:04] you know like a group doesn't like the
[1:02:06] Beatles or something no it's not just
[1:02:08] trying to say it's like something he
[1:02:10] said he's wanting the parable to convey
[1:02:12] something
[1:02:13] and he uses all these Earthly examples
[1:02:16] the sowing of the seed and the Harvest
[1:02:18] of those seeds
[1:02:19] that there's going to be the sowing of
[1:02:21] wheat and there'll be a harvest of wheat
[1:02:23] but then there's also the sowing of
[1:02:25] tears and there'll be a harvest of tears
[1:02:27] and you get the image of one that's
[1:02:28] sowing a good seed and harvesting that
[1:02:31] and that even bad seed that sowed and a
[1:02:33] harvest of that and you'll find that has
[1:02:36] specific application in our lives both
[1:02:38] naturally and spiritually and then he
[1:02:40] goes into the casting of the net and how
[1:02:42] the nest is cast out in what it catches
[1:02:44] and brings in and so you have the image
[1:02:46] of one who's a farmer and one who's a
[1:02:49] gather you have an even image of one who
[1:02:50] is a hunter and these are means of
[1:02:52] planting that they might get bread they
[1:02:54] might get seed there'd be a harvest of
[1:02:55] that there's the effort of fishing that
[1:02:57] they might get things that they could
[1:02:58] sell things that they could eat and then
[1:03:00] he goes not just to the sowing of seed
[1:03:02] but it's the Harvest of those sea seeds
[1:03:05] so then it's the use of the things
[1:03:07] planted
[1:03:09] in the parable of the mustard seed and
[1:03:11] how it starts out small and it grows and
[1:03:13] it gives shade and it gives uh comfort
[1:03:16] and these different things that it does
[1:03:17] even with the the wheat how he's going
[1:03:19] to use the wheat flour and going to bake
[1:03:21] something and how you use the use of the
[1:03:23] wheat and even the the adding of the
[1:03:25] leaven these are all images where one is
[1:03:28] making a cake one is fishing one is
[1:03:31] plowing one is doing this and even down
[1:03:33] to where the Parables of the Kingdom in
[1:03:36] a treasure hid in the field and a pearl
[1:03:37] of great price there's trans they're
[1:03:39] selling there's buying there's
[1:03:41] transacting I say all the elements of
[1:03:44] life
[1:03:45] the needs of Life the Necessities the
[1:03:47] library says seek ye first the king of
[1:03:48] God and all these things will be added
[1:03:51] unto you you could fast forward to
[1:03:52] Matthew Chapter 13 and in the planting
[1:03:55] and the watering and the sowing and the
[1:03:58] baking and the fishing and all the labor
[1:04:01] that you can say these are the things
[1:04:02] that have to do with natural life and
[1:04:05] this is what what's being expressed here
[1:04:07] is not that we can say Oh Heaven oh
[1:04:10] Earth but then we can see the kingdom is
[1:04:13] associated with these things that the
[1:04:15] kingdom being typed as this can be
[1:04:17] manifested in this I I'm losing my voice
[1:04:20] tonight but I hope that you can see this
[1:04:22] that when he gives these Parables it was
[1:04:24] to take heaven and bring it down to
[1:04:26] earth
[1:04:29] and I would say the kingdom is Heaven's
[1:04:32] mystery revealed his Earth's Glory
[1:04:36] I look given you know to know the
[1:04:38] mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven and
[1:04:40] the midst of the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:04:42] represented
[1:04:44] where'd that come from it's represented
[1:04:46] in the sower
[1:04:48] in the seed in the Harvest in the
[1:04:51] cultivation and I realize this is this
[1:04:53] is everyday life
[1:04:55] that this is where the glory is there's
[1:04:57] so much division there's so much
[1:04:59] separation and the Catholics just want
[1:05:01] you to say well I choose Jesus and one
[1:05:03] day I'm going to go to heaven for
[1:05:04] eternity or if you'd reject Jesus you're
[1:05:06] going to go to hell I I would say and
[1:05:09] let me say this in this great glorious
[1:05:10] hour we're living in if you think
[1:05:12] Christianity is just a choice between
[1:05:14] heaven and hell you're going to miss the
[1:05:16] most glorious aspects of Christianity
[1:05:18] and there's the smallest seeds of this
[1:05:21] are in that decision and where you end
[1:05:23] up in eternity but let me say that
[1:05:25] heaven's mystery is revealed now in
[1:05:28] Earth's Glory
[1:05:31] and the revelation of this topple
[1:05:33] Satan's agenda I believe that we ought
[1:05:35] not to be so consumed with where we'll
[1:05:37] spend eternity but be concerned with how
[1:05:40] much Heaven Can manifest on Earth
[1:05:43] let your will be done on Earth as it is
[1:05:46] in heaven I'm not satisfied with going
[1:05:48] to Eternity I long to see eternity
[1:05:52] birthed here
[1:05:59] and brother Branham says in Christ is
[1:06:00] the mystery of God revealed
[1:06:03] I think do I have this statement there
[1:06:05] good
[1:06:06] we belong to
[1:06:07] a kingdom
[1:06:13] I know my daughter Eliza will like this
[1:06:15] a little it's a kind of artsy in the
[1:06:16] Kingdom
[1:06:18] is the word of God
[1:06:20] made spirit and life
[1:06:22] in our own life
[1:06:26] the word of God heaven
[1:06:28] our own life Earth
[1:06:31] together make the kingdom
[1:06:34] and red and blue make
[1:06:36] purple
[1:06:38] I think someone said white
[1:06:40] but
[1:06:41] I'm starting all over
[1:06:45] the kingdom is
[1:06:48] the word of God made spirit and life in
[1:06:53] our own life
[1:06:54] he said this word is the kingdom this is
[1:06:57] the king and the kingdom the system and
[1:06:59] the life every bit right here and let's
[1:07:01] say that he put the Bible out there
[1:07:04] but can you say tonight sisters can you
[1:07:07] say tonight brothers that the kingdom is
[1:07:09] right here
[1:07:10] let the kingdom is the word of God made
[1:07:14] spirit and life in my own life bringing
[1:07:17] to pass every promise in this day as it
[1:07:20] did in that day when the word and God
[1:07:21] Was Won what is he pointing to not just
[1:07:24] in the beginning was the word but Jesus
[1:07:26] Christ who came bearing the
[1:07:29] characteristics of the Kingdom he says
[1:07:31] in the word and God is one in his church
[1:07:33] today making it the headship of the body
[1:07:36] that is redeemed to bring back the
[1:07:38] message in the last day and be taken up
[1:07:40] from the dead and the resurrection to go
[1:07:42] back and restore again
[1:07:44] was he said in the sermon the kingdom in
[1:07:45] its right position as Adam and Eve in
[1:07:48] the beginning In the Garden of Eden the
[1:07:49] world that God loved
[1:07:51] the threefold mystery of God
[1:07:53] his body
[1:07:55] the kingdom is the union of divinity
[1:07:56] heaven
[1:07:58] and Humanity Earth
[1:08:00] that's the kingdom
[1:08:03] and so when they when we take this life
[1:08:05] and we just this is why I say that this
[1:08:07] Revelation and I'm not saying the
[1:08:09] Revelation I'm preaching but what I'm
[1:08:11] trying to point you to tonight
[1:08:12] that it's not a choice between hell and
[1:08:14] heaven and that we're not just Holding
[1:08:17] On by God's grace that we're going to
[1:08:18] make it into the Millennium and make it
[1:08:20] into the eighth day but when you
[1:08:21] recognize that God this is it this is
[1:08:23] the Clincher right here that God all
[1:08:25] along wanted the Kingdom right here
[1:08:28] this is where he wanted it not in heaven
[1:08:31] and not in hell he didn't want a place
[1:08:33] where there was the absence of the
[1:08:35] Kingdom he wanted to where there'd be a
[1:08:37] he did not want a place to exist where
[1:08:38] the kingdom of God would not be
[1:08:40] therefore hell will disappear and Earth
[1:08:43] the new Heavens is not so without a new
[1:08:48] Earth
[1:08:50] therefore God's image in the beginning
[1:08:52] was that the kingdom would be here on
[1:08:54] Earth
[1:08:55] I say therefore let us have Grace that
[1:08:58] we can serve God
[1:09:00] we can do it correctly and to recognize
[1:09:03] my life here every day every Monday
[1:09:06] morning listen let me say it for
[1:09:07] tomorrow morning that it matters this
[1:09:10] this word is relevant and it matters why
[1:09:12] because the kingdom has got to be lived
[1:09:15] it's got to be expressed and his desire
[1:09:17] all along was to have deity in flesh and
[1:09:20] to manifest Heaven and Earth and I say
[1:09:22] let your will be done
[1:09:24] a nerfed as it is in heaven
[1:09:26] could we stand together this evening
