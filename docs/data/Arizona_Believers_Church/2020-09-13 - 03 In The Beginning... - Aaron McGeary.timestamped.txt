[0:10] of god
[0:12] [Music]
[0:14] man let's just stand to our feet this
[0:16] morning
[0:17] brother branham in one place he called
[0:18] it the sin the sin of fear
[0:21] he said it'd be a sin to disbelieve so
[0:23] we want to just push away any sin of
[0:25] fear
[0:26] any seer of un sin of unbelief this
[0:29] morning and just let the lord
[0:30] have his way if we could just bow our
[0:33] heads in a word of prayer we'll just
[0:35] commit the reading of the scripture to
[0:37] the lord and we welcome everyone that's
[0:39] come
[0:39] we're so glad to see you here we're glad
[0:41] that the presence of the lord is with us
[0:43] today
[0:44] a gracious heavenly father lord we're
[0:46] happy to be gathered together in your
[0:47] presence
[0:48] lord we sense your nearness to us and
[0:51] lord despite
[0:52] perhaps the uniqueness of the facilities
[0:55] lord and the uniqueness of the gathering
[0:58] there's that familiar presence lord that
[1:00] draws us
[1:02] there's a a confidence that we have on
[1:04] the holy spirit lord there's a
[1:06] looking two to you to fulfill your
[1:08] promises that
[1:09] makes gatherings like this worth every
[1:12] effort
[1:13] lord is where we know that the
[1:14] supernatural is just
[1:16] present and ready to do things for us
[1:18] that we ourselves cannot do
[1:20] so now lord we look to you to do the
[1:22] things that we are incapable of
[1:24] lord we look to you to do the things
[1:26] that we would not even pretend
[1:28] uh to be able to do and that's to take
[1:30] the bread of life and break it to us
[1:32] lord
[1:33] to take words father and quicken them to
[1:36] us by revelation
[1:37] and lord will there be a hurting soul
[1:39] here today i pray that you would
[1:41] minister to it
[1:42] there be a sick body may they take you
[1:44] at your word lord
[1:45] believe that these signs shall follow
[1:47] them that believe
[1:48] and that they can be made well and they
[1:50] could be healed
[1:51] father if there be a need of salvation
[1:53] we're looking to you to be the one that
[1:55] works within the unbeliever's heart
[1:57] the sinner's heart to bring them to a
[1:59] place of repentance and
[2:00] yielding to you lord in obedience father
[2:02] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[2:05] and to be sealed into the kingdom of god
[2:07] for lord we realize that regardless of
[2:09] how much revelation we may have
[2:11] regardless of how much revelation we may
[2:13] preach we're looking for a soul to be
[2:15] saved lord to be added to the body
[2:18] that it might complete your purpose and
[2:19] this earth would be
[2:21] filled up and replenished and every seed
[2:23] at your table would be taken
[2:24] so father we commit ourselves to you
[2:26] today desire that you take the bread of
[2:28] life
[2:28] break it to us bless the words which we
[2:30] read father the scriptures that are read
[2:32] and may bless the many that have
[2:34] gathered here today as we all
[2:36] in one accord lord open up our hearts to
[2:38] you in the name of lord jesus christ we
[2:40] pray
[2:41] amen now while you're standing i'd like
[2:43] to read in three different places
[2:45] that should be fairly easy genesis
[2:47] chapter 1
[2:48] then john chapter one and then
[2:50] revelations chapter three
[2:53] genesis chapter one that's the easy one
[2:57] and then john chapter one that would
[2:59] maybe be the harder of the three
[3:01] and then revelations chapter three so at
[3:03] the beginning of the book
[3:04] the middle of the book and the end of
[3:06] the book and just read in a few places
[3:11] just for our text genesis chapter 1
[3:14] verse 1
[3:15] says in the beginning god created
[3:18] the heaven and the earth in the
[3:21] beginning god created
[3:23] the heaven and the earth in john chapter
[3:25] 1
[3:26] verse 1 and all these are so familiar we
[3:28] could probably just
[3:30] quote them without having to flip to
[3:31] them but we'll
[3:33] read it to read it from the bible to be
[3:36] sure that we don't miss anything but
[3:37] john chapter 1 verse 1
[3:39] says in the beginning was the word and
[3:41] the word was with god
[3:43] and the word was god and then i'd like
[3:46] to read verse 14 as well and the word
[3:48] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[3:51] beheld his glory
[3:52] the glory is of the only begotten of the
[3:55] father full of grace
[3:56] and truth the brother shared with me one
[3:58] time how that he
[4:00] always grew up in the message hearing
[4:01] brother branham quote john chapter 1
[4:04] and he went hunting with some buddies
[4:05] and maybe another minister
[4:07] was with the minister and he's just a
[4:08] young man at the time and he grabbed the
[4:10] gideon bible from the
[4:12] hotel end table there and he began to
[4:15] read and he read in the beginning was
[4:16] the word and the word was with god and
[4:17] the word was god
[4:19] and he said the same was in the
[4:20] beginning with god he said hey there's a
[4:21] misprint in this bible
[4:23] and they said what's the misprint it
[4:24] says it doesn't say and the word was
[4:26] made flesh
[4:27] because brother bannon would take verse
[4:28] 1 and skip to verse 14 so often when he
[4:31] quoted it
[4:32] so we could see that expression of god
[4:34] the word was with god in the beginning
[4:36] and then the word
[4:37] was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[4:40] then revelations chapter 3 verse 14.
[4:43] this is at the beginning of the address
[4:45] to the laodicean church
[4:49] revelations chapter 3 verse 14 and unto
[4:52] the angel of the church of the
[4:54] laodicean's write
[4:56] these things saith the amen the faithful
[4:59] and true witness
[5:00] the beginning of the creation of god
[5:03] the beginning of the creation of god you
[5:05] may be seated
[5:11] i'd like to continue on the subject of
[5:13] in the beginning
[5:15] and then at the uh in the beginning of
[5:17] this this
[5:18] part to maybe back up and go over just a
[5:20] few things
[5:21] uh just to kind of lay them as a
[5:23] foundation for what's in my heart
[5:25] today to minister on but as we looked in
[5:28] genesis chapter one it says in the
[5:30] beginning
[5:30] god created the heaven and the earth i'd
[5:34] actually been pondering
[5:35] uh the who what when where why how i
[5:37] guess is the busytown
[5:39] theme song the who what when where why
[5:40] how of genesis chapter one and you see
[5:43] god
[5:43] creating you see how in creating the
[5:46] heavens and the earth
[5:47] and really it's wonderful for us as
[5:49] believers to know the why
[5:51] to see what god's doing and understand
[5:53] the why to it says in the beginning god
[5:55] created
[5:56] the heaven and the earth and we looked
[5:58] at how this the language used of god
[6:00] even when it comes to genesis chapter 2
[6:02] being called the lord god it speaks of
[6:04] the covenant god
[6:06] the strong one who's bound by an oath
[6:09] and it's the god
[6:10] have jehovah the god who becomes or who
[6:12] expresses himself
[6:14] so it's the unveiling of god it's the
[6:16] becoming god
[6:17] that's expressed in genesis chapter 1 in
[6:20] the beginning god
[6:21] creates and he's expressing himself and
[6:23] he's making himself
[6:24] known and as we ponder this verse
[6:27] genesis chapter 1 and we look at it
[6:29] god is declaring something glorious in
[6:32] this verse
[6:33] and if we just think about how god is
[6:36] writing the bible
[6:37] and he's going to inspire moses to pen
[6:39] these words and in the very first words
[6:41] of the bible which has been preserved
[6:43] even to this time and this day
[6:45] it says in the beginning god created the
[6:48] heaven and the earth
[6:49] we should really ponder just how
[6:50] important this verse was to god
[6:53] he's going to start expressing something
[6:55] and he's wanting the believer
[6:57] to catch a hold of this as we've read
[6:59] already in romans these things were
[7:00] written for our learning that through
[7:02] the patience
[7:03] of the scripture we might have hope so
[7:05] he wrote this so we could learn
[7:07] he wrote this so that we could have
[7:08] understanding it just didn't say well i
[7:10] got to begin somewhere and so
[7:12] it was a dark and stormy night no he
[7:14] just he started with a phrase that would
[7:16] get our attention
[7:18] that we could d dive into and catch his
[7:20] mind and catch his heart
[7:21] so this is a very significant verse he
[7:24] says in the beginning god created the
[7:26] heaven and the earth
[7:27] and brother bretta makes this statement
[7:29] and falling apart of the world
[7:31] he says but the one who created the
[7:34] heaven and the earth
[7:35] expresses himself back through his
[7:37] creation
[7:38] what he is in his program and we see a
[7:42] number of places where brother graham
[7:43] says the creator
[7:44] expresses himself in his creation so we
[7:47] could create something as human beings
[7:49] and in creating it it may not be an
[7:51] expression of who we are in our opinions
[7:53] or our thoughts or our desires
[7:55] it might not even express what we like
[7:57] in what we're creating
[7:59] because we could be a work for hire and
[8:00] someone said well i want you to paint
[8:02] this wall or i want you to design a
[8:03] website
[8:04] and it may be nothing like we want
[8:06] nothing like we would desire it to be
[8:08] but yet it's a work of of our own doing
[8:11] of our own efforts and our own labors
[8:12] and it could be our creation
[8:14] but it doesn't reflect who we are but
[8:16] when god created
[8:17] brother graham saying that he the very
[8:19] one who created the heaven and the earth
[8:22] is expressing himself in that creation
[8:25] in the creation and the coming forth of
[8:27] the heaven and the coming forth of the
[8:28] earth
[8:29] god is expressing himself and and we may
[8:32] not have ever thought of it that way or
[8:33] we may not take time to think about it
[8:35] we just kind of gloss over these words
[8:36] in the beginning and we know it so well
[8:38] it's kind of lost its distinction or
[8:40] meaning but god
[8:42] is expressed in the representation of
[8:44] heaven and earth
[8:46] he's portraying something about himself
[8:48] he says it what he is
[8:50] in his program so what is created
[8:52] reflects what is in god's
[8:54] mind and as brother brahm uses that word
[8:56] express express
[8:57] express it's something that's being
[8:58] squeezed out of god something that's
[9:00] coming out of god's mind and it's being
[9:02] portrayed
[9:03] and so the very first expression of god
[9:06] that we read in the scripture is
[9:08] the heaven and the earth and we looked
[9:10] at it and we can see from the teaching
[9:12] of the word of god that the heaven
[9:14] represents the supernatural
[9:15] the earth would represent the natural
[9:17] and that the heaven represents the groom
[9:19] and the earth represents the bride so
[9:22] god has already told his story he's
[9:23] already shown his hand and
[9:25] it is wrapped up in a mystery but he's
[9:27] already told us where he's going with
[9:28] this
[9:29] i am going to be expressed in groom and
[9:31] i'm going to be expressed in bride
[9:33] so the very first two things that are
[9:35] expressed in scripture
[9:36] is a heavenly bridegroom and an earthly
[9:38] bride represented by
[9:40] heaven and earth and so the covenant god
[9:43] has expressed his ambition and his
[9:44] desire in genesis chapter one
[9:47] and we we saw in the scripture how that
[9:49] there was a union
[9:50] of the heavenly and the earthly in jesus
[9:53] christ
[9:54] and brother bam talked about how that's
[9:55] when heaven and earth embraced and they
[9:57] kissed together
[9:58] and then brother branham preaches the
[9:59] invisible union of the bride of christ
[10:02] and so now he's saying that there's a
[10:03] union that's taking place today
[10:05] he says all that spiritual union of
[10:07] christ and his church now
[10:10] when the flesh is becoming word and the
[10:12] word is becoming flesh
[10:14] he says manifested vindicated so there
[10:17] was we see the word made flesh but now
[10:19] he uses it in this way the flesh is
[10:22] becoming word
[10:23] that's our privilege today we didn't
[10:25] bypass a natural act to be born we
[10:28] we came by sinful birth we came to
[10:30] natural parents and
[10:32] and so we are having an experience not
[10:34] of being word first and becoming flesh
[10:36] but being flesh but becoming word by the
[10:39] same power
[10:40] that's our promise today that's what
[10:42] we've been called to manifest today to
[10:44] be manifested
[10:45] and vindicated flesh is becoming word
[10:48] word is becoming flesh
[10:49] in that spiritual union of a heavenly
[10:52] bridegroom
[10:52] and an earthly bride and my burden
[10:56] as i pondered this and i asked myself
[10:59] many times when something's stirring in
[11:00] my heart and i'm thinking about
[11:01] something and i'm
[11:02] pondering just the direction the lord
[11:04] may be leading me in i
[11:06] try to get down to really what's the
[11:08] burden of it what's the thrust
[11:10] because we we wouldn't want to just ever
[11:12] just throw data at you
[11:14] and just leave it up to you to analyze
[11:15] it and figure it out and we just
[11:17] wouldn't want to overload you with facts
[11:18] and things that brother bannon said and
[11:20] there's times maybe you hear something
[11:23] is expressed or something in setting
[11:24] like well that's just a lot of facts
[11:26] right
[11:26] that's the facts but what does it mean
[11:28] for me what what am i supposed to get
[11:30] out of this and as i pondered it
[11:32] and just how the emphasis of the holy
[11:34] spirit i could see
[11:35] as he's driving me the the real thrust
[11:38] and burden is to see yourself
[11:40] in the beginning that if there could be
[11:42] a confidence that you can see yourself
[11:44] in the beginning
[11:46] and you can see that god had you in his
[11:48] mind when the very first thing begin to
[11:50] be set into motion then then you can
[11:52] rest in the end
[11:54] if you can see yourself in the beginning
[11:56] don't fret turn into the book of
[11:57] revelation trying to figure out where
[11:59] you are in the end
[12:00] you can just wrestle and if i was there
[12:01] in the beginning i'm going to be there
[12:03] in the end
[12:04] if he had me in his mind when he began
[12:06] to create then i'm not worried about all
[12:08] the chaos and confusion
[12:10] that exist right now i'm not worried
[12:11] about what's up and what's down what's
[12:13] in and out i'm not worried about my own
[12:14] failures and my own weaknesses
[12:16] i realize that if in the beginning i was
[12:18] represented there
[12:20] then i can have confidence he's going to
[12:21] preserve me in the end
[12:23] and we looked at how that that theme is
[12:25] just unfolds through
[12:27] genesis chapter one where we see the
[12:29] earth but then it's in void it's chaos
[12:31] it's confusion
[12:32] but all you need is the spirit of god to
[12:34] move move upon the face of the deep
[12:35] and bring order and how even oh well
[12:38] heaven and earth will pass away but no
[12:39] no it's not that it's going to be
[12:41] annihilated it's going to be renovated
[12:42] and preserved because it's a spoken word
[12:44] original attribute of god
[12:46] so we don't have to fear if you're a son
[12:49] or daughter of god you do not live under
[12:51] the fear of god saying all right
[12:52] enough's enough i'm finished with you
[12:55] and there's there's no there's no way
[12:58] that this gospel can be preached in its
[13:00] purity
[13:00] and dangle a seed of god over hell
[13:04] i you could do it to a make-believer or
[13:06] an unbeliever but that's not our
[13:08] audience
[13:09] that's not who you minister to you know
[13:10] you don't get together so you could
[13:12] dangle the unbeliever over hell
[13:13] you preach the word of god to encourage
[13:15] the believer
[13:16] because sometimes the believer thinks
[13:18] he's an unbeliever sometimes the
[13:20] believer thinks he's a make-believer so
[13:22] you preach to the believer
[13:23] and if you make the believer your
[13:25] audience the believer is like oh
[13:26] i realize now that is what i am i am a
[13:30] believer not a make-believer
[13:31] i am a believer and so that's the real
[13:35] that's the real burden i feel in the
[13:36] word and looking at this in the
[13:38] beginning it's not just to throw out
[13:40] facts or data but for you to see
[13:42] yourself in the beginning
[13:44] and brother branham says this in satan's
[13:46] eating he says when he made one of his
[13:48] attributes from his own body
[13:50] he says god has attributes in his body
[13:52] like you are an
[13:53] attribute of your father so he begins to
[13:56] look at through several statements how
[13:58] that you were an attribute in your
[13:59] father
[14:00] your father couldn't communicate with
[14:02] you he didn't know you
[14:03] i really couldn't even mentally conceive
[14:06] who you were and what you would be
[14:08] until through the process of a natural
[14:10] birth you're born
[14:11] then you become expressed then your
[14:13] father can have fellowship
[14:15] with you and and for i i've mentioned
[14:18] this before i remember whenever my
[14:20] friends would have children before i had
[14:21] my own children
[14:22] they'd have a baby and i said
[14:23] congratulations isn't this wonderful
[14:25] it's the greatest thing
[14:26] and then i finally had a child and i
[14:28] realized i had no idea what i was
[14:29] talking about it was the most empty
[14:31] congratulations ever
[14:32] because you cannot even fathom what that
[14:35] feels like or what that experience is
[14:37] until you have a child and so brother
[14:39] bam is looking at that natural dynamic
[14:41] so a lot of us can fellowship in that
[14:43] and
[14:43] understand what it is he's pointing at
[14:46] and identifying but he's saying now
[14:48] just as you were an attribute of your
[14:50] natural father he's saying you
[14:52] are an attribute of your heavenly father
[14:55] so whatever connection we might have
[14:56] with an earthly parent and realize well
[14:58] i came from them i'm a combination of
[15:00] their dna i am
[15:02] i am a magiri i'm a i'm david and leslie
[15:04] mcgeary joined together
[15:06] united together indivisibly my dna is
[15:09] intertwined with theirs and you can
[15:11] understand
[15:12] that natural relationship then think
[15:14] about what you
[15:15] are to god that god does not have
[15:18] just quote unquote offspring in the
[15:21] earth he has his own progeny he has his
[15:23] own children flesh of his flesh and bone
[15:26] of his bone
[15:27] so he says now that's the way god was in
[15:29] the beginning now he goes back to the
[15:30] beginning
[15:31] he says every son of god and every
[15:34] daughter of god was
[15:35] in god at the beginning so it says
[15:38] in the beginning god created then you
[15:40] were there with him in the beginning
[15:42] you were in him he says you don't
[15:44] remember it now
[15:46] but you were there he knowed it and he
[15:48] wanted you to become
[15:51] so he could contact you speak with you
[15:53] and love you
[15:54] and shake your hands now we're not
[15:57] looking at this as like a
[15:59] an unfolding as the dominoes fell or as
[16:02] just as
[16:03] neurons fired and dna mutated and
[16:06] different strands mutated
[16:08] and through billions of years we've
[16:09] ended up here where now
[16:11] we are what we are go back to the very
[16:13] moment where it says in the beginning
[16:15] god created what he wanted was for you
[16:18] to become
[16:20] he wanted you to become so he could
[16:22] contact you speak with you love you
[16:24] shake your hands
[16:25] so that's in him and his his desire as
[16:28] he begins to create the heaven and earth
[16:30] he has you in mind as the end goal and
[16:33] he knows everything that's going to
[16:34] happen
[16:35] he wasn't pondering oh just think about
[16:37] it in just a few more minutes there
[16:39] there's my family going to be in eden
[16:40] and i'm going to be able to shake all
[16:42] their hands and fellowship with them and
[16:43] contact them
[16:44] he knew the plan of redemption he knew
[16:46] each stage what would unfold and what
[16:48] would happen
[16:49] but he had the goal in mind the very end
[16:51] and mind
[16:52] he wanted you to become so he could
[16:54] contact you speak with you love you
[16:57] and shake your hands and then if you
[17:00] could
[17:01] just ponder this as a brief statement in
[17:03] the message knoweth it not
[17:05] he says in the beginning of the creation
[17:07] of god
[17:09] when he begin to create and bring
[17:12] you into existence so in the beginning
[17:16] of creation
[17:17] in the beginning of the creation of god
[17:18] when he begin to create
[17:20] so you have the beginning of the
[17:21] creation of god and when he begin to
[17:23] create
[17:24] and bring you into existence so that's
[17:27] the part i'm really wanting you to
[17:28] connect with that when god said in the
[17:30] beginning the bible says in the
[17:31] beginning god
[17:32] created the heaven and the earth his
[17:34] goal is to bring you into existence
[17:37] not to have a sandbox that he can play
[17:39] in not just to put all the pieces out
[17:40] there and for us to put together the
[17:42] puzzle
[17:42] but he knows the end from the beginning
[17:45] he knows what he's
[17:46] trying to accomplish he knows the
[17:47] direction he's wanting to go he says
[17:49] when god begin to create
[17:50] and bring you into existence that's what
[17:53] it means
[17:54] in the beginning god created it means to
[17:56] cause existence
[17:57] and so you are represented in this
[18:00] creation
[18:02] there's something that you as an
[18:03] individual can draw from these
[18:05] scriptures and say
[18:06] oh yeah it's the creation of the world
[18:08] it's the creation of the garden of eden
[18:10] and we can look at it that way have
[18:11] confidence in it believe it
[18:13] use it to establish our faith that by
[18:15] faith we believe that by the word of god
[18:17] the worlds were framed
[18:18] and we can hold to our conviction that
[18:21] it was god who created the heaven and
[18:22] earth it's not evolution it's not some
[18:24] kind of
[18:24] scientific process and we can use that
[18:27] but there's more to it than just
[18:29] believing god created
[18:31] what we see with our senses but also
[18:33] that in a spiritual supernatural sense
[18:35] i am represented there in this creation
[18:39] so if you want to look in genesis
[18:41] chapter 2 i want to read verses 4 to 7
[18:45] because it uses a phrase that's very
[18:47] interesting as we're looking at
[18:49] in the beginning god created the heaven
[18:51] and the earth
[18:52] now it's it's represented this way where
[18:56] it says in genesis chapter 2 verse verse
[18:58] 4
[18:59] and we'll read to verse 7 and maybe in
[19:02] just uh skip around a little bit in the
[19:04] book of genesis to look at a couple
[19:05] things
[19:06] but it says these are the generations of
[19:09] the heavens and of the earth
[19:11] when they were created in the day that
[19:13] the
[19:14] lord god made the earth and the heavens
[19:17] so he's referr he refers to himself god
[19:19] inspiring moses to write he's called in
[19:21] the beginning
[19:22] beginning god which is elohim and now
[19:25] that there's creation
[19:27] he is jehovah elohim so now he has a
[19:30] specific relationship to his creation
[19:33] so he's no longer just elohim the the a
[19:35] strong one
[19:37] elohim where he's bound by an oath or
[19:39] he's he's there
[19:40] self-existing all by himself now he's
[19:43] jehovah god
[19:44] he's jehovah elohim now he has a
[19:46] covenant he's a covenant god with his
[19:48] creation
[19:49] and he's wanting to express himself and
[19:52] says these are the generations
[19:54] of the heavens and of the earth and the
[19:57] generations it means the begetting or
[19:58] the results the
[20:00] the product of the proceedings of the
[20:02] heavens the earth it comes from the root
[20:04] to bear
[20:05] to beget or to bring forth so it's an
[20:07] interesting phrase
[20:08] these are the generations of the heavens
[20:11] and of the earth
[20:12] these are the things that were beget
[20:14] these were the things that were produced
[20:16] these were the things that were brought
[20:17] forth
[20:18] and in genesis chapter 5 verses 1 to 3
[20:23] and i want to use this so that you could
[20:25] kind of understand
[20:26] the phrasing of these are the
[20:27] generations of the heavens and earth
[20:29] you find in scripture it says these are
[20:31] the generations of something
[20:32] this is what proceeded forth from so he
[20:35] says this is the book genesis 5 1
[20:38] to verse 3. this is the book of the
[20:40] generations of adam
[20:42] in the day that god created man in the
[20:45] likeness of god
[20:46] made he him so he's telling us the
[20:49] generations of adam and that was
[20:51] proceeded forth and come forth from adam
[20:53] and then it recaptures who adam is he's
[20:56] made in the likeness of god
[20:58] and then it says male and female created
[21:00] he them
[21:01] so it's already telling us that there's
[21:03] something in the image of a man being
[21:05] both male and female
[21:06] that is also in the likeness of god that
[21:09] the image of god the expression of god
[21:11] is going to be
[21:12] male and female now if you looked at him
[21:14] then if you could see him
[21:16] you wouldn't have seen it but we know
[21:18] that he's going to become it because in
[21:19] the end he expresses himself
[21:21] not only in bridegroom but he expresses
[21:23] himself in his bride
[21:25] so the likeness of god is male and
[21:26] female so he says male and female
[21:28] created he them and blessed them
[21:30] and called their name adam that's why we
[21:32] don't have a different name
[21:34] he says in the day when they were
[21:36] created and adam lived 130 years
[21:39] and begat a son in his own likeness
[21:42] after his image
[21:43] and called his name seth so if we
[21:45] continue to read we'll see that it's
[21:47] the account of persons that are born or
[21:50] who descended from adam
[21:52] by generation until noah so these are
[21:55] the generations of adam it's those who
[21:57] came from him
[21:58] up until the point where it comes to
[22:00] noah and it's just kind of walking us
[22:02] through his genealogy
[22:03] and his lineage so the generations of
[22:06] adam are those that came from him
[22:08] and then the bible says if you want to
[22:09] look back at genesis chapter 2 verses
[22:12] verse 4 again these are the generations
[22:14] of the heaven and the earth
[22:16] so he's wanting us to think about how
[22:18] what came forth from the heavens what
[22:20] came forth from the earth
[22:21] and they were when the day that when
[22:23] they were created in the day that the
[22:25] lord god made the earth and the heavens
[22:27] verse 5 and every plant of the field
[22:30] before it was in the earth
[22:32] and every herb of the field before it
[22:34] grew
[22:35] so this i this is a the way that it's
[22:38] phrased is
[22:39] it so i find it interesting myself to
[22:42] you it may make perfect sense but i
[22:44] i kind of wrestled with it and looked at
[22:45] it and tried to understand it
[22:47] and i found that the way brother branham
[22:48] teaches the creation
[22:51] is when i find when it finally clicked
[22:52] for me is that it was all by seed
[22:55] that it came forth by seed and so
[22:57] there's one translation that says no
[22:59] shrub of the field was yet in the earth
[23:01] no herb of the field had yet sprung up
[23:04] so it's saying that they hadn't been
[23:06] expressed but yet they were already in
[23:08] there the plant and the herb were
[23:09] already in the earth
[23:11] in seed form by the spoken word of god
[23:14] but as of yet they hadn't
[23:15] had expression yet so it says these are
[23:18] the generations of the heaven and earth
[23:19] every plant of the field before it was
[23:21] in the earth every herb of the field
[23:22] before it grew
[23:23] for the lord god had not caused it to
[23:25] rain upon the earth and there was not a
[23:27] man to till the ground
[23:28] but there went up a mist from the earth
[23:30] and watered the whole face of the ground
[23:32] we know that the rain did not come
[23:34] until the days of noah then it says and
[23:36] the lord god
[23:38] formed man from the dust of the ground
[23:41] and breathed into his nostrils the
[23:43] breath of life and man became
[23:46] a living soul so these are the
[23:48] generations of the heavens and of the
[23:50] earth
[23:52] every plant every herb and then it says
[23:55] that god for men from the dust
[23:58] of the earth so he brings man he forms
[24:01] he doesn't create but he forms as like a
[24:02] potter with clay he brings man forth
[24:05] from the same earth
[24:07] the same earth that has the seed of the
[24:09] herb the same earth
[24:10] that has the seed of the plant and
[24:13] there's some in
[24:14] jewish tradition in jewish theology they
[24:16] look at that duality of the planned
[24:18] herb of representing of even of the
[24:20] duality of the messiah you have the
[24:22] plant and the herb
[24:23] so here you have two seeds expressed in
[24:25] the earth and it says he's gonna bring
[24:26] forth
[24:27] man from the earth so it's not just
[24:30] plant it's not just herb but also man
[24:32] comes from the earth
[24:33] and all the elements for man's body were
[24:36] in the earth
[24:37] so the generations of the heaven and
[24:39] earth there's plants that come forth
[24:41] there's herb that comes forth and even
[24:43] man himself
[24:44] is going to come forth from the earth
[24:47] and brother battle makes this statement
[24:48] in future home
[24:50] of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[24:52] earthly bride that's his title i didn't
[24:53] amend it
[24:54] but he called it the future home which
[24:57] is going to be a new heavens and new
[24:58] earth and he calls it of
[25:00] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[25:02] bride and the very first
[25:04] image we have in scripture is heaven and
[25:06] earth
[25:07] it's always it's been it's been
[25:09] foreshadowing been representing
[25:10] your place and your position with christ
[25:12] and who he is so he says the earth holds
[25:15] those things he's talking about all the
[25:17] perversion the sickness the sin the
[25:19] all the all the nasty things that are in
[25:21] the world today the earth holds those
[25:23] things
[25:23] but it wasn't made for that purpose sin
[25:26] caused it to be like that
[25:28] it was made by god the creator
[25:31] and he and if he's creating something
[25:33] he's expressing himself in it
[25:35] and i'm going to read several statements
[25:38] that track
[25:39] this thought just for emphasis you
[25:41] realize wow brother branham said it that
[25:42] many times
[25:43] there's something to what he's saying
[25:45] and he says
[25:46] all of our bodies that we live in now
[25:49] was put on the earth when god created it
[25:52] because you were out of the dust of the
[25:54] earth it was all laid out here
[25:57] so he says god the creator the earth was
[26:00] made
[26:01] the earth holds things that are wicked
[26:02] now
[26:04] can we all say amen to that the earth
[26:06] holds things that are wicked now
[26:07] if anybody thinks laodicea is over just
[26:09] open your eyes you know
[26:10] just look around laodicea's healthy but
[26:13] if anybody doesn't believe in the bright
[26:14] age just look around
[26:17] the bride is healthy she's here and so
[26:19] we see laodicea holds all these wicked
[26:21] things
[26:22] he says but that's not why the earth was
[26:23] made the earth wasn't made to be a
[26:25] cesspool
[26:25] the earth wasn't made to hold all the
[26:27] things that are in it that are in it now
[26:29] so he brings it back to its original
[26:31] purpose he says god the creator
[26:33] and the very first thing he hits on he's
[26:35] looking at the world and how perverted
[26:36] it was
[26:37] and he begins to bring in our mind that
[26:38] it was made by god and i
[26:40] i believe that he's emphasizing that it
[26:42] would the purpose of it
[26:44] it wasn't the purpose of the earth
[26:45] wasn't to hold sin
[26:47] god made it for purpose and the very
[26:49] first thing he identifies as all of our
[26:51] bodies that we live in now
[26:52] were put on earth when god created it
[26:54] because you were the dust of the earth
[26:56] he says it was all laid out here
[26:58] when god himself created it you were in
[27:01] his thinking
[27:03] and in him the great eternal was the
[27:05] thought which is his attribute
[27:07] and now sin caused all of this to happen
[27:10] so everything we see in the world now
[27:12] god says brother man saying sin caused
[27:14] all this to happen he says and god
[27:15] through this age is gathering up his
[27:18] material
[27:19] so you could somehow think of it in this
[27:22] way
[27:22] that when god made the earth when he
[27:25] made the heaven and the earth
[27:26] you were in his thinking so he's
[27:28] projecting something
[27:30] into creation but now brother branham
[27:31] says he's laid you
[27:33] in there somehow i'm not going to
[27:35] pretend to
[27:36] diagram to you and say oh brother aaron
[27:38] has a projector maybe he'll give us a
[27:39] slide on how this worked i'm not going
[27:41] to try to tell you how it worked
[27:42] i'm just going to tell you what he said
[27:44] i'm just going to tell you what brother
[27:45] branham said and then just let the holy
[27:47] spirit quicken to you
[27:48] maybe just all those logistics but it's
[27:50] something only god could do
[27:52] only god could sow things into earth and
[27:54] in the dust and then thousands of years
[27:56] later perhaps billions of years later
[27:58] gather up his material in this last day
[28:01] where when was it first laid out it was
[28:02] laid out when he created it but now in
[28:04] this age
[28:05] he's gathering up his material what's
[28:06] going to be that final gathering that
[28:08] meeting in the air the change of our
[28:09] bodies
[28:10] a theophany and a glorified body coming
[28:12] together earthly and heavenly everything
[28:14] quickened together
[28:15] and god is gathering up his material
[28:17] that he had already laid out
[28:20] and so we we must see the divine purpose
[28:23] that we must see god's create god's
[28:26] predestinated program
[28:28] and be absolutely convinced of it i it
[28:31] it's it's
[28:32] it's it's hard and maybe maybe i could
[28:34] express it this way
[28:35] sometimes we waver in in the natural
[28:37] life in the present tense
[28:39] and things happen and things don't go
[28:40] the way that we wanted them to and
[28:42] we we we suffer loss and we endure great
[28:46] pain and rejection
[28:47] and and through it we sometimes we we
[28:49] try to filter that and we try to resolve
[28:51] it why is this happening try to figure
[28:52] it out
[28:53] and sometimes we just think oh well
[28:54] maybe i deserve this and maybe i'm
[28:56] reaping what i sow and god's after me
[28:58] and then we get in this state of well
[29:00] maybe i've just been make-believing all
[29:02] the time this time and maybe i'm just
[29:03] pretending
[29:04] lord am i in the right place lord am i
[29:06] even seed am i even elect i see
[29:08] things falling apart and this person
[29:10] fall away in my next and you get in this
[29:12] state of
[29:12] uneasiness all because you're dwelling
[29:14] in the present tense
[29:16] and then i guess present could be bad
[29:18] enough then we just add in all the
[29:19] decades of the same kind of thinking
[29:21] and it just has a way of compounding but
[29:24] if i could
[29:24] try to express it this way not so much
[29:27] try to convince you that everything's
[29:28] okay now
[29:29] but convince you that you're absolutely
[29:32] tied to the eternal
[29:33] all the way back then so that whatever
[29:36] may be now whatever's unsettling now
[29:38] whatever shaking out you could just
[29:39] somehow transcend the present tense
[29:42] and stick your finger in eternity and
[29:43] say no i'm tied to something greater
[29:45] than all this
[29:46] well you had decades of this and ins and
[29:48] outs and ups and downs decades and
[29:49] decades and decades say
[29:50] well none of that matters i'm going to
[29:52] transcend all that but where and where
[29:54] i'm at today
[29:55] i'm connected with something divine i'm
[29:57] connected with something eternal
[30:01] so we must see the divine purpose
[30:04] because god was intentional
[30:06] in his creation he was he was more it
[30:09] was more than just
[30:11] a god throwing things out there and i i
[30:15] see it uh
[30:15] i've seen i don't mean to stumble
[30:18] anybody but i've seen a youtube video
[30:21] and uh i saw and you see some of these
[30:24] youtube videos where people are creating
[30:25] stuff
[30:26] and they're just putting a cake pan on a
[30:28] string poking a hole in it and just
[30:31] throwing it out there and it does a
[30:32] little pattern it does a bunch of stuff
[30:33] and everybody's like
[30:35] that's amazing how did you do that well
[30:37] i tied a paint can to a string
[30:39] and i poked a hole in it and i just
[30:40] started spinning it around the room and
[30:42] it created this pattern
[30:43] and they'll just take it however it
[30:45] comes and i'm sure there's some artists
[30:47] out there good enough to understand the
[30:48] science behind swinging a paint can on a
[30:50] string
[30:51] and they know exactly what they're
[30:52] trying to produce but this god isn't
[30:54] just throwing things out there and
[30:55] seeing what sticks
[30:56] he didn't have all these names in a hat
[30:58] and throw them out there and say
[30:59] whichever ones turn up those are the
[31:00] ones i'm going to redeem
[31:02] god was very intentional in his creation
[31:06] and put and make this uh part of your
[31:08] understanding of god he's a god of
[31:10] purpose
[31:10] he's a god who's intent he's a god who
[31:13] has an ambition and he has a desire
[31:15] and he's focused he's a god of focus who
[31:17] never varies from that
[31:19] there's many things that god will allow
[31:21] to happen but god will never allow
[31:23] anything to happen that would upset his
[31:25] program
[31:26] that would upset his goal that it would
[31:27] change his goal and he'd have to
[31:29] recalibrate say oh you know what i
[31:30] wanted to have a bride of my own
[31:31] choosing
[31:32] but i think i'm just going to have to
[31:33] have something else or do something else
[31:34] know god
[31:35] is very purposeful very intentional with
[31:37] his creation
[31:38] and sin did not upset his ambition
[31:42] if we understand through the word of god
[31:45] that it actually furthered his ambition
[31:46] because now
[31:47] god can express himself had god created
[31:50] a perfect eden and all of us came forth
[31:52] in a perfect eden
[31:53] there would be attributes of the divine
[31:55] that we would never experience
[31:56] we would never know that god was a
[31:58] healer and could you imagine let's just
[32:00] say we've all been in the garden of eden
[32:01] for billions of years and one day god
[32:03] comes
[32:03] his voice comes walking in the garden
[32:05] and he wants to say to you brother
[32:06] frankie
[32:07] i'm a healer and you'd be like he'll
[32:09] heal or what's a healer
[32:10] what does that even mean well there's
[32:12] this concept or idea
[32:13] idea of being sick sick what is sick
[32:15] mean
[32:17] he wouldn't even be able to express he
[32:18] wouldn't be able to tell you
[32:20] what these attributes so what he had to
[32:22] do brother brandon even said it was
[32:23] necessary
[32:24] for god to pre-decimate a man who needed
[32:27] saving
[32:28] in order for god to have reason to be
[32:31] so in order for god god exists by
[32:33] himself
[32:35] he's a self-existent one he was before
[32:37] us he was before everything so he
[32:39] existed
[32:40] but now he wants a reason to exist and
[32:43] in order to give himself a reason to
[32:45] exist he needed to predestinate you
[32:47] as a sinner so don't let the devil beat
[32:49] you up if you were a sinner
[32:51] anybody here not being beat up because
[32:52] they weren't a sinner
[32:54] all of us were sinners and so we can't
[32:57] we don't let the devil beat us up say
[32:58] listen
[32:59] the fact that i had failed him the fact
[33:01] that i was born in sin
[33:02] the fact that sin laid in me from the
[33:04] beginning gave god
[33:05] reason to exist so i'm not gonna let
[33:08] anything in my life be used as a tool
[33:11] to separate me from god all things are
[33:13] working together
[33:14] because i want to look through it
[33:15] through the prism of the word of god i'm
[33:17] going to look it through god's eyes and
[33:18] how god has ordained us
[33:19] and i'm going to be confident that the
[33:21] fact that god allowed me to come
[33:23] through that channel gave him a reason
[33:26] to exist
[33:27] didn't cause him to exist because he's
[33:29] god but it gave him reason and purpose
[33:31] of being
[33:31] given reason to exist by predestining a
[33:34] man who needed salvation
[33:36] so sin doesn't upset his ambition sin
[33:38] didn't upset his goal
[33:39] it actually furthered it to where he
[33:41] would be able to express himself
[33:42] so now i'm going to read a number of
[33:44] statements to you
[33:46] in this this vein or channel of brother
[33:49] bannon saying
[33:50] that all of our bodies were laid out in
[33:52] the earth
[33:53] and if at any point you get it and you
[33:55] want me to move on just say amen if i
[33:57] don't move on you just amen louder
[33:59] and and soon there'll just be a roar of
[34:01] a man's and everybody think wow that
[34:03] must have been
[34:03] a pretty exciting quote i wasn't really
[34:05] picking up what he was laying down there
[34:07] but i'm going to read them i'm going to
[34:08] go through them because i think it's
[34:09] important to establish them
[34:11] and he says this and what does it take
[34:13] to make a christian life
[34:15] i love to ponder that he's going to make
[34:17] a christian life what does it take it
[34:19] takes the right kind of material
[34:21] he said let's take before there were
[34:22] there in the beginning of the world
[34:25] he says now the lily come from the earth
[34:28] we can all agree on that and he says so
[34:31] did you
[34:32] if that be so then we were here
[34:35] our bodies were on the earth before
[34:37] there was any life here
[34:40] and he says it this way same message our
[34:42] bodies
[34:43] were laying spread out on this earth
[34:45] before there was any type of life on the
[34:47] earth
[34:49] potash calcium petroleum cosmic light
[34:51] was here at the creation
[34:53] as the volcanic was thrown out they tell
[34:55] us that bursted
[34:56] and formed the materials of the earth
[34:58] and so forth it was just a burning
[35:00] brimstone as it was satan's possession
[35:02] as he
[35:02] walked up and down the fiery brimstone
[35:04] of the earth and then when god cooled it
[35:07] off and said it over there in his great
[35:09] mind
[35:10] now even in that language brother bram
[35:13] describes the earth as satan walking
[35:15] upon the face of the earth in time when
[35:16] it was just belching and it was this
[35:18] fluid mass of confusion
[35:20] no discernible land just maybe lava and
[35:22] satan's walking on it and satan's
[35:24] thinking i got this this is mine
[35:26] but god has a different program so even
[35:28] if you think he got to you first and
[35:30] walked all over your life don't worry
[35:32] god's got you
[35:33] god's got a different program just let
[35:35] the spirit of god move upon your heart
[35:36] move upon your life
[35:38] and kick satan right off that possession
[35:40] right off of that land
[35:41] and bring order into your soul bring
[35:43] order into your life so he says
[35:44] when god cooled it off and said it over
[35:46] there in his great mind he had
[35:48] something in his mind that he was going
[35:50] to do
[35:52] again god is doing this with purpose
[35:54] with intent he had something in his mind
[35:56] that he's going to do and he's saying
[35:58] all your bodies were laid out
[35:59] out here in the earth then the message
[36:01] mark of the beast and the seal of god
[36:04] god's a great contractor a great
[36:06] contractor always lays out all his stuff
[36:09] when he builds
[36:10] his subdivision god when he was moving
[36:12] the earth around creating calcium potash
[36:14] and petroleum and so forth
[36:16] he was laying our bodies on the earth
[36:18] right then
[36:19] the material that we're made out of and
[36:22] the great holy spirit went out from god
[36:23] to brood over the earth or coo
[36:26] make love like a hen her brood he began
[36:28] to brood
[36:29] over the earth really just enter into
[36:31] this language that brother bam is using
[36:33] there's a place i may read here in a
[36:34] little bit where brethren gets emotional
[36:37] thinking about this process to where
[36:39] this is god
[36:40] not it's just not a mass of chemicals
[36:43] there's it represents something precious
[36:45] to him
[36:46] something special and he said he as a
[36:48] hen would brood over
[36:49] uh her brood and and coo to it
[36:52] god making love to the earth and
[36:54] brooding over and i can see some calcium
[36:56] coming running down a little place
[36:58] mixing up with some moisture and potash
[37:00] and a little easter flower come out and
[37:02] i can hear him say come here father look
[37:04] at this very good keep on brooding
[37:06] after a while brewed a little more and
[37:08] what comes next was probably the flowers
[37:10] and the vegetations and the birds flew
[37:12] out of the dust of the earth
[37:13] and then come the animal life and kept
[37:15] getting higher life higher life higher
[37:16] life higher life
[37:18] until finally a man come up in the very
[37:20] image of god
[37:21] it's it's all in the earth this isn't a
[37:23] magician's trick where god just has a
[37:25] hat over there and
[37:26] brings a lily out of a hat but he's
[37:28] bringing it out of the earth he's
[37:30] bringing it forth
[37:30] from substance that laid in there and
[37:33] then
[37:34] so brother branham says it again this
[37:35] way in super sign god the great
[37:37] contractor
[37:38] had all the bodies laid out here on the
[37:40] earth of calcium potash petroleum
[37:42] he was going to create it and make it
[37:45] but she bypassed the way of god
[37:48] the woman did he says what did adam do
[37:50] when he come to his wife when he come to
[37:52] her
[37:52] he found her pregnant of an evil her own
[37:54] conception
[37:55] had received foul seed now it's kind of
[37:58] a very stark way for brother brahm to
[38:02] inject this into this thought you have
[38:03] god the great contractor that creates
[38:05] the earth
[38:06] and then everything's laying in there in
[38:07] this beautiful seed form adam and the
[38:09] woman under a commandment
[38:10] he says but before adam could come to
[38:12] her she was already fallen
[38:15] and so the first woman had fallen then
[38:16] he says jehovah before he could marry
[38:19] his wife did the same thing so now he's
[38:21] actually talking about the church
[38:23] so you see a fall in genesis now you see
[38:25] a fall in the in the new testament
[38:27] he says and she organized herself and
[38:29] become the roman catholic church jesus
[38:31] before he could get to his bride
[38:32] she'd organized herself and become the
[38:34] roman catholic church same thing
[38:36] but he will have a bride don't you worry
[38:39] that will be bought with his word just
[38:40] exactly what he told eve to stay with
[38:42] he will have a church amen that will be
[38:45] bought by
[38:46] his word he will have it regardless of
[38:49] what has transpired
[38:50] what has fallen what has been up and
[38:52] down he will have a bride that's been
[38:54] bought by his word
[38:55] because god as a great contractor had
[38:58] already laid out the materials
[39:00] for it and there's nothing that can
[39:01] intervene and disrupt his plan
[39:04] to achieve a bride to himself in the
[39:07] message faith of abraham my body was
[39:09] laying on the earth before there was
[39:10] anything at all
[39:12] ever on the earth when the holy spirit
[39:14] went forth before god to brood over the
[39:16] earth like that
[39:17] a brood means to coo like a dove or a
[39:19] hen mother when there was nothing but
[39:20] volcanic eruptions
[39:22] when god moved his old star around the
[39:24] sun making potash and calcium
[39:26] he was like a great contractor laying
[39:29] out the lumber to build houses
[39:32] where we were here then our bodies was
[39:35] on the earth right then it's god is
[39:39] creed in the earth god has in his mind
[39:41] this is very supernatural
[39:43] it it to me it's beyond how i could
[39:46] grasp how he would do this but just
[39:47] accept that it's the divine
[39:49] and it reminds even tommy how you might
[39:50] have rotated around the sun as these
[39:52] things are spinning
[39:53] and these things are orbiting these
[39:55] things are coming together he's
[39:56] laying out our bodies in the earth
[40:00] he says like a great contractor laying
[40:02] out lumber to build houses
[40:04] he's still using his materials today
[40:08] that's the way we should look at our our
[40:10] babies when they're born thank you god
[40:12] you're still using you're still using
[40:14] your material
[40:17] and then we we use the phrase often
[40:19] maybe it's associated with with death
[40:21] but
[40:22] from dust thou come from dust out shout
[40:24] return and it's drawn from the
[40:26] scriptures in ecclesiastes chapter 12
[40:28] verse 7
[40:29] then shall the dust return to the earth
[40:31] as it was
[40:32] and the spirit shall return unto god who
[40:34] gave it we're looking at the individual
[40:36] the spirit will return unto god the body
[40:39] that the dust of the earth the flesh
[40:41] will return to the earth and why it's
[40:43] saying the flesh the body
[40:44] came from the dust of the earth psalms
[40:46] 104 29 thou hidest thy face
[40:49] they are troubled thou takest away their
[40:52] breath
[40:53] they die in return to their dust
[40:56] the bible is very plain about this we
[40:58] come from the dust of the earth
[41:00] our our flesh it comes from the very
[41:02] makeup of the of the earth
[41:04] and brother branham says in the
[41:05] beginning if we come from the dust of
[41:07] the earth our bodies laid on this earth
[41:09] at the beginning i know i'm just
[41:12] emphasizing it over and over again and
[41:13] your amens haven't gotten louder so i'm
[41:15] just going to have to read all of them
[41:17] but he's emphasizing something they say
[41:18] look our bodies are all laid out here
[41:20] it's not just a casual thought where he
[41:22] says it one time
[41:23] and we're trying to make more out of it
[41:24] than than he meant to but he's trying to
[41:26] lay this thought out there all of our
[41:28] bodies laid here on earth he was laying
[41:30] out our bodies on earth
[41:31] right then and he's not saying in just
[41:33] some haphazard sense
[41:34] or well it's just it's all the same
[41:36] massive chemicals anyways
[41:37] he says like a great contractor who's
[41:39] laying out lumber for houses
[41:41] we were there then our audit bodies were
[41:44] on earth
[41:44] right then he says
[41:47] if we come from the dust of the earth
[41:49] which the bible says we did and also
[41:51] science says we come from the dust of
[41:52] the earth then surely
[41:53] our bodies was laying on this earth when
[41:56] this was yet a volcanic eruption
[41:58] without a speck of life this is from ye
[42:00] must be born again our bodies before
[42:02] there was even
[42:04] even the earth was finished being formed
[42:06] our bodies that we're living in right
[42:08] now
[42:08] was laying on the earth in the beginning
[42:11] god created the earth
[42:14] right then put a period on it
[42:17] start the clock flip the pages on the
[42:20] calendar
[42:20] let the years unfold tell me however you
[42:23] want in scientific terms how many
[42:25] billions of years old
[42:26] this earth is maybe if they knew the
[42:28] right test they'd be able to tell that
[42:30] our bodies are also billions of years
[42:31] old
[42:32] but it's saying it's it was already laid
[42:34] in there it was already in the earth
[42:36] from that very moment
[42:37] in thirsting of turning on the light he
[42:40] says this is a very rich statement here
[42:41] he says
[42:42] no life can come outside of light light
[42:44] produces
[42:45] light produces life there can be no life
[42:48] outside of light natural or spiritual
[42:50] there must be
[42:51] and only light can come by the word of
[42:53] god so
[42:54] you can you have to have light to have
[42:56] life and light can only come by the word
[42:59] those principles that he lays out in
[43:01] shalom turn on the light in those
[43:02] different places only light can come by
[43:04] the word of god
[43:05] god's word is the light when it's
[43:06] manifested
[43:08] so life comes by light light comes by
[43:11] the word and the word
[43:12] is light when it's manifested it's just
[43:14] a seedling here
[43:16] as god planted all the seeds
[43:19] we could recognize this with herb and
[43:21] plant but then he says our bodies was on
[43:24] the earth before there was any life here
[43:25] or anything the calcium potash petroleum
[43:28] cosmic like whatever cosmic light
[43:30] whatever it was
[43:31] it was here when god created the earth
[43:35] it only taken his spoken word to bring
[43:37] it into existence
[43:39] just like it did botany or tree life
[43:41] what or whatever life there
[43:42] is to be so it takes the spoken word to
[43:46] bring it into existence
[43:47] just like you did botany life a tree
[43:49] life whatever it might be
[43:50] it takes the spoken word of god which
[43:52] the word manifested as light
[43:55] and it takes light to bring life he's
[43:56] saying every seed was laying there
[43:58] it took light to bring it forth even
[44:01] describes it one place they're all
[44:02] laying there and there was just maybe
[44:03] the earth was shrouded the sun was
[44:05] always shining but it took the word of
[44:07] god to push back the clouds
[44:09] to allow the light to strike the seed
[44:11] and then it could burst forth
[44:12] and in that we see a type of ourselves
[44:14] wandering in sin one and in darkness but
[44:16] then the preach of the word drives back
[44:18] the clouds and allows the light of god's
[44:20] gospel
[44:20] to shine upon the seed and immediately
[44:22] we burst forth
[44:24] where was that seed all the time it was
[44:26] there all the time
[44:28] he says his spoken word brings it into
[44:30] existence
[44:31] god planted all the seeds and he says
[44:34] our bodies were on earth right then
[44:36] just like anything else and it's the
[44:39] spoken word that brings things into
[44:40] existence
[44:42] so now in the message impersonation of
[44:44] christianity
[44:46] he says they talking about bodies he
[44:48] says must have been here when the earth
[44:50] was made because they were taken from
[44:51] the earth they were here when the earth
[44:53] was made our bodies were here before the
[44:55] earth was made for we are
[44:56] of the earth all that we are made of is
[44:59] calcium potash petroleum cosmic light
[45:02] atoms holding us together and somehow by
[45:04] some mastermind
[45:06] we were made thus what we are
[45:08] attributing it to the divine to his
[45:10] divine purpose
[45:11] not just heaping together potash and
[45:13] calcium and petroleum
[45:14] but something got into the inside and
[45:18] begin to create
[45:19] and i was made thus he's attributing
[45:21] divine purpose
[45:23] divine intent not as science would want
[45:25] us to believe that this is just the
[45:26] result of
[45:28] of a misfire that took billions of years
[45:30] to unfold it says
[45:31] the reason why creation is so complex
[45:33] today is it evolved over so many
[45:35] billions of years where just this blob
[45:37] was sitting there
[45:37] and finally something mutated and i said
[45:40] just it was just randomness
[45:41] it's just probabilities give something a
[45:43] billion years and all of a sudden it's
[45:44] going to fire off a a foot or something
[45:47] and that's just the way that they look
[45:48] at it it's just really all here
[45:50] scientifically
[45:51] by uh by the lottery but he said no it's
[45:53] not just a blob
[45:54] together but there was a mastermind
[45:56] behind it something got inside and began
[45:58] to create and i was made
[46:00] thus and then he brings it back to the
[46:02] very beginning in the beginning the holy
[46:04] spirit began to brood over a bleak
[46:06] desert
[46:07] excuse my emotions this is where brother
[46:10] brown begins to get very emotional about
[46:11] this thought
[46:12] imagine a bleak desert and that might
[46:14] not be hard for some of us to do
[46:15] just imagine a bleak desert but now the
[46:18] holy spirit's gonna
[46:19] brood over it excuse my emotions but
[46:22] when there was
[46:22] nothing and have never been nothing but
[46:25] the holy spirit was sent from god not to
[46:28] intellectual but the holy spirit was
[46:30] sent from the presence of god to make
[46:32] love
[46:32] over the earth and as it was he
[46:35] stretched his big
[46:36] big wings around the earth and began to
[46:38] make love or to brood
[46:39] coo over the earth and i could see
[46:41] calcium and potter's coming together
[46:43] and begin to and and in a little easter
[46:47] lily stood up
[46:48] the holy spirit brewed it out of the
[46:51] earth
[46:52] and he kept brooding and as he cooed and
[46:53] brewed i began to see trees come
[46:56] up birds began to fly from the earth
[46:58] animals began to walk
[46:59] and then he kept cooing and man came up
[47:02] called adam isn't that beautiful
[47:06] now go ahead if you want to run ahead of
[47:09] me a good 30 minutes go ahead and just
[47:11] think about the implications
[47:12] for you today what god is doing by the
[47:16] preaching of the word what god is doing
[47:18] by bringing his presence near
[47:19] what does god do when the presence falls
[47:21] in a church service it's not to
[47:23] vindicate the piano
[47:24] piano player it doesn't vindicate the
[47:26] special that was sung it's not for the
[47:28] purpose that you could go back and watch
[47:29] it on youtube and say man that was
[47:31] dynamic
[47:32] it's god trying to draw something out of
[47:34] you
[47:35] it's god trying to cultivate something
[47:37] in your life it's god trying to make a
[47:38] difference in your home life
[47:40] make a difference in your thought
[47:41] process why it's god the holy spirit
[47:44] brooding it out of your own earth
[47:48] he kept brooding until a man came up he
[47:50] says and he immediately says
[47:52] and adam looked lonesome so he made a
[47:54] byproduct for him
[47:56] and took a rib from his side now how
[47:58] could god
[48:00] look at adam and since loneliness
[48:03] how could god look at a man by himself
[48:06] in a domain in a kingdom in
[48:07] earth the highest of all it evoluted up
[48:10] to that man was the highest upon earth
[48:11] how could god look at that which is good
[48:14] and say it's not good
[48:15] unless he knew in the reflection
[48:19] that there was more to be expressed
[48:22] and so he looks at him and he says he's
[48:24] lonesome so he made a byproduct of him
[48:26] and took a rib from his side and made
[48:28] him a sweetheart
[48:29] eve and he loved adam and he loved
[48:33] eve portraying now as this brooding
[48:37] continued
[48:38] holy spirit working over these materials
[48:40] and these elements of the earth he took
[48:41] woman from adam and adam was
[48:44] from the earth adam came from the earth
[48:49] and now adam being having his body made
[48:52] up from the elements of the earth
[48:54] now from that same body god takes and
[48:57] brings forth a woman
[48:58] she's not another creation she's from
[49:00] the same elements that adam was
[49:02] and what is he doing he's showing his
[49:04] great purpose
[49:06] god is portraying you in the very
[49:08] beginning you have the earth
[49:10] adam comes out of the earth and then out
[49:12] of adam comes his wife
[49:14] he's portraying his great purpose
[49:16] brother branham in the message paradox
[49:18] he says this
[49:19] he says what's the most important thing
[49:21] in the world
[49:23] anybody want to take a guess what's the
[49:24] most important thing in the world
[49:26] well so as to not embarrass anybody and
[49:28] we might we might start naming places we
[49:30] like to eat or
[49:31] the fact that football season finally
[49:33] started i don't know what what we might
[49:35] say but
[49:35] it says it's god's church
[49:38] god made the earth he made it for a
[49:41] purpose
[49:42] to take a church out of it a bride
[49:46] so the most important thing in the world
[49:48] is god's bride
[49:49] because god made the earth for the
[49:51] purpose of getting the bride out of it
[49:53] he says and that's the most important
[49:55] job in the world
[49:56] the most important job in the world is
[49:59] getting a bride
[50:00] out of the earth the most important job
[50:03] there is is to take out of the earth a
[50:05] bride of his own choosing
[50:07] a bride of his own desire a bride that
[50:09] would match what's in his heart
[50:11] that's the most important thing in the
[50:12] world is god's bride
[50:14] he made the earth for a purpose he made
[50:16] it to take a bride out of it
[50:19] so now if we could if we can somehow
[50:22] tempt you with the home stretch
[50:25] and begin to think well he may be
[50:27] finishing here soon
[50:28] i want to i want to take us back now
[50:32] to what we were looking at in genesis
[50:33] chapter 2 where he said the generations
[50:36] of the heaven and of the earth
[50:38] and then we looked at how he talked
[50:39] about the generations of adam
[50:41] so the generations of the heaven and
[50:43] earth is expressed in
[50:45] plant and herb and even man itself
[50:48] coming forth from the earth
[50:50] and then in genesis chapter five it says
[50:51] these are the generations of adam and it
[50:53] begins to tell the generations of adam
[50:55] beginning with seth
[50:56] all the way to know these are the ones
[50:57] that were beget from him and come forth
[50:59] from him
[51:00] and then brother brennan makes this
[51:01] statement
[51:03] and as we're as we're pondering this
[51:06] and we're maybe going back to last
[51:07] sunday and how that we
[51:10] we recognize that with heaven and earth
[51:12] there was an affinity and there was a
[51:14] union in the beginning god created the
[51:15] heavens and the earth
[51:16] they're represented together in creation
[51:19] and then in christ jesus when he comes
[51:21] we he's recognized as a man you being a
[51:24] man not over 50. he
[51:25] he walks his man he eats his man he's
[51:27] born of a woman even as the scripture
[51:29] says
[51:29] yet we realize there's deity that's the
[51:31] blood of god that's flowing through
[51:33] those veins
[51:34] but at the jordan river when the dove
[51:36] descends upon christ
[51:38] and that's when the father and the son
[51:40] unite in this union
[51:42] and brother man says that was the
[51:43] greatest event this world
[51:45] world has ever seen and will see until
[51:48] christ
[51:48] and the church have united together
[51:50] again so that was the greatest event
[51:53] until
[51:54] now until right now so the greatest
[51:57] event this world had ever seen
[51:59] now this is unfolding where we see now
[52:01] in the spiritual union of christ and his
[52:03] church he says that is when god and man
[52:05] became one when
[52:06] at the jordan river the dove coming
[52:08] descended upon that body descended upon
[52:10] his son
[52:11] that's when god and made became one
[52:13] heaven and earth embraced each other and
[52:15] kissed each other
[52:16] that's a union that's adjoining together
[52:19] he says that's the greatest event this
[52:21] world's ever seen
[52:22] until now and let me just express this
[52:26] as it burns in my heart
[52:28] that when you think about how the whole
[52:30] world is groaning for the
[52:32] manifestation of sons viewing it in this
[52:34] way
[52:35] and falling in this path of this
[52:36] storyline you begin to see this earth
[52:38] all along has been pregnant and has been
[52:41] wanting to birth
[52:42] has been wanting to usher forth has been
[52:44] wanting to be
[52:45] under its rightful ruler and to be what
[52:47] it was intended to be in the beginning
[52:50] do you realize the earth didn't sin in
[52:52] the fall but yet it was cursed
[52:55] and so it's a little groaning for the
[52:57] manifestations of sons
[52:58] the world the greatest event the world
[53:00] had ever seen was in that jordan river
[53:02] now it's you it's experiencing
[53:04] and seeing the union once again so it's
[53:06] it's under anticipation
[53:08] it's under expectation right now the
[53:09] earth is groaning for a millennium it's
[53:12] groaning for the manifestation of sons
[53:15] and so in christ humanity and divinity
[53:17] were united
[53:19] the word was made flesh he's a god man
[53:22] he's not just merely a man
[53:24] but he's a god man and so the bible
[53:27] expresses him this way first corinthians
[53:29] chapter 15
[53:30] verses 45 to 49 and so it it is written
[53:34] the first man adam was made a living
[53:37] soul
[53:38] the last adam was made a quickening
[53:40] spirit
[53:41] that's the last atom you don't have a
[53:43] third atom that's the last atom
[53:45] you can't try to twist the word of god
[53:47] to come up with another atom that's the
[53:49] last atom
[53:50] otherwise we might as well just throw
[53:51] the word out because language doesn't
[53:52] have any meaning anymore
[53:54] he says so it was written the first man
[53:56] was made a living soul the last adam was
[53:58] made a quickening spirit
[53:59] how be it that was not first which is
[54:01] spiritual but that which is natural
[54:03] and afterward that which is spiritual
[54:06] the first man
[54:06] is of the earth earthy the second man is
[54:09] the
[54:10] lord from heaven and as the earthy
[54:13] as is the earthy such are they also that
[54:17] are earthy
[54:18] and as is the heavenly such are they
[54:20] also that are heavenly
[54:23] and as we have born if if that if that
[54:26] verse
[54:27] if that you get lost in that verse just
[54:29] read the next one because it's just
[54:30] going to resolve everything
[54:31] and as we have borne the image of the
[54:33] earthy we shall also bear the image of
[54:36] the heavenly
[54:38] so the first man is of the earth we all
[54:40] say amen to that we identify with it we
[54:41] understand it we get it we're earthy
[54:43] we're grounded to this earth we
[54:44] associate with this earth we have
[54:46] earthly
[54:47] uh everything's earthly none of us were
[54:49] born on mars
[54:52] pretty confident in saying that at least
[54:54] not yet
[54:56] so we we all identify with the world we
[54:58] identify with the earth he says the
[55:00] first man that's your first birth that's
[55:01] your
[55:01] that's what you identify with but then
[55:03] and so this he says but the second man
[55:05] now he's referring to christ
[55:07] the last adam was a quickening spirit
[55:09] but now he has an
[55:10] image of the heavenly but then he makes
[55:13] this beautiful statement and as if we
[55:15] have borne the
[55:15] image of the earthy we shall also bear
[55:18] the image of the heavenly
[55:21] even though you may be bowed down with
[55:23] earthiness even though you may be bowed
[55:24] down with worldliness even though you
[55:26] may seem to be so
[55:27] connected with this earth you will also
[55:30] bear the image
[55:31] of the heavenly and you are right now
[55:34] called to express
[55:35] the image of god amen right now though
[55:37] you may be an
[55:38] earthly body it's your table today it's
[55:40] your calling today
[55:42] it is your mission today to express the
[55:44] attributes of the divine
[55:46] to express the attributes of christ and
[55:48] to be bearer of his image
[55:50] a heavenly image as we have borne the
[55:53] image of the earth the oh
[55:54] god let me now begin to bear and reflect
[55:57] home
[55:58] the image of the heavenly so now as we
[56:01] have seen
[56:02] and just quickly looked at the
[56:03] generations of the heaven and earth and
[56:05] the generations of adam
[56:06] what about the generations of the last
[56:08] adam
[56:10] if we've read in the bible the
[56:11] generations of adam and the first adam
[56:13] was made of the earth and all his
[56:14] descendants are from the earth and we
[56:16] could read of a natural history
[56:17] and a natural lineage of them coming
[56:19] from the earth what about us
[56:20] who are of this last adam
[56:24] the bible says in psalms 102 verses 18
[56:26] to 20 this shall be written for
[56:28] the generation to come remember how we
[56:31] read earlier god wanted you to become
[56:34] he wanted you to come forth so he could
[56:36] i love you shake your hand have
[56:38] fellowship with you
[56:38] this shall be written for the generation
[56:40] to come and the people
[56:42] which shall be created shall praise the
[56:45] lord
[56:46] this is the people that he creates for
[56:48] he hath looked down
[56:49] from the height of his sanctuary and
[56:51] noticed the image now that comes
[56:52] together
[56:53] from heaven did the lord behold the
[56:55] earth
[56:56] the very image at this time which says
[56:58] the generation to come
[57:00] the people it shall be created the very
[57:02] image that the scripture places before
[57:04] you
[57:04] is a god who looks down from the height
[57:07] of his sanctuary
[57:08] to behold the earth what there's going
[57:09] to be another union and a fusing
[57:11] together
[57:12] of the heavenly and the earthly he
[57:14] looked from heaven while he steps down
[57:16] out of heaven
[57:17] to place feet on or on earth to bring a
[57:19] union once again
[57:20] of the heavenly and the earthly to unite
[57:23] them together again
[57:25] and this is written for the generation
[57:27] to come a generation that's going to be
[57:28] later eight people which shall be
[57:30] created
[57:32] i don't think in the sense of earthly
[57:34] creation this is divine
[57:37] a people who shall be created for his
[57:38] name's namesake of people that are
[57:39] created for himself
[57:41] a generation to come so as we looked at
[57:44] the generations of adam
[57:47] the bible says in matthew chapter 1
[57:49] verse 17 so all the generations from
[57:51] abraham to david are 14 generations
[57:54] and from david until the carrying away
[57:56] into babylon are 14 generations
[57:58] and from the carrying away into babylon
[58:00] unto christ are 14 generations
[58:03] and you go back and count you can say
[58:05] that there's three 14s
[58:06] so you have 14 from abraham to david
[58:08] from david to babylon 14 from the
[58:10] current way of babylon unto christ you
[58:12] count
[58:13] 13. there's a missing generation
[58:17] why because in christ there's another
[58:19] generation
[58:21] in christ there's a people which are to
[58:23] be created
[58:24] that it's represented already the 42nd
[58:27] generation it's in
[58:28] him just as you could say in the earth
[58:30] were your bodies
[58:31] and then in adam was the woman you can
[58:33] see now
[58:34] in christ this is another pre-figure now
[58:36] of who you are and this is where you
[58:38] come to the real you
[58:39] this is where you're coming to where the
[58:41] the real is coming forth the real
[58:42] expression
[58:43] god hid the mystery could you just
[58:45] imagine the devil's just
[58:47] poking every son that was born because
[58:48] the bible said he talks devil knew would
[58:50] be a son
[58:51] he shall brew crush your head so he's
[58:53] looking for sons
[58:55] as soon as a man's born what does he do
[58:56] the first first one that's born to adam
[58:59] he murders why he's expecting a man to
[59:01] crush his head
[59:02] he's looking going after sons but he
[59:04] poked at the earth he prodded he
[59:06] perverted he destroyed and the devil's
[59:08] trying to mess with the earth mess with
[59:09] mankind and god all along just hides it
[59:12] thousands of years a couple thousand
[59:13] years later six thousand years four
[59:14] thousand years later
[59:15] here it comes and by then the devil's
[59:18] just
[59:19] so beat up eating up tech and everything
[59:21] god just hides it right in there
[59:23] this is the real thrust coming forth
[59:25] this is the real purpose
[59:26] and he hides in that one generation
[59:28] another generation the people which
[59:29] shall be created
[59:32] in revelations chapter 3 verse 14 and
[59:34] under the angel of the church of the
[59:36] laodiceans
[59:37] right these things saith the amen
[59:41] the faithful and true witness the
[59:44] beginning
[59:45] of the creation of god
[59:48] now he waits until the laodicean church
[59:50] age to use this description
[59:52] why because he's signaling at the end of
[59:54] this age there'll be a finishing
[59:56] a finishing of the mystery of god a
[59:58] completion of this creation
[1:00:00] this is when god is going to finish what
[1:00:02] he's been building
[1:00:04] once he has all his elect all that he's
[1:00:06] ordained all that
[1:00:07] as they've expressed and come forth then
[1:00:09] god has finished his mystery
[1:00:11] so now at the end of the creation he
[1:00:13] brings forth the amen the faithful and
[1:00:15] true witness the alpha and omega
[1:00:17] and he calls them the beginning of the
[1:00:19] creation of god
[1:00:21] and notice how brother madam places this
[1:00:23] he says in the message
[1:00:24] when he's preaching the laodicean church
[1:00:26] age he's the beginning of the creation
[1:00:28] of god oh did you catch that
[1:00:30] how could god be created if he's a
[1:00:32] spirit how could he be
[1:00:33] he is eternal he never was created he
[1:00:36] never will be created
[1:00:37] because he was god at the beginning but
[1:00:40] he that is in
[1:00:41] he that is the beginning of the creation
[1:00:42] of god was jesus christ
[1:00:45] when he was made manifest when god lived
[1:00:47] in him
[1:00:48] he is god's creation the first and the
[1:00:50] last the amen
[1:00:51] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:00:53] when god created himself a
[1:00:56] body and come down and lived in it
[1:00:58] that's the beginning of the creation of
[1:01:00] god
[1:01:02] the beginning of god now god had the
[1:01:05] canvas
[1:01:05] god had the clay god set everything
[1:01:08] forth and
[1:01:09] he set the stage of everything he would
[1:01:12] need
[1:01:13] to manifest himself foreshadowing all
[1:01:15] the way down
[1:01:17] and it was christ and david christ and
[1:01:19] the prophets god foreshadowed but then
[1:01:21] the perfect
[1:01:22] one comes christ but now the stage is
[1:01:24] set to manifest
[1:01:25] every single one of his attributes first
[1:01:28] savior that's that was the primary
[1:01:31] that's what he wanted to identify
[1:01:32] himself in christ the lamb that's why
[1:01:34] he's identified as a lamb
[1:01:35] but this is now god becoming
[1:01:38] expressed although foreshadowed in many
[1:01:41] different ways now
[1:01:42] he's expressed in his son the beginning
[1:01:45] of the creation of god god
[1:01:47] hid it all that time in creation god
[1:01:49] foreshouted through the story of abraham
[1:01:52] now he comes forth the beginning of the
[1:01:53] creation of god brother brahm says he is
[1:01:56] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:01:57] and god is eternal but when god was
[1:02:00] created
[1:02:00] when a little baby that was conceived in
[1:02:02] the womb of a mother
[1:02:04] and she began to develop these cells
[1:02:05] within her to bring forth this little
[1:02:07] baby
[1:02:07] all from the divine no no
[1:02:11] no none of mary's dna was used none of
[1:02:13] joseph was used it's all divine
[1:02:15] he says that was the beginning of the
[1:02:17] creation of god
[1:02:19] for god was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:02:21] us and become emmanuel god with us
[1:02:23] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:02:27] so we see now if i could take these
[1:02:30] these two beginnings
[1:02:31] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:02:33] and the earth and your body
[1:02:35] was brilliant being brought into
[1:02:37] existence then when all the material was
[1:02:39] being laid out
[1:02:40] but now we have in the beginning of the
[1:02:42] creation of god
[1:02:43] you're there too you're representing
[1:02:46] that brother
[1:02:47] said and knoweth it not we read this the
[1:02:48] beginning in the beginning of the
[1:02:49] creation of god
[1:02:50] when god began to create and bring you
[1:02:53] into existence
[1:02:54] so you have the earthly part that we
[1:02:56] could see in the earth that we now live
[1:02:58] in
[1:02:58] that came forth in genesis chapter 1
[1:03:00] verse 1 but
[1:03:02] now the heavenly part now the part
[1:03:04] that's going to make up the completeness
[1:03:06] of the person
[1:03:07] when god began to bring you into
[1:03:09] existence
[1:03:10] oh don't look back at jesus as a savior
[1:03:13] and just think that he came to redeem
[1:03:15] any man that would just call upon him
[1:03:17] and it's just merely this
[1:03:19] this despot of a god who's up there
[1:03:20] angering you better plead for your
[1:03:22] forgiveness and you better beg for my
[1:03:24] intervention but rather look at him as
[1:03:26] being representing you
[1:03:28] that you were in him then that you are a
[1:03:30] part of the divine you're part of the
[1:03:32] eternal
[1:03:32] and that he had a purpose and intent and
[1:03:34] sending the lamb and that was to bring
[1:03:36] to himself all that were called all that
[1:03:40] were ordained to come
[1:03:42] that's why i don't question the
[1:03:43] sacrifice i don't question the blood
[1:03:45] that was shed
[1:03:46] because identify with it that i was in
[1:03:48] him then
[1:03:50] i'm not electing him now i'm not
[1:03:52] choosing him now
[1:03:53] and that if i waver if i doubt or i get
[1:03:55] confused or i stumble or i fall it can
[1:03:57] be taken away no i'm identified with it
[1:04:00] i'm part of it
[1:04:02] when god began to bring you into
[1:04:04] existence
[1:04:08] i just read this read this statement
[1:04:11] here from the laodicean church age
[1:04:13] chapter 9 of the church age book
[1:04:15] it says but now he's standing in the
[1:04:16] midst of the church
[1:04:18] and as he stands there revealing who he
[1:04:20] is in this last age
[1:04:21] he calls himself the author of the
[1:04:23] creation of god
[1:04:25] this is another creation this has to do
[1:04:28] with the church
[1:04:30] because now notice the angle that he's
[1:04:31] looking at this in
[1:04:33] this is a special designation of himself
[1:04:37] he is the creator of that church the
[1:04:40] heavenly bridegroom
[1:04:41] created his own bride i said it's
[1:04:44] another creation
[1:04:46] as a spirit of god he came down and
[1:04:47] created in the virgin mary the cells
[1:04:49] from which his body was born
[1:04:51] i want to repeat that he created the
[1:04:52] very cells in the womb of mary for that
[1:04:54] body
[1:04:55] it was not enough for the holy spirit to
[1:04:57] simply give life to human ovum supplied
[1:05:00] by mary
[1:05:00] that would have been sinful mankind
[1:05:03] producing a body
[1:05:05] that would not have produced the last
[1:05:08] adam
[1:05:10] of him it was said lo a body that has
[1:05:13] prepared my father thou
[1:05:14] father has prepared for me god not mary
[1:05:17] provided that body
[1:05:19] mary was the human incubator she carried
[1:05:21] the holy child
[1:05:22] and brought him to birth it was a god
[1:05:25] man he was the son of god he was of the
[1:05:29] new creation man and god met and joined
[1:05:33] he was the first of this new race he is
[1:05:36] the head
[1:05:37] of this new race
[1:05:41] a new creation man and god joined
[1:05:43] together
[1:05:44] it's a new he says it's another
[1:05:46] christian it's a new creation and think
[1:05:48] of all the scriptures colossians 1 18
[1:05:49] and he is the head of the body of the
[1:05:51] church
[1:05:51] who is the beginning the first born from
[1:05:53] the dead that in all things he might
[1:05:55] have
[1:05:55] the preeminence second corinthians 5 17
[1:05:59] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[1:06:01] a
[1:06:01] new creation all things have passed away
[1:06:04] behold
[1:06:05] all things are become new bill abraham
[1:06:08] says there you can see that though
[1:06:10] man was of the old order of creation now
[1:06:13] in union with christ has become the new
[1:06:15] creation of god through union of christ
[1:06:19] you become
[1:06:19] new a new creature in christ jesus for
[1:06:22] we are his workmanship created
[1:06:25] in union with christ jesus on two good
[1:06:27] works
[1:06:28] and that you put on brother the bible
[1:06:30] says that you put on the new
[1:06:32] man which after god has created in
[1:06:34] righteousness and true holiness
[1:06:35] this is what paul has identified in
[1:06:37] ephesians chapter two this is something
[1:06:39] new this is a new creation
[1:06:41] when you're born again by the baptismal
[1:06:43] he goes you become a
[1:06:44] new creature in christ jesus you've been
[1:06:46] elevated above your humanity
[1:06:49] though the humanity is very near you
[1:06:50] we've got to be connected with the
[1:06:52] divine
[1:06:53] you've got to be connected with the
[1:06:54] newness that i have been made
[1:06:56] a new creature in christ jesus he says
[1:07:00] this new creation is
[1:07:01] not the old creation made over or it
[1:07:04] could not be called a new creation
[1:07:08] go ahead and call him what he is he's a
[1:07:09] dead man somebody wants to bring up my
[1:07:12] past he's a dead man
[1:07:14] i want to bring up your mistakes he's a
[1:07:16] dead man don't get me talking about a
[1:07:18] dead man
[1:07:19] because i have the power of resurrection
[1:07:21] so i don't want to start talking about
[1:07:22] him because i'm just going to resurrect
[1:07:23] him
[1:07:24] so i'm just going to leave that man dead
[1:07:26] that's a dead man
[1:07:28] he is dead to me he's gone he's past
[1:07:30] he's been buried in water baptism
[1:07:32] he's been buried in a cold grave i'm a
[1:07:34] new man created in christ jesus
[1:07:37] said this is exactly what it says it is
[1:07:39] new creation it is
[1:07:41] another creation distinct from the old
[1:07:43] one
[1:07:44] no longer is he dealing by the ways of
[1:07:46] the flesh
[1:07:47] that was how he dealt with israel he
[1:07:49] chose abraham and of the abraham's
[1:07:51] issue through the godly isaac line but
[1:07:54] now out of every kindred tribe and
[1:07:56] nation
[1:07:56] he has purposed a new creation
[1:08:00] it has nothing to do with natural
[1:08:01] lineage anymore natural blood
[1:08:03] you don't need a dna test you don't need
[1:08:04] 23 and me you don't need to go out there
[1:08:06] and find it you can trace back if you're
[1:08:08] an original jew
[1:08:09] has nothing to do with it every kindred
[1:08:12] every tribe every nation
[1:08:13] he is calling forth a people unto
[1:08:15] himself and he's purposed a new creation
[1:08:18] he is the first of that creation he was
[1:08:21] god
[1:08:21] created in the form of a man now by his
[1:08:24] spirit he's creating many sons unto
[1:08:26] himself
[1:08:27] god the creator creating himself a part
[1:08:30] of his creation
[1:08:31] this is the true revelation of god this
[1:08:34] was his purpose if we put it in if we
[1:08:38] put it in bride language
[1:08:39] he was god created in the form of a man
[1:08:41] now today you are his body
[1:08:43] the woman god in the form of his wife
[1:08:47] today on earth this is the true
[1:08:49] revelation of god this was his purpose
[1:08:52] this is the purpose took from took form
[1:08:54] this purpose took form through election
[1:08:57] that is why he could look right down to
[1:08:59] the last age when all would be over and
[1:09:01] see himself still in the midst of the
[1:09:02] church
[1:09:03] as author of this new creation of god
[1:09:05] his sovereign power brought it to pass
[1:09:08] by his own decree he elected the members
[1:09:10] of this
[1:09:11] new creation god just brooding over the
[1:09:15] earth
[1:09:16] brooding over the church brooding over
[1:09:18] church services
[1:09:19] brooding over a local church what to
[1:09:21] bring you out
[1:09:22] to make you expressed oh my
[1:09:29] in the in the church age book chapter
[1:09:30] four in the very plain language the true
[1:09:33] bride of christ was in the midst
[1:09:35] the mind of god eternally though not
[1:09:38] expressed until each came forth in the
[1:09:40] designated decreed season
[1:09:42] as each member came forth it became
[1:09:44] expressed and took its place in the body
[1:09:47] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[1:09:50] word seed bride
[1:09:51] and though she is feminine in
[1:09:53] designation she's also called the body
[1:09:55] of christ
[1:09:56] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:09:58] called that for she was predestinated
[1:10:00] in him came from the same source
[1:10:04] was eternal with him and is now
[1:10:07] manifesting god
[1:10:08] in a many-membered body whereas once god
[1:10:10] was manifested in one member
[1:10:12] even our lord jesus christ now then here
[1:10:16] we are coming to a conclusion
[1:10:18] as the eternal logos god was manifested
[1:10:21] in the sun
[1:10:22] and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[1:10:24] the godhead bodily
[1:10:26] and that eternal one was the father
[1:10:28] manifested in flesh and thereby gained
[1:10:30] the title of son
[1:10:32] even so we
[1:10:35] eternal in his thoughts in
[1:10:39] our turn hallelujah you can say it's my
[1:10:43] turn just claim it and accept it it's my
[1:10:47] turn this
[1:10:47] is my time this is my season this is my
[1:10:50] turn
[1:10:51] oh we mean no disrespect to those that
[1:10:53] have gone by through other church ages
[1:10:55] and even jesus as he walked the face
[1:10:57] he's never gonna say but now
[1:10:58] this is my turn this is my season this
[1:11:02] is
[1:11:02] my time i'm taking my turn
[1:11:06] i think it was brother morrow who said
[1:11:07] i'm gonna get selfish with it he says
[1:11:09] but that's my gift that's my word
[1:11:11] that's mine i want a claim and it's mine
[1:11:14] that's how we ought to be with this
[1:11:17] would you give this up would you give
[1:11:19] this message up
[1:11:21] i think what's so beautiful about is you
[1:11:22] can keep yours and give somebody else
[1:11:24] theirs and not lose any of it
[1:11:27] but it is my turn in our turn became
[1:11:30] the many members spoken word seed
[1:11:33] manifested in flesh
[1:11:34] and those eternal thoughts now manifest
[1:11:37] in flesh are the sons of god
[1:11:39] even as we are so called amen
[1:11:43] praise the lord this is the dramatic
[1:11:44] conclusion he's saying
[1:11:47] even so we turn on his thoughts
[1:11:50] now in our return become the manifested
[1:11:53] word of god
[1:11:56] oh my it's beautiful
[1:11:59] i'm just gonna i'm just gonna close here
[1:12:03] i had some more
[1:12:06] but i i just want to i just want to
[1:12:10] close it with this
[1:12:14] well let's go ahead and read it here in
[1:12:15] hosea chapter 2.

[1:12:32] doors

[1:12:34] facility right here until

[1:12:39] my tapes and think i need all that but
[1:12:43] but i i and i don't want to wear you i
[1:12:45] know these days are long
[1:12:48] but notice here in hosea chapter 2
[1:12:51] i've got to come to this verses 16 to 23
[1:12:54] and it should come it shall be at that
[1:12:56] date
[1:12:58] saith the lord that thou shalt be thou
[1:13:00] shalt call me
[1:13:01] is she which means husband
[1:13:04] so it's not boyfriend it's not fiance
[1:13:07] it's not just even lord master or god
[1:13:09] it's union
[1:13:11] you're going to call me husband and
[1:13:13] shout call me no more
[1:13:15] bahali which is this is a a deity
[1:13:18] of baal for i will take away the names
[1:13:21] of balaam out of
[1:13:22] her mouth we can identify with this as
[1:13:25] the gentile the heathen the reprobate
[1:13:26] out of babylon
[1:13:27] take away the names of balaam out of her
[1:13:29] mouth and they shall no more be
[1:13:30] remembered by their name
[1:13:32] and in that day will i make a covenant
[1:13:34] for them with the beast of the field and
[1:13:35] with the fowls of heaven
[1:13:37] and with the creeping things of the
[1:13:38] ground now he's bringing all of creation
[1:13:40] into view i see myself back in genesis 1
[1:13:43] and 2
[1:13:43] and i will break the bow and the sword
[1:13:45] and the battle of the out of the earth
[1:13:46] and will make them to lie down safely
[1:13:49] and i will betray thee under me forever
[1:13:53] no putting away no divorce finality
[1:13:55] union
[1:13:56] it's the invisible union but it's also
[1:13:58] the indivisible union
[1:14:00] it cannot be separate it cannot be
[1:14:01] divided i will betray thee unto me
[1:14:04] in righteousness and in judgment and in
[1:14:07] loving kindness and in mercies
[1:14:09] i will even betray thee unto me in
[1:14:11] faithfulness and thou shalt know the
[1:14:12] lord
[1:14:13] and it shall come to pass in that day i
[1:14:15] will hear saith the lord and i will hear
[1:14:17] the heavens
[1:14:18] and they shall hear the earth bring in
[1:14:21] these very elements of genesis 1 1 into
[1:14:23] view again i will hear the heavens
[1:14:24] i will answer the heavens and they will
[1:14:26] answer the earth and the earth shall
[1:14:28] hear the corn and the wine and the oil
[1:14:30] and they shall hear
[1:14:31] jezreel which means god sows
[1:14:34] and i will sow her unto me
[1:14:38] in the earth and i will have mercy upon
[1:14:41] her that had not obtained mercy
[1:14:43] and i will say to them which were not my
[1:14:45] people thou art my people
[1:14:47] hear the heavens thou art my people and
[1:14:50] they shall say
[1:14:50] thou art my god hear the earth amen
[1:14:54] i will hear the heavens and they shall
[1:14:56] hear the earth and what is it the people
[1:14:57] say thou art my people we have heard the
[1:15:00] heavens and then we respond thou art my
[1:15:02] god
[1:15:03] and the heavens hear the earth what a
[1:15:04] beautiful resounding and music
[1:15:07] song being sung to one another what is
[1:15:09] it heavenly groom
[1:15:10] earthly bride singing to one another
[1:15:13] it's the song of solomon lived out in
[1:15:15] flesh in this end time
[1:15:17] and as you read it there's some who say
[1:15:19] well that that speaks of israel
[1:15:21] wow we could see that in type to israel
[1:15:24] but the mystery was the gentile wife
[1:15:27] the mystery was the gentile bride so
[1:15:29] then he comes to verse 23 and
[1:15:31] i say makes it very plain even though
[1:15:33] i'm saying it's a mystery and i will sow
[1:15:34] her
[1:15:35] unto me and the earth i'm going to sow
[1:15:38] in the earth
[1:15:39] something for my purpose something of my
[1:15:41] choosing something from my benefit and i
[1:15:43] will have mercy upon her
[1:15:45] that had not obtained mercy israel had
[1:15:47] obtained mercy many times
[1:15:48] and i will say to them which were not my
[1:15:50] people israel was identified as his
[1:15:53] people
[1:15:54] who is he talking about you he's talking
[1:15:57] about the gentile wife the gentile bride
[1:15:59] i will say to them
[1:16:00] thou art my people you didn't know it
[1:16:03] but i hid the mystery i hid the election
[1:16:05] i hid the plan you
[1:16:06] are my people and we resound hear o
[1:16:10] heavens from the earth
[1:16:11] thou art my god
[1:16:15] he sold you already in the earth could
[1:16:19] we not say that about our bodies
[1:16:21] already in the earth in the beginning he
[1:16:22] sowed it there in the earth in the
[1:16:23] beginning
[1:16:25] then we see that here we were
[1:16:26] represented in christ
[1:16:28] have our representation in christ we
[1:16:30] were with him then we were in him
[1:16:32] then but now think of even a
[1:16:36] i want to say true type but just even
[1:16:38] another type
[1:16:40] he sold himself in the earth
[1:16:43] i will sow her unto me in the earth what
[1:16:46] earth
[1:16:47] are we looking at we're not talking
[1:16:50] about going in our backyards and raking
[1:16:51] away the rocks and digging through the
[1:16:53] clay
[1:16:54] those of us who are lucky enough to have
[1:16:55] lawns you know digging through the sod
[1:16:59] he's talking about the earth he sowed
[1:17:03] something in your earth
[1:17:05] it was there from the very moment you
[1:17:06] let out your first and begin to cry it
[1:17:09] was already there
[1:17:10] it's already there right then you
[1:17:12] weren't driving down the road one day
[1:17:13] and see a billboard jesus saves and says
[1:17:15] i believe he saves and a seed came into
[1:17:17] your heart
[1:17:18] you weren't good to your mom and a seed
[1:17:19] came in yard you didn't come to church
[1:17:20] and a seed fall in your heart
[1:17:22] every backsliding every wandering every
[1:17:24] drug took
[1:17:25] every girl chased after whatever it was
[1:17:27] however way you went
[1:17:28] it was always there and in some ways
[1:17:30] maybe it was haunting you
[1:17:32] but it was wooing you and calling you
[1:17:34] why because he said i sold
[1:17:36] a part of myself in you from the very
[1:17:38] beginning
[1:17:39] and that's what the preacher the gospel
[1:17:41] does is it drives back the clouds
[1:17:44] and it lets shot light shine upon that
[1:17:46] seed so the son or daughter of god can
[1:17:48] burst forth to life
[1:17:50] he sowed himself into your earth that's
[1:17:53] why it says in isaiah 62 4 thou shalt no
[1:17:55] more be turned forsaken
[1:17:57] neither shall thy land any more be
[1:17:59] termed desolate
[1:18:01] but thou shalt be called hefsiba which
[1:18:03] means my delight is in her
[1:18:05] in thy land beulah which means married
[1:18:08] for the lord
[1:18:08] delighteth in thee and thy land shall be
[1:18:11] married
[1:18:12] the same land not just a new land
[1:18:17] but the same land there's a promise of
[1:18:19] redemption of this body
[1:18:22] and that's a promise that you're tied to
[1:18:24] and anchored to then we see the
[1:18:26] the process of redemption for the
[1:18:27] purpose i am no longer term forsaken
[1:18:30] i am no longer termed desolate even
[1:18:32] myself as a person
[1:18:34] i am hefa which means my delight is in
[1:18:36] her
[1:18:38] i shall be called my land my body even
[1:18:40] beulah because it's going to be
[1:18:42] married hezbollah means it's the name
[1:18:45] given for jerusalem
[1:18:47] my delight is in her eden means delight
[1:18:50] so even in genesis 1 we have the delight
[1:18:52] of god there he put the man
[1:18:54] god's delight jerusalem is hefa
[1:18:57] it's delight and now we see and we can
[1:18:59] see in christ in whom i'm
[1:19:01] delighted and pleased to dwell
[1:19:04] it's all it's all identifying his
[1:19:07] relationship
[1:19:08] with you i now delight in you
[1:19:11] you just tell yourself that sometime
[1:19:13] maybe even do it now
[1:19:14] maybe even write in your notes he
[1:19:16] delights in me
[1:19:19] he does his scripture wants to tell you
[1:19:21] that i delight in you
[1:19:22] lord what about this he's i i i've
[1:19:24] covered that
[1:19:26] what about this i've covered that too
[1:19:29] it covers it's greater it covers all
[1:19:32] i've been thinking of that song this
[1:19:33] morning greater
[1:19:34] than all my sins is the blood that still
[1:19:37] cleanses me
[1:19:39] that's greater than all that covers all
[1:19:40] of it
[1:19:43] brother branham i just want to use this
[1:19:44] statement as we close
[1:19:46] just to bring the whole picture into
[1:19:47] view now he says all right the entire
[1:19:50] bible is the entire revelation of jesus
[1:19:51] christ making himself known to every age
[1:19:54] he made himself known in the days of
[1:19:56] luther as a foundation the church the
[1:19:58] root the legs
[1:19:59] like you did king nebuchadnezzar you
[1:20:00] remember how he dreamed those dreams and
[1:20:02] come from the head down now he comes
[1:20:05] from the feet up in the babylonian
[1:20:07] kingdom he showed all those old
[1:20:08] testaments
[1:20:09] he come from the head down until he
[1:20:11] calmed down till god himself
[1:20:13] became flesh at the foot of the ladder
[1:20:16] now here in the new testament he
[1:20:18] brings himself right back up again to
[1:20:20] the head again the head of gold to be
[1:20:22] crowned
[1:20:22] so god was in the beginning and he kept
[1:20:26] coming down
[1:20:28] through prophets on down until god
[1:20:30] himself became human like us plumbed
[1:20:32] down at the foot of the ladder a baby
[1:20:33] born in a manger hated rejected despised
[1:20:35] and a bad name and everything he was
[1:20:38] then
[1:20:39] he started rising and from the feet to
