[0:00] the Lord. Let's turn in our Bibles to
[0:01] Matthew chapter 24. I'd like to begin
[0:05] reading from verse 15
[0:09] to verse 22.
[0:13] This particular passage is dealing with
[0:15] the coming of the son of man and it's uh
[0:19] a companion to Luke chapter 17 and where
[0:24] it speaks and we're very familiar with
[0:26] as it was in the days of Lot as it was
[0:28] in the days of uh Noah and how it so
[0:32] shall it be in the day when the son of
[0:33] man is revealed. It's also spoken of
[0:35] here in Matthew chapter 24 and it's
[0:37] referred to the coming of the son of
[0:40] man. But there's a portion here at the
[0:43] beginning before he he's dealing with
[0:44] the signs of the times. He's there's a
[0:47] prophecy in here that I wanted to point
[0:50] out u before we you know as our
[0:52] foundation and hopefully visit here in a
[0:54] few minutes. It says Matthew chap 24 15
[0:58] to 22. When you therefore shall see the
[1:00] abomination of desolation spoken of by
[1:03] Daniel the prophet stand in the holy
[1:07] place. who so readeth, let him
[1:10] understand.
[1:11] Then let them which be in Judea flee
[1:14] unto the mountains. So he references a
[1:17] prophecy spoken by Daniel. And then the
[1:20] writer says, you know, he that's reading
[1:21] this, let him understand. And then Jesus
[1:24] having referenced this prophecy says,
[1:26] let them which be in Judea flee into the
[1:27] mountains. Let him which is on the
[1:29] housetop not come down to take anything
[1:31] out of his house. Neither let him which
[1:33] is in the field return back to take his
[1:36] clothes. And woe unto them that are with
[1:39] child, and to them that give suck in
[1:41] those days. But pray ye that your flight
[1:43] be not in the winter, neither on the
[1:46] Sabbath day. For then shall be great
[1:48] tribulation. Such was not since the
[1:50] beginning of the world to this time, no,
[1:52] nor ever shall be, except those days be
[1:55] shortened. There should be no flesh be
[1:57] saved, but for the elect's sake, those
[1:59] days shall be shortened. Amen. Let's bow
[2:03] our heads in a word of prayer. Our
[2:05] heavenly father, as we are standing in
[2:06] your divine presence today, we're
[2:08] grateful for your grace. Lord, the your
[2:12] blood has never lost its power, nor has
[2:15] it lost its preciousness to us. And
[2:17] today, Lord, we realize that we're the
[2:19] purchase of that that blood that being
[2:22] washed by it, be redeemed by it, we have
[2:24] this privilege of fellowshipping with
[2:25] you and not only fellowshipping with
[2:27] you, but one another. And Lord, we
[2:29] realize what a a lonely walk this would
[2:31] be if we did not have each other. Lord,
[2:34] we realize even the impossibility of
[2:36] this Christian life had you not uh
[2:39] placed things near us and provided
[2:41] things for us that we could be sustained
[2:43] and our lives could be enriched. Lord,
[2:45] we're even taught that you
[2:47] [clears throat] can't stay at home and
[2:48] be a Christian. That coming to church
[2:50] and gatherings like this are essential
[2:52] to you feeding us and encouraging us and
[2:54] strengthening us. So, we praise you,
[2:56] Father, and we thank you that you've
[2:57] provided us a place to come and worship
[2:59] together. a place, Lord, that though it
[3:01] may be a hall that's used for many other
[3:03] things, Lord, we believe that the power
[3:05] of God is so mighty that your presence
[3:08] is so strong that every spirit, any
[3:11] idea, any thought is made subject to
[3:13] your presence. It's brought low before
[3:15] your word. So, Lord, we're not afraid of
[3:17] the amenities, Lord, that surround us.
[3:19] We're not afraid of the people that
[3:21] might pass by. We're not afraid of any
[3:23] the prior use of this room, Lord. We've
[3:25] sanctified it. Your presence is here.
[3:27] And father, we stand here submitted to
[3:29] you, believing that you'll come. You'll
[3:30] take the bread of life and speak to us.
[3:32] So now, Father, take control of this
[3:34] service for your glory. We pray in the
[3:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:39] Amen. You may be seated.
[3:44] I'm going to give you my title here at
[3:46] the beginning uh just so you um
[3:49] understand that we're going to be going
[3:50] a little bit different direction than we
[3:52] have been so far. But I want to say
[3:54] before I get too too far in this,
[3:56] Brother Thomas, Sister Sandy, it's nice
[3:57] to have you here. Come all the way. I'm
[3:59] Let's just be honest. It it's the
[4:01] weather that brought them here for their
[4:03] for her birthday. But we certainly are
[4:05] grateful that they uh included us in on
[4:07] this special day in this trip. He sent
[4:09] me a picture last week of snow already
[4:11] on the ground in Witchah and he said, "I
[4:13] can't wait to get to Phoenix." And so
[4:15] we're glad you didn't bring the weather
[4:16] with you. Glad it's going to be in the
[4:18] 90s today. So, um we just pray that God
[4:21] would richly bless you. both Tom and
[4:22] Sister Sandy have been uh good friends
[4:24] to Sister Elizabeth and I have been very
[4:25] a great encouragement and uh I've been
[4:28] evangelizing for 40 years Tom 40 years
[4:31] so wow that's quite the labor in the
[4:33] gospel and he's been around been several
[4:36] places he has some stories to share but
[4:38] please bring our love and greetings back
[4:40] to spoken word tabernacle to brother Jim
[4:41] and the saints we love each one of you
[4:43] dearly and so nice to have you here my
[4:46] title is you were made for this and when
[4:49] I say you I'm talking to you So, if
[4:51] anyone ever calls you you, that's who
[4:53] I'm talking to. You were made for this.
[4:56] And I have a a a quote I want to start
[4:58] off with. Um, and I apologize if maybe
[5:00] it seems to be in a very very small
[5:02] font, but I just wanted to get it all on
[5:04] one slide, some of these uh for you. He
[5:07] says this in one in a million. He says,
[5:09] "The time and the hour that we're
[5:11] living." So, he's wanting to draw our
[5:13] attention to the the very moments uh
[5:16] that he was living. And we could do the
[5:17] same thing for us. He says if a person
[5:20] don't know which way to go, what to do
[5:21] or how to turn, you're not walking by
[5:24] faith anymore. You're just guessing. You
[5:26] are presuming. So if you don't know
[5:28] which way to go and you go, that's not
[5:30] faith. That's just presumption. He said,
[5:32] "And presume is to advance without
[5:34] official authority." So if we haven't
[5:36] got the real official authority to know
[5:39] what God said would take place in this
[5:42] hour, how are we ever going to face this
[5:44] hour? So this is important because we
[5:47] often um speculate as to things that are
[5:49] going to transpire and way things things
[5:51] that are going to happen uh and the way
[5:53] things are going to be and we do that
[5:55] now without the benefit of a prophet
[5:57] here presently uh prophesying or giving
[5:59] us thus sayith the lord or telling us
[6:01] how things are uh uh going to transpire.
[6:03] So there's a lot of things that we can
[6:05] uh prognosticate on. There's a lot of
[6:07] things that we can guess at. There's a
[6:09] lot of scenarios that we can draw in our
[6:10] mind. But he's saying that if you have
[6:12] if you don't have what God said, then
[6:15] you're just presuming. If you're just
[6:17] going by your own uh temperature that
[6:19] you're taking and your own analytics, he
[6:21] says you're presuming. And if you're
[6:22] just presuming, how can you face what's
[6:24] coming? So he says, "And we've got to
[6:26] face it knowing by faith in his word the
[6:29] things that's supposed to be happening
[6:31] now." He says, "And the condition of the
[6:32] nations, the condition of the people,
[6:34] the condition of the church, and so
[6:36] forth." We've got to know that and then
[6:38] how to walk out to face it. This is
[6:41] brother Brandham giving us some very
[6:43] good principles about facing the times
[6:44] that we're living in. If you don't know
[6:46] how to do that, you're just what we used
[6:47] to call kind of haphazardly just jump in
[6:50] hoping it'll be there, hoping this and
[6:51] hoping that and will it be? But God
[6:54] don't want us to do that. He wants us to
[6:57] know what he has said about this day.
[7:00] Then meet it by faith because he said it
[7:02] would be that way. then we know your
[7:05] truth then because you haven't got some
[7:07] person's word for it. You got his word
[7:09] of what we must do.
[7:11] So whenever we're going to uh whenever
[7:13] we're facing just even today the rule
[7:15] that we ought to live by as believers is
[7:18] what has the word said about it and what
[7:20] do we know is certain? What do we know
[7:22] is an absolute which is sure which is
[7:24] made made been made clear. What's God's
[7:27] promise to that? And that's what I'm
[7:28] going to face the day with. not a
[7:31] guessing, not a hope so, not not
[7:32] predictions and not assumptions,
[7:34] certainly not presuming and venturing
[7:36] out without authority. I'm just going to
[7:38] go by what has been said and I'm going
[7:40] to stick with what's been said. And if
[7:42] the word hasn't spoke to anything else,
[7:44] I want to stay with what has been
[7:45] spoken, too. There's a lot of different
[7:47] scenarios. Well, it could go this way,
[7:48] it could go that way, this could happen,
[7:50] that could happen. Well, if the word
[7:51] hasn't spoken to the way it's going to
[7:53] be, just stay with what you know. If you
[7:56] know that the Son of Man has been
[7:57] revealed, stay with that. If you know
[7:59] the Lord himself has descended with a
[8:00] shout, stay with that. Stay with the
[8:02] things that we know are certain. I was
[8:05] pondering again that statement uh by
[8:07] Donald Rumsfeld. I don't know how often
[8:09] he's been quoted behind a pulpit, but uh
[8:12] I've quoted him a few times and uh I
[8:15] don't know if he's ever retweeted me
[8:16] when I've done this, but he he talks
[8:20] about they're asking him questions in
[8:21] the Gulf War and he says, "Well, there's
[8:23] known knowns. There's known unknowns."
[8:26] He says, "But then there's unknown
[8:27] unknowns."
[8:29] And it's it makes sense if you think
[8:30] about it. There's things that we know
[8:32] that we know. Then there's things that
[8:33] we know we don't know. But there's
[8:35] things that we don't know we don't know.
[8:37] And we don't need to venture in the
[8:39] unknowns. Let's just stick with the
[8:41] known knowns.
[8:42] Let God reveal the the unknown at in his
[8:45] time and in his season.
[8:47] And so I think those are wonderful
[8:49] principles that Brother Brandham lays
[8:52] out there. And I wanted to use that at
[8:53] the outset to think about the time that
[8:55] we're living in, the prophecies that
[8:57] have been made, the thi the things that
[8:58] have been shared with us, and what we
[9:01] ought to be focusing on, what we m must
[9:02] be connected to. And then I I was I
[9:06] don't want to hide this. I maybe I was
[9:08] debating on where maybe just to uh
[9:10] reference this, but I want to speak to
[9:12] the elephant that's in the room. You
[9:14] ever heard that saying? You know, we're
[9:16] just kind of ignoring the elephant
[9:18] that's in the room. I want to speak to
[9:19] the elephant that's in the room and the
[9:21] donkey
[9:26] because this upcoming election has a lot
[9:28] of people on edge
[9:31] and the whole world is set on edge.
[9:34] nations are watching and everyone's
[9:36] weighing in on it and people who've
[9:38] never uh endorsed uh institutions or
[9:41] entities that have never endorsed
[9:43] candidates um are now is there a polit
[9:46] political filter on this? All of a
[9:48] sudden I dropped out when I started
[9:49] talking about politics. It's working. We
[9:51] programmed it that as soon as you
[9:52] mention a political party, the stream
[9:55] has dropped out. It's been scrubbed from
[9:57] YouTube.
[10:00] We're going to be demonetized after
[10:01] this.
[10:03] But there's people that are weighing in
[10:05] on this who never have before because
[10:07] the stakes are so high and this is so
[10:10] important and a and we've got to get
[10:12] this right and everyone's really really
[10:14] amped up. You know what's a shame is
[10:15] politics has become political.
[10:19] I got you, didn't I? Politics has always
[10:21] been political. But it's it's now it's
[10:23] just so it's so polarized and and you're
[10:26] careful to even express to somebody how
[10:28] you feel about a particular issue
[10:30] because it's such a bright line test.
[10:32] Now, if you're on this side, you're on
[10:33] that side and and you can't like one
[10:35] another and you can't shake hands and
[10:36] you have to be mortal enemies. And so,
[10:38] the the rhetoric has been really ramped
[10:40] up and everyone's set on edge. And
[10:43] because of this election and because of
[10:44] the pandemic, the social uh political
[10:47] and economical uh instability, uh it
[10:50] looms over our country. Would you agree?
[10:53] Amen.
[10:53] Uh we're being told that because of this
[10:55] election that there's social unrest and
[10:58] that there's uh uh political
[10:59] instability, the economics are in
[11:02] imbalance and it's looming over this
[11:03] country. And because any one of these
[11:05] things or maybe all three of these
[11:07] things could go sideways, it's
[11:08] threatening. This is what the people are
[11:10] portraying and this is what's talked
[11:12] about over our dinner tables and shared
[11:14] online and forums and a and through
[11:16] social media and in the media itself.
[11:18] It's threatening chaos.
[11:21] And so uncertainty abounds.
[11:24] And it's what's interesting is since we
[11:28] could all agree it's uncertain, despite
[11:29] the uncertainty, everyone's predicting
[11:32] and they're predicting doom and there's
[11:34] going to be civil unrest and there's
[11:35] going to be social upheaval and and
[11:38] everyone's trying to say this is what's
[11:39] going to happen and this is what's going
[11:41] to happen. And really, it's all just
[11:42] rumors.
[11:45] Unless someone says that on election
[11:46] night if Donald Trump wins, I'm going to
[11:48] go kick my neighbor's door in. they can
[11:50] fulfill that prophecy. But the the point
[11:53] is a lot of people don't know the way
[11:55] it's going to go. Uh all we have to do
[11:57] is look back four years ago to realize
[11:59] that, you know, everyone could be wrong
[12:00] about something because everyone was
[12:02] certain that someone was going to bust
[12:04] that glass ceiling, that someone was
[12:06] going to be elected in. And they were
[12:07] already printing the newspapers to
[12:09] congratulate the first female president.
[12:11] A a and books were flying off the shelf
[12:13] on Amazon about the prophecies of a
[12:15] woman president. And and what happened?
[12:18] what everyone didn't expect to happen,
[12:20] but yet everyone still predicts and
[12:21] everyone thinks it's going to be a
[12:22] certain way, but really at the end of
[12:24] the day, they're just rumors.
[12:28] And then now I want to make this very uh
[12:32] uh very
[12:34] uh relevant to us because this would
[12:36] these could be comments that could be
[12:37] made in a boardroom uh uh uh to
[12:39] employees of a company or or the board
[12:41] of directors at at a particular
[12:44] educational institution. But where this
[12:46] is relevant for us is when we marry
[12:48] these things or join these things that
[12:50] I'm talking about with the word, these
[12:54] things become exponentially more
[12:56] fearsome.
[12:57] So there's there there's instability. We
[12:59] could all agree there's uncertainty. We
[13:01] can all agree there's a there's an
[13:02] election that's going to take place on
[13:04] Tuesday that may may the the the outcome
[13:07] may not be decided on Tuesday. It may be
[13:09] months away, but we don't know. we
[13:11] there's just no idea, no way of knowing
[13:13] just exactly what direction it's going
[13:14] to go. And that's how we sit as
[13:16] Americans or humans or anybody who can
[13:19] read or hear things. But then when we as
[13:21] believers take things in the word and
[13:23] then we marry it with these things we're
[13:25] hearing and seeing, then the things that
[13:26] we're hearing and seeing can be um by a
[13:29] multiplier more fearful.
[13:32] And so there's a few things to consider
[13:34] that I want to just say here at the
[13:35] outset.
[13:37] Few things to consider. The first thing
[13:39] is uncertainty is not certain.
[13:43] So whatever things that are being
[13:44] shared, well it could be this way, it
[13:45] could be that way. Remember that's just
[13:47] the uncertainty of it. There's no one
[13:49] that's able to tell you absolutely
[13:50] what's going to happen. You know, not to
[13:53] scare you at all, but who knows what
[13:54] happens between now and Tuesday.
[13:57] What what if the numbers tomorrow say
[13:59] there's 800,000 people tested positive
[14:02] or everybody who tested for corona virus
[14:05] for this last week tested positive and
[14:06] Donald Trump says in light of this
[14:08] terrible pandemic I'm enforcing martial
[14:11] law everyone has to stay home the polls
[14:14] are closed and and that's the battle the
[14:16] next battle I'm not saying it is
[14:19] but it could happen in other words you
[14:21] don't know what's going to happen you
[14:23] don't know what's next so the
[14:24] uncertainty is exactly that uncert
[14:26] certain
[14:28] there. There's even a saying about human
[14:30] nature. It's predictably unpredictable.
[14:33] And so there's there it's is still
[14:35] uncertain. So rumors themselves are not
[14:37] a sure thing. We know the sun's going to
[14:40] come up in the morning. We know there's
[14:42] certain things that that are an absolute
[14:44] regardless of who wins, death and taxes
[14:46] will still hold the day. Those things
[14:48] are certain. And so that's one thing
[14:51] just to remind you of that the un we
[14:53] ought not to deal with uncertainties as
[14:55] certainties. The second thing is we have
[14:57] to as believers even though we use the
[15:00] word as our filter and and we we we
[15:03] never venture outside of the word we
[15:04] must resist marrying the word to rumor.
[15:09] We must resist the urge to take the word
[15:11] and join it to some kind of conjecture
[15:13] where I think it might or it may be
[15:16] this. In other words, as brother Bandham
[15:18] said, you're presuming you're venturing
[15:19] without official authority. We must not
[15:22] assume a particular thing is going to be
[15:24] a certain way if God hasn't said it will
[15:26] be that way or speculate that this thing
[15:29] is what was said before.
[15:32] How does God interpret his word? By
[15:34] bringing it to pass. And so before
[15:36] something is fulfilled, we're all just
[15:38] speculating.
[15:39] Now God can give us revelation of things
[15:41] and God can uh give things make things
[15:43] very very plain. But there's a always a
[15:46] mysterious element that remains to
[15:48] prophecy despite the revelation because
[15:50] at the end of the day prophecy embodies
[15:52] so much symbolism that how God fulfills
[15:55] it can be wildly different than how our
[15:57] mind had it figured out. So there's a we
[16:00] have to even though we use the word as
[16:02] our filter and we want to run everything
[16:04] through the word of God. What has God
[16:05] said? What does the word say about it? I
[16:07] was fellowshipping with my dad this past
[16:09] week and he knows a lot more about
[16:10] what's going on in this thing than I do.
[16:12] So, I was just kind of uh picking his
[16:14] brain a little bit and I was getting the
[16:15] the full dose. I was like, "Wow, I never
[16:18] thought about that. Wow, I never thought
[16:19] about that." A and and and one of the
[16:22] things we came to conclusion is let's
[16:24] just go with what God has said.
[16:25] Amen.
[16:26] Because if God has spoken, thus sayeth
[16:29] the Lord, about what will be, then we
[16:31] know that's what's going to be.
[16:33] So, we look to what is certain. We look
[16:34] to what is sure. We we look at the known
[16:36] knowns. If there's a known unknown, then
[16:39] we're not we're not trying to figure out
[16:40] the unknown till God reveals it. And so
[16:42] I want to know what the word said about
[16:44] it. And I know what the word has said
[16:46] about America. I know what the word has
[16:48] said about the future about Israel and
[16:50] certain things. I say regardless of
[16:52] who's in office, it's got to go that
[16:54] way.
[16:55] So there's certain things that we can be
[16:57] absolutely certain on. And and I want to
[17:00] express this as a principle that you
[17:02] could you could you could write on a
[17:03] sticky note and it just it rem it's true
[17:06] outside of the context of this sermon.
[17:08] The wrong wrong teaching cannot inspire
[17:10] faith.
[17:12] It cannot do it. I if I taught you this
[17:15] morning that when you walk out of here,
[17:17] each one of you is going to be handed a
[17:18] $100 bill by me. That would not inspire
[17:21] faith
[17:23] because I don't have $100 bills to hand
[17:24] out to each one of you. That would be
[17:26] wrong teaching. That would be
[17:27] inaccurate. and and and who knows, maybe
[17:29] some of you could really really have
[17:30] faith, just pad my pockets and I'll
[17:32] stand out there if I end up with 50s
[17:34] something $100 bills. But the the the
[17:37] point is if you teach something wrong, a
[17:39] lie can never inspire faith. A false
[17:42] word cannot build up faith within
[17:44] someone's heart. A lie, a false
[17:46] doctrine, the wrong kind of teaching can
[17:48] only inspire doubt.
[17:50] Right?
[17:51] Even if it feels like faith, it's only
[17:52] doubt. Even if it feels like faith, it's
[17:54] only hope. It can only inspire fear. And
[17:57] when that happens, it breeds
[17:58] uncertainty. So if I got up to here
[18:01] today and I tried to give you uh thus
[18:04] sayith the Lord on something that God
[18:06] hasn't spoken to, that can't really
[18:07] produce faith. It can produce a
[18:09] fanaticism.
[18:11] It can produce a real zeal. It can
[18:13] produce emotion and everyone can get
[18:15] stirred up. And people can even comment,
[18:17] "OH MY, WASN'T THAT service awesome? Did
[18:18] the power of God not move?" Because they
[18:20] were emotionally STIRRED UP ALL BY A
[18:22] LIE.
[18:24] All by a false teaching. all by
[18:26] something that rallies the people and
[18:27] gets them all excited AND BUT THAT'S NOT
[18:29] INSPIRING FAITH. Only the word of God
[18:31] can inspire faith. So we we remember
[18:35] things that are uncertain are just that.
[18:37] They're uncertain. They're not
[18:38] certainties. And we have to resist the
[18:41] urge to try to take something uncertain
[18:43] and join it with a part of the word that
[18:45] we're not certain about to try to bring
[18:47] clarity because if we do it only
[18:48] produces a greater uncertainty or worse
[18:51] a fear or a doubt.
[18:53] And then the third thing, and this is
[18:56] probably where I'll spend most of my
[18:57] time kind of showing this angle in the
[18:59] word.
[19:01] When the word prophesies that there's
[19:03] going to be a calamity, if the word
[19:05] prophesies that there's going to be some
[19:07] difficulty, some trouble, we often so
[19:11] focus on the prophecy that we never
[19:14] realize the promise. In other words,
[19:17] there's a lot of prophecies in the word
[19:19] of God that speak of terrible things
[19:20] that are going to happen and and that
[19:22] speaks of calamities and destructions
[19:24] and disease and loss. And many times we
[19:26] just focus on that aspect and we get so
[19:29] narrowly focused on that ASPECT THAT WE
[19:31] DON'T realize that there's also a
[19:33] promise with respect to the prophecy.
[19:36] There's a way that you could take the
[19:37] word temptation is even in the book of
[19:39] Revelations in that hour of temptation.
[19:41] We might think, "Oh, I'm being tested to
[19:43] to smoke some marijuana. Oh, I'm being
[19:45] tempted to snort coke. That that's not
[19:47] always what the temptation is. The
[19:48] temptation can be a trial of your faith,
[19:51] an opportunity to doubt, a a chance for
[19:54] you to really stand firm on the word of
[19:55] God and stake your claim and a promise.
[19:57] So temptation takes on many, many
[19:59] different forms.
[20:01] And the Bible says that God hath not
[20:03] there's no temptation that has taken
[20:05] you, but such is common to man. So every
[20:08] trial, every test, every uh every
[20:10] temptation to sin, temptation to doubt,
[20:12] or every opportunity for your faith to
[20:15] to rise up and stand to the forefront,
[20:17] and even in those that you fail in, the
[20:19] Bible says that no temptation has you
[20:21] have been has faced you that a man
[20:23] hasn't faced before. And then the Bible
[20:26] says, BUT GOD IS faithful
[20:28] who will with the temptation make a way
[20:31] of escape that you may be able to bear
[20:33] it. So every temptation has a way of
[20:35] escape. It may look like just a a a a
[20:38] brute force attack and here it is. It's
[20:40] in your face. But God has built within
[20:42] the temptation a promise wherein you're
[20:44] able to bear it. And so WHEN THE BIBLE
[20:48] SPEAKS OF A PROPHECY,
[20:50] THERE'S ALSO A PROMISE.
[20:54] And that's where uh I I know a brother
[20:56] that doesn't like to sing every promise
[20:58] in the book is mine. Because he says
[21:00] there's a lot of promises to the
[21:02] non-elect. But I said, "No, those are
[21:04] threats.
[21:05] Th those are prophecies. But the promise
[21:08] holds a blessing. It holds benefit. It
[21:10] holds power. But it's important to look
[21:11] at IT THAT WAY. NOT EVERYTHING that God
[21:13] has promised to happen is applicable to
[21:15] you.
[21:18] And so it's I I want you to think about
[21:20] that. If you read in the message, you
[21:22] read in the Bible things that speak of
[21:23] fearful sights that are coming and and
[21:25] calamity that's ahead and oh, it's it's
[21:27] going to get dark. It's going to get
[21:29] difficult. It's going to be hard.
[21:30] Remember that there can't be a prophecy
[21:32] of darkness without there being an
[21:34] opportunity for light.
[21:36] There can't be a warning of judgment if
[21:38] there's not a way of escape to avoid it.
[21:42] So there there must be an arc of safety.
[21:45] If there's an oncoming flood
[21:48] now, are we satisfied with the
[21:49] foundation? I can go back over it again.
[21:51] I got everything right here. I've got
[21:52] the I can do this. I can go back to this
[21:54] and say there's an elephant and a donkey
[21:56] in the room and we could read quotes
[21:58] again. Whatever you need, just let me
[22:00] know. But I I John 14 27.
[22:05] It says this,
[22:08] "Peace I leave with you. My peace I give
[22:11] unto you, not as the world giveth give I
[22:14] unto you." Because what what kind of
[22:16] peace does the world give you? Empty
[22:18] assurance.
[22:19] It's vanity. It's pride. Or really, at
[22:21] the end of the day, when you distill it
[22:22] down, there's really nothing there. It's
[22:24] just a lot of fluff. So he's saying, I
[22:26] give you a peace that has substance.
[22:28] A peace that passeth understanding. A
[22:31] peace that is so certain and sure that
[22:32] once joined with faith or inspired by
[22:35] faith, it has a real substant to it. It
[22:37] has v weight. It has value. He says,
[22:39] "Let not your heart be troubled. Neither
[22:42] let it be afraid." Now he says this
[22:45] within the context of many different
[22:46] things that could uh quicken doubt that
[22:49] could cause them to be fearful. He's
[22:51] saying a lot of things about himself.
[22:52] He's saying a lot of things about the
[22:54] future here in these few vers chapters
[22:56] here in John that would cause someone to
[22:58] say, "Oh my goodness, is that really
[22:59] going to happen? Is this the way it's
[23:00] going to be? Is this it?" SO HE SAYS,
[23:01] "DON'T LET YOUR HEART be troubled." Even
[23:03] in the face of difficult things that I'm
[23:05] saying, don't let your heart be
[23:06] troubled. If if I SAY THE WHOLE WORLD'S
[23:09] GOING TO BURN, HE SAID, "DON'T LET YOUR
[23:10] HEART be troubled. THERE'S GOING TO BE
[23:12] BILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIE. DON'T LET YOUR
[23:14] HEART BE TROUBLED." NOW, that that seems
[23:16] very uh uh counterintuitive to our human
[23:18] nature. So he says, "Don't let your
[23:20] heart be troubled. Neither let it be
[23:22] afraid.
[23:24] This is this applies to us in any
[23:26] situation. Don't let your heart be
[23:28] troubled. Don't let it be afraid. Oh,
[23:30] but but this is going to happen. Don't
[23:31] be troubled.
[23:33] Don't be afraid. In Luke 12:5
[23:36] says, "But I will forewarn you whom you
[23:38] shall fear." He says, "Don't fear him
[23:39] who can put your body in a grave. Don't
[23:41] fear him who can take away your
[23:42] clothing. Don't fear him who can tax
[23:44] you. Don't fear him who can impose uh uh
[23:47] social health care. Don't don't don't
[23:48] fear what man can do unto you. He says,
[23:51] "But I will forewarn you whom you shall
[23:53] fear, fear him
[23:55] which after he hath killed hath power to
[23:57] cast into hell. He that has power, he
[23:59] says another place, to destroy both body
[24:01] and soul into hell." He says, "Yay, I
[24:03] will say unto you, fear him." So there's
[24:07] only one that we fear, and that's God.
[24:09] There's only ONE THAT HAS REAL power
[24:11] over us because nothing can happen to us
[24:13] unless he allows it. So I will not fear
[24:16] what man can DO UNTO ME. I WILL NOT FEAR
[24:18] HIM WHO can destroy the body. I will not
[24:20] fear him who can throw the body into
[24:21] prison. I will not fear him who through
[24:23] legal force and coercion COULD TRY TO
[24:25] IMPOSE certain restrictions, limitations
[24:27] upon me. I will NOT FEAR HIM. AS A
[24:29] MATTER OF FACT, I WILL LOOK TO THE
[24:30] SCRIPTURE AND RENDER UNDER Caesar which
[24:32] IS DO CAESAR. AND I WILL FEAR THE RULERS
[24:34] THAT ARE PLACED over me even legally and
[24:37] and on my job AND ALL THOSE THAT I I
[24:39] HAVE THAT HAVE AUTHORITY OVER ME. BUT
[24:40] THERE'S ONLY ONE THAT I WILL FEAR. I'll
[24:43] fear him, God alone.
[24:46] Brother Brandham says in God's way made
[24:48] for us, the worst thing the devil can
[24:50] put on you is fear.
[24:53] If you even had a cancer, now this is
[24:55] how powerful fear is.
[24:57] If you even if you even had a cancer and
[25:00] didn't fear and believed God would heal
[25:02] you, you wouldn't be in too bad a shape.
[25:05] Right? So cancer
[25:08] joined with fear
[25:11] takes even this belief and faith you
[25:13] have in God and creates an uncertainty
[25:16] in a room for the devil to work. But he
[25:19] says if you had cancer and didn't fear
[25:21] and believe God would heal you, you
[25:23] wouldn't be in too bad a shape.
[25:26] He put it this way. You know you have
[25:28] cancer. You believe God will heal you.
[25:30] and therefore you're not afraid of the
[25:31] cancer or you're YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF
[25:33] THE CONSEQUENCE REGARDLESS, then the
[25:35] cancer no longer has the greatest power
[25:37] it could have over you because he says
[25:39] the worst THING THE DEVIL CAN PUT on you
[25:41] is fear.
[25:42] The worst thing isn't cancer. No, the
[25:44] worst thing is fear. Because if you had
[25:45] cancer and didn't fear it, you wouldn't
[25:47] be in too bad a shape.
[25:49] So he's saying he's pointing out how the
[25:51] devil's ultimate objective is NOT SO
[25:54] MUCH THE ACT OR THE CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT
[25:56] rather the fear that's joined with it.
[25:58] He said God will take care of that if
[26:00] you were sick whatever it is if you
[26:01] didn't fear. So fear is one of the worst
[26:04] things that Satan can place upon the
[26:06] person.
[26:08] That's why Jesus says let not your heart
[26:09] be troubled. Let it not be afraid.
[26:12] He says fear God. Fear him alone. We
[26:15] have only believe. Fear not. Fear not.
[26:18] Only believe. Be not afraid. Only
[26:20] believe. It's joined. The belief is
[26:22] often joined with this admonishment.
[26:24] Don't be afraid. Because faith that's
[26:26] unhindered by fear, has liberty, ACCEPTS
[26:30] GOD'S PROMISES, ACCEPTS GOD'S DECISION,
[26:33] AND CAN WALK in a in a sure path, NOT
[26:35] WORRIED ABOUT THE OUTCOME, BUT KNOWING
[26:37] THAT THERE'S A GOD THAT HOLDS you and
[26:39] will uphold you.
[26:41] Brother says, "One of the greatest
[26:42] curses on the church today is fear."
[26:45] Everybody's scared to death.
[26:47] I think that would fit today.
[26:48] Amen.
[26:49] It's one of the greatest curs curses on
[26:51] the church today. And if if faith is the
[26:54] ultimate, fear is the opposite.
[26:58] And and fear is no evidence of anything.
[27:02] Faith is an evidence.
[27:05] A and fear is not an evidence.
[27:09] So if we're fearful, if there if there
[27:12] if there's things coming, that places
[27:14] you in a situation to where you can be
[27:16] tempted.
[27:19] But, Brother Brandham, in in in reading
[27:21] these scriptures and referencing this
[27:22] quote and these statements, I want you
[27:25] to recognize that that's the worst thing
[27:26] is fear.
[27:29] That in the time of uncertainty, when we
[27:31] don't know what tomorrow holds, let's
[27:32] not be afraid of it.
[27:34] We're not sure which direction this
[27:35] could go and we realize it's a lot of
[27:37] different directions it can go. And we
[27:39] get the sense from one side that there's
[27:41] this is a slippery slope that if certain
[27:42] people take office then it's just a
[27:44] snowball rolling downhill and it's just
[27:46] going to be very quickly enter into a
[27:48] certain space or this other side
[27:49] happens. Well, this is going to happen.
[27:51] Listen, it's just the wheels of prophecy
[27:52] that we're concerned about.
[27:54] But at the end of the day, regardless of
[27:57] what the future holds, we should not
[27:59] fear.
[28:01] For in a time of trouble, he's promised
[28:04] to keep you. Amen.
[28:06] The Lord is my light in my salvation. He
[28:08] is the strength of my life. Who am I
[28:09] going to be afraid of? Whom shall I
[28:11] fear? Whatever powers it be, God can
[28:14] will only use to fulfill his word.
[28:17] AND YOU ARE PART of his word.
[28:19] There's nothing to fear. In Romans
[28:22] chapter 8 14 to 15, for as many as are
[28:25] led by the spirit of God,
[28:28] they are the sons of God.
[28:30] Now
[28:32] he contrasts this leadership immediately
[28:35] by this. For ye have not received the
[28:38] spirit of a bondage again to fear.
[28:41] But ye have received the spirit of
[28:42] adoption whereby we cry aba father.
[28:47] Sons and daughters of God are led by the
[28:50] spirit of God not by fear.
[28:53] Whenever fear is motivating you to do
[28:55] something, hold steady.
[28:58] If it's fear that's prompting you to
[29:00] make a decision. If it's fear that's
[29:01] prompting you to do something, then hold
[29:03] steady and wait till you can be led by
[29:05] faith.
[29:06] Amen.
[29:07] Hold steady. Say, "Lord, this looks like
[29:09] the right way to go, but I feel that
[29:10] fear is the motivating factor. Fear is
[29:12] the thing that's pushing me." THEN HOLD
[29:13] STEADY. TAKE A STEP BACK. JUST WAIT a
[29:15] moment. Be a and and resolve. Say,
[29:18] "Lord, I can't move by fear. Fear of
[29:20] consequence, fear of man, fear of
[29:22] situation. I got to be moved by faith."
[29:25] So sons and daughters of God are led by
[29:27] the spirit of God. They are not moved
[29:29] and motivated by fear. THEY ARE NOT
[29:31] UNDER THE bondage of fear.
[29:35] So we are not motivated by the fear of
[29:36] harm. Oh, do this because you're going
[29:38] to miss out. So many times we make
[29:40] decisions that are very foolish and not
[29:43] very prudent even from a carnal
[29:44] standpoint when it comes to being
[29:46] financially responsible. But we do it
[29:48] because of the fear of missing out.
[29:50] Oh, you better get in on THIS
[29:51] OPPORTUNITY. YOU BETTER BUY THIS PIECE
[29:53] OF PROPERTY. WE'VE ALL BOUGHT A PIECE OF
[29:54] PROPERTY FROM THIS GUY. JUMP IN THERE,
[29:55] BUY A PIECE OF PROPERTY. YOU BETTER DO
[29:57] IT. YOU'RE GOING TO MISS OUT. LIKE, OH,
[29:59] OH MY GOODNESS. WE BETTER HURRY UP AND
[30:00] do it. WE BETTER DO IT. AND IT TURNS OUT
[30:02] THERE'S NO PROPERTY TO BUY.
[30:04] Turns out the real It's just snake oil
[30:06] at the end of the day. But you only did
[30:07] it because you wanted you didn't want to
[30:10] miss out. It was the FEAR OF MISSING OUT
[30:12] THAT motivated you to act, not the faith
[30:14] and the confidence that this was an
[30:15] opportunity that God was going to use to
[30:17] bless you.
[30:19] In Hebrewsap 11:7 it says by faith Noah
[30:21] being warned of God of things not seen
[30:23] as yet. So God warned him a four time he
[30:27] knew the things that were to be. It says
[30:28] moved with fear based upon what God had
[30:31] said prepared an arc to the saving of
[30:32] his house by the which he condemned the
[30:34] world and became heir of the
[30:36] righteousness which is by faith. So in
[30:39] the face OF DESTRUCTION, WHEN GOD HAD
[30:41] TOLD NOAH that the entire world was
[30:43] going to be destroyed, he was moved by
[30:45] the fear of God, not the oncoming
[30:48] judgment.
[30:50] NOAH WASN'T MOVED, OH, THERE'S GOING TO
[30:51] BE A FLOOD AND EVERYONE'S GOING TO DIE.
[30:53] HE WAS MOVED ACCORDING to the promise
[30:55] that God had given him. Because he
[30:57] wasn't left without a way of escape.
[30:59] Oh, the sin of man has come before me.
[31:01] Every man's thoughts are only wicked
[31:03] continually. I'm going to destroy the
[31:04] people from the face of the earth. And
[31:06] Noah didn't say, "Oh my goodness, I
[31:07] better figure out a way to escape it."
[31:09] No, he took the promise that wherein God
[31:11] said, "But I'm going to command you to
[31:13] build an ark that'll be for the saving
[31:14] of you and your household. Do exactly
[31:16] what I said, and you won't fall victim
[31:19] to the flood."
[31:20] So, he was moved by fear, not of the
[31:22] judgment that was coming, but the
[31:24] reverence and respect for God that gave
[31:26] him a promise. HE HAD RESPECT, JUST AS
[31:28] NOAH does later in this chapter, unto
[31:31] the promise. So when it says he moved
[31:33] with fear, it was his fear of God. As
[31:35] Jesus said, fear him
[31:38] in light of the warning of God, the
[31:40] things that were to come on the earth,
[31:41] he was moved with his reverence and
[31:43] respect and his ALL FOR GOD TO do what
[31:45] his word said to to to believe that the
[31:48] ark was a way of safety.
[31:51] If he had been moved by the fear of
[31:53] judgment, he might have thought, "God,
[31:54] there's no way this ark's going to
[31:56] float. There's no way this is going to
[31:58] work. This is no way this is the way
[32:00] out." He would have been he would have
[32:02] hesitated. He would have tried to amend,
[32:04] add to, take away.
[32:06] In Psalms 37:es 23-2, remember these
[32:10] statements for later. The steps of a
[32:12] good man are ordered by the Lord.
[32:16] This the the the they that are the sons
[32:18] of God, sons and daughters of God. This
[32:20] is what characterizes you. You are led
[32:22] by the spirit of God, not man.
[32:26] You're moved by faith, not carnal fear.
[32:31] And so it says, "The steps of a good man
[32:33] are ordered by the Lord." God is
[32:35] ordering your steps. God determines your
[32:39] bounds. God determines your direction.
[32:41] Yes, we go wayward and yes, there's
[32:42] things wherein we reap what we sow and
[32:45] and there's a path that we could take
[32:46] where we're very stubborn and it's God's
[32:48] permissive will. But God, the steps of a
[32:50] good man are ordered by the Lord and he
[32:52] delightth in his way. Either way you
[32:55] want to look at it. Either God delights
[32:56] in your way when you're taking the steps
[32:58] he's ordered or you delight in God's way
[33:01] and the steps that he has ordered for
[33:02] you. AND THOUGH THAT'S THE PATH THAT I
[33:04] want to take.
[33:06] If God had ordained a path of suffering
[33:09] for me, I would be better off to take
[33:11] that PATH THAN THE TRAIL THAT I could
[33:13] blaze that didn't have suffering. YOU'RE
[33:16] BETTER OFF TAKING THE PATH THAT GOD HAS
[33:18] ORDAINED FOR YOU, REGARDLESS OF THE
[33:20] DIFFICULTIES THAT S that are are in that
[33:22] path and how treacherous IT MAY SEEM.
[33:24] YOU'RE BETTER OFF TAKING THE HARD WAY,
[33:26] THE DIFFICULT WAY, THE NARROW WAY THAT
[33:28] GOD HAS ORDAINED THAN THE BROAD WAY THAT
[33:30] SEEMS easy and pleasing to you.
[33:32] Lord,
[33:32] so his steps, he has ordered steps for
[33:35] us. And it says, though he fall, he
[33:37] shall not be utterly cast down. So
[33:40] there's times in our lives where we face
[33:42] difficulty. We fall on our knees. We're
[33:44] broken. We're we're we're upset. We we
[33:47] we uh we're not fortunate with our
[33:49] circumstances. THOUGH HE FALL, HE SHALL
[33:51] NOT BE UTTERLY CAST DOWN. SO, WE'RE
[33:53] NEVER fearful of being utterly cast
[33:55] down.
[33:57] As Paul said, we're cast down, but not
[33:59] forsaken. WE MAY FALL, BUT WE'RE NOT
[34:00] WORRIED ABOUT being cast into the abyss
[34:03] or a bottomless pit. FOR THE LORD
[34:04] UPHOLDETH him with his hand. Even when
[34:08] you've fallen, you're still in his hand.
[34:10] And then he says this to join the
[34:13] confidence of the good man as he walks
[34:15] in the steps that he's supposed to walk
[34:17] in. Even though he may fall, he says,"I
[34:20] have been young and now I'm old. I have
[34:21] a lot of experience is another way that
[34:23] David is saying it. Yet have I not seen
[34:25] the righteous forsaken, nor his seed
[34:27] begging bread.
[34:30] I I am my life and this scripture holds
[34:32] true as David. I join my amen with
[34:35] David. I've never seen the righteous
[34:36] forsaken nor his seed begging bread.
[34:40] This is the promise that's expressed.
[34:42] We're led by the spirit of God. Even in
[34:44] the face of dire warnings and things
[34:46] that are to come, we know we're upholded
[34:48] by his hand. We're moved by faith in the
[34:51] promise, not fear of the things that
[34:52] might be. Because it's God that
[34:54] determines our steps. It's actually his
[34:57] love for you that's ordering your life.
[35:00] Because what does it say in Romans
[35:01] chapter 8:35? Who shall separate us from
[35:03] the love of Christ? Other words, the
[35:05] love of Christ is always there as a
[35:07] buffer.
[35:09] the the love of Christ is the safety
[35:10] net.
[35:12] The love OF CHRIST IS THE BOUNDARY.
[35:15] WHAT WAS IT WHEN GOD, Brother Bradam,
[35:17] dramatizes the the the the curse in the
[35:19] garden? A and he and he dramatizes it as
[35:22] they've already been banished and the
[35:24] ground has been cursed and they've
[35:25] already been dressed in these bleeding
[35:26] skins and as THEY'RE WALKING AWAY
[35:28] DEJECTED AND TORN, ALL OF A SUDDEN GOD
[35:31] SAYS, "STOP."
[35:32] AND BROTHER BAM DESCRIBES IT THAT WHAT
[35:34] DID THAT WAS LOVE DID that love did not
[35:37] allow Adam and the woman to leave FROM
[35:40] THE PRESENCE OF GOD WITHOUT A PROMISE OF
[35:43] REDEMPTION OR RESTORATION. SO YOUR LIFE
[35:45] CAN RUN A FOUL. YOUR LIFE CAN RUN A MUCK
[35:47] AND YOU CAN GO WAY FAR AND YOU CAN GO
[35:49] WAY DEEP. BUT THERE'S A BUFFER OF BLOOD
[35:51] AND THERE'S A LOVE BARRIER THAT'S GOING
[35:53] TO STOP YOU FROM GOING TOO far
[35:56] because his love will uphold you.
[35:58] NOTHING CAN SEPARATE you from the love
[36:00] of Christ. You can run as hard as you
[36:02] can. You can dig as deep as you want.
[36:04] YOU CAN GO AS HIGH AS YOU WANT TO GO.
[36:05] THOUGH I MAKE MY BED IN HELL, Y LO you
[36:07] are THERE WITH ME. WHY? HIS LOVE
[36:09] surrounds you. His love IS A BARRIER.
[36:12] HIS LOVE IS A HEDGE. HIS LOVE IS A
[36:14] PROTECTION. NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE ALLOWS
[36:16] US TO SUFFER IN BETWEEN. His love
[36:18] surrounds you. It'll keep you. It'll
[36:20] protect you because it's his love that's
[36:22] directing you in the end.
[36:26] And the message recognizing your day in
[36:28] its message.
[36:30] But the man says, "Israel's back there
[36:32] in her homeland.
[36:34] She don't know how she got back there.
[36:35] She was just automatically put back
[36:37] there." He says, "Why? National force
[36:40] put her in her place." Now, I'm going to
[36:42] say something. National force put Israel
[36:44] in her homeland. National force will put
[36:46] the church in the World Council of
[36:48] Churches. Now, there's a lot of
[36:51] different ways that you could group
[36:52] everybody together, but brother Brandham
[36:54] is essentially grouping all all of
[36:56] humanity under the power of national
[36:59] force.
[37:00] The Jews are moved by national force,
[37:03] exterior, physical, natural persecution.
[37:06] That that's what put Israel in their
[37:08] homeland. He's saying that national
[37:10] force, whether it be regulation and
[37:12] governments, a and this is this is
[37:14] preached in the summer of 64. brother
[37:16] sent me a banner and it said summer 64.
[37:19] I said, "Please tell me you're writing a
[37:20] song."
[37:22] But it's and he says it when he preaches
[37:25] at the time where he's preaching feast
[37:26] of the trumpets. So it's a week after he
[37:28] preaches feast of the trumpets. So he's
[37:30] he's joining this thought with things
[37:32] he's just said earlier how that all
[37:34] these things organizations and politics
[37:37] and governments and armies and economies
[37:39] and ALL THOSE THINGS THAT CAN only put
[37:42] the worldly churches and the
[37:43] denominations in their organizations.
[37:46] National force deals with Israel.
[37:48] National force deals with everyone else
[37:50] because everyone else is subject to
[37:52] national force. When the government does
[37:53] this, when this happens, when that
[37:54] happens, we all as humans, as citizens
[37:56] or whatever, are subject to the the rule
[37:59] of law and the governments and the
[38:01] decisions and the powers that exist
[38:03] within economies and municipalities and
[38:05] governments. And that's what puts
[38:07] citizens and and entities and
[38:09] institutions and organizations in their
[38:11] place. HE SAYS, "BUT THE POWER OF GOD
[38:13] WILL PUT THE PEOPLE IN the bride.
[38:15] Listen, we're not waiting for the right
[38:17] president to be elected to put the
[38:19] people in the bride. Oh my goodness, how
[38:21] far off the message have we GOTTEN IF
[38:23] WE'RE WAITING FOR JUST THE RIGHT
[38:25] PRESIDENT in order for the message to be
[38:26] effective?
[38:27] Well, I'm just waiting for there to be a
[38:29] woman with a skirt on in the
[38:30] PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE BEFORE WHAT? BEFORE
[38:32] WHAT?
[38:35] IF THAT IF THAT IS IN fact a thus sayeth
[38:38] the Lord that there must be a female
[38:41] president
[38:42] among the many genders that presently
[38:44] exist
[38:46] and there's going to be one that at
[38:47] least identifies maybe Trump will bail
[38:49] us out if he gets voted out. Maybe
[38:51] before the end of the year he'll
[38:52] identify as a female.
[38:56] I'm kidding.
[38:59] But even if that's true, that has no
[39:02] bearing on your election. That has no
[39:05] bearing on your RAPTURING FAITH.
[39:07] THAT WOULD ONLY deal with the church
[39:09] carnal.
[39:11] THAT WOULD ONLY HAVE RAMIFICATIONS TO
[39:13] OTHER TO TO OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S
[39:14] THE POWER OF GOD THAT PUTS YOU IN THE
[39:16] BRIDE AND IT'S THE POWER OF GOD THAT
[39:18] GIVES YOU RAPTURING FAITH.
[39:20] Not listen, even though we're taught
[39:22] that Israel is a calendar and Israel is
[39:24] a time piece and there's things that
[39:26] happen in Israel that can give us
[39:28] indications and signs as to where WE
[39:29] ARE, BUT YOU'RE NOT STARING AT THE
[39:31] CLOCK.
[39:33] You don't just, oh, what did Israel do
[39:35] today? That because that's NOT WHERE OUR
[39:37] RAPTURING FAITH IS.
[39:39] WE'RE NOT just waiting for this red heer
[39:41] TO BE SLAIN, PUT ON THIS BRAZEN ALTAR OR
[39:44] SOMETHING TO HAPPEN IN ISRAEL TO GIVE US
[39:46] OUR RAPTURING FAITH. We've received what
[39:48] we need for rapturing faith. It is in
[39:51] the word. It is in this opening of the
[39:53] seals. THIS IS WHAT THE BRIDE'S FOOD.
[39:55] THE HIDDEN MANA. THE RAPTURING FAITH IS
[39:57] CONTAINED IN THE BODY WORD OF THE SON OF
[40:00] MAN. THAT'S WHAT I MUST FEED ON TO FLY
[40:02] OUT OF HERE.
[40:04] So all these external pressures and
[40:06] these things that are out there, God can
[40:08] use them and utilize them. And there's
[40:09] things that give us signs, things that
[40:11] give our attention. But at the end of
[40:13] the day, we're not looking to them to
[40:15] receive our positioning and to receive
[40:16] our rapture faith. We're looking to the
[40:18] power of God to do that.
[40:20] The power of God will put the people in
[40:21] the bride. So he says, "The world forces
[40:23] this way. The world forces that way, but
[40:25] God forces upward."
[40:27] So worldly force can't do for you what
[40:29] you want it to.
[40:31] The spirit of God, which is the word of
[40:32] God. My spirit is, my word is spirit and
[40:35] life. That's how sons and daughters of
[40:36] God are led. According to Romans 8, he
[40:39] says that by word is spirit and life
[40:40] WILL PUT THE BRIDE IN HER place cuz
[40:43] she'll recognize her position in the
[40:45] word that she's in Christ will put her
[40:47] in her place. No national force would do
[40:50] it, but the national force did drive
[40:52] Israel to the homeland. The national
[40:53] forces of the council of churches will
[40:55] drive every organization into it. But
[40:57] the power of God will raise the bride
[40:59] into glory out of it. Amen.
[41:03] I'm not worried about the being shuttled
[41:05] like cattle into a polling station where
[41:08] I'm going to have to choose which
[41:10] denomination do you want to go to and
[41:12] I'm going to have to stand there with a
[41:14] uh well maybe if guns get outlawed they
[41:16] won't have an AK-47 pointed at my head.
[41:18] They they'll have a green poison that
[41:20] they're going to put on my tongue and
[41:21] cause me to die. And I'm sitting there,
[41:24] OH MY GOODNESS, I'VE GOT TO CHOOSE. NO,
[41:26] THE THOSE forces work on denominations
[41:28] if they're to BE
[41:30] ALL THAT. BUT THE POWER OF GOD IS WHAT
[41:32] PUTS THE BRIDE IN HER PLACE. IT'S THE
[41:33] POWER OF GOD THAT'S GOING TO WORK WITHIN
[41:34] HER HEART TO GIVE HER POWER over her
[41:36] death for the time and the hour that she
[41:37] needs it.
[41:40] Now, in John chapter 16,
[41:45] there's Jesus.
[41:49] There's a number of things he says in
[41:50] this chapter, but I'm just going to pick
[41:52] up here in the first and then skip a
[41:54] little bit. John chapter 16:es 1-4.
[41:57] These things have I spoken unto you that
[42:00] you should not be offended. Again, he's
[42:01] saying hard things, difficult things,
[42:03] but he's not saying them to cause an
[42:06] offense.
[42:08] They shall put you. Now, notice what he
[42:10] says next. And say, well, this is
[42:12] offensive, right? They shall put you out
[42:14] of the synagogues. Yay, the time cometh
[42:16] that whosoever kleth you will think that
[42:18] he doeth God's service. Now, if you're
[42:20] picking up what he's laying down, he's
[42:22] saying you're going to get kicked out of
[42:23] church and then they're going to murder
[42:24] you. And the one that murders you is
[42:26] going to think they're doing God a
[42:27] service. But don't be offended, right?
[42:30] No offense, but you're going to get
[42:32] kicked out of your church and you're
[42:33] going to be murdered. But no offense. He
[42:36] says, "And these things will they do
[42:37] unto you because THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN THE
[42:39] father nor me. But these things have I
[42:42] told you." Ponder this. You're going to
[42:44] get kicked out of church and you're
[42:45] going to be crucified. You're going to
[42:46] be murdered. You're all going to die at
[42:47] the hands of people who think they're
[42:49] doing God a God a service. But I told
[42:52] you that when the time shall come, you
[42:55] may REMEMBER THAT I TOLD YOU of them.
[42:58] Now, think about it. That doesn't seem
[42:59] very comforting. Oh, I'm dying. I
[43:02] remember Jesus told me I was going to
[43:03] die. Doesn't feel very good. Oh, they
[43:07] kicked ME OUT OF CHURCH. I REMEMBER
[43:08] JESUS SAYING THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
[43:09] OH, THEY'RE hanging me. They're
[43:11] crucifying. THEY'RE THEY'RE STONING ME
[43:12] TO DEATH. I REMEMBER JESUS SAID THIS WAS
[43:14] GOING TO HAPPEN. HE'S NOT the the
[43:16] phrasing of it isn't merely for you to
[43:18] go, "Oh, I remember this." but rather
[43:20] that WHEN IT HAPPENS, THE FACT THAT HE
[43:22] TOLD YOU BEFOREHAND gives you confidence
[43:25] that God knew and had a purpose for it.
[43:29] The very fact THAT I WAS WORN A FORWARD
[43:31] TIME MEANS THAT GOD KNEW OF ME. HE SAW
[43:33] ME IN THIS SITUATION. THIS HASN'T CAUGHT
[43:36] HIM BY SURPRISE, NOR HAS IT CAUGHT ME BY
[43:38] SURPRISE. THEREFORE, I WILL NOT DESPAIR
[43:40] OF THE CONSEQUENCE. I WILL NOT DESPAIR
[43:42] OF THE OUTCOME. I WILL NOT BE FEARFUL OF
[43:44] WHAT'S TAKING PLACE, BUT I WILL REST IN
[43:46] A GOD WHO TOLD ME IT WOULD HAPPEN
[43:48] BEFORE. AND IF HE KNEW WHAT WOULD
[43:49] HAPPEN, IT WOULD HAPPEN BEFORE THEN HE
[43:51] KNOWS WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE.
[43:55] He says that when the time shall come,
[43:56] you may remember that I told you of
[43:58] them.
[44:02] And these things I said not unto you at
[44:05] the beginning, but because I was with
[44:08] you.
[44:10] So Jesus is warning them of things ahead
[44:12] of time
[44:15] and what they were to face. Now, to
[44:17] them, this was a physical scattering.
[44:20] I I I thought about this, the uh the
[44:23] Waffle House wounded, all the people
[44:25] have been scattered, scattered,
[44:26] scattered, and covered, and chunked, or
[44:27] whatever it is. I thought of all these
[44:29] different ways that the devil can try to
[44:30] beat up the body of Christ on his flat
[44:33] top griddle.
[44:35] But Jesus is speaking of a literal
[44:37] persecution, physical persecution,
[44:40] physical scattering. You're going to be
[44:41] scattered. YOU'RE GOING TO BE CHASED out
[44:43] of churches. You're going to be killed.
[44:44] You're going to be put to death. But
[44:46] those that put you to death are doing it
[44:48] because they don't know me. They don't
[44:49] know the father. They think they're
[44:50] doing God God a service, but it's not
[44:53] his will. And he's saying, but when this
[44:54] happens, remember I told you beforehand.
[44:57] So this is I want to focus on this
[45:00] aspect. And I'm going to jump to verses
[45:02] 31 and 33 here in a moment. The prophecy
[45:04] was not meant to cause fear.
[45:08] Jesus was not telling them that they
[45:10] were going to be kicked out of church so
[45:11] they would be afraid of being kicked out
[45:13] of church. He wasn't they he didn't want
[45:15] to become uh cause trepidation. HE
[45:17] DIDN'T WANT TO CAUSE DREAD. OH, WHEN is
[45:18] this going to happen? When is that going
[45:19] to happen? It was NOT MEANT TO INSPIRE
[45:22] fear of what was to come, BUT RATHER TO
[45:24] QUICKEN AND INSPIRE comfort and peace.
[45:27] He was telling this be them this
[45:29] beforehand. Even though it was a
[45:31] terrible THING TO PONDER, EVEN THOUGH IT
[45:33] WAS A HORRIBLE REALITY and if IT WOULD
[45:34] HAVE WASHED OVER them and they would
[45:35] have accepted it, sure it would have
[45:37] been normal for them to be FEARFUL AND
[45:38] DREADFUL OF WHAT THESE CONSEQUENCES
[45:40] WOULD BE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE
[45:42] PROPHECY INTENDED. THE PROPHECY INTENDED
[45:44] that they say IF JESUS IS TELLING ME
[45:47] BEFOREHAND THAT THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO
[45:48] HAPPEN, I'M NOT AFRAID OF WHAT'S GOING
[45:50] TO HAPPEN, BUT I I WILL I REALIZE THAT
[45:53] GOD IS PREPARING ME. THIS GIVES ME
[45:55] COMFORT. This gives me strength.
[45:58] So, he's actually wanting THEM TO HAVE
[45:59] SHOULDERS back
[46:02] just like Peter ultimately did.
[46:05] Stephen, think about it. WHAT DID HOW
[46:08] did they face the persecution?
[46:11] Jesus even told Peter, "Peter, man,
[46:13] you're real quick to draw the sword.
[46:14] You're you're real quick to fight, but
[46:16] let me tell you something. You don't
[46:16] have what it takes yet."
[46:20] And he says, "Satan's desired to sift
[46:22] you like wheat." And he says, "But I've
[46:24] prayed for you." And he says, "And when
[46:26] thou art converted, no, if when
[46:29] strengthen the brethren."
[46:32] And then he and then Jesus told him,
[46:34] Peter, you're going to deny me. Why?
[46:35] Without that birth, without that new
[46:36] that resolve, he he did. He ended up
[46:38] denied the very one that drew the sword.
[46:41] But then one day, Peter had an audience.
[46:44] Something changed within Peter's heart.
[46:45] Peter was quickened to life. And then
[46:46] Peter could stand unafraid.
[46:49] And you look at his testimony.
[46:51] Even as Jesus prophesied to him and told
[46:54] him about his death, Peter could face
[46:55] it. Stevie could face it. All of them
[46:57] faced it in the face of death. And I
[46:58] imagine what they remembered is Jesus
[47:01] said,
[47:02] the word said, and they didn't have to
[47:04] shrink. They didn't have to be fearful.
[47:05] They didn't have to try to come up with
[47:06] some kind of contingency. They didn't
[47:08] have to plead. They didn't have to beg.
[47:09] They didn't have to compromise. Why?
[47:11] They knew the word had already spoken
[47:14] and they could face it with peace.
[47:17] And Jesus says it exactly this way in
[47:19] verses 31 and 33. Jesus answered and
[47:22] said, "Do ye now believe?"
[47:25] Now, he's trying he he's wanting them to
[47:28] think of their faith. Do you really have
[47:29] faith? Do you believe? Now if you really
[47:31] believe he says behold the hour cometh
[47:33] is now come that ye shall be scattered
[47:35] every man to his own. So what Jesus
[47:38] prophesied at the beginning of this
[47:41] chapter as we read it in a chapter was
[47:44] Jesus prophesied it earlier in his
[47:46] conversation to them.
[47:48] Do you have faith? Do you really believe
[47:50] me? He says then the time is now that
[47:52] what I told you beforehand. You're going
[47:54] to be scattered every man to his own and
[47:56] shall leave me alone. Yet I am not alone
[47:58] because the father is with me. He says,
[48:00] "These things I have spoken unto you.
[48:02] The persecution, the kicking out of
[48:04] church, the killing, being scattered.
[48:06] I've spoken these things unto you that
[48:08] in me you might have peace.
[48:11] In the world you shall have tribulation,
[48:12] but be of good fe of good cheer. I have
[48:16] overcome the world.
[48:19] Yes, in the world you're going to suffer
[48:20] tribulation. IN THE WORLD, YOU'RE going
[48:22] to suffer even physical DEATH." HE'S
[48:23] TELLING THE DISCIPLES, "BUT I'VE SAID
[48:25] THESE THINGS UNTO YOU THAT IN MY WORD
[48:27] YOU WOULD HAVE PEACE." AMEN.
[48:29] THEN IN WHAT I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO YOU,
[48:31] I'VE GIVEN YOU THE THE FAITH BY THE WORD
[48:34] OF GOD TO FACE THE CHALLENGE BECAUSE
[48:36] THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE ORDAINED TO. THE
[48:38] SPIRIT OF GOD IS GOING to lead you to
[48:39] this challenge. It's going to lead you
[48:41] TO THIS PLACE. STANDING FOR MY WORD,
[48:43] STANDING FOR THE TRUTH, STANDING FOR WHO
[48:44] I AM AS A SON OF GOD IS GOING TO PUT YOU
[48:46] IN THE PLACE AS A JEW WHERE ONE DAY
[48:48] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE YOUR
[48:49] ACCUSERS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE
[48:50] ANGRY JEWS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE
[48:52] STONING, FACE CRUCIFIXION. BUT I HAVE
[48:54] ALREADY TOLD YOU NOW BEFOREHAND, YOU'VE
[48:56] GOT THIS. YES,
[49:00] you were made FOR THIS, PETER. YOU WERE
[49:03] MADE FOR THIS, STEPHEN. YOU I'VE I'VE
[49:05] SPOKEN THIS BEFOREHAND THAT IN ME YOU
[49:07] MIGHT HAVE PEACE REGARDLESS OF WHAT'S IN
[49:09] THE WORLD, YOU CAN STAND STRONG,
[49:10] SHOULDERS BACK, KNOWING WHO YOU ARE.
[49:15] WHY? Because the prophecy was meant to
[49:17] cause faith.
[49:19] Even if it might seem very, very
[49:21] terrible, very, very fearful, it was
[49:24] meant to inspire faith.
[49:26] Therefore, there is no prophecy of
[49:27] trouble
[49:29] that ought to cause us to tense up or be
[49:31] in fear.
[49:33] If if Brother Brandham had prophesied,
[49:36] thus sayeth the Lord, on November 3rd,
[49:39] 2020,
[49:41] there will be a magnitude 12.0
[49:43] earthquake that's going to strike the
[49:45] world, and it was thus sayeth the Lord,
[49:48] and the whole world is going to be
[49:49] shook. We should have no reason to be
[49:51] fearful.
[49:52] Amen.
[49:53] REGARDLESS OF HOW DIRE THE PROPHECY is
[49:55] and I made that up that don't try to
[49:57] find that.
[49:59] I'm just using it maybe as an extreme
[50:00] example just just to make the point that
[50:03] NO MATTER HOW DIRE A prophecy may be, NO
[50:05] MATTER HOW BAD IT MAY SEEM, WELL, THE
[50:07] BIBLE SAYS THIS, THE message says that.
[50:09] NO PROPHECY OF TROUBLE, NO PROPHECY OF
[50:11] PERSECUTION, NO PROPHECY OF SUFFERING,
[50:14] NO PROPHECY OF BEING SCATTERED OR
[50:15] ANYTHING LIKE THAT OUGHT TO CAUSE US TO
[50:17] TENSE UP.
[50:20] NOTHING THAT NOTHING THAT WAS SPOKEN
[50:22] BEFOREHAND OF ANY TROUBLE TO COME SHOULD
[50:24] EVER INSPIRE US TO FEAR. BUT THE MESSAGE
[50:26] SAYS THIS, it should NOT INSPIRE FEAR.
[50:28] THE BIBLE SAYS THIS, IT SHOULD NOT
[50:30] INSPIRE FEAR because these THINGS HAVE I
[50:32] SPOKEN UNTO you that IN ME MY WORDS YOU
[50:34] MIGHT HAVE PEACE. THERE'S GOING TO BE
[50:35] TRIBULATION IN THE WORLD, BUT BE OF GOOD
[50:37] CHEER. I HAVE OVERCOME THE WORLD.
[50:41] REMEMBER WHEN THOSE TIMES COME, REMEMBER
[50:43] THAT I HAVE TOLD YOU of them.
[50:47] There's no prophecy.
[50:51] I I I'm very grateful to the Lord. I've
[50:54] been seeking the L. I seek the Lord for
[50:56] before every service and I not not just
[50:59] before service. I get here and say,
[51:00] "Okay, what should I preach?" But uh
[51:02] just throughout the week and I just felt
[51:04] something in my heart pulling on me,
[51:05] tugging on me. I said, "Lord, I want to
[51:07] be sure that I I I minister the right
[51:09] things." And God began to deal with me
[51:10] on this subject. I began just to ponder
[51:12] it and and find certain scriptures come
[51:14] to my heart and different quotes. And
[51:16] then through the week, the tension and
[51:18] the stress and the pressure was getting
[51:21] so tremendous that my whole body was
[51:24] just physically tensing up to the point
[51:26] to where yesterday I was in so much pain
[51:28] I couldn't even breathe. It was hard for
[51:29] me to breathe, hard for me to
[51:30] concentrate. And I realized that I had
[51:33] so earnestly sought the Lord to know
[51:35] what is it that that you desire to speak
[51:38] to your people and I felt your stress
[51:41] because stress is different than
[51:43] happiness.
[51:44] We can be the happiest people in the
[51:45] world and be the most stressed out
[51:46] person on the block
[51:48] and so and and so that I could sense
[51:50] that stress and even a sister reached
[51:51] out to uh sister Elizabeth and was
[51:53] asking her questions and Elizabeth said
[51:55] what what should I say? I said well just
[51:56] wait till Sunday. We'll see if that
[51:58] helps because God has already had dealt
[52:00] with me on these things to share these
[52:02] things. There's nothing in the message
[52:04] that should cause us to hold our breath
[52:06] and tense up, rest.
[52:10] No matter how how how dire the prophecy
[52:13] may seem, no matter how terrible the
[52:15] future may seem to be in our eyes,
[52:18] because in a lot of ways, you might be
[52:19] marrying the word with an uncertainty
[52:22] and making it a lot more fearsome than
[52:23] it's supposed to be because you don't
[52:25] really know.
[52:28] So if your if your Frankenstein
[52:32] of uncertainty and prophecy starts to
[52:34] cause you fear, leave that creation
[52:36] alone.
[52:40] Now the body of Christ
[52:43] has always suffered trials.
[52:46] If if we're tensed up expecting trials
[52:48] to come, if we we have the sense that
[52:50] oh, it's going to be terrible times
[52:51] ahead and the economy is going to
[52:53] collapse and everyone's going to be uh
[52:54] uh housing market's going to be
[52:56] destroyed and gas prices are going to be
[52:57] $12. Whatever it might be, the body of
[53:00] Christ has always suffered trials.
[53:03] It's always gone through troubles and
[53:05] and tragedies.
[53:07] Even as groups, regional groups, or even
[53:09] as a body, there's a lot of different
[53:11] ways we can say that we've been a part
[53:12] of suffering. We've been a part of
[53:13] tragedies. Listen, the the body of
[53:16] Christ has not been exempt from death.
[53:19] The body of Christ has not been exempt
[53:20] from disease,
[53:22] hasn't been exempt from divorce. The
[53:24] things that CAN BE SO TERRIBLE AND
[53:26] gut-wrenching and and RIPPING APART OF
[53:28] DIVORCE AND disease and death AND
[53:30] DESTRUCTION, THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF
[53:31] THE BODY OF CHRIST, WE'VE ALL SUFFERED
[53:33] FROM THEM.
[53:35] The worst atrocities, THE GREATEST
[53:36] LOSSES, THE WORST FAILURES, NOBODY IN
[53:38] THE BODY OF CHRIST HAS been exempt from
[53:40] experiencing those things. As it says in
[53:43] 2 Timothy 3 11 and 12, persecutions,
[53:46] afflictions which came unto me at
[53:48] Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, what
[53:51] persecutions I endured, but out of them
[53:53] all the Lord delivered me. Now Paul just
[53:55] summarized a lot of abuse. You want to
[53:58] go back and read about these
[53:59] persecutions, the these afflictions
[54:01] which came to me at Antioch and Iconium
[54:03] and Lystra. He just kind of says it
[54:05] like, "Yeah, somebody called me a holy
[54:07] roller. Yeah, somebody said I was a
[54:08] false prophet. Boy, you should have seen
[54:10] what they posted on Facebook about me.
[54:12] None of that. I think it was Lystra. He
[54:15] was beaten and left for dead.
[54:17] He actually thought he was going to die.
[54:18] He says, "I was so far gone and thought
[54:20] I was going to die that I just trusted
[54:21] in a God that would raise me for the
[54:22] dead from the dead." In other words,
[54:24] Paul was so sure in his calling that he
[54:27] wasn't afraid of death because he knew
[54:30] that if he died, God would have to raise
[54:31] him up again because he had a work to
[54:32] do.
[54:33] SO, DEATH COMPLETELY LOST HIS POWER OVER
[54:35] HIM. YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME? OH, NEAT.
[54:36] I'm going to get raised from the dead.
[54:38] THAT WAS LITERALLY HIS RESPONSE. OKAY,
[54:40] THEN GOD MUST GOD IS going to have to
[54:42] raise me from the dead. That must be
[54:44] what's going to happen next BECAUSE HE
[54:46] SO WHATEVER THE DEVIL COULD DO TO HIM,
[54:48] IT LOST ITS POWER OVER HIM. We're going
[54:50] to break your arm. Well, all I need is
[54:51] one. We're going to break the other one.
[54:52] Well, then I must not need either of
[54:53] them.
[54:56] What is that? I heard a Baptist preacher
[54:58] say it one time. He said, "I'm going to
[55:00] He said, "Fight the devil till his arm
[55:01] fell off and then he and then he bite
[55:03] the devil till his teeth fell out and
[55:04] then gum him to death."
[55:07] That's exactly how we ought TO BE.
[55:09] IF THAT'S all I've got left, I'M GOING
[55:11] TO GUM THE DEVIL TO DEATH BECAUSE I
[55:12] WHATEVER I HAVE IS WHAT GOD WANTS ME TO
[55:14] USE.
[55:16] And then so he really summarizes a lot
[55:18] of terrible circumstances in a very
[55:20] quick way. But then he says, "Yay, in
[55:22] all that will live godly in Christ Jesus
[55:24] shall suffer persecution."
[55:28] Believers in all ages have suffered
[55:30] persecution.
[55:32] Believers in all ages have suffered
[55:34] devastation.
[55:35] They've been visited with disaster. And
[55:38] and this is now I could look at it this
[55:40] way. There's been believers that have
[55:41] been part of um regional catastrophes,
[55:43] whether it be a tsunami or an earthquake
[55:44] or fires and floods. There's believers
[55:46] that have um been negatively impacted.
[55:49] And that's a real uh uh sugary way to
[55:51] say death and disease and great loss and
[55:53] terrible tragedies to children and loved
[55:56] ones. But believers have around the
[55:58] world have ex um suffered loss. There's
[56:01] times where hurricanes can pass through
[56:02] and a church can testify, "We didn't
[56:04] lose one thing, not even a tree branch
[56:05] on the ground." But then a brother lose
[56:07] his entire house. And you don't go, "I
[56:11] wonder how much Netflix he's been
[56:12] watching." You don't do it. You just
[56:15] REALIZE THINGS HAPPEN. GOD ALLOWS IT FOR
[56:17] A PURPOSE. YOU DON'T DESPAIR. YOU DON'T
[56:19] YOU DON'T TRY TO BE THE one that says
[56:20] IT'S JUST THE JUDGMENTS OF GOD.
[56:23] The the believers through all ages have
[56:25] suffered great calamities. I reached out
[56:27] to brother Jason Demarss as I was
[56:29] pondering it this past week. I thought,
[56:30] man, he he could probably just tell me
[56:32] things that have happened within the
[56:33] last decade that believers around the
[56:36] world have gone through with respect to
[56:37] persecution. And he shared with me how
[56:39] that in Iran, dozens of ministers have
[56:41] been imprisoned.
[56:43] Churches have been shut down. Churches
[56:45] have had to go underground in in Iran.
[56:47] There's specific persecution on the
[56:51] believer in Iran because of the message
[56:53] of the hour and then even upon
[56:55] Christianity in general. In China,
[56:57] there's three ministers that are still
[56:58] in jail. Church services. Uh um that's
[57:02] why I tell brother Tom, brother Tom,
[57:03] don't worry about how you lead songs. In
[57:04] China, they can't even have a song
[57:06] service because it would alert their
[57:08] neighbors to the fact that something
[57:09] different's going on next door because
[57:11] they have to do things in secret. It
[57:13] can't be like this where you just put
[57:14] the sign on the door and everybody comes
[57:15] walking in and carrying Bibles and you
[57:17] know we'll work till Jesus comes and
[57:19] just letting everybody know we're a
[57:21] Christian. We got Malachi 4:5 on our
[57:23] license plate. You go to China and you
[57:24] can't let anybody know.
[57:27] So it's persecution, DOORS BEING SHUT,
[57:30] CHURCHES BEING UNDERGROUND. THIS HAPPENS
[57:32] ALL THE TIME.
[57:35] I remember a brother in Barus, brother
[57:36] Jason Watkins, sharing with me
[57:38] testimonies of being in in these uh
[57:40] these communistic countries where you
[57:42] couldn't have a CHURCH SERVICE. IT WAS
[57:43] ALWAYS UH uh uh had to be undercover. It
[57:46] had to be done in a way which was
[57:47] unassuming.
[57:49] In Pakistan, brother Anoir Javed, he
[57:51] received death threats for the message.
[57:54] Had his house and his church burned
[57:56] down.
[57:58] That's just within the last 10 to 15
[57:59] years.
[58:01] These are things that have happened to
[58:03] believers. These are things that
[58:04] happened to people who believe this
[58:06] message. So persecution, suffering,
[58:08] calamity, even if because of what you
[58:09] believe, the believer is not exempt from
[58:11] it.
[58:12] The Bible says in Psalms 34:19, "Many
[58:15] are the afflictions of the righteous,
[58:17] but the Lord deliver him out of them
[58:19] all."
[58:20] We could say that all that LIVE GODLY IN
[58:22] CHRIST JESUS SHALL SUFFER PERSECUTION.
[58:25] WE COULD say many are the afflictions of
[58:27] the righteous.
[58:30] AND SO THERE'S NO promise
[58:34] that says we will not sorrow.
[58:37] THERE'S NO PROMISE THAT SAYS WE WILL
[58:39] NEVER BE TROUBLED.
[58:42] And and and and I I would if I COULD IF
[58:45] I COULD FIND IT, THEN I WOULD USE ALL
[58:46] THOSE SCRIPTURES. I'D PUT TOGETHER A
[58:48] REALLY NICE SLIDE DECK AND AND I WOULD
[58:50] HAVE ALL THE QUOTES AND I'D PIECE IT
[58:51] TOGETHER AND BUTTON IT UP AND I WOULD
[58:53] PREACH FOUR HOURS KNOWING IT WOULD BE
[58:54] WORTH IT TO SAY, "LOOK, THE BIBLE HAS
[58:56] SAID THERE WILL BE NO SORROW. THERE'LL
[58:58] BE NO TROUBLE. THERE'LL BE NO DIFFICULTY
[59:00] IN THIS LIFE. EVERYTHING IS JUST GOING
[59:02] TO be peachy king. Everything's going to
[59:04] be perfect. YOU WON'T CRY. AND JUST LINE
[59:06] IT ALL UP FOR YOU. THE ONLY REASON WHY
[59:07] YOU'VE HAD ANY TROUBLE IS YOU DIDN'T
[59:09] KNOW ABOUT THESE VERSES.
[59:11] And you didn't know about these
[59:12] quotations. AND NOW THAT WE KNOW THEM,
[59:14] WE CAN LIVE THIS UH HAPPY LIFE WITH NO
[59:16] TROUBLE, NO CALAMITY. The next service,
[59:18] all of our loved ones ARE GOING TO GET
[59:19] BAPTIZED AND AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET A
[59:21] RAISE AND everything's going to be
[59:22] wonderful. You can BE DRIVING THE CAR
[59:23] YOU WANT. BUT LISTEN, I CAN'T FIND IN
[59:26] THE WORD A PROMISE THAT SAYS YOU WON'T
[59:27] SUFFER. I CAN'T FIND A PROMISE IN THE
[59:29] WORD THAT SAYS YOU WON'T SUFFER
[59:31] PERSECUTION. YOU WON'T WEEP. YOU WON'T
[59:33] SORROW. BUT I CAN SEE THAT HE'S PROMISED
[59:35] GOOD FROM IT.
[59:38] I can see that he's promised he'll never
[59:40] leave you in it.
[59:42] Trouble, suffering, difficulty,
[59:44] calamity, whatever it is, many are the
[59:46] afflictions of the righteous, but the
[59:47] Lord deliverth him out of them all.
[59:52] Romans chapter 8 verse 28. And we know
[59:55] that all things work together for good
[59:57] to them that love God, to them who are
[59:59] the called according to his purpose.
[1:00:04] How many have heard that voice that that
[1:00:05] verse before? Anybody ever heard that?
[1:00:07] Now, how many have quoted it before? I
[1:00:09] think even Jack's quoted it probably.
[1:00:12] Hey, funny story. Speaking of the donkey
[1:00:14] in the room, Jack walked up to someone
[1:00:16] visiting our house the other day and he
[1:00:17] said, "I'm Mike Kelly and I approve this
[1:00:19] message.
[1:00:20] [laughter]
[1:00:22] Oh boy.
[1:00:28] So the I I don't know if we have to plug
[1:00:31] Msali now since we're at church, but
[1:00:34] I thought that was funny.
[1:00:37] So he quotes all sorts of things.
[1:00:40] We know that all things work together
[1:00:43] for good.
[1:00:45] Now you ought to be certain that you are
[1:00:48] those that God loves. You are called
[1:00:50] according to his purpose. If you've
[1:00:52] accepted that, now that's the area devil
[1:00:54] will fight with you. To doubt whether or
[1:00:56] not he loves you, to doubt whether
[1:00:57] you're called, that's a different series
[1:00:58] alto together,
[1:00:59] right?
[1:01:00] But all it takes is a moment for that to
[1:01:02] be resolved.
[1:01:03] Doctrally, it's a series. You know,
[1:01:05] teaching wise, it's a series. But all it
[1:01:07] takes for a moment for you to resolve
[1:01:09] between you and God any doubt or any
[1:01:10] fear that he loves you. All it takes is
[1:01:13] a moment for him to resolve any question
[1:01:15] that you're the called. And if you're if
[1:01:16] you can rest in your calling and rest in
[1:01:18] his love, he says all things are working
[1:01:20] together for the good. A suffering is
[1:01:23] pregnant with the promise of glory. If
[1:01:25] you're suffering, glory is coming.
[1:01:28] Every trial, every difficulty has a
[1:01:30] promise
[1:01:31] because he says, "All things work
[1:01:33] together." All things work together for
[1:01:36] good.
[1:01:37] All things, no matter what it is, what
[1:01:40] things?
[1:01:42] All things. There's only one thing that
[1:01:44] doesn't work together for good. Nothing.
[1:01:49] BECAUSE GOD'S USING ALL THINGS. HE'S
[1:01:51] WORKING ALL THINGS TOGETHER FOR OUR
[1:01:52] GOOD. NOW, if you really want to scratch
[1:01:55] your head, the context of this, if you
[1:01:57] go back to Romans chapter 8, I wanted to
[1:01:58] read the whole chapter, but we're fast
[1:02:00] very quickly running out of time.
[1:02:02] The context OF WHAT PAUL IS SAYING IS
[1:02:04] SUFFERING, INFIRMITIES, TRIBULATION,
[1:02:08] DISTRESS, PERSECUTION, FAMINE, POVERTY,
[1:02:12] DANGER, DEATH.
[1:02:14] SO, he's not saying, you know, there's
[1:02:16] no more, you know, uh, quesadillas at
[1:02:19] Taco Bell, but all things work together
[1:02:21] for the good. There's no more, you know,
[1:02:23] hamburger meat at Freddy's or all these
[1:02:25] weird things that we've been suffering
[1:02:26] from this year because of the pandemic.
[1:02:28] What do you mean a a burger restaurant
[1:02:29] doesn't have burgers anymore?
[1:02:31] But that's not where it says ALL THINGS
[1:02:33] WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD. YEAH, YOU
[1:02:35] KNOW, YOU COULD GO SOMEWHERE AND THE
[1:02:36] DOORS ARE CLOSED, SO YOU GO SOMEWHERE
[1:02:37] else and you run into somebody. That's
[1:02:39] God working all things together for the
[1:02:41] good. It's applicable on every level.
[1:02:43] But the context is suffering,
[1:02:44] infirmities, tribulation, distress,
[1:02:46] persecution, famine, nakedness, peril,
[1:02:48] SWORD.
[1:02:50] THOSE things work together for the good.
[1:02:53] CAN ANY OF YOU TESTIFY THAT GOD WORKS
[1:02:56] ALL THINGS TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD?
[1:02:57] DISTRESS, POVERTY, DEATH, WHATEVER IT
[1:03:00] MAY BE. MY TESTIMONY IS IN THIS THERE IS
[1:03:03] GOOD.
[1:03:06] Brother Brandham says in the church age
[1:03:08] book, he may commit you to death as he
[1:03:10] did Paul. He may commit you to suffering
[1:03:11] as he did Job. That is his prerogative.
[1:03:13] He is sovereign, but it is all with a
[1:03:15] purpose. If he did not have a purpose,
[1:03:17] then he would be the author of
[1:03:18] frustration and not of peace.
[1:03:22] His purpose is that after we have
[1:03:23] suffered a while, we would be made
[1:03:25] perfect, be established, strengthened,
[1:03:28] and settled.
[1:03:31] No matter what it is, this is a known
[1:03:33] known.
[1:03:36] We know this. No matter what happens, I
[1:03:39] know his purpose is that I be made
[1:03:41] perfect,
[1:03:42] be established, strengthened, and
[1:03:44] settled.
[1:03:50] If he if he didn't have a purpose,
[1:03:53] what we go through authors frustration
[1:03:55] and not peace.
[1:03:58] So, it's not what we go through that
[1:04:00] determines whether or not we have peace
[1:04:02] or frustration,
[1:04:04] but it's the understanding and
[1:04:06] revelation that if I'm going through it,
[1:04:08] he has a purpose.
[1:04:10] He says, "These things I've spoken to
[1:04:12] you that in me you might have peace.
[1:04:14] When these things happen, remember that
[1:04:15] I told you before so that he's the
[1:04:18] author of peace, not frustration."
[1:04:21] There's a part place in the scripture
[1:04:23] John 7:30
[1:04:25] he says then they sought to take him but
[1:04:28] no man laid hands on him because his
[1:04:31] hour was not yet come. What governed the
[1:04:35] powers that be around Jesus? The
[1:04:37] prophecy, not the people, not the
[1:04:40] politics, not the rhetoric, not the
[1:04:42] hatred. They wanted to crucify him. They
[1:04:45] were looking to do it.
[1:04:47] and that they that sought to take him,
[1:04:50] they wanted to take him, but they
[1:04:52] couldn't because his hour was not yet
[1:04:54] come.
[1:04:56] That means prophecy is what determines
[1:04:58] your destiny.
[1:05:00] WHAT GOD HAS SPOKEN IS WHAT'S GOING TO
[1:05:02] TAKE UH going to rule the day in your
[1:05:04] life. THEREFORE, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
[1:05:06] IF THERE'S A PURPOSE, GOD'S PURPOSE
[1:05:08] CANNOT BE THWARTED. GOD'S PURPOSE CANNOT
[1:05:10] BE UPSET. WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF WHAT MAN
[1:05:13] CAN DO TO US BECAUSE WHATEVER MAN DOES,
[1:05:15] GOD WILL ONLY ALLOW IT TO FULFILL HIS
[1:05:17] PURPOSE.
[1:05:19] He says it didn't happen. They couldn't
[1:05:20] take HOLD OF HIM BECAUSE HIS HOUR WAS
[1:05:23] NOT YET COME.
[1:05:27] OKAY. NOW, I want to blame you all for
[1:05:29] this service being so long.
[1:05:32] I I'll wait to blame you, but I'm just
[1:05:36] flat out running out of time here.
[1:05:38] So uh let me let me just try to um
[1:05:41] navigate this.
[1:05:45] If the bride faces persecution,
[1:05:50] specific persecution, because of the
[1:05:52] results of an election and certain
[1:05:54] powers being in the in the Senate and
[1:05:56] being in the House and and and
[1:05:58] governments changing and everything, if
[1:06:00] the bride's going to face it, if because
[1:06:02] of economic fallout, there's a global
[1:06:04] famine or this the diseases that are
[1:06:06] taking place in the world and even this
[1:06:07] global pandemic or there's some kind of
[1:06:09] trial, not the tribulation, but some
[1:06:11] kind of tribulation that's going to come
[1:06:13] and we're all as believers Even some of
[1:06:16] us being as part of economies or
[1:06:18] citizens of states or whatever it may
[1:06:20] be. If we suffer difficulty, the bride
[1:06:23] is either protected or perfected.
[1:06:26] Amen.
[1:06:28] You're either exempt from it or you're
[1:06:31] ordained to go through it
[1:06:33] in order for your protection.
[1:06:35] SO NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, I'M NOT AFRAID
[1:06:37] OF WHAT'S COMING.
[1:06:39] Fear is not going to do me any good. As
[1:06:41] a matter of fact, the scripture teaches
[1:06:42] us that the things we fear come upon us.
[1:06:45] And you go, "I told you there was going
[1:06:46] to be a persecution. I told you I was
[1:06:48] going to lose my house. I told you I was
[1:06:49] going to be robbed. I told you. I told
[1:06:50] you. You were so afraid of it. You just
[1:06:52] brought it to you." See, there was only
[1:06:54] one house in the entire valley that was
[1:06:55] looted on election night. And it WAS
[1:06:57] YOUR HOUSE. ONLY ONE HOUSE. [laughter]
[1:07:00] ONLY ONE PERSON HAD THEIR TIRES SLASHED.
[1:07:02] ONLY ONE PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE TOILET
[1:07:04] PAPER. ONLY ONE PERSON.
[1:07:06] I knew that was going to happen. I just
[1:07:07] knew it. I just knew it. That's just how
[1:07:09] much power you have. The things THAT JOB
[1:07:12] FEARED CAME UPON HIM. DON'T FEAR. PLEASE
[1:07:14] DON'T FEAR ANYTHING ABOUT ME.
[1:07:18] Don't fear. DON'T BE WORRISOME. DON'T BE
[1:07:19] UPSET.
[1:07:21] WHATEVER'S TO COME, GOD'S EITHER GOING
[1:07:23] TO ORDAIN US FOR IT, FOR OUR PERFECTION,
[1:07:25] OR HE'S GOING TO PROTECT US FROM IT.
[1:07:28] The Hebrew children were ordained to
[1:07:30] that fire, but he met them in it and
[1:07:31] protected them.
[1:07:32] DANIEL WAS ORDAINED FOR THE LION'S DEN,
[1:07:34] but he closed the LION'S MOUTH. THERE'S
[1:07:36] NO FIRE THAT WE'RE AFRAID TO WALK INTO.
[1:07:38] THERE'S NO DEN THAT WE'RE AFRAID OF
[1:07:40] BEING CAST INTO. THERE'S NO CIRCUMSTANCE
[1:07:42] THAT WE SHOULD BE AFRAID OF.
[1:07:44] In Acts chapter 11, it says that there
[1:07:47] was a prophecy by Agabus that signified
[1:07:49] by the spirit of the Lord that there
[1:07:51] would be a great darth. It'd be a great
[1:07:53] famine throughout all the world. And it
[1:07:54] says WHICH CAME TO PASS IN the days of
[1:07:56] Claudius Caesar. So here's a prophet
[1:07:58] that stands up to the church and HE SAYS
[1:08:00] THERE'S GOING TO BE A FAMINE ON THE
[1:08:02] LAND. THERE'S GOING TO BE A FAMINE THAT
[1:08:03] COMES INTO OUR REGION. AND IT SAYS, "And
[1:08:05] it came to pass."
[1:08:08] Now, was that prophecy meant to cause
[1:08:09] everyone to be afraid?
[1:08:11] Thus sayeth the Lord, there's going to
[1:08:13] be a famine that's going to afflict this
[1:08:14] region, going to afflict these people.
[1:08:16] Was it to cause everyone? Oh no. Oh no.
[1:08:19] Notice what happens. Then the disciples,
[1:08:21] every man according to his ability,
[1:08:23] determined to send relief unto the
[1:08:25] brethren which dwelt in Judea, which
[1:08:27] also they did, and sent it to the elders
[1:08:29] by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. SO
[1:08:31] ONE PROPHESIED OF A FAMINE AND another
[1:08:34] part of the body made provision in the
[1:08:36] midst of it.
[1:08:38] THERE'S NO PROPHECY OF CALAMITY,
[1:08:40] DESTRUCTION, DISEASE, FAMINE, TOLL,
[1:08:42] ECONOMIC CHAOS THAT SHOULD CAUSE US TO
[1:08:44] DESPAIR. BUT [screaming] GOD WILL USE
[1:08:46] THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO
[1:08:49] UPHOLD YOU, TO CLOTHE YOU, TO FEED YOU,
[1:08:52] TO PROVIDE FOR YOU, EVEN IF IT COMES
[1:08:54] FROM THE BODY. AND BARNABAS AND SAUL ARE
[1:08:56] OUT PASSING IT OUT.
[1:08:58] AMEN.
[1:08:59] It speaks to even a time when it came to
[1:09:02] pass a great dirt, a famine came in the
[1:09:04] land. GOD USED THE body to provide for
[1:09:07] the body.
[1:09:08] In Matthew chapter 24, we read it in our
[1:09:11] text. We'll just leave it up there for
[1:09:13] you to read
[1:09:15] these events that take place where he
[1:09:17] says that the flee from Judea to the
[1:09:19] mountains and if you're on the housetop,
[1:09:21] don't come down. Don't take it with you.
[1:09:22] Just flee. Don't return back to get your
[1:09:24] clothes. Woe to them that is with child.
[1:09:26] Jesus describes this terrible, terrible
[1:09:28] scene. This is fulfilled in 70 AD.
[1:09:32] It's a prophecy of Jesus that's
[1:09:34] fulfilled when Titus besieged Jerusalem.
[1:09:37] And it was such a a horrible siege that
[1:09:41] it caused a famine within Jerusalem.
[1:09:44] There was no way to have uh there was no
[1:09:46] provision coming in. They besieged it.
[1:09:48] They they surrounded it and there was no
[1:09:50] food coming in. So, it caused a famine.
[1:09:52] The people resorted to cannibalism.
[1:09:56] And I wonder how Uber Eats was thriving
[1:09:59] in those days.
[1:10:01] They're resorting they were resorting to
[1:10:03] the most awful horrific things. And
[1:10:05] there was tremendous bloodshed.
[1:10:09] Josephus the the writer Jewish historian
[1:10:13] claims that 1.1 million people were
[1:10:15] killed. 1,100,000 people were killed in
[1:10:18] the siege.
[1:10:20] That's a terrible time. That's just in
[1:10:22] Jerusalem. We're not talking about the
[1:10:25] world. We're talking about one place,
[1:10:27] but notice Jesus told him it was going
[1:10:29] to happen.
[1:10:31] Now, it may seem to be cryptic. Well,
[1:10:33] when you see this desolation spoken of
[1:10:35] by Daniel, when this prophecy is brought
[1:10:37] to pass, you who are that see these
[1:10:40] things coming, FLEE. GET OUT OF
[1:10:41] JERUSALEM. WHY? They Jesus knew there
[1:10:43] was going to be a siege. Here's a
[1:10:44] prophecy in symbolic form still in many
[1:10:46] ways, but yet it's instructed to the
[1:10:47] believer. Notice what brother Brandham
[1:10:49] says. According to the history, there
[1:10:51] wasn't one of them that believed in
[1:10:52] Jesus and believed the word, but was
[1:10:56] watching for that to happen. And they
[1:10:57] escaped and went from Jerusalem into
[1:10:59] Judea and fled for their lives. And not
[1:11:01] one of them, BECAUSE THEY WERE WARNED BY
[1:11:04] THEIR SHEPHERD, WAS WATCHING for that
[1:11:06] hour to come. WHEN THEY HEARD TITUS WAS
[1:11:08] COMING, THEY TOOK OFF, RUN for their
[1:11:10] lives, AND GOT OUT OF THE CITY.
[1:11:14] SO EVEN THOUGH JESUS PROPHESIED OF
[1:11:16] SOMETHING TERRIBLE ABOUT TO HAPPEN,
[1:11:18] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT ACCORDING TO
[1:11:20] HISTORY, NOT ONE BELIEVER WAS CAUGHT IN
[1:11:22] THE CITY BECAUSE THEY WERE WARNED BY THE
[1:11:25] WORD BEFOREHAND. THEY BELIEVED THE WORD
[1:11:28] AND THAT PROPHECY MOVED UPON THEM AND
[1:11:30] MOTIVATED THEM AND SENT THEM OUT OF THE
[1:11:32] CITY BEFORE THEY WOULD SUCCUMB TO THE
[1:11:34] THE SIEGE.
[1:11:35] AMEN.
[1:11:36] The word spoken beforehand was their
[1:11:39] protection.
[1:11:40] They didn't subscribe to a newsletter.
[1:11:42] They didn't have the best algorithm.
[1:11:44] THEY DIDN'T WATCH THIS NEWS STATION.
[1:11:45] They didn't get together and
[1:11:47] prognosticate about it. BUT THEY HAD A
[1:11:49] WORD BEFOREHAND THAT THE SPIRIT
[1:11:51] QUICKENED to them. THIS IS WHAT JESUS
[1:11:53] SAID. GET OUT, FLEE, RUN. AND NOT ONE OF
[1:11:56] THEM WAS TRAPPED INSIDE.
[1:11:57] AMEN.
[1:11:59] NOW, if we can look back in Acts 11 and
[1:12:02] Matthew chapter 24 and many other places
[1:12:04] in the Bible where God spoke of a
[1:12:06] calamity to come, but made provision to
[1:12:09] escape it. Even we could think of how
[1:12:12] Elijah a famine in the land. He was
[1:12:15] sustained
[1:12:18] by ravens for many days. And then what
[1:12:20] he says, I've commanded a widow woman to
[1:12:23] sustain you.
[1:12:25] God's word is always associated with
[1:12:27] provision and promise.
[1:12:31] So what has God spoken about today?
[1:12:36] Are you talk in the elephant in the
[1:12:37] room? I mean over the last several
[1:12:38] months there's been a lot of talk about
[1:12:40] germ warfare and plagues and I think a
[1:12:43] lot of that's kind of sorted itself out.
[1:12:45] A lot of people who said well if you get
[1:12:47] corona virus you don't have the Holy
[1:12:49] Ghost and then they test positive say
[1:12:51] you know I never really believe that
[1:12:52] anyways.
[1:12:53] So a lot of this stuff is just resolving
[1:12:55] itself on its own.
[1:12:57] But there's a lot of talk of
[1:12:58] persecution.
[1:13:00] There's a lot of talk talk talk of
[1:13:01] changing politics
[1:13:03] and and and we're we're so focused on oh
[1:13:05] no what's going to happen in America.
[1:13:07] America it's been prophesied of her
[1:13:11] and the things even Paul talks about it.
[1:13:13] The things that you don't worry about
[1:13:14] the things that are being accomplished
[1:13:15] are accomplished in your brethren and
[1:13:16] elsewhere. Just look around the world.
[1:13:18] The believer has suffered persecution in
[1:13:21] every decade.
[1:13:22] But it's the promise for the hour.
[1:13:25] That's what we're looking at.
[1:13:27] There's talk of diseases and economic
[1:13:29] distress. We see certain things taking
[1:13:31] place in the world and then we remember
[1:13:34] there's certain things that were said in
[1:13:35] the message and we start to wonder is
[1:13:37] this what brother man was talking about
[1:13:38] and what do we do? We take the rumor and
[1:13:42] we take the quote and we start trying to
[1:13:44] make it fit and what sometimes we create
[1:13:47] a monster
[1:13:49] and we just let that monster sit right
[1:13:51] there in our house. Oh my goodness
[1:13:53] gracious. Brother Man said this.
[1:13:56] CNN said this. Oh my goodness. Or worse,
[1:14:00] Alex Jones said this. Oh my goodness. OH
[1:14:04] MY GOODNESS. OH MY GOODNESS. OH MY
[1:14:07] GOODNESS. GET ALL YOUR CASH OUT OF THE
[1:14:08] [screaming] BANK. OH MY GOODNESS. Do you
[1:14:10] know what's going to happen? AND WE'RE A
[1:14:11] COMPLETE BASKET CASE.
[1:14:14] But you've created the monster.
[1:14:18] I want to challenge you. And I'm going
[1:14:19] to run out of time in in speaking on
[1:14:21] this. I'm certainly gonna run out of
[1:14:23] time this morning,
[1:14:26] but and maybe I'll pick this up on
[1:14:28] Wednesday night if we're all here.
[1:14:34] But what has God spoken for today?
[1:14:37] What has he said about today? And when
[1:14:40] we look at these things he said about
[1:14:41] today, are we taking the whole promise
[1:14:44] into consideration
[1:14:46] or have we already made it a monster by
[1:14:48] the way that we grabbed at it? Brother
[1:14:51] said this was going to happen and then
[1:14:53] he also said this was going to happen.
[1:14:54] But we only take this Lego piece
[1:14:57] and then we add it to this Lego piece
[1:14:59] and we're creating something that
[1:15:01] doesn't fit but yet IT LOOMS VERY LARGE
[1:15:03] IN OUR PSYCHE, VERY large in our lives
[1:15:05] and that way are we just presuming?
[1:15:09] Does your creation inspire fear or
[1:15:11] faith?
[1:15:12] IF IT HAS INSPIRED FEAR, TEAR IT DOWN,
[1:15:15] GET RID OF IT.
[1:15:16] GO HOME TODAY, TAKE THAT MONSTER AND
[1:15:18] JUST DESTROY IT. CAST OUT THAT IDOL. YOU
[1:15:21] KNOW, DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THOSE THINGS.
[1:15:22] DON'T FEED ON THOSE THINGS. DON'T LISTEN
[1:15:24] TO THOSE THINGS. THEY'RE ONLY INSPIRING
[1:15:26] FEAR AND DOUBT. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO
[1:15:28] CREATE A HYBRID BY TAKING THE MESSAGE
[1:15:29] AND JOINING IT TO IT. AND IT'S NOT DOING
[1:15:31] FOR YOU WHAT THIS MESSAGE OUGHT TO DO.
[1:15:33] TAKE IT UNFILTERED THE MESSAGE.
[1:15:36] DON'T FILTER IT THROUGH REDDIT. DON'T
[1:15:37] FILTER IT THROUGH TWITTER. DON'T FILTER
[1:15:39] THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. DON'T LET THEM BE
[1:15:41] YOUR FILTER.
[1:15:43] Take it straight from the word of God.
[1:15:50] Now, I'm going to skip a few places
[1:15:53] here.
[1:15:59] Just going to mention this real quick.
[1:16:00] We can always come back and do this
[1:16:02] another time. In Look Away to Jesus,
[1:16:05] this is the sermon where brother
[1:16:06] Brandham talks about the third pull.
[1:16:10] And let me say this,
[1:16:13] our focus shouldn't be on the push.
[1:16:16] It should be on the pull.
[1:16:19] The world's going to push you around.
[1:16:21] Going to be a lot of shoving, a lot of
[1:16:22] squeezing, a lot of tightening. That's
[1:16:25] that's been prophesied. Now, it's not
[1:16:27] always the way we think it's going to be
[1:16:29] because it's prophecy. But our focus
[1:16:31] isn't on the push. It's on the pull.
[1:16:36] What is the attraction? Not the
[1:16:37] distraction.
[1:16:39] As a believer, you are attracted to the
[1:16:41] word and distracted by the world.
[1:16:44] The non-elect are attracted to the
[1:16:46] world. Therefore, the word is a
[1:16:48] distraction. But you, it's in you. You
[1:16:51] are attracted to the word.
[1:16:54] Everything else is a distraction.
[1:16:56] And a look away to Jesus. Brother talks
[1:16:58] about how the third pull's been
[1:16:59] vindicated, but he talks about how a
[1:17:01] counseling is tightening up. The
[1:17:03] Pentecostals can impersonate anything.
[1:17:04] When that time comes, when the squeeze
[1:17:06] comes down, then you'll see what you've
[1:17:08] seen temporarily be manifested in the
[1:17:10] fullness of its power.
[1:17:12] And this is where brother Brandham talks
[1:17:16] about this time coming and the the
[1:17:19] pressure that's coming. But in this he's
[1:17:22] saying the third pull's properly
[1:17:24] identified. The third pull is here. This
[1:17:27] is the thing that I believe will start
[1:17:28] rapturing faith for the going away. Then
[1:17:31] he says referring to Revelations 13,
[1:17:33] it's a coming time where this nation is
[1:17:34] going to exercise all the power that the
[1:17:36] beast had. And he calls it papal Rome.
[1:17:39] Talks about how the lamb represented
[1:17:40] religion. the Roman denomination, a
[1:17:42] marked Protestant denomination, an image
[1:17:44] under the beast, making a power that'll
[1:17:46] force all Protestants like a union. Who?
[1:17:49] Protestants,
[1:17:51] the force that works upon THE NON-ELECT,
[1:17:55] NATIONAL FORCE.
[1:17:58] He says, well, it's practically that way
[1:18:00] now. You can't go to church and preach
[1:18:02] preach unless you have a fellowship card
[1:18:03] or some identification on persons like
[1:18:05] ourselves. We're going to be cut out of
[1:18:07] all of that alto together.
[1:18:09] That's exactly because they won't be
[1:18:11] able to do it. That's exact That's
[1:18:13] exactly because they won't be able to do
[1:18:14] it. What? Force you into it.
[1:18:17] It's tightening. And when that time
[1:18:19] comes and the press comes to a place
[1:18:21] where YOU'RE PRESSED OUT, THEN WATCH
[1:18:23] WHAT I'm fixing to tell you in A FEW
[1:18:25] MINUTES. WATCH THE third pull. It'll be
[1:18:28] absolutely to the total loss, but it'll
[1:18:30] be for the bride and the church.
[1:18:33] Now,
[1:18:35] I this is my opinion. Most often we
[1:18:38] focus on the tightening, the squeeze,
[1:18:40] and even the squeeze. We call it the
[1:18:42] squeeze when I think he only referred to
[1:18:43] it one time as the squeeze, but he calls
[1:18:46] it the tightening, the press, the
[1:18:49] squeeze coming, all these pressures
[1:18:51] coming in. They're trying to force you,
[1:18:53] but they won't be able to for do it, BUT
[1:18:54] IT'S TIGHTEN. AND WHEN THAT TIME COMES,
[1:18:56] HE GOES, I I I want you to watch WHAT
[1:18:58] I'M FIXING TO TELL YOU IN A FEW MINUTES.
[1:18:59] Because he says this right at the
[1:19:01] beginning of THE SERMON HE'S PREACHING.
[1:19:02] WATCH THE THIRD PULL. Then
[1:19:06] now if I could say it THIS WAY, HE'S NOT
[1:19:09] SAYING WATCH THE THIRD PULL. WELL, look
[1:19:12] at IT THIS WAY. NOT WATCH THE THIRD pull
[1:19:15] then,
[1:19:17] but watch the third pull then.
[1:19:20] Why watch everything else?
[1:19:22] WHY GET CAUGHT UP and concerned with
[1:19:24] everything that's going on? They're
[1:19:25] going to tighten. THEY'RE GOING TO JOIN
[1:19:26] their organizations. They're going to do
[1:19:28] they're going to succumb TO NATIONAL
[1:19:30] FORCE. WHY should we be looking at
[1:19:32] everything else that's HAPPENED IN THE
[1:19:33] WORLD? HE SAYS, "THEN WATCH THE THIRD
[1:19:34] PULL."
[1:19:36] RIGHT?
[1:19:36] WATCH THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:19:39] But let me say this TO THE POINT THAT
[1:19:41] WE'VE MADE ALL ALONG. HE DIDN'T PROPHESY
[1:19:44] A TIGHTENING. HE DIDN'T PROPHESY A
[1:19:46] SQUEEZE. He didn't prophesy a
[1:19:48] persecution to cause despair.
[1:19:50] No.
[1:19:51] That we would be fearful of a squeeze.
[1:19:53] We'd be fearful of a tightening. That
[1:19:54] we'd be fearful of some kind OF
[1:19:55] PERSECUTION. BUT THE PROPHECY IS
[1:19:57] POINTING TO THE PROMISE of protection.
[1:20:00] Amen. because he connects the
[1:20:02] tightening, the persecution, the squeeze
[1:20:04] to THE SPIRIT OF PAPLE ROME.
[1:20:07] And he says this is a SPIRIT THAT WHAT?
[1:20:09] CRUCIFIES THE WORD.
[1:20:12] So it it's ALL UNDERCOVER TO CAUSE
[1:20:15] SPIRITUAL PERSECUTION, NOT STRIP away
[1:20:17] your rights,
[1:20:19] right? Because this is le oysia.
[1:20:22] You you're going to have your right to
[1:20:23] do whatever you want, marry whatever you
[1:20:26] want, live however you want. IT'S
[1:20:29] DEMOCRACY WITHOUT AN ANCHOR. It's just
[1:20:30] going to end up in all sorts of nonsense
[1:20:32] and fanaticism. BUT WHAT'S THE DRIVE OF
[1:20:34] THE ECUMENICAL MOVEMENT? WHAT'S THE
[1:20:36] DRIVE OF PAPAL ROME? BROTHER CALLS IT
[1:20:38] PAGAN ROME. WHAT'S THE DRIVE OF IT? TO
[1:20:40] SNUFF OUT THE REVEALED WORD.
[1:20:42] So he's saying when THE SQUEEZE COMES,
[1:20:44] THE TIGHTENING COMES, THE PERSECUTION
[1:20:45] COMES. IT'S NOT ON ALL CHRISTIANS AND
[1:20:47] THOSE NAMING WHO JESUS CHRIST IS. IT'S A
[1:20:50] DIRECT AFFRONT against the manifestation
[1:20:52] OF THE TRUTH IN HER ALONE.
[1:20:56] So it's A SPIRITUAL WARFARE AGAINST THE
[1:20:58] TRUTH.
[1:21:06] I'm I'm just going to stop. Uh I'm going
[1:21:08] to leave that. We'll get back to it.
[1:21:17] But Brandham says what he's preaching.
[1:21:23] He says, "Watch.
[1:21:26] It's all coming. the press, the squeeze,
[1:21:28] the tightening.
[1:21:30] Then watch what I'm fixing to tell you
[1:21:32] in the next few minutes. Look away to
[1:21:35] Jesus.
[1:21:38] Look away from the tightening to Jesus.
[1:21:42] Look away from persecution to Jesus.
[1:21:45] Look away from the squeeze to Jesus.
[1:21:48] We could spend the rest of our lives
[1:21:50] around a table full of good Mexican food
[1:21:52] talking about the squeeze, the
[1:21:55] persecution, the pressure,
[1:21:58] the the the destruction of America,
[1:22:00] morals, economies.
[1:22:02] But what good would that do?
[1:22:06] We've received We've seen the sign of
[1:22:07] Sodom.
[1:22:09] We've seen the sign of the days of Noah.
[1:22:13] I want to look at the Son of Man.
[1:22:14] Amen.
[1:22:15] Look away from all that to Jesus.
[1:22:20] He says, "And there is a man here who
[1:22:21] can turn on the light." It was that
[1:22:23] morning,
[1:22:24] same morning that he preached, "Look
[1:22:25] away to Jesus."
[1:22:29] He says, "When the persecution comes,
[1:22:32] don't get scared."
[1:22:34] There is a light said he would catch his
[1:22:36] people away.
[1:22:40] So, I'm not I'm not saying what it may
[1:22:42] look like,
[1:22:44] but he's saying whatever it may be,
[1:22:46] don't be afraid of it.
[1:22:51] There's disease, there's pestilence,
[1:22:53] there's suffering
[1:22:55] in the world today.
[1:22:58] Amen.
[1:23:00] There there all of us in some way have
[1:23:03] been all of us have been impacted
[1:23:07] by co 19.
[1:23:10] There's not one person who hasn't been.
[1:23:13] You never know what the next thing might
[1:23:15] be.
[1:23:17] There's regulations that can be put into
[1:23:19] place that severely restrict certain
[1:23:21] industries.
[1:23:23] There's
[1:23:25] there's failures of economies. There's
[1:23:26] fraud that could exist on a government
[1:23:28] level where you're going to find out
[1:23:29] that an entire country is absolutely
[1:23:32] bankrupt. It's been propped up by lies.
[1:23:34] There's nothing to it. An entire
[1:23:35] countries could collapse overnight.
[1:23:37] Economies could fail. It could start a
[1:23:39] domino effect that who knows what it's
[1:23:40] going to be.
[1:23:43] But we're not afraid of it. I don't even
[1:23:46] need to try to dig through quotes and
[1:23:47] say, "Well, Brother Brandham said here
[1:23:49] that this was going to happen and that
[1:23:50] this was going to happen and try to
[1:23:52] build a case that we better all get
[1:23:53] ready and stock up on canned beans or
[1:23:55] whatever to prepare for what's coming
[1:23:57] next." My message is to you, don't fear
[1:24:00] what's coming.
[1:24:02] There are going to be difficulties
[1:24:04] ahead. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
[1:24:05] DIFFICULTIES AHEAD. How many have been
[1:24:07] in this message more than 30 years?
[1:24:09] Raise your hand. How many have heard it
[1:24:11] preached for over 30 years? THERE'S
[1:24:12] TOUGH TIMES COMING. THERE'S DARK DAYS
[1:24:14] AHEAD. THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT
[1:24:16] TIME. THINGS ARE GOING TO BE
[1:24:17] TROUBLESOME. AND WHAT HAPPENED? IT
[1:24:19] HAPPENED.
[1:24:20] BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY. BUT OUR
[1:24:23] FOCUS IS NOT ON THE DARKNESS. IT'S ON
[1:24:25] THE LIGHT. THE FOCUS ISN'T ON MAN AND
[1:24:27] WHAT HE CAN DO UNTO ME. BUT IT'S ON THE
[1:24:29] MAN WHO'S HERE WHO CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT
[1:24:31] AND RAPTURE THAT CHURCH.
[1:24:35] Brother Brandham says in the message
[1:24:36] third Exodus,
[1:24:46] he says, "Faith finds the word, its
[1:24:49] sanctuary of rest.
[1:24:51] It moves right up on the top of that
[1:24:53] eternal rock, Christ Jesus, the word,
[1:24:55] and lays down there in rest.
[1:24:58] Let the winds howl. Let the storm shake.
[1:25:01] She is safe ever more.
[1:25:03] She rest right there on that word.
[1:25:07] That's where faith, genuine Christian
[1:25:09] faith, rest. Resting place is the word.
[1:25:13] For it knows that God will ever prove
[1:25:14] himself superior over every one of his
[1:25:17] enemies. NO MATTER HOW BAD IT LOOKS and
[1:25:21] how the enemy has come in and how it
[1:25:24] looks like you are defeated, faith still
[1:25:27] knows.
[1:25:29] Let the winds howl. Let the storms
[1:25:31] shake. She is safe ever more.
[1:25:36] Do you believe that?
[1:25:38] No matter WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS, THE
[1:25:40] BRIDE IS SECURE.
[1:25:42] HE SAID THE STABILIZERS HAVE BEEN PUT ON
[1:25:44] THE SHIP.
[1:25:46] SHE'LL CREST every wave.
[1:25:49] THERE'S nothing that we should be
[1:25:50] fearful of.
[1:25:53] AND I I LEFT OUT A LOT IN THIS. AND
[1:25:55] MAYBE if the Lord would lead us to do
[1:25:56] it, maybe we might just pick up on it on
[1:25:58] Wednesday night. But as I pondered all
[1:26:01] these THINGS AND I THOUGHT ABOUT these
[1:26:03] scriptures and these statements and all
[1:26:04] these prophecies that set before us and
[1:26:06] even our tendencies sometimes to join
[1:26:10] the things that brother Brandham said
[1:26:11] about persecution and oncoming trouble
[1:26:14] and calamity and say, "Oh, this is it.
[1:26:16] This is what he talked about." Because
[1:26:18] we're trying to create some climactic
[1:26:20] event that brings everything to a head.
[1:26:24] And I go back to the beginning.
[1:26:26] Uncertain things are not certain.
[1:26:28] Creating a hybrid of uncertainty with
[1:26:31] the word wherein it's your own creation
[1:26:33] will only inspire doubt.
[1:26:36] But if there's a promise of persecution
[1:26:38] or a prophecy of destruction or whatever
[1:26:40] it might be, don't miss out on the
[1:26:43] promise.
[1:26:44] And everywhere I look in the message of
[1:26:47] the hour, where I find there's
[1:26:48] persecution, there's a promise. Where I
[1:26:50] find there's destruction, there's a way
[1:26:52] of escape. There's no place IN THE
[1:26:54] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, EVEN IF YOU WANT TO
[1:26:56] FABRICATE THIS IS WHAT IT IS OR
[1:26:57] SPECULATE THIS IS WHAT IT IS. THERE'S
[1:26:59] NOWHERE WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM IS SAYING
[1:27:01] YOU BETTER GET READY BECAUSE YOU'RE
[1:27:03] GOING TO DIE. YOU BETTER GET READY
[1:27:05] BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE FORSAKEN. YOU
[1:27:06] BETTER GET READY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:27:07] BE NAKED AND HUNTED DOWN AND CAST ASIDE
[1:27:10] AND PERSECUTED AND DIE.
[1:27:13] Because let me say this, the prevailing
[1:27:15] promise for this age is not the grave,
[1:27:18] but the promise for this hour is life
[1:27:20] and provision. GOD HAS NOT PROPHESIED
[1:27:22] that a bride will face death and be
[1:27:24] willing to give into it and have to give
[1:27:26] her life. He's prophesied that the bride
[1:27:28] as a collective if she faces
[1:27:30] persecution, if she faces disease, if
[1:27:32] she faces UH DESTRUCTION AND CHURCH
[1:27:34] DOORS CLOSE, WHATEVER PRESSURES
[1:27:36] POLITICAL, SOCIAL COME TO BEAR ON THE
[1:27:38] BODY OF CHRIST AS A WHOLE, IT CANNOT
[1:27:41] PRODUCE DEATH. WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF
[1:27:44] DEATH. WHY? BECAUSE THE PROMISE OF THIS
[1:27:46] AGE, THIS TIME IS LIFE AND PROVISION.
[1:27:48] AMEN.
[1:27:50] There's nothing you should be afraid of.
[1:27:53] Absolutely nothing.
[1:27:56] I see God gathering people together,
[1:27:58] even in local churches, for strength and
[1:28:01] hours like this.
[1:28:02] Could you imagine being on your own
[1:28:05] without fellowship,
[1:28:08] left to all your Frankensteines you've
[1:28:10] created in the message
[1:28:11] in your house on election night,
[1:28:15] but you'll have a body who's committed
[1:28:16] to be praying for one another. Amen.
[1:28:19] I'm not praying about an outcome out
[1:28:21] there. I'm praying about an income in
[1:28:23] here.
[1:28:23] Amen.
[1:28:24] That your faith will raise to a level to
[1:28:26] believe that all things are possible.
[1:28:28] That you're confident in him who made
[1:28:30] the promise.
[1:28:31] Because what one of the titles I thought
[1:28:33] about naming this was you got this.
[1:28:37] I don't know what the the future holds.
[1:28:39] I don't have an answer to all the
[1:28:40] questions. Say, well, brother Aaron,
[1:28:41] brother Bam said this. What does it
[1:28:42] mean? I I don't have the answers to all
[1:28:44] the questions. And any man that says he
[1:28:47] does, I'd be lerary of all his answers.
[1:28:52] But I know who holds the future.
[1:28:54] I know who's holding us.
[1:28:56] I know who's directing your steps. And I
[1:28:59] believe you got this.
[1:29:01] No matter what the future holds, you've
[1:29:03] got this. Brother Brandham says, "An
[1:29:05] anointed ones at the end time." He says,
[1:29:08] "An eagle is a special built bird.
[1:29:12] There's nothing like him on the earth.
[1:29:16] If a buzzard tried to follow him or any
[1:29:18] other bird, he'd disintegrate.
[1:29:20] His follys would be made manifest. Sure
[1:29:22] enough, he says he'd blow up. He'd
[1:29:25] disintegrate. And I skipped a little bit
[1:29:26] there. His body isn't put together with
[1:29:28] the structure to hold him up there. When
[1:29:31] he gets in them great spheres up yonder,
[1:29:34] he isn't made, ordained, predestinated,
[1:29:36] born an eagle, he will bust to pieces.
[1:29:40] The feathers would fly out of his wings
[1:29:41] and he'd fall to the earth. Sure.
[1:29:45] He can't follow the eagle in height. If
[1:29:48] he tries to, his folly will be made
[1:29:51] manifest.
[1:29:54] Let me put it to you this way.
[1:29:57] Whatever's coming, you're made for it.
[1:30:01] You're built for it. You're built for
[1:30:03] the pressure. You're built for the
[1:30:05] circumstances. You're built for the
[1:30:06] uniqueness of the time. Whatever it may
[1:30:08] be, you're built for it. So, there's
[1:30:10] nothing you have to be afraid of. He
[1:30:13] says the eagle is a special built bird.
[1:30:17] Others will go through the very same
[1:30:19] thing that the eagle's going through and
[1:30:21] they disintegrate. HE SAYS WHAT? THEIR
[1:30:23] FOLLY IS made manifest. But there is no
[1:30:25] folly to be made manifest.
[1:30:28] The only thing that'll prove in the end
[1:30:30] is that you believe
[1:30:32] that you stand sure that you're certain
[1:30:35] about him. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:30:39] You're made for this.
[1:30:41] the Lord would lead and you could just
[1:30:43] pray if God would direct us that way we
[1:30:44] can just pick up a lot of these things
[1:30:46] that we left off.
[1:30:48] But you're made for this.
[1:30:52] What key did you play? Uh magnify the
[1:30:54] Lord with me in
[1:30:57] Psalms 31. It was indeed we just could
[1:30:59] sing that again
[1:31:02] with our heads bowed and
[1:31:06] would you want to cast your cares on
[1:31:07] him?
[1:31:08] Just cast your cares on him.
[1:31:11] I certainly don't mean to make light of
[1:31:13] any [music] situation you may be going
[1:31:15] through
[1:31:18] to suggest at all that there's
[1:31:21] not those that know certain things are
[1:31:23] coming personally.
[1:31:29] But what I would want to encourage you
[1:31:32] in is confidence that he's made you for
[1:31:36] such a time as this.
[1:31:37] Amen.
[1:31:38] Let's have [music] just bow our heads
[1:31:40] and pray. Our gracious heavenly father,
[1:31:43] Lord, I thank you for the attentiveness
[1:31:45] of the people, the sincerity with
[1:31:47] [music] which they pull on the word.
[1:31:51] And Lord, how that within their hearts
[1:31:55] they long, Lord,
[1:31:57] for more of you.
[1:32:00] And Lord, I can sense it as the word is
[1:32:03] going forth, their sincerity and their
[1:32:06] hunger pains, Lord,
[1:32:09] for more of you. And I pray, Father,
[1:32:11] that as you have shared
[1:32:14] your heart with us today [music] to
[1:32:16] remind us that in difficult times and
[1:32:18] times of trouble and great calamity,
[1:32:21] that the bride has nothing to fear.
[1:32:24] that the prophecies that lay within the
[1:32:26] word of God that speak of a squeeze, a
[1:32:28] tightening, a persecution is never meant
[1:32:30] to cause fear,
[1:32:33] but that we would know if it happens in
[1:32:37] the way that we're expecting it to. If
[1:32:39] it happens in a way that would cause us
[1:32:41] to be separated, if it happened in a way
[1:32:43] that would cause loss, then we remember
[1:32:46] that you spoke it beforehand that we
[1:32:48] would realize that these things are for
[1:32:51] our perfection.
[1:32:54] In other words, Lord, there's just no
[1:32:55] basis upon which we need to despair of
[1:32:57] life, that we need to despair of trouble
[1:33:00] or hardship, but just trust in you.
[1:33:04] And Father, we cast all our cares on you
[1:33:07] today.
[1:33:08] And I pray that you'd settle the
[1:33:09] people's nerves, Lord, and just relieve
[1:33:11] them of their stress.
[1:33:13] Sanctify our minds and hearts, Lord. If
[1:33:15] we've created any monsters, we pray that
[1:33:18] you'd break them and destroy them.
[1:33:20] Lord, if there be any
[1:33:24] any hybrid ideas where we've taken the
[1:33:26] message and joined it with rumor and
[1:33:27] speculation and conspiracy theory and
[1:33:30] what the news is telling us, Lord, may
[1:33:33] we divide those things again.
[1:33:36] And may we only see modern events that
[1:33:38] are made clear by [music] prophecy.
[1:33:41] We commit ourselves to you today,
[1:33:42] praying your blessing upon the people as
[1:33:44] we worship, as we're soon [music]
[1:33:45] dismissed. strengthen us we pray by your
[1:33:48] word in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:50] Christ we pray. Amen.
