[0:00] I'm excited about the subject matter
[0:02] we're continuing on these verses here
[0:04] how it describes him upon his head were
[0:06] many crowns and he had a name written
[0:09] that no man knew but he himself I just
[0:11] felt the song service had such
[0:12] continuity with the subject matter and I
[0:15] love just how well you all worship uh
[0:17] you don't require every chair to be full
[0:19] to fill up this uh this house and praise
[0:23] and worship and are just really
[0:24] compliments to all you and how well you
[0:26] worship
[0:26] makes this statement as we're continuing
[0:29] on the seven women in one bride he makes
[0:31] the statement from the future home of
[0:32] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[0:34] bride he said there is one bride so
[0:37] there can be I have my title seven women
[0:39] one bride we could say seven billion
[0:41] women one bride so it doesn't matter the
[0:43] number there's one bride not a dozen
[0:46] denominations but one bride that's the
[0:49] elected
[0:50] out of the earth and so that's a that's
[0:52] a designation that we should be thinking
[0:54] of as we're looking at the glory of the
[0:56] Earth or the Earth's Glory there's a
[0:58] woman that's elected out of this Earth
[1:01] that's been predestinated to this and
[1:03] there's a lot that is assumed in that
[1:05] statement to this and then he says the
[1:07] ones who can recognize their place in
[1:10] the Kingdom
[1:11] that ought to be our ambition as
[1:13] Believers is to recognize our place in
[1:17] the Kingdom even if we looked at it from
[1:19] the standpoint that you're already
[1:20] positionally placed there and it's
[1:22] already there and it's already full it's
[1:24] already bought it's already possessed uh
[1:26] and it's yours then if there be anything
[1:28] lacking it's our full Revelation and
[1:31] recognition of what it means to be in
[1:33] that position and so however you want to
[1:35] describe it this bride recognizing who
[1:38] she is recognizing her place in the
[1:40] Kingdom or as he says elected and
[1:43] predestinated it's something that she's
[1:45] ordained to this is the real thrust of
[1:48] where we are as Believers in this life
[1:50] is God show me who I am in your word and
[1:53] recognizing our place individually
[1:56] recognizing our place in the kingdom and
[2:00] so one of the principles that we're just
[2:01] continuing to explore in this series on
[2:04] the kingdom is the bride recognizing her
[2:06] place in the Kingdom maybe even more
[2:08] importantly you recognizing your place
[2:10] in the Kingdom that's the purpose of the
[2:13] entire series as I've studied this is
[2:15] for you individually to embrace your
[2:17] position in the body of Christ brace
[2:20] your calling and who you are in Christ
[2:21] right now
[2:23] not in the future as I kind of hinted at
[2:25] I want to preach a sermon called the
[2:27] future is here lest we put anything too
[2:29] far off that we can be in possession of
[2:31] right now
[2:33] let's just read Revelations 19 verses 11
[2:35] and 12 again it says and I saw heaven
[2:37] opened and behold a white horse
[2:40] and he that said upon him was called
[2:41] faithful and true and in righteousness
[2:44] he deaf judge and make war so we're
[2:46] continuing on what we're ministering on
[2:48] Sunday I'm just going to pick right up
[2:49] in some of these images of the crown and
[2:51] the name his eyes were as a flame of
[2:54] fire
[2:54] and on his head were many crowns and he
[2:58] had a name written that no man knew but
[3:00] he himself as we think about these
[3:02] images this is Christ riding on a white
[3:04] horse we know there's a false image of
[3:06] Satan riding on the White Horse He says
[3:08] many crowns are on his head many crowns
[3:11] one head one name
[3:13] and these are descriptive of Christ
[3:15] now as we see Christ it's it's wonderful
[3:19] to see him
[3:20] but we do not Behold Him as one who
[3:23] would be in Terror or fear of His Image
[3:27] because when we see him we see that we
[3:30] are a part of something that we should
[3:32] see ourselves as being a part of
[3:33] whatever it is we see so we ought not to
[3:35] be afraid and scared when we read about
[3:37] Christ if we see him as a judge we
[3:39] shouldn't be afraid I think the world
[3:41] loves to embrace Christ as the lamb but
[3:44] would just as soon ignore the fact that
[3:46] he's a lion
[3:48] and ignore the fact that they're going
[3:49] to judge the World by Jesus Christ who
[3:51] is the word so when we see this it's not
[3:53] just so much seeing Christ but we want
[3:55] to see the bride represented in this and
[3:58] the sermon proven his word brother Brown
[4:00] said it's also written in Revelation the
[4:01] 19th Chapter when we see him coming the
[4:05] bride and groom important to know that
[4:07] this coming is uh not uh to take his
[4:10] bride this is this coming with his bride
[4:12] it's this third coming or when he comes
[4:15] with his bride that he sets foot on
[4:17] Earth and a physical body brother bam
[4:19] said that's the coming most people are
[4:21] looking for is this literal coming of
[4:24] the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in his
[4:26] third coming for the Millennium and
[4:28] therefore because their expectation they
[4:31] don't fully recognize Christ revealing
[4:33] himself in this day so he says the bride
[4:35] and groom his vesture dipped in blood
[4:38] his name was called the word of God he
[4:41] is the word of God and that's he is the
[4:44] quickening power
[4:46] and I love this this is such at the core
[4:49] he is the holy spirit is the Dynamics
[4:51] that comes into the mechanics the words
[4:53] that make it live
[4:54] that's what we want the word to do we
[4:56] want it to live not just paying lip
[4:57] service to it not just kind of having
[4:59] our ears itched by it but we want the
[5:01] Dynamics to the mechanics to make it
[5:03] live to live we want it to count on
[5:06] Thursday morning not just Wednesday
[5:07] night we want to count on Mondays and
[5:09] not just Sundays and that's what we want
[5:11] we want the Holy Spirit to make the word
[5:12] of God live and if I could just back up
[5:15] a step when brother Brown looks at
[5:17] Revelations 19 and describes Christ as
[5:19] Vester dipped in blood his name is
[5:20] called the word of God he describes it
[5:22] not just as groom but bride and groom so
[5:26] when we look at these characteristics of
[5:27] Christ you're learning something about
[5:29] your mate you're learning something
[5:30] about your husband and this is a key
[5:32] that we'll pick up on Sunday as you
[5:34] learn about your husband you're learning
[5:36] something about yourself
[5:39] now I want to take this phrase and on
[5:41] his head were many crowns and then take
[5:43] this the name that is written but let's
[5:45] look at this on his head were many
[5:46] crowns we covered a lot of this already
[5:48] on Sunday
[5:49] but Urbana makes the statement in the
[5:51] second seal when he's described this way
[5:53] he's been crowned by his Saints
[5:57] and we put a lot out there on Sunday and
[5:59] I didn't really amplify and embellish
[6:00] and try to connect all the parts
[6:02] together I believe there's something
[6:03] very precious about the Lord revealing
[6:05] things to you and quickening things to
[6:07] you and sometimes I you have to resist
[6:09] the urge as a minister to try to explain
[6:11] it all and connect all the dots because
[6:13] when God quickens something to you
[6:15] that's that's the desire that's the real
[6:17] gold
[6:18] and it we were pointing out how there is
[6:21] in this image the bride crowning Christ
[6:24] that her life and her glory and her uh
[6:28] even her own testimony and even in the
[6:31] the symbolism of her Casting Crowns to
[6:33] him or those that are Redeemed by his
[6:36] power casting the crown and saying you
[6:37] get the glory you deserve the praise now
[6:40] the Bible even says exalt wisdom and
[6:42] lift her up and then what she'll do is
[6:44] she'll Crown you she'll give you a
[6:46] diadem and so God has been building up
[6:48] his bride and exalting her and
[6:49] encouraging her he doesn't beat her down
[6:51] doesn't bully her doesn't beat her up
[6:53] he's been encouraging her and exalting
[6:54] her and those words of judgment and
[6:57] harshness that's for the false Church
[6:59] but the words that build up and
[7:01] encourage and correct that's to his
[7:02] bride and as he's exalted her she's a
[7:05] crown to him and she crowns him and this
[7:08] is in the crowning of Christ
[7:10] he is the mighty conqueror he is
[7:14] Victorious he's the one that has
[7:15] overcome and in his crowned Victoria so
[7:18] the the crowning and these crowns upon
[7:21] his head are symbolic of victory
[7:23] now the word that's used in The Book of
[7:25] Revelation here is diadema and that's a
[7:28] diadem as you would even read it that
[7:30] way in the Old Testament it's a kingly
[7:32] ornament on one's head
[7:34] and it's you ought to just be thinking
[7:36] of that thing that would Crown a king in
[7:38] whatever way it would be fashioned
[7:40] whether it be gold and uh with rubies
[7:42] and different uh Jewels it's something
[7:44] that's put upon uh the head of a king
[7:47] and you could take other words in
[7:49] Scripture that referred to a crown and
[7:50] find that this Crown is used as a badge
[7:53] of victory for someone who's Victorious
[7:55] so it has Royal implications it has
[7:58] Victor and conqueror implications
[8:01] and when we think of a crown and as we
[8:03] read it here that he has one head and
[8:06] many crowns are on his head and he's
[8:08] coming with this in this kind of state
[8:10] to make war and he's going to judge and
[8:12] his vesters dipped in Blood and we we
[8:14] see him coming as a righteous judge this
[8:17] Crown is symbolic and in general it's
[8:19] symbolic of one's rule
[8:22] we could even use the term to say the
[8:23] crown to refer to the one in power or
[8:26] the The Entity that governs or it kind
[8:28] of represents it's even a phrase that's
[8:30] used to represent those that rule and so
[8:32] this Crown represents dignity and honor
[8:35] and power and
[8:37] oh I would even go so far as to say the
[8:40] crown is representative of the entire
[8:42] ruler government
[8:44] does that make sense when I say we refer
[8:45] to the crown and we say well the crown
[8:47] has come out with a statement if you
[8:48] have to think about King Charles or is
[8:51] that who it is is it King Chuck
[8:52] I it was easier when it was uh the queen
[8:55] that now that you have a king and you
[8:58] say well the crown and has issued an
[9:00] official position or the crown this or
[9:02] the crown that and and it's not this uh
[9:05] you know this this crown on a on a
[9:07] pillow that can talk uh it is it refers
[9:10] to the rule the authority the the the
[9:12] governing entity
[9:14] now a few scriptures just should get a
[9:17] bigger picture of the crown and this is
[9:18] helpful because I want to get into some
[9:20] of the aspects of the Kingdom as far as
[9:22] the king those ruling and reigning and
[9:24] in Ezekiel 16 12
[9:26] talking about uh I would say Israel in
[9:30] general he says and I put a jewel on
[9:33] there thy forehead and earrings in thine
[9:35] ears and he's just talking about and
[9:37] even that phrase there is a little bit
[9:38] misunderstood uh and he's describing of
[9:42] what I've done for you and he says and a
[9:44] beautiful crown upon thy head
[9:47] and as you read in Ezekiel 16 and you
[9:49] would read around it you'd see that this
[9:51] is referring to when one has been raised
[9:54] up to a particular position
[9:56] that once they assume this new position
[9:59] conferring a crown honors them in this
[10:02] new office that when one has achieved
[10:06] that office and as the reason is it
[10:08] Charles is it King Charles is it Prince
[10:09] Charles and now he's the king sometimes
[10:10] you guys just look at me like I know
[10:12] there's a joke in there and he's trying
[10:13] to trick us but when he became when
[10:16] Prince to King that he was coronated now
[10:20] that he's come into this office and in
[10:21] this position uh he receives the crown
[10:24] and so when he says I I put a beautiful
[10:26] crown upon thy head this is the the
[10:28] honoring of one in a new position or a
[10:31] new relationship
[10:33] and so a crown is used and it's worn as
[10:36] the mark of an office
[10:38] the fact that there would be a crown
[10:39] placed upon this woman's head and I put
[10:42] a jewel upon you in earrings and thine
[10:43] ears and a beautiful crown upon the head
[10:45] it says I've raised you up to this
[10:46] position I've made you glorious I've
[10:48] made you powerful I've made you
[10:49] beautiful and the crown is emblematic of
[10:52] their their uh their office and their
[10:55] position
[10:57] and as it's expressed
[10:58] even in here it's a it's an emblem of
[11:02] one that we even use the phrase bride
[11:04] and I'm using it more in just a general
[11:05] sense it's the emblem of a bride who's
[11:07] been made the queen
[11:08] as the wife of the king that there's a
[11:11] there's something that's being conferred
[11:12] something being placed upon her
[11:15] and then in Song of Solomon and reading
[11:17] it there in Ezekiel 16 shows that even
[11:19] the woman is crowned and then in Song of
[11:22] Solomon verses 3 and 11 and I know I'm
[11:24] taking this somewhat out of context and
[11:26] not exploring what's around it he says
[11:28] go forth oh ye Daughters of Zion and
[11:30] behold King Solomon
[11:32] with the crown
[11:34] so now we're seeing the king and he's
[11:36] crowned and recognize what this Crown
[11:38] signifies wherewith his mother crowned
[11:41] him in the Day of His espousals and that
[11:44] word of spousal there's marriage
[11:46] the United this isn't an engagement or
[11:48] the promise to Mary
[11:50] but there is a crown that has been
[11:52] placed on him at the time of his wedding
[11:54] at the time of the marriage
[11:57] and in the day of the gladness of his
[11:59] heart so that's a day of rejoicing this
[12:02] is the crown of rejoice and this is the
[12:03] day of great Jubilation and an
[12:05] expression and exaltation this would be
[12:08] a joyful day something to look forward
[12:09] to and he has crowned the king is
[12:12] crowned on the day of his wedding the
[12:14] day of the gladness of his heart
[12:16] so not only is the crown associated with
[12:19] arriving at a new position in terms of
[12:21] government and power but now it's
[12:23] associated with the honor ascribed by
[12:25] marriage that here the king received a
[12:28] crown at the time of his espousal uh
[12:30] we're looking at a day of marriage a day
[12:33] of uniting a day of gladness and a crown
[12:36] is associated with that
[12:37] I know this is very simple so you just
[12:40] feel really good tonight as you're
[12:41] pulling that's what is when we see
[12:44] Christ and on his head were many crowns
[12:46] these crowns signify something
[12:49] and as we're pointing out on Sunday
[12:51] let's look at verse Proverbs 12 verse 4.
[12:55] as this Crown is used to identify a
[12:58] position or is worn as one who is in a
[13:01] particular office
[13:02] the the wife of the king the consort of
[13:05] a king wears the crown to signify her
[13:07] relationship in her position with the
[13:09] crown
[13:10] and the King wearing a crown on the day
[13:12] of his uniting in his wedding these are
[13:14] the images of a crown that I want you to
[13:15] think about when we see Christ riding on
[13:17] this white horse
[13:19] and then in Proverbs 12 4
[13:21] it says a virtuous woman is a crown to
[13:23] her husband and I want to take this
[13:25] verse and make it much more practical as
[13:27] we go forward a virtuous woman is a
[13:30] crown to her husband but she that maketh
[13:33] ashamed is as rottenness in his bones I
[13:37] would say this is two different types of
[13:38] crowns
[13:40] two different crownings one is life and
[13:42] power the other one is death
[13:43] one who had the virtuous woman crowns
[13:46] her husband is a herself a crown to her
[13:49] husband but one that maketh ashamed is
[13:51] rottenness in his bones one is a
[13:53] crowning of strength the other one is a
[13:55] crowning of death
[13:57] as it's read a virtuous woman that were
[13:59] their virtuous speaks of strength and
[14:01] even bearing and bringing forth a strong
[14:04] woman is an insignia
[14:06] she's an emblem she's a symbol of her
[14:08] husband's rule
[14:09] remember the crown represents dignity
[14:11] honor and power that is symbolic of
[14:13] one's Reign it's even symbolic of a
[14:15] government so here a woman is a crown
[14:18] she is symbolic of the husband's dignity
[14:22] she's symbolic of his honor symbolic of
[14:24] his art represents his power represents
[14:26] his authority whereas a shameful woman
[14:29] crowns her husband with death
[14:32] and as I've been looking at this and
[14:35] and I like to
[14:38] and in Sunday morning Lord will will
[14:40] start with how the woman reflects the
[14:44] character of the man
[14:46] and as I was looking at this scripture
[14:48] and I want to take it from this very
[14:49] scripture a virtuous woman is a crown to
[14:51] her husband so she is a an emblem and
[14:55] represents his dignity his character his
[14:58] power his honor
[15:00] and a woman who is shameful
[15:03] she reflects
[15:05] what is in the man
[15:08] and and if there be some sense of
[15:11] argument that well she she doesn't
[15:14] reflect what's in him
[15:16] if she doesn't reflect it she corrupts
[15:18] it
[15:19] maybe we could agree on that you say wow
[15:21] he's got he married the wrong woman and
[15:23] she's a bad woman but now that woman
[15:24] then has the power a shameful woman has
[15:27] power to be rottenness in his bones so
[15:30] it either reflects the rottenness that's
[15:32] already there in his character or the
[15:34] wrong woman can corrupt a man's
[15:37] character
[15:38] I think that's a mouthful maybe we
[15:40] should just read Acts 2 38 and
[15:43] and go forward because that's something
[15:45] to really think about
[15:46] now in Ezekiel chapter 21 verses 25 to
[15:49] 27
[15:51] it says in thou profane Wicked Prince of
[15:54] Israel I want you to see this the the
[15:56] this emblem of on his head were many
[15:58] crowns
[15:59] and thou profane Wicked Prince of Israel
[16:02] whose Day Has Come
[16:04] when iniquity shall have an end
[16:07] thus saith the Lord God remove the
[16:10] diadem and take off the crown
[16:12] I'm wanting to use these scriptures to
[16:15] understand better what these crowns on
[16:18] his head represented and how these
[16:20] crowns upon the head of Christ are
[16:22] symbolic of even your character
[16:24] symbolic of the bride of Christ as The
[16:27] Virtuous Woman as a crown to her husband
[16:28] and Christ is wearing many crowns that I
[16:30] want you to see yourself and even desire
[16:32] to be a crown on his head
[16:34] to be a crowning to him and now with
[16:37] this profane Wicked Prince of Israel in
[16:39] view as we could even associate this
[16:42] with the woman that makes her husband
[16:43] ashamed or is a shameful woman it says
[16:46] remove the diadem and take off the crown
[16:50] in Ezekiel 16 it says I put a beautiful
[16:53] crown on your head and out to the prince
[16:54] of Israel take off the crown take off
[16:57] the diadem this shall not be the same
[17:01] exalt him that is low and obeys him that
[17:04] is high
[17:05] I will overturn over turn overturn it
[17:09] and this isn't a record skipping
[17:11] this isn't this isn't the writer
[17:13] stuttering I will overturn overturn
[17:16] overturn it a three-fold overturning
[17:20] this absolute certainty of the
[17:23] overturning the undoing of what has been
[17:25] done I will overturn overturn overturn
[17:28] it and it shall be no more
[17:30] until he come who's right it is and I
[17:34] will give it him
[17:36] now this is the kingdom will rise again
[17:39] be taken away from the one that is
[17:41] undeserving taken away from the wicked
[17:44] Prince of Israel remove the diadem take
[17:46] off the crown overturn over turn
[17:49] overturn it with this absolute certainty
[17:51] there's going to be a taken away of the
[17:53] authority taken away from the glory
[17:55] taken away in a removal of the crown uh
[17:57] from them but I will give it to the one
[18:00] who's right it is that when he comes I
[18:03] will give it to him now that's Christ
[18:06] that's the Messiah speaking that there's
[18:09] going to be no matter how much it may
[18:10] look like in the natural that the
[18:12] kingdom is lost no matter how much it
[18:13] may look like in the natural that one
[18:15] has the right to the kingdom there's
[18:17] going to be one who seems to be very low
[18:19] who's going to be exalted one who does
[18:21] not look like a king who's going to be
[18:22] enthroned there's going to be a one
[18:24] who's right it is and I will give the
[18:27] crown to him I will give the diadem to
[18:30] him I will give all the glory and honor
[18:32] to him who's right it is
[18:35] speaking of the Kingdom
[18:38] and as the crown is removed remove the
[18:40] diadem and take off the crown the crown
[18:41] is removed to signify that there's no
[18:45] right to rule
[18:48] because they're unfit to rule
[18:51] it wouldn't be that they had no legal
[18:55] right or right by blood or right by
[18:58] lineage
[18:59] but there is a removal this wicked
[19:02] Prince of Israel this is one who should
[19:05] have assumed the crown you would argue
[19:07] by the name but it's the crown is taken
[19:10] away to signify he's unfit to judge
[19:13] I this is one who cannot represent the
[19:16] throne
[19:17] remember how the the scriptures speak of
[19:19] woe to the kingdom whose noble men and
[19:22] kings are eat and and fill their bellies
[19:25] in a time when they ought to be
[19:26] dispensing Justice and they they use the
[19:29] benefits of the crown they use the
[19:31] benefits of the resources of the kingdom
[19:33] and the people to fill their bellies and
[19:35] to lift themselves up when they ought to
[19:36] be committing themselves to judging the
[19:38] people faithfully and faithfully and
[19:40] looking over them as to how they could
[19:41] meet their needs and so there's a
[19:44] character that ought to come
[19:46] when I want ought to have the right
[19:48] character when they wear the crown
[19:51] remember King Lear how he began he got
[19:53] drunk on his crown he was eating uh
[19:55] that's that poison that Darnell in his
[19:57] crown and the removal of a crown is
[19:59] saying you're not fit to rule and you do
[20:02] not represent this Kingdom correctly you
[20:06] cannot represent the throne
[20:08] because the throne ought to be
[20:10] established in righteousness
[20:12] that means that the King's life is how
[20:15] the power of the throne is established
[20:17] not just what he says but what he does
[20:20] not in just how glorious and Powerful he
[20:23] may seem to be but a throne's
[20:25] credibility and even if I can speak this
[20:28] to the men who are here tonight your
[20:30] credibility as ahead your credibility as
[20:32] a leader your credibility as a father
[20:34] and a husband your credibility is one
[20:36] who would assume of office it's
[20:38] established in righteousness in your
[20:40] testimony not just gifts and callings
[20:43] but a life that follows it up that
[20:44] matches it and says this is one who has
[20:46] who's fit to step into that place
[20:50] and this is uh this is just this an
[20:54] incredible scripture to speak to that
[20:56] and brother Branham refers to it this
[20:58] way in the smyrnian church age he writes
[21:01] character as a victory not a gift
[21:04] character now this might be a I don't
[21:07] know if it's going to be a pretty big
[21:07] jump here but character is a victory
[21:11] character is not gifted
[21:14] oh Victory there's some there's
[21:16] something one
[21:18] fought for uh it's a reward it's not by
[21:21] Grace I give you and I bestow upon you
[21:23] apart from works and apart from effort
[21:25] and apart from anything I'm going to
[21:26] give you character wouldn't that be
[21:28] awesome right if we could just get it
[21:31] and say I now I lay my head to sleep
[21:33] Lord give me Victory character Lord give
[21:36] me character and we just wake up full of
[21:38] character and wisdom it's not how it
[21:40] comes characters of Victory not a gift
[21:41] and then he and that's a large statement
[21:44] right just a few words several words
[21:46] there but it holds so much meaning
[21:49] character is something that we arrive at
[21:52] through a fiery trials and the furnace
[21:54] of Affliction and opposition and
[21:56] difficulty and we're winning character
[21:59] if I could just
[22:00] encourage you that when you're suffering
[22:03] when you're sad when you're wrestling
[22:05] with emotions of melancholy or
[22:07] depression or anxiety and you're in the
[22:09] throes of it you're fighting and you're
[22:11] overcoming and you're you're making
[22:13] progress and maybe you get knocked down
[22:14] again I say this just to encourage you
[22:17] that your darkest moments and your most
[22:19] difficult trials they are they have a
[22:22] seed of character within them
[22:25] the one thing you could say for
[22:27] certainty as a son or daughter of God
[22:29] that when I am tried my something in me
[22:32] will step forward as the gold of God and
[22:36] it'll be the character of Christ and
[22:38] whatever the devil puts on you I know
[22:40] it's easy for me to say it when I stand
[22:42] behind the pulpit but I want there maybe
[22:45] something can be ringing within your
[22:46] hearts when you really go through it and
[22:48] just in the throes of emotions and
[22:50] Brokenness even if it be through weeping
[22:52] you'll say Satan I know the Christ's
[22:55] character is going to step forward
[22:57] through this because it's a promise
[23:01] that through our suffering there's a
[23:03] there's a victory and it's character
[23:07] and then he and then he takes this next
[23:09] step statement a man without character
[23:11] can't Reign because of power apart from
[23:13] character satanic
[23:15] this is a statement that has been
[23:18] expressed in millions of ways
[23:21] it's not something that's new in terms
[23:23] of
[23:24] the thought of how there's a lot to say
[23:27] power corrupts
[23:29] and and therefore you would have to have
[23:31] the right kind of character character
[23:33] when you step into power so I don't
[23:35] think this is a strange concept
[23:37] but a man without character cannot reign
[23:41] because power apart from character
[23:43] satanic
[23:45] and therefore the scripture in removing
[23:47] a crown is signifying wrong kind of rule
[23:52] wrong kind of character
[23:54] this would be one who could be moved the
[23:57] wrong way to accomplish the wrong kind
[23:59] of agendas is but Power with character
[24:01] is fit to rule
[24:04] and as a crown is associated with
[24:06] victory
[24:07] and character is a victory I'm just
[24:09] doing a little bit of math on a
[24:10] Wednesday night that the crown is
[24:12] associated with character
[24:15] as a virtuous woman as a crowned or a
[24:17] husband it's her character read proverbs
[24:19] 31 about a virtuous woman it's her
[24:21] character that's his crowning
[24:23] listen she's not a trophy wife because
[24:26] she in the sense that she looks good
[24:28] it's her character
[24:30] I I and that's a that's the beauty of a
[24:33] church is the character of the people
[24:35] that's the strength that we have in our
[24:37] lives is the character that we have
[24:39] characters what we take with us I tried
[24:42] to express that on Sunday that the the
[24:44] very crowns of gold that are upon the
[24:46] heads of the elders it's that character
[24:48] that christ-like character that they
[24:49] took with them they couldn't take any of
[24:52] their wealth they couldn't take any of
[24:53] their possessions but what they could
[24:54] take with them was their character
[24:57] and so character is a victory crowns are
[25:01] associated with Victory therefore this
[25:03] crowning of Christ
[25:04] this victory of Christ
[25:06] represents character
[25:09] the crown is symbolic of power and
[25:11] symbolic of character
[25:14] and in Revelations chapter 6 verse two I
[25:16] don't believe I have these scriptures
[25:18] maybe on the slide but remember how that
[25:19] the Antichrist Spirit goes riding out on
[25:21] a white horse
[25:22] and the Bible says they crown was given
[25:25] unto him
[25:28] there's there's not there's not an
[25:30] implication and and you say well it's
[25:32] just saying it's given and we could
[25:33] break down the we could get the Diagon
[25:36] out and we could break down the the
[25:37] Greek word and what I'm going to posit
[25:40] to you for you to study and prove
[25:41] whether or not I'm out on a limb here is
[25:43] it was given to him Victory didn't cause
[25:46] him to earn a crown
[25:48] because as he's given a crown and
[25:50] there's even in the Bible the crowns
[25:52] with no kingdoms
[25:53] all right so there's something
[25:54] superficial about this there's some
[25:57] pretense it's posturing that's going
[25:59] forward with us the crown was given him
[26:01] and he went forth conquering and to
[26:03] conquer and there's the clue he wore the
[26:05] crown before he conquered
[26:07] he put it on to have this inference of
[26:10] authority so that it could conquer where
[26:12] think of the what happens with Christ
[26:13] the crown and even as we might get into
[26:16] it later the first crowning war was the
[26:18] crown of thorns
[26:19] and he wore a crown of thorns and
[26:21] conquered
[26:23] and bought it and bought the paid the
[26:25] price as a mighty conqueror and here
[26:28] Satan puts the crown on first going out
[26:31] to conquer and this is satanic rule
[26:34] this is that present this is a
[26:36] presumptuous Crown this is that sense of
[26:39] entitlement
[26:41] where he feels that he has a right to it
[26:43] and I I say this to challenge all of us
[26:46] lest we ever get conceited or built up
[26:48] in our uh get lifted up a little bit in
[26:50] ourselves that we don't we don't get
[26:54] drunk on our own crowns
[26:57] and and take the Christ
[27:00] take the Christ out of the things we're
[27:02] feeding on and lift ourselves up and I
[27:05] believe it was brother loyal that was
[27:06] sharing this with me recently uh within
[27:08] maybe just the work culture how this the
[27:11] sense of entitlement once it gets shed
[27:13] then someone and there's this exists
[27:16] with a lot of people these days right
[27:17] because Justice and rights and I deserve
[27:20] this and I haven't right to that and
[27:22] there's a sense of that you owe it to me
[27:23] and you ought to give it to me and
[27:25] really we've got to shed this sense of
[27:27] entitlement
[27:28] in terms of uh what what God wants us to
[27:32] accomplish and we're not just going to
[27:34] be laying around getting it because this
[27:35] sense of entitlement carries with it
[27:38] this vanity of satanic rule
[27:41] I I I feel restrained in my words
[27:43] because that's that's not what I'm
[27:45] necessarily wanting to project is our
[27:47] attitude at this moment but how that
[27:49] Satan presumptually took this Crown put
[27:52] it on and then went out to conquer
[27:54] he didn't earn the crown he was given
[27:56] the crown and told to go conquer
[27:58] I think brother Branham when he looks at
[28:01] the scriptures I tried to read
[28:02] everywhere where these things are being
[28:03] mentioned he said he's playing the part
[28:04] of a hypocrite
[28:06] this is him playing the part of the
[28:08] hypocrite what does that mean he is
[28:10] telling you he wants you to see that
[28:11] he's got a bow in his hand and assume
[28:13] he's got arrows
[28:15] he wants you to see that he's got a
[28:16] crown on his head and assume he's a king
[28:19] there's something menacing about it
[28:21] Satan walks about as a roaring lion
[28:23] right this is the pretense this is
[28:25] hypocrisy this is the sense of
[28:27] entitlement these are the things that we
[28:29] need to shed and get away from
[28:33] because that's the that's not the right
[28:34] kind of character
[28:36] so on his head were many crowns I want
[28:39] you to see yourself in your life the
[28:41] life that you live
[28:43] as being a crown to Christ
[28:45] and it's represented in that image of
[28:47] this one riding on a white horse
[28:49] this is representative of the Bride
[28:52] because we ventured into this a little
[28:54] bit on Sunday it says and he had a name
[28:56] written that no man knew but he himself
[29:03] we looked at this from the perspective
[29:05] of us being associated with the name
[29:10] uh that our names being engraving in his
[29:13] hands
[29:14] and the image of us being in his hands
[29:16] and no man could pluck and claim them
[29:18] from theirselves claim them for
[29:19] themselves and so we looked at that in
[29:21] the sense that no man knows no man knew
[29:23] himself no man can claim you no man can
[29:25] own you
[29:26] and so there's that image in type of you
[29:30] now in Isaiah chapter 4 verse 1
[29:33] . so what you see he had a name written
[29:36] and and notice the importance of the
[29:38] name so we're going to get into the name
[29:39] now for a few moments and in that day
[29:42] brother Brahm said this date
[29:44] in that day seven women shall take hold
[29:46] of one man saying and I think it's good
[29:48] to look at that seven women as
[29:50] representative of climax of Satan's Eden
[29:53] as he's come through his six days and
[29:55] he's achieved his Eden his bride his
[29:58] woman
[29:59] but since he wants to be worshiped as
[30:01] God
[30:03] he does not claim to be Lucifer but he
[30:05] claims to be the son of God
[30:07] claims to be light
[30:09] and now these seven women's women's uh
[30:12] they shall take hold of one men one man
[30:15] saying we will eat our own breads
[30:18] and wear our own apparel
[30:20] now notice what these women's are doing
[30:22] I found a new stick here I these seven
[30:25] women will take a hold of one man
[30:27] they're going to lay claim to him
[30:30] and and this is the deal that they want
[30:32] to bargain
[30:33] I want to claim you
[30:35] and and if I could just dramatize it
[30:37] this way
[30:39] like we're together
[30:41] pretend you're with me
[30:42] don't worry I'll feed myself I'll clothe
[30:45] myself
[30:46] but I need to look like we're together
[30:49] what an offer that was made to Christ
[30:51] and the Temptation in the wilderness he
[30:53] says we will eat our own bread and wear
[30:54] our own apparel only let us be called by
[30:57] thy name
[30:58] to take away our reproach
[31:01] to be called by the name in this
[31:04] instance then is it seven women who want
[31:05] to lay claim to a man but yet keep keep
[31:09] their independence essentially kind of
[31:11] covered up on the uh hidden called by
[31:14] thy name it signifies a relationship
[31:17] signifies a marriage or Union that by by
[31:21] me being identified with you and being
[31:23] called by your name I want to be
[31:24] identified with your household I want to
[31:26] be identified with your headship
[31:29] and what they're looking for is a
[31:31] pretense of legitimacy
[31:34] this is a woman who has lived however
[31:37] she wants but she wants a crown put on
[31:38] her head to be identified with the
[31:40] throne but maintain her independence
[31:42] maintain her dominance maintain her role
[31:45] maintain her disposition she doesn't
[31:46] want to change
[31:49] and have this pretensive legitimacy
[31:52] hiding the adultery hiding the
[31:54] fornication being the mother of harlots
[31:57] and saying oh yeah he's the daddy these
[31:59] are all his
[32:00] no they're not
[32:02] but they want the pretense of legitimacy
[32:04] these this is what's being reflected
[32:06] here only let us be called by thy name
[32:10] let me say this name must be important
[32:12] if they want to be called by it must be
[32:14] some importance to the name if they want
[32:16] to be called by it the name here in the
[32:18] Hebrew speaks of reputation or fame or
[32:21] Glory we we want to be identified with
[32:23] you it speaks of a memorial or a
[32:25] monument let us make a name for
[32:27] ourselves as it said in Genesis as they
[32:28] built the Tower this is I want fame I
[32:31] want notoriety I want to be seen a
[32:33] certain way this reputation this Fame
[32:35] this Glory let us be called by your name
[32:38] so we can be associated with your
[32:39] character
[32:40] so we can be associated with who you are
[32:43] that yet hiding
[32:49] hiding the adultery
[32:55] in second Chronicles chapter 6 verse 33
[32:58] I'm just there's so much to be said
[33:01] about a name scripturally
[33:03] if you want to just uh
[33:06] maybe don't do it now
[33:08] um but
[33:09] just think of the songs we sing that
[33:11] edify the name of the Lord
[33:13] and speak about his name
[33:15] and we we should know according to the
[33:17] teacher the message that it's not just
[33:18] Jesus
[33:20] all right it's not just saying it's not
[33:22] just kind of that that structure of
[33:24] words and Jesus being Jehovah savior
[33:27] that's Joshua
[33:29] it's almost there is a recognition in
[33:31] the revelation of the name that
[33:34] transcends just the appellation or the
[33:36] nomination because remember brother
[33:37] Brown says they're Christians and name
[33:39] only
[33:41] there's something to the name and I
[33:43] recognize this in second chronicles 6 33
[33:45] where Solomon is dedicating the temple
[33:47] and this prayer that he prays so
[33:49] beautiful then hear thou from the
[33:51] heavens
[33:52] even from thy dwelling place and do
[33:55] according to all that the stranger
[33:57] calleth to thee for
[34:00] that would now think about the Gentiles
[34:01] because this is who he's talking about
[34:02] that all people of the earth may know
[34:05] thy name
[34:06] and fear thee as death thy People Israel
[34:09] what a what a prayer under the
[34:11] inspiration about the Gentiles and may
[34:14] know that this house which I have built
[34:17] is called by thy name
[34:20] God's chosen place of worship God's
[34:22] provided place of worship gives you a
[34:24] lot of Rich teaching on what it means to
[34:27] put your name somewhere and how his
[34:29] chosen place of worship is the place
[34:31] where he puts his name and it's not just
[34:34] a sign on a building it's not just what
[34:37] somebody calls themselves when he says
[34:39] that they may know that this house which
[34:41] I built is called by thy name it's a
[34:43] place that he wants to be associated
[34:45] with him
[34:47] it is then a habitation or Dwelling
[34:50] Place of his presence his name is there
[34:53] that he's there his name is there his
[34:55] power is there if his name is there it's
[34:57] characters there
[34:59] all the rights and privileges associated
[35:01] with the person and his presence if his
[35:04] name is there then he's got to be there
[35:07] the Bible says in Revelations 19 13 and
[35:09] his he was clothed with the Vester
[35:11] dipped in Blood and his name is called
[35:14] now brother man makes the distinction
[35:15] his name isn't the word of God but his
[35:18] name is called the word of God
[35:21] these seven women asking
[35:23] to be called by his name they want the
[35:26] word in name only
[35:28] but they don't want the word only
[35:30] they want to keep their bread and they
[35:33] want to keep their their dress
[35:35] these women want the word in name only
[35:40] not the word only
[35:43] and they want the name it says only let
[35:45] us be called by thy name to take away
[35:47] our reproach now that's striking
[35:50] they want the name to take away their
[35:52] shame
[35:54] if they can have the name and be
[35:56] identified with the name then it removes
[35:58] the reproach
[35:59] however you want to look at it in these
[36:00] reproaches of the Old Testament that a
[36:02] woman who's unmarried there's a reproach
[36:04] because this is what she desires to be
[36:06] is to be married so to take the name
[36:07] signifies she's married
[36:09] and then and taking the name and then
[36:12] being married she wants to have to be
[36:14] Barren as a reproach and so she this is
[36:16] the idea behind marriage is to Bear
[36:18] children but her children are
[36:19] illegitimate so she wants to take the
[36:21] reproach away of fornication
[36:24] this is this is what she's looking for
[36:25] she wants to hide her sins she wants to
[36:28] hide her adultery she wants to hide who
[36:30] she really is this mystery Babylon is
[36:32] full of all the sins but once the
[36:35] pretense of somebody glorious and
[36:36] Powerful
[36:38] when she wants the name she wants the
[36:40] name to take away the shame and reproach
[36:41] because a name relates to a person's
[36:43] character
[36:44] a name signifies power we say in the
[36:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not
[36:49] just because you recite the Lord Jesus
[36:50] Christ but it's something behind the
[36:52] name
[36:54] that oh noma in the in the Greek
[36:57] for name it's to be used the name when
[36:59] you say it the name it's used for
[37:01] everything which the name covers
[37:04] you say in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:06] Christ it's not the Linguistics and the
[37:09] syllables and the phonics of the Lord
[37:11] Jesus Christ but it's everything thought
[37:13] or the feeling of which is aroused in
[37:16] the Mind by hearing the name
[37:18] somebody's never heard of Jesus Christ
[37:20] you say the Lord Jesus Christ you say
[37:22] slow down a little bit what was that
[37:24] never heard it before why is it that
[37:27] demons are subject to the name it's not
[37:31] because of our accent it's not because
[37:33] of the way the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[37:35] held my hands a certain way and I did
[37:37] certain symbols no it's because they
[37:39] know the power behind the name and when
[37:42] that's evoked there's some something
[37:44] aroused by hearing that name and that's
[37:46] those things that relate to one's rank
[37:48] Authority interest pleasure commands
[37:51] Excellence as Deeds when you think of
[37:53] the name you want to think oh the name
[37:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ covers
[37:56] everything that Jesus Christ is and and
[37:59] that's the word which is eternal
[38:03] power which is endless
[38:06] when one uses a name character is
[38:08] attributed when you're called by a name
[38:11] only let us be called by thy name to
[38:14] take away our reproach therefore if we
[38:16] can be called by your name then we
[38:18] assume the assumption is oh if they have
[38:21] the name they have the character
[38:23] are you listening
[38:25] right if you heard that my nickname was
[38:27] stretch right or long legs and you never
[38:31] met me before you think oh he must be
[38:32] tall
[38:33] all right that must be it must be tall I
[38:36] I was going to start getting a nickname
[38:38] from high school probably not a good
[38:39] idea none of them were mine but I had a
[38:42] knew somebody whose nickname was two
[38:44] I always call them two
[38:46] he was a cool dude
[38:48] he's called two because he was as dark
[38:50] as two o'clock in the morning
[38:52] and that's what everybody in stop six
[38:54] called him and I was like where did we
[38:55] get this name from too and that's how
[38:57] names evolve there's some characteristic
[38:59] associated with it
[39:01] and there's a character attributed to a
[39:04] name
[39:06] now what these women are doing is
[39:07] remarkable then I feel like you're all
[39:09] with me you're just right there with me
[39:11] and it's it's 8 10 that's what the
[39:14] iPad's telling me thank you Siri
[39:17] and I was just waiting for your welcome
[39:20] I don't know if this iPad is set up for
[39:22] that and there's a there's something
[39:26] remarkable about this thing because
[39:27] let's say this woman I'm using I'm
[39:29] bringing in Revelation 17 and 18 to
[39:30] describe these women the mother of
[39:32] Harlot so we're kind of that's the image
[39:34] I hope that we all have here on
[39:35] Wednesday nights you guys have taken in
[39:37] all these Services we've been on through
[39:38] this
[39:39] that there's these women are saying well
[39:41] this is the reality of who I am but if I
[39:44] can somehow co-opt your name and get
[39:46] your name then my reproach and shame
[39:49] will be taken away
[39:50] but if you think about it taking a name
[39:53] resolves nothing
[39:55] it's a false Revelation unless there's
[39:58] true character there
[40:00] it's a trap unless the characters there
[40:03] it's satanic unless the name matches
[40:06] what's on the inside
[40:08] it's hypocrisy it's pretense it's too
[40:11] much out front or there's a lot of show
[40:13] it's that presumption of put a crown on
[40:15] them write them up put them on a white
[40:17] horse and he's going out with a bow and
[40:19] going out to conquer and he was
[40:21] successful in doing it with even out any
[40:23] arrows why because they used the
[40:25] pretense
[40:27] of the church and the power of Christ
[40:29] and the word of God and the scripture
[40:32] so just taking the name resolves nothing
[40:36] and the sermon painted Faith face
[40:38] Jezebel
[40:40] I need to do some tongue exercises
[40:42] before before I preach
[40:45] now Jezebel that's the name that makes
[40:47] everybody shiver
[40:48] just to say Jezebel isn't that a name
[40:51] that's becoming like I I don't know
[40:53] where it is in the naming charts but
[40:55] I've heard people naming their kids
[40:56] Jezebel these days not among people that
[40:58] we know but it's what's wrong with
[41:00] Delilah what's wrong with Jezebel well
[41:02] brother Branham touches on it here he
[41:04] said that was just a common name
[41:06] just a name like Martha Ruth or Mary or
[41:08] some other name
[41:10] he said well my child's name Ruth and
[41:11] say well have you considered Jezebel
[41:14] it's just another common name
[41:17] I think there is a little bit of a pro
[41:19] tip here if you like a name don't tell
[41:20] anybody because somebody's going to try
[41:22] to ruin it for you oh I went to school
[41:24] with the Todd yeah right and they just
[41:27] gonna it's gonna make it okay well I
[41:29] guess not
[41:32] wasn't that a Disney dog
[41:36] but when they or was that the fox I
[41:38] can't remember but that was just a
[41:41] common name just like Martha Ruth or
[41:42] Mary or some other name but when they
[41:44] just hear the name Jezebel it was all
[41:47] because of one woman took the wrong road
[41:51] now I'd imagine Jezebel just because she
[41:54] had the name of Jezebel didn't make her
[41:56] what she was
[41:59] this this the statements I'm going to
[42:01] read you might feel like oh well that's
[42:03] contradictory
[42:05] a true name
[42:07] ought to identify one's true character
[42:09] so the name that he has is true
[42:13] the name the woman wants that's not that
[42:15] doesn't represent who she really is
[42:18] he says the name of Jezebel didn't make
[42:19] her what she was it wasn't her name that
[42:21] did that it was her attitude
[42:23] that's what made it
[42:25] right and that's what can become of a
[42:27] name if you even think Joshua is Jesus
[42:29] then think of what that name means now
[42:32] because the character that came behind
[42:33] it the attitude that embraced it and
[42:35] redeemed it and the name shouldn't make
[42:37] a shiver like the attitude that she took
[42:39] ought to make you shiver
[42:42] right and try to take on any name we
[42:43] want but if the character's not changed
[42:45] right you could take any Ricky and
[42:47] nickname him or change his name to
[42:48] Benjamin but it doesn't change his
[42:49] character
[42:51] but you mentioned Jezebel
[42:54] and the name should make a shiver like
[42:55] the attitude that she took to make you
[42:57] shiver but you mentioned Jezebel ooh my
[43:00] but mentioned some of her sin oh well
[43:03] that's all right
[43:04] knows what's happened
[43:06] as the name theologically or biblically
[43:09] people are Christians like oh Jezebel
[43:12] she was a wicked Queen she was a wicked
[43:14] woman and said well did you know what
[43:16] her sins were it's like
[43:18] come on
[43:20] is that really what we're worried about
[43:21] well then what what's wrong with the
[43:23] name
[43:24] it makes you Sherry says but you
[43:25] mentioned Jezebel who am I but you
[43:27] mentioned her sin oh well that's all
[43:28] right it wasn't the name that made her
[43:30] it was her sin that made her what she
[43:32] was
[43:33] he says and I'm reading these not to
[43:36] contradict but just so you think of this
[43:37] layer your name don't make you what you
[43:40] are it's your character that makes you
[43:45] then your character molds you and makes
[43:47] you what you are
[43:49] then it's not just the name the name
[43:53] doesn't make the character the character
[43:56] makes the name
[43:58] anybody you know the women want the name
[44:01] oh well you've got the name but the name
[44:03] doesn't make the character the character
[44:05] makes the name if I could say this the
[44:07] women haven't taken the name of
[44:09] Christianity have profaned Christianity
[44:11] and made it something ugly
[44:14] people who've taken the name of Jesus
[44:16] Christ have turned it into a cuss word
[44:18] now there's no respect for it because of
[44:20] the way people live the way people have
[44:22] used it the way people have abused
[44:24] people and marginalized and the people
[44:26] are leaving Christianity and turning
[44:29] their backs on Christianity in in many
[44:30] ways is attributed to the the characters
[44:34] that have been associated with it
[44:38] says you the name doesn't make you what
[44:39] you are it's your character that makes
[44:41] you and your character molds you and
[44:42] makes you what you are therefore if you
[44:44] put a name to it it's the character that
[44:46] made the name
[44:47] so the name represents character I hope
[44:50] you can see how I built that
[44:52] that a name that matches the character
[44:55] builds the name therefore when you think
[44:56] of Jezebel the name Jezebel is
[44:59] reflective of her character it's not
[45:01] just the name it's the character
[45:02] associated with it she built that name
[45:06] then Jesus then he's the Builder as a
[45:08] son he's a builder of the family name
[45:10] John chapter 17 verse 26.
[45:14] he says I have declared unto them thy
[45:15] name the father's name I came in my
[45:17] father's name
[45:19] it wasn't that he just had a a name
[45:21] written on his forehead or it was just
[45:23] wasn't that the father's name only is
[45:26] just a a certain nomination but it's his
[45:29] character I've declared unto them thy
[45:31] name and will declare it I think that
[45:34] prophetic element of that
[45:36] that the love where thou has loved me
[45:38] may be in them and I in them
[45:41] something about u19
[45:43] I've declared thy name and when he
[45:45] declares it again there's some uniting
[45:47] of love him and us and he and he and us
[45:49] and us and him
[45:51] he says I've declared thy name in other
[45:53] words I've manifested God's character
[45:56] I I've expressed his attributes I've
[45:59] demonstrated the rights and powers that
[46:01] are only applicable to God
[46:05] and what I want to read a few statements
[46:07] just to drive this home when he says
[46:09] that they had a name written that no man
[46:11] knew but he himself the name has
[46:14] something to do with the life you live
[46:16] that the name is called the word of God
[46:18] then a life lived by the word is the
[46:20] word expressed
[46:22] that there's a character that we ought
[46:23] to take you want to call yourself a
[46:25] Believer then live the life you want to
[46:27] call yourself a Christian then live the
[46:29] life you want to say that you love
[46:32] everybody and you want to do this and
[46:34] you want to do that then do it
[46:36] live it
[46:38] because to declare a name is to manifest
[46:40] the attributes
[46:42] well the bam in the sermon the voice of
[46:44] God in the last day say you say what
[46:45] difference does the name mean why sure
[46:47] it means something your name
[46:48] characterizes your life
[46:51] there's that the name represents
[46:54] something
[46:55] the name is associated with one's nature
[46:57] and attributes remember was very curious
[47:00] be careful what you name your kids
[47:02] not because I recognize this because the
[47:05] name you give
[47:07] well then make can make them susceptible
[47:09] to how things are formed in their lives
[47:12] and what reputations they have I know
[47:15] sometimes this is why some of us
[47:16] struggle with the name way we were given
[47:18] and maybe we want to change the spelling
[47:20] and and we want to do things different
[47:21] because we think of our names in certain
[47:22] ways but yet the name you're given an
[47:25] opportunity you're given an opportunity
[47:28] just as Cain had a son named Enoch but
[47:30] that's not the one we think about
[47:32] we think of the one that's the the
[47:34] seventh from Adam because his character
[47:36] lifted the name up
[47:38] his character demonstrated the Purity
[47:40] and the life behind it and so a name is
[47:43] associated with one's nature and
[47:44] character and attributes and that's why
[47:46] we're careful with the name we give
[47:48] because the spirits that can be
[47:49] Associated the the power we put
[47:51] ourselves under
[47:53] is that not true and how we speak of our
[47:55] own children say oh well that's my
[47:57] stubborn one
[47:59] and the one over there who's really
[48:01] wants to be compliant is like wait I'm
[48:04] the stubborn one oh
[48:06] okay
[48:08] right
[48:10] and then you have somebody over there
[48:11] just as ordinary as anything well that's
[48:14] my weird one they're like Oh Come the
[48:16] weird one
[48:17] and they just think that's gonna become
[48:19] what you say about them
[48:21] the tough one you know that you might
[48:23] have a daughter that loves to get up
[48:25] early he's like oh she sleeps in and
[48:27] she's just in the room going
[48:29] I wonder when it's good to get out
[48:31] all right because she doesn't want to
[48:33] she's got to let reputation live up to a
[48:35] name to live up to
[48:37] just using these things to express that
[48:39] a name means something
[48:41] his name unveils a life it unveils a
[48:43] power
[48:45] I'm laying all this as a foundation to
[48:47] get into Kingdom character
[48:49] Kingdom order
[48:50] Kingdom Life
[48:54] a name then is either associated with it
[48:57] or it hides it
[49:00] the name is either identifying the
[49:02] character or the name is used to hide
[49:05] something
[49:06] that the name that they don't have
[49:08] that's in the name
[49:10] says the church name is associated with
[49:12] the nature of its character
[49:14] did you notice the sir Smyrna meaning
[49:16] bitter this is when he preaches the
[49:17] revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:19] so the church name is associated with
[49:21] the nature of its character and you
[49:23] notice each one of the church now it's
[49:25] the church name
[49:27] has nothing to do with the character
[49:29] it's the church name has something to do
[49:31] with the character of the church
[49:34] this is why God chose chooses this
[49:37] church in Smyrna this is the the
[49:38] attributes and characteristics
[49:39] associated with that are reflective of
[49:41] the age and he says the church name has
[49:44] something to do with the character of
[49:45] the church now let's put on our
[49:47] spiritual thinking caps
[49:48] as brother Branham is preaching in
[49:50] Branham Tabernacle he says I could say
[49:52] something here but I better not
[49:54] because you'd get me wrong
[49:57] your name does too you might not know
[49:59] but it does you're saying there's
[50:00] something that's to a name
[50:03] and I I speak this openly because I
[50:05] don't believe these things are being
[50:06] done in private
[50:07] that they're being done publicly but the
[50:10] BR the Branham Tabernacle has become
[50:12] only
[50:14] a memorial to brother Branham
[50:19] that's that's what it's become
[50:21] because there's something to a name
[50:24] and name it Branham Tabernacle God
[50:26] allowed brother Branham to do it it's
[50:28] descriptive in it and it fit he was the
[50:30] founder of it but watch where it leads
[50:32] and where it ends up
[50:34] and I don't believe that there's any
[50:35] shame or reproaching in the way that I'm
[50:37] saying it because I think these things
[50:38] are out there and they're very vocal and
[50:40] very public about what they're trying to
[50:41] lift up and who they point to and who
[50:43] they're following and what the sum and
[50:45] substance is
[50:47] and I there's certain things maybe that
[50:51] uh we could just begin to draw from that
[50:53] and conclude from that but the name
[50:55] means something and maybe I'm venturing
[50:57] out a little bit but he says I could say
[50:59] something here but I better not and what
[51:00] I thought of is the fact that the church
[51:02] name was Branham
[51:05] and what it becomes
[51:07] because there's something to a name
[51:10] now I know that's just everything I've
[51:12] been saying about a name whether Jezebel
[51:13] uh there's names associated with
[51:16] character your name is what makes you
[51:17] that's just a giant field
[51:20] right but if you could somehow pick it
[51:23] all together to back up there's a name
[51:25] written
[51:27] there's a name that you take on there's
[51:29] a name there's a name that you bear
[51:33] and God says and Jesus says I've
[51:36] declared unto them thy name and will
[51:38] declare it
[51:40] there's this prophecy a prophetic
[51:42] element to this I've declared it but I
[51:45] will declare it again again
[51:47] I've declared unto them thy name
[51:51] and if I could say this I will when he
[51:53] says I will declare it again and I'm
[51:55] just building off a vast reservoir of
[51:58] statements and scriptures I have
[52:00] declared unto thine them thy name and he
[52:03] says his prayers that the love that thou
[52:05] Hast loved me may be in them and I in
[52:09] them
[52:10] so it says I pray that they would be one
[52:12] as we are one he says at that day you
[52:14] shall know that I am in the father you
[52:16] and me and I and you
[52:18] and brother says what day this day when
[52:20] the Revelations made known so when he
[52:22] says I will declare it again if he's
[52:24] going to declare it and he says and I am
[52:27] in them then it's not necessarily just
[52:29] being declared unto us but be declared
[52:32] through us
[52:34] it's something that's going to be
[52:35] declared in us that we become the
[52:38] Declaration of Jesus Christ that we
[52:40] become the bearers of his life he has no
[52:42] eyes but your eyes he has no hands but
[52:44] your hands he has no feet but your faith
[52:46] he has no voice but your voice that we
[52:49] become the body and the voice of the
[52:51] Lord Jesus Christ in the last days
[52:54] the Bible says in Acts 15 14
[53:00] that all the people may of the earth may
[53:02] know thy name
[53:03] they know that this house which I built
[53:05] is called by thy name this Prophecy in
[53:07] the Old Testament of Gentiles coming to
[53:09] thy light semen have declared how God at
[53:11] the first did visit the Gentiles
[53:14] why did God visit the Gentiles to take
[53:16] out of them a people for his name
[53:19] it's just right there
[53:22] it's right there in the scripture why is
[53:24] God going to visit the Gentiles why is
[53:26] God pouring out his Spirit upon the
[53:27] Gentiles why is God bringing and
[53:29] birthing into the body of Christ uh
[53:31] Gentiles to get a people for his name
[53:35] in other words God's going to give them
[53:37] a crown
[53:39] he's going to give them a name gonna
[53:40] give them power
[53:42] gonna give a crown to she
[53:45] who's right it is
[53:50] going to call a people out for his name
[53:54] that means they're Worthy of his name
[53:57] ones who's right
[54:00] it is
[54:02] ones who are elected out of the earth
[54:04] and predestinate to this the ones who
[54:07] could recognize the rightful position
[54:09] the right place in the Kingdom
[54:13] oh I believe so much of the word is not
[54:16] one is to have this false humility well
[54:18] I'm just not worth it and I'm just
[54:19] really a nobody and it just becomes
[54:22] seeds of compromise
[54:23] as it become sore spots for the devil to
[54:26] work in yeah that's right you're not
[54:27] worthy that's why you're gonna die of
[54:28] cancer
[54:29] right wait I'm sorry that's the wrong
[54:31] voice you're right you're not worthy
[54:35] I know kind of stroke that and pet that
[54:37] a little bit
[54:38] but one who's right it is
[54:42] brother I'm taking this scripture in
[54:43] Jehovah Jireh part one said this
[54:45] Covenant has to be confirmed with the
[54:46] Royal Seed of Abraham and think of the
[54:48] confirmation of the Covenant with the
[54:49] Royal seed
[54:51] and the signs and wonders that are given
[54:53] through his ministry which are the
[54:54] people out of the Gentiles not Jews a
[54:55] people out of the Gentiles for his
[54:57] namesake taking it for his name
[55:00] the church that's got his name will come
[55:02] back into him
[55:04] the church that has his name the ones
[55:06] whose position it is who's right it is
[55:08] will come back then because that's who
[55:10] she is her life
[55:13] it'll come back to that he says and why
[55:16] little Bethlehem
[55:17] he says oh my goodness I didn't realize
[55:20] I had this many notes I'm sorry
[55:22] he says the bride will be made up of
[55:24] gentiles
[55:26] the Gentile he'll take a people out for
[55:29] his namesakes that's his name he took a
[55:32] wife out of the Gentiles so he says I
[55:34] want to take a people for my namesake he
[55:37] says I want to get a bride out of the
[55:39] peoples of the earth I want to get a
[55:41] bride out of Nations spread out of the
[55:44] whole Earth this is what I've done in
[55:46] natural type to Israel I am now going to
[55:48] do spiritually to the people of the
[55:50] whole earth because I have elected them
[55:52] out of the earth and they're going to be
[55:54] called by my name in other words he's
[55:56] taken a wife
[55:58] and when he takes a wife when there's a
[56:00] union oh think of this how much there is
[56:02] to this when he takes a wife that's the
[56:04] day of his gladness and the uniting time
[56:07] when he's there eating wedding soup with
[56:09] his wife that's the time that the crown
[56:12] of gladness is there upon his head
[56:15] Hallelujah that's the time he says oh
[56:17] I'm excited this is when I'm happy this
[56:20] is my crown of rejoicing
[56:23] because this is one who can bear my name
[56:27] part three this is just two days after
[56:29] he had said this church that's got his
[56:31] name will come back into him he says
[56:33] shown here plainly the Royal seed bride
[56:35] will not be called by the church
[56:36] denominational she-goat sacrifice
[56:39] no but by him
[56:41] I'm using these statements just to
[56:43] summarize scripture so that we could be
[56:45] quick
[56:46] he says the man of but by him the
[56:49] manifested word of the RAM for he is the
[56:51] word and the realm not called he said
[56:53] not called by her name
[56:55] by her name but called by his name
[56:58] he'd take a people out of the Gentiles
[57:00] not for her name but for his name would
[57:02] bear his name
[57:04] oh my what are you afraid of it then for
[57:06] then
[57:07] why should we be afraid of it
[57:11] if the name in the instance here where
[57:14] if he's
[57:15] not how people don't want to baptize in
[57:17] his name they don't want to pray in his
[57:19] name if they're some kind of scarecrow
[57:21] given to the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:22] Christ his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:25] his character
[57:27] that name covers all that he is he is
[57:29] the word that's what we can read over
[57:31] and over and organ he is the word he is
[57:32] the word he is the word then why should
[57:34] we be afraid of the word
[57:36] don't let the devil put any scare in you
[57:39] when it comes to the word of God
[57:41] let him not put a scare in you at all of
[57:44] anything that's in the word of God
[57:48] he says what are you afraid of it for
[57:49] then a gentile would bear his name the
[57:51] ram not her name the church not she but
[57:53] he he says hallelujah
[57:57] Hallelujah
[57:59] we'll invite our musicians to come as I
[58:01] read this lengthy statement from the God
[58:02] of this evil age I think this will just
[58:04] be a great place to stop
[58:09] he says now notice closely now as we
[58:11] study the word the God of this evil age
[58:13] that we're now living
[58:16] he repeats this phrase a few times he
[58:18] says it may seem strange a very strange
[58:20] thing in this age of Grace
[58:24] when God has taken a people for his
[58:26] namesake that his bride
[58:29] in this evil age that he should
[58:31] that should be called the age of evil
[58:34] and it's strange
[58:36] that the age
[58:38] when the bride is being taken out
[58:41] that Satan has become the god of this
[58:43] evil age
[58:45] that intake Satan's Eden and marriage
[58:47] and divorce and a lot of things that
[58:48] he's preaching that amplify some of
[58:50] these thoughts he said the very age that
[58:52] God is calling a people for his namesake
[58:54] by grace
[58:55] and out is called an evil age
[59:00] let me say this the bride is called out
[59:02] of laodicea the very age that God's
[59:05] calling the people out for his namesake
[59:07] called out of an evil age now we'll
[59:09] prove it by the Bible that this is the
[59:10] age that he was speaking of very strange
[59:13] thing to think that in an evil age like
[59:16] this that God then would be calling his
[59:18] bride did you notice he said to people
[59:21] not a church
[59:23] why yet it's called the church but he
[59:25] would call a people
[59:27] oh she said that I would call a people
[59:30] for his name I believe this is very
[59:32] important
[59:33] [Music]
[59:38] God has ordained local churches to feed
[59:40] his body
[59:43] but let's not turn him into fig leaves
[59:48] [Music]
[59:50] he says call to church but he would call
[59:52] a people now a church is a gathered of
[59:54] many people of all different makeups but
[59:56] God is calling one here
[59:58] he and his Al call Methodist Baptist
[1:00:00] Pentecostal he said he'd call a people
[1:00:03] what for his name a people one from the
[1:00:06] Methodist one from the Baptist one from
[1:00:08] the Lutheran one from the Catholics see
[1:00:11] but he's calling not a church group but
[1:00:13] a people for his name that receives his
[1:00:16] name engaged in his name going to a
[1:00:19] wedding to be married to him to become a
[1:00:20] part of him by predestination
[1:00:23] oh Hallelujah
[1:00:25] just as a man that chooses the right
[1:00:27] wife in life was ordained to be part of
[1:00:30] his body
[1:00:31] so the bride of Christ will be and is
[1:00:33] now from old ordained by God to be a
[1:00:36] part of that body it says oh the
[1:00:38] scriptures are so rich full of honey
[1:00:41] this is what Christ has done
[1:00:43] just as a man chooses the wife
[1:00:46] and in choosing her she's identified
[1:00:48] with him
[1:00:50] and therefore if she's shameful she's
[1:00:52] rottenness in his bones but if she's
[1:00:54] virtuous she's a crown to him
[1:00:57] because a woman
[1:00:58] reflects a man's character
[1:01:03] God's calling one in this evil age
[1:01:06] to be his wife
[1:01:08] not the church group
[1:01:10] I if the spirit will be so closely to
[1:01:13] see the elective very if possible and
[1:01:17] we're not all just refusing to ever go
[1:01:20] to Rome unless we get dirty right like
[1:01:21] it's not the Catholic church it's it
[1:01:24] even tries to impersonate
[1:01:26] the word of God at the highest levels
[1:01:30] don't say that to try to scare you
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:34] I say that just to awaken us to this
[1:01:36] desire oh Lord
[1:01:38] [Music]
[1:01:39] I I need you more than ever before I
[1:01:41] need you
[1:01:44] I call it a church group it's not just
[1:01:46] in the church name it's not just in a
[1:01:47] collection of churches or a group of
[1:01:49] uh of ministers or
[1:01:52] a collection of fellowships it's got to
[1:01:54] be you as an individual that finds your
[1:01:56] satisfaction in Christ
[1:01:59] I need to read this in the sermon the
[1:02:01] unveiling of God
[1:02:03] if you could just ready yourselves in
[1:02:06] your hearts just to close the service
[1:02:08] and we'll be going to the baptism soon
[1:02:11] for the rest is every Parable in the
[1:02:13] Bible every type of the Bible is made
[1:02:14] manifest right here before us wow
[1:02:18] he said that he's to confirm the
[1:02:21] Covenant to the Gentiles think of what
[1:02:23] this message of the hour is doing
[1:02:25] the same God in the pillar of fire that
[1:02:27] wrote the Bible both in the Old
[1:02:28] Testament and New Testament is right
[1:02:30] here in manifesting it showing just
[1:02:32] exactly what it was interpreted it right
[1:02:34] back to make sure that it's the
[1:02:36] interpretation we've got the
[1:02:38] interpretation
[1:02:39] then let's see it happen I love that
[1:02:43] we've got it we've got the
[1:02:44] interpretation I believe we can say we
[1:02:47] do have today that which is perfect
[1:02:50] he says then let's see it happen
[1:02:54] see that's it let's see it made manifest
[1:02:56] manifest Jesus said if I do not the
[1:02:59] works of my father Believe Me Not
[1:03:01] see it's got to be proven listen to me
[1:03:04] now as I read this but now not proven
[1:03:06] like Jesus they put a rag around his
[1:03:09] head and hit him on the head saying if
[1:03:10] you're a prophet tell us who hit you
[1:03:12] what were they doing they dressed him up
[1:03:14] as a king and were mocking him
[1:03:17] says if you're the Son of God turn this
[1:03:19] bread
[1:03:20] up King of the Jews King of the Jews all
[1:03:22] the devil wants you to try to play the
[1:03:24] part of a queen
[1:03:26] he says see that's the devil if you're
[1:03:28] the Son of God come off that
[1:03:30] so he says not that he says I mean the
[1:03:33] Revelation that he's supposed to do
[1:03:35] that's what it is
[1:03:37] notice how there's a spirit that may
[1:03:39] want wants you to clown for the devil
[1:03:42] do this do that he says no no it's it's
[1:03:45] not those things it's going to prove it
[1:03:47] what the Revelation says you're supposed
[1:03:50] to do
[1:03:52] what the Revelation says you're supposed
[1:03:54] to do and he says but now as Revelation
[1:03:56] 10 is revealed
[1:03:58] mysteries of God are made manifest known
[1:04:00] as the seven sealed book promised now
[1:04:03] let your faith in him who is the word
[1:04:07] because in Revelation 19 when he comes
[1:04:10] he's going to be called the word of God
[1:04:13] and upon a white horse and the followers
[1:04:15] of heaven will be behind him now what a
[1:04:18] statement
[1:04:19] what a statement now I know that maybe
[1:04:21] there's a construct that's going to push
[1:04:23] Revelations 10 all the way for the open
[1:04:26] of the seventh seal push it all the way
[1:04:28] forward after the time of the change
[1:04:30] after the Rapture even maybe you try to
[1:04:32] push it all away till after uh when
[1:04:34] we're coming back in the Millennium and
[1:04:37] just try to set the picture that way but
[1:04:39] what he says next tells me
[1:04:41] that if there's any truth to that
[1:04:44] that's another thing
[1:04:46] but there's a truth to the fact that
[1:04:48] Revelations 10 is history
[1:04:50] and that the very events of this Mighty
[1:04:52] Angel descending with the book open to
[1:04:54] reveal the mysteries of God has
[1:04:55] something to do with me becoming the
[1:04:57] voice has something to do with me eating
[1:05:00] the book and taking on his life and his
[1:05:02] character and he says Revelation 10 let
[1:05:05] your faith in him who is the word
[1:05:06] because in Revelation 19 let your faith
[1:05:10] in him who is the word because he who in
[1:05:12] Revelation 19 will come riding on a
[1:05:15] white horse called the word of God let
[1:05:17] your faith in him who is the word he
[1:05:19] says break the denominational veil of
[1:05:21] Education break the denominational veil
[1:05:24] of tradition break those veils that's
[1:05:26] hiding him from you
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:29] it now break the veils
[1:05:32] he's a veil breaker are you listening to
[1:05:35] me tonight he says break those veils of
[1:05:37] Pride you women your King's Daughters
[1:05:40] act like it live like it
[1:05:44] whose name is called the word of God let
[1:05:48] him break every Veil
[1:05:51] he says break every bill
[1:05:53] no matter what PhD and lld says if it's
[1:05:57] contrary to that Bible breakthrough that
[1:05:59] Veil
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:01] we've crossed the Riven Veil we're on
[1:06:03] the other side now on the other side
[1:06:06] and you will see if you'll just do that
[1:06:08] break those old traditions and things
[1:06:10] that come to him you'll see him standing
[1:06:14] why don't they see him standing too many
[1:06:15] Traditions why don't we see him standing
[1:06:18] too many Traditions he says you'll see
[1:06:20] him standing the mighty conqueror the
[1:06:22] Word of Promise for this age May
[1:06:24] manifest you will see the Mighty God
[1:06:27] unveiled see him right Among Us here
[1:06:30] unveiled the Mighty God unconquered by
[1:06:33] traditions
[1:06:35] oh is he here writing now is he here now
[1:06:38] to break veils and traditions and notice
[1:06:41] he says break the veils of pride
[1:06:43] and if I could say he says you women
[1:06:46] let me say break the break the veils
[1:06:48] because we're Kings
[1:06:51] or the king's wife act like it
