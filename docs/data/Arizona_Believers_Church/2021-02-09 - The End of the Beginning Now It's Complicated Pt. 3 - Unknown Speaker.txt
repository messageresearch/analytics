TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i want to welcome our friends from flagstaff and also wichita kansas god bless you it's nice to see you here today it's just been a real encouragement to us as a body to have so many different friends uh show their support to the church and come and participate in worship with us haven't we enjoyed that the last five months it's been wonderful to see that luke chapter 10 verse 38 now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she helped me and so that's uh one reading that i would like for you to catch and then also looking at john chapter 12 verses 1 to 5. and i want you to even kind of hold that question in your minds that martha asked the question do you not care that my sister is sitting around at your feet while i'm busy you know preparing dinner and cleaning the house and doing everything that's necessary to domesticate and and asking that you know do you care and she's assuming that he would say yeah i care then tell her to help me out right that's the question that's being asked john chapter 12 verses 1 to 5 then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany where lazarus was which was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him so we're seeing it from a different perspective where it's not just a certain village in a certain house it's very it's a little bit more specific as john does give details even in chapter 11 that no other writer gives in the new testament and he says then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simon's son which should betray him thank you john for selling out judas early on here so we know as we read into this story and i think it's just great how john does that except when it comes to him it's that the one whom jesus loved laid his head on his bosom and he's just so humble as to not mention his name there but here he makes sure that lazarus gets or judas gets called out and then said judas iscariot simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence and given to the poor two different questions being asked in the same setting it's just remarkable let me ask that you could be seated at this time while i remain standing i think we're still working out a few kinks maybe in the sound but i do want to say thank you to brother john and brother mitch who've just worked tirelessly and even brother mike and sister jennifer even last night coming and setting up the room and the different things there's so many of you that participate a church that's small and say well how many people do you have on your staff well how many many people we have in our church you know that's the staff you know people want to know how many you have in your administration or your board but we're all together in this and i just appreciate everyone who's labored so hard and so be patient with us as we get used to a new facility it's nice to see so many of you here looks like we've lost some people maybe in the move but they'll find us eventually so i want to continue on the subject that we've been on on the the end of the beginning and now it's complicated and just try to just to jump right into it without much background i think this subject matter would be impactful without um the preface of the last two services and even this kind of continuing on the series of in the beginning but the world that we live in is increasingly becoming more complicated if it's complicated today to the measure of six it's just in a matter of time it'll be cranked up to 13. so it just continues to get more and more complicated it's a chaotic world it's a world that can be very confusing at times and maybe at all times it's confusing in some manner there's events that take place and things that happen that seem very inconsistent we're told one thing so we begin to expect something but then another thing happens and then there's a completely different explanation and justification that kind of contradicts what we had heard before and so we're constantly just being tossed you know to and fro between opinions and ideas and events and circumstances and we saw that how even solomon in ecclesiastes begin to characterize the world that we live in is inconsistent that the just man receives the wicked man's reward and the wicked man gets what the just man should and we see princes walking besides horses and servants on top of him he says the rules and the order and what you would expect and the inconsistencies and the unjust outcomes you just saying this is this is very a very difficult thing to try to figure out and get our heads around what's happening in the world and so it's a harsh time it's a very difficult time and i want you i hope that you could just kind of just jump right into it with me and kind of walk with me through this and try to identify it with it yourself i have a number of scriptures that i'd like to read and i think sometimes we have the habit of when we read scripture we literally go back in our mind well maybe not literally figuratively we go back to that time and we think we begin to think that what was it like then and what was being said then and who was that being said to and what was taking place then but i wanted to be informative and instructive to us where we are today and be able to take it as something that's going to inform our spirits and encourage our faith is looking at god saying i want to write a book that my bride in the end time can read and know everything that's that's ever happened that's right and even and even have a message come that it can enlighten us to what god has unfolded and the things that have transpired since the coming of christ and all these things in these events we have the benefit of looking back and seeing all church history and everything god did in the new testament everything god did in the old testament everything that god had in his mind and in his heart before the foundation of the world and that's to encourage us and strengthen us to have rapturing faith and so i want you to personally identify with the subject matter uh that is and try to do your best to make it relevant to where you are today and my kind of my premise is life is not simple and in that we don't have just the luxury of going to work and eating and sleeping and that's really all that we need to worry about just go to go to work you're going to get your paycheck it's going to pay for what you eat it's going to pay for your bed where you sleep and then you wake up in the morning and you kind of live a shampoo life where you just water rinse you know lather rinse repeat and that's what we're doing every day we just do the same thing over and over and over again and so we're not just able to labor we're not just able to eat we're not just able to go to bed and wake up in the morning and repeat we have so many different intrusions so many different demands by virtue of the fact that you have a job there's different things that uh benchmarks that you have to meet and certain things you have to fill out all the time and there's so much more pressure when you work and even now a lot of people are self-employed and you know it's a double-edged sword it's a kind of a mixed bag it's a huge upside to it but there's a huge downside to it if you work at home work is always at home if you work for yourself and you're you're an employee employer then you have to worry about all sorts of employees and insurance and taxes and different things and so just to get your mind thinking along those lines it can be very very complex it's just not as simple as going to work taking the money you earned at work eating and then going to bed and there's always been complexity to our human existence it's always been there's always been layers to it there's always been nuances there's always been some intricate details about the physical body about the creation that we live in about the demands upon our flesh but it's become increasingly complex there's more layers to it there's more details to it and we're looking at the difference between complex and complicated just to give us some reference point if you want to use those words interchangeably if you want to use them some other way i'm not establishing a doctrine where we go well we believe in complex here instead of complicated no it's not a doctrine it's just a reference point so that you know what i'm referring to to make a distinction be something that can be complex and something that can be complicated but complex is composed of interconnected parts and you'll find that something that's complex because there's interconnected parts and things that relate to one another it looks complex but it's really just a combination of simple things and many different simple things or different simple elements being combined together to make something complex so something complex can be easily understood through special knowledge by taking time to examine it and seeing how these simple parts relate to one another so if you have a special knowledge or skill or understanding maybe a particular experience something that may seem very complex it loses its complexity and it becomes simple to that person who has that knowledge and skill of it it could be that way with the corn maze you go through it the first time like man this is complex there's all these dead ends but then you finally make it through and you go through the next time i say just follow me i'll take all the fun out of it right because you know exactly how to get through it and that can be something that's complex and it's beginning it's a labyrinth there's different ways and they always dead end but yet you once you figure it out it becomes a it's no longer complex but it becomes simple and complicated where actually the word complicated means to fold together to intertwine so something's complicated it's woven together and in being woven together you're unable to identify certain distinctions you don't know where it starts and where it ends and so it it's woven or folded together in a confusing manner and so something that is complicated there may be no rationale to it what is this it's all just kind of lumped together and these parts don't seem to fit and this doesn't even make sense this doesn't belong here so there's no rationale or order to it and in doing so it's not simple anymore because there's really no logic behind it there's no rationale behind it there's no reason behind the combination of the mixing or the blending together and that's when something's complicated and so i wanted to show this picture of a flight deck to give an example the difference between something complex and complicated and i was hoping that captain hayes would be here because he might have just immediately identified what type of aircraft this is captain phelan may actually know uh which one it is but you know if you look at this flight deck now to us us non-pilots this looks very very complicated right like we can't even make sense of it unless you play flight simulator or something uh but there's you begin to look at all the different details and intricacies and all the buttons and all the knobs and it looks like something really fun to play in but to us we don't even know how to make heads or tails of it you know what does this do what does that do and all the even to the top there's all these switches that even go further back than just this panel here and um it's really a very very modern uh flight deck or cockpit is how its non-pilots would refer to it um but it's uh to a pilot though he would immediately look at this and say oh it's not complicated it's complex but it's not complicated and since they have the knowledge and the skill of how to uh to pilot this aircraft this dreamliner they would be able to look at this and say oh well this does this and this does this and this is here for that and the reason why this is here and they would have a skill and knowledge and training to make sense of all the buttons all the switches all the levers and all the things that are in that flight deck and actually a pilot could even look at something complex like this and explain it to us in such a way to where it's no longer complicated we may not really fully grasp it but it takes away the complications and it gives more of a rationale and a logic to what we're looking at and that's how things can be uh the difference between something being complex and complicated to a non-pilot this is this is complicated but to a pilot this is very complex and many different nuances and layers it's very intricate but it's something he could explain now if this cop cockpit is complicated and someone who's just flown a few thousand miles and got got gold status wants to begin to tell you what's going on in here they're not gonna be able to explain it you know what this button does here and what this buzz button does there and when you realize you can't explain something then you probably don't understand it right and that's sometimes how the gospel gets complicated people who don't understand it try to teach it and it becomes more complicated and then we rationalize ooh that must be mysterious but there's a difference between something being complicated and complex because christ himself is is something that is there's so many different things to the word of god so many different layers so many different prophecies so many different attitudes and junctures and fulfillments and things and so we don't want to just try to make it so make it carnally simple but recognize that there's ways that life has become very very complicated and has nothing to do with the natural complexities of it and so thank you brother john for showing that maybe we can have him sign a few copies later and so what we've been doing is to begin to resolve the complications of this life we've been looking at the beginning for contrast and even for clarity to realize that where we are now is really the mature the maturing of seeds that were sown in the very beginning and life in the beginnings we've been saying was simple yet complex complex but not complicated that's the way it was in the beginning it was a very simple life but there was some complexity to it but yet in that it was not complicated and the complexity of life for adam and the woman was resolved through rules and through order and through structure and through the arrangement of things and god had laid it out in such a way to where there was some an approach to the things that they would be facing that would be based upon understanding so though it might be complex in some ways they were very simple towards what they had to do and there was no complication and that's how god simplified life for them in the beginning he gave man and the woman a very clear word order rules to live by things to do and as long as they stayed within that program then there was there was continuity there was harmony and there was a clear direction forward but complication involves something being introduced or just even something being convoluted or something unknown or something being turned upside down and mixed up it's something that becomes unpredictable or irrational and so when you go back to genesis chapter 3 that's where you begin to see complication introduced where things get cloudy and unclear and confusing but genesis 1 and genesis 2 that was the simple life that was just a very straightforward god gave a word but then genesis chapter 3 introduces this complication and the woman i want to phrase it this way the woman was offered a choice that the word had already answered so she would there there was it had already been spelled out there should have been no question marks if there was a question mark then they had they knew the one to ask they would ask the lord well lord what what is your plan for this and what is your plan for them but herein comes the complication when the serpent beguiled eve as it says in second corinthians 11 3 and 4 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ for he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with them so it's important as we read this to begin to consider how satan was able to corrupt the woman how was he able to defile her in the paradox of paradoxes a woman in a perfect eden with the perfect husband with perfect fruit with a perfect god everything was perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect how could all this perfection be soiled how could she fall from this perfection if he was put in a place of absolute perfection with no evil no doubt no death nothing no fear no worry and anxiety what could happen to cause her to leave that position and become vulnerable and something very extraordinary just to ponder and begin to think about how did she fall from this so consider how satan was able to gain access to her spirit and her mind to cause her to fall and to to beguile it means to just defile in the slightest degree and so as we look at satan's tactics and we see that paul is saying that as the serpent beguiled the woman in the beginning i fear that he would likewise beguile you now why is paul saying that because his tactics don't change that if the woman in a perfect eden in a perfect situation with a perfect god and a perfect husband and a perfect world satan could come to her and defile her in the slightest sense to cause the fall then he says look let's not be deceived satan is like a roaring lion as peter says as a roaring lion he's not one but he comes as one to cause fear to cause doubt he says walking about seeking whom he may devour and so paul is saying i this is something i'm fearful of and paul was right to have that fear because the antichrist spirit was already at work and the church was falling away and so he was right of the as the messenger and as a prophet to fear that but i thank god in this age there's no fear of the the elect falling away there's no fear but we still face the same devil and we've got to conquer what others have not conquered and so he's trying to get us to realize that his tactics do not change paul called the devil in second corinthians 4 4 the god of this world and he says that the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel who is in the image of god should shine unto them what a what a connection to the man who was in the beginning in the image of god but now after the fall comes jesus christ the second adam the last adam he says satan is still yet again fighting against this expression and he's the god of this world he's actually said to be the god of this world he's the god of this evil age now that's a very remarkable way for paul to write it because we'd say well isn't our god the god of this world doesn't he own it all but it's a reference to the power in the influence that satan and demons and forces and influences have upon the world today in ephesians chapter 2 verse 2 where in time past you walk according to the course of this world so there was a force that animated you there's something that drove you there's a mindset that caused you to make particular decisions he said according to the prince of the power of this world this is satan this is evil this is the god of this world now he's called the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so there's a spirit at work and there's a way that we can simplify things and i i admit that it can be an oversimplification but there's good and evil that's it and wouldn't it be nice if it was just that easy well there's good and there's evil and so you just expect this bright lying difference between things but really all we have just we're living in the gray there is good and there is evil but we're living in the grave this is a pale horse this is something this is something that is so mixed and so modeled towards say well is it white or is it black what is it it's a muddle it's a muddled thing to where it's very difficult we can read things and say oh black and white this is all this is what the law is this is exactly it and then look at a fact pattern and say all right now what are you gonna charge him with like why well i mean this is really cut and dry over here but the life living the facts the scenarios the things that unfold they're not always black and white they're not always very clear and very easy to see because there's a spirit at work the god of this world is blind to the minds the prince of the power of the earth now works causing disobedience and even causing people to walk after the course of this world i use those scriptures to emphasize that every single one of us are living in a complicated age where there's powers and forces that want to change your perception and your attitude in genesis chapter 3 verse 1 it says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and so it wasn't it wasn't him even stating the fact but he states it in a way to make it a question he didn't say god said you shouldn't eat of every tree of the garden because then there would have been maybe some affirmation from the woman that's right and and that's the end of it but yet there's something here that she has to respond to and what satan's trying to do is to defile her understanding so he says didn't god say you can't eat of every tree of the garden and you remember that his goal is to be like god so he's not just kind of innocently just saying hey i've been scratching my head this morning trying to figure this out he has an ambition he has a desire he has a goal he wants to be like god and he wants to use the woman to do that and so he poses a question now if we could somehow in our minds even transport ourselves back to that time in that day just to consider what it would have been like and then make application for ourselves today it's a question that seems innocent it's it's a question that you can say the sermon says i know that god gave you a commandment i know that he says you can't eat of every tree of the garden but which one was it and and what were those details but the serpent is trying to accomplish something and what the serpent is trying to accomplish is not harmless so the question may seem innocent but it's not an innocent question he's asked the question to kind of establish a basis upon which he wants to go forward and begin to have a conversation that moves her mind and her conviction from one place to another and so in asking the question he poses this well you have god said that you can't eat of every tree of the garden and remember i want you to hold this in your mind he's asking this deceitfully with an ambition and a motive to cause the woman to fall and the woman's answer is very clear we may eat of every fruit of the tree except for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil i mean she's very very clear about it but then he says in verse 4 because she says because if we eat of that tree we die so he's asked a question are you able to eat of every tree in the garden she answers it and says no we can't eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil because if we do we die and then in verse 4 he says you shall not surely die now we know this is a lie but it's more than just a lie it's a direct contradiction to what god had said and to what the woman understood when she says that we if we eat it we die she was not confused on that she wasn't confused on whether or not god had said it it was very simple and she simply believed it she was very simple towards the promise god said we'd die if we did it so i just believe that we won't that we'll die if we do so she just was simple towards the promise god said don't eat it or you die this is according to godly wisdom this was according to divine rationale it wasn't really open to debate he didn't say let's we're just spitballing here adam tell me what do you think should you be able to live if you eat this and what do you think about that no god had established it and there may have been some there's some divine wisdom to it to where well that doesn't make sense and this doesn't make sense and that doesn't make sense but that's where we sit today but then this was godly wisdom there's a divine rationale to it it wasn't subject to debate it wasn't they weren't able to get together in the garden and say well i just think this is ridiculous i think we should have a vote it shouldn't be like this no this was god's word he established it that way and this was what the woman was simple towards as paul said that you beguiled from the simplicity that is in christ it's the sublime simplicity to christ she just simply believed the word of god now he says in verse 5 he says ye shall not surely die this is in direct contradiction to what god had said to what the woman had promised and that is a lie but then he says for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall shall be as gods knowing good and evil so not only did he lie but now he's calling god a liar it would be one thing from a point of confusion and not sure and just uncertain that he just kind of takes a difference to what uh what has been established before he says you won't die and not only that god knows that when you do eat your eyes will be open you'll be as gods and you'll no good from evil and so he's not only lying about whether or not you die but now he is actually calling god a liar saying god doth no this is what he's setting forth but god said it very plainly in genesis 2 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die so let's take death and compare it to what the devil says your eyes are gonna be open you're gonna be because god's knowing good and evil you're gonna be godlike you're gonna have incomplete knowledge and god says no you're going to die he's contradicting what god had said by saying you're not going to die and now he's saying he also lied to you he told you you were going to die because he doesn't want you to know god is it's almost as if he's saying this god that you serve this god that you claim to be true this god that you said gave your word it was complex but it wasn't complicated but now at this very moment in genesis chapter 3 things get tangled things kind of get very very confusing if she's gonna accept what this serpent is saying that god told you you would die but the truth is you won't die and the reason why he told you you would die is because there's more for you there's something better there's a greater liberty there's a greater joy there's more wisdom and that belief in him is trying to keep you from it and at that moment the woman was i would have had a choice but she stops for a moment and she thinks to herself could that be true and that's all it took and that's why solomon and his wisdom i say that's why oh maybe that makes it sound like i've got it all figured out but when we read in ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 29 it's it just kind of forms as i mentioned wednesday night just this this kind of turning point which everything in this book of ecclesiastes can turn on this verse because the preacher the writer solomon's trying to make sense of the world he says all is vanity and when i saw everything and what it was i said you know what i'm going to gain as much as i can consume as much as i can enjoy as much as i can and he had a house with the pool with the rock band that came with it and and all the gardeners and all the pool guys and he had all the food and all the amenities he had everything he wanted and he said but it was all vanity and he says ah but i have wisdom and then he realized what happened to the fool happened to him and he said it's all vanity so he he's he's trying to figure out why are men consumed with life and always disappointed and always finding themselves with false expectations and broken dreams and why is everything vanity of vanities and he's bringing it down and then he makes this observation in chapter 7 verse 29 and it is so powerful he says lo this only have i found. now in the many one things that he says he's found and the things that he had discovered it's almost as if when you take everything it just fits within this headship everything else he says and this have i found and this have i found he's you could basically funnel it all back to this as solomon say i figured it out this is why he says that god hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventions satan excuse me solomon is attributing the vanity of life the frustrations of life on the fall he's going all the way back to the beginning he's looking at the end of the beginning and saying i know why it is this way in the beginning god made man in his image he made him pure he made him righteous he made him holy he made him singular he was not mixed with evil he had no doubt he had no other choices he had no other options but now having lost the holy image of god he's endlessly searching for fulfillment and cannot find it that's as if this it's as if there's a shadow in his spirit something's haunting him and he's trying to chase it down and he's trying to catch it and he's trying to figure it out as if that holy image of god though it left there still was some imprint in man that left him with a hunger and a thirst and a desire and he's trying to figure out ways to satisfy he's trying to figure out ways to quench it and he's endlessly searching for things but he can never find it as i pondered this verse and i looked at it and i looked at it and i looked at it i just i in reading it in the original in the hebrew and then the different translations and i i just took all these all these meanings that were being expressed in this verse and i i wrote it down this way so i just want to share it as i wrote it down solomon and i'm saying it from the perspective of solomon i discovered the fountain of all vanity and evil it is the original sin that has corrupted the nature of man god made adam and the woman without imperfection in likeness of his own desire and nature but the woman not content anymore with her present condition accepted a new way of making herself wise ever since all mankind is prone to forsake the order of god's word and has sought out new methods to attain fulfillment and happiness this is what solomon is looking at he's saying i i figured it out i've discovered that the reason why man is the way he is it goes back to the fall because god made the man in a particular way now that he's mixed he is no longer and when did the mixing start the woman was made to feel some sense of loss or fear of loss by the serpent and not being happy in her her state made accepted a new way of making herself wise and then ever since this is how mankind has lived it says god hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventions and we might read that and go oh my goodness i'm really enjoying a lot of these inventions i drove one to church today and i i'm using one now and i use this i love all these inventions but it's not just it's not inventions like you know thomas edison's getting called out but it's inventions and there's computations sought out many inventions opinions and judgments inventions is imaginations or valuations those they devised many different ways many different opinions many different belief systems confessions to resolve the vanity of life to try to give some sense and meaning to life to try to find some sense of satisfaction and what he's basically saying is man has invented a million ways to distract himself distracted from distraction by distraction i think is what one of the poets wrote that describes mankind because god made man upright but now they seek many computations and the word even even suggests and they meddle with endless questions god made man upright but why is man unhappy because he's constantly questioning it's constantly asking me god made man upright and off righteous and with no evil and unmixed and this is the man that he made and he could just be simple towards the promise and believe god's word and wait on him for wisdom but now mankind meddles with endless questions and this is how simplicity in the end the beginning was lost and how chaos was found is through the endless considerations the endless questions and all these questions only do one thing promote anxiety because you ask a question you can't seem to find the answer then it gives you it causes some sense of fear that oh maybe in the absence of an answer there's something bad that may be happening to me and so this the fall began with the question and then a lie you'll find in the new testament i think one person added it all up they said jesus 113 different times answers questions asked 25 different questions themselves the disciples asked dozens of questions but here in matthew chapter 22 verses 15 to 18 says then with the pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teach us the way of god and truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men now do you know what's happening here they're kind of grooming them a little bit kind of making them trying to see if they can't provoke his pride and we've got to be very careful when people come to us and they flatter us and you're a man of wisdom and and we're really in a bad situation we're just coming to you because we really need advice and we just want you to give us counsel on this because we can't think of a better counselor and they and and really they have a false motive and you got to be careful that through vanity and compliments and gifts that it doesn't defile your discernment and so they say tell us therefore what what think is that what do you think is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not but jesus perceived their wickedness thank god for discernment perception and he says why tempt ye me ye hypocrites now he perceived their wickedness what was their wickedness they wanted to entangle him so he used it they used flattery to begin with to try to disarm him to try to get him to think oh we're just we think you're amazing just tell us the truth and we'll believe it but they wanted him to say oh we'll give tribute to unto caesar or no no you don't need to give tribute to caesar to get him to be pushed into one side or the other to trap him in his talk and it caused him to get wrapped up in some polarizing issue of the day and instead he just kind of turns it on him and says well whose face is on that coin and they go well it's caesars and he goes well then if caesar's face is on it then give it to caesar and like oh well okay that didn't work and if you keep reading i think they try two at least two other times they come in waves trying to question him trying to trip him up trying to tempt him he says why tempt me he said because they recognized they were trying to entangle him and entangle means to ensnare or to entrap so was it an honest question did they really want to know whether or not they should give tribute were they asking because they wanted to pay their tithes they just weren't sure how much was that really what they were asking no it wasn't an honest question it was hypocritical because there was an impure motive he says you're hypocrites you don't even care about the answer you just want to use my answer against me you've already thought through this and you think regardless of how i answer say yes pay or don't pay you've got a way of putting me in a camp and running me down you've got a way of politicizing it and trying to do me harm and this is how that they approach jesus this is the world coming against jesus and what do you say hey if they hated me they'll hate you and we need to be fully aware that the world is dishonest that the world and society and media in in in forums and support groups and everything else that we can be a part of if they compose choices or describe scenarios and in doing so do it dishonestly and it's through this through suggestion and through scenarios and even in this particular situation where there was this dishonest question in order to entangle him or trap him this is how our behavior becomes influenced because many of the questions and choices that were posed today they're not honest we feel as if we're being asked the question perhaps for the other person to know where we stand or to make their decision or or because there's some kind of uh open agenda here and we're just being we're just discussing these things openly and we should be able to communicate but in reality there's some hidden influence even in sometimes an unstated motive or objective to get you to declare to say something or to make some kind of position or to even consider it well you ever thought of this and so society imposing questions they do it questions of morality of ethics and in doing so it causes us to wrestle with different things and there can be some real conundrums some real doozies to use a real educated word some real doozies when people ask us questions we're like whoa i never thought about that yeah and while you're thinking about it consider this did you know this this and they start giving all the details to it you're like i never thought of that i never thought of that i never thought of that and then immediately you're putting in this you're putting this quantity well what should i do how should i respond should i continue this way should i go that way does this mean that does this mean that have i been doing everything wrong my whole life and just whatever the scenarios it gets you to question and that's what the woman was in in the garden life had never been like that before she had it easy right to use another high dollar word easy peasy is that how we do it in a sophisticated way that's that was just it was so smooth i mean it was there was no aches and pains when they woke up in the morning there was no wonder did you check the weather today it was more like what weather do you want hun right i mean it was like everything they wanted it was perfect and now what the woman went through in genesis chapter three is what we go through every day on a constant basis and i want this to become uh the first building block of my foundation this morning the world is not innocent and it is in its lack of innocence there's motives and objectives behind everything there's influences behind everything and we can't just willy-nilly accept everything and engage in everything and embrace everything and think that we can do certain things and believe certain things and go certain places and enjoy certain pursuits and think that they're not without consequence i mean there's some real there's real consequences to the things that are in the world today that we have to be very careful and have wisdom and be wise as serpents and harmless as doves as we navigate this world because it is not an innocent world it's the kind of world that wants to take these young people that are sitting on these first few rows and take their innocence and their simple faith in the word of god and if you would ask them yes we believe and yes this is what we're supposed to do and yes this is right you say well how do you know it's right to do this how do you know you shouldn't do that they'd say well i don't know they're just very simple towards it though like it's in the bible right and it's in the bible what the devil wants to do is as they begin to enter into adolescence in their teenage years through circumstance and situations and relationships and hardships and pressures and entanglements get them to begin to lose their resolve that god's word is true and maybe there's just a lot of other ways out there to live happy and the world is not innocent and now the other building block of my foundation this morning is not only is the world not innocent but we don't have innocent hearts either i say that in the sense that there can be easily divided easily influenced in jeremiah chapter 17 verses 7 to 9 i we typically would read verse 9 but verses seven and eight kind of give the background for verse nine as comp i want to say competition that verse nine competes with seven and eight but seven and eight begin to describe what the man and the woman would have been in the garden blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope the lord is for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when heat cometh but her leaves shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit so the man that trusts in the lord and his hope is in the lord his tree is as if it's planted by the rivers of water the roots go down deep it receives nourishment and so it's going to bring forth fruit it's going to have a green leaf and when the heat comes it doesn't need to worry the very green leaves and healthy leaves will protect the roots and give it shape give shade so that it can continue to grow and then even in the year of drought it doesn't need to be anxious or or have anxiety or stress because it's still going to yield fruit the god had designed it in a particular way regardless of drought regardless of hot sun that if it's planted by the water and it's been nourished and it's got the appropriate root system and god's planted it and it's the seed coming forth just exactly the way that god designed it that when the heat comes the leaf is going to protect it when the drought comes it's going to yield fruit because the roots have its nourishment because of the protection of the leaves and everything's working together in concert and it doesn't have anything to worry about and verse nine you can say but the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it so we're trying to make this point the fall made simple mankind stopped trusting in the lord the woman stopped hoping in the lord and so verse 9 this deceitful heart and desperately wicked who can know it it's set as a contrast to this man who trusts and who hopes who's undivided in his affection towards christ who's singular towards the word of god i trust in you i hope in you i have no other trust i have no hope it's not i believe in god but i'm hoping for a stimulus check check or no check god's got my back right and that's exactly the way he's saying a man that trusts in the lord a man whose hope is in the lord look god's gonna see him through in the end but a man who's divided a man who's split who says he believes in god but acts contrary to it this is a man who's the product of a deceitful heart that's desperately wicked he says who can figure it out a deceitful heart it means insidious something that starts out real small but gradually what is it doing it's incrementally causing harm very sly if it's insidious it's sly it's slippery it's very subtle so our hearts aren't just pounding every morning we wake up there is no god you idiot i mean that's not what our heart is doing it's subtle it's slippery it's insidious something that just slowly building in in your heart it's insidious it's sly it's slippery deceitful heart and desperately wicked it just means it's sick it's something it's desperate and desperately wicked is just one word or conveying this it's just it's a sick heart that's desperate it's longing it's agonizing and it's with our heart that we perceive certain opportunities or we actually sent something looming on the horizon either something bad is going to happen or a good opportunity is coming and because we're looking out for certain things and we want certain things to happen and we're constantly analyzing and looking everything our heart begins to plot the course and tell us which way to go and how to act and how to and how to conduct ourselves and it's a desperate heart that's doing it and it's this is i want i i hope that i can express this in a way just to kind of make the point and then move on we trick ourselves it says the heart is desperately wicked and deceitful above all things we trick ourselves and and this is i could get every behavioral economics professor to vouch for this and and sociologists and pretty much anybody in academia has seen enough studies and to where this is a pretty strong theory that what we think will make us happy often doesn't make us happy so we imagine if we could just do this we'll be happy and then once we do this we're not happy so we begin to rationalize well then i've got to do this to be happy and we just get in this uh rat race of always trying to chase down this kind of fulfillment if we just turn the corner if we just do this we just do that i even said this morning i feel like i'm getting ready to turn the corner i'm going to get out of this rut and into a groove i'm finally gonna get caught up you know what monday's still waiting right i obviously just feel like if i could just get through sunday and then you know what i'm gonna be thinking mind if i could just get through wednesday i could i could start doing things i need to do and i gotta get caught up on this and we're just that way in our minds if i could just do this if i could just do that and god even asked the children of israel in isaiah 55 2 wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and for your labor for that which satisfies satisfies not why you spend money on things that really don't sustain your life why do you labor for things and spend your money on things and your time your thought and your energy and even your if you could call it free time your recreation why do you pursue things that at the end of the day really don't satisfy it's a great summary general summary of just the dissatisfaction of life the failed expectations in life all the failed promises of natural life wherein labor and pleasure alone is just vanity it's a very it's a sister verse to everything that uh solomon is saying in ecclesiastes and i'll make a couple statements here just make reference to a few things and move on from them and save it save it for wednesday night maybe humans are predictably irrational and that's what's very complicated is because we have certain things that is based upon rationale like a certain there's even in law the reasonable prudent person is is a person that only exists in law and so in law if you're sued for a tort or you've caused some injury and they sue you civilly your conduct is going to be measured by the reasonable prudent person and guess what the reasonable prudent person reads every single word of the terms of service when they buy a new ipad and what does that tell you the reasonable prudent person does not exist he's not out there but yet you're going to be judged by it and so since humans are predictably irrational what they mean by that is our behaviors sometimes lack for explanation like watch this he's going to do that watch this he's going to do that oh he didn't do that why in the world did he not do that and that's the way that we can our behaviors and our our motivations lack the proper explanation they don't have reason behind it and what happens is you could say well this is the way that it should be this is the way things should unfold but just one change in the scenario just the introduction of one variable just one component one thing being changed can completely upset our decisions and our emotions and all of a sudden we're no longer happy anymore you ever heard of the paradox of choice there's still some debate over about whether or not it would be a real valid theory but it certainly has some application and essentially the theory is this that when you when you make a choice the more options you have the more likely you're going to be unhappy with the choice you make so if there's only three colored three different flavors of snow cone you just pick one and you're happy but if there's 30 you pick one like i know i should've got tiger's blood you just know it because you don't like this one it's not what you thought it would be their pina colada stinks right and that and you and you'd be all tore up but if you only had tiger's blood pina colada and just cherry you would have got it and you've been happy but it's just the way the mind works i was gonna say this for wednesday night but i'll i'll try to i'll use this example just to just to show you how crazy our minds are you walk into a deli the guy working the counter and he says i like a sandwich he says we only have two sandwiches we got we got turkey and roast beef you go well i'll take the roast beef and also the guy from the back says oh we got ham he goes and then you say okay i'll have turkey that's exactly how the human mind works it's a very simple way to describe how that when you're given the choice between two things you want turkey or roast beef roast beef i love roast beef but then all of a sudden you're told there's ham and you don't wrote you don't want roast beef anymore you want turkey try to explain that and you say really yes really it works and that's just the way that it's just the way our minds are wired and they're still trying to figure that out to this day it's been decades since they've observed this behavior and studied it and done it over and over and over again and replicated this this uh this result they're like why do people think this way why do they act that way i'll come to it hopefully this morning but it's such a powerful force within our minds and here as we have said that we live in a chaotic world but now we have complicated hearts see not only is the world messed up but then our minds are unstable our minds are very complicated and so paul in writing to timothy in second timothy chapter two verses 3 and 4 he says thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that wareth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier just as they tried to entangle jesus to ensnare him or trap him paul is saying don't be entangled with the affairs of this life that means to plat or to braid to weave together don't be improperly twisted together and so woven to the affairs of this life that you're no longer serving christ as you ought to serve him life's affairs he's just talking about the cares and the concerns of natural living he's not saying that they should be disregarded but they shouldn't have preeminence and uses this image of a roman soldier who are these professional soldiers would have been forbidden to marry they were not allowed to engage in another trade or have some other way to be make a living because they were to be singly minded they gave themselves in defense and conquest and that's what they had to do and they didn't want them to be married so that when they're finally i got a wife and children at home i don't want to risk myself or i'm making more money here i want to preserve this fortune that he wanted them to be singular in their aim towards their kingdom and towards their their pharaoh their their caesar and likewise paul is saying that our aim or our goal is not to please man not to seek riches not to have comforts but rather to please christ we're not trying to make our lives easier we're not trying to accumulate wealth we just simply want to live to please christ and it's our divided minds our divided pursuits and our double minds that allow for all these worldly con concerns to consume us what do they do they tie us up they make us feel trapped he says be not entangled with the affairs of this life don't be woven together don't be so mixed together where you can't extricate yourself to where it has an influence to you there's a word that's used in the new testament about being entangled in the yoke of bondage and it implies that you're wearing it like a straight jacket and you're fighting against it and you're wrestling with it don't let the affairs of this life become something you're constantly wrestling with to where that becomes your singular pursuit there's so many different issues that we can kind of get sucked into and wrapped up in so many things that uh dominate our time and our our conversations and induce it only just creates tension and it only creates moral dilemmas and and questions of ethics and well what is the right thing to do and listen we're being brought into debates and thought processes that we don't even have to engage in there's things we're pondering things we're trying to figure out things we're trying to make sense of and the lord's saying you don't have to worry about that there's no reason you need to get caught up in that just keep doing what you're supposed to do live for me serve me follow my leadership don't get so consumed with those things later on in that chapter paul says it this way just to express why he should not be woven and planted and weave it together and twisted with all these different things he says in verse 23 but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes life is complex on its own but all the unnecessary distractions and decisions make it complicated those are the things that are complicated in our life not not the word not our simplicity towards the word there he says endure hardness so it's going to be suffering there's going to be affliction but the the complication comes with all these other things the foolish the and unlearned questions there's no wisdom in the question there's really no foundation in the word a foolish and unlearned question is useless there's really no point to it or no edification to it and he says it only leads to strife puts people at variance only causes contention and competition causes the quarreling or disputing with somebody else and even a variance within yourself and in doing so it robs us of peace this should be the theme of many people's thanksgiving dinner but foolish and unlearned questions avoid why because just the slightest thing could come up and all of a sudden everyone gets sucked into it if you know what people are mad at each other and leaving and flipping the table over and yelling at one another and it's like man just a moment ago we were all in tears i love you this is so awesome and then also you start debating something you start getting sucked into something and people get polarized very very quickly and you actually get put in is they tried to trap jesus and jesus basically you're trying to put me in a camp as soon as you put me here these people are going to try to hate me and as soon as you put me here these people are going to try to do it so he just kind of said why don't you look at the coin and tell me what you think and was able to do it in such a way where he could avoid to be that's the wisdom we need you could avoid being put in any kind of camp and what this questions and these arguments and these thoughts and all these scenarios that we begin to dream up ourselves maybe it's not even somebody asking us a question maybe we're just doing it to ourselves i wonder if how what about it robs us of our inner peace in john chapter 12 we'll start with verse two we read this in the beginning with our our text there that made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him then took mary a pound of ointment and spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment isn't that a beautiful picture wonderful picture considering how that just in chapter 11 her brother lazarus was raised from the dead that there had been this revelation break forth that not just will he rise in the resurrection but that christ is the resurrection and the life this was not just some man introduced well you know um you know mary well this is her son and you know that's the niece of elizabeth and and the in the cousin to john and it's like oh oh come on in let me let's make you some cheesesteaks it was it was like they knew this guy was this is the christ this is the messiah and there's this reverence and there's this worship that's due to him and it ought to have even been understood by any bystander like this guy just raised her brother from the dead you know let her let her worship i i don't understand it i'm not really you know i was kind of just one of those mourners that went along one of the jews that kind of went along just to see what was going to happen and so i understand where she's coming from i may not have the same unction or desire to do it but this was something that made sense even to the observer who knew what had just happened and she's pouring a pound of ointment of spikenard a pound does young living have spikenerd doterra has spikenard okay i'm changing camps oh young living good great i'm in both camps just look at the bottle whose bottle is it then render under the bottle's name a pound of spikenard and very costly this is not cheap oil i know the roads like the rose oil for young living is like 300 i mean that's that's expensive stuff i'm starting a rose garden and anointed the feet of jesus and it is so much oil the whole house could smell it somebody cook a spike nerd i mean it was everywhere and says then with this beautiful picture then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot you know simon's son the one that's going to betray christ he says why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence and given to the poor now this is the question let's go back to the beginning how the fall start with a question and what judas does in this scenario is he asked a question and asking the question he actually offers additional information but what is he doing he's questioning her actions he's questioning whether or not she should be worshiping jesus he's questioning how she's doing he's just questioning and he wants to offer more information as he asks the question and initially as i was pointed out our minds would not be divided by her expression of love and worship as christians today we just simply say she's worshiping jesus christ all worship is due to him there's no reason to question what she's doing even a critic could say hey to each his own she wants to worship his feet let her have at it right right i mean even a critic could say she's free to do whatever she wants it's her oil it's their house let her worship jesus as she wants but judas adds another dimension to it this was just worship of jesus christ who had just raised her brother lazarus he's come into their home they've received him she's pouring out oil she's pouring out and she's washing his feet and using her hair to do so and now he adds another dimension he's saying no don't you realize how extravagant this is and in order to bring the contrast he says do you realize the value of everything she he just she just poured out on his feet it's worth 300 pence i think he probably went on stockx real quick and say look it's going for 300 pence right now so we know we can sell this for 300 pence i just checked the futures on spikenard this thing is 300 pence and we could have sold it and taken the 300 pence and now notice how the rationale unfolds and if you recall we were using this in the when we we're preaching on who is thy neighbor he takes this rationale now and extends it this is how much it's worth and instead of them saying oh my goodness she poured out that upon our lord he says and we could have had a more prudent use of that in other words you know all you need is just a tablespoon of spikenet on the feet because the pores and the big toe are so big that it'll just right into your forehead as soon as it gets on your big toe and all you need is just a little bit all you need is just a little bit i'm not losing everybody who uses lavender oil now am i stay with me brother michael but all you need is a little bit to get the feet wet and we could have she could have just used a little bit sold the rest and use the rest for 300 pence and given it to the poor the weight of that is in other words we could have sold this pound of spider and supported a family for a whole year it was a whole year's living wage not just getting by not with food stamps and government help this was to live completely off of for a whole year and so it starts out as a very simple offer of worship and just an act of faith and just living for christ judas poses this question and now we have a moral quandary why should so much be given to jesus when it could be better spent after all it does say in the bible and it does say right this is the rationale jesus judas is supposing that hey i'm not questioning whether or not jesus deserves the spike nerd but that much that far that extreme shouldn't some moderation couldn't we used a different oil because really at the end of the day isn't it just a matter of doing it and just kind of getting it done it doesn't really matter how you're baptized doesn't matter how you do this it's just a matter of doing it this is kind of his attitude towards it but then he says so now we have this quandary why should so much be why should've done it couldn't we've had better spent this that's right to care for the widow and care for the poor and visit the fatherless this is what we ought to do this is religion this is what we're taught this would be a better use of the money but notice what you're being asked to do notice how sly and subtle it is and i love it john the writer verse six he he wants us to know in verse five verse four that this is the betrayer and i thank god he told us a little bit more about what was going on in judas's head this he said not because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was in the bag don't you love john judas asked the question not because he cared for the poor but because he wanted the money he saw an opportunity hmm and if she would just sold that we'd got 300 pence and that would have gone in the bag and i could have used what was in the bag john is exposing what's in judas's heart he didn't really really really care about the poor he didn't really really care about their economic status he didn't really care about whether or not they'd be taken care of but there was some kind of agenda some kind of lobby some kind of belief system some kind of motivation to him that he would particularly benefit by that's why i don't trust petition politicians on either side of the aisle there's a lot of the green policies that they support and we need to go green we go green but the effects of those policies are very very detrimental to the poor class and those on welfare and the minorities who need help who need infrastructure changes who need some attention there's things that need to be done on that and they'll lift this end up like we need to do this when you do this and then support other policies on the other that completely are anti-portal and contradict what they're trying to do on the other if you think what's motivating them to do that you think i'm just bashing on the levels don't get started on the republicans don't have time really for any of them but he says he does this because he wanted to take advantage of the exchange and so the discernment here gives us a motive helps us understand the motive and understanding the motive it gives context to the question and now that we know what's behind the question in reality you don't have to answer it you're not even obligated to answer it well just hear me out couldn't that be done and if you did this wouldn't it be better in the end once you know the motive you don't even know that oh an answer and that's what this is a question that did not need to be answered it's a blatant misuse of a fact to lead a person to a different thought or conviction could it sell for 300 pence yes it can google it it'll sell for 300 pence and then that fact is now used to try to get you in your mind to let go of what god of the worship that was being given to christ change your thought change your conviction and this is exactly the approach that satan took in the garden the exact same approach that he took he offered knowledge without context he he sold her a lie he used a question and then a lie and using that question and then that lie forcing her to answer to engage in the debate to gauge into the the the analysis and the conversation about it is all it took to cause her faith to drop enough to be defiled it was a choice she was presented a choice that she should have never had to ponder she was asked to consider something that she would have never she never needed to consider i mean she could have said just go ask my husband i mean it was just something she didn't even need to answer she said it's asked and answered serpent you know what god said this is what the word says and it was a misuse judas uses misuses the fact but when you get to the heart of the question it's not an honest question i i'm going to skip if you want to if you want to go to luke chapter 10 at the very end i'll just i'll just skip to this in because it offers us a different perspective of john chapter 12. because in john chapter 12 it's i said that's the world's question that's the world that confronts confronts us and tries to get us to reconsider and to ponder and shake us up and make us lose conviction and cause us confusion and complication but in luke chapter 10 verses 38 and we'll read to verse 42 it says now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village we know that this is bethany and a certain woman named martha received him into her house we know that lazarus sat with him at the table to commune with him and it said in john that mary served and she had a sister called mary excuse martha served and it was mary now it says and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word and martha was cumbered about much serving that means to be drawn away to be distracted she was driven about mentally she was over occupied to be cumbered about it was too busy she was too busy about a thing too preoccupied about a thing it was dominating her thoughts and so she was cumbered about much serving and johnny just says she was serving that didn't didn't seem ominous to us but now this writer and luke is wanting to understand that maybe she was too fixated on it she was too distracted by it she was too given into the domestic duties and the things that she needed to do as a host and it creates this conflict within her and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone don't you care that i'm the only one in the kitchen i'm the only one i'm hacking the lamb i'm the only one that's making the bread i'm the only one that's preparing the olives i'm the only one doing all these things it's me i'm all by myself and so she assumes that jesus can say yeah i care get in there mary he says bid her therefore that she helped me do you not care that my sister's not doing anything to help around the house would you tell her to help me with things around the house to do a better job domestically to pull her weight in the home and so she's asked a question now this the this question is interesting because it's not coming from judas it's coming from martha she's in the house she's one that's received them she's not she's not in the same uh if john was writing this he would have had good things probably to say more to say other than she i guess he was nice enough to not say she was comfortable she just said she's serving right but judas on the other hand we get the full picture he's the betrayer and he's a thief he doesn't really care about the poor he's just asking the question to cause conflict to gain himself a dishonest question for personal gain and now here's another question the same scenario the same house in the same narrative a question is asked do you care that my sister has left me to serve alone and there's something about this question that exposes something in martha's heart a disorder of priorities in asking the question it actually betrays something in her mind how she's divided in her mind the wrong kind of attitude because she's busy serving there's nothing wrong with serving but something in her heart wasn't right something in her in her mind was not right she was doing the right thing to serve but her service had become complicated she could no longer see that what she was doing was likewise for the one that was in the house it got complicated to where she wasn't doing it as unto the lord she needed her sister to come hell because now it was a chore and now it was a duty and now things had to get done and it was only important that it looked right and it felt right and everything was in perfectly in order and it's the whole instagram picture we're trying to create for our guest and it's this pressure and she's feeling the pressure and it wasn't wrong for her to do everything she was doing as john says marth absurd but now luke tells she's cumbered about what they're serving and it means her service had become very complicated it lost its focus and it even lost its purpose because she was no longer singularly focused and so jesus answers in verse 41 and said unto her martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things you're worried about so much you've got so much you're worried about that you're you're just you come to you stress out over everything you're worried about so many things that now i show up in your home and now you're worried about this it's not just the serving in the home but maybe it was something indicative of her whole heart martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful we could be troubled about many things we can be cumbered with serving but only one thing is needful and he says and mary have chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her mary chose the good part the good part was even questioned the length of the good part the breath of the good part the depth of the good part everything she did in giving of her oil and worshiping jesus and pouring all that oil upon her feet that was questioned that was ridiculed that was made fun of that was that was something that to them uh to judah said oh this is a waste this is too much but now even it's not the world just questioning now it's something within her family within even her with right there in their own home now there's somebody else questioning do you not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone i would rather put us in this spot now if there's any kind of correction or any way that you could be rebuked or or put on the right path i'm not fearful that you would be a judas but maybe we can be more martha-like we cumbered with too much serving and we've lost the real focus of everything we're doing and the real reason why we're doing it and when that happens we lose the focus everything begins to be confusing and it gets complicated real fast one thing is needful and mary have chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her i say we choose the good part not that we would leave the other undone but that we wouldn't leave this undone choose the good part give the do that is to christ to make him welcome in our homes one thing is needful so we read it wednesday night what's going to help there's only one thing needful get back to christ that's it it's the only thing that's going to satisfy it's the only way that marriages are going to work as efficiently and harmoniously as they can it's the only way that families are going to be in their proper place it's the only way they're going to be able to make sense of this life is when we have the word as our time post and our faith is projected to the word and that's our absolute that's the only way that the complications of this life are going to be resolved and our complex lives become complicated when we're distracted from christ and the woman in the beginning was pulled away from the tree of life how through a question and a lie and the tactics haven't changed ask a question pose a fact get us to wrestle with it become divided in our minds and then life gets complicated there's so many different issues that in our minds maybe we believe them to be very very cut and dry when i say issues i mean ones that uh don't even pertain to the word but if you really ever dove right down into it and tried to get your head around it and understand it you realize it is not as cut and dry as i thought it was the things that so polarize some people and they're in distinct camps once you really start unpacking the facts about it and the choices that it relates to and who it impacts and who's behind it and what the rationality is you realize wow they made it seem like it was just here's the devil over here and here's god over there which side do you choose like well i think i'm gonna side with god and then you start digging in and you're like no there's so much more to it than i was told and there's some things you just don't need to know some things you don't need to try to figure out some things you don't need to try to pursue and figure out which side you're going to be on which bumper sticker you're going to wear just don't get caught up in it and uh and to bring it back to what i feel is i've skipped a lot we're going to have plenty of time to get to this and if we don't that means we're going getting out of here like meeting in the air wrap up business here come back for the millennium that can be awesome that's what we're living for right that's what we're not we're not here to try to figure out how this church can be here in another hundred years we want to preach the word in such a way to we we're accelerating the timeline we're doing everything we can we're putting our shoulder to the wheel to all the other churches that are preaching this gospel getting behind the word of god lifting up jesus christ that it can draw men unto him so that we can get out of here not preaching just to build a church that has a legacy uh hundreds of years from now and find the right corner to build a big building on but no we want to get out of this world we want a translation and so to try to bring this into the context of what we are ministering even on the family in mentioning family and relationships and our relationships to one another and our marriages and raising our children i'm you i'm wanting just to set the give you the context that this is the world and this is the climate that we're raising our families in that if this was little house on the prairie i mean the preacher would be complicating it right all you got to worry about is that one blond-haired girl that was the bully and all you got to worry about is the indians on the other side of the hill and you'd be able to just figure out who the the nemesis are and and who the kids you need to worry about and you knew winter was coming and it would seem like this is a complex life but it's simple we've got to figure out we don't live in that day anymore we're raising children in a time when it's you can't keep the world away there was a time that you could raise children in truth you could raise them in in the light of this message and the circle of your fellowship and those you rub shoulders with and and the things that you're influenced by you could just kind of keep it this balance within your social life this balance within your professional life a balance within home life and even with respect to school christian camps and different things that you could participate in and there was just a way that you could walk seemingly free from all the influences and the nastiness and the perversions of this world but now it's everywhere that there's no distance from it there's no separation and and the world is ferocious anymore we kind of feel a little bit shy about what we believe because we don't want to be the next viral phenomenon guess what this person believes go ahead tell me hon what do you believe tell the camera this is going on tick tock right that this is this is kind of pressure that we live under anymore and it's just suffocating it's all around us i want you to realize that if that this is the world we're living in this is the time that we're living as it relates to laodicea but don't forget we are living in a bright age those who love laodicea those who want laodicea they can have laodicea i've got my bright age i've got this time in my life where i'm being united to the word of god i'm being guided by his holy spirit i'm looking at a promise we've got the the power of god amongst us we've got the the gifts of the spirit the the the promises of the word of god these are the things that we believe in this is what we live by but i'm reminding you we live in a nasty evil world it's important for us to realize that god gave us the world the word to navigate the age we're living in and there's this story of mary and martha to me presents such a wonderful context for how the world on one end begins to attack us but it does it dishonestly to cause us to shake in our minds to get us worried to cause us doubt doubt and fear and that's what creeped into the woman in the beginning was doubt that was how that's how satan motivates through fear and that's what dominated her thinking immediately she was fearful what did she get fearful of that she was missing out what caused the woman that the fear of regret well if i don't then maybe i'm going to be missing out on something if i don't i may regret it it's all it took to cause her to act is to be pulled away from the tree of life by questioning a lie if you go back to the quote before brother john in the trial like to end with this brother mike if you could come in the sermon of trial he puts on trial the prosecutor which is the devil puts on trial though the word and he brings mr impatient mr skeptic and mr unbeliever mr unbeliever testifies i don't believe it mr impatient you know won't wait long enough and the skeptic yeah is not sure if that's really what was supposed to happen but notice what he says now it came to pass excuse me satan did not the prosecutor did not misinterpret the whole thing he just misinterpreted a word or so and it caused death to strike the whole earth and every hospital every siren ever rung every death ever died every struggle every man on the battlefield every poor little sick afflicted baby and all was caused by disbelieving just one word of god's word i mean the sentence could have been much longer but think about everything we wrestle with today all the considerations all the pains all the problems all the circumstances all the scenarios all the moral dilemmas all the ethical quandaries all these things that be presented to us it all happened because one word was disbelieved the complicated life we live in this ferocious lail to see in age this wicked ridiculous age we live in what is it it is the result of one word being disbelieved i i know that may seem hard for some people to really accept but that's just the reality of it caused by disbelieving just one word of god's word and if it caused all of this for disbelieving one word how are you going to get back disbelieving one word it was how are you going to get back to the beginning by disbelieving one word and we're not going to press rewind because to press rewind we have to go through all the sickness every death on the battlefield every siren wrong every death but we just take the opposite this is something we have to learn to do as believers what he's saying here is everything that exists in the world today that's bad that's negative that's detrimental that tears us down that confuses us that causes the anxiety and the depression all these things they all were caused by disbelieving one word this complicated life is the result of disbelieving one word so what's the way to resolve the the complications believe the word believe the word that's your way back to simplicity you don't have to figure out the the labyrinth that is all these things that brother brown's just talking about all these things that are masked together how do we make sense of hospitals we have decisions now that we have to make that you would have never had to make before should i get a heart transplant well if you don't get a heart transplant you're going to die well who am i going to get the heart from whose heart am i going to be putting in me what kind of life did they live did they smoke did they stay faithful to their wife i mean that's a real that's a terrible dis place to be in where you really really need a heart transplant and you you have the moral dilemma now should i even get one because i don't know what's going on in this this other guy's heart who it was that died and what kind of impact this could have upon me but do you realize science has put you in a place now where that's a decision you have to make could you imagine you know talking about this with somebody from the 1700s yeah i just don't know whether i should get a heart transplant like what is that what does that even mean just drill a hole in your head you'll be all right it's this is we live in an age where now across the board there's only so many things we have to consider so many things we have to try to figure out it's but he's made it easy for us only believe that's where we start only believe if you're wrestling with worldliness take him by at his word give your heart to him this word is true this word is the joy you've been searching for it's the acceptance you've been longing for it's the place where you belong it's the place where you finally can let relax and say you know what i found home i found where i belong this this is this is living and you can do that as a young person you could do that somebody who's later in life wherever you are only believe that's the promise take him at his word and believe if one word disbelieve brought all the confusion the chaos we see today it's believing that it'll make sense of it and bring us back to simplicity let's stand to our feet this morning let's bow our heads in a word of prayer i appreciate your attentiveness still might have been too cold for some too hot for others still trying to get used to a new building i know it was a lengthy lengthy subject matter probably a little bit dry but at the close here one thing is needful that's what i want to challenge you with is to take him at his word and just trust him just believe him i trust that god has been able to wake open your eyes to the dishonest influences that are in our lives the things that prey on us and take advantage of us because we're vulnerable or ask the questions and try to explore our hearts and our minds and present us with scenarios and questions that cause the dilemma say oh god give us discernment like christ had to say you hypocrite why would why why do you tempt me and in his presence today if you would want god to help you just lift your hand to him and say lord i'm just requesting help let us pray our heavenly father your word is perfect it's without offense to the believer your word is complete it needs no amending lord you have made it so simple but we're the ones that complicate it and lord i i'm impressed at my own life to come back to the principle of taking you at your word and believe in you and trust in you and living simply by the revelation that this word is true and living by the revelation that christ is alive in my heart and that in serving you it gives me purpose and it it takes complexes and bitterness and it resolves them lord that's my prayer for those that have gathered here this afternoon as that we could come into an understanding together that one thing is needful and it's to serve you and lord serving you does not mean we lay down our domestic responsibilities nor does it mean that we forsake the duties that we have as spouse and parent the lord serving you gives real meaning and purpose direction to those offices but it gives me a standard to pursue it gives me something to aim for lord i'm not just merely satisfied being married and loving my wife but i want to love her like christ loves the church lord i'm not satisfied in disciplining my children and and setting rules and trying to guide them but i want to do it without provoking them to anger i want to do it in a way that's loving i want to do it in a way that's edifying and builds them up so lord it gives me purpose it gives me it gives me something to to aim for and to desire to become and to be and it's fulfilling lord to walk in your word and i pray lord that for the the young people here today the young adults and those in the time of life or they're trying still trying to find their way and where they're going to be what they're going to study what kind of job they're going to have where they're going to live and all these different things and even the devil through other relationships and circumstances trying to cause confusion about their own identity and trying to cause confusion about how they where whether they belong and what they believe lord may you come to their defense right now lord come to their aid defend them now lord in their weakness and their vulnerability and have mercy on them lord we know that our young people in certain times of life the their minds are just racing to be satisfied to be accepted to be socially active to uh to feel the the pleasure of of entertainment and lord there's it can be so chaotic and confusing lord may you give them the mind of christ through a new birth experience that can lead them through these years that can raise them to be wonderful god-fearing young people help us lord in our journey wherever we may be lord i can say this so confidently no matter where we are in our relationship with you we are looking to you none is looking any higher none is looking any better lord we're looking to you for you are the one thing needful may we come back to that if we've lost it may this be the foundation upon which this church is built may it be the foundation upon which marriages are built and maybe upon this foundation that our relationships with one another is cultivated forsaken all our special confessions and coming to and holding two and giving attention to the revealed word which belongs to us all i pray that you bless the people here today who lifted hands whose hearts have been raised parents with special anxieties children with fears families with questions may you come to their side this day comfort them may they be reminded of the promise that you'll never leave them nor forsake them it's a crazy world lord we feel like our hearts are chaos but we come to you the mender the healer the dissolver of doubts and we say here i am take me and take me from here lord i commit myself to you all that i am i give my heart to you take me now lord into a place of peace in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray amen
