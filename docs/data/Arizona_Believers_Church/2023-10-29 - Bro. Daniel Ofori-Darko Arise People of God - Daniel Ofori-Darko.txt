TRANSCRIPT
========================================
on this topic arise people of God Arise people of God we know that creation of this world remain it a mystery hallelujah how many of you believe that oh yes it's a mystery it's a mystery in the sense that here we are now I think the time is a little after 10:00 is but when you go to Africa right now it's getting to the evening and when you go to Australia you can imagine the time that they are in now so it happens that whil some are sleeping and snoring others are working when others are sleeping others are eating you know and you cannot determine how God was able to do it that way so it remains mystery Hallelujah and uh he gave the day for us to work and he gave the night for us to sleep amen so therefore sleeping is normal is that not it sleeping is normal and everybody love to sleep in fact when when you are you are feeling sleep sleeping sometime and uh at the same time you are trying to do something is not comfortable at all is that it yeah you you realize that you are torturing yourself until you you've been working and you'll be dozing off which is very dangerous amen there are some medication even the doctors will give you will give to you sometime and they will tell you that when you take it don't drive because if you dare take it and you drive you may wreck your car because you you be you do off Hallelujah so so sleeping is normal but there is time for everything amen you sleep and you wake up that is why sometime when we we need time to do something we have to set our alarms well so that when the time comes it will you know awake us automatically even your time your your alarm don't want you to sleep your your alarm don't want you to sleep so that is why it will wake you up and get you up sleeping is noral as I've already said but oversleeping is what not is good amen over sleeping is what is not good but sleeping God added it to human nature amen so you see we have the physical sleeping and we have spiritual sleeping okay now Isaiah was not calling us to wake up physically but he was calling us to wake up spiritually you see when you are sleeping physically on naturally there's nothing wrong right but when you are sleeping spiritually that is where the danger is amen and amen so this morning I don't want to see anybody sleeping in the church right because he is calling us to rise from our sleep and when the prophet or when the word of God is calling you to rise it is calling you into a Revival yes because nobody will be in a Revival and be dozing of no is it's impossible a soldier who is ready for battle do you think he will feel Slumber no no no no no no no he will not and so that is what the prophet Isaiah was calling the people of God to be amen now look at it this way he say awake awake put on thy strength oh Zion and the prophet said that any place that you read in the Bible put yourself in there so now he not talking to Zion but he's talking to you and I Hallelujah he said put on thy beautiful garment oh Jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into Thee the uncircumcised and the unclean and remember that the uncircum the uncircumcised and unclean is the Antichrist okay he said Shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down Shake sh yourself from the dust what is the dust that the prophet is talking about the Dust of unbelief yeah right the dust of worldliness the dust of Doubt of God's word hallelujah the dust of the things the idea of human being that always take the word of God completely from the people it say shake yourself from that dust Hallelujah and sit down oh Jerusalem lose thyself from the bands of thy neck oh captive Daughter of Zion for thus sayeth the Lord ye have sold yourself for nothing and ye shall be redeem without money we sold ourselves to the taals of the world because David said in sin did my mother conceive to me I was Sheed in iniquity there was nothing good in me so automatically I was born into this world a sinner Hallelujah we sold ourselves for nothing and brother sister you agree with me that anything that the devil use man to accomplish you don't gain anything out of it prepare you for punishment anything the devil uses us or anything the devil used Us in the world to do we benefited nothing so that is why the prophet is saying that we sold ourselves for nothing but we have been redeemed without money amen oh brother brother our Salvation we didn't pay any dollar for it our Salvation we didn't exchange anything for it Hallelujah we were Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ free of charge amen last Sunday we were saying that he knew us before the foundation of the world and for that matter he had already prepared our Salvation it is not that today that God is thinking how he is going to save you he had already done that already praise be the name of our God so we are redeemed without money Hallelujah now we know that Redemption was under the seals in fact we were born into so many churches so many denominations we were even baptized we grew up as Christians so called and we were attending church you know regularly until we we thought that oh we were close to heaven right we thought that if Jesus Christ came today we are going to go with him we didn't know that we have were born into error right until we came face to face with the message of this hour and what is the message of the hour the message of our is not just as what you see but there was a mystery that was hidden before the foundation of the world and God's word says that when the seven angels begin to sound those Mysteries that was Kept Secret will be made known that's right and brother when we came face to face with that that is what made us to realize what Christianity is about had it not been the Revelation that you and us you and I have brother would have remained over there at the other side amen so we see that Redemption was under the seals and the bible say that the uncircumcised will no longer come and run it yes because now you have the truth now you know who Jesus is nobody can Chop God into three pieces and give it to you you will not accept that it was a mystery until today it still remain a mystery in the minds of people in the heart of people they don't even know the god that they are worshiping they're still thinking that God is an old man sitting somewhere and his son Jesus Christ on his right hand and the Holy Ghost also moving somewhere that is what people are believing it is a mystery brother sister for you to know the God that you are worshiping and thank God when the seals were open you and I we have come to the knowledge of the truth amen and he said when it happen like this the circumstance will no longer come around that because your faith is sealed amen with the truth and when you have that truth it is very difficult for you to be deceived no way nothing can deceive you again nothing can turn you your because you eyes are now open to the truth hallelujah amen amen and amen and he said the Antichrist will no longer come around you the world system we believe that was injected into the church to defile her and somebody may think that oh it was it was after the apostles No it started in the garden of aeden that is the thing that the devil always does the devil cannot change the word of God God but the devil can cause you to disbelieve the word of God that is why he either add something to it or he will take a portion out of it and that is what he did in the Garden of Eden to defile the human race right and in this end time Satan is still doing that right Hallelujah and by so doing he's he has managed to sway a lot of people into error right but there is something that I to share with you which is in the Bible Jesus said that the elect cannot be deceived and so if you are part of the elect I am assuring you this morning that nothing can shake your faith amen amen I love the song that the family sang he say I have made my mind up to go God's way Hallelujah and that is what we have done after the seals were open and we know whom God is we know what we are worshiping we know the promises of God that nobody can take it from our hands we made our minds up to go God's way Hallelujah you know when people allow themselves to be swayed by the enemy when the people allow themselves to be influenced by the enemy and they didn't believe God's word in their time they all all died and they went to hell but you see what the love of God is the bible say that when Christ died on the cross he went to preach to the souls that were in prison he went to cause an Awakening over there because by that time the blood of Jesus Christ had never yet been shared so Believers and you know unbelievers all of them died and they go to the same place right but when Christ came down to accomplish the purpose of God for you and I our Salvation before the foundation of the world and he show it openly on Mount Calvary and he screamed that it is finished and he gave up the ghost the bible say that he went to the region of the lost to preach the gospel there to bring his people out and you imagine do you know what happened there that day in hell when Christ entered over there and the people were all there all the people that has gone by they were all there but there was something that happened everybody that God dealt with it was time for their salvation right any person that believe on God that was at the place it was time for them to come out right so Jesus went there to cause an Awakening they were all sleeping in hell and Jesus said that this is not the time of be here it's time of getting out from here and so he called his people call them one by one he mentioned their names one by one this one will say yes I can recognize this this Voice Hallelujah Jesus look at Abraham he said Abraham come on come over here this is not your place he look to Isaac he said Isaac this is not your place come over here come and follow me Hallelujah and they were following him little by he was calling them all amen he will see Daniel and Daniel will look at his face he will mention Daniel Daniel said no this is the man that I met over there when they thre me into the lion Z the angel that came to to to to I mean to close the mouth of the Lions this is the man oh praise be the name of our God and so the Bible says that when he was resurrecting that day he resurrected with all these people he brought them out from hell why because that place was not prepared for them hell was prepared for Satan and his followers not the people of God so God brought his people out so if you read the account carefully he said the day of Resurrection they saw the Old Saint also resurrected and they walk on the street of Jerusalem the day of Resurrection hallelujah how much more we are that are living today yes we must also be resurrected yes from our unbelief yes we must be resurrected from our doubt we must be resurrected from the things that goes contrary so long as God's word is concerned because God have prepared a place for us amen he said arise and Shake yourself from the dust arise and Shake Yourself from unbelief arise and Shake yourself from the sin of this world and sit sit where you sit in the word of God you sit on the revelation of God but when you sit with the word of God brother storm make wind May blow storm may blow but your Anchor Holds within the veil there is nothing that can shake your faith because you are sitting on the word of God Hallelujah there must be an Awakening in you brother sister if there is nothing like that then you must think again something must Shake any unbelief out something must keep you on fire something should make you arise from your sleeping and your Slumber right because it is time of preparation of meeting the Lord God our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen one time when Mary Magdalene when that woman met Jesus Christ the prophet said that there were about nine or seven demons in that woman but when she came face to face with Jesus Christ something happened to her there was an Awakening That Shook all those demons out Hallelujah and today if we come face to face with Jesus Christ that same thing can happen to us amen it may not be demons but it may be something that is taking our concentrations away and when we meet Jesus Christ brother everything must be settled Hallelujah one time when Peter and the rest were at the shore remember that Jesus Christ went there and Jesus pleaded with Peter he said Peter will I will you let me use your canoon for a moment he said why not go ahead and Jesus climbed it and he started preaching to the people he preached the word of life to the people they rejoiced now after Jesus didn't call for any other call but rather he told Peter he said Peter now go a little further and cast your net now who told Jesus Christ that Peter was looking for fish who told Jesus that Peter have come all the place that previous night and they didn't catch anything so he by thec he said you go a little further and cast your net there and Peter said Lord throughout the night we've come all the place we didn't catch a thing right but according to your word oh Hallelujah let it always be according to your word that's right and when he went and threw the cast The Net over there brother you know the story he has to call for his brothers to come and help them pull the net because they had abundant of fish over there it was amazing it was just Jesus Christ was just letting Peter know that there is a way that you can cause an Awakening in yourself yes Peter look at Jesus said Master depart from me depart from me I am a sinner this thing that you have done tells me something depart from me I don't want to defile you Jesus said don't be afraid from now on you not be fishes you not cat fish again but you be fishes of men and from that day Peter started his missionary work by going to place preaching to people and all over the place believing people coming all over the place to believe Jesus Christ brother sister perhaps today's you and I our 10 we have to allow something to happen to us we must have some experience in fact we have to feel that God have a work for us to do by going out telling people about the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ look the prophet said something and sometime we take it light he said if the last bright member don't come to believe the message the Rapture will still be waiting have you ever heard that before he said if the last bright member don't come into the fold the Rapture will not go because we are not going to leave any child of God here hallelujah brother sister so what about but if the last bride member is hiding somewhere in finish and we are not going out we are not inviting we are not persuading the people we are not telling the people about Jesus Christ how are we going to come how is going to be that the Rapture will take place the last bride member is hiding in finish here I may not know you may not know that is why all over the place we have to cast the net like how how Peter cast it let us cast the net like how Peter cast it and let us pull when we pull though it will bring abundant of fish but the Lord God knows how to do the selection we don't do selection but he himself does The Selection our duty is to cast the net and pull the fish amen and amen let me read something quickly from this message he said discernment okay Discerning body of the Lord he said we can't discern by what people think what intellectuals tell us what Psychiatry tells us he said we got to go by what God says he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God hallelujah that is what the instruction is we should not leave by bread alone no no not by Pizza not by hamburger alone Hallelujah not by sandwich alone B by the word of God right every time every day in our lives we must feed on God's word amen he says not Discerning the Lost body many are weakly and sick many are asleep dead spiritually dead he said the last plague that hit Egypt was death and the last plague that hit the church he said the last plague that that hit the church is spiritual death what we need today is a spiritual awakening Hallelujah A Spiritual Awakening to what discernment yes amen we ought to be able to descend the two spirits that are awaking now am the spirit of deception and the spirit of the Lord God which of course leaders into all truth amen and amen you see when you become idle okay you automatically do off yes when you become Idol you will automatically do off that is the reason why we must always make sure that we are sharing our Cutlas I don't know what the Cutlas you have do you you know what Atlas is yes sword that's right what good will it do you when you have a sword that is not sharp right what good will it do that is why well I will use home experience I don't know of America America when you are farming you do you use mechan mechanized f is that we use Manpower and every farmer has a Cass and there is a stone okay that they Shar their knives on not not machine no but Stone yeah and remember that stone represent Revelation so they sharp every time they sharp it always they make sure that it is very sharp and no farmer will go to the bush without a sharpen Cutlass and when not bringing into our our spiritual way we have also source which is the word of God in our heart and always we must make sure that it is sharpened that when we take it it cut both here and both here because when it become idle it will be dead Hallelujah that is the reason why look when this brothers cleopas and his friend remember after the resurrection of Jesus Christ you remember that they were doubting about the resurrection can we imagine brother sister Jesus Christ that walked with this people he fed them with so many good things he gave them power to even overcome evil spirits they came back with testimonies and the Lord was rejoicing with them and even told them that don't Rejoice that demons are made subject to you but Rejoice because your names are written in heaven amen and he told them about his death his burial and resurrection that the third day he will rise again now these people were in the church they had all this Jesus told them but just three days they forgot about that right so that means they were in a church their assault were dead we don't have to be in that experience we have to make make sure that our our Cutlas or our sword is always sharpened very sharp of course ready to cut both here and there and the Bible says that when the woman went to the supper and they found out that the the tomb was empty they came back with they knew that the Lord is risen Buton they said the Lord is risen but the disciples doubted it why would they doubt it because spiritually they were sleeping yeah am and they argue among themselves some were doubting some were asking questions they didn't know what to do whether to accept what the women were telling them or not until cleopas and his friend decided to go back to where they came from and the Bible says that when they were going by the way they were contemplating they were discussing about this thing that has happened then all of a sudden Jesus walked with them actually they were talking about Jesus Christ right and you know the good part of it is that when you talk about Jesus Christ every place Jesus will walk with you right it is better brother sister to talk about Jesus Christ in your homes in your schools at your work places that you talk about this things that is going on in this world when when cleopas and his friend was talking about Jesus immediately Christ walked with them and Christ ask them a question what are you thinking about what are you discussing and you look so sorrowful and they asked Jesus are you a stranger in this land can you imagine this sharp question they asked Jesus are you a stranger in fin that you don't know what has happened this last three days well there's a man that called Jesus Christ they didn't even say that our Master they said there a man called Jesus who who have done so many tremendous Miracles and we are you know testimony of those things but he died and well he was buried and some of our company have come to tell us that he risen and that is why we are so confused and we don't know what to do Jesus Christ look at them and say you are fools because they were sleeping they were spiritually sleeping he look at them and say you are fools and the bible say that then Jesus Christ took the word from them and now begin to explain to them he preached to them he told them about himself and what will happen to him and all that he told them at first the Bible says that whilst he was talking there was something that was dropping in your heart but their eyes were still holding that they will know him right so when they got to the village where they were going Jesus Christ told them well if you are coming to finish I am going to continue to flax house they said no master don't go it is night it's late there is Danger on the way come and pass the night with us so that in the morning you can continue your journey and Jesus oblig you know what happened when they went in to the house food was ready and you know that every man like food Every Woman like food every child like food because food was made for man after all the day walking from Jerusalem to that Village they were hungry so when the food was ready they were so happy and they invited Jesus Christ to bless the food yes a stranger that you didn't know yeah how come that they will invite Jesus to bless the food yes because of what came out from him they realize that this man is not an ordinary man so if he bless our food we'll be blessed and the bible say that then Jesus Christ took the food and bless it the old way as he used to do when he was with them and when they said amen their eyes were open yes to know that this is the master and then he vanished from among them amen but brother sister this were the same people who were telling Jesus Christ few minutes ago that it was late that it should not go on the journey but when their eyes were open the Bible says that they forgot about the dangers on the road at that night and they ran back to Jerusalem Hallelujah what was that there was an Awakening that has set into their system Hallelujah when you come face to face with Jesus Christ brother you cannot remain the same something must happen to you you must got an experience you cannot see the same way you must Shake yourself from the dust and they ran from that Village back to Jerusalem and they told the disciples hey it is true the master is indeed resen and he has appeared to us oh brother sister will you make that experience come into your life that you not be so much touchy you not be so much cold but you be on [Applause] fire arise that is what the prophet is talking about we should be arised from our weakness we should arise from our Slumber we should arise from our laziness we should arise and Shake ourselves and sit in the word of God Amen and amen the prophet made us to understand that there's no Revival anywhere again look if anybody will tell you that there's a Revival coming again forget about it yeah he said the only Revival that is left is in the Bride of Jesus Christ and you are part of the bride and I'm part out of it so when we are talking about Revival we are talking about the bride's Revival that is why nothing shakes us am that is why our faith is holding that is why we cannot doubt the revelation of the word amen because we have shaken ourself from unbelief amen amen and amen now he says sometimes it's funny well I don't know about about finish year sometimes back home braon you see a big banner of this picosas and they are inviting people for programs and they will write Revival Revival Revival super anointed Holy Ghost Revival and then you you see it and you laugh Revival what kind of Revival are you talking about yeah come on Revival when women have painted their faces and they put on artificial fingernails like that of tiger you said Revival Revival when women are wearing pants and they are standing on their High HS yeah oh brother you talking about Revival do you know what Revival is oh Hallelujah there is no Revival anywhere if you want to see Revival it's in you the Bride of Jesus Christ that is what the Rival is amen and amen and as we sit like this we are preparing ourselves for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and what is going to make that it is the message of the hour that you have believed that is what God has pushed the power of God into you amen that is our power that is our strength amen and the prophet said that any place that the message of this hour will be preached like how we are preaching today amen he said the pillar of fire will be hanging there and that is what give us confidence am that we are not a people without hope we are a people with Blessed Assurance oh brother you can shout amen if you want yes sir he says the great Pentecostal Revival is now seizing this was said in 1961 but today we can say it has ceased he said we see it everywhere the last great move the message has gone forth everything is ready now waiting the church is sealed away the wicked are doing more wicked churches are becoming more churchy right the Saints are coming closer to God yes the gift of the spirit are beginning to multiply in the little groups oh we are at the end time Hallelujah he said we are at the end time yes sir churches are becoming churchy denominations are producing more denominations huh Pentecostal are producing more Pentecostals the atho churches are producing more churches and the blood of Jesus Christ we are gathering we are gathering Hallelujah the atmosphere is pushing us to gather and wait for the coming of our God Amen he said the prophet said that there's no Revival anywhere thank God in 1963 when the seals were open my I don't know whether you have caught that experience before he said when there's mystery were being open to him he will shout he will scream and sometime he wonder whether it will not disturb the neighbors around right right Hallelujah because this message of this hour is a message of fire am it's a message of fire amen it is Jesus Christ himself that reveal himself listen he said he owned my body that's what the prophet said he say Jesus owned my body and he entered into my body to do his perfect work so this ministry that we are holding on is the ministry of Jesus Christ himself brother what what what kind of people we ought to be we have to Rejoice always we have to give thanks to God always for what he has made us to be it is not something that we went to school to learn no no no no University can produce this right no Seminary can give us the holy SP Spirit but the message the word of God that is revealed that is what has made us what we are today amen and amen amen and amen now he says remember remember God was in the boat God was in the storm and God was in the fish how do you calculate that let me repeat it he said God was in the storm God was in the fish and God was in the boat I hope you've got the answer now it's in the Bible Hallelujah you remember when God called uh what's the man's name Jonah yeah Jonah go to nineve and go and proclaim the go Elizabeth you remember that Jonah said what for what God you want me go to n no I'll not go to n I'm not ready to go to n a man having his own will yeah instead of being a will of God this have not told you this I pray to the Lord I said Lord if this is the time you want me to come to Arizona let brother respond to me if it is your will so the moment brother responded to me I said well then that means God has answered the prayer so therefore it's not longer my will but it's God's will right and brother sometimes Christians we find it difficult to ask God let your will be done look do never do never think that your will as you are your will will be something good for you that's if there is anything good that can come to you it must be the will of God right so please do not hesitate at any time to say God let your will be done oh Father I need this organ in the name of Jesus Christ Lord I claim it you claim it have you asked God whether it is your will you claim it continue to claim it sometime you claim something that does not belong to you come on Hallelujah let us say God let your will be done in our lives and when the will of God come into your life brother you go with confidence there is no danger on the way Hallelujah and and this man Jonas say no no no no God I'm not going to n rather I know how your prees can be if I don't get up from your presence you will continue to distur me go to go to so I'm now going I'm going to run away to passes and the Bible that he bought tickets to go to tashes and in the boat oh my that is what the prophet said that God was in the storm God threw a problem Into the Storm and you know it started shaking here and there and the boat was turning up and down like this and like that and everybody was praying that hey what an experience we have never experienced this thing before what is going on on so they started praying everybody was calling on the God and the ship master was going up and down and lo and behold there was a man that was sleeping he doesn't even know what has happen or what is happening he was snoring [Music] seriously then he went and tap him amen get up and pray call on your God perhaps he will answer you and all of us will be saved and you know what Jonah indeed arose and you look at the storm and you look at the face of the ship Master he said Master don't disturb yourself this thing is happening because of me what you making such a confession what do you know about this storm that you making such a statement do you have any secret that we don't know he say yes I am a servant of God God have sent me for an aan and I'm refusing to to go that is why this thing is happening to you so what should we do Jonah said well you may disagree with Jonah but there was nothing he could do Jonah told the man before you be free bind me and throw me into the water can you imagine the the ship master was thinking that the man was not correct he was thinking that he has gone crazy we should throw you into the sea he said that is the only thing that can save you if you want to be saved do that and they bound this man and indeed they threw him into the water the moment his skin touched the water the storm ceased right what what an amazing experience and you know what when they were saved like that what was happening to Jonah Jonah was sinking perhaps he he didn't he he didn't even know how to swim like how I don't know how to swim so I don't play around water Jonah was thinking but lo and behold the prophet that God was in the fish yes God have already prepared a natural submarine Jonah was the first man to experience submarine that was not made by the hand of a man but God himself oh Hallelujah and Jonah realiz that this was a fish that has opened it mouth for him yeah and he entered into it and the door was closed yes but you see the bible say that when Solomon dedicated the building and he said Lord wherever your children will be when they are in any situation that is not so good for them to enjoy when they take around and face this Temple Lord whatever they pray hear them and do for them and brother this inspiration struck Jonah in the belly of the fish yes and I don't know what Compass or navigation tool he used and he was able to turn in the fish the belly of the fish and face the temple in Jerusalem and he prayed a prayer Lord have mercy on me and God heard the prayer and God directed the fish and the Lord brought the fish at the shores of n but in his will he was going to tashes the people of n were at the shore all of a sudden they saw fish coming to dock the first time in their life and then the fish opened its mouth and they saw a man walking out from the face what this an experience that we have never seen before and the moment Jonah St on the shore and he said thus sayth the Lord all the people repented you see what God can do if God say that this is your work you can never run away from it amen if God said that he will use you you can never run away from it he know how to Corner you he know how to hold you he know how to grab you and make sure you come to the post of Duty amen and amen hallelujah he say so God was in there and he would just keep hunting you so why do we wait any longer let us just start the Revival right now yes what are you waiting on brother sister we believe that the coming of the Lord is at hand and he is going to have a bride and the bride is ready and we don't want no ships to any tashes we are going to nineve we don't want to go to any place we are going to glory and the prophet shouted amen here that is right we are going where God is going to bless and that is what we want to do amen hallelujah amen and amen you see so that is the reason why this is not the time of Slumber this is not the time of sleeping but this is the time that Believers we must be on fire hallelujah look at what is happening right now in the Middle East Palestinian against Israel look sometimes we we we forget about ourselves these things are bound to happen and it is happening the war between Israel and those people it is not from today a time from Memorial from the day of Abraham when God said that Abraham get up and walk every place that the show of your feet will tread it is the part of the land I have given you he said there can never be any man to stand against you and any man that cat you I'll cat them and any nation that will bless you I'll bless that nation and from that time Abraham fought and took the land when Moses led the people also from Egypt God sent them to that same portion of land he said this is what I gave to Abraham it belongs to you you are his descendants how many wars didn't they fight when Joshua took over oh my it was worse Joshua has to destroy all those Nations around because the bible say that God said as I commanded my servant Moses do it and they took all over this Gaza that they are fighting on now God gave it to his people but you know what all these things do not be confused that the the Palestinians are fighting Israel and Israel is fighting the Palestinian very soon the whole world is going to be against Israel but it is for a purpose I say what it is for a purpose brother sister it is for our own good because very soon when it becomes so much Israel is going to call for their Messiah to save them but you see before the Messiah will come you and I we must be in Glory if you read Joshua chapter 10 and Joshua 11 you see what God did for Israelites on this piece of land called Gaza it is there in the Bible Hallelujah so so we should not be confused at all beloved brothers and sisters are the Bride of Jesus Christ we know where we are standing Hallelujah we know where we are standing and I said this is preparing the ground for your rapture to take place amen and amen you see that is the reason why when those H 10 virgins the Jesus called them 10 virgins is that he say five were foolish and five were wise today we are the bread of Jesus Christ we represent the wise virgins hallelujah amen but what is the group that is called the foolish virgins the bible say that they all had the same idea they were all all all of them were waiting for the the bridegroom to come in yes that is the reason why when you sink they also sink When you pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they also pray in the name of Jesus Christ when you say praise God they also say praise God when you say hallelujah they also say hallelujah but Jesus said five were wise and five were foolish but I thank God that we are the wise virgins yes amen Oh I thought you would say Amen here I maybe you didn't hear I said I than God that we are the wise virgins yes sir God bless you brother I like that when you say Amen say amen for the devil to know that you know what you are about don't do any sick amen okay do an amen that have life an amen that have power oh Hallelujah you see and the bible say that all of them were waiting for the coming of the bridegroom what happened the bridegroom delayed he says the first hour when they were

waterfalls they are making noise he said go near and ask the water why are you making Such Noise why can't you shut up you are making so much noise he say that if that water has the mouth to speak back to you he will tell you that hey brother Mike I wish I can be gentle like you I I wish I can shut up but there is something in me that will never make me quiet that is why I'm always shouting and

shaking like this no no no no I'm not a machine yeah but my faith yes that is in me amen the word that I believe in God in Me that must shake my emotion because whether you like it or not there must be an experience before we enter into the Rapture look brother sister when God was promising the is I'm closing okay now he said when you see these things look up for your Redemption drawing n so why there is war over there between the israelit and the Philistines they are looking up and if they are looking up what should you and I the blood of Jesus Christ do because whether you like it or not Joseph must hide the wife and children in the palace before he reveal himself to his people amen and that is the condition that we the Church of Jesus Christ we have found ourselves now when you go I don't know about here but I know that the SP back home there's a smelting Factory okay there's a smelting Factory I'm closing with this brothers and sisters I don't want to take you too much there's a smelting Factory and there are people that do business with these companies they go and gather scraps from all over the place in the country wherever they will get it and then they will send it to the factory and sell it now when they buy it they have a common place that they pour all this crafts in there and a time will come then they'll release a big steam you know what a steam is magnet okay because when they are taking the scrap they they add so many things that are not really you know Iron Metal that they use so they bring the steam or the magnet on those scraps so that if there is anything good for them to use it will Attract it will attract them okay Hallelujah I think you understand what I mean and so when they are releasing it okay it will come to a time you you see that all those metal that have connection with the magnet will be shaking in the hole they cannot keep quiet it will be shaken and they will continue to release it like that then they will no longer stay there they will jump and touch the magnet they will jump and T the magnet they anything that have connection with the magnet is good and then they'll jump and touch it and when it is done brother then it will take all and release them in a fire now when they release them on a fire like that it is going to be melted and when they melt it then out of it they'll produce a new Iron rods and that is the experience that the Holy Ghost has put us in Hallelujah all this things that is going on in this world God is bringing himself down gradual am gradual by his Spirit gradual and you see that nations are breaking people's heart are fing them from Fear they don't know what is going to happen there are so many people today they they say Jesus is coming but they are afraid because they don't know what their their their position is going to be but not you and I all right we have a Blessed Assurance so while God is coming down a time will reach brother we can no longer stay on this earth right right we can no longer stay on this earth that is why our body will be changed and then we jump and meet the Lord in the air and the Bible said that so shall we ever be with him Paul said when a man come to the Lord Jesus Christ he said behold all things are passed away yes everything has become new that is the reason why when those iron rods are taken and put into the fire and it's melt they produce a new one from it we were so vile we're not a good people but God Favored us yes and he called us by our names and he move us from the unbelief of the world and he put us into his holy spirit fire and the Holy Spirit father has melted our bad ways and he has produced a new character out of us my brother my sister what should we do we should always Rejoice am and glorify the name of our maker that he didn't count us as one of the sinners but he has pointed us as his righteous Sons and Daughters even though it is not our own righteousness but his own righteousness and they will pray that prayer like Daniel he said Lord when we come unto you we are not coming because of our righteousness but we are coming to you because of your great mercies upon us that is what has made us what we are today brother sister let us arise am let us Shake ourselves amen from every unbelief and sit in the word of God God bless all of you amen every you come and sing that song for us
