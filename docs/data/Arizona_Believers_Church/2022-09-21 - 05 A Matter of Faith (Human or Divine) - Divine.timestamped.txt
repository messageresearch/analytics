[0:00] speaking on a matter of faith
[0:02] part two on human or divine the question
[0:05] that we're asking about uh human faith
[0:07] or divine faith the question that maybe
[0:09] we even challenge ourselves with whether
[0:11] the faith we have
[0:12] is human or divine i just don't have the
[0:15] time this evening to back up to a lot of
[0:17] things from last wednesday but we'll
[0:19] make a few statements and revisit a
[0:20] quote here at the outset
[0:22] um
[0:23] that we'll try to reset everything where
[0:25] we're at in terms of our thought process
[0:27] on this
[0:28] um not necessarily in the whole series
[0:30] on a matter of faith but just that first
[0:31] part on human or divine we know that
[0:34] there are different kinds of faith
[0:36] that's what we're looking at and also
[0:38] different ways that they operate
[0:40] those two kinds of faith as we outlined
[0:42] them last time was a human faith that we
[0:43] could say is a mental faith an
[0:45] intellectual faith or an emotional faith
[0:47] and then on the other hand a divine
[0:49] faith
[0:50] and as we've been looking at divine
[0:53] healing i i want to put it in these
[0:55] terms because i think this is very
[0:56] helpful to us to understand how our
[0:58] faith operates
[0:59] both saved and unsaved can operate faith
[1:02] to be healed
[1:04] if someone experiences a miracle of
[1:06] divine healing uh not necessarily solely
[1:09] to the elect but both saved and unsaved
[1:12] can have faith to be healed have faith
[1:14] to operate a gift have faith to receive
[1:15] a blessing have faith to have a prayer
[1:17] answered
[1:18] and so faith can operate in a person
[1:22] at a level that activates the word of
[1:24] god even if they don't have the holy
[1:26] ghost
[1:27] and when jesus we used last time how he
[1:29] spoke to the fig tree doesn't really
[1:32] qualify it other than if you could have
[1:34] if you can believe and not doubt and
[1:36] have the faith the grain of a mustard
[1:37] seed you could speak to a mountain and
[1:39] have it removed and cast itself into the
[1:42] the ocean it just speaks to this
[1:44] powerful the ability or the the um the
[1:46] capability of faith and how it can
[1:49] operate
[1:50] and so i'm going to say this at the
[1:52] outset and this is kind of me kind of
[1:53] maybe getting it out there maybe my
[1:54] wheels would get going a little bit
[1:57] this faith that we're talking about in
[1:59] general faith can operate
[2:02] uh it can be the result of just human
[2:04] faith it can be a result of intellectual
[2:05] faith or mental faith
[2:07] but it can operate in such a way toward
[2:09] that faith that mental faith drops down
[2:11] into the heart and the heart accepting
[2:14] it and there not being any doubt and
[2:15] that's how faith can be the result of
[2:18] even intellectual faith is it comes down
[2:20] to a place where it drops into the human
[2:22] heart
[2:22] and god can perform things
[2:25] by his own sovereign power
[2:27] he can do things by his own will by his
[2:29] own intervention god can do things and
[2:31] perform them and it's not necessarily
[2:33] the function of anyone's faith it's just
[2:35] divine faith god intervening god acting
[2:38] god doing something but then there's
[2:40] also things that we can receive from god
[2:42] by using our own faith to act to operate
[2:45] his promises but imam talks a lot about
[2:47] it's your own faith that can use a gift
[2:49] and so there's a lot that relates to our
[2:51] own faith there's a lot that relates to
[2:52] his faith and there's this same word
[2:55] faith can be used in different contexts
[2:57] to refer to something that is absolutely
[2:59] divine but it can also be something
[3:01] that's just only human
[3:03] and
[3:03] i'm going to use this statement to i
[3:05] think that kind of gets a few key things
[3:07] out there for me because i'll be
[3:08] referring back to them or hopefully
[3:10] you'll see where they fit in as we go
[3:11] forward
[3:12] we've read this statement a number of
[3:13] times lately and it's a question and
[3:15] answer is in 1964.
[3:17] part one it says i've seen prostitutes
[3:19] come to the platform
[3:20] and be instantly healed and the sainted
[3:22] woman crossed the platform and miss it
[3:24] says sure it's based upon faith
[3:26] now those of you who listen to the
[3:28] message of the hour who read who've been
[3:30] in the message for your entire lives
[3:32] you've heard a number of statements to
[3:34] this point so this isn't the only place
[3:36] that he says it says in a lot of
[3:37] different places where the sinner
[3:40] is able to go through a prayer line and
[3:41] receive their healing but a christian is
[3:44] not
[3:45] same prayer line same hands maybe even
[3:47] the same prayer maybe even the same
[3:49] sickness
[3:50] and that uh as he uses race prostitute
[3:53] we'll just maybe say sinner this is one
[3:55] without the holy ghost is able to by
[3:57] faith because he says it's based upon
[4:00] faith by faith receive their healing and
[4:03] then a christian whom we wouldn't allege
[4:05] doesn't have faith but in that moment or
[4:07] in that instance is not able to receive
[4:09] their healing because it's based upon
[4:12] faith and something's not quite right in
[4:14] the way that they've approached the
[4:16] promise
[4:17] so in this instance and this is what
[4:18] we'll just be amplifying i think we
[4:20] ended last wednesday kind of on this
[4:21] example
[4:23] that the sinner is able to achieve some
[4:25] sort of unhindered faith where nothing
[4:27] is opposing it nothing is limiting their
[4:30] belief that they can be healed whereas
[4:32] the christian struggles intellectually
[4:34] struggles emotionally struggles in their
[4:36] spirit
[4:37] with uh with the the application of the
[4:40] promise to themselves you say ask a
[4:42] christian do you believe in divine
[4:43] healing they're always
[4:45] genuine christians say yes
[4:46] they're going to agree with the word of
[4:48] god but the reason why it may not act on
[4:50] them is there something else that's
[4:52] wrestling with the promise is it for me
[4:54] did i make a mistake am i not doing this
[4:56] right am i doing this wrong and that's
[4:58] why brother branham says in a number of
[5:00] places that a sinner can have enough
[5:02] faith to be healed but a christian miss
[5:04] it
[5:05] so i'm going to take a few moments to
[5:07] establish divine faith as a distinctly
[5:10] different faith this would be the faith
[5:12] of god this is a faith
[5:14] his it's even his gift to the elect
[5:17] in titus chapter 1 verse 1 and paul a
[5:20] servant of god an apostle of jesus
[5:22] christ according to the faith of god's
[5:24] elect and the acknowledging of the truth
[5:26] which is after godliness that's a very
[5:28] uh
[5:29] great phrase the faith of god's elect so
[5:32] there is a faith that i would say is
[5:34] unique to god's elect it is an elect of
[5:36] faith is kind of joined with the
[5:38] elective love it is something that is a
[5:40] unique to the believer and romans
[5:43] chapter 3 verse 3 paul uses another
[5:45] phrase for what if some did not believe
[5:48] shall their unbelief make the faith of
[5:50] god without effect
[5:52] so there is unbelief but then there's
[5:54] also unbelief with this related to us as
[5:56] humans that's within our ability and our
[5:58] power maybe that's um that's our
[6:01] that's our anti-superpower is to not
[6:03] believe as human beings and we all have
[6:05] it but then there is the faith of god
[6:08] that unbelief cannot make ineffective as
[6:10] he's uh we're taking this out of the
[6:12] larger context in chapter three here but
[6:14] he uses the phrase the faith of god so
[6:18] there's a faith of god a god a godly
[6:20] faith a divine faith
[6:23] and jude writing
[6:24] his letter says but ye beloved building
[6:26] up yourselves on your most holy faith
[6:30] praying in the holy ghost so this is
[6:33] this is a unique faith this is a faith
[6:35] that i would say is divine faith not
[6:37] just your faith but the most holy faith
[6:39] not just a faith but the faith of god
[6:42] not just believing but the faith of
[6:45] god's elect bill abraham in one place
[6:47] refers to divine faith he says that
[6:49] divine faith that's been placed in our
[6:52] heart by the holy spirit
[6:54] so there's a there's a faith that is
[6:56] placed in our hearts by the holy spirit
[6:58] as paul says that we are saved by faith
[7:01] in the way he says
[7:02] through grace by faith and referring to
[7:04] even both of them which is the gift of
[7:06] god the grace is a gift the faith is a
[7:08] gift of god so there is a divine faith
[7:11] that is placed inside of you by the holy
[7:14] spirit
[7:15] two statements
[7:16] uh to read
[7:18] in relation to that and again i'll
[7:20] hearken back to maybe a qualifier i gave
[7:22] last time there's a lot of things i'm
[7:24] wanting to say
[7:25] uh tonight a read from the message of
[7:26] the hour just so that we know what
[7:28] brother benham said kind of familiar
[7:30] with the phrases he's using the way that
[7:32] he's looking at faith and not in any way
[7:34] to try to explain faith so perfectly to
[7:37] where faith is no longer a matter of
[7:38] faith but think about the different ways
[7:41] that brother brahm talked about it so it
[7:42] gives us a better view of of the whole
[7:45] subject
[7:46] and so there's some of these things i'm
[7:47] just reading not with the with the
[7:49] intent that things would click
[7:51] immediately and all that explains
[7:52] everything but just to see the prophet's
[7:55] eyes on the subject
[7:57] and the sermon earnestly contend for the
[7:59] faith he says paul was down here in the
[8:02] natural realm with his ph.d
[8:04] he had an intellectual faith but he
[8:06] didn't have a divine faith
[8:10] there in no way is preaching against
[8:12] having a phd or a doctorate but he's
[8:14] just saying that paul down here in the
[8:15] natural realm had an intellectual faith
[8:18] but he didn't have a divine faith well
[8:21] learned understood um had a lot of
[8:23] things that he knew and even with that
[8:25] intellectual faith he's very zealous for
[8:27] what he believed but he says he didn't
[8:29] have a divine faith there's quite a
[8:31] difference in me having an intellectual
[8:34] faith than a divine faith there's where
[8:36] you my baptist friends failed to go on
[8:39] you get the intellectual faith by that
[8:42] but it must be a divine revelation of
[8:44] jesus christ to you so that so that just
[8:47] came out of the heart to you that just
[8:49] came out of the heart so
[8:51] he's referring to how the baptists
[8:53] believe and in believing they believe
[8:55] that they're saved and at the moment
[8:56] they believe everything is sealed and
[8:58] it's over but in the way that they
[9:01] believe they take the word of god in
[9:03] such a way to what they're believing
[9:05] is unto the baptism of the holy ghost
[9:08] and they don't take it all away to the
[9:09] seal of faith and they've structured in
[9:11] such a way toward the mental accept
[9:14] ascent or accepting something
[9:16] intellectually is enough to say oh put
[9:18] your name on a book shake hands with the
[9:19] preacher you're saved and brother says
[9:21] no that's just an intellectual faith
[9:23] it's got to drop down further where you
[9:25] get a divine revelation of jesus christ
[9:28] which is the new birth
[9:29] and that's got to come out of the heart
[9:31] he says the intellectual faith is not
[9:33] enough
[9:34] that's right but it only brings you to
[9:36] the holy spirit
[9:37] now that's a very large subject you have
[9:39] to mentally accept things you have to
[9:41] believe even in the mind that's the
[9:43] beginning part the word of god swings
[9:44] your mind to believe things but then it
[9:46] just brings you to a place to accept
[9:49] that gift of the holy ghost
[9:50] and he says the holy spirit is a
[9:52] personal experience of the birth the new
[9:54] birth regeneration making a new creature
[9:56] in christ so there's billy brown even
[9:58] using a language that divides
[10:00] intellectual faith from human faith and
[10:03] when we speak of intellectual faith
[10:04] brother braham uses the phrase mental
[10:06] faith we could say emotional faith with
[10:08] human faith those are all things that
[10:10] relate uh to this
[10:12] faith that he's referring to here as
[10:14] distinctly different from divine faith
[10:16] then in possessing the gate of the enemy
[10:18] after trial paul after he's had his
[10:20] revelation after he's no longer working
[10:22] with his phd in intellectual faith and
[10:24] has divine faith paul said none of these
[10:26] things bother me for he was tied to an
[10:28] absolute christ
[10:30] and every true achievement is tied to an
[10:32] absolute and my absolute is the word
[10:36] and everybody else is that's really born
[10:38] of the spirit their absolute is
[10:40] god's word now one thing that i think is
[10:43] notable is when he's talking about this
[10:45] kind of faith
[10:46] he's generally relating it to i almost
[10:49] want to say absolutely to a person who's
[10:51] been born again
[10:53] this kind of faith he's talking about if
[10:54] you've really been born by the spirit
[10:56] your absolutes the word i'm tied to it
[10:58] laid my hands upon it and it took my
[11:00] place
[11:01] and i've identified myself with him
[11:04] now watch how remarkable this is the way
[11:07] that he phrases this we knew that he
[11:09] promised to identify himself with us
[11:11] that brings genuine faith
[11:13] not your own faith but his faith
[11:16] something that you don't control he does
[11:18] it
[11:20] now that's that's a different that's a
[11:22] different level of faith it's a
[11:23] different kind of faith
[11:26] and uh
[11:28] and i'm just really trusting the lord
[11:29] just to give me the wisdom and how to
[11:31] express this to you today maybe one of
[11:33] the most difficult sermons these last
[11:35] two on this subject just to be sure that
[11:37] i'm absolutely within the bounds of the
[11:39] word of god because there's so many
[11:40] things that you could just kind of chase
[11:42] after and before you know it you're out
[11:43] in the middle of nowhere
[11:44] and it's not making real sense anymore
[11:46] according to the word of god and i want
[11:48] to be very careful that i don't try to
[11:49] explain it in such a way to where we're
[11:51] all intellectually like well what that
[11:52] makes a lot of sense let's just accept
[11:54] that definition and go forward i want to
[11:57] be able to share things from the word of
[11:59] god that may even retain some sense of
[12:01] mystery to it that your faith grabs a
[12:04] hold of and says that makes sense may
[12:06] not be able to explain it later to my
[12:08] wife but that makes sense and you really
[12:10] grab a hold of it understanding just how
[12:12] broad brother or the ways that brother
[12:14] brown looked at this
[12:15] and i just don't know if we'll ever have
[12:17] time we'll have time here
[12:19] at this time to go into some of these
[12:21] things but brother bram talks about
[12:22] having an intellectual faith and he uses
[12:25] a couple phrases that suggest that with
[12:27] an intellectual faith the worldliness
[12:30] can creep into that
[12:31] and so an intellectual faith can always
[12:33] kind of be hybrid it can get mixed with
[12:35] something and other things can be joined
[12:37] to it and that's the uniqueness of this
[12:40] kind of intellectual faith because we
[12:42] could take intellectual faith and it can
[12:44] be reasoned into anything
[12:47] anything it can be reasoned into and i
[12:50] almost want to go down my line of usual
[12:52] suspects like flat earth or whatever it
[12:53] might be your intellectual faith can be
[12:56] reasoned into a lot of things and be
[12:58] very fervent about it and believe it
[13:00] very convincingly but if it's not in the
[13:02] word of god then it clearly has to be
[13:05] entirely within the realm of the
[13:07] intellect
[13:08] and so you can have an intellectual
[13:10] faith that's based upon well-reasoned
[13:13] arguments
[13:14] factual claims even the evidence of
[13:16] things trial and error
[13:19] proof and evidences
[13:21] and putting your hands on thing in an
[13:23] intellectual faith is going to derive
[13:25] and conclude from a lot of other a lot
[13:28] of factors that are in those realms
[13:30] and so intellectual faith can be towards
[13:32] anything it can be inspired by things
[13:36] and that is just a faith that can be
[13:37] hybrid and mixed up but now brother adam
[13:40] says there's another faith a genuine
[13:42] faith saying that you don't even control
[13:46] why because it's a faith that comes by
[13:47] hearing the word of god and then a faith
[13:49] that only operates by the word of god
[13:52] paul talks about it it's peter rather um
[13:54] in the acts chapter three i think it's
[13:56] verse 16 and then later when he's
[13:58] writing one of his epistles he's talking
[13:59] about a faith which is by christ in his
[14:02] name by faith from him in him so it's a
[14:04] faith that is by him but then it's a
[14:06] faith that is to him
[14:08] so there's a faith that comes by jesus
[14:10] christ and that faith that comes by
[14:11] jesus christ points right back to jesus
[14:13] christ it's fed by jesus christ and so
[14:16] that's the faith a genuine faith that's
[14:18] not even your own it's not even
[14:19] something you can control because it's
[14:21] the word that controls it now that's a
[14:23] higher level of believing
[14:25] than absolutely believing uh that it it
[14:28] it did not rain and believing it did not
[14:30] rain and then stepping outside and
[14:32] saying well i guess it did rain
[14:34] because you see the evidence of rain
[14:36] this is a higher level of believing in a
[14:38] higher level of faith
[14:40] now to see an example of this
[14:42] intellectual faith i believe we can
[14:43] identify it here in luke chapter 22.
[14:46] read verses 31-33
[14:48] this was our text and the lord said
[14:50] simon simon behold satan hath desired to
[14:53] have you that he may sift you as wheat
[14:55] but i have prayed for thee that thy
[14:58] faith fail not and when thou art
[15:00] converted strengthened thy brethren and
[15:03] then this is the faith of peter and he
[15:06] said in him lord i am ready to go with
[15:08] thee both into prison and to death. now
[15:10] what faith was that peter's own faith
[15:13] his own conviction his own belief his
[15:15] own uh
[15:17] dedication his own attachment to christ
[15:19] there's some say that this faith that
[15:21] he's referring to here was just kind of
[15:22] peter's paradigm of religion how it had
[15:24] shifted from judaism or not necessarily
[15:27] from judaism but shifted now to a belief
[15:29] and this is the messiah and so it's his
[15:31] it's his
[15:33] his own efforts to follow christ it's
[15:35] his own profession that he believes that
[15:37] christ is the son of god that comes into
[15:39] the world so i prayed that thy faith
[15:41] fail not
[15:42] and so when he says thy faith we would
[15:45] look at that as peter's own faith his
[15:47] personal acceptance of christ is his
[15:50] discipline to christ being a disciple of
[15:51] christ but he says i've prayed that it
[15:53] failed not
[15:55] and this word fail not it means utterly
[15:57] fail or to fail altogether
[15:59] and we know as we've already read that
[16:01] he he read he does not his faith falters
[16:05] i can put it that way it did falter but
[16:08] it did not fail
[16:09] because to say i pray that your faith
[16:11] would fail not it means that you would
[16:13] not ultimately reject christ that
[16:15] regardless of some doubts and regardless
[16:18] of ups and downs and regardless of a
[16:19] weakness i've prayed that ultimately you
[16:21] don't become apostate that you faith
[16:24] does not completely fall away so peter's
[16:27] faith did falter in that he denied jesus
[16:29] christ but he did not fail
[16:31] and it was according to what election
[16:34] because jesus said i'll pray for you and
[16:36] i've prayed for you that your faith
[16:37] failed not so absent election everyone
[16:40] has a faith that can ultimately fail
[16:43] so he says i've prayed that your faith
[16:45] fail not and when you are converted this
[16:47] is the divine transformation of peter's
[16:49] soul this is that this was what brings
[16:52] that genuine faith so when he's when
[16:54] he's converted strengthened thy brethren
[16:56] and when he's converted that's the seal
[16:58] of peter's own faith he believed and
[17:00] went all the way to the seal of god the
[17:02] baptism of the holy ghost and that's
[17:04] what converts peter to where now it's
[17:07] just not peter's faith
[17:09] to the point to where in acts chapter 3
[17:11] he says did you think we did this that
[17:13] this man was healed by our own power at
[17:15] solomon's porch do you think this was us
[17:17] that did it but no this is the power of
[17:19] christ for this one by faith it through
[17:22] christ in his name has been made whole
[17:25] and said this isn't my faith this is the
[17:27] faith of christ
[17:28] and so this is this is a different this
[17:30] is the transformation of peter's faith
[17:34] in the sermon blind bartimaeus and i
[17:35] realize i may just be stacking bricks
[17:37] and there may not seem to be much mortar
[17:39] going in between them but i trust the
[17:41] holy spirit can do that as we continue
[17:44] and the sermon blind bartimaeus he says
[17:46] you're a wonderful set of people
[17:48] i don't believe you can find any more
[17:49] faith as what we would call and it kind
[17:51] of pauses a little bit
[17:53] and uh so this is just my comments i i
[17:56] don't know if he was gonna say i don't
[17:56] know if you could find any more
[17:58] intellectual faith or you know just kind
[18:00] human faith but he says i'll explain it
[18:02] tomorrow the levels of faith
[18:04] what human faith is and what divine
[18:06] faith is
[18:08] and the next morning i believe he speaks
[18:10] on what what is a vision
[18:12] one of them is the human faith and the
[18:14] other one is divine faith so brother i'm
[18:16] dividing those two again
[18:18] levels of faith there's a human faith
[18:20] and one is divine faith
[18:22] and i thought the remainder of this
[18:24] statement was beautiful because now he's
[18:26] going to begin to describe
[18:28] what he's wanting the audience to do at
[18:30] the end of this service he's wanting
[18:32] them to he says i just don't know if you
[18:33] can have any more and he's just a great
[18:35] wonderful very wonderful set of people
[18:38] uh and he says but there's levels of
[18:40] faith and he's not wanting to take away
[18:42] any faith that they do have but he's
[18:44] wanting them to recognize that maybe
[18:46] faith can go up a little bit higher
[18:48] maybe there's depths of faith that they
[18:49] haven't achieved before so he's saying
[18:51] there's a human faith and there's a
[18:52] divine faith but humanly speaking you're
[18:54] one of the finest audience i've ever
[18:56] spoke to that's right
[18:58] if you could only break through that
[19:00] little crust there
[19:02] it just divides right there now i
[19:04] believe it's okay for us to think about
[19:06] a divide
[19:08] between
[19:09] human faith
[19:11] and divine faith
[19:13] i think it's okay for us to do that
[19:14] because he says there's levels of faith
[19:16] so you have a level of human faith or
[19:18] maybe we could do it this way you have a
[19:19] level of human faith and then he's
[19:20] saying there's just a little crust here
[19:23] a little divide before you can get to
[19:25] divine faith he says just a little ravel
[19:28] if you could just go over it what's a
[19:30] ravel it's a tangle or a cluster when
[19:33] you unravel something that that's what
[19:35] that word is unravels to take a tangle
[19:37] or cluster and straighten it all out he
[19:39] says there's just a divide a crust just
[19:41] a little ravel if you could just go over
[19:44] it
[19:45] you'll go from the tributary out into
[19:47] the ocean you know what i mean just
[19:48] believe
[19:49] so there's a faith that we could have
[19:51] that he's not saying oh that's a pitiful
[19:53] faith that's an awful faith that's a
[19:54] perverted faith but he's saying it's
[19:56] almost like a tributary to the ocean if
[19:58] you'll just follow the source
[20:01] it's going to get you to the ocean and
[20:03] so we can have a human faith and
[20:05] intellectual faith when i say source if
[20:07] you could just follow what it's leading
[20:09] to rather and so
[20:11] you could have a faith that
[20:13] is not the ocean but yet it's somehow
[20:15] connected to it because how do we all
[20:17] have our minds mentally swing to believe
[20:19] the message of the hour how did we all
[20:20] have our minds awakened to the things of
[20:22] god by some something first striking us
[20:26] and being this genesis of faith in our
[20:28] intellect in our minds even if it was
[20:29] just for a moment like oh i didn't even
[20:31] know that before oh i believe and then
[20:33] immediately it drops down they say
[20:35] that's the greatest distance ever
[20:36] traveled is from the head to the heart
[20:38] and the man but it's in that moment that
[20:40] the head can be awakened the intellect
[20:42] can be awakened emotions and the
[20:43] intelligence all awakened but then
[20:45] there's this ravel
[20:47] this cross that you've got a
[20:48] breakthrough to get to divine faith
[20:53] he says you know what i mean just
[20:54] believe and this statement to me is very
[20:56] important just don't try to make it so
[20:58] orthodox what all you have to do and
[21:00] what all because you can make it this
[21:02] kind of this legalism this orthodoxy
[21:04] well i've got to do this and i've got to
[21:05] do that he's saying well let's just
[21:06] believe
[21:08] we get too much orthodox in our minds
[21:10] even as message believers a lot of
[21:11] things well did it come this way did it
[21:13] come that way is it this is it that he
[21:14] says no just be like a little girl a
[21:16] little boy that's reaching up to daddy's
[21:18] hands to get the lollipop
[21:20] he said here's son this is yours just
[21:22] like that believe it it'll happen
[21:26] i i i think that's tremendous
[21:28] that kind of helps us to understand that
[21:30] there's a promise and he's wanting us to
[21:32] reach for it because he says to reach
[21:34] for it and to not just intellectually
[21:36] enjoy the lollipop and daddy promised me
[21:38] a lollipop but do exactly what a little
[21:40] kid would do
[21:41] tell you right now if i promised my
[21:43] children something like that then they
[21:44] would just they would want it because
[21:46] there's times when we've promised things
[21:47] and we forgot all about it but not our
[21:49] kids
[21:50] if you tell them even if you told them
[21:52] in 2027 on september 3rd we're going to
[21:54] take you to freddy's for some frozen
[21:57] custard they will remind you on that
[22:00] date
[22:01] almost five years later says you
[22:03] promised it you said it was going to
[22:05] happen try watch one of my kids five
[22:07] years from now
[22:08] on september third and say what about
[22:10] freddy's i'm like what are you talking
[22:11] about man i said go into the archives
[22:14] bro
[22:15] it's in there
[22:17] because it's something that a kid does
[22:19] says odd take daddy at his word he says
[22:21] here's a lollipop it's yours it says
[22:22] just believe it it'll happen
[22:24] so there's an intellectual faith but
[22:26] then there's a ravel there's a crust
[22:28] there's something that we have to get
[22:30] beyond in order to get into divine faith
[22:33] now
[22:34] in uh luke chapter 8 verse 13
[22:39] with this is just alluding to this i
[22:41] this thing sometimes i just have to cut
[22:43] down to just the statement otherwise
[22:45] just myself personally i start getting
[22:46] caught up in all the certain aspects of
[22:48] it and i want to just amplify and
[22:50] amplify it and then you just don't ever
[22:52] really get to the point but in luke
[22:53] chapter 8 and the parable of the sower
[22:55] we know the the seed is the word of god
[22:58] the different conditions of the ground
[23:01] are the wayside the stony places where
[23:04] there's thorns and then the good ground
[23:06] and we could type the the ground even to
[23:09] the condition of the person we could
[23:11] type it to just the recipient hearts and
[23:13] those that hear the word but the seed is
[23:15] the word and in every instance there's
[23:17] nothing wrong with the word there's
[23:19] something wrong with the ground that it
[23:20] falls in and how it's trampled under
[23:23] foot or it's snatched
[23:25] or it's strangled but then that good
[23:27] ground where it can bring forth a
[23:28] hundred fold
[23:29] and so christ interprets the part of
[23:31] they which they fall upon the rock
[23:34] and the stony places he says they on the
[23:36] rock are they which now the person it
[23:38] comes in view when they hear receive the
[23:42] word with joy
[23:45] and these have no root which for a while
[23:48] believe and in the time of temptation
[23:50] fall away
[23:51] so what what faith did they have
[23:54] if there's divine faith and there's
[23:56] human faith and jesus says that the word
[23:58] is broadcast and someone happily
[24:00] receives the word where did they happily
[24:03] receive it well i i believe that we
[24:05] could conclude that this is a word that
[24:07] was received intellectually emotionally
[24:11] intelligently and
[24:12] not wrong because it's the word
[24:15] it's not that they received a lie they
[24:16] received the word and this is a human
[24:18] faith because they believed for a while
[24:21] but it never found root
[24:23] it wasn't deep enough they didn't find
[24:24] root and so then something can tempt
[24:27] them in their minds in their emotions in
[24:29] their intellect and their intelligence
[24:31] in that in that intellectual faith that
[24:33] human faith
[24:34] they can be tempted and it lose their
[24:37] grip on that faith and then they fall
[24:39] away
[24:40] so human faith is characterized as being
[24:43] temporary
[24:44] human faith is weak human faith is
[24:47] emotional it's intellectual it can only
[24:49] go so far now it can be extremely
[24:51] disciplined and it can last for a very
[24:54] very long time and actually human faith
[24:56] in some ways we could say someone could
[24:58] hold it even to the point where they die
[25:00] but in itself it's not an absolute
[25:03] in itself it's not necessarily
[25:05] impervious it's something it isn't
[25:07] something that is permanently anchored
[25:09] in the soul
[25:10] it can be there can be very fervent very
[25:12] passionate
[25:14] supported and disciplined but jesus is
[25:16] saying that this kind of faith that is
[25:18] only received with joy and very gladly
[25:21] in an intellectual realm is temporary
[25:23] and you may believe for a while but in
[25:25] the hour of temptation fall away
[25:28] and so this is
[25:30] this is maybe where we're getting kind
[25:31] of to the heart of the matter human
[25:33] faith can be enough
[25:35] to result in temporary manifestations
[25:38] human faith can be enough to manifest
[25:39] itself into healing human faith can come
[25:42] rise to a level or be enough to uh to
[25:45] enjoy miracles or to see the blessings
[25:47] of god or experience certain things
[25:50] and again i think it harkens back to
[25:53] and hopefully we'll be able to uh
[25:57] express this in a way that you can
[25:58] visualize it may be
[26:01] that
[26:02] and i definitely want to come back to
[26:03] come to this in the end that you can
[26:05] have a person who's filled the holy
[26:06] ghost and a person who's not filled with
[26:07] the holy ghost and so the person who's
[26:10] filled with the holy ghost and the
[26:11] person who doesn't have the holy ghost
[26:12] can both enjoy some of the very same
[26:15] things
[26:16] using using faith on a certain level but
[26:18] then there's a believer that that's just
[26:20] a totally separate category
[26:22] and i hope that we express that enough
[26:24] for the first few services that there's
[26:26] a faith which is on another level
[26:29] connected in another dimension now we're
[26:31] just looking at faith in a broader
[26:33] spectrum and how that there can be an
[26:35] intellectual faith and in this
[26:36] intellectual faith it can operate in a
[26:39] way to actually achieve certain results
[26:43] in john chapter 5 verse 14 as we read it
[26:45] on sunday
[26:46] how the woman excuse me the man at the
[26:48] pool of bethesda
[26:50] christ is the one that starts the
[26:52] conversation with them
[26:54] he doesn't say oh put me in the water oh
[26:55] rabbi heal me
[26:57] jesus is the one that walks right up to
[26:58] him says do you want to be made whole he
[26:59] goes ah nobody can put me in the water
[27:01] and he and he says take up thy bed and
[27:03] walk
[27:04] and in that instance the man not even
[27:07] knowing who jesus was
[27:09] just took this man at his word
[27:11] it's like
[27:12] i'm just gonna take up my bed and walk
[27:15] and immediately the man was healed
[27:17] and so what happened in that moment if
[27:20] we could just
[27:21] diagram it this way is christ told him
[27:24] to do something and in his mind he
[27:26] didn't say well that's foolish why would
[27:27] i listen to you and then in his heart he
[27:30] didn't say ah i think i'd just rather
[27:31] wait and try to get my way into the
[27:32] water he just in the moment accepted it
[27:36] took up his bed and began to walk not
[27:38] even knowing who jesus was it's not
[27:40] until later that jesus comes to him the
[27:41] temple and it's in that conversation oh
[27:44] this is who it was it was jesus
[27:47] and so jesus tells him in the temple
[27:48] verse 14
[27:50] afterward jesus findeth him in the
[27:51] temple and said unto him behold thou art
[27:53] made whole
[27:55] sin no more
[27:57] lest a worse thing come unto thee
[27:59] now that phrase is something i think we
[28:00] hear in the message of the hour a lot
[28:02] and it's a principle that we know a lot
[28:04] about that whenever there was a healing
[28:07] and someone was being healed and again
[28:09] we're talking about divine healing
[28:11] that someone receives their healing the
[28:13] charge is
[28:14] keep believing don't stop believing
[28:17] or because sin is unbelief or a worse
[28:20] thing will come unto thee
[28:23] in other words in that moment
[28:25] he had enough faith to take jesus at his
[28:27] word take up his bed and begin to walk
[28:30] and he was experiencing the benefits of
[28:32] it but jesus is saying if you disbelieve
[28:34] a worse thing will come on you so
[28:36] whatever happened was in this was
[28:38] temporary
[28:39] because his unbelief could throw him out
[28:42] of that wholeness
[28:45] and into a worse thing
[28:47] now there's dozens of statements i could
[28:48] use but just listen to these two brother
[28:50] bram says and that's just how long
[28:51] divine healing lasts as long as you
[28:53] believe it
[28:54] [Music]
[28:55] another place divine healing lasts just
[28:57] as long as your faith lasts with it
[28:59] have you heard these statements before
[29:00] yes remember i'm talking about your
[29:02] healing last as long as you believe it
[29:03] he says the same thing about your
[29:04] salvation and that to me that kind of
[29:06] kicks into a whole other area of
[29:08] conversation but he said your divine
[29:10] healing lasts as long as you believe it
[29:12] as long as your faith lasts with it so
[29:14] as long as you have faith to believe
[29:16] you're healed there's a power
[29:18] even in your own faith
[29:20] that can hold your body in subjection
[29:24] and keep you well and and i would say
[29:26] it's god that heals
[29:28] not you that healed but your faith in
[29:30] the promise has now held sickness at bay
[29:33] but as soon as you disbelieve then
[29:35] there's no longer there's no longer the
[29:37] the law of faith that's working against
[29:39] the disease or the sickness or the ill
[29:42] uh whatever ailment it may be and that
[29:44] can come right back on you again
[29:46] so he says the healing will last is your
[29:48] faith as long as your faith lasts
[29:50] now in the sermon god provided a lamb is
[29:52] this is this okay for you all of you
[29:55] individually tonight i know i struggled
[29:57] with it just getting ready to preach it
[29:59] something just i felt like i got gut
[30:01] punched as i was driving to church i
[30:02] don't know what it was i just got
[30:03] anxious i got worried i got all upset
[30:05] and had nothing to do with anything else
[30:07] other than maybe just the devil did a
[30:09] drive-by shooting or something
[30:11] and uh so i just been troubled in my
[30:12] spirit but i i think it's very important
[30:14] for us to get and i don't want us to
[30:16] miss this and the sermon god provided a
[30:18] lamb he said there's brother this is
[30:20] just it's not here but let me say it
[30:22] just before he says he said there's an
[30:23] intellectual faith and he says we are a
[30:26] trinity
[30:27] and he says we are
[30:28] like god he says our body our soul body
[30:31] and spirit so what he's about to say is
[30:33] based upon the fact that there's an
[30:34] intellectual faith and as he wants to
[30:36] deal with intellectual faith he wants to
[30:38] break us down to body spirit soul and so
[30:41] that's important to kind of
[30:42] understanding what he's talking about he
[30:44] says now intellectual faith is what and
[30:45] i know it's a fragment but i read it so
[30:48] you could realize bill graham what he's
[30:49] getting beginning to say is he's
[30:50] thinking about how intellectual faith
[30:52] works that's what's the matter with our
[30:54] revivals today now here it is now get it
[30:56] billy graham jack schuler many of great
[30:58] men oral roberts great evangelists on
[31:00] the field have combed this nation back
[31:02] and forth altar calls have been made
[31:04] till enough to convert a thousand
[31:05] americas
[31:07] not americans he says americas
[31:10] and
[31:12] and so he's
[31:14] he says but the reason
[31:16] it's the only it's only the people are
[31:18] brought to an intellectual faith
[31:21] so altar calls
[31:22] uh have been made and there's conviction
[31:25] and there's promises and there's
[31:26] professions so that they would just go a
[31:29] little deeper
[31:30] till that faith comes from the
[31:31] intellectuals and soaks down into the
[31:34] soul it would last
[31:36] so there can be a faith that we have
[31:37] intellectually and in terms of a
[31:39] conversion he says if it would just go
[31:41] deeper
[31:42] not just receive the word with joy and
[31:44] after a while and believe for a while
[31:46] but go to something deeper he's saying
[31:48] it would last that's the reason about 80
[31:50] or 90 of the converts that come in a
[31:52] revival are gone before six months is
[31:54] gone is because they only have an
[31:56] intellectual conception
[31:58] so their conversion lasts as long as
[32:00] their faith lasts
[32:02] their experience lasts as long as their
[32:04] human faith or intellectual faith will
[32:06] last but when it comes to an experience
[32:08] of being born again of the spirit of god
[32:10] that anchors to eternity
[32:12] what is he highlighting this dynamic of
[32:14] how the word preached or things could be
[32:16] said and mentally we can grab ahold of
[32:18] it we could believe it any and even
[32:20] begin to walk and do some blessing as a
[32:22] part of it but it won't last unless it
[32:25] drops down in terms of conversion into
[32:28] the soul
[32:29] and so an intellectual faith
[32:32] can be a faith that never goes deep
[32:33] enough for a conversion
[32:36] and he's saying that something stops it
[32:38] it's there somehow but something stops
[32:40] it from going deeper
[32:42] now to
[32:43] kind of
[32:44] open up this subject a little bit on
[32:46] what brown's talking about because he
[32:47] says we're a trinity of body spirit soul
[32:50] in jeremiah chapter 29 verse 13
[32:53] he says and you shall seek me and find
[32:55] me when you shall search for me with all
[32:57] your heart
[32:58] so we can't just be seeking
[33:00] intellectually
[33:01] academically
[33:03] with false motives
[33:05] you can't just be seeking with the human
[33:07] heart just emotionally just
[33:08] intelligently only but you have to
[33:10] research he says with all your heart
[33:13] there's something all-encompassing about
[33:15] it not just from the mind but also in
[33:16] the deepest part not just ah let's just
[33:19] see but he says you'll find me when you
[33:21] search with me with all your heart so if
[33:24] i could put it this way maybe you can do
[33:26] it intellectual faith can be some of it
[33:28] some of your mind
[33:30] it could be some of the person but it's
[33:32] not all
[33:33] there can be a part that believes but a
[33:35] part that doesn't a part that rejects it
[33:36] a part that reasons with it says you'll
[33:38] find me when you seek me with all your
[33:40] heart
[33:42] and so going back to the parable of the
[33:43] sower in matthew 13 verses 5 and 6 he
[33:46] says some fell upon stony places where
[33:49] they had not much earth in forthwith
[33:51] they sprung up because they had no
[33:53] deepness of earth remember brother
[33:55] braham says it's got to go deep enough
[33:57] it doesn't go deep enough so there was
[33:59] some ground but it was hard it was
[34:01] compacted it couldn't get any roots in
[34:03] they had no deepness of earth and when
[34:05] the sun was up they were scorched and
[34:06] because they had no root they withered
[34:09] away
[34:11] so there is a way that we can
[34:14] intellectually receive the word of god
[34:16] and in receiving intellectually we can
[34:18] receive it with joy we can hold it there
[34:20] in our minds but since it's not deep
[34:22] enough the scripture says it's shallow
[34:25] because it doesn't go deep enough it
[34:27] can't fully grow
[34:28] to the place where it can bring forth
[34:30] the fruit that that seed is intended to
[34:32] grow
[34:33] so the scripture and brother branham are
[34:35] identifying that there's a way that our
[34:37] minds can hold the word of god
[34:39] intellectually and believe
[34:42] but then the word of god speaks to faith
[34:43] where it's not just in the mind but it's
[34:45] from the heart if i could say maybe the
[34:47] whole heart
[34:49] whatever that might actually be that
[34:51] it's not just intellectually but there's
[34:53] some deepness to it it means really in
[34:55] reality
[34:56] in romans 6 17 he says but god be
[34:59] thanked that you were the servants of
[35:01] sin but you have obeyed from the heart
[35:03] that form of doctrine which was
[35:05] delivered you
[35:06] it's not that you just believed from the
[35:08] mind but you obeyed from the heart so it
[35:11] takes it out of the realm of a weak
[35:12] faith the temporal faith took it out of
[35:14] the realm of something that was just
[35:15] human faith but it put it in the realm
[35:17] of divine faith that acts upon the
[35:19] promises of god or faith that comes from
[35:22] the heart it's deeper than just
[35:24] intellectual it comes from a real
[35:26] conviction
[35:27] in ephesians chapter 6 verse 6 now with
[35:29] eye service not as with eye service as
[35:31] men pleasers but as a servants of christ
[35:35] doing the will of god from
[35:37] the heart
[35:39] if you only do it for man you can do it
[35:40] intellectually from the mind you can do
[35:42] it from human emotion give sympathy on
[35:44] somebody you want to please your dad you
[35:45] want to make the pastor happy whatever
[35:47] it might be those things can only find
[35:49] their genesis in the mind in your
[35:51] emotions intellectual academic through
[35:54] feeling through thought through emotion
[35:55] through intelligence but when you do it
[35:57] from the heart that's deeper
[36:01] is this does that make sense in terms of
[36:03] brotherhood say well there's levels of
[36:04] faith there's a human faith but then
[36:05] there's a divine faith and again i i
[36:08] can't explain this in such a way where
[36:09] it's going to satisfy maybe every
[36:11] question every objection and i don't
[36:13] even want to try to explain it but
[36:15] just
[36:16] and i don't want to ex i don't want to
[36:18] express these things in a way to where
[36:19] it just gets real complicate complicated
[36:21] and con convoluted but just realize
[36:23] there's streams there's just a way that
[36:24] we can believe and it's intellectual but
[36:27] then it can go deeper where it's more
[36:28] than just intellect but it's associated
[36:30] with something in the heart
[36:33] watch how james
[36:35] speaks to prayer and believing in james
[36:37] chapter 1 verses 5 to 8
[36:41] this is a good scripture
[36:43] to think about
[36:44] in regards to a matter of faith and then
[36:47] also in receiving your healing it says
[36:49] if any man lack wisdom let him ask god
[36:51] that that god giveth to all men
[36:53] liberally and abradeth not and it shall
[36:56] be given him what a beautiful promise
[36:59] and he says but let him ask in faith
[37:02] so if you lack wisdom you ought to ask
[37:05] god i think this speaks to the believer
[37:07] ask god for wisdom and he'll give
[37:08] liberty and he won't rebuke you for
[37:10] asking but
[37:12] you can't ask for that just anyway
[37:15] remember how james is going to say later
[37:17] that you ask a miss you ask for things
[37:19] because you want to consume it on your
[37:20] own lust there's some other motive some
[37:22] other objective something working in the
[37:24] human spirit that's requesting things or
[37:27] wanting things and desiring things and
[37:28] it's not really with the faith a genuine
[37:30] faith it says let them ask in faith not
[37:33] wavering
[37:35] so this is the issue wavering for he
[37:37] that wavereth is like the wave of the
[37:39] sea
[37:40] driven with the wind and tossed for let
[37:42] not that man think he shall receive
[37:44] anything of the lord
[37:46] because to ask in
[37:48] faith could you to ask in faith is to
[37:52] have no wavering
[37:54] to ask in faith is there's no variance
[37:56] there's no i want this but asking faith
[37:59] is on some level or the seeking i'm
[38:02] seeking with my whole heart this is very
[38:04] clear to me this is something i want
[38:06] this is something i'm asking for this is
[38:08] something i desire and so to ask in
[38:10] faith is coming to a place with respect
[38:13] to that promise or the thing that you're
[38:14] asking for you're not wavering on it
[38:17] lord i i want this job but
[38:20] right
[38:21] and this and that and the other i really
[38:23] really like this girl but if this sister
[38:25] liked me now
[38:26] that's different right and it's not like
[38:29] you're just kind of weighing things and
[38:30] trying to figure things out it says i'm
[38:32] asking in faith not wavering and he says
[38:35] because if a man is wavering don't don't
[38:37] think that that's the kind of faith
[38:39] that's going to achieve a result
[38:41] so he's looking at the person and how a
[38:43] man can
[38:45] that he's saying ask for something he
[38:46] kind of drops down and teaches us
[38:48] something about faith and says you can't
[38:49] ask in faith if there's any kind of
[38:51] hesitation
[38:52] you can't ask in faith if there's any
[38:54] kind of contingencies any kind of doubt
[38:56] any kind of fear any kind of worry any
[38:58] any idea that maybe it's not so or it
[39:00] shouldn't be he says you've got to ask
[39:02] without wavering and then he drops this
[39:04] in in verse 8 a double-minded man is
[39:07] unstable in all his ways
[39:09] and to me i believe this is a separate
[39:11] principle that stands on its own but it
[39:13] points back to what he's saying if you
[39:14] have faith and you're a believer then
[39:16] you ought to ask in faith without
[39:18] wavering he says because a man who's
[39:20] double-minded is unstable he's not going
[39:22] to get what he wants
[39:24] a man who's unstable is a double-minded
[39:27] man he says is unstable he's restless in
[39:29] everything he thinks he has a
[39:31] there's a variance in how he feels and
[39:33] he decides nothing's ever certain
[39:36] nothing's ever sure
[39:37] a double-minded man is a doubter someone
[39:39] who is a waiver
[39:41] a waiver someone has divided loyalties
[39:43] is what the bible says
[39:45] so they're unsure they're uncommitted oh
[39:47] yeah i'll do that i think
[39:50] well yeah i i'm right behind you i got
[39:52] your back i mean you're way back
[39:54] right i mean there's just a way they're
[39:56] just you're just not sure where they
[39:57] stand he said a man that is
[39:59] double-minded is unstable in all his
[40:00] ways
[40:01] and then where brother branham places
[40:03] this scripture
[40:05] is not
[40:06] a person who has the holy ghost
[40:08] and then wrestles in their spirit
[40:11] but he takes it from the position of
[40:12] somebody who has not the holy ghost but
[40:14] believes in their mind
[40:16] and he says don't be double-minded throw
[40:17] your whole life to him and believe with
[40:19] all your heart
[40:20] so it's really the person without the
[40:22] holy ghost
[40:24] who who wrestles with this double
[40:26] mindedness
[40:27] because intellectually they can have all
[40:29] the faith in the world but right down in
[40:31] the heart of the matter they don't
[40:33] they can't
[40:36] the person without the holy ghost cannot
[40:37] have eternal life the brotherhood says
[40:39] don't be double-minded throw your whole
[40:41] life to him and so this person who's
[40:43] double-minded they don't have that
[40:45] eternal life on the inside of them so
[40:46] their their human ex their experience is
[40:49] only going to last as long as their
[40:50] human faith lasts
[40:53] brother braham said that's what's the
[40:54] matter with a lot of so-called
[40:55] christians today they cross breed with
[40:58] the world no wonder you can't ever be
[41:00] settled double-minded never able to come
[41:02] to the knowledge of the truth a man's
[41:04] got to know god by the new birth and be
[41:06] borned and filled with the holy ghost
[41:09] that's what keeps you from being
[41:10] double-minded so i know that we we like
[41:13] to use the scripture and i'm not saying
[41:15] it would be wrong to use it this way
[41:16] because i think there's still a
[41:18] principle that could be applied but
[41:19] brother branham takes the scripture says
[41:21] a double-minded man is a man who's
[41:23] trying to ask god for wisdom these are
[41:24] my words in james now that from the book
[41:27] of james is a man who's asking god for
[41:29] wisdom but he's doing it intellectually
[41:31] not from a heart of faith that possesses
[41:33] the mind of christ that's going to
[41:35] answer to the request but they want
[41:37] something from god and james said don't
[41:39] think that a man who's double-minded is
[41:41] going to get something from god because
[41:43] how can a man ask intellectually when
[41:45] even deep down in his deepest part is
[41:47] divided
[41:49] when there when there's no certainty
[41:50] there's no absolute there's no
[41:52] permanence there and he can be in one
[41:54] day out the next up and down he said
[41:56] this is a man with divided loyalties and
[41:58] so a double-minded man brother bran
[42:00] places him in these instances is
[42:01] somebody who may have human faith but
[42:04] doesn't believe in the soul doesn't
[42:05] believe in the heart
[42:11] and now two more statements and then i
[42:12] i'm going to close with some
[42:15] i'll have a couple more quotes but i'll
[42:16] close with some visual representations
[42:18] of this
[42:19] but these two statements i think will
[42:21] help us
[42:21] just add a little bit more
[42:24] uh for us to consider in the sermon
[42:25] glorified jesus he says now if you can
[42:27] look and live where you hear the gospel
[42:29] when you hear the gospel preached
[42:32] on the basis of the word that settles it
[42:35] you're healed right then right there
[42:38] but you cannot be healed by mental faith
[42:41] you've got to be healed by real living
[42:44] faith from
[42:45] your heart
[42:48] now if i could say this based upon this
[42:50] statement a number of other statements
[42:51] i've read but just using this statement
[42:53] because it's one of the places where
[42:54] broadband is very clear
[42:56] where it's the only place i could find
[42:57] where he says it but it's the only place
[42:59] he says it exactly this way you cannot
[43:01] be healed by mental faith
[43:03] and so i'm not saying he doesn't allude
[43:04] to it elsewhere in a similar way but he
[43:06] says it so clearly here you cannot be
[43:08] healed by mental faith
[43:10] but you've got to be healed by a real
[43:12] living faith from your heart
[43:15] and so again i think it points to this
[43:16] idea that you can have a mental faith
[43:20] where you believe something but your
[43:22] heart doesn't necessarily believe it
[43:24] right
[43:25] and so the mind you you the the you
[43:28] could have an intellectual
[43:30] emotional human faith but something else
[43:32] has to ultimately up and open up
[43:35] in the heart in order to embrace it and
[43:36] to accept it
[43:38] so sure you have to have a mental faith
[43:40] otherwise you can mentally not believe
[43:43] and that becomes the resistance
[43:45] that becomes the barrier so someone
[43:46] could say well okay i can accept that
[43:49] but then the heart still swinging around
[43:51] the heart's still varying this heart's
[43:52] not sure and so the mind can say okay i
[43:55] accept it but then there's still a
[43:57] deeper part that it has to travel to in
[44:00] order to become this real living faith
[44:02] to be healed
[44:04] he says it this way in the sermon i have
[44:05] heard but now i see then faith has a
[44:08] channel to move into
[44:10] if it doesn't then you've got mental
[44:12] intellectual faith not genuine faith
[44:14] from god
[44:15] that intellectual faith will get you
[44:17] nowhere
[44:18] might get you emotional but it won't get
[44:20] you the healing that you're looking for
[44:22] and i would say that a person who's
[44:24] looking for healing is not looking for a
[44:25] temporary healing but looking for
[44:27] wholeness
[44:28] they're looking they want to be in
[44:29] remission complete full remission they
[44:31] want it to be over they want to be done
[44:33] and so faith has to move into a channel
[44:36] if faith doesn't move to the proper
[44:38] channel then it remains mental faith or
[44:39] intellectual faith and it never becomes
[44:41] a genuine faith that is in that promise
[44:45] of god
[44:46] he says your intellectual faith may make
[44:48] you emotional but you're not going to
[44:50] receive the healing that you're looking
[44:52] for
[44:53] so he says in one way you cannot be
[44:55] healed by mental faith but then he says
[44:58] it this way the intellectual faith may
[44:59] get you emotional but not the healing
[45:01] you're looking for
[45:03] because he says in one place you can
[45:04] have enough mental faith to rise up out
[45:06] of a wheelchair
[45:08] he says it's true you can have enough
[45:10] mental faith to rise up out of the
[45:11] wheelchair out of a cot so mental faith
[45:14] can do that
[45:15] mental faith can work in such a way to
[45:17] where a person
[45:18] can
[45:19] activate a promise of god can embrace
[45:21] the promise of god but it's still just
[45:23] not purely mental it can be enough to
[45:26] where a person can receive it into their
[45:28] hearts and accept it but let me say this
[45:30] as long as it still is only
[45:33] that channel of human faith they've got
[45:35] to hold that faith because their healing
[45:37] is only going to last as long as that
[45:38] faith holds
[45:41] so i believe what brother branham is
[45:42] doing through a number of these
[45:43] statements and it's a wednesday night
[45:45] it's such a difficult subject for me to
[45:47] approach i've been very very difficult
[45:49] for me to
[45:50] harness these things to be able to share
[45:52] them with you i think it's good for a
[45:53] wednesday night audience but maybe
[45:55] there's we just don't have enough time
[45:57] to really
[45:58] expound upon a number of different ways
[46:00] that brother baum approaches this but i
[46:02] would say that brother branham is
[46:03] exposing a tangle of elements
[46:07] he's looking at a faith that can be all
[46:08] human
[46:10] but then he's looking at a faith that
[46:11] can be divinity mixed with humanity
[46:14] he's looking into faith that can be
[46:15] entirely within a particular channel but
[46:17] it's a law of faith and it's a law of
[46:19] faith that can operate outside of the
[46:21] elect operating that anybody can operate
[46:23] it
[46:24] it's a way that god's word now god can
[46:26] say god's specific purpose was for his
[46:28] elect but he had the right laws in order
[46:31] for that to be achieved and by virtue of
[46:33] those laws that are to god's elect
[46:35] there's others who can essentially
[46:36] exercise the authority of those laws to
[46:39] receive other ancillary blessings or off
[46:42] uh byproduct of blessings and it's all
[46:45] them humanly activating the word of god
[46:48] it says it over and over and over again
[46:50] that year it's your faith that uses the
[46:53] gift to his own gift of discernment in
[46:54] certain things it's your faith that does
[46:56] it's your faith that does it it's your
[46:57] own faith that does it so people by
[46:59] their own faith could reach into a realm
[47:01] and cause a gift to be be activated and
[47:04] even says that whenever it speaks
[47:05] something or says something that allows
[47:07] that person to just line it all up and
[47:10] accept it and receive their healing in
[47:11] that moment and it doesn't mean they
[47:13] have received the holy ghost and are
[47:15] sealed forever in the body of christ
[47:16] they have used a human faith that has a
[47:19] and i want to be careful i say it's
[47:21] almost a shadow of the divine faith
[47:23] because it's to a divine promise and god
[47:25] accepts it and god blesses it and grants
[47:28] a blessing
[47:29] so he's exposing a tangle if i like say
[47:31] that because i like the way he used that
[47:33] word ravel
[47:34] and he's he's saying things in such a
[47:36] way where he approaches it this way okay
[47:38] but then he approaches it from another
[47:39] way it's like all right and what i found
[47:41] is you try to put it all together it's
[47:43] expressing something to us that i want
[47:45] to be able to i want to
[47:47] visualize it for you
[47:49] and it may seem like we just slow way
[47:51] down and and may not be ending on the
[47:53] crescendo that we normally end on
[47:55] wednesday nights where we're running the
[47:56] aisle and we open up the doors and we
[47:58] just you know how it is
[48:02] okay you didn't didn't have to laugh
[48:04] that loud
[48:05] but let's consider
[48:07] let's consider the
[48:09] the two different states of a person
[48:12] so we won't say it's
[48:14] different two different people would
[48:15] just say one person in two different
[48:16] states
[48:18] and let's say it is a sinner
[48:20] so i refer to the sinner i mean unsaved
[48:22] or unsealed
[48:24] or
[48:25] a saint which should be saved or sealed
[48:28] the same that's the way i'm going to use
[48:29] that my nomenclature way i'm going to
[48:30] use it is you have the sinner that means
[48:32] they're not saved and now they could be
[48:34] saved at white throne but i say a sinner
[48:36] they do not possess eternal life they do
[48:38] not have the holy ghost but the saint is
[48:41] saved and they are sealed that's the
[48:42] language we're using now in this
[48:45] slide here
[48:46] in the slide 51 brother john hopefully
[48:48] that's where we're at now i hope you can
[48:50] see this all right and
[48:53] let's see if this works oh look at that
[48:54] i think i got it just okay
[48:56] i might be able to make this work where
[48:58] i can point for you
[48:59] so now um
[49:01] the
[49:02] this is
[49:04] if as you look at this i think the way
[49:06] i've tried to draw this out is this is
[49:08] the person
[49:09] and the colors may not match up for you
[49:11] perfectly but as we have the body um on
[49:14] this here try to make that color match
[49:17] up with this line here
[49:19] and so you have the body then you have
[49:20] the spirit
[49:22] which is that inner another realm and
[49:23] then you have the soul which i've marked
[49:25] here and i put it kind of gray because
[49:26] it's kind of a mixture right now this is
[49:28] the person as they are born
[49:30] and so in this person you have you have
[49:33] body spirit soul just represent it this
[49:35] way to you so we can begin to think
[49:37] about the trinity brother graham said
[49:38] and where intel intellectual faith
[49:40] resides now for the body the body has
[49:42] the five senses of what see taste feel
[49:45] smell and hear i still write them down
[49:47] still look at them and so those are the
[49:49] five senses that we have to that outer
[49:51] ring that peach ring that looks like
[49:53] there that's the outer person that's the
[49:55] body
[49:56] and um i'd originally maybe represented
[49:58] it where you had the mind maybe in the
[50:00] in the head and then you had the body
[50:02] but it's there's certain elements of
[50:04] taste and here and see it's all right
[50:05] here even in the physical part this
[50:07] outer person and then you have the
[50:09] spirit it's imagination conscience
[50:12] memory reason and affection those are
[50:13] the five senses or channels or gates to
[50:16] the spirit so that's every person is has
[50:19] a body this is the one right here that's
[50:21] getting tired has a spirit right that
[50:23] may be a little bit frustrated with the
[50:24] way the service is going but that's
[50:26] that's the body and spirit that's all
[50:28] every single one of us but then this is
[50:31] the person this is the state of a person
[50:33] who is not saved or sealed all of us
[50:35] have a soul
[50:37] and that soul is this part here that's
[50:39] represented by a heart i'm just using a
[50:41] heart to diagram this and i actually
[50:43] have it bordered with that blue part
[50:45] because there's this affinity to the
[50:47] unsaved person between that soul and the
[50:49] spirit because they're both natural
[50:50] still
[50:51] they're both carnal
[50:53] now i'm taking together uh
[50:56] uh you know years of brother brahms
[50:58] ministry
[50:59] 18 years of ministry uh brother brahms
[51:02] sermons where he's touched on these
[51:04] things and i feel very confident that i
[51:06] can express it in this way it would not
[51:07] be misleading but a child a person a
[51:10] teenager anybody who is unsaved
[51:12] in this world has body spirit soul
[51:16] the body has the senses of the uh
[51:19] of the flesh the spirit has the senses
[51:21] of the spirit and then the soul the way
[51:23] brother graham describes it quite a bit
[51:24] that i think helps us is the soul
[51:26] operates by free more agency
[51:29] in other words it's a decider it's a
[51:31] chooser
[51:33] to quote president bush i'm the decider
[51:35] and uh and so there's something that
[51:37] that makes the decision it comes to the
[51:39] conclusions and the the body and the
[51:42] mind can give the input
[51:44] the body and the spirit i think using
[51:45] the mind can sometimes be a little bit
[51:46] misleading but using the spirit and the
[51:49] body
[51:50] it takes in this information and it can
[51:52] accept or it can doubt it
[51:55] this is exactly how brother brown lays
[51:57] it out it can it can either uh some
[51:59] other place that can receive or reject
[52:02] is maybe other ways that it might be
[52:03] described so you have the body spirit
[52:06] soul you have the seed taste feel
[52:08] smelling here you have the imagination
[52:10] of conscious memory reason and affection
[52:12] in your spirit then in the soul there's
[52:14] free more agency in this soul and it can
[52:16] either reject or receive accept or doubt
[52:20] now
[52:22] to a born-again person
[52:25] this
[52:26] you still have the body spirit but now
[52:28] the soul there's been a nature
[52:30] change and that sense changes that sense
[52:33] there it is not just free moral agency
[52:36] anymore
[52:37] it is not operating of receive or doubt
[52:40] it can only it's only faith now so you
[52:42] still have a body you still have a
[52:44] spirit but now someone who's born again
[52:46] the soul has a nature change
[52:48] and now in the soul is only faith and so
[52:51] the soul is only going to respond to the
[52:54] word
[52:55] so when your spirit says well that's not
[52:58] true the soul may say but yeah it is
[53:01] right
[53:01] or the spirit may say well this is true
[53:03] and the soul's gonna say i don't think
[53:05] so why because it's only responding to
[53:07] the word of god
[53:08] the soul then is no longer it no longer
[53:11] has this capacity to receive or reject
[53:14] just anything and it's not even sorry
[53:16] based on free moral agency anymore
[53:19] it's sealed by god it really is the mind
[53:22] of christ it is a deposit of eternity
[53:25] you've heard from your theophany so now
[53:27] there's something eternal deposited in
[53:29] the soul the soul is sealed off remember
[53:31] from the sermon future home it's already
[53:33] in the eighth day nothing more can be
[53:35] added to it to be perfect and so now
[53:38] it's faith alone that resides there not
[53:40] doubt only faith but it's faith that can
[53:43] only be projected to the word
[53:47] it's a faith that can only uh be
[53:49] inspired by it's a it's a faith now that
[53:52] can only is the only thing it can really
[53:53] grab a hold of to work is the word
[53:57] otherwise if it's something else it
[54:00] won't it won't show this alignment and i
[54:01] put up there just exactly like this just
[54:03] so you can kind of see it in that way
[54:06] now
[54:08] i want to do a comparison
[54:12] between two people
[54:15] that demonstrates how faith works for
[54:16] both now this could be the same person
[54:18] in two different states
[54:20] and i'm going to read this to you and i
[54:22] don't know if you could if you could see
[54:23] this very well i realize the way it's
[54:24] being presented here here's a person
[54:26] who's not saved and i put here a snake
[54:29] in their heart and the heart's still
[54:30] gray the person over here
[54:32] has received the holy ghost
[54:34] and in there is this this is a heart
[54:36] that's been lit up by faith now here's
[54:38] how brother brown describes it
[54:40] in the sermon
[54:42] uh future home he says now here's a
[54:44] human heart and here's a human heart so
[54:47] now in this we have two human hearts you
[54:48] see that two people two different human
[54:50] hearts it's exactly the way he's drawing
[54:52] it up now this one over here has a snake
[54:54] in it and what he says that sin
[54:58] says here has the life
[55:01] this one over here has a dove in it
[55:03] which is the holy spirit here he has a
[55:05] life
[55:07] so this could be this two different
[55:08] states of the same person
[55:10] unsaved unsealed not born again they
[55:13] have body spirit soul but in the soul
[55:15] bremen says let's just put a snake there
[55:18] he's using this not as an absolute to
[55:20] create a doctrine but it definitely
[55:22] represents the hybrid nature of fallen
[55:24] man where he does not come direct from
[55:26] adam but he is hybrid born between eve
[55:29] and satan and he has this hybrid nature
[55:31] everything mixed in carnally so he has a
[55:33] body spirit and even his soul you could
[55:35] say is this malaise it's this a
[55:38] mongrelization it's this mixture so it's
[55:40] gray it it can accept it can doubt it
[55:42] can it can receive it can reject it has
[55:45] all these different elements to it but
[55:46] there's still a root of sin down in his
[55:49] soul
[55:50] and he says now he says now this one
[55:52] here i may not be able to see this very
[55:54] well it says this one here has malice
[55:56] hatred and envy
[55:57] see how that's superimposed over this
[56:00] person says this person here has malice
[56:03] hatred and envy and what causes it he
[56:05] says this is what's causing it this
[56:07] fellow here
[56:09] so it's the snake
[56:11] in the soul
[56:13] that is teaching the spirit and the body
[56:15] to have malice hatred and envy or the
[56:17] spirit to have it in the body to act on
[56:19] it it comes from this guy here
[56:22] well this one over here
[56:24] has love joy and long suffering or
[56:27] patience is how i put it here has long
[56:28] suffering and he says that he said
[56:30] that's
[56:31] what does it down here the dove
[56:35] so the reason why we act as sinners from
[56:38] birth is because you're born with the
[56:40] serpent nature so to speak a hybrid
[56:42] nature and it's what causes you to have
[56:44] malice and hatred and envy it's what
[56:45] causes you to sin and it comes from the
[56:47] soul which has not been regenerated or
[56:49] born again but over here we have love
[56:52] joy patience from the holy ghost that
[56:55] comes from within the soul
[56:58] now he says
[57:01] is this is this is slide 57 is that
[57:03] right brother john yes okay so now when
[57:05] you're asked
[57:08] or you're forgiven of your sins he says
[57:10] you've only done this
[57:12] you've only taken that away
[57:15] but the thing that made you do it is
[57:17] still there
[57:18] did you catch that
[57:20] i put it down here so you can see it
[57:21] actually i just forgot to put it up
[57:22] around the head is what i did but it's
[57:24] here so you can see it when you've asked
[57:26] for forgiveness
[57:28] and you've repented of your sin you've
[57:30] only done this in other words you've
[57:32] asked god to forgive you and it's kind
[57:34] of given you you've taken that out of
[57:36] your the human part the mind
[57:38] a sanctification of the mind because
[57:39] there's been some sort of agreement some
[57:41] accord and satisfaction of mine lord
[57:43] forgive me forgive my sins says you've
[57:44] taken this away he says but you still
[57:46] got this guy down in there
[57:49] but the thing he says the thing that
[57:50] made you do it is still there that's the
[57:52] old root of evil it's still
[57:55] there
[57:58] now again i'm demonstrating this
[58:00] visually so we can understand how faith
[58:02] works
[58:03] on the unsaved and the saved
[58:05] so now brother bam says now notice when
[58:07] you repent or baptize the name of jesus
[58:09] christ that he forgave you of your sins
[58:11] then secondly comes sanctification which
[58:13] sets your mind in order for holiness to
[58:15] think right the next comes the baptism
[58:17] of fire and holy ghost that god might
[58:20] dwell on us and the fire of god cleanses
[58:22] our hearts from sin and puts the holy
[58:24] ghost inside of us then we bring forth
[58:27] the same life that that this did because
[58:30] that's in us
[58:31] so now he's describing not just a person
[58:34] who has repented of these things he's
[58:36] done because he says when you do that
[58:38] it's only taken those things away but
[58:40] the guy that made you do it is still
[58:42] there so what's going to have to happen
[58:43] you have to keep coming back
[58:45] for this cleansing of the mind but never
[58:48] dealing with the root cause in the soul
[58:50] so what does he describe he describes a
[58:53] transformation now watch the animation
[58:55] how it happens the dove comes in takes
[58:57] away the snake and now the and the
[59:00] heart's changed
[59:01] this is what happens when you receive
[59:03] the holy ghost the dove comes down
[59:05] kills out the snake
[59:08] so now when someone's been born again
[59:10] they don't have doubt
[59:13] and unbelief in there
[59:14] they don't have well i want to believe
[59:16] and i want to accept but i also doubt
[59:18] and i also reject they don't have the
[59:20] both in there that is now gone and the
[59:22] only thing that's there is the dove and
[59:25] now the person has been changed from the
[59:27] inside from the soul
[59:31] and so i think so yeah i want to leave
[59:33] this up here to look at this
[59:36] and so i want to do the side by side
[59:38] uh comparison
[59:40] and for you to think about this
[59:42] of these people in two different states
[59:45] and i'm not talking about arizona or
[59:46] oklahoma but these two different
[59:48] conditions
[59:49] so the one on the left is the unsaved
[59:52] the one on the right is the saved
[59:55] the one on the left only has one nature
[59:59] human
[1:00:00] that's it
[1:00:01] that's all they have they have the human
[1:00:03] body they have the human mind they have
[1:00:04] the human soul in all its depravity and
[1:00:06] all of its weakness all of its strengths
[1:00:08] and all of its abilities the person on
[1:00:10] the left is unsaved so all they are is
[1:00:12] human
[1:00:13] but the person on the right the same
[1:00:15] person even now in a different state is
[1:00:17] both human but now there's divinity
[1:00:19] inside of them
[1:00:20] now there's deity on the inside of that
[1:00:22] soul even to the point where you can say
[1:00:25] that there's two
[1:00:26] natures now before we just run off into
[1:00:30] some doctrine on that and start want to
[1:00:31] have one wife on one nature and another
[1:00:33] wife on another nature
[1:00:35] think about it this way
[1:00:37] when you're purely human
[1:00:40] you are born body spirit soul as you
[1:00:42] begin to grow and learn that soul is is
[1:00:45] governing decisions and choices and
[1:00:47] making choices affecting and influencing
[1:00:50] your spirit influencing your body and
[1:00:52] then as it's acted in that as that
[1:00:53] control tower your entire life there are
[1:00:56] things that manifest in your body and
[1:00:58] things that are learned by your spirit
[1:01:00] and that becomes the person it's like
[1:01:01] your character your testimony your
[1:01:03] personality all these things can begin
[1:01:05] to achieve by nature and nurture and
[1:01:07] that's who you are but now when the soul
[1:01:09] changes the heart's been changed now
[1:01:11] there's a new life inside of you and
[1:01:13] even though the old snake is dead you've
[1:01:16] learned a lot
[1:01:18] from the other nature
[1:01:20] and so it still lives represented in
[1:01:22] your spirit in your body
[1:01:24] so when you're born again your nature
[1:01:26] changes but you still have a natural
[1:01:27] spirit amen
[1:01:30] think of it this way when you're unsaved
[1:01:31] you have a temporal body a temporal
[1:01:33] spirit and a temporal soul
[1:01:35] all of them can be destroyed it can be
[1:01:37] taste the second death never exist
[1:01:39] anymore but when you're when you're
[1:01:41] saved you still have a temporal body and
[1:01:43] a temporal spirit but you have an
[1:01:45] eternal soul
[1:01:46] so what happens to the elect at the
[1:01:48] rapture what's the what's that you see
[1:01:50] here unsaved you have saved and you have
[1:01:52] raptured
[1:01:53] think of it in the same way you have a
[1:01:54] glorified body a theophonic spirit and
[1:01:56] an eternal soul
[1:01:58] all of them eternal
[1:02:00] and so this is where when we still exist
[1:02:02] if you're unsaved you still exist in
[1:02:04] this channel of all human
[1:02:07] when you're saved you still have a human
[1:02:08] mind and a human body
[1:02:10] now as you look at this and this is just
[1:02:12] my way of expressing it to you as i
[1:02:13] close
[1:02:15] when we when we put it this way and
[1:02:17] we're saying this is a matter of faith
[1:02:18] that can work both for the unsaved and
[1:02:20] the saved it may seem overly simplistic
[1:02:22] or
[1:02:23] incredibly i think it's incredibly
[1:02:25] simple but yet it's complex and maybe it
[1:02:28] sounds i'm saying it's incredibly simple
[1:02:30] but it's complex and we realize that but
[1:02:33] i'm not there's no need to complicate it
[1:02:35] right
[1:02:37] the on and again i will say this as we
[1:02:39] look at this and we read as we've read
[1:02:40] these statements this is this is not
[1:02:42] doctrine in the sense that we're
[1:02:43] legalistic about this
[1:02:45] this is not to create a paradigm or some
[1:02:47] sort of construct where no it always has
[1:02:49] to fit in this way that's sometimes when
[1:02:51] we get in trouble because it always has
[1:02:52] to be threes and it always has to be
[1:02:54] sevens and as soon as something kind of
[1:02:56] varies from that you'll actually
[1:02:58] fight the word of god because you get
[1:02:59] real legalistic and rigid in your types
[1:03:01] and your numbers
[1:03:03] this is just a way that i'm wanting to
[1:03:04] present it to you to conceptualize the
[1:03:06] process and how the word preached can be
[1:03:08] heard
[1:03:09] accept it intellectually and drop even
[1:03:11] to a person's heart and they receive the
[1:03:13] benefits of it
[1:03:15] and still be in the condition that they
[1:03:16] are on the left
[1:03:18] because the unsaved believe mentally
[1:03:22] right and so when they believe mentally
[1:03:23] they're believing from the spirit
[1:03:26] and they're and they're believing from
[1:03:28] their emotions they're believing from
[1:03:29] their intellect they're believing
[1:03:30] academically and then when it comes to
[1:03:32] the soul
[1:03:33] to open up to accept to let in or to let
[1:03:35] out when it comes to the mind to kind of
[1:03:37] control that are you going to accept
[1:03:39] what the mind is thinking accept the
[1:03:40] mind that's been turned you can accept
[1:03:41] the mind that's looking to the promise
[1:03:43] looking to calvary when that part when
[1:03:45] the soul will say i believe and accept
[1:03:48] their healing god will heal a person who
[1:03:51] believes that way
[1:03:52] you know as they've had enough mental
[1:03:54] faith and in their in that realm of
[1:03:56] doubt and belief they believe it and
[1:03:58] that's why a prostitute could come to
[1:04:00] the platform and not be sanctified
[1:04:02] necessarily not have the holy ghost but
[1:04:05] still believe enough intellectually to
[1:04:07] go through the prayer line and have the
[1:04:08] power of god work on her enough for the
[1:04:10] soul to not resist it or reject it
[1:04:16] that soul acts as a womb of the spirit
[1:04:19] so the soul that that is being
[1:04:21] represented by a heart
[1:04:23] that whatever promise you're receiving
[1:04:25] it's got to take root there or it'll
[1:04:26] never come to life
[1:04:28] no matter how much you believe it in the
[1:04:29] spirit now how much you believe in that
[1:04:31] blue ring unless it comes down to the
[1:04:33] soul to believe it then it never going
[1:04:34] to manifest because that part is the
[1:04:36] womb where that's the only place that
[1:04:38] that promise can be effective but if
[1:04:41] you're still just holding it in those
[1:04:43] two realms as long as your intellect and
[1:04:46] your soul can agree
[1:04:48] you'll stay healed
[1:04:51] think about it as long as the soul and
[1:04:53] the mind remain remain in stasis
[1:04:56] as long as you don't start doubting your
[1:04:58] mind you'll stay healed as long as the
[1:05:00] soul doesn't choose to reject it you'll
[1:05:01] stay healed
[1:05:03] as long as those two remain
[1:05:05] but for the saved
[1:05:09] if i could put it this way and i want to
[1:05:11] read one more statement before we close
[1:05:14] it's really a matter of clearing out the
[1:05:16] tangle in our spirits
[1:05:18] because the holy ghost is there in the
[1:05:20] soul you've got it from the inside it's
[1:05:22] in a place where it's from the inside
[1:05:23] looking out
[1:05:25] and then we're taught that if the mind
[1:05:27] doesn't agree with it disagree with your
[1:05:29] mind
[1:05:31] when whenever whenever those other
[1:05:32] senses say anything different from the
[1:05:34] soul you're saying no
[1:05:36] from the soul you're saying nope and
[1:05:38] it's got to take everything there that's
[1:05:40] in that spirit because it's in the soul
[1:05:42] if it's in the soul it's where it
[1:05:43] belongs it's where it needs to be you've
[1:05:44] got it on the inside looking out but
[1:05:46] where the believer struggles is there's
[1:05:48] still that human cloud of the spirit
[1:05:51] that it's got to push through
[1:05:53] to manifest in the body
[1:05:55] so there's there's the same person can
[1:05:57] be at two different states
[1:05:59] that you can receive healing through an
[1:06:01] intellectual faith which is a function
[1:06:03] of aligning your human mind and your
[1:06:05] soul to believe a promise of god but
[1:06:07] that's just something temporary
[1:06:10] that's a temporal healing for a temple a
[1:06:11] temporary body
[1:06:13] but to be born again is to receive him
[1:06:16] in the soul and to be changed from the
[1:06:18] inside
[1:06:20] and this is what's represented here
[1:06:23] do i let me see if i have that quote i
[1:06:24] guess i do i'll just read it from you
[1:06:26] here bro john you could take over from
[1:06:27] here
[1:06:28] it's in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:06:30] now when he teaches the greatest back
[1:06:32] when he preaches the greatest battle
[1:06:32] ever fought brother brown uses his
[1:06:34] terminology just a little bit different
[1:06:35] i think you know where i'm going he's he
[1:06:37] uses body soul spirit
[1:06:40] but that's just a terminology or
[1:06:42] semantics
[1:06:43] he still teaches from the standpoint
[1:06:44] that we're body spirit soul
[1:06:47] the function of each is still the same
[1:06:49] but after the seals he never reverts
[1:06:50] back to this little period where he says
[1:06:52] body soul spirit so semantics can be
[1:06:55] different language can be different but
[1:06:56] in terms of the control tower where the
[1:06:58] heart is body
[1:07:00] spirit soul
[1:07:02] so he says your mind opens up and
[1:07:04] brother man says your mind is controlled
[1:07:06] by the soul
[1:07:08] if we're using the language he uses post
[1:07:10] after this when he and he never reverts
[1:07:12] back think of that your mind's
[1:07:13] controlled by your soul
[1:07:15] so the soul has this power to let in to
[1:07:17] let out to accept or reject to choose
[1:07:19] right it says your mind opens up and
[1:07:21] accepts the spirit or it rejects the
[1:07:23] spirit
[1:07:24] you can have little consciousness and
[1:07:25] little feelings little sensations and
[1:07:27] all things that has nothing to do with
[1:07:29] it that's just little sensations and
[1:07:31] things but when it comes to reality your
[1:07:33] mind opens it up your mind either
[1:07:35] accepts it or rejects it that's the
[1:07:37] whole that's the soul
[1:07:40] he says that's it friends god let none
[1:07:42] of them miss it it's your mind that
[1:07:43] opens up the door or closes the door or
[1:07:45] listens to your conscience listens to
[1:07:47] your memory listens to your affections
[1:07:49] but when your mind closes itself to
[1:07:51] those things and let god the spirit of
[1:07:53] his word come in it blows the rest of
[1:07:55] that stuff out every doubt is gone every
[1:07:57] fear is gone every sensation of doubt is
[1:07:59] gone every feeling is gone there's
[1:08:01] nothing standing there but the word of
[1:08:03] god and satan cannot battle against that
[1:08:06] no sir he cannot battle against it now
[1:08:09] we know that's truth
[1:08:11] that's where we want and this is where i
[1:08:13] think the emphasis over the last few
[1:08:14] services been you must be born again you
[1:08:17] no matter what's wrong with your body
[1:08:19] what's wrong with your spirit you want
[1:08:20] to know that your soul has been sealed
[1:08:23] that's the most important that's what we
[1:08:24] rejoice in and then if that soul is
[1:08:28] sealed what a great place to come from
[1:08:31] when we approach any promise of god amen
[1:08:34] brother brown i didn't bring the
[1:08:36] statement um and i'm not going to look i
[1:08:38] haven't even been looking at the time so
[1:08:40] i don't even know what time it is
[1:08:41] but brother branham talks about how that
[1:08:43] woman reached out and touched him by
[1:08:45] faith
[1:08:47] and was able to touch him by faith and
[1:08:48] he said she didn't even have a promise
[1:08:51] and yet she could by faith reach out and
[1:08:53] test him without a promise he says how
[1:08:55] much more should we
[1:08:57] this is someone who had faith and had in
[1:08:59] that human realm in that human state of
[1:09:02] being
[1:09:03] body spirit soul could believe enough to
[1:09:05] activate faith in god to receive her
[1:09:07] healing how much more should we
[1:09:10] who though we be in body and spirit but
[1:09:12] down in the soul have a promise and have
[1:09:14] the word of god how much more should we
[1:09:16] be activating the promises of god not
[1:09:18] intellectually not emotionally
[1:09:22] but down from the soul
[1:09:27] from that soul place and that's when you
[1:09:29] have
[1:09:30] even how the devil chose the mind
[1:09:33] chose that spirit and god chose the soul
[1:09:36] and when you get the soldier
[1:09:38] in the soul then it wants to meet the
[1:09:40] devil in that battlefield
[1:09:41] and that's where the believer's battle
[1:09:43] is
[1:09:44] your healing is not a ques a soul
[1:09:46] question
[1:09:48] it becomes a question of your spirit
[1:09:51] and let me tell you this there can be a
[1:09:53] point to where your soul and your spirit
[1:09:56] harmonize in a line and in that moment
[1:09:58] you're like healed or not healed i'm
[1:10:00] confident i'm just going forward i've
[1:10:01] got a promise with god and i'm not going
[1:10:03] to obsess about this i'm going forward
[1:10:05] we're not necessarily maybe talking
[1:10:06] about terminal situations or situations
[1:10:08] where you need to get desperate but when
[1:10:09] a person's at peace in their soul and
[1:10:11] they get everything blown out and they
[1:10:13] get the devil of doubt kicked out of
[1:10:14] there then they're the ones that can go
[1:10:15] forward and so i'm going forward i'm in
[1:10:18] i'm in this stasis i got my spirit
[1:10:20] subject to the word of god i'm bringing
[1:10:21] my body subject to the word of god i'm
[1:10:23] going forward because now it's a matter
[1:10:24] of faith not intellectual faith
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:29] okay i'm done
[1:10:32] are you
[1:10:34] i like that nobody wanted to answer
[1:10:37] all right could we stand together
